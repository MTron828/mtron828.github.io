Chapter 3087: Peak Rank Four

“He’s right,” Xiong Tao said in a low voice. “Although I have asked for help from Dao Palace, it will take some time for them to send experts here.”

“There were many experts from Heavenly Cloud Pavilion in the Jade Dragon Mystic Realm, and they came here as fast as they could. But it will take them at least 15 minutes to get here,” Duan Yu said.

“15 minutes?” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

15 minutes might not seem like a long time, but with their strength, they could fight many times in 10 breaths.

15 minutes was enough to fight several battles.

“Haha, 15 minutes? Can you hold on for 15 minutes?”The cold elder sneered and looked at Xiong Tao and Jian Wushuang, “The first genius of the Dao Palace. Although we don’t know the background of the other one, he was able to defeat Xiong Tao in a head-on fight. Naturally, his talent is even better. In addition, the others are also from the Dao Palace. We have gained a lot from this.”

“Let’s do it. Kill all these geniuses. As for Xiong Tao, if you have the chance, capture him alive. He is a special life form. It will be very useful to capture him.”

“Yes.”

Following the order of the cold elder, the black-robed men, including the cold elder, immediately took action.

A total of five rank four True Saints, including a peak rank four True Saint, directly rushed toward Jian Wushuang and the others.

Jian Wushuang and the others gathered together with solemn expressions.

“The surrounding void has been completely sealed by the black fog. We have no chance to escape. We have no choice but to fight,” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice, “Xiong Tao, with your strength, you should be able to deal with a rank four True Saint, right?”

“Yes.” Xiong Tao nodded.

“You two are also rank four True Saints. Each of you can deal with one.” Jian Wushuang looked at the two rank four True Saints behind Duan Yu.

“No problem.” The two rank four True Saints also nodded.

“Bai Xiao, you are geniuses of the Dao Palace. Although you are only rank one True Saints, you all have some extraordinary strength. The four of you, together with Duan Yu, will work together to find a way to tie down a rank four True Saint. I will use my domain to assist you,” Jian Wushuang said.

“It’s difficult, but you can try,” Bai Xiao said, clenching his teeth.

“Then that’s it. You each deal with a rank four True Saint. As for the strongest peak rank four True Saint, leave it to me!” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold.

Xiong Tao, Bai Xiao, Duan Yu, and the others could not help looking at Jian Wushuang.

That was a peak rank four True Saint?

Under normal circumstances, a true saint at the peak of rank four would be much stronger than an ordinary rank four True Saint.

It was slow to say, but in fact, the communication between Jian Wushuang and Xiong Tao was completed in an instant.

At this moment, they had reached an agreement.

“Attack!”

Jian Wushuang shouted, and everyone moved in an instant.

Rumble! Boundless divine power crazily condensed behind Jian Wushuang, and the 30,000-feet-tall Golden Emperor Phantom looked down at everything.

The star power in Jian Wushuang’s body was also activated, and his aura suddenly increased. In addition, a layer of dark-gold armor appeared on his body!

Seven-star secret skill, divine punishment, and nine luminaries star armor were used at the same time!

At the same time, a supreme sword essence burst out from the Blood Mountain Sword.

However, when Jian Wushuang defeated Xiong Tao, he had only used the punishment divine realm.

As for the seven-star secret skill, the nine luminaries star armor, and the supreme sword essence in the Blood Mountain Sword, he had not used them.

But now, he was going to face a genuine peak rank four True Saint, which was much more powerful than the Magic Note King he had met in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom. He did not dare to be careless in the face of such an opponent! He had to use his full strength!

“Xi Xiang!” Jian Wushuang shouted.

Whoosh!

The sword light was swung, and a sword shadow was slashed out.

The moment it was slashed out, a thick beast roar reverberated in the sky and earth.

“A mere pearl dares to compete with the sun and moon?”

The cold elder glanced at Jian Wushuang with disdain on the corner of his mouth, and then he slapped his hand.

Boom!

The world shook, and a huge black palm print completely covered the void in front of Jian Wushuang.

The sword shadow hit the black palm print head-on. The black palm print instantly collapsed, and a large amount of divine power scattered in all directions, the sword shadow was still pressing toward the cold elder with extraordinary power.

“What?” The cold elder was shocked, but he suddenly retreated and dodged Jian Wushuang’s sword.

“This kid is much stronger than when he fought with Xiong Tao?” The cold elder was shocked.

He had witnessed the fight between Jian Wushuang and Xiong Tao.

He was indeed shocked by the strength of Jian Wushuang and Xiong Tao, but he did not really care.

Because both Jian Wushuang and Xiong Tao’s strength was only at the level of a rank four True Saint. They were not very strong among rank four True Saints, so how could they compare with him, a peak rank four True Saint?

But who would have thought that when he fought with Jian Wushuang, Jian Wushuang’s strength was much stronger than before.

“This kid hid a lot of strength when he fought with Xiong Tao?” The cold elder narrowed his eyes and his expression became serious.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were also cold as he stared at the cold elder. “With my strength, it’s not difficult for me to fight against a True Saint at the peak of rank four. But what I want to do is not to fight him head-on.”

While Jian Wushuang was pondering, he was also observing the surrounding battlefields.

In the surrounding battlefields, Xiong Tao, Bai Xiao, and the others fought against a rank four True Saint according to Jian Wushuang’s instructions.

Xiong Tao was fine. As a special life form, his strength was indeed impressive. Even if he faced a rank four True Saint head-on, he was not at a disadvantage.

However, the situation on the other battlefields was not very advantageous.

The first was the two fourth level True Saints under Duan Yu’s command. Although they were also fourth level True Saints, they were only sent by the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion to be Duan Yu’s subordinates. Their status in the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion was very low, so their strength was naturally not much stronger, the two of them faced a black-robed man, but in the end, both of them were at an absolute disadvantage.

On the other side, Bai Xiao, Duan Yu, and the others were struggling with the last black-robed man, but the situation was not optimistic. Their personal strength was far inferior to that of the black-robed man, one moment of carelessness and they might be defeated by the black-robed man.

“I have no choice. I have to end this battle quickly!” Jian Wushuang’s expression was solemn. There was a hint of killing intent in his eyes as he looked at the cold old man.
