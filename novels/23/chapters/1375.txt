Chapter 1376: Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Lineage of Star controlled four mystery lands and nine shrines.

The nine shrines were only chances, whilst the four mystery lands were chances accompanied with danger.

It was in a huge cave dwelling that was formed with special crystals.

“Jian Wushuang, you just got to Lineage of Star not long ago and you’re not that strong. If you were to go to the four mystery lands, wouldn’t it be too early?” Hall Master Yuan creased his eyebrows as he asked Jian Wushuang.

“My power has reached a bottleneck as of now. If I continue to cultivate in seclusion in Lineage of Star, there won’t be much progress,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Which mystery land are you planning to go to?” Hall Master Yuan asked.

“Tian Ling Mystery Land,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“That’s not too bad,” Hall Master Yuan’s tightly knitted eyebrows loosened slightly, “The four mystery lands that Lineage of Star control contained hidden danger. According to the level of danger on the list, Tian Ling Mystery Land is at the last place. Although it is dangerous, the possibility of you surviving is quite high with your current power.”

“Jian Wushuang, if I’m not mistaken, the reason you opted to go to Tian Ling Mystery Land is to improve your Soul Power, right?”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang replied frankly.

The four mystery lands had different characteristics and dangers. Tian Ling Mystery Land was best for experts who were good at consciousness and Soul Attacks.

That was also the reason why Jian Wushuang opted for the mystery land.

“When you entered Lineage of Star, your Soul Power wasn’t weak. Now that you have cultivated in Reset Palace for so long, your Soul Power has definitely improved tremendously. However, the way you use your Soul Power is too immature,” Hall Master Yuan commented.

Jian Wushuang nodded in silence.

That’s true, The way he used his Soul Power really was too immature.

Under normal circumstances, he only knew to add Soul Attack into his Sword Principle and perform it together alongside his Sword Principle.

Or, he could use the secret skill of Tian Yuan to perform a Soul Attack bluntly.

However, the secret skill was merely an attack measure and not the fundamental method.

“Jian Wushuang, if you are not in a hurry, wait for another two years in the Lineage of Star. Then, you can depart again after two years,” Hall Master Yuan smiled and replied.

“Another two years? Why?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

“You’ll know by then,” Hall Master Yuan smiled mysteriously but didn’t clarify why.

Although Jian Wushuang found it suspicious, he didn’t really mind waiting for another two years.

In the two years, he stayed in the Milky Way and constantly caught Meta beasts to extract their Meta strength.

He was going to wander around the mystery land after all. He wouldn’t know how long he would be gone for. It’d be good to prepare for Meta strength to nourish his soul.

Two years later, Jian Wushuang came to the cave dwelling again. This time, he saw Hall Master Yuan and also Lei Chao.

“Jian Wushuang, this is for you.”

Lei Chao waved and threw a token to Jian Wushuang.

“This is it?” Jian Wushuang took it subconsciously but he looked confused.

It’s a manipulation method of Soul Power. I spent time and effort to specially get this for you,” Lei Chao said.

“Specially get it for me?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“When I told you to wait for two years previously, I was asking you to wait for Lei Chao,” Hall Master Yuan laughed, “You had Soul Power, but you didn’t know the manipulation method of the Soul Power. Isn’t that a waste of your advantage? We at the Lineage of Star have a manipulation method of Soul Power but it is rather profound. With your current level, it would be extremely difficult for you to enter. So, I sent Lei Chao to get the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack for you.

“This, this…” Jian Wushuang was at loss for words. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Why? Are you overwhelmed?” Hall Master Yuan smiled and asked.

“A little,” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

Many ordinary disciples in Lineage of Star, including the disciples in Star Palace, relied on their capabilities to fight for resources in Lineage of Star.

As for favors bestowed to the experts in Lineage of Star… Unless you were a direct descendant of one’s disciple, no one would grant the other any treasures or chances.

But then, Hall Master Yuan told Lei Chao to spend a few years time to specially get him the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack.

Jian Wushuang was of course overwhelmed by such treatment.

“Actually I did so because I wanted to be fair.

Hall Master Yuan looked over, “You’re a Universe God in the First Heaven after all. But you have to pretend to be a Universe God in the Second Heaven. You even have to participate in the battle as a Universe God in the Second Heaven. To you, it is really unfair. So, now that I have provided you with this Knack, it can be considered compensation. As for the battle that is going to happen in a few hundred years, it’ll be depending on you and if you can maintain your identity as a disciple of Star Palace.”

“Oh, I see,” Jian Wushuang then understood the situation.

“I have passed you the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack. Bring it back and study it. After you’re prepared, head over to Tian Ling Mystery Land. Besides, whenever disciples of Star Palace wander in the four mystery lands, they will be assigned with a task. Same goes to you. The task in Tian Ling Mystery Land is for you to collect Tian Ling Crystals!” Hall Master Yuan continued.

“Under normal circumstances, an ordinary disciple in Lineage of Star at the level of Universe God in the Second Heaven has to collect three Tian Ling Crystals!”

“And you’re a disciple of Star Palace so the difficulty of the task shall be higher. You have to collect ten Tian Ling crystals to be considered to have completed your task.”

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly. He had heard that everyone who wandered the four mystery lands would be assigned a task, so he was mentally prepared.

“Go ahead.”

Hall Master waved his hand and Jian Wushuang left.

After Jian Wushuang left, he wasn’t in a hurry to get to Tian Ling Mystery Land but returned to Sword Star. He started studying the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack.

“Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack developed and evolved Soul Power into five beasts. It then formed a balance to fight fiercely with the opponent… Such an interesting method!”

Jian Wushuang had merely studied it for a while but he could see why the method was so amazing.

“Jian Wushuang, the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack is just a fundamental method of how to use Soul Power. It’s not that precious. It is even far from the secret skill of Tian Yuan that you’ve gotten. However, the secret skill of Tian Yuan is a secret skill. So, it wouldn’t be that easy to be carried out. But this fundamental method of using Soul Power is what you are lacking right now,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Go ahead and study for a few days on your own. After you master the simple way to use your Soul Power, head over to Tian Yuan Mystery Land for practical training. Then, you’ll be able to familiarize yourself with the method.”

“I know,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

He stayed in Sword Star for a month. After a month, when he understood the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack to a certain level, he got ready to head over to Tian Ling Mystery Land.
