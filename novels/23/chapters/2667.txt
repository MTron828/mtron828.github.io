Chapter 2668: The Stakes

The divine power fountain in the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion contained unlimited divine power—allowing her to achieve High-level Earth Ultimate God from Primary-level Ultimate God within a short period of ten years because. It obviously had a lot to do with her being talented and fast at understanding the laws and principles. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

However, the Ancient Witch did not expect Jian Wushuang’s realm cultivation to not only be comparable with her but was even at an entire realm higher!

She could feel Jian Wushuang’s divine power that had obviously achieved Peak-level Earth Ultimate God.

“How did he cultivate?” The Ancient Witch directly rushed forward with a slight doubtfulness.

“Jian Yi, we meet again.” The Ancient Witch spoke in a cold and slightly unfriendly voice.

“This is quite a coincidence. Who knew I’ll bump into you here at the Sacred Palace?” Jian Wushuang was also quite surprised as he knew the Ancient Witch’s identity.

The heavenly pride of the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion actually came to this Sacred Palace?

The Ancient Witch had a cold look in her eyes. “Humph, did you remember what I’ve previously said? I ask that you don’t bump into me again or I’ll definitely get you back next time and win. I’ve finally met you today. There’s nothing else apart from fighting me.”

“Fight against you? Are you sure?” Jian Wushuang had an interesting smile as he unscrupulously emitted his Peak Earth Ultimate God divine power.

His divine power was obviously one whole level stronger than the Ancient Witch.

The Ancient Witch’s face darkened and immediately shouted in a low voice, “If you are considerate, you’ll only use the High-level Earth Ultimate God’s divine power similar to mine. Let’s decide our victory based on our laws perception and principles understanding. What do you think?”

Jian Wushuang’s facial expression grew weirder as he heard that.

The Sacred Palace disciples were also behaving extremely weirdly.

“Who’s this? Is he also a disciple of our Sacred Palace? Why haven’t we met him before?”

“Yes, he’s also a Sacred Palace disciple who entered via the Sacred Heaven Road nine years ago. I heard rumors that he’s very talented but has always been in seclusion and seldom shows himself ever since entering the Sacred Palace. I wonder why he came out today.”

“He seems to be an old acquaintance of the Ancient Witch who has proactively challenged him.” Sounds of chatters started surrounding them one-by-one.

Juan Wushuang smiled indifferently. “It’s not every day the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion’s heavenly pride proactively challenges somebody. There’s no reason for me not to accept this challenge. We shall follow your suggestion and I’ll only fight against you using the High-level Earth Ultimate God’s divine power. However, it doesn’t seem interesting if we fight for nothing. Why don’t we bet on something?”

“Bet on something? A gamble fight?” The Ancient Witch narrowed her eyes.

The Sacred Palace disciples had surprised expressions on their faces.

“He actually brought up a gamble-fight when he’s fighting against the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciple? This Jian Yi is really daring!”

“He must’ve plucked his courage from the skies. Although he’s a Peak-level Earth Ultimate God, the perception of the laws and understanding principles aren’t differentiated by realms or levels. Although the Ancient Witch is only at the High-level Earth Ultimate God, you can see that her laws perception and principles understanding is almost as good as a Heaven Ultimate God based on her actions. He must be suicidal to fight her.”

“He brought up the gamble-fight? Oh my god!!” All the Sacred Palace disciples felt that Jian Wushuang was extremely daring.

The other heavenly prides of the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion speechlessly looked at each other while smiling. They obviously were thinking the same as the Sacred Palace disciples.

The Ancient Witch had her gaze set on Jian Wushuang. ‘This Jian Yi... He was able to defeat me in the previous fight because of his much stronger divine power than mine. However, his law perception and principles understanding weren’t stronger than mine as he didn’t even have a clue about the Principle World back then. His combat power might be stronger now that he has achieved Peak Earth Ultimate God but his only advantage will be his divine power. Divine power aside, he definitely won’t be my opponent based on his laws perception and principles understanding alone.’ The Ancient Witch was extremely confident.

She was a genius. What did it mean by being a genius in the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion?

Speedy level-ups in realms and cultivation meant nothing. A real genius would have scary improvements in law perception and principles understanding.

Jian Wushuang could not be considered a true genius yet in her opinion.

The Ancient Witch asked, “Jian Yi, what do you want to bet on?”

“I know that you’re from the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion and every Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciple is from rich families. Let’s bet on Divine Elixir Pills since you’re rich,” said Jian Wushuang.

The Ancient Witch directly said, “Divine Elixir Pills? Not a problem, how many do you want to bet?”

“Not much, a hundred pills,” said Jian Wushuang without much care.

“What?” The Ancient Witch was stunned.

The Sacred Palace experts and those disciples around them were also shocked.

Even the three prides of the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion also glanced at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

100 Divine Elixir Pills?

Those were Divine Elixir Pills and not Primordial Stones.

One Divine Elixir Pill was equal to 5,000,000 primordial stones in the market using the simplest calculations. 100 Divine Elixir Pills would be 500,000,000 Primordial Stones.

This was only using a simple calculation and 100 Divine Elixir Pills were definitely valued more than such.

Jian Yi stood in front of her and just mentioned betting 100 Divine Elixir Pills without any hesitation. How were 100 Divine Elixir Pills a small amount?!

“Why? The heavenly pride of the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion can’t even come up with a hundred Divine Elixir Pills?” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“No, it’s just that...” The Ancient Witch had a tight frown on her face.

She was capable of coming up with 100 Divine Elixir Pills but that would be her entire savings. Apart from that, she would need to exchange it with some really special precious items not to mention that she only had a dozen with her right now.

At that moment...

“Junior.” The red-haired young man from the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion looked over. “It’s only a hundred Divine Elixir Pills. Just focus on fighting him. All three of your senior brothers will help gather these hundred Divine Elixir Pills if you lose. Apart from divine power, how is it possible for you to lose to a Sacred Palace disciple with your abilities?”

The Ancient Witch was stunned before nodding. “That’s right. There’s a difference between our divine power in the previous fight but this time... I won’t lose for sure!”

“I’ll bet with a hundred Divine Elixir Pills.”

Jian Wushuang had a weird smile when he saw the Ancient Witch agreeing to his terms. “If that’s the case, let’s start.”

“Humph!” The Ancient Witch humphed softly and immediately made her move without any hesitation.

Rumbling~~~

It could be seen that a huge Principle World was directly forced towards Jian Wushuang.

The Ancient Witch had activated her Principle World when she was at the Primary-level Ultimate God. Her Principle World grew increasingly stronger as her principles understanding was elevated which resulted in her current extremely powerful 30,000 kilometers Principle World.
