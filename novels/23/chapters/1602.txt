“Fighting Space. This is where both people fight and see who is stronger.”

“Life and Death Space. In here, you will regain your Divine Power completely and you can fight to the death!”

“Apart from these two places, if you were to fight someone else in any other places, you would be punished immediately. Hence, no matter how deeply rooted your hatred is, you must absolutely remain calm. You must know that quite a number of Emperor-level super experts oversee the Thunderbolt Island. The moment you attack someone at any other places, they will suppress you immediately and not give you any chance,” Real God Wu Liang said.

“Emperor-level?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He also knew that Emperor-level experts were at the level of Sanctuary Masters.

For example, the Purple Moon Sanctuary Master was the Purple Moon Emperor!

Back then, Jian Wushuang had obtained two White Blaze Fruit trees from Wu Bei’s cave. As the two White Blaze Fruit trees were extremely valuable, even the Star Palace Master only dared to be in the possession of one of them. As for the other tree, it was given to the Purple Moon Emperor so that he would support the Lineage of Star. With that, no one in the ten Sanctuaries dared to set their eyes on the White Blaze Fruit tree in the Lineage of Star.

This was how high the deterrence level of an Emperor-level super expert was.

With quite a number of Emperor-level super experts overseeing Thunderbolt Island, no one in the ten Sanctuaries would dare to act presumptuously on Thunderbolt Island.

“Jian Wushuang, look,” Real God Wu Liang pointed toward a direction abruptly.

“That’s…?” Jian Wushuang saw that there was a lofty mountain at the end of the direction. However, at the middle of the mountain, there was a large saber marking that was made using a saber.

Not only could the saber marking destroy the universe, it was also extremely intimidating.

“What a frightening stroke,” Jian Wushuang revealed a panicked expression.

“That is left behind by an Almighty of the Sanctuary Alliance. Even though it’s only a saber marking, it still made many Real Gods who are proficient in saber skills obsessed with it,” Real God Wu Liang said.

Jian Wushuang also saw that at the foot of the lofty mountain, there were two shadows sitting down with their legs crossed and they were most likely comprehending the saber marking.

“A saber marking left behind by an Almighty has actually been placed there randomly?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Haha. It’s not only saber markings. Look over there,” Real God Wu Liang pointed at another direction.

Jian Wushuang looked in his direction and his pupils shrank at once.

That was a floating statue of a purple, crawling Exotic Beast. Its consciousness and size were not too big, it was floating in the air and it was also not too eye-catching. However, a total of ten Real Gods were surrounding it and they were comprehending the hidden secrets that the statue contained.

“What a peculiar statue.”

Although Jian Wushuang was looking at the statue from a long distance away, he nearly got absorbed by it.

That statue contained the shocking Myriad Beasts Doctrine.

“Now, look over there…” Real God Wu Liang pointed toward another place.

Jian Wushuang also saw many other peculiar places at the Thunderbolt Island. There were three holes that were created by three long spears, there were wonderful and unfathomable patterns, there were many different kinds of ancient characters…

Every place was extremely profound and there was quite a number of Real Gods studying them intensively.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang also saw three shocking sword markings and every marking had extremely similar qualities. Moreover, every marking caused Jian Wushuang to be stunned.

“Those three sword markings were left behind by the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain,” Real God Wu Liang explained.

“No wonder,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

The owner of the Sky Sword Mountain was an Almighty who was proficient in Sword Principles with great Sword Skills. Hence, the sword markings that he left behind were naturally not normal.

“The Thunderbolt Island is too incredible,” Jian Wushuang exclaimed with admiration.

During his walk, he saw tens of special places. Some of them were left behind by top Chaotic Real Gods, while some of them were left behind by Almighties.

In short, if those peculiar places were placed in the outside world, they would definitely attract a great number of cultivators to comprehend them. However, in Thunderbolt Island, they could be seen everywhere.

“Thunderbolt Island is full of opportunities everywhere. Those that you have just seen were merely a small part of it. For the opportunities, you have to look for them slowly and it is entirely by luck. If your luck is good, you will be able to find something that is helpful to you. However, if your luck is bad, you will be unable to find anything. For example, if I were to add the total amount of time that I have spent in the Thunderbolt Island, the time would amount to tens of thousands of years. During that period of time, I have found a few peculiar places that were suitable for me to comprehend in. However, I have never managed to come across a big opportunity,” Real God Wu Liang said.

“A big opportunity?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

“A big opportunity is where one is able to raise his abilities greatly in a short amount of time,” Real God Wu Liang laughed, “This kind of opportunity does not have a requirement. Be it left behind by a Chaotic Real God or an Almighty, as long as it is very helpful to you such that it can raise your abilities greatly, it works as a big opportunity.”

“I agree,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head as well.

Be it an opportunity or anything else, the best thing was for it to be suitable for oneself.

“Jian Wushuang, look over there,” Real God Wu Liang pointed toward another place again.

Jian Wushuang looked over immediately and he saw a lofty palace that was floating in the air. The palace was extremely big and it looked extremely imposing.

“That’s the Doctrine Palace,” Real God Wu Liang said.

Jian Wushuang’s body and mind became frozen.

Doctrine Palace… In the Eternal Chaotic World, the comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way by cultivators were based off the standards of the Doctrine Palace by using it as a reference. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Jian Wushuang had also heard of the Doctrine Palace a long time ago. However, he had never tried challenging it for real.

It was only until the very moment that he finally saw the real Doctrine Palace.

“The Doctrine Palace has nine levels. From here on, when you train in Thunderbolt Island, if you wish to check how much your abilities have grown, you can challenge the Doctrine Palace,” Real God Wu Liang said.

“Look over there. That area was left behind by a few top experts. In particular, that area includes a cave that was left behind by some experts. The cave also contains opportunities. However, the requirement is that you must pass their test…”

“There is a big wasteland in the middle of that huge mountain range which contains countless stone tablets. Records of a few Unique Skills are recorded on the stone tablets and you can study them directly.”

“There is also that ancient tower. The ancient tower contains videos of fights of countless experts and you can study it directly as well.”

Real God Wu Liang continued to introduce the different places in the Thunderbolt Island.

As Jian Wushuang listened on, he became even more dumbfounded.

When he first came to the Lineage of Star back then, he was already extremely dumbfounded by the excessive training resources that the Lineage of Star possessed.

However, even though the Lineage of Star contained a lot of resources, what was it as compared to the Thunderbolt Island?

It could not even be compared.

“As expected of the Thunderbolt Island which is the base of the Sanctuary Alliance. It’s indeed a place that countless experts yearn to come to,” Jian Wushuang gasped in admiration.

Under the guidance of Real God Wu Liang, Jian Wushuang came to the middle of the island in no time. Over there, he saw a total of thirteen extremely huge palaces.

For the thirteen palaces, every one of them was like a vast, lofty mountain and they were split into two regions. The first region contained four palaces while the region behind contained nine palaces.

“Jian Wushuang, what you are seeing right now is the thirteen Fairy Palaces which are famous in the Thunderbolt Island!”
