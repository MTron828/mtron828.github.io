Chapter 1011: Aurora Sword Principle

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the rift of the territory of the Rock Demon Clan.

Jian Wushuang was stunned when seeing the nine sword scars on the mountain wall.

Judging from the nine sword scars on the wall, he could imagine Sunrise Sword Emperor swiped faster and faster. The last one was so fast that it was even beyond Jian Wushuang’s imagination, which completely refreshed his knowledge of swordsmanship.

He then forgot about everything, immersing himself in meditation upon Sword Principle.

Under the command of God Hong, the clansmen of the Rock Demon Clan who used to meditate upon Sword Principle didn’t come to the rift to bother Jian Wushuang during these days.

Jian Wushuang threw himself into study, meditation and practice.

In a wink, five years had passed.

Jian Wushuang stood quietly in the rift, staring at a vertical boulder in the front. Then he drew out his sword right away.

Jian Wushuang drew his longsword out. With a flash of sword light, he put it back to the sheath.

If an ordinary person saw this, he wouldn’t believe his eyes, or he would think that Jian Wushuang didn’t even move.

Yet at this moment, the vertical boulder in front of Jian Wushuang was sliced in the middle of its body and finally fell to the ground. Its cut was extremely smooth and flat.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang couldn’t help putting a smile on his face.

“Congratulations, Jian Wushuang. You have created the second Sword Principle of your own.” The voice of Gu King rang in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“Haha…” Jian Wushuang said with a grin.

It never occurred to him that there would be nine sword scars left by Sunrise Sword Emperor in the territory of the Rock Demon Clan.

What was more, the nine sword scars were from easy to difficult, which made it quite easy for Jian Wushuang to meditate on. Through this meditation, he had been inspired in many ways. It helped him create his second Sword Principle over the five years.

“I created the first Sword Principle by absorbing the essences of many Sword Principles and integrating them to make a more powerful and horrible Sword Principle. Through evolution, this Sword Principle should unify into one at the end. But the second Sword Principle…” Jian Wushuang said.

Jian Wushuang squinted slightly.

“The second Sword Principle came from the nine sword scars left by Sunrise Sword Emperor through meditation. It also focuses on speed. By now I just learned its basis. It was also a Sword Principle at the most common level. As for its name, for now, I shall just call it Aurora Sword Principle.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He had created two Sword Principles. One of them was Coalescence Sword Principle, and the other one was Aurora Sword Principle. Both of them were Sword Principles at the common level.

Yet, there was still a lot of room for improvement.

Needless to say, as for Coalescence Sword Principle, he could make it more and more powerful by integrating more Sword Principles and making a perfect combination of Essence of those Sword Principles.

As for Aurora Sword Principle, speed was the most important thing. Now that Jian Wushuang had only preliminarily mastered it, obviously he could make it more powerful.

“Jian Wushuang, although you have created two Sword Principles and enhanced your overall strength, your swordsmanship can’t enable you to display your Sword Principles to full extent. Therefore, now you shouldn’t focus on improving the level of Sword Principle. Instead, you should turn to swordsmanships suitable for your Sword Principles.” The voice of Gu King rang in his mind again.

“Only when your Sword Principle match with your swordsmanship perfectly can you completely fulfill yourself.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded and said. He was also aware of his drawbacks on swordsmanship.

Boundless Heaven Sword Art was his best swordsmanship. However, Boundless Heaven Sword Art just focused on power, which was apparently not suitable to improve his two Sword Principles.

“It’s not difficult to create a matching swordsmanship to fully display Coalescence Sword Principle. After all, it unifies all swordsmanships into one, which makes it applicable to various swordsmanships. The problem is Aurora Sword Principle…” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

“About the swordsmanship suitable for Aurora Sword Principle, I do have an idea, but it needs to be tested in constant efforts.”

“The nine sword scars left by Sunrise Sword Emperor are profound and extensive. It has a lot in common with my Aurora Sword Principle. It probably can inspire me in many ways to create a matching swordsmanship.”

Jian Wushuang looked up at the nine sword scars on the mountain wall and then started digging into swordsmanship.

When he first arrived Samsara Continent, he was so eager to look for his father. But now, he was totally calmed.

The nine sword scars left by Sunrise Sword Emperor were of great use to him. He would certainly want to stay longer to improve his Sword Principles as well as his swordsmanship level.

As time went by, Jian Wushuang had long forgotten about everything else.

In a flash, Jian Wushuang had already been meditating in the rift for 13 years.

Upon the Void outside the rift, God Hong and Qing Bin stood side by side.

“Master Wushuang is still cultivating there.” Looking down at Jian Wushuang who was absorbed in studying swordsmanship, Qing Bin secretly praised.

“He has completely indulged in swordsmanship meditation.” God Hong said with a smile, “Jian Wushuang is not only extremely talented but also a lot more diligent than most people. No wonder he can make such an achievement in less than 2,000 years.”

“By the way, during these days, was there discontent from the clansmen who used to meditate in the rift?”

“No.”

Qing Bin shook his head, and said with a smile, “When Master Wushuang first came to our clan, he helped us to defeat numerous experts of the Black Python Clan and saved a lot of our clansmen. Everyone in our clan knows what he did. They appreciate him a lot, including clansmen who cultivate sword principles. Therefore, no one has complained about it when they knew Master Wushuang has been cultivating in the rift.”

“That’s good.” God Hong said, nodding slightly, “This young man has got extraordinary potentials. He’ll achieve great success in the future. It’s also beneficial for us to be friendly with such a potential expert.”

“That’s right.” Qing Bin nodded along and said.

“Speaking of the Black Python Clan, something might go wrong among them judging from their actions these days.” God Hong suddenly frowned and said.

“In terms of strength, the Black Python Clan is much stronger than us. In the battle between us, they will come at us outrageously as long as we win a little. However, this time we have gained such a big advantage, yet they didn’t reacted at all. It is absolutely unusual.”

“Take my order. Tell our clansmen to be careful as much as possible. My gut tells me that the Black Python Clan is planning something drastic.”

“Something drastic?” Qing Bin appeared puzzled but immediately realized. He said, “I see.”

God Hong and Qing Bin didn’t stay any longer in this Void. Soon they left.

Jian Wushuang was still alone in the rift, concentrating on practicing his swordsmanship.

Since he created the second Sword Principle, it had been eight years in total. His swordsmanship was quite different from what it used to be.
