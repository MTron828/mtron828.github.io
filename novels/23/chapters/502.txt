Chapter 503: A Girl of Unusual Strength

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang and Wu Yu were the only ones remaining in the camp.

He tried to get out of bed, but he could feel a great pain the moment that he moved.

Helplessly, he lay his back against a pillar, which was used to support the camp, as he looked toward Wu Yu.

“Can I call you Big Brother Wushuang?” Wu Yu blinked her eyes and then stared at Jian Wushuang. “Big Brother Wushuang, dad said that you shouldn’t move because you’re badly injured.”

Jian Wushuang smiled at her and replied, “Little Yu, was it you who found me in back of the mountain and brought me here?”

“Yes.” Wu Yu nodded heavily.

“And you did it on your own?” Jian Wushuang asked with doubt.

“Of course.” Wu Yu nodded again.

Jian Wushuang looked incredulous upon hearing her words.

He could not believe that a girl of eight had carried him such a distance all on her own.

It required a lot of strength to do that.

As he could not find any sign of Spiritual Power on the girl, he thought that it was impossible for her, a non-warrior, to have done that on her own.

If he knew that the girl had taken him home by holding him up over her head, he would have found it even harder to believe.

“Big Brother Wushuang, don’t look down on me. I have a lot of strength. Although I’m only eight, those who are a bit older than me might not match me in strength,” Wu Yu said proudly.

“Really?” Jian Wushuang held out his hand and said, “Little Yu, try to hit me on my hand.”

“Big Brother Wushuang, you’re injured! Are you sure that you want me to try it?” Wu Yu was hesitant to hit him.

“Just try your best,” Jian Wushuang answered.

Wu Yu immediately clenched her fist and casually punched toward Jian Wushuang’s hand. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The fist caused wind to flow through the air, and when it fell on Jian Wushuang’s hand, it made him shake.

“Big Brother Wushuang, are you ok?” Wu Yu asked with concern.

“It’s...” Jian Wushuang was amazed.

He could tell there had to be thousands of pounds of strength behind what was merely a punch.

The punch had not done any harm to him despite him being seriously injured, but it was still hard for him to believe that an eight-year-old girl could produce it.

“Monster!”

Jian Wushuang was rocked inside and out.

He had met some people who were gifted with unusual strength in the Divine Land, like Xue Luo, but none of them could obtain such strength by eight.

What amazed Jian Wushuang more was that there were others in the tribe besides Wu Yu that had such unusual strength.

“Little Yu, you just said that some of your big brothers might not match you in strength. Would I be correct in understanding that there might be someone more powerful than you?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“Yes, you’re right.” Wu Yu nodded. “In our tribe, I’m peerless at my age, but there are indeed some brothers with more strength than me.

“The best among them is Brother Qing Hu. He is 15 now. When he was eight, he could exert tens of thousands of pounds of strength.

“I’m no match for him at the same age.”

“Exerting a strength of tens of thousands of pounds at only eight?” Jian Wushuang was really astonished beyond words.

Suddenly, a child’s voice reached Jian Wushuang’s ears and then he saw a boy come in. “Little Yu, Little Yu!” the boy shouted excitedly to Wu Yu, “Brother Qing Hu is practicing his spear skills. If you don’t hurry, I’ll leave you behind to watch him practice.”

After saying this, the boy ran out of the camp quickly.

“Brother Qing Hu is practicing his spear skills!” Wu Yu became visibly excited. She said to Jian Wushuang, “Big Brother Wushuang, I’ll leave you for a while. If you need me, just call me. I’ll be nearby and won’t miss your voice.”

The girl left the camp in a hurry.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang forced a smile.

“Brother Qing Hu? The boy who could exert a strength of tens of thousands of pounds at eight?”

He was quite interested in the boy’s strength, so he ignored the pain in his body and struggled to go outside.

He left the camp and lay against the front door, his eyes fixed on a group of boys and girls in a cleared space.

The boys and girls were intently watching another boy display spear skills.

The boy seemed to be 14 or 15. For such a young age, he was rather tall and strong, simply wearing an animal skin. His exposed skin shone in the sunlight, making him look even wilder.

With a long spear in hand, even though his moves might have been displayed in a clumsy manner, Jian Wushuang could see a mighty power behind them.

“He is at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm!”

Jian Wushuang squinted at the boy with amazement rising in his heart.

In the Divine Land, it was not possible to see someone reach the Peak of the Yang Void Realm at only 15.

Even the talented Lin Lan, Jian Wushuang’s discipline, had only been able to do it at 18.

And that was why Jian Wushuang was so surprised. He had just arrived in this world and had immediately met this highly gifted boy.

“What a strong body and mighty power!”

Jian Wushuang could see how the boy crushed the void with his spear and he could hear exploding sounds one after another.

He could tell that the boy was as powerful as the lords in the Divine Land.

Jian Wushuang looked around and narrowed his eyes.?“Besides him, all the other boys and girls here?also have strong bodies.

“What... kind of place am I in?”
