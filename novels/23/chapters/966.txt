Chapter 967: Dao Yuanzi’s Treasure

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Dao Yuanzi came from the Eternal Chaotic World and was also a Blood Killing Sect expert, so his treasures had to be valuable.

Jian Wushuang saw the mountains of treasures that filled the Interspatial Ring, most of which Jian Wushang could not identify.

They were large in quantity and their value was difficult to estimate.

However, although these treasures were precious, only four of them were useful to Jian Wushuang, which had been picked out by Gu King.

The first of these four treasures was, no doubt, the Blood-killing Plate Armor.

“Blood-killing Plate Armor!”

With a flick of the wrist, Jian Wushung was holding a blood red armor that emitted a terrifying Killing Intent.

The Killing Intent was so intense that even a Dao Master would turn pale in the face of it.

Jian Wushuang had witnessed the Blood-killing Plate Armor’s power for himself and envied it. Now that Dao Yuanzi was dead, the armor fell into his hands.

“Declare your ownership first.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and declared his ownership of the armor right away.

The Blood-killing Plate Armor was an extremely fierce treasure, which was not easy to control. In the process of the ownership-declaring, a horrifying consciousness attack was released from the Blood-killing Plate Armor. The fierce consciousness attack could nearly destroy anyone that did not have a strong will and turn him into a complete murderous lunatic.

Fortunately, he cultivated the Univeral Dao Scripture and had a strong consciousness. In the end, he resisted the consciousness attack.

It did not take long for Jian Wushung to claim his ownership of the armor.

“A Chaos Magic Treasure?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

After claiming his ownership, he immediately noticed a message on the Blood-killing Plate Armor that said that it was a Chaos Magic Treasure.

“A Chaos Magic Treasure is lower than a Chaos Divine Treasure in terms of level. It can’t compare with your Mountain River Map, but it’s still quite good. Anyone who owns a Chaos Magic Treasure must be an expert in the Eternal Chaotic World.” Gu King’s voice rang in Jian Wushuang’s ears.

“The Blood-killing Plate Armor is known for being fierce among the Chaos Magic Treasures. And it is much more valuable than ordinary Chaos Magic Treasures.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed.

He could see that the Blood-killing Plate Armor was indeed valuable.

And soon after, he also appreciated the ability of the Blood-killing Plate Armor.

As a fierce Chaos Magic Treasure, it was incomparable in both attacking and defending.

It could cut down 90% of an attack, allowing only the remaining 10% of the power to get through.

And that was based on the condition that the enemy came from the Eternal Chaotic World and had a Chaos Magic Treasure. Otherwise, if the enemy was from the Green Fire World and just a normal Dao Master, his attack would be decreased by 99%!

Such terrifying defensive ability was greater than all the defensive treasures that Jian Wushuanbg had seen before.

“Does it really decrease a Dao Master’s attacking power by 99%?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with excitement.

It should be noted that he was now a Three-star Imperial God and had a strong body. Few Dao Masters could hurt him. Now, with the Blood-killing Plate Armor, he could decrease the enemy’s attacking power by 99%. Thus, fewer Dao Masters could touch him.

Even a Rank Three Dao Master could not hurt him very much.

“With my strong body and the Blood-killing Plate Armor, only a Dao Master at the peak of Rank Three can hurt me, and just barely. Moreover, even if I do get injured, Gu King will heal me in a short time.

“That is to say, Rank Three Dao Masters, including Emperor Xiao, Emperor Yun, and other experts at the peak of Rank Three can’t kill me. Even those who are close to the Celestial Master level can’t hurt me either. One must have the power at the Celestial Master level to touch me.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with excitement.

It should be known that only a few Celestial Masters existed in the Green Fire World.

And the Celestial Masters in the Green Fire World were all old monsters who had lived for many years.

They would not attack someone at random.

You could say that with such a remarkable life-saving skill, Jian Wushuang could go anywhere he wanted in the Green Fire World.

Moreover, this was only about its defending ability. Its improvement of attacking power was also enormous.

When Jian Wushuang was a Blood Eagle Guard, he had gotten a Blood-eagle Armor, which had doubled his strength.

Actually, the Blood-eagle Armor was modeled exactly after the Blood-killing Plate Armor. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Blood-killing Plate Armor contained a Secret Skill, which was divided into three stages. One would need the Dao Master’s Power to drive the first stage.

Jian Wushuang was a Three-star Dao Master, so he could easily drive the first-stage Secret Skill.

Inside the cave mansion, Jian Wushuang put on the blood-red robe that was transformed by the Blood-killing Plate Armor. As Jian Wushuang drove the first-stage Secret Skill, the blood-red robe took on a red glow. And a weird, blood-red mysterious crack surrounded Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang clenched his right hand and exploded the air. Then, he punched forward casually.

He punched a spiral tunnel in the Void. The tunnel spiraled forward in the Void toward the stone wall in front of him.

“Clang~~~!” The entire cave mansion shook madly. The stone walls were crushed into dust, which was then flicked off to somewhere far away.

Jian Wushuang was delighted by the sight of this.

“Wow, my attacking power has even improved more than 10 times over!” Jian Wushuang roared.

As a Three-star Imperial God, with his current skills, he was nearly at the peak of Rank Two.

But now, when he displayed the Secret Skill of the Blood-killing Plate Armor, his attacking power had increased by more than 10 times, which made his combat power soar.

He used to barely be at the peak of Rank Two, but now, he was a real-deal Rank Three Dao Master!

“In the Eternal Realm with a Rank Three Dao Master’s battle strength?” Jian Wushuang found it unbelievable at first but then quickly realized.

He was an Eternal Realm Inverse Cultivator that was equal to a Dao Master in the Eternal Chaotic World.

Moreover, a Three-star Ancient God was equivalent to a Dao Master among human beings. Therefore, it was normal that he had reached such a state.

“From now on, in this Green Fire World, I will be a real-deal powerhouse!”
