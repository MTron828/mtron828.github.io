“The Ancient Era experts that woke up have kept their hands to themselves for now in the Eternal Chaotic World, but their numbers are many. The Sanctuary Alliance would make compromises at times.”“Recently, we formed a line of communication with them as well. The Sanctuary Alliance learnt not too long ago that it was the Holocaust Sect leader that spread the news regarding the opening of the link passage.”

“Many Ancient Era experts were awakened personally by the sect leader,” Emperor Bai said.

Jian Wushuang frowned, but his gaze did not change much.

“Based on what the Sanctuary Alliance knows, the sect leader has a close relationship with one super-existence at the Absolute Beginning Divine World. Two hundred years later, this sect leader will likely head towards Absolute Beginning Divine World as well,” Emperor Bai glanced at Jian Wushuang.

He had known long ago about the relationship between Jian Wushuang and the sect leader.

That was why he had informed Jian Wushuang as soon as possible.

And as he expected, Jian Wushuang’s face turned extremely sour after hearing it.

“Leng Ruxue will head over two hundred years later?” Jian Wushuang murmured, and could not help but clench his fists. “No, I cannot let that happen. If she heads for the Absolute Beginning Divine World, I’ll lose Shuang!”

Jian Wushuang knew people of the current era could not pass through that link passage towards Absolute Beginning Divine World.

They were all cultivators of the Seven Star Divine Realm, experts on the other side would definitely slaughter them for that.

But the link passage was the only way into the Absolute Beginning Divine World...

If Leng Ruxue were to pass through it, he could not do anything about it.

He would lose his wife.

“When the link passage opens two hundred years later, I must block her!” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists.

Emperor Bai had obviously read Jian Wushuang’s mind. “The man behind the Holocaust Sect leader is very powerful in Absolute Beginning Divine World, one of the super experts at Master of Holy Land level. The link passage was opened with the help of him and others.”

“With such a huge background, no awoken Ancient Era expert dares to offend the Holocaust Sect leader. It’ll be tough for you to block her!” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

He knew what Emperor Bai had said was true.

If he were to block Leng Ruxue when she entered with the other Ancient Era experts, the rest would gang up on him like a hive of bees.

Meaning to say, if he wanted to block Leng Ruxue, he would need to go through all the Ancient Era experts.

“Shuang is my wife, suppressed by Leng Ruxue! If Leng Ruxue heads towards Absolute Beginning Divine World, I’ll never see my wife again!”

“Two hundred years later, at the Heaven’s Horizon, will be my only chance!”

“I have no choice!”

“Regardless of the price I have to pay, I must block her!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were twinkling brightly.

He was determined.

He knew it would be difficult to block Leng Ruxue from the Ancient Era experts.

But he had to do it!

Whatever the cost, even if it meant giving away his life!

“Understood, do what you must. The Sanctuary Alliance and I will assist you all the way,” he

said.

“Thank you,” Jian Wushuang said gratefully.

“No problem, I’ll go make the preparations,” Emperor Bai said and left.

Only Jian Wushuang was left at the manor.

“Two hundred years later, Heaven’s Horizon! My only chance!” Jian Wushuang was determined.

He had to make his move by then.

Naturally, he’d have to prepare for it.

“Emperor Thirteen,” Jian Wushuang took out his transmission token.

“What is it?” A cold and emotionless voice responded.

“Two hundred years later, the link passage at Heaven’s Horizon will open. I need to block one person, but the others will certainly prevent it from happening,” Jian Wushuang said. He knew Emperor Thirteen would understand the meaning behind his words.

He was asking for help.

“Understood,” Emperor Thirteen replied coldly.

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Understood?

That was it?

Jian Wushuang knew that it probably meant that Emperor Thirteen had agreed to help.

After a deep breath, he took out another token.

It was One-Star Man’s transmission token.

He had received it from him when he had passed the Reincarnation Pearl as well.

Now he could keep in contact with him.

“One-Star Man,” Jian Wushuang said respectfully.

“What is it, lad?” One-Star Man’s voice was still mild.

Jian Wushuang explained the situation, and finally asked, “I was hoping you could help me.”

“That’s it?” One-Star Man laughed. “No problem, I will try to block them from leaving anyway, I’ll even get my friends to help.”

It was a bit of a stretch to go against so many Ancient Era experts with him, Emperor Bai and the Sanctuary Alliance.

But with Emperor Thirteen and One-Star Man’s help, things would go much more smoothly.

And One-Star Man would call up his friends as well.

His friends were undoubtedly Seven Star Black Sect experts that had woken up.
