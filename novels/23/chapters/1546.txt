Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“I wish for Hall Master Yuan to send some of the Lineage of Star’s Real Gods to help me go to a powerhouse and capture someone alive,” Jian Wushuang said. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Capture someone alive?” Hall Master Yuan was surprised.

“That’s right,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

The body of his wife Leng Rushuang was currently being controlled by Leng Ruxue. Moreover, Leng Ruxue was a consciousness that was given birth by the extremely evil Primordial Great Sin. If he wished to rescue Leng Rushuang, he would need to first capture Leng Ruxue alive. After that, he would request Hall Master Yuan’s help. With an Almighty’s power, it might be possible to suppress Leng Ruxue and awaken his wife’s, Leng Rushuang’s, consciousness.

Hall Master Yuan laughed indifferently and asked, “Which Sanctuary and which sect?”

“That powerhouse is not within the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. Instead, it is at the Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom. It is also said that a few Real Gods exist there,” Jian Wushuang said.

“The Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom?” Hall Master Yuan frowned all of a sudden.

“Hall Master Yuan, is it troublesome?” when Jian Wushuang noticed a change in Hall Master Yuan’s expression, he could not help but ask.

“It is indeed troublesome. Truthfully, it is very troublesome.”

Hall Master Yuan’s voice became low, “Jian Wushuang, if the person who you wish to capture alive is in another Holy Kingdom, it would be all right even though they are ruled by the Almighties. With the power that the Lineage of Star possesses, we could send experts straight away. For example, we can send Lei Chao over and help you to capture the person alive. Even though this is done, the Almighty in charge of the Holy Kingdom would not look for us over such a small matter.”

“However, the person who you wish to capture alive now is within the Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom and the Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom is different from the other Holy Kingdoms.”

“How so?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

The Lineage of Star did not have to worry about the Holy Kingdoms controlled by Almighties. However, why was Hall Master Yuan so concerned about the Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom?

“Jian Wushuang, let me tell you the truth. The monarch of Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom is a Real God with abilities to stand at the top. He is Real God Jiu Gong and just like Lei Chao, he is also in the Real God ranking list. Moreover, he is ranked fifth in the Real God ranking list!” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Fifth in the Real God ranking list?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

The Real God ranking list and the Universe God ranking list were quite similar in nature. For one to get into the Real God ranking list, he would definitely need to be in the top few among the Real Gods.

As for Real God Jiu Gong, for him to be ranked fifth in the Real God ranking list, his abilities are probably very close to an Almighty’s.

“Not only is Real God Jiu Gong powerful, his way of doing things is also very unreasonable. Moreover, the most important thing is that there was once a huge incident between him and the Lineage of Star,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Real God Jiu Gong actually had a grudge against the Lineage of Star?

“Jian Wushuang, do you remember Ling Dan, the person who I sent you over to defeat at the Green Lightning Sect?” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Of course I remember,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

He still remembered Ling Dan slightly. After all, it was a match that made him famous.

He had defeated Ling Dan with one stroke, and later on, he had pushed back the Seven Planet Palace Master. With that, he had become famous and got into the twentieth position of the Universe God ranking list.

“Back then, Ling Dan had intentionally provoked the Lineage of Star. If not for you appearing and defeating him, the Lineage of Star would definitely have lost its prestige. After that, I intentionally sent people to investigate him in detail. After the investigation, I realized that there were some dealings between Ling Dan and Real God Jiu Gong. It seemed that Real God Jiu Gong had promised to make him his disciple if he could make the Lineage of Star lose its prestige.” Hall Master Yuan said.

“This kind of thing actually happened?” Jian Wushuang understood.

It was no wonder that Ling Dan was so unwise back then where he had challenged the prestige of the Lineage of Star. It was all due to Real God Jiu Gong’s promise.

“Back then, Real God Jiu Gong was forced out of the Purple Moon Sanctuary by the Lineage of Star. For many years, he dared not even take a single step into the Purple Moon Sanctuary. As for the Holy Kingdom that he controls, the experts in the Lineage of Star naturally don’t dare to go there. If they were to go to his Holy Kingdom and be discovered by him, he would definitely not hesitate to take action to kill the Real Gods of the Lineage of Star,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

At that very moment, Leng Ruxue was in the Blood Demon Church within Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom. Apart from there being a few Real Gods in the Blood Demon Church, some of them also possessed strong abilities. Hence, there would be no hope for him to charge into the Blood Demon Church and rescue Leng Ruxue alive. As such, he had to rely on the Lineage of Star.

However, he did not expect Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom to be controlled by Real God Jiu Gong.

“Jian Wushuang, it is not good to provoke Real God Jiu Gong. Moreover, the Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom is his territory and he would definitely know of any disturbances in his own territory. Hence, the Real God experts of the Lineage of Star absolutely cannot go there as it would be sending themselves to their own deaths. This applies to you as well. Although you are a Universe God and that he might not kill you due to his identity, he can still order the experts under him to kill you. In any case, if you were to go there, you would face very high risks as well. Thus, you had better not go as there is really no choice. However, you can still get someone to go on behalf of you to capture the person,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“No, I have to go to the Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom personally as that person is extremely important to me!” Jian Wushuang said with a low voice.

“Extremely important?” Hall Master Yuan frowned.

“Hall Master Yuan, there are some things that are inconvenient for me to tell you. However, I really have to go to the Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom,” Jian Wushuang said.

Hall Master Yuan started to mutter to himself at once.

After some time, he looked at Jian Wushuang again, “Jian Wushuang, it’s alright if you really need to go there. I will use the resources of the Lineage of Star to hire a few experts who will travel along with you to help you. Although the Real Gods of the Lineage of Star are unable to enter Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom, we can still hire people secretly and Real God Jiu Gong won’t know about it.”

“However, you must promise me something. After reaching Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom, you have to think of a way to hide your identity properly. Secondly, do not take action personally. You can get the experts that I have hired for you to do the work.”

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes brightened and he spoke immediately, “Since that’s the case, I will make a move to Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom first. I have to first clarify if that person is the person who I’m looking for. After confirming, I will inform you again.”

“No problem. Remember that you have to be very careful. Also, isn’t the Real God who you paid two White Blaze Fruits to get the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain to release from the Sky Sword Prison in the Star Land? You can look for him and get him to go with you,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Big brother Fiery King?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes brightened up.

Not long after the fight in Wu Bei’s cave had ended, the Fiery King was released by the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain. After he came out, he sent a message to Jian Wushuang at once to thank him.

Moreover, in recent years, the Fiery King also came from the Sky Sword Mountain to the Star Land personally to thank Jian Wushuang in person. Hence, at that very moment, the Fiery King was staying in the Star Land.

Jian Wushuang sent a message to the Fiery King at once.
