“Someone barged in,” there was a chilly gleam in Sir God Luo Sha’s eyes.

“What?” Sir God Mad Dog looked over with a surprised look.

“I set up a prohibition in the void. Even if there were to be someone who came to visit me, they would normally wait outside the prohibition and only enter after they received my permission. However, the people who came didn’t receive my permission,” Sir God Luo Sha said.

Hong!

There was a loud explosion in the nearby void. At the same time, there was a fierce divine aura that spread.

“D*mn it. They already started to attack the prohibition. Although the prohibition that I’ve set up is not too shabby, a Sir God could forcefully break it if he were to hit it with all his power. Among the people who came, there is obviously someone who is good at formations,” Sir God Luo Sha’s voice was deep. In a short time, the prohibition that surrounded the floating land collapsed by force.

“Haha, Sir God Luo Sha, you have been living the life all these years.”

There was a burst of hearty laughter, then there were four figures who plunged over. The four of them let out powerful auras and they were already at Sir God level.

“Four Sir Gods?” Sir God Luo Sha’s face grew grave.

“I have never seen the four Sir Gods in Sanctuary Alliance before. They are definitely not from Sanctuary Alliance. They are either from Holocaust Sect or Acheron Palace!” Sir God Mad Dog’s gaze grew cold.

In Eternal Chaotic World, Sanctuary Alliance was an absolute overlord, the supreme. There was no doubt about that.

However, although Sanctuary Alliance was strong, there was a hidden enemy. Star Demon Clan in the Eight Lair was just one of them.

Plus, Star Demon Clan had only stayed within the Eight Lair. As long as the number of Star Demon didn’t reach a limit, they almost never would leave the Eight Lair.

Besides Star Demons Clan, there were many hidden forces that could post a threat to Sanctuary Alliance. These hidden forces moved around the ten sanctuaries, they moved within Eternal Chaotic World. Among the hidden forces, Holocaust Sect and Acheron Palace were the strongest.

Holocaust Sect frequently massacred large numbers of cultivators for their own benefit. They would even massacre to the extent of a world or even a holy kingdom. They were definitely one of the most vicious forces. They were also the public enemy of all cultivators.

As for Acheron Palace, they were the most treacherous and the most well-hidden force. They did not take action recklessly but once they took action, the person who they were aiming at had almost zero possibility of staying alive.

There were countless experts in Sanctuary Alliance who had died at the hands of Acheron Palace.

Back when Hall Master Yuan had told Jian Wushuang to be careful of the hidden forces, he was mainly warning him about Acheron Palace.

A genius like Jian Wushuang, Acheron Palace normally wouldn’t let him live for too long.

“They are here for Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning,” Sir God Luo Sha instantly understood. “Old Mad Dog, I’m afraid I’ll have to drag you in for this.”

“Don’t mention it. No matter if they are from Holocaust Sect of Acheron Palace, they are enemies of Sanctuary Alliance, and public enemies of countless cultivators in Eternal Chaotic World. Although I am casual in manner most of the time, I do understand this principle,” Sir God Mad Dog said in a low voice.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The four figures appeared in the void not far away and they stood side by side but didn’t launch attacks in the first instant.

“I never thought Mad Dog would be here as well,” a treacherous elderly among the four of them squinted his eyes, “Mad Dog isn’t weak in power and he definitely won’t just sit and watch. He teams up with Sir God Luo Sha, it will be much more troublesome to deal with them.”

“God Qi, God Ba, the two of you team edup with me to fight against Sir God Luo Sha and this Mad Dog.”

“Your Highness Mu Hong, we will have to trouble you for Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning.”

“No problem,” Highness Mu Hong smiled and nodded. “I originally thought if there was only Sir God Luo Sha alone, I’d like to fight with her and have some training. As they are in a team of two… In order to save time, I shall not join the fight.”

“Your Highness Mu Hong, if you want to train, there will be many opportunities in the future,” the treacherous elderly smiled. “Oh yeah, when Your Highness Mu Hong arrives at Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning, it’s best if you first check if there are other experts in Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning, just in case. If there is, Your Highness Mu Hong, please instantly leave. If there isn’t, please go according to our plan.”

“Haha, don’t worry. I’m not stupid. If there is a powerful Sir God or Emperor God absorbing Power of Absolute Beginning in Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning, I won’t attack hastily,” His Highness Mu Hong scoffed.

“Sir God Luo Sha controlled the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning long ago. If we want it, we definitely can’t kill Sir God Luo Sha and have to catch her alive. As for the Mad Dog, we can kill him straight away,” the treacherous elderly looked at his other two teammates. “God Qi, God Ba, let’s do this!”

Hong!

The four Sir God experts moved at the same time.

Among the four of them, there were three that instantly gave out fierce Sir God aura and their power pressed to all directions. Then, they pounded Sir God Luo Sha and Sir God Mad Dog like lightning.

As for His Highness Mu Hong, he instantly flew in the direction where Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning was located.

As the four Sir Gods moved, Sir God Luo Sha and Sir God Mad Dog moved as well.

There was an extra pair of black gloves on Sir God Mad Dog’s hand while the boundless Sir God aura soared up from his body. The aura was tainted with an angry rage.

Wow!

Sir God Mad Dog’s body turned illusory. He originally was one figure, then he instantly became three figures. Just like three flowing lights, they burst out instantly and the three flowing lights waved their sharp claws simultaneously.

There were three figures that performed at the same time but they immediately merged together when the sharp claws flashed. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Hualalala. The void was torn into pieces instantly.

Sir God Luo Sha wielded a green soft sword and she was engulfed in a cloud of mist. The cloud of mist flew before her opponents and then the sword light flowed out.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

One sword light suddenly swept out after another.

Every single stroke of sword light carried a billowing hatred.

Hate! Hate! Hate!

With extreme hatred.

She looked as though she wanted to break their bones and scatter their ashes to the winds.

“Haha, Old Mad Dog, I knew long ago that you had comprehended a power superposition skill. Now that I see it with my own eyes, you live up to the name! It’s a pity that you are going to die in the end!”

The treacherous elderly, God Qi and God Ba, the three Sir God experts immediately greeted them by displaying their powerful skills. Their powers as Sir God experts were given full play by then.

The five Sir Gods were fighting vigorously.

However, although Sir God Luo Sha and Sir God Mad Dog were powerful, it was already pushing their limits for the two of them to hold back three Sir Gods. As for His Highness Mu Hong, who was going to Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning, they couldn’t do anything about it.

Sir God Mad Dog had sent a message to Jian Wushuang long ago.

“Jian Wushuang, something happened. Hurry up and come out!”
