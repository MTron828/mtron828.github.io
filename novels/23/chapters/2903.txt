Chapter 2904: Paying a Visit

——

“This move of mine is quite powerful among the absolute arts at the Saint-level. If I use it with all my strength, its power will be even more terrifying. It should be enough for me to use in a short time.” Jian Wushuang thought.

Thus, the ninth move of the space-time swordsmanship, Storm, was born.

“My strength has reached a peak in a short period of time. If I want to improve further, I have to find a way to get a large number of sacred elixirs to break through to the Peak Great Divine Master level. However, I need too many sacred elixirs to breakthrough in a short period of time.”

“However, even if I haven’t broken through to the Peak Great Divine Master level, my battle strength is still much stronger than before. In the entire Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, there should be no one who is my match except for the Supreme Lord Bone Emperor!”

“With such strength in hand, I can handle everything.”

“Next, it’s time for me to visit the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled.

While he was sleeping in the Divine Palace of Heaven and Earth, the Sword Alliance had begun to move toward the Heavenly Curve World.

Now that they had arrived in the Heavenly Curve World and had completely stabilized, the Sword Alliance had become the new overlord of the Heavenly Curve World.

Now that the Sword Alliance had settled down, he had nothing to worry about. There was only one reason for him to stay in the Golden Crow Nine World, and that was Leng Rushuang!

Through the spatial passage, Jian Wushuang soon arrived at the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City and arrived at the mountain gate of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion again.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang landed directly in front of the mountain gate.

Several experts of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion guarding the mountain gate immediately surrounded Jian Wushuang.

“Who are you?” One of them asked in a deep voice.

“Please go in and tell them that Jian Yi, the Master of Heavenly Curve World, is here to pay a visit,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

“Jian Yi?”

When the experts of Dragon-phoenix Pavilion heard the name, their expressions changed, and two of them were trembling with fear.

Their attitude immediately became respectful and humble.

“Lord, please wait for a moment. I will immediately report this.” A violet-robed lady immediately went in to report.

Within the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, the current Pavilion Master of the Pavilion, Long Xingzi, was currently sitting cross-legged, discussing with a red-haired old man.

At this moment, an upper echelon of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion walked in and respectfully reported, “Pavilion Master, there’s a person outside. He calls himself the Tian Qu Realm Lord, Jian Yi, and is here to pay a visit.”

“Jian Yi?” Long Xingzi was stunned.

“It’s that Jian Yi who killed the original Tian Qu Realm Lord, Elder Su?” The red-haired old man revealed an astonished expression.

“It should be him. After the original Tian Qu Realm Lord died, Jian Yi used lightning techniques to occupy the Tian Qu Realm. Right now, he’s the most respected person in the Tian Qu Realm. I wonder why Jian Yi came to our Dragon-phoenix Pavilion?”

“And it has to be at this time.” Long Xingzi frowned.

“No matter what, he is a guest. Furthermore, Jian Yi didn’t have any enmity with our Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. Since he came to visit us personally, our Dragon-phoenix Pavilion naturally has to treat him with respect. How about this, I will personally receive him and ask him why he is here. If it’s possible, I will send him away.” The red-haired old man said.

“Okay, you can go.” Long Xingzi nodded slightly.

…

Jian Wushuang stood in front of the gate of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and waited quietly. The cultivators of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion looked at him in awe.

Jian Wushuang was now very famous in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow.

He was a supreme genius who could easily kill an Immortal Saint as a Divine Master.

The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion was known as the number one genius concentration camp in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. However, no one in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, except for the Young Phoenix, could compare to Jian Wushuang.

Whoosh!

The red-haired elder rushed over from afar and soon appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Haha, Mr. Jian Yi actually came to visit the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion in person. It’s a great honor for the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion,” the red-haired Elder said with a smile. He first complimented Jian Wushuang and then introduced himself, “I’m Chu Yong, an Elder of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.”

“Elder Chu Yong.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

Jian Wushuang had heard of Elder Chu Yong. Among the three known Immortal Saints of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, Chu Yong was one of them.

Moreover, Chu Yong’s strength was quite impressive among the Immortal Saints. He should not be weaker than the master of the Heavenly Curve World who was killed by Jian Wushuang.

“My Pavilion Master has something important to deal with today, so he can’t come to greet you personally. So I have to do it for you. Mr. Jian Yi, please come in,” Chu Yong said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate and followed Chu Yong to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

It was his second time in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, so he was not unfamiliar with the environment here.

Under the guidance of Chu Yong, Jian Wushuang soon arrived at a magnificent hall.

Chu Yong ordered people to serve good wine and food, and then the two began to talk.

“Mr. Jian Yi, what brings you to our Dragon-phoenix Pavilion today?” Chu Yong asked directly.

“I’m here to greet you all. I’m now the new Realm Master of the Heavenly Curve World, and the Heavenly Curve World is one of the most powerful realms in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. As a realm master, I will certainly have dealings with the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion in the future. If anything happens, I hope you can give me some face and be lenient,” Jian Wushuang said.

“That’s easy.” Chu Yong smiled. “Although the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion is one of the four pavilions, we have never had any conflict of interest with the Heavenly Curve World. In the future, even if there is, we will take the initiative to negotiate with you, Mr. Jian Yi. After all, anything can be discussed.”

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang smiled. “In addition, there is another thing…”

“When the Dragon-phoenix list was opened last time, experts from all forces were invited to Dragon-phoenix Pavilion to attend the ceremony. I was there and I saw the Young Phoenix. To be honest, I was tempted by the Young Phoenix at first sight. However, I couldn’t say anything in front of so many people. This time, I came to visit because I want to see the Young Phoenix again and have a good talk with her. Is that possible?”

“Mr. Jian Yi wants to see Xiaofeng?” Chu Yong looked at Jian Wushuang in astonishment.

He did not expect Jian Wushuang to come here especially for Xiaofeng.

He admitted that Xiaofeng’s beauty and temperament were unparalleled in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. However, she had reached the level of the Immortal Saint, so she should be able to resist her beauty. However, looking at Jian Wushuang, he seemed to have been completely captivated by Young Phoenix.
