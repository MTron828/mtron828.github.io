Chapter 2095 Black Water Dragon Clan“s Crisis

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Waves of deafening attacks struck the formation which protected the Black Water Dragon Clan. Each strike made the formation tremble.

After a few attacks, the formation looked like it was going to collapse.

By the time the experts from the Black Water Dragon Clan reacted and showed up in the sky, a large hole had been formed in the formation.

Boom!

Many figures, radiating an overbearing aura, rushed forth.

“The formation which protected my clan is destroyed. The space-time around this place is sealed off. They are trying to…” The Black Water Dragon Emperor thought gloomily. She looked at the experts that were rushing into the formation.

Soon, she spotted the leader.

“Ba Su, its you?”

“What does the Sky Swallowing Clan want to achieve by destroying the formation which protected my clan?”

“What do we want to do? Since you can become the leader of your clan, you shouldn’t be an idiot. Black Water Dragon Emperor, can’t you deduce what I’m here to do?” Ba Su smiled coldly.

The experts from the the Sky Swallowing Clan were bloodthirsty and smiled excitedly.

The people of the Sky Swallowing Clan became stronger by drinking the blood essence of the people of the other clans. The Black Water Dragon Clan was one of the four top tier clans. Their blood essence was of a high grade and many of the Sky Swallowing Clan people craved it. Before the fallout, the people of the Sky Swallowing Clan could hardly have gotten a taste of it as they were careful of the other clan.

Today, they finally had the chance to get a good meal.

“Damn it!”

The Black Water Dragon Emperor was enraged. She spoke when she saw the men in black robes, “Looks like your Sky Swallowing Clan and the Acheron Palace are working together secretly. It was no wonder that you wanted to be the leader of the Special Tribes Alliance. If you became the leader, it would spell disaster for the Special Tribes Alliance!!”

“Humph! So what if I did not become the leader of the alliance? Do you think the Special Tribes Alliance can still exist and ally with the Sanctuary Alliance? Even if they could, your Black Water Dragon Clan would not be there! Today, I will completely destroy your clan and feed on the blood essence of your people!” Ba Su spoke emotionlessly.

“Attack!”

“Kill everyone from the Black Water Dragon Clan!!!”

After the order from Ba Su, the densely packed people of the Sky Swallowing Clan and the men in black robes hovering behind him charged.

Waves of terrifying aura radiated mercilessly in all directions.

“Members of the Black Water Dragon Clan listen up! Stop them at all cost!!” The Black Water Dragon Emperor roared as her voice reverberated within their entire clan.

At that instant, many of the Black Water Dragon members roared in reply.

Massive numbers of experts rushed forth from within the clan.

Even though the Black Water Dragon Clan was weaker as a top tier clan as compared to the Sky Swallowing Clan and the Ancient God Clan, their battle power was not to be looked down on.

From the actions of the Sky Swallowing Clan, people can deduce that this was a battle that determined the fate of the clan. If the Black Water Dragon Clan did not stop them, the clan would cease to exist. No one on the Black Water Dragon Clan wished to see this, hence they gave it their all and fought.

It was not just the Almighty, the real gods charged in bravely as well.

As the leader of the Black Water Dragon Clan, the Black Water Dragon Emperor led the charge. A terrifying aura burst forth as she went to meet Ba Su.

“Haha. Black Water Dragon Emperor, your fighting power has grown since the last time we fought. You barely made the cut for a stage two great emperor. It’s a pity that this battle power will not be enough to stop me.” Ba Su smirked as he displayed the fighting power of a top tier stage two great emperor. Even though the battle had just begun, he was already dominating the Black Water Dragon Emperor.

On the other side, the two great emperors form the Sky Swallowing Clan charged into the crowd and began a massacre. Within moments, many almighties died at their hands. The killing continued.

“Elder Zhong!” The Black Water Dragon Emperor yelled fiercely. Her voice reverberated within the entire clan and even penetrated deep into the ground.

At that instant, boom!

An aura that obviously belonged to a great emperor rose from the depths.

A man in grey clothes with a black marking on his forehead appeared before everyone. He was extremely ugly.

He rushed to meet the two great emperors from the Sky Swallowing Clan and managed to go even against them even though he fought them alone!

“Oh?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Ba Su was surprised when he saw this. “I have heard that the Black Water Dragon Clan is the weakest clan among the four top tier clans. This does not seem to be the case, at least on the highest level. Your clan is much stronger than the God Eater Clan. Besides you, your clan has another top tier stage one great emperor. This great emperor was never heard of before, you have hid him well.”

“Humph!”

The Black Water Dragon Emperor grunted but did not reply.

Elder Zhong was one of the hidden experts among the Black Water Dragon Clan. He was so old that even she, as the clan’s leader, respected him a lot.

Elder Zhong was not so powerful before. The reason why he could fight at the level of a top tier stage one great emperor was because he had encountered an opportunity when he went into the new ancient battlefield. His power grew as he cultivated on return.

This was why the Elder Zhong now was much stronger than before.

He alone could stop two great emperors from the Sky Swallowing Clan.

“Haha, my dear Black Water Dragon Emperor, do you really think that you can stop the Sky Swallowing Clan just like this? You are too naive. No matter what others say, the Black Water Dragon Clan is a top tier clan. Their foundation is extremely solid. If I was not absolutely sure that I could destroy this clan, why would I attack?” Ba Su scoffed.

The Black Water Dragon Emperor turned pale.

Following his laugh, two auras burst forth in the middle of the battlefield.

Boom! Boom!

Two shocking auras were felt.

“What?” the Black Water Dragon Emperor looked at the source of the aura.

What she saw were two men in black robes. One of the men stood beside Ba Su.

The auras that was radiated off their bodies were at the level of a great emperor!!!

Two more great emperors?

“This, this…” The Black Water Dragon Emperor was aghast.

Including Ba Su, the Sky Swallowing Clan already had three great emperors. Now two more had joined their ranks?

There would be five great emperors!

How could the Black Water Dragon Clan defend itself against this horrifying line-up of five great emperors and more than two hundred almighties?
