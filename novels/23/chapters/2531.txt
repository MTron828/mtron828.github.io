Chapter 2532: North Darkstar Continent

“Are you trying to say I’ll threaten the Northern Darkstar Territory Lord and even find ways to eliminate him to take over his position in the end and help you with your revenge at the same time?” Jian Wushuang looked over at Xiao Tiexin.

“Yes.” Xiao Tiexin solemnly nodded and immediately knelt down. “Mr. Jian Yi, I’m willing to be your slave, servant, or concubine for the rest of my life without regrets if you could kill the Northern Dark Star Territorial Lord and avenge my family.”

“Please get up.” Jian Wushuang immediately helped her up as he could see through her eyes Xiao Tiexin’s deep grudge.

The grudge of her clan’s annihilation.

Her parents, relatives, and many siblings had died in the hands of the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord.

It was an enormously mortal hatred.

Jian Wushuang frowned and said, “Tiexin, you’re actually very gifted and have an incredibly strong comprehensive mind. You’ll be able to take revenge yourself with your current progress on top of having good opportunities. There’s no need to become someone’s slave or concubine.”

Xiao Tiexin smiled wryly. “No, there’s something you do not understand, Mr. Jian Yi. I was the only one who escaped when my clan was destroyed. Although I survived, I had to perform my family’s unique secret technique during that battle to protect myself. The secret technique could radically and briefly raise my abilities at the cost of ruining my foundations.”

My potential has been exhausted with my damaged foundation. I’m really lucky to be able to become a Low-Level Ultimate God and will have an even slimmer hope of becoming a High-Level or Peak Ultimate God. It’s even more impossible for me to become an Earth Ultimate God. It was because of this that when the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord found out I’m still alive, he didn’t care to send people after me as he knew that I don’t post a threat to him.”

I’ll need to rely on other people’s help to seek revenge.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

‘Her foundation is damaged and future potential exhausted?’

He clearly knew the importance of a foundation toward any cultivator.

That was fundamental for all cultivators. One’s foundation had to be sturdier and stronger the further one wanted to go. Otherwise, it would be very difficult to make a breakthrough in the future.

It was the precise reason that so many cultivators in Ancient God Domain permanently remained at their particular level and were unable to make a breakthrough anymore. They lost the possibilities for further breakthroughs once their potentials were completely exhausted.

In normal circumstances, not many people would do something that might damage their foundations unless under desperate situations.

Xiao Tiexin was forced to use her clan’s secret technique in order to survive the dire situation.

However, she also exhausted her potential due to that.

As a matter of fact, Jian Wushuang’s method of directly ingesting divine powers to achieve cultivation breakthroughs could also affect one’s foundation, but he was not afraid.

First of all, his understanding of principles, laws, and many other matters in addition to his mental maturity had reached the breakthrough stages. He only lacked divine powers. The impact and effect on his foundations due to external divine power refinement and ingestion was extremely little such that he need not have to worry about it

Secondly, he possessed a perfectly flawless foundation such that those tiny bits of effects were like ants shaking a huge tree—completely negligible.

Hence, Jian Wushuang could behave so recklessly.

“Tiexin, I’ll be honest with you. Even without you asking me, I’ll seek the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord sooner or later. I’m not just interested in his position as Territorial Lord. More importantly, he possesses the Stately Painting treasure taken from the Xiao clan!” Jian Wushuang said with a deep voice.

“The Stately Painting? Mr. Jian Yi, are you also interested in it? Or do you mean...” Xiao Tiexin stared firmly at Jian Wushuang. She was quite shocked when Jian Wushuang mentioned the hidden information within the Stately Painting earlier. It was clear to her at that very moment Jian Wushuang had a strong yearning for the Stately Painting.

“I’m not only interested in it. I’m dead set on obtaining the painting as it was originally mine from the start!” Jian Wushuang said.

Xiao Tiexin began to slightly frown but soon relaxed.

All she wanted then was to seek revenge—to kill the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord. She could care any lesser for the Stately Painting.

“Alright, do so if you wish to follow me. I don’t know much about the Northern Darkstar Continent after all and you can fill me in on that. However, you’d better disguise yourself before we go. Although the Territorial Lord didn’t deliberately send anyone to kill you if you appear as you are in the Northern Darkstar Continent right under his sight, I believe he’ll conveniently kill you off,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Aye, I’m prepared for that.”

Xiao Tiexin took out a veil and a hat while she was speaking. The moment she put them on, none could recognize her.

After that, both of them immediately left Dark Thunder Territory and headed toward Northern Darkstar Continent. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

...

The Northern Darkstar Continent was the core of Northern Darkstar Territory, but it was not very vast. It was not even the size of a wilderness. However, experts who lived there were way above other regions of the Northern Darkstar Territory.

Jian Wushuang and Xiao Tiexin were already at Northern Darkstar Continent. Xiao Tiexin had told Jian Wushuang a lot of things about that place as they journeyed over.

Jian Wushuang carefully listened.

“The Northern Darkstar Continent is different from the wildernesses. Sects are almost non-existent in this continent. There are only various clans with varying ability levels.

“There were four top-tier clans in the continent among them, but since the Xiao clan had been eliminated, only three top-tier clans remained. The three clans are Wu, Shi, and Situ clans respectively. These three clans contained legacies accumulated over a million years or so. It goes to say their foundations and abilities—extremely stable and strong. Take the Xiao clan as an example...

“When we were at our prime, there were a total of four Peak Ultimate Gods and over twenty High-Level Ultimate Gods. As for Low-Level Ultimate Gods, we had over a hundred of them. Even so, we’re only ranked third among those great clans in the Northern Darkstar Continent.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang looked rather surprised.

Four Peak Ultimate Gods, over twenty High-Level Ultimate Gods, and more than a hundred Low-Level Ultimate Gods—that was an even stronger lineup than the combined forces of Dark Thunder Territory’s Eighteen Prefectures.

Even with that lineup it only ranked third?
