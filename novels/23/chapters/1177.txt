“What is it?” Lord Spirit Sound inquired.

“I want to communicate with people outside the Stellar Fog Sea, can I?” Jian Wushuang asked.

The Stellar Fog Sea was isolated from the outside world. Under normal circumstances, it was impossible to communicate with the outer world.

“You are the disciple of the Star Bloodline, so you are free to enter and exit the Stellar Fog Sea without being restricted by its Restriction. Naturally, you can send messages to outsiders.” Lord Spirit Sound replied.

“Really? That’s simple.” Jian Wushuang smiled and then took out a token. “Five Palace Masters!”

He directly sent a message to the five Palace Masters of the Green Fire Palace.

“Jian Wushuang, what’s wrong?” Void Temple Master sent a message back.

“I have just made a breakthrough in Sword Principles and I need some manuals about swordsmanships to improve my swordsmanships.” Jian Wushuang answered.

“Manual about swordsmanships?” Void Temple Master wore a smile. “This is simple. Our palace has been established on this battlefield for 40 million years. Therefore, in the Fire Point Exchange Office, there are plenty of such manuals and quite a few Mirror Images left by experts who major in Sword Principles when they performed swordsmanships. Since you need them, I’ll sort some out for you.”

“How many Fire Points…” Jian Wushuang asked.

“No need for Fire Points.” Void Temple Master said, “In the Green Fire Palace, Palace Masters enjoyed special privileges. Ordinary Celestial Masters need to exchange treasures in the Fire Point Exchange Office with Fire Points, but as Palace Masters, we can just take them so long as we need. We can put things that we don’t need there as well.”

“You are already one of the Palace Masters, although we haven’t announced the news. You surely can take the treasures in the Fire Point Exchange Office directly.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang smiled helplessly. “In this case, thank you for doing me this favor, Void Temple Master.”

“Nothing. Tell me where you are now and I will send them to you personally in a few days.” Void Temple Master said.

Three days later, Void Temple Master had already sorted out the manuals and sent them to Jian Wushuang. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

It was impossible for Jian Wushuang to meet him on the Stellar Fog Sea. So, they met each other in a branch of the Void Temple.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ve just casually picked all this out. There are still a lot such manuals if you need more.” Void Temple Master said.

“Enough, enough!” Jian Wushuang continually shook his head and was shocked.

Void Temple Master had selected a lot of manuals for him, including numerous images on which experts who specialized in Sword Principles displayed swordsmanships.

It would take him thousands of years or even more time if he was going to study them one by one.

They were all high-grade manuals about Sword Principles and were enough for him.

After bidding farewell to Void Temple Master, Jian Wushuang returned to Star Island again.

He sat cross-legged in the secret chamber and immersed himself in the study of these manuals.

Three years passed in the blink of an eye.

Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes and slightly knitted his brows.

“Although these manuals and Mirror Images inspired me a lot and improved my understanding of swordsmanships, I still lack practice.?If I want to create a more powerful swordsmanship, I definitely need to temper myself with fierce battles and time!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists and his body shocked suddenly.

Swoosh!

Another Original Body appeared beside him.

When he was pursued by the four kings from the Jin Kingdom and helplessly entered the Chillywind Valley, this Original Body was destroyed.

However, he repaired it after hundreds of years.

“My first Original Body just stays here to meditate these manuals and Mirror Images and my second Original Body might as well ventures in the outside world to temper his swordsmanships through battles.”?

Jian Wushuang made up his mind.

“Go!”

Jian Wushuang’s second Original Body immediately left Star Island.

His second Original Body transformed into a white-robbed middle-aged man who walked on the Void Continent and deliberately suppressed his aura at the Eternal Realm. He travelled around the world with a single sword.

Celestial Sword Sect was a first-class force on the Void Continent.

It had a profound foundation on the Void Continent and had existed for hundreds of thousands of years. It was well-known for its swordsmanships.

Countless Warriors in this sect had been working hard on swordsmanships over hundreds of thousands of years. The Nine-layered Sword Tower in this sect was very famous in the entire Void Continent. It was a Cultivation Sanctuary for people who cultivated Sword Principles.

One day, a white-robed middle-aged man came to the Celestial Sword Sect with a longsword behind his back.

“My name is Jue Ying. I heard that the swordsmanships of the Celestial Sword Sect are extraordinary, so I pay a visit here especially.” The white-robed middle-aged man “Jue Ying” said politely.

“Our sect always gives facility to cultivators who major in Sword Principles. Since you are a Sword Cultivator, please pass through our Swordstone Formation first. After that, we’ll treat you as a guest and you are allowed to enter the first six floors of the Sword Tower.” An Elder of the Celestial Sword Sect said.

“Please lead the way for me.”

Following this Elder, Jue Ying went into the Celestial Sword Sect.

On the same day, he easily passed through the Swordstone Formation and then lived in this sect.

He had just stayed there for one year. But within this period, he had continually challenged the top 10 guests in this sect and its six Elders as well as a Vice Sect Master.

The six Elders and that Vice Sect Master were all Dao Masters.

Jue Ying only utilized the power of an Eternal Realm expert to challenge them from the beginning to the end, but all of them were defeated by him.

Half a year later, this white-robed middle-aged man came to a lofty castle.

“I’m Jue Ying. I heard that Dao Master Tai Xuan’s Cultivation on Sword Principles is excellent and your swordsmanships are outstanding, so I come here to ask for advice!” The white-robed middle-aged man was still modest and polite.

“How dare you, an Eternal Realm rookie, to challenge me? You are digging your grave!”

Dao Master Tai Xuan was furious and directly acted. Jue Ying still fought him with the strength of an Eternal Realm expert. Although he was defeated at last, he withdrew from the battle with composure.

On an endless mountain that was covered by snow, there lived a Top Rank Three Dao Master who was also skilled at Sword Principles.

The white-robed middle-aged man “Jue Ying” went to find this Dao Master as well.

Jian Wushuang had two Original Bodies. His first Original Body stayed on Star Island to meditate and study manuals about Sword Principles and such Mirror Images left by other experts.

The other Original Body transformed into a middle-aged man at the Eternal Realm who named Jue Ying to travel around the world and challenge experts who specialized in Sword Principles to temper his swordsmanships.
