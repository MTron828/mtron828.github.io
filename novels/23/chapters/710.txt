Chapter 711: Dramatic Change

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Wu Dao multiplied into nine different doppelgangers and fled with haste. His speed blinded the others.

The Demon Gods chasing him, including the Gold-armored Demon God, were not able to recognize his original body, so they needed to kill the doppelgangers first.

Almost instantly, the Demon Gods killed six of his clones. However, three of them escaped. The Gold-armored Demon God noticed one clone and quickly pursued.

As for Dao Mei, he wasn’t able to defend, so the two Silver-armored Demon Gods and several Copper-armored Demon Gods killed him.

So far, three people who desired to kill Jian Wushuang, Dao Mei and Long Tao were already dead. Wu Dao escaped, but was seriously injured. He was still pursued, not sure if he could escape safely from the encroaching demonic adversaries.

Jian Wushuang was very satisfied with the results. It was a good scheme.

“Wushuang Brother,” Gu Qiong said.

Both of Jian Wushuang’s Original Bodies looked at Gu Qiong.

However, when he turned his head, the black-robed figure in the dark materialized. He was like a ghost, both Jian Wushuang and Demon Gods hadn’t noticed him before.

Gu Qiong noticed the black-robed man first.

“Watch out!” Gu Qiong yelled.

“What?” Jian Wushuang shuddered in horror. The feeling of being on the edge of life and death was all too familiar for him.

A flash of cold, blade light popped up behind him and stabbed his Slaughter Body.

The Slaughter Body didn’t have time to react and before the cold, blade light pierced his chest. His body wasn’t able to defend. Soon his heart shattered and the Slaughter Body died.

After killing Jian Wushuang’s Slaughter Body, the blade light slashed towards his World Body.

Obviously, the black-robed figure planned to kill both of Jian Wushuang’s Original Bodies.

The cold blade light still gleamed after killing the Slaughter Body and moved surprisingly fast.

Jian Wushuang’s hairs all stood up. Since he had been born, and until now, he encountered numerous dangers, but it was very rare for him to be this close to death.

Facing this life and death crisis, Jian Wushuang calmed. He stared at the cold blade light.

“Fast! I need to be faster!”

He tried his best to pivot his body. Now, if he wanted to survive, he needed to be faster than the blade light.

Chi!

The blade light flew through Jian Wushuang’s World Body and caused a scarlet. His arm severed in two.

Despite losing one arm, Jian Wushuang survived the deadly attack.

“Eternal Realm!”

He withdrew and steadily stared at the black-robed figure.

From the aura, which the black-robed man emitted, Jian Wushuang realized he was a real Eternal Realm expert.

And he was also a human expert!

An Eternal Realm expert should have wandered in the inner layer of the Eternal Zone, but not the outer layer.

This person was not only in the outer layer, but also attacked him without considering his position. Moreover, it was a stealthy one at that!

This sudden slash killed his Slaughter Body and cut one of his World Body’s arms. If Jian Wushuang was not calm enough, both of his Original Bodies would’ve perished. Then he really would be dead.

“Escaped successfully?”

The black robed man raised his head and showed an old, yet evil face. He stared at Jian Wushuang. Obviously, he didn’t think Jian Wushuang could survive such an attack.

“Hmm, even though you can escape one attack, I don’t think you will be safe after a second.”

The evil black-robed elder radiated confidence. He soon turned into an illusion and slashed towards Jian Wushuang. His speed was far quicker than the Divine Realm experts. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Dammit! What an outside bastard! Stop!”

A roar sounded abruptly. Gu Qiong popped up in front of the black-robed elder. His muscles bulged and blue veins burst, he waved his Giant Axe and slashed towards the black-robed elder.

“Gu Qiong Brother.” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“You want to die?” the black-robed elder flashed a trace of disdain and drew his saber.

BOOM!

Gu Qiong’s Giant Axe flew out and the power of the blade light hit his body. Even though Gu Qiong was a Demon God with a resilient body, his opponent was a real Eternal Realm expert. Facing this expert, his body was thinner than a piece of paper.

The blade light slashed through Gu Qiong and severed his body, he died almost instantly.

“No!” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed dramatically.

Although he only knew Gu Qiong for a few days, Gu Qiong was honest and forthright. He felt comfortable and cordial, and meshed with him very well.

In those few days, Gu Qiong treated him like a brother. During the dangerous crisis, he knew his strength was not enough to defend the attack, but he still rushed forward and stopped it for Jian Wushuang.

Although it was only one moment, it gave Jian Wushuang a chance to escape.

“Run, Wushuang Brother!” Gu Qiong said, roaring in a low rumble before falling down.

Jian Wushuang turned scarlet and his eyes filled with rage. He glanced at Gu Qiong and clenched his teeth.

“Dragon Blood Secret Skill!”

Jian Wushuang growled and his body also emitted a low voice. Soon his Spiritual Power burned quickly.

Xuan Yi Palace Master gave him the Dragon Blood Secret Skill to protect himself. The Secret Skill burned his own Spiritual Power aggressively, but it increased his speed dramatically in a short time.

The first level of the Dragon Blood Secret Skill burned the Spiritual Power a bit slower, but his speed multiplied by ten.

The second level burned his Spiritual Power very quickly, but his speed increased hundreds of times in a short time.

Now, Jian Wushuang exploited the second level of the Dragon Blood Secret Skill. His Spiritual Power burned immensely, as well as his speed.

SWOOSH!

Jian Wushuang withdrew and his terrifying speed exploded.
