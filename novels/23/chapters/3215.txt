Chapter 3216: The Ultimate Axe

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

“Attack!”

“Kill!”

Di Hao, Qian Hongzi, Duan Lang, Yue Yu, Feixue, and Jian Wushuang all attacked.

“Haha, the people of the Temporal Temple really overestimated themselves!” The people of the Destruction Saint Realm and the Illusionary Moon Sect laughed.

“Leave the Heavenly Sword Marquis to me. I’ll go kill him.” Su Xie smiled indifferently.

“Wan Xuan, Let’s join hands and teach Di Hao a lesson.” Thunder God said.

He did not dare to say that he would kill Di Hao directly.

After all, the Invincible Saint was very difficult to deal with if he risked his life.

On the True Saint List, only the top three had killed the Invincible Saint alone.

Di Hao was so powerful that he was ranked in the top five on the True Saint List. They did not dare to leave him here.

It was already good enough to teach Di Hao a lesson.

The people from both sides moved together and soon collided.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, die!”

Su Xie let out a strange howl. She easily passed through the crowd and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang like a ghost. Then, she swung the long jade-green whip in her hand like a jade-green flood dragon, her agile body directly lashed toward Jian Wushuang.

She was so fast and powerful that the sound of air cracking could be heard when the whip passed through the void.

Di Hao, Qian Hongzi, and the others had already fought with their opponents, so no one could help Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had to face Su Xie alone.

“An expert on the True Saint List!”

Jian Wushuang’s face was solemn. At the moment the battle broke out, he had already used the seven-star secret skill, the divine punishment skill, and the nine luminaries star armor. His battle strength had reached its peak.

When the jade-green whip lashed toward him, his body surged with majestic divine power.

It was the peerless sword technique, Xi Xiang!

Whoosh!

The most powerful sword move of Jian Wushuang’s sword technique swept out.

The scarlet sword shadow collided with the green whip. With a crisp sound, a terrifying power swept over. The Blood Mountain Sword almost fell out of his hand, but Su Xie twisted his wrist casually.

Swish! Swish!

Two more whips swept toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang could only barely swing his sword to block them.

Bang! Bang!

Another two crisp sounds rang out.

The first whip directly defeated Jian Wushuang’s sword style. At the same time, the whip hit Jian Wushuang’s body directly, severely injuring his divine body in an instant. His body also retreated rapidly, and the second whip continued to attack, without any hindrance, it directly shattered Jian Wushuang’s divine body.

Buzz!

Jian Wushuang’s divine body quickly regenerated. He stood in the void and looked at Su Xie in shock.

“So powerful!”

“Is this the battle strength of the True Saint List?”

Jian Wushuang’s heart was in turmoil.

He knew that he was not weak. When he used his full strength, he could barely fight against an ordinary Invincible Saint. However, when he fought with Su Xie…Su Xie only casually waved three whips, the first whip directly crushed him in terms of power.

The second whip heavily injured him, and the third whip caused his divine body to collapse on the spot.

The gap was too big!

Moreover, Su Xie was only ranked 24th on the True Saint List, and he was still at the bottom. One could imagine how strong Di Hao, Thunder God, and the other top three on the True Saint List were, how strong were the three experts who could kill the Invincible Saint?

As soon as Jian Wushuang’s divine body was reconstituted, Su Xie had already attacked again.

But at this moment…

Buzz!

A terrifying power suddenly burst out from the center of the battlefield.

At this moment, the world around them darkened.

The world was dark as if it had fallen into a void space.

Even the sound had completely disappeared.

On the battlefield, many experts from both camps looked in the same direction in shock.

At that spot, in the middle of the darkness, a cold figure stood there. In his hand was a huge ax.

That huge ax was two meters long. At this moment, this huge ax was slowly swinging downwards.

The process of swinging the huge ax shocked everyone present, “This ax…”

Jian Wushuang also looked at the ax in astonishment.

He could sense an extremely terrifying power from this ax. Most importantly, he also sensed the power of the destruction and space-time laws.

“This ax technique contains both the principles of destruction and the principles of spacetime?”

“Two principles at the same time? How is this possible?”

“The principles are fused?”

Everyone was stunned.

Even Thunder God and Wan Xuan were trembling. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

One had to know that this terrifying ax was aimed at them.

“Be careful!” Thunder God let out a shrill cry, and endless thunderbolts covered his body.

Wan Xuan’s aura also soared. The two of them were going all out at this moment.

However, when that ax was swung down…everywhere it passed, it was as easy as crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood!

When the ax shadow missed, everything fell into silence.

Boom! Boom!

Two extremely miserable figures shot out from the center of the battlefield like cannonballs.

These two people were surprisingly the thunder god and Wan Xuan, who was fighting against Di Hao. However, at this moment, both of their bodies were trembling slightly. During the collision just now, one of their divine bodies had collapsed by nearly forty percent! The other had collapsed by nearly seventy percent!

After all, this was the battle between the two of them when they joined hands to resist that ax. In the end, their divine bodies had collapsed by so much. If they were to face that ax alone, their divine bodies would probably completely collapse.

“Di Hao!” Thunder God’s eyes flickered with a fierce light, and his heart was also in a state of extreme shock.

However, suddenly…the figure of Di Hao, who had used an earth-shaking ax attack and sent Thunder God and Wan Xuan flying at the same time, suddenly swayed and strangely appeared beside a silver-haired old man on the battlefield, the huge ax in his hand also directly fell down.

“What?”

The silver-haired old man was a Peak Saint of the destruction holy region. He had been working together with others to deal with Yue Yu. Although he had noticed the battle between Di Hao and Thunder God, he did not dare to get involved, but he never thought that Di Hao would take the initiative to find him.

Boom!

Although the mighty ax was not as terrifying as the earth-shaking ax, its power was strong enough to make a Peak Saint despair.

At the very least, the silver-haired old man did not have the ability to resist.

Bang!

With a loud sound, the silver-haired old man’s divine body instantly collapsed. Moreover, the giant ax contained a vast destructive power, which instantly destroyed more than half of the silver-haired old man’s divine power..
