Chapter 2156 Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground

Jian Wushuang had lived within the Three Emperors World for a period of time and he knew the names of notorious experts and forbidden grounds.Jian Wushuang had heard of the Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground.

The Three Emperors ground had eight danger areas, four Grounds of Despair, and one forbidden ground.

Aside from the 8 danger areas, anyone under the Chaotic Realm who entered the four Grounds of Despair would definitely die in them.

The chances of survival were low even for experts in the early and middle stage Chaotic Realm who went in and explored such areas. There were experts in peak Chaotic Realm and great emperors who died when they were exploring the depth of these places.

These places were notorious within the Three Emperors World.

However, there was one place far more dangerous and deadly than the rest. It was the one and only forbidden ground.

It was the Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground!

No matter who entered it, the chances of survival were extremely low. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Everyone in the Three Emperor World thinks that the Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground is the most dangerous place of all. Over the ages, not many have dared to enter to explore. Now you’re telling me that the experts from the Three Emperors World are hiding inside there?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

That was the most dangerous place in all of the Three Emperors World. Even great emperors found it difficult to leave that place alive, or even unharmed.

It might have been too difficult for the experts to hide there.

“We cannot know for sure. However, our experts realised there were many experts from the Three Emperors World appearing near the Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground. Some of them were even seen going inside of the forbidden ground, hence we deduced that there is a high possibility than the experts from the Three Emperors World are hiding inside there.” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

“This is one of the possibilities. It is also possible that the experts from the Three Emperors World revealed where they were on purpose in order to lure our army into the Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground. No one knows for sure what is inside that place. What if the place is really as dangerous as the legend says? It will not be wise if our forces are injured in the process.” Emperor Bai continued.

“This is why it is not wise for our army to enter the forbidden ground right away. The best course of action is for someone to scout the forbidden ground and see if the experts from the Three Emperors World are really in there, or if the experts from the Three Emperors World are simply luring us into danger.”

“There must be a reason why the Ancient Forbidden Ground is called the most dangerous place in this world. We should not be complacent. If we ask an almighty to venture inside to scout, it will be equal to suicide as he will die before he can get any useful intel. Hence, we must send a powerful great emperor as a scout.”

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

Jian Wushuang understood where Emperor Bai and Ancestor Tian Chen were coming from.

There were signs of experts from the Three Emperors World in the forbidden ground. Someone had to go and scout, but that someone needed to be powerful.

The most suitable great emperor from the Eternal Chaotic World to do this job would be Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang. Only you and I are at the power level of a stage three great emperor from the Eternal Chaotic World. I have to stay alert here in case of any accidents and hence cannot go to scout personally. Hence, I will have to trouble you to do this for me.” Emperor Bai smiled.

“Both of us are inverse cultivators. We know clearly how difficult it is to kill inverse cultivators. Combined with your current fighting power, your life will not be in danger within the forbidden grounds. If you find the experts from the Three Emperors World, you will be able fend them off for a period of time and request help. The army will charge in at a moment’s notice.” Emperor Bai said.

Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

He understood that if an ordinary great emperor went to scout the forbidden ground, he would not have time to do any scouting as he would be too busy trying to stay alive.

Hence, the safest and most appropriate person to go would be Jian Wushuang.

His ability to survive was far greater than the rest’s and he could fend off multiple enemies for a short period of time until Emperor Bai arrived with the army.

“I will ask Jiu Qiao to go with you just in case any accidents happen. His doppelg?nger can ensure there will be no problems in transmitting any messages.” Emperor Bai said.

“If that is the case, I shall leave now.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Go then. All the best.” Emperor Bai waved his hands.

Jian Wushuang went to look for Emperor Jiu Qiao immediately after he left the palace.

“Emperor Jiu Qiao.” Jian Wushuang called out as he approached him.

“Sword Emperor.” Emperor Jiu Qiao greeted him in return.

Jian Wushuang had power only second to Emperor Bai in the Eternal Chaotic World.

During many situations, Jian Wushuang had proved to be vital in turning things around.

For example, during the ambush on the Imperial Palace, Jian Wushuang had contributed greatly to making that a huge success.

This was exactly why Jian Wushuang was becoming more and more respected in the Eternal Chaotic World. Even ordinary great emperors respected him greatly.

“Have you received any message from Emperor Bai?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I just received one and I was about to look for you. I did not expect that you would find me first.” Emperor Jiu Qiao smiled.

“If that’s the case, lets go. Furthermore, I have to do something that will be unjust to you. I hope you understand.” Jian Wushuang continued.

“I understand.” Emperor Jiu Qiao was not surprised by this.

Even though he was a great emperor, he was an ordinary stage one great emperor.

There were many dangers within the Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground. He would only become a burden given his fighting power. The best thing was for him to stay within the Blood Mountain Sword and contact Emperor Bai via his doppelg?nger.

Jian Wushuang then suppressed Emperor Jiu Qiao into his Blood Mountain Sword.

They then headed for the Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground immediately.

The Three Emperors World had twelve provinces. The Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground was located at the intersection of two such provinces.

The forbidden grounds occupied such a big area that it resembled a mini domain.

Jian Wushuang reached the outskirts of the forbidden grounds.

“This is the Ancient Blood Forbidden Grounds?”

Jian Wushuang floated in the air as he squinted his eyes and looked down on the domain below. It was covered in a blood-red mist.

Even he felt threatened just by looking at the forbidden grounds. One could only imagine how dangerous it actually was.

Furthermore, the spacetime around the forbidden grounds was unique.

“I will not be able to transmit any messages from within the forbidden grounds. Luckily, I brought along Emperor Jiu Qiao.” Jian Wushuang muttered.

He then stepped into the Ancient Blood Forbidden Grounds without any hesitation.
