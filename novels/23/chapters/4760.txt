4761 Lady Yin Ling

This small Celestial Prefecture was located in the center of the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture, and there were tens of thousands of immortal mansions and exquisite buildings.

Prince Mo was in a heavenly hall in this small Celestial Prefecture.

The Golden crows that controlled the light and darkness of the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture were locked in a golden cage on the Fusang Tree for the master of the Heavenly Palace to see and control.

Tens of thousands of cranes flew and rested in the clouds. From time to time, they turned into Immortal spirits and lay in the clouds, casting curious looks at Jian Wushuang and the others.

After stepping into the small Celestial Prefecture, Jian Wushuang saw the vast Heavenly Palace next to the Fusang Tree.

The three figures stepped on the bluestone path and approached the heavenly hall.

The sun was setting, and it was almost night in the Celestial Prefecture.

As he ascended, he stepped on the tens of thousands of immortal residences and jade palaces. The majestic Heavenly Palace at the peak of the mountain gradually became clear.

Jian Wushuang, Chen Qing, and Chun Qiu looked at each other as they landed on the Heavenly Palace. Then, they lowered their heads and entered the Heavenly Palace.

As the clouds drifted and the wind blew, ethereal music could be heard coming from the heavenly hall. From time to time, more than ten maids dressed in silk clothes would walk along the jade corridor with silver plates in their hands.

In the vast lotus ponds on both sides of the heavenly hall, there were koi children who had attained Dao. They were lying between the lotus petals and playing in the water out of boredom.

As soon as they saw a few new faces, they hurriedly stepped on the clouds and moved over.

“Go away, all of you go away. The uncles are doing serious business. We’ll play with you later,” Cheng Qing waved his arms and kept driving away the koi children who were surrounding him.

Perhaps these little guys were too bored in the lotus pond. After hearing Cheng Qing’s words, not only did they not retreat, but they also giggled and all laid on his body to interact.

In order to prevent any more trouble, Jian Wushuang and Chun Qiu had to help pick up the little guys from Cheng Qing and throw them into the lotus pond one by one. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

At this moment, an illusory yet sullen voice suddenly rang out in the hall.

“I say, you three big idiots, is this how you treat those little ones? Do you know that they are my children?”

Jian Wushuang’s body stiffened and he subconsciously looked at the source of the sound.

He saw a figure in a gauze dress standing on the roof of the heavenly hall, looking at him with a faint smile.

Her two jade-like legs drooped in the air through the gauze, as if they were covered by a layer of faint moonlight. As her pair of delicate feet swayed in the air, the silver bells on her ankles gave out an extremely clear and crisp sound.

A gust of wind blew past and lifted her veil, revealing a beautiful face.

Immediately after, the koi children that had been thrown into the Lotus pond all transformed back into their original forms and floated toward the mysterious and beautiful woman.

The figure stood up and stepped on the colorful glass with her bare feet. Koi fish swam around her in the wind.

Looking at the beautiful scene where the Fairy Qi was about to reach the critical point, Jian Wushuang’s eyes became more vigilant.

He subconsciously reached for his waist, only to realize that his Tarot Divine Sword had been destroyed by Ding Beichun in the Heavenly Court’s Sword Heaven.

“Hey, I’m asking you guys a question, you three big idiots.”

She pushed aside the Immortal cloud in front of her and looked at the three of them with her almond-shaped eyes. Finally, her gaze fell on Jian Wushuang’s face.

“Brother Jian, what’s our next step? We won’t be exposed, right?” Chun Qiu lowered his head, feeling a little anxious.

“We definitely won’t be exposed. How big of a wave can a sissy cause?” Cheng Qing said in a low voice. “Brother Jian, in my opinion, let’s ignore her. Let’s just charge in.”

Jian Wushuang then spoke in a respectful tone, “Immortal, we three brothers have just joined the heavenly hall and are being unreasonable. If we offend you, please forgive us.”

The woman standing on the eave of the heavenly hall flew down with the wind and landed in front of Jian Wushuang. The veil around her body surged.

Jian Wushuang pulled away without a trace.

“So it’s your first time on duty. I was wondering when you stupid fellows appeared in the Heavenly Palace.” An angry voice came out from under the veil.

“But this is not an excuse. You just bullied my children, and now I punish you all to jump into the lotus pond and swim one round.”

Chun Qiu and Chen Qing looked at each other, their expressions troubled.

Jian Wushuang replied, “I’m afraid that’s a little inappropriate. It’s our first time on duty, and it’s not good to wear wet clothes…”

When the veiled woman heard this, she wanted to say something, but a call rang out.

“My Lady, the Young Master is calling for you,” a maidservant stood in front of the heavenly hall and said respectfully.

The lady did not answer. Instead, she looked at Jian Wushuang and the other two and said, “You’re lucky. I’ll let you off this time.”

After she finished speaking, she ran towards the heavenly hall with her bare feet.

After she had gone far away, Chen Qing said angrily, “If we weren’t in Prince Mo’s territory, I would have let that woman know what cruelty is!”

Jian Wushuang did not say anything. He looked around the heavenly hall and was about to explore the next step.

The woman who had disappeared quietly reappeared under the corridor pillar.

“What are you all standing there for? Come in with me,” she said indifferently, her tone unquestionable.

The three of them looked at each other before entering the heavenly hall together.

The palace door slowly opened, and a warm fragrance hit his face.

In the center of the magnificent Heavenly Palace, a huge incense burner was slowly blowing out smoke.

There were 18 giant pillars on both sides that depicted the mountains and seas, and there were seats beside each giant pillar for the banquet.

At the same time, there were hundreds of female dancers dancing in the clouds and smoke, it was an extravagant scene.

After the veiled woman stepped into the giant hall with her bare feet, she stepped on the flowing clouds on the ground and ran around as she pleased like an immortal spirit that grew freely between the heaven and earth.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes locked onto the deepest part of the heavenly hall at once.

Over there, the Fifth Prince, Prince Mo, who was dressed in luxurious clothes, was sitting at the head of the table. He was enjoying the dance of the female dancers with a drunken look.

It was only when he saw the veiled woman, who was as light as a celestial deer, approaching that he stood up unconsciously and said happily, “Yin Ling, you’re here.”

The maids on both sides brought over a set of luxurious clothes and helped her change.

“It’s the same old style every day, I’m sick of looking at it.” The veiled woman, Yin Ling, who was wrapped in a white fur coat, sat beside Prince Mo and pouted.

Prince Mo seemed to be excited and a little nervous about Yin Ling’s arrival. “Okay, okay, I won’t watch it anymore. I’ll watch the competition later.”

After saying that, Prince Mo turned around and waved his hand impatiently. The dancers then left.

A moment later, another 20 handsome young men with red lips and white teeth slowly walked to the center of the hall.

“Brother Jian, have you ever heard that Prince Mo is lustful?”

“…”

Jian Wushuang was confused as he looked at Chen Qing’s mysterious expression.
