Chapter 4063: The Bounty Was Gone

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the Nine Emperor Pavilion in the Nine Luminaries Galaxy.

“Hello, Blood Sword. I’m Feixue, one of the supervisors of the Nine Emperor Pavilion in the Nine Luminaries Galaxy.” A graceful and beautiful woman stood in front of Jian Wushuang with a gentle smile.

Although Jian Wushuang was only a third-level Ruler, he was ranked on the Nine Emperor List. No matter which Galaxy he went to, the supervisor would receive him personally.

“Supervisor Feixue, I need the treasures on this list.” Jian Wushuang took out the list of treasures he had prepared a long time ago.

This list of treasures was naturally the list of treasures needed to cultivate the fourth level of the Supreme-level undying celestial body.

The beautiful woman Feixue took the list and glanced at it briefly, she nodded slightly. “Blood Sword, my friend, the treasures you want are all available in the Nine Luminaries Star Field. If you need them now, I can try my best to send them all to you within ten days. However, the treasures on this list are extraordinary. I estimated that they are about 8,300 universe origin stones. But you are a friend of the Nine Emperor Pavilion, so you only need 8,000 universe origin stones.”

“Within ten days?” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

In the past, the Purple Micro Galaxy was only a medium-sized Star Field. It would take the manager of the Purple Micro Galaxy, Ballmer, thousands of years to collect all these treasures. However, in the Nine Luminaries Great Star Field, it only took ten days to collect them.

From this, it could be seen that there was a huge gap between a large Star Field and a medium-sized Star Field.

“This is 8,000 universe origin stones.” Jian Wushuang took out an interspatial ring.

There were indeed 8,000 universe origin stones in the interspatial ring. They were accumulated by Jian Wushuang after killing Thunder Star Lord in the Purple Micro Galaxy and countless star pirate experts in the past 100,000 years.

In terms of wealth, Jian Wushuang’s current wealth was not inferior to those of ordinary Ultimate Rulers. Even if he took out 8,000 universe origin stones now, he still had all kinds of treasures worth thousands of universe origin stones, this did not include the 1,000 universe origin stones and a drop of special venom that he got from Nine Whiskers.

“Don’t worry, Blood Sword. I will personally deliver the treasures on this list to you within ten days,” Feixue said with a smile.

“Supervisor Feixue, apart from these treasures, I also want to ask you about something,” Jian Wushuang said.

“You are on the Nine Emperor List, so you are qualified to receive the information in the Nine Emperor Pavilion. As long as it’s within my jurisdiction, I can answer whatever you ask,” Feixue said with a smile.

“I want to ask about the bounty issued by the Thunder God Palace more than 100,000 years ago,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Bounty?” Feixue was stunned, but she immediately reacted. “You mean the Thunder God Palace paid a great price to reward Xuan Yi?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded, “I want to know what’s going on with this bounty.”

“Blood Sword, I know about this bounty. After all, when the Thunder God Palace issued this bounty, because the price was very high, just by providing the information and location of the other party, you could get a reward of 100 origin stones. If you captured or killed the other party, you could get a middle-grade principle treasure and 500 universe origin stones. Such a high bounty caused a great sensation in the Nine Luminaries Great Star Field. Many fourth-level and fifth-level Rulers were moved by it.”

“But as far as I know, although this bounty has caused a lot of commotion and many experts have paid attention to it, I haven’t heard of anyone who has received the bounty on this bounty,” Feixue said.

“No one has received the bounty?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

No one had received the bounty, which meant that no one had found the location of his Ruler.

“In other words, the person on the bounty should still be alive,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Not necessarily.” Feixue shook her head and said, “Blood Sword, I’m afraid you don’t know that more than 3,000 years ago, the Thunder God Palace suddenly revoked the bounty.”

“Revoked?” Jian Wushuang was stunned. “Why did they revoke it?”

“Well…” Feixue paused for a moment, then she continued, “Under normal circumstances, an Ruler force like Thunder God Palace in the Nine Luminaries Galaxy would not give up so easily since they had decided to reward the other party. But now, they suddenly revoked the bounty. There are only two possibilities.”

“One is that they knew that the other party had long fled outside the Nine Luminaries Galaxy, or even fled to a territory far away from it. Thunder God Palace is the absolute Ruler in the Nine Luminaries Galaxy, but its force can not touch some distant territories. Naturally, they could not do anything to the other party, so they withdrew the bounty.”

“The other possibility is that the person has been found by the people of the Thunder God Palace and killed. Since he is dead, there is no need for the bounty to exist.”

Jian Wushuang’s face turned ugly when he heard Feixue’s words.

He knew that Feixue was telling the truth. There were only two possibilities for the Thunder God Palace to suddenly revoke the bounty.

It would have been fine if it was the first, but if it was the second…Jian Wushuang clenched his hands tightly, his eyes turning extremely cold.

“The intelligence ability of the Nine Emperor Pavilion is amazing. Is there any way to confirm which one it is for me?” Jian Wushuang looked at Feixue and asked.

“I’m afraid it won’t be easy.” Feixue shook her head. “Blood Sword, as far as I know, the conflict between Xuan Yi and the Thunder God Palace is very intense. It can be said that the entire Thunder God Palace is furious. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have made such a big fuss. At first, it was very big, but later, when the Thunder God Palace withdrew the bounty, they kept a very low profile. It didn’t even cause much of a stir in the Nine Luminaries Star Field. The Thunder God Palace never mentioned the bounty to the outside world again.”

“The Nine Emperor Pavilion knows that you take this bounty very seriously. We’ve asked around, but we haven’t received any reply. If I’m not wrong, the highest level of the Thunder God Palace must have issued a gag order.”

“Gag order?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

Even the Nine Emperor Pavilion, which was so influential, could not get any information from the Thunder God Palace. It seemed that only the experts at the highest level of the Thunder God Palace knew the final result of the bounty, even many experts at the highest level might not know about it.

“Little friend Blood Sword, if you really want to understand the result of this matter, you can only personally look for those experts at the highest level of the Thunder God Palace. My Nine Emperor Pavilion can provide you with a list of the experts at the highest level of the Thunder God Palace. As for who little friend will look for, it will be up to you to decide.” Feixue smiled.
