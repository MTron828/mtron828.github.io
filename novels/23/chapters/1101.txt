Chapter 1102: Aren’t Welcome

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In no time at all, Jian Wushuang, who was clad in a scarlet robe and carrying a longsword on his back, had appeared in front of the two men.

“So, it’s Celestial Master Meng Long and Celestial Master Yi,” he said, cupping his hands together toward them.

“An Eternal Realm expert?”

The black-clad Celestial Master Meng Long and Celestial Master Yi, the hunchbacked elder, looked strangely at Jian Wushuang.

“If I’m not mistaken, you must be Jian Wushuang who just joined the Green Fire Palace, right?” asked Celestial Master Yi.

“That’s me,” said Jian Wushuang, smiling slightly.

“Even though I’ve been wandering around this battlefield all these years, I’ve not returned back to the Palace for a long time now. A good friend there mentioned you when he communicated to me, however. It’s said that you’re the son of Nan?” Celestial Master Yi asked, his tone slightly cold.

Jian Wushuang was stunned for a while before nodding slightly.

“Humph, when your father was at the Green Fire Palace, he acted somewhat arrogantly. To think that you’re even more unrestrained than he was. You’re just but an Eternal Realm expert that got to possess the battle strength of a medium Celestial Master due to some extraordinary reasons. Even so, there are countless dangers in this battlefield that can kill you, yet you travel alone? Furthermore, you’ve even ventured so deeply into uncharted territory?” Celestial Master Yi said in a low, deep voice.

Celestial Master Meng Long, who was standing beside him, looked at Jian Wushuang with a frown as well.

One had to understand that the two Celestial Masters had ventured into this part of the battlefield together even though they were amongst the strongest of the medium Celestial Masters; they were also of advanced age and had possessed many life-saving skills.

Most of the medium Celestial Masters of the Green Fire Palace dared not venture into this uncharted part of the battlefield alone.

Take Celestial Master Silver Moon for example; even though she traveled alone, she only wandered around known territory. It was supposed to be a low-risk zone, yet she met with danger and was killed by experts from the Jin Kingdom.

So, for Jian Wushuang… to venture alone into uncharted territory, and go deep into the area to boot, was an act no different to courting his own death in the eyes of the two Celestial Masters. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Jian Wushuang did not know how to react to Celestial Master Yi’s questions; he felt they were both funny and annoying. Even so, he thought he should reply. “I dare to venture alone into this uncharted area because I have support, you two kind Sirs.”

“Support? What support? You’re way too arrogant, young man. You don’t know how dangerous this battlefield can be. You’ll regret once you encounter these dangers yourself,” Celestial Master Yi said in a tone that sounded as if he was reprimanding Jian Wushuang.

“Fine, since he wants to court his own death, there’s nothing we can say to change his mind,” Celestial Master Meng Long spoke up as well in a cold tone. “Jian Wushuang, if you don’t have anything much, leave us. Also, let me remind you. You should quickly return back to the Green Fire Palace before you get into a really dangerous situation. Come back when you’ve become a Dao Master.”

Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly as he heard the Celestial Master’s comments. “Since that’s the case, I shall take my leave.”

He immediately turned and left after speaking.

The Celestial Masters did not pay much attention to Jian Wushuang, and they casually walked toward the hill made of purple gems after he left.

After a short while, however…

“Roar!”

An angry roar accompanied by an alarming level of murderous aura rose up from the depths of the hill. Soon, two figures were also scampering out of the same spot.

They were obviously Celestial Master Yi and Celestial Master Meng Long.

“Quick, quickly run!” Celestial Master Yi shouted.

In an instant, both of them fled as fast as they could toward the Void in front of them.

Just as they dashed out from underneath the mountain, a weirdly shaped Exotic Beast made up entirely of purple gems emerged. Lightning crackled along its purple scales, and the killing intent it emanated engulfed the entire area. It immediately went after the two Celestial Masters with alarming speed.

Jian Wushuang was traversing absent-mindedly in the Void above the battlefield.

“How does it feel to be turned away, kid?” Gu King teased.

“I had just wanted to exchange greetings. Who would have expected them to not welcome me?” Jian Wushuang replied, a weird expression on his face.

“Because of your mother, I’m afraid only a few of the experts in the Green Fire Palace will choose not to ignore you. If you wish to earn their respect, you have to prove your strength to them. Let them believe in your potential. As for now, you haven’t achieved that,” said Gu King, laughing.

“I know that,” replied Jian Wushuang with a bitter laugh.

Suddenly…

“Hmm, what’s going on?”

Jian Wushuang took out his token again, and through it, he could clearly sense that Celestial Master Yi and Celestial Master Meng Long were coming in his direction with alarming speed. The distance between them kept diminishing.

“Such speed… this is an uncharted territory after all, and even I do not dare to travel too quickly. They don’t seem to be traversing. Could it be that they’re fleeing?”?Jian Wushuang thought.

He stopped immediately and turned, rushing toward the two Celestial Masters.

Soon, he saw what was happening.

He could see the Celestial Masters fleeing for their lives, and a ferocious Exotic Beast covered entirely with purple scales was chasing after them.

The Exotic Beast was giving off an extremely high amount of murderous aura, giving Jian Wushuang the chills.

“What’s that?” Jian Wushuang asked as he frowned.

“It’s a Beast Puppet,” replied Gu King.

“Beast Puppet?” Jian Wushuang asked, momentarily stunned. He had only heard of Puppet Fighters, not Beast Puppets before.

“They are puppets made by experts from the Eternal Chaotic World by directly refining Exotic Beasts. Even though they are puppets, they’ve retained their original consciousnesses. The Beast Puppet you see most likely even has the battle strength of an Exceptional Realm Celestial Master,” Gu King explained.

“Is that so? No wonder the two Celestial Masters are fleeing,” said Jian Wushuang as he finally knew what the beast exactly was.

Celestial Master Yi and Celestial Master Meng Long could be considered as extremely strong amongst their peers, and they could have handled one or two ordinary advanced Celestial Masters; they would definitely not be fleeing in such a sorry fashion.

They were, however, no match at all for this Beast Puppet, even if they joined forces.

“The Beast Puppet possesses amazing speed and should be catching up with them anytime now,” Jian Wushuang said, his face stern. In the next instant, the Blood Mountain Sword had appeared in his hand, and his figure immediately dashed forward.

“Oh no, oh no!”

The faces of Celestial Master Yi and Celestial Master Meng Long were looking very terrible at the moment. The former was even covered with blood and his aura was weak. Evidently, he was seriously wounded and neither of them could have possibly survived if the Beast Puppet caught up with them.

Just at this moment, they noticed that Jian Wushuang’s figure was charging directly toward them from the Void in front of them.
