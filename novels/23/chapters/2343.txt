Chapter 2344: Jian Wushuang Isn’t Ordinary

Even Jian Wushuang was a little surprised.

However, he laughed it off. “Fire Fairy, if I’m not wrong, you aren’t within the highest level in the Thunder Sound Sect and don’t have any decision rights. Could you really make the decision for the sect leader of Thunder Sound Sect to guide me personally and ensure I will become the new sect leader in the future?”

“Of course I can.”

Fire Fairy stood up immediately and said solemnly, “As long as you are willing to return to Thunder Sound Sect with me, you’ll get whatever I’ve offered. In fact, it won’t just end here. If you have any other requests, our Thunder Sound Sect will also try to fulfill them. For example, if you are furious about Xiang Family and Zhuge Family, you could request our Thunder Sound Sect to annihilate the two families. At that time, even if it meant going against the pact we have with other sects, we would still do it.”

What Fire Fairy was saying had not received the authorization from the highest level in the Thunder Sound Sect.

Nonetheless, she wasn’t worried she had over-promised.

This was because she knew Thunder Sound Sect would see Jian Wushuang’s talents and agree to do what was necessary.

An ordinary talent or even an ordinary demon-like talent wouldn’t be qualified to enjoy such privileges.

However, Jian Wushuang would definitely be worth it.

Hmm... Jian Wushuang was a little surprised. However, he still shook his head and said, “I’m sorry. I have no intention of joining any sect at this moment. Therefore, I regret to say I can’t take you up on your good will.”

Hearing this, Fire Fairy couldn’t help but be a little disappointed. However, she still forced a smile out and said, “It’s alright. However, I hope you will consider this again. As long as you are willing to return to Thunder Sound Sect with me, I can guarantee that we definitely won’t mistreat you.”

“Yeah, I will think about it.” Jian Wushuang was just paying lip service.

This was also clear to the crowd who knew he had no intention of joining Thunder Sound Sect at all.

Even if the largest sect in the Wusha Barren Region offered him the same terms, he wouldn’t be moved, let alone Thunder Sound Sect.

For him, the Wusha Barren Region was just too minute.

In the hall, the group continued discussing things for a while before living.

At night, Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin were lying in bed. Both of them were still talking about the battle that had happened earlier in the day. Zhuo Yunfeng told Luo Xinqin about Jian Wushuang’s performance in the battlefield, including how Jian Wushuang killed Zhuo Yunfeng, how he had killed another Divine Demon Realm expert and severely injured another after he had been cornered by three of them.

Luo Xinqin was totally engrossed in the story until Zhuo Yunfeng from beginning to end.

“Shuang killed two Divine Demons when he’s just an Early Stage Chaotic Realm? And he massacred a large number of Half Step Divine Demons and Peak Chaotic Realm experts? Now I understand why those people were looking at Shuang differently today,” Luo Xinqin mumbled to herself.

She was meticulous and hadn’t missed the gazes that others had cast at Jian Wushuang.

“Yeah. Taoist Priest Xuan Shen is right. Shuang is truly unparalleled in this world. Among all the talents I know, I have never seen anyone as incredible as our son,” Zhuo Yunfeng said with a bright smile. Clearly, he was overjoyed with his son’s performance.

“Husband, I don’t think Shuang is that simple,” Luo Xinqin said seriously.

“He isn’t that simple? What do you mean?” Zhuo Yunfeng asked.

“Don’t you think that our Shuang isn’t that ordinary? Or rather, he’s a little too demon-like?” Luo Xinqin asked.

“A little too amazing?” Zhuo Yunfeng was astounded.

“Although I have never reached the Chaotic Divine Demon Realm and have never gotten into contact with one, I know clearly the impossibly huge difference in strength between a Chaotic Divine Demon and a Chaotic Realm. If Shuang was a Peak Chaotic Realm and successfully defeated or even killed a Chaotic Divine Demon, who is just one level higher, I could still understand. However, Shuang is just an Early Stage Chaotic Realm. It’s unbelievable.”

“Perhaps our Shuang is unique. I carried him for nine years, nine months and nine days before he was born. Moreover, a divine sword descended from the sky at his birth. You could say there’s never been such an incident before. Even so, it’s unlikely he could be challenging all our senses of normality!”

“Furthermore, just as you have mentioned, our Shuang’s understanding of Sword Principle isn’t simple. In fact, he has even reached Great Achievement. Moreover, his understanding in Rules of Order is unusually high and he has even grasped two Rules of Order. Think about it. Isn’t it strange?”

“You know how old Shuang is! No matter how incredible he is, how could he grasp Rules of Order to this extent that he’d already be so well-versed in Sword Principle?” asked Luo Xinqin.

“When you put it like that, it is indeed a little strange. If Shuang’s rapid advancement in cultivation base could be explained by his talents, and his understanding of Sword Principle could be explained by the divine sword that descended at his birth, his grasp of the Rules of Order is overly high. I heard from Brother Lin previously that Shuang’s understanding of the Rules of Order is even greater than the majority of Second Grade Divine Demons’!” Zhuo Yunfeng furrowed his brows.

“Moreover, don’t you think our Shuang has always been obedient and sensible since he was born? In fact, I would even say he’s overly sensible,” Luo Xinqin continued.

“That’s true as well. Other than his constant refusal and stubbornness to not join other sects, he’s been extremely obedient. Since he was very young, I have hardly scolded him. He’s also a little more knowledgeable than kids of other families.” Zhuo Yunfeng nodded as he spoke. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“He’s also way more mature than cultivators of his age. In fact, even you aren’t a match for him,” Luo Xinqin added.

“What?” This time, Zhuo Yunfeng was truly astounded.

Even I’m not a match?

How can that be?

“What? You aren’t willing to admit it?” Luo Xinqin chuckled. “You said it yourself. Shuang went on a killing spree today and didn’t just kill two Chaotic Divine Demons. He also killed a large number of Half Step Divine Demons and Chaotic Realm experts within an extremely short period. Yet, he was exceptionally calm and composed after that. Although I don’t know what he was thinking, he wasn’t showing any signs that he was affected. Tell me! Could an ordinary nineteen-year-old be so calm after experiencing a frenzied massacre like this?”

“If it had been you, are you sure you could have kept your emotions in check after killing two Chaotic Divine Demons?”

“This... This...” Zhuo Yunfeng was at a loss for words.

However, he had to admit Jian Wushuang had been a little too composed today.

After killing so many powerful experts, he gave off a feeling like he’d just been killing some ants!

Zhuo Yunfeng wasn’t confident in himself having this level of composure.
