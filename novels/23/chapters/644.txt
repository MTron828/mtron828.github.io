Chapter 645: Two Versus One!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Speaking of the Doppelganger Secret Skill, if the Original Body died, the doppelganger would cease to exist, but Jian Wushuang’s Original Bodies were different. If an Original Body was killed, the other Original Body would be able to remake it.

The two bodies had their own thoughts, so they were able to cultivate, kill, or scramble for treasures separately. It was more powerful than the Doppelganger Secret Skill.

“Jian Wushuang is superior to the ordinary geniuses from the Ancient World. He’s not only good at Sword Principle, but he has also mastered the Doppelganger Secret Skill... If I’m right, he must have received some amazing opportunities which a supreme expert from our Eternal World left,” the evil girl from the Boundless Demon Sect said.

“That’s possible.”

The other experts in the Skyward Pavilion nodded in agreement.

Experts from the Eternal World preferred to leave their legacy in the other plane worlds.

Without superb opportunities, it was impossible for Jian Wushuang, a Skyscraping Realm expert, to have such a high level of strength and even master the Doppelganger Secret Skill while in the Ancient World, even though he was talented.

“It’s a pity that I already promised Xuan Yi that I wouldn’t pursue the six geniuses from the Ancient World, or else... I’d like to invite the boy to be our inner disciple,” the evil girl sighed.

“What a pity!” The arrogant middle-aged man from the Immortal Dynasty nodded inwardly.

However, the black-haired elder from Cloud Sea Asgard still disagreed. “Hum, the boy is talented and might have gained a wonderful opportunity, but he still comes from the Ancient World where people don’t know how to cultivate their foundation properly. As we all know, the foundation can affect one’s potential. His foundation is weak, so he won’t have great achievements.”

Xuan Yi ignored the other experts’ discussion and fixed his eyes on Jian Wushuang.

“Doppelganger Secret Skill? Nice!” Xuan Yi thought with a flicker of delight in his eyes.?“Boy, you’ve given me even more surprises.”

The horrible booms echoed through the area.

Gong Chao had to fight with Jian Wushuang’s two bodies. Although he had a high understanding of the Thunderbolt Dao and had mastered the Yin-Yang Dao, it was slowly exhausting him.

A hint of killing intent flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

The Sword Soul suddenly shook in his sea of consciousness. Then, his Sword Soul Power increased to 80 percent.

”?80 percent of my Sword Soul Power, I can’t use more or my Strongest Sword Soul will be exposed,?” Jian Wushuang thought.

As the two Original Bodies exerted 80 percent of his Sword Soul Power, the power of his swordsmanship greatly improved.

“The boy, his Sword Soul Power has increased again?”

“How many trump cards has he been hiding?”

“A Skyscraping Realm expert can possess such a mighty Sword Soul Power?”

The experts in the Skyward Pavilion all marveled at his strength.

“As I expected,” Xuan Yi was not surprised, but he still had some doubts, “Has he reached his limit?”

The Drill Ground went dead silent as the other geniuses all watched them in shock. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang obviously became stronger just now. Streaks of sword shadows crazily suppressed Gong Chao who was consistently losing ground.

“Gong Chao has been completely suppressed?”

“Gong Chao is at a disadvantage, even though he used his Yin-Yang Dao?”

“Jian Wushuang is indeed powerful!”

His strength shook everyone.

Even Qianqiu Wuhen stared at the two duelers with a frown.

”?These two... are really powerful, but I’ll still rank first in this year’s feast,?” Qianqiu Wuhen thought with a flicker of madness in his eyes.

A scruffy green-clothed girl watched the fight with a solemn expression. “I can’t match either of them. They’re too strong.”

Boom!

A loud sound was heard from the battlefield before Jian Wushuang and Gong Chao separated.

The two Original Bodies stood in the void with a soaring aura while Gong Chao looked embarrassed.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Gong Chao held his Stone Cudgel more tightly as he stared at Jian Wushuang with a gush of killing intent in his eyes.

“I didn’t expect someone would push me to such an extent in this feast. Especially a genius from the Ancient World!

“You are powerful!

“If I encountered you one month ago, I would have been defeated by you, but over the last month... I’ve made great progress in Enlightenment Mountain, so you will lose this fight!”

Gong Chao’s confident voice reverberated through the Drill Ground.

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes slightly.

All eyes were on Gong Chao.

Everyone wondered whether Gong Chao still had other trump cards at this critical moment.

Gong Chao charged forward again.

Shua! A streak of Thunderbolt flashed across the sky and Gong Chao appeared in front of the Slaughter Body in the blink of an eye.

“So fast!” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Although Gong Chao’s offensive speed had been terrifying, Jian Wushuang had been able to handle it.

But now his speed doubled, which chilled Jian Wushuang’s blood.

Gong Chao brandished his Stone Cudgel.

The strike with terrifying Thunderbolt Power moved at an unbelievable speed, which placed unprecedented pressure on the Slaughter Body.

Jian Wushuang paled. He was unable to parry it and could barely resist it with his Triple-kill Sword.

As a result... Peng!

The mighty power knocked away the Triple-kill Sword and forced the Slaughter Body to retreat.

Whoosh!

The wind-breaking sound was heard before the World Body suddenly appeared behind Gong Chao.
