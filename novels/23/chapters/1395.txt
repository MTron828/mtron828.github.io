Chapter 1396: Eighteen Asura Hell

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Qiu Yue hesitated and then said, “Mister, you should know that Lineage of Star determines one’s position through his or her ability. The same goes for the deacon elderlies on the highest level as well as the disciples of Star Palace like yourself and the ordinary disciples. The same also applies to us, the maidservants.”

Qiu Yue briefly explained what happened.

Then, Jian Wushuang fixed his gaze, “You mean, at the very beginning, the one who was seeking trouble with you all was Luo Quan?”

“Yes, it was him.”

Qiu Yue nodded, “Luo Quan has been an ordinary disciple all the time, and the ordinary disciples in Lineage of Star didn’t have any maidservants to serve them, nor could they occupy a star. Hence, not long after you went to the mystery land, Luo Quan came to Sword Star and said that he needed two maidservants to head over to take care of some matters on your behalf. I weighed my options and then agreed as he only wanted two maidservants. Then, he came again and asked for ten maidservants!”

“I didn’t agree and Luo Quan raised his fists. He brought along the other few ordinary disciples to take our people. We had no choice but to say your name. Who didn’t imagine that Luo Quan wouldn’t care. He even said that after the battle started your identity as a disciple of Star Palace, including this Sword Star and we the maid and servants would all belong to him in no time. He was merely taking what would soon belong to him.

“Oh?” There was a chilly gleam in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. He sneered, “Oh yeah, among all Universe Gods in the Second Heaven in Lineage of Star, there are only five disciples of Star Palace including myself! That’s because one of the disciples of Star Palace passed through God’s Test in the Third Heaven and became a Universe God in the Third Heaven.”

The quota for five disciples of Star Palace, beside myself, the other four already proved themselves with their capabilities. Their positions couldn’t be shaken, besides me… the one who was widely recognized as a person who wasn’t up to standard. Back when I first came to Lineage of Star, Luo Qun defeated me before.”

“Everyone thought I would become an ordinary disciple after the battle to fight for the quota to become a disciple of Star Palace. On the other hand, Luo Quan is the strongest Universe God in the Second Heaven among the ordinary disciples. Naturally, my position as a disciple of Star Palace will be taken by him!”

“Humph, nicely done.”

Jian Wushuang looked cold and he glared, “Where is Luo Quan now? In the Lineage of Star?”

“No,” Qiu Yue shook her head, “Luo Quan went to one of the mystery lands two hundred years ago. Because he went to a mystery land, we returned to Sword Star. But it wasn’t long until Bai Lipeng forced us to work on Tai Yuan Star.”

“To mystery land?” Jian Wushuang shook his head in silence and commanded, “Qiu Yue, I won’t be on Sword Star for some time. When I’m not here, try not to leave Sword Star. When people come asking for trouble, if it isn’t too ridiculous, hold back if you could. Wait till the battle ends and we will take care of it.

“Yes,” Qiu Yue nodded politely.

“Alright, you’re dismissed,” Jian Wushuang waved and Qiu Yue left with the other maids and servants.

In the hall, Jian Wushuang sat alone.

“Qiu Yue even apologized to me and said that it was all her fault. In actual fact, I was the main reason that all of this happened,” Jian Wushuang laughed at himself.

The real reason why the maids and servants were bullied was actually because of him as an owner.

If the owner were to be powerful and those disciples revered him, naturally no one would dare to seek trouble with them.

But the crucial point was that the disciples in Lineage of Star, including the ordinary disciples, didn’t look up to him. Naturally, they looked down upon his maids and servants.

To make people afraid of acting impetuously, he could only rely on his power!

“The battle is a platform to showcase my power. Only by defeating those ordinary disciples like Luo Quan and Qu Yang during the fight, or even defeating the other four disciples of Star Palace, will the people of Lineage of Star recognize my identity as a disciple of Star Palace.”

“Battle!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists tightly.

This battle was extremely meaningful to him.

Then, Jian Wushuang didn’t opt to wander in another mystery land, nor did he go to cultivation places like Reset Palace or Shrine of Myriad Swords.

He stayed back in Sword Star and started cultivating in seclusion.

Jian Wushuang only had one goal to cultivate in seclusion, which was to obtain the secret skill of consciousness attack from Bei Xiu… Eighteen Asura Hell!

Eighteen Asura Hell was the expert on the Real Gods list and the user of Real God Demonic Rain’s strongest technique. Even Hall Palace Yuan was impressed with her technique. Of course, Jian Wushuang was dying to master the technique.

Eighteen Asura Hell was a phantasmagoria secret skill.

“Eighteen Asura Hell is segregated into eighteen levels of dreamlands.” Jian Wushuang was shocked. But at the same time, he understood that when he was fighting with Bei Xiu, the strongest technique that he had pulled, in the end, was this.

However, Bei Xiu had just mastered the technique and he had merely performed the first three levels.

Most importantly, the three dreamlands performed with Bei Xiu’s consciousness was nothing to Jian Wushuang who had already lit up Soul Power.

However, if the same technique were to be performed by Jian Wushuang, who had lit his Soul Power, it would be several times scarier.

Of course, Jian Wushuang had to first grasp the technique.

“Eighteen levels of dreamlands, the first three levels are barely beginner level. During the first six levels, one will still be at the initial success stage. Then, the twelfth level would be the great achievement stage. Finally, the eighteenth level would be considered as the complete satisfactory level. Bei Xiu was only at the beginner stage of the secret skill?” Jian Wushuang sneered but quickly began understanding the secret skill with his full concentration.

Eighteen level of dreamlands. He wanted to grasp level by level and try to perform them.

First, he must understand that the first level of the eighteen levels of dreamland was Hell of Tongue Removal!

That level of dreamland was the easiest. Plus, Jian Wushuang had already lit up his Soul Power. It was much easier to understand.

Even so, he spent a total of five years.

“Five years to understand the first level?” Jian Wushuang was not satisfied, but he had no choice as he had tried his best.

However, if the dead Bei Xiu were to know about it, he would definitely be jealous and go mad.

After all, the moment he got the secret skill from his mother, he had been trying to understand. Just for the first level of understanding, he had spent a hundred and fifty years!

On the second level of dreamland, he had used a total of six hundred years. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The third level of dreamland was the longest. He had spent a total of a thousand eight hundred years.

However, Jian Wushuang grasped the first level in five years and he was still complaining that it was too slow?
