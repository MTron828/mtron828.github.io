Chapter 3536: Thunder Pool

Jian Wushuang’s expression turned cold, and a shocking destructive will suddenly rose up.

“I won’t stop until I die!”

Whoosh!

The sword was instantly slashed out.

The moment the sword was slashed out, the shocking destructive will also immediately rose to the extreme.

The destructive will, filled with hatred and endless destruction, directly covered Eight Axe Master.

Eight Axe Master had also displayed his strongest skill. The giant axe in his hand seemed to cover the void and oppress the whole area. However, the mighty shadow of the axe…after it collided with Jian Wushuang’s sword light, which was determined to die.

Clang!

With a crisp sound, Eight Axe Master’s body slightly sank. The light in the axe shadow immediately dimmed, and his move was instantly disintegrated.

However, this was only the beginning. After destroying his axe shadow, the astonishing sword skill with a terrifying destructive will came crushing toward his divine body again. A majestic power directly hit Eight Axe Master’s divine body.

Sou!

The Eight Axe Master was unable to control his godly body after being struck by this power. His entire body suddenly fell downwards like a cannonball.

One had to know that this place was in the Black Thunder Pool. The ground of the Black Thunder Pool was covered with black divine lightning. The power of those black divine lightning was extremely tyrannical. Ordinary Principles Masters would not dare to step into it.

However, because of the impact of the power, Eight Axe Master’s entire body was smashed into the Thunder Pool below. The Thunder Pool instantly surged with a large amount of black divine lightning, crazily covering Eight Axe Master like a wave.

This scene caused the surrounding Principles Masters to be shocked.

“Eight Axe Master was actually struck into the Thunder Pool?”

“Is Eight Axe Master dead?”

“This man defeated Eight Axe Master and hacked Eight Axe Master into the Thunder Pool?”

The Principles Masters widened their eyes and looked at the Thunder Pool below, exclaiming in disbelief.

However, Jian Wushuang ignored them.

After hacking Eight Axe Master into the Thunder Pool below, he withdrew his Blood Mountain Sword and performed shadowless escape art.

Eight Axe Master was still in the Thunder Pool. As soon as Jian Wushuang performed shadowless escape art, the surrounding people did not know where he was. Naturally, they could not obstruct him. He directly passed through the battlefield, he walked out of the Black Thunder Pool. At the same time, he sent a message to Heavy Master to ask them to leave.

Heavy Master, Saber Python Master, and Purple Sound Master immediately retreated. The few Principles Masters did not stop them.

In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang and the others had disappeared from everyone’s sight. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

After Jian Wushuang and the others left, the thunder pool below suddenly rumbled. Then, Eight Axe Master, who was emitting a terrifying murderous aura, struggled out of the Thunder Pool.

The Black Divine Thunder in the Black Thunder Pool was powerful and posed a great threat to ordinary Principles Masters. However, Eight Axe Master was an expert at the peak of the fifth void realm, and he was wearing armor at the level of an elementary universe supreme treasure, he could barely resist the erosion of the divine thunder.

He had been trapped in the Thunder Pool for only a moment, so his life was not in any danger. However, he had consumed a lot of divine power.

After he got out of the Thunder Pool, he immediately looked around with his ruthless eyes, but he did not see Jian Wushuang again.

“Where are they?” Eight Axe Master shouted in a low voice.

“Eight Axe Master, the people from Star Palace, including the one who fought with you, have left,” an expert of the fifth void realm said.

“Left?” Eight Axe Master’s face darkened slightly, but he could only shake his head helplessly.

Jian Wushuang had already obtained the Poluo God component, and then he fought with him and defeated him. At this point, Jian Wushuang would naturally choose to leave.

Moreover, even if Jian Wushuang had not left, what could he do?

To snatch the Poluo God component from Jian Wushuang again?

Was that possible?

Jian Wushuang had already proven his strength in the battle just now. Even if he did not use the shadowless escape art to fight him head-on, he would definitely crush him. If the Poluo God component fell into the hands of such an expert…he, Eight Axe Master, was completely helpless.

“Do you know the name of the person just now?” Eight Axe Master asked.

“I don’t know. That person is very unfamiliar. He must have just entered the Universe Battlefield not long ago, so we don’t know him. However, he is with Saber Python Master and Heavy Master. He is most likely from Star Palace,” the expert of the five void realms said.

“Oh right, I heard Heavy Master call him Blood Sword Master just now.” A void fourth level Principles Master beside him said.

“Blood Sword Master?” Eight Axe Master’s eyes narrowed slightly before he nodded. “Blood Sword Master should be his title. Furthermore, his sword techniques are strange and terrifying. When he executed his sword techniques, he left behind streaks of blood-colored sword light in the void. He indeed deserves this title.”

“Eight Axe Master, you have just fought head-on with Blood Sword Master. What do you think of his strength?” Asked the Principles Master of the fifth level of the void realm.

There were dozens of astral worlds around the three Universe Battlefields, and there were countless forces of all sizes. There were countless Great Beings, and these Great Beings were all adventuring in the three battlefields. Naturally, they had to know themselves and their enemies well.

For example, if an extremely powerful expert appeared in the three battlefields, it would not take long for everyone to know his name and information. It was because of this information, the various forces did not deliberately hide it, and most of them were willing to share it.

Their encounter with Jian Wushuang this time also showed that Jian Wushuang’s strength was extraordinary. However, only the Eight Axe Master, who had really fought with Jian Wushuang, knew what level Jian Wushuang’s strength was at. Therefore, the surrounding Principles Masters all wanted to know Jian Wushuang’s specific battle strength level from the Eight Axe Master, they all wanted to know the level of Jian Wushuang’s battle strength from the Eight Axe Master so that they could be prepared when they fought with Jian Wushuang in the future.

After a moment of silence, the Eight Axe Master spoke directly, “Blood Sword Master’s aura alone is not very strong among Principles Masters, but his battle strength is extremely terrifying. The power he possesses is not much weaker than mine and has reached the peak of the fifth void realm. However, this is not the most important thing. The most important thing is his unique skill, his sword skill!”

“His swordsmanship is too terrifying. When he fought with me, I saw that among the swordsmanship that he displayed, there were at least five sword techniques that had reached the level of a sixth-tier ultimate art. Especially that last sword technique that he displayed. If I’m not mistaken, that should already be a peak sixth-tier ultimate art!”
