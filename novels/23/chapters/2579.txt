Chapter 2580: Shi Clan’s Backing

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Master, we have never heard of the Star Picking Pavilion Golden Chief. However, we know that San Shouwang kept in touch with Star Picking Pavilion and has been trying to accumulate wealth to purchase the secret technique he has been cultivating from the Star Picking Pavilion,” said Cang Heng.

“Secret technique?” Jian Wushuang’s attention was piqued.

The Heavenly Beast Secret Technique which San Shouwang performed instantly appeared in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

The secret technique’s power which evolved a Beast King into a Heavenly Beast was indeed impressive.

The Heavenly Beast Secret Technique was probably the reason San Shouwang was accumulating wealth so that he could practice that secret technique.

“Master, although I don’t know for sure San Shouwang’s relationship with the Star Picking Pavilion or whether he really has an elder brother in the Star Picking Pavilion, I do know that all Star Picking Pavilion’s chiefs are very powerful even at their branch level. Besides being powerful, they are also generally very capable and skillful. Even the weakest among them—the Black Chief position is held by an Earth Ultimate God. As for the Golden Chief...”

Cang Heng paused for a while before solemnly saying, “The Golden Chief is generally held by Peak Earth Ultimate Gods with some even held by Heaven Ultimate Gods.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes widened when he heard that.

“Did he just say the Golden Chief is generally held by Peak Earth Ultimate Gods with some even held by Heaven Ultimate Gods?”

It would be easier to deal with if it was a Peak Earth Ultimate God. Although Jian Wushuang was unable to handle a Peak Earth Ultimate God, he would very soon be able given some time and enough primordial stone to absorb and refine. He only needed to make a breakthrough in his realm and would be able to deal with it.

The Heaven Ultimate God on the other hand... There was still quite a gap between Heaven and Earth Ultimate God.

The gap was greater than one between Earth Ultimate God and Regular Ultimate God.

If San Shouwang truly had an older brother who was the Star Picking Pavilion’s Golden Chief at the Heaven Ultimate God realm, there was no way Jian Wushuang could deal with him in a short period.

“Then again, I don’t need to be so worried. First of all, he can’t kill me even if he’s a Heaven Ultimate God. Worst scenario, I’ll just give up my position as the Territorial Lord and escape. Besides... Who knows if San Shouwang’s words were true. Perhaps, he deliberately made this story up before dying to scare me so that he could save his life.” Jian Wushuang sneered and decided not to dwell further in the matter.

Jian Wushuang again looked down inside the hall.

“There’s one more matter, I heard from San Shouwang there will be an auction in Star Picking Pavilion eleven years later. What about that?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“That’s true.”

Cang Heng answered, “The Star Picking Pavilion is the first-ranked Chamber of Commerce in the Nine Realms of Golden Crow. Their auction is always very popular and this auction which will be held in the Narcissus Territory isn’t even considered the best auction event in Danyang Holy Domain. However, it’s enough to attract regular Primary Stage Ultimate Gods and Earth Ultimate Gods. It’s a very large-scale auction since the Star Picking Pavilion released news of this long ago. I believe many Territorial Lords including some independent experts would be at the auction.

“I think it may even attract some Heaven Ultimate Gods.”

“Oh, even Heaven Ultimate Gods may attend the auction?”Jian Wushuang slightly nodded. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

According to San Shouwang, The Stately Painting belonging to Jian Wushuang would be one of the items put up for auction. However, it was uncertain if that was true.

Nonetheless, Jian Wushuang had to go and check the auction out.

“Well, there’s still quite a lot of time since it’s eleven years later,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

Suddenly, a soldier came in from outside the hall.

“Master, the clan leaders of Shi, Wu, and Situ are here. They are waiting outside the mansion,” reported the soldier respectfully.

“The three major clans?” Jian Wushuang raised his brows.

The four commanders also looked at each other before Cang Heng smiled. “These three major clans are acting quite fast. They immediately come to see you not long after you killed San Shouwang. Master, they must be here to cozy up to you.”

“Cozy up to me?” Jian Wushuang wore a strange expression. “Among the three big clans, the Situ Clan and Wu Clan are fine but the Shi Clan...”

“Master. Although the Shi Clan has offended you, perhaps Master can let them go if it’s not too serious,” suggested Cang Heng.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang glanced at Cang Heng.

Cang Heng was startled by the side glance but continued, “Master, I’m not begging for mercy on behalf of the Shi Clan. I’m not close to the Shi Clan but I’m saying this due to the Earth Ultimate God that is backing up the Shi Clan.”

Jian Wushuang nodded. “I know the Shi Clan and Wu Clan both have an Earth Ultimate God backing them up. What level of Earth Ultimate God are they?”

“I know that Shi Clan’s Earth Ultimate God had achieved the Earth Ultimate God realm a long time ago. Just not too long ago, he went back to the Shi Clan and had also visited San Shouwang in the Territorial Lord Mansion. That time, San Shouwang personally greeted him with a friendly and humble demeanor toward the Earth Ultimate God. If I’m not wrong, the Shi Clan’s Earth Ultimate God strength is higher than San Shouwang. He has likely reached the Peak Earth Ultimate God realm,” explained Cang Heng.

“As for the Wu Clan, their Earth Ultimate God isn’t that strong. He’s just a Primary Stage Earth Ultimate God whose combat power is weaker than San Shouwang but talented nonetheless and has joined a top-tier powerful force within the Danyang Holy Domain. I heard that force is so powerful it’s not afraid of the Crimson Stone Fort.”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes after consolidating the information.

The two Earth Ultimate Gods behind those two major clans are so powerful that one was at the Peak Earth Ultimate God Realm while the other joined one of the top-tier forces that aren’t inferior to the Crimson Stone Fort?

‘No wonder San Shouwang dare not do anything to these two clans.’

It turned out the two major clans had such strong backings.

“Although the Shi Clan initially wanted to kill me, they never succeeded. After that incident, they have also stopped bothering me. On the other hand, I took the initiative to enter the Shi Clan’s grounds because I wanted to kill San Shouwang. There indeed isn’t much enmity between us. Well, let’s see their attitude later. If they are behaving then I won’t bring up the past. Otherwise, they can’t blame me for being ruthless.”

Jian Wushuang smiled coldly before waving his large hand, “Let the three major clans in.”

“Yes.” The soldier immediately left.

Not long after, the three Clan Leaders walked side by side into the hall guided by the soldier and stood before Jian Wushuang.

“Pleasure to meet you, Master Jian Yi.”

The three clan leaders including Shi Qianhan bowed to Jian Wushuang as soon as they came into the hall to show respect.
