4159 A Surprise

Not far behind Jian Wushuang.

Qing Xuzi only glanced at Divine Marquis Qingfeng and Jian Wushuang when he saw them split up. He did not pursue them.

Indeed, Jian Wushuang was his only target. As for Divine Marquis Qingfeng, he didn’t care at all.

However, the smile on Qing Xuzi’s face gradually disappeared as he continued to chase Jian Wushuang. He frowned and said, “How strong is Jian Wushuang’s divine power?”

!!

Qing Xuzi’s expression turned ugly. According to his original guess, Jian Wushuang must have used some unique secret skill to increase his speed so rapidly. It should not have been easy to perform such a secret skill. At the very least, it should have consumed a lot of divine power. There was no doubt about that. Otherwise, Jian Wushuang would not have burst out with such a fast speed from the beginning. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, he had been chasing after Jian Wushuang for almost four hours and Jian Wushuang’s speed had not slowed down at all!

What kind of concept was this?

“Fine, I’d like to see how long your divine power can keep you up!” Qing Xuzi snorted, and his expression became cold again.

With the God attraction forbidden skill, he was not afraid that Jian Wushuang would escape. Therefore, he was not in a hurry.

…

In the blink of an eye, more than half a day had passed.

For such a long time, Jian Wushuang had been performing the dragon-destroying secret skill and burning his divine power. If it had been before Jian Wushuang had undergone the life baptism, he would not have been able to withstand it for so long.

However, after the life baptism, his divine body had grown to a height of 68000 miles. How vast was the divine power contained in such a huge divine body?

Even though he had been burning the dragon-destroying secret skill for more than half a day, he had used less than ten percent of his divine power.

Jian Wushuang kept moving forward. He did not know when he had arrived at the edge of the Tarot Ruins. Because it was remote, there were few Supreme treasures and opportunities. Therefore, there were almost no experts wandering here.

Just as Jian Wushuang passed by a mountain range, he stopped.

“It’s almost time.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered and his body instantly shot down and landed on the mountain range.

Stepping on the ground, Jian Wushuang raised his head and looked at the blood-red arrow that was hanging above his head.

The color of the blood-red arrow had become very faint. Based on this, Qing Xuzi should still be quite far away from him.

This was also the reason why he did not mind burning his divine power as he flew. He wanted to keep Qing Xuzi as far away from him as possible so that he would have more time to prepare.

On the mountain, Jian Wushuang took a deep breath, slowly sat down cross-legged, and closed his eyes.

Immediately after, rays of sword Qi shot out from his body and burrowed into the mountain range like an Earth Dragon.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang no longer suppressed the divine power in his body. When he was fighting with Qing Xuzi earlier, he had been controlling the strength of his divine power to be about eight thousand times that of an ordinary cultivator. However, now, it was equivalent to thirteen thousand and five hundred times that of an ordinary cultivator. He burst out his divine power to the limit.

13,500 times of divine power, along with Jian Wushuang’s understanding of sword principle and the origin of the universe, swept out madly. Then, under Jian Wushuang’s control, the sword Qi was hidden in the majestic mountain range!

After the sword Qi entered the mountain range, it was all contained and not released, as if it was quietly waiting for someone’s arrival.

Ten…a hundred…a thousand…ten thousand…

“Qing Xuzi, I hope you like the surprise I’m giving you.”

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes slightly and a faint smile appeared on his face.

…

After about an hour.

A white-robed figure stepped on the void and approached step by step.

His speed did not seem fast, but every step he took crossed a thousand miles.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re not running anymore?” Qing Xuzi stood on the mountain range with his hands behind his back. He looked down at Jian Wushuang with interest, like a cat toying with a mouse.

He was not worried that Jian Wushuang would escape, so he took his time.

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged and slowly opened his eyes after hearing Qing Xuzi’s words.

A bright light quickly flashed across his eyes.

“Qing Xuzi, there’s not much hatred between us, right? why do you keep biting me?” Jian Wushuang looked up at him and said indifferently.

“Grudge?” Qing Xuzi burst into laughter as if he had heard a funny joke.

“I, Qing Xuzi, don’t need revenge when I kill people.”

“Whoever I want to die must die.”

Qing Xuzi’s mouth was filled with a trace of pleasure and mockery.

Jian Wushuang’s expression did not change. He nodded and replied, “Alright,” he said.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re just a fourth-level Ruler. You should be proud that you can force me to this extent. If you were given more time, when you break through to the fifth stage or become an Ultimate Ruler, your fighting power might be stronger than that of the Ninth Kalpa King. Even I would have to run away if I met you by then. Unfortunately, you’re just an ant in front of me now.”

Qing Xuzi shook his head. Then, he grabbed the godly sword by his waist with his long fingers.

“Jian Wushuang, remember, this sword is called Jingchan.”

“Die in peace!”

Bang!

Qing Xuzi unsheathed his sword, and a crescent sword light instantly folded the void and slashed toward Jian Wushuang’s head.

Facing the cold sword, Jian Wushuang suddenly lowered his head and sighed.

The next moment.

He suddenly raised his head, and his eyes were filled with killing intent!

“Qing Xuzi, you’re the one who should die!”

“Sword Qi, rise!!!”

Boom!

At this moment, the sky changed color. The entire mountain range was like a landslide, and a loud rumble was heard.

The ground began to crack, the sky began to change color, and traces of cold sword intent rose.

“What?”

Qing Xuzi raised his eyebrows and a look of confusion flashed in his eyes.

“Slash!”

As Jian Wushuang shouted, the majestic mountain exploded!

Three hundred thousand rays of sword Qi shot out, covering the sky!

At this moment, the void seemed to be torn apart, and a storm of sword Qi was formed!

“What?”

Under Qing Xuzi’s shocked and furious gaze, the 300000 rays of sword Qi gathered together like a long Dragon that swallowed the sun. It hovered in the sky and blocked all the light. It roared and bit toward Qing Xuzi!

Bang!

What kind of scene was it when three hundred thousand rays of sword Qi swept across?

They were densely packed and covered the sky like ten thousand swords!

Jian Wushuang, who was standing in the middle of the three hundred thousand sword Qi, was like the sword monarch who held the power to kill!

The 300,000 rays of sword Qi were condensed by Jian Wushuang’s divine power that was 12700 times stronger. The explosion caused by it was enough to kill an Ultimate Ruler in an instant!

This was the big surprise that Jian Wushuang had prepared for Qing Xuzi!
