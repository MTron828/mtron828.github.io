Chapter 1848: Weak Point

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“These major forces couldn’t be exterminated. We shouldn’t bother with them as of now,” Jian Wushuang said.

The three Hall Masters nodded simultaneously.

“Hall Master Yuan, there’s something you’re required to do,” Jian Wushuang said. Then, he waved his hands and there were divine weapons and sets of armor that appeared in the void in front of them.

The moment the divine weapon and armor appeared, the aura that spread was extremely ferocious.

“Chaotic Divine Treasure! They are all Chaotic Divine Treasures!”

“So many Chaotic Divine Treasures?”

Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun were dumbfounded.

“Palace Master, this is…” Hall Master Yuan looked at Jian Wushuang in shock as well.

“I got these Chaotic Divine Treasures coincidentally. As for where I got it, you don’t have to know. You only need to know that I used a Chaotic Divine Treasure-level armor as the price to invite Emperor God Jiu Yin to be Lineage of Star’s guest elder on the way back and Emperor God Jiu Yin agreed. In a few thousand years’ time, he will arrive in Lineage of Star,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Emperor God Jiu Yin? He agreed to be Lineage of Star’s guest elder?”

“That’s great!”

The three Hall Masters were filled with excitement.

One should know that he was an Emperor God.

On the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, there was only a total of eighty-one Sir Gods. After Jian Wushuang’s massacre, there was less. Any Sir God was a supreme overlord that could deter the world. Lineage of Star was up against a great threat and it was definitely a great incident for a new Emperor God to join them.

As for the Chaotic Divine Treasure-level armor, although it was precious, it was worth exchanging for an Emperor God. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“There are twenty-one Chaotic Divine Treasures, eighteen attack divine weapons and three sets of armor. I will pass them to you now,” Jian Wushuang looked at Hall Master Yuan, “At such a crucial moment, Lineage of Star has to make use of all resources. For the upcoming period, Hall Master Yuan, figure out a way to get some solo experts, using these Chaotic Divine Treasure or other resources as a condition. For example, you can promise them that they can cultivate the first volume of Secret Skill of Star Palace if they could work for Lineage of Star for how many tens of thousands of years.”

“With these conditions, invite them to join Lineage of Star and strengthen our overall power.”

“Of course, you don’t have to make them agree immediately. After all, they have yet to find out about the deaths of the Master of Star Palace, nor do they know the potential danger that Lineage of Star is in. Even if they agreed now, when the news spreads and the danger descends, the people will regret their choice. So, you only have to get in touch with them now and communicate with them. Let them know that we have the intention to.”

“As for true recruitment, that shall begin after the danger starts revealing itself. Those who agreed then are sincere.”

“Besides, the experts that you invite definitely can’t be those who are vicious and commit crimes. Even if they could be beneficial to the Lineage of Star because of rewards given, they will betray trust at crucial times and they might even stab the heart of Lineage of Star. We of Lineage of Star don’t need experts like them.”

“I understand,” Hall Master Yuan nodded heavily.

He naturally knew what Jian Wushuang meant.

There were many solo experts in Eternal Chaotic World. They were all kinds of people. Which experts were worthy to invite with Chaotic Divine Treasure or with large amount of resources and which experts shouldn’t be taken in, Hall Master Yuan knew very well and he knew how to do it.

“Hall Master Gun Xin, Hall Master Nie Yun,” Jian Wushuang looked to the other two Hall Masters, “The two of you shall assist Hall Master Yuan in this. After all, Hall Master Yuan is a weapon spirit. His body can’t leave Universe Galaxy and he can only rely on token communication. However, there are times where some negotiations will have to be done in person. Then, I’ll have to trouble the two of you to make trips to see them.”

“No problem,” Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun immediately agreed.

“Go ahead,” Jian Wushuang waved. The three Hall Masters immediately went to carry out their tasks.

As for Jian Wushuang himself… To Jian Wushuang, the power increase was of paramount importance.

Not only did he have to increase his own, but most importantly, he had to increase Jian Yi’s.

After all, once Jian Yi’s power resumed its peak, it would be Peak Chaotic Realm, also the level of Great Emperor. He was also extremely strong among Great Emperors.

By then, with Jian Yi as his trump cards, it would be enough to deter all forces in Eternal Chaotic World.

Lineage of Star, on Sword Star.

“I have killed many Almighties. I took many elixirs and treasures that could be used for power recovery. There are some from Lineage of Star as well. There are two White Blaze Fruits for you too. For the rest of the time, you have to try your very best to recover your power,” Jian Wushuang looked at Jian Yi and exhorted.

“Yes, Master,” Jian Yi nodded politely.

Jian Yi immediately went to cultivate in seclusion.

Then, Jian Wushuang went to another secret room as well.

“Before the danger descends, I already did everything that I could for Lineage of Star. Now, I have to prepare for the upcoming war that is going to explode,” Jian Wushuang muttered, “It’s a pity that I am a Real God and I have yet to obtain the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill. Hence, I couldn’t be aiming to become an Almighty. As for my power… I have already increased whatever I could. It is almost impossible for me to increase my power tremendously in a short period of time.”

“Hence, the only thing that I can do now is to figure out ways to compensate for my weak point.”

Weak point… Jian Wushuang did have a weak point then.

His weak point was his soul!

His soul strength was maintained at the extreme limit of Real God.

Such a soul power wasn’t weak in his realm. However, his current weakest opponent would be a Sir God and he often fought with Emperor Gods as well. Luckily, until then, he had not come across any Sir Gods of Emperor Gods who had focused on soul attacks like Sir God Tian Yuan. Hence, no one did soul attacks to him.

But once he came across one… A soul attack of Sir God level, he might be able to struggle for a while. But if it was an Emperor God who was good at soul attacks that attacked him, Jian Wushuang was not confident that he could withstand it. Hence, before Lineage of Star became a public enemy, he had to improve his weak point.

Hualala. Jian Wushuang waved and there were a bunch of elixirs for enhancing soul power and many Natural Treasures that appeared before him.

Most of the treasures were extremely precious and there were a few kinds that were worth more than tens of thousands of Doctrine Gems. Jian Wushuang prepared them carefully.

“Before the news about the Master of Star Palace’s death spreads, my soul must breakthrough!”

“Let’s begin…”
