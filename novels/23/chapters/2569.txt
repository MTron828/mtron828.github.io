Chapter 2570: Let’s Do It

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“This divine aura... It’s the divine aura of an Earth Ultimate God!”

“How is that possible? He hasn’t physically reached the Earth Ultimate God Realm but already possesses such a divine aura. Does that mean he has the strength of an Ultimate God?”

The Three Elders looked at Jian Wushuang with widened eyes from being astounded.

Jian Wushuang merely smiled before the Peak Ultimate God divine power breath in his body began to rise at an astonishing speed. The terrifying power continued to soar higher.

“It’s increasing! Both his divine aura and divine powers are increasing!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Such terrifying powers are no weaker than San Shouwang. It seems much stronger!”

The Three Elders were quite excited but Situ Yuan remained worried.

“It doesn’t prove much even if your divine aura and divine powers are comparable to an Earth Ultimate God,” commended Situ Yuan.

“How about this if it’s not enough?” Jian Wushuang smiled as he discharged an infinite sword intent and formed a Sword World which covered the entire courtyard.

Situ Yuan and the Three Elders who were in the Sword World instantly felt an unprecedented restrictive force.

The force was far beyond their imagination and much stronger than the restrictive force of any Principle World they had ever encountered!

“This... This is too strong!”

“How can a Principle World be so strong?”

“Unbelievable, I’ve never seen such a horrifying Principle World.”

The Three Elders stared at their surroundings in horror.

Finally, Situ Yuan no longer furrowed his brows.

“Mr. Jian Yi, I can now be sure that you do have the strength to challenge and even defeat San Shouwang,” said Situ Yuan.

Jian Wushuang responded to his words with a smile before withdrawing his divine powers and discharged the Sword World.

It only then did the Three Elders exhale deeply.

Under the Sword World’s intense oppression and divine powers, they felt rather uncomfortable even though they were Peak Ultimate Gods.

“I’ve proven my strength. Now, what can the Situ Clan do to help make this plan work?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Just like what you’ve suggested before, we’ll try our best to send the Official Army away. However, we can’t transfer all of them out of the Northern Darkstar Continent. I can at most send around half of them away, which is about five to six battalions. As for the remaining few battalions, we’ll find ways to prevent them from forming into a complete battalion such that they’ll be unable to make up a thousand men battalion even if they are called to action. In that case, they won’t be able to display their military formation’s full potential. That’s the most we can do.”

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. “It’ll be good enough to have five or six battalions transferred somewhere else to reduce the remaining military’s power.”

“Mr. Jian Yi, when will you be ready?” Situ Yuan asked.

“I’m ready and can set my plans in motion at any moment,” said Jian Wushuang.

“If that’s the case, I’ll make the arrangements tomorrow. After everything is done, I’ll send a message to inform Mr. Jian Yi,” said Situ Yuan.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“We’ll leave now to start with the preparations. Goodbye.”

Situ Yuan and the Three Elders left.

The Situ Clan was really efficient or perhaps also exceptionally well-connected.

Within just half a month, Situ Yuan had personally sent a message to Jian Wushuang. “Mr. Jian Yi, six out of ten Official Army battalions have now been transferred away from the Northern Darkstar Continent while the remaining four battalions are at their incomplete state. You can act now.”

“So it begins?”

Jian Wushuang’s sharp and cold gaze sent shivers down Xiao Tiexin’s spine.

“Tiexin, I’ll avenge the Xiao Clan. Unfortunately, I can’t let you kill San Shouwang yourself,” said Jian Wushuang.

“I’m grateful that Mr. Jian Yi is willing to avenge my clan. You’ve been really kind to us. I swear I’ll forever follow Mr. Jian Yi—no, my Lord.” Xiao Tiexin knelt in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Come, stand up,” Jian Wushuang waved his hand and said, “I’ll not refuse since you’ve decided. You can be my follower and maid from now on but don’t call me Lord. It’s awkward to hear you say that. Call me ‘Master’ instead.”

“Yes, Master.” Xiao Tiexin got up.

Jian Wushuang could not help but recall his maid—Qiuyue—from his previous life while looking at Xiao Tiexin. He wondered how she was fairing in the Eternal Chaotic World.

He shook his head and stopped himself from thinking too much.

“Xin’er, go to the place I told you about and wait for me there,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Master, you must be careful,” said Xiao Tiexin before she left.

Jian Wushuang went into the void ahead and departed.

It did not take long before Jian Wushuang arrived at a giant mansion.

The mansion was the Shi Clan Residence, one of the three top-tier clans in the Northern Darkstar Continent.

“Shi Clan...”

A weird smile spread across Jian Wushuang’s face as he looked downward at the mansion...

“Shi Clan, come out and die!”

Jian Wushuang’s loud bellow echoed between Heaven and Earth which caused the Shi Clan to be in turmoil.

A large number of experts dashed out from the mansion and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Yi, it’s you?”

Shi Qianhan, the Shi Clan Leader, and many Shi Clan Elders glowered at Jian Wushuang with their eyes ablaze in fury.

“Shi Qianhan, after I won one hundred and sixty thousand Primordial Stones from the Blood Gladiators Challenge in the Gladiatorial Arena owned by the Shi Clan, you sent a Peak Ultimate God to hunt me down. I’m here to get even today!

“Go to hell!”

With an angry shout, Jian Wushuang immediately launched an attack.

Everyone in the Shi Clan was horrified.

It was true that the Shi Clan had sent someone after the 160,000 Primordial Stone but were unable to retrieve it from Jian Wushuang. Thereafter, the two parties were no longer in conflict.

Just when everyone thought the grievances between both parties had been resolved, Jian Wushuang decided out of the blue to launch an attack on the Shi Clan by himself.

“You have a death’s wish!”

“Let’s attack and kill him together!”

The Shi Clan’s experts began attacking.

A war instantly broke out.

Jian Wushuang showed much stronger combat power than the average Peak Ultimate Gods. He fought single-handedly against Shi Clan’s three Peak Ultimate Gods without being disadvantaged. However, Jian Wushuang quickly lost his superiority when the fourth and fifth Shi Clan’s Peak Ultimate Gods joined the fray.

The Shi Clan’s five Peak Ultimate Gods desperately wanted to slay Jian Wushuang but discovered something during the battle.

“The armor! The armor he’s wearing seems to be very powerful!”

“I stabbed my spear into him with a frontal shot but he looks unscathed!”

“The armor he’s wearing is a Heavenly Treasure for sure!”

The Shi Clan expert’s eyes turned red at these statements.
