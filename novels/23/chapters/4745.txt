4746 The Wind-Listening Platform

The Heavenly Court was silent. Jian Wushuang looked at him and said, “I’m not in the wrong, so there’s no need to talk about punishment.”

Zhen Wuyang said in a deep voice, “The Heavenly Court is forbidden from being stained with blood, but you killed more than ten Yan Immortals. Do you not care about the Heavenly Rules?”

Jian Wushuang was calm and composed. “If I didn’t threaten them with death, I wouldn’t be standing here now. If they don’t attack me, I don’t need to care. But if they attack me, the best choice is to eliminate the threat.”

“I don’t see a threat as any different if it’s in a different setting or place, no matter if it’s in the Heavenly Realm or anywhere else.”

“All I can do is use any means to eliminate these threats.”

The Heavenly Court was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop. Only Jian Wushuang’s voice was heard as he recalled. All the Elders looked over.

They did not expect that this guy, who suppressed all the Yan Immortals in the Heaven Realm and eliminated threats by himself, would have such similar words and actions.

Zhen Wuyang sat on the Emperor’s throne without saying a word. He stared at Jian Wushuang expressionlessly.

At the same time, a supreme aura quietly covered the Heavenly Court.

Jian Wushuang felt an indescribable pressure pressing down on every inch of his skin. It was as if 100,000 divine mountains were pressing down on him.

He bit the tip of his tongue without leaving a trace. He did not even use Yan power and used the strength of his physical body to resist it.

Uncle Yu, who was standing behind Zhen Wuyang, also raised his turbid eyes to look at Jian Wushuang, then lowered his head again.

The Young Emperor also sensed it. His face turned cold, and he immediately drew the soft sword from his waist and cut it off to block the pressure.

“Imperial Father, we’re tired. Let’s hurry up and finish up so that we can go to sleep… I mean, go and face the wall.” The young Emperor put away his soft sword and looked at Zhen Wuyang with an indignant expression.

Looking at the fearless Young Emperor, Zhen Wuyang surprisingly did not get angry. He wanted to say something, but in the end, he sighed and said, “Get lost.”

The Young Emperor raised his eyebrows and pulled Jian Wushuang away.

“Wait,” Zhen Wuyang’s majestic voice sounded again. “Let Yu Chang supervise you as you reflect on your mistakes so that you repent properly.”

The old man standing behind Zhen Wuyang took the lead and walked toward the two. Then, he tied them up with his hands and left the Heavenly Court’s giant hall quickly to the Wind-Listening Platform.

When the Young Emperor disappeared, Zhen Wuyang’s eyes flashed with a touch of loneliness.

“Immortals, it’s rare for us to get together. Let’s go to the Moonrise Pavilion and have a drink.”

…

“Uncle Yu, can you let me go? Although I’m facing the wall to reflect on my mistakes, you don’t have to restrict my freedom…”

In a beautiful place with tens of thousands of peach flowers and a gentle north wind, two figures were bound together, back to back, sitting in a pavilion.

Jian Wushuang was depressed. He had only killed 10 to 20 Yan Immortals and was punished to be trapped here for 10 years.

Although the scenery was excellent, it was still a little uncomfortable to be trapped in this pavilion for ten years.

The Young Emperor, who was standing with his back against Uncle Yu’s, also looked helpless. He tried to persuade Uncle Yu, but failed.

“Young Master, ten years will pass by very quickly. Just take it as a nap.” Uncle Yu raised his head and glanced at the two of them, then sat down in a meditative state not far away.

When he saw that Uncle Yu had sat down, the Young Emperor pushed Jian Wushuang and whispered, “I have a soft sword on my waist. Pull it out gently and cut the chain…”

Jian Wushuang immediately reached for the Young Emperor’s waist.

“The sword is in my belt. Why are you touching under my waist?”

“My mistake, my hand is a little numb… Don’t move.”

“How can I not move? That part is itchy.”

…

After a difficult struggle, Jian Wushuang finally pulled out his soft sword and cut off the chains on the Young Emperor.

The Young Emperor flicked his hand, got up, took the soft sword, and also cut off the chains on his body.

“Let’s go, I’ll take you to a good place.” The Young Emperor showed a rare smug look and left with Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang could not refuse, so he turned back to look at Uncle Yu, who was still in meditation, and then followed him out of the pavilion.

As they left, Uncle Yu slowly opened his eyes, shook his head helplessly, and went back to observing his surroundings.

The two of them were just short of saying ‘I’m leaving’ out loud, so how could Uncle Yu not notice? However, he did not stop them and allowed them to leave.

As long as he did not leave the platform, he would be safe.

As Jian Wushuang strolled through the peach forest, his tense state of mind relaxed a little.

According to the Young Emperor, more than half of the noble goddesses in the Nine Heavenly Realms around the Heavenly Court lived in the Wind-Listening Platform, and there were countless Immortals who had attained Dao.

They had only walked a thousand steps when a peach Immortal sitting on a peach branch brought out a beautiful Immortal wine.

“Brother Jian, how’s your alcohol tolerance?” He took the two pots of peach wine from the peach Immortal and gave one to Jian Wushuang.

“It’s alright.” Jian Wushuang did not refuse. He raised the wine pot and took a long drink.

The slightly pinkish wine entered his throat, and a clear sweetness spread through the peach forest.

The Young Emperor smiled and followed Jian Wushuang’s example. He raised the wine pot and drank.

Although there was only one pot of peach wine made by the peach Immortal, there was a cave in the pot and it could hold at least several thousand tons of wine.

Jian Wushuang only stopped after drinking about 50 tons. He felt that his body was completely clear and he was extremely comfortable.

On the other hand, the Young Emperor drank like a whale gulping down a thousand tons of wine.

“I say, don’t you feel bloated from drinking like this?” Jian Wushuang asked.

To Yan Immortals like them who had transcended the mortal world, they could no longer get drunk from things like wine, whether they were pure or not.

Even if it was Immortal wine, it was just a taste in the throat, and not something to get drunk from.

However, when he looked at the Young Emperor, whose eyes were already hazy, he found that things were not so simple.

“No way, you’re drunk?” Jian Wushuang asked again.

The Young Emperor’s face turned red and he shook his head. “No, I’m not drunk. How can I get drunk from this peach wine?”

Jian Wushuang had no choice but to snatch the wine pot from his hand when he heard him talking.

“Hey, little peach Immortal, give me another pot of aged wine.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“…”

Jian Wushuang would never have thought that as a Yan immortal, he would be drunk by drinking wine.

“Don’t drink anymore. If you cause any trouble later, you’ll be taken back again!”

After 1,000 tons of wine entered his stomach, the young Emperor was still conscious, but his feet were already floating.
