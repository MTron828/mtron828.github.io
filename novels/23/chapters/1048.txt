Chapter 1049: Writing off at One Stroke

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“If the power in that punch is twenty or thirty percent stronger, perhaps I’d collapse entirely,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself. “It’s only the second move and he’s already this strong. I wonder what his third move is.”

While he was watching attentively for the next attack, Patriarch of Empyrean Glory once again made his move.

With a burst of dim light with him, he turned into his true body, the Sky-devouring Bat.

With his now red eyes, he gazed at Jian Wushuang as he streaked across the Void with his enormous body.

“Eep!”

Suddenly, a high-pitched hiss reverberated in the air.

The sound caused a series of strange ripples that caused black airflow to surge forth.

In a split second, the black airflow filled the entire sky and enveloped Jian Wushuang.

“What is this?” Jian Wushuang’s expression was grave as he grappled with feelings of doubt.

“Engulfing Darkness!” Patriarch of Empyrean Glory cried in a cold voice.

The black airflow rapidly turned into shock waves that charged at Jian Wushuang from all directions. The shock waves came one after another, so many that it was countless.

“Oh no!” Jian Wushuang’s expression drastically changed.

These shock waves traveled swiftly toward Jian Wushuang, who stood amid the black airflow. He was alarmed that he had no way of dodging the shock waves and that he could only depend on the surface of his body alone for defense. The only option left was to stubbornly resist these shock waves.

“Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The shock waves were extremely powerful and unyielding, the force in each wave equivalent to a Celestial Master making a strike with his full strength. Yet Patriarch of Empyrean Glory was able to unleash more than a hundred shock waves in such a short time to bombard Jian Wushuang. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Jian Wushuang was frantically trembling all over.

Moments later, the shock waves finally subsided, and the boundless black airflow also thoroughly dissipated among the Void.

The entire world came to a standstill.

“Is he dead?”

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s eyes were steely as he fixed his gaze on the fully-exposed space in the Void.

“Huh?” His expression abruptly changed.

The crowd of spectators also noticed the figure amid the chaotic airflow at the same time.

“How is this possible?” Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s face was full of shock.

That was his strongest move. It was strong enough to thoroughly crush a Celestial Master with ease. Jian Wushuang might have decent defense measures, but he ought to be reduced into dust after taking that strike. Yet…

Jian Wushuang remained standing in the Void. Though he was soaked in blood and a thoroughly sad sight, his body was perfectly intact.

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory noticed Jian Wushuang’s bright, fervent gaze. Apparently the brat was still alive!

“I win the bet, Patriarch of Empyrean Glory!” Jian Wushuang shouted. But the moment he finished speaking, blood began gushing out of his mouth.

Everyone could tell that he was severely injured.

But no matter how bad his condition was, he was still alive.

He survived Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s three very strong and unyielding attacks.

“This…”

“I don’t think even a Celestial Master expert could survive such fearsome attacks. But he managed to do it?”

“Just how exactly did he survive the attacks?”

Voices of disbelief began resounding among the crowd. These numerous gazes that landed on Jian Wushuang were filled with shock and horror.

What these people didn’t know was that Jian Wushuang was full of mirth inside.

“Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s final move was terrifying indeed, and much stronger than the first two moves. Yet it caused less damage to me than the second strike did,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s second move was a terribly strong punch that concentrated all of his power into a single point before allowing it to explode upon contact. Moreover, the punch contained ripples of vibrations that directly reached the inside of his body. That was why it was so terrifying and brought him such grave injuries.

However, there was no concentration of power in the third move. Though its destructive power was higher, Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s power was scattered.

The force contained in each of the shock waves was equivalent to a mere single strike from a Celestial Master. Though there were more than a hundred of them, Jian Wushuang was able to use his Blood-killing Plate Armor to eliminate 99 percent of their force. The remaining force left barely hurt him.

Even though there were hundreds of such injuries, they could only severely injure Jian Wushuang at most. Surprisingly, the third move was a lot less effective than the second move.

“I suppose Patriarch of Empyrean Glory didn’t know just how amazing your Blood-killing Plate Armor is. If he repeats his second move, I don’t think you’ll be able to survive it.” Gu King’s voice reverberated in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“You’re right.” Jian Wushuang grinned.

In the end, he owed it all to the armor with exceptional defense capabilities.

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory had guessed that Jian Wushuang was wearing some sort of self-protection robe, but he never once thought that the robe would have such incredible defense capabilities!

“I’ve given you your chance to kill me, Patriarch of Empyrean Glory, but you aren’t strong enough to kill me with three moves. Then, according to our bet, you must write off all the grudge between us. With so many people around, I assume you won’t go back on your word?” Jian Wushuang turned to look at Patriarch of Empyrean Glory.

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s expression immediately darkened with displeasure.

When he agreed to Jian Wushuang’s bet, he never once thought that a Celestial Master expert that was close to the Peak level would be unable to kill the latter even after unleashing his full strength.

To make things worse, how could he break his promise and attack Jian Wushuang again with so many people watching?

More importantly, even if he paid no mind to his reputation and attack Jian Wushuang, he might still fail to kill the latter. It might just turn out to be a life and death struggle instead.

“Jian Wushuang!”

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s gloomy voice rang out. “I admit that you’re strong and I respect that!”

“For as long as I’ve lived, I’ve never once respected someone from the bottom of my heart. You’re the first!”

“I won’t begrudge you for killing my son!”

“From today onward, there’s no more grudge between us. If nothing else happens, I won’t chase after you anymore.”

“You should behave accordingly from here on!”

With a flick of his sleeves, Patriarch of Empyrean Glory turned around and immediately made his exit.

His subordinates, the Ten Great Protectors, also followed suit.

“Patriarch of Empyrean Glory!” Celestial Master Dong Ming was alarmed to see this turn of events.

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory ignored him and traveled forward along with his Ten Great Protectors under the watchful eye of the spectators. The determination was reflected in his eyes, but even more so was helplessness.

“Little Yan, I’m sorry for being useless!”

“Your enemy is simply too strong!”

“I’ve already tried my best but I still failed to avenge you!”

“Please forgive me!”

With a heart filled with helplessness and sorrow, Patriarch of Empyrean Glory swiftly disappeared from everyone’s vision alongside his subordinates.
