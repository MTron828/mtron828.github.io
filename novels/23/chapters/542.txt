“Hmph, if it were me, do you expect me to rescue him again? He should feel lucky if I did not kill him directly,” the hot-tempered Divine Emperor said.

“I wouldn’t rescue him either.”

“Only a fool would. In my opinion, I should directly kill him.”

Other Divine Emperors spoke out.

Emperor Golden Snake became gloomy upon hearing their words.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Temple Master Pure Moon spoke again, but her voice was not as cold as before, “Can anyone testify that what you said is true?”

“Of course,” Jian Wushuang nodded. “The sergeants of the Seventh Army and the Sixth Army witnessed what happened. They can testify!”

Temple Master Pure Moon looked around.

The sergeants looked at each other silently. Then, Fang Han, the commander of the Seventh Army, spoke first, “Respected Temple Master and Divine Emperors, I’m Fang Han, the commander of the Seventh Army, I can testify that what Jian Wushuang said is true.”

“I can also testify,” the commander of the Sixth Army also said.

“We can testify,” Qing Huo and the other sergeants said.

After the battle today, Jian Wushuang’s strength had completely impressed them. Many sergeants began to admire Jian Wushuang. In addition, they saw clearly how Jian Wushuang went to save Jin Ling but was abandoned by Jin Ling. Naturally, they chose to testify for Jian Wushuang.

“Emperor Golden Snake, if you still don’t believe it, you can ask the sergeants under the command of Jin Ling. They shouldn’t lie to you,” Jian Wushuang said.

As soon as Jian Wushuang finished his words, a team leader who belonged to Jin Ling’s squad said solemnly, “Your Excellencies, What Sir Jian Wushuang said is true. Our squad had been surrounded by the Demonic Beasts. Sir Jian Wushuang risked his life to rescue us, but our squad leader, Jin Ling, ordered us to run away after we were rescued, leaving Sir Jian Wushuang and his squad in a desperate situation.”

“Speaking frankly, our leader, Jin Ling, really did act ungrateful.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The sergeants from Jin Ling’s squad stood out to testify for Jian Wushuang.

It made Emperor Golden Snake even more depressed.

“Golden Snake, did you hear that?” Temple Master Pure Moon turned to Emperor Golden Snake and said, “Your golden boy acted like that. How can you blame Jian Wushuang for not rescuing him?”

Emperor Golden Snake gritted his teeth and his eyes became scarlet. He took a deep breath and suddenly raised his head, “Temple Master Pure Moon,?Ling’er made a mistake, but he was my son, the last of my blood in this world!”

“For the past years, I’ve made great contributions to the Monster-exterminating League and the whole human population!”

“Now, my only son is dead. If I can’t kill Jian Wushuang, I’ll never accept it!”

“What do you want?” Temple Master Pure Moon lowered her voice.

“I’ll apply for a Life-death Duel with Jian Wushuang!” Emperor Golden Snake snorted.

“Life-death Duel?”

His words caused a stir among the crowd. Even the Divine Emperors present looked at Emperor Golden Snake in shock.

The Life-death Duel of the League was strict as it was set up entirely for the purpose of solving the endless hatred between two sides.

It didn’t matter what the two sides’ ranks were. That was to say, a Divine Emperor could even have a Life-death Duel with a newborn baby as long as he got permission from the Temple Masters. However, the larger the strength gap was between the two sides, the more difficult it was to get permission.

Nevertheless, once he got permission, the other side had to fight whether they were willing to or not. They would fight until one side died.

“According to the League’s rule, since I’m a Divine Emperor, if I want to have a Life-death Duel with a general Second-grade Divine General, I only need the permission of five Temple Masters.”

“Just five Temple Masters. I’ve made so many great contributions in the League, I don’t think that I can’t get permission from five Temple Masters,” Emperor Golden Snake said coldly. He looked at Jian Wushuang with resentment in his eyes as if he were a real snake.

“No, Golden Snake, you’re wrong,” Temple Master Pure Moon suddenly spoke up.

“Huh?” Emperor Golden Snake looked towards her immediately.

“Normally, according to the League’s rules, if Jian Wushuang is a general Second-grade Divine General, you need the permission of five Temple Masters. But he’s different,” Temple Master Pure Moon said.

“Different? What’s the difference?” Emperor Golden Snake asked.

“The situation with Jian Wushuang is not as simple as you thought. In other words, Jian Wushuang is not as... strong as you believe!” Temple Master Pure Moon spoke in a weird tone.

“What do you mean?” Emperor Golden Snake asked in confusion. The other Divine Emperors were confused as well because they did not understand what Temple Master Pure Moon meant.

Only Jian Wushuang and Qing Huo, who stood next to him, knew the reason. An odd look appeared on his face and Jian Wushuang could not help stroking his nose.

“Golden Snake, to be honest, you’ll need the permission of at least half of the Temple Masters if you want to have a Life-death Duel with Jian Wushuang. In other words, 17 of the 33 Temple Masters. The reason is simple...”

Temple Master Pure Moon paused and said slowly under the confused gaze of the crowd, “Jian Wushuang is just a little guy who is still in the Saint Realm.”

The whole battlefield immediately became still.

The sergeants, as well as the Divine Emperors, stood there in a daze.

“Temple Master Pure Moon, what did you say?” A Divine Emperor next to her thought that he misheard her.

“I said, Jian Wushuang is only a Saint Realm expert,” Temple Master Pure Moon said again.

Now, everyone had heard clearly.

After they heard her clearly, an unprecedented outcry burst forth on the battlefield.

“The Saint Realm?”

“Jian Wushuang is only a Saint Realm expert?”

“As a Second-grade Divine General, he was so strong that he could even cause a draw with Emperor Golden Snake for a short period. Yet, he’s only a Saint Realm expert?”

“Was she joking?”

Everyone was filled with an unprecedented shock, especially the sergeants, who had seen personally witnessed Jian Wushuang’s incredible and admirable strength.

But now, Temple Master Pure Moon was telling them that Jian Wushuang was only a Saint Realm expert.

“Can that be true?”

“Saint Realm? How could it be?”

“It’s impossible! ”

The sergeants shook their heads crazily.
