Chapter 2379: Not An Easy One

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

A cold sweat broke out profusely from Little Li as she stood aside, listening.

She never thought that among the few people she met just now, the most inconspicuous person—someone that she said to ignore turned out to be the most terrifying among all. He was so appalling that even Miss Xiao was fearful of him.

She knew very well of Miss Xiao’s capabilities. She could not fathom how abominably a person could be to leave a trace of fear in Miss Xiao, yet she almost dismissed his presence.

“Ten days later, these people from Narcissus Island will break into Hundred Flowers Tower and at that time, we will fully cooperate with them. I assume that you should know what to do?” said Miss Xiao.

“I know what to do.” Little Li nodded slightly.

“Go and prepare for it. You have to be more careful this time,” Miss Xiao reminded.

“Yes.” Little Li nodded again and immediately went away.

Soon, Miss Xiao was the only person left in the room. Her face was still covered with a veil while her expression had somewhat returned to its calm and relaxed state. She casually sat down, looking charming and mesmerizing as usual with her every move.

“Interesting.”

It’s been a long time since I met such an interesting person.”

...

After leaving Hundred Flowers Tower, Jian Wushuang and the others returned to the inn where they had stayed.

In the room...

“Senior Brother Xiao Heng, I have already checked it out. It’s exactly like what Miss Xiao said, there will indeed be a large auction at Qingxiao City in ten days. It’s estimated that more than 90 percent of the powerhouse in Qingxiao City will gather there and Hundred Flower Tower will be much more empty and quiet than ever.” A core disciple reported after walking in.

“Just as Miss Xiao said, our best time to act is ten days later.” Xiao Heng clasped his hands tightly.

The other core disciples were also beaming in excitement, they had obviously made up their minds to act in ten days’ time.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang’s voice suddenly rang in their ears.

“Senior Brothers, I have something to say.” Jian Wushuang remained humble.

He was just an outer disciple, which Xiao Heng and the others thought very little of him. They had never considered and bothered to ask about his opinions. They had never gotten Jian Wushuang’s consent over the plan to barge into the Hundred Flowers Tower after ten days.

They had completely ignored the presence of Jian Wushuang since a long time ago, so it was normal. After all, in their eyes, Jian Wushuang was merely in the Middle Stage Chaotic Realm. He had a good relationship with Elder Wujian and was given a chance to participate in the mission. They never thought that he would be able to contribute much, more like someone that would drag their feet.

“Jian Wushuang, what do you want to say?” Xiao Heng gave Jian Wushuang a contemptuous glance with an elevated and haughty posture.

Jian Wushuang was not annoyed, but said instead, “I would like to advise senior brothers about Miss Xiao. I think it is better to consider the rescue plan again, because... Miss Xiao, she is not as innocent and simple as she seems to like.”

Xiao Heng yelled, “Nonsense. Of course, Miss Xiao is not someone average! She is one of a kind in this world. I have never seen such a person throughout my years of cultivation journey thus far!”

Speaking of that, Xiao Heng’s gazes became extremely enthusiastic and so were the four disciples next to him. Miss Xiao had completely held them spellbound that all they wanted to do was to bring Miss Xiao out and away from the Hundred Flowers Tower. They were fearless, even if their lives were threatened.

Moreover, all of them had a trace of desire in them, including Xiao Heng. They longed to possess Miss Xiao! They were willing to give their all and even to go through fire for that.

“Jian Wushuang, you don’t have to take action in the mission ten days later if you are cowardly and afraid. All you have to do is to help us with the movements lookout around the area from within the Hundred Flowers Tower. The five of us will handle the rest,” said Xiao Heng.

“Yes, a Chaotic Realm like you can’t help much!”

“Stay in Hundred Flowers Tower and keep an eye on the surroundings for us, don’t you drag us down.”

The other four core disciples agreed.

Jian Wushuang could only shake his head and helplessly smiled.

“Alright, I’ve said what should be said and given my advice. If you insist on doing this, I can’t stop you,” Jian Wushuang murmured lightly.

He gave his advice because Xiao Heng and the disciples were pupils from the same master like him, but they never took him seriously and kept looking down at him. So Jian Wushuang did not bother to say anymore. Besides, Jian Wushuang didn’t think highly of those five people and couldn’t be bothered about their life and death.

“Go and get ready. Ten days later, we will leave here for the mission. You are allowed to move around freely during these ten days, but be mindful not to stir up any trouble,” said Xiao Heng.

“Yes.” The core disciples nodded and then they were dismissed.

‘We will only take action ten days later so I could go to that place in these ten idle days...’

...

Qingxiao City was one of the nine cities in Luogu Territory, a place where many experts gathered. Not only there were many experts within the mansion of the City’s Governor, but they were also scattered elsewhere around the city.

The magnificent mansion was suspended in the void, towering, grandiose, and daunting. There were only three to four mansions in the entire Qingxiao City that could float in the void and all their owners were outstanding figures.

Jian Wushuang arrived at the mansion whose owner’s name was known only by a single word Kun. People addressed him as Master Kun! He was recognized as the finest craft master in Luogu Territory. His refinery skill was ranked at the top three even in the entire Wusha Wilderness!

‘Is this the place?’

Jian Wushuang was dressed in a black robe and he wore a bamboo hat to hide his face while his aura was completely enshrouded. He walked right up to the entrance of the mansion, but he was stopped by someone immediately before he could enter.

It was two mansion guards who stopped Jian Wushuang. Although they were only guards, their strength and skill had reached the level of a Half-Step Divine Demon Realm.

Merely a guard could achieve the level of Half-Step Divine Demon Realm, it was not hard to imagine the skill of the experts in the mansion.

“Stop where you are.”

The two Half-Step Divine Demon Realm guards stared hostilely at Jian Wushuang.

“Please bring a message that Jian Yi would like to see Master Kun.” Jian Wushuang used the pseudonym of the previous sword slave ‘Jian Yi’.

“Jian Yi?” The two guards ran the name quickly through their minds, but they had never heard of the name Jian Yi.

“Your Excellency, I don’t know which force or family you belong to. In addition, please show your divine power, so we can bring the message to our master.” Both Half-Step Divine Demon Realm guards could not see through Jian Wushuang’s technique, hence they were rather polite at the beginning.

“I don’t belong to any force or family. I am just a lone ranger. As for my divine power...” Jian Wushuang did not intend to hide it. He released his Middle Stage Chaotic Realm divine power.

And as soon as the guards noticed Jian Wushuang’s divine power, their expressions instantly changed.
