Chapter 1643: Just A Little Bit More

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“At its highest level, I can unleash thousands upon thousands of shadows when I use my martial art motion, Flowing Light Phantom. Moreover, there is a very high requirement in terms of the level of comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine in order to achieve such a level. To achieve such a level, the minimum requirement is to be able to clear the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace!”

“In other words, as long as I can comprehend the fifteenth picture scroll in the Spacetime Fairy Palace completely, I can unleash the power of Flowing Light Phantom when it is at its highest possible realm. By then, my ability to stay alive will rise exponentially!” Jian Wushuang was clenching both his fists tightly.

The creator of the Secret Skill Flowing Light Phantom is an extremely powerful Chaotic Real God.

In spite of that, the Chaotic Real God’s level of comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine was only at the level that was enough to clear the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace. However, during his generation, when he used his martial art motion, he was recognized as the number one among the Real Gods in terms of martial art motion. From this, it could be seen how impressive his martial art motion was.

Thus, if Jian Wushuang’s level of comprehension were to achieve that level where he was able to unleash the Flowing Light Phantom’s power at its final stage, his martial art motion still might not be recognized as the number one among Real Gods. However, he would rank at least tenth among the Real Gods.

With that, not only would his abilities rise greatly, most importantly, his ability to stay alive would be greater as well.

It was a pity that after comprehending in the Spacetime Fairy Palace for forty years, he was still a very small step away from comprehending the fifteenth picture scroll fully.

“No matter what, I have to be able to unleash the power of the final stage of the Flowing Light Phantom Secret Skill. Hence, I have to think of a way to enter the Spacetime Fairy Palace again to train for a period of time.”

“As for the way…”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes slightly.

There was still a long time before the Sanctuary Alliance would give out the Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy again. Moreover, Jian Wushuang definitely could not afford to wait.

It was also impossible for the Lineage of Star to help him get another Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy.

Since that was the case, he could only rely on himself.

With his abilities, there was only one way for him to obtain comprehension time in the Fairy Palace.

Betting on a match!

…

Thunderbolt Island, Fighting Space.

When Jian Wushuang came to the Fighting Space, the two experts who were fighting an intense battle had just completed their battle.

“Real God Mo Tian, thank you for letting me win,” the voice of an old man with fluttering white hair resounded across the area.

“You are merely lucky,” after giving a cold hum, Mo Tian left straight away.

As for Jian Wushuang, he stepped into the Fighting Space immediately.

“Eh?” the old man with fluttering white hair saw the arrival of Jian Wushuang. After that, his expression changed and he laughed, “Jian Wushuang, could it be that you wish to duel with me as well?”

“I have come to bet on a match,” Jian Wushuang came in front of the old man with fluttering white hair.

“What do you wish to bet?” the old man with fluttering white hair asked.

“I still have more than one thousand years of training time in the Thunderbolt Island. Hence, I will use my one thousand years of training time, as well as a hundred Doctrine Gems, as my stakes. As for what I want, it is ten years of training time in the Fairy Palace,” Jian Wushuang said.

As soon as his words left his mouth, the old man with fluttering white hair was shocked.

One thousand years of training time in the Thunderbolt Island was considered nothing. As long as one was an Eternal Real God, he would be able to train in the Thunderbolt Island for three thousand years every one hundred thousand years. Thus, the training time in the Thunderbolt Island was not considered very precious.

However, a hundred Doctrine Gems were worth quite a lot.

After all, by adding all the treasures and belongings of a normal Eternal Real God, they only amounted to about ten to twenty Doctrine Gems.

Under normal circumstances, a hundred Doctrine Gems could represent all the treasures and belongings of a top Eternal Real God.

As Jian Wushuang had killed tens of Real Gods in one go in the Burning Demon Region back then, and he had obtained many treasures. By adding Real God Shi Jue’s treasures and belongings on top of that, he could fork out a hundred Doctrine Gems.

However, that was the best that he could do.

“Your stakes are very attractive. However, it’s a pity that I do not even have a Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy and hence training time in the Fairy Palace. Therefore, I am unable to give you what you want,” the old man with white, fluttering white hair waved his hands and was about to leave.”Access webnovel.live if you like watching manga,comics.

Jian Wushuang did not stop him. Instead, his eyes looked around the surrounding and he said heartily: “Everyone present here, if any one of you is able to fork out ten years of training time in the Fairy Palace, please step forward.”

After talking, Jian Wushuang stayed within the Fighting Space and closed his eyes. It was obvious that he planned to wait for someone to bet a match with him.

The stakes that he had proposed were indeed attractive and he believed that a number of people would be interested.

As expected, after a number of Real Gods in the Fighting Space heard Jian Wushuang’s words, they became restless.

“One hundred Doctrine Gems. This Jian Wushuang is really rich and arrogant.”

“Of course. He is the apple of the Lineage of Star’s eye.”

“What a pity. What he wants is training time in the Fairy Palace. Although there are many experts in the Thunderbolt Island, there are not many people with a Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy. At the very least, I do not have it.”

A number of Real Gods felt that it was a pity.

Although they were interested in Jian Wushuang’s stakes and were confident that they possessed the abilities to defeat Jian Wushuang, they did not possess the item that Jian Wushuang wanted.

However, although they did not have it, they informed some experts who possessed training time in the Fairy Palace at once.

In the Thunderbolt Island, there were special secret patterns carved on the roof of an exquisite attic. At that very moment, there was a purple-armored handsome man sitting down with his legs crossed over there.

The handsome man was Real God Tian Ming of the Four Symbol Mansion.

“Eh?” Real God Tian Ming’s expression changed and he opened his eyes, “Jian Wushuang is betting on a match?”

“The stakes are one thousand years of training time in the Thunderbolt Island as well as a hundred Doctrine Gems and he only wants ten years of training time in the Fairy Palace?

“He offered a hundred Doctrine Gems right away. This Jian Wushuang is really liberal with his wealth.”

Real God Tian Ming was muttering to himself. At the next moment, he got up and headed to the Fighting Space.

As soon as he arrived at the wrestling ring that the Fighting Space was at, Real God Tian Ming saw many other Real Gods who had arrived as well.

There were many Real Gods and they amounted to close to a hundred. Moreover, among those Real Gods, there were quite a number of them who Real God Tian Ming recognized or were familiar with. Moreover, there were even a few genius experts who possessed the Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy among them.

“This battle of Jian Wushuang has actually attracted so many people?” Real God Tian Ming raised his eyebrows. However, he calmed down in no time.

He knew that Jian Wushuang was not betting on a match with a specific person. Instead, he stood at the Fighting Space and declared that he would fight with anyone who could fork out ten years of training time in the Fairy Palace. This was challenging the huge number of Real Gods in the Thunderbolt Island.

In addition, Jian Wushuang was an Inverse Cultivator and he was already extremely special to begin with. As such, when the news spread, it naturally attracted many experts.

“Chen Yue,” Real God Tian Ming spoke.

“Tian Ming, you have come as well,” a Void Real God turned his head over.

“How has it been? Is there anyone who has fought with Jian Wushuang?” Real God Tian Ming questioned. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Not at the moment,” Real God Chen Yue shook his head, “Jian Wushuang wants training time in the Fairy Palace. However, there are not many people who have the Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy among the people present. Although I have a Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy, I heard that Jian Wushuang has defeated you before…”
