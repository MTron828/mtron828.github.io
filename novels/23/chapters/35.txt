Chapter 36: Blood Feather Tower

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

While Sword Marquis Mansion was in upheaval, something happened in the Gladiator Arena.

“Sir.” A black-robed servant came anxiously to Bai Chong and passed him a note.

After taking a glance at the note, Bai Chong’s face turned grim.

Some impressive words were written on the note. Jian Wushuang is in danger. Please quickly come to Tranquility Forest, ten miles from the border, to save him.

Bai Chong then looked at the signature.

“Smile Allure, Ji Wumeng.”

“Ji Wumeng?” A look of fear showed in Bai Chong’s eyes and then he immediately ordered, “All golden-robed servants follow me, right now.”

A moment later, seven figures full of energy rushed out from the Gladiator Arena.

Each of these seven figures had reached the Gold Core Realm. Among which leader Bai Chong ranked at the Peak of the Gold Core Realm.

…

Tranquility Forest, ten miles from the border.

Several figures stood in the treetops, waiting quietly.

“Here they come,” said a burly man with a head of disorganized hair. He followed them with his eyes.

WOOSH!

Ji Wuyue appeared at the top of one of the big trees, with Jian Wushuang right behind her.

Ji Wuyue said indifferently, “Then I’ll leave it to you.”

“Ji Wuyue, you didn’t tell us before that our task was to fight against Blood Feather Tower,” said an aloof and thin young man.

“How about double rewards after you finish the task?” Ji Wuyue looked around with her cold and gloomy eyes.

“OK.” Suddenly the experts who had felt dissatisfied before were nodding their heads with desire in their eyes.

“I need you guys to obstruct the experts from Blood Feather Tower for as long as you can. I also found some extra helpers for you.”

After saying that, Ji Wuyue looked up to the sky where seven figures rapidly skimmed over towards them.

“Golden-dragon Guards from the Golden-dragon Palace?” When Bai Chong came to Tranquility Forest, he not only saw those extraordinary figures on the treetops but also noticed gold rings on their index fingers.

Each of them wore a gold ring, the symbol of the Golden-dragon Guard.

“Sir Bai Chong.” Upon seeing their arrival Jian Wushuang felt pleasantly surprised, even though he was under the complete control of Ji Wuyue.

“Jian Wushuang.” Bai Chong glanced at him and then looked at Ji Wuyue with eyes suddenly becoming strange. “Are you Ji Wumeng? No, you are not her. You are Ji Wuyue!”

“Yes, it’s me.” Ji Wuyue nodded and said sternly, “Bai Chong, when my elder sister was alive, she was very kind to you and my brother-in-law also took you as his confidant. Now their son is in danger, won’t you help him?”

Bai Chong’s face darkened and he looked at Jian Wushuang with a serious expression. “Take him away right now. As for the people from Blood Feather Tower, I will try to obstruct them for a while,” Bai Chong said in a low voice.

“Thank you so much.” After thanking him, Ji Wuyue looked at the burly man beside her and said, “Bu, let’s go.”

“Yes.” The burly man nodded and immediately took Jian Wushuang, jumping into the forest with Ji Wuyue.

But just as they jumped into the forest, a chipper laugh burst between the sky and the earth.

“Ha-ha, Ji Wumeng, where are you taking that little guy? Don’t you want to take the antidote? Only I have the antidote, so you’d better stay.”

The voice was full of evil. After hearing the words, Ji Wuyue felt a slight chill but didn’t intend to stop.

After the laughter, a loud roar burst out. It was obvious that the two sides had collided.

“Golden-dragon Guard?”

“Men from the Gladiator Arena? How dare you intercept our Blood Feather Tower?”

“Humph, bastards of Blood Feather Tower. Do you think that our Gladiator Arena fears you?”

“Kill!”

The war broke out instantly with roaring and shouting. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

In the forest.

“Are those people who want to kill me?” Jian Wushuang could see several black-robed men behind them when he turned his head. Most of them wore silver masks and just a few wore golden masks.

“What the hell is going on? Those people are all here. What about Sword Marquis Mansion and Elder Hong?” Jian Wushuang shouted anxiously.

“Shut up,” Ji Wuyue shouted loudly. She continued, unsympathetically, “These people are coming for you. Their arrival here means the battle in Sword Marquis Mansion has already finished. As for Elder Hong and the others, they are dead.”

“Dead?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“All five of them swallowed Scarlet Pills. It enhances their strength quickly by consuming the person’s life. A Warrior can only swallow one Scarlet Pill in their lifetime because they are doomed to die after taking it.”

“What?” Jian Wushuang was shocked. Finally, he understood why their strength had enhanced so much before. They had swallowed a Scarlet Pill and paid for it with their lives.

“Why? Why?” Jian Wushuang could not help roaring.

“Why? Because you awoke the Sword Soul, and that’s how things are now,” said Ji Wuyue.

“Sword Soul? What is Sword Soul?” Jian Wushuang still felt baffled. He had no idea what she was talking about.

“It seems that you haven’t noticed. Right, you have just awoken it, it’s normal that you don’t know. But once your strength increases in the future you will notice the existence of Sword Soul,” said Ji Wuyue.

“Do those people want to kill me just because I have awoken Sword Soul? What the hell is Sword Soul?” Jian Wushuang roared.

“I don’t know what Sword Soul is because neither I nor the others have awoken it. The only one who has awoken it is your father, Jian Nantian,” Ji Wuyue said in an uncaring voice. “Haven’t you always wanted to know why your father left four years ago and disappeared without any news?”

“What?” Jian Wushuang glared and said, “Was it because he also awoke Sword Soul?”

“Yes,” Ji Wuyue nodded, “but you are different. Your father awoke Sword Soul during the Gold Core period. It didn’t take long before Blood Feather Tower came to kill your father after they heard that your father had awoken his Sword Soul. But they underestimated your father, which allowed him to escape by a fluke. And then your father was afraid of incriminating you and Sword Marquis Mansion, so he left and started living like a fugitive.”

“And now?” Jian Wushuang hurriedly asked.

“Now? Your father has been caught by Blood Feather Tower. I don’t know whether he is alive or not.” Ji Wuyue shook her head with a wry smile, “You only care about your father. Don’t you want to ask about your mother? Your mother…”

While speaking, Ji Wuyue abruptly had a quiver and her extremely beautiful eyes soon became scarlet with violence.
