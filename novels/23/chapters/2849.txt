Chapter 2850: Conditions

——

Previously, Jian Wushuang had diluted his perfect essence blood to a total of 100 drops.

He had a total of 100 drops of essence blood. Although he had given one drop to Mo Tao and wasted some during the refining process, he still had enough. Now, he had taken out 10 drops.

Looking at the essence of blood Mo Tao’s eyes immediately became fiery.

“My friend, can you give me some of this essence blood? Of course, I won’t take it for free. If you have any conditions, feel free to ask. I will try my best to satisfy you,” Mo Tao said.

“Brother Mo, this essence blood is not very useful to me. Since you want it, I will give you 10 more drops.” Jian Wushuang smiled and directly threw the 10 jade bottles to Mo Tao.

“This, this... is too much.” Mo Tao took the jade bottles and looked at the drops of essence blood that he could not get even in his dreams. He was very excited. After a while, he took eight bottles, he returned the other two bottles to Jian Wushuang.

“Eight drops, plus the previous one, nine drops of this essence blood is enough.” Mo Tao said with a smile.

“Brother Mo, don’t be polite with me. I do have a lot of essence blood like this,” Jian Wushuang said and waved his hand again. Immediately, more jade bottles appeared.

Looking at these jade bottles, the corner of Mo Tao’s mouth twitched slightly.

He once wanted to get a drop of essence blood like this, but he could not get it no matter how much he paid.

But now, seeing Jian Wushuang take out such a drop of blood essence, it was as if he was taking something that could be easily seen. Naturally, he was not happy.

“Nine drops of blood essence is indeed enough. Any more and the blood essence would not be precious,” Mo Tao said, “Any one of these nine drops of blood essence is worth more than a million saint elixirs. I took nine drops at one go, which is equivalent to tens of millions of saint elixirs. But I don’t know what conditions you have. If I can do it, I will try my best to satisfy you.”

“No need.” Jian Wushuang shook his head and smiled, “Brother Mo, you have already merged your blood essence into my magic weapon for me. In the process of refining it, you have also spent a lot of materials and treasures to satisfy its appetite. That’s enough for the nine drops of blood essence.”

“That’s different. The materials and treasures used in the process of refining the magic weapon are of great use to me. Because of that, I was lucky enough to break through to become an eighth-grade weapon refiner. This is more important to me than the treasures I used. Now I can’t take your blood essence for free,” Mo Tao said.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help smiling bitterly.F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“How about this, my friend Sword One, do you have any treasures at the level of holy treasure that you can use? If you do, I will make another one for you. I will provide you with the materials and various things you need to make the magic weapon. You just need to tell me what you want,” Mo Tao said.

“This...” Jian Wushuang frowned and pondered for a moment. Then he raised his head again. “I already have my natal magic weapon and natal armor, so I don’t need them for the time being. If brother Mo really feels bad, you can make a domain-type treasure for me.”

“Domain-type treasure?” Mo Tao’s expression changed.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

He had many skills, and one of the most powerful was his domain.

He had a total of four domains, and when they worked together, they were extremely powerful.

Especially during the battle between the two camps, his domain skill was enough to change the situation of the entire battlefield.

However, the domain-type treasure, the golden feather illusionary light mirror, was only a top-tier heavenly treasure. Although its power was quite impressive, as Jian Wushuang encountered stronger opponents, the effect of this domain was greatly reduced.

Naturally, Jian Wushuang wanted a more powerful holy treasure. That way, his many domains would be terrifying.

“Domain-type treasures are the most complicated and difficult among all the treasures. If I had not taken this step before, I would have to activate the Holy Heavenly Furnace to refine a decent domain-type holy treasure. But now, even without the Holy Heaven Furnace, I can still refine it. However, I need some time to prepare the materials. I’m afraid I can’t refine it in a short time,” Mo Tao said.

“There’s no hurry,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“In that case, I’ll have to ask you to wait a little longer,” Mo Tao said with a smile, then he continued, “In addition, although domain-type holy treasures are precious, their prices are still far inferior to those nine drops of essence blood. So... how about this, I’ll add two million holy elixirs to this domain-type holy treasure for you, Okay?”

“Two million holy elixirs?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. “Sure!”

This time, he did not choose to refuse. Instead, he directly agreed.

After all, he needed holy elixirs!

He needed a large number of holy elixirs to improve his realm.

After all, his current realm was only that of a Peak Divine Master.

Previously, he had planned to get rid of the 12,000 pounds of Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystals while refining the blood mountain sword. That way, he could get a large number of holy elixirs to break through, he did not expect that the Blood Mountain Sword would directly swallow the Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystals during the refining process.

Besides the treasure he needed, all the other treasures in his hands had been used up. He really did not have much wealth.

At this critical moment, Mo Tao agreed to give him two million holy elixirs. This was tantamount to timely help. Jian Wushuang certainly would not refuse.

Mo Tao took out an interspatial ring and handed it to Jian Wushuang, “There are two million saint elixirs in this interspatial ring and my communication token. When I am ready to refine the domain-type holy treasure, I will send a message to you.”

“No problem.” Jian Wushuang smiled and gave the result of the interspatial ring.

“By the way,” Mo Tao said, “Sword One, the blood essence in your hand is extremely valuable, especially your own blood essence. It is even more incredible. But don’t take it out in the future, and don’t be stupid enough to sell it for saint elixirs or other treasures. If you are not careful, you might even be killed.”

“Yes, I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

Of course, he knew that the blood essence was very important.

Especially his own blood essence, the most perfect blood essence. If it really spread, it would attract many experts.
