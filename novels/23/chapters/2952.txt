Chapter 2953: Star Sea Saint

——

“So that’s how it is?”

Xue Dong King was quick-witted. After hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, he understood everything.

“The three Shadow Saints are really well-hidden. If we hadn’t come here to carry out the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s mission and killed the three of them, we wouldn’t have known that such a treasure was hidden here,” Xue Dong King said.

“It’s a pity that the three Shadow Saints waited for the fruit to appear for so many years, but in the end, it still benefited you and me for nothing,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Yes.” Xue Dong King’s eyes were also shining. “The fragrance of the fruit is already very strong. It’s only missing the last bit of transformation. If I’m not mistaken, the fruit should be completely ripe in a month or so.”

“A month.” Jian Wushuang was delighted.

Both he and Xue Dong King could tell that this fruit was not an ordinary object.

Otherwise, the three Shadow Saint Clan would not have spent so much effort to protect this place for so many years.

Now that the three Shadow Saint Clan were dead, those who knew about the existence of this fruit…

“Oh no!” Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly changed.

“What’s wrong?” Xue Dong King immediately looked over.

“I’m afraid it won’t be that easy for us to completely occupy the fruit,” Jian Wushuang said.

“What do you mean?” Xue Dong King was puzzled.

“Do you remember what the third Shadow Saint said before he died? He said that although the three brothers are dead, neither of us will have a good life.” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold, “I thought the third Elder of the three Shadow Saints was just saying it casually, but now it seems that it’s not that simple.”

Xue Dong King frowned.

The cold Elder did say that when he died.

“If I’m not wrong, the third Elder of the Shadow Three Saints knew that he was going to die, so he must have secretly spread the news of this fruit before we killed him. Even if he didn’t, he must have told others,” Jian Wushuang said.

“What?” Xue Dong King was shocked.

The fruit was obviously very valuable, and it was not ripe yet. They could not pick it and leave immediately.

They had to wait here quietly for a month. If the cold elder really spread the news, then there would be other experts who would come to fight with them during the month…

“If that’s the case, then it’s troublesome,” Xue Dong King said with a frown.

“It’s very troublesome. The key is that neither of us knows what this fruit is or its specific value. We don’t know what level of experts it will attract,” Jian Wushuang said.

If only some false saints were attracted by the fruit, he would not care even if a Peak False Saint appeared.

But if a True Saint was also attracted, then it would be really troublesome.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis.” Xue Dong King’s brows suddenly relaxed, and he also had a smile on his face.

“Right now, we’re not sure if the boss of the three Shadow Saints has spread the news. Even if he did spread the news, if an ordinary expert came, the two of us would be able to easily resist him. In this territory, the only one who has the battle strength of a True Saint is that Star Sea Saint. But he’s only a first-level True Saint. Even if he personally arrives, the two of us can barely resist him.”

“Besides, even if we can’t resist it, we can just leave the fruit. After all, our mission has been completed, and the fruit is just an unexpected surprise.”

“Haha, you’re right.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Indeed, they had many choices. There was no need to worry or struggle now.

“Just wait. A month will pass very quickly. Maybe no one will come after a month?” Xue Dong King smiled.

Immediately, Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King waited quietly in the underground of the palace.

…

It was a vast and boundless void.

In the void, there were many beautiful and dazzling stars.

A dense mass of stars formed together, forming a vast sea of stars.

And in the center of this sea of stars, there was a majestic continent floating. In the center of the continent, there was a ten thousand Zhang Tall Mountain Palace. There was a bamboo forest. In the depths of the bamboo forest, there was a bamboo house. Inside the bamboo house, there was a middle-aged man dressed in gray robes, the cold and arrogant middle-aged man who had his eyes on the stage was sitting cross-legged there.

This cold and arrogant middle-aged man was the only True Saint known in the surrounding territories, the Star Ocean Saint!

The Star Ocean Saint was an expert who comprehended the laws of the earth. His comprehension of the laws of the earth was extremely high. In order to comprehend the laws of the earth, he did not even wear shoes all year round. He walked barefoot and brought his body closer to the earth.

Whoosh!

A figure shot out from the void at the fastest speed, landing in this bamboo forest. Then, he walked to the front of the bamboo house and bowed respectfully. “Greetings, Saint Lord!”

The Star Sea Saint also controlled a force, and he was respectfully called the Saint Lord in that force. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Come in.” The Star Sea Saint waved his hand, and the bamboo door opened. The graceful woman who had already reached the level of the Immortal Saint quickly walked into the bamboo house.

“What’s the matter?” The Star Sea Saint asked. His voice was cold and emotionless.

He was the only true saint in this territory, and his strength was publicly acknowledged to be the strongest.

He was already high and mighty, and now he was only focused on reaching a higher level of cultivation. As for other things, he could not be bothered to pay attention to them.

Moreover, for the current him, there were very few people in this territory who could make him pay attention to them.

“Saint Lord, I just received news from an Immortal Saint who has a good relationship with me. He said that not long ago, the boss of the three Shadow Saints had personally sent him a message saying that there was a special treasure in the dark shout territory that he occupied,” the graceful woman said.

“Special treasure? What is it?” The Star Sea Saint’s expression did not change.

“Earth God Fruit!” The graceful woman said directly.

“What did you say?”

The Star Sea Saint, who had a calm and indifferent expression, stood up directly, his hair and beard blowing.

“Is what you said true? Is there really an earth god fruit in the realm of secret shout?” The Star Sea Saint looked at the graceful woman excitedly.

“That good friend of mine wouldn’t lie to me. As for the three Shadow Saints… I’ve sent people to investigate it carefully. I’ve also received internal information from the dark rebuke territory. The three Shadow Saints had met a great enemy a few days ago and died. The news was sent by them before they died. In addition, they said that the great enemy God Fruit would take another month to ripen,” said the graceful woman.
