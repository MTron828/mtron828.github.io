“Let him have the one hundred and sixty thousand of Primordial Stones first,” said Shi Qianhan.

“Really?” The graceful woman was reluctant.

“Hmph, it’s just temporary. What’s there to be worried about?” Shi Qianhan sneered.

“You meant...” The graceful woman immediately looked over.

“Jian Yi has won five Blood Gladiators in a row. We have to give him the one hundred and sixty thousand Primordial Stones, but I can always find ways to get them back from him. I don’t think it’s that difficult,” said Shi Qian coldly.

The graceful woman knew Shi Qianhan had a plan.

“Third Elder,” said Shi Qianhan.

“Yes,” responded a grey-robed old man who came in with Shi Qianhan.

“I’ll leave this to you. We have to take back the one hundred and sixty thousand Primordial Stones no matter what. As for Jian Yi... Such a genius who can defeat a member of Dragon Phoenix Pavilion is rare. He must be extremely talented. You may first try to recruit him into the Shi Clan and once I’ve full control over him, he can have the one hundred and sixty thousand Primordial Stones if he needs it.

“One hundred and sixty thousand Primordial Stones are nothing when compared with a genius like him,” said Shi Qianhan.

“What if he disagrees?” asked the grey-robed old man.

“Bring his body back along with the one hundred and sixty thousand Primordial Stones.” Shi Qianhan’s eyes turned cold. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“I understand.” The grey-robed old man nodded and left right away.

“Seventh Elder, you’ll wrap things up here. I’ll return to the clan and await good news,” said Shi Qianhan while glancing at the graceful woman.

“Yes.” The graceful woman nodded.

...

Five consecutive battles victories.

A huge number of spectators bore witness while Jian Wushuang was crowned as the new Blood Gladiator. This news would no doubt spread throughout the Northern Darkstar Territory like wildfire.

The name Jian Yi would soon be known by every clan in the Northern Darkstar Territory.

“Master Jian Yi, these are the Primordial Stones you’ve just won. You may count them.” The black-robed old man handed an Interspatial Ring to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took the ring and nodded after scanning through.

Jian Wushuang was happy the Shi Clan did not try to negotiate and replace Primordial Stones with treasures of equivalent value.

He did not linger in the arena after receiving the Primordial Stones.

Along his way out of the arena, every cultivator who saw Jian Wushuang showed their respect.

Two figures appeared in front of Jian Wushuang before he left the gates.

The two men—one wore a scarlet armor and the other was in a white robe.

“Jian Yi, I’m the Third Army Commander, Bai Kong!”

“I’m the Eighth Commander, Huo Xiong!”

They introduced themselves first.

“The army’s commanders?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

According to Xiao Tiexin, the army’s commanders were powerful Peak Ultimate Gods while their one thousand subordinates were highly revered and rather powerful in the Northern Darkstar Territory.

The commanders were respectable people that even the Northern Darkstar Territory’s clans had to be polite and dared not offend them.

He wondered why the two commanders appeared in front of him.

“Why are you looking for me?” Jian Wushuang’s expression was calm.

“We watched your battle with the Ancient Witch. You are indeed extremely talented. The Ancient Witch is a super genius from the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion and is in the same realm as you, yet she was defeated. It took us by surprise.” The white-robed commander, Bai Kong smiled.

“Dragon Phoenix Pavilion?” Jian Wushuang quickly scanned through his mind only to realize he had never heard of them.

However, the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion must be a very powerful force judging from both commanders’ expressions before him. Otherwise, they would not have such geniuses as the Ancient Witch.

“Jian Yi, we won’t waste your time. Both of us think that you are extremely talented and have great potential, so we want to invite you to come with us and join the army,” said Huo Xiong.

“Join the army?” Jian Wushuang smiled but then resolutely shook his head. “I appreciate both your kindness, but I don’t plan to join the army for the time being nor any other clans.”

“You don’t want to?” Huo Xiong frowned slightly.

“Jian Yi, you have to think about your current situation. You’ve been targeted by many people, but I will guarantee your safety if you’re willing to join the army. No one will dare to nettle with you in the entire Northern Darkstar Territory,” said Bai Kong.

He meant what he said and was capable of doing so.

The army commander in the Northern Darkstar Territory only obeyed the commands of the Territorial Lord. No one else dared to mess up with them in the entire Northern Darkstar Territory.

Jian Wushuang would be safe under their protection such that even the Shi Clan would not find fault with Jian Wushuang.

“I’m sorry, but I really don’t plan to join the army. I’ll go now.” Jian Wushuang refused and moved to a side while trying to walk past them.

Both of these commanders stood there with their faces turning a little ugly.

“This kid is too ignorant. Don’t he know that we are actually saving him?” Huo Xiong was angry.

“I’m to be blamed for this. I shouldn’t have pitied this genius and suggest taking him back to the army to save him. I thought we could grow closer to him, but who would’ve known that he doesn’t even appreciate it.”

“That’s alright. He can’t blame it on anyone since he wants to die,” snorted Huo Xiong coldly.

Both commanders soon left.

Jian Wushuang left the Gladiatorial Arena before both commanders. He took out a token and sent Xiao Tiexin a message once he left.

“Tiexin, find a place, and stay low for now. I’ll look for you later,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Why? Could it be that someone from the Shi Clan has marked you?” Xiao Tiexin immediately replied.

“Haha, I won one hundred and sixty Primordial Stones. Any clan in their right minds won’t be willing to give away such a large amount of Primordial Stones, right?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He was very alert when he left the arena and noticed he was being tailed.

“You must be careful,” said Xiao Tiexin.

“Don’t worry, the Shi Clan can’t do anything to me. I’ll entertain them if they want to play.” Jian Wushuang was very confident.
