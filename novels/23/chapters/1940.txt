1941 Barging Into Soul Snatching Palace

On the huge land that was floating. The floating land was where the imperial city of Holy Kingdom of Sky Luo was located.

But then, Luo Royal Family was exterminated and the imperial city fell into the hands of Soul Snatching Palace.

The lair of Soul Snatching Palace was set up there as well in order to take control of the entire Holy Kingdom of Sky Luo.

“Although I have no idea what the goal of Holocaust Sect was, regardless… I’ll just exterminate them straight away,” Jian Wushuang overlooked the huge floating land as his eyes glowed with a chilly gleam.

“Duan Lingfeng, you go first,” Jian Wushuang said.

“No problem.”

Duan Lingfeng didn’t hesitate as he moved towards the huge floating land.

Rumble. There was an extremely fierce Real God aura that swept out.

The Real God aura was almost unbelievable among Real Gods.

“Who is it?”

“Stop!!!”

Someone shouted and there were suddenly a few figures that burst out.

Hearing the shouts, Duan Lingfeng didn’t stop his footsteps.

“Courting death!!”

Someone shouted again. There were a bunch of figures that burst out from Soul Snatching Soul and let out fierce auras. There were as many as six Real Gods.

In the void afar, Jian Wushuang and the few others stood there and watched quietly.

“Mister, will we just watch as Mister Duan barge into Soul Snatching Palace alone?” The purple-haired youth, Luo Tianhong creased his eyebrows.

He already knew what Jian Wushuang’s plan was. He was there to exterminate Soul Snatching Palace.

However, Soul Snatching Palace was a dangerous spot. Mister Duan had barged in alone. Wouldn’t it be extremely dangerous?

“Don’t worry, just watch,” Jian Wushuang looked calm.

On the floating land, there was an explosion of war.

Duan Lingfeng, who was in a white robe, held his saber in one hand and he looked as though he had transformed into a demon.

With a billowing massacre aura, the boundless massacre doctrine formed a massacre realm that covered the entire universe.

In terms of comprehension of massacre doctrine, Dean Lingfeng had obviously reached the standard of the seventh level of Doctrine Palace. It was already the standard of an Almighty.

His saber skill was even scarier.

No matter how great the number of Real God and Universe God were there from Soul Snatching Palace, they were just clay chickens and pottery dogs, completely useless.

He had massacred and left behind a sea of blood. There was no one who could withstand his saber lights that he performed with ease.

With his power alone, he had barged into the lair of Soul Snatching Palace and massacred rampantly.

“This, this…”

Luo Tianhong was dumbfounded at the sight.

He was shocked at the power displayed by Duan Lingfeng.

“He’s so powerful!”

“Mister Duan is so powerful!”

“They are Real Gods but one casual slash of his saber could kill three of them. The higher-ups from Soul Snatching Palace teamed up and formed a formation to block but he broke them apart with one slash!”

“He is that powerful?”

It stirred a great commotion in Luo Tianhong’s heart.

He had always stayed in Holy Kingdom of Sky Luo. He had only wandered in a few other Holy Kingdoms nearby. Although he had some experience, he wasn’t as knowledgeable and experienced.

In his eyes, Real Gods were already high above, especially those who were Eternal Real Gods and Chaotic Real Gods.

Especially Chaotic Real Gods. In a normal situation, a Chaotic Real God could take over a Holy Kingdom and become a ruler easily.

For instance, the strongest person in Luo Royal Family, Monarch of Sky Luo, was only a Chaotic Real God.

He was also the strongest person Luo Tianhong had ever seen.

But then… Duan Lingfeng’s rampant massacre and the power he displayed had exceeded Luo Tianhong’s imagination.

“Huh? Those black-robed masked men appeared,” Luo Tianhong’s heart clenched.

He saw that there were dozens of black-robed figures with savage masks who had appeared on the battlefield.

Those black-robed masked men were all powerful. The weakest of them was a top Eternal Real God. Most of them were Chaotic Real Gods.

The dozens of them teamed up to hem Duan Lingfeng in.

“Mister Duan is in danger!” Luo Tianhong was worried.

But in the end…

Vroom!!!

A cold saber light swept and more than half of the dozens of black-robed masked man were wiped out by the merciless blade light.

Then, Duan Lingfeng casually swung his saber at the remaining few.

In the blink of an eye, the dozens of black-robed masked men were wiped out.

“This is too too scary!” Luo Tianhong stared.

Jian Wushuang next to him wasn’t surprised at such an outcome.

“Luo Tianhong, what do you think of my best friend’s power?” Jian Wushuang suddenly asked.

“Mister Duan is the strongest person I have ever seen in saber skill and comprehension of Massacre doctrine,” Luo Tianhong said in a serious tone.

“Of course, he is widely acknowledged as the number one Real God in Eternal Chaotic World,” Jian Wushuang smiled and said.

“Number one Real God in Eternal World?” Luo Tianhong stunned.

Although he had never been to Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, he knew just how impressive it was to be a number one Real God in Eternal World.

Of course, they had said that Duan Lingfeng was the number one Real God in Eternal World without taking Jian Wushuang into consideration.

Because in Eternal Chaotic World, there was no one who treated Jian Wushuang as a Real God anymore.

“Luo Tianhong, you are also good at saber skills and you are also comprehending Massacre Doctrine. Don’t you want to be his disciple?” Jian Wushuang casually asked.

“Be formally apprenticed to Mister Duan?” Luo Tianhong was stunned and his eyes immediately shimmered, “I, of course, want to be formally apprenticed to him. I wonder if Mister Duan is willing to take me as his disciple.”

“You can give it a try,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Jian Wushuang looked as though he was casually speaking but Luo Tianhong took his advice seriously.

He looked at Duan Lingfeng, who was massacring rampantly, and he made up his mind.

Just then… F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Hong!

There was a fierce divine might that suddenly soared. The divine might was high and above and it instantly engulfed the universe.

On the floating land, the cultivators were shivering in fear under such divine might. Some even knelt down straight away.

“This is?” Luo Tianhong looked terrified.

There was a malicious smile that spread across Jian Wushuang’s face.

The cold-looking elder in a black robe was the one who gave out the divine might. When Jian Wushuang saw the cold-looking elder, his gaze was fixed.

“Hehe, someone familiar,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

He wondered if it was a coincidence. He had met the cold looking elder once.

It was many years ago. Back when Jian Wushuang was just a stage two Ultimate Real God, it was too difficult for him to accumulate Ultimate Divine Power in his body. Hence, he went to Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning that was controlled by Sir God Luo Sha’s under the lead of Sir God Mad Dog.

When Jian Wushuang was taking in the Power of Absolute Beginning in Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning, the experts from Holocaust Sect happened to barge in.

Then, there were four Sir Gods who came. The cold-looking elder was one of them.

In the end, Jian Wushuang, Sir God Mad Dog and Sir God Luo Sha had teamed up to fight off the other four Sir Gods. They had even killed His Highness Mu Hong.

Now, he had crossed paths with the cold-looking elder again.
