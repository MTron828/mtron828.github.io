Ruler Grotto Profound’s body trembled as he took a step forward, planning to retreat and put some distance between them.

However…

“There’s no chance.” Cang Feng shook his head.

As soon as he finished speaking, the sword-light completely blasted away the lightning. Other than the sword-light dimming a little, it continued to shoot toward Ruler Grotto Profound.

Clang!

In an instant, the sword light viciously stabbed into Ruler Grotto Profound’s chest, piercing through his divine body!

Pfft!

With a muffled sound, Ruler Grotto Profound’s entire body was like a torn sack. He streaked through the air in an arc and fell into the distance.

“Die!” Ruler Grotto Profound’s body was obliterated by large amounts of divine power, and his face was deathly pale. This sword had almost taken his life.

“Dongxuan!”

“What?” Ruler Mountain Shaker was startled, and he immediately rushed over to Ruler Grotto Profound’s side and helped him up. He poured all of his divine power into his divine body, helping him erase the sword Qi.

Under the divine power of Commander Mountain Shaker, the Ruler Grotto Profound’s injuries gradually recovered. His pale face also became better, but it was still a sallow color.

“L-Lord Commander, I’m sorry. I lost in my first battle and let you down…” Ruler Grotto Profound forced himself to sit up and spoke with some difficulty.

“Shut up. Take care of your body. I’m waiting for you to kill with me in the future. As for defeat, it’s not your problem.”

The Mountain Shaker commander interrupted him. He took a deep breath and looked at Cang Feng with fear. Then, he turned to Hong Ye and said, “Hong Ye, you’re really good at scheming. This Cang Feng probably already has an unrivaled commander-level battle prowess, right?”

Hearing this, Hong Ye smiled faintly and replied, “Mountain Shaker, you don’t need to care about his fighting strength. As long as he’s a Ruler under me, he’s in line with the rules. Do you understand?”

Commander Mountain Shaker snorted heavily upon hearing this. He knew that there was no way to refute Hong Ye’s words. As long as Cang Feng was one of Hong Ye’s subordinates, there was nothing he could do, even if he was an Invincible Ruler.

Taking a deep breath, the commander continued in a deep voice, “Hong Ye, we admit defeat. You can take the God Sealing Tablet.”

After he finished speaking, Commander Mountain Shaker planned to lead his team and leave.

He knew that the Ultimate Rulers under him were no match for Cang Feng. Even if they did, they would only be throwing their lives away.

In that case, the outcome would be the same, so he might as well hand over the God Sealing Tablet.

Although Commander Mountain Shaker was unwilling, he could only lower his head in the face of circumstances.

Just as Jian Wushuang was about to leave with Commander Mountain Shaker, Hong Ye suddenly said, “Hold on,”

“What?”

Commander Mountain Shaker stopped in his tracks. He turned around and looked at Hong Ye. His expression was not very good as he said, “Hong Ye, we have already admitted defeat. What else do you want?”

Hong Ye put on a fake smile. “Mountain Shaker, our rule is three rounds of competition. How can you leave before the competition is over?”

“I, Ping Sheng, hate those who don’t follow the rules the most,” Hong Ye continued after a pause.

After he finished speaking, the Ultimate Rulers behind him all surged with divine power and vaguely pulled apart the formation. It was as if they would attack if Commander Mountain Shaker dared to take another step.

“Hong Ye, you’ve gone too far!”

Commander Mountain Shaker glared at Hong Ye. His eyes were extremely cold.

Hong Ye looked down at Commander Mountain Shaker from above and said with a playful smile, “Mountain Shaker, I’m already giving you a chance. Otherwise, if we really started fighting, do you think we could leave this place alive?”

Commander Mountain Shaker took a deep breath and pondered for a moment. He then slowly said, “Alright, then let’s continue.”

After saying that, he looked at the Ruler Earthfury, who had a grave expression on his face, and said, “Earthfury, when you fight Cang Feng, just admit defeat and save your life.”

The Ruler Earthfury nodded and replied solemnly, “Alright,” he said.

He was not a brainless brute. He could naturally tell that Cang Feng’s power had already reached the commander-level of an invincible Ruler. He was no match for him at all.

“Then let’s start.” Hong Ye smiled and waved his hand.

Instantly, the battle started again.

The Ruler Earthfury walked toward the empty space in the middle with heavy steps.

Cang Feng, who had his eyes closed and was hugging his sword, slowly opened his eyes upon hearing this. He looked at the Ruler Earthfury and said, “You won’t have the same luck as that person just now.”

Ruler Earthfury frowned, not understanding what he meant.

However, he did not plan to think too much about it. He followed the instructions of Commander Mountain Shaker and said, “Cang Feng, I admit defeat for this battle…”

However, before he could finish his sentence.

“You want to admit defeat?” Cang Feng sneered coldly as he pulled out the blue divine sword. With a single step, he transformed into a sword radiance and lunged forward!

“You’ll have to ask the sword in my hand if it agrees!”

Boom!

“Die!” Cang Feng’s speed was extremely fast, and he immediately flew over on his sword. He transformed into a shocking sword-light, and blue sword Qi slashed out in all directions as he slashed toward the Ruler Earthfury.

“You!”

Ruler Earthfury’s expression changed. He had already admitted defeat, but Cang Feng still refused to let him go!

“Hong Ye, what do you mean by this?”

Seeing this, Commander Mountain Shaker also flew into a rage and glared at Hong Ye.

As for Hong Ye, he only smiled and did not respond.

“Secret technique, star fall!”

Ruler Earthfury let out an angry roar as the spear in his hand flashed with a cold light and stabbed toward Cang Feng!

Clang!

The tip of Ruler Earthfury’s spear collided with Cang Feng’s sword light. Starting from the tip, the spear began to crack.

The difference in strength between the two of them was too great!

After the spear shattered, Cang Feng laughed coldly as the Ruler Earthfury watched in horror. The blue divine sword in his hand slashed down once more, directly splitting the Ruler Earthfury in half!

“No!”

“Arghh!” Ruler Earthfury let out a miserable scream.

However, Cang Feng did not show any mercy at all. the sharp sword Qi exploded once again, directly killing the Ruler Earthfury’s divine body that had been split in half!

When Commander Mountain Shaker saw this, he was so angry that his eyes were about to burst. A wave of anger rushed to his head.

As for Cang Feng, he kept his sword and the cold smile on his face disappeared.

“Cang Feng, my Ruler has already admitted defeat. Why do you still want to take his life?” The Mountain Shaker commander glared at Cang Feng and panted heavily in anger.

Cang Feng looked at him indifferently and replied, “He’s not strong enough, he can’t blame me.”

“What a good…not strong enough!”

Commander Mountain Shaker laughed in anger. The veins on his forehead twisted as he said, “Cang Feng, what sort of skill do you have to bully a Ruler under my command? If you have the guts, come fight me. Whether we live or die will depend on our own strength. How about it?”
