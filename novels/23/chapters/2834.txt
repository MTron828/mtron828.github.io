Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

Jian Wushuang had a lot of treasures on hand that were worth 300,000 saint elixirs. Of course, there were also treasures that were worth 300,000 saint elixirs.

For example, the mountain and river map, blood mountain sword, and seal the heaven scroll were all worth more than 300,000 saint elixirs.

However, these treasures were all very useful to Jian Wushuang. Besides these treasures, the only treasure that Jian Wushuang could take out that was worth 300,000 saint elixirs was the last piece of Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal!

In the blood wilderness concentrate, Jian Wushuang had obtained three pieces of Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal. He had already used the two small pieces. The second piece of Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal was sold to Lord Mo by Yin Su’er at a very high price, Jian Wushuang had also divided 10,000 saint elixirs.

But in fact, Yin Su’er had actually sold it for more than 10,000 saint elixirs.

The Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal that Yin Su’er had sold was only 230 kilograms, but the last piece of Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal in his interspatial ring weighed more than 10,000 kilograms!

.

A Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal that weighed more than 10,000 kilograms was worth at least 600,000 to 700,000 sacred elixirs.

Moreover, Lord Mo was a weaponsmith, and he needed rare materials like the Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal. If he brought this Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal to see Lord Mo and asked Lord Mo to listen to him reforge the blood mountain sword... Lord Mo might agree.

“Mr. Sword One, Lord Mo is of high status. Even I don’t have his direct contact. I can only contact his personal disciple. How about I ask him for you now?” Yin Su’er said.

“No need. Just tell me where he is. I’ll go and find him myself,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Okay.” Yin Su’er nodded. “It’s not a secret where Lord Mo lives. Many people in the nine realms know that he lives in the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City, one of the four holy cities.”

“Dragon-phoenix Sacred City?” Jian Wushuang’s heart skipped a beat. “Why does the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City sound like it has something to do with the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion?”

“Of course it has something to do with it. The headquarters of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion is in the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City, and the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City is completely under the control of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion,” Yin Su’er said with a smile.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows, then he said, “Castle Lord Su’er, I’ve been wandering in the Pill Sun Sacred World, so I don’t know much about the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. As for the four holy cities you mentioned, I’ve never heard of them before. Can you tell me about them?”

“Of course,” Yin Su’er immediately said, “Mister Sword One, you should know that the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow is actually made up of nine realms. Compared to the entire absolute beginning divine realm, the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow is nothing. Just in the endless territories beyond the third firmament, places like the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow are countless.”

“And the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, before this, every realm had a world overlord who controlled everything. This world overlord was always held by the Undying Sage. For example, the previous world overlord of the Sacred Realm of the Pill Sun was my father. But after my father died, the Sacred Realm of the Pill Sun no longer had a world overlord. It became the only realm in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow without the Undying Sage.”

“In fact, since the Immortal Saint is no longer in charge of the Pill Sun Sacred World, we don’t have the right to occupy such a large territory. The other major realms can totally divide up the territory of the Pill Sun Sacred World. The reason why this didn’t happen is that the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow had made an agreement a long time ago.”

“What agreement?” Jian Wushuang looked at her.

“This agreement was decided by many world masters of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow and the top forces,” Yin Su’er said in a deep voice.

“Mr. Sword One, first of all, you should know the overall structure of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow... The Nine Realms of the Golden Crow has always been divided into one emperor, four pavilions, and eight great worlds!”

“The eight great worlds here refer to eight of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow!”

“The four pavilions are the four super forces that live in different realms but do not expand their territory. They are the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, the Star-pointing Pavilion, the Thundercloud Pavilion, and the Celestial Pavilion. Their overall strength and heritage are far above that of the other realms. Although they do not compete for hegemony, they have created a sacred city with great means. These four holy cities are the most prosperous places in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow.”

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s pupils contracted.

He had heard of the four pavilions, the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, and the Star Pavilion.

The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion was the recognized genius concentration camp in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. Those who could enter the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion were all dragons and phoenixes among men.

The Star Pavilion was the number one chamber of commerce in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. Its power covered all the realms of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. For example, there were many branches of the Star Pavilion in the Pill Sun Sacred World.

He knew about both of them, but it was his first time hearing about the Thundercloud Pavilion and the Celestial Immortal Pavilion.

However, the Thundercloud Pavilion and the Celestial Immortal Pavilion were not weak since they were named after the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and the Point Star Pavilion.

“Now that there are four pavilions, what does one emperor mean?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“One emperor... means the true overlord of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, the Bone Emperor Realm!” Yin Su’er said.

“Bone Emperor Realm? A realm?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“That’s right. There are nine realms in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, but there are only eight of them. The last one is the Bone Emperor Realm,” Yin Su’er said solemnly, “although the Bone Emperor Realm is also a realm, its territory is larger than the other eight realms combined. The Realm Master of the Bone Emperor Realm, Bone Emperor, is recognized as the number one expert in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow!”

Jian Wushuang was shocked. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

They were both in the same realm, but the territory of the Bone Emperor Realm was comparable to the other eight realms combined?

“How strong is the Bone Emperor, the number one expert in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I don’t know exactly how strong he is, but he is definitely a very strong Immortal Saint. There have been rumors that when he rose to power, he killed several Immortal Saints in one go, which made him famous. After he established the Bone Emperor Realm and became the emperor of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, he rarely made a move. But every time he made a move, it was earth-shaking. All the Immortal Saints in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow respected him.”

“For example, the world overlords of the Eight Realms and the undying saints of the four pavilions are all in awe of this Bone Emperor. As for that agreement, it was actually proposed by this Bone Emperor. Because the eight realms have always been dependent on the Bone Emperor Realm, this Bone Emperor proposed this agreement to maintain the balance of the eight realms.” Yin Su’er said.
