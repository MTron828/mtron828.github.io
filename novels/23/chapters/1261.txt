Chapter 1262: Three Months

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Weng!

A raging wind carrying dense sword shadows blew violently to Universe Master Bei.

“Spell of Disturbance!”

As a light of killing intent flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes, the sword lights covered Universe Master Bei with an overwhelming Soul Attack behind each of the light.

If Jian Wushuang only used one-tenth of his power in the move, Universe Master Bei might be able to withstand the attack.

However, Jian Wushuang’s move was a perfect combination of Spell of Disturbance and Soul Attack.

The moment the sword light flashed, the Soul Attack behind it crushed to Universe Master Bei.

As a Universe Master, he could barely take it and immediately gave up struggling. Covered by the countless sword shadows, he was crumbled into pieces before he could even let out a scream.

As the Soul Attack had made no sound, the onlookers all thought that Universe Master Bei was killed by Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship.

Losing their leader, the remaining experts of the Red Water Alliance in that city lost their morale and was eradicated by the soldiers of the Seventh Army in a short while.

After killing Universe Master Bei, Jian Wushuang returned to the void outside the city.

“Gentlemen, I didn’t let you down.” Jian Wushuang voice was loud and clear.

Lin Dong and Mo You looked at Jian Wushuang with a strange expression.

Before whenJian Wushuang and Universe Master Bei were equally matched, it had surprised them. Now, they were even more surprised that Jian Wushuang actually managed to kill the master.

“Universe Master Bei is so powerful that though I can defeat him by a neck, it will take me a lot of effort to kill him. However, you have just killed him on your own.” Lin Dong squinted his eyes.

“I was lucky. I had fought with him hard-on-hard at first, but later, I changed my strategy. I improved my speed to the extreme and therefore launched an unexpected attack. Universe Master Bei could barely dodge it and was killed.” Jian Wushuang answered with a smile.

“Is that so?” Lin Dong and Mo You exchanged a glance at each other. They all thought that there was something fishy about Universe Master Bei’s death; otherwise, that mastered should not have been suddenly killed in a close fight.

They nodded at Jian Wushuang’s explanation but were full of doubt in fact.

“Now, since Universe Master Bei was dead, the only leader of the Red Water Alliance will be their Young Master, Gu Nan. Though he is a Universe Master as well, he is no match for even Universe Master Bei. As long as he dares to show up, any of us three can kill him.” Lin Dong sneered.

Jian Wushuang and Mo You also showed a smile at the words.

In less than half a day, the sergeants of the Seventh Army wiped off all the remaining experts of the Red Water Alliance in the city.

After that, Jian Wushuang and other two Divine Generals led the Seventh Army to the second city under the control of the Red Water Alliance.

With the fall of the Universe Gods, the Red Water Alliance existed in name only, and its power was crumbled. Many Universe Masters and Holy Masters withdrew from the alliance, leaving it with only a few loyal men.

Led by Universe Master Bei, those loyal people had fought against the Seventh Army in the first city. Now, without that master, they could barely organize another resistance again.

Therefore, they would be easily eliminated.

In fact, it only took Jian Wushuang and his army no more than two hours to wipe off all the remaining experts of the Red Water Alliance in the second city and set off again.

Three months passed in the blink of an eye.

The headquarters of the Red Water Alliance was in a city named Red Water City—the core place of the alliance.

At that moment, in a hidden underground palace in the Red Water City, two figures sat together chatting.

“Just in three months, the Scarlet Island had swept over the cities under our control. This city the last city they yet to come. During those days, few of our Universe Masters and Holy Masters survived their massacre. Even Universe Master Bei was killed by them.

“Bastard! “Bastard!

“Damn the Scarlet Island!”

One of the two figures was a young man dressed in a luxurious golden robe. He clenched his hands and snarled in a rage with a grave expression.

His handsome face was twisted with hatred.

“Alas!”

On hearing the young man’s roars, the other man, a humpbacked, black-robed elder, sighed before saying, “The Scarlet Island is so powerful that none could contend with it in our region except for the Dayu Palace, Golden-sun Sect, and Holy Prefecture. Our alliance is too weak when compared with it.

“We shouldn’t have combated with it for benefits before!

“We shouldn’t.”

The elder kept shaking his head as he spoke.

“There is no use for us to regret now.” the young man shouted in a low voice.

“You’re right.” The black-robed elder looked at the young man and continued, “Young Master, we should leave the Dayu Region as soon as possible. I have everything prepared for us in the somewhere else.”

“Leave?” The young man trembled and asked, “Elder Li, are we really going to leave here?”

“The Dayu Region has no place for us now. We have to go and even if we leave, it will be lucky if the Scarlet Island won’t hunt us where we go.” the elder answered.

“Scarlet Island!” The young man’s eyes became chilling. “Alright, I’ll leave with you but not in secret. I’ll have the Red Water Alliance pay for what they have done.”

“Young Master, what do you mean?” The elder looked at the young man.

“The Scarlet Island has three Divine Generals in the army against us this time, right?” the young said with a cold smile.

“Lin Dong and Mo You have stayed in the Scarlet Island for many years and won a big fame. As for Jian Wushuang, who has emerged recently, he may be less famous but is powerful enough to have killed Universe Master Bei alone. If we can kill them three, it will be a great loss even to the Scarlet Island. After all, Divine Generals are fewer than the Universe Gods here.”

“Young Master, you want to kill those three Divine Generals?” The elder frowned.

“Right.” The young man nodded with a cold face. “And I’ll need your help. I want you to kill them in person. After you succeed, we’ll leave here before the Scarlet Island could react. By then, they won’t be able to even lay a finger on us.”

Upon hearing this, the elder pondered for a moment before heavily nodding his head with his eyes sparkling.

This elder, in fact, was a Universe God.
