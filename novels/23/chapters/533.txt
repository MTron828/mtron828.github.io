Chapter 534: The Breaches

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Thousands of Demonic Beasts had entered the Formation and were releasing violent auras, both strong and weak.

The strong ones were Rank Seven or Rank Eight Monsters, while the weak ones included Demonic Beasts that were still in the Saint Realm.

A stream of Demonic Beasts were swarming into the Formation through the breach. Fortunately, the?breach was not large and it took the Demonic Beasts a while to rush through it. Otherwise, many more Demonic Beasts would have passed through the breach.

“Kill all these Demonic Beasts!” Fang Han shouted coldly.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

There were ten 100-soldier squads in the Seventh Army, and even the weakest sergeants were at the Six-cloud Realm, while the squad leaders were First-grade Divine Generals. The battle strength of the Seventh Army was naturally quite impressive.

“Humans!”

The Demonic Beasts inside the Formation sensed the arrival of the Seventh Army sergeants. Violent aura rose from them and darkened the whole sky.

“Kill these humans,” a Demonic Beast roared in human language.

“Howl...”

With deafening roars, the Demonic Beast furiously rushed towards the sergeants.

“Kill them!”

“Kill! Kill! Kill!”

“Kill them and take their Monster Cores!”

The sergeants looked at the Demonic Beasts excitedly. It wasn’t long before both sides collided, causing a fierce and crazy fight to break out.

Swoosh!

A faint sword shadow suddenly flashed through the area, so quickly that it was impossible to follow it’s trail.

The sword shadow easily penetrated a Rank Seven Monster, then flashed toward a Rank Six Monster behind it and penetrated it before it could respond. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Someone killed a Rank Seven and Rank Six Monster with one sword move. Naturally, it was Jian Wushuang.

“Every one of these beasts represents a Monster Core!”?Jian Wushuang stared at them coldly.

He showed no mercy to the Demonic Beasts, using his Killing Moves without hesitation.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Bright sword lights constantly lit up the area as Jian Wushuang ran through the battlefield and killed Demonic Beasts left and right with his sword.

The Demonic Beasts, no matter strong or weak, meant nothing to Jian Wushuang now because he could easily kill a Rank Seven Monster. Even a Rank Eight Monster could only manage to parry one or two of his attacks. In fact, he was slaughtering the Demonic Beasts like lambs.

In the short span of a single moment, he had killed over 20 Demonic Beasts.

“Jian Wushuang.” Suddenly, he heard a voice coming from his side.

“Oh? Fang Han?” Jian Wushuang turned and realized it was Fang Han, the commander of the Seventh Army.

“What’s up?” Jian Wushuang asked coldly.

“Jian Wushuang, I had some conflicts with you before, but that’s between you and me. Right now, fighting the Demonic Beasts is our top priority. I hope you can put what happened before aside and follow my command,” Fang Han said seriously.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and glanced at Fang Han. He could see the sincerity in Fang Han’s eyes, so he nodded and said, “You’re the commander. As long as your command is fair, I’ll naturally obey it.”

“That’s good.”

Fang Han nodded and said, “I know you have an amazing and powerful Realm Technique. The Seventh Army has the upper hand in fighting the Demonic Beasts for now, but we aren’t strong enough to crush them completely. Your Realm Technique should have a great effect on the battle. Please use it.”

“Okay,” Jian Wushuang didn’t refuse.

Even if Fang Han had not commanded it, he had already planned to use it.

With a thought from Jian Wushuang, a vast rumbling Blood River immediately surged forward.

It was accompanied by an invisible wave of Sword Essence, covering the whole battlefield in an instant.

“Realms, suppress!”

Jian Wushuang shouted in a low voice as the vast Blood River Realm directly suppressed the Demonic Beasts.

Every Demonic Beast was subjected to a tremendous oppression.

The higher-rank Demonic Beasts could resist?to some extent, but they were still greatly restrained.

The weaker ones at the Saint Realm or Cloud Realm were forced to kneel down. They could not even raise their heads.

“This is...”

The sergeants of the Seventh Army were stunned and then looked at Jian Wushuang in astonishment.

“What are you waiting for? Go kill them!” Jian Wushuang shouted.

These sergeants finally came to themselves. They rushed forward to kill the Demonic Beasts while filled with joy and excitement.

“Haha, brothers, let’s go kill them!”

“Kill them. Kill all these Demonic Beasts!”

“Guard the breach and stop the other Demonic Beasts from entering!”

“Kill the Demonic Beasts and claim their Monster Cores!”

Shouts of the Seventh Army sergeants sounded throughout the whole battlefield.

They already had the upper hand in the fight against the Demonic Beasts. With the assistance of Jian Wushuang’s Realm, they had an absolute advantage over them now. The Demonic Beasts became easy targets for the sergeants who were only thinking about how to get more Monster Cores.

The Demonic Beasts were struggling, but it was in vain.

In a moment, the thousand Demonic Beasts which had swarmed inside the Formation were killed and the breach had also been completely blocked.

Though the breach had not recovered completely, it was so small that it was hard for a Demonic Beast to break through it. A single 100-soldier squad was sufficient to block the breach.

“Eighth squad, guard the breach. Everyone else, follow me and to support the other battlefields,” Fang Han said loudly.

The other nine squads, led by Fang Han, marched toward the other battlefields.

“Help, help. A large breach appeared in Zone No. 14. Thousands of Demonic Beasts have entered and we’re being overwhelmed!”

A message for help suddenly came and the voice was anxious.

“Zone No. 14 belongs to the Sixth Army. It’s not far away from us.” Fang Han narrowed his eyes slightly after receiving the message.

“Go to Zone No. 14 immediately.”
