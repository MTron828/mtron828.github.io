“I see,” Jian Wushuang understood, “This girl, why didn’t she tell me she was in trouble?”

Qiu Yue was Jian Wushuang’s maidservant and she had Jian Wushuang’s communication token.

During the time she was training, Jian Wushuang would send her messages to ask about her progress occasionally.

Qiu Yue could totally send him a message about what happened or just use his name when she was caught in Parting Hatred Island. Then, Parting Hatred Island wouldn’t dare to do anything.

However, Qiu Yue didn’t. She had only said that she was from Lineage of Star.

“Elder Wu Liang, please send a message to Parting Hatred Island. Tell them that Lineage of Star will send an expert over to discuss it. Tell them to not touch a single strand of Qiu Yue’s hair before the expert from Lineage of Star arrive,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Alright. As long as we of Lineage of Star command it, Parting Hatred Island won’t have the guts to lay a finger on Qiu Yue,” Elder Wu Liang smiled, “Oh yeah, why don’t I send a deacon elderly over to take care of this? Or I’ll head over myself?”

“It’s alright,” Jian Wushuang shook his head, “I’ll go.”

“You’ll go?” Elder Wu Liang stared.

Parting Hatred Island wasn’t a great force within Purple Moon Sanctuary. They were merely had two Chaotic Real Gods. Lineage of Star could send any deacon elderly over and bring Qiu Yue back easily.

Jian Wushuang was in such a distinguished position?!

“Go and send the message. I’ll depart now.”

Jian Wushuang didn’t delay but departed in the direction of the Parting Hatred Island sect. On the other hand, Elder Wu Liang sent a message to Parting Hatred Island as instructed by Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang only took a few days time to reach Parting Hatred Island via wormhole.

“This is Parting Hatred Island?” Jian Wushuang overlooked a huge island covered by a formation.

Even though it was only a second-grade force in the ten sanctuaries, the sect looked quite dignified.

Jian Wushuang’s body turned illusionary and appeared before Parting Hatred Island’s entrance. There were a few disciples guarding at the entrance.

“Please report to your higher-ups that Jian Wushuang from Lineage of Star is here to visit,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Please hang on a moment,” the registered disciples of Parting Hatred Island were only Universe Gods. They weren’t experienced and they had never heard of Jian Wushuang’s name.

However, they should be able to tell that Jian Wushuang was a Real God. As a Real God came to visit personally, they couldn’t behave sloppily and immediately went into the island to report.

Jian Wushuang wasn’t in a hurry and was waiting patiently at the entrance. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

With his power, he could totally barge into Parting Hatred Island and bring Qiu Yue away forcibly. The experts in Parting Hatred Island definitely wouldn’t dare to say a word. After all, Jian Wushuang was from Lineage of Star and he had to keep Lineage of Star’s reputation and appearance.

Lineage of Star wasn’t barbaric like Soaring Heaven King Palace.

In Parting Hatred Island, an elderly in a red robe was casually walking around.

“Greetings, elder,” the registered disciple who walked past bowed politely at him.

“Mm,” the elderly in a red robe nodded faintly and he was happy.

Just then, the disciple who came in to report sped past. When he saw the elderly in a red robe, he quickly moved over.

“Elder Dong, there’s a mister outside who said that he is here to visit,” the disciple was polite.

“Mister?” The elderly in a red robe looked at the disciple.

“He is a Real God and he said that he is from Lineage of Star. His name is Jian Wushuang, I think,” the disciple said.

“Who, you said?” At first, the elderly in a red robe was very calm but his eyes suddenly shot open and his voice became excited, “Are you sure you didn’t hear wrongly? Is he really Jian Wushuang?”

“Yes, I’m sure,” the disciple was shocked but he replied determinedly.

The elderly in a red robe immediately gasped a breath of cold air and muttered, “There are countless cultivators in Eternal Chaotic World and there are also many named Jian Wushuang. However, a Jian Wushuang from Lineage of Star… there’s only one.”

“It’s that monster?”

The elderly in a red robe looked terrified, “Quick, follow me to welcome him.”

“Yes,” the disciples immediately nodded.

“Hold on,” the elderly in a red robe suddenly paused, “Wait here. Let me inform the island master. We will all go to welcome him together when island master and the rest come.”

The elderly in a red robe knew clearly how big of a figure Jian Wushuang was.

He had the fighting power of an Almighty!

Such a super expert had come to visit Parting Hatred Island, it was simply bringing radiance to their humble sect.

He, of course, couldn’t welcome such a great expert alone.

As the elderly in a red robe reported the news, the entire Parting Hatred Island shook.

The master of Parting Hatred Island, including the three vice masters and a bunch of experts on the island, came to welcome him altogether.

Outside the island, Jian Wushuang saw a huge crowd walking over after waiting for a while. There were at least twenty to thirty of them and they were all Real Gods. The one leading them was, of course, the master of Parting Hatred Island.

“Such a big crowd,” Jian Wushuang smiled but he wasn’t surprised.

The crowd came before Jian Wushuang very quickly.

“Master of Parting Hatred Island greets Mister Jian Wushuang,” the master of Parting Hatred Island bowed politely.

The Real Gods behind him greeted and bowed at Jian Wushuang politely to show their respect.

“You are too courteous,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Mister Jian Wushuang, follow me into the island and we can talk,” the master of Parting Hatred Island invited.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded. Then, he entered Parting Hatred Island under the lead of the master of Parting Hatred Island himself.

As they walked in, the experts in Parting Hatred Island lifted their head to steal glances at Jian Wushuang. There was excitement and reverence in their eyes.

As for Jian Wushuang, they had heard long ago that he had fought with Soaring Heaven King Palace in the Eighth Lair and they had suffered a great loss. He had even inflicted a severe injury on Sir God Qian Lan from Soaring Heaven King Palace.

Besides, during the battle, Jian Wushuang killed many top Chaotic Real Gods from Soaring Heaven King Palace.

To Parting Hatred Island, any top Chaotic Real God wasn’t one that they could offend easily. However, Jian Wushuang had massacred top Chaotic Real Gods like he was slaughtering chickens.

Such a superb existence could destroy Parting Hatred Island countless times with a wave.

Very soon, Jian Wushuang arrived in the discussion hall of Parting Hatred Island. At the highest position of the hall, he sat side by side with the master of Parting Hatred Island. The master of Parting Hatred Island might even be slightly lower.

“Mister Jian Wushuang, I wonder what’s the purpose of your visit to Parting Hatred Island?” The master of Parting Hatred Island asked politely.

“I really came for a purpose,” Jian Wushuang smiled. “Not long ago, there was someone from Lineage of Star that killed a few disciples of Parting Hatred Island. Now, she is held by the experts of Parting Hatred Island and imprisoned in Parting Hatred Island. I came here today, for her.”

Jian Wushuang expressed his intention straightforwardly.
