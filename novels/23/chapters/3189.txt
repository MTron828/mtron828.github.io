Jian Wushuang was smiling on the surface, but he was secretly sighing in his heart. “As expected of an expert who is infinitely close to the level of an Invincible Saint. Three drops of cold blood venom were fused into my Blood Mountain Sword at the same time, but I can’t kill him in one strike.”

Previously, Jian Wushuang could kill the leaders of ordinary peak rank seven True Saints of the thirteen axes with one strike.

The three drops of cold blood poison in the Blood Mountain Sword were enough to erode all the divine power in the opponent’s body.

However, when he killed Violent Bear just now, he could not kill Violent Bear with just one strike, so he had to use the void annihilation technique again!

“Now, I only need one strike to kill a peak rank seven True Saint, but I need two strikes to kill an infinite number of experts close to the Invincible Saint Realm,” Jian Wushuang thought.

There was no other way. The cold blood poison was the highest level of poison that Jian Wushuang could exchange for in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

It was even higher than the cold blood poison. Just one drop of it was enough to kill an Invincible Saint, or even a real Invincible Saint. There was indeed poison in the treasure pavilion of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, but it was beyond the scope of what Jian Wushuang could exchange for.

After all, he was only a heaven-level member in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, and he could only exchange for treasures within the range of heaven-level members.

Only emperor-level members were qualified to exchange for poison that was higher than cold blood.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis!”

A shrill, low voice suddenly came out of Blood Eagle’s mouth. “If you have the ability, fight me face to face. Don’t hide.”

“A fair and square fight?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. “Fine, I’ll grant your wish!”

As soon as he finished his words, Jian Wushuang immediately moved.

As soon as he moved, the endless power of ice and fire crazily pressed toward Blood Eagle. At the same time, he was intimidated by the divine punishment expert and suppressed by the ice and fire realm, so Blood Eagle’s strength was suppressed by at least 30% .

However, previously, Jian Wushuang and Blood Eagle had a fierce one-on-one fight. At that time, they were evenly matched, and Jian Wushuang even had a slight advantage.

In terms of strength, Jian Wushuang was much stronger than Blood Eagle. Blood Eagle’s brothers had all died, and the magic formation was useless. In such a situation, he was still suppressed by the realm, how could he be Jian Wushuang’s opponent?

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Three low collision sounds were heard. Blood Eagle was instantly sent flying, and his body was in a terrible state.

“Die!”

Blood Eagle’s eyes were bloodshot and his face was filled with madness. He seemed to have really gone mad and wanted to charge at Jian Wushuang again.

However, on the way, Blood Eagle suddenly swung his hand. Whoosh!

The terrifying black light, which contained a thick death aura, shot toward Jian Wushuang again like a meteor.

“This move again?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes focused. Blood Eagle had used this move previously, and it was combined with a soul attack. Even so, he had dodged it head-on.

Now that Blood Eagle had used this move in front of him, it was even more difficult to pose a threat to him.

With a slight sway, Jian Wushuang had already bypassed the black light.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang’s face suddenly darkened. He had discovered that after Blood Eagle had thrown the black light at him, he had immediately rushed towards the surrounding void at the fastest speed he had ever used in his life.

Obviously, Blood Eagle wanted to escape.

“I thought he was really crazy and wanted to avenge his brothers, but now it seems that he is not. Blood EagleXue Ying is very cunning.” Jian Wushuang sneered.

Obviously, Blood Eagle was pretending to be crazy. He did not want to fight with Jian Wushuang because he knew that he could not be Jian Wushuang’s opponent alone, therefore, he had been looking for an opportunity to escape.

Now, he had fled to the side while Jian Wushuang was dodging the black light.

However…

“Blood Eagle, can you escape?”

Jian Wushuang stood in the void and watched Blood Eagle crazily fly around, but he had no intention of stopping or chasing after him.

He just watched quietly.

Not long after Blood Eagle rushed out, he appeared in front of the huge barrier that Jian Wushuang had set up with the ruler seal. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

This barrier had completely sealed off the entire green flame mountain. If the barrier did not collapse, no one would be able to escape.

“Break!”

Blood Eagle let out an angry roar. He held the giant axe with both hands, and endless power and death aura crazily condensed in the axe. Then, the giant axe suddenly swung out.

A terrifying axe shadow struck the barrier in front of him.

Boom!

It was as if a stone had fallen into a calm scene. Under the attack of the axe shadow, the transparent barrier rippled. However, the surface of the lake quickly regained its calm. The barrier was still intact, it was not shaken at all.

“What?” Blood Eagle’s eyes were wide open.

“Haha, Blood Eagle, don’t waste your energy. Even a genuine Invincible Saint would not be able to break this barrier, let alone you. You have no chance of escaping. You’d better follow your brothers obediently.” Jian Wushuang’s hearty laughter was heard, with a flash, he appeared beside Blood Eagle.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Terrifying sword techniques erupted like a landslide and a tsunami, crazily crushing toward Blood Eagle.

Finally, a trace of panic appeared on Blood Eagle’s face.

While blocking Jian Wushuang’s attack, he shouted, “Heavenly Sword Marquis, stop! You’ve already killed 12 of my brothers, and my 13 axes will no longer exist. Why do you have to kill them all?”

“Kill them all?” Jian Wushuang just sneered.

He knew how domineering the 13 axes had been in the nine-wolf mountain range for so many years.

Many countries and even some small sects in the Nine Wolf Mountain Range were under the oppression of the 13 axes. Anyone who dared to disobey the orders of the 13 axes would be uprooted by the 13 axes, just like some small sects, in the hundreds of thousands of years, the 13 axes had killed countless people.

When the 13 axes uprooted those sects, how could they not exterminate them?

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, stop. Spare my life. I can swear that I will never take revenge on you in the future. Although my brothers have some friendship with me, they are them and I am me. If they die, they die,” Blood Eagle said again.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang could not help laughing.

Blood Eagle valued his brothers very much at the beginning. When he killed them one by one, Blood Eagle was obviously very angry. He was not pretending to be angry.

But now, when it was about his death, he immediately separated himself from his brothers..
