In a lofty building of the the Dayu Palace.

“Take a seat.” Master of the Dayu Palace said to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang sat down without any hesitation.

Although there was still a large gap between himself and the Master of the Dayu Palace and Lord Wu Cang, the two Gods treated him in a very respectful way.

“Jian Wushuang, I told you that I would give you a recommendation token to the Snow Dojo if you passed the God Test. Now I have decided to take you there myself.” Lord Wu Cang said.

“Snow Dojo?”

Before the Inverse Cultivation Test, Jian Wushuang was eager to go there.

But now…

“It is unnecessary for you to go there, Jian Wushuang.”

King of Venomous Worms told him, “Although numerous geniuses gather in the Snow Dojo, the place is actually nothing compared to the Eternal Chaotic World and Lineage of Star that you belong to. I recommended you to go there for a period of cultivation before the God Test because at that time you were not powerful enough to go to the Lineage of Star.”

“But now, honestly speaking, if you spend some time cultivating your unique skills, your power can be equal to a Peak Universe God in the Second Heaven. Even when you meet with a Universe God in the Third Heaven, you can survive with your power as well as all the tools you have.”

“Therefore, going to the Snow Dojo is a waste of time for you. You can directly head for the Lineage of Star.

Jian Wushuang was surprised by what King of Venomous Worms said.

But he also knew that what the Snow Dojo could bring him was limited.

And he made a decision.

“Lord Wu Cang.”

Jian Wushuang said, “Thank you for your good will, but I will not go to the Snow Dojo.”

“Aha?” Lord Wu Cang frowned.

And Master of the Dayu Palace was also surprised.

They never expected that Jian Wushuang would turn down their invitation.

After all, the Snow Dojo was the dream of many geniuses – including Qing Yang Universe God, who failed because Lord Wu Cang didn’t think he was qualified for the opportunities.”

“Think twice please.” Lord Wu Cang said, “Though you are talented, you need a good environment, the guidance of other talents and plenty of resources to help you in the Inverse Cultivation.”

Master of the Dayu Palace added, “Jian Wushuang, Lord Wu Cang seldom provides such a good opportunities to others. And you can also unleash your potential in the Snow Dojo. Don’t be too confident about your power.”

They were both trying to persuade Jian Wushuang. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In their opinion, the Snow Dojo was the best choice of Jian Wushuang.

But Jian Wushuang told them smilingly, “Actually, I am leaving the Dayu Universe for the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries that I am really long for.”

“The Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries?” Master of the Dayu Palace felt surprised at first, but soon understood.

“No wonder you are not going to the Snow Dojo.” Lord Wu Cang smiled.

“The Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries are the core of the Eternal Chaotic World that all cultivators are dreaming of. They are absolutely better than the Snow Dojo. You have great talents and rich potential, even better than many geniuses in the Snow Dojo. So indeed, you’d better go to your dream place.”

Master of the Dayu Palace said, “But not everyone can get there. For example, do you know the route to get there?”

Jian Wushuang had no idea.

After all, it hadn’t been long since he left his hometown, the Green Fire World.

Even King of Venomous Worms, who was well-informed, had no idea.

Jian Wushuang asked Master of the Dayu Palace and Lord Wu Cang.

But they laughed.

“Although we are privileged in the Snow Kingdom as Universe Gods in the Third Heaven, even we’ve never been to, or planned to go to, the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, which are only a distant legend to us.

“OK…” Jian Wushuang frowned.

How could he go there without know the route?

At that time Lord Wu Cang said, “But I know a guy who has been to the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries and he is in the Snow Dojo.”

Jian Wushuang was interested.

“Could you just wait for me for around ten years and then go with me to the Snow Dojo? I can ask that guy for the route. You don’t have to join the Snow Dojo. It’s all up to you.” Lord Wu Cang proposed.

After hesitation for a while, Jian Wushuang agreed.

“OK, after ten years, when I and Master of the Dayu Palace have finished our current tasks, I will go to your place.”

Jian Wushuang nodded.

“You can stay here in these ten years and I can lend you the Little Scattered Stars Game for you to study.”

“Thank you very much!”
