Chapter 3404: Scheming

Translator: EndlessFantasy TranslationEditor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Understood, goodbye!”

Jian Wushuang bowed and left.

After Jian Wushuang left, the green-robed woman who had brought him into the bamboo forest spoke, “Master, as you guessed, Heavenly Sword Marquis must have come to ask you for help because of his soul.

“Hmph, Iam in this bamboo forest and do not care about worldly affairs. I have almost no contact with the outside world, and I have nothing to do with this Heavenly Sword Marquis. He came to me naturally because he has something to ask of me.”

“And with his status, if it was a normal matter, he could easily solve it. Even if it was a void six realm expert, he should be able to invite him. But since he came to me, it means that the problem he wants me to help solve is something that ordinary void six realm experts can’t solve. Then naturally, it can

only be a matter of the soul.” Spirit Ancestor sneered.

“What master said is extremely true. However, can the conditions set by master be achieved by the Heavenly Sword Marquis? No matter what, he is only a saint, right?” The green-robed woman said.

“It is true that he is a saint, but don’t forget that when he was on the Saha Island, he was only at the saint level when he single-handedly injured the Flame Saint Master and the Sorcerer God. Of course, he used some special methods, but it still can explain a lot of problems,” Spirit Ancestor said calmly.

“Tve always been very accurate in judging people. This Heavenly Sword Marquis was able to make such a big name in the Divine Beginning Realm as a Saint, so he’s definitely not ordinary. His background, his talent, and his potential in the future are simply not what we can imagine. Especially just now,

when he faced me directly, he even dared to look directly into my eyes. During that time, I didn’t feel the slightest bit of fear from him!

“I know that I’m best at the soul, and I can silently annihilate a cultivator’s soul, but this Heavenly Sword Marquis doesn’t seem to be worried at all. It’s as if even if I secretly attack him, I won’t be able to cause him any harm. This confidence and boldness is something that even many powerful void fifth

stage experts don’t possess!”

“Other than that, there’s also the most important point…”

“Which point?” The green-robed woman looked over.

“I’s the three great Saint Realms. They really place too much importance on him.” A rare smile actually appeared on the Spirit Ancestor’s face. “The three great Saint Realms are such high and mighty existences. Yet, in order to kill a little fellow at the level of a saint, they actually went to such great

lengths. Even the three great Saint Masters and even the Sorcerer God made a move. How much importance do they place on him?

“To be able to make the three great Saint Realms disregard everything, it can only mean one thing. The three great Saint Realms sensed an incomparably great threat from this little fellow. This threat is something that no one can compare to. Even our Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect and the other two great

Freedom Alliances are far from being able to force the three great Saint Realms to make such a big move.”

“Even the three great Saint Realms are like this. That northem borer is only the blood clan’s grandmaster. In front of the three great Saint Realms, what is he?”

“Is that so?” The green-robed woman nodded heavily. She clearly understood in her heart.

“Northern borer… wish I could tear him into pieces. Unfortunately, his strength and identity are all there. If I wanted to kill him, it would be too difficult. I can’t ask a ruler-level expert to help. However, Heavenly Sword Marquis can be said to be my last chance!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“I don’t hope that Sword Heavenly Marquis can rush to the blood clan and kill northern borer right now, but since he wants me to help him strip his wife’s soul, then for his wife’s sake, he will definitely work hard. As long as he has enough strength, he will definitely help.” Spirit Ancestor smiled faintly.

“But master, what if that Heavenly Sword Marquis invites another void sixth stage expert who specializes in the soul?” The green-robed woman asked with a frown.

“Haha, how can it be that easy?” Spirit Ancestor’s smile grew even wider. “To strip a cultivator of his soul without harming his soul in the slightest, to allow him to have the foundation to completely recover, the ability to control his soul is extremely high. The slightest carelessness will only result in the

annihilation of his soul. The person that Heavenly Sword Marquis wants to strip his soul is his wife. He absolutely does not dare to take the slightest risk. He must have absolute confidence before taking action!

“Although I don’t care about the affairs of the world, I have a deep understanding of the experts in the Divine Beginning Realm. In the Divine Beginning Realm, there are only two people who have absolute confidence in doing this. One of them is me, and the other is the grandmaster of the Nine-tailed

Clan. However, the Heavenly Sword Marquis has a grudge with the grandmaster of the Nine-tailed Clan for killing his daughter. The grandmaster can’t help him, so I’m the only one left!

“That is to say, apart from me, he can’t find anyone else who can help his wife complete the soul stripping without taking any risks!

“If he wants to hire me, he must first kill the northern borer!”

Hearing the words of Spirit Ancestor, the green-robed woman was also stunned.

She did not expect that her master, who usually did not care about the affairs of the world, was actually very good at scheming.

‘When Jian Wushuang came to visit the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect, her master had already planned everything.

Even Jian Wushuang had to find a way to fulfill her master’s conditions for his wife!

Outside the bamboo forest, Jian Wushuang walked out, but his expression was not very good.

“What’s wrong? Did the discussion with Spirit Ancestor not go well?” Demon Master Chenhuo came over to greet him.

“It’s not that it didn’t go well. Spirit Ancestor agreed to help, but her conditions were a little too harsh.” Jian Wushuang frowned and then briefly recounted his conversation with Spirit Ancestor.

“Kill the blood clan grandmaster?”

When he heard the conditions set by Spirit Ancestor, Demon Master Chenhuo could not help but be stunned, “This Spirit Ancestor is really daring. The blood clan patriarch’s strength is probably not inferior to mine. Moreover, he has the entire blood clan behind him. Even a Saint Realm Master would not

have absolute confidence in killing him.”

“That’s right, but that’s Spirit Ancestor’s only condition. It seems that there must be a great hatred between him and the clan leader of the blood clan. Let me ask Temple Master Bai Xing first.” Jian Wushuang immediately sent a message to Temple Master Bai Xing.

Soon, he received the result from Temple Master Bai Xing.

“No wonder Spirit Ancestor wanted to kill northern borer. It turns out that the clan leader of the blood clan once killed Spirit Ancestor’s Dao partner.” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

According to Temple Master Bai Xing, Spirit Ancestor once had a Dao partner and they were very loving. However, during an experiential learning together, they encountered the northern borer, who had not yet become the blood clan grandmaster at that time, in order to fight for the treasure, their

husband was killed by the northern borer.

Spirit Ancestor was almost mad because of this!
