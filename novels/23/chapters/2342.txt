Chapter 2343: The Invitation From The Thunder Sound Sect

In the Meeting Hall.

“Brother Lin, what’re the losses for this battle?” asked Zhuo Yunfeng.

At the talk of losses, Lin Tiefeng’s expression darkened instantly. After some time, he heaved a sigh and said, “The Lin Family’s losses this time are huge. Almost half of all Half Step Divine Demons and Chaotic Realm experts have fallen!”

“Nearly half?”

Everyone in the hall gasped but soon understood the reason.

Indeed, this battle had been too brutal. It was so even before Jian Wushuang made a move. The parties weren’t equal from the beginning and the Lin Family could only rely on having a greater number of weaker Chaotic Realms to make up the difference in strength. This undoubtedly increased the losses. If Jian Wushuang had been a tad slower, few Half Step Divine Demons and Chaotic Realm experts would remain.

However, this wasn’t really the fault of Jian Wushuang as he had stepped in at a rather early stage.

At least, it seemed that way to him.

After all, he had lots of considerations to make.

His greatest concern was the huge ruckus he knew he’d cause once he got involved.

At that time, numerous sects and experts in the Wusha Barren Region had had their eyes on him. This wasn’t something that he wanted.

If it had just been an ordinary relationship, he wouldn’t have stepped in. It was only because he had some connections with the Lin Mansion and his father was clearly friends of life and death with the Lin Family that he had stepped in. However, he had now been pushed into the limelight.

Wusha Barren Region is just a deserted and inconspicuous area. It shouldn’t be an issue even if I’m a little famous here. The high and mighty Masters of Holy Land in the Absolute Beginning Divine World and other supreme experts won’t pay attention to a small place like this. Nonetheless, I should keep a low profile. It’s a shame that I can’t do so even if I want to after this battle! Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

In the hall, everyone was feeling sorry about the Lin Family’s losses.

“After this battle, my Lin Family has suffered greatly. Most likely, we won’t recover in a short period. Fortunately, my Lin Family did not suffer any losses in terms of Divine Demon Realm experts. As long as we have two Divine Demon Realm experts stationed here, my Lin Family will still be one of the six elite families in Anjiu Prefecture,” Lin Tiefeng remarked.

“Also, although my Lin Family has suffered huge losses, Zhuge Family and Xiang Family aren’t in much better shape. Their losses won’t be lower than ours. Furthermore, both of them have lost a Divine Demon Realm expert each. For them, this is definitely a huge blow!”

“After incurring such losses, they won’t attack my Lin Family again unless they are putting everything at stake.”

The surrounding crowd nodded in agreement.

Within Anjiu Prefecture, there wasn’t just the Lin Family, Zhuge Family and Xiang Family. The other three families had been observing the rest carefully.

This time, the other three families hadn’t make a move during the intense battle between the three families. This was because they wouldn’t have stood to gain from it. However, with the three families incurring huge losses, if their conflict escalated further, the other three families would reap the most benefits by keeping out of it.

“Although the two families will start a war with my Lin Family in the short term, they will definitely resent my Lin Family. Also...” Lin Tiefeng looked at Jian Wushuang. “Nephew Wushuang, this crisis is on my Lin Family. However, it’s because of your interference that the two families went home in defeat. Moreover, their losses are largely your doing. Therefore, the two families will definitely pin the blame on you and will even target you.”

Jian Wushuang raised an eyebrow and wasn’t surprised by it.

On the other hand, Zhuo Yunfeng became gloomy.

Sensing the change in expression on Zhuo Yunfeng, Lin Tiefeng said, “Brother Zhuo, you won’t have to worry too much about it. Nephew Wushuang’s strength is clear for all to see. Regardless of if it is the Zhuge Family or the Xiang Family, they will have to think carefully if they want to make a move on Nephew Wushuang. Moreover, you guys are still in my Lin Mansion. If the two families dare to charge in, my Lin Family will fight alongside Nephew Wushuang even if it means death!”

“Even so, Zhuge Family and Xiang Family have been in Anjiu Prefecture for a very long time. Their backgrounds are extremely deep. Zhuge Family is still manageable. The key is Xiang Family. That’s one of the most ancient and most powerful families in Anjiu Prefecture. If Shuang is targeted by the Xiang Family...” Zhuo Yunfeng frowned deeply.

“Governor Zhuo, this is a really easy thing to handle. I have a solution in mind.” The sudden voice came from Fire Fairy who was opposite of Jian Wushuang.

“May I know what Fire Fairy has in mind?” asked Zhuo Yunfeng.

“It’s really simple. With his talent and potential, all the sects in Wusha Barren Region, including the most elite sects, will be free for him to choose from if he wants to join one. In fact, those elite sects might even be willing to pay a high price to recruit him. He could just join one of them and all of this would be solved. He could even request that sect to annihilate the Zhuge Family and Xiang Family on his behalf. I believe those sects won’t reject him,” said Fire Fairy.

“Good idea.” Zhuo Yunfeng’s eyes lit up.

Everyone in the hall nodded in agreement.

Clearly, they felt Fire Fairy was being reasonable.

With Jian Wushuang’s talents, it couldn’t be easier for him to get into some powerful sects. With their protection, the two families in Anjiu Prefecture wouldn’t be able to do anything to Jian Wushuang.

Fire Fairy looked at Jian Wushuang and became humble in attitude and tone.

She was a Chaotic Divine Demon and a core disciple of Thunder Sound Sect, but she couldn’t put on any airs before Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, our Thunder Sound Sect might not be an elite sect in the Wusha Barren Region but we have a long legacy. Over these years, talents have been sprouting up frequently in our Thunder Sound Sect and our influence in the Wusha Barren Region is getting wider and deeper. If you are willing, I can take you to Thunder Sound Sect personally. Moreover, I can assure you that my sect master will take you in and guide you personally. Once you become a Chaotic Divine Demon, you can even take over as the new sect master of our Thunder Sound Sect! Jian Wushuang, are you willing?” Fire Fairy looked at Jian Wushuang in anticipation.

The surrounding crowd was stumped upon hearing Fire Fairy.

They had to admit that the conditions given by Fire Fairy were truly enticing.

Although the Thunder Sound Sect couldn’t be considered a top-notch sect, Jian Wushuang would be personally taught by the sect master! Moreover, he would be the next sect master once he became a Chaotic Divine Demon and enjoy great powers. It was a really enticing offer.

To recruit Jian Wushuang, the Thunder Sound Sect sure was willing to pay a high price.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
