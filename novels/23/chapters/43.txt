Chapter 44: Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“What? You are going to fight against Spirit Beasts in the Gold Core Realm!” Sima Bu looked at Jian Wushuang with astonishment.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Just as water naturally runs downhill, he aspired to fight against stronger Spirit Beasts, ones in the Gold Core Realm, to practice his swordsmanship. It was a fact that Spirit Beasts in the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm couldn’t pose a threat to him.

Despite the big difference between the Gold Core Realm and Transforming Sea Realm, Jian Wushuang was still confident in his strength.

As we all know, the peak of the Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path could rival the Spiritual Power of the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm. With his Sword Arts as well as the Sword Essences of both Gale and Earth, he had the ability to fight with Spirit Beasts in the Gold Core Realm.

“Brother Bu, don’t worry about me. With my current strength, I can fight against the weaker Spirit Beasts in the Gold Core Realm. Even if I can’t beat them, I can escape. If I can’t escape, I can count on you,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

In the past one month, he got along well with Sima Bu, who always gave him references and guidance from nearby when he was fighting with Spirit Beasts. Jian Wushuang appreciated that very much.

“Alright, I still want to remind you that Spirit Beasts in the Gold Core Realm are so powerful that you may be killed by them before I can help you out. You must be careful when you confront them,” Sima Bu advised repeatedly.

“Certainly, I won’t risk my life, ” said Jian Wushuang while smiling. Then he began to search for nearby Spirit Beasts at the Gold Core Realm.

Spirit Beasts at the Transforming Sea Realm in the Dark Forest were everywhere, but those in the Gold Core Realm were rare. During the last month, they only met several Spirit Beasts at the Gold Core Realm, and once meeting them, they chose to escape instead of fighting.

Jian Wushuang searched for them for a long time, but he failed to find one at the Gold Core Realm on the first day. However, he found a Spirit Beast already in the Profound Gold Core Realm the next day. Even though it was barely in the Profound Gold Core Realm, fighting against it was like playing with fire, so he decided to give up.

Jian Wushuang didn’t find a suitable Spirit Beast in the Gold Core Realm to fight with until the third day.

“It’s a Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf!”

Staring at the more than one-meter high, dark-red Devil Wolf, whose whole body seemed to have been bathed in blood, Jian Wushuang desperately desired to fight it.

“Human beings!”

Just like Jian Wushuang, the dark red eyes of the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf also stared at him. Stronger Spirit Beasts are also much wiser. This Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf in the Gold Core Realm was as intelligent as a human being, so it could also feel Jian Wushuang’s burning desire to fight.

“You, a small ant, who has not even reached the Gold Core Realm, how dare you fight with me? Go to hell.”

With a sudden release of all his strength, the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf moved so fast that only a bloody shadow was left in the air.

Wearing a serious look, Jian Wushuang used his long sword against the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf right when its shadow flashed.

Jian Wushuang used a mysterious angle to both stab and block the shadow of the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf as soon as its dark red shadow emerged.

Immediately, an angry howl was released by the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf, accompanied by a wave of sound, easily bouncing his long sword back.

“What?” Jian Wushuang said with astonishment.

A mere howl was able to deflect his Sword Art.

“Aurora Sword Art!”

After a cold humph, Jian Wushuang released all his strength and produced many sword shadows at almost the same time. His Sword Arts, mixed with a trace of Sword Principle of Gale, made the sword shadows flash at lightning speed.

Thump, thump, thump… The sky was almost filled with the whistling sword light.

The Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf suddenly attacked Jian Wushuang with its extremely sharp claws, which seemed to be able to split the void in two.

Peng! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Instantly, all the sword shadows disappeared. At the same time, a formidable force was released from the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf and transmitted to Jian Wushuang through his Long Sword, causing him to shiver unconsciously.

“It’s so powerful that its force alone is enough to block me.” Jian Wushuang looked serious.

“Watch out!” yelled Sima Bu, who was watching and standing in a nearby treetop.

Jian Wushuang instantly noticed that the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf had already opened its mouth, showing its sharp and bloody fangs, and was preparing to bite off his head.

“Fuck off!”

Along with an angry shout, Jian Wushuang moved his Triple-kill Sword to generate a kind of heavy boundlessness. He integrated Sword Essence into his attack and used the Sword Essence of Earth to angrily chop at the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf, finally making it step back.

“Anonymous Sword Art, Blood Shadow!”

With his eyes full of killing intent, Jian Wushuang instantly performed the First Move of the Anonymous Sword Arts.

His use of the Anonymous Sword Art was more powerful after grasping Sword Essence.

The cold and sharp sword light flashed quickly as the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf abruptly lunged at him.

Ding!

A low crash sounded. Then, Jian Wushuang tried to stabilize his body after being repelled.

“Sword-killing Movement!”

Jian Wushuang released his most powerful killing blow without any hesitation.

Showing an angry look in its dark red eyes, the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf suddenly stretched out its cold and sharp claws.

Clang!

A low metal sound crashed, then there was a huge sword scar on the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf’s paw, from which blood continuously poured out. After staring at Jian Wushuang with its dark red eyes, it shrank down into a blood shadow and fled directly into the jungle, where it disappeared.

“It escaped?”

While looking in the direction the Bloody-Moon Devil Wolf fled, Jian Wushuang withdrew his Long Sword and displayed a strange expression.

“Kid, are you okay?” Sima Bu came over to him and asked.

“I’m fine.” Jian Wushuang shook his head, but he couldn’t help looking at his right hand that was holding his Long Sword. Actually, he still felt a shiver in his palm.

“It is worthy of being called a Gold Core Realm Spirit Beast, it’s much more powerful than me. Though I wounded it with my Sword-killing Movement during the fight, it also hurt me with the formidable power from its paws,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

“Kid, you did quite well. You repelled it by using your Sword Arts. As a Spirit Beast at the Gold Core Realm, it is definitely more powerful than you,” Sima Bu said.

“Still not good enough!” Jian Wushuang said without any sense of satisfaction. “My swordsmanship still needs to improve, and I’m not flexible enough when using the Sword Principles of both Gale and Earth. If I could use the Third Move of the Anonymous Sword Arts, or perfectly combined the Sword Principles of Gale and Earth, integrating one into the other, I wouldn’t have panicked in that fight.”

“Alright, let’s continue like this…”

Jian Wushuang continued practicing his swordsmanship while heading towards his destination.

Time flew and three months passed in the blink of an eye.

Jian Wushuang and Sima Bu had spent four months (three months added to the previous month) walking through the Dark Forest before they finally reached the other side.
