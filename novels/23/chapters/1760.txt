Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Get the person behind you to come out. Your Thunder Rolls Palace does not have the resolve and guts to provoke the Soaring Heaven King Palace.”

A cold voice could be heard from Sir God Chi Xing. Although his voice seemed to be soft, it echoed within the minds of everyone present. Moreover, it created waves in their minds and they almost drowned in it.

“What a frightening move, is this a Sir God?” the people present cried out in alarm.

After Sir God Chi Xing’s voice was heard, a crimson-robed figure walked out from the Vientiane Tower normally.

He was carrying a sword. When he appeared, he naturally attracted the attention of everyone present.

Even Sir God Chi Xing could not help but look at him.

“A Real God? A mere Real God can actually exert such a huge amount of pressure on me?” Sir God Chi Xing’s eyes shrank fiercely. After that, he looked at Jian Wushuang’s looks and attire carefully, “Crimson robe, carrying a sword and so young…”

“You are Jian Wushuang!!!”

A voice which contained an infinite amount of coldness could be heard from Sir God Chi Xing and this caused the site to be in a huge uproar.

“Jian Wushuang! He is Jian Wushuang!”

“The number one on the Real God ranking list. The Jian Wushuang who had once competed against an Almighty head-on and even caused that Almighty to suffer huge losses!”

“So it’s him.”

The scene was in a tumult.

The weak could use the names of the strong to protect themselves.

At that time, Jian Wushuang had a great reputation in the Eternal Chaotic World. Although he was only a Real God, none of the Almighties dared to underestimate him.

“Hmph, no wonder the unimpressive Thunder Rolls Palace dares to take the initiative to provoke the Soaring Heaven King Palace. It’s because of you supporting them from the back,” Sir God Chi Xing snorted coldly. His eyes then glowed with lightning and he looked at the Thunder Rolls Palace Master, “Thunder Rolls Palace, how fortunate you are.”

“Sir God Chi Xing.” The Thunder Rolls Palace Master said fearfully, “For the matter this time around, the Thunder Rolls Palace was threatened by Jian Wushuang and we had no choice but to do this. If we have offended you, I, Lei Tao, ask for the forgiveness of Mister Sir God, as well as all of you here who are from the Soaring Heaven King Palace. In addition, I will add on another ten thousand Doctrine Gems as a form of apology.”

The Thunder Rolls Palace Master was extremely sincere and respectful. However, such an attitude from him was expected of by everyone else.

“For this matter which concerns the Thunder Rolls Palace, I will settle it with you after this.” Sir God Chi Xing’s voice was icy-cold and he looked at Jian Wushuang, “Jian Wushuang, you actually dared to come to the Sea Continent alone and also take the initiative to provoke the Soaring Heaven King Palace. You are really very courageous and I wonder, who lent you their courage? Was it the Lineage of Star?”

“However, it’s a pity. In the Sea Continent, even if the Soaring Heaven King Palace were to kill you, the Lineage of Star would probably not dare to say anything.”

“I have come here by myself. In addition, the grudge between me and the Soaring Heaven King Palace is my own matter and it is unrelated to the Lineage of Star.” Jian Wushuang laughed indifferently, “As for my motive this time around, I naturally want to give bad luck to the Soaring Heaven King Palace and you shall be the first expert of the Soaring Heaven King Palace who I kill on my trip this time around!”

“You are merely bragging. Don’t think that just because you wounded Sir God Qian Lan seriously back then, you can really be unafraid of Almighties. The abilities of the Almighties are not as simple as you think and today, I shall let you have a taste of it,” Sir God Chi Xing’s eyes were ice-cold. After his words left his mouth, a frightening aura which belonged to Almighties spread across the area and placed a huge pressure on the whole place.

Countless experts which was inclusive of many Real Gods present almost suffocated under the pressure of the aura.

While these people were extremely shocked, they looked at Jian Wushuang with sympathy.

Jian Wushuang had a great reputation. However, his reputation was still stopped at the point where he injured Sir God Qian Lan seriously.

At that time, many experts in the Eternal Chaotic World only knew about that accomplishment of him. As for later on when he killed His Highness Mu Hong at the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning and when he competed with Sir God Liu Yin in the Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu head-on, those pieces of news did not spread. As for the battle in the Buddhist Demon Sea, no one had seen it.

Naturally… no one knew what Jian Wushuang’s current abilities were and they thought that at that time, Jian Wushuang could at most compete against Sir God Qian Lan.

As for Sir God Chi Xing at the scene, although he had not reached the level of a top Sir God, he was still slightly stronger than Sir God Qian Lan.

If he were to take action personally, would there be a possibility of Jian Wushuang surviving?

“Little kid, die!”

Sir God Chi Xing attacked right away.

He did not move at all. Instead, only the walking stick with a snake’s head that he was holding on to hit the ground and at once, a great amount of Divine Power emerged. At the same time, a vast amount of Dark Power appeared as well.

Hazy black mist burst forth and covered the universe. Within the black mist, swish! All of a sudden, a gigantic black python that was ten thousand feet long appeared with a frightening amount of power.

The black python pierced the void and caused the surrounding space and time to freeze completely. Moreover, in the areas that it passed through, the space cracked open.

Seeing that the black python was heading over, many cultivators, including the Real Gods present, all revealed a terrified expression.

“These are the abilities of an Almighty?”

“It’s too strong. There is almost no way to stop this power.”

“This is the end. No matter what, Jian Wushuang is only a Real God. Even if he is the number one in the Real God ranking list, he will definitely be unable to block this attack.”

Quite a number of people had already cried out in alarm.

However, when Jian Wushuang saw the black python which was heading over, disdain flashed in his eyes.

“Sir God Chi Xing’s abilities are only as such?”

“Too weak.”

“Such a level of attack has no right to even make me draw my sword. It just so happens that I have comprehended a palm skill from the shocking palm that the One-Star Man has left me. Today, I can try using it to test its power.”

Jian Wushuang murmured. When the ten thousand foot long black python came to the void in front of him, some Divine Power emerged from the palm of his right hand and it was filled with an infinite amount of Reincarnation power.

Boom!

He attacked with his palm and the universe went silent.

What the Reincarnation Palm contained seemed to be the perfect Reincarnation Doctrine.

Rumble~~~ A frightening amount of power burst forth and the black python which was originally filled with a great amount of power and was wreaking havoc madly dissipated with a shocking speed the moment it clashed with the palm print of the Reincarnation Palm. As a result of the attack, the giant black python burst open completely and an enormous amount of Divine Power spread in all directions.

As for the Reincarnation Palm, its power did not decrease at all and it continued to head toward Sir God Chi Xing.

“What?”

Sir God Chi Xing opened his eyes wide. Even though he was looking at the giant palm print which was heading toward him, he could not pluck up any power to resist at all.

The giant palm print covered him completely. Without even giving a horrible shriek, Sir God Chi Xing’s body was completely smashed into blood mist and only his walking stick as well as his Qian Kun Ring remained. As for everything else, they had been turned into nothingness.

Sir God Chi Xing, an Almighty of the Soaring Heaven King Palace.

With the flip of a palm, he was killed!Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates
