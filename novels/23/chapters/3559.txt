Chapter 3560: Unexplored Area

Jian Wushuang stopped in the Nine Twists Demon Cave.

“My strength is still too weak. Even if I use the heaven-cleaving skill, my battle strength is only at the pinnacle of the six realm. If I was stronger, I could have killed the Red Eye Master just now,” Jian Wushuang thought.

Yes, his target from the very beginning was Red Eye Master.

As for Shi Yan Master, he was well aware of his strength. He could not pose any threat to Shi Yan Master, but Red Eye Master was different.

Red Eye Master’s soul skills were indeed impressive, but his ability to fight head-on was too weak. Apart from the illusion, ordinary soul attacks and soul crushing attacks had no effect on him, as long as he could get close to the Red Eye Master, he indeed had a chance to kill him.

It was precisely because of this that he was able to rely on the rebound force formed from his battle with the Shi Yan Master to get close to the Red Eye Master.

But unfortunately, he was still a little lacking in the end.

“This Shi Yan Master and the Red Eye Master both come from the North Sea Palace, and the North Sea Palace is definitely one of the top three great forces in this territory. It is said that there are four Ruler Realm experts, far beyond what our Star Palace can compare to.”

“Because the North Sea Palace is strong, the experts of the North Sea Palace are very arrogant. When they were adventuring in the three Universe Battlefields, they were very overbearing. However, master stone loathsome and Red Eye Master have suffered a great loss in my hands. With their usual style of doing things, I’m afraid they won’t let this matter go,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

He had almost killed the Red Eye Master, so it would be strange for them to give up in front of the Shi Yan Master.

“I’m not afraid of these two alone, but the North Sea Palace behind them...” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and shrugged. “I had planned to explore the Nine Twists Demon Cave for a while and then go to the special space-time that I found in the Xue Bei. But now it seems that I have to give up.”

Jian Wushuang had made up his mind and immediately flew out of the Nine Twists Demon Cave along the star map.

The Devil Smoke Valley was too big. Even though Jian Wushuang was traveling at full speed, it still took him three years to leave the area of the Nine Twists Demon Cave. After that, it took him another 16 years, only then did Jian Wushuang come to the unexplored area at the core of the Devil Smoke Valley.

As the name implied, the unexplored area was a place that had never been explored before.

Only a small part of the great Devil Smoke Valley had been explored, and most of the places belonged to the unexplored area.

Most of the territory at the core of Devil Smoke Valley also belonged to the unexplored area. Over the years, experts from various forces in the various star worlds in this territory would often go to these unexplored areas to explore, however, because they did not know what was ahead and what they would encounter, it was naturally extremely dangerous. However, there were more opportunities in these unexplored areas.

“Dark cyan, a precipice that is over 100,000 feet tall. It should be here.” Jian Wushuang looked at the precipice in front of him. This precipice was 100,000 feet tall and its entire body was dark cyan. In the middle of the precipice, there was a small gap, the gap was very narrow, but it was enough for a cultivator to pass through.

“Xue Bei entered the unknown region through the gap in the middle of the cliff.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and carefully looked at the star map left by Xue Bei. After confirming that the cliff in front of him was the place Xue Bei had mentioned, he immediately moved toward the gap in the middle of the cliff. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

When he entered the crack in the cliff, two Principles Masters happened to pass by and saw Jian Wushuang.

“Who is that person? How could he choose to enter the unknown region from there?” One of the Principles Masters, who was wearing a red robe, asked curiously.

“He looks like the Blood Sword Master who just rose up not long ago. I heard that he appeared in the Nine Twists Demon Cave. I didn’t expect that he would come here again and go directly into the unknown region.” The other elder with a child’s face and white hair also stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Tsk, tsk. This Blood Sword Master is quite bold. The unknown region is full of dangers, and most of the dangers are unpredictable. It can be said that life and death are purely dependent on luck. How long has it been since he came to the Universe Battlefield? Isn’t he a bit too eager to go directly into the unknown region?” The Principles Master said in a red robe.

“Who knows? However, those who dare to venture into the unexplored regions are usually desperadoes. Many people are forced to go into the unexplored regions to search for great opportunities. For example, many people who are stuck at the same level and unable to break through for a long time can only enter the unexplored regions to gamble for a tiny chance of breaking through. Who knows, they might find great opportunities there and break through?” said the elder with a youthful face and white hair.

“Haha, how can it be so easy to find such great opportunities? In any case, you and I don’t have that much pressure. There’s no need for us to gamble our lives there.” The red-robed Principles Master laughed.

What the two of them were talking about was actually the understanding of the experts from the various powers in the various astral realms toward the unexplored regions.

Within the three great battlefields, the unexplored regions were filled with great opportunities, but they were also filled with even more dangers. Even a Ruler Realm expert roaming within the unexplored regions would die if he wasn’t careful, much less an ordinary Principles Master, therefore, very few people dared to venture into the unexplored regions within this territory.

At the very least, those experts who had lived a comfortable life would not venture into the unexplored regions. There were only some who had no attachments or had reached a bottleneck in their strength and were unable to break through even after a long period of time, in order to find a chance to break through, they ventured into the unexplored regions.

In addition, some people who were forced by their enemies had no choice but to try their luck in the unknown region.

After all, the risks in the unknown region were too great.

Because of this, when they saw Jian Wushuang entering the unknown region to explore, they said that Jian Wushuang was brave.

However, they did not know that Jian Wushuang was not the kind of person who was impatient to live or could not improve his strength and could only try his luck in the unknown region. On the contrary, he had unlimited possibilities and his strength had been improving, however, the reason why he entered the unknown region was because Xue Bei had already paved the way for him. As long as he followed the star map left by Xue Bei, he could find the special space-time.

According to Xue Bei, the special space-time definitely contained an incredible opportunity.

Jian Wushuang had to go to such a place!
