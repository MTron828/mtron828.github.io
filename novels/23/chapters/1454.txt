The second level was made of Real Gods who comprehended a slight bit of Power of Heaven Way and also Universe Gods in the Third Heaven who had high comprehension power towards Power of Heaven Way and were extremely powerful.

In Sky Sword Prison, most of the cultivators were at the third or the fourth level. There were very few who were at the second level.

As for the first level… They were at the highest level in Sky Sword Prison, a bunch of experts who were on the top.

There were only four people in the bunch of people. The four of them were referred to as the Four Kings. They were the epitome of unrivaled.

According to Luo Meng’s understanding of the Four Kings, they were all Real Gods that were extremely strong in power. They had extremely high comprehension power towards Power of Heaven Way. It was said that they had reached the level of the Doctrine Palace.

“Doctrine Palace?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“Jian Wushuang, Doctrine Palace is a place in the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries to examine one’s comprehension power towards Power of Heaven Way. Out of the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, each and every one of them have one Doctrine Palace and there are nine levels in the Doctrine Palace. Every level represents a different level of comprehension.”

“Regardless of if you are comprehending the Nine Heaven God Doctrine or the Supreme Four Doctrine, the Doctrine Palace could precisely determine your comprehension level. The first level of Doctrine Palace, although it was only the first level, would require an extremely high level of comprehension power.”

“Like yourself, although you comprehended a slight bit of Power of Heaven Way, it is merely at the beginner level. You are far from passing through the first level of Doctrine Palace. Even Zhao Han, who fought against you in the boundless void previously, his comprehension of Myriad Beast Doctrine is higher than your comprehension of Reincarnation Doctrine. However, he is also far from passing through the first level of Doctrine Palace.”

“The four Kings, as they possess the standard of comprehension towards Power of Heaven Way of the first level in Doctrine Palace, even if they could only perform divine power capped at the level of Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven, they could still carry out their capability as Real Gods. It should be extremely easy to kill the current you,” King of Venomous Worms’ voice was heard in Jian Wushuang’s head.

Jian Wushuang kept quiet.

“According to the token, my current power should only be on the third level,” Jian Wushuang sighed.

The third level was made of Real Gods who were weaker and created Real God unique skills, and also Universe Gods in the Third Heaven who comprehended the power of Heaven Way.

Jian Wushuang also comprehended a slight bit of Power of Heaven Way but he had yet to create any Real God unique skills. He was really on the third level and it wasn’t the top of the third level.

“Universe Gods who comprehended the Power of Heaven Way. If they were in Eternal Chaotic World, they would be listed on the Universe God ranking list. It is rare to see any in the outside world. However, in Sky Sword Prison, there are a total of ten Universe Gods who have comprehended the Power of Heaven Way? So many of them!” Jian Wushuang was amazed.

“Humph, over so years, there have been so many Universe Gods in the Third Heaven who are imprisoned and in such a mad massacre environment where the fittest survive, it’s no surprise that it gives birth to many experts who possess fighting power like one on the Universe God ranking list,” King of Venomous Worms scoffed, “Jian Wushuang, I remind you to not be puzzled by the surface phenomena. Even in the Ten Cultivation sanctuaries, although the Universe God ranking list has gathered the top Universe Gods experts, the experts are only those who have revealed their capability and stepped into the limelight.”

“However, in the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries and the entire expanse of Eternal Chaotic World, among the countless Holy Kingdoms, there are many experts. They possess fighting power like one on the Universe God ranking list but they never once reveal their power, nor do they seek fame, just like yourself. You possess the fighting power of one on Universe God ranking list but you are not on the list.”

“You mean that there are many Universe Gods in a similar state to me in Eternal Chaotic World?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

“Of course. In Sky Sword Prison itself, aren’t there a dozen of them?” King of Venomous Worms said. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Jian Wushuang understood.

After having a brief understanding of the experts in Sky Sword Prison, Jian Wushuang sighed with emotion.

“After all, Sky Sword Prison was created by the owner of Sky Sword Mountain and the owner of Sky Sword Mountain already knew that I was a disciple of Star Palace but still imprisoned me. He naturally isn’t afraid of Lineage of Star, hence… Even if Lineage of Star has already found out that I’m imprisoned in Sky Sword Prison, they won’t be able to rescue me in a short period of time.

“Plus, I must take the best and the worst situation into consideration. I can’t place all my hopes on Lineage of Star. I must also rely on myself!”

“The owner of Sky Sword Mountain set a rule that, as long as I can kill a hundred Universe Gods in the Third Heaven, or even ten Real Gods, I can leave. That’s also my way out.”

Jian Wushuang knew that there should be quite a number of Universe Gods and Real Gods who left from Sky Sword Prison for the past years.

Of course, he wished that he was one of them.

“However, I have just arrived in Sky Sword Prison and I am not at the top of the chain in power within Sky Sword Prison. It is impossible for me to kill a hundred Universe Gods immediately and leave here. I can only take my time. Before that, I have to set foot in Sky Sword Prison steadily,” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists.

With his current ability, it wasn’t difficult for him to keep his footing in Sky Sword Prison.

After all, he possessed a divine body of Real God level. His Blood-killing Plate Armor had strong defense power too. As long as he didn’t encounter any experts of the second and the first level, he shouldn’t be in a life-threatening situation. Most importantly, compared to other experts in Sky Sword Prison, he was at an advantage.

It was that he possessed Soul Power!

His Soul Power coverage was wide, far beyond that of Real Gods’. Once he launched his Soul Power, no matter which invisibility means one was using, one would be exposed. No matter who it was, once someone appeared around him, he could notice at the first instant and identify the person’s power.

If he were to come across anyone who was strong and he was unable to deal with, he could totally avoid them.

Then, Jian Wushuang was put in an advantageous position. He would be able to make trouble with others, but it was impossible for the others to surprise attack him.

Just like when Luo Meng who once surprise attacked him, Jian Wushuang had noticed him long ago.

“Let’s begin. I shall see just how strong the prisoners in Sky Sword Prison are.”

With a tinge of excitement, Jian Wushuang started wandering in Sky Sword Prison.

…

Sky Sword Mountain, under the nine lofty sword mountains, there was a secluded cave dwelling.

In the cave dwelling, there was a person carrying three longswords, a middle-aged man who was like an enduring, ferocious sword, sat there with his eyes closed.

Suddenly, the middle-aged man’s eyes shot open. The moment he opened his eyes, there was an explosion of sword intention.

The middle-aged man waved his hand. Wow! The void before him became distorted and there was another middle-aged man that appeared before him.

Although the figure was blurry, Jian Wushuang could definitely recognize at the first glance that it was Hall Master Yuan from Lineage of Star.
