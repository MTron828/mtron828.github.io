Chapter 3048: ‘The Peerless Sword Technique’

——

Time passed quickly. A hundred years passed by quickly.

Xue Bei slowly opened his eyes in the huge palace. He glanced at the stone in his palm. A crack had already appeared in the middle of the stone, and the crack was still expanding.

“The time is up. I wonder how the little guy got in the Bodhi World?” Xue Bei murmured.

The Bodhi World was originally a world where birds sang and flowers were fragrant, like a paradise.

But now…boom!

Purple-brown thunder suddenly streaked across the sky, and it did not disappear for a long time. It seemed to have completely consumed half of the world.

The world began to tremble crazily.

“Is it going to collapse?”

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged in the thatched cottage. He felt the changes in the world and slowly opened his eyes.

There was a trace of regret in his eyes.

He had no choice. The opportunities in the Bodhi World were too helpful to him.

In the past 100 years, he had not wasted a single second. He had spent all his time comprehending those sword skills, but even so, the sword skills he saw were not even one-thousandth of the entire Bodhi World.

However, the Bodhi World was about to collapse.

“Forget it. Although I can’t go through all the sword skills in the Bodhi World, in the past 100 years, I have created five sword skills, namely Canyang, Emperor’s Blood Kill, Instant of Life and Death, Ninth Heaven of Illusory Sword, and the Strongest Blood Asura. In addition to the two sword skills, Xi Xiang and Star Dream, I have created a total of seven sword skills!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining.

His cultivation had not improved in the past 100 years, and his comprehension of the rules had not improved at all. All of the improvement was in sword principle and sword skill.

First was the sword principle. Not long ago, the boundless sword tree in his body had only reached 6,600 feet. Now, after 100 years, the boundless sword tree in his body had grown again. Now, it had reached 9,900 feet. When it came to time sword skill…the power of swordsmanship had once again risen to a new level.

As for absolute arts…swordsmanship absolute arts were Jian Wushuang’s greatest gains in the past 100 years.

Canyang, Emperor Blood Kill, Instant of Life and Death, Ninth Heaven of Illusionary Sword, and Blood Asura. Jian Wushuang had created a total of five swordsmanship moves in the past 100 years. Each sword move was perfectly integrated with the space-time principles, like the two sword moves of Xi Xiang and Star Dream, they were both embryonic forms of sword skills.

And all five of them had reached the level of rank four absolute arts.

The two moves of Xi Xiang and Star Dream had also reached the level of rank four absolute arts in the past 100 years.

In other words, a total of seven embryonic forms of sword skills had been created, and all of them had reached the level of rank four absolute arts!

Each of the seven moves had its own characteristics and functions. The seven moves of swordsmanship had formed complete swordsmanship!

Even the name of the swordsmanship had been decided by Jian Wushuang. It was called the ‘Wushuang Sword Manual’.

The ‘Wushuang Sword Manual’ was named after Jian Wushuang himself. It was a type of swordsmanship that he had personally created and was most suitable for himself. In the next long period of time, the ‘Wushuang Sword Manual’ would accompany him and grow together!

Jian Wushuang was already quite satisfied to be able to create a complete sword art within a short 100 years.

Moreover, among the sword arts that he had created, the ‘Blood Asura’ move surprised him even more!

“The Bodhi World is about to collapse. It’s time for me to go out.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and slowly stood up.

Rumble! The huge and magical Bodhi World finally collapsed completely.

Although the world collapsed, it did not affect Jian Wushuang. After a series of changes, Jian Wushuang returned to the huge palace. Standing in front of him were Xue Bei and Gu Lao.

“Little guy, it’s been 100 years. You must have gained a lot in the Bodhi World.” Xue Bei looked at him.

“I did.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“That’s good.” Xue Bei nodded slightly. “As long as you are satisfied, you won’t waste my fourth opportunity.”

Jian Wushuang was secretly grateful.

Xue Bei had left him four opportunities. Except for the third opportunity and the mysterious star map, the other three opportunities were of great use to him, especially the fourth opportunity, the hundred years he had spent in the Bodhi World had surprised him.

“I’ve given you all the opportunities. You can leave now. Do you have any questions before you leave?” Xue Bei asked.

“Senior, I have something to ask you,” Jian Wushuang said respectfully.

“Tell me. If I know it and you are qualified to know it, I will tell you,” Xue Bei said.

“Senior, you should know that I am an anomaly in heaven and earth, and the Heavenly Dao doesn’t allow me to do so. That’s why I was extra careful when I was roaming around the Divine Beginning Realm. I was afraid that I would attract the power of the Heavenly Dao’s will. However, in the Divine Beginning Realm, other than the Heavenly Dao’s will itself, there are also some experts or forces that are on the same side as the Heavenly Dao’s will. This made me even more cautious and careful.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Take the Heaven-cleaving Alliance for example. Although I am a heaven-grade member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, and the Heaven-cleaving Alliance has invited me to cultivate in the Three Palaces of Heaven-cleaving Alliance twice, I didn’t know the position of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. I was worried that the higher-ups of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance would notice something in the Three Palaces and get killed. Therefore, I declined both invitations.”

Before Jian Wushuang could ask his question, Xue Bei had already opened his mouth. “You want to ask which forces in the Divine Beginning Realm are on the same side as the will of heaven and will be your enemy, right?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“I know the answer to this question, and I can answer it for you.” Xue Bei said, “In the Divine Beginning Realm, the will of heaven is indeed very special and supreme. If it goes against the laws of heaven, the will of heaven will not tolerate it. This is also a fact. However, the will of heaven is not truly omnipotent in the Divine Beginning Realm. It has many limitations, and even its own strength is limited.”

“The will of the Heavenly Dao is limited? Even his own strength is limited?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Because of this, some of the supreme experts in the Divine Beginning Realm can completely ignore the will of the Heavenly Dao. Even the will of the Heavenly Dao has to retreat in front of him and don’t dare to offend him,” Xue Bei said.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was shocked. “Even the will of the Heavenly Dao has to retreat and don’t dare to offend him? Is there really such a supreme expert in the Divine Beginning Realm?”
