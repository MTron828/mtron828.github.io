Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Soaring Heaven King Palace Master sent down his command and it instantly stirred up a great commotion in Soaring Heaven King Palace.

Especially the last part of Soaring Heaven King Palace’s speech. Regardless of the intervention, have no scruples, kill them all!

He had even highlighted Lineage of Star in his command.

Soaring Heaven King Palace obviously wanted to establish their dignity in the fight. As they intended to do so, they had to show everyone. Hence, they had sent the command without covering up and spread it directly.

It spread to Thunderbolt Island as well as the entire Sanctuary Alliance.

It instantly caused a hubbub in Sanctuary Alliance.

“To kill the number one genius from Lineage of Star without having any scruples? Even if the experts from Lineage of Star get involved, kill them all? Soaring Heaven King Palace is trying to start a fight with Lineage of Star?”

“They are definitely starting a fight. Jian Wushuang is Lineage of Star’s precious one. Lineage of Star wouldn’t let anything happen to him. They definitely will send a bunch of experts to rescue him. By then, they definitely would fight with Soaring Heaven King Palace directly.”

“Soaring Heaven King Palace is very strong. However, ever since Lineage of Star got the two White Blaze Fruit Trees, their foundation and power haven’t been much weaker than Soaring Heaven King Palace’s. If the two overlords were to fight with one another. Tsk tsk. That’d be interesting.”

Countless top experts from all forces of Sanctuary Alliance found out about the news as well.

Everyone was looking forward to the fight.

Among Sanctuary Alliance, there were great forces that had gotten into war because of their disputes. It was very common. There were even times when forces had been exterminated from it.

All forces in Sanctuary Alliance were used to it since long ago. Now, they were just watching the two overlords.

In the core region of the Eighth Lair.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

As soon as the experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace, who were scattered around the core region looking for Jian Wushuang, received the command, they rushed over to the location of Real God Cheng Tian immediately.

Plus, they were informed about Real God Cheng Tian and Real God Shi Gu’s deaths. Hence, they were taking action in groups, very cautiously.

In the void, there were three figures plunging forward.

The three of them were top Chaotic Real Gods. There was one that had come from Soaring Heaven King Palace. As for the other two, they were solo experts hired by Soaring Heaven King Palace.

In Eternal Chaotic World, there were many powerful solo experts who were unafraid of all forces. As long as the price offered was high enough, they wouldn’t even care if they had to offend other major forces. After all, it wouldn’t be that easy if the major forces wanted to kill them as well.

Then, in order to kill Jian Wushuang, Soaring Heaven King Palace had hired more than ten solo experts.

The three people who were plunging forward at high speed suddenly stopped. A grey-robed old lady who was in the middle turned to look in the dark void behind, “I wonder who are the few that have been tailing the three of us? What’s the purpose?”

The grey-robed old lady looked fragile but her voice was bright and contained power that spread in all directions.

Then, the experts who followed the three of them never revealed themselves but there was a burst of laughter.

“Old Monster Ling Xie, we don’t want to do anything. We just want to watch. After all, we don’t know where Jian Wushuang is. We can only find him if we follow you!”

“Yeah, yeah, go ahead with yours. We will not get involved in the fight between you and Lineage of Star.”

“A fight between Soaring Heaven King Palace and Lineage of Star, it’s a once in a lifetime occurence. We don’t want to miss it.”

The grey-robed old lady squinted her eyes when she heard the laughter.

“If everyone is really here to watch, go ahead and follow us. Let me say this first, if any of you think of getting involved when the fight starts, Soaring Heaven King Palace won’t let any of you off the hook,” the grey-robed old lady said. Then, she turned to continue to rush her journey.

“Ling Xie, wouldn’t it be too great of a move that Soaring Heaven King Palace is pulling?” An expert who was flying alongside the grey-robed lady asked casually.

“Soaring Heaven King Palace is trying to show dignity. Naturally, the more spectators the merrier,” the other person said with a smirk.

“Stop joking. We are nearing the location of Jian Wushuang. By then, we’ll rely heavily on the two of you,” the grey-robed old lady said.

“Don’t you worry about it. As the two of us agreed to help Soaring Heaven King Palace, we will naturally give our best shot,” the two of them agreed heartily.

Then, Soaring Heaven King Palace took the initiative to attack and it spread like wildfire in Sanctuary Alliance. Those experts who were wandering in the Eighth Lair naturally knew about it too. Hence, they purposely rushed over as well. Plus, there were many pairs of eyes in Sanctuary Alliance who were watching the upcoming fight closely.

The fight could be said to be a public attraction.

…

In boundless darkness, there was a barren land with no signs of life. Jian Wushuang didn’t opt to plunge into the void but walked step by step on the land.

He walked very slowly. It had been a few days since he had killed Real God Cheng Tian and Real God Shi Gu. Over the past few days, he had walked for less than ten thousand miles. It was as though he didn’t move at all but was waiting for strong opponents to come by.

In actual fact, he was really waiting for the experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace.

“Jian Wushuang, my friend, the movement that you have caused is extraordinary. There was an expert from Soaring Heaven King Palace who sent me a message earlier. They offered me a great price for me to assist them to kill you. Honestly, Soaring Heaven King Palace lives up to their reputation as a top major force. They were very generous in their offer, even I was very tempted.”

“Haha, Brother Peng Huo, did you agree with them?”

Jian Wushuang and Real God Peng Huo were chatting casually.

“Don’t you know me yet? I never make trouble with anyone else. Even if there are benefits, I would never offend anyone for no reason. Plus, we are friends to begin with. Why would I fight with you for some offered benefits?” Real God Peng Huo laughed.

“That’s a pity. I thought I would have a chance to fight Brother Peng Huo,” Jian Wushuang joked. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“You want to fight with me? Head to Thunderbolt Island and we can do that. By then, we can even catch up over a drink,” Real God Peng Huo was very enthusiastic.

“No problem,” Jian Wushuang nodded but he suddenly paused.

“Brother Peng Huo, talk to you later. The experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace have found me,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Be careful. Soaring Heaven King Palace aren’t nice people to offend,” Real God Peng Huo exhorted.

“They aren’t nice, but I am not either!” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly. Then, he cut off his connection with Real God Peng Huo.

On the land in darkness, Jian Wushuang lifted his eyes and looked in one direction. His Soul Power had already detected the three approaching auras from the direction.

The three auras belonged to three top Chaotic Real Gods.
