Chapter 3535: Suppression

“Is that...a soul golden pearl?”

The Principles Masters around them all noticed what Eight Axe Master had brought out.

“It’s a soul golden pearl, and it’s of an extremely high level. Its value is also extremely shocking, and it’s equivalent to one-third of a low-level universe true treasure. Under normal circumstances, a soul golden pearl of this level would be used to swallow and strengthen one’s soul resistance when it’s attacked by the soul. Of course, after a cultivator consumes it, his soul power will soar, and his soul sensing ability will also be greatly enhanced,” Heavy Master said seriously.

“Eight Axe Master is really generous.” Purple Sound Master sighed.

On the battlefield, everyone saw Eight Axe Master take out the Purple Pearl and swallow it without thinking.

After swallowing it, his soul power and soul perception ability increased greatly. In a short time, his soul perception ability would not be weaker than an ordinary expert of the six void realms. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

With the help of the soul gold pearl, Eight Axe Master immediately found Jian Wushuang.

“I found him, he’s there!”

Eight Axe Master’s eyes were cold, but he appeared in an empty void.

This void was also in the battlefield. It seemed empty, but Eight Axe Master knew that Jian Wushuang was hiding here.

“Die!”

Eight Axe Master shouted and swung his giant axe at lightning speed.

The void was almost split open, and Jian Wushuang’s figure appeared in the void and retreated rapidly.

“You found my position by consuming treasures. Eight Axe Master, you’re quite skilled.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Boy, hand over the Poluo God component and I’ll let you go. Otherwise...” Eight Axe Master stared at Jian Wushuang with a cold gaze.

“Otherwise what?” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently, “Eight Axe Master, you think too highly of yourself. I just didn’t want to go through so much trouble, so I used my escape art to leave. Do you really think I won’t dare to fight you face-to-face?”

“Huh?” Eight Axe Master frowned and stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Eight Axe Master, since you’ve found me, I’ll play with you.”“Please reading on N?WNOV?L. 0?G” Jian Wushuang had already pulled out the Blood Mountain Sword behind him and looked at Eight Axe Master with interest.

“Very good.” Eight Axe Master’s voice was cold, and his body suddenly rushed out.

This time, Jian Wushuang did not have the slightest intention of retreating. He also went up to meet him.

Just as he was about to fight with the Eight Axe Master, Jian Wushuang activated his life divine power.

Of course, he only activated his life divine power. As for the heaven-cleaving skill, he was not in a hurry to use it.

However, even though he only activated his life divine power, the power that Jian Wushuang unleashed was not weaker than that of the Void five-realm Principles Master. In addition, the first stage of the Blood Crystal Armor magnified his advantage in basic divine power, in terms of power, he was not much weaker than Eight Axe Master.

“Eight Axe Master, take this.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, but the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand slashed out rapidly.

A huge blood-red sword light with a violent aura suddenly swept out,

it was the Peerless Sword manual, Xi Xiang!

“Get lost!”

Eight Axe Master growled in a low voice, and the huge axe in his hand swept out in a mighty and straight manner.

He did not hold back in this axe attack, and he did his best. In his eyes, he was an expert at the peak of the fifth level of the void, yet he was facing this Principles Master who had no reputation before and whose aura was extremely ordinary, he could definitely crush him.

However, the moment the axe shadow he swung out truly collided with the blood-colored sword light, the Eight Axe Master was stunned.

The blood-red sword light contained an extremely violent power. When it collided with the axe shadow, it was shattered and even the giant axe in his hand was slightly changed, he staggered backward.

“This is...a level six absolute art?” Eight Axe Master was still a little stunned.

However, Jian Wushuang had already rushed out like a ghost in front of him.

Whoosh!

Another sword attack. This sword attack emitted a terrifying tearing force and directly tore apart the void.

It was the peerless sword technique, Star Dream!

Eight Axe Master subconsciously raised his hand to block the sword attack, but the tearing force contained in the sword technique made him stagger again.

“How can this strength be so strong?” Eight Axe Master was extremely surprised.

However, Jian Wushuang began to perform his swordsmanship.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

One after another, sword lights were displayed from Jian Wushuang’s hands.

Some of these swordsmanship were swift and violent, some were strange and enchanting, and some were terrifying and oppressive. Most importantly, each of these swordsmanship was extremely powerful, every sword attack forced Eight Axe Master to defend with all his strength, but it was only a passive defense. He could not find a chance to fight back.

“He’s too strong. His strength is no weaker than mine, and his swordsmanship is too terrifying!” The Eight Axe Master was a little terrified of Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship.

Because Jian Wushuang had fought with him many times, he had displayed many swordsmanship, and each of these swordsmanship was a sixth-level absolute art!

It should be known that a sixth-level absolute art was compatible with an expert in the six realms of the void. Although the five realms of the Void could create sixth-level absolute arts, like him, it was very difficult to create a sixth-level absolute art.

However, Jian Wushuang had not only created a sixth-level absolute art, but he had also created more than just one sword move. Many of his sword moves had reached the sixth-level absolute art level.

What he did not know was that although Jian Wushuang was not a true Principles Master, in terms of real strength, he was definitely not weaker than a Principles Master of the sixth realm of the void. Most importantly, his talent in sword principle was extremely high, along the way, he received many incredible opportunities. For example, six hundred years ago, the Heaven Ancestor, a ruler-level expert, gave him a demonstration of the axe skill. The axe skill had greatly affected him.

He often came into contact with experts of the six void realms and even fought with them. Naturally, his swordsmanship had improved greatly. Up until now, his seven sword moves of the Wushuang Sword Manual had all reached the level of a sixth-rank absolute art, all have been elevated to the level of level six.

Under the premise that their powers were about the same, Jian Wushuang had the absolute advantage in the competition of strength and ultimate skills.

“Don’t get cocky, kid!”

After being suppressed by Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship for a long time, Eight Axe Master was finally enraged. A golden lightning suddenly flashed from his body, and a terrifying aura burst out from his body. His eyes turned scarlet.

“Are you going to use your killer move?” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly. “It’s good that I’m tired of playing. It’s time to end it.”
