Chapter 3081: Duan Yu’s Visit

__________

After the genius feast ended, Jian Wushuang and the others left the Jade Dragon Mystic Realm.

Jian Wushuang, Jiu Luo, and Bai Xiao were flying side by side in the vast void.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, it shouldn’t be difficult for you to defeat Duan Yu with your strength. Why did you deliberately lose to him in the end?” Jiu Luo asked.

He also saw that Jian Wushuang had deliberately lost to Duan Yu.

“There’s no meaning in defeating him,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

Jiu Luo shrugged but did not say anything.

Bai Xiao and the others were secretly communicating with each other.

“I have already sent a message to Senior Brother Xiong Tao, but Senior Brother Xiong Tao hasn’t replied to me. What should I do now?” The red-haired man said.

“Who knows? I’ve already done as master instructed. I don’t care what the result is,” Bai Xiao said.

They were also helpless.

They wanted to test Jian Wushuang’s true strength, but unfortunately, they could not find any opportunity.

At this moment…

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Three figures suddenly rushed over from the distant void.

“Stop!”

A low shout suddenly echoed between the heaven and earth.

Jian Wushuang and the others immediately stopped and turned to look. The leader of the three was a young man with a half-moon-like face. He was Duan Yu, who had won the first place in the genius feast and was famous in the Third Heaven.

As for the other two, their auras were so strong that they had reached the level of a rank four True Saint. They should be the two experts sent by the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion to follow Duan Yu and protect him. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Duan Yu and the other two also stopped in front of Jian Wushuang and the others. Duan Yu’s eyes were fixed on Jian Wushuang.

“What’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course,” Duan Yu said in a low voice, “your name is Heavenly Sword Marquis, right? Let me ask you, when you fought with me, did you stop at the last moment?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang did not deny it.

He fought with Duan Yu and stopped at the last moment. If Duan Yu did not see it, he would be extremely stupid.

“Why?” Duan Yu asked coldly.

“I will stop if I want to. Why?” Jian Wushuang said.

“Good, very good!” Duan Yu clenched his teeth. “Heavenly Sword Marquis, although I won the first place in this year’s genius feast, I always have a thorn in my heart. This thorn is you. That’s why I specially came here. Let’s fight again. This time, both of us should not hold back and use all of our strength. What do you think?”

“You still want to fight?” Jian Wushuang looked at Duan Yu with a strange expression. “Do you think it’s necessary?”

“Of course. Although I know you stopped at the last moment, I wouldn’t be satisfied if I didn’t lose to you. Besides, I was a bit careless before. Otherwise, your swordsmanship might not be able to suppress me,” Duan Yu said in a low voice.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and then smiled. “Well, since you’re not satisfied, then you and I will fight again. Let’s fight here. This time, it’s your turn to fight first.”

Jian Wushuang flipped his hand and took out the Blood Mountain Sword.

“Okay,” Duan Yu responded. Immediately, a surging aura rose from his body. At the same time, dense purple thunderbolts burst out, forming a thunder hell in the surrounding void.

Seeing that Duan Yu and Jian Wushuang were going to fight again, Bai Xiao, Jiu Luo, and the others immediately retreated to the side.

“Kill!”

With a fierce shout, Duan Yu directly turned into a purple thunderbolt and shot out.

Whoosh!

A saber light suddenly slashed out, like a purple thunderbolt, and instantly cut through Jian Wushuang’s divine body.

However, the saber light did not touch Jian Wushuang’s divine body at all.

“What?” Duan Yu was shocked, but his pupils suddenly shrank.

He was surprised to see Jian Wushuang appear beside him, and at the same time, Jian Wushuang also attacked.

It was a cold and beautiful sword shadow that felt like a dream.

The sword light was calm and indifferent. It swung out from Jian Wushuang’s hand and then directly cut toward Duan Yu’s arm.

Wushuang Sword Manual, Star Dream!

This sword was too fast!

Duan Yu did not have time to react. The sword light had already swept over his right arm. A terrifying cutting power burst out, and his entire arm was chopped off in an instant.

“You lost!”

Jian Wushuang’s figure had already appeared behind Duan Yu, and his calm voice was transmitted over.

Duan Yu, on the other hand, widened his eyes and looked stunned.

Bai Xiao and the others in the void could not help but sigh when they saw this scene.

“So powerful!” The red-haired man exclaimed.

“Yes, it’s very powerful. His sword…although its speed is not as fast as when he defeated me, the cutting power contained in it is too strong. Duan Yu is the number one genius of the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion. His life-saving skills are very strong, and the armor he wears is of a very high level. However, his sword actually tore through the armor and cut off Duan Yu’s arm.” Bai Xiao also praised.

“If he can cut off Duan Yu’s arm, he can also cut off Duan Yu’s head. Previously, I thought that Heavenly Sword Marquis’ swordsmanship was just a little better. If both sides did not hold back and fought with all their strength, I might be able to fight with him or even defeat him by relying on my divine power or secret skill. But now it seems that…even if I go all out, I’m still no match for him. I might even be defeated by his sword.”

Duan Yu was completely stunned.

He knew that Jian Wushuang had stopped at a critical moment, but he did not think that his strength was inferior to Jian Wushuang.

After all, he had been careless and did not use all of his strength in the previous battle.

Therefore, he was unwilling to give up, so he came to find Jian Wushuang in order to defeat him face to face.

But who would have thought…that the result would be like this?

“How could he be so strong?” Duan Yu could not understand.

He was already the first place in this year’s genius feast. If nothing unexpected happened, he would definitely be able to join the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces or the Dao Palace. He was definitely one of the top geniuses in the Divine Beginning World. But now…he was already stunned by Jian Wushuang’s sword.

While Duan Yu was still in a daze..

“Your swordsmanship is not bad!” A deep voice suddenly sounded.

Everyone looked in the direction of the voice and found a three-meter-tall, stocky, brown-haired man who had appeared in the void beside them.

“Senior Brother Xiong Tao!”

Seeing this person, Bai Xiao and the three geniuses from the Dao Palace were overjoyed.

Jian Wushuang also glanced at this man and then smiled faintly. “Are you finally going to show up?”

“You found me?” Xiong Tao stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang nodded.
