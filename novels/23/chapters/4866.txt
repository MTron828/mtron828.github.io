4867 The Eve Before Leaving

Su He pushed him away and said unhappily, “You’re always playing tricks. Let me do it.”

“We’ve all carefully examined the bead just now. It’s extremely strange, and we can’t even guess what it is. As a result, it’s best to throw it away as soon as possible to avoid being heavily injured in the future.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang frowned. Even the Emperors were afraid of the Black Bead, and it could kill all the prisoners in the Heavenly Region by itself. It seemed to be an ominous item.

“My Young Friend,” Yang Jun stepped forward. “You must take precautions. I have a feeling that this thing is not as simple as it looks.”

With the third Emperor’s reminder, Jian Wushuang realized the severity of the situation. “In that case, we can only destroy it.”

As he spoke, he reached out to grab the floating Black Bead.

“You can’t!” The three Emperors shouted at the same time, as if something terrifying was about to happen.

However, the scene that they had imagined did not happen. Jian Wushuang held the Black Bead in his hand and looked at the three of them with a puzzled expression.

“Little Friend, listen to me. You must not release Yan power. This item is extremely effective against Yan power. If you’re not careful, you’ll get yourself burned,” Yang Jun said nervously.

Jian Wushuang was still confused. After the Black Bead fell into his hand, it was like a pot of boiling water being frozen. There was no difference, “It seems… Nothing happenned…”

“How can he be fine?” The three Emperors looked at each other, unable to believe what they were seeing.

“Could it be that this Bead will choose to devour people?” Su He was not sure.

Daogong also said, “No matter what, Little Friend, you should get rid of this thing as soon as possible. But remember not to throw it away casually, so as not to let living beings suffer.”

After reminding and giving some advice, the three Emperors returned to the Boyang Bottle. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Jian Wushuang nodded and then carefully observed the strange Black Bead, trying to find something from it.

However, other than the dense Yan power in the surrounding air being completely devoured by the Black Bead, there were no other changes.

He was still confused about the Black Bead in his hand, but he still found some redeeming points from it.

According to the characteristics of this Black Bead, if he were to face a more powerful opponent in future battles, could he release this Black Bead to devour the opponent’s Yan power? Would it achieve an unexpected effect?

Jian Wushuang pinched his chin and pondered.

It was also at this moment that the Young Emperor stepped into Little Lonely Heaven.

After sensing his aura, he stuffed the Black Bead into his arms and then got up to greet him.

“It’s fine, it’s just a small matter,” Jian Wushuang waved his hand and said. “What’s the matter, Young Emperor?”

He shrugged his shoulders. “Of course you can. Shall we go to the hall together?”

The Young Emperor hesitated for a moment and finally said, “Actually, Brother Jian, I’m here to discuss something important. My Imperial Father’s birthday is in less than three years. I would like to invite you to attend the banquet with me in the Heavenly Court.”

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He heaved a sigh of relief. “Brother Jian, I thank you again.”

After pondering for a moment, Jian Wushuang asked, “Can I enter the Heavenly Dao Library again when I go to the Heavenly Court this time?”

“Of course,” the Young Emperor said. “Brother Jian, do you want to go there again to find the bone armor?”

Jian Wushuang did not hide anything, “Yes, rather than aimlessly searching, it’s better to go there and try my luck.”

“Alright, I’ll be waiting for Brother Jian’s arrival in three years.” The Young Emperor cupped his hands again.

…

When he returned to the hall, Di Qing had woken up from his sleep. He stretched his body and came to Jian Wushuang, saying, “Looking at your complexion, you seem to have been constantly on the move. It’s time for you to take a rest.”

Jian Wushuang shook his head and said, “It’s fine. I’ll have to leave again soon. I’ll leave this place to you.”

Di Qing raised his eyebrows and said, “That Young Emperor really has a full schedule for you. Do you want me to teach him a lesson for you?”

He did not know whether to laugh or cry. “Why would I teach him a lesson? You can just rest here and recuperate. I won’t trouble you with other things.”

At this moment, Wei Liujia also stepped forward and said, “Lord Jian, I’ll go with you. We can take care of each other.”

“No need, there won’t be any twists and turns on this trip. Too many people will only delay things.” Jian Wushuang shook his head and then looked at the hall.

Cheng Qing, Chun Qiu, and Cui Jing had been busy at the Wushuang Auction House, but one of them was missing in the hall.

“Liujia, have you seen Zhao Ting?” he asked.

“You mean Heavenly Official Zhao? I just saw her a few days ago, but she’s gone again.” Wei Liujia was also a little uncertain. “But thinking about it, Official Zhao shouldn’t have gone far.”

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly. If what Wei Liujia said was true, it would be fine. He was afraid that Zhao Ting had returned to the Great Mi Heaven and told Prince Jiu about the situation here.

Zhao Ting was a mysterious woman. She was the former Great Heavenly Official who served Prince Jiu. Her actions were always unpredictable. Even Jian Wushuang could not figure out what she was thinking.

Hence, he was still extremely worried about her.

Just as he was about to use this time to search for Zhao Ting’s traces, she quietly returned. The wounds all over her body had yet to completely recover, and it seemed like she had just experienced a bloody battle not long ago.

Jian Wushuang did not say much, but just gave Di Qing a look.

Di Qing got the hint and said in a voice that only the two of them could hear, “Don’t worry. With me here, no one can cause any trouble.”

…

Three years passed by in the blink of an eye. Compared to the first time, the second time was much more low-key.

Except for some of his close confidants, the entire Six Heavens Realm was quiet. It seemed that the news had not been made public.

Without the Imperial Carriage, without a Yan Immortal leading the way, everything was extremely quiet.

There were only two Young Masters in plain clothes, who looked like they were traveling the world. They stepped on the clouds in the void and flew forward.
