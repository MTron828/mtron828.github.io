Chapter 204: All of You Have to Die!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“All of you have to die!”

The roar was so loud that it resounded throughout the entire Sky Valley, causing the faces of the top experts from the Cosmos Empire to suddenly change.

After gently putting Su Rou down on the ground, Jian Wushuang got up. With a sound of ‘Chuu’, the Triple-kill Sword was already in his hand, and then he walked toward the geniuses of the Cosmos Empire in front of him, step by step.

“Third Brother,” Yang Zaixuan called.

Jian Wushuang stopped and looked at Yang Zaixuan.

A smile appeared on Yang Zaixuan’s face, but it was rather miserable, and then he said, “Next, we will all rely on you.”

“OK.” Jian Wushuang nodded slowly, and then he continued to walk forward.

Every step he took was very slow. After stepping on the ground, he stepped into the Void.

“Huh?” The geniuses of the Cosmos Empire were shocked by his movement.

“Voidwalk?”

“Yin-Yang Void Realm?”

“No, he hasn’t reached the Yin-Yang Void Realm yet. He is just in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm!”

“Should a man of the Primordial Gold Core Realm be able to have a Voidwalk?”

The geniuses of the Cosmos Empire were astonished.

However, Jian Wushuang raised his eyes and looked at these geniuses. The first person his eyes locked onto was Ling Xueyu.

“Is it you that chopped off my second brother’s arm?” Jian Wushuang said in a cold voice devoid of emotion.

“Yes, it was me. What do you want to do?” Ling Xueyu raised his mouth slightly as though he did not care about Jian Wushuang at all.

He was proud and arrogant.

Among the 12 dynasties participating in the Easternmost Hunting, only Meng Wutian from the Angel Empire had the qualifications for Ling Xueyu to care about him.

As for others, he did not pay any attention to them.

“OK, it’s you.”

Jian Wushuang said indifferently before he then stepped forward.

“Whoosh!”

Jian Wushuang’s figure suddenly appeared beside Ling Xueyu within just a few moments.

“You chopped off one of my second brother’s arms, so it isn’t too much to chop off your two arms to avenge him.” Jian Wushuang’s chilly voice sounded around Ling Xueyu’s ears.

At this moment, Ling Xueyu, who just had an evil smile on his face and was previously acting supercilious, suddenly widened his eyes.

Lowering his head with difficulty, he discovered that a cold sword shadow had flashed through him, yet he had no idea when this happened.

This sword shadow was extremely sharp, so as soon as it passed through him from both sides, his two arms were chopped off simultaneously!

“How could this be possible?” Ling Xueyu was momentarily dumbstruck.

He could not believe what happened.

Who was he?

He was Ling Xueyu!

He was one of the two exceptional genius acknowledged by the public in this Easternmost Hunting, but both of his arms were chopped off by a nobody from a small empire.

Too fast!

This sword shadow was too fast! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

It was so fast that before he could react, his two arms had already been chopped off.

Jian Wushuang then clenched his left fist and directly punched forward.

Bang!

This fist struck heavily at Ling Xueyu’s stomach. The power was so terrifying that it directly obliterated his Dantian into powder.

“Puff!”

Lots of blood spilled from Ling Xueyu’s mouth and his face instantly turned pale.

“My, my Dantian…” Ling Xueyu roared in a low voice with great pain, while fresh blood constantly spilled from his mouth.

However, Jian Wushuang’s hands stretched out to Ling Xueyu again. As his arms were chopped off and his Dantian was destroyed by Jian Wushuang, he had no ability to offer any resistance or even struggle, thus Jian Wushuang picked him up by his throat.

Then Jian Wushuang swang his arm and Ling Xueyu, just like a dead dog, was vigorously thrown onto the open space near Yang Zaixuan.

Ling Xueyu’s body fell onto the ground in front of Yang Zaixuan, which caused the earth to shake upon impact.

“Second Brother, it’s up to you whether this guy should be cut into pieces or be dismembered.” Jian Wushuang’s cold voice sounded.

At this moment, the whole battlefield was silent.

Looking at Ling Xueyu who was thrown on the ground like a dead dog without any battle strength, Yang Zaixuan took a deep breath and nodded at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang no longer paid any attention to Ling Xueyu, and his eyes turned to the 14 other geniuses of the Cosmos Empire.

These 14 geniuses included Gu Yan and Zhang Kong: two of the top 10 peak experts on the standings.

But at this moment, these 14 geniuses looked at Jian Wushuang as though they were staring at a demon they had never seen before.

In their eyes, Ling Xueyu was at the level of monsters.

However, he was easily destroyed by this guy in front of them in no time.

How powerful was his strength?

“The Cosmos Empire is one of the two large empires among the Twelve Northwestern Dynasties!”

Jian Wushuang looked at the 14 geniuses of the Cosmos Empire coldly.

“I wonder what kind of scene that would be if the geniuses of your Cosmos Empire who participated in this Easternmost Hunting were all to die in Sky Valley.”

Jian Wushuang smiled coldly and began to wave the Triple-kill Sword in his hand.

Idealistic Form, the First Move of the Selfless Sword Technique!

Although it was the same Idealistic Form, after Jian Wushuang combined the four sword essences with this move, its power was much stronger.

CHUU!

A cold and bright sword light directly swept out momentarily.

Where this sword light traveled, there was silence.

It seemed as though the time of the universe stopped at this moment.

The moment these 14 geniuses of the Cosmos Empire saw the sword light, their faces changed greatly, and they tried to escape from the sweeping of this sword move, but before long they found…

Their speed was too slow!

Compared with the cold and shining sword move, they were vastly slower!

They were directly pierced through by the sword light before they had the chance to lift up the weapons to resist.

Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi…

The sound of the sword piercing into bodies rang one by one, and altogether there were 14.

The 14 geniuses of the Cosmos Empire still stood there, but they were at a loss, with eyes full of horror and despair!

Then… Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng! Peng!

14 bodies simultaneously fell onto the ground powerlessly.

14 geniuses of the Cosmos Empire, who could be regarded as the top talents by the public, had been killed with one sword move!

Quiet!

The silence was akin to death in the earth and heavens.

Even Jian Wushuang’s teammates including Baili Chen, Feng Yutian, and Mu Yingying who still had consciousness were greatly shocked by what had happened in front of them.

As for Yang Zaixuan, his expression was still extremely indifferent.

After Jian Wushuang killed all 14 geniuses of the Cosmos Empire, he did not stop his actions, and his cold eyes turned to a forest not far from him.

“After watching us for such a long time, it’s time to reveal yourselves.”

As soon as he finished uttering those words, Jian Wushuang lifted his arm and hacked his sword toward the forest.

With the flash of the sword light, tens of huge trees fell forthwith onto the ground, and then figures appeared one by one. With a scarlet-robed youth as their head, these figures’ breaths were uncommon.

However, no matter whether it was the scarlet-robed youth or the others, they all looked at Jian Wushuang with great fear.

“Immortals-killing Empire?”

Seeing these figures, Jian Wushuang smiled coldly. “The geniuses of the Cosmos Empire have all died, and I don’t mind erasing your Immortals-killing Empire from this battle for points!”
