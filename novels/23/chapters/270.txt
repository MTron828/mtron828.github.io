Chapter 271: Shocking Everyone

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The whole Martial Arts Practice Field turned still immediately.

Those geniuses and experts from different Sects, including Daluo Heaven Sect, were shocked when they saw that Chen Feng’s Head was thrown on the ground.

Just now, they all thought that Jian Wushuang, who was at the Initial Yang Void Realm yet still dared to fight with Chen Feng, was just a joke.

But now... in a flash, Chen Feng was killed.

“Good job.” Ling Han looked to be in ecstasy.

He had been anxious whether Jian Wushuang would be able to kill Chen Feng before, but now... Just one move!

On the other hand, in the Wilderness Sword Sect, the robust?middle-aged man, the leader, and those geniuses were all shocked and speechless. They had looked down on Jian Wushuang before.

The robust middle-aged man was shocked initially and then he became infuriated.

“Damn it, how dare he kill my disciple of the Wilderness Sword Sect?”

After roaring, the robust middle-aged man’s figure moved out just like a thunderbolt. A salvo of horrible killing intent fell on Jian Wushuang instantly.

Chen Feng, who Jian Wushuang killed, was the son of the Wilderness Sword Sect Sect Master.

Because of the death of Chen Feng, as a leading Elder, he was unable to shoulder the guilt. Based on the character of Wilderness Sword Sect Sect Master, he would be killed cruelly if he returned to his sect without killing the murderer.

The moment that the robust man approached Jian Wushuang, Ling Han also moved.

Ling Han was ready to block the experts from the Wilderness Sword Sect if they joined in the fight.

However, Ling Han did not have enough time to block the robust man. Jian Wushuang, who was standing at the center of the Martial Arts Practice Field, dashed toward the robust man at this moment.

“What is he doing?” Ling Han was confounded.

Based on his plan, Jian Wushuang would flee after killing Chen Feng. However, he did not escape but dashed toward the robust man.

If Jian Wushuang fled or even stood still, Ling Han was confident that he could block the robust man before he attacked Jian Wushuang. But now, Jian Wushuang had dashed and the distance between Jian Wushuang and the robust man was narrowing. Ling Han was unable to block the robust man.

“He is crazy!” Ling Han was overwhelmed.

The experts from the different sects were looking at Jian Wushuang in shock.

A super expert, who was at the Half-saint Level, approached him. He did not escape but dashed toward him.

Was Jian Wushuang really insane?

Of course not. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“A month ago, without executing Soul-Devouring, based on the comprehension of Origin and my swordsmanship, I could outclass the three-person sword formation executed by the three warriors at the level of the Peak of the Yang Void Realm, including Mo Lingtian. My battle strength was not weaker than the warriors who was at the level of Peak of the Yang Void Realm?and had comprehended Origin, even a little bit stronger.”

“And now, my comprehension of Origin has achieved this level, so my strength surged again. Warriors who are at the Half-saint are not qualified to let me retreat!”?A salvo of terrific battle intent was condensing in Jian Wushuang’s body.

Other experts, who were at the Yang Void Realm, would escape without hesitation.

However, at this moment, he wanted to fight with the Half-saint.

“An expert at the Half-saint Level. Let me try.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes gleamed and a terrific Sword Essence burst out from his body at the same time. Instantly, a thick blanket of gray fog covered the robust middle-aged man.

Sword Realm, Sword Fog!

After three days of learning Sword Realm, he had thoroughly mastered the moves and this move he displayed was stronger than that which Jun Yi displayed.

The robust middle-aged man was caught in the Sword Realm, and his body was affected by the surrounding Sword Essence. At this time, both his speed and power were hindered.

“Do you think that with this little trick you can save yourself?”

The robust middle-aged man roared and lots of thunderbolts burst out from his body surface to destroy everything in the world. His whole body became a Thunder God of War, appearing in front of Jian Wushuang.

Boom!

A fist containing thousands of thunderbolts slammed directly into Jian Wushuang’s head and the terrible Spiritual Power burst out instantly.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes shrank and the Triple-kill Sword was trembling in his hands. Afterward, an imperious force of Origin of the World was accumulating. During this accumulation, the Origin shook the heaven and earth and then the Origin surged to a new level.

“Selfless Sword Technique, sixth move!”

Shua!

The incomparably gorgeous move, also containing a terrible incomparable power, flashed out. It collided with the overpowering fist.

Boom!

A loud noise like a roar of thunder erupted.

Immediately, they saw the place where the two attacks met, boom~~~ The terrific power was crazily crashing and colliding, and formed many Blast Waves. These Blast Waves materialized and rippled like water. And then those Blast Waves smashed into the ground below.

The ground of the Martial Arts Practice Field was made of firm carbonite. Although more than ten battles had occurred in the previous gathering, the ground was not damaged, barring a few little depressions made by the fiercely fight between Chen Feng and Ye Se.

But at this time, the ground of the entire Martial Arts Practice Field was torn up and turned into powder, blowing away.

Only one confrontation and the effects were so surprising.

Around the Martial Arts Practice Field, the geniuses and experts from different sects were also affected. Many people closed their eyes. Only a few strong experts could squint at the fierce battle at the center of the Martial Arts Practice Field.

Alright, it was a duel.

At the center of the Martial Arts Practice Field, the two tyrannical forces madly collided and no one was the clear winner.

“How could this be?” That robust middle-aged man, who was from the Wilderness Sword Sect, was astonished.

He was indeed a Half-saint expert. Although he was still not doing his best, his fist could not be parried by a warrior who was at the level of the Initial Yang Void Realm.

Jian Wushuang, who was in front of him, said coldly, “a Half-saint expert is not bad.”

After saying that, the power in the Jian Wushuang’s sword surged again and then it directly forced the robust middle-aged man to retreat.

The robust middle-aged man retreated to the void and was still confounded. Soon, he raised his head again and his eyes filled with panic were focusing on Jian Wushuang firmly. He was ready to kill Jian Wushuang with his whole strength.

However, at this point...

“Humph!”

A cold groan was sounding out above the Martial Arts Practice Field suddenly. At the same time, a transcendent breath appeared.

The breath represented an owner who was at the level of the Divine Transcendence.

“The people from the Wilderness Sword Sect are really overbearing!”

After the words finished, an expert of the Saint Realm from the Daluo Heaven Sect, who had been hiding in the dark for a long time, appeared.
