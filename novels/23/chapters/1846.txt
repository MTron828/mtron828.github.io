Chapter 1847: Massacre In The Past (Part Two)

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Due to the drop of blood, the time that the Star Palace Master has when he unleashes the Secret Skill of Star Palace is much longer,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Under normal circumstances, after a cultivator cultivates the first volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace and activates the Star Power to unleash the Secret Skill, the Secret Skill will only last for ten breaths’ time. When the second volume is activated, the Secret Skill will last for a breath’s time. Similarly, the Star Palace Master unleashed the second volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace. However, due to the drop of blood, he can continue his massacre for over hundreds of breaths’ time, or even longer. If he were to not care about the consequences and continue to deplete the drop of blood, continuing his massacre for hours would not be a problem.”

“As such, when the Star Palace Master went on a killing spree back then and massacred for an hour, he massacred the experts of all the powerhouses to the point that they were all terrified. Moreover, back then, the Star Palace Master had also planned to fight his way into the bases of those powerhouses and destroy all of them. In the end, Emperor Bai from the higher-ups of the Sanctuary Alliance showed himself personally to resolve this matter.”

“Emperor Bai?” Jian Wushuang was stunned. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

According to what he knew, Emperor Bai was a supreme being and on normal days, he would be too lazy to care about the fights in the Sanctuary Alliance. Although the Star Palace Master’s massacre back then had caused an extremely huge commotion, was it still not enough for Emperor Bai to show himself?

“I have no idea why Emperor Bai decided to show himself. However, in the end, with the mediation of Emperor Bai, both parties came to an agreement where, from then on, all the powerhouses and sects are to not think of the Lineage of Star’s Secret Skill of Star Palace. Moreover, the Star Palace Master has also been restricted. In the Eternal Chaotic World, unless the other party comes to his doorstep of their own accord or they are being overly aggressive to the Lineage of Star, he must not unleash the Secret Skill of Star Palace to massacre wantonly,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood.

He also finally understood why all the powerhouses in the Eternal Chaotic World were so fearful of the Star Palace Master.

Moreover, even though his ranking in the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list then was greater than the Star Palace Master’s, he was still not a better deterrent than the Star Palace Master.

So it was due to that drop of blood.

Due to that drop of blood, the Star Palace Master could massacre wantonly and that was indeed frightening.

“If I were to unleash the Secret Skill of Star Palace with all my might, I would also be able to unleash fighting capabilities that were not inferior to that of a Great Emperor. However, I could only maintain that state for a breath’s time. As for the Star Palace Master, he could maintain it for hours,” Jian Wushuang gasped.

For a breath’s time, even if the other party were to stand still and allow him to kill them, Jian Wushuang would still be unable to kill many of them.

However, if it were hours… the Star Palace Master could definitely kill all the enemies who provoked him.

“After the wanton massacre by the Star Palace Master, a huge grudge was held between the Lineage of Star and those big powerhouses, as well as quite a number of experts who travelled alone. Although those big powerhouses and the experts who travelled alone were filled with hatred toward the Lineage of Star, they still had their greedy eyes cast on the Secret Skill of Star Palace. However, due to them being fearful of the Star Palace Master’s absolute abilities, no one dared to be reckless.”

“For many years, this has always been the case.”

“However, during the wanton massacre back then, more than half of the drop of blood that the Star Palace Master obtained was depleted. Be it the danger that he encountered while travelling in the Ancient Mystery Land or the Lairs, he had also unleashed the Secret Skill of Star Palace. As such, the drop of blood continued to decrease and during the past few years, not much of it was left.”

“The moment the drop of blood is completely depleted, the Star Palace Master will naturally lose his ability to frighten others. Then, if the experts from the powerhouses knew about it, they would probably start another great battle and the Lineage of Star will definitely be unable to stop it.”

“As the Star Palace Master knew about this, he tried to make a breakthrough to Great Emperor!”

“It is only by becoming a real Great Emperor that our Lineage of Star can rest easy.”

After hearing Hall Master Yuan’s words, Jian Wushuang, Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Shi Yun became silent.

Previously, when they had known that the Lineage of Star was in danger from Hall Master Yuan’s words, Hall Master Yuan had not made the danger clear to them. It was not until then that they understood the point.

At the same time, they also understood the Star Palace Master’s troubles.

“In other words, even though I am currently ranked thirty on the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, which is one position higher than that of the Star Palace Master, I am still unable to frighten those experts for real,” Jian Wushuang said with a heavy voice.

“That’s right,” Hall Master Yuan nodded his head, “If you really want to frighten those experts from the powerhouses who have cast their greedy eyes on the Secret Skill of Star Palace and also have a huge grudge against the Lineage of Star, it is still far from enough with the fighting capabilities of the top thirty of the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. What we need is the fighting capabilities of a Great Emperor and minimally, we would also need to have fighting capabilities comparable to the level of the Underworld God.”

“The Underworld God?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

The Underworld God was ranked sixteenth on the Heaven and Earth ranking list and he was the number one after the Great Emperors. As such, he was the strongest expert among the Emperor Gods.

In the six thousand years that Jian Wushuang had travelled in the ancient battlefield, he had obtained quite a number of opportunities and his abilities had risen considerably compared to the past. Previously, in the battle in the Deluge Fortress, he had also not used his full power. However, even if he were to use his full power, he would still be unable to compete with the Underworld God in terms of fighting capabilities.

Even Jian Yi, whose abilities were more powerful than his, was still slightly inferior to the Underworld God.

“Fighting capabilities at the level of the Underworld God. Although I am unable to achieve it now, as long as I am given time, I will have an opportunity to achieve it,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Jian Yi’s abilities were still recovering and at then, he had only recovered to Middle Stage Chaotic Realm. However, if he were to recover to the peak of Middle Stage Chaotic Realm, with his identity of an expert from the Ancient Past, his abilities would definitely not be weaker than those of the Underworld God. Moreover, his abilities might even be more powerful.

“Palace Master, at present, most of the experts who travelled alone and have huge grudges against the Lineage of Star have been eliminated by you. Hence, the remaining ones should be those big powerhouses. However, those powerhouses are not easy to deal with,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Jian Wushuang also understood.

For them to be able to become a big powerhouse in the Eternal Chaotic World, they were definitely not normal.

Perhaps even with the number of Almighties that the big powerhouses had on the surface, their abilities as a whole might still be inferior to those of the Deluge Fortress. However, what those big powerhouses were the most frightening in was not the number of experts they possessed. Instead, it was their great foundations.

There was a saying that a slight change would affect everything else and it could be best used to describe those big powerhouses.

If Jian Wushuang were to take action against a big powerhouse for real and if he wanted to destroy them completely, the big powerhouse would counterattack. As such, they would use all the resources that they had, as well as favors and friendships that they had accumulated throughout the years to get help from experts. Moreover, there would definitely be many arguments within the Sanctuary Alliance.

Jian Wushuang reckoned that if he wanted to destroy a random big powerhouse, it would definitely not be much easier than destroying the Deluge Fortress.

Moreover, if those experts who travelled alone knew of teaming up to go against the Lineage of Star, those big powerhouses would naturally team up in succession should they smell danger. By then, it would be even more troublesome.
