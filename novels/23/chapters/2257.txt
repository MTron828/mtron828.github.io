2258 Samsara

After the fight at Thunderbolt Island, most awoken Ancient Era experts were shocked and decided to simply stay put.

The peace of the Eternal Chaotic World was restored.

Jian Wushuang returned to Green Fire World, Wushuang City.

In the secret room, Jian Wushuang sat there cross-legged. In front of him was a floating grey pearl. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

It was the Reincarnation Pearl.

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes as his consciousness entered the Reincarnation Pearl.

Indeed, there was a small reincarnation inside that contained strong Reincarnation Rules of Order.

For Jian Wushuang, it was extremely profound.

“One-Star Man handed me something really useful for my Reincarnation Rules of Order,” Jian Wushuang smiled and immersed himself in enlightenment.

Time passed relentlessly, as 3,700 years passed by.

There were only two hundred more years till the Heaven’s Horizon’s link passage opened.

That was a very short period of time.

Wushuang City, in a large manor.

The manor had lush flowers and other sorts of fauna, full of life.

Jian Wushuang stood there with his eyes shut, hands clenched upon the Blood Mountain Sword.

“Reincarnation...”

“A flower, since its germination, to its blooming, to its withering, will only take months, or even days. In such a short period of time, it has undergone one cycle.”

“A tree, from its sprout, to its eventual natural death, or perhaps it was chopped down... one cycle.”

“A man, from life to death, a cycle.”

Jian Wushuang was murmuring.

Suddenly, he pulled out his sword.

He gradually lifted the Blood Mountain Sword, then plunged it towards the Void in front.

It seemed like a normal powerless jab, but immediately a reincarnation force came pouring out.

The lush manor garden immediately withered upon contact with the reincarnation power, losing all signs of life.

But that was the beginning.

The moment those flowers withered, new ones grew to replace it, then they withered again.

From germination to its withering.

From withering to new life.

The fauna in the manor seemed to be stuck in a cycle.

“This is reincarnation.”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and gave a faint smile upon seeing it.

“From life to death, one cycle. From death to life, another cycle.”

“Reincarnation is the cycle between life and death.”

“This sword brings about Reincarnation Power, allowing life around it to rest and be brought back to life. I shall name the sword move Samsara,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Samsara was the name of that sword move.

It had been a long time since Jian Wushuang had created his own Sword Principle. Ever since he had the Sword Principle Xuan Luo with him, he had only focused on increasing his own understanding of general swordsmanship – the Sword Principle Xuan Luo was enough.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo was impressive, but at the end of the day, it was the product of others. It suited Jian Wushuang, but he may not have been able to fully exert the power of it.

But self-created sword skills were different.

With his own Sword Principle, he could master it.

With Samsara, only Jian Wushuang would be able to demonstrate its full power.

Others would find it impossible to fully understand the hidden secrets behind the sword principle.

“The small reincarnation power within the Reincarnation Pearl... I learnt it for 3,700 years. I’m still far away from One-Star Man though. I may be able to use Samsara based upon my Reincarnation Rules of Order to affect fauna, but not humans yet.”

“If I attained a higher understanding of Reincarnation Rules of Order to affect cultivators, I could make them reincarnate from life to death, and from death to life in front of me. That would be scary,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

He knew he was far away from that goal.

As he was deep in thought, a figure slowly walked over.

“Emperor Bai, what brings you here today?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

It was Emperor Bai.

“I’m here for something,” Emperor Bai said as he looked at the surrounding manor.

The flowers in the manor were still going through life and death.

“What a cryptic method,” Emperor Bai was shocked.

“A mere parlour trick,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Emperor Bai gave Jian Wushuang a deep look with a strange expression on his face.

3,700 years ago at Thunderbolt Island, Jian Wushuang’s power had already shocked him. At that time, he realised Jian Wushuang’s power was perhaps slightly more powerful than him.

But now, he realised Jian Wushuang had become more unfathomable than before.

Evidently, he had improved tremendously.

Jian Wushuang was way ahead of him.

“The speed of Jian Wushuang’s progress is really scary,” Emperor Bai exclaimed secretly. “Jian Wushuang, I heard you were looking for someone all these years, that person was the original Holocaust Sect leader right?” Jian Wushuang flinched, but he admitted without answering.

The sect leader was Leng Ruxue.

Since the battle against Three Emperors World 30,000 years ago, Leng Ruxue had disappeared. He had used the Sanctuary Alliance to help track her down as well, to no avail.

But now, Emperor Bai had come down personally...

“Did you find her?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Indeed,” Emperor Bai nodded. “Eternal Chaotic World seems peaceful these years, but trouble is brewing behind the scenes. Especially those Ancient Era experts. More have awoken these past 3,000 years.”
