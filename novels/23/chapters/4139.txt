“The people in that universe boat are from the Great Sun Godly nation. Are they here as well?”

“That’s the universe boat of the Great Void Godly Palace. Tsk, tsk. I heard that the Great Void Godly sect recently produced an extremely powerful Ultimate Ruler. I wonder if that Ultimate Ruler is here this time.”

“Yes, that belongs to the people of Blood Sky Palace, right? The people of Blood Sky Palace have always been elusive. I have not heard of their traces for so many years. I did not expect that they would send a Ruler to Tarot Ruins this time around.”

“It has only been over 10,000 years since Tarot Ruins was discovered. It is said that less than 10 percent of this ruin has been developed so far. All the powers in the universe, regardless of how strong or weak they are, are extremely eager for this Tarot Ruins. They know that it is dangerous inside, and there are many great beings from the powers participating in it. However, they are still sending people over one after another.”

The Ruler Violet Eye and the others shook their heads and discussed as they watched the starry sky streak past the giant universe boats through the Mystic Light Mirror of the universe boat.

Each of them held a sheepskin scroll in their hands, which recorded the basic information of the Tarot Ruins.

Jian Wushuang also had a sheepskin scroll, which was given to them by Ruler Blood Wave. The contents of the sheepskin scroll were the information that Zhufeng King’s team had sent back when they were exploring the Tarot Ruins.

According to the intelligence, the Tarot Ruins should have been a huge secret realm created by Ruler Blood Wave before his death. It was vast and boundless, and Zhufeng King and the others guessed that there should be more than one level of the secret realm.

However, they did not know how many levels there were in the secret realm.

In any case, he had been circling around the first level for the past 10,000 years.

“More than one level?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

He remembered that when he entered the Red Cloud Secret Land, there were three levels, and he had obtained a great opportunity in the Red Cloud Secret Land.

At the end of the sheepskin scroll, it was mentioned that Zhufeng King and the others seemed to have found the entrance to the second level of the Tarot vestige and were trying to find a way to enter the second level.

However, at this moment, the team of Zhufeng King encountered a crisis and was completely annihilated.

“What happened to Zhufeng King in the Tarot Vestige? Was he killed by the overlords of other forces, or was there a danger or danger in the second floor?” Jian Wushuang closed the scroll and frowned slightly.

If the former could kill Zhufeng King and annihilate the team of Zhufeng King, then the other party must be very powerful.

But if the latter was the case, it meant that not only were there all the opportunities, but there was also a great danger hidden in the Tarot vestige.

Jian Wushuang shook his head and stopped thinking about it.

Soon, the seven of them arrived at the entrance of the Tarot vestige.

The star-sun Star Field was barren, but the entrance of the Tarot vestige was quite prosperous.

The major forces set up camp outside the Tarot vestige. Some restaurants, elixir pavilions, and trade markets were established. Jian Wushuang even saw the Nine Emperor Pavilion outside the Tarot vestige.

“Let’s go.” Ninth Kalpa King led Jian Wushuang and the others out of the universe boat. He waved his hand and put the universe boat away.

The moment Jian Wushuang and the others walked out of the universe boat, countless eyes immediately looked at them.

Most of them were focused on Ninth Kalpa King.

“It’s the Rulers of the Life Palace. The leader is…Ninth Kalpa King?”

“Ninth Kalpa King? He’s actually here!”

“Apparently, this Ninth Kalpa King is a legendary perfect being who has remained at the Omega Ruler level for dozens of chaos cycles. His combat power is comparable to that of Rulers, and there are quite a few omega Rulers in the Life Palace. However, this Ninth Kalpa King is undoubtedly the most powerful of them all. Why would the Life Palace send him out for the sake of the Tarot Ruins?”

Many of the Rulers in the crowd looked at the Ninth Kalpa King with a hint of fear in their eyes.

There was nothing they could do. The Ninth Kalpa King’s fame in the universe was simply too great.

Just his legendary status as a perfect being was enough to draw attention to him.

In addition, he had been an Omega Ruler for dozens of chaos cycles, and even his comprehension of the principles of the universe was extremely high. No one present dared to underestimate an omega Ruler like him. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Compared to the Ninth Kalpa King, the other six were clearly overshadowed by the Ninth Kalpa King.

In fact, the Ruler Violet Eye and Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves were nearly invincible amongst the Ultimate Rulers. They were the best amongst the many Ultimate Rulers present, and they were quite famous as well, unfortunately, the surrounding people only paid attention to the Ninth Kalpa King. Few cared about them.

“Thousand leaves, did you see that? They are all talking about the Ninth Kalpa King,” said the Ruler Violet Eye with a faint smile.

“In terms of strength, the Ninth Kalpa King is indeed much stronger than the two of us. But no matter what, the two of us should not be completely ignored,” said Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves coldly.

“It’s probably because there are too many Ultimate Rulers coming from the Tarot Ruins. Many of the best ones have come as well. The two of us aren’t as eye-catching as the Ninth Kalpa King, right?” Said the Ruler Violet Eye with a smile.

Indeed, the appearance of the Tarot Ruins had attracted too many Ultimate Rulers. Various factions in the universe had sent Ultimate Rulers over, and there was no lack of peak existences among them.

There were many nearly invincible Ultimate Rulers like Ruler Purple Eye and Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves in the Tarot Ruins, so naturally, there were fewer people paying attention to them.

But Ninth Kalpa King was different. He was at least one of the top three Ultimate Rulers in the vast universe.

Naturally, more people paid attention to him.

Suddenly…a figure appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and the others without any warning.

“Ninth Kalpa King, long time no see.” A cold voice sounded.

Everyone looked over and saw a black-robed young man with an aquiline nose staring coldly at the Ninth Kalpa King.

“Silver Roc, it’s you?”

The Ninth Kalpa King’s pupils constricted and he laughed coldly, “Silver Roc, three million years ago, you luckily escaped from me. I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to find you, but now you actually dare to appear in front of me?”

A cold light flashed through the hawk-nosed man called Silver Roc’s eyes, he said coldly, “Ninth Kalpa King, you also know that it was three million years ago?

“Three million years is enough to do many things. Since you’ve come to the Tarot Ruins this time, then the grudge between us should be resolved in the ruins.”

“I’ll accompany you at any time.” The Ninth Kalpa King laughed coldly, not afraid at all.

What a joke. With his strength, who could make him respect a Ruler?

The hawk-nosed man turned his gaze to the Ruler Violet Eye and the others. He swept his gaze past them, his cold gaze causing their hearts to tremble.

Suddenly, his gaze froze.
