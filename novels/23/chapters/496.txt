Chapter 497: Enemy of the Whole World

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The vast Divine Land was not as quiet as it looked.

The messages Su Ming sent attracted the attention of all the old monsters in the Divine Land.

Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian stopped on a mountain outside Sword-suppression Valley.

Since they knew they could not shake off Marquis Zizhong and Marquis Xuefeng, the father and son gave up running.

After a while, a towering figure arrived.

He was a benevolent-looking white-robed elder, who looked as if he had bathed in sunshine and was covered by a saintly halo.

A stream of affable aura radiated from him.

It gave the surrounding experts a feeling as if their faces were being caressed by their mothers.

The aura was so overwhelming that all the Sword Principle experts lost the courage to resist.

“This man!”

Though Blind Emperor was blind, he still recognized the elder using his mind.

“Holy Ancestor!” Blind Emperor ground out.

Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian were shocked.

“Holy Ancestor, you’re quite fast!” A cold voice rang out.

A purple-clothed woman appeared in the nearby area.

Buzz... The surrounding void suddenly shivered, causing bizarre waves to spread out. It let out a faint hum, which sounded like an ethereal tune, and reverberated through the whole area.

Then, more experts began to show up, one by one, all with auras powerful enough to terrify a marquis.

In the blink of an eye, a dozen people had gathered in the area.

Some looked cold, some were excited, and some looked evil. Each of them was far superior to any marquis and even some sovereigns.

Looking at those powerful experts, all the other Sword Principle experts were petrified.

“This, this is?”

“Holy Ancestor, Spirit Ancestor, and Stone Ancestor, the Three Ancestors of our Divine Land have gathered!”

“Gosh!”

The entire crowd was shocked.

The Three Ancestors had been a legend in the Divine Land. Normally, it was rare to meet a marquis, but now, the Three Ancestors gathered?

What did this mean?

“Those people? Who are they? They dare to stand beside the Three Ancestors.”

“The Three Ancestors were the strongest in our Divine Land, right? But those other people, where are they from? I feel that they are not weaker than the Three Ancestors.”

“What, what happened?”

All the spectators were confused.

The Three Ancestors were known as the supreme experts of the Divine Land. Each of them had reached the Cloud Realm.

Every ancestor possessed extremely mighty strength.

The Nine Sovereigns were second to them.

The Nine Sovereigns had only reached the Dao. Although they were also at the Cloud Realm, they could not hold a candle to the Three Ancestors. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, now, eight experts stood alongside the Three Ancestors.

There were eight experts as strong as the Three Ancestors in the Divine Land!

“We haven’t seen you for many years. How are you?”

“Blood Bladesman, you still like being a beggar. Are you addicted to it?”

“Hum, what’s wrong with a beggar? I can take the earth as my bed and the sky as my quilt. I can drink whenever I want. I am very carefree!”

“Dong Ming King, you’re still in this land?”

The dozen supreme experts began exchanging greetings while standing in the air.

After a while, Su Ming came over.

“Su Ming pay his respects to the masters.”

Su Ming, who always held a condescending attitude, behaved modestly because these experts were stronger than him.

“Su Ming, you said you have news on the whereabouts of the Sword Ancestor Cave Mansion. I hope for your sake that you weren’t joking, or...” Holy Ancestor said slowly. Every word contained a mighty deterrence.

Su Ming was a bit nervous but immediately smiled. “Masters, don’t worry. Since I sent the messages, I do have something to tell you...”

Su Ming began explaining.

Jian Wushuang, Jian Nantian, and Blind Emperor gathered on the back of the mountain. They all had terrible expressions.

“They are super experts in the Cloud Realm!”

Jian Wushuang stared at those experts. Each of them had an overwhelming aura which could terrify him.

Though Su Ming was good at Illusory Sword Principle, his aura was not powerful.

However, now, the aura of these experts had made the young boy lose the courage to fight.

“I can’t figure out why our master died and who was able to kill him,” Blind Emperor murmured, “After all, our master was the supreme expert in the whole Divine Land. Even if the Three Ancestors allied, they could not fight against him or kill him!”

“But now, I understand!”

“The ones who fought our Master were not the Three Ancestors, but a group of super Cloud Realm experts! Maybe more than that!”

Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian wore a serious look.

Now they were being targetted by the whole world.

They could not help but think of that.

Su Ming said he would let them experience the desperation Sword Ancestor felt.

Now they understood what he meant.

“If I guess right, those experts should have come from the outside world,” Blind Emperor said seriously.

On hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s face fell.

There was always someone stronger than you.

Jian Wushuang knew there were bigger worlds outside of the Divine Land.

After all, he had met Leng Rushuang several times. Though she rarely showed her power, Jian Wushuang could guess some things from what Di Jing had said.

Di Jing said that he was the seventh War God under the command of Emperor Xiao from Tang of the East!

It had proven that Leng Rushuang and Di Jing came from the outside world.
