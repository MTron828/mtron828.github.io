“Here we go.”

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath. The ten Divine Yin Thunders, which had grown to the fullest extent inside his body, gathered and immediately began to fuse.

There were three Levels for the Secret Skill of Divine Yin Thunder.

The first level began with the formation of a Divine Yin Thunder. Ten Divine Yin Thunders was the peak of Level One.

On Level Two, the ten thunders would be fused together and evolve into a more advanced and stronger Divine Yin Thunder.

Right now, Jian Wushuang started the fusion.

Each of the thunder was extremely wild and violent. When ten of them were fusing together, the process was very fierce and a huge burden to both the body and mind. Even a Dao Master couldn’t withstand such pain.

Jian Wushuang had an extraordinarily strong willpower. Besides, he was fully prepared for this. The severe pain caused by the fusion process did not affect him too much.

Half a day later, the ten divine thunders fused together and began to metamorphosize.

The most difficult and dangerous process was over. Metamorphosis was just a matter of time.

After a short while, there was only one Divine Yin Thunder left inside his body.

This one was smaller than the previous ones, but with much stronger power.

The newly evolved Divine Yin Thunder was scarlet.

Yes, a scarlet divine thunder!

Jian Wushuang flipped his hand and the scarlet thunder appeared on his palm. Seeing this, his eyebrow raised.

He could feel a terrifying aura hidden inside the scarlet thunder. Such aura was enough to be a threat to even a Dao Master.

“The Level Two of Divine Yin Thunder!” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists, looking pleasantly surprised.

The power of Divine Yin Thunder will improve dramatically with each advancement to a higher level.

Now that it had reached Level Two, the thunder’s power was at least ten times stronger than before, which also brought great improvement to his strength.

“This Secret Skill of Divine Yin Thunder was so powerful. I was lucky enough to have the Thunder Sea of Thunder Palace to help assist cultivation. Otherwise, I would have to wait for God knows how long to reach Level Two!” He looked around Thunder Sea with a light smile.

He noticed that when the Divine Yin Thunder inside his body reached Level Two, the surrounding Thunder Sea was no longer useful to him.

If he wanted to continue to upgrade the Divine Yin Thunder, he had to rely on himself.

“Zi Dong also practices the Divine Yin Thunder. He reached Level Two a long time ago, but stopped there ever since. It must be because the thunder palace can no longer be of any help.” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

Although the Thunder Palace had lost its purpose, Jian Wushuang did not care.

“For more than two hundred years, I had trained meticulously on the Star Island. My power improved at an amazing speed because of the island’s resources and the fights with those experts here.”

“Now, my Sword Heart has reached level six, the peak of level six!”

“I’m more skilled with the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation now and its power is stronger. Speaking of Level, I now have a perfect mastery of its first sword formation—Traceless Sword!”

“After two hundred years of practice, my Star-river Secret Skill had reached Level 15. The basic power was three times stronger than before.”

“There is also the Divind Yin Thunder, which has now reached Level Two.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes shone brightly.

“Compared with two hundred years ago, I’m much more powerful in strength.”

“I have reached the top in every field and it is difficult to make too much progress in a short period of time.”

“That is to say, even if I were given a few hundred years or more, my strength would not advance rapidly.”

“I have made every possible breakthrough and upgraded to the maximum!”

“Next…I should try to pass the third level of the Black Tower!”

The third level was much more difficult than the second level.

Two hundred years ago, after passing Level Two, Jian Wushuang tried to pass the third level. However, the gap was greater than expected.

Today, his strength had tremendously improved in every aspect. He was qualified enough to challenge the third level now.

On the Star Island, four tall Black Towers stood silently.

On the roof of a pavilion near the Black Tower, two figures were sitting in front of a chessboard. They were playing chess; both were holding black and white pieces respectively.

Life on the Star Island was as dry as a chip. Playing chess was one of the few things that could kill time.

Just then…

“Hmm?” The slender elder holding the white pieces suddenly moved his eyes and looked toward the Black Tower. “Look! Isn’t that Blood Mountain?”

“Blood Mountain?” The other man looked over. “Yes, it’s him, the monster.”

“I heard that he’s been practicing like crazy. Why did he come here today?” The lean elder wore a strange expression and said, “Judging from his direction, he’s heading toward the Black Tower, isn’t he?”

Speaking of which, the slender elder suddenly thought of a possibility.

“Is he going to challenge the Black Tower?”

“Two hundred years ago, he just passed Level Two. Now, he is going to try Level Three?”

The expressions of the two elders grew excited at once.

The Black Tower seldom had visitors. Those who came to challenge the tower all had confidence in their strength and believed they could pass.

Jian Wushuang came here, which meant that he had the confidence to pass Level Three.

“It’s just more than two hundred years, and he is already confident enough to pass Level Three?” The slender elder was a little stunned, but reacted immediately. “Quick! Inform the others.”

“Two hundred years later, Blood Mountain came back to the Black Tower again. This is a big event. Spread the news and let everyone know.”

“Good, quick!”

The two men moved immediately.

The Star Island was a small place with just a few people.

It was very easy for them to spread the news. All they needed to do was to shout from high up.

In a moment, everyone on Star Island was aware of the event.

The entire Star Island was shaken instantly.
