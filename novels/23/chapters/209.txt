“Hurry up! Kill him!”

Grayrobe’s shouting was loud and reverberated throughout Sky Valley.

The 12 purple-masked killers who were fighting with Jian Wushuang heard it.

“Quit dawdling and attack in full force. Also, swallow the Purple Coagulation Elixir immediately if you have one,” Ghost Tiger shouted lowly, then he turned over his hand and promptly swallowed a purple elixir.

Among the other 11 killers, there were seven who momentarily swallowed their elixirs.

Eight people swallowed elixirs in total and their strength rapidly increased.

Jian Wushuang was stunned at this scene.

“Purple Coagulation Elixir?”

Jian Wushuang knew the Purple Coagulation Elixir. It was usually used by experts of the Yin Void Realm and it could improve one’s strength in seconds with almost no side-effect, for the improvement was limited.

Once these eight people swallowed the Purple Coagulation Elixirs, their strength improved a lot.

“It seems that I should go all out,”?Jian Wushuang thought with the corners of his mouth quirked up.?“Alright, I don’t want it to last long.”

“After I combined four sword essences, my strength was greatly improved. What’s more, I gained a special power...”

“I had never known this special power before. But now, let me test it with these purple-masked killers of Blood Feather Tower.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold and at this moment he just glided out.

“Kill!”

All the 12 purple-masked killers moved again. The swallowed Purple Coagulation Elixir generated for them a great enhancement in their breath. Ghost Tiger stabbed his blood-colored red blade toward Jian Wushuang.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang also waved his Long Sword.

The third move of Selfless Sword Technique: Sky Isolating Form!

This was the same Sky Isolating Form, but its power was totally different because of the combination of four sword essences.

A golden flowing light crossed the sky like a shooting star.

In a second, it appeared in front of Ghost Tiger.

The golden, flowing light with great strength was immersed with a special power and instantly its light became much more dazzling.

It crashed with the blood-red blade... bang! The blood-red blade in Ghost Tiger’s hands became crooked and the bones of his one arm, which was holding the blood-red blade, were cracked.

“How...” Ghost Tiger’s eyes were full of astonishment. But the golden flowing light turned slightly and then pierced through his head!

Puff!

After the golden flowing light shoot through Ghost Tiger’s head, the power didn’t weaken but rushed directly to another purple-masked killer at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm.

“What’s the hell.” The purple-masked killer had no time to react but rashly resisted it with his blood-red blade.

Clang!

Puff!

The strong and attacking golden flowing light struck the blood-red blade away overwhelmingly, then shot through the purple-masked killer’s head.

“Jesus!”

“It’s so strong!”

The other purple-masked killers who rushed to Jian Wushuang from around were shocked and their faces changed a lot.

One movement killed two purple-masked killers in succession. Moreover, they were at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm and had swallowed Purple Coagulation Elixirs.

Before they recovered from their shock, Jian Wushuang appeared in front of three purple-masked killers with a simple turn.

The dazzling and golden flowing light flew out again.

The three purple-masked killers opened their eyes and tried to stop it desperately, but...

Chi! Chi! Chi!

The golden, flowing Light swept over their necks and instantly cut off their heads.

Jian Wushuang then moved again.

“Run!”

The purple-masked killers of Blood Feather Tower tried to flee away at once.

They feared so much.

The strength displayed by Jian Wushuang was so horrible and they couldn’t help but feel frightened. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

They had already forgotten to kill Jian Wushuang. Instead, they were hoping not to be killed by him.

Though they fled to the east and the west, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t let them off.

“All of the people belonging to Blood Feather Tower have to die!”

The killing intent in Jian Wushuang’s eyes was strong and after killing five purple-masked killers in succession, he moved again along with the golden, flowing light.

Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!

One by one.

These purple-masked killers, who approached Jian Wushuang quite directly just now, had no time to flee away from his long sword in such a short time because they were so close to him.

Just in an instant, the 12 purple-masked killers were all killed. No one was escaped.

After killing them, Jian Wushuang raised his head and looked toward the upper void.

For Grayrobe’s voice coming from the upper void, he heard it. Therefore, he rose in the air and flew directly to the upper void.

The upper void was in dead silence at this moment, though there were a great number of experts gathered there.

All of them were shocked by what happened under the void.

“The special power contained in his swordsmanship, is it... the Origin?”

The words exploded in the upper void.

“Origin!”

“Sword Way Source!”

“Source Energy!”

“He comprehended the Sword Way Source? Unbelievable!”

“How is it possible? ”

All the people who were sitting in their chairs stood up; all of their eyes were full of astonishment.

The monarchs of the 12 dynasties and experts of the old sects were stunned.

Even Mo Lingtian, who had always looked down upon Jian Wushuang before, was shocked as well.

“Origin? It was Origin!”

Mo Lingtian was also totally shocked.

Origin!

Above the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth.

For a warrior when he cultivated, improving the Spiritual Power was only one aspect. The most important aspect was the comprehension of the essence of Heaven and Earth cultivation.

The comprehension was firstly reflected in essence realm.

After thoroughly understanding, they would combine them together.

That was the end of comprehension of essence realm, but not the comprehension of the Heaven and Earth.

Above the essence realm was the Origin!

Those powerful Original Sword Techniques... such as Formless Swordsmanship.

It was recognized as the most outstanding, finest swordsmanship in the Tianzong Dynasty because it was an Original Sword Technique that required comprehension of the Origin!

The Selfless Sword Technique was also an Original Sword Technique which required comprehension of the Origin.

The Origin was much more powerful than the essence realm. It was because it was so strong that it was abstruse and difficult to comprehend.

It was easy for warriors to comprehend the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth. In general, warriors of Primordial Gold Core Realm could try to comprehend essence realm, and some geniuses’ comprehension of Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth would reach a high level when they were in Level of Transforming Sea.

But the origin... a warrior in the Yin-Yang Void Realm, even at the peak of Yang Void Realm, who could comprehend it was rare.
