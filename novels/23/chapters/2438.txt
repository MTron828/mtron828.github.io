Chapter 2439: Fury

Ling Dan looked at Jian Wushuang. “Junior Brother Wushuang, you don’t seem to be worried at all. If I were you and got in such big trouble, I would’ve probably been scared to death and wouldn’t dare to stay in Wusha Wilderness, let alone Ancient Star Temple.”

Jian Wushuang gave out a big laugh. “Haha! As a matter of fact, the situation isn’t as bad as you think. After all, the people that I’ve killed were those drooling over the position token in my hand. They were killed because they tried to take it from me. In Saint’s Tomb, life and death in those battles for opportunities have always been up to fate. Those sects won’t be able to point fingers.”

“However, what Senior Brother Zhong Yi just said reminded me that it’s easy to dodge an attack out in the open, but harder to prevent one in the dark. If those sects are looking for trouble with me, I’ll just endure it. There’s nothing to worry about. However, I’m more worried about them playing tricks, such as making a move on my parents just for revenge...”

“Father, Mother?” Zhuo Bing’s face changed.

Her father, Zhuo Yunfeng was only in Half-Step Divine Demon Realm and her mother Luo Xinqin was only had a common Chaotic Realm cultivation level. If those sects intended to seek revenge and sent any of their Divine Demons, the Zhuo couple would not be able to withstand them.

“Little Brother, what should we do?” Zhuo Bing looked over.

Jian Wushuang squinted. “Father and Mother live in Anjiu Commandery, it would take time for even the nearest sect to do anything to them. In a minute, I’ll request Elder Wujian to send people over to Anjiu Commandery to protect our parents. It would be best if they could relocate, or simply be brought to Narcissus Island.”

“That’s right, that’s right! They must be protected immediately.” Zhuo Bing kept nodding.

“Junior Brother Wushuang, I’m now preparing to report what happened here to the Second Elder. Why not let me make the request for you?” said Zhong Yi.

“No need to be hasty. You don’t need to report what happened to them because they will soon come over to find us.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Zhong Yi paused for a moment and immediately understood. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

At the same moment, in the wide glade outside of Saint’s Tomb...

Those leading Elders from various sects of Wusha Wilderness had gathered there and were quietly waiting.

In one of the corners...

“Haha, Linghe, looks like your Narcissus Island has produced a freak!”

“Truly, he could fight a Second-Class Divine Demon during Early Stage Chaotic Realm and now he had passed a trial bridge’s challenge in Saint’s Tomb, obtaining the relics of Purple Blood Saint. This kid, Jian Wushuang has a bright future ahead of him!”

“Wujian, I heard that you were the one who brought Jian Wushuang onto Narcissus Island. That kid was also invited to join the Great Compassion Sect at the same time and Fan Jianxian from the Great Compassion Sect had even intended to take him as his personal disciple. You are truly something to be able to bring that kid under such conditions to Narcissus Island.”

Some elders from certain sects were surrounding the three Narcissus Island elders and casually chatting with a sense of flattery in their tones.

When the word about Jian Wushuang’s background started spreading in Saint’s Tomb, the elders from various sects naturally knew about it. Such an incredible demon had inevitably become the hottest topic among those elders.

The elders from various sects felt envious, even jealous, toward Narcissus Island.

They were jealous that Narcissus Island had such an unbelievable genius in sword principles.

Given some time, this sword genius could probably jump up the ranks and hold a status among the Gods. He could even progress towards becoming an Undying Saint after that, such would obviously make those elders envious.

The two elders from Narcissus Island and Elder Wujian were delighted from listening to those various sects’ experts giving flattering words.

Elder Wujian wore an obvious pride on his face and even looked over at the Seventh Elder next to him.

Previously, the Seventh Elder had a few conflicts with him especially when he gave Jian Wushuang the Elder Token and recommended him to participate in Saint’s Tomb. The Seventh Elder made things extra difficult for him as he did not look highly upon Jian Wushuang at all at that time. However, this Seventh Elder now kept quiet, stood in, and dare not look at Wujian at all.

It was understandable, as the Seventh Elder himself felt really agonized as well.

“That kid, he’s obviously an outer disciple. Who would’ve thought that he is such a big freak? Plus, he is a low profile big freak who concealed his abilities and talents. Who would’ve known that with such terrifying talents, he was content to be only an outer disciple? If no one exposed his true background, I’m afraid all of the superiors on Narcissus Island would still be in the dark, except Wujian.”

The Seventh Elder secretly exclaimed.

He acknowledged that he had been shortsighted over the issue of Jian Wushuang and was unable to recognize his talents, hence he had nothing to say when Wujian pridefully showed off at him.

Nonetheless, he felt a sense of joy and excitement.

At the end of the day, he was an elder from Narcissus Island and thus felt happy that they had such an amazing disciple.

However, just when the three Narcissus Island elders were feeling joyful, rumbling and horrifying energy suddenly exploded on the glade.

As the energy blew up, it caught the attention of all the experts on the glade.

Various pairs of eyes looked over at the direction of where the energy exploded, and that was where those experts from the Great Compassion Sect were.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

Five figures had risen from the ground.

Of those five people, four of them were elders from the Great Compassion Sect who led the disciples. The fifth person was widely regarded as the number one genius of the Great Compassion Sect, as well as Wusha Wilderness, the first-ranked Twelve Minor Kings, Tu Qiancheng!

At that moment, they looked extremely furious with horrifying energy emitting from five of them.

“Linghe, your Narcissus Island disciple has such audacity!”

That explosive shout came from a Great Compassion Sect elder whose cultivation level was at Peak Divine Demon. Following that shout, the five experts directly appeared in front of the three elders from Narcissus Island. Five bolts of Peak Divine Demon energy had completely locked-on them.

That scene had made all the experts from various sects dumbfounded.

“What’s the meaning of this?”

“Why are the experts of the Great Compassion Sect so angry at Narcissus Island?”

“Maybe It is because those Narcissus Island disciples had some run-ins with those from the Great Compassion Sect? However, it doesn’t seem like those Narcissus Island disciples would have the galls to seek trouble with those from the Great Compassion Sect.”

The experts were all puzzled.

Not only them, but even the Second Elder Linghe, Wujian, and the Seventh Elder from Narcissus Island were also completely stunned.

“My friends from the Great Compassion Sect, what has caused such anger in you? Perhaps our disciples from Narcissus Island had offended you in Saint’s Tomb?” Elder Linghe asked with a tone of modesty.

“You still didn’t know why we’re so furious?”

The experts from the Great Compassion Sect had their faces flushed red, obviously trying hard to suppress their anger.
