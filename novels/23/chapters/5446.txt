Chapter 5445 ¬†Time Acceleration

Fortunately, it was only a consciousness. If it were a true Universe Master, Jian Wushuang wouldn't dare to act this way.

It would be a great disrespect.

However, the First True King didn't seem to mind much. Despite being violently beaten, he actually appreciated Jian Wushuang.

"No wonder I couldn't predict you. You must have a unique encounter, probably related to the starry sky!" While being beaten, Grandmaster was secretly amused, contemplating Jian Wushuang's identity.

In the vast expanse of the starry sky, there were different powerhouses in various timelines.

For example, in the Moro Time-Space, figures like Qishen could emerge. In contrast, the current timeline, the original universe, lacked even a Universe Master, making it quite awkward.

Among the powerhouses that the Three Kings couldn't predict, besides Jian Wushuang, there were Hu Qing and Jiang Shang. These two had entered the inheritance space set up by the Soul King.

They went to receive the inheritance of the Soul Dao.

Among these individuals, the one most likely to obtain the complete inheritance was probably Broly. A powerhouse of the Transformation Dao was almost a sure thing.

Searching through the Four Great Secret Realms and even considering everyone in the Original Universe, there was probably only one Transformation Dao powerhouse.

Moreover, the murals had predicted early on that Broly would enter Square Inch Mountain and receive the complete inheritance.

Jian Wushuang and those without faces... Thre had been no predictions for their future paths.

If their paths were predicted, given Jian Wushuang's current mindset, he wouldn't have entered the predicted inheritance.

Once bitten by a snake, one becomes fearful at the sight of a rope for ten years.

Being manipulated by Shen Ling, he was genuinely afraid.

The mysterious fall of Bai Junwang, and the resurrection of the Universe Master 'Fuego' who emerged from the starry sky.

Next time, would he be asked to resurrect that giant egg?

After all, his Power of All Things could revive everything, and resurrecting a giant egg should be feasible.

On this point, Jian Wushuang's guess was surprisingly accurate.

At the beginning, Shen Ling had intended to devour him, but at that time, Jian Wushuang was too weak, and devouring him wouldn't have restored Shen Ling's strength. DiisCoover ùíñpdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)coùíé

He had already bid farewell to everything before; in the future, he would not have any connection with Shen Ling.

At the same time...

Crash!

He once again sent Grandmaster flying.

Although he could severely injure the opponent, true killing or defeating seemed impossible. The opponent was like a fluffy cotton, impervious to damage.

Jian Wushuang felt an illusion; the realm of the Universe Master shouldn't be limited to such abilities.

"Senior, aren't you going to unleash your full power?" He couldn't help but look towards Grandmaster. If they continued like this, trying to deplete his Power of All Things was simply wishful thinking.

The First True King finally stabilized his stance and remarked unexpectedly, "It seems your insights are extraordinary. You even understand the methods of the Universe Master!"

Understanding the methods of an Emperor was impressive enough for a Dao Lord.

¬†However, having insights into the Universe Master's techniques was quite unrealistic.

Jian Wushuang didn't know much, but after devouring a strand of the Universe Master's Origin Source, he gained some understanding. It was only superficial, but it still surpassed the ignorance of many Emperors.

Most others, especially the Emperors from the Original Universe, knew little about the supreme-peak, let alone the power of Universe Masters.

It was only in the Qishen Temple that they gained a bit of knowledge.

"Senior, you praised me too much!" He spoke politely, but his actions were ruthlessly severe.

There was no other choice; the gap in realms was too vast.

He couldn't use the Ultimate Sword Techniques; all he could do was engage in close combat, relying on his powerful divine body to suppress the opponent.

This approach seemed somewhat inconsistent with the demeanor of a strong cultivator, and the means were straightforward.

Grandmaster evaded one punch, but another one came right after. This time, he didn't hold back, lips moved slightly, and he calmly said, "Freeze!"

Silence!

When the word 'Freeze' was uttered, the flow of time abruptly decelerated, almost reaching a complete standstill.

Jian Wushuang found himself frozen in mid-air.

The First True King leisurely stepped back.

"Hmm?"

A punch missed its target.

Jian Wushuang was surprised; this was his universe. Even if Grandmaster's spatial realm was higher, it shouldn't be fast enough to this extent. Clearly, he had just reached the opponent's face, yet he missed.

Moreover, he felt that he had slowed down.

Something was off, but he couldn't quite pinpoint the issue.

When he charged again, he deliberately separated into 16 avatars to surround the opponent, yet he still failed this time.

"Something's wrong!" Jian Wushuang stopped his movement, refraining from attacking.

The First True King casually pointed a finger, saying, "Quick!"

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!!!

Jian Wushuang suddenly felt his entire being being engulfed by a force, his countenance becoming increasingly haggard, and his aura weakening.

Although he had only retreated for a moment, he felt as if he had lived countless years. The exhaustion made his mental state undergo changes.

"This is time!" Jian Wushuang's gaze was shocked!

Only time could make them so passive. Faced with such a technique, he felt somewhat at a loss.

Even the Universe Master couldn't casually alter the flow of time, right?

This wasn't comparable to the broken goods in the Time House.

His time sped up, but the opponent's time remained normal.

And it was just a moment; he experienced millennia. This acceleration seemed a bit too fast.

Although the First True King's expression remained calm, he was even more astonished by Jian Wushuang.

The first time he altered time, he used his own Origin Source of Time, but it could only freeze Jian Wushuang for an instant in this universe.

Unable to defeat Jian Wushuang directly, they had to rely on other forces, causing time to slip away in an instant and directly weakening Jian Wushuang's strength to a feeble state.

At this point, Jian Wushuang couldn't even sustain a 10,000-fold divine body, and his Heavenly Demon form was already shattered, while the Origin Source was also very weak.

He slumped down all at once.

This method was something Jian Wushuang encountered for the first time.

His One Though Universe had long since dissipated.

"I lost!"

Jian Wushuang touched his own cheek and, feeling the reality, couldn't help but feel somewhat unwilling.

The disparity was too great, and he had done his best.

He had once extracted some mysteries from the cosmic Origin Source, gained some insights, although his understanding of time was only superficial.

However, he didn't think it could be manipulated to such an exaggerated extent as it was now.

Even at the level of Dao Lord, how could time be used to such an absurd degree?

If it were Grandmaster's true power, he would have been done for at a glance‚Äînot by killing or suppressing him, but by letting time erode him away.

Although the lifespan of Yan Immortals could be considered infinite, once the soul weakened and the mental will diminished, it would lead to self-collapse.

Only the Origin Source and the physical body were truly eternal.

Even the divine body would gradually dissipate.
