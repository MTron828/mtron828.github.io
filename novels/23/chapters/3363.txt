Translator: EndlessFantasy TranslationEditor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“All of you should die!”

Demon Master Chen Huo was completely mad. At this moment, he was like a peerless ferocious beast from ancient times. His body suddenly flashed, and no one had the time to react, he had already appeared in front of the nearest Principles Master from Xiaoyao Mansion. Then, his right hand struck out

like lightning, directly piercing through the god body of that Principles Master, and the strange power contained in that palm…almost instantly, all the divine power of the Principles Master in the second realm of the void realm was destroyed.

In the blink of an eye, the Principles Master of the Xiaoyao Mansion had died.

“Thi:

The other Principles Masters around were shocked when they saw this scene.

Jian Wushuang, on the other hand, immediately made his move…

“Paint the ground as a prison, space-time binding!” Jian Wushuang waved his hand, and the vast power of space-time principles that covered the surrounding area instantly covered Demon Master Chen Huo.

Space-time binding…was also a move in the space-time prison. It was used to restrict the opponent’s movements while completely confining the surrounding space-time.

However, when the space-time binding was applied to Demon Master, he only shook his body slightly and then broke free.

“As expected, my space-time binding, even with the help of the golden sky-painting flag, can only restrict an ordinary expert of the fifth void realm. It’s impossible to restrict an expert of the sixth void realm like Demon Master.” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

He had to find a way to stop Demon Master Chen Huo. Otherwise, if he continued to kill like this, there would be no one in the secret realm who could escape.

suddenly, Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. He shouted at Demon Master Chen Huo, “Demon Master Chen Huo, your Amethyst Demon Sect has been destroyed. As a genius elder of the Amethyst Demon Sect, don’t you want to avenge the Amethyst Demon Sect?”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was loud and clear, echoing throughout the secret realm of heaven and earth. Of course, Demon Master Chen Huo heard it clearly, and his body suddenly stopped in the void. His scarlet eyes were filled with shocking killing intent, he suddenly looked at Jian Wushuang and asked,

“What did you say?”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes, he said in a low voice, “Demon Master Chen Huo, since you can control your body, it seems that you still have your rationality. I’m telling you now if you still have the slightest intention of avenging the Amethyst Demon Sect, then stop. But if you don’t have the intention Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

of avenging the Amethyst Demon Sect, then you can continue to kill.”

Demon Master Chen Huo was already standing there. His killing intent was still soaring, but the scarlet in his eyes slowly faded away. His earth-shaking aura also slowly faded away.

Seeing this scene, Jian Wushuang also heaved a sigh of relief. “Has he finally stopped?”

Jian Wushuang was also very nervous. He did not know whether his words could make Demon Master Chen Huo stop. However, he could see that although Demon Master Chen Huo looked crazy, as a Principles Master of the six void realms, no matter how crazy he was…he should be able to maintain a

trace of rationality. Moreover, he valued the Amethyst Demon Sect so much, so his words should make Demon Master Chen Huo somewhat worried.

As expected, when Demon Master Chen Huo heard his words, although his killing intent did not weaken, he stopped killing for the time being.

“Boy, what do you mean by what you said just now?” Demon Master Chen Huo stared at Jian Wushuang with cold eyes.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath, then he said, “Demon Master Chen Huo, I’ve made myself clear. If you kill all of us here, I guarantee you’ll lose your only chance to avenge your Amethyst Demon Sect!”

“Huh?” Demon Master Chen Huo’s pupils constricted slightly. He did not speak but listened to Jian Wushuang’s story.

“Demon Master Chen Huo, you should have already noticed that I’m not an expert under the command of the Flame Saint Realm. I’m from the Temporal Temple!” Jian Wushuang said.

“Temporal Temple?” Demon Master Chen Huo’s memories of the Temporal Temple immediately appeared in his mind, but his expression remained calm. “The Temporal Temple is indeed an ancient overlord. Even when the Amethyst Demon Sect was at its peak, we didn’t dare to provoke it. However…now

that the Amethyst Demon Sect has been destroyed, I’m the only one left. I’m not afraid of your Temporal Temple. Even if I kill all of your people here, what can the Temporal Temple do to me?”

The Demon Master Chen Huo was not conceited, but he did indeed have the ability to do so.

One had to know that he was now a super expert of the six states of the void. In the Divine Beginning Realm, unless the three great Saint Realm Masters or those few rulers personally took action, no one could do anything to him.

Although the Temporal Temple had a deep foundation and was powerful, under the circumstance that the Temporal Temple Master did not personally take action, they probably could not do anything to the Demon Master Chen Huo. After all, the Demon Master Chen Huo was not only terrifyingly

powerful…the Amethyst Demon Sect had long been destroyed, so there was nothing that could restrain or restrict him.

As the saying went, a bare-footed person was not afraid of wearing shoes. It was true that the Demon Master did not care about the Temporal Temple at the moment.

“Demon Master, with your current strength, the Temporal Temple is indeed unable to do anything to you. However, you have lived from the Amethyst Demon Sect’s era until now. You should know the position of the Temporal Temple. The Temporal Temple and the flame holy region have always been on

opposite sides. They have even been fighting for a long time. Although this kind of fight will not affect the status of the Flame Saint Realm, it will often cause pain to the Flame Saint Realm.”

“Besides, the person standing in front of you has the same hatred with the Flame Saint Realm as you do. He will not rest until one of us is dead!” Jian Wushuang said.

“The person standing in front of me? Are you talking about yourself?” Demon Master Chen Huo looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes, it’s me.” Jian Wushuang smiled. “Not only do I have a hatred with the Flame Saint Realm, but I also have a hatred with the other two Saint Realms. The three Saint Realms have risked their lives to kill me more than once or twice. It can be said that they and I are absolutely dead. There is no turning

back.”

“Hmph, kid, why didn’t you look in the mirror before you lied? Who do you think you are? However, for a mere Immortal Saint, if you were to say that you have a feud with the three great Saint Realms, this old man would believe you. However, you actually said that the three great Saint Realms had risked

everything to kill you multiple times… Hehe, if the three great Saint Realms really risked everything to kill you, would you still be alive? Who do you think you are?” Demon Master Chen Huo sneered.

“Demon Master Chen Huo, I’m not lying to you. The feud between me and the three Saint Realms, and the three Saint Realms have risked their lives to kill me many times, is known by everyone in the Divine Beginning Realm. You can go out and ask anyone,” Jian Wushuang said seriously..
