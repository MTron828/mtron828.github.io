“In the millions of years since our creator founded the Lineage of Star, we have embraced numerous genius disciples, but we’ve never received anyone practicing Inverse Cultivation.” Lei Chao said.

“So you are the first one!”

“Now you have just passed the first round of the Inverse Cultivation Test. After passing the second and the third, you will definitely make extraordinary achievements.”

Lei Chao knew about Jian Wushuang’s potential.

After Jian Wushuang passed the Inverse Cultivation Test, he would become a top almighty in the Eternal Chaotic World, much more powerful than Lei Chao.

“Does anyone in the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries know that you are practicing for the Inverse Cultivation Test?” Lei Chao asked.

“No.”

“OK, that’s good.” Lei Chao smiled, which was a rare occurence.

“Keep it a secret from others.” Lei Chao said, “Let’s go to the Lineage of Star and I will report to our master about the Inverse Cultivation. He will make decisions.”

Jian Wushuang nodded.

So they set out.

They headed for the Lineage of Star as quickly as possible.

In order to save time on the journey from the East Royal Sanctuary to the Purple Moon Sanctuary, they were going to use a wormhole.

Wormholes were only owned by powerful sects and tribes in the East Royal Sanctuary. Many tribes couldn’t even afford it.

But it didn’t worry Lei Chao.

By wormhole they soon arrived at the Purple Moon Sanctuary.

The Purple Moon Sanctuary was different from the East Royal Sanctuary.

The East Royal Sanctuary owned as many as six pieces of land, each of which was home to countless talents.

The Purple Moon Sanctuary, however, only had four pieces of land. But each land was far vaster than those in the East Royal Sanctuary and the number of talents was higher. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Among the four pieces of land, one was called the Star Land.

The Star Land was home to the Lineage of Star.

Jian Wushuang was impressed when he heard about the Star Land.

Everything in the Star Land was named with “Star”, which showed the dominating power that the Lineage of Star had.

And indeed, the dominant group in the Star Land was the Lineage of Star.

“How powerful this lineage is!” Jian Wushuang was amazed.

“After all, the creator of the Lineage of Star was at the top amongst the almighty in the Eternal Chaotic World. The best of the best. Although King Luo Zhen is among the almighties, he is far less powerful than the creator of the Lineage of Star.”

“King of Venomous Worms added, “Moreover, it was King of Venomous Worms alone that united the Star Land. So you can imagine how powerful he is.”

Jian Wushuang felt stunned.

Soon he had arrived at the base of the Lineage of Star with Lei Chao.

It was a vast galaxy.

The galaxy was stunning and filled with numerous shining stars.

“We are in the base of the Lineage of Star?”

Jian Wushuang was amazed by the glamorous galaxy.

How powerful could the Lineage of Star be to occupy such a vast galaxy?

“I heard about this galaxy during the time I followed King Luo Zhen. The creator of the Lineage of Star discovered the galaxy when he travelled to the Eternal Chaotic World and transformed the galaxy and moved it to the Star Land. Now it’s said that the secret sect skills of the Lineage of Star are combined with the galaxy.” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Wonderful!” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

“Let’s go.” Lei Chao said.

Jian Wushuang followed Lei Chao and went into the vast galaxy.

As Jian Wushuang entered the galaxy, he felt the power explode.

He was surprised and he asked Lei Chao, “I can feel the unlimited strong Divine Power here! Can I absorb this power?”

Lei Chao said, “Of course. We are now in a Divine Power Sea unique to the galaxy. The Divine Power will never be depleted here and you could refill your power here anytime.”

“So amazing…” Jian Wushuang said.

“Its power is more than that.” Lei Chao pointed in one direction.

Jian Wushuang then looked in that direction.

In the galaxy, a three-meter-tall exotic beast near them seemed to be playing.

“What is that?”

“It is one of the exotic beasts born with power generated by the galaxy. We call them Meta Beasts. They are valuable.” Lei Chao explained.

“How valuable are they?”

As Jian Wushuang asked, a golden flash of light flew to the exotic beast quickly.

“That light is a cultivator, right?!” Jian Wushuang asked excitedly.

“Yes, a disciple from our Lineage of Star.” Lei Chao answered calmly.

The exotic beast who was playing saw the golden light and immediately fled rapidly.

It couldn’t escape from the cultivator with the golden light.

As that cultivator caught the beast and the golden light around her dissipated, Jian Wushuang saw clearly that she was a lady in a golden robe. The lady left, satisfied with her prey.

“A powerful cultivator!”

“I bet this cultivator is far more powerful than Chen Bin who I once fought with!”

“Is she from the Star Palace?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“No, she is just an ordinary disciple from the Lineage of Star.” Lei Chao answered calmly.

Jian Wushuang was shocked!
