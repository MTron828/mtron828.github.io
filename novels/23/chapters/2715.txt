30 years was a short time for most cultivators as the time would just fly by.

However, 30 years was a long time for Jian Wushuang’s lifetime.

After all, he had barely experienced 100 years since he was reborn.

30 years was enough for him to greatly improve himself, especially now that he had obtained the second Fengtian Scroll. He was much faster compared to his previous speed in understanding the Sword Principle and Laws.

He would achieve a higher level in his understanding of law or perception toward the Sword Principle after 30 years with such speedy understanding and would be much stronger compared to his current self. He was not afraid even if there was something wrong with what the Devilish Wind King had said.

“A secret realm... I have to visit the secret realm if what the Devilish Wind King said is true and Fo Yo really obtained his Fengtian Scroll from the secret realm,” mumbled Jian Wushuang. However, he soon returned to his secret chambers and started meditating in retreat again.

Time flew by.

In the blink of an eye, five years had passed.

The Sword Alliance had completely stabilized and became one of the first-rated forces publicly recognized by all forces in the Danyang Continent within those five years.

In the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang was still focused on understanding the laws and Sword Principle.

Suddenly...

[Jian Yi, come over to the Sacred Palace.] Palace Keeper Si Zhen sent a message to him.

Jian Wushuang immediately opened his eyes but a smile appeared on his face.

“It’s finally done?” Jian Wushuang knew the reason Palace Keeper Si Zhen asked for him. There was a huge possibility that his Royal Blood Gem had been dealt with.

A 230 catties of Royal Blood Gem was too expensive and it would have been difficult for even Yin Su’er from the Crimson Stone Fort to handle.

It naturally took more time.

Jian Wushuang immediately left his secret chamber and headed for the Sacred Palace.

Jian Wushuang met Palace Keeper Si Zhen once he arrived at the Sacred Palace.

Palace Keeper Si Zhen had a smile on his face when he saw Jian Wushuang before immediately taking an interspatial ring out. “This is what you previously mentioned, ten thousand pieces of Divine Elixir Pills and one hundred billion Primordial Stones. All of which are in this interspatial ring. Apart from that, the selling price was much higher than the items you asked for because your Royal Blood Gem is extremely valuable and the Fort Master sold it to someone who happened to need it, hence the Fort Master gave you another two thousand pieces of Divine Elixir Pills and twenty billion Primordial Stones.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes immediately lit up and took the interspatial ring to have a closer look.

There were indeed 12,000 Divine Elixir Pills and 120,000,000,000 Primordial Stones in the interspatial ring.

It was a huge amount of money—something any top force in the Danyang Continent would not ignore.

However, it was obvious the price Yin Su’er sold for was much more than those for her to be so generous.

“Palace Keeper Si Zhen, can you tell me who the Fort Master sold the Royal Blood Gem to?” Jian Wushuang asked curiously.

Palace Keeper Si Zhen said the other person happened to need the Royal Blood Gem and the Royal Blood Gem was the main ingredient to cultivate Holy Treasures. The person who purchased it must be at least an Undying Saint, right?

“This...” Palace Keeper Si Zhen was quiet for a short moment before he said with a smile. “It’s alright, there’s no need to hide matters from you. The Fort Master sold the Royal Blood Gem to Master Mo.”

“Master Mo? An Undying Saint?” Jian Wushuang continued to ask.

“He’s an extremely strong Undying Saint. Apart from that, Master Mo still has another extremely special identity—the first-ranked craftmaster in the Nine Realms of Golden Crow!!” Palace Keeper Si Zhen said with a hint of respect.

Jian Wushuang was startled when he heard that.

The first-ranked craftmaster in the Nine Realms of Golden Crow?

Although his Blood Mountain Sword was his Life Divine Weapon, it did not fully integrate with his Perfect Chaotic Creature’s blood essence so it had failed to completely unleash its power. Therefore, he had always wanted to search for a strong craftmaster to retemper with his Blood Mountain Sword and complete that step.

Unfortunately, the strongest craftmaster he met when he was in Wusha Wilderness—Master Kun—was just a fourth-grade craftmaster. He tried his best and successfully crafted the Golden Glass Armor. However, he was not qualified to retemper the Blood Mountain Sword.

Master Kun also mentioned back then that it was impossible to retemper the Blood Mountain Sword without a peak seventh-grade craftmaster.

However, how could it be easy to find a peak seventh-grade craftmaster?

“Palace Master Si Zhen, Master Mo’s craftsmanship level must be extremely high since he’s the first-ranked craftmaster in the Nine Realms of Golden Crow. However, I wonder what level of a craftmaster he is at right now?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I don’t know his exact level but I know there are only two other well-known craftmasters in the Nine Realms of Golden Crow apart from Master Mo. Those two have achieved the seventh-grade craftmaster level but are still very much behind when compared to Master Mo, hence Master Mo might be a peak seventh-grade craftmaster or an eighth-grade craftmaster,” said Palace Keeper Si Zhen.

“Peak seventh-grade and possibly an eighth-grade?” Jian Wushuang’s body shook as he felt a wave of happiness surging through his heart.

Undoubtedly, Master Mo was the craftmaster he was searching for to retemper his Blood Mountain Sword.

However, a happy surprise was just a happy surprise. He knew that he was still very weak and unqualified to meet Master Mo.

Even if he successfully found Master Mo, Master Mo would not even glance at him—a young man who was not even a Grand Ultimate God.

Even Yin Su’er—the Crimson Stone Fort Master—also needed to do something special if she wanted to meet Master Mo. In addition, it also depended on whether Master Mo was in the mood and had the time to meet her.

‘There’s no rush as it’s nice to know about the existence of Master Mo at this junction. It’s not too late to ask for a meeting with Master Mo when my strength has grown and power increased,’ thought Jian Wushuang to himself.

Jian Wushuang did not linger and returned to the Sword Alliance after he received the interspatial ring from Palace Keeper Si Zhen.

He then sent a large number of Primordial Stones to Xiao Tiexin, the Sword Alliance’s Chief Steward.

The speedy development of the Sword Alliance was purely due to the huge amount of resources they poured into the alliance. Most of those resources originated from the 10,000,000,000 Primordial Stones Jian Wushuang previously received from Palace Keeper Si Zhen. However, those 10,000,000,000 Primordial Stones were almost gone at that time with the gradual formation of the Divine Sword Army.

However, he still had 120,000,000,000 Primordial Stones with him at the moment. The Divine Sword Army could continue expanding since he still had so many resources.

As for Jian Wushuang, he continued his retreat and started refining those Divine Elixir Pills.

He obtained 12,000 Divine Elixir Pills from Palace Keeper Si Zhen and when adding together with the 4,000 pills he obtained from Fo Yi, he had a total of 16,000 pills at that moment.

“I might be able to make a breakthrough in my realm by the time the secret realm opens since I have so many Divine Elixir Pills with me...” Jian Wushuang mumbled as he closed his eyes and started training.
