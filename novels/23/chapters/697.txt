Chapter 698: Concealment

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“That was fast.”

Gong Chao’s complexion had turned completely grim when the next moment, a Yin-Yang Power rose from his body.

His Yin-Yang Dao and Thunderbolt Dao burst out completely.

His cudgel then made successive swings, of which some were lightning fast and extremely powerful, while some were gentle and weak. The two Daos combined and were exerted in perfection.

Gong Chao’s staff technique was extraordinarily exquisite.

Although his understanding of Dao was certainly not the best, the power he was able to showcase when he fully exerted his Daos was definitely a lot greater than that of many advanced Divine Realm experts.

But what about Jian Wushuang?

He instead put on a perfect display of his swordsmanship.

It was a whole lot more exquisite than Gong Chaos staff technique. Although he did not exert as much strength as the latter, he could count on his swordsmanship to perfectly withstand the staff technique which combined Yin and Yang. On occasion, his offensive strokes would even cause Gong Chao great discomfort.

One glance was all it took to see that Jian Wushuang held the upper hand, even if it was but a small advantage.

And this was only because he was deliberately holding back the greater part of his strength.

Up till this point, he had only summoned up half of the Sword Heart’s power, and had not drawn on the Emperor Sword at all.

“There’re many people around, and among them are quite a few who harbor malintent toward me. My coming journey in the Eternal Zone will be very dangerous, such that death is a real possibility. Every bit of my strength that I’m able to conceal may prove decisive.”?

Although Jian Wushuang appeared to be sparing no efforts in his duel with Gong Chao, he was actually being extremely discreet.

In his heart, he was utterly clear about the matter.

Many of the experts from these sects were likely to be targeting him. It would be as good as courting death to reveal all of his trump cards during this fight.

Therefore, he concealed as much as he could of his strength. Of course, he could not be too discreet, or otherwise, suspicions might arise.

After all, news that he completed Earth-level Tasks in the Divine Palace had long spread, proving that he definitely possessed strength on the level of the advanced Divine Realm. He therefore displayed skill on the level of said Realm, and only gained a slight advantage in the duel because his swordsmanship was somewhat superior to his opponent’s staff technique.

Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!

A series of violent roars sounded. As if backed into a corner, Gong Chao found an opportunity to step back and began to summon his trump card move.

“Jian Wushuang, watch out.”

The Stone Cudgel in his hands struck out at the very instant that he spoke.

The air was completely suppressed in an instant, as a massive stream of overlapping cudgel shadows surged directly toward Jian Wushuang.

In terms of power, this had clearly reached the threshold of a Rank Four Secret Skill.

“Violet Calamity Sword Skill.”

Jian Wushuang too began to exert his trump card move.

A bright purple light began to shine. What captured everyone’s attention as soon as it was displayed was a sword move of absolute beauty and world-destroying power.

It was obvious that Jian Wushuang’s Violet Calamity Sword Skill was the much stronger Secret Skill. After all, his cultivation of Sword Principle was so high that this sword skill had already attained the level of a top Level Four Secret Skill. However, the contact force of 50 percent of his Sword Heart’s power was considerably less than that exerted by Gong Chao.

The two skills collided head-on, causing both Jian Wushuang and Gong Chao to be knocked back.

They turned out to be an even match.

After this collision, Jian Wushuang and Gong Chao stopped fighting and showed no intention to continue.

“I’ve lost this fight,” Gong Chao said in a rather deep voice.

“It was a draw. I didn’t beat you.” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“You’re after all just a Skyscraping Realm expert, whereas I’ve already attained the Divine Realm.”

Shaking his head, Gong Chao took a solemn glance at Jian Wushuang, then calmly opened his mouth to say two words.

He did not vocalize these two words and instead simply mouthed them. He even concealed his mouth movement so well that none of the spectating experts and disciples noticed.

“Jian Wushuang, I look forward to my next fight with you. I’ll make sure it’s an exciting one,” Gong Chao said and swiftly went back among Cloud Sea Asgard’s contingent.

Jian Wushuang simply smiled faintly, then turned to head back toward Ancient Sect’s contingent.

However, his vision became abnormally sharp after he turned his body.

Although nobody else had noticed the mouth movement that Gong Chao had made expressionlessly, Jian Wushuang saw it clearly as he was standing directly in front.

He could clearly decipher what these two words were… “Watch out!”

Gong Chao wanted him to be careful and even had to warn him in such an obscure manner.?Jian Wushuang certainly understood what this implied.

His prior suspicions were now confirmed.

The three elite Divine Realm experts sent by Cloud Sea Asgard, namely Wu Dao, Dao Mei, and Xue Guzi, had indeed come for him.

“Hehe, these three Divine Realm experts sure think highly of me. Was my improvement in the Ancient Sect really that amazing? Why else would these top sects think so highly of me, such that even the illustrious Cloud Sea Asgard would be this afraid?” Jian Wushuang furrowed his brows tightly.

He did not know why.

The truth was that the top sects and the three magnates did not think this highly of him solely because of his improvement in the Ancient Sect over the past few years.

The most important reason was his current status.

No sect could afford to not take seriously someone who was the personal disciple of Palace Master Xuanyi. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The experts and disciples of Cloud Sea Asgard were all looking at Jian Wushuang at this very moment.

Among those disciples, the trio of Wu Dao, Dao Mei, and Xue Guzi, whose auras were the most brutal, carried a hint of scorching heat in their eyes.

“This little fella is our target?” There was a devilish smile at the corner of Dao Meis mouth.

“After watching his fight with our junior Gong Chao, I would rate his strength as merely so-so. Only his swordsmanship is any above average,” Wu Dao remarked dismissively.

“It’s highly impressive for a Skyscraping Realm expert to possess this level of battle strength and swordsmanship already. However, while he may be able to put up a fight against an elite Divine Realm expert, he will be completely defenseless against us.” Xue Guzi’s expression was one of indifference.

“Hmph, judging from that level of strength, I’ll finish him off in one stroke.” Wu Dao sneered.

“Don’t get careless.” Dao Mei darted a look at Wu Dao and reminded in a low voice, “Don’t forget Great Elder’s instructions.”

Wu Dao’s face sank upon hearing this. At the same time, he began to recall what the Great Elder of Cloud Sea Asgard, Yun Fan, had instructed them to do before they set off.

“Listen, you three. This time, your target isn’t those Demon Gods, but Jian Wushuang instead!”

“Do whatever it takes to kill him, but remember, do not let the Ancient Sect get something on us.”
