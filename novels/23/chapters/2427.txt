Chapter 2428: News Spreading

“Senior Brother Zishan is right, I have lots of opportunities to kill him. I’ll let the kid live for a few more days since that’s the case,” Pang Tao told himself.

However, what he did not know was that Jian Wushuang looked at him with a touch of ridicule.

In Pang Tao’s mind, Jian Wushuang had managed to live because of Long Zishan’s arrival.

On the contrary, the person Long Zishan had rescued was actually in fact Pang Tao himself.

During that split second, Jian Wushuang had the intention to kill Pang Tao. If Long Zishan had not arrived in time, Pang Tao would have turned into a corpse. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

However, neither Pang Tao, Long Zishan, nor anyone around knew that.

At the surface, Long Zishan was still scolding Pang Tao. “Junior Brother, you’re really too reckless this time. Prepare for your punishment when you go back.”

“Understood.” Pang Tao nodded without any feeling of dissatisfaction.

“Come with me,” said Long Zishan, who led Pang Tao and the rest of his group to leave this place.

All the disciples from Narcissus Island gave a huge sigh of relief after watching Long Zishan, Pang Tao, and the rest left this place.

“They’re finally gone.” Zhong Yi and Su Tong both felt a burden unloaded.

Pang Tao alone had already given them an immense amount of pressure. They could not imagine how terrorizing it would be if Long Zishan joined in the mix.

“Little Brother, are you alright?” Zhuo Bing went up to Jian Wushuang.

“I’m fine, but I feel bad getting Senior Brother Ling Dan involved.” Jian Wushuang looked at Ling Dan.

Ling Dan was the first one who tried stopping Pang Tao but got injured instead. His face was still pale.

“I’ll live, it’s more important that Junior Brother Wushuang is alright.” Ling Dan smiled after noticing Jian Wushuang was looking at him.

Jian Wushuang was Zhuo Bing’s younger brother, therefore he wanted to do his best to protect Jian Wushuang in front of Zhuo Bing.

Unfortunately, his ability was not up to par.

“Luckily, not all disciples from the Great Compassion Sect are bullies. At least this Long Zishan is reasonable and knows his place,” said Zhuo Bing.

“Reasonable? Know his place? He’s just smarter, that’s all.” Jian Wushuang could not help but laughed.

It was true. Even though they were both core disciples of the Great Compassion Sect, and one of the Twelve Minor Kings, Long Zishan was a lot smarter than Pang Tao.

At the very least, in terms of his behavior and mannerisms, Long Zishan had a good reputation on the surface. However, who knew what kind of person was he in the dark?

“Junior Brother Wushuang.”

All the disciples from Narcissus Island walked up to him.

Zhong Yi and Su Tong both looked at Jian Wushuang with mixed emotions. “Junior Brother Wushuang, was what Pang Tao just said true?”

The rest of the disciples also looked at Jian Wushuang, waiting for an answer.

Although they believed a big part of it, they still felt it was hard to believe, hence they needed to hear it from Jian Wushuang himself.

Looking at everyone’s answer-seeking eyes, Jian Wushuang laughed. “That was a very long time ago, it’s no big deal.”

Jian Wushuang sounded extremely calm, but the fact he had admitted it remained.

At that point, all of them—Zhong Yi, Su Tong, and all the Narcissus Island disciples on-site—gasped, feeling even more stunned.

They finally understood why Elder Wujian would defend Jian Wushuang with all his might and send him into Saint’s Tomb.

It turned out that it was not due to any special relationship between them, but because Elder Wujian knew of Jian Wushuang’s background as a rarely seen Superior Demon.

A Superior Demon such as him should deserve to get the highest level of nurturing.

Zhong Yi took a deep breath and continued asking, “Junior Brother Wushuang, there’s something that I don’t quite understand. When Bai Yue and Elder Wujian invited you at the same time, why did you reject the Great Compassion Sect—to become the personal disciple of Fan Jianxian—instead, you chose to become a regular outer disciple on Narcissus Island?”

The rest of them also had the same question.

People tend to move up to higher places. Anybody would wish to join sects that were stronger to get more resources and have more improvement space.

Perhaps it was understandable that Jian Wushuang refused to join the Great Compassion Sect out of dislike for them. However, what was incomprehensible was that he happily became an outer disciple when he could have easily become a Narcissus Island core disciple or even the Lord’s personal disciple.

Jian Wushuang laughed and said, “The reason is simple. I just didn’t want too many constraints.”

“That’s it?” Everyone was surprised.

“That is it.” Jian Wushuang nodded again.

The core disciples from Narcissus Island speechlessly looked at each other and shrugged in the end.

All of them could only assume that a Superior Demon like Jian Wushuang’s thought process was different from theirs.

“Little Brother, at this moment, the genius disciples in the entire Saint’s Tomb have already known about you inheriting the relics left behind by Purple Blood Saint. There are bound to be people with inconceivable ideas. You need to be careful from now on, especially that Pang Tao, I’ve got a feeling he won’t just stop here,” said Zhuo Bing solemnly.

“Yes, I understand. I’ll be careful,” said Jian Wushuang.

The field very soon became quiet.

The many various sects disciples who came to watch had also left.

The news spread like wildfire as well upon their departure.

It did not take long before every sect’s genius disciples in Saint’s Tomb knew that Jian Wushuang had the items left behind by Purple Blood Saint.

At the same time, the story of Jian Wushuang’s terrifying talents had also spread to every corner of Saint’s Tomb.

All of a sudden, there was a huge quake among the people in Saint’s Tomb.

It could not be helped because Jian Wushuang’s battle records were too incredible. There was nobody who was unmoved by that story when they heard it.

His name began to spread among the sects for the very first time as Jian Wushuang, an ultimate demon who lived among people.

...

In a hidden room within Saint’s Tomb...

Crimson Stone Saint’s remnant consciousness had always been there, and that consciousness was extended into every corner of the tomb. Anything that happened within could not escape his knowledge.

Naturally, he had noticed when Pang Tao and his gang were picking a fight with Jian Wushuang.

The person he was interested in was not Pang Tao but Jian Wushuang instead.

Anyways, he had always been interested in Jian Wushuang.

Crimson Stone Saint had also heard everything Pang Tao said—the various information about Jian Wushuang.

“Profound Achievement in sword principles at 16 years old!”

“Killed Third-Class Divine Demon with the level of Chaotic Realm, and overpowered two Second-Class Divine Demon head-to-head at 19 years old!”

“Achieved completion in sword principles as a Peak Stage Chaotic Realm, passed the eighth trial bridge’s challenges and obtained the relics left behind by Purple Blood Saint this year at 21 years old... Haha, this little boy called Jian Wushuang really is not just talented, huh?”
