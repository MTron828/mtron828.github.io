Chapter 1844: Changes In Ranking

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In Sanctuary Alliance, there was a hubbub.

Countless experts had heard that Deluge Fortress was destroyed and the thirteen Almighties, including Fortress Master Hong Tian were killed. They were extremely shocked and they couldn’t believe it.

One should know that there was a powerful formation of thirteen Almighties.

Especially as there was a Peak Emperor God, like Fortress Master Hong Tian.

Previously, Jian Wushuang had said in front of many experts on Thunderbolt Island that he would go to Deluge Fortress in ten years. Many sneered at his speech and thought Jian Wushuang was arrogant.

Under the condition where the Master of Star Palace was restrained and unable to attack, they didn’t think Lineage of Star would be able to destroy the team formation of thirteen Almighties.

Some were even prepared to make fun of Lineage of Star.

But in the end… it had yet to be ten years.

Merely a year later, Jian Wushuang had barged into Deluge Fortress and killed all thirteen Almighties, as he had said he would.

Even Peak Emperor God, Fortress Master Hong Tian, was killed on the spot!!

It was simply unbelievable.

“Fortress Master Hong Tian, Peak Emperor God, a super expert. How did Jian Wushuang kill him?”

“I heard that Jian Wushuang invited Emperor God Liu Guang and Emperor God Jiu Yin to join him. The three of them joined forces and cornered Fortress Master Hong Tian into?a desperate situation. Fortress Master Hong Tian couldn’t run at all. He had no choice but could only burn his soul and counterattack before death. In the end, he died.”

“After that fight, Jian Wushuang’s bad name has reached another level. There should be some drastic changes on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, right?

Countless experts were chatting among themselves.

The fight where Jian Wushuang had charged to Deluge Fortress had caused a huge scene.

In the surroundings of Deluge Fortress, there were naturally experts who were watching from afar. They were even some who had recorded things with a Mirroring Token.

The mirror image of the fight was spreading to the public.

Jian Wushuang’s performance was too outstanding in the fight!

In a short period of time, he had killed Emperor God Bing Can with thunderous measures. Then, he had wiped out all Sir Gods. Then, he had joined Emperor God Liu Guang and Emperor God Jiu Yin to corner Fortress Master Hong Tian to his extreme limit.

Every scene had astonished the crowd.

Especially the three Hong Jung Golden Swords that Jian Wushuang had used struck fear into many Emperor Gods.

“Too powerful. The golden swords that Jian Wushuang controls, every sword’s attack was like a hit by Peak Emperor God. It was unbelievably fast too. I reckon one could easily suppress an ordinary Sir God, but he could control three at once? The three continuous hits could totally suppress a Peak Emperor Sir God!”

“Jian Wushuang is much stronger than we had imagined. In terms of power, he was definitely above Fortress Master Hong Tian. Compared to the Master of Star Palace, he isn’t too far behind too. The scariest part about him was his hunting power. Three golden swords, Secret Skill of Ancient God, Moon Picking Skill, and also the mysterious pearl that becomes formation via his will. Once his opponent’s power is below him, his opponent won’t be able to escape.”

“His hunting power is too strong. No wonder Fortress Master Hong Tian, who is a Peak Emperor God, couldn’t escape.”

Many people were sighing.

They were admiring Jian Wushuang’s power.

Of course, there was something that Jian Wushuang had displayed in the fight that had astonished many of them. It was his defense power.

When Fortress Master Hong Tian was forced to his extreme limit, he had burned his soul and wanted to counterattack before his death. The axe that he had swung hit Jian Wushuang’s body directly. In the end, Jian Wushuang had merely grown slightly paler.

That amazed many of them.

“The defense power is too strong!”

“The crimson armor that he was wearing is definitely a very powerful Chaotic Divine Treasure. His divine body was shockingly strong too. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to withstand the hit so casually.

“His close combat skill is already so ferocious and his defense power is so terrifying. Jian Wushuang…”

Everyone complimented.

But what they didn’t know was that Jian Wushuang’s current defense power wasn’t at its peak yet.

One should know that when he received the ancient tribe bloodline inheritance, Jian Wushuang had comprehended the first volume of the strongest secret skill of ancient tribe, Immemorial Celestial Body.

Immemorial Celestial Body could be in the top ten of countless defense secret skills, even in ancient times. It was definitely the best and the strongest defense secret skill.

Although Jian Wushuang had comprehended the first volume from the stone stele, comprehension and cultivation were two different matters, he had yet to cultivate it.

It was not that he didn’t want to cultivate, but he wasn’t qualified to.

Merely the first volume of Immemorial Celestial Body required at least for one to reach the level of Early Stage Chaotic Realm. In other words, the level of Sir God.

As Jian Wushuang was an inverse cultivator, his divine power and divine body could be compared to an Emperor God favorably. However, in terms of realm, he was truly just a Real God.

Hence, even though he had comprehended the secret skill, Jian Wushuang had yet to cultivate it.

Someday in the future when he received the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill and breakthrough to reach Chaotic Realm, he could cultivate the first volume of Immemorial Celestial Body. In collaboration with Five Gem Armor, his defense power would really be terrifying then. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Just as the forces and experts in Sanctuary Alliance were astonished by the news about Deluge Fortress’s crush and Fortress Master Hong Tian’s death.

There were some changes in Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, as they had expected.

And it was a drastic change.

After all, ever since Jian Wushuang had started exterminating experts who harbored great resentment against Lineage of Star, in ten years time, there had been four Emperor Gods who died in his hands. The Emperor Gods were all listed on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

With four Emperor Gods’ deaths, there was, of course, a drastic change on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. However, many experts in Eternal Chaotic World only paid close attention at Jian Wushuang’s ranking.

Everyone would want to know which rank Jian Wushuang, who had massacred for over ten years and carried such a bad name, would be on the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

There were many who started guessing before the ranking changed.

In the top of Sanctuary Mountain on Thunderbolt Island, there was an exquisite pavilion. There were two Sir Gods who sat together and played chess as they chatted casually. The main topic of their conversation was Jian Wushuang.

“Judging from the mirror image of him killing Emperor God Bing Can, his fighting power should be extremely strong among Peak Emperor Gods. He is at least stronger than Fortress Master Hong Tian so his ranking is definitely higher than Fortress Master Hong Tian. I reckon he would be the thirty-second or thirty-third. Of course, if he were to be lucky, he might even be in the top thirties!”

“Top thirty? Wouldn’t that be higher than the Master of Star Palace? You don’t think he would go that far up, right?”

“Who knows? We shall see. The Great Emperors who are the higher-ups of Sanctuary Alliance are more knowledgeable and experienced than us. They could definitely estimate Jian Wushuang’s actual power from the fight. There shouldn’t be any issue with the ranking list.”

Very soon, the ranking list was announced.

Jian Wushuang (Sword Emperor), Real God inverse cultivator, thirtieth rank!
