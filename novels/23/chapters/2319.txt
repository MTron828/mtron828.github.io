2320 Water Fairy Island

A Pure Sun Realm had killed four Chaotic Realms in a single strike?

Was this possible?

Who would believe it if someone told others?

However, that had really happened before his eyes.

Moreover, the Chaotic Realm quarter wasn’t just at the Early Stage Chaotic Realm. Two of them were at the Middle Stage Chaotic Realm.

As for Jian Wushuang, he was just at the Middle Stage Pure Sun Realm and not even the Peak Pure Sun Realm!

The difference in realms was so huge and yet he could swiftly kill them?

Lin Yi and that red-haired old lady couldn’t believe their eyes.

However, Jian Wushuang was able to do it so easily and casually. After he killed the Chaotic Realm quartet, he was still casual and composed.

For him, killing four Chaotic Realms was indeed nothing.

When he was in the Eternal Chaotic World and before he had completed his Perfect Chaotic Lifeform, he had been able to rely on the uniqueness of being an Inverse Cultivator to challenge and even kill Chaotic Realm as an Eternal Real God.

And now that he had been reincarnated into a Perfect Chaotic Lifeform, he was even more frightening than an Inverse Cultivator. Moreover, his understanding of the Rules of Order, Sword Principle and many other aspects were way beyond the ordinary Chaotic Realm. As such, killing an ordinary Chaotic Realm was just like a walk in the park.

Even if he were to face a true Peak Chaotic Realm, he would stand a good chance.

In the air, Lin Yi and the red-haired old lady had stopped. Both of their gazes were fixed on Jian Wushuang.

“Haha! Jian Wushuang! I finally understood why the Zhuge Family would pay such a high price to kill you. At such a young age, your understanding of swords is already so deep. You are even able to easily kill Chaotic Realms when you are just a Pure Sun Realm. If such a demon-like talent like you were given time to grow, the entire Anjiu Prefecture or even the entire Wusha Barren Region would be trampled under your feet. In fact, you could even go beyond the Wusha Barren Region to a more glamorous region.”

“For you, reaching Divine Demon was a given. As for going beyond Divine Demon and becoming an Undying Saint, you probably have a high chance as well.”

“It is not surprising why the Zhuge Family would feel uneasy about having such a talent standing against them.” The red-haired old lady laughed coldly while staring fervently at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was indifferent and didn’t take in a single word from the red-haired old lady.

As for Lin Yi, he was awestruck.

Previously, he had known that Jian Wushuang had extremely high talents and great potential.

Now, he felt he had only seen the tip of the iceberg.

The potential that Jian Wushuang had displayed was even greater than any talent he was aware of.

Just like the red-haired old lady had said, becoming a Divine Demon was a given for Jian Wushuang. He also had a high chance of becoming a superpower existence of Undying Saint, the level beyond Divine Demon.

Looking across boundless Absolute Beginning Divine Worlds, an Undying Saint would be considered a top-notch expert.

“Jian Wushuang, I’m here this time because of Zhuge Family’s invitation to kill you. However, after seeing your talents, I have changed my mind.” The red-haired old lady stared at Jian Wushuang and said, “Truth be told, my name is Yan Que and I’m from the Water Fairy Island.”

“Water Fairy Island?” Lin Yi was astonished.

Jian Wushuang also lifted his head to glance at the red-haired old lady.

Jian Wushuang knew about the Water Fairy Island.

Although large families were the most common in the Wusha Barren Region, ancient sects were numerous as well.

Moreover, these sects were extremely powerful and controlled large areas in the Wusha Barren Region.

Misty Rain Sword Pavilion, which Zhuo Yunfeng wanted Jian Wushuang to join, and Dongzuo Sect, which Zhuge Hong was in, were both rather strong sects.

However, they were miles apart from Water Fairy Island.

Water Fairy Island was definitely one of the most elite sects in the Wusha Barren Region. In fact, they would be ranked in the top ten among the numerous sects of Wusha Barren Region.

It was said that there was more than two hundred Chaotic Divine Demon in Water Fairy Island. As for experts beyond that level, they were more than a few of them as well.

A powerful sect like this was definitely feared by various families in the Wusha Barren Region.

“I have heard of Water Fairy Island but what does it have to do with me?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were still as cold as ever.

“Hehe! I told you about my background because I wouldn’t want such an absolute talent to be killed here. Therefore, I would like to give you an opportunity. If you are willing, follow me back to Water Fairy Island and I’ll personally refer you. With your talents and potential together with my referral, it will be more than sufficient to get you a slot as a core disciple of Water Fairy Island. If you are lucky, our Island Master, or even those Elders that are above the Chaotic Divine Demon level might want to take you as their disciples,” said Yan Que.

She had indeed come to kill Jian Wushuang.

She had also taken the benefits from the Zhuge Family.

However, the potential that Jian Wushuang had displayed had aroused her interests.

It wasn’t that she was appreciative of talents but because she knew clearly if she could refer a talent like Jian Wushuang into Water Fairy Island, the experts in Water Fairy Island would definitely reward her handsomely. These rewards would be way more than what Zhuge Family had promised her.

“You wanted to kill me moments ago and now you want me to join the Water Fairy Island? Heh! You definitely changed quickly. However, the meagre Water Fairy Island isn’t qualified for me to join.” Jian Wushuang was cold and didn’t hesitate for a moment.

“Jian Wushuang, you have to think this through. Even if it wasn’t for your future, you would have to consider your current predicament. Following me back to Water Fairy Island will be your only chance of survival. Otherwise...” Yan Que squinted her eyes.

“Otherwise? Truth be told, I’m really not interested in your Water Fairy Island. As for you, a meagre Half Step Divine Demon is nothing before me. I don’t feel that my current situation is perilous. On the other hand, you should think about how you are going to get out,” Jian Wushuang said coldly. “The Chaotic Realm quartet from the Zhuge Family has died. It will be your turn next!”

“Arrogant!” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Yan Que was infuriated. “Jian Wushuang, you only killed some Chaotic Realm trash. Do you really think that’s incredible? Forget it. I’ve allowed you to live and yet you reject me. Don’t blame it on me.”

A stifling killing intent emanated from Yan Que.

She was finally going to use her full strength.
