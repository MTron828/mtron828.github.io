Chapter 721: The Strength of the Ancient God Clan

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“The Ancient God Clan is quite powerful!” Jian Wushuang was greatly shocked in the heart.

Given the overall strength of the Ancient God Clan, it wasn’t an exaggeration to say they surpassed the entire Firmament Territory. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, because of certain reasons, the Ancient God clansmen could not leave the Eternal Zone, so they had little contact with the outside world. It was only during those ten days when the outsiders came down every hundred years that they would have any contact with experts and disciples from the Firmament Territory.

The Ancient God Clan took advantage of this to hone some of the clansmen’s abilities through contact with the outsiders.

But they would only send the One-star Ancient Gods who had just awakened to the outer layer to fight with those Divine Realm disciples.

As for the One-star Ancient Gods who had previously awakened and possessed great strength, they never took part in the fights.

If it was not for the purpose of honing the clansmen’s abilities, the Firmament Territory experts and disciples who had broken into the Eternal Zone wouldn’t even be able to struggle against the Ancient God Clan.

“Kid, take your time and rest up. If you need something, you can look for Gu Yang,” said Elder Ying before leaving.

Jian Wushuang thanked her again. After seeing Elder Ying leave the stone house, he heaved a long sigh of relief.

“The ten-day deadline is already up, so it’s very likely that the entrance to the Eternal Zone has completely closed.”?Jian Wushuang murmured as he felt a bit bitter.

He was being chased, so he had no choice but to escape to the inner layer of the Eternal Zone.

As a result, he was saved, but he missed the opportunity to return to the Firmament Territory.

Once the ten-day deadline passed, the Eternal Zone would be sealed again. As for when it would reopen, it would be one hundred years from now.

According to what Elder Ying had just said, the clansmen of the Ancient God Clan had no way to leave the Eternal Zone.

In other words, he couldn’t leave any time soon. If he wanted to leave, he would have to wait for one hundred years…

“One hundred years?”?Jian Wushuang couldn’t help shaking his head as he smiled bitterly.

However, he did not think much about it. After all, he was already here, so he could only act accordingly.

“According to Elder Ying, the purity of soul aura determines the concentration of the Ancient God bloodline. My soul aura is very pure and my Ancient God bloodline is very thick, so I can at least become a Silver-armored Ancient God.”?Jian Wushuang mused as he drummed his fingers on the stone bed.

He still didn’t know if his soul aura had changed or if he really possessed the bloodline of the Ancient God Clan.

He was also not sure that he could successfully awaken the bloodline and become an Ancient God after entering the Baptismal Pool, but it was obvious that he still wanted to try.

“I have to try. As long as I can awaken the Ancient God bloodline and become an Ancient God, even if it is just the lowest copper-armored Ancient God, it is enough to enhance my strength.”?Jian Wushuang thought privately.

However, the fly in the ointment was that once his bloodline was really awakened and he became a One-star Ancient God, his own realm would have a breakthrough from the Skyscraping Realm to the Divine Realm.

A breakthrough was a good thing, but Jian Wushuang… did not want to break through so early because the Skyscraping Realm was the best stage for increasing his comprehension.

Once he broke through and reached the Divine Realm, he might gain other abilities, but his speed of comprehension would definitely be greatly weakened.

“I don’t need to hurry to do that. Since I’m forced to stay in the Ancient God Clan for one hundred years, I’ll have lots of opportunities to enter this Baptismal Pool. Before that, I can continue cultivating and wait to have the baptism in a dozen years or even at the 99th year,” Jian Wushuang thought.

While sitting cross-legged on the bed, Jian Wushuang swallowed some elixirs and began to recover his Spiritual Power.

His Spiritual Power was still exhausted at present.

After half a day, 30% of the Spiritual Power inside Jian Wushuang’s body had barely recovered.

After sensing that his strength was slowly recovering, Jian Wushuang was slightly relieved, but there was a sharp light in the depths of his eyes that would make people tremble.

“Cloud Sea Asgard, Immortal Dynasty, Boundless Demon Sect!” He clenched his hands.

This trip to the Eternal Zone could be said to be the closest to death he had ever been. Thankfully he was calm and decisive, which barely saved his life.

In addition, he was forced to stay in the Eternal Zone and he couldn’t leave for the next hundred years.

But the worst part was that Gu Qiong died because of him.

All of this was caused by the three magnates.

“I have never provoked the three magnates, but they have spared no effort to kill me!”

“Very well, you wait and see.”?Killing intent exploded in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

He always drew a clear distinction between kindness and hatred. He wouldn’t attack others unless others attacked him!

Since the three magnates had provoked him, he would not be kind to them.

Of course, he was trapped in the Eternal Zone and couldn’t leave for now, so he wasn’t a threat to them for the time being, but the situation would be different in a hundred years.

Time flew by and three days had passed since Jian Wushuang was brought to the Eighth Tribe.

After three days, Jian Wushuang’s Spiritual Power had been completely restored. He even managed to create another Slaughter Body since the previous one was killed by An Chao.

As long as his two Original Bodies weren’t both killed, the one which was killed could be recreated by the other.

Jian Wushuang’s state had returned to the Peak once again.

While sitting cross-legged on the bed, Jian Wushuang was whole-heartedly meditating on Dao when there was a loud noise from outside. Jian Wushuang’s face changed slightly and he opened his eyes, then he walked out of the house.

Immediately after walking outside, while standing in front of the door, he saw lots of clansmen gathered together in a vast open place and two young men fight intensely at the center.

Jian Wushuang knew one of the young men. He was Gu Lan, the son of the Silver-armored Ancient God, Gu Yang, who carried Jian Wushuang back to the tribe. Gu Lan had not reached adulthood yet and still hadn’t had his baptism to awaken his Ancient God bloodline.

The other young man who fought with him also hadn’t awakened his bloodline.

While watching the fierce fight between the two men, Jian Wushuang walked toward the crowd.

The fierce fight was quickly over and the winner was Gu Lan.

“Ha ha, who is not convinced? Feel free to come forward and fight with me.”

Gu Lan had an antagonistic expression as he looked around and his loud hearty laughter sounded throughout the open space.

There were quite a few clansmen who also hadn’t awakened their bloodline around him, but these people just looked at one another without the intention of fighting.

Among the clansmen who hadn’t awakened their bloodline and become real Ancient Gods, Gu Lan was obviously the strongest.
