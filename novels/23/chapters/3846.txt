From the beginning to the end, Jian Wushuang appeared very casual and calm, feeling extremely confident.

In fact, Jian Wushuang was of course confident. Wu Tan Master was just a Principles Master. When Jian Wushuang was young, he had roamed the Divine Beginning Realm and had heard of Wu Tan Master, he knew that Wu Tan Master was a Principles Master under the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, and the latter was his good friend.

There was no need for him to send a message to the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master. He just needed to say hello to the three palace masters of the Heaven-cleaving Palace.

With his current strength and status, a simple word from him was enough to shake the Divine Beginning Realm. Even if he just casually said hello, the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance did not dare to be negligent, they immediately contacted Wu Tan Master as soon as possible.

As for what happened next…

!!

The True Saints from Wu Tan Palace were furious at Jian Wushuang. They did not believe what he said at all and thought that Jian Wushuang was just teasing them.

Not only them, but Hu Yang also thought so. He was worried for his teacher.

However, just as the purple-robed woman was about to take down Jian Wushuang, their master, Wu Tan Master, sent them a message.

“Palace Master, did you send a message?”

The purple-robed woman was slightly stunned. When she saw the message clearly, she was so scared that her face turned pale and her eyes showed an unprecedented fear.

Wu Tan Master’s message was like this.

“Idiots, what on Earth are you doing!?

“Immediately, apologize to the person in front of you and wipe away the anger of the other party at all costs!

“If the other party is even the slightest bit dissatisfied with you after this, the few of you, as well as the people close to you, including your teachers or good friends, wash your necks and wait to be slaughtered!”

Wu Tan Master was clearly furious.

There was even a deep sense of fear in his anger.

The purple-robed woman and the others could feel this kind of fear.

“How, how could this be?”

The purple-robed woman and the True Saints from Wu Tan Palace were trembling. From the Wu Tan Master’s words, they realized that the person in front of them was a true supreme existence, he was even stronger than their palace master, Wu Tan Master.

“Could he be a top Principles Master or a Ruler from the Divine Beginning Realm?” The purple-robed woman thought in fear.

As an elder of Wu Tan Palace, she knew more about Wu Tan Secret Realm than the others. She knew that she was only in a secret realm, and their palace master was only a Principles Master in the Divine Beginning Realm, there were many Principles Masters in the Divine Beginning Realm who were stronger than her palace master.

It was very likely that they had met one now.

Taking a deep breath, the purple-clothed woman immediately floated down.

In the Sword Mansion, everyone was waiting for the reaction of the purple-clothed woman and the others. When they saw the purple-clothed woman floating down, they thought that she was going to attack.

However, the purple-clothed woman came to Jian Wushuang, but she directly knelt down on one knee. “We didn’t know your identity and have offended you. You can punish us as you like, but please forgive us and let us live.”

The purple-clothed woman knelt there with her head very low. The other True Saints also knelt there obediently and did not dare to breathe loudly.

Silence!

The entire Sword Mansion fell silent.

The cold elder and the golden-robed young man felt an unprecedented chill fill their bodies and minds.

The dignified ninth elder of the Wu Tan Palace, one of the most powerful people in the Wu Tan Secret Realm, was actually kneeling before this sword gallery master and begging for his life?

“No, how is this possible?!” The cold elder’s eyes were wide open.

“Teacher.” Hu Yang also looked at Jian Wushuang in disbelief.

“Master!”

The disciples of the Sword Mansion were also shocked.

Jian Wushuang just smiled faintly and said, “I told you to let this matter go, and Wu Tan Palace will not pursue this disciple of mine anymore.”

“I don’t dare.” The purple-robed woman shook her head.

At this critical moment, she would not dare to say anything even if Hu Yang killed more than half of Wu Tan Palace’s core disciples, let alone one.

“Ok, you can leave. But when you leave, help me take these people with you. My Sword Mansion is too small to accommodate them.” Jian Wushuang pointed at the cold elder and the gold-robed young man, he smiled and said.

“Yes.”

The purple-clothed woman nodded respectfully. After getting up, she immediately used her skills to capture the cold elder and the golden-robed young man. Then, she left with the True Saints from Wu Tan Palace.

The Sword Mansion calmed down early in the morning when the purple-clothed woman and the others left.

“OK, everyone, go and practice your swordsmanship.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand and walked toward the backyard.

“Teacher.”

Hu Yang wanted to follow him, but he stopped halfway.

He wanted to know who his teacher was, what kind of amazing identity he had, and why even an elder of Wu Tan Palace had to kneel in front of him.

However, Jian Wushuang clearly did not intend to tell him.

The Sword Mansion calmed down again, but what had happened before was clearly seen by many disciples of the Sword Mansion. All of them were very excited and were guessing the identity and strength of their master. Not only that…the news spread quickly through the city through the disciples of the Sword Mansion.

However, it was only spread in the city and could not be spread to other places. Therefore, almost no one was willing to believe it.

These people who had lived in the Wu Tan secret realm since birth had long believed that the Wu Tan secret realm was heaven and earth, and that the Master of Wu Tan was the strongest creature. As for those who were comparable to or even stronger than the master of Wu Tan…they did not even dare to think about it.

Ten days later.

“Hu Yang.”

Jian Wushuang called Hu Yang over.

“Teacher.” Hu Yang was extremely respectful.

“In a while, someone will come to visit the Sword Mansion. Wait at the door. When he comes, bring him to me directly,” Jian Wushuang instructed.

“Yes.” Hu Yang nodded respectfully and immediately went to wait at the door of the Sword Mansion.

After a short while, someone indeed arrived at the entrance of the Sword School.

It was an old man dressed in black. He was thin and weak and had a goatee. The aura of this old man was very unique. At the very least, Hu Yang could not tell whether it was real or fake.

“May I ask if you are here to visit your teacher?” Hu Yang looked at the person who came.

“Yes, you are little friend Hu Yang, right?” The goatee-bearded old man said with a smile.
