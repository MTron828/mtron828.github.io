Chapter 2690: Enchanted

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Three continuous violent bombings reverberated in the void as three dragons’ howling could be heard accompanying the bombing.

The Seven Absolute Palace Master had only made one movement but three sword shadows could be seen appearing.

Those three sword shadows directly turned into three destruction dragons and roared ferociously as they attacked.

The destruction power those three dragons showed had caused even Jian Wushuang’s facial expression to change.

Jian Wushuang waved his sword without hesitation—unleashing his divine power and his maximum capacity of two Space-time Blades.

Boom!

A loud bang.

The strong killing power directly killed two destruction dragons while the remaining one was unaffected and directly knocked into Jian Wushuang’s divine body. Jian Wushuang was sent flying outward until he knocked onto the Golden Prison’s edge and landed on its wall. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Have I done it?” The Seven Absolute Palace Master stared at Jian Wushuang with a slight satisfaction in his eyes.

He could feel that his attack had directly landed on Jian Wushuang’s body.

This attack was extremely powerful and also his strongest. A true Peak Heaven Ultimate God would have been badly wounded after suffering such an impact head-on under normal circumstances. Those with slightly weaker physical protection abilities might even be destroyed by that attack.

As for Su Han...

Clank~ Jian Wushuang had already broken loose from the Golden Prison’s wall and reappeared in front of the Seven Absolute Palace Master.

“You’re really a Peak Heaven Ultimate God with some real powers.” Jian Wushuang glanced at the Seven Absolute Palace Master with a devilish smile on his face.

“You aren’t hurt? Nothing happened to you?” The Palace Master looked at Jian Wushuang and was horrified.

He had no idea that only a handful could manage to hurt Jian Wushuang with even fewer capable of killing him as Jian Wushuang was a Perfect Chaotic Creature.

He would be able to recover in an instant no matter how badly he was injured as long as he had sufficient divine power.

For example, the previous attack had really wounded him but he had recovered in an instant with his combat power still at his peak level.

“That attack just now should be your strongest attack?” Jian Wushuang stared at the Palace Master with a smile on his face. “You’ve shown your strongest attack and it’s my turn now.”

His aura had started to grow horrifyingly as Jian Wushuang spoke.

The Seven Stars Secret Technique had been activated.

His realm had directly risen from Peak Earth Ultimate God to Primary-level Heaven Ultimate God following the vast star power’s activation. His divine power then expanded from High-level Heaven Ultimate God to Peak Heaven Ultimate God under the disguise of the black stone.

His true strength had skyrocketed in an instant!

He then slowly rose his head and glanced at the Seven Absolute Palace Master with a weird smile on his face.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang made a move.

He appeared in front of the Seven Absolute Palace Master as though he had teleported.

He then made a wave with his Blood Mountain Sword.

This wave was poignant and heartbreakingly beautiful.

It also carried a hint of confusion which made people intoxicated.

Many experts in the surrounding void were involuntarily attracted by this sword-light when that attack was carried out and could not control themselves from being intoxicated by it once attracted.

It felt as though they were drunk after having several drinks. Although it was a slightly uncomfortable feeling, it was enjoyable.

A hint of confusion also flashed through Seven Absolute Palace Master’s eyes and brought him to the brink of intoxication. However, he still maintained a sense of understanding towards himself as he tried his best to swing the spear in his hand and block that heart-breakingly intoxicating sword attack.

He tried his best to block the attack.

However, he was terrified when he discovered his speed was much slower than his opponent who was waving the sword.

His speed was too slow and his speed difference with the sword attack was too far apart.

He could not block it in time.

In the end...

Swoosh!

As their figures met, the heartbreakingly beautiful sword-light had already swooshed through his body. Although the Seven Absolute Palace Master was also wearing Heavenly Treasure level defensive armor, it was not an extremely strong one and was unable to save his life. Cracks had appeared on the armor as the sword-light had broken his divine body into two from the middle.

The Seven Absolute Palace Master’s eyes turned lifeless as he failed to hold on to his life.

Jian Wushuang stood by the void next to the Seven Absolute Palace Master as he looked down upon his body.

“I’ve been understanding the laws and studying my Sword Principle intensively during the forty-year journey from the Northern Darkstar Territory to the Danyang Continent. I’ve been trying to innovate new techniques and because I have the Transmigration Sword Formation for Transmigration Law, I have paused on Transmigration Sword Techniques and focus all my energy on creating Space-time Sword Techniques.”

“After forty years, I’ve finally created the Space-time Sword Technique’s Seventh Form—Enchanted!”

“This form is much stronger than the other six forms of my Space-time Sword Technique that I’ve previously created,” mumbled Jian Wushuang.

The Seventh Form—Enchanted caused everybody to long for the enchantment.

That form was something he created out of his peak understanding of Space-time Law—a form that was sufficient to cause a huge effect on space-time.

That was the reason this form acted so quickly when he used it. It was so fast that even though Seven Absolute Palace Master was able to respond, he was unable to block it and was directly killed.

‘It would’ve been easy to kill this Seven Absolute Palace Master I really wanted.’ Jian Wushuang secretly smiled.

In truth, if he used his many methods...

Other matters aside, just the A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique had allowed him to easily sweep 99 percent of the Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods.

Jian Wushuang was not willing to use it again as the A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique was too overbearing and nature-defying. A technique he would instead treat as one of his last resort techniques.

He could not repeatedly use that last resort technique in front of the crowds or it would no longer be his last trump card. Just like one of his most powerful last resorts—Stately Painting—he would not easily use it unless necessary.

No matter what, the Seven Absolute Palace Master was already dead.

In the voids around them, the Seven Absolute Palace experts who were fighting with the Divine Sword Army naturally saw that scene.

“The Palace M-Master is dead?”

“I...Impossible!!”

“If the Palace Master is dead then aren’t we...”

The experts from the Seven Absolute Palace were horrified and frightened.

In contrast to that, the Divine Sword Army had risen morale.

“Haha...their Palace Master has been killed by us!”

“Kill all of them!”
