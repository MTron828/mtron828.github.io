Chapter 845: The Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the center of a long mountain range was the headquarters of a clan. Although the clan was weak, it had deep foundations.

At this moment, the mountains were almost in ruins, with a large number of pits in them. Numerous buildings had collapsed while countless corpses were spread everywhere. The ground was dyed with blood, which looked extremely dazzling in the dark.

Jian Wushuang was standing quietly in the void, wearing a scarlet cloak and with his hands behind his back.

Not long after, a blond elder came over and said respectfully, “Sir, as you ordered, the Luo Clan and its core disciples have been killed. From tonight, there is no Luo Clan in the Tang of the East.”

“Good.” Jian Wushuang stared at the gruesome scene without any compassion.

The Luo Clan was a supporter of a top clan of the Tang of the East. They had committed a lot of sinful crimes in private, so they were far from innocent. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Except for their ordinary clansmen of low status, the core disciples of the Luo Clan should indeed have been killed.

“The Luo Clan has been destroyed. I have spent three full years on this task, and it’s finally over.” Jian Wushuang sighed. “Now my points should meet the threshold for me to become a Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard, right?”

That night, Jian Wushuang sorted through his war spoils, and then returned to the Blood Eagle Guard lair that very night.

In the Eagle Hall, a few Blood Eagle Guards gathered in twos and threes.

“Did you hear? Blood Mountain actually finished a Catastrophe Level mission alone!”

“Catastrophe Level? How is it possible?”

“It’s true. He has submitted the task here today. Many people saw it clearly.”

“The good man. It has been only 15 years since Blood Mountain joined us, right? But what has he been doing over these past 15 years?”

“He’s been accepting tasks, madly accepting tasks. He always took them alone and completed them. He has now finished 14 Death Level tasks.”

“Of the 14 Death Level missions, there are six simple tasks worth 5,000 points and eight difficult ones worth 8,000 points. And now, he has actually completed a Catastrophe Level task alone?”

“Oh my God!”

“Madman, madman, he is totally insane.”

“He is really crazy, a terrible madman.”

The other Blood Eagle Guards marveled.

They were stupefied.

They sighed in admiration.

When Jian Wushuang first accepted the first Death Level mission and was about to carry it out alone, the other Blood Eagle Guards all sneered at him and made fun of him. They did not think much of him.

But it only ended up taking him a month to complete the Death Level task by himself.

At that time, the other Blood Eagle Guards still had some doubts about his strength and thought that it was good luck. However, Jian Wushuang had finished three Death Level missions in his first year and got a promotion to a Two-clawed Blood Eagle Guard, so finally, they believed in his strength.

It was possible to complete a Death Level task alone with some luck, but finishing three tasks alone within a year was not due to luck.

Over the past 15 years, Jian Wushuang had crazily accepted one task after the next that terrified the other Blood Eagle Guards, but in the end, he had succeeded.

Now he had completed a Catastrophe Level task alone.

That was Catastrophe Level!

Generally, it was hard for Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards to finish a Catastrophe Level task alone, but Jian Wushuang had made it.

Jian Wushuang had proved his strength.

The other Blood Eagle Guards regarded Jian Wushuang with admiration and awe.

“He has finished so many Death Level missions, and received all the points. Now he has completed a Catastrophe Level mission alone and gained more points. So his total points must have reached the requirement for Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard, right?”

“Well, according to the points, he has achieved it indeed.”

“We only have 17 Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards. It seems that we’ll soon have the 18th one. Blood Mountain is rising so fast!”

“Too fast, his progress is really fast.”

“Blood Mountain is really a monster.”

Many Blood Eagle Guards marveled at his performance, while in the towering blood palace, Commander Hong stood on the steps with his hands behind his back. He also received the message that Jian Wushuang had completed a Catastrophe Level task alone.

“No one below Peak of Step Six could hope to finish Disaster-level tasks, but Jian Wushuang has done it,” Commander Hong sighed to himself.

“Jian Wushuang defeated Xia Yan when he was a Divine Realm expert, so his battle strength should be above Step Five of the Eternal Realm. After joining the Blood Eagle Guard, he broke through into the Eternal Realm. He benefitted a lot from the Divine Sea. I thought that his battle strength had barely reached Step Six, so I did not expect that he would improve at such a ridiculous speed!”

“15 years, even considering his many training opportunities and many treasures from the Treasure Vault, it is still incredible for him to have made so much progress in 15 years.”

“This boy is a real monster!”

“In the history of my Blood Eagle Guard, there has never been such a peerless genius. Even in the entire Eternal World, there are only a few. As far as I know, the only one that is stronger than him is the Big Young Master of the Xia Clan.”

After a few rueful words, he sent a message straight to Commander Hong, ordering him to send the third-rank armor to Jian Wushuang.

“From now on, the young man is a Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard.” Commander Hong smiled faintly.

Suddenly, Commander Hong turned his hand and took out a token. From that token came a message.

After seeing the message, Commander Hong, who had been in a good mood, became solemn.

“Order all Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards who are currently on their missions to stop immediately and return to the lair!”
