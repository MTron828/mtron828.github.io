Chapter 3312: Another One Arrived

_______________

Boom!

The power mercilessly bombarded the land below. The entire Saha Island, the many landmasses that were still floating on the surface of the water, all crumbled at this moment. In the blink of an eye, the entire Saha Island had already disappeared completely.

At the same time, that shocking power also affected the surrounding void space. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Retreat, retreat quickly!”

“Run quickly, or we’ll die!”

“This power is too terrifying, run quickly!”

Those experts who were close to the golden-armored god puppet and the white-robed bald man, Life and Death Saint Master, immediately retreated frantically.

They were very clear that the battle between the golden-armored god puppet and Life and Death Saint Master had completely exceeded the scope of Principles Master, and it was not something they could get involved in. Once they were affected by the shockwaves, the weaker Principles Masters…it was very likely that they would be directly killed. Even the stronger Principles Masters did not dare to easily withstand the aftershocks.

In the center of that shocking power, the palm of the Life and Death Saint Master had already grabbed the tip of the golden spear. However, not long after they made contact, the Life and Death Saint Master let out a soft exclamation and immediately released his palm, at the same time, he took two steps back.

“Haha, it seems that this seat has been too careless. After so many years, your four ancient immortals’ control over this god puppet has increased by quite a bit compared to before. Previously, you could only barely unleash 10% of its power, but now, even though you can only unleash less than 20% of its power, it’s still very close.” Life and Death Saint Master continued to smile warmly.

Even though he had suffered a small loss because he had been too arrogant in the face-to-face confrontation, he did not mind it at all.

“Again!”

Life and Death Saint Master waved his hand. Originally, there was only white light pervading his body, but at this moment, a large amount of black light suddenly surged out. The black and white light were incomparably dazzling, and under Life and Death Saint Master’s control…the black and white light perfectly merged together and formed a huge life and death picture. The white represented life, while the black represented death!

Life and Death Saint Master pointed from afar.

Bang!

This huge life and death picture directly crushed towards the golden-armored god puppet. At this moment, everyone around felt unprecedented pressure. This pressure caused everyone present to be unable to breathe.

“Break!”

A stern cry was emitted from within the golden-armored puppet. Immediately, the power of the golden spear suddenly soared. It was clearly a long spear, but at this moment, it had directly transformed into a resplendent golden star, it also carried a power that far surpassed that of a Principles Master as it collided against the life and death diagram.

Bang!

The collision between the two was still as earth-shaking as before. It was even more intense than the previous collision, but the result was completely different.

After the collision, although the life-death pattern was pushed back, the golden-armored puppet was also pushed back immediately. Even the surrounding power and aura were weakened a lot. obviously…the golden-armored puppet was crushed by the collision.

“Bai Xing, let’s stall him. Take the little guy and go!” The old woman’s voice came from the golden-armored puppet. As soon as she finished her words, the golden-armored puppet attacked the Life and Death Saint Master again.

“Go!”

Temple Master Bai Xing did not hesitate at all. As soon as they gave the order, the experts from the Temporal Temple surrounded Jian Wushuang and rushed toward the nearby void.

Although the void was still confined by spacetime, it only prevented them from teleporting and teleporting. They could still escape normally.

The experts of the three Saint Realms, the Sorceror God Sect, and the Nine-tailed Clan would not let them escape, so they immediately began to block them.

However, with the presence of the super expert, Elder Dark Bone, the experts of the Temporal Temple could run amok. No one in the three Saint Realms could compete with Elder Dark Bone, as long as the people of the Temporal Temple could protect Jian Wushuang and help him break out of the space-time confinement, he could use space-time teleportation to leave.

“Kuo Lei, the little guy is about to escape. Why aren’t you worried at all?” The old woman’s voice sounded again from the golden puppet.

“Worried? Why should I be worried?” The Life and Death Saint Master continued to smile. “Do you really think the little guy can escape? What a joke.”

Hearing this, the four ancient immortals in the golden-armored puppet frowned.

“Hehe, I’m afraid you don’t know that I’m not the only one here.” The Life and Death Saint Master said with a faint smile.

As soon as he said this, the four ancient immortals’ expressions changed drastically.

In the void on the other side, Jian Wushuang, escorted by the Temporal Temple and Elder Dark Bone, was about to break out of the space-time imprisonment. However, at this moment…a figure suddenly appeared in front of them.

It was a middle-aged man in purple armor, with his arms crossed and his body emitting endless Demonic Qi.

The middle-aged man’s face was cold, and his eyes were cold and aloof as if all living beings were ants in his eyes.

The appearance of the purple-armored demon lord instantly made everyone in the Temporal Temple stop in their tracks. Even Elder Dark Bone stopped in the void at this moment. Elder Dark Bone raised his head and looked at the purple-armored demon lord, his pupils constricted.

“This person…”

“The same feeling, the same feeling as the Life and Death Saint Master!”

“Could it be another Saint Master?”

Many experts from the Temporal Temple looked at the person in front of them in shock.

“Greetings, Saint Master!”

The Principles Masters from the Flame Saint Realm from the three great Saint Realms bowed fervently when they saw this person. From their greetings, they could instantly confirm the identity of this person.

“Flame Saint Master!”

“As expected, another Saint Realm Master!”

“Oh my God!”

The surrounding experts who were watching the battle were shocked again.

Two of the three Saint Realm Masters from the Divine Beginning Realm had arrived on the battlefield at this moment, and their goal was only for one person, an Immortal Saint, and that person was Jian Wushuang!

“Damn it!”

Temple Master Bai Xing’s eyes darkened as he looked at Elder Dark Bone. “Dark Bone, with your strength, can you fight against the Flame Saint Master?”

“Fight?” Elder Dark Bone smiled bitterly. “A master of the Saint Realm is a master of the Saint Realm after all. Although I’m confident that I can survive in his hands, it’s impossible for me to fight him head-on. At most, I can only hold him off for a while.”

“It’s enough to hold him off for a moment. I’ve already received a message from the Hall Master. The Hall Master has already returned to the edge of the Divine Beginning Realm. With his use of time and space, he only needs 15 minutes at most to arrive here!” Palace Master Bai Xing said seriously..
