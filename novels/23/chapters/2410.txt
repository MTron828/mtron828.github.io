Chapter 2411: Nine Bridge of Trials

After Narcissus Island disciples reached a consensus, the group directly set out to the inner area.

All they had to do was just go deeper into the tomb and managed to reach the inner area in just one day.

The inner area was much smaller than the outer area.

They were greeted with a barren open space. In front of the open space was an abyss that was filled with a thick fog and raging fire. The crazy burning fire was enough to burn any Divine Demons into ashes.

The void hovering over the abyss was covered with thunderclouds, and there were flashes of horrible looking scarlet-gold thunder within it. The scarlet-gold thunder was enough to make First-Class Divine Demons palpitate.

There was no doubt that no one would dare to approach either the thunderclouds above or the fiery abyss below.

The only way to pass through the open space was a stone bridge connecting the middle of the abyss’s both ends!

In between the two ends of the abyss, there were nine stone bridges.

Each of the nine stone bridges was extremely long and looked like some ancient architecture.

The ten Narcissus Island disciples were standing before the abyss.

“This is the abyss of trials where the nine trials are,” said Zhong Yi. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The other disciples looked at the abyss in front of them with eyes especially filled with excitement while they studied the nine stone bridges.

The four opportunities of Saint’s Tomb.

The most precious one was no doubt the six seats for looking at Fengtian Scroll.

Placed second was the inner area’s nine trials which could bring about nine opportunities.

The nine opportunities which were left behind by the Crimson Stone Saints included his valuable inheritance.

The nine trials were in the abyss of trials, specifically on the nine stone bridges.

The nine stone bridges were called Bridge of Trials with each trial bridge representing an arduous test. One had to walk through the trial bridge to the abyss’s other end to collect the opportunity.

Originally, there were 16 trial bridges in the abyss, but as the tomb had been opened many times in the past, seven of the trial bridges have been overcome. The trial bridges with their accompanied opportunities claimed, then collapsed directly into the fiery abyss.

“Since the tomb has just been opened for a few days, disciples from various sects are currently staying in the outer area to collect Purple Amulets. We should be the first group to enter the inner area. With no one here now, Junior Brother Wei Qing and those of you who are injured should restore your strength and state as soon as possible. Those of you who are fine can try breaking through these trial bridges. If you are lucky enough to pass through one of them, it will benefit you a lot,” said Zhong Yi.

The disciples nodded and either immediately went to work on recuperating or headed to the nine trial bridges.

Zhong Yi looked at Su Tong again. “Junior Sister Su Tong, you are very talented in spear combat skills. The master of Saint’s Tomb, Crimson Stone Saint had achieved a high spear combat skill level before his death, so that must be his legacy. You should try out the trials. The trial bridge which leads to the Crimson Stone Saint’s inheritance should be the fifth bridge, the one right in the middle.”

“Hmm.” Su Tong looked eager.

She entered the tomb for Crimson Stone Saint’s precious inheritance.

She knew that Crimson Stone Saint was at the superior level of an Undying Saint and must have set up a very tough trial since many geniuses experts from Wusha Wilderness who were better than her and also skilled in spear combat had also failed the trial. She thought there was an 80 percent chance that she would also fail the trial.

Then again, she should still give it a go.

Su Tong walked towards the fifth trial bridge.

In the previous battle, Jian Wushuang did not suffer any injuries, hence he did not need to spend time recuperating and walked towards the nine trial bridges.

‘I wonder what are the trials in these nine trial bridges and what opportunities that come with it?’ Jian Wushuang smiled and went on to individually investigate it.

Those nine trial bridges were extremely mysterious. As soon as Jian Wushuang stepped on the bridges, he would immediately know the opportunities that he could gain after crossing those trial bridges.

“Mmm, the opportunity for this first trial bridge turned out to be a cultivation secret technique for Hundred Refining Divine Demon.” Jian Wushuang was a little surprised, but he immediately shook his head.

He was not interested in the cultivation secret technique at all since he already had two cultivation techniques—’Primordial Void Celestial Body’ and ‘Thousand Perils Body’.

Both secret techniques were within the top ten cultivation techniques in the Ancient God Domain. One was the strongest secret cultivation technique of the Ancient Race, and the other was the fifth strongest secret techniques of the Seven Stars Black Sect. Any one of them was very well sought after by countless experts.

The ‘Hundred Refining Divine Demon’ that appeared before Jian Wushuang might be well sought after among the Divine Demons in Wusha Wilderness such that even gods and experts were after it, but that was only because they had no chance to obtain higher-level cultivation secret techniques. As for Jian Wushuang, that technique did not appeal to him at all.

Jian Wushuang did not attempt to cross the trial bridge as he was not interested in that opportunity.

Soon, Jian Wushuang arrived at the second trial bridge.

“Oh, saber skills created by an Undying Saint himself?” Jian Wushuang raised his brows but proceeded to the third trial bridge.

After passing by all the trial bridges, Jian Wushuang knew about the opportunities that came with them.

All the opportunities left by the Crimson Stone Saints were indeed good and there was a myriad of them.

There were skills, secrets, and treasures.

There was a unique bronze bell treasure among them. The bronze bell had mysterious secret patterns on it and those secret patterns were of great help in understanding the Destruction Law.

Unfortunately, what Jian Wushuang wanted was not the Destruction Law, so the bronze bell was of little use to him and he was also unable to pass the trial bridge where the bronze bell was located.

After walking through seven trial bridges in a row, Jian Wushuang did not find any opportunities that were useful to him.

Until he set foot on the eighth trial bridge...

As soon as he set foot on the eighth trial bridge, a message immediately came to him.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes suddenly lit up.

The opportunity that came along with the eighth trial bridge was the insights and swordsmanship skills left by an Undying Saint!

The Undying Saint was the Purple Blood Saint!

“Purple Blood Saint’s Purple Blood Swordsmanship?” A trace of joy flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

According to the trial bridge’s message he received, the Purple Blood Saint, also known as the Purple Blood Sword Saint, was an extremely terrifying Undying Saint during his lifetime. He was also a terrifying sword cultivator who had a deep swordsmanship understanding. The Purple Blood Swordsmanship that he created was also very famous.

What the trial bridge kept was the insights of Purple Blood Saint and the complete set of his Purple Blood Swordsmanship.

An Undying Saint-level sword cultivator and his insights were very appealing to Jian Wushuang.
