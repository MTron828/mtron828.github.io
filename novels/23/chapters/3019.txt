Chapter 3020: Swarmed Forward

——

Divine Punishment!

Control heaven and earth punishment!

The Golden Emperor’s shadow formed by this secret skill had a great deterrent effect, which would make people fearful.

And as Jian Wushuang’s control of this secret skill increased, the deterrent effect would become more and more powerful.

Now, when the 30,000-meter-tall Divine Punishment realm expert appeared, the weaker rank one and rank two True Saints did not dare to look at him. Only cultivators above rank three True Saints could remain calm in front of the Divine Punishment realm expert, however, they would still be somewhat intimidated.

However, this secret skill would not only intimidate the other experts but also increase their own strength.

“The Divine Punishment, who was only 30,000 feet tall before, didn’t improve my divine power that much. But now, it’s 30,000 feet tall…” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and felt the power of his divine power under the Divine Punishment, the power of his divine power had increased dramatically.

He could feel that the power of his divine power had almost doubled at this moment!

Yes, almost doubled!

However, when his divine power was fully unleashed, it was much stronger than that of Gold King, who was close to the peak of rank three. To put it bluntly, his own divine power was comparable to that of a peak rank three True Saint.

Now that his divine power had almost doubled, although it was not comparable to that of a rank four True Saint, it had completely surpassed that of a rank three True Saint.

“Gold King, come and take another strike from me.”

Jian Wushuang’s cold voice reverberated between heaven and earth. At this moment, he was full of divine power, and the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand was slowly raised.

Gold King’s face was extremely solemn. He could see that Jian Wushuang’s secret skill was extraordinary, so he did not dare to underestimate Jian Wushuang’s next strike.

Buzz!

Jian Wushuang made his move.

He struck out with his sword again, and the dazzling sword light appeared again.

Jian Wushuang used the same move, ‘Xi Xiang’.

The sword skill did not improve at all, but what was improved was the power of Jian Wushuang’s divine power.

“Humph!”

Gold King’s eyes turned cold, and vast divine power and a large number of gold principles gathered in his hand at a terrifying speed.

Suddenly, Gold King thrust his spear.

“Whoosh!” The huge golden sun burst out again.

However, this time, the golden sun was obviously a little bigger than the golden sun that Gold King had previously displayed, and the light was even more dazzling.

‘Rumble!’ The void trembled, and the two terrifying attacks finally came into direct contact.

But at this moment…

“Get down!”

Jian Wushuang suddenly let out a roar, and the power of the sword light suddenly soared. The 30,000-meter-tall Golden Emperor Phantom behind him suddenly waved its sword.

The golden sword light directly struck the golden sun like a golden thunderbolt.

The dazzling golden sun instantly dimmed.

Gold King only felt his hands sink, and then a wave of intense pain spread out, and the bones in his two arms seemed as if they were about to explode. Subsequently, a terrifying oppressive force acted on his body, and in front of this oppressive force… Gold King actually did not have the slightest bit of leeway to resist.

Bang!

Gold King’s figure was like a meteorite that instantly smashed down from a height of several hundred meters.

With a loud bang, a huge hole was created in the ground. At the same time, a large number of sword beams rushed out, splitting the ground into pieces, leaving behind huge gullies.

As for Gold King, he had completely sunk into the bottom of the hole, losing all signs of life for a short period of time.

Silence!

The vast world had completely fallen silent, dead silent.

In the surrounding void, the experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom who were watching the battle were very confident in Gold King.

After all, Gold King was a super expert in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom whose strength was second only to the Magic Note King. He was close to the level of a peak rank three True Saint. It was a waste for such an expert to kill a rank one True Saint.

However, when they saw Gold King and Jian Wushuang fight, Gold King did not gain much of an advantage in a short period of time. Later, when Gold King went all out and only gained a slight advantage, they were already very shocked.

And now, they saw Gold King being hacked into the ground from hundreds of meters high by Jian Wushuang. In an instant…everyone was stunned!

They were all stunned.

Everyone’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

“How, how is this possible?”

Even Lord Wu widened his eyes and stared at the scene in front of him.

Bang!

A loud sound suddenly came from the hole in the ground, and then a golden figure rushed up again.

It was naturally Gold King, but his hair was messy and there was a trace of blood at the corner of his mouth. He looked very miserable.

He appeared in the void. His narrow eyes were burning with anger as he stared at Jian Wushuang.

He was furious!

In front of so many experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, he was struck underground by a rank one True Saint. This was an unprecedented humiliation for him, so he was furious!

However, other than anger, he was more shocked.

He was shocked by Jian Wushuang’s strength.

He had never thought that a rank one True Saint could be so powerful.

“I didn’t believe it when they said that he could easily kill a rank two True Saint at the level of a Divine Master. But now, I believe it,” Gold King muttered.

He had no choice but to believe it.

“He’s a complete monster!”

While Gold King was in shock, the experts from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom had also reacted. Their expressions were extremely ugly.

“Lord Wu, from the looks of it, even His Highness the Gold King himself can’t do anything to him! What should we do now?” A True Saint asked.

“What should we do?” Lord Wu’s eyes turned cold, but he growled, “His Highness the Gold King can’t kill him alone, so we will all charge forward. I don’t believe that he alone can survive the encirclement of so many True Saints!”

Hearing Lord Wu’s words, the surrounding experts from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom were stunned.

Encirclement!

Furthermore, there were dozens of True Saints. Not only were there first rank True Saints there were also many second rank True Saints and even third rank True Saints.

So many people were going to encircle and kill one person?

Most importantly, it was only a first rank True Saint that was being encircled and killed?

These experts looked at each other with extremely complicated feelings.

“Why? Do all of you still treat him as a first-rank True Saint?” Lord Wu swept his gaze across the surroundings.
