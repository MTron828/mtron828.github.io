Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Originally, Jian Wushuang had only wanted to inherit the Moon Picking Skill fully. However, during the process of inheriting it, his level of comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine had also increased greatly and it could be said to be an unexpected gain.

“I have already obtained the Ancient God Clan’s Four Unique Skills and Three Secret Skills. Moreover, I have also made a breakthrough to Real God. Thus, I have achieved all my objectives for coming to the Ancient God Sanctuary and it’s about time for me to leave,” Jian Wushuang stood up as he laughed.

Although he possessed the Bloodline of an Ancient God and a human being at the same time, he had been living in human territories ever since he was young. Hence, he naturally had a greater sense of belonging in human territories.

For his trip to the Ancient God Sanctuary, it was merely for the Unique Skills and Secret Skills. Since he had achieved his objectives, he naturally had to leave.

After walking out of the palace of inheritance, Jian Wushuang bid farewell to King Gu Tong, King Gu You, and the rest of the people he was familiar with.

After finding out that Jian Wushuang was about to leave, King Gu Tong, King Gu You and the rest of the people who he was familiar with were not surprised.

In no time, Jian Wushuang settled everything that he needed to settle in the Lineage of Ancient Gods. After that, he left the Ancient God Sanctuary and headed to the human territories.

“Hall Master Yuan, I have already left the Ancient God Sanctuary. Also, I have made a breakthrough to Real God,” Jian Wushuang informed Hall Master Yuan of what had happened.

“You made a breakthrough already? So quickly?” Hall Master Yuan was surprised at first. After that, he became delighted, “That’s great. Jian Wushuang, now, do you plan to return to the Lineage of Star or go to the Thunderbolt Island?”

“I should be going to the Thunderbolt Island,” Jian Wushuang said.

As he had just made a breakthrough, his abilities were in the eruption stage. Thus, he would benefit greatly if he were to go to the Thunderbolt Island to train at this stage.

“Since that’s the case, please be careful during your journey,” Hall Master Yuan warned.

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

A huge amount of time was required to return to the Thunderbolt Island from the Ancient God Island. However, the good thing was that after coming out of the Ancient God Sanctuary, no one had their eyes on him. As such, his journey was quite a smooth one.

Thunderbolt Island… the Sanctuary Alliance’s base.

After returning to the Thunderbolt Island, Jian Wushuang went to the Fairy Palace immediately.

“Old Snake.”

Jian Wushuang was standing in front of a black-skinned old man who was wearing a simple hemp garment.

The black-skinned old man was called Old Snake, the person in charge of the Fairy Palace.

“Jian Wushuang? I have not seen you for some time. Oh, you have made a breakthrough to Real God?” Old Snake was looking at Jian Wushuang and he could tell with a glance that Jian Wushuang had made a breakthrough to Real God.

“I am lucky to have made a breakthrough,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“An Inverse Cultivator at the level of a Real God. Although you have just made a breakthrough, from the looks of it, the Sanctuary Alliance will have an additional top expert who is able to compete against the Almighties soon.” Old Snake chuckled, “This time around, you wish to enter the Fairy Palace, right? Reincarnation Fairy Palace and Spacetime Fairy Palace. How many years do you wish to comprehend inside either of them for?”

“There is still forty years of training time remaining in each of the two Tokens of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy that I have, so I shall use up all of them,” Jian Wushuang said.

In the past, he would go to the Fairy Palace to comprehend every few years and he would comprehend for ten years every time.

However, at that moment, he had just made a breakthrough in his realm. Hence, the longer he could stay in the Fairy Palace to comprehend, the better it would be.

The Old Snake waved his hands toward Jian Wushuang’s two Tokens of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy, “You may go in.”

Jian Wushuang entered the Reincarnation Fairy Palace first.

In a vast, starlit sky, there was a total of twenty-seven picture scrolls which were filled with secrets.

Among the twenty-seven picture scrolls, Jian Wushuang had finished comprehending the tenth picture scroll previously.

However, when he was merely a Universe God back then, his abilities had achieved the maximum possible level and he was unable to raise them any further. Thus, his level of comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way had naturally stagnated. As such, he could only stop comprehending. However, at that very moment, it was different…

In the realm of Real Gods, there were no limits to the abilities one could have.

For example, if a Void Real God were extremely talented and also had great opportunities, his comprehension of the Heaven Way could absolutely achieve the standards to clear the fifth level, or even the sixth level, of the Doctrine Palace.

Of course, there would not be any normal Void Real God who could achieve that stage. After all, if his comprehension of the Heaven Way had already achieved such a stage, he would have been able to make a breakthrough to Eternal Real God a long time ago.

“Let’s begin.”

Jian Wushuang started to comprehend immediately.

As Jian Wushuang comprehended, he realized that after making a breakthrough to Real God, his ability to sense the Power of Heaven Way had risen greatly. When he was only a Universe God back then, with the aid of the twenty-seven pictures scrolls in the Reincarnation Fairy Palace as well as the wonderful guidance from the Fairy Palace, his comprehension speed was already extremely shocking.

At that moment, he had become a Real God. Thus, his comprehension speed had become many times faster as compared to before.

“It’s too fast. This comprehension speed is too fast.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jian Wushuang clenched both his fists tightly and he was extremely delighted.

With such a shocking comprehension speed, in just two years’ time, Jian Wushuang comprehended the eleventh picture scroll completely.

After that, he used another seven years’ time to fully comprehend the twelfth picture scroll.

After comprehending the twelfth picture scroll fully, it meant that Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of the Reincarnation Doctrine had achieved the standards needed to clear the fourth level of the Doctrine Palace.

Moreover, he was still left with thirty-one years of time.

“Continue!”

Jian Wushuang suppressed his happiness and continued to comprehend.

However, the Power of Heaven Way would become more complicated the more one comprehended it. As such, it would naturally become more difficult to comprehend. It was still alright for the first twelve picture scrolls. However, when Jian Wushuang reached the thirteenth picture scroll, his comprehension speed was obviously slower.

In the blink of an eye, forty years had passed and Jian Wushuang could only leave the Reincarnation Fairy Palace.

“During the forty years, of the twenty-seven picture scrolls in the Reincarnation Fairy Palace, I fully comprehended the thirteenth picture scroll and I’m even close to ninety percent of the fourteenth picture scroll. This is already considered not too bad,” Jian Wushuang was satisfied.

After all, if he were to rely on his own abilities to train, it would be unknown as to how many years it would take for him to achieve such a level in his comprehension of the Reincarnation Doctrine.

However, the Reincarnation Doctrine served as his shortcut and he only spent a short forty years.

“Next, it’s time for the Spacetime Fairy Palace.”

While wearing a smile, Jian Wushuang entered the Spacetime Fairy Palace immediately.

Similarly, he could comprehend for forty years in the Spacetime Fairy Palace.

Moreover, his comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine was at a higher level than the Reincarnation Doctrine and it could already clear the fourth level of the Doctrine Palace a long time ago.

For the forty years, Jian Wushuang comprehended thoroughly. After forty years, of the twenty-seven picture scrolls in the Spacetime Fairy Palace, he had fully comprehended the first fourteen picture scrolls and he was also about to be done with the fifteenth picture scroll.

“Just a little bit more. Just a little bit more and I will be able to comprehend the fifteenth picture scroll fully.”

When Jian Wushuang walked out of the Spacetime Fairy Palace, he was a bit dissatisfied.

He felt that if he were to stay in the Spacetime Doctrine for another short period of time – maybe about four to five years – he would be able to comprehend the fifteenth picture scroll fully.

It should be known that as long as he comprehended the fifteenth picture scroll fully, he would be able to clear the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace.

By clearing the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace, he would be able to obtain the right to stay in Thunderbolt Island permanently. Moreover, this was something that many Chaotic Real Gods were unable to achieve.

In addition, there would also be a very huge meaning in Jian Wushuang clearing the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace using his Spacetime Doctrine!
