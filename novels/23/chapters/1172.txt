Chapter 1173: The Ultimate Test

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Haha, Gu King, I’ve hardly seen you like this.” Seeing Gu King who climbed out of Jian Wushuang, Lord Spirit Sound couldn’t help but laugh.

When Gu King was in the Stellar Fog Sea, it was a real behemoth, big enough for anyone to look up to.

But now…

“Humph.” Gu King snorted, but did not want to say anything else.

Lord Spirit Sound shrugged and looked at Jian Wushuang. “Blood Mountain, have you ever met the disciple who left Star Island four million years ago when you were outside?”

“You mean Star King?” Jian Wushuang looked regretful and immediately shook his head. “I have never encountered any expert named Star King in these years in the Green Fire World, and I have had people check, but in vain.”

In the long history of Star Island in the Green Fire World, only two people had left the Star Island.

One was Jian Wushuang, and the other was Star King.

The Star King passed the test four million years ago and left the Star Island.

When Jian Wushuang stayed in the Green Fire World, he had people checked, but there was no one named Star King.

“Since Star King can survive the test on the Star Island, he must be a true top genius. But if such a genius did not gain any reputation in the Green Fire World, he must have died a long time ago, or had left the Green Fire World.” Jian Wushuang speculated.

In the Green Fire World, there were indeed many experts who, in order to pursue a higher level of strength, chose to enter the Eternal Chaotic World once they broke through to the Dao Master level.

“Is that so?” Lord Spirit Sound nodded slightly, but immediately smiled. “Forget it. Blood Mountain, you return to Star Island this time for the ultimate test, but the ultimate test can be extraordinary.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

After a pause, Lord Spirit Sound continued, “The ultimate test on our Star Island is invented for Holy Masters. Although you are only a Dao Master, as an Inverse Cultivator, you are indeed qualified to be tested, but this is only the first step. I’m afraid you can pass it easily.”

“I know it isn’t easy, but I have to try anyway.” Jian Wushuang comforted her.

“OK, I will take you there now.” Lord Spirit Sound got up.

Under the guidance of her, Jian Wushuang soon came to the center of the Star Island, where four tall black towers stood.

The four black towers represented the four levels of test, and the tallest one in the last was the ultimate test on the Star Island.

At the moment, before the Black Tower, it was already packed with ??people.

All the Warriors trapped on the Star Island have gathered here. They knew that Jian Wushuang had returned for the ultimate test, so they all waited here full of expectations.

“He’s here, Blood Mountain is here!”

“Blood Mountain!”

When Jian Wushuang showed up, the crowd immediately clamored around him, and their eyes were extremely keen.

“They’re really passionate, aren’t they?” Jian Wushuang cocked one eyebrow.

“These people have seen hope in you. They hope that you can overcome this ultimate test and take them away, of course they’re passionate about you.” Lord Spirit Sound smiled. “Well, the ultimate test is there, off you go.”

“OK.”

Jian Wushuang nodded to himself and took a deep breath. Then, he immediately entered the black tower where the ultimate test was under the eyes of those warriors.

Once in the black tower, Jian Wushuang found himself in a dark Void.

This dark Void was boundless, even with his Soul Power, he failed to sense the Perimeter of it. Such a vast Void was big enough for Universe Masters to fight freely.

In the center of this dark Void, a burly figure with a huge ax stood.

“Is he my opponent in this ultimate test?”?Jian Wushuang stayed vigilant and tried to make out the burly figure in the dark.

That burly figure possessed no aura at all. He was just a Puppet Fighter.

Before taking the test, he asked Lord Spirit Sound about it.

He knew that this ultimate test was different from those of the other three black towers. Other tests were divided into three stages.

But the ultimate test had only one stage and one opponent. The opponent must be the Puppet Fighter carrying a huge ax in front of him.

When Jian Wushuang entered this dark Void, the calm figure stood in the dark opened his eyes suddenly.

His eyes were in a strange golden color, and the moment he opened them, a horrible Killing Intent immediately vented, causing the surrounding Void to tremble.

“All you have to do is beat me!” The burly man with a huge ax opened his mouth and his voice was cold.

“Defeat this Puppet Fighter and I’ll pass the test? The process is simple, but I’m afraid it won’t be that easy.”?Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, and Blood Mountain Sword was already in his hands.

“Let’s start this!”

The burly man stared at Jian Wushuang and his eyes flashed with Killing Intent.

Boom!

The Void under the burly man’s feet immediately collapsed, and then, he approached Jian Wushuang like a Flowing Light.

“So fast!”?Jian Wushuang squinted.

His speed was definitely much faster than the usual Universe Masters.

At the moment when the burly man moved, he was holding the huge ax that had been on his back.

The burly man clasped the giant ax, which was glaring with dazzling golden light, vast powers condensed. Without too many tricks, he directly brandished it at Jian Wushuang. At that moment, a beautiful blood red halo broke out.

Standing in front of the huge ax, Jian Wushuang felt it was like a savage beast.

The prevailing power in the huge ax made him his heart jerk.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang grunted. The Soul Fire in the sea of consciousness trembled slightly, and then, the Soul Power swept out, forming a sharp soul spike. The spike flicked toward the burly man and penetrated his body.

However, the burly man just pasued. Soon, he struck his giant ax again.

“How could he not be affected by my Soul Attack?”

Jian Wushuang was shocked. He surged this strengh throught his arms. Finally, the strength all gathered in Blood Mountain Sword.

“Heaven’s Bane!”

Jian Wushuang looked vicious. He had tried his best to display his most powerful stroke Heaven’s Bane.

Bam!

There was a fierce explosion in the Void. Jian Wushuang tried hard to contain himself. The void under his feet was shattered like scraps of paper.

The burly man pulled back the giant ax lightning fast, and the next moment, he struck again.
