Chapter 3141: Kill Them All

——

Weng!

Endless Power of ice and fire swept over, causing Deacon Qi and the others to tremble.

“This is…a domain?”

“It’s a domain, but this domain is so strong!”

“It’s too strong, this domain is too strong. My strength was actually suppressed by 40% in an instant!”

The shocked voice came from the Purple Cloud Pavilion’s experts.

The most terrified one was Long Lu, who had just reconstructed his divine body.

“40%? You guys only suppressed 40%, but my strength has been suppressed by 70%!” Long Lu said in fear.

“What?” Deacon Qi and the others were also shocked.

A low-grade rank six True Saint’s strength had been suppressed by 70%?

How could this domain be so powerful?

What they did not know was that the ice-fire swimming dragon ruler was a domain-type true treasure!

Under normal circumstances, only Principles Masters had a true treasure, and domain type true treasures were extremely rare.

Jian Wushuang, who controlled the ice-fire swimming dragon ruler, was only a rank four True Saint. Even if he used all kinds of secret techniques, he could only match the divine power of a rank seven True Saint. If a Principles Master were to control this true treasure personally…with a thought, the Principles Master could easily cover an area with the ice and fire domain and crush countless cultivators in the area. Even a rank seven True Saint at the peak of rank seven could be annihilated!

This was how terrifying a domain-type supreme treasure was.

Now, Jian Wushuang was using the divine power of a rank seven True Saint to suppress Long Lu, an ordinary rank six True Saint. Of course, he could suppress 70 percent of his strength.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis is much stronger than us. Now that he has used this domain, won’t we…” Long Lu was still thinking in fear.

Suddenly…

“Be careful!”

A cry of alarm suddenly sounded.

Long Lu was shocked and subconsciously turned his head. When he turned his head, he saw Jian Wushuang, who was emitting cold killing intent.

Jian Wushuang had a strange smile on his face. When he saw Long Lu, he even winked at him, but the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand had already flown straight out.

It was the Peerless Sword Manual, Star Dream!

Chi!

The sword light cut into Long Lu’s divine body. The divine power of a rank seven True Saint, combined with the rank six absolute art, Star Dream, burst out with a terrifying tearing force, instantly cutting a gap in the protective armor on Long Lu’s body, it directly left a bloody mark on Long Lu’s divine body.

It was just a bloody mark, but Long Lu’s divine body did not completely collapse. He was about to let out a breath, but in the next moment, his eyes were wide open.

He had already sensed that on the bloody mark, a terrifying erosive force suddenly burst out.

This erosive force crazily eroded and annihilated his divine power. The speed of the annihilation was completely beyond his imagination.

“Poison, venom?” Long Lu murmured.

Jian Wushuang, who was standing in front of him, smiled and said, “Have you ever heard of cold-blood venom?”

“Cold-blood venom?” Long Lu was completely stunned, and his eyes were full of despair.

Cold-blood venom was one of the most terrifying poisons in the Primordial Divine Realm that targeted the level of the Immortal Saint!

For example, Jian Wushuang had exchanged for the god-burning poison and the evil god poison, which only had a great effect on the lower level Immortal Saint, most of them only needed hundreds of thousands of holy elixirs to exchange for one drop.

But the cold-blood poison was different.

The cold-blood poison, even with the authority of a heaven-level member, required 100 million holy elixirs to exchange for one drop in the Treasure Pavilion!

100 million holy elixirs could only be exchanged for one drop.

How precious was it!

To put it bluntly, the cold blood poison was the most expensive poison that Jian Wushuang could exchange for!

However, since the price was so high, the effect was naturally not trivial.

“One drop of the cold blood poison is enough to completely erode the divine power of a rank seven True Saint. Even if you kill a peak rank seven True Saint, you can only use two drops at most. As a rank six True Saint, you should be satisfied if you can let me use one drop of the cold blood poison,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

He was talking to Long Lu, but unfortunately, she could no longer hear him because the cold blood poison had completely eroded Long Lu’s divine power in the blink of an eye, Long Lu’s life force had been completely cut off, and she could not be more dead.

“Long Lu is dead. Now, it’s your turn.”

Jian Wushuang’s cold eyes looked at Deacon Qi and the others again.

“Oh no!”

“Run!”

Deacon Qi and the others were scared out of their wits when they heard that Jian Wushuang had the cold blood poison. They did not dare to stay any longer.

“Can you escape?”

Jian Wushuang instantly chased after them while the ice and fire domain crazily pressed down on the four people.

The four people were all at the peak of rank six True Saint. They were powerful and had incredible speed. However, under the pressure of the ice and fire domain, their speed was greatly suppressed. Compared to Jian Wushuang, they were like snails.

The dark light surrounded by the giant dragon suddenly pierced through the void and charged toward Deacon Qi.

Deacon Qi waved his giant ax to block the attack. Even without the suppression of the realm, he had been severely injured by the dark light, let alone now.

Bang!

After the collision, Deacon Qi spat out blood again. His divine body was severely damaged, and Jian Wushuang had caught up with him.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Sword lights suddenly swept out.

Wushuang’s Sword Manual, ninth firmament illusionary sword realm!

“No!”

Deacon Qi let out a shrill cry.

However, in just one exchange, this Deacon Qi, who was at the peak of rank six True Saint Realm, was killed by Jian Wushuang in an instant.

Then, Jian Wushuang caught up with the other three one by one.

In the face of Jian Wushuang’s absolute strength, the three had no room to resist and were all killed by Jian Wushuang.

Of course, in order to kill the five people, Jian Wushuang also used five drops of the cold blood poison, which was worth 500 million holy elixirs!

The experts of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance who were watching the battle were stunned.

“Four rank six Peak True Saints and one initial level True Saint died just like that?”

“How could a rank four True Saint kill five rank six True Saints so easily?”

“Oh my God, am I dreaming?”

Everyone could not believe their eyes. Some people even thought that they were under an illusion and saw something impossible.

But after rubbing their glasses, they found that what they saw was the truth.

Four rank six Peak True Saints and one initial rank six True Saint of the Purple Cloud Pavilion had really been killed by Jian Wushuang!

Not only killed but also slaughtered!

A one-sided slaughter!

It was like slaughtering chickens and dogs, with no room for struggle!
