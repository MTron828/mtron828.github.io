“This speed?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The black-robed elder witnessed Jian Wushuang’s speed in shock, but soon snorted. A black gas surged as he sped up and chased Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang ran and the black-robed elder chased, and soon they both disappeared on the battlefield.

As for the Demon Gods, including four Silver-armored Demon Gods, they just realized and saw the black-robed elder chasing Jian Wushuang. They also wanted to help, but Jian Wushuang and the elder were far too fast.

Even though they could catch up, they were only the Copper-armored and the Silver-armored Demon Gods, so they wouldn’t be able to ward against the black-robed elder’s attack.

The only one who could help was the Gold-armored Demon God, but he chased Wu Dao, making it impossible.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang could only rely on himself.

In the dense jungle, Jian Wushuang ran in a frenzy. His eyes were full of rage, but more of it was self-blame and guilt.

“It’s my fault! I caused Gu Qiong’s death!”?Jian Wushuang clasped his hands.

In order to give him a chance to escape, the black-robed elder killed Gu Qiong.

It could be said that Gu Qiong saved Jian Wushuang by sacrificing himself.

He owed Gu Qiong his life!

“The old man!”

Jian Wushuang turned to look at the black-robed elder who still pursued him.

He didn’t know the elder, but before entering the Eternal Zone, he saw him in the Boundless Demon Sect camp. So, that meant he was from the Boundless Demon Sect.

The black-robed elder and the other experts from different Sects entered the inner layer of the Eternal Zone through the wormhole. However, this black-robed elder infiltrated through to the outer layer to kill him.

“I already knew three magnates would attack me, but I thought they would only be the disciples in the superior Divine Realm expert Level. To my surprise, the Boundless Demon Sect assigned an Eternal Realm expert sneaked out from the inner layer to kill me.”?Jian Wushuang shook his head.

He tried to conceal his strength to make the three magnate experts ignore him so he gained an opportunity to defend.

Like the Cloud Sea Asgard and the Immortal Dynasty, they both assigned their disciples to kill him. So he worked with the Demon God Clan to defeat them.

However, he never believed an Eternal Realm expert would return. He missed this point, so he caused Gu Qiong’s death and he was also in a dilemma.

“Boundless Demon Sect! Great!” Jian Wushuang laughed with bloodlust in his voice.

But, even his hatred and rage, he had to endure. The urgent task now was to save his life.

Jian Wushuang’s Spiritual Power burned bright. It was ten times faster than when he fought. Although his speed increased dramatically, he couldn’t maintain it for long.

“I cultivated the Heavenly Creation Skill, so my Spiritual Power is more than the other same level’s Warriors. However, since the burning speed is so fast, I cannot withstand it for long. But the old man…” Jian Wushuang saw the black-robed elder behind him.

The black-robed elder radiated black gas, obviously he also exploited the Secret Skill to increase his speed.

Moreover, he completely exploited the skill to speed up. He was as fast as Jian Wushuang.

He followed Jian Wushuang closely, so Jian Wushuang couldn’t lose him.

“This is really bad.”

Jian Wushuang squinted. In the Eternal Zone, he couldn’t use any Message Tokens, also his Slaughter Body was dead. Now, he tried his best to exploit the Dragon Blood Secret Skill, but still couldn’t escape.

“What can I do? What else can I do?”

Deep down, Jian Wushuang remained calm, but he was desperately looking for an opening to escape.

Suddenly, at the very end of his line of sight, he saw a territory covered in a pale, golden light. The inner layer of the Eternal Zone.

“Inner layer.”?Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

Ling Yu, the Vice Palace Master, told him that the inner layer was the Demon Gods’ home, so it was very dangerous. The Eternal Realm experts needed to be very careful and the Divine Realm couldn’t survive there.

But that was only for the other warriors.

Jian Wushuang was different!

After all, his aura was similar to the Demon Gods’, so they treated him as their clansman. For other people, the inner layer proved very dangerous, but for him, it might be a blessing.

“Go to the inner layer.”

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang endured the pain of the Spiritual Power burning and rushed to the inter layer of the Eternal Zone.

Behind him, the black-robed elder still pursued.

“This kid has such a good Escape Skill. I’ve completely exploited my Secret Skill, but I only can follow him, still can’t catch him.”?the black-robed elder stared at Jian Wushuang with his cold eyes.

“But this Secret Skill costs his Spiritual Power. He is only a Skyscraping Realm, so he doesn’t have endless Spiritual Power. Soon, when his Spiritual Power fades, then I would like to see what he can do.”

The black-robed elder acted casual, but he handled it painstakingly.

After all, here was the Eternal Zone. Not to mention the Demon Gods, there were lots of disciples from different Sects. If they saw him chasing Jian Wushuang and told the Ancient Sect, Xuan Yi would be furious and he would be in mortal danger.

But he was in a black robe and also covered his face, even though people saw him, they couldn’t recognize him at a distance.

At this moment…

“Hmm?”

The black-robed elder saw a territory covered in a pale, golden light in front of him.

“This kid, he wants to get into the inner layer? Hmm, he really has guts.”?the black-robed elder’s face clouded over.

In the inner layer, it was the home for the Demon God Clan, so he didn’t dare enter without a decent plan. Besides, there were numerous Eternal Realm experts, including the eight Eternal Realm experts from the Ancient Sect, they were all at the edge of the inner layer.

Based on his strength, he could do whatever he wanted in the outer layer. But the inner layer? No, that was more complicated.
