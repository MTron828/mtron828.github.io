Chapter 1426: Star Pavilion

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the secret room, Jian Wushuang stood alone. In front of him, there was a bead that gave out deep and serene light.

Under the cover of Jian Wushuang’s Soul Power, there was suddenly a wealth of information that surged towards him.

The information was, shockingly, the cultivation method of Xuan Mie Golden Body. It was imprinted in his head via inheritance.

Xuan Mie Golden Body, there was three volumes in total.

The very first volume itself required one to be a Universe God in the Third Heaven to qualify for cultivation. After the first volume, the divine body of a Universe God in the Third Heaven could be compared favorably to a Real God!

“The Xuan Mie Golden Body is really strong, but the threshold of cultivation is extremely high. Just the first volume itself would require one to be a Universe God in the Third Heaven and it would require the assistance of nine types of bloodline powers in order to succeed,” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

Although he was only a Universe God in the Second Heaven, as an inverse cultivator, regardless of if it was divine power or divine body, he could be compared favorably with a Universe God in the Third Heaven. He could just about reach the first requirement.

However, for the second requirement, there were nine types of bloodline power, and the higher level they were, the better. Jian Wushuang didn’t have that then.

“Jian Wushuang, you only need to know the cultivation method. As for the nine types of bloodline power, it’s easy. The assistance of nine types of bloodline power is nothing but some blood from a strong bloodline. Although you don’t have them, they are sold in the market outside. They are not rare. From what I have estimated, as long as one can assemble nine types of first-rate bloodline’s blood, it will be more than enough to cultivate Xuan Mie Golden Body,” King of Venomous Worms said.

In Eternal Chaotic World, there were quite a number of clans with unique bloodlines.

These bloodline clans were divided into strong and weak too.

The weakest was a third-rate bloodline clan, followed by a second-rate bloodline clan.

The first-rate bloodline clan was an extremely ferocious and unruly clan in Eternal Chaotic World.

Of course, like Jian Wushuang’s Ancient God bloodline, it was at the peak of Eternal Chaotic World. It already exceeded the first-rate bloodline clan’s coverage. It belonged to the peak of the bloodline clan.

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang nodded slowly.

After he had memorized the three volumes of Xuan Mie Universe God cultivation method, Jian Wushuang left Scripture Depository.

In the Sword Star where Jian Wushang was staying.

“Qiu Yue, how have you been over the ten years that I’ve not been around?” Jian Wushuang looked down .

“Mister, your performance during the battle ten years ago shocked everyone. All the disciples in Lineage of Star revered you and no one dared to bully us maids and servants from Sword Star. Even when we had some conflict, the moment we brought up Sword Star, those servants in Lineage of Star or even the ordinary disciples would be courteous enough to not find trouble with us,” Qiu Yue said.

“That’s great,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly and asked, “Qiu Yue, you’re a Universe God in the Third Heaven. You have stayed in Star land for so many years and you definitely have rich experience. I need some blood of the first-rate bloodline. Do you know where I can find it?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“The blood of first-rate bloodline clan?” Qiu Yue was stunned, then continued, “There’s Star Pavilion under the Lineage of Star. It can be found all over Star land. They sell various kinds of rare treasures. It naturally includes blood of some bloodline clan. Master can pay them a visit.”

“Star Pavilion?” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly.

Then, Jian Wushuang departed that very day.

Jian Wushuang shot from the boundlessness towards the busiest city, Snake Soul City.

Star Pavilion was located in Snake Soul City.

It was located in a busy city that was full of experts. Jian Wushuang came before the Star Pavilion directly.

“This is Star Pavilion. It looks rather magnificent.”

Jian Wushuang looked at the huge, delicate pavilion that was about nine floors high in astonishment.

Although Star Pavilion could be compared favorably to Vientiane Tower, which was the top one in the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, it could be considered as the top store in Star land.

There were many treasures collected here.

In Star Pavilion, in a private, secret room.

An elderly in purple robes stood before Jian Wushuang.

The elderly in purple robes had an imposing aura. He was be a Real God. However, the Real God behaved rather politely towards Jian Wushuang.

“Mister Jian Wushuang, I wonder what I can do for you.” The elderly in purple robes smiled.

Although he was a Real God, he was just an expert outside of Lineage of Star. He was naturally polite when he came across the disciples from Star Palace, which was located in the core of Lineage of Star.

“I need some blood of a first-rate bloodline clan,” Jian Wushuang stated straightforwardly.

“There are many kinds of first-rate bloodline clans. I wonder which clans does the master want, and how much of them?” The elderly in purple robe asked.

“As long as it’s a first-rate bloodline clan, any will do. The clans don’t matter. As for volume, please give me three drops of each,” Jian Wushuang said.

During the process of cultivating Xuan Mie Golden Body, if everything were to go smoothly, it would only require a drop of blood from the nine different bloodline clans. However, just in case, Jian Wushuang prepared three drops of each.

“Every drop of first-rate bloodline clan’s blood costs five hundred thousand Chaos Gems. You wanted nine types of bloodline, three drops of each type. It is a total of twenty-seven drops. In total, it would require thirteen million and five hundred thousand Chaos Gems,” the elderly in purple robes smiled.

“So expensive?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Thirteen million and five hundred thousand Chaos Gem was much higher than many Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven’s entire properties.

“Expensive?” The elderly in purple robes smiled, “Everyone knows that not only is the first-rate bloodline clan’s blood rare, but it is also widely used. Hence, its value is naturally high. Plus, as you’re a disciple from Star Palace, you are able to buy a drop of first-rate bloodline clan’s blood at the price of five hundred thousand. If it were to be anyone else, it would cost a million for a drop.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang was lost for words. He waved and took out the Qian Kun Ring, “I don’t have so many Chaos Gems, and I can only offer these treasures instead. Can you see how much these treasures cost?”

The elderly in purple robes nodded. He took over the Chaos Gems and started calculating. Very quickly, there was a result.

“Mister, the treasures in this Qian Kun Ring are valued at a total of about eight million Chaos Gems,” the elderly in purple robe replied.

“Only worth this much?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

The Qian Kun Ring that he took out contained the items that he had kept from the years where he had killed others.

It could be said that ninety-nine percent of his treasures were in the Qian Kun Ring. He never thought that it would only be worth eight million. It was still quite far away from the thirteen million and five hundred thousand Chaos Gems required.
