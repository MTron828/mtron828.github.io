Chapter 332: Go Berserk, Blood-Red Pupils!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The six experts of the Saint Realm entered the spotlight with an overbearing and unparalleled arrogance about them.

The entire Drill Ground began to sizzle at once.

“The experts of the Saint Realm? All six of you?”

“Is... that Wine Master?”

“Could it really be Wine Master AND Lady Black?”

“What are the Wind and Rain Immortals doing here? Haven’t they appeared publicly for a long time?”

“I recognize that shabby elder. He’s Old Weirdo Yunyang, who despite living for so long already, simply refuses to die no matter what. He’s ranked sixth on the Bloodmoon List of Tang Dynasty.”

Five of the six experts of the Saint Realm were recognized at once. The odd one out was Chi Mei, who became well-known considerably later and only in the Tang Dynasty.

Even so, the five recognized ones were undoubtedly top tier experts on Nanyang Continent.

Wine Master, for instance, was a supreme expert of the “Pinnacle” level, which was up there with Holy Emperor Palace and Alchemy School, and thus had to be respectfully and cautiously treated rather than be provoked.

Lady Black belonged to the Third-stage Domain, which Old Weirdo Yunyang could hold his own against even though he belonged to the Second-Stage Domain. These two people would be the most powerful sect members if they were placed in any of the eight sects.

Although the Wind and Rain Immortals, as well as Chi Mei, were slightly less powerful, they were also masters of a Domain.

The crowd was amazed by such an impressive lineup, and could only nod in agreement with Jian Wushuang’s words.

.

Is Ice Nether Valley really thinking of keeping back these virtuosos?

Is it good enough to?

“Wine Master, Lady Black, Old Weirdo Yunyang, the Wind and Rain Immortals, and one more who even though I can’t recognize, can tell to be a top-tier expert and a master of a Domain.” The Valley Master’s complexion darkened immensely.

Although Ice Nether Valley was the most powerful among the three valleys, it did not have many experts of the Saint Realm – there were ten of them in all. Of these ten, only five were true masters of a Domain, while the other five were merely normal experts of the Saint Realm.

The Valley Master would have remained confident of keeping back Jian Wushuang and co. had the Protective Array been well-preserved and ready to be used.

“Lady Black and Wine Master, Ice Nether Valley and I have always respected both of you, and have never dared to provoke you two in the slightest. What’s the intent of your actions today?” The Valley Master asked in a frosty voice.

“Valley Master Ye.” Wine Master laughed indifferently. “I have no choice. This disciple of mine raised a request for the first time after having acknowledged me as his master for so long. Surely I have to help him in some way, right?”

“Disciple?” With barely squinting eyes, the Valley Master shot a glance at Yang Zaixuan.

“Enough nonsense.” Jian Wushuang’s voice sounded once more. “My friends and I specifically came here to bring misery upon Ice Nether Valley. Nothing that you say matters. In the end, strength will decide everything.”

“Fourth Sister, do you want Ye Chen dead or alive?”

As Jiang Wushuang looked over at Su Rou, who was standing by the side, his complexion changed abruptly.

At present, Su Rou’s head was lowered and her eyes had shut unnoticed. Her thin and frail body was trembling, and she showed completely no reaction to Jian Wushuang’s words.

However, a considerably terrifying aura gradually began to rise up from her body.

As if it came from the boundless Underworld, the aura was ice cold and dark.

The attention of everyone on the Drill Ground immediately turned toward Su Rou the moment the aura rose into the air.

“What’s this?” Even Wine Master’s and Lady Black’s, who were standing beside Su Rou, aged complexions changed slightly.

The dark aura which seemed to be from the boundless Underworld was very weak at first, but it strengthened at an unimaginable pace.

In only a short time, the aura became powerful enough to discolor the skies while continuing to strengthen. A moment later, it enshrouded everyone present.

Many of the experts on the Drill Ground got goosebumps as the aura swept across.

“This aura...”

“What a terrifying aura. It’s even stronger than that of Wine Master and the experts of the Saint Realm!”

“What’s going on? That woman is clearly from the Yin-Yang Void Realm only. How could she have such a terrifying aura?”

Everyone was equally astounded.

The exception was Jian Wushuang, who stared solemnly at Su Rou.

This was not the first time he had seen this aura burst out of Su Rou’s body. On the few occasions?which he had seen it before, although the aura was also very intense and could exert a lot of power, it was nevertheless way weaker than the aura this time.

Its nature was also extremely different this time.

As Su Rou was being stared at by the crowd, the dark aura from her body rose to its most powerful state. The next moment, her eyes opened viciously, shooting forth a dazzling beam of bloody light which swept across everyone.

“Gosh!”

Many of the experts standing around were dumbstruck after seeing Su Rou’s pair of eyes.

“This...” Jian Wushuang was also taken aback greatly.

Her pupils, which were originally pitch black, had turned blood red!

It was not simply because of a few broken blood vessels. Rather, her pupils had changed color completely.

A pair of blood-red pupils!

It was icy and completely emotionless. The scalp of anyone who was seen by it turned numb and felt on the verge of bursting.

It would finally fixate upon Ye Chen’s body. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Su Rou thereupon stepped forth unexpectedly.

Although she took only a solitary and casual-looking step forward, it spanned a distance of over a hundred feet, allowing her to appear in front of the crowd of experts from Ice Nether Valley.

“I have always seen you as my benefactor...”

“I always thought that meeting you was the biggest blessing in my life...”

“When you said you wanted to marry me, I agreed without hesitation even though I was somewhat surprised. I thought that it was you who gave me everything I had. I thought that I would be nothing without you!”

“I never would have guessed that you, who occupied an irreplaceable position in my heart, were the person who killed my entire tribe!”

“On top of that, I never thought you would be this shameless despite being called Master Saint!”

The words which came out of Su Rou’s mouth were hair-raising and bordered on hysteria.

“Fake, everything is fake!”

“Today, I shall completely destroy all of this pretense!”

“And I shall destroy you as well.”

With her blood-red pupils remaining glued upon Ye Chen’s body, Su Rou slowly reached her palm out toward Ye Chen and smacked it on him as if it was a Hand of Death.
