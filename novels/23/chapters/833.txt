Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The other man, Xie Zi, had not battled any of the new recruits yet. Upon hearing the triangular-eyed man’s words, he raised his head and walked over.

Jian Wushuang suddenly got a feeling that he was much stronger than his companion. He might even be a top Divine Realm expert.

Ouyang Xu frowned at the man. He shared Jian Wushuang’s feeling, but he was still confident in his own power and not afraid.

“I accept your bet. Let’s fight!” Xie Zi said to Ouyang Xu in an icy voice.

Ouyang Xu snorted. He twisted his hands and two giant hammers appeared.

The hammers were gleaming a bronze light with a powerful aura.

“Two high level Eternal Weapons?”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

“Ouyang Xu is indeed from a large wealthy family with a rich background.”

Ouyang Xu made his move.

He struck out fiercely with the two giant hammers as he moved forward.

One strike after another, the hammers overwhelmed their target like a mountain.

Ouyang Xu attacked without leaving a chance for his opponent to even take a breath.

Xie Zi used a sharp cyan saber. He was dodging around swiftly like a ghost.

None of Ouyang Xu’s strikes managed to hit him.

Xie Zi suddenly struck out.

A dazzling blade light flashed in the air. Ouyang Xu was not expecting this and got hit. He was unable to launch an attack.

“How could this be?”

Ouyang Xu could not believe that he had been defeated.

He had completely suppressed Xie Zi first. How could he be defeated in a single sudden strike? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang, who had been watching from the side, shook his head.

“Ouyang Xu is powerful and can match a top Divine Realm expert. Xie Zi is a top Divine Realm expert himself.

“However, Xie Zi is more experienced at fighting.”

Jian Wushuang had an eye like a hawk; he could see everything.

Having lost the battle, Ouyang Xu paid the wager and returned reluctantly to his companions.

After Ouyang Xu had been defeated, the triangular-eyed man came forward again and looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Haha, boy, you are last. Stand up.”

Ouyang Xu and the other six recruits could not help looking at Jian Wushuang.

Under their watchful eyes, Jian Wushuang remained indifferent. He slowly stepped out and walked forward. He glanced at the triangular-eyed man and shook his head. “I’m not interested in fighting with you.”

“Oh?” The man smirked, unbothered, and turned to Xie Zi. “Xie Zi, he wants to battle you.”

Xie Zi frowned and was about to come over again.

“Sorry, I am not interested in him either.” Jian Wushuang shook his head again.

Xie Zi stopped in his tracks.

The triangular-eyed man looked at Jian Wushuang in amazement.

Who was this boy interested in?

“Is it me that you want to battle?” A cold voice suddenly echoed. It came from the elegant man who had been drinking alone at the table.

“Captain?”

The triangular-eyed man and Xie Zi looked at him.

“I’ve heard that both the Divine Realm experts and the Eternal Realm experts in the Royal Guard are elites. I’ve learned the power of the Divine Realm experts, so, I really want to know how powerful the Eternal Realm experts can be,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“You want to challenge me?” The captain glanced at Jian Wushuang and leaped across the table. He came up to him and said in a low voice, “To fight with me, you must wager two million Divine Gems.”

“Two million?”

Everyone was amazed.

“Two million?” Jian Wushuang shook his head with a smile and continued, “Two million Divine Gems is not enough.”

“Not enough?” The captain appeared surprised.

“Eight million Divine Gems, at least. Plus, all the Divine Gems the other recruits have lost to you three,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Eight… eight million?”

A few of the recruits were startled by the number.

For a Divine Realm expert, eight million Divine Gems was simply an astronomical number.

Even for many Eternal Realm experts, it was too much.

“This guy…”?His face fell.

Although he was only the captain of a small team, he had had several opportunities to earn Divine Gems, but still, he had about 10 million Divine Gems in total. The amount Jian Wushuang wanted was too much for him.

“Kid, can you afford eight million Divine Gems?” He stared coldly at Jian Wushuang.

“There are ten million Divine Gems in this Interspatial Ring. You can check it yourself.” Jian Wushuang took out an Interspatial Ring.

The Interspatial Ring had not been bound, so others could check it using their consciousness. After a simple check, everyone present indeed found 10 million Divine Gems inside.

“He actually has it.”?The elegant man’s expression turned strange.

The man did not know that although Jian Wushuang was only a Divine Realm expert, he had had an unusual experience. After Jian Wushuang killed Xia Yan and got his ring, he was much richer than even a Dao Master. 10 million Divine Gems was not a problem for him.

He could afford 100 million Divine Gems, let alone 10 million.

“Kid, what is your name?” the elegant man suddenly asked him.

“Blood Mountain.” Jian Wushuang answered.

“Blood Mountain?”

The captain was rapt in thought.?“Among the 1,000 recruits, there is only one person, Asura, in Step Four of the Eternal Realm. As for the rest of them, the strongest one should be at the same level as me. And I’ve never heard of a man named Blood Mountain.

“This boy dares to offer eight million Divine Gems as a bet to fight with me. He must be confident about his power.”

Seeing his hesitation, Jian Wushuang showed a meaningful smile. “What? You’re afraid that you’ll lose to me, captain?”

Hearing this, the triangular-eyed man and Xie Zi shut their mouths tight, not daring to say a word.

The man’s face darkened, but in the next moment, he had made up his mind. “Aside from Asura, I don’t believe there is another Step Four of the Eternal Realm expert in the new recruits.”

“I’ll take the bet!”
