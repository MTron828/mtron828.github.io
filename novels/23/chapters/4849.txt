4852 The Mysterious Jade Head

The figure in luxurious clothes, the arrogant look on his face, and the extremely lazy standing posture made him look even more unruly than Cui Jing.

After entering the palace, the 10 Yan Immortals controlled their powers and lifted him up to the third level.

Such a scene caused an uproar.

When they reached the third level, the luxuriously dressed figure glanced at Jian Wushuang and the others with a touch of disdain in his eyes before taking a seat.

Cui Jing saw this and spat, “Pfft, that kid so good at pretending. If it wasn’t for this kid, I could have taken this Heavenly Region with 15 pills!”

Cheng Qing also said, “I’m going to teach this kid a lesson sooner or later. He almost embarrassed me back then.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and said, “Alright, let’s focus on the auction. Did you carefully select the items to be auctioned?”

Chun Qiu nodded. “There are a total of 60 items. Among them, there are 20 Emperor-grade pills. The rest of the items are treasures that I picked out that are not too valuable.”

“We have many pills. If some sects in the Heavenly Region have bad intentions…” Jian Wushuang was a little worried.

Chun Qiu smiled. “Don’t worry, Brother Jian. I’ve already settled everything. I’ve unintentionally involved our auction house with the Young Emperor. Even if the other sects are eyeing us, they’ll have to think twice.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and did not say anything else. He understood what Chun Qiu meant. It was fake that the Young Emperor was involved, but it was true that he was using his name.

The sudden establishment of this auction house with a strong foundation seemed to be related to the Prince of Zhen Wuyang.

As the sounds of discussion gradually died down, a woman with a beautiful face and figure, surrounded by dense and powerful aura, walked to the center of the hall.

“These women I found are all candidates for Fairy Maidens of the Heavenly Court. They are all first-class in their work,” Cheng Qing said proudly.

Following that, just as Cheng Qing had said, the Fairy gave a concise yet full opening speech, completely raising the atmosphere of the entire auction house.

“Ladies and gentlemen, today’s first item is the Six Fate Pill. It has a lot of wonderful effects. It can help the owner to understand the Great Dao in a specific Heavenly Region Plane. However, you must remember that this pill is not for consumption. You have to wear it on your body.”

“The starting price of this Six Fate Pill is 60,000 Black Mountain Crystals. Of course, you can also use Heaven Crystals. The starting price is 60 million Heaven Crystals.”

As the Fairy’s voice fell, a pill with six-colored flowing shadows suspended in the air. Even through the crystal jade box, it seemed to exude a medicinal fragrance.

In Jian Wushuang’s eyes, the so-called Six Fate Pill was of little value. However, for ordinary top cultivators or Yan Immortals, it was a treasure that could only be found by chance! Furthermore, it was not a one-time use treasure, and it could be passed down, increasing its value by several levels.

Immediately after, the sounds of people fighting to be the first to bid rang out.

“60 million Heaven Crystals!”

“70 million Heaven Crystals!”

“90 million Heaven Crystals!”

Each bid was higher than the last, and the price was soon raised to almost 500 million Heaven Crystals!

Jian Wushuang also noticed some problems.

That’s right, these Yan Immortals only used Heaven Crystals, none of them used Black Mountain Crystals.

Perhaps seeing the confusion in Jian Wushuang’s eyes, Chun Qiu quickly explained, “For these Heavenly Sects, Black Mountain Crystals is a kind of cultivation resource. The purity of the derivative skill stored in it is not comparable to Heaven Crystal.”

“Besides, the Heaven Crystal is produced in large quantities. There are impurities in it, so it can be found in almost every Heavenly Region. The Black Mountain Crystal is only found in Prince Yan’s Lower Three Heavens, so the value of the two can’t be compared.”

“To put it simply, the Black Mountain Crystal is a cultivation resource, while Heaven Crystal is considered a common currency. It’s not valuable at all, so they only use Heaven Crystal when bidding.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and understood.

At this moment, the Six Fate Pill was finally sold for 1.3 billion Heaven Crystals.

After the first pill was handed over, the other treasures followed.

These precious treasures were usually hard to come by, but in the unrivaled ancient auction house, they were displayed so quickly that one only had to pay Heaven Crystals to get them!

This was a great benefit!

In an instant, all the Yan Immortals and top cultivators in the hall were bidding with all their might, trying to bring back a Supreme Treasure.

After knowing that all the items were selected by Chun Qiu and the others, Jian Wushuang lost interest.

However, very quickly, under the somewhat crazed atmosphere, the auction moved on to the 20th item. A Fairy ascended to the third level and came in front of Chun Qiu.

“Master Chun, just now a Yan immortal came to visit and offered a treasure for us to bid for, and we can split the commission 50 – 50.”

“There’s such a good thing?” Cheng Qing could not help but ask. “What kind of treasure is it?”

The Fairy looked up and recalled for a moment before saying, “It seems to be a jade head? I can’t see it clearly.”

“Sure, after you confirm the item, you can decide on your own.” Chun Qiu nodded. “By the way, where is that Yan Immortal now? ”

“It’s just below.” the Fairy said as she pointed downwards.

However, there were almost a thousand Yan Immortals and top cultivators sitting below, so he could not tell which one it was. Thus, Chun Qiu only glanced at it and let it go.

When another supreme-grade pill was sold at the price of 6 billion Heaven Crystals, the Fairy in charge of hosting the auction presented a round object wrapped in black cloth.

The huge auction house suddenly quieted down as all the Yan Immortals focused on the item.

The Fairy was obviously told to bid for this item at the last minute. After a moment’s pause, she said, “Uh, this item is also a Supreme Treasure, but it seems that no one has told us about its effects. It should be a very good Supreme Treasure.”

After saying that, she reached out and lifted the black cloth on the round object.

Immediately, a jade-like head with medium-length hair and closed eyes appeared in front of every Yan immortal’s eyes.

This was a head that was sculpted from some kind of warm jade. Other than being extremely lifelike, it was likely that there was no trace of a treasure at all.

“This item is a special item. Only Black Mountain Crystals can be used to bid for it. The starting price is 60,000 Black Mountain Crystals.

“…”

The huge hall fell into an inexplicable silence. After a while, soft boos sounded one after another. All the Yan Immortals booed.

For this treasure auction that was at its peak, the appearance of this useless jade head was like rat sh*t, ruining the appetites of all the Yan Immortals and top cultivators.

There were even some Yan Immortals sent by sects who began to doubt if the next auction item would be as valuable as before.
