Chapter 3679: Space-Time Reversal

“Space-time reversal?”

Wang Yuan blinked and asked, “Third brother, do you know this move too?”

“Well...” Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly. “Space-time reversal requires a high level of understanding and application of the principles of space-time. Even in the entire divine origin world, only the Temporal Temple Master can perform it. As for me, although I have completely comprehended the rules of space-time, I’m still a little lacking in the application of the rules of space-time.”

“Slightly weaker?”Wang Yuan and Su Rou’s expressions changed.

“Don’t worry, listen to Me First.”Jian Wushuang smiled, “If we were in the Divine Beginning Realm, even with the help of a time-space treasure, it would be difficult for me to reverse time and space. Naturally, I wouldn’t be able to revive second brother and the others. However, this is not the Divine Beginning Realm, but the Eternal Chaotic World!”

“In this world, the Heavenly Dao operating principles are far less powerful than those in the Divine Beginning Realm, and the restrictions are naturally not as high. Furthermore, I have already completely refined this world, and even the Heavenly Dao is within my control. In this place, with the support of the will of the entire Heavenly Dao, even if I am still lacking in the use of the laws of space-time, I should be able to reverse space-time.”

“If that’s the case, what are you waiting for? Hurry up and use it,”Wang Yuan said impatiently.

Jian Wushuang did not delay. He directly activated the will of the Heavenly Dao in the Eternal Chaotic World, followed by a buzz

A majestic power of space-time principles surged out of Jian Wushuang’s body. This power of space-time principles was obviously much stronger than before under the support of the will of the Heavenly Dao. Under the guidance of Jian Wushuang’s will, this power of space-time principles completely covered the void in front of him.

“Space-time...reverse!”

Jian Wushuang pointed his right hand in the distance.

Immediately, the space-time in front of him began to change rapidly.

The space-time that was originally flowing normally began to reverse under Jian Wushuang’s guidance!

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

As the space-time reversed, a large number of images of the void appeared in front of Jian Wushuang one by one, and they flowed wildly at a terrifying speed.

The speed of the space-time reversal also became faster and faster.

A moment later, the space-time in the void had returned to thousands of years ago, and it was finally fixed on a picture.

That picture was the scene where the 13 blood demon gods, who were controlled by Dao Yuanzi, rushed into the Imperial City and started a massacre. They also fought with Yang Zaixuan, Ruler Xiao, and the Tang Ruler.

In that battle, Yang Zaixuan, Ruler Xiao, and the Tang Ruler were killed by the 13 blood demon gods without any resistance.

Jian Wushuang did not personally experience that battle, but now he saw the complete scene in the long river of time.

Wang Yuan and Su Rou also saw it.

“Second brother, it’s second brother,” Wang Yuan immediately cried out in surprise, “And Ruler Xiao and the others are all there.”

Jian Wushuang’s expression was extremely solemn. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

He had thought that with his current use of the power of time and space and the support of the Heavenly Dao will of this world, it should be relatively easy for him to reverse time and space. However, in fact, it was not easy at all. On the contrary, it was extremely difficult, in particular, controlling the flow of time consumed too much of his divine power.

It was no wonder that even the Temporal Temple Master would not easily reverse time and space. The price was simply too high.

In particular, to resurrect some dead people from the past, the price was even more arrogant. Even one of the Temporal Temple Master’s favorite personal disciples had only been able to reverse time and space once…after his disciple died again, he did not use it a second time.

Because once Tang Ruler reversed time and space and resurrected the past, the backlash in the river of time would definitely cause him unprecedented damage.

Fortunately, Jian Wushuang had a perfect life, so his endurance was much stronger than Tang Ruler’s, so he could bear the price.

“Freeze!”

“Freeze!”

“Freeze!”

Jian Wushuang exhaled three words in one breath. In the picture in front of him, three figures slowly walked out of the picture under his influence.

Buzz, buzz, buzz!

The river of time disappeared, and the space-time in front of him returned to normal again.

The difference was that there were three more figures in the void besides Jian Wushuang, Wang Yuan, and Su Rou.

The three figures were Yang Zaixuan, Ruler Xiao, and Tang Ruler.

Yang Zaixuan was Jian Wushuang’s life-and-death brother, Ruler Xiao was a great benefactor to Jian Wushuang, and he was Leng Rushuang’s father. As for Tang Ruler, he was also very close to Jian Wushuang, so Jian Wushuang…resurrected all three of them in one breath.

However, after resurrecting, Jian Wushuang found that he had used up more than 80% of his divine power to resist the backlash of the river of time.

He had used up 80% of his divine power in one breath.

This was because he had a perfect life, abundant divine power, and a stronger endurance.

If an ordinary Ruler forcefully resurrected these three people from the river of time, they would probably be killed by the backlash of the river of time.

“Where...where am I?”

“Aren’t we already dead? Why do we seem to be alive now?”

“Is this still the Tang of the east or the Green Fire World?”

The resurrected Yang Zaixuan, Ruler Xiao, and the Tang Ruler were at a loss.

Although Jian Wushuang had forcefully resurrected them from the river of time, their memories were still intact. They knew that they had died and had been killed by the 13-blood demon god, therefore, they could not accept the fact that their consciousness had returned to this place.

They were still in a state of shock, but Wang Yuan and Su Rou had already lost control of themselves.

“Haha, second brother!”

“Second brother!”

Wang Yuan and Su Rou had already rushed up. Even Jian Wushuang appeared beside Yang Zaixuan in a flash.

“Second brother, long time no see.” Jian Wushuang directly grabbed Yang Zaixuan’s shoulder.

“Third brother, Wang Yuan, and fourth brother? It’s you guys...” Yang Zaixuan was still in a daze.

Jian Wushuang did not explain too much to Yang Zaixuan. Instead, he walked toward Ruler Xiao and the Tang Ruler.

“Uncle Xiao, Senior Tang Ruler, welcome back,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Jian Wushuang...”

“What the hell is going on?”

Ruler Xiao and the Tang Ruler immediately recognized Jian Wushuang when they saw him, but their expressions were still very strange.

Half a day later, Yang Zaixuan, Ruler Xiao, and Tang Ruler finally understood what had happened. At the same time, they also knew that they were indeed dead, and they had been dead for tens of millions of years. But now…Jian Wushuang had forcibly resurrected them with great magic power.
