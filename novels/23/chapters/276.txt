Chapter 277: The Killing Begins

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang slowly walked down the street, leaving piles of corpses behind him.

The warriors who had been watching the fighting along street were horrified, including members of the Bloodseeker Gang.

They thought that as soon as Jian Wushuang left Bloodmoon Hotel, he would die. But now...

The Sixth Leader of the Hungry Wolf Gang, an expert in the Peak of the Yang Void Realm, was killed.

“The Hungry Wolf Gang...?” Jian Wushuang slowly moved on while repeating the name in his heart.?“There are six experts in the Peak of the Yang Void Realm in this gang, but none of them is on the Bloodmoon List. They are not a threat to me.”

“Now that they provoked me, I don’t mind wiping them out here and now.”

“Since I just arrived in the Tang Dynasty, I’ll take the Hungry Wolf Gang as my first target.”

The night witnessed a horrible scene in a large courtyard in the center of Devil Heart City, which was also the Hungry Wolf Gang’s lair.

Several corpses lay on the ground in the courtyard, and among them was the tall man who had been killed by Jian Wushuang.

“The young man is in his early twenties and only in the Initial Yang Void Realm, but he has killed so many experts of our gang and even killed sixth brother,” a stout man with tanned skin and brown hair said, staring down at the corpses. His eyes were grim and cold.

“He is so young yet so powerful. He must be a talented disciple of those old sects, a real genius. Nevertheless, no matter what background he has, it won’t help him in the Tang Dynasty.”

“How dare he kill sixth bro...”

“Find him right now! Get him and kill him even if you turn the city upside down,” shouted the brown-haired man.

“Yes, sir,” the members of the gang responded immediately.

“No need to find me.” An emotionless voice echoed in the yard, and with the sound appeared a figure in black.

“I’m the one you’re looking for.” Jian Wushuang gazed at the experts of the Hungry Wolf Gang with his cold voice echoing across the whole yard. “From today on, there will be no Hungry Wolf Gang.”

“How arrogant. Kill him!” The brown-haired man roared. The other experts of the Hungry Wolf Gang immediately leaped toward Jian Wushuang like real wolves.

Jian Wushuang squinted at those experts, the Triple-kill Sword trembling feverishly in his hand.

“The killing begins.”

...

While Jian Wushuang was fighting with the experts of the Hungry Wolf Gang, two figures passed by the top of the Void above them. They looked very strong and happened to be passing by Devil Heart City.

Just as soon as they arrived, they were immediately attracted by the fighting.

They looked down, observing the fighting below.

But in their eyes, it was more like a slaughter than a fight.

They saw a young man in black, who was bursting with an overwhelming killing intent under the siege of many warriors. With the flashes of the sword sweeping out, the man killed one Hungry Wolf Gang expert every time the sword flashed.

The two figures slowed down involuntarily. One of them was a demonic youth in a purple robe. When he gazed at the slaughtering below, a bloodthirsty smile appeared on his face. But the other one looked indifferent.

“How interesting! This young man is just in the Initial Yang Void Realm, but he killed so many experts under siege. Not only that, there are five experts in the Peak of Yang Void Realm among his opponents!” the purple-robed youth said with excitement.

“Even if it’s us that were being attacked by so many experts, we couldn’t be as calm as him. He is very powerful,” said the emotionless man in a low voice.

“You’re right.” The youth nodded with a strong fighting desire in his eyes. “I’d love to fight with him.”

The people in the Tang Dynasty were so crazy about killing, and many of them were lunatics keen for battle.

This purple-robed youth was one of them.

The slaughter in the courtyard was drawing to an end.

Jian Wushuang’s killing intent filled the air. His black clothes turned red with blood, and around him lay dense corpses.

The Hungry Wolf Gang possessed many experts, but it was exterminated by Jian Wushuang in a short while. Even the chiefs of the gang and the several experts at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm were also killed by him.

Jian Wushuang showed no mercy to these people.

He once experienced the test of the Illusory Realm of Slaughter in his Ancestor’s Land. That slaughter was much more frenzied than this one, but he still persevered in his way of killing. As for these people, none of them was innocent as many lives had been lost at their hands during their adventure and killing. Thus, Jian Wushuang felt no guilt about killing them.

“You two have been watching for so long. It’s time to come out,” Jian Wushuang suddenly raised his head up and said.

The two men above the Void dived down and showed up in front of Jian Wushuang.

They had both reached the Peak of the Yang Void Realm, and the Killing Intent of the purple-robed demonic youth was particularly strong.

“It’s very powerful of you to destroy a gang all by yourself, especially one under the charge of several experts at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm,” said the purple-robed youth with a smile.

“Just so-so. What do you want from me?” Jian Wushuang asked impassively.

“Haha, it’s hard to come across an expert like you who’s strong enough to be listed in the Bloodmoon List. I can’t let you go before we have a fight,” said the purple-robed youth with a grin.

“Oh?” Squinting his eyes, Jian Wushuang was not surprised.

There were so many crazy people in the Tang Dynasty that it was normal for a warlike man to challenge an expert he met.

After finishing his speech, the purple-robed youth rushed toward Jian Wushuang like a purple thunderbolt.

Just in a moment, the thunderbolt crossed over 30 meters and came up close to Jian Wushuang, cracking the Void in front of him and revealing a Stone Cudgel surrounded with Thunderbolt power.

“Boom! Boom!” The power kept surging and rushing.

“So fast!”

Jian Wushuang was shocked, but he retreated quickly the moment the Stone Cudgel chopped toward him.

The cudgel eventually smashed the Void. Seeing this, the purple-robed youth smiled grimly, and in an instant, a giant thunder dragon came out of the cudgel and dashed toward Jian Wushuang roaring.

“Oh?”?Jian Wushuang’s heart pounded.

He was quite amazed at the purple-robed youth’s strength.

“Though he hasn’t comprehended the Origin, he is very excellent in comprehending the Thunderbolt Essence. What’s more, his Cultivation Method and skills not only are quite superb, but also performed with Thunderbolt power. Thus, he is absolutely as strong as the experts who had comprehended the Origin and were in the Peak of the Yang Void Realm.”

Jian Wushuang looked grim. He drew back hastily, but the dragon kept chasing him.
