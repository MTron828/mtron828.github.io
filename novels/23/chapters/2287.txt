Chapter 2288 Help Me

“Are these the only people from the Seven Star Black Sect who managed to awaken?” Emperor Thirteen looked at the eight people indifferently.Too many experts died during the Great Battle of the Ancient Past. Even Divine Punishment Elders and the Seven Stars.

Not many people survived. All of these experts went into slumber over the aeons. Many died in their sleep, while others found it difficult to awaken. There were only a few people who heard Xuan Yi, awakened and rushed over.

“There is one more. He should be here soon,” Xuan Yi said.

As he finished speaking, another gigantic crack appeared in the dark space in front of him.

The crack in spacetime was much bigger than the eight before it. The power was even more terrifying.

Under the gaze of all of the experts present, a gigantic thing appeared from the crack.

It was trillions of feet long and its body was covered in golden scales. It had a gigantic dragon head.

Dragon Turtle, it was a gigantic Golden Dragon Turtle!

If Jian Wushuang was there, he would definitely have recognized it. This Golden Dragon Turtle that was trillions of feet long was Long Qi, who he had met in the Eighth Lair!

While everyone was amazed about its size when Long Qi appeared on this battlefield, they also noticed a handsome man who was stood on Long Qi’s back.

When the Divine Punishment Elders saw the man, their faces were painted with respect.

As for the three Masters of the Holy Land and Bing Shan, they were in disbelief.

“Xuan Yan!”

The three Masters of the Holy Land stared right at the man who had just appeared solemnly.

“Divine Punishment Palace Master, it is the Divine Punishment Palace Master from the Seven Star Black Sect!”

“Oh my god! It’s him?”

“This is a real Master of the Holy Land. Reportedly, he is of equal standing with the Seven Star Sect Master. He is alive?”

The experts from the ancient past trembled in fear when they recognized the handsome man.

The Seven Star Black Sect was the most powerful overlord in the Absolute Beginning Divine World. Even the Three Big Holy Lands could not match him.

There were numerous top-tier experts within the Seven Star Black Sect.

Anyone part of the Seven Stars or the Divine Punishment Palace could run amok within the Absolute Beginning Divine World without worry.

They had two Masters of the Holy Land.

The first man was the Sect Master of the Seven Star Black Sect. He was an incredibly old and powerful man.

The second was the Palace Master of the Divine Punishment Palace, Xuan Yan!

These two were in the realm of Master of the Holy Land. There were people like Emperor Thirteen who had the fighting power of a Master of the Holy Land, but his realm was not there yet.

As for Xuan Yi, he was a special case.

He was so special and unique that no one knew what realm he was truly in.

No one knew if he was part of the Seven Star Black Sect.

Back in the ancient past, when the Seven Star Black Sect had been at its prime, Divine Punishment Palace Master Xuan Yan had been there!

Now Xuan Yan had awakened and stood before everyone on top of the Golden Dragon Turtle.

Many people held their breaths.

“Greetings, Palace Master!”

“Greetings, Divine Punishment Palace Master!”

The experts from the Seven Star Black Sect who were present, such as the Divine Punishment Elders and the experts who were part of the Seven Stars, greeted him.

Even the leader of the Seven Stars, Emperor Thirteen, greeted him with respect.

The beautiful man who stood on top of the Golden Dragon Turtle looked down and scanned the crowd. His eyes looked as though they contained trillions of stars.

He nodded his head at the Divine Punishment Elders and the Seven Stars. Soon, he locked his vision on one man.

The man who he locked his vision onto was Xuan Yi!

“Xuan Yi!!!”

The handsome man with black hair looked at Xuan Yi codly, rage burning in his eyes.

Anger!

Xuan Yan was extremely furious.

Xuan Yi was the reason why he was so furious!

“Xuan Yan, it has been a long time.” Xuan Yi smiled lightly and gently. The overbearing aura Xuan Yi had had was gone.

It was the same gentleness he had when he spoke to Jian Wushuang.

“You dare to appear in front of me? You have the guts to awaken me?” Xuan Yan clenched his fists. It was as though he was about to explode in rage.

The experts present felt odd when they saw this scene.

They were curious: wasn’t Xuan Yi part of the Seven Star Black Sect? Then why did the Divine Punishment Palace Master Xuan Yan look like he hated him so much and seem as though he was about to kill him?

Shouldn’t they be on the same side?

The three Masters of the Holy Land watched everything unfold coldly.

The three Masters of the Holy Land knew the reason behind the great battle. They understood why Xuan Yan would be enraged and seem to hate Xuan Yi so much when he saw him

“Xuan Yan, I know you still blame me for that great battle. You created the Seven Star Black Sect with Xuan Yu over many aeons and through great effort. You made this sect become the overlord of the Absolute Beginning Divine World. However, the Seven Star Black Sect took an unprecedented and disastrous hit because of me.”

“I understand that you are angry. However, no matter how much you hate me or complain about me, it has already happened. I am trying to fix everything. Hence...”

He stopped before he looked into Xuan Yan’s eyes and said, “The reason why I woke you from your sleep is because I need the help of you and every other expert here to send this little one into Samsara!”

“Please help me!”

Xuan Yi then bowed down to Xuan Yan and the experts from the Seven Star Black Sect.

After he bowed down, he remained in that posture.

In front of Xuan Yi, Xuan Yan and the other eight top tier experts from the Seven Star Black Sect knitted their eyebrows tightly and fell silent.

They knew who Xuan Yi was and how incredible his techniques and fighting powers were.

Without a doubt, he was an extraordinary expert.

He could battle the Heavens, the Earth and all sentient beings. He had never bowed down to or begged anyone before.

Today, however, he had bowed down to them in front of numerous experts from the ancient past and requested their help.

They have never thought that Xuan Yi could put down his pride. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Even Xuan Yan was caught by surprise.
