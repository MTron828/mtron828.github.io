Chapter 565: The Evacuation!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Ji looked grave.

“I have to kill him now!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

He roared towards the sky in his monster voice.

The very next moment, his body began to bulge, growing from two meters to over ten meters. At the same time, his appearance changed as well, becoming more fierce.

He transformed into a giant red bear with a ferocious aura in no time.

“He revealed his original form.”

Temple Master Iceberg, who was hiding outside of the Restriction, saw the sudden change, which caused his eyes to light up.

These monster spies had gone through a lot of effort to change their look into that of a human being’s, but the fact was, they were more powerful when in their original form.

“This Monster King’s power doubled when he transformed back into his original form. I can’t wait to see whether Jian Wushuang can still fight back against him or not.”?Temple Master Iceberg was full of expectation and had become impatient because he knew that Jian Wushuang’s allies would arrive soon. Once that happened, he would lose his chance to kill Jian Wushuang.

“Howl...”

The bear howled and charged at Jian Wushuang like a moving mountain, with both of its huge paws punching towards Jian Wushuang in succession.

The bear’s huge body did not slow its speed at all. Palm after palm, it punched toward Jian Wushuang.

“Peng!”

Jian Wushuang could not dodge all of the attacks and finally got hit by one of them. He immediately felt as if he had been struck by a mountain. His blood began surging wildly inside him, and a trace of it even flowed from between his lips and dripped down his pale face.

“His power is terrifying!”?Jian Wushuang was shocked.?“Even with my strengthened body, I was still wounded. I’m afraid that taking three or four more palms would cost me my life.”

Jian Wushuang was in shock, but the monster spies were completely dumbfounded.

“How is that possible?”

“How could he manage to withstand my most powerful strike?”

“Is his body really that strong?”

The spies all felt frightened by the fact that Jian Wushuang had survived the Monster King’s powerful blow with just his body.

“Among the 33 Temple Masters, other than Temple Master Black Spirit, who has mastered the 11th Level of the Bone Fusion Technique, no one could match Jian Wushuang in physical defense,”?Ji growled silently.

Right then, he received a message from his Messaging Slip.

“Master Ji, Temple Master Black Feather and Temple Master Nine Sea are only a thousand miles away, so they will arrive here in 15 minutes.”

“They are so quick!” Ji was surprised.

From the moment they decided to kill Jian Wushuang, they had prepared for everything. It had been clear to them that Jian Wushuang would ask Human League for help and that Temple Master Black Feather and Temple Master Nine Sea, the nearest two from the Blood Moon Plain, might come. So, they had arranged some spies to watch the roads to the plain.

Ji made sure to know when the two Temple Masters would arrive.

As for Temple Master Iceberg, he had followed Jian Wushuang so cautiously that neither Jian Wushuang nor the monster spies had spotted him.

“15 minutes!”

Ji shot Jian Wushuang a ruthless glance.?“This is beyond my expectations. His body defense is so strong. Maybe I can kill in 15 minutes, but I probably can’t take his body with me. This is not what Crystal-armored Monster Emperor wants.”

Killing Jian Wushuang and taking back his body, as well as his Interspatial Ring, was what Ji had been told. Among them, the ring was the most important.

Ji was not sure that he could kill Jian Wushuang and take his body away in only 15 minutes.

“Our mission has failed. Let’s go.”

Ji quickly ordered. A moment later, his body began to shrink to the size of a normal human being’s. He gave up killing Jian Wushuang and began to turn away.

The other spies followed him without thinking.

“Did they give up on killing me?”?Jian Wushuang paused and felt relieved when he saw that the spies were planning to evacuate from the plain.

However, Temple Master Iceberg,?who was still in hiding, looked at the spies who were leaving with a grim expression.

“A group of trash!” Temple Master Iceberg cursed.

He had planned to seize Jian Wushuang’s Interspatial Ring after those spies killed him, so it never occurred to him that the spies would fail despite gathering together such a powerful force.

“It looks like I will have to kill Jian Wushuang myself.”?Temple Master Iceberg’s eyes took on a chilling look as he licked his lips.

“I may get in trouble after I kill him, but it doesn’t matter as long as I can get the compass. Moreover, I don’t believe the elders in the Monster-exterminating League will turn against me because of the death of an outsider.”

Having made up his mind, Temple Master Iceberg made his move.

Woosh!

A flowing light flashed across the sky. Then, Temple Master Iceberg appeared with a long gold spear in his hand. The spear sparkled with a formidable power behind it. Then, in the next moment, it easily cut through the Restriction on the plain.

This move fully demonstrated his power, because even if it was Jian Wushuang, it would take him a rather long time to break this Restriction that the spies went all out to set up.

Jian Wushuang and the spies both spotted Temple Master Iceberg at the same time.

“Damn, he is a Temple Master from the Human League.”

“Judging by his aura, he is Temple Master Iceberg.”

“Damn, why is he here?”

Ji and the other spies all looked glum.

Temple Master Iceberg was ranked in the top 3 among the Temple Masters in the Monster-exterminating League.

He could kill all the spies here on his own.

“Temple Master Iceberg?”

Jian Wushuang was surprised by Temple Master Iceberg’s sudden appearance.

He was just as confused by Temple Master Iceberg’s presence here as the spies were.

He was confused. “Why did Temple Master Iceberg arrive here before Temple Master Black Feather and Temple Master Nine Sea? Shouldn’t he still be in the Holy Place?”
