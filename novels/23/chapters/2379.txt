“Chaotic Realm?”

“How dare a fellow Chaotic Realm come to see Master Kun?”

The eyes of both Half-Step Divine Demon Realm guards were ablaze with fury.

‘What a joke, who does he think Master Kun is?’

He was the best Craft Master in Luogu Territory. Even a governor of nine cities was humbled before Master Kun.

Even super experts who lived like mysteries hidden in the darkness and had surpassed the Divine Demon Realm were happy to communicate with Master Kun on an equal footing.

How could anyone meet someone like Master Kun as they wish?

Under normal circumstances, even Second-Class Divine Demons or First-Class Divine Demons had to wait a long time to see him. At times, Master Kun would refuse to meet any of them. That was how Second-Class and First-Class Divine Demons were treated.

‘How could a Chaotic Realm come over so bluntly and ask to see Master Kun? How could he be so confident?’

“Leave!”

“Get out of here or you will be killed!”

The two guards shouted angrily, and their strong god power was released towards Jian Wushuang.

“Indeed...” Jian Wushuang, who was hiding under the bamboo hat gave a weird smile. He had guessed that it would not be so easy for him to meet Master Kun, so he came prepared.

At the mansion’s entrance, the two Half-Step Divine Demon Realm guards stood like two mountains, blocking Jian Wushuang’s path. They would kill Jian Wushuang without hesitation if he dared to take a step forward.

Jian Wushuang slowly stretched out a finger as his figure shook.

Before the two Half-Step Divine Demon Realm could react, Jian Wushuang was already back to his original place and state.

“Now, can you go and bring my message?” Jian Wushuang’s faint laughter came from under the bamboo hat.

Both Half-Step Divine Demon Realms were just about to get angry when they felt a tingling sensation on their cheeks. They stretched out their hands to touch their cheeks and felt blood.

In an instant, the two Half-Step Divine Demon Realm guards were terrified and cold sweat was dripping down their bodies.

There was a small sword mark on each of their cheeks. The sword pierced through their skin and blood was dripping out from their wound. The crux was that they did not notice when it happened at all.

‘Had Jian Wu Shuang not been merciful just then, are we dead now?’

The two Half-Step Divine Demon Realm guards became respectful towards Jian Wushuang immediately, there was a deep sense of horror in their eyes.

“Go tell Master Kun that I would like him to craft something extraordinary. If he refuses to see me, he would miss a big deal,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“Yes, Master. Please wait a moment, I will bring your message immediately.”

One of the black-armored guards immediately went into the mansion to deliver the message. The other person stood there trembling and did not dare to look straight at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly while standing there quietly and waiting patiently.

At the wide hall in the mansion, a bald elder in a black robe sat casually. Next to the bald elder was also a purple-robed middle-aged man.

The purple-robed middle-aged man had an extremely powerful aura, he was a First-Class Divine Demon. However, even with his high status, he was somewhat careful with his behavior before the bald elder.

Master Kun was only a Second-Class Divine Demon himself but he had a reputable social status. Hence, First-Class Divine Demons were inferior when facing him.

“Master Kun, please help me out with this matter,” said the purple-robed middle-aged man with a smile.

“Mr. Su can rest assured. Since this matter was personally ordered by the Governor of Eighth Jin City, I’ll go all out to work on it. I believe we can see results within twenty years,” said the bald elder who was Master Kun with a smile.

“Pleased to hear that, Master Kun. Here’s half of the deposit and the remaining half will be paid personally by the Governor when it is done.” The middle-aged man in purple robe handed over an Interspatial Ring.

Master Kun took it and simply tapped it as the grin on his face grew wider.

“Well, well, Mr. Su. This is the first time we’ve met each other, let’s have a drink today.”

Master Kun was chatting happily with the purple-robed middle-aged man when the black armored Half-Step Divine Demon Realm guard walked in.

“Master.” The black-armored guard spoke respectfully.

“What’s the matter?” Master Kun looked down.

“A lone-ranger expert named Jian Yi came and asked to see you. He also said that he would like you to craft something extraordinary. If you refuse to see him, you would miss out on a big deal,” said the black-armored guard.

“Jian Yi?” Master Kun frowned upon hearing the name.

He had never come across an expert by the name of Jian Yi all those years that he lived in Luogu Territory.

“I have never heard of Jian Yi, not only within Luogu Territory but also the entire Wusha Wilderness. It seems like this person never existed.”

“Master, Jian Yi’s cultivation level is only at Middle Stage Chaotic Realm.” The black-armored guard explained.

“Chaotic Realm?” Master Kun’s face turned cold suddenly and he scolded, “You came all the way to deliver a message for a Chaotic Realm just because he asked to see me? Do you think I have a lot of free time?”

The black-armored guard was taken aback at the sudden change of atmosphere, but he continued immediately. “Master, I wasn’t going to deliver the message at the beginning, but this person is indeed someone unusual. Although he is only a Middle Stage Chaotic Realm, he managed to defeat me and another guard effortlessly. I believe he could’ve killed me and the other guard had he wanted to, yet we didn’t even realize what he did to us.”

This person is terrorizing.”

“Oh?” Master Kun’s face changed.

The purple-robed middle-aged man also looked surprised.

‘A Chaotic Realm that defeated or could even kill two Half-Step Divine Demon Realms in an instant before both two Half-Step Divine Demon Realms could even respond to the attack?’

That Chaotic Realm...

“Are you sure that he is only a Middle Stage Chaotic Realm?” asked Master Kun with a frown.

“I’m sure. His divine power is indeed only at Middle Stage Chaotic Realm, and he had never shown a power stronger than that since the beginning, but his swordsmanship and his command of laws were exceptional. It was a skill beyond the Chaotic Realm and even surpassed the Divine Demon Realm. Therefore, I don’t think that he is someone ordinary, so I came in and told you,” answered the black-armored guard solemnly.

“Is that so?” Master Kun slightly nodded as his anger disappeared.

“Master Kun, if this guard is telling the truth, I am 80 percent certain that person out there must be a top genius. Although he claims to be a lone ranger, he may be a super genius from some top sects or he could have an old monster master. It’s worth meeting a person like him,” said the purple-robed middle-aged man.

“Hmm.” Master Kun nodded as he thought so too.

“Go and get him.”
