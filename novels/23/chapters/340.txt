Chapter 341: Blood Soul Mark

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Wine Master walked towards Jian Wushuang and the others.

“Swordsman, my little friend, you’ve really impressed me today,” Wine Master smiled and said.

“Swordsman, I really admire what you’ve done,” Lady Black also looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Third brother,” there was a hint of happiness on both Wang Yuan and Yang Zaixuan’s faces.

Even they didn’t expect too much from Jian Wushuang when the seven experts of the Saint Realm joined the battle, but...

Jian Wushuang just smiled slightly, looked at Wine Master, and asked, “Do you know about this mark, Wine Master?”

“I know what it is,” Wine Master said and nodded, but his face looked serious as he continued, “that’s a unique trick of Holy Emperor Palace, the Blood Soul Mark.”

“The Blood Soul Mark is more like a curse.”

“A curse?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“It’s almost the same as a curse, but the Blood Soul Mark will not hurt you directly. It has only one purpose, which is to make sure you have nowhere to hide!” Wine Master explained to him.

“Once you’ve been cursed with the Blood Soul Mark, it will consistently release a formless power that any expert who has mastered the Blood Soul Mark will be able to sense your location easily!”

Jian Wushuang’s face changed.

“So, you mean Holy Emperor Palace can easily track down third brother?” Yang Zaixuan promptly asked.

“Yes.”

Wine Master nodded his head seriously and continued, “The Blood Soul Mark is designed for hunting or revenge. So, many people in Holy Emperor Palace have cultivated the skill.”

“Those experts use it when they meet danger outside. When they are about to be killed by someone, they will use the skill to cast the Blood Soul Mark on the enemy, and then the other experts in Holy Emperor Palace will find the enemy and kill him! It really is a special skill!”

“Mo Yun knew that he would die. Therefore, he cast the Blood Soul Mark on you when he was dying so that the experts in Holy Emperor Palace will be able to track you down and take revenge.”

“Master, can the Blood Soul Mark be erased?” Yang Zaixuan furrowed his eyebrows and asked.

“It can be erased,” Wine Master nodded, but then signed and said, “It is easy to get rid of it. The Blood Soul Mark can be erased by simply using Spiritual Power, but this method takes a long time. Under normal circumstances, it would take at least one month to remove it completely.”

“A month?” Yang Zaixuan’s eyes darkened and he said, “Holy Emperor Palace will have tracked him down within a month.”

“Indeed. So, Swordsman, my little friend, you are in big trouble this time,” Wine Master said solemnly.

“Big trouble?” Jian Wushuang agreed secretly.

He knew that, since he was cursed with the Blood Soul Mark, Holy Emperor Palace would be able to find him without a hitch.

Holy Emperor Palace’s wish to kill him was abundantly clear. Moreover, Jian Wushuang killed seven of their Saint Realm experts, so once Holy Emperor Palace heard the news, it would not leave him any chance to survive.

In fact, it was because Holy Emperor Palace knew so little about Juan Wushuang’s strength that they lost these seven Saint Realm experts.

However, the next time Holy Emperor Palace took action, it would be totally different.

“Third brother, what are you planning to do?” Wang Yuan and Yang Zaixuan looked at Jian Wushuang.

“What can I do? They will chase me down and overpower me with numbers,” Jian Wushuang said and smiled indifferently, “Let’s talk about that later. First, we should leave here and find a place where little sister can rest.”

“All right,” Wang Yuan and the others all nodded.

Then they began to walk away, exiting Ice Nether Valley.

There was an enormous amount of experts standing on the Drill Ground, including the experts from Ice Nether Valley, but none of them dared to block their path. They only stood there silently and watched them leave.

The whole Drill Ground burst into an uproar as soon as Jian Wushuang and his companions were gone.

“He left. That monster finally left!”

“So terrifying! A person at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm actually killed the seven Saint Realm experts from Holy Emperor Palace!”

“Incredible!”

“Ha-ha, Holy Emperor Palace suffered a great loss this time. Seven Saint Realm experts! And they all mastered Domain. Even Holy Emperor Palace will be distressed.”

“It is not over yet! Mo Yun placed the Blood Soul Mark on Jian Wushuang, so he can not escape for at least one month. Holy Emperor Palace will definitely try to kill him again.”

“But, they sent seven Saint Realm experts this time. Since they were all killed by Jian Wushuang, who will Holy Emperor Palace send to kill him next time?”

“As far as I’m concerned, Jian Wushuang’s strength has already reached the pinnacle of the Saint Realm. Normal Saint Realm experts, even those who have mastered Domain, will not be a threat to him. If Holy Emperor Palace wishes to kill him, they will have to get some Holy Masters to do it!”

“Holy Masters?”

“The Four Holy Masters of Holy Emperor Palace?”

“Wow, those four old monsters. I’m really looking forward to it.”

The whole Drill Ground was in chaos as all the experts were busy talking and analyzing the situation. Their conversations were all about Jian Wushuang and Holy Emperor Palace, while few of them cared about Ice Nether Valley anymore.

Compared to Jian Wushuang killing the seven Saint Realm experts of Holy Emperor Palace by himself, the death of Ye Chen in Ice Nether Valley was not an issue.

Those experts were all stunned and filled with expectations for what would happen in the future. Except?for one man in the crowd, who was extremely terrified.

That man was Nie Wuxin.

“That boy’s strength... So horrific!”

Nie Wuxin was still in shock as he kept mentally replaying the scene where Jian Wushuang killed the seven Saint Realm experts.

He had just had some conflicts with Jian Wushuang last night!

He even tried to force Juan Wushuang into giving him the leaf from the World Tree. He had paid no attention to Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei, but what he saw today at the Drill Ground scared him to death.

His nerves were on edge, worrying that Jian Wushuang would kill him directly. Only when Jian Wushuang was finally gone did he manage to catch his breath.

“Fortunately he didn’t notice me! He didn’t!”?Nie Wuxin was filled with fear after what happened, so he hastened the strong man with purple hair who was also still in a great shock and said, “Go. Let’s go back right now!”

Nie Wuxin didn’t want to stay in Ice Nether Valley any longer.

However, as he was leaving Ice Nether Valley, just as he had exited the gate, SHUA! A gloomy old figure blocked his path.

The old man was Chi Mei. He looked at Nie Wuxin with a hint of a cold smile on his face, “Master Wuxin? What a coincidence! Why are you in such a hurry? Where are you going?”

“I... I...”

Seeing Chi Mei in front of him, Nie Wuxin began to falter and he almost wet his pants in terror.

Even the strong man with purple hair next to him was frightened into a cold sweat.

“Hum, little bastard, I refrained from killing you because I was restrained by Swordsman, but now there is nothing standing in my way.”

Chi Mei’s voice was cold. Then, in and the next second, he abruptly took action.

In a mere flash, Nie Wuxin and the strong man with purple hair became two corpses.
