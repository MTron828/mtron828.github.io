Chapter 922: A Competition of Strength

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The experts in the stand nodded at Xia Yu’s words.

Indeed, wedding gifts was only one aspect of the Selection Ceremony. Strength mattered too.

Moreover, the wedding gifts was only an external factor, and did not speak for the ability of a person. Someone who was lucky and had no abilities could still obtain treasures that others couldn’t reach.

Many people felt that Jian Wushuang had probably lucky to get Bodhi Dan and Magic Weapon Pavilion.

In the Drill Ground, Xia Mang had recovered from his shock. A grimace remained on his face. As he glanced at Jian Wushuang, coldness emerged in his eyes.

“Jian Wushuang, I have no idea how you got the Magic Weapon Pavilion, the strength and talent competition is next. This totally depends on personal strength. I shall see how you can compete with me!”

Xia Mang had utmost confidence in his strength.

He was recognized as the first genius in the Eternal World.

He was fully deserving of the title of first Eternal Realm expert in the Eternal World.

Over the years, many strong Eternal Realm experts had challenged him but lost.

Without a doubt, the strength competition was totally different from the wedding gifts competition.

From his seat in the middle of the stand, Emperor Leng looked down. “The strength and talent competition is next. As for the competition rules…”

Before Emperor Leng had finished his sentence, Dongyan Chong from Dongyan Clan in the Drill Ground took the lead. He stood outside and said respectfully, “Emperor Leng, the strength competition need not be so troublesome.”

“Oh?” Emperor Leng glanced at Dongyan Chong.

Dongyan Chong continued gravely, “as we all know, Xia Mang is well-known as the first Eternal Realm?expert in the Eternal World, and also the first genius. In terms of strength, he should be the strongest. Since this Selection Ceremony aims to select the strongest person, there is no need to waste time.”

“If anyone of us has doubts about Xia Mang’s strength, just challenge him. Anyone who defeats him wins the competition. I know very well that I can’t beat Xia Mang, so for this round of competition, I will just give up.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Many people around Dongyan Chong shared his sentiments.

Unlike the first round competition on wedding gifts, no suspense existed for for the second round competition on strength.

It was widely recognized that Xia Mang was the first Eternal Realm expert in the Eternal World. Even other geniuses with extraodinary strength not on the same level as him.

“What do you think, Xia Mang?” Emperor Leng said as he looked down.

“I don’t mind.” Xia Mang laughed.

“How about you?” Emperor Leng looked at Jian Wushuang, Ku Yi and others. They nodded their assent.

“So that’s it. If anyone of you has any doubts about Xia Mang’ strength, just challenge him. If not, we’ll take it that you have given up.” Emperor Leng said.

As Emperor Leng finished his words,?all the geniuses, apart from Jian Wushuang, looked in Xia Mang’s direction.

Like Dongyan Chong, more than half of them had no intention of challenging Xia Mang. The rest of them were hesitant.

Finally, a long-haired man with a saber stepped out.

This long-haired man was the personal disciple of Deep Sea Palace Master, Li Tianchou!

Li Tianchou appeared in front of Xia Mang with a cold and indifferent face and shocking killing intent.

“I have long heard that Master Mubai of Xia Clan is the first Eternal Realm in the Eternal World. It is a pity that we had no chance to meet previously. Since we have that opportunity today, we should have a good fight. Besides, since I set foot on the sixth steps of Eternal Realm thousands of years ago, I have come encountered many Eternal Realm top experts but never lost a fight. Let’s see if I’m defeated today.” Li Tianchou said coldly.

“As you wish.” Xia Mang said with a slight smile. There was absolute confidence in his words and behaviour.” Just go ahead.”

“Humph!”

Li Tianchou was very decisive.?With a cold snort, he started to attack.

With a rapid wraith-like move, he leapt forward. The void before Xia Mang was suddenly broken and a strong wind swept over.

When Li Tianchou’s body appeared, the saber he had carried behind him appeared in his hand. Aggression emanated from him.

“Swish!”

A black saber shadow pierced forward.

Xia Mang had been standing quietly looking at at Li Tianchou’s slash. When the ghost-like saber shadow approached him, a faint smile showed on his lips. He slapped his hand in front of him.

This slap was as light as cloud and wind.

However, its impact had a horrible, earth-crushing power which forced Li Tianchou to retreat.

“What?”

Li Tianchou was shocked.

He had not expected his slash to be so easily blocked by Xia Mang. He stepped back, trembling.

“No wonder he is the first Eternal realm in the Eternal World. He is truly strong. In that case…”

Li Tianchou unleashed his full strength. A vast black fog surged violently upwards from his body and expanded to the surroundings. In a very short time, it had developed into a huge black ocean.

It covered most of Drill Ground and obscured Li Tianchou’s figure.

At the sight of this scene, the experts on the stand sighed. They turned and looked at a black-robed bearded old man who wore a cold expression on his face. This was Li Tianchou’s Master, the Deep Sea Palace Master.

“Deep Sea Palace Master, this disciple of yours is quite good. At such a young age, he has cultivated your unique secret skill to such a high level!”

“It seems that he has fully mastered Chapter One of Spiritual Sea Realm and carved out his own Dao. He is not far from being a Dao Master.”

“Deep Sea, congratulations on having such a good disciple.”

Unmoved by the praise showered on him, Deep Sea Palace Master responded with a cold snort. “My disciple’s strength is good, but compared with Xia Mang, he has a long way to go. I think that slap from Xia Mang has shown part of his own Dao.”

“And in my opinion, that should be Creation Level Dao, but it was not perfect.”
