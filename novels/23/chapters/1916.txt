Chapter 1917: Fighting Alone

Agreed?

Jian Wushuang had agreed to pass them the inheritance of the Secret Skill of Star Palace?

But the question was whether he really agreed, or was he was just putting them off?

“Sword Emperor, merely a verbal agreement, it’s useless. You could totally change your mind after this,” Emperor God Xiu Luo said in a low voice, “By then, you will have already taken care of the two alliances. Against Almighties Alliance alone, Lineage of Star could totally be fearless. We of Almighties Alliance could do nothing about you.”

“So, what do you want?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold.

“Very simple. I want you to pass us the inheritance of the Secret Skill of Star Palace now. Before this, I will ask Star Extermination Alliance and Supreme Ten Alliance to stop. Until you pass us the Secret Skill of Star Palace and we left, you can continue to fight. What do you think?” Emperor God Xiu Luo said.

“That’s a great idea but it’s a pity that Almighties Alliance thought it too well,” Jian Wushuang smirked and lifted his head to look at the expert of the Almighties Alliance. His gaze was extremely cold.

In his hand, Blood Mountain Sword quivered and the blade shot at Almighties Alliance directly.

“Listen, either Almighties Alliance leave now or… stay back entirely!”

The cold voice was heard from Jian Wushuang and it resounded through the entire galaxy.

Listening to what Jian Wushuang said, even the experts from Star Extermination Alliance and Supreme Ten Alliance had their eyes wide open and looked at Jian Wushuang in shock.

“He… what is he trying to do?”

“If Almighties Alliance doesn’t leave, he will make Almighties Alliance stay back entirely? Where did his courage come from?”

“Almighties Alliance is the strongest among the three alliances. The number of Almighties are more than a hundred of them.”

“Haha, Jian Wushuang is courting death!”

Almighties Alliance, over a hundred Almighties, their faces grew cold after hearing what Jian Wushuang said.

“Jian Wushuang, aren’t you too courageous?” Emperor God Xiu Luo grew grave.

“Emperor God Xiu Luo, as he is courting death, let’s fulfill his death wish. Let’s attack!” There was an Emperor God who said that next to him.

“Yes, with the Almighties’s power, in collaboration with Star Extermination Alliance and Supreme Ten Alliance, we can totally wipe out Lineage of Star. By then, the Secret Skill of Star Palace will still be ours!”

“Let’s attack!”

The experts from Almighties Alliance complemented.

There was a flash of decisiveness in Emperor God Xiu Luo’s eyes too. He had already made up his mind.

“It’s absolutely impossible for us to just leave like this,” Emperor God Xiu Luo’s loud and bright voice resounded across the battlefield.

“This is your decision?” Jian Wushuang’s face was cold as he glared at the experts from Almighties Alliance, “If so, don’t blame me. The people from Almighties Alliance have to die today!!!”

All have to die!!!

The remark instantly stirred an unprecedented commotion in the entire galaxy.

Everyone heard and they were terrified.

They couldn’t understand how was Jian Wushuang courageous enough to make such a remark in a situation like that.

Would Lineage of Star still have any other impressive trump card?

Just as everyone was confused, Jian Wushuang took a step forward slowly and walked in front of Almighties Alliance.

“He… what is he trying to do?”

No one knew what was happening when they saw the scene.

“It seems that he wants to match evenly with the entire Almighties Alliance with his power alone? Is he joking?”

“Fighting Alone?”

“Idiot. He thinks he is a Great Emperor? Or he thinks he was Master of Star Palace back then?”

Everyone was exclaiming in surprise.

However, Jian Wushuang didn’t stop his footsteps but got closer to Almighties Alliance gradually.

Almighties Alliance had a total of more than one hundred Almighties. There were over a hundred pairs of eyes that watched Jian Wushuang’s arrival. Although he did come alone, he struck fear into the Almighties when he walked to them with billowing aura.

They even got their alert up subconsciously.

“Would Jian Wushuang really have any other trump card?” Emperor God Xiu Luo started thinking about the possibility as well.

Just then, Jian Wushuang stopped moving.

About ten thousand miles away from the experts from Almighties Alliance, Jian Wushuang stopped in the void.

His eyes were cold without any emotion and he glanced at the experts from Almighties Alliance. He clenched Blood Mountain Sword tight in his hands and the sword was quivering vigorously.

Rumble. A terrifying sword intention swept out.

The sword intention was supreme!

It was like the reigning emperor of heaven and earth. Every living thing before it had to yield.

That was the sword intention that an Emperor, a Monarch possessed.

Jian Wushuang then was like the highest ruler in the universe.

The entire heaven and earth, the entire universe, all living things should yield to him.

The sword intention was too supernatural.

“This, this is…”

The Master of Emperor Sword Sect from Supreme Ten Alliance stared at Jian Wushuang with his eyes wide opened. To be exact, he was staring at the sword intention that was soaring from Jian Wushuang’s body.

As the Master of Emperor Sword Sect, he was naturally familiar with the sword intention of the supreme Emperor.

At the same time, he also realized the Sword Principle that Jian Wushuang was going to perform.

“Emperor Sword Principle!”

“This is Emperor Sword Sect’s strongest Emperor Sword Principle!”

“D*mn it. As expected, Jian Wushuang has comprehended Emperor Sword Principle and he already mastered it and is able to perform it!”

The Master of Emperor Sword Sect roared.

“Emperor Sword Principle?”

The experts on the scene were surprised.

Legend said that Emperor Sword Sect’s Emperor Sword Principle was from one of the superb experts from the first era, Sword Emperor Dugu.

Sword Emperor Dugu seemed to have gotten the Sword Principle from ancient times too. Because of the Sword Principle, Sword Emperor Dugu was able to remain in the top three among the experts in the first era. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The power of the Sword Principle was extraordinary.

However, it was obviously impossible to match evenly with over a hundred Sir Gods and Emperor Gods from Almighties Alliance with merely Emperor Sword Principle alone.

Jian Wushuang’s face was cold and Blood Mountain Sword was raised high.

Just like an Emperor who raised the Sword of Emperor.

Once it slashed, there would be thousands of heads being chopped.

There was a terrifying imposing sword aura that concentrated in the universe.

Just as the sword aura was going to be activated, there was boundless power of star that instantly swept out from Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s strongest trump card, the third volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace was triggered.

Jian Wushuang’s bloodshot eyes revealed boundless murderous intention.

“All of you share no resentment with Lineage of Star. But, too bad, you’re too greedy.”

“You shouldn’t have cast greedy eyes over the Secret Skill of Star Palace, nor should you have cornered Lineage of Star!”

“Now, for Lineage of Star, all of you… have to die!!!”
