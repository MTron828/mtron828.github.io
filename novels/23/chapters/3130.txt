Chapter 3131: Seal

——

The Heaven-cleaving Alliance was the number one Freedom Alliance recognized by the absolute beginning divine realm.

Seal the space and time around the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s secret lair?

This Long Lu could do it, but he did not have the guts to do it.

“What are you afraid of? It’s just sealing the space and time around it. It’s not like you’re going to attack the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s Mystic Realm directly. Even if the Heaven-cleaving Alliance is dissatisfied, you can say that you’re doing this because you want to kill a person who committed a heinous crime. After you kill that person, the space and time seal will naturally be lifted. The Heaven-cleaving Alliance won’t kill you in a rage,” Elder Xin Wu sent a message.

“But, but…” Long Lu was still hesitant.

“Humph, how dare you disobey my order?” Elder Xinwu’s voice was suddenly stunning.

Long Lu was stunned. He knew that Elder Xinwu was already very dissatisfied with him because of Chu Yixiao’s death. If he disobeyed Elder Xin Wu’s order at this time, he might very likely kill him directly.

Long Lu had no choice but to nod and agree.

In the void ahead, Jian Wushuang indeed headed toward the secret nest of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Not long after, the Mystic Realm appeared in front of him. Jian Wushuang did not hesitate and directly rushed into the nest.

“He really came to this Mystic Realm.” Long Lu’s face darkened, and then he immediately began to set up a magic array in the surrounding void.

In the lair, Jian Wushuang came to the counter.

“Hand in the task.”

Jian Wushuang took out his identity token.

A brown-haired elder at the counter looked up at Jian Wushuang, took the token, and nodded slightly.

Soon, the task was handed over. Jian Wushuang also received his reward and was about to turn around.

“Huh?”

The brown-haired old man’s face suddenly darkened. “How dare you!”

The brown-haired old man shouted in a low voice, but he had already rushed out.

In the void outside the Mystic Realm, Long Lu had finished setting up the magic array. The time and space around the Mystic Realm had been sealed. After being sealed, the people in the void could communicate with the outside world, however, the space passage could no longer be used.

Whoosh!

The brown-haired old man’s figure suddenly appeared in the void and appeared in front of Long Lu.

“Who are you? How dare you seal the space and time around the secret lair of our Heaven-cleaving Alliance?” The brown-haired old man shouted in a low voice.

Looking at the brown-haired old man, Long Lu was shocked. The aura emitted by the brown-haired old man had reached the level of a rank six True Saint, and it was at the peak of the rank six!

Taking a deep breath, Long Lu said humbly, “I am the Deacon of the Purple Cloud Pavilion, Long Lu. I have orders to seal this space-time temporarily.”

“Orders? Orders from the Purple Cloud Pavilion? Isn’t your Purple Cloud Pavilion a little too unscrupulous? You even dare to seal the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s lair directly!” The brown-haired old man’s voice was cold.

“No, no, my Purple Cloud Pavilion has no intention of going against the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. It’s just that we happened to be chasing after a little thief who just happened to escape here. In order to prevent him from escaping, we had no choice but to resort to this plan. As long as we find and kill that little thief, I will immediately remove the surrounding space-time blockade. Moreover, Elder Xin Wu of my Purple Cloud Pavilion is also rushing over right now. When the time comes, Elder Xin Wu will naturally apologize to the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s members personally.” Long Lu said.

“Heart shaman?” The brown-haired elder narrowed his eyes. He had been in the First Heaven for many years, so he knew all the experts in the First Heaven.

The heart shaman of the Purple Cloud Pavilion was definitely an expert, and he was not to be trifled with.

“What is the name of the person you are looking for?” The brown-haired elder asked.

“His name is Heavenly Sword Marquis, and he is a rank three True Saint,” Long Lu said.

Long Lu learned the name of Heavenly Sword Marquis from the third prince. The Third Prince had sent so many spies to serve the Sixth Prince, so it was not difficult for him to know Jian Wushuang’s name.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis…” The brown-haired elder narrowed his eyes slightly.

At this moment, he was in a single room in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s lair.

“My young friend, the people of the Purple Heaven Pavilion are looking for you. They have specially sealed the time and space so that the space passage in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s realm can not be used,” A white-robed man stood in front of Jian Wushuang and said with a faint smile.

“Sealed the space-time passage?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He knew that the Deacon of the Purple Heaven Pavilion had been following him, so the Purple Heaven Pavilion would certainly attack him. However, he did not expect that the people of the Purple Heaven Pavilion would be so bold as to seal the space-time passage where the secret lair of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance was located.

“I have reported what happened here to the higher-ups, but the higher-ups said that they would ask for your opinion. If you find it troublesome, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance will come out directly and send the people of the Purple Heaven Pavilion away. Of course, if the Heaven-cleaving Alliance does not want the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to come out, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance can completely ignore this matter and let you and the Purple Heaven Pavilion deal with it themselves,” the white-robed man said humbly.

The reason why he was humble was that he had just received an order from his superior.

How could someone from his superior ask for Jian Wushuang’s opinion?

Just this alone showed that Jian Wushuang’s identity was extraordinary.

“It’s better for me to solve the problem by myself. I won’t need the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s help for the time being,” Jian Wushuang said.

“In that case, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance will completely ignore this matter. Even if the Purple Heaven Pavilion seals time and space, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance will ignore it and let you solve everything yourself. Of course, even if the Heaven-cleaving Alliance doesn’t intervene, this is the Mystic Realm of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. No matter how bold the people of the Purple Heaven Pavilion are, they won’t dare to break into this place and attack. You can rest assured about this,” the white-robed man said.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

The white-robed man immediately took his leave.

After the white-robed man left, Jian Wushuang took out a message token. This message token belonged to Mo Shan.

Mo Shan already knew that he was in trouble, so he personally sent a message to him asking if he wanted the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to help him. Of course, Jian Wushuang refused.

But just as he refused Mo Shan, someone else immediately sent him a message.

This time, it was Jiu Luo who sent him a message!

Jiu Luo was also a friend of Jian Wushuang. They had talked about the communication token before.

“Brother Heaven Marquis, I heard that you are in trouble,” Jiu Luo said directly.

“How do you know?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“I didn’t know. It was Lord Bai Jue who told me,” Jiu Luo said.

“Lord Bai Jue?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lord Bai Jue, the Principles Master from the Dao Palace, had offered him a very attractive condition to join the Dao Palace.

“Lord Bai Jue knew that you were in trouble, but he didn’t have your communication token, so he found him and asked me to send you a message on his behalf.”
