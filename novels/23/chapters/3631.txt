Chapter 3632: Saint Star

“My young friend, it seems that you are very satisfied with this divine sword.” Daoist Xuan God looked at him.

“Yes, of course I am.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

What could he not be satisfied with?

“Although the Sky Roc Ruler gave me the Netherworld Divine Sword, he must be unwilling to accept it. After a little investigation, he will probably find out what happened in Star Palace. By then, he will know that we have set him up.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“That’s right, but it doesn’t matter. Master Sky Roc has lived for a long time. He’s not a fool. He knows your potential and that he can’t kill you. Therefore, even if he feels uncomfortable, he won’t come to deal with you openly. Unless one day you die, he may come to deal with Star Palace. However, if you die, there’s no point for Star Palace to exist,” Daoist Xuan God said.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly, but suddenly his expression changed. “By the way, the North Sea Palace is in the east of this territory, and if I remember correctly, the Earth Saint Star seems to be nearby.”

“Earth Saint Star? Why, are you going to the Earth Saint Star?” Daoist Xuan God asked.

Previously, Jian Wushuang had asked Axe One Master for information about the ice heart glazed jade, but Daoist Xuan God did not know about it.

“Earth Saint Star Master has a piece of ice heart glazed jade, which is very important to me. However, when I asked axe one to negotiate with him on behalf of Star Palace, he did not give Star Palace any face at all and casually dismissed Axe One,” Jian Wushuang said.

“If it’s something in the hands of Earth Saint Star Master, and he refused decisively before, it won’t be easy to get it from him again.” Daoist Xuan God narrowed his eyes.

“But I must get the icy-heart glazed jade, no matter what the price.” Jian Wushuang’s expression turned cold. “Xuan God, how strong is the Earth Saint Star Master?”

“The Earth Saint Star Master is not very strong. He is considered average among the Rulers, slightly weaker than the Heaven Ancestor. Moreover, the Heaven Ancestor obtained a supreme treasure by chance, but the Earth Saint Star Master doesn’t have a supreme treasure,” Daoist Xuan God explained.

“However, no matter how weak he is, he is still a real Ruler. He has many tricks, strong life-saving abilities, and a weird and irritable personality. Therefore, he has always been a Ruler who is not easy to provoke.”

“Take Star Palace as an example. If it’s not necessary, we definitely don’t want to provoke such a Ruler. After all, a barefooted person is not afraid of wearing shoes. Earth Saint Star Master has nothing to worry about, and Star Palace is involved in many things. As long as we provoke him and can’t kill him, he can attack our experts without any scruples. When that happens, our Star Palace will have a headache.”

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s expression changed slightly.

Daoist Xuan God noticed the change in Jian Wushuang’s expression and immediately changed the topic, “My young friend, It’s okay if you really need the ice heart glazed jade. It’s just an Earth Saint Star Master. We can just kill him and force him to hand it over.”

“Xuan God, didn’t you just say that the Earth Saint Star Master is not to be trifled with?” Jian Wushuang looked over in puzzlement.

“Yes, previously, the Earth Saint Star Master was indeed not to be trifled with.” Daoist Xuan God smiled.

“Previously, although there were four Rulers in Star Palace, the strongest Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master had been staying in the Divine Beginning Realm and could not escape at all. On the other hand, I, spacetime, and the Heaven Ancestor are only primary Rulers, and spacetime is not good at fighting head-on. The Heaven Ancestor and I are not much stronger than the Earth Saint Star Master. Even if the three of us join hands, we can only force the Earth Saint Star Master into a very sorry state, but we can not really threaten his life.”

“Since his life isn’t in danger, there’s no need for him to be afraid of us. But now, the Star Palace has one more Ruler, and that’s you. You have the most powerful attack true treasure, and you’re good at Sword Dao and Killing Dao. If you attack, you’ll be able to crush him by yourself. Plus, spacetime and I will help him, making it impossible for him to escape. That will be enough to threaten his life.”

“Although this Earth Saint Star Master is irritable and eccentric, he is a master who bullies the weak and fears the strong. As long as his life is not threatened, he will not give face to anyone. However, for the top forces in this territory, such as the North Sea Palace and the three Rulers of the North Sea Palace, the Sky Roc Ruler alone is enough to kill him. He will never dare to provoke such a force.”

“As long as we can put enough pressure on him and make him feel that his life is in danger, he will have no choice but to bow his head!”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang smiled. “In that case, let’s go to the Earth Saint Star now and send a message to time and space to ask him to come as soon as possible.”

“I’ll send a message now.” Daoist Xuan God immediately sent the message, and the two of them immediately went to the Earth Saint Star.

The Earth Saint Star was a very ordinary Earth Star. It was not big, and its geographical location was not as good as the Earth Star occupied by the major forces. However, because of its remote location, the Earth Saint Star Master had completely become the Ruler of this territory, after occupying this place, he had completely become the Ruler of this territory.

He was basically an unruly existence around here. No one dared to provoke him, and his life was extremely comfortable.

However, at this moment, in a dark void near the Earth Saint Star, Jian Wushuang, Daoist Xuan God, and Temporal Temple Master were standing side by side.

“The Earth Saint Star is ahead. The Earth Saint Star Master hasn’t been to the three battlefields for a long time. He should be in the Earth Saint Star now. Should we kill him directly?” Daoist Xuan God said.

“There’s no rush.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand. “Let’s go and meet the Saint Star Master first. If he changes his mind now and is willing to hand over the ice-heart glazed jade or give it to us, it will save us a lot of trouble. If he is still as tough as before, it’s not too late for us to attack him.”

“How about this? I’ll go to the Saint Star with Xuan God. You stay in the void around the Saint Star and wait for my news. As long as we don’t make a deal with the Saint Star Master, I’ll send a message to you. Then you can directly seal the space around the Saint Star Master and not give him a chance to escape,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay.” Temporal Temple Master nodded.

“Xuan God, let’s go and meet Earth Saint Star Master.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and immediately rushed toward Earth Saint Star with Daoist Xuan God. In the blink of an eye, they arrived in front of Earth Saint Star.
