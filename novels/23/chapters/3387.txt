Translator: EndlessFantasy TranslationEditor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In an exquisite pavilion in the headquarters of the Samsara Sect, the sect leader of the Samsara sect, who was sitting in front of a long table and casually flipping through a token, suddenly stood up.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis? This Heavenly Sword Marquis is actually outside our Samsara Sect?” The Samsara Sect leader’s face was ashen, and there was a trace of shock and anger in his eyes.

“Yes, and he came with the samsara beads.” A white-haired elder nodded.

“How dare he!” The Samsara Sect Master cursed in his heart, “I heard that Heavenly Sword Marquis made a bet with the Light King in the Blood Wave Realm. One of the bets was the samsara beads, and it ended up in his hands. But I didn’t expect him to actually dare to take the Samsara beads into the

Samsara Sect!”

The Samsara Heaven Realm was left behind by the Samsara Grandmaster, and it had always been under the control of the Samsara Sect. The Samsara Sect had also been paying close attention to the samsara beads that the Samsara Grandmaster had refined. The bet between Jian Wushuang and the Light

King in the Blood Wave Realm…the samsara bead was one of the wagers. Perhaps the other sects would not care too much about it, but the Samsara Sect definitely knew about it and attached great importance to it.

According to the words of the Samsara Grandmaster, anyone who came with the samsara bead could enter the Samsara Heaven Realm to cultivate and comprehend. However, the current Samsara Sect Master was obviously very angry at Jian Wushuang’s arrival.

“Did Heavenly Sword Marquis come alone, or was there another expert with him?” Samsara Sect Master asked again.

“According to the reports from the disciples at the entrance, there is another person with him. That person’s aura is well hidden, so we can’t tell whether it’s real or not. But if we’re not mistaken, it should be a Principles Master,” said the white-haired elder.

“Humph, he wants to enter the Samsara Heaven Realm with just a Principles Master? In his dreams!” The Samsara Sect Master’s face turned cold. “Let’s go, call the elders and follow me to meet this super monster from the Divine Beginning Realm!”

Soon, with the Samsara Sect Master in the lead, nearly ten elders at the Principles Master level of the Samsara Sect walked toward the entrance aggressively.

At the entrance of the secret realm, Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chenhuo looked relaxed. They did not have any hostility toward the Samsara Sect, and in their opinion, the Samsara Sect should not have any hostility toward them.

Not long after, they saw a group of more than a dozen people rushing out of the secret realm. Their auras were extremely dense, and more than half of them had reached the level of Principles Masters, especially the two leaders, one was the Principles Master of the Samsara Sect, and the other was the

great elder of the Samsara Sect. The auras they emitted were clearly at the peak of the four void realms.

Seeing this lineup, Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chenhuo immediately looked strange.

“Two peak of the four void realms and nearly ten Principles Masters. This lineup is extraordinary,” Demon Master Chenhuo said.

“although I’m very famous in the Divine Beginning Realm, I don’t have any friendship with the Samsara Sect. The Samsara Sect wouldn’t send such a lineup to welcome me, right?

“But if the Samsara Sect sent such a force to make an enemy out of me, there’s no reason for it?

“I don’t remember offending the Samsara Sect.” Jian Wushuang looked puzzled.

Many experts of the Samsara Sect had already appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chenhuo.

“Are you Heavenly Sword Marquis?” Samsara Sect Master stared at Jian Wushuang coldly.

“Yes, Iam. You must be Dark Chaos Sect Master of Samsara Sect, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, I am.” Samsara Sect Master nodded. “I heard that you came here with the Samsara bead today? Let me see it.”

Although Jian Wushuang noticed that Samsara Sect Master’s expression and the surrounding people were a little strange, he did not think too much about it. He directly gave the samsara bead to Samsara Sect Master. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Samsara Sect Master took the bead and played with it for a while. He nodded slightly and said, “It is indeed the samsara bead. Well, thank you for returning it. Now you can leave.”

‘As soon as he said this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed, “Sect Master, what you said is wrong. I came to Samsara Sect with the samsara bead. According to the principles set by the Samsara Grandmaster, I can enter the Samsara Heaven Realm with the samsara bead to comprehend the Samsara principles.”

“That’s true.” The Samsara Sect Master did not deny it. “If someone else came with the Samsara bead, the Samsara Sect would bring him into the Samsara Heaven Realm, but you can’t!”

The Samsara Sect Master’s voice was full of coldness. He looked at Jian Wushuang with cold eyes.

Jian Wushuang was confused, but he still asked in a low voice, “Sect Master, if I remember correctly, there is no enmity between the Samsara Sect and me, right? Why are you deliberately making things difficult for me?”

“No enmity? Haha, you still have the nerve to say that there is no enmity between you and the Samsara Sect.” The Samsara Sect Master smiled coldly, then he shouted in a low voice, “Heavenly Sword Marquis, I ask you, do you still remember the expert you met in the Blood Wave Realm named Dujiu?”

“Dujiu?” Jian Wushuang was stunned. He quickly thought about it and quickly remembered, “I met an Invincible Saint named Dujiu in the Blood Wave Realm, During the fight for the Blood Wave Token, I tried to assassinate him in order to get the Blood Wave Token. I destroyed his divine body and he was

Killed by the Saints who surrounded him. As for the Blood Wave Token, it fell into my hands. But what does Dujiu’s death have to do with your Samsara Sect?”

Jian Wushuang did not understand.

Back then, he had killed Dujiu in order to fight for the Blood Wave Token. However, he had read Dujiu’s information before. According to the information, Dujiu was a solitary expert with no background, how could he be related to the Samsara Sect now?

“Humph, what does Dujiu have to do with the Samsara Sect? Well, let me tell you now. Dujiu is my son!” The Samsara Sect Master said with bloodshot eyes.

“What?”

}ian Wushuang was completely stunned.

Beside him, Demon Master Chenhuo was also stunned.

Dujiu was the biological son of the Samsara Sect Master?

How could this be?

“Sect Master, are you sure you’re not joking?

“In the information collected by the Temporal Temple, Dujiu is clearly a solitary expert with no background. How could he be your biological son?” Jian Wushuang asked with a frown.

“Humph, how could I lie to you?” The Samsara Sect Master gnashed his teeth. “My rebellious son is rebellious and disobedient. Many years ago, he left the Samsara Sect and went on his own. He even changed his name and had nothing to do with me or the Samsara Sect. However, no matter how he tried,

he was still my son and a member of the Samsara Sect. Yet, you killed him indirectly in the Blood Wave Realm!”
