4180 The Final Battle

After hearing Jian Wushuang’s explanation, Ninth Kalpa King and Divine Marquis Qingfeng exchanged a look and smiled.

They could tell that Jian Wushuang’s explanation was perfunctory, but they did not blame him. After all, everyone had secrets.

They were curious about Jian Wushuang’s experience over the past thousand years, but since he was unwilling to say too much, they naturally would not ask.

“Jian Wushuang, it’s good that you’ve returned safely. With you here, we have more confidence in the final battle.” Divine Marquis Qingfeng said with a smile.

!!

“The final battle?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and a hint of doubt flashed in his eyes.

The Ninth Kalpa King nodded and said indifferently, “It’s time for us to leave the Tarot Ruins, but before we leave…”

The Ninth Kalpa King’s words paused, and a fierce look flashed in his eyes.

“…I have to settle the accounts first!”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang understood and a cold light flashed in his eyes.

“What do you plan to do?” Jian Wushuang said.

“What do we do? Of course,” the Ninth Kalpa King said with a cold smile. “We’ll go straight to his door and crush the Silver Roc’s divine body inch by inch. We’ll burn his soul to ashes.”

“What time?” Jian Wushuang nodded and asked.

“Anytime,” The Ninth Kalpa King replied.

“Three days later,” Jian Wushuang replied after some thought.

At this point, the time was set.

Jian Wushuang, Ninth Kalpa King, and Divine Marquis Qingfeng chatted for a while more before they left.

….

In a sealed bedroom.

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged with the Tarot sword manual floating in front of his knees.

Jian Wushuang turned to the first page. Slowly, the world in front of him turned into a dead darkness again. He continued to sink into the comprehension of the sword move ‘eternal night’.

Although he had only comprehended a little bit of this move, its power had already become the most lethal move in Jian Wushuang’s hands!

It could be said that ‘eternal night’ had already become one of Jian Wushuang’s trump cards!

Once it was used, it would definitely shock the heavens!

Three days passed by in a flash.

On the morning of the third day, Ninth Kalpa King, Jian Wushuang, Divine Marquis Qingfeng, and the other Ultimate Rulers who had submitted to Ninth Kalpa King gathered in the hall.

“I won’t hide it from you. Our first battle is to kill the Ruler Silver Roc. If anyone wants to leave, I won’t stop them.” The Ninth Kalpa King stood in the main seat of the hall and said with his hands behind his back.

As soon as he finished speaking, the hall instantly became noisy, and the faces of the many Ultimate Rulers changed slightly.

“You’re going to kill Ruler Silver Roc?”

“The Ruler Silver Roc has many experts under his command. He has dozens of Ultimate Rulers. Although they aren’t strong individually, if they work together, I’m afraid it’ll be…”

“Isn’t this a little too dangerous?”

A few of the Ultimate Rulers immediately shrank back, their eyes flashing with the intention to retreat.

They followed the Ninth Kalpa King to find a backer, but not to fight to the death.

“After this battle is over, I’m willing to give up everything you’ve acquired from killing the Silver Roc. You can have it all.” The Ninth Kalpa King continued to speak indifferently.

After he said this, the Ultimate Rulers, who had originally intended to retreat, were shocked.

“The Ninth Kalpa King doesn’t want any of them?”

“As the leader of a faction, the Ruler Silver Roc has collected countless divine medicines and divine materials over the years. If we really kill him…”

“Wealth is found in danger!”

The hearts of the many Ultimate Rulers jumped, and hesitation appeared on their faces.

“I’ll give you the time it takes for an incense stick to burn to consider. After that, give me your answer.”

After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn.

All the Ultimate Rulers present took a deep breath and seemed to have made a decision. They said in unison, “Ninth Kalpa King, we…I’m willing to follow you in battle!”

Upon hearing this, the Ninth Kalpa King’s always indifferent face could not help but smile slightly. He nodded and replied, “Good.”

…

At the same time, in the central area of the Tarot Ruins, on another plain.

This place was much more lively than the other places in the Tarot Ruins. Many Ultimate Rulers had set up camp here, forming a lively scene. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

In the largest hall, the Ruler Silver Roc was chatting with a group of people with a warm smile on his face.

There were two people sitting beside him.

The one on the left was wearing a purple gold crown and a nine-clawed dragon robe. He had a dignified look and a light golden flame mark between his eyebrows.

If the Water Sorcerer Ruler was here, he would recognize that this person was the Third Prince of the Da Feng Divine Kingdom, which was ranked second in the Tarot Ruins!

The other person was wearing a red robe, his figure tall and sturdy, his hair tied into a ponytail that hung loosely on his back, and he was sitting barefooted. It was Lord Zhennan!

“Ruler Silver Roc, why have you suddenly called me over?” Lord Zhennan frowned and said impatiently.

The Third Prince of the Da Feng Divine Kingdom was also the Ruler Silver Roc, and he had an ugly expression on his face.

Not too long ago, the two of them had suddenly received a message from the Ruler Silver Roc. He had asked them to gather here and discuss some important matters.

“As expected, the Blood Sky Palace didn’t come.” Ruler Silver Roc muttered to himself as he looked at the empty seat of the three he had prepared.

Then, he turned his head to look at Lord Zhennan and the Third Prince. He smiled and said, “Have you heard about the Ninth Kalpa King recruiting experts recently?”

“What?”

Lord Zhennan raised his eyebrows when he heard this. He naturally knew that the Ninth Kalpa King had not deliberately concealed the fact that he was recruiting strong practitioners.

“I know. This isn’t a secret, right? Silver Roc, just say what you want to say. You know that this king hates keeping people in suspense the most.”

“Your Highness, please calm down. There’s something strange about this. Listen to me in detail.”

The Ruler Silver Roc’s expression was calm. He cleared his throat and slowly said, “I know the Ninth Kalpa King the best. He has always been arrogant and conceited, and he looks down on others. Therefore, he rarely goes with others, let alone recruit people. Thus, once he recruits people, he can be certain that something big is about to happen.”

“Something big?” Lord Zhennan’s pupils shrank when he heard this.

The Third Prince of the Da Feng Divine Kingdom also looked interested.

“Yes.” Ruler Silver Roc nodded, then continued, “The Ninth Kalpa King has been in the Ultimate Ruler realm for dozens of chaos cycles, causing his status in the divine Palace of life to plummet. We don’t have to think to know that he must be very anxious to break through to the supremacy stage.”

“A thousand years ago, in the Fengyang Canyon, the Ninth Kalpa King broke through our encirclement and obtained the divine medicine that could increase the chances of breaking through to the supreme realm. Now, it’s time for him to return and break through to the supreme realm.”

“So? If he’s going back, then he’s going back. What does that have to do with us? Don’t tell me that you’re still thinking of taking back the Supreme divine medicine in his hands?” Lord Zhennan asked indifferently.
