Chapter 3501: Unfamiliar

“I’ve sent a message to temple master star-moon, and she has sent someone to deliver it. It should be arriving at the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley in a few days,” Jian Wushuang said.

“In that case, it’s almost ready. As soon as the star-moon agarwood arrives, we can begin the soul stripping immediately,” Ma Yi said.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

Three days later, the people of the Temporal Temple had arrived at the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley.

The person who had arrived was Jian Wushuang’s subordinate, True Pupil Master.

“Greetings, Inspector and Honorable Master.” True Pupil Master bowed respectfully to Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chenhuo.

“True Pupil Master, thank you for your hard work.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

“Inspector, this is what Star-moon Temple Master asked me to give you.” True Pupil Master gave Jian Wushuang an interspatial ring.

The interspatial ring contained the star-moon Agarwood.

Jian Wushuang took it, glanced at it, and handed it to Ma Yi.

“Senior Ma Yi, how is it?”Jian Wushuang asked.

“This star-moon agarwood is more than 200 million years old. It’s definitely a top-grade wood,” Ma Yi said.

Jian Wushuang nodded with satisfaction. Then he asked, “True Pupil Master, the Temporal Temple has been quiet during my absence. How is the patrol team?”

“My lord, nothing serious has happened in the Temporal Temple. Even the patrol team has been very relaxed. They sent out a patrol team a while ago, but it was just a small matter and was easily solved. Star-moon Temple Master has already told us that we won’t ask you to come out for ordinary matters. As long as it’s really important or urgent, we will call you back,” True Pupil Master said.

Jian Wushuang could not help but smile.

He was the sixth inspector of the Temporal Temple, but apart from the first trip to the Purple Star Demon Sect, he was not in the camp for the rest of the time. He was not qualified to be an inspector.

However, the higher-ups of the Temporal Temple knew that what he needed the most was to improve his strength. Although it was not an important matter, they would not ask him to help.

“Inspector, Star-moon Temple Master sent me here for another matter besides handing over the star-moon agarwood to you,” True Pupil Master suddenly said.

“Oh, what is it?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“This matter has something to do with master consecrator.” True Pupil Master looked at Demon Master Chenhuo beside him.

“It has something to do with me, don’t tell me?” Demon Master Chenhuo was stunned for a moment before he revealed an excited look. “Could it be that you have found information about the experts left behind by the Purple Star Demon Sect?”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Demon Master Chenhuo came from the Purple Star Demon Sect.

However, the Purple Star Demon Sect had been destroyed 200 million years ago by Flame Saint Master.

At its peak, the Purple Star Demon Sect was an extremely powerful force and an overlord in the second heaven. It was not much weaker than the Eight Directions Heaven Sect in the Third Heaven.

Such a large sect not only had great strength, but also had an extraordinary foundation.

Back then, the Flame Saint Realm used a lightning-fast method to destroy the Purple Star Demon Sect. Although they destroyed the Purple Star Demon Sect’s headquarters and killed almost all the experts in the Purple Star Demon Sect’s headquarters…however, those Purple Star Demon Sect experts who had been adventuring in the outside world were not killed in that great battle.

Although the experts were later hunted by the Flame Saint Realm, some of them must have escaped and survived. However, under the pressure of the Flame Saint Realm, they had to live in anonymity.

After Demon Master Chenhuo and Jian Wushuang reached an agreement and saw the light of day again, Demon Master Chenhuo became a worshipper of the Temporal Temple, the Temporal Temple immediately began to help Demon Master Chenhuo track down the traces of the cultivators left behind by the Purple Star Demon Sect.

Until now, there was finally news.

“Our Temporal Temple has indeed found a portion of the experts left behind. And they are now in the Second Heaven,” True Pupil Master said.

“That’s great.” Demon Master Chenhuo clenched his hands tightly, his eyes filled with joy.

He had once treated the Purple Star Demon Sect as everything. It was precisely because of this that he was willing to be trapped in that secret realm alone for 200 million years.

With his talent, 200 million years was a huge delay for him.

The destruction of the Purple Star Demon Sect had dealt a huge blow to him.

Now, he finally received good news. He had found the experts left behind by the Purple Star Demon Sect.

“Chenhuo, congratulations.” Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “It won’t take long for my soul to be extracted. After everything is done here, I’ll ask the True Pupil Master to take us with him.”

“Okay.” Demon Master Chenhuo nodded heavily.

“Senior Ma Yi, Spirit Ancestor, the star-moon agarwood has arrived. The rest is up to you,” Jian Wushuang said.

Ma Yi and Spirit Ancestor looked at each other and nodded.

Then they went straight to the love-forgetting peak in the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley. In a cave mansion on the mountainside, Jian Wushuang finally saw his wife, Leng Rushuang.

She had a familiar face and a cold aura. The peerless beauty in front of him sat calmly on the jade bed. When she saw everyone enter, she slowly opened her eyes, which were cold and emotionless, she glanced at everyone.

Of course, she also glanced at Jian Wushuang, but her expression did not change at all. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Shuang ‘er.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was hoarse, but he immediately shook his head and said, “No, she is not shuang ‘er. She only has the same face.”

Jian Wushuang had long calmed down.

He knew very well that the peerless beauty in front of him was indeed not his wife, but a stranger.

After all, his wife’s memory in her previous life had been completely sealed, but in this life, she was completely unfamiliar and did not know him at all.

Even her body was from this life.

His wife’s real body was not this one, but the one that had been occupied by Leng Ruxue in his previous life. That was his wife’s real body.

Therefore, when Ma Yi proposed to strip her soul, he did not refuse. He was even willing to give up his body in this life.

To Jian Wushuang, Leng Rushuang’s body in this life, including her consciousness, were extremely unfamiliar. They were not familiar to him.

Only by stripping out the memories of his wife’s previous life, along with her soul, would it truly belong to his wife. In the future, when he had the opportunity to find Leng Rushuang and seize her body, then his wife would be truly complete! Only then would she be truly complete!
