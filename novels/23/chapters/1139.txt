Chapter 1140: Breakthrough!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Jian Wushuang left for the battlefield again?”

Celestial Master Golden Axe muttered to himself after hearing about Jian Wushuang’s departure.

“He’s close to being as strong as a Celestial Master of the Exceptional Realm and must have improved even more after returning from the World of Swords. I don’t think Celestial Masters of the Exceptional Realm can defeat him. It’d take a Universe Master to kill him!”

“I must be patient. He has just left. If I ask about it immediately, he might suspect me. I’ll wait and find a way to pinpoint his position after he’s been on the battlefield for a while…” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

With a plan in mind, Golden Axe also left for the battlefield soon after.

Over on the battlefield, Jian Wushuang continued on the same path that he had gone through before. It took him 20 years to arrive at the Chillywind Valley.

“Chillywind Valley…”

Jian Wushuang stared at the massive pit in front of him. It was so mysterious at the bottom that he could not help wanting to investigate it.

He recalled his narrow escape last time. He knew just how dangerous this valley was.

When the Blood Coldwind blew, even a Universe Master would be crushed into pieces, never mind him.

“This was the farthest place I reached when I came alone last time. Later on, I received the order to go to Dan Xin Palace. Since I’m going to venture on the battlefield once again, I’ll just start from here.” Jian Wushuang smiled. “Since it’s pretty desolate here, I don’t think I’ll come across other experts. I’ll find a spot here to make my breakthrough.”

With a shift of his body, he appeared inside a palace atop a mountain in the Chillywind Valley and sat down cross-legged.

He waved his hand and many elixirs appeared in front of him, each of which would help him during the process.

Besides, he also activated a Formation. It was the Spirit-gathering Formation that covered a small parameter. It could converge more Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy and help with his breakthrough.

Now fully prepared, he took a deep breath and then closed his eyes.

As he moved, a horrible force quickly spread in all directions. It caused the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy that the Spirit-gathering Formation gathered to pour into his body. Before long, the energy collected in him reached a saturation point.

“It’s beginning!”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, revealing a pair of gleaming pupils. His Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand.

“Break!”

He brandished Blood Mountain Sword following a shout.

Under the guidance of the Coalescence Sword Principle, a horrible sword shadow burst forth and cleave a towering mountain thousands of miles away in half. The bottleneck in his body trembled under the pressure of the Sword Principle but did not immediately break down.

“Again!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold. Instead of getting frustrated, he brandished his sword again.

He brandished his sword again and again. Meanwhile, the vast Spiritual Power accumulated in his body continued to frantically attack the bottleneck.

His face began to pale after dozens of attempts. His mouth was bleeding, too. Even so, the bottleneck remained the same.

“I didn’t expect it to be so hard,” he muttered in disbelief.

“If you’re a normal warrior, you would’ve already succeeded. This level of difficulty is expected for you as an Inverse Cultivator,” Gu King said. “Be patient. You can continue accumulating Spiritual Power like. I think it will work after another dozen times.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and then quickly swallowed the elixirs in front of him.

The elixirs poured abundant Spiritual Power into his body.

“Go on! Keep breaking!”

Jian Wushuang shouted as he once again brandished his sword. This time, he used Heaven’s Bane!

Heaven’s Bane, powerful with irresistible force, was developed based on the Yin-Yang Sword Principle.

This time, he used it alongside the Coalescence Sword Principle and it turned out to be even more powerful!

The Coalescence Sword Principle contained thousands of Sword Principles. Since the Yin-Yang Sword Principle was not the strongest, it was included as well. The Coalescence Sword Principle, as a result, could perfectly demonstrate Heaven’s Bane and make it even stronger.

Death Shadow could be used in the same way.

Death Shadow could also be used perfectly with the help of the Coalescence Sword Principle.

“Boom!”

His mouth bled again but this time, his eyes were gleaming.

He could sense a crack in the bottleneck.

The bottleneck was about to break down.

Even a small leak would sink a great ship. With a crack in the bottleneck, the rest would be easy to handle.

“Again!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his teeth and brandished his sword again. This time, he used Death Shadow.

“Boom!”

The crack in the bottleneck became bigger.

“Go on!”

Jian Wushuang brandished his sword again and again, crazily lashing at the bottleneck.

The crack in the bottleneck became bigger and bigger until the entire bottleneck snapped. Jian Wushuang trembled sharply and bellowed as the bottleneck inside him collapsed completely.

“I made it! I’m a Dao Master!”

His eyes glinted with golden light.

The moment his bottleneck collapsed, vast Spiritual Power coursed through his Eight Extraordinary Meridians. His aura also skyrocketed at an amazing speed.

“Boom!”

Changes occurred in the universe as his breakthrough affected everything around him.

Dark clouds gathered above him.

A majestic aura ripped through the world, exerting such great pressure that he could not stop it from spreading in all directions.

Suddenly, the majestic aura bathed the radius of a million miles around him.

Jian Wushuang could clearly feel everything around him, from the Void to the earth itself, shiver under the force of his power.

It was as if he was the master of this universe.
