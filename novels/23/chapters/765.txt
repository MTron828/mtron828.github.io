Chapter 766: I Give You A Chance

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Do what you want to do with no hesitation?”

“No consequence will fall?”

Xuan Yi’s words were little, but Jian Wushuang could hear his confidence.

It sounded as if everything was in Xuan Yi’s control.

With the addition of Xuan Yi’s mysteriousness and overbearingness, those words gave Jian Wushuang an enormous boost in confidence.

100 years ago, the seeds of the grudge between him and the three magnates had been sown when they attacked him.

Until now, Jian Wushuang had always been trying to take revenge against the three magnates. However, considering their enormous strength and long history in the Firmament Territory, Jian Wushuang faced many difficulties.

? During the 10 days in the Tianqi Mountains, he had to wear a mask and conceal his identity when attacking the experts from the three magnates.

He did not dare to take revenge explicitly, for fear that his master and the Ancient Sect would be involved in this matter.

He clearly wanted to annihilate the three magnates, but he could not voice it out due to the many concerns.

Now, things had changed.

His master’s words dispelled all his worries and he now felt supported.

“Master, I know what to do now.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Ok,” Xuan Yi responded and ended the conversation.

Jian Wushuang was still in the light cocoon. However, he now had a grin on his face. This grin was as cold as a sharp blade.

Emperor Sword appeared in his hand.

“All those years of training, near-death failures as well as bloody lessons again and again. I had no choice but to hide my talents and skills. But today, with my Master’s support, I’ll display all my abilities without restraint,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself as his gaze shone fervently.

He was a Sword Cultivator!

A peerless Swordsman!

He was good at using the longsword and immersed himself in Sword Principle, which he loved.

It was a principle that could annihilate, destroy and tear apart everything.

Thus, as a peerless Sword Cultivator, Jian Wushuang had to be extraordinary.

Jian Wushuang’s killing intent was blooming while he remained in the light cocoon. His enthusiasm had died down after all these years of sufferings and miseries.

There was no other choice. He had just entered the Eternal World; his strength was not strong enough. He had to endure most of the time.

But right now, he could feel his enthusiasm boiling in his blood.

Jian Wushuang even felt that all the blood in his body were boiling.

“Today, nothing can stand in my way!”

His loud voice echoed through the skies. It was like a thunder that stayed in the skies for a long time.

On the void, after trapping Jian Wushuang in the light cocoon, Yun Fan decided to take him to the Cloud Sea Asgard directly.

Palace Master Destruction and the others were very anxious about Jian Wushuang’s situation. They tried to intervene but were stopped by the people from Cloud Sea Asgard.

Yun Fan stared at the light cocoon flying towards him. A sinister grin spread across his face.

“Though we suffered a great loss in Eternal Zone this time, bringing Jian Wushuang back will be enough to make up for it.

“Jian Wushuang…”?Yun Fan was in a fever of excitement.

He was not excited over Jian Wushuang; he was thrilled at the thought of uncovering the big secrets of the Eternal Zone and getting the opportunities.

Soon, he could get them from Jian Wushuang.

As for Jian Wushuang’s Teacher, Xuan Yi…

The Cloud Sea Asgard was indeed fearful of Xuan Yi. However, it was not to the extent of being frightened.

The secrets of Jian Wushuang were enough to make Cloud Sea Asgard go crazy. They could not bother about Xuan Yi at this point in time.

“Come here.”

Yun Fan waved his hands slightly at the cocoon. Just as he was going to reach it…

Whoosh!

A bright and dazzling sword light flashed out of the cocoon, blinding everyone.

The sword light had an incomparable sharpness and an unexplainable edge. It had shone suddenly from the light cocoon and reached everywhere after the sword struck out and cut the cocoon open. The accompanying ear-piercing sounds it made while doing so were like a peerless swordsman’s roars in rage.

Instantly, everyone was in distress and started running around.

“What’s going on?” Yun Fan was startled.

He was just trying to entrap Jian Wushuang, but what was his identity?

He was the Great Elder of the Cloud Sea Asgard, as well as an expert in Step Four of the Eternal Realm. Hence, he thought that there was no way a Divine Realm expert could break free from his trap, not even those experts in Step One or Two of the realm.

However, Jian Wushuang made it.

After breaking open the cocoon, Jian Wushuang appeared in front of the crowd again.

At this moment, his black robe was billowing even without the wind blowing. Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed and he had a cold face while holding a sword in hand.

Hiss… faint Sword Essences emitted from his body.

He looked all the same as before but the crowd could tell, with just one glance, that he was now completely different.

In the past, he used to keep all things to himself. No one knew his strengths.

Now, he was like an unsheathed sword revealing its shining edge.

“This feeling…”

Looking at Jian Wushuang, the experts of the sects frowned.

They sensed a special aura coming from Jian Wushuang, spread by his Sword Essence.

However, rather than calling it his aura, it was more of his temperament. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Yes, that was it.

Jian Wushuang’s temperament had changed completely.

Now, Jian Wushaung was just standing there, not moving. However, he made others feel as if he was an extreme precious sword that could destroy everything in the world.

Nothing could stand in his way!

Invincible!

Unstoppable!

This was the temperament that he was showing.

The temperament of the Sword Principle!

“Yun Fan.”

Jian Wushuang finally spoke, and his voice seemed to pass through everything before it rang in everyone’s ears.

“Didn’t you said that you want to invite me to the Cloud Sea Asgard to be your guest?”

“I will make your wish come true!”

Everyone present became quiet. Countless gazes were fixed on Jian Wushuang as people listened to him.

Make Yun Fan’s wish come true?

The experts were puzzled at Jian Wushuang’s words.

In the next moment, Jian Wushuang threw the Emperor sword in his hand. The sword emitted a chilly Sword Edge as it headed straight towards Yun Fan.

“As long as you can take my sword away from me… I’ll go with you!”

Jian Wushuang’s loud voice was filled with endless sharpness. It echoed through the vast place.

It rose up high into the sky with the Sword Essence and alarmed all the creatures there.
