Chapter 812: An Invitation from the Governor

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang walked slowly, with some trepidation, alone over the sea on the perimeter of Cercis Island.

“I didn’t expect the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master to show up because I killed Lei Xin. Fortunately, he did not give me a hard time due to his status and only asked me to pay him some Divine Gems to save face.”

He pondered.

He didn’t care about having to pay those Divine Gems for compensation at all.

30,000,000 was a lot of Divine Gems, but an expert at Step Five of the Eternal Realm would be able to afford it.

Instead of killing him, the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master simply asked him for some Divine Gems, which was lucky enough for Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, Jian Wushuang… ”

A wild cry rose abruptly in Jian Wushuang’s mind. His expression changed as he turned his hand over, and then a miniature mountain immediately appeared in his hand.

It was the Sword Mountain form of the Blood Mountain Sword.

And Su Ming was in it, being suppressed.

“Su Ming, what are you trying to say?” Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice while looking at the miniature mountain.

“Jian Wushuang, let me go,” Su Ming begged bitterly, “As long as you let me go, I will serve you as my master and obey you from now on.”

“Huh! Serve me as your master?” Jian Wushuang asked in a mock and frosty tone. “If you were strong, perhaps I would have some respect for you, but you’re such an incompetent and shameless person. Do you think I’ll forget that the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor was destroyed because of a piece of crap like you? It’s really not worth it!”

Jian Wushuang thoroughly despised Su Ming for being so spineless.

“Jian Wushuang… ” Su Ming tried to continue, but Jian Wushuang interrupted him with a cold snort.

With a thought, Jian Wushuang stirred a Raging Fire Restriction inside the Sword Mountain, which sent out clusters of flames towards Su Ming.

These flames could not kill Su Ming since he was a superior Divine Realm expert, but they could make him miserable.

His cries of pain were heard echoing from the Sword Mountain.

“Su Ming, you’re in my hands now,” Jian Wushuang said in a chilly manner, “I’ll make sure you enjoy yourself!”

He would never show mercy to Su Ming because the thing he hated most was betrayal.

Now that Su Ming had been suppressed inside Sword Mountain once again, Jian Wushuang could use some of the Restrictions within the Sword Mountain to torture him. And, he knew Su Ming’s every move, so when Su Ming could no longer bear the torture and tried to commit suicide, he would prevent him from killing himself.

Su Ming would learn firsthand what Jian Wushuang’s remark meant, “Now that you’re in my hands, I will help you understand how lucky it is to be dead!”

A moment later, Jian Wushuang stopped on a small island and regulated his breath to recover his Spiritual Power.

By the time he regained his peak condition and returned to Cercis Island, it was already the next morning.

The moment he reached Yang Zaixuan’s mansion, Yang Zaixuan came out to meet him.

“How did it turn out, Third brother?” Yang Zaixuan asked with concern.

“It went well. Lei Xin is dead and my sworn enemy is now in my hands,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“Good.” Yang Zaixuan nodded.

At this time, a sergeant of the Cercis Army came to them.

“Commander, His Excellency, the governor, has sent word that he wants you to see him now and that he would like for you to bring your friend with you,” the sergeant said and cast a deliberate glance at Jian Wushuang. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Ah?” Yang Zaixuan’s face changed, then he exchanged a strange look with Jian Wushuang.

The governor of the Cercis Army had great power on Cercis Island. As a commander of the Cercis Army, Yang Zaixuan was under the command of that governor, so it was natural for the governor to call for him.

But it was odd that the governor had specifically asked him to bring Jian Wushuang with him.

“I never told the governor about you, so how does he know about you? Why did he call you there?” Yang Zaixuan raised these questions in bewilderment.

“Hah, we’ll know when we see him,” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

After speaking for a moment, they went to meet the governor of the Cercis Army.

The moment they flew out of the courtyard into the sky, they sensed a group of dozens of people quickly passing by.

Most of the people in the group were sergeants of the Cercis Army and some were famous Eternal Realm experts on Cercis Island. In addition, Jian Wushuang knew the person at the center of the group.

“The Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master?” he gazed at him.

He had just seen the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master outside of Cercis Island last night, so he recognized him at a glance.

“He’s a Dao Master?” Yang Zaixuan had also seen the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master.

They just happened to be going in the same direction, so they followed the group. Not long after, they arrived at the edge of Cercis Island.

Dozens of people stood quietly in the area, seemingly waiting to meet someone.

“A Dao Master personally came to welcome someone. Is there a big shot coming to Cercis Island?” Yang Zaixuan muttered.

“Maybe,” Jian Wushuang said as he nodded slightly.

Dao Masters were very respected individuals, so the person whom a Dao Master personally greeted had to be a big shot.

After a short while, they saw a silver-white alien lion, surrounded by a group of warriors dressed in silver, gradually appear above Cercis Island.

A handsome silver-haired young man in a white robe stood on the back of the alien lion. The lion was running fast, but the young man had been standing still, with an attractive smile that never left his face.

The young man was alone on the giant alien lion, but amongst the people around him there was a vigorous elder who was close by. The elder looked a little cold and exuded a terrifying aura.

It was an aura that belonged to a Dao Master.

Apparently, he was also a Dao Master.

After seeing the people who were moving in his direction, the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master, who had been waiting quietly, laughed, and his hearty laugh echoed over the entire Cercis Island. Then, he said, “Welcome to Cercis Island, second master. It’s an honor to have you here. I’m Tian Yun and I am here to welcome you on behalf of our lord.”

“Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master, I’ve heard so much about you,” the young man on the alien lion smiled humbly and calmly, even though he was facing a Dao Master.

“Our lord has prepared a feast to welcome you. Second master, please come with me,” the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master said.

“All right,” the young man said and nodded, then cast a glance at the elder beside him and said, “Let’s go, Elder He.”

Then, the group of people went toward the mansion of the Lord of Cercis Island, the grand Cercis Castle.

As soon as the group left, the streets of the entire Cercis Island buzzed.
