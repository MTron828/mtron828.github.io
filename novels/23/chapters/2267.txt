Reincarnation

In the Void, both Jian Wushuang and Bing Shan stopped whatever they were doing.

Jian Wushuang stood there coldly.

Bing Shan stood there as well. By then his murderous intent and frenzy had dissipated. He stood there frowning as he watched blood oozing out from his body.

The surrounding Ancient Era experts were shocked.

“Lord Bing Shan is injured?”

“How?”

“It’s Lord Bing Shan!”

“One step away from being Master of Holy Land, Lord Bing Shan was injured by a Chaotic Realm rascal?”

“Unbelievable.”

The Ancient Era experts were all in awe.

If they had not witnessed it for themselves, they would not have believed it.

As Ancient Era experts, they knew how strong Bing Shan was.

Bing Shan’s sabre skills were powerful and he not only knew how to attack, his self-defence mechanism was even more terrifying. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

That combination of sabre skills and sabre essence armour made him famous in the Absolute Beginning Divine World.

They had never expected him to get injured during the fight against Jian Wushuang.

The armour did not block Jian Wushuang’s sword?

“That blade...” Bing Shan stared at Jian Wushuang as he felt his sword essence armour changing. “You could use Reincarnation Rules of Order to revert my sword essence back into the origin. It’s not much, but you managed to injure me.”

“Decent swordsmanship, even better Reincarnation Rules of Order.”

Bing Shan knew that even though his swordsmanship was good, how he utilised Reincarnation Rules of Order was even better.

Jian Wushuang’s realisation of Reincarnation Rules of Order was not high, most likely he was new to it, but already he was very familiar with it.

To apply Reincarnation Rules of Order to swordsmanship and morph objects back to their original state was impossible even for higher experts from back in the Absolute Beginning Divine World.

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold, and he was not delighted at all.

He knew it was all thanks to One-Star Man’s Reincarnation Pearl.

The small-scale reincarnation within the pearl had helped Jian Wushuang tremendously.

No just in terms of realisation, Jian Wushuang’s usage of Reincarnation Rules of Order had significantly improved over the past three thousand years.

Samsara was his strongest self-created skill.

It is not the most powerful, but the terrifying part came with the reincarnation at the tip of his blade.

He could make fauna reincarnate, along with natural materials.

He could revert Bing Shan’s sword essence, but only by a bit.

But that was enough to give Jian Wushuang a shot.

“Guess I underestimated you, I thought I could defeat you or at least suppress you under these restrictions. I never expected your Reincarnation Rules of Order to make such a huge improvement across these thousand years. Even I can no longer defeat you, I may even lose to you,” Bing Shan said.

It was true.

He had a perfect combination of attack and defence.

His sabre skills would destroy everything in his way.

His sabre essence armour would block everything else.

It was a scary combination.

But now, Jian Wushuang’s Samsara made his armour useless, losing his self-defence mechanism.

Even though Jian Wushuang couldn’t go against his sabre skills, he had unbelievable self-defence mechanisms. Even if he were to absorb the full blow from Bing Shan, it would be Bing Shan who got injured first.

“I could defeat you, but I could never kill you,” Jian Wushuang said.

He knew that well.

Bing Shan’s fighting power was way stronger than that of any other Divine Demon he had even met, including Old Monster Jiao. Only Emperor Thirteen could be stronger than him.

It was impossible for Jian Wushuang to kill him.

“Even though you are stronger than I imagined, I will keep to my word,” Bing Shan stared at Jian Wushuang. “As strong as you are, you are only limited to this land, a Chaotic Realm like you could never go against those Lords at the Absolute Beginning Divine World.”

“How will I know if I don’t try?” Jian Wushuang said.

Bing Shan frowned but did not say more. He looked at the Ancient Era experts and said, “Guys, it should be clear why they would want to open the link passage for us?” After hearing that, many Ancient Era experts looked confused.

They had been trapped for too long a time, but the Absolute Beginning Divine World had never really cared about them.

Most of the Ancient Era experts were at most Chaotic Divine Demons, which meant they were nothing but ants to the Masters of Holy Land.

The only person one could consider not an ant would be Bing Shan.

Because of that, the experts at Absolute Beginning Divine World never bothered about them. When they opened the link passage in the First Era, they did not wake the experts there up.

It had always been the case, and the Chaotic Divine Demons knew.

But now, the Absolute Beginning Divine World had opened the link passage for them to escape.

But where had this opportunity come from?

The Ancient Era experts looked at the masked white-clothed woman at the centre of the Void.
