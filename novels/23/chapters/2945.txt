Chapter 2946: Primal Chaos Palace

——

“Dead, dead?”

“A Peak False Saint was killed just like that?”

In the tower, the purple-haired youth and demonic jade looked at the scene in the mirror image in shock.

A Peak False Saint was indeed nothing to them. They could easily kill him.

But now, the one who killed Jin Shi was only a Divine Master.

A Divine Master could kill a Peak False Saint, and from the looks of it, Jian Wushuang seemed to have it easy.

“True Saint, Sword Heavenly Marquis definitely has the battle strength of a True Saint!” Yao Yu shouted.

“Yes, once he showed his strength, he activated the sword formation and seriously injured Jin Shi with one attack. The second time, he killed Jin Shi. Only a True Saint has such strength. And even among first-rank True Saints, Sword Heavenly Marquis is not weak,” the purple-haired youth said.

“The Primitive Palace. He can definitely enter the Primitive Palace. Without a doubt, he is definitely one of the top existences in the Primitive Palace. If he improves a little in terms of the rules, he might even be able to enter the Primal Chaos Palace!” Yao Yu said solemnly.

“Primal Chaos Palace!” The purple-haired young man’s heart could not help but be shocked.

Both of them had extraordinary backgrounds and knew more about Heaven-cleaving Alliance. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The Heaven-cleaving Alliance had three palaces, which were used by the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to cultivate top geniuses.

These three palaces were the Heaven and Earth Palace, the Primitive Palace, and the Primal Chaos Palace.

Among them, the Heaven Earth Palace had the lowest level, and the level of geniuses was also the lowest. However, even the lowest Heaven and Earth Palace could not be entered by ordinary people. It had to be the top genius of the Divine Beginning World. Take a Divine Master for example… if this Divine Master wanted to enter the Heaven and Earth Palace, he had to at least kill an ordinary Immortal Saint.

This was only the lowest standard.

Some of the top geniuses in the Heaven and Earth Palace could kill Peak False Saints at the Divine Master level.

As for the Primitive Palace, it was higher than the Heaven and Earth Palace, so the level of geniuses was naturally higher.

When they saw that Jian Wushuang was able to fight Jin Shi head-on, they were certain that Jian Wushuang could definitely enter the Heaven and Earth Palace. However, they said that Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of the rules was higher, so he could enter the Primitive Palace, it showed how high the threshold of the Primitive Palace was.

If the geniuses of the Primitive Palace were to take the Divine Master as an example, he could definitely cross ranks to challenge a Peak False Saint, or even defeat a Peak False Saint. As for killing a Peak False Saint, only the top geniuses of the Primitive Palace could do it.

However, Jian Wushuang had not only killed Jin Shi, but he had also killed him easily.

He had driven the reincarnation sword formation and killed Jin SHi with two strikes. It was a complete slaughter.

With such strength, the purple-haired young man and Yao Yu believed that Jian Wushuang was qualified to enter the higher level of the Primal Chaos Palace!

The Primal Chaos Palace was a place where monsters were nurtured. Anyone who could enter the Primal Chaos Palace would be the most terrifying monsters and monsters in the Divine Beginning World.

Any one of them was enough to make all the forces in the absolute Divine Beginning World fight for it.

For example, among the top forces like the three great holy regions, the four great divine races, and the eight directions heavenly sect in the vast third sky, there were only a handful of such monsters.

And within the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, there was a rumor regarding the Primal Chaos Palace. It said that as long as a genius who came out of the Primal Chaos Palace did not die midway, the weakest one would be the Master of Laws!

Because of this, the purple-haired young man and Yao Yu were full of yearning for the Primal Chaos Palace. Unfortunately, although they were geniuses, they could only try to break into the Primal Chaos Palace. The Primal Chaos Palace was too far away for them.

“Long Yun, we should immediately report the matter of Heavenly Marquis Sword to the existence behind us or the highest level of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. We should try our best to absorb such a top genius,” Yao Yu said.

“Don’t be anxious.” Long Yun waved his hand. “Let’s not report it yet. After this assessment is over, you and I will go and talk to the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.”

“You and I will go? You mean…” Yao Yu’s expression changed.

“Hehe, if we recruit a top genius like the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, no matter which palace he goes to, as long as he shows his strength, you and I will receive a huge reward. However, if we report this matter to the person behind us and ask the higher-ups of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to recruit him and negotiate with him, we will still receive benefits, but not as much,” Long Yun said.

“Understood.” Yao Yu nodded slightly. He also understood Long Yun’s meaning.

The two of them took the initiative to approach and agreed on the terms. It would be best if they personally brought Heavenly Sword Marquis to the three palaces of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. That way, as long as Heavenly Sword Marquis revealed his strength, they would receive a huge reward.

However, if it was just to report the news, they would definitely not receive so many things.

In comparison, they would definitely choose the former.

“Let’s wait for a while. The assessment will be over in three days. Let’s wait here for three days.” Long Yun smiled and was obviously very happy.

…

In the Black Dragon Mountain.

Jian Wushuang did not know what happened in the outside world, nor did he know that Long Yun and Yao Yu were shocked by what happened to him.

He just did what he wanted to do.

In the battle with Jin Shi, he did have the intention of honing his swordsmanship. After all, his swordsmanship had a lot of room to grow. After honing his swordsmanship, he killed Jin Shi and gained a lot of wealth from Jin Shi, this was a big harvest.

Then, he continued to wander around the Black Dragon Mountain, searching for the Immortal Saints.

However, there were many Divine Masters among the remaining experts in Black Dragon Mountain, but Jian Wushuang was not interested in Divine Masters at all. However, there were not many Immortal Saints.

He had killed two of the 11 Immortal Saints, and only nine of them were wandering around the Black Dragon Mountain. Some of them were hiding, which made it difficult for Jian Wushuang to find them.

Time passed, and the last three days passed in a flash.

Jian Wushuang did not make any more moves during the last three days. Since then, the 10-day deadline had come to an end. Jian Wushuang and the others stopped their search and began to return to the previous gathering point.

As for the experts who were lucky enough to survive in Black Dragon Mountain, they were very happy.

They were glad that they had survived the 10-day hunt. As long as they survived these 10 days, they would be able to live according to what the goateed Elder had said. Of course, they were happy.

On the Black Dragon Mountain, in front of the huge black mountain that had been split in half, the experts who had come to participate in the assessment gathered once again.
