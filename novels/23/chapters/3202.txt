Chapter 3204: Desire

_____________

After hearing Duan Lang’s explanation, Jian Wushuang felt relieved.

Who did not want to become a Principles Master?

There were many shortcuts to becoming a Principles Master in Blood Wave Palace.

Even Jian Wushuang himself was full of desire and fanaticism for this shortcut, let alone Duan Lang.

Naturally, many top Immortal Saints in the Divine Beginning Realm were crazy about entering the Blood Wave Realm.

“The opportunity in the Blood Wave Realm is enough to drive many Immortal Saints crazy. Every time the Blood Wave Realm opens, only ten people can enter the Blood Wave Temple to get the opportunity. Therefore, the competition in the Blood Wave Realm will be unusually fierce and the killing will be extensive,” Qian Hongzi said solemnly.

“As far as I know, every time the Blood Wave Realm opens, a large number of top-notch saints participate in it. Among them, there are many top-notch Immortal Saints who are killed in the competition. Many top-notch Immortal Saints die each time, and even a few Invincible Saints are killed each time.”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

Every time the Blood Wave Realm opened, a group of top Immortal Saints would die, and even a few Invincible Saints would die.

Obviously, the competition in the Blood Wave Realm was so fierce that even Invincible Saints could not survive.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, your current realm should have reached the limit of rank six, right?”

“There are still more than eight years before the Blood Wave Realm opens. In these eight years, can you think of a way to break through to rank seven True Saint?” Qian Hongzi asked.

“Right, right now, you are only at the true level of the limit of rank six, yet you can fight Duan Lang to such an extent. If you can take another step forward and break through to become a rank seven True Saint, then when you unleash your full power, even amongst the Invincible Saints, you will probably be considered quite strong. At that time, the small team of six of us will have stronger combat power, and we will have more capital to roam around the Blood Wave Realm,” Feixue said.

The battle in the Blood Wave Realm was extremely fierce and crazy. Although six people from the Temporal Temple had entered the Blood Wave Realm together and they would form a small team, their six-man team was still in the Blood Wave Realm, they might not be able to do whatever they wanted. The stronger Jian Wushuang was, the better.

Hearing their words, Jian Wushuang could not help but smile bitterly.

“As you know, 300 years ago, I was only a rank four True Saint. The reason why I was able to reach the peak of rank six in these 300 years was mainly that I had made great progress in the space-time principles and sword principles. I could also feel the existence of bottlenecks, so after staying in the space-time tower for a period of time, I successfully broke through two realms!

“But now, I have just reached the limit of rank six. I can’t even sense the barrier in my body, so how can I break through?

“Even if I stay in the Temporal Tower for the past eight years, I’m afraid I won’t be able to break through.” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

It was not that he did not have confidence in himself, but that he had just experienced a huge breakthrough in his realm. It had only been a short time since he had reached the limit of rank six and was now a rank seven True Saint. This bottleneck was not so easy to break through.

Regarding this, Qian Hongzi, Duan Lang, and Feixue could only feel regret.

“Alright, I’ve drunk the wine. I’ve said what I should say. There are still eight more years. I don’t want to waste these eight years, so I’ll go back first.” Qian Hongzi stood up.

“I have to go cultivate too. I originally thought that among the people from my Temporal Temple who entered the Blood Wave Realm this time, my strength should still be at the middle level. I did not expect Duan Lang and Heavenly Sword Marquis to be so strong. If nothing unexpected happens now, I should be the weakest among the six. If I don’t work hard, I’ll be dragging you guys down by then.” Feixue added.

“In that case, let’s go,” Duan Lang said with a smile.

Soon, the four of them left one by one.

After leaving Duan Lang, Jian Wushuang flew alone in the void of the time-space Island, but his expression was very solemn.

“The opportunities in the Blood Wave Realm are so huge. When the time comes, the battles between countless top-notch Immortal Saints, including some Invincible Saints, will be very fierce. Although I’m not weak, with my current strength, it’s still too difficult for me to snatch the qualification to enter the Blood Wave Palace from so many top experts!”

“In addition, the Blood Wave Realm is open to all sects in the Divine Beginning Realm. Not only the Temporal Temple, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect, and many top sects in the Divine Beginning Realm, but also the First Heaven. The three Saint Realms, the four Divine Clans, and the eight directions Divine Sect will probably send experts to participate…the three Saint Realms are my mortal enemies. Once they know that I’m in the Blood Wave Realm, they will certainly come to kill me at all costs!”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.

He had reached the fourth stage of comprehending space-time principles and had mastered teleportation. He could also use space-time teleportation, which was very powerful for survival.

The Principles Masters could not enter the Blood Wave Realm at all. Even the power of the will of heaven was limited. If he stayed in the Blood Wave Realm, no one should be able to kill him. However, when he went to the Blood Wave Realm…his purpose was not only to ensure that he did not die. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

He also had to participate in the competition, and he might even fight with the three Saint Realms. Naturally, he needed to be stronger!

“I have just reached the peak of rank six. It’s almost impossible for me to make a breakthrough in the past eight years. In terms of rules, I can’t improve much in the past eight years. In the past eight years, there’s only one person who can make a huge difference in my strength!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes shone with a fierce light, he immediately rushed into the distance.

In just a moment, Jian Wushuang arrived at the True Martial Mystic Realm again.

In the vast ice field of the True Martial Mystic Realm, there stood tall icebergs.

Each of the icebergs had the names of their ancestors, which were left behind by the Principles Masters in the history of the Divine Beginning Realm.

Jian Wushuang was very familiar with the way, so he came to the base of a huge iceberg near the center.

In the middle of the iceberg, there were four characters carved with flying dragons and dancing phoenixes.

“Blood Blade Master!”

Moreover, these four characters were blood-red.

Blood Blade Master was widely recognized as the number one assassin in that era eight million years ago, and he was the king of assassins who was best at assassination.

His shadowless escape art and the Blood Blade sword art were both famous throughout the world.

During the 290 years that Jian Wushuang spent on the time-space Island, he spent most of his time in the True Martial Mystic Realm, which was under the iceberg, he saw the shadowless escape art and the Blood Blade sword art that the Blood Blade Master had left behind.

After a period of careful study and comprehension, he had mastered the shadowless escape art, but he had yet to master the Blood Blade sword art..
