4721 The Eve of the Banquet

Jian Wushuang looked around again before he finally entered meditation.

After breaking away from the past clay idol from the Divine Power Univers, he had jumped from Ancestor level to Yan Immortal.

With his strength in the Yan Immortal stage, he had not encountered a life-and-death situation for the time being in the Great Yan Domain.

Even the giant Sea Sky Octopus and the Patriarch of the Whirling Heaven did not give him a real fear of death.

Jian Wushuang vaguely guessed that only by leaving the Yan Immortal realm could he really take that step.

Not long after he sat in meditation, he seemed to realize something and reached out to take out the wordless heavenly book from his arms.

Jian Wushuang turned to the first 15 pages, which were full of tiny words. His eyes stopped on the 16th page, but there was nothing else on it except for the blank space.

“That shouldn’t be the case. Wasn’t I just having a sword duel with Cheng Qing? Why is there no indication of this in the book?”

With some suspicion, Jian Wushuang tried to transfer a wisp of the battle memory in his divine sense.

The wisp of consciousness quickly sank into the page.

Jian Wushuang was not disappointed. The wisp of spiritual awareness started to write directly. Neat, tiny words appeared on the blank page one by one.

And this time, the writing speed was extremely fast. In almost ten breaths, he had finished writing everything.

The number of pages had also changed from the original several to a thin page.

“It can’t be, right? Cheng Qing’s Sword Dao actually took so little little space of writing?” Jian Wushuang could not believe it. He quickly flipped through it and after confirming that there was only one page, he did not know whether to laugh or cry.

But immediately after, an even more mysterious scene appeared. That originally only one page of Cheng Qing’s sword technique actually disappeared line by line!

It was as if there was a pair of big hands in the dark, wiping away everything.

“No, no way. What is this?” Jian Wushuang was surprised. “Could it be that the Collection of Swords looked down on Chen Qing’s sword principle and erased it?”

Without an answer, Jian Wushuang could only watch as Chen Qing’s sword principle disappeared completely.

“What an extremely strange Collection of Swords.” He looked at the one and only copy in his hand, and at the same time, he thought that if he met someone like Ding Baiyi again in the future, wouldn’t he be able to copy it and steal his mastery?

Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly. The Collection of Swords was a heaven-defying treasure. The senior who had created it must have been an interesting guy.

After keeping the Collection of Swords, Jian Wushuang took a seat.

To him, five years was not even as long as the time he had spent fishing in the heavenly Cloud Palace.

He strived to adjust his Yan power and realm to their peak state in these five years so that he could deal with everything that would happen next.

The Boyang Bottle was also opened, and the three Emperors only wandered around Little Lonely Heaven once before returning to the bottle to sleep.

Everything went smoothly. Jian Wushuang did not know what was waiting for him, so he was forced to accept it.

Often, under the seemingly calm water, there would be undercurrents.

Five years had passed in a flash.

When the brilliant flowing light transformed by Yan power surged out from the tip of Jian Wushuang’s hair again, the boundary of Little Lonely Heaven was opened.

The Young Emperor took off his luxurious clothes and changed into the court clothes that symbolized the Prince.

On this dark gold court dress, every stroke of the threaded needle depicted mountains, rivers, lakes, and seas, symbolizing nature’s meaning.

On his collar, two small, symmetrical beasts with thin ears were embedded with dark gold threads.

This court dress made the Young Emperor lose some of his feminine charm and look more heroic and majestic, but the paleness of his face could not be hidden.

Behind him, there were nearly a thousand figures.

“Young Emperor, I’ll go and invite Brother Jian over,” Chen Qing cupped his hands and said. Then, just as he was about to move, he was suddenly called out. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“You guys wait here. I’ll go there.” After leaving these words, the Young Emperor went to the depths of Little Lonely Heaven alone.

Cheng Qing’s eyes were filled with envy. “Brother Jian is truly amazing. I, Cheng Qing, have followed the Young Emperor for so many years, but I have never seen anyone receive such treatment.”

The thin purple-robed man looked up at the Young Emperor’s figure and lowered his eyes again.

As if he had sensed something, Jian Wushuang, who was sitting in meditation, slowly opened his eyes and saw a figure floating over.

“Brother Jian, Prince Yan is here to see you.” The Young Emperor smiled and landed on the square.

After exhaling a mouthful of turbid breath, Jian Wushuang stood up and nodded.

The Young Emperor sized up Jian Wushuang and asked with interest, “How’s your recovery? ”

“Not bad, when do we leave?”

“It’s all ready, we’re just waiting for you.”

Jian Wushuang nodded. At this moment, Chun Qiu also walked out of the hall and stood behind him.

Just as he was about to leave, the Young Emperor suddenly stopped him and gave him a set of clothes.

“Change into it. The embroiderers in the Great Si Region made it for you. It’s not bad.”

Jian Wushuang felt helpless but he could not lose his temper. He had to quickly rush into the hall and change his clothes.

After a while, Jian Wushuang appeared in a long robe with silver silk embroidery.

Although the clothes made him look extraordinarily handsome, it also made him feel a little uncomfortable when he wielded his sword. It was far less comfortable than the black-robed Ranger’s clothes.

The Young Emperor’s eyes were filled with satisfaction, and he turned around to lead the way.

“Brother Jian, I didn’t expect you to look so similar to the Emperor.” Chun Qiu sized up Jian Wushuang and there was a flash of envy in his eyes.

“Don’t talk nonsense. This outfit doesn’t suit me.” Jian Wushuang laughed bitterly, loosened his belt, and stepped forward.

Chun Qiu scratched his head. “It does look a little similar to my Imperial Father’s figure in the past. It’s really strange.”

He would never have thought that this quiet young man who seemed to have endless stories was once a Cosmos God.

A total of more than 1,000 Ancestor-level top cultivators and 20 Yan Immortals stood in the void. At that moment, they revealed their true fangs that they had been hiding all along.

Outside the Six Heavens Realm, in the void of the Great Si Region, the Young Emperor looked at the figure in front of him with a rare calm gaze.

At that moment, the void of the Great Si Region was filled with the sound of footsteps.

Strange beasts that Jian Wushuang had never seen before rode the wind and came over on flowing clouds.

This strange beast was like a dragon or a sheep, with curved horns and thin ears. Its body was covered in golden scales and was engraved with cloud stripes. It was not strange, but at the same time, it was quite mysterious.

A total of 20 strange beasts and ten Imperial carriages arrived.

Each carriage had a flag with the word ‘Yan’ engraved on it.

After a long time, the Young Emperor’s calm and majestic voice resounded through the entire Great Si Region.

“Everyone, follow Prince Yan to the Heavenly Court for the banquet!”
