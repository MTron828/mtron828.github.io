Chapter 1687: Arrival!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

At a wasteland in the core region of the Eighth Lair.

Swoosh!

A figure appeared out of thin air.

It was a young man with a slightly emaciated and pale body. His body was also filled with coldness as if he were the Abysmal Hell himself.

After coming to the wasteland, he closed his eyes and waited quietly in his position.

Half a day later, another figure descended abruptly. This person was a giant-like, purple-robed old man who was close to three meters tall.

“Real God Han Quan, have I kept you waiting for a long time?” the purple-robed old man laughed heartily.

Real God Han Quan, who was the young man with a body filled with coldness, opened his eyes and looked at the person who had come, “I originally thought that you would need at least a few days to get here. However, you only took half a day. Seems like your murderous intent toward Jian Wushuang is no less than the Soaring Heaven King Palace’s.”

“Hmph, everyone knows about the grudge between me and the Lineage of Star. Since such an impressive genius has appeared in the Lineage of Star this time around, I naturally cannot allow him to continue to grow and become the second Star Palace Master of the Lineage of Star,” the purple-robed old man said coldly.

“That Jian Wushuang is indeed extremely talented. However, it’s a pity that he is too arrogant. I have gotten news that he is currently sitting down quietly somewhere in the core region and it is obvious that he is waiting for me,” Real God Han Quan said.

“Waiting for you?” the purple-robed old man raised his eyebrows.

“Previously, the Soaring Heaven King Palace gathered ten top Chaotic Real Gods which included two experts who were extremely close to the Real God ranking list so that they could team up and kill him. However, they were almost wiped out by him in the end. With such abilities, it should be enough for him to rank at the very front of the Real God ranking list and he is probably not that far from me.”

“Since our abilities are quite close, Jian Wushuang is naturally not afraid of me.” Real God Han Quan continued speaking, “However, he will never expect that apart from me, you will also be going to kill him!”

“If both of us were to team up, even if it were experts in the top ten of the Real God ranking list, we would still be able to kill them. Hence, this Jian Wushuang will definitely die,” the purple-robed old man laughed.

“Even if the both of us are unable to kill him, the Soaring Heaven King Palace has also prepared another trump card. With that, he will still die!” Real God Han Quan’s eyes were shining with a cold light.

“Since that’s the case, let’s not delay this anymore and head over there quickly,” the purple-robed old man said.

“Alright,” Real God Han Quan nodded his head. After that, both of them headed for Jian Wushuang’s location immediately.

In the barren dark land, Jian Wushuang was sitting down quietly with his legs crossed and his eyes were closed as well.

Real God Duan Yan and Real God Huan Yu stayed beside Jian Wushuang. At present, the void nearby still has many experts. All of them knew that the matter this time round would not come to an end yet.

“They have come.”

Jian Wushuang, who was sitting down on the ground with his legs crossed, opened his eyes abruptly and a shrill light flashed in his eyes.

Many experts who were near the area of void also noticed the two figures who were speeding over from afar immediately.

“Two of them?”

“One of them is Real God Han Quan. But who is the other person?”

All the experts were baffled.

In no time, the two figures which were speeding over appeared in front of them.

Among them, Real God Han Quan naturally did not require much explanation. As for the other person, he was the purple-robed old man who was close to three meters tall.

As soon as they saw the purple-robed old man, many of the experts present were shocked.

The expressions of both Real God Duan Yan and Real God Huan Yu also changed greatly.

“Jiu Gong! Monarch of Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom!”

“It’s Real God Jiu Gong!”

“Gosh, Real God Jiu Gong has come as well?”

Everyone’s faces were filled with astonishment.

Similarly, Real God Jiu Gong was an expert of the Real God ranking list. Moreover, his ranking was higher than Real God Han Quan’s!

He was a super existence who was ranked fifth on the Real God ranking list!

Furthermore, everyone knew that there was a huge grudge between Real God Jiu Gong and the Lineage of Star and the grudge could also be said to be unresolved without death!

For example, experts of the Lineage of Star dared not step into the base of Real God Jiu Gong, Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom.

Of course, Real God Jiu Gong also dared not appear in the Purple Moon Sanctuary.

However, for the clash this time around, the main characters were Jian Wushuang and the Soaring Heaven King Palace. Hence, no one expected the Soaring Heaven King Palace to actually hire Real God Jiu Gong over as well.

Two Real Gods with one ranked fifth and the other ranked eleventh on the Real God ranking list. If they were to team up, the results would be… many eyes of sympathy looked toward Jian Wushuang.

However, when Jian Wushuang saw the two experts of the Real God ranking list in front of him, hu was not flustered at all. Instead, he wore a smile.

“It will only be interesting like this.”

As Jian Wushuang laughed indifferently, he stood up slowly.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

Real God Jiu Gong and Real God Han Quan appeared in front of Jian Wushuang at the same time and they were standing less than a hundred miles away from him.

“Haha, I heard a long time ago that an exceptional Inverse Cultivator had appeared in the Lineage of Star. Today, I am finally fortunate enough to see you,” Real God Jiu Gong was laughing loudly.

“Real God Jiu Gong, we have actually met once before,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Oh?” Real God Jiu Gong frowned.

“Do you remember Real God Long Qing and his group of people who you met tens of thousands of years ago when the Blood Demon Church was destroyed in your Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom? And that within Real God Long Qing and his group of people, there was a normal person without any Divine Power?” Jian Wushuang said.

Real God Jiu Gong started to recall at once. In the next moment, his eyes turned grave, “Is that the normal old man from back then?”

“That’s right.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head, “I am the one who hired Real God Long Qing and his group of people of destruction the Blood Demon Church. However, I did not expect the Inverse Cultivation Test for the Third Heaven to descend at that point in time. Hence, I lost all my Divine Power and became an extremely weak white-haired old man. And at that point in time, I met you. However, it’s a pity that you did not recognize me.”

“Hmph, I see. Seems like I carelessly let you off back then. However, it doesn’t matter as I merely allowed you to live another tens of thousands of years longer. Today, you still have to die!” Real God Jiu Gong bellowed.

“Real God Jiu Gong, there’s no need to continue saying unnecessary things to him. Let’s attack straight away and kill him!” Real God Han Quan had a threatening and murderous look.

“All right,” Real God Jiu Gong also nodded his head earnestly.

At once, two frightening auras burst forth abruptly and they headed for Jian Wushuang right away.

The surrounding universe became quiet instantly as well.

“Jian Wushuang,” both Real God Duan Yan and Real God Huan Yu looked toward Jian Wushuang.

“This is not a battle that both of you can participate in. Please retreat to the side first,” Jian Wushuang said apathetically.

Real God Duan Yan and Real God Huan Yu looked at each other and both of them felt helpless.

Although both of them were top Chaotic Real Gods, they still do not have the right to participate in a battle between experts in the Real God ranking list. In particular, a battle between experts at the very front of the Real God ranking list.

“Please be careful.” After Real God Duan Yan spoke, he retreated far away with Real God Huan Yu.

In the dark land, Jian Wushuang was holding his Blood Mountain Sword tightly with one hand and looking at the two experts in front of him with his eyes filled with excitement.

“Come. Let me see how strong the experts ranked fifth and eleventh in the Real God ranking list are!!”
