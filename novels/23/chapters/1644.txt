Chapter 1645: Fighting The Monster King Again

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Haha. My first position is not something that be taken away from me easily. Even an Inverse Cultivator like him will not be able to do it,” the Monster King laughed gloomily and he entered the Fighting Space instantly.

“The Monster King has gone in!”

“This is going to be interesting!”

“No wonder how strong Jian Wushuang is, he is still slightly inferior compared to the Monster King.”

Many Real Gods within the wrestling ring were chatting with one another.

Within the Fighting Space, the Monster King had already come in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, do you have the guts to fight me next?” the Monster King laughed evilly.

“Why not?” Jian Wushuang was not afraid in the slightest.

“Great. When you bet a match with me back then, our stakes were twenty years of training time. Should it be the same this time round?” the Monster King said.

“I only have ten years of training time in the Fairy Palace. For the remaining ten years, I will offer you one thousand years of training time in the Thunderbolt Island, as well as a hundred Doctrine Gems as replacement,” Jian Wushuang said.

“No problem,” the Monster King nodded his head, “I heard that you defeated Real God Xian Feng with your Spacetime Doctrine. From this, it means that your level of comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine has already reached the level necessary to clear the fourth level of the Doctrine Palace?”

“That’s right,” Jian Wushuang admitted.Read more chapter on vipnovel

“You also know that what I am most proficient in is the Spacetime Doctrine. Since that is the case, let’s see whose level of comprehension is higher,” the Monster King laughed strangely and his body flashed abruptly.

With the flash, he had already disappeared.

Swoosh!

The void behind Jian Wushuang was broken open and the Monster King stepped out of it. The gloomy, cold dagger in his hands then headed toward Jian Wushuang’s head.

When Jian Wushuang had fought with the Monster King two thousand years ago, the Monster King had used the same attack and Jian Wushuang was unable to block it.

However, this time round…

Swish!

The pitch-black dagger which was emitting an infinite amount of gloom and a cold aura pierced through Jian Wushuang’s head directly. However, no blood was seen.

“A fragmentary shadow?” the Monster King raised his eyebrows.

“I will not fall for the same move twice. Moreover, I will not be defeated by the same opponent twice,” Jian Wushuang’s ice-cold voice could be heard from a void by the side. At the same time, an ice-cold sword shadow had already cut open the void and was heading toward the Monster King.

The Monster King moved sideways and the sword shadow brushed past his body.

However, at that very moment, Jian Wushuang dashed forward fiercely.

Boom!

His speed, that had caused even Real God Xian Feng to tremble with fear, was unleashed.

“Haha. I really want to see whose speed is faster,” the Monster King grinned hideously and his body moved as well.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The two shadows were shuttling back and forth within the Fighting Space. While they were moving, they also left behind strange fragmentary shadows which caused everyone to be dazzled.

Outside the Fighting Space.

“So fast!”

“Both of their speeds are fast!”

“Where are the both of them?”

Many Real Gods were watching with great concentration. However, all of a sudden, a thunder-like sound could be heard and those Real Gods looked toward the source of the sound immediately. However, they only saw that a part of the void that had burst apart completely. Moreover, even though that part of the void had just burst apart, another part of the void which was a thousand miles away had twisted open as well. At the same time, a sword shadow appeared and split the universe into two halves.

Another explosive sound could be heard. However, this time around, the sound came from the edge of the Fighting Space.

Speed!

This was a duel in terms of speed.

“Haha. Jian Wushuang, after not seeing you for two thousand years, your level of comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine has indeed risen by quite a lot. However, it’s a pity that this kind of speed is still not enough,” the Monster King’s voice could be heard. However, the people outside the Fighting Space had absolutely no idea where the Monster King was.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang grinned. He then stopped hiding his Power of Spacetime and unleashed it completely.

It should be known that the Power of Spacetime that Jian Wushuang had unleashed from the start until then was only at the standard that had just cleared the fourth level of the Doctrine Palace.

However, at that very moment, he had gone all out with his Power of Spacetime, which was already extremely near to clearing the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace.

Boom!

Jian Wushuang moved around crazily like a shooting star and his speed was at least three times faster than before!

“What?”

The Monster King’s expression changed slightly. His eyes then turned grave straight away as he realized that the speed that Jian Wushuang had just displayed was actually slightly faster than him.

Puff!

Jian Wushuang’s body appeared and he swung the Blood Mountain Sword on his hands straight away.

Swish! Swish! Swish!

A total of ten strokes were swung out in an instant. Every stroke was so fast that it was unbelievable and they were just like shooting stars.

The Monster King’s eyes turned cold. At the next moment, a great amount of purple thunderbolts rose from his body and spread across the surrounding with a shocking speed. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The purple thunderbolts contained extremely violent power. In just an instant, they had covered the whole Fighting Space and changed it into a vast purple thunder pond.

As for the dagger on the Monster King’s hands, it was accumulating a great amount of Thunderbolt Power. He then attacked with the dagger.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

Many loud sounds could be heard. The Monster King had already unleashed his full power.

However, after tens of clashes, his body could no longer take it and he was sent flying by the impact.

“How is this possible?” the Monster King’s face was filled with fear, “I actually lost in a clash of power?”

The Monster King was totally unable to believe what had happened.

He had comprehended two Heaven Ways at the same time, namely the Spacetime Doctrine and the Sacred Thunder Doctrine.

Moreover, the Sacred Thunder Doctrine was the same as the Extermination Doctrine of the Supreme Four Doctrine which focused mainly on attack power. His comprehension of the Sacred Thunder Doctrine had already achieved the standards to clear the fourth level of the Doctrine Palace as well. Under such circumstances, when his attack which contained the full power of the Sacred Thunder Doctrine clashed with Jian Wushuang’s Sword Principles, the end result was actually him being sent flying?

“This is the Thunderbolt Island and our Divine Power is the same. Even if he is an Inverse Cultivator, he should only be able to unleash the Divine Power at the level of a normal Void Real God as well. However, in a head-on clash in terms of power, he actually pushed me back? Could it be… his comprehension of the Reincarnation Doctrine has also achieved the standard necessary to clear the fourth level of the Doctrine Palace and it might even be at a higher level?” as the Monster King thought about that, his whole face was filled with astonishment.

He knew that Jian Wushuang had comprehended the Spacetime Doctrine and Reincarnation Doctrine at the same time.

In terms of power, the Reincarnation Doctrine was slightly inferior to the Extermination Doctrine and the Sacred Thunder Doctrine, whose main focuses were on attack power. However, Jian Wushuang had still sent him flying and this could only mean that Jian Wushuang’s level of comprehension of the Reincarnation Doctrine was higher than his level of comprehension of the Sacred Thunder Doctrine.

“Since his speed is slightly faster than mine, his level of comprehension should be at a higher level than mine. But now, even his level of comprehension of the Reincarnation Doctrine is this high?” the Monster King had already started to feel anxious.

As for Jian Wushuang, he had already unleashed his speed completely and he was using his Sword Principles repeatedly.

With such speed, the Monster King could only rely on some of his own techniques to sustain himself with difficulty. He even relied on his comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine to shuttle back and forth within the Fighting Space. With this, he avoided Jian Wushuang completely and it was obvious that he wanted to play ‘hide-and-seek’ with Jian Wushuang.

He would hide and Jian Wushuang would chase after him.
