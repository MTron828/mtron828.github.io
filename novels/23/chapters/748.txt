Chapter 749: The Scarlet Eye

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Clank!”

A thunderous clank sounded.

Wu Dao’s chilling smile suddenly stiffened. In the next moment, his smile was replaced by shock and consternation.

He felt a strong force that he had never experienced before pushing him upwards. The saber in his hand was instantly tossed aside in the air. The horrible force landed on his arms and crushed them inch by inch. Then, it spread to his insides.

“Splat!”

A stream of blood squirted out from his mouth. His body was thrown backward like a kite with its string cut off. His aura began to thin.

“He’s still alive?” Jian Wushuang was slightly taken aback.

His attack was no less powerful than the one he’d launched at the white-haired elder. The elder had been at Step One of the Eternal Realm, but he had been unable to avoid being seriously injured. Wu Dao was way below Step One of the Eternal Realm. Normally, this attack should be more than enough to kill him.

However, it was evident that in spite of Wu Dao’s unprecedented severe injuries, his Life Core was not shattered. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

An expert in the Eternal Realm would not die as long as his Life Core was intact.

“Run! Run for it!”

Soaked in blood, Wu Dao, whose face was too miserable to look at, regained his balance and stood up. Without hesitation, he wheeled around and fled.

“You can’t escape!”

Jian Wushuang growled, his face frosty. He started chasing Wu Dao. He was extremely swift, much faster than Wu Dao.

Jian Wushuang was not much better than Wu Dao at running. But since Wu Dao was severely injured, there was a serious dent in his speed.

“Damn it!”

Jian Wushuang was getting closer and closer. Wu Dao’s pale face became even more gloomy.

“I have to make a move!” Wu Dao clenched his teeth, and a stream of blood surged up inside his body.

The next moment, 17 figures who looked exactly like Wu Dao jumped out.

A total of 18 ‘Wu Daos’ appeared before Jian Wushuang. Their appearances and aura were exactly the same. It was impossible to tell them apart with the naked eye.

They swiftly fled in different directions. They were extraordinarily fast.

“This move again?”

Jian Wushuang’s pupils contracted. He was not surprised at all.

A hundred years ago, Wu Dao had walked into his trap, hunted by a Gold-armored Ancient God. He had cast the same move in order to run for his life.

But back then, he could only conjure eight doppelgangers. Now, he could produce 17. His chance of survival had increased significantly.

“All 18 figures are exactly the same. Indeed, I cannot distinguish the true one from the others. As long as his Original Body is alive, it’s useless to kill his doppelgangers. What a smart move.”

Jian Wushuang nodded. He then tittered, “Unfortunately, it’s not going to work on me!”

Jian Wushuang’s face was stony, his eyes transfixed upon the 18 ‘Wu Daos’ who were running away from him frantically. Between his eyebrows, a scarlet mark emerged. It looked like a vertical crack; it was slowly widening. An eerie blood-red upside down eye suddenly opened.

“Secret Skill, the Scarlet Eye!”

A jet of blazing blood-red light shot out of the eye and swept across the 18 figures ahead.

It was the Scarlet Eye Secret Skill, one of the Ancient God Clan’s top three Secret Skills. It was devised to penetrate all sorts of illusions.

“There’s his Original Body!”

Jian Wushuang targeted one of the figures.

He fixed his eyes on Wu Dao’s Original Body.

“How can it be?”

Seeing Jian Wushuang go straight for him without being disturbed by the 17 doppelgangers he’d conjured, Wu Dao lost his poise.

“How, how did he see through my Original Body and doppelgangers?” Wu Dao found this utterly inconceivable. A sense of terror came over him.

In his entire life, he had only felt this kind of overbearing terror once.

It had been during the last fight with Xuan Yi. Xuan Yi had grabbed him and taken control of his mind. He had been as horror-stricken then as he was now.

Today, he was once again gripped by this terror.

“You have no way to escape!”

Jian Wushuang’s icy voice sounded in Wu Dao’s ears. A huge sword shadow hacked down on him.

The sword shadow was so dazzling that Wu Dao had to narrow his eyes. He frantically wielded his saber in an attempt to resist the attack. But…”Boom!”

An explosion erupted. Wu Dao’s body plummeted downwards like a meteorite. It landed hard on the ground, producing a huge pit that measured 300 meters across.

At the center of the huge pit, Wu Dao’s body had almost been blasted into pieces. His Life Core was also damaged, but it had not shattered yet.

Wu Dao just lay there, struggling helplessly to get to his feet.

“Whoosh!”

Jian Wushuang zoomed in and looked down at him condescendingly.

“I assume you guys from the Cloud Sea Asgard have set up secret assembly sites in the Tianqi Mountains. Where are they?” Jian Wushuang asked.

When experts from assorted Sects of the Firmament Territory entered the Eternal Zone, they often turned up at a certain place in the Tianqi Mountains. Their Messaging Slips could not function in the Eternal Zone, so the sects circled out secret assembly sites to exchange messages.

“Humph, you really think I’ll tell you?” Wu Dao sneered, his eyes already filled with despair.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. “You think as long as you don’t tell me I can’t figure it out?”

“Wu Dao, you just made a breakthrough and reached the Eternal Realm. This is your first time in the Tianqi Mountains. Unlike other experts from the Cloud Sea Asgards who have traveled the Tianqi Mountains several times, you’re completely ignorant of the environment and topography of the Tianqi Mountains.”

“So, you must be carrying the map the Cloud Sea Asgard drew for you. The Cloud Sea Asgard’s secret assembly sites ought to be marked on the map, am I right?”

Jian Wushuang smiled blandly. Wu Dao was thoroughly terrified.

“How?”

“How do you know this?”

“How come you know my name? You know I’m from the Cloud Sea Asgard? And you even know I just entered the Eternal Realm?”

“Are you a Demon God? No, the Demon God Clan couldn’t have learned these things!”

“Who on earth are you?”

Lying on his back, Wu Dao barked desperately, staring at Jian Wushuang.

Looking down at Wu Dao, Jian Wushuang smirked coldly, slowly took down his mask, and unveiled a handsome but stern face.
