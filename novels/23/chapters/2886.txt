Chapter 2887: The Window Paper Was Broken

——

There was no human figure in the empty shadow. What was left was a divine sword, a piece of armor, and an interspatial ring.

The divine sword was naturally the Blood Mountain Sword.

The armor was the gold-colored battle record.

The interspatial ring, of course, was Jian Wushuang’s interspatial ring.

Seeing this, Realm Lord Tian Qu, Heavenly Void Temple Master, and Elder Su all smiled.

The countless cultivators watching the battle in the market sighed secretly.

“He’s dead. Although he showed shocking techniques, he still died in the end.”

“There’s no other way. No matter what, he’s only a Divine Master. It’s incredible that he can do this. After all, there were three Immortal Saints who surrounded and killed him. Moreover, these three Immortal Saints have clearly used their strongest techniques without holding back.”

“Although he is dead, Jian Yi is still famous in the Golden Crow Nine Realms.”

Many cultivators were talking about Jian Wushuang, but all of them had high respect for him.

They admired him for his strength!

But at this moment…

“No.”

A Peak Great Divine Master in the market suddenly frowned and said, “Jian Yi is dead, but why didn’t he put away the treasure that could change the world? Why did it always exist?”

The doubts of this Peak Great Divine Master were soon noticed by everyone.

Not only them, on the battlefield, Realm Lord Tian Qu, Temple Master Tian Xu, and Elder Su also frowned slightly.

They also noticed it.

Above them, the lifelike scroll world was still there.

The huge sword tomb and the Sword Principle World were still surrounding them.

Even the domain that had been released from Jian Wushuang’s body was still suppressing them.

However, it was Jian Wushuang who had used all these techniques.

If Jian Wushuang really died, then his techniques would stop immediately without anyone controlling them.

But now…

“Could it be?” Elder Su’s pupils suddenly shrank.

In the next moment, they saw endless divine power began to condense crazily beside the Blood Mountain Sword in the empty void. The divine power was too vast and boundless, it made the three Immortal Saints, World Master Tian Qu, Heavenly Void Temple Master, and Elder Su, feel inferior.

As the divine power gathered crazily, a figure slowly formed in the blink of an eye.

This figure was Jian Wushuang!

“Divine power, divine power recombination?”

World Master Tian Qu, Heavenly Void Temple Master, and Elder Su, the three Immortal Saints, instantly widened their eyes, and their scalps seemed to be about to explode.

As Immortal Saints, they knew what was happening.

It was because they knew that they were shocked and did not dare to believe it.

The countless cultivators in the market were also completely stunned.

Countless eyes looking at Jian Wushuang became empty and incredulous.

The entire world fell silent at this moment.

Dead silence!

After a long time, the experienced expert at the Peak of the Divine Master realm in the market was the first to speak.

“Immortal, this is the immortal body!”

As the words ‘immortal body’ rang out, the whole world was in an uproar.

Realm Lord Tian Qu, Heavenly Void Temple Master, and Elder Su were also completely stunned.

Immortal body!

Indeed, Jian Wushuang’s divine body had been completely destroyed by Realm Lord Tian Qu’s most powerful killing move. Under normal circumstances, he should have been dead. However, Jian Wushuang’s divine body had been restored, it was restored.

It was an immortal body that only Immortal Saints possessed!

Most importantly, not all Immortal Saints possessed an immortal body.

Realm Lord Tian Qu, Heavenly Void Temple Master, and Elder Su did not have an immortal body. They had not reached the level of forming an immortal body.

Not to mention the three of them, in the entire Golden Crow Nine Realms, there was only one known Immortal Saint who had an undying body, and that was the supreme Lord Bone Emperor! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Other than the Bone Emperor, the three of them had never heard of anyone possessing an immortal body.

The ability of this immortal body made the three of them extremely envious.

But now, the power that the three of them had never mastered was used by a Divine Master. How was this possible?

How could the three of them not be shocked?

“It’s the first time I’ve heard that a Divine Master has an immortal body!” Elder Su said in shock.

“My God, what kind of monster are we going to kill? Not only is a Divine Master so powerful, but he also has an immortal body?” Heavenly Void Palace Master was also stunned.

As for Realm Master Tian Qu, his face was extremely pale.

They knew that Jian Wushuang had an immortal body, but they knew how terrifying it was. It was obviously impossible for them to kill Jian Wushuang with an immortal body.

The world was shocked.

Everyone was shocked by Jian Wushuang’s immortal body.

However, while everyone was in shock, no one noticed that Jian Wushuang, whose divine body had reformed, did not open his eyes immediately. Instead, he continued to close his eyes, and there was a hint of surprise at the corner of his mouth.

Yes, it was a surprise!

When he was in the market, he knew that his comprehension of sword principle had reached a bottleneck. He was only one step away from that bottleneck.

He hoped that someone could help him break through this bottleneck, so he was eager to fight!

He knew that Realm Lord Tian Qu would certainly be prepared to deal with him, but he did not hesitate to leave the market to face Realm Lord Tian Qu head-on.

Even when he learned that the Realm Lord and the other three Immortal Saints had joined forces, he was not afraid at all. He did not have the slightest intention of retreating. Instead, he used all his strength to fight against the three Immortal Saints.

What was his goal?

His goal was that layer of window paper.

And now, the three Immortal Saints were all using their strongest techniques, especially the Realm Lord’s strongest technique. It directly shattered his layers of defense, crushing his divine body. He then relied on his divine power to condense his divine body.

He was born from death!

His window was finally broken.

“Sword principle!”

Jian Wushuang was extremely excited. At this moment, in the Sword World that was opened up in his body for 100,000 miles.

This vast Sword World was originally a desolate place without any substance or life.

However, at this moment, in the center of the Sword World, a sapling had already taken root and sprouted!
