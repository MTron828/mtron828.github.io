Chapter 5186 - 5186: Blood Jade Palace

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

MO Long possessed the Seal of Suppression, along with the transcendent innate high-grade treasure, the Zheng Jade Tower. Both treasures had the power to suppress; the Seal of Suppression was akin to a mobile miniature formation.

In times of danger, he could take refuge within it. Jian Wushuang, however, had no such treasures now. He only had an ordinary long sword, not a single one of the Grand Yan Immortals he killed possessed any exceptional abilities or treasures.

Ever since witnessing the treasures of God-Emperor MO Long, Jian Wushuangs horizons had broadened. What he had once coveted as supreme treasures seemed trivial now. Aside from peak treasures, all other treasures appeared as worthless as scrap metal.Alll ùíçùíÇtest novùíÜlùíî on novelbùíän/(.)cùíêm

That crimson crystal pillar sent shivers down Jian Wushuangs spine. That thing was definitely not something benign.

Hu Qing, upon hearing Jian Wushuangs words, rushed forward attempting to stop God-Emperor MO Long. However, he was too late. God-Emperor MO

Long placed the crimson crystal pillar into the groove on top of the Zheng Jade Tower.

A surge of blood-red light began to rise. The crimson crystal pillar was not the destructive god crystal Jian Wushuang had imagined. It didn‚Äôt explode.

Instead, it transformed into a stream of blood, pouring onto the top of the Zheng Jade Tower.

This stream of blood flowed down the top of the tower, irrigating the entire structure before dripping onto the Seal of Suppression.

The blood merged into the eight array eyes, and a scarlet mist started to rise. God-Emperor MO Longs eyes turned bloodshot.

Under the irrigation of the blood, the Seal of Suppression unexpectedly fused with the Zheng Jade Tower!

‚ÄúThis is my father‚Äôs transcendent innate treasure that ruled the world. You have the privilege of witnessing the might of the Blood Jade Palace. Consider yourselves fortunate!‚Äù Even God-Emperor MO Long hadn‚Äôt anticipated that this was only the first step of the trial, forcing him to reveal his ultimate card.

If the ancient treasure, the ‚ÄòEye of the Beast God‚Äô, was an item used to enhance one‚Äôs strength, then this ‚ÄòBlood Jade Palace‚Äô was the life-saving treasure his father had bequeathed him.

Although the Eye of the Beast God possessed extraordinary power, there was no similar treasure in the entire Original Universe. It was an ancient treasure his father had acquired from the River of Time and Space. Despite its unique power, once one reached the level of a tier 4 Emperor, his father found no use for it.

He was bestowed with it. Few knew the true posmer of this secret treasure; if its secrets were revealed, even tier 3 Emperors would go mad with desire.

At the Emperor level, treasures that could enhance an Emperor‚Äôs strength were never put up for sale; even if they were, the prices would be exorbitant.

The Blood Jade Palace was undoubtedly the pinnacle among innate treasures, the most precious palace-type treasure in existence.

MO Longs father had roamed the Original Universe with it, even drifting through the River of Time and Space. If not for the Qishen Temple, he wouldn‚Äôt have given such a treasure to his son.

This treasure was akin to an adult gifting a spirited horse to a three-year-old child; it was simply squandering a priceless gem!

MO Long lacked the ability to control the Blood Jade Palace; it was only because his father condensed his own crystalized blood essence that he could partially unleash the palace‚Äôs power.

Nevertheless, this power was enough for him to maintain secrecy.

Jian Wushuang stared at the Blood Jade Palace, his astonishment deepening.

This treasure, something he had never seen before, MO Long, the God-Emperor, had several of them.

MO Long hadn‚Äôt anticipated that killing a Six Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal would be this difficult, nor did he foresee that in such advantageous circumstances, he would be so unlucky as to encounter God-Emperor MO Long, a peak expert who was over five hundred places ahead of him.

The Blood Jade Palace felt unshakable to him.

If God-Emperor MO Long escaped sitting on the Blood Jade Palace, the grand array wouldn‚Äôt stop him, and neither would his One Thought Universe.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so close!‚Äù Jian Wushuangs eyes narrowed to pinpricks. After a lot of effort, he couldn‚Äôt catch anything, and now he had to watch MO Long escape on the Blood Jade Palace.

This was hard for Jian Wushuang to accept. Even with a strong mentality and the ability to see through everything, he sighed internally.

Hu Qing, on the other hand, remained calm. His power had grown rapidly; he had already reached the peak of Grand Yan Immortal. Even if this plan failed, he could still go outside and kill other Nine Revolutions with his strength to gain achievements.

Although he was now a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal and could only get ten times the points, with a bit of luck, if he managed to kill a group of Perfected Nine Revolutions, he might enter the top 100. After all, he had just killed Luo Hao, gaining a significant achievement and entering the top 1,000. ‚ÄúBrother Wushuang, it‚Äôs irreversible!‚Äù Hu Qing had a glimpse of enlightenment and calculated the development of the situation. They couldn‚Äôt shake the power of the Blood Jade Palace. If they forcefully attacked, they might be counterattacked.

Jian Wushuang floated in mid-air, nine long swords returning to his side. He didn‚Äôt speak, just nodded.

The Wuliang Grand Formation was riddled with holes; this move was ineffective. If MO Long could really escape, they would have to find another way out.

Although this place was deep in the mountains, such a big commotion might have already been reported to the main continent by those weaker Perfected Nine Revolutions who stayed behind in the mountains.

Since Daluo Realm had left Luo Hao in the mountains, other forces must have had spies hidden deep in the mountains to observe the situation. After all, the mountains occupied 90 percent of the opriginal planet‚Äôs territory.

‚ÄúWhy, afraid to attack me?‚Äù MO Long sneered while sitting on the throne.

If Jian Wushuang and the others didn‚Äôt attack the Blood Jade Palace, MO Long truly had no way to deal with them!

MO Longs strength couldn‚Äôt control the Blood Jade Palace. If he wanted the Blood Jade Palace to suppress his opponents, he had to make them attack the Blood Jade Palace first.

As a peak-level transcendent innate treasure, the Blood Jade Palace had self-defense capabilities. When attacked by a strong enemy, it would automatically raise a blood shield. Not only could it defend the Blood Jade Palace itself, but it could also shoot out blood pillars to kill enemies attacking the Blood Jade Palace.

However, once the power of the crimson crystal pillars was depleted, the blood shield would dissipate.

‚ÄúNo more words?‚Äù MO Long kept raising the Blood Jade Palace higher!

The Wuliang Grand Formation trembled and was shattered by the blood pillars.

Hu Qing controlled the grand array, trying to hold off the Blood Jade Palace for as long as possible.

This was a super strong individual ranking in the top 500. If he escaped now, they would suffer a significant loss. They had to delay him as much as possible.

His mind moved, and the information from the identity token flowed into his mind.

Trial Participant: Hu Qing

Cultivation: Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal

Achievements:1,040,0

Ranking: 716

This ranking wasn‚Äôt very stable even within the top 1,000, let alone breaking into the top 100.

When he killed a Perfected Nine Revolutions, he gained 100,000 achievement points. Coupled with the points he obtained from Luo Hao, which numbered in the millions, multiplied by ten, it became over ten million achievement points.

Some of these were shared with MO Long and Jian Wushuang, considering their respective contributions based on the damage they caused..
