Chapter 774: Shameless!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Buzz…

The invisible power dissipated as the vast black sky immediately vanished. Jian Wushuang looked up but saw the blade light unleashed by Saber Master.

Old Weirdo Dream was behind Saber Master and her face darkened as she stared at the boy in shock. “He has actually broken my strongest move, Eternal Dream. How is this possible?”

Although it sounded impossible, Jian Wushuang made it happened.

Nevertheless, it took him a while to break the illusion, which gave Yun Fan an opportunity to launch a sneak attack. Seeing Jian Wushuang break out from the illusion, Yun Fan immediately opened his mouth and snarled at Jian Wushuang.

This snarl created multiple soundwaves, which formed a Sound Wave Attack that was headed straight for Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had experienced the Sound Wave Attack before, so he had already set shields inside his body in preparation for the attack. Surrounded by the sound waves, he only felt his blood racing through his veins, which caused no harm.

But at this point in time, the blade light that Saber Master unleashed finally arrived.

Yun Fan and Old Weirdo Dream stared deadly at the streak of blade light.

Be it Old Weirdo Dream’s illusion or Yun Fan’s Sound Wave Attack, they all created an opportunity for Saber Master’s strongest blade light.

Jian Wushuang had just disentangled himself from the illusion and Sound Wave Attack, but the blade light was now right under his nose.

It was so close that even Jian Wushuang was unable to deflect this in time. He could only protect himself by putting the Emperor Sword in front of his chest.

Boom!

The huge blade light with terrifying power violently crashed into the Emperor Sword. The immense force caused Jian Wushuang to fall back against the ground violently.

This surge of power spread from Jian Wushuang’s arm into his whole body.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang let out a muffled groan, and a trickle of blood oozed out of his mouth. However, his aura had not weakened.

Jian Wushuang was standing quietly in his huge figure. He wiped away the blood from the corner of his mouth before he looked at his opponents with a frosty look.

“Hehe, first it’s the Illusion Attack. Then, it’s the Sound Wave Attack. Last but not least, we have an extreme offensive power attack. Hehe, the three of you cooperate well.” Jian Wushuang’s hearty laughter echoed the entire area.

“What?”?Yun Fan was astonished.

“He broke the illusion instantly, withstood the Sound Wave Attack, and parry my attack in time?”?Saber Master was very astonished.

“All of us displayed our strongest move and worked really well together for the first time, but eventually we can’t hurt him for real?”?Old Weirdo Dream was also petrified.

They could not imagine that Jian Wushuang could manage to take in their attacks, and only suffered a minor injury.

Those were their best moves.

Old Weirdo Dream was the proudest of her Eternal Dream, as the illusion she made looked immensely real. If ordinary Eternal Realm experts fell into it, they would be unable to disentangle themselves from it within 10 breaths.

This skill of hers caused others to be in awe of her.

Yun Fan and Saber Master were both much stronger than her, but they were afraid of this skill of hers.

She initially thought that Jian Wushuang would be stuck in the illusion for at least enough time for Yun Fan and Saber Master to give the boy a good thump, but who would have thought… Eventually, Jian Wushuang broke through the illusion in the blink of an eye.

However, it was normal that Jian Wushuang was capable of warding off the Sound Wave Attack. He had done this when Yun Fan displayed it for the first time, so it was easier for him to withstand it with some preparation.

However, it was simply unbelievable that Jian Wushuang could still parry the blade light after the former two strikes.

Saber Master frowned and asked in a low voice, “Our three strikes did not hurt him at all, what shall we do?”

“This boy is just a Divine Realm expert, but his strength is far beyond our expectation. The three of us can only suppress him at most,” Yun Fan said with a gloomy look. “So if we want to catch him, there is only one way.”

Yun Fan was deep in thoughts for a long time.?He then turned towards the Cloud Sea Asgard camp suddenly and growled in a low voice, “Elders, let’s join hands together to catch Jian Wushuang.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Upon hearing this, Saber Master and Old Weirdo Dream were stunned. Then, both of them gritted their teeth and made up their mind.

Saber Master said solemnly, “Everyone from the Immortal Dynasty, come help us to bring him down.”

“Everyone from the Boundless Demon Sect, join us too.” Old Weirdo Dream also shouted.

The three magnates had sent numerous Eternal Realm experts here. Although many of them were killed in the Tianqi Mountains, there were still more than 20 experts left.

Although their strength varied from Step One to Step Three, they were Eternal Realm experts after all!

The other experts from the three magnates hesitated for a while, but they eventually started moving.

More than 20 figures started darting towards Jian Wushuang at the same time.

The experts from the other sects were shocked.

“What are they doing?”

“Yun Fan, Saber Master, and Old Weirdo Dream are known as the supreme experts in the Firmament Territory. Jian Wushuang is only a Divine Realm expert. Just any one of them fighting him is already considered bullying, it’s even ridiculous that they’re working together to fight the boy! But now they actually called all the Eternal Realm experts from their sects to help them?”

“Don’t the three magnates feel ashamed?”

“They’re going too far!”

Many experts from the other sects cursed the three magnates.

“Shameless, shameless!”

The nine Palace Masters from the Ancient Sect started scolding them.

“Cloud Sea Asgard, Immortal Dynasty and Boundless Demon Sect, you three are the three magnates in the Firmament Territory. But now, the supreme experts ask all of your Eternal Realm experts to attack our Ancient Sect’s disciple who is only a Divine Realm expert. Shame on all of you! You have brought shame to your sects’ names!”

“Haha, the three magnates turn out to be like this.”

“I already knew that the three magnates are shameless, but I didn’t know it is to this extent!”

The nine Palace Masters raged about it, but as Palace Master Xuan Yi had ordered, they did not intend to interfere in this matter, no matter how unfair it was.
