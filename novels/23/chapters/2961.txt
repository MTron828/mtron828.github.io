Chapter 2962: Divine Power Fruit

“A waste?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“It is indeed a waste,” Lord Tianshuo said, “If you need to accumulate and improve your divine power, there are divine power fruits in my Treasure Pavilion that are specially used to improve your divine power. These divine power fruits are available at all levels and are tailored to the needs of different levels. You are only a Divine Master now, so ordinary divine power fruits should be enough for you.”

“How much divine power does an ordinary divine power fruit contain?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“One is worth 100,000 sacred elixirs, and it’s even purer. As for the price, I can exchange 10,000 sacred elixirs for an ordinary divine power fruit,” Lord Tianshou said.

“One is worth 100,000 sacred elixirs? and the price is only 10,000 sacred elixirs?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He finally understood that Lord Tianshou and Xue Dong King would say that he had wasted it.

It was more than a waste, it was a waste of a treasure.

“Damn, I’ve absorbed so many saint elixirs. If I exchange them all for divine power fruits…” Jian Wushuang looked strange, but then he said seriously, “Lord Tianshou, an ordinary divine power fruit is worth 100,000 saint elixirs. What about a higher-level one?”

“A higher-level one…has an earth-level divine power fruit. It’s more than enough for an ordinary False Saint or a weaker True Saint. As for its effect, one is worth about 3 million sacred elixirs. It’s worth 100,000 sacred elixirs,” Sir Tianshuo said.

Jian Wushuang’s heart trembled, but he was pleasantly surprised!

He was surprised that he had been too wasteful. He was happy with the effect of the earth-level divine power fruit.

One fruit was equivalent to absorbing three million sacred elixirs. How much divine power was that?

“I’m not too far away from the peak of the Great Divine Master. According to what I thought before, I should be able to break through after absorbing at most 20 million sacred elixirs. But now, this divine power fruit…” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a strange light, he immediately said, “Lord Tianshou, give me 20 earth-grade divine power fruits first!”

“20?” Sir Tianshuo raised his eyebrows.

Xue Dong King looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise and said, “Brother Heavenly Marquis, one earth-grade divine power fruit is equivalent to absorbing 3 million sacred elixirs. 20 is the divine power of 60 million sacred elixirs. Why do you need so many?”

“I have my uses.” Jian Wushuang did not explain much.

“Earth-grade divine power fruit, 100,000 sacred elixirs per fruit, 20 would be 2 million sacred elixirs. You still have 48 million sacred elixirs left,” Lord Tianshuo said.

“Lord Tianshuo, I need a special sword formation. I don’t know if you have it,” Jian Wushuang said. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Sword formation? What sword formation?” Lord Tianshuo looked over.

“The reincarnation sword formation was created by an expert named Sword Master Tongxin. Sword Master Tongxin was almost invincible among the Immortal Saints when he was alive. He created a total of 12 reincarnation sword formations…” Jian Wushuang explained the information of the reincarnation sword formation in detail.

The Samsara Sword Formation had been of great help to him since he got it.

He had comprehended the space-time and reincarnation rules at the same time. In terms of the space-time rules, the swordsmanship he created was focused on space-time.

In terms of the reincarnation rules, he relied on the samsara sword formation to perfectly displaying his comprehension of the reincarnation rules.

However, he had only obtained the first four layers of the Samsara Sword Formation. He could now use the fourth layer of the ice and snow world, and he could also use its strongest power.

At this time, of course, he was eager to get more powerful sword formations.

“Wait a moment.”

Lord Tianshou immediately began to investigate.

There was nothing he could do. There were too many treasures in the Treasure Pavilion. Take the Samsara Sword Formation for example. There were hundreds of sword formations in the Treasure Pavilion that were also named after samsara. Even if Lord Tianshou was the treasure spirit of the Treasure Pavilion, he had to check carefully.

A moment later, he looked at Jian Wushuang again, “I found it. The Reincarnation Sword Formation you asked for does exist in the Treasure Pavilion, and it has a complete 12 sword formations. Among the 12 sword formations, the first four require the permission of an ordinary member, but the middle four require the permission of an earth-level member. As for the strongest sword formation, the last four require the permission of a heaven-level member.”

Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He already had the first four levels of the 12 Samsara Sword Formations, so he naturally needed the middle four levels. However, he did not expect the middle four levels to have such high authority. They needed the earth level, and the last four levels needed the authority of a heaven level member…

However, Jian Wushuang thought about it carefully and could understand.

Sword Master Tongxin was, after all, an almost Invincible Immortal Saint. His strength was extremely terrifying, and the Samsara Sword Formation he created was the basis of his fame. It was extremely powerful, which could be seen from the first four levels alone.

It was normal for such a powerful sword formation to have a higher exchange authority.

“Lord Tianshuo, how many Sacred Elixirs do you need to exchange for the middle four levels of the Samsara Sword Formation?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“15 million!” Lord Tianshuo said.

Jian Wushuang nodded secretly.

1500 sacred elixirs were not too expensive to exchange for the middle four levels of the Samsara Sword Formation.

“Since I can’t exchange for the medium-four sword formation now, forget it. Anyway, with my current strength, it shouldn’t be difficult for me to become an earth-level member. I can keep these Sacred Lands for now. When I become an earth-level member in the future, I can exchange for them.” Jian Wushuang smiled. “However, although I can’t exchange for the sword formation, I can exchange for the magic weapons that drive the sword formation.”

Previously, Jian Wushuang had used 18 Netherblood Divine Swords to drive the sword formation.

Each of the 18 Netherblood Divine Swords was a top-tier heavenly treasure, and their power was extraordinary.

However, as Jian Wushuang’s strength continued to increase, it was difficult for him to satisfy his needs with just the top-tier heavenly treasures.

The most important thing was that he had received a huge sum of 50 million sacred elixirs in one go, which made him very confident. In order to increase the power of the reincarnation sword formation, he really wanted to exchange the 18 Netherblood divine swords again.

“Sir Tianshou, I need a set of standard divine weapons of the holy treasure level, all of which are divine swords. The size should be based on the Netherblood divine sword in my hand. It would be even better if I have a divine weapon of the holy treasure level.” Jian Wushuang took out Netherblood divine sword.

“I don’t have a divine weapon of the holy treasure level in my Treasure Pavilion, but I can find a replacement for it. As for the price, it’s 200,000 for an ordinary third-grade divine weapon, 600,000 for an advanced third-grade divine weapon, and 1,500,000 for a superior third-grade divine weapon. You can choose one yourself,” Sir Tianshou said.

Of course, Jian Wushuang would prefer a superior third-grade standard magic weapon of 1.5 million.

However, he needed a total of 18 such standard magic weapons. If he had 1.5 million each, it would add up to…27 million sacred elixirs!
