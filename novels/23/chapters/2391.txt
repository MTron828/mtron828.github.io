Chapter 2392:

Admonishment

Jian Wushuang stood there watching Miss Xiao and Little Li leave while wearing a wry smile.

He could see that his new ally had a sense of dislike towards him.

Surely, it was because of his abilities.

“Abilities!”

Looks like I need to restore my peak condition as soon as I can and improve my abilities. Otherwise, I really wouldn’t be qualified to become her ally.”

Jian Wushuang sighed but very soon calmed himself down.

On the other hand, Miss Xiao and Little Li were on their way back to Hundred Flowers Tower.

Along the way...

“Miss, do we really want to forge an alliance with that Jian Wushuang character?” asked a puzzled Little Li.

Miss Xiao took a glance at Little Li. “Or else? Because of his relationship with Seven Stars Black Sect, I can’t possibly kill him. Other than that, his mind was really sharp, being able to see so many things within such a short time. His ability was still a little weak, but one has to know that everybody starts from being weak before reaching the peak. Even the high and mighty Master of Divine Realms is also the same.”

You have also witnessed his gift. Being a Middle Stage Chaotic Realm, he could cut down Second-Class Divine Demons. Although assisted by two secret skills of Seven Stars Black Sect, the mere fact that he could achieve that proves he is unusual. He may not be of any use to us currently, but who knows if we might really be able to use him.”

Little Li said, “Understood. After we get back, I’ll send someone to watch him closely.”

Miss Xiao waved her hand, “No need. No need to pay attention to him, just let him be. Our target right now is Mu Clan. The clan has been around for so long, it’s time for them to disappear.”

...

In the empty field half a day later, Xiao Heng and the four core disciples who fainted gradually regained their consciousness.

“What happened?”

“What...happened to me?”

They were all puzzled.

Looking around them, the corpses were all cleaned up and Jian Wushuang was just casually sitting on the side. As for Miss Xiao and her maid, they were long gone.

“Senior Brothers, you’re awake.” Jian Wushuang looked over. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Junior Brother Jian Wushuang, what actually happened?”

Xiao Heng’s attitude towards Jian Wushuang had changed completely.

Before that, neither he nor the four core disciples treated Jian Wushuang seriously and never addressed him as ‘Junior Brother Jian Wushuang’. They had always directly called his name.

However, when they faced him, they felt a sense of respect.

Respect!

Although they had fainted, they could still clearly remember everything that happened previously. They were completely floored by both Jian Wushuang’s abilities and mind.

In their eyes, Jian Wushuang should be categorized as a monster.

However, they did not understand why was a monster only an outer disciple of Narcissus Island?

“Nothing, there were just some things that she didn’t want you to know, so Miss Xiao temporarily made you lose consciousness,” said Jian Wushuang.

Xiao Heng finally understood. “Is that so? Where is Miss Xiao then?”

“Gone, back to Hundred Flowers Tower. Why, do you actually still want to bring her back to Narcissus Island? Or, would you rather make her stay beside you and possess her completely?” Jian Wushuang ridiculed.

Xiao Heng and the four core disciples shuddered when they heard what he said.

Possessing Miss Xiao?

If it was earlier on, they truly had that thought, but now...the idea had vanished into thin air.

They also lost a little bit of craze towards Miss Xiao. In replacement was fear—an incredible fear!

Miss Xiao was absolutely the scariest woman they had ever met.

They would even call her an absolute demon.

Without raising a finger, she manipulated Bai Tao’s group and made them kill themselves. What kind of method was that?

They shivered just at the thought of that.

“Senior Brothers, even though Miss Xiao has left and did not kill you, but there are some things that I have to clarify with you.” Jian Wushuang’s tone suddenly became solemn.

“First, you must forget everything you saw today, including the Mu Clan experts and Bai Tao’s group. You must forget all of it.”

“I did not kill the Mu Clan experts and you’ve never even seen Bai Tao’s group, understand?”

Xiao Heng and the four core disciples’ hearts skipped.

Even though they were not very smart, they were definitely not stupid. They all understood what Jian Wushuang meant.

“Don’t worry, Junior Brother. The five of us will not say a word about what happened here today,” said Xiao Heng.

“That would be best, otherwise...nobody can save you. Even Narcissus Island wouldn’t be able to,” said Jian Wushuang.

Xiao Heng and the rest were shocked, but when they thought of Miss Xiao’s method of killing, they understood what he meant.

“Secondly, we have failed our mission. When we returned to Narcissus Island, let’s tell the Divine Mystery Pavilion of our opinion on the mission is too dangerous and couldn’t find an opportunity to take action, so we gave up. Divine Mystery Pavilion probably wouldn’t ask further. Even if they would ask, you can find some excuses and deceive them,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Mmhm.” Xiao Heng and the four core disciples all nodded.

The Divine Mystery Pavilion on Narcissus Island was only responsible for assigning missions. They would give rewards for accomplished missions. It was not a big issue either if the mission was not accomplished. The most serious scenario would be punishment and was of little consequences.

Divine Mystery Pavilion would not usually ask about the mission’s process.

Jian Wushuang said, “Thirdly, Miss Xiao actually wanted to slaughter all five of you. But I did all I could, even sacrificing something to convince her to let you live. Due to that, I’m at a great loss, so the five of you will have to think of a way to repay me.”

“Naturally.” Xiao Heng nodded without hesitation.

“If it wasn’t for you, Junior Brother Wushuang, the five of us would probably have died many times. Of course, we wouldn’t let you go through a bigger loss,” said one of the core disciples.

Jian Wushuang laughed inside.

He did not quite fancy the five of them. Of course, he would take some advantage out of them given the opportunity.

“Well, the actual price wasn’t something big, just some elixirs that helped raise divine power. The only thing is that it’s quite a lot...” Jian Wushuang began to tell his story.

After a round of discussion, Xiao Heng and the four core disciples finally decided to give Jian Wushuang 90% of the elixir that they had. While in the next three years, they would also give him all the resources that they could get as core disciples on Narcissus Island.

This was as good as severe bleeding to the five of them, but they had no complaints.

After all, between precious resources and their lives, it was obvious that the latter was more important.

Jian Wushuang took a huge advantage from the five of them, in addition to the Interspatial Rings that he obtained from all the Mu Clan experts that he killed. Only the Interspatial Rings of Bai Tao and his companions were taken by Miss Xiao. It was safe to say that he had a massive gain from this trip.
