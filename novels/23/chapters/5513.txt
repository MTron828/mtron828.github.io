Chapter 5513 ¬†Switched Sides

"Absolutely!" Jian Wushuang declared loudly.

Having seen off the two individuals, Jian Wushuang's gaze gradually softened.

He headed directly towards another core of the Yuanyang Lake.

His first destination was the residence of Master Lu Hua, who he was more familiar with.

As for the other two Palace Masters, he wasn't acquainted with them!

When he first emerged, the first person he encountered was Emperor Lu Hua, so he was relatively familiar with him.

Exchanging the Origin Source of All Things was a significant matter.

The Emperor who guarded the Beiwang Tower directly instructed him to seek the palace master; he couldn't make the decision alone.

Jian Wushuang also understood deep down that the complete Origin Source of All Things was the core of the Beiwang Tower. If he exchanged it and took it away, the Beiwang Tower would likely lose its essence.

Alternatively, he could introduce a new and complete Universal Source into the Beiwang Tower.

He sped along the way, not concealing his aura. When he arrived at the island where Emperor Lu Hua resided, the latter was already waiting for him outside.

"Haha, Jian Wushuang, I thought you'd come looking for me as soon as you left the Beiwang Tower. I didn't expect you to have the leisure to visit!" Emperor Lu Hua laughed.

But deep down, he was surprised!

Jian Wushuang gave him a unique feeling, far beyond an ordinary tier 6 combatant.

Dao Lord was like this, and after a successful Dao Merge, he would probably directly become a tier 6 Emperor. It wouldn't take long for him to catch up and become a pinnacle expert among the supreme-peak.

Such a character was not to be casually offended.

Jian Wushuang respectfully greeted without many words.

Now, he was here to exchange treasures, so he couldn't say too much; he needed to keep his composure.

Emperor Lu Hua made a gesture of invitation, and the two entered the grand hall.

The more polite the other party, the more uncertain he felt.

Last time, the promised complete origin of the universe wasn't obtained. In the end, it was his violation, and not getting it was forgivable, but this time it absolutely could not be easily let go.

This time, he had truly broken through the 43rd level.

There was no reason for the other party not to give it to him.

Unless there was some embezzlement, if that were the case, he would take this matter to Zhen Ling!

Anyway, Zhen Ling still needed him. In order to catch the rebels like Fuego, he was going to be used as bait this time.

Without some treasures on him, how could it be possible?

At least life-saving treasures couldn't be lacking!

If he could devour an Origin Source of All Things, not to mention soaring to the heavens in one step, his life force would probably experience a significant boost.

He must not easily compromise.

After entering the hall, Emperor Lu Hua sat directly opposite Jian Wushuang; this was to treat each other as equals.

"Jian Wushuang, you've made quite a splash this time. Now, the entire Elder Palace is spreading your name. It won't be long before everyone in the Four Great Secret Realms knows you!" Emperor Lu Hua still didn't bring up the main matter; he began with some flattery.

This wasn't exactly flattery. A Dao Lord with the combat power of a tier 6 emperor, and breaking through the 43rd level within Beiwang Tower.

If faced against the ordinary tier 6 Emperors from the Four Great Secret Realms, he could suppress them.

After all, some tier 6 Emperors in the Four Great Secret Realms were relatively weak, and Jian Wushuang currently had the strength to compete with them.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, without any false modesty, and directly got to the point. "Palace Master, this time I came to see how much I can exchange for with the points in my hand, in terms of the Origin Source of All Things!"

As he spoke, he took out the token and pushed it towards Emperor Lu Hua.

There was no way to stop him; sooner or later, they would have to face this.

In these days, Emperor Lu Hua had also thought it through.

Since he was unwilling to offend and reluctant to let go, he decided to bring the matter directly to the surface, to see how Jian Wushuang intended to resolve it.

Of course, he would attribute all of this to Chang Feng and Qingniu.

Taking the token with a serious demeanor, he examined it and then drew in a sharp breath, saying, "To be honest, the points here are enough to exchange for all the Origin Sources in the Beiwang Tower!"

"But!" Emperor Lu Hua showed a troubled expression.

Jian Wushuang knew what he was about to say.

It was nothing more than considering the overall situation. For a Dao Lord to monopolize an entire complete Origin Source was too wasteful. It would be better to wait until one's strength became formidable and then grant such rewards.

Jian Wushuang could afford to wait. If he had to wait until he became powerful before receiving these rewards, he would never become powerful.

Though his talent was exceptional, it wasn't to the extent where he needed the enhancement of treasures. He could break through casually without needing the boost of artifacts!

Since entering the Qishen Temple, his strength had progressed rapidly through three stages.

The first stage was due to the Qiuhuang City on the Original Planet. At that time, his strength soared from a Dao Lord to rivaling an Emperor.

The second stage was the refinement of his physical body, which led to a direct surge in power. He could now compete with a tier 2 peak-level Emperor.

After being seized by Bai Junwang, he improved once again, reaching the level of instantly slaying a tier 3 Emperor.

The final stage was entering the Western Sea Ruins.

Within the Three Kings Court, his strength was elevated, as he comprehended the Transformation Dao ladder, experiencing the transformation of All Things anew.

Then, in a battle against the First True King, his divine body reached 50,000-fold, comparable to a tier 6 Emperor.

Initially, he could reach the level of a tier 6 Emperor because of his divine body.

Now, not only could Jian Wushuang's divine body rival that of a tier 6 Emperor, but even his Origin Source had reached this level. At this point, he truly attained the combat power of tier 6.

Reaching this stage wasn't solely based on his potential or perseverance but rather on possessing immense opportunities and treasures.

The refinement of his physical body, swallowing the Universe Origin Source, would have been hopeless without the support of Shan Jun.

In the earthly realm, without the opportunities from the Three Kings Court, he wouldn't have reached this point.

Treasures were indeed crucial. Re√™ad latest ùíèovùíÜls at nùíêùíêv/e/l/biùíè(.)com

Knowledge and wealth were indispensable.

Knowledge represented profound studies; now he could create his own without relying on the universe's inheritance or cosmic secret techniques.

Wealth was absolutely essential.

He didn't forget the recent financial difficulties he faced.

Emperor Lu Hua could see Jian Wushuang's determination, but he hesitated to voice it.

In the end, he had to make a temporary adjustment and said, "The significance of the Origin Source of All Things is indeed considerable. However, one is one, and two is two. We are pleased that you can achieve this. I believe Lord Zhen Ling is even happier. The appearance of a talent like you in the Qishen Temple makes us proud. You can rest assured about the Origin Source of All Things. When the other two Palace Masters return, I will fully support you!"

"Thank you, Palace Master!" Jian Wushuang planned to obtain the Origin Source of All Things today.

However, there needed to be a precise time for it.

"Palace Master Lu Hua, my realm has just broken through. I need many treasures. Please understand!" Jian Wushuang requested.

The other party gave him face, and he would reciprocate.

As long as there were no false promises.

In the future, the Qishen Temple would be under his control. If someone offended him, he wouldn't show them any good intentions.

Lu Hua also understood the implications and handed Jian Wushuang a mustard seed.
