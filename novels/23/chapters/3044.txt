Xue Bei’s index finger touched Jian Wushuang’s glabella, and instantly, a vast amount of information surged toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was also rapidly receiving this information in his mind.

After he had completely received this information, he finally had some understanding of the Emperor’s Order skill.

“This...this is the Emperor’s Order skill!” Jian Wushuang was completely shocked.

There was nothing he could do because the Emperor’s Order skill was indeed shocking.

This secret skill required a special method to create a clone.

Of course, this clone was not a clone that could be used for fighting, but a pure energy clone.

Yes, it was a pure energy clone. It only had a huge amount of divine power, but it did not have the ability to fight and kill people.

Do not underestimate this kind of energy clone.

According to the message that Xue Bei had just sent him, the Emperor’s Order technique was to condense such an energy clone and carry it around with him. The divine power of this kind of energy clone was equivalent to the original body. Once the original body went through a big battle, the divine power would be exhausted, he could immediately replenish it through the energy clone. If he was willing, he could instantly replenish his divine power.

After all, when a cultivator reached the Immortal Saint Realm and controlled the immortal body, as long as his divine power was not completely exhausted, he could constantly refill it.

The importance of this divine power was obvious.

Thus, in the Divine Beginning Realm, many Immortal Saints carried a large number of pellets to recover their divine power. They were prepared for emergencies. Some of the best pellets could recover 20-30% of the Immortal Saint’s divine power in a short time, to those Immortal Saints, they were like precious treasures that would attract countless people to fight for them.

Because such a medicinal elixir, at a critical moment, could possibly give the Immortal Saints an extra life.

Just that medicinal elixir alone was enough. and how important was an Emperor’s life clone that could provide the same divine power as the original body?

Moreover, when the Emperor’s Order skill was cultivated to an extremely high level, it could not only form one Emperor’s life clone, but also nine!

Nine Emperor’s life clones, that was nine lives!

What an incredible secret skill!

“Senior, this, this Emperor’s life skill...” Jian Wushuang was so shocked that he could not speak.

“Why, are you shocked?”

Xue Bei smiled. “When the blood ancestor taught this secret skill to me, I was as shocked as you. This secret skill is indeed incredible, but it’s from the universe battlefield, so it’s normal for it to be so amazing. However, the Emperor’s Order skill is very powerful, but it can’t guarantee that you won’t die. For example, I condensed five Emperor’s Order avatars at my peak, but in that battle, I wanted to escape, but in the end, I used up all my divine power, but in the end, I still died!”

“If I hadn’t reacted quickly and split my consciousness when I was about to die, carrying my secret realm and my interspatial ring directly into the space-time crack, you wouldn’t have had the chance to see me.”

Jian Wushuang was shocked and then nodded secretly.

“You can barely cultivate the Emperor’s Order skill with your current strength. However, to cultivate this secret skill, you need a well-preserved divine body. Such a divine body can only be relied on by other cultivators. If you want the divine power of the Emperor’s Order avatar to be equal to the original body, the divine body that carries the Emperor’s Order avatar should be at the same level as the original body. For example, I hope to collect the corpses of many experts for the Emperor’s Order skill,” Xue Bei said.

“Senior, you said before that you broke into a sect and killed four principles masters in one go, but there are only two principles masters’ corpses in this secret realm. If I’m not wrong, you used the other principles masters’ corpses to refine the Emperor’s Order doppelganger, right?” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes.” Xue Bei nodded. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Senior, I have a favor to ask of you,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Speak,” Xue Bei said.

“My physique is very special and my divine power is very vast. Although I’m only a rank one True Saint now if I cultivate the Emperor’s Order skill, the corpse of the expert who carries the Emperor’s Order doppelganger can not be done by a cultivator of the same level. Even the corpse of a rank four, five, or even rank six True Saint who is stronger than me may not be able to do it. Therefore, I want to take a few corpses from this secret realm. I don’t know if it’s possible,” Jian Wushuang said.

“How many corpses?” Xue Bei raised his eyebrows. “These corpses were prepared for the cultivation of the art of Emperor’s Order. Since you want to use them, of course, you can, but you have to be able to take them with you.”

“Will I encounter any trouble when I take these corpses?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Of course.” Xue Bei smiled. “The corpses of the experts in my secret realm were all well-known in the Divine Beginning World. Even the weakest among them was almost invincible among the Immortal Saints. Even if such experts are dead, their will still remains on their corpses. If you want to refine these corpses into tools to carry the emperor’s avatar, of course their will won’t agree.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood. “Let’s try it later.”

Jian Wushuang had received the inheritance of the Emperor’s Order skill, so he knew how powerful this secret skill was. He definitely wanted to cultivate this secret skill.

However, to cultivate this secret skill, it was necessary to carry the equipment of the Emperor’s Order doppelganger, which was the corpse of an expert!

“Next is the third opportunity,” Xue Bei said again.

Jian Wushuang looked at him expectantly.

Xue Bei flipped his hand and took out a token.

“This is the third opportunity for you.” Xue Bei threw the token to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took it and scanned it with his consciousness, but his expression became strange.

Because he could not see any information or content from the token.

To be exact, there was something inside the token, but there was a layer of restriction inside the token, which prevented his consciousness from exploring.

“Senior, what is inside the token?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“A star map,” Xue Bei said.

“Star map?” Jian wushuang was stunned.

Just a star map was the third opportunity left for him?

Jian Wushuang immediately understood that this star map was not a trivial matter.

“I told you before that I went to the universe battlefield and this star map came from the universe battlefield. To be exact, when I went to the universe battlefield, I entered a special space-time by chance. However, I was too weak and could not move in that special space-time. I had no choice but to leave. However, I used this star map to record the location of that special space-time,” Xue Bei said.
