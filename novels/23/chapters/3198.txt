Chapter 3199: Black Demon Secret Technique

——

“Where is this Heavenly Sword Marquis?” Duan Lang’s expression was grave as he kept a vigilant eye on his surroundings.

However, at this moment…without any warning, a ghostly figure appeared behind him. At the same time, Duan Lang clearly did not notice it at all, the ghost figure even stabbed out with his long sword.

It was a silent and silent sword strike.

This sword strike was extremely fast!

“This is…” Duan Lang suddenly widened his eyes.

Although he still did not sense the presence of Jian Wushuang or the sword skill that came straight at him, he felt a huge sense of fear from behind him, this fear was naturally formed during his long years of fighting.

Without any hesitation, Duan Lang immediately moved to the side.

Whoosh!

A cold sword shadow pierced Duan Lang’s waist. Then, with a slash, a tearing force burst out, but it did not tear the protective armor on Duan Lang’s body apart. It only left a white mark on the armor, Duan Lang suddenly retreated.

“I can’t tear his armor apart?” Jian Wushuang looked at Duan Lang’s armor in surprise, but he nodded secretly.

Obviously, the protective armor Duan Lang was wearing should be a top-level holy treasure.

Although his Blood Mountain Sword was not weaker than Duan Lang’s protective armor, this slash was not enough to tear Duan Lang’s armor apart. After all, he had just used the silent swordsmanship, it was not the Star Dream first move, which had the strongest tearing and cutting ability in the Wushuang Sword Manual.

“Your reaction is quite fast, but how many times can you dodge such an assassination sword skill?” Jian Wushuang sneered and disappeared in front of Duan Lang again.

“Damn it, what did Heavenly Sword Marquis use?” Duan Lang’s face was extremely ugly. He could not find Jian Wushuang at all.

He only knew that Jian Wushuang was hiding in the surrounding void, but he did not know where Jian Wushuang was. However, Jian Wushuang knew where he was.

This meant that Jian Wushuang could see, and he was blind. Standing in the void, he could only be a living target for Jian Wushuang.

If he wanted to fight back, he did not even know where Jian Wushuang was. How could he fight back?

“Shadowless escape art, shadowless track. Heavenly Sword Marquis must have just mastered this escape art and just reached the initial success stage. Even so, with the shadowless escape art in the initial success stage, he can easily hide from the soul perception of a Peak Saint or even an Invincible Saint. Unless he is an expert who specializes in soul attacks and has an extremely high level of soul research, there is no one among the Immortal Saints who can find his position.”

“With this escape art, Heavenly Sword Marquis has been invincible from the very beginning.” A goateed Principles Master sighed in admiration.

“Yes, once this secret art is released, as long as Duan Lang can not find Heavenly Sword Marquis’ true position, he will only be passively beaten. There is no room for him to fight back. Just as Heavenly Sword Marquis said, you can dodge a sword, but you can not dodge all the assassination sword arts. You will be defeated sooner or later.” Another Principles Master said.

“Now, I finally understand why Palace Master Bai Xing gave the spot to Heavenly Sword Marquis. Although Heavenly Sword Marquis isn’t very strong in a head-on battle and is only at the peak of the middle-level Saint Realm, his shadowless evasion technique is definitely more terrifying than many Invincible Saints, especially in a chaotic battle. This technique of his is simply a nightmare.” A graceful woman also smiled faintly.

These Principles Masters had high standards, and they all knew how terrifying the shadowless escape art was.

They all thought that with this escape art, Jian Wushuang was invincible, and Duan Lang was doomed to lose!

On the battlefield.

Jian Wushuang used the shadowless escape art to assassinate Duan Lang time and time again.

Just as the Principles Masters had expected, Duan Lang was just a living target. He could only be ambushed by Jian Wushuang and had no ability to fight back. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

However, Jian Wushuang was unable to hit Duan Lang’s vital points and make his divine body collapse even though he had forced Duan Lang into a sorry state.

“Duan Lang has a strong sense of crisis and is very sensitive. The key is that his body-protection ability is very good. It’s difficult for me to break his body-protection armor with the silent swordsmanship. However, if I use the star dream first move, he will be able to sense the power of the swordsmanship in advance and block my attack head-on.” Jian Wushuang frowned.

Although he had the absolute advantage now, he still felt that Duan Lang was very difficult to deal with.

At least his sneak attacks did not really hurt Duan Lang.

At this moment…

“Heavenly Sword Marquis!” A loud shout suddenly came from Duan Lang’s mouth.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang hid in the surrounding void and looked at Duan Lang.

“I admit that you are very strong. You are only a rank six True Saint, but you can have such battle strength and have mastered such a strange escape skill. You are indeed very difficult to deal with. Temple Master Bai Xing should have given you the quota to enter the Blood Wave Realm. If it were me a month ago, I would have been beaten up again and again by your escape skill. In the long run, I will definitely lose!” Duan Lang said.

Hearing this, the surrounding Principles Masters looked at each other in dismay.

They all thought Duan Lang would lose, but what Duan Lang meant was that he would lose a month ago, but now, it was a month later.

“Duan Lang, you can use whatever tricks you have.” Jian Wushuang’s voice sounded from all directions.

“Humph, as you wish.” Duan Lang just smiled coldly. The moment his smile fell…

Buzz!

A terrifying black wave suddenly spread out from his body. The black wave covered the entire battlefield with the black wave at an alarming speed.

As the black wave took shape, a faint destructive power slowly rose on the battlefield.

“This is…”

When the surrounding people saw this scene, their pupils constricted.

“It’s the black devil secret technique. It’s a secret technique Duan Lang has been cultivating. Many years ago, I saw him use it. This secret technique is his strongest trump card. However, the black devil secret technique he used this time seems to be different from the last time.” Qian Hongzi frowned.

The Principles Masters by his side had already cried out in surprise.

“A black devil secret technique that has even formed a black ripple domain?”

“Great success! This is a black devil secret technique that has reached great success!”

“My God! A black devil secret technique! Even if a Principles Master cultivates it to great success, it would still be extremely terrifying!”
