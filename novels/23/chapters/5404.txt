Chapter 5404 ¬†Entering the Body

However, later on, she had always focused on the Origin Source, not delving much into the divine body aspect. Now, with her strength suddenly soaring, it made her divine body somewhat unable to cope.

Jian Wushuang outside the main hall quickly noticed this and immediately shouted, "Take action!"

Just a peak-level of tier 4, even with a complete Dao, was not much different from the current Bai Junwang.

Jian Wushuang didn't even consider them a threat.

The two of them joined forces, easily dealing with a Gong Miaoyi.

Phantom sword images began to appear, thousands of illusory swords rising into the air.

"Transcendent Immortal Formation!"

He wanted to see how strong Gong Miaoyi was. In terms of the Origin Source, she was no weaker than the current Bai Junwang.

It's worth noting that Bai Junwang's Origin Source was created based on secret techniques devised Shen Ling, combined with the Power of All Things, painstakingly refined through blood sacrifice.

On the other hand, Gong Miaoyi, a Holy Maiden from a small faction, possessed such a formidable Origin Source. Especially after inheriting the legacy supreme technique, her Origin Source had become even more powerful.

Jian Wushuang pressed down his intentions. Regardless of the circumstances, today, he must defeat Gong Miaoyi and thoroughly study her.

These Four Great Secret Realms were different from what he had imagined and heard.

Now, he was truly experiencing them.

"You!" As the three clashed, Gong Miaoyi stared at Jian Wushuang with a surprised expression.

Previously, Jian Wushuang had not truly made a move. Now that he had unleashed his Origin Source, Gong Miaoyi, feeling the pressure from the powerful Origin Source, found her breath becoming somewhat unstable.

The fact that Bai Junwang's Origin Source could contend with Gong Miaoyi's had already surprised her.

Her mother had told her that the Origin Source within her was the strongest among the Four Great Secret Realms. However, just after inheriting it, she encountered someone with an Origin Source nearly as potent as hers.

Then there was something even more outrageous: Jian Wushuang's Origin Source aura surpassed hers by several levels.

If her Origin Source was like a spring, then Jian Wushuang's Origin Source was like a vast ocean.

Though her Origin Source was suppressed, Gong Miaoyi's current greatest reliance was the Bloodfall Crystal in her hand.

Blood-colored lines burst forth, instantly restraining Bai Junwang.

Jian Wushuang furrowed his brows, his figure ghost-like as he instantly transformed into thousands of clones, dispersing in all directions.

The formidable restraint of the blood-colored lines made Jian Wushuang cautious.

Not daring to take risks, he unfurled a pair of wings at his back, and the Beast God Domain suddenly descended.

His divine body began to swell.

20,000-fold!

23,000-fold!

26,000-fold!

27,800-fold!

In an instant, the divine body erupted to an unprecedented degree. Wings fluttered, and in his hands appeared an ancient and simple long sword.

It was a replicated Eternal Treasure long sword.

Bai Junwang, entangled and uncomfortable, was originally a powerhouse following the divine body path.

Now, with the divine body absent, possessing only the Origin Source without profound techniques and secret arts, he could handle practitioners weaker than him. When facing a formidable opponent, he felt helpless.

Moreover, he had nothing on him. He had no treasures, so he was just a naked tier 4 peak-level powerhouse, struggling within the blood-colored lines with the might of his powerful Origin Source.

"Don't struggle!" Jian Wushuang once again rushed into the lines. He noticed that the more Bai Junwang struggled, the tighter the lines became.

Bai Junwang paused for a moment, then quickly understood. After all, he was an experienced powerhouse with quick reactions.

The blood-red lines were quite effective against Bai Junwang, significantly weaker against Jian Wushuang, who was on the verge of transcending space.

Upon reentry, his figure became elusive, and the icy blade severed countless approaching blood-red lines, posing no threat to Jian Wushuang.

With a graceful spin of his longsword around his waist, Jian Wushuang's brow flickered, and with a glance, the entire spatial structure unfolded before him ‚Äì upper three layers, middle three layers, lower three layers, layer upon layer of space interwoven within the world, with the blood-red lines threading through the nine layers.

Swish!

Jian Wushuang's figure vanished within the entire nine-layered space, even his presence disappeared. The blood-red lines couldn't menace him but could obstruct him. Lingering here was not an option; he had to quickly take down Gong Miaoyi.

Delaying would lead to unforeseen changes!

Initially, he thought that after helping Bai Junwang reshape his Origin Source, even without a physical body or divine body, he should at least be comparable to a tier 5 Emperor!

Yet, he ended up in a sorry state, and now Bai Junwang relied on him.

At the end of the space, within the black hole.

Jian Wushuang's figure moved like a ghost.

This was a technique he comprehended from within the black hole. Concealing the body in the rift of the void would eventually be discovered. Only by entering the black hole could one truly isolate everything.

In the deep layers of space, Jian Wushuang was like a black hole.

Facing the sudden disappearance of Jian Wushuang, Gong Miaoyi's expression changed. Astonishingly, she couldn't sense Jian Wushuang's presence!

"Hmm?"

Did he run away?

Gong Miaoyi lightly twirled the Bloodfall Crystal, countless blood-red lines swirling around her.

She couldn't be certain if Jian Wushuang had left immediately; this space was independently created and not a cave where one could tear through space and depart at will.

Within the cavernous space, encompassing nine layers of space, even a tier 5 Emperor would find it impossible to escape‚Äîlet alone Jian Wushuang, a mere tier 3 Emperor.

In Gong Miaoyi's mind, while Jian Wushuang's strength held an air of mystery, it didn't seem outrageous enough to surpass that of a tier 5 Emperor.

Nevertheless, precautions were necessary.

Thousands of blood lines surrounded and crisscrossed the nine layers of space, impervious to anything below a tier 5 Emperor.

Bai Junwang felt increasingly entangled and uncomfortable, angrily shouting, "You've angered me, and you will die for it!"

In this moment, he reverted to his former fierceness, startling Gong Miaoyi. At this level of strength, who could still be frightened?

"Hehe, deal with me first before saying such things!" Gong Miaoyi's attention was not on Bai Junwang. She casually responded and ignored him.

If it came down to raw power, she was not Bai Junwang's match, but with Bloodfall Crystal in hand, she could use softness to conquer strength and firmly suppress Bai Junwang.

Jian Wushuang, on the other hand, was truly enigmatic.

His ability to seize opportunities was exceptionally strong. Visitt novùíÜlbin(.)cùíê/m for the lùíÇtest updates

Just as Gong Miaoyi diverted a fraction of her focus towards Bai Junwang, his figure transformed into particles within the folds of space. His divine body was now at the strength of 30,000-fold, he condensed into a point, instantly erupting into a miniature black hole.

"Devour!"

Whoosh!

A powerful suction force scattered Gong Miaoyi's consciousness. The Bloodfall Crystal, which had just unleashed its power, attempting to pierce through the black hole formed by Jian Wushuang, halted as it approached him.

Without consciousness, the Bloodfall Crystal lost its luster.

The blood-red lines vanished. After Bai Junwang escaped confinement, he turned around, delivering a fist accompanied by a powerful storm.

"No!"

Gong Miaoyi suddenly snapped back to awareness, her pupils contracting.

The impending fist came to a sudden halt.

This time, it wasn't Bai Junwang showing mercy; rather, it was the strange, or rather, familiar voice of Gong Miaoyi.

"Are you Jian Wushuang?" Bai Junwang looked at Gong Miaoyi, pointing at her in disbelief.

Gong Miaoyi paused for a moment, then, with a voice that seemed both male and female, said, "I've entered her body!"

Jian Wushuang, having transformed into particles and entered Gong Miaoyi's body, had directly occupied her Origin Source.
