Chapter 3164: Hidden Special Time and Space

——

Hearing Xin Zong’s words, the dark figure on the throne could not help but remain silent.

Even a real soul could be repaired directly by divine power?

Moreover, a rank four True Saint’s divine power was as vast as the sea, and his divine body had been broken and reassembled 50 times, but he had only used up half of his divine power?

In addition, Jian Wushuang’s battle strength was absolutely heaven-defying…

“It seems that the rumor is very likely true,” the dark figure murmured softly.

“Rumor?” Xin Zong and Void Master looked at each other, but they did not know what dark figure meant.

“What happened next?” The dark figure looked down.

Xin Zong replied, “After Ba Cang arrived, he directly said that Heavenly Sword Marquis was a member of his Temporal Temple and wanted us to leave. The three of us did not agree at first, but Ba Cang was terrifyingly strong. He killed Xin Zong with just a casual finger. Void Master and I could only flee immediately.”

“Ba Cang?” The dark figure muttered, “I’ve heard of Ba Cang Master from the Temporal Temple. He went to the universe battlefield for a period of time and was quite famous. In terms of strength, he could be considered as the top among the Principles Masters of the Divine Beginning World. Even compared to the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, he was only slightly weaker.”

“With such strength, it’s indeed easy to kill the three of you.”

Xin Zong and Void Master could not help but lower their heads.

Although they had heard of Ba Cang’s fame before, they did not truly feel that Ba Cang was that terrifying. After all, they were three rule masters working together, and they were confident that they could fight with Ba Cang. But in the end…Ba Cang’s strength far exceeded their imaginations.

“That Heavenly Sword Marquis left with Ba Cang?” The dark figure asked.

“Yes, he must have gone to the Temporal Temple with Ba Cang,” said Xin Zong.

“That’s troublesome.” The dark figure tapped on the armchair. “The Temporal Temple is the most mysterious and ancient force in the Divine Beginning Realm. No one in the Divine Beginning Realm knows where the headquarters of the Temporal Temple is. Even the experts under the Temporal Temple don’t know about it.”

“Since Ba Cang has brought him to the Temporal Temple unless he comes out from the Temporal Temple in the future, no one in the Divine Beginning Realm has the chance to deal with him. Even though the Sorcerer God’s Sect has many methods, we can’t do anything to the Heavenly Sword Marquis in the Temporal Temple!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Ah!”

“Forget it. We’ve already missed the chance. We can only wait for the next chance. We just don’t know if the Heavenly Sword Marquis will give us another chance.”

The dark figure sighed a few times, but his body slowly turned into nothingness.

Seeing the dark figure disappear, Xin Zong and Void Master, who were kneeling there, heaved a sigh of relief.

Obviously, after knowing that they had failed their mission and failed to bring Heavenly Sword Marquis back to the Sorcerer God Sect, the Sorcerer God was angry, but he did not blame them.

Indeed, they had done their best.

Jian Wushuang was just too difficult to deal with.

…

It was a dark and boundless void.

They had reached the edge of the First Heaven. Jian Wushuang followed Ba Cang and teleported almost a hundred times to get here. Ba Cang could teleport hundreds of times, he could travel trillions of miles and teleport hundreds of times. It was a long journey.

If Jian Wushuang traveled on his own, he would not be able to get there without the help of the space passage for decades.

However, he arrived here in just a moment through teleportation.

“Here we are.”

Ba Cang and Jian Wushuang appeared in the dark void.

After they appeared, Jian Wushuang looked at the dark void in front of him with some confusion and confusion.

“Master Ba Cang, the Temporal Temple is here?” Jian Wushuang was extremely astonished.

The dark void in front of him was filled with nothingness, but it did not look like the nest of a force at all.

“Of course the spacetime temple is not here. This void is just one of the sensing points to enter the Temporal Temple,” Ba Cang said.

“Sensing point?” Jian Wushuang was even more confused.

“Our Temporal Temple specializes in the principles of spacetime. We have already reached the peak in the use of spacetime. Our lair is in an extremely special spacetime,” Ba Cang explained.

“This special spacetime is not a Mystic Realm of heaven and earth. It is even beyond the Divine Beginning World. In short… This special spacetime is hidden in the Divine Beginning World, but no one can find it.”

“No one can find it?” Jian Wushuang was stunned. “In that case, how can we go to the Temporal Temple?”

“Of course, there is a way.” Ba Cang smiled and waved his hand. A strange space-time fluctuation spread out.

After the space-time fluctuation spread out, a unique space-time passage slowly took shape in the void in front of Jian Wushuang.

“This is the tunnel leading to the Temporal Temple,” Ba Cang said, “Of course, this tunnel can not be formed so easily. Several conditions must be met at the same time. First, the space tunnel can only be formed at the sensing point!”

“As I said, the Temporal Temple is in an extremely unique space-time, which is incompatible with the Divine Beginning World. Under normal circumstances, it’s almost impossible to enter this unique space-time from the Divine Beginning World. However, the founder of the Temporal Temple, the Temple Master, found a way to connect the Temporal Temple is in with the Divine Beginning World. Then, he set up some sensing points in some places in the Divine Beginning World.”

“These sensing points can be connected to the space-time where the Temporal Temple is located. For example, the void where you are now is one of the sensing points.”

“The second condition is that only the core members of the Temporal Temple will know how to connect to the space-time where the Temporal Temple is located and form a space-time tunnel!”

“As for the third condition, it’s even more demanding. You need to have a high level of comprehension of the spacetime principles, or even a complete comprehension of the entire spacetime principles before you can successfully form this spacetime tunnel.”

“In other words, even if you’re a core member of the Temporal Temple, if you haven’t completely comprehended the spacetime principles, you won’t be able to enter the Temporal Temple by yourself. If you want to enter, you can only send a message to the senior experts of the Temporal Temple, asking them to act and lead you in.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang could not help praising. At the same time, he also understood why the Temporal Temple had existed in the Divine Beginning World for so many years, but no one knew where its lair was.

It turned out that the lair of the Temporal Temple was so well hidden!
