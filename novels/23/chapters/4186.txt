4189 Sword Technique, Eternal Night!

“No,” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

The Third Prince frowned and asked, “Why?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Third Prince,” Jian Wushuang replied with a faint smile. “It seems that you still don’t understand why I came to you first.”

“What?” The Third Prince squinted his eyes. He did not expect to go so quickly. He did not know why Jian Wushuang would look for him first. Speaking of which, this was the first time they had met. Even if Jian Wushuang wanted to find an opponent, he should not have looked for him.

!!

Jian Wushuang also revealed the answer to him.

“Do you still remember Water Sorcerer Ruler?” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

“Water Sorcerer Ruler?” The Third Prince frowned. He had seen too many Rulers, but he did not have much of an impression of the others, except for a few famous and unparalleled Rulers.

After a long time, he seemed to remember that not long after he had arrived at the Tarot Ruins, a fifth stage Ruler had accidentally blocked his way and been killed by him with a single palm.

Before this person died, he seemed to have mentioned that his master was the Water Sorcerer Ruler.

Afterward, he seemed to have heard that the Water Sorcerer had come to find him, demanding an explanation. As the Third Prince of the great Feng Divine Empire, how could he possibly receive someone like that?

As a result, he had Ruler Horned Flame and the others under his command throw Ruler water and his two disciples out.

“Are you here for Water Sorcerer Ruler?” The Third Prince narrowed his eyes.

“Not bad.” Jian Wushuang nodded calmly.

“Hahahahaha, what a joke, what a joke. Jian Wushuang, you want to kill me for an ant?” The Third Prince suddenly laughed out loud, laughing so hard that his back was bent.

He felt that this was the biggest joke in his life!

What sort of status did Water Sorcerer Ruler have? A useless Ruler from who knows which remote corner of the universe!

And who was he?

He was the Third Prince of the great God nation, a top-tier God nation in the universe! he had a distinguished status and was respected by tens of thousands of people!

Jian Wushuang wanted to kill him just because he had killed a disciple of Water Sorcerer Ruler?

Jian Wushuang calmly looked at the Third Prince, who was laughing like a madman, and slowly said, “You see them as ants, but do I not see you as one?”

“What did you just say? You dare to treat me like an ant?” The Third Prince suddenly lowered his head and stared at Jian Wushuang with a cold expression.

Jian Wushuang did not answer him. Instead, he slowly let go of the Wuqi Divine Sword in his hand and said, “The light vanished into the deepest darkness, the power that could strip away everything.

“Its name is…”

“Eternal night!”

Weng.

There was no earth-shaking explosion, nor was there an explosion that made the world pale. When Jian Wushuang finished speaking, it was like a small stone was thrown into the calm water, causing circles of ripples.

Starting from the tip of the sword, the Wuqi Divine Sword began to disappear inch by inch.

Jian Wushuang slowly closed his eyes.

The Wuqi Divine Sword floated in front of Jian Wushuang. Starting from the tip of the sword, it turned into nothingness inch by inch.

It did not shatter. Instead, it seemed to transform into the energy of the world until the entire sword disappeared completely without a sound.

The Third Prince did not know why, but he suddenly felt a terrifying sense of threat.

This threat was far stronger than any of his previous encounters!

His forehead began to break out in a cold sweat, and a trace of uneasiness rose in his heart. He could not help but look in the direction of the Ninth Kalpa King, Lord Zhennan, and the others, and shouted, “Silver Roc, quickly come and help me!!”

On the Ninth Kalpa King’s battlefield.

The Silver Roc could not help but frown. The Third Prince was a well-known, invincible Ultimate Ruler in the universe. How could he not be able to deal with a mere fourth-stage great Ruler? Even to the point where he needed help?

“Trash.” The Ruler Silver Roc cursed in his heart, but he still turned to the Lord Zhennan and said, “Your Highness, the Third Prince seems to be in trouble. Please help him.”

Lord Zhennan nodded and looked at Jian Wushuang in the distance with a cruel smile.

Well, he did not want to face the Ninth Kalpa King anyway, so he might as well start with this fourth-stage Ruler kid.

“Your Highness, this King has come to help you!” Lord Zhennan shouted at the Third Prince. He took a step forward and turned into a beam of divine light, appearing beside the Third Prince in an instant.

“Your Highness, are you alright?” The Lord Zhennan glanced at him.

“I’m fine.” The Third Prince replied. His expression did not soften with the arrival of Lord Zhennan.

“Your Highness, there’s something strange about this kid.”

The Third Prince took a deep breath. He could feel that the threat and uneasiness he felt had not decreased even after the arrival of Lord Zhennan.

“Strange?”

Lord Zhennan was stunned for a moment before he laughed and said, “Your highness, how strange can a mere fourth-stage chief Ruler be? You’re overthinking, aren’t you?”

After saying that, Lord Zhennan looked at Jian Wushuang, who was standing in the void in the distance with his eyes closed. Suddenly, as if he felt something, he said in surprise, “Eh? I didn’t notice it before, but the sword Dao aura on this kid’s body is the same as the aura that the people who killed Star Ruler and Heavenly Ruler saw. Could it be that the person with the big secret that Star Ruler and Heavenly Ruler mentioned is this guy?”

“Fine. I’d like to see what’s so special about this strange man who has a big secret.”

With that, Lord Zhennan sneered and stretched out his giant hand to grab Jian Wushuang. “You’re just pretending to be a ghost. Come over here!!”

Boom!

Before Lord Zhennan could catch Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes!

There were no pupils or whites in his eyes, only a void of darkness.

Wisps of black fog as thick as ink began to spread from under Jian Wushuang’s feet, dyeing the entire void black. Then, they slowly surged toward Lord Zhennan and the Third Prince.

The next moment, Jian Wushuang said softly, “Strip me of my power.”

Weng.

Like a stone falling into the water, it created ripples. The world in front of Lord Zhennan and the Third Prince suddenly changed.

It was as if they were the only two people left in the world. In their eyes, time began to accelerate, and everything around them gradually faded. The world seemed to be covered in a thick haze.

And this was only the beginning.

The color of the world continued to deepen. Gradually, it turned from gray to black. The black continued to deepen until it was as dark as ink. There was no light in their eyes.

The Lord Zhennan and the Third Prince felt like they had fallen into an eternal dark Kingdom. In this kingdom, there was no light, no vitality, and no hope.

Only the oppressive, dull, dead, cold, and stiff auras began to entangle them.

The Lord Zhennan and the Third Prince suddenly felt a strong sense of uneasiness in their hearts under this complicated aura.
