Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The battle between Jian Wushuang and Universe God Xiong Fu attracted many Universe Gods.

The Universe Gods kept their distance and watched from afar. Some Universe Gods even took out a mirroring token to record the war scene.

After Jian Wushuang and the other two disciples left, the spectators in the void immediately burst into an uproar.

“Universe God Xiong Fu died?”

“The twentieth on Universe God ranking list, Jian Wushuang, killed the ninth-ranked Universe God Xiong Fu?”

“This is unbelievable!”

There was a great commotion.

Very soon, the news about the battle spread like wildfire.

In the loft palace where the Almighties gathered.

“Lei Chao, your people in Lineage of Star have guts!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The roar containing boundless anger reverberated through the entire palace. It was a stern-looking man who roared. The stern-looking man was from Heaven Axe Divine Palace.

“Humph. The one who has guts should be Universe God Xiong Fu from Heaven Axe Divine Palace. He was after a disciple from Lineage of Star, Long Ya. Even after Long Ya gave him the White Blaze Fruit, he didn’t stop. He wanted Long Ya’s death. Now, Jian Wushuang has killed him and he only has himself to blame,” Lei Chao snorted.

“Has?himself to blame?! We, Heaven Axe Divine Palace, won’t pretend as though nothing has happened!” The stern-looking man bellowed.

“Regardless of what Heaven Axe Divine Palace wants to do, we, Lineage of Star will be accepting it,” Lei Chao said at ease.

Such a joke. The power levels of Lineage of Star and Heaven Axe Divine Palace were very close.

When Universe God Xiong Fu had intended to strike at Long Ya, he didn’t worry about Lineage of Star. So why would Lineage of Star bother with Heaven Axe Divine Palace?

The surrounding experts, including the Almighties, watched the two of them wage a tit-for-tat struggle engrossingly but didn’t stop them.

In the middle of the hall, there was a motion picture that appeared before long. The motion picture was the scene where Jian Wushuang and Universe God Xiong Fu were exchanging blows.

Everyone in the hall was watching while exchanging comments.

“Jian Wushuang is quite powerful!”

“He is. He comprehended two Supreme Doctrine: Reincarnation and Spacetime Doctrine. Plus, his comprehension of Reincarnation Doctrine has already passed through the first level of Doctrine Palace. It’s really rare!”

“The most impressive thing about Jian Wushuang is his martial art motion!”

“Yeah. His martial art motion is too creepy. Universe God Xiong Fu totally couldn’t keep up, he could only take the hits and be on the defensive.”

The experts in the hall were highly experienced, especially the Almighties. Through the motion picture, they could clearly determine Jian Wushuang’s power.

However, they still couldn’t tell Jian Wushuang’s true level of power, let alone the fact that Jian Wushuang was an inverse cultivator.

“Jian Wushuang’s martial art motion, I know about this,” the owner of Sky Sword Mountain spoke.

“His martial art motion is created by a Real God with high comprehension level on Spacetime Doctrine from very long ago. Its called Flowing Light Phantom. The Real God’s power wasn’t very strong and was quite a distance from getting listed on Universe God ranking list but his martial art motion was widely recognized as the first in that era!”

“Later on, the Real God passed away and the martial art motion was passed down to his descendants. Over the years of passing down, it ended up in the hands of a Universe God named Long Xiu. Universe God Long Xiu was previously imprisoned in my Sky Sword Prison. But when Jian Wushuang was wandering in Sky Sword Prison, he killed Universe God Long Xiu. Hence, he obtained the secret skill of the martial art motion.”

“Oh, I see,” the surrounding experts nodded.

A Real God could be widely recognized as the first in martial art motion and speed with the secret skill of Flowing Light Phantom alone. From that itself, one could see how impressive the secret skill was.

“In terms of martial art motion alone, Jian Wushuang should be in the first place out of all experts on Universe God ranking list, “An Almighty said.

“He should be. Look at Universe God Xiong Fu, he wasn’t much weaker compared to Jian Wushuang but Jian Wushaung killed him straight away, relying on the martial art motion itself. With such a shocking martial art motion, Jian Wushuang’s power is enough to be listed in the top five on Universe God ranking list,” the red-haired elderly with a unicorn in between his eyebrows said.

The surrounding Almighties agreed.

However, regardless of Jian Wushuang’s ranking on Universe God ranking list, the Almighties wouldn’t bother. They were merely treating Jian Wushuang as a topic of discussion.

In Wu Bei’s cave.

“Jian Wushuang, you are the strongest. The White Blaze Fruit that Long Ya got earlier, keep it for yourself. You don’t have to give it to Long Ya,” Lei Chao sent a message.

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang nodded. Then, he informed Long Ya and Xuan Yi about it.

Long Ya agreed, “There are many experts in Wu Bei’s cave. It’d be the safest if White Blaze Fruits are with you.”

“What are your plans after this?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“My divine power has yet to recover entirely. Even if it recovers entirely, it is quite dangerous for me to wander around Wu Bei’s cave alone. So, I plan to join forces with Xuan Yi and move around with him,” Long Ya said.

“That’d be best,” Jian Wushuang nodded too.

Since Wu Bei’s cave had opened to the public, there was a large number of experts that had gathered there. Many experts on Universe God ranking list, including those who weren’t famous but possessed fighting power of one on Universe God ranking list. Long Ya and Xuan Yi weren’t very high in ranking on Universe God ranking list. If they were to wander around alone, they might not be able to escape in time, even if they were lucky enough to find a White Blaze Fruit.

If they were to join forces, they could at least coordinate.

As for Jian Wushuang, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to wander along with his power.

“If so, I shall leave. Be careful when you two move around,” Jian Wushuang said.

Then, Jian Wushuang left.

The grand fight banquet for White Blaze Fruit continued and became even more insane.

On the eighth day, after the battle between Jian Wushuang and Universe God Xiong Fu ended, there was a piece of news that was shared to every Universe God in Wu Bei’s cave.

The first-ranked on the Universe God ranking list, God Destroying King, was there!

God Destroying King had conquered the first place on Universe God ranking list firmly a hundred thousand years ago. All those years, his position had been unshakable.

The top ten monsters on Universe God ranking list, if the monsters in the second and the third place could be challenged, God Destroying King who was first place, was an unbeatable mythology, a legend.

His power was so powerful that it made one feel hopeless. He was so powerful that Zi Dongwang in second place and Demon Girl Ling Luo in third place didn’t have the courage to compete with him.

According to the introduction of God Destroying King to Universe God ranking list, God Destroying King had comprehended one of the Four Supreme Doctrine, Extermination Doctrine. Also, he had only comprehended Extermination Doctrine.

Unlike Jian Wushuang, Zi Dongwang and Ling Luo who had comprehended two Heaven Ways.

However, because he focused entirely on Extermination Doctrine, his comprehension towards Extermination Doctrine was at an unbelievable level.

There was a rumor in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries that God Destroying King’s comprehension towards Extermination Doctrine could pass through the second level of Doctrine Palace!
