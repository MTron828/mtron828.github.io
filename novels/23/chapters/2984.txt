“However, before I continue to accept the three-star earth-level task… I got 100 million sacred elixirs. I can go to Lord Tianshou and see if I can exchange them for something good.” Jian Wushuang smiled and immediately went to the Treasure Pavilion.

“Sir Tianshou, I need some sword skill manuals that can be used to observe and comprehend, and also involve the space-time rules,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

He knew very well what he lacked now.

It was the absolute art that he created. The sword skill, the first move of the storm, was too weak.

He really needed to create a stronger absolute art now. This absolute art had to be able to perfectly display his comprehension of the space-time rules.

“There are too many sword skills related to the space-time rules in my Treasure Pavilion. I’ll give you a list first. Take a look for yourself.” Lord Tianshou took out a list and handed it to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang glanced at it casually, but he could not help staring at it.

The list given by Lord Tianshou was indeed full of various sword skills related to the power of the space-time rules.

The key point was that there were so many swordsmanship manuals on the list that there must be at least tens of millions of them.

“Is it all here?” Jian Wushuang could not help looking at Lord Tianshou.

“No, this is only a part of it. After you have selected this list, if you are not satisfied, I will give you a second list,” Lord Tianshou said straightforwardly.

Jian Wushuang was speechless. Then he said directly, “Lord Tianshou, the sword skill manuals I want are of a higher level, preferably created by a true saint expert.”

“No problem.” Lord Tianshou was silent for a moment, then he took out another list and gave it to Jian Wushuang.

There were fewer sword skill manuals on this list, but there were still tens of thousands of them.

Jian Wushuang selected a few sword skill manuals and browsed through them for a while, but he secretly shook his head.

It was true that these sword skills involved the rules of space-time, but the power of the rules of space-time was not very profound. It was not too difficult for Jian Wushuang, so it was naturally less helpful.

Even though the sword skill manuals were of a higher level, Jian Wushuang was still somewhat dissatisfied.

“Although these sword skill manuals are extraordinary, I’m afraid there are only a few of them that can enlighten me and help me a lot. Most importantly, I don’t know which direction I should go.” Jian Wushuang frowned.

At first, he wanted to ask Lord Tianshou to recommend to him which sword skill he should choose, but he was unfortunately rejected by Lord Tianshou.

According to Lord Tianshou, he could judge the sword art that would help him the most according to Jian Wushuang’s current situation. However, he would not tell Jian Wushuang that he would have to pay a price, at least 100 million sacred elixirs!

Jian Wushuang was helpless about this.

“Forget it. It won’t be long before I become a heaven-grade member of the Heaven-slaying Alliance. By then, heaven-grade members will have more authority, and the value of the treasures they can exchange for will be higher. When that time comes, I will carefully come here and choose a sword art manual that is suitable for me to comprehend,” Jian Wushuang muttered, he had already made up his mind.

After leaving the Treasure Pavilion, Jian Wushuang returned to the counter of the secret lair.

“Accept the mission,” Jian Wushuang said directly and took out his identity token at the same time.

In front of the counter was a demonic youth with long purple hair. The demonic youth glanced at Jian Wushuang with a faint silver luster in his eyes and did not pay much attention to it. However, when he took the identity token from Jian Wushuang, his expression suddenly changed.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis? You are Heavenly Sword Marquis?” The devilish purple-haired young man stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes, it’s me. What’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang asked with a frown.

“Oh, it’s like this.” The devilish purple-haired young man immediately reacted. “Mr. Heavenly Sword Marquis, not long ago, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance sent an order saying that a Lord from the headquarters of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance has personally rushed to the endless territory to see you. Therefore, he asked us to inform you when we see you. If you have nothing urgent, please wait here for a moment. I’ll immediately send a message to the higher-ups. The Lord will come to see you soon.”

“A big shot from the headquarters of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance wants to see me?” Jian Wushuang was startled and immediately became alert.

However, he immediately relaxed.

He could tell that the big shot from the headquarters of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance was not here to find trouble with him. After all, if the Heaven-cleaving Alliance wanted to harm him, they would not have told him to wait here in advance.

Now, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance probably had only one purpose.

Jian Wushuang had vaguely guessed the purpose of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

“How long will it take for the big shot to arrive?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It shouldn’t take three days,” the purple-haired demonic youth said.

The headquarters of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance was indeed very far from the endless territory, but there were many space passages in between. It did not take too long to travel from the headquarters of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to the endless territory. Three days was enough.

“Well, I’ll wait here for three days,” Jian Wushuang agreed.

Three days passed quickly.

“Mr. Heavenly Marquis Jian, the Lord has arrived. Please follow me.” The purple-haired demonic youth appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and led him to the inner hall of the nest.

There was almost no light in the darkroom.

Under the guidance of the purple-haired demonic youth, Jian Wushuang came to the darkroom.

As soon as he arrived, Jian Wushuang saw an old figure with his back facing him.

The old figure was not tall, and he was very thin. He had his hands behind his back and did not emit any aura.

However, the moment Jian Wushuang saw the old figure, he felt as if he saw a complete space-time.

Yes, a space-time that was completely independent and incompatible with the surrounding world.

This space-time was so strange that Jian Wushuang was stunned at the first moment.

He did not expect that there could be two space-time in the world at the same time. One was the space-time under the natural circulation of the Heavenly Dao. What he saw now was clearly a new space-time formed by the old figure with great means.

In this new space-time, except for himself, no one else’s space-time power would have any effect

The move that Jian Wushuang was good at, the heaven-designated skill, caused the space-time to be temporarily frozen. However, no matter how powerful his move was, even if it was ten or a hundred times stronger, it would not affect the old figure at all.

Because the old figure was completely in a new time and space.
