Chapter 5493 ¬†Praising Each Other

The acquisition of a complete Universe Origin Source is the most challenging task, and no one would attempt it.

Obtaining the Universe Origin Source can be achieved through two relatively simple methods: either by destroying an Original Universe or by slaying a Universe Master. Either way, Wu Zuo couldn't manage it.

If he were to solely pursue the inheritance of a Universe Master, he could manage to put together a set of it.

By presenting some treasures and speaking favorably to the Vermilion Bird Temple Master, he might be able to obtain it. If that didn't work, he could always spend a considerable sum to purchase one from the Elder Palace.

However, when it came to the Universe Origin Source, there was simply no way for him to obtain it. It was truly a difficult situation.

Observing the frustrated Wu Zuo, Zhen Ling shifted his gaze away and calmly said, "Since you don't have the means to pay, go and do something for me. Accomplish the acquisition of that Universe Origin Source, and I'll cover the cost. If you fail, then go and mine in the cave!"

"Yes!" Wu Zuo readily agreed.

It had come to this point, and there was no other option.

The Demon Sound Divine General didn't fall for Zhen Ling's tactics.

Later on, he could deceive Dongshen and Wanyan. Even if he had to significantly boost their courage, they wouldn't dare to claim the Universe Master's inheritance.

If worst came to worst, he could let them cultivate his own inheritance.

As an Ultimate Emperor, the supreme techniques he created weren't much inferior to those Universe Masters.

It would be sufficient; once his strength grew, he could then seek the Universe inheritance on the Grave God Mountain.

"Moyin, you can step back. I have something to discuss with Wu Zuo," Zhen Ling waved his hand, indicating the Demon Sound Divine General to leave.

Divine General Moyin respectfully saluted and then departed. He had no intention of staying longer in this place. He didn't care to know what Zhen Ling and Wu Zuo were going to talk about.

Now, Jian Wushuang and the others were waiting for him on the other side, like hungry fledglings, anticipating his return to nourish them.

However, this time, he had somewhat disappointed them.

On the Demon Sound Mountain, beneath the Demon-Sealing Space.

Jian Wushuang, Dongshen, and Wanyan chatted happily.

All three of them succeeded, a result they never anticipated. Before crossing the single-log bridge, they had prepared for the possibility of falling into oblivion. Unexpectedly, they all succeeded.

"Daoist Wushuang, you are truly remarkable. It's understandable that Dongshen could pass, considering he's already become an Emperor. But for you, a Dao Lord, to cross successfully, I truly admire you wholeheartedly!" Wanyan raised his wine cup, clinked it with Jian Wushuang's, and then took a sip.

The trio was so elated that by the time they waited for the arrival of Divine General Moyin, they had already started drinking at the location.

Afterward, they made plans to celebrate for several days and also decided to introduce some tier 5 Emperors from the Original Universe to Jian Wushuang.

After all, they were all powerful beings from the same hometown universe, and naturally, they needed to become closer in the future.

On the Grave God Mountain now, their universe was no longer the dominant force.

More and more powerful beings from different universes were rising, and they had started forming alliances for mutual protection.

It was time for them to establish the influence of the Original Universe, and this matter was urgent.

If Zhen Ling were to find out that the successors he nurtured were already preparing to establish their own forces, one could only wonder what he would think.

Upon hearing Wanyan's words, Dongshen laughed and scolded, "Wanyan, you're just jealous of me!"

The three of them shared a similar smile and then raised their cups again.

They exchanged compliments for a while.

"Daoist Dongshen, when do you plan to go to the Grave God Mountain?" Jian Wushuang asked, steering the conversation back to business.

Wanyan, seeing this, also became serious.

This time, they all successfully crossed the single-log bridge.

Although Wanyan did not break through in the realm of the black hole, unexpectedly, he made a breakthrough in Heart Power, directly reaching the completion-stage of Heart power.

Many supreme-peak beings hadn't reached this level, but Wanyan had advanced to the forefront.

After this outing, even without the inheritance of the Universe Master, Wanyan could rapidly shatter the mirror and strive for the position of a tier 6 Emperor.

Jian Wushuang suffered a rather miserable loss this time. Coming down the narrow bridge, he was left battered and bruised. It could be said that he had thrown in the towel, and now all that remained was for the Universe Origin Source to replenish his vitality.

Upon hearing this, Dongshen responded nonchalantly, "I'm not in a hurry now. I'll set out after completing the inheritance."

"I also plan to make a trip to the Earth Realm. I heard it's quite chaotic there. It's a good opportunity to explore a bit. However, I won't stay too long. Afterward, I'll make a round in the human realm and then head to the God's Tomb!"

Jian Wushuang felt a stir in his heart. He hadn't expected the other party to have such a well-thought-out plan, and he couldn't help but feel a bit envious.

However, since the other had chosen to venture into the Earth Realm midway, there was a chance Jian Wushuang could catch up and they could travel together.

When Zhen Ling had mentioned not seeking external help, it didn't exclude fellow Inheritors of the God's Tomb who were on the same journey‚Äîit wasn't considered asking for help.

"You're heading to the Earthly Realm for exploration? How long do you plan to stay there?" Wanyan asked. His thoughts align with Jian Wushuang's. The more companions we they had on the journey, the better.

Dongshen hesitated for a moment before saying, "It depends on the situation. It could be as short as 1,000 years or as long as an epoch."

"Within an epoch, then?" Wanyan commented, "You can wait for me. I estimate I can break through within a billion years, utilizing the lowest time flow rate, which would take a mere million years."

During ordinary seclusion, the required flow rate wouldn't be too high. Only in urgent situations would one activate time flow rates of tens of thousands or even millions.

"An epoch!" Jian Wushuang sighed in relief. With the blessing of the Universe Origin Source, even a pig could break through within an epoch.

Dongshen and Wanyan looked at Jian Wushuang simultaneously, asking, "Dao Friend Wushuang, are you planning to break through the Emperor before heading to the God's Tomb?"

"Yes, otherwise, with my current strength, I might lag behind," Jian Wushuang replied without any need for courtesy, stating the truth.

If he didn't integrate with the Dao, with his current strength, even if the other party kindly offered to take him along, he wouldn't have the face to go.

The strong always possess pride and dignity; he didn't want to be led by others.

Both of them understood that after living for so many years, there was nothing they hadn't come to terms with.

Jian Wushuang's ability to defy the heavens and the hope of successfully merging with the Dao seemed doubtful.

They didn't inquire further, just offered their blessings.

Jian Wushuang also smiled and nodded, accepting this goodwill.

His path to merging with the Dao was still quite long.

Firstly, achieving completion and perfection, then eliminating the karmic obstacles, and thus, the Dao Merge.

For one epoch, he lacked confidence.

From weakness to the present, in terms of normal time progression, it had only been several hundred thousand years.

But when considering the flow of time, especially during the time spent in the starry sky, it might have been several epochs.

His mindset had already undergone a profound change.

Especially in terms of the perception of time, one epoch wasn't really that long.

Jian Wushuang had always been in a hurry, particularly in terms of time, racing against the clock, not daring to waste a moment.

After successfully merging with the Dao in the future, he planned to rest for a while‚Äînot too long, just a few thousand years would do. He would calm his mind, leave the Qishen Temple, and visit the Great Si Region. G·∫πtt the lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvùíÜls at ùíè.o/(v)/e/l/biùíè(.)coùíé

Returning to the world he once knew, he would see those old friends.
