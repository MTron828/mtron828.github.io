Chapter 5313: Take the Sword

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Numerous swords radiating light soared into the sky, accompanied by a golden sword.

On the side, Elder Jiu Jian and even the Shangqing Palace Master raised their hands, and a burst of sword energy surged towards the mountaintop.

In no time, 99,000 swords from the Shangqing Palace gathered on the mountaintop.

The condensed sword energy transformed into tidal waves, sweeping down from the mountaintop.

Even Jian Wushuang, who had seen much in his cultivation journey, couldnt help but feel his mind shake at the sight.

He couldnt resist the urge to dive into the sword tide.

Gazing at the sword tide, various sword dao origin sources emerged, and Jian Wushuang carefully pondered, seeking to gain some insights.

The entire sword tide lasted for an hour, a short time but of extraordinary significance, assisting the visiting sword cultivators and showcasing the power of the Shangqing Palace.

Indeed, it was formidable. In those sword lights, Jian Wushuang could discern at least nineteen swords, representing the tier 5 Emperors origin source.

Judging by the intensity, these could likely rival the origin sources of tier 4 Emperors in the outside world.

Tier 6 Emperors, only two swordsbelonging to the Shangqing Palace Master and the Shangqing Patriarchs Sword Dao origin source.

Tier 4 Emperors were more numerous, numbering in the hundreds.

Tier 3 Emperors exceeded a thousand.

A sect comparable to a universe.

While marveling at the depth of the Qishen Temples heritage, Jian Wushuang also felt a sense of sorrow.NnÃªw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

The origin sources of these cultivators all had flaws, too weak.

Compared to the Emperors in the outside world, they lagged behind by a level. In terms of combat power, they might only be half as inferior, but the upper limit was considerably lower.

No wonder the importance of an Ultimate Emperor surpassed the combined strength of the native practitioners of the Four Great Secret Realms.

If that Ultimate Emperor reached tier 6, one person could probably slaughter the entire Four Great Secret Realms.

Even the Special Life Forms in Gods Tomb would be unable to stop them. This was the true might of the ultimate power.

As the sword tide concluded, Jian Wushuang stood up, feeling somewhat unsatisfied.

In terms of origin source, he didnt need references, but in terms of Sword Intent, he still had much to learn.

Friend Jian Wushuang, are you interested in participating in a sparring match after the sword tide? Elder Jiu Jian inquired.

Sparring match?

The Sword Tide event at the Shangqing Palace concluded, setting up thirteen

platforms on the lake. The current Thirteen Taia Sword successors of the Shangqing Palace would personally guard these platforms.

Those who could become Taia Sword successors at the Shangqing Palace were not ordinary individuals; their strengths rivaled Emperors. The leader among the thirteen had even achieved victories against Emperors.

Ah, then I look forward to it, Jian Wushuang replied.

He was not in a hurry. Although there were only two days, one day had already passed. Battles among the powerful were fleeting, and he would wait for the right moment to make his move.

After receiving nods from the Shangqing Palace Master and some elders, Elder Jiu Jian personally stood up to preside over the event.

Everyone, here are 13 golden swords. Each sword carries the original essence of swordsmanship left by our Shangqing Ancestor. Whoever can claim a platform will be awarded a golden sword!

After Elder Jiu Jian spoke, he tossed the 13 golden swords into the air, suspending them above the lake.

Golden swords! Many sword cultivators gazed eagerly at those golden swords.

The origin source Sword Dao of the Shangqing Patriarch!

If one could obtain one, careful contemplation would bring endless benefits. Even if they didnt use the golden sword themselves, they could exchange it for countless treasures to enhance their own cultivation.

There was once a wandering cultivator who obtained a golden sword, and he was specially invited by the Shangqing Palace to become a core disciple, equivalent in status to the Thirteen Taia Swords.

A Dao Lord from a small sect also won a golden sword and auctioned it off on the spot, selling it for a sky-high price of one hundred thousand divine stones.

One hundred thousand divine stones were comparable to the wealth of some Emperors.

The crowd held their breath, awaiting the descent of the golden sword. Many Dao Lords were rubbing their hands in anticipation, ready for a challenge.

At this moment, thirteen platforms rose from the surface of the lake, each with a sword-wielding figure standing atop, both male and female.

These individuals were disciples of the Taia Sword.bender

The Taia Sword was not created by the founding ancestor of the Shangqing Palace but was established by a disciple of the founding ancestor.

The disciple who created the Taia Sword achieved this extraordinary skill when he was a tier 4 Emperor. It allowed Dao Lords to fully unleash their strength and even possessed the ability to amplify their origin source.

Unfortunately, he passed away at a young age, having just reached tier 4 Emperor. The founding ancestor, enraged by this, wielded a sword with chilling brilliance, shaking the entire Northern Region.

Overnight, he annihilated 16 Emperors involved in the matter, four of whom were tier 5 Emperors.

These Emperors were no ordinary individuals; each had a backing sect. However, not a single sect dared to intervene on their behalf. They were left without anyone to claim their bodies.

The Shangqing ancestors actions during this incident earned him a formidable reputation in the celestial realms.

Taixu Sect, Han Wuxing challenges the Seventh Tai t a Sword!

Whoosh!

A Dao Lord from the third row soared into the air and landed directly on the seventh platform.

His strength was only at the level of a half-step Emperor, making it challenging for him to seize the golden sword!

Simultaneously, the second, third, and fourth Dao Lords stepped forward, instantly occupying 13 platforms with their formidable presence.

The weakest among them were peak-level Dao Lords.

Jian Wushuang swept a glance, identifying the strongest among the thirteen there was little hope of seizing the golden sword. The Sword Dao of a tier 6 Emperors oorigin source!

Such an opportunity greatly stirred him.

The Thirteen Taia Swords of the Shangqing Palace were all formidable, yet their origin sources were somewhat weaker.

In terms of strength, the intensity of their origin source was on par with the Dao Lords of the Original Universe.

In terms of combat prowess, they rivaled the indigenous Emperors but fell short compared to those from the outside.

On the whole, they were a half-step weaker than the external powerhouses.

The half-step Emperors here might only possess the combat strength of the Dao Lords from the Original Universe.

To match an Emperors strength, there could be half-step Emperors, and those capable of defeating Emperors would possess strengths comparable to Emperors.

That seemed to be the general idea!

However, without the opportunity presented by the Qishen Temple, it was likely that the Grand Yan Immortals of the Original Universe, at their peak, would only be on par with the Emperors and could contend with the local geniuses.

But this was just one ancient sect.

The Four Great Secret Realms were vast, and the talents of this sect were only a fraction of what the Original Universe possessed in terms of quality. Now, with the opportunity provided by the Qishen Temple, things were uncertain.

Just looking at the Grand Yan Immortals he encountered, Wan Xing, Hu Qing, Ji Chaoyang, and even himself were much stronger than those Thirteen Taia Swords.

Ji Chaoyang, with his Nine Revolutions, had the combat power of a Dao Lord and could directly match an Emperor when perfected. In the Four Great Secret

Realms, he had the strength to slay ordinary Emperors.

Even the current Jian Wushuang, without having completed the Nine Revolutions, could reach the point of slaying native Emperors.

Of the Thirteen Taia Swords, he was confident in defeating all except the Sword Leader. The strength of the Sword Leader was elusive.

That guys divine body was powerful, undoubtedly surpassing his own, but it was uncertain if it had reached a level thousands of times greater.

The origin source was mediocre, only an ordinary second-grade origin source.

In the showdown, the 13 individuals were defeated quickly. If it werent for sparing some face for these young masters, they would likely be defeated almost instantly..
