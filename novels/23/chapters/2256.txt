Chapter 2257 Reincarnation Pearl

“The link passage was formed by the hands of those Masters of Holy Land at the Absolute Beginning Divine World! The last time the passage was formed, I was in such a bad condition I could not even awaken. But this time is different. Seven Star Black Sect experts, myself and many more have all awaken. We are afraid the Absolute Beginning Divine World may send another batch of experts to ignite a war,” One-Star Man’s voice was solemn.Jian Wushuang could not help but sink into despair.

One-Star Man’s worries were the same as his.

The last time the link passage had opened, Absolute Beginning Divine World had sent many experts down to clear the land.

Luckily, experts of the First Era had given it their all and sacrificed much to protect the land they stood on.

But if they were to send another batch of experts...

“But it’s obvious I am overthinking it. The formation that sealed up the land is way more powerful than it was before. Unless the Masters of Holy Land are willing to sacrifice their own lives to open the passage... I don’t think they will ever do it,” One-Star Man laughed.

Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh of relief.

Emperor Thirteen had said the same thing previously. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

But he dared not be complacent.

“Does it mean you intend to resume sleeping after the link passage closes 3,900 years later?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Indeed,” One-Star Man nodded. “Though the formation sealed this earth away from Absolute Beginning Divine World, giving the Seven Star Divine Realm and Seven Star Black Sect a chance to survive, the formation takes 99% of spiritual energy from this land to operate. In such an environment, sleeping is the only way to survive.”

From what One-Star Man said, he learnt that the cultivating environment was deteriorating due to the formation.

“Senior, I know a place, a cultivating environment that is way better than Eternal Chaotic World, and the spiritual energy rises across time, maybe you should go there,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Hmm?”

“Such a place exists?” One-Star Man was shocked.

“My hometown, Green Fire World. I could take you there if you want,” Jian Wushuang said.

“No rush, I still have some resources to move around. It’s been so long since I woke up, I’m not in a hurry to go back to sleep, but I’ll consider heading there once the link passage closes,” One-Star Man laughed.

“I will be there to receive you,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Oh, if I’m not wrong, you’ve mastered a bit of Reincarnation Rules of Order?” One-Star Man asked him suddenly.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He knew One-Star Man was a super expert in spacetime rules.

Every move he made contained terrifying Reincarnation Power.

It was normal that he could sense that Jian Wushuang had mastered a bit of Reincarnation Rules of Order as well.

“When I last met you at the Buddhist Demon Sea, I gave you an opportunity, but that was my consciousness embodiment at that time, and that opportunity will be meaningless for you now. Let me pass you something else,” One-Star Man took out a grey pearl.

The grey pearl exuded a grey murky aura and looked very mysterious.

“This is...?” Jian Wushuang looked at it confused.

“Something I made in my pinnacle period, the Reincarnation Pearl. Not very powerful, but it has a small-scaled reincarnation for you to master a bit of Reincarnation Rules of Order. You only made contact with Reincarnation Doctrine, not the full Reincarnation Rules of Order yet. It should benefit you,” One-Star Man smiled.

“Thank you,” Jian Wushuang took it without hesitation and was elated.

“You’re welcome. Remember, after the link passage closes, I’ll be bothering you at Green Fire World, don’t go complaining at that time,” One-Star Man smiled.

“No way, your presence would be Green Fire World’s honour,” Jian Wushuang replied.

It was true.

If it were another Ancient Era expert, even from the Seven Star Black Sect, Jian Wushuang may not have invited them over.

Because he did not know how those experts were.

But One-Star Man was different.

He was indebted to him.

And after two interactions, Jian Wushuang could tell he had no ill intentions.

Jian Wushuang naturally welcomed him to the Green Fire World.

“Now that’s settled, I’ll make a move first,” One-Star Man said and vanished.

Jian Wushuang sent him off respectfully, heaving a sigh of relief after One-Star Man had left his Soul sensing range. He gazed upon that Reincarnation Pearl.

“Reincarnation Pearl? This grey pearl?”

He thought of the grey pearl that helped with Inverse Cultivation.

The Reincarnation Pearl had a similar material to the Inverse Cultivation grey pearl, but it gave Jian Wushuang a completely different feeling. Without much thought, Jian Wushuang left.

Not long after Jian Wushuang had left, a figure re-appeared at that Void. It was One-Star Man.

He still had that faint smile on his face, but now he was holding onto a transmission token.

“As per your instructions, I’ve passed the pearl to the lad. I told him the pearl would help him with Reincarnation Power, but not its real purpose,” One-Star Man said.

“Understood,” a cold voice came from the other side of the token.

One-Star Man smiled and left.
