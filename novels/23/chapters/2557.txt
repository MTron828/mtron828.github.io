Chapter 2558: Hiding His Abilities

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Although Jian Wushuang appeared to be sitting there calmly, his expression was very serious with a slight frown.

He first looked at Pei Qi’s corpse then at San Shouwang and frowned even harder.

“Even though this Pei Qi guy did not seem externally injured, his internal organs have completely broken into pieces despite being a true Earth Ultimate God! He also has all sorts of protective means defending his body when San Shouwang collides with him. However, he utilized his defensive tactics to break Pei Qi’s internal organs into shreds after dissolving Pei Qi’s blade-light. That energy must be...” Jian Wushuang was secretly shocked.

“San Shouwang... Even though Pei Qi’s blade struck open the Divine Destruction Armor on his body’s surface and caused some harm to his divine body, it isn’t enough to make him puke blood and weaken his aura to that point!

“If I’m not mistaken, San Shouwang’s blood puking and aura decrease are nothing but an act. He’s been hiding his true abilities!”

Jian Wushuang felt heavy at heart.

Hiding his abilities!

Yes, San Shouwang had been hiding his abilities.

He had been deliberately hiding his true abilities not only in the battle where he killed Pei Qi but also in the three prior challenges.

As for his motive, it was simply because he wanted to put on an act in front of everyone by giving them the false assumption that his abilities were not flawless and probably just slightly above a regular Earth Ultimate God. In this way, he could attract more Earth Ultimate Gods to challenge him, destroy them one by one, and steal their treasures.

At that very moment, almost everyone on the scene including those Peak Ultimate Gods thought that San Shouwang had suffered some injuries even though he had killed Pei Qi.

However, that thought could not be further from the truth.

“This guy...” Jian Wushuang was not happy.

Sooner or later, he was going to challenge San Shouwang after all.

However, his true abilities were far from his imagination.

In the Combat Ring, San Shouwang took away Pei Qi’s Interspatial Ring and all of his other treasures before waving his hand and immediately destroyed Pei Qi’s body.

After that, San Shouwang looked over at the few Official Army commanders and said, “I’m quite badly injured this time and need to enter a retreat for a while to recover. I won’t accept any more challenges within a thousand years.”

“Yes, sir.” The Official Army commanders nodded heavily.

San Shouwang left in a flash.

Following San Shouwang’s departure, the millions of audiences outside the Combat Ring began to stir.

“Too powerful! His Excellency the Territorial Lord is really too powerful!”

“That Mr. Pei Qi was also a very powerful Earth Ultimate God, but was still killed!”

“His Excellency is invincible within the Northern Darkstar Territory!”

“Invincible, invincible!!!”

Many cultivators began shouting in a frenzy.

Jian Wushuang slowly stood up at the Situ Clan seats.

“Mr. Jian Yi, are you ready to return home?” Situ Yuan immediately stood up. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Yes, I learn a lot from today’s battle and should return home and begin cultivating as well.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Farewell then. By the way, we started converting those resources and progress is pretty good.” Situ Yuan smiled.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and left with Xiao Tiexin.

On the way back, Xiao Tiexin asked, “Mr. Jian Yi, what are your thoughts about today’s battle?”

Jian Wushuang directly answered, “Both Pei Qi and the Territorial Lord, San Shouwang were very powerful. Their battle prowess was truly worthy of Earth Ultimate Gods, but San Shouwang is a lot scarier than Pei Qi.”

“A lot scarier?” Xiao Tiexin was confused. “I thought San Shouwang was severely injured by Pei Qi? They aren’t that far apart in terms of abilities, right?”

“Haha.” Jian Wushuang laughed before briefly telling her his observations.

“Hiding his abilities? San Shouwang’s injury was a deliberate act?” Xiao Tiexin was shocked.

Jian Wushuang said, “Indeed. His true ability is a lot stronger than what we saw. Pei Qi had died in vain. If he earlier knew about San Shouwang’s hidden abilities, he won’t even dare challenge him. However, his death isn’t worthless. At least, it has made me more aware of San Shouwang and helped me gain a more thorough understanding of San Shouwang’s abilities.

“If I’m capable in the future, I’ll help him avenge the Pei Clan and won’t forget about the Xiao Clan too.”

Xiao Tiexin nodded lightly.

Even though Jian Wushuang made that promise, he also knew very well that his abilities were still a far cry from San Shouwang.

He would even have difficulty withstanding Pei Qi, not to mention San Shouwang.

Jian Wushuang mumbled, “Let’s go back and continue seclusion training. Observing the two Earth Ultimate God’s battle is of immense help to my cultivation.”

He very soon returned to his residence and continued his retreat.

At the same time...

The Territorial Lord Residence’s gigantic underground palace was surrounded by layers of restrictive shields with the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord, San Shouwang sitting alone in lotus style.

However, his pale expression and incredibly weak aura shown only a while ago at the Combat Ring were at that moment as strong as before with no trace of having suffered any injuries. He had an extremely indifferent look on his face.

As Jian Wushuang speculated, the injuries and blood puking were all an act. Even those words he spoke to the commanders about him not accepting any more challenges in a thousand years were something he deliberately said.

He did not suffer even a bit of injury.

An Interspatial Ring floated before him.

It was the one Pei Qi left behind after his death.

“Haha, Pei Qi really did not disappoint! He wandered alone outside of the territory, became an Earth Ultimate God, and accumulated so many treasures in his Interspatial Ring on top of many Primordial Stones. I only annihilated the Xiao Clan not long ago and obtained a great amount of wealth including the Stately Painting and I’ve now acquired all of Pei Qi’s treasures. The total amount of wealth I’ve accumulated is quite handsome and I’m not so far from achieving the Divine Destructive Beast’s fourth volume.”

Divine Destructive Beast was a powerful secret technique that San Shouwang had been cultivating.

In the battle with Pei Qi, the incredibly powerful secret technique had unleashed such terrifying power despite not even in its complete form.

All those years, San Shouwang tried every method to gather resources and wealth to advance his Divine Destructive Beast Secret Technique.

At that moment, he had cultivated the secret technique’s first three volumes, and soon the fourth volume would be within his reach.

“Who should I obtain the remaining Primordial Stones from?

“Should I simply find a mid-tier clan or should I seek the Situ Clan...”

San Shouwang began to ponder.
