Chapter 3073: Two Possibilities

——

“Is it because of the Heaven-cleaving mystic realm?” Iceberg could not help thinking.

Bai Jue looked at Jian Wushuang expectantly, waiting for his answer.

Jian Wushuang pondered for a moment, but in the end, he still apologized, “I’m sorry, Master Bai Jue, I have no intention of joining a force for the time being.”

“Don’t reject me yet.”

Bai Jue waved his hand and said, “I have a certain friendship with the founder of the Young Divine Sect, which is why I rarely come here. I’ll stay here for a while, and Iceberg will stay with me. During this time, if you have any problems in cultivation or sword principle, you can come to me or Iceberg at any time. As for joining the Dao Palace, you can think about it. When Iceberg and I leave, you can give us an answer.”

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Bai Jue smiled and looked at Sect Master Si Lan. “Sect Master Si Lan, Iceberg, and I would like to disturb you for a while. Is that possible?”

“Of course.” Sect Master Si Lan was pleasantly surprised. “If you and Mr. Iceberg are willing to be our guests, our sect would love to have you.”

“Thank you very much.” Bai Jue smiled gratefully.

“Master Bai Jue, aren’t you smart?” Mo Shan asked with a strange laugh.

Bai Jue glanced at Mo Shan and snorted.

“Forget it. I’ve already received the orders from the three Palace Masters. I won’t stay any longer. Remember, I’ll come back to you in 80 years. Be prepared and don’t miss this opportunity. If you miss it, it’ll be 10,000 years before the next opening of the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm,” Mo Shan warned.

“I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Mo Shan soon left, while Bai Jue and Iceberg stayed in the Young Divine Sect.

In the room where Jian Wushuang lived.

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged alone, but his expression was strange.

“The Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm is such an important place. How could the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces give me a place?” Jian Wushuang murmured.

He still could not figure out why the three Palace Masters gave him a place to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm.

Was it because he was talented and had great potential?

However, no matter how great his potential was, he was not a member of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. Even if the three Palace Masters wanted to recruit him, they would not give him such a precious place, right?

“It’s not just because I’m talented and have great potential. There must be another reason. But what is the reason?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

After a while, he shook his head and said, “Who cares? The Heaven-cleaving Alliance is not my enemy. Now that such a great opportunity is coming for me, I have no reason to refuse it. As for the Dao Palace, I don’t need to pay attention to it for the time being!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Jian Wushuang thought to himself, but he suddenly found something interesting.

The three Freedom Alliances in the Divine Beginning World, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, the Spacetime Temple, and the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect, were all related to him.

First was the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. He was a heaven rank member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Although he did not have many restrictions, he could barely be considered an expert under the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Moreover, he had already agreed to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, when that time came, his relationship with the Heaven-cleaving Alliance would definitely become even closer.

He did not have much of a relationship with the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect. However, the key point was that he had previously obtained Xue Bei’s mantle. Xue Bei was an expert under the blood ancestor lineage of the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect. He had also promised Xue Bei that when he became powerful…he would rush to the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect, which made him have a certain relationship with the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect.

As for the Spacetime Temple…among the three Freedom Alliances, the first one that Jian Wushuang had come into contact with was the Spacetime Temple!

When he had obtained the mysterious golden stone, he had crossed the spacetime temple in the golden stone and cultivated the spacetime divine skill. At that time, he had already been a member of the Spacetime Temple.

He had a close relationship with the three Freedom Alliances.

Fortunately, the three Freedom Alliances and the power of the will of heaven were not on the same level, and they were even enemies.

“For me now, any one of the three Freedom Alliances is a colossus. I can’t resist any expert from the Three Alliances. I don’t need to bother with them. They won’t attack me for no reason anyway. I’d better seize the time to improve my strength,” Jian Wushuang thought.

At all times, Jian Wushuang firmly believed that his absolute strength was the only asset he could rely on.

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang suddenly waved his hand, and an ice-cold expert’s corpse appeared in front of him.

This corpse was the corpse of the Principles Master that he had obtained in the Blood North Mystic Realm.

He was going to use this corpse to refine his Emperor’s Destiny Avatar!

“Let’s begin!”

Jian Wushuang began to refine his first Emperor’s Destiny Avatar in the Young Divine Sect.

At this moment, in another manor of the Young Divine Sect, Bai Jue and Iceberg were sitting together.

“Sir, I don’t understand,” Iceberg said, “although Heavenly Sword Marquis has some talent, it’s not worth our Dao Palace spending so much money to invite him. Moreover, he has already declined, but you still want me to stay here with you and give him the opportunity and time to consider. Is it just because the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces gave him a spot to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm?”

“This alone is enough.” Bai Jue smiled. “You are also a member of the Dao Palace. Although you have not reached the level of a Principles Master, you are still an Invincible Immortal Saint. You have come into contact with many things. You should know what kind of place the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm is.”

“To put it bluntly, anyone who enters the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm will be able to obtain a great fortune. With such a great opportunity, how many geniuses of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces would have to go through such a fierce battle to obtain the last three spots?”

“And now, these three spots are given to the Heavenly Sword Marquis, which means that the geniuses from the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces only have two spots. How great a sacrifice is this?” The three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces were not stupid. Unless there was a special reason, they would never give such an order.”

“What special reason?” Iceberg was puzzled.

“I don’t know.” Bai Jue shook his head. “But according to my guess, there are only two possibilities.”

“The first possibility is that this Heavenly Sword Marquis has unparalleled talent, and is at least much more powerful than the geniuses in the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces’ Primal Chaos Palace!”

“The second possibility is that this Heavenly Sword Marquis has some special background or identity, so the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces used the quota of the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm to express their goodwill to him.”
