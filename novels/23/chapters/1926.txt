1927 Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai

Consciousness embodiment!

Different from consciousness incarnation!

The incarnation was merely made of consciousness but not any other power. It was only consciousness.

However, consciousness embodiment had a certain level of fighting power and one’s fighting power would be related to a person’s personal power and strength.

Emperor Bai knew some experts from ancient times who were extremely powerful would form consciousness embodiment and go on war.

However, he never expected that Emperor Thirteen, who he had to go all-out to deal with, was merely a consciousness embodiment.

His consciousness embodiment was already this powerful, what if he came personally?

“Experts from ancient times…” Emperor Bai clenched his pale fist.

The surrounding experts saw that Emperor Thirteen suddenly disappeared and they were confused.

Especially Jian Wushuang.

He had no idea why would Emperor Thirteen suddenly lend him a helping hand.

Theoretically, he should have nothing to do with Emperor Thirteen.

Previously, he had interrupted the other party in ancient battlefield.

Theoretically, even if he were to kill him directly, there wouldn’t be any misunderstanding.

But in the end, not only would Emperor Thirteen not kill him, but he also left a mark in his body. When he was in danger, Emperor Thirteen revealed himself to save him.

Not only saving him, Emperor Thirteen even struck a deal with Emperor Bai to take care of him before he left.

It was obvious that only one would do that if they were related.

But honestly speaking, Jian Wushuang didn’t even know who Emperor Thirteen was. He only knew that he came from ancient times.

Besides that, he knew nothing.

Swoosh!

Then, there was a figure that moved and appeared next to Emperor Bai.

“Mister Emperor Bai,” Purple Moon Emperor greeted politely.

They were both Great Emperors. However, when Purple Moon Emperor was talking to Emperor Bai, it was like a Sir God or Emperor God speaking to a Great Emperor.

It was very normal. Although Emperor Bai was in Great Emperor Realm, his power had surpassed Great Emperor.

“I just got here and I have no idea about what happened earlier. You tell me,” Emperor Bai glanced at Purple Moon Emperor.

“Yes,” Purple Moon Emperor nodded and immediately told him everything he knew briefly.

It included how barbaric Abysmal Saint Master was. He didn’t care how Purple Moon Emperor stopped him but attacked Jian Wushuang directly.

It also included how Abysmal Saint Master had destroyed his consciousness incarnation.

Of course, he also told Emperor Bai the scene where the mysterious arrogant man in the white robe, Emperor Thirteen, was defeated Abysmal Saint Master.

“Is that so?” Emperor Bai heard and nodded faintly. Then, his pair of white eyes looked around, “The war stops here now. Everyone go back to where you come from.”

Emperor Bai’s voice was filled with authority.

All the experts at the scene heard and didn’t dare to go against his command. They bowed at Emperor Bai politely, one after another, and immediately left.

When the two alliances left, there wasn’t unwillingness and they were glad.

After all, they were already defeated. If they were to continue to fight, Lineage of Star would only massacre them.

Just as the experts from the two alliances left.

“Jian Wushuang, I wanted to make a trip to Lineage of Star. Will you welcome me?” Emperor Bai looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Emperor Bai came personally. You bring radiance to Lineage of Star. How can I refuse? Please,” Jian Wushuang wasn’t arrogant nor inferior.

Under the lead of Jian Wushuang, Emperor Bai and Purple Moon Emperor immediately walked to Lineage of Star.

In the middle of Universe Galaxy, in the lair of Lineage of Star, where Jian Wushuang resided, Sword Star.

In the lofty hall, there were only Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai.

As for the others, including Purple Moon Emperor, they were waiting outside.

Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai were sitting opposite one another while Emperor Bai held a cup of tea and sipped but never spoke.

Jian Wushuang looked humble but not fearful.

After a while, Emperor Bai finally put down the cup of tea. The pair of strange white eyes looked at Jian Wushuang, “Jian Wushuang, how long have you been in the state of Ultimate Real God?”

Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Ultimate Real God, such a title, he had never told anyone. Because Emperor Bai was like him, an inverse cultivator, he knew it naturally.

“It has already been tens of thousands of years,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Only tens of thousands of years?” Emperor Bai smiled faintly, “Back then, Real God Wu Bei was in Ultimate Real God stage much longer than you have been. He had been at the peak of Ultimate Real God stage for a very long time, and during that time, he requested to see me so many times and intended to obtain the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill from me. It was a pity that I never wanted to see him, do you know why?”

Jian Wushuang shook his head.

The sixth step of inverse cultivation skill was given to him by Real God Wu Bei. He had once talked to Real God Wu Bei as well and he knew how helpless Real God Wu Bei felt.

Real God Wu Bei had paid a great price in order to get the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill, but he had never got to see Emperor Bai even once before he died.

“I was not willing to see him because he was too weak,” Emperor Bai replied coldly, “Although he passed all three inverse cultivation test and also reached the peak of Ultimate Real God. However, besides his identity

“His comprehension towards doctrine and his opportunity to learn secret skill was extremely ordinary.”

“Even if I were to pass him the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill for him to breakthrough and reach Almighty level, he would at most possess the fighting power of a Great Emperor, or maybe even only be at the bottom of one. Because that was his limit!”

“Such fighting power would be too weak. To the entire Eternal Chaotic World, there would be almost no influence at all.

“If so, why would I want to see him? Why would I want to pass him the skill?”

Jian Wushuang was stunned and he was surprised.

Real God Wu Bei’s comprehension level wasn’t high, nor did he have a lot of opportunities. Jian Wushuang knew about that.

However, Emperor Bai wasn’t willing to pass Real God Wu Bei at the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill because he didn’t have high potential, which was something Jian Wushuang didn’t expect.

“Real God Wu Bei’s talent was ordinary, but you are different.”

Emperor Bai looked at Jian Wushuang, “You are very talented. You are stronger than I am and you are very fortunate. You carried a lot of opportunities on you. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have countless trump cards and skills. If you were to break through and become an Almighty, you could totally achieve something like me, if not become stronger. You would be extremely helpful to Eternal Chaotic World.

“Hence, I can give you the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill but only under one condition.”
