Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After Jian Wushuang left,

“Elder Qiu, Swordsman might really come to visit Elder Ling Han. Isn’t it a little overbearing to throw him out without checking?” Jun Yi said in a low voice.

“Jun Yi, you think highly of him. He is so young, how could he have a relationship with Elder Ling Han. It must because he heard about Elder Ling Han and came here to acknowledge Elder Ling Han as a master. Many came for that each year.” Qiu Ying didn’t take it seriously.

“Besides, Elder Ling Han and other Daluo Heaven Sect Elders are busy in an event. Even it was me, having no chance to see him, let alone him, how is it possible?”

“As for the token...”

Qiu Ying glanced at the token Jian Wushuang threw on the ground with disdain. While he looked at the token more carefully, his face changed at once.

“The token...” Qiu Ying stared at it, “is the Grand Elixir Token!”

Qiu Ying was struck dumb with amazement.

No matter Holy Emperor Palace or Alchemy School, they had their own token as a pledge. There was a special mark on it, no one dared to counterfeit it. Holy Emperor Token represented Holy Emperor Palace and Grand Elixir Token represented the Alchemy School.

“Could it be the Grand Elixir Token?” Qiu Ying was shocked with mouth and eyes opening wide.

...

A moment later, dozens of roars in Daluo Heaven Sect rose to the sky.

“Hurry up, act separately, find him!”

They were led by a silver-robed and grey-haired elder, who was the Ninth Elder of Daluo Heaven Sect–Ling Han, however, his face was filled with sadness now.

“Hum, you were so overbearing to throw him out without asking clearly. When did the people of Daluo Heaven Sect become so rampant?” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Qiu Ying, you better pray he hasn’t gone far, so that Daluo Heaven Sect could make up for this. Otherwise, you will be sacked from the Law-enforcing Elder position.” Ling Han scolded him with a raspy voice, “such a good-for-nothing.”

Scolded by Ling Han heavily, Qiu Ying lowered his head and dared not to look at him at all.

He knew he was in trouble this time.

He had never thought that such a young man who was about 20 years old at most could have such a background.

“Elder Ling Han, there he is.” Jun Yi, who followed as well, shouted suddenly.

Ling Han immediately looked down and found a black-robed man with a long sword on his back sitting quietly at the top of a mountain, who seemed to be waiting for them.

“Thank god, he is waiting for us, things aren’t going so bad.”

Ling Han breathed a sigh of relief when he saw Jian Wushuang, then he and others landed slowly in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Fellow Swordsman, I am Ling Han.” Ling Han said with a humble voice.

Jian Wushuang, sitting cross-legged on the ground, opened his eyes slowly. Then he closed his eyes again after glancing at them, saying, “Such an arrogant Daluo Heaven Sect, it’s hard to imagine what would become of you if you are one of the eight top sects in Nanyang Continent.”

“I must give you an apology for the oversight.” Ling Han played up to Jian Wushuang with a smile, then he glanced at Qiu Ying next to him, “come over here.”

Qiu Ying walked to Jian Wushuang in dejection and apologized, “Mr. Swordsman, please excuse me for having offended you just now, I’m so sorry.”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, glanced at Qiu Ying, “Daluo Heaven Sect is big and well-off and will soon replace Wilderness Sword Sect as one of the eight top sects in Nanyang Continent, how could you care about a young man?”

“Er...” Qiu Ying was embarrassed.

“Qiu Ying.” Ling Han looked at Qiu Ying and shouted, “From now on, you are removed from Law-enforcing Elder and will be punished by sweeping the floor in front of the mountain gate. Even if a normal Gold Core disciple comes to learn, you have to lead him into the sect respectfully. If you do it well, in three years, I will consider reinstating you, understand?”

Hearing this, Qiu Ying stood in astonishment, then he nodded vigorously.

After punishing Qiu Ying, Ling Han turned to Jian Wushuang with a smile, “Fellow Swordsman, what do you think now?”

Jian Wushuang raised his head, looked at Ling Han in surprise and then nodding slightly, “you are a reasonable elder in Daluo Heaven Sect.”

“Haha, since we have cleared the air, would you like to come over to have a chat.” Ling Han invited him.

“Okay,” Jian Wushuang didn’t refuse him this time.

Led by Ling Han, Jian Wushuang went to the Daluo Heaven Sect and walked into the same hall.

In the hall, Ling Han and Jian Wushuang sat on two chairs respectively. Qiu Ying, Jun Yi and others were waiting outside the hall.

“Swordsman, you are the one Alchemy School sent to give Daluo Heaven Sect a helping hand, aren’t you?” Ling Han looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded, “but what can I do?”

Jian Wushuang was curious about that.

Daluo Heaven Sect, which was strong enough to be a match for Wilderness Sword Sect, had lots of powerhouses including some in the Saint Realm. Is there anything which they could not do that needed his help?

“Here is the thing,” Ling Han explained to him.

“You might know that this time Daluo Heaven Sect and Alchemy School are going to root out Wilderness Sword Sect together. However, not only does it require absolute power, but also a reasonable excuse is needed, after all, it is one of the eight top sects.”

“An excuse?” Jian Wushuang frowned, “Alchemy School and Daluo Heaven Sect could root Wilderness Sword Sect out directly, why would you need an excuse?”

“Haha, you might not know that the eight top sects in Nanyang Continent were a group. If Daluo Heaven Sect and Alchemy School rooted Wilderness Sword Sect out without any excuse, the Daluo Heaven Sect would be expelled by the other seven top sects and cannot rank among the eight top sects.”

“Besides, Wilderness Sword Sect is backed by Holy Emperor Palace, if we attack Wilderness Sword Sect without any reason, Holy Emperor Palace will not leave the matter at that.” Ling Han explained.

“So is that it?” Jian Wushuang understood, “but how do you find an excuse?”
