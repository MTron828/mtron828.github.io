Inside the Temple of Divergence.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The enormous ancient temple, tinted with a mysterious shade, exuded an aura of antiquity. It stood empty, chaotic, and serene.

Upon an ancient throne of gold, a skeletal figure sat perched above, surrounded by dozens of similarly ancient thrones. Behind these thrones loomed a massive, enigmatic statue.

Snickering…

After a strange noise, a glimmer of light flickered in the eye sockets of the golden skeleton.

‘Zhen Wuyang!’

“Hmm, is it really him?”

“I didn’t expect his nose to be so keen, discovering the Temple of Divergence so quickly.”

“Ah, kill him, kill him.”

“Traitor, I want him dead.”

At the same time, all the skeletons on the dozens of ancient thrones awakened, their eyes filled with anger. They roared the name Zhen Wuyang, indicating how much they loathed him.

“We’re in trouble. If we don’t kill him, it’ll be hard to ease the hatred in our hearts, the hatred that prevents us from reaching the pinnacle of the universe.”

“The Great Desolate Wilderness has already given birth to the Heavenly Dao. Although it’s still weak, it can already rival the middle-grade worlds. Plus, the Great Wilderness is traceless. I’ve spent countless ages comprehending the Qishen Temple. I can’t wait to go to the River of Time and Space anymore. By mastering this Dao, I can still elevate it. The position of Universe Master is too distant, and if I can take the second step, I’ll be content.”

The golden skeletons on the other thrones changed their expressions, unwilling to accept it. “Liu Ya, are you really going to do this? If you take control of this Dao now, do you know how difficult it will be for you to progress further in this lifetime?

“Yang Jun, do you really think mastering the universe is that easy? As far as I know, our original universe and several neighboring universes haven’t given birth to Universe Masters, except for what the Temple of Divergence recorded. Have you heard otherwise?

The others pondered in secret but remained dissatisfied.

They had become Emperors during the Ancient Era, all thanks to the existence of the Qishen Temple.

As they looked into the birth of the Great Si Region, they all wore expressions filled with longing.

The Qishen Temple did not belong to the Great Si Region; it had drifted from the void during ancient times and descended upon the Great Si Regiono.

At that time, human cultivators were still very rare. Most of them were ancient divine beasts or unique Special Life Forms.

They had discovered the uniqueness of the Qishen Temple long ago, and from there, they became dazzling existences and became Emperors without much challenge.

Within the Qishen Temple, 18 divine generals were appointed to each of the Emperors in the Ancient Era.

The 18 Emperors mastered the Great Devouring Dao of the Qishen, and as long as they reached the pinnacle of cultivation, they could devour the universe and become the Universe Masters as recorded in the Qishen Temple.

This is why they did not seek to control the Great Si Region or leave it.

The eighteen Emperors all fantasized about quickly becoming the Universe Masters, but they never expected a Zhen Wuyang to emerge.

He was a successor of the True Martial Dao, who climbed to the peak and shattered their own paths, suppressing them in the Great Desolate Wilderness.

Only they knew how powerful the Zhen Wuyang of the Ancient Era was.

Ever since the Grand Secretary Domain was controlled by Zhen Wuyang, he had never used his full strength. No one knew how strong he was now.

“Liu Ya, have you really thought this through? You are giving up the Dao of Qishen,” an Emperor with a glowing glabella bellowed.

Having entered the Qishen Temple from a young age and always revered the Qishen, the appearance of a traitor among them was something that some emperors couldn’t accept.

Liu Ya coldly snorted and turned to the angry Emperor, saying in a cold voice, “Fool, you’ve been copying the statue of the Qishen for so many years, and I haven’t seen you become the Master of the Universe. If you truly become a Universe Master and inherit the position of the Three Great Divine Masters, why would I need to give up the Dao of the Qishen and follow the Dao of the Desolate Wilderness Master?”

Not only did the Qishen Temple establish 18 divine generals, but it also established Three Great Divine Masters and 108 messengers.

The requirements to become a messenger were the lowest; as long as you were a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, you could become a candidate messenger. When you reached the Perfected Nine Revolutions realm, you could become a Qishen messenger, inheriting one of the Emperor’s Dao. As long as you followed the Great Dao, you would undoubtedly become an Emperor.

The requirements to become a divine general were higher; you had to become an Emperor before you could inherit it. Once you inherited it, they would impart to you the Great Devouring Dao, which was a path to becoming the Universe Master.

The masters of the universe were legendary figures in the river of time and space. If it became known across countless universes that the Altar of Wayward Gods held a path that could make cultivators ascend to the masters of the universe, it would surely shake the entire cosmos and spark endless wars.

Furthermore, the Altar of Wayward Gods had established a supreme rule: the three heirs of the God Lords could explore the cosmos. Wherever the secrets of the supreme rule were hidden, whoever comprehended it could inherit the Altar of Wayward Gods and become its ultimate master.

These secrets were known only to them, the divine general. They were aware of the benefits hidden within these secrets and were unwilling to inherit a mere realm and climb step by step.

Not to mention inheriting the Qishen Temple, just mastering the complete Great Devouring Dao to become the Universe Master was enough to drive countless Emperors mad.

Silence filled the great hall for a moment.

“Alright, since Liu Ya has chosen the Dao of the Great Desolate Wilderness Master,” said Yang Jun, turning to look at the others, “don’t forget that Zhen Wuyang has already discovered the Qishen Temple. Soon, powerful beings from other Celestial Realms will also discover it. If no one abandons the Great Devouring Dao, who will control the Great Desolate Wilderness? Without control, how can we deal with those Emperors who have taken the first step?”

Even though they had embarked on the Great Devouring Dao, their strength far exceeded that of ordinary Emperors. However, when facing those Emperors who had taken the first step, they were utterly defenseless.

Even if they weren’t within the world controlled by the other party, they were still no match.

At this moment, Liu Ya took control of the Great Desolate Wilderness, mastering the Heavenly Dao. With such a position, he could use the Qishen

Temple to quickly elevate the Great Desolate Wilderness to a high-grade world.

By becoming top-tier Emperor, he could also protect the Qishen Temple. As long as the Universe Master did not appear, they would be absolutely safe within the Great Desolate Wilderness.

“In that case, Liu Ya, we’ll rely on you from now on. Otherwise, we’ll have to carry the Qishen Temple and escape into the River of Time and Space,” Yang Jun concluded.

The faces of the other Emperors changed rapidly. While they believed in

Qishen and held great reverence for him, in the current situation, preserving the Qishen Temple took precedence.

The Emperors quickly reached a decision, with Liu Ya volunteering to take control of the Altar of Qishen Temple.

Meanwhile, Zhen Wuyang had already reached the depths of the Great Desolate Wilderness at an astonishing speed.

“No!” Zhen Wuyang roared.

He could sense that a Heavenly Dao had emerged within the Great Desolate Wilderness and had already fallen into someone’s control.

“That old b*stard! If I can’t have the Qishen Temple, neither can you!’

He produced an ancient-looking token in his hand and then activated its power, transmitting a message throughout the entire universe..
