“Ask for directions?”

The two unicorn men with maroon skin exchanged a look and one of them immediately laughed, “It’s easy if you want to ask for directions. If you can defeat the two of us, my brother and I will tell you everything we know no matter what you ask.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He was only asking for directions, but he had to first defeat the two of them?

“Jian Wushuang, there are many special tribes in Ancient God Land and most of the special tribes are extremely valiant. No matter what happens, they speak with their fists. The two of them are top Universe Gods too. They saw that they were on the same level as you are, so they wanted to fight a battle with you,” King of Venomous Worms explained.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang understood and he said with a smile, “If so, please go first.”

“My brother and I, you pick one,” the unicorn man who was the elder brother said.

“There’s no need for trouble. The two of you can fight against me at the same time,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“So arrogant. Brother, as he has already said so, let us team up and teach him a lesson then.”

“Alright.”

The two unicorn men with maroon skin reached a mutual agreement and immediately moved together.

Just as they moved, hong! Hong!

The earth instantly shattered. The two of them were originally two meters tall but that instant, they increased their height to a dozen meters tall.

Just like two mountains, they pounded at Jian Wushuang straightaway.

“Interesting.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and moved. He appeared before a small mountain and punched casually with one first.

The older unicorn man was burning with rage and he clenched his fist and pounded fiercely.

Bang!

The size of two fists that weren’t proportionate collided. After he let out a groan, the unicorn man with a mountain-like body suddenly rolled out.

Jian Wushuang moved again but appeared above the head of another unicorn man. He pointed with his index finger and pressed on his head.

“Lie down.”

Hong!

The ground under the unicorn man suddenly sunk and his body was pressed down by Jian Wushuang entirely. He couldn’t move an inch.

After a short duration, the battle ended.

“The two of you, do you admit defeat?” Jian Wushuang looked at the two people before him.

The two people resumed their original look of two meters tall. The two of them looked at Jian Wushuang in astonishment.

“Your strength is that strong?” The older unicorn man exclaimed, “My brother and I are members of?Fire Demon Tribe. We, Fire Demon Tribe, are good at strength and we are at the same level as you are. But when we met force with force, we were cornered by you?”

“In Ancient God Sanctuary, to be able to win against Fire Demon Tribe of the same realm, should only be Ancient God and those Ancient God with extremely pure bloodline!”

“I am really an Ancient God,” Jian Wushuang admitted, “So can you answer my questions now?”

“Of course, Mister. Go ahead and ask whatever questions you want,” the older unicorn man said.

In Ancient God Sanctuary, many tribes spoke with power.

Jian Wushuang’s power was much stronger than theirs. They naturally admitted their defeat.

“I’d like to know where in the region of Ancient God Sanctuary is this and where is the nearest city?” Jian Wushuang asked.

In a short while, Jian Wushuang got the answer that he wanted.

The two Fire Demon tribesmen left right after as well.

“Jian Wushuang, let’s go to the nearest city, Gu King City,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Mm,”

Jian Wushuang nodded and immediately went in the direction that the two Fire Demon Tribe had given to go to the nearest Gu King City.

Gu King City, one of the nine Ancient God cities and most of the Ancient Gods in the city shared the surname Gu.

Among the Ancient God tribe, their surname was the symbol of their identity. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

There were many surnames among Ancient Gods but there weren’t many royal surnames that existed among the Royal Ancient Gods.

The surname Gu was one of the surnames of Royal Ancient Gods.

Gu King City was huge and crowded with experts. There were many experts from those special tribes but there were a lot more of Ancient Gods.

In Gu King City, there were more than ten million Ancient Gods that resided there. The Ancient Gods with the surname Gu took up at least fifty percent.

Jian Wushuang came to Gu King City.

On the streets of Gu King City, Jian Wushuang could see many people shuttling to and fro. Some of the figures had a normal human appearance, some were Ancient God bodies a few meters tall, and there were also various other tribes. By the side of the streets, he saw lofty buildings. The buildings were huge. The Ancient Gods were tall and brawny after all.

“Jian Wushuang, as you came to Ancient God tribe. Give yourself an Ancient God name. Otherwise, your name as Jian Wushuang will be strange and you might attract attention inevitably,” King of Venomous Worms reminded.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded. He thought and he had an idea, “The Ancient Gods in Gu King City mostly have the surname Gu. So, I shall use Gu as my surname. I’ll just name myself Gu Jian. Simple.”

“As long as it sounds like an Ancient God’s name, it will do,” King of Venomous Worms didn’t care.

“Oh yeah, I remember back when I met Ancient God tribes back in Firmament Territory in Green Fire World, most of them has the surname Gu as well. Their leader, King Gu Tong, was a seven-star Royal Ancient God. I wonder if they are related to Gu King City,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

“As they are Ancient Gods with the surname Gu, they are definitely related to Gu King City,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“If so, that’d be interesting. I wonder if I will run into those Ancient Gods in Gu King city that I met back then in Firmament Territory,” Jian Wushuang was looking forward to it.

“Don’t bother with that just yet. First, go and register for training examination of Ancient God Palace that happens every century,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Training examination of Ancient God Palace? What’s that?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“Ancient God Palace is a place specifically for cultivating Ancient God secret skills and massacre unique skills. There’s Nine Great King Cities and every city has an Ancient God Palace and they teach five-star and six-star Ancient Gods’ secret skill and unique skill in Ancient God Palace. The lowest requirement to enter Ancient God Palace is five-star Ancient God that passed three Ancient God’s test. You happen to fulfill the criteria,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“In other words, if I want to cultivate Ancient God secret skills and unique skills that are suitable for my current level, I have to enter Ancient God Palace?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes. Besides Ancient God Palace, there is almost no hope to get any secret skill for a five-star Ancient God or above within Ancient God Sanctuary. Just like some Ancient God tribe in Ancient God Sanctuary, they have some secret skills and unique skills for Ancient Gods internally but the levels are too low.

“Understood.”

Jian Wushuang understood and he walked into the Ancient God Palace of Gu King City.
