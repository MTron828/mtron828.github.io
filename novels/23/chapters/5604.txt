Chapter 5603 ¬†The Tenacity of Life

The purest Death and the purest Life.

This time, Jian Wushuang grew stronger as he fought, fueled by the fear of death and the desire for life.

The power of Death was different.

"Have you heard that it's better to be alive than to die a good death?" Jian Wushuang attacked with words even in his leisure.

Though Death is frightening and brings fear, the resilience of the power of Life cannot be fully realized until facing death.

Now, facing death head-on, the power of Life erupted completely.

"Get out of here!" Jian

Wushuang smashed the force of Death with a punch, then swiftly appeared behind the opponent. Another knee strike shattered the condensed silhouette of the Death power completely.

With a satisfied breath, Jian Wushuang turned around and found that the black aura had instantly transformed into his own likeness.

"Everyone eventually dies, and some people need a little help!"

This was his retort.

Jian Wushuang raised an eyebrow and sneered, "I don't need your help because my helper has already arrived!"

Outside.

The powerful aura of Zhen Ling suddenly descended.

"Mie Sheng, you've crossed the line!"

An invisible giant hand directly reached through Jian Wushuang, pulling the power of Death out of his body.

Inside the Origin Source Sea, Jian Wushuang breathed a sigh of relief. As the power of Death was pulled away, a small black snake fell into the sea, unnoticed.

Jian Wushuang's avatar directly reciprocated, and the injuries on his body completely healed. ùëÖ√™·∫°d new chaptùíÜrs on no/v/e/lùíÉin(.)com

However, the Candle Dragon Inner Armor was gone, reduced to some fragments. It was uncertain whether it could be repaired.

Having just unleashed the Starry Sky Chronicles, he was now at his weakest. Although he had no injuries, he couldn't mobilize the power of the Starry Sky, unable to reach his strongest state. Currently, he could only muster the combat power of a tier 5 Emperor.

Without the power of the Starry Sky, this might be his limit. He could only rely on the divine body to contend with a tier 6 Emperor.

Nie Yuan truly gave him a valuable treasure.

Zhen Ling glanced at Jian Wushuang and completely shattered the power of Death in his hand.

"Take this person and leave quickly!" Zhen Ling had never been this angry.

Due to Mie Sheng, the disturbance within the Qishen Temple had become severe.

Moreover, the power within Jian Wushuang's body was contrary to Mie Sheng's, perhaps part of a deliberate plan.

Mie Sheng's true form had not completely descended; instead, the power of Death power left within Broly's body was causing mischief.

Whoosh!

A dark figure emerged from Broly's Origin Source‚Äîit was Mie Sheng.

"You've discovered all of this!" Mie Sheng revealed a hint of a smile, then waved his hand, covering Broly with a black halo.

Broly's divine body and flesh recombined, but he had now fallen into a deep slumber.

Zhen Ling stood in front of Jian Wushuang, silently observing without uttering a word.

However, Jian Wushuang felt somewhat unwilling and spoke, "My Lord, we can't let them go!"

Instead, it would be better to eliminate Broly and the pseudo-body of Mie Sheng. Letting them go like this would be a pity.

"Little guy, Broly alone scared you off!" Mie Sheng cast an unfriendly glance.

The transformation of Broly indeed startled Jian Wushuang. Jiang Shang was already formidable enough; they couldn't afford to let another major enemy escape.

Zhen Ling shook his head and said, "Before I change my mind, leave quickly!"

It wasn't that Zhen Ling was merciful, but he couldn't act first.

A strong will deep within him suppressed him‚Äîthe fragment of memory, a massive shard from the original Qishen.

Without integrating that shard, it could already interfere with his consciousness. If it were to merge, the Qishen Temple might already be under Mie Sheng's control.

Mie Sheng also saw the conflict within Zhen Ling and reminded, "You are the True Spirit of Qishen Temple, and more importantly, a part of Qishen. Don't forget that!"

This was a flaw that emerged in his and Qishen's initial planning.

Unexpectedly, with the appearance of Zhen Ling, an independent consciousness emerged.

Otherwise, the plan would have been even smoother than it is now.

It was precisely because of this independent consciousness that Zhen Ling came to genuinely detest the path of devouring and abhor Jian Wushuang.

With Mie Sheng carrying Broly, they swiftly left through the opened passage by Zhen Ling.

The passage eventually closed up again.

Mie Sheng, now outside the Qishen Temple, appeared at the pinnacle of a universe.

Beneath his feet lay a circular universe, and standing on a colossal celestial body, Mie Sheng's avatar cursed in anger.

Because this place was not the Original Universe, not even within the same spacetime continuum as the Qishen Temple.

Just as they appeared, a group of strange-armored foreign warriors approached in their direction.

This spacetime was far more formidable than the one where the Original Universe existed, even several times more powerful than the Moro Spacetime in the past.

"Wait, fellow Daoist!" Mie Sheng's avatar and his follower instantly elevated their strength to the Tribulation realm, intending to have a proper conversation with this group of strong individuals.

The leader, a poisonous scorpion woman in purple armor, swayed her tail. She belonged to the Scorpion Clan.

Upon realizing Mie Sheng's Tribulation realm cultivation, there was no trace of fear; instead, there was a hint of amusement.

"At the Tribulation realm, daring to intrude into my Scorpion Clan's Nest Universe. You have quite the audacity!"

These patrolling powerhouses were all Emperors.

However, this didn't mean there were no Tribulation realm powerhouses presiding in this place.

When Mie Sheng was just discovered, a formidable figure, surpassing the Five Tribulation realm, began to descend.

A colossal illusion shrouded the crowd.

"Subordinates pay respects to the General!"

...

After seeing off Mie Sheng, Zhen Ling's expression relaxed a bit.

The recent disturbance wasn't solely due to the interference of the memory fragments in his body; instead, it was the backlash brought by him opening a passage to other dimensions.

This was also an experiment, a chance to test his skills against both Broly and Mie Sheng.

Maintaining the connection for the two individuals shouldn't pose any problem.

However, it wasn't enough.

Sending away Qishen Temple together with them was utterly impossible. Yet, he could send away a few trustworthy Inheritors from within the Qishen Temple. That was still achievable.

For example, the current Jian Wushuang.

"Jian Wushuang, have you ever thought about leaving this place?"

Jian Wushuang was startled by Zhen Ling's sudden words, fearing that Zhen Ling no longer wanted him. In haste, he bowed, expressing his loyalty.

"Enough, I didn't mean that. You've seen that Mie Sheng came for you, and Qishen Temple is no longer important," Zhen Ling revealed the truth.

Jian Wushuang could sense it; after all, it was the Great Dao of Reincarnation, a Dao comparable to the dimension of time and space.

If Mie Sheng succeeded, Qishen Temple would indeed lose its significance.

At that time, no one knew what level of power Mie Sheng would attain.

After taking a breath, Jian Wushuang respectfully said, "It's entirely up to you, My Lord!"

"After you have completed the Dao Merge, I will grant you an opportunity, and then you will leave Qishen Temple for a while," Zhen Ling said slowly with hands behind his back.

Currently, Jian Wushuang's strength, though having the ability to protect himself in other dimensions, was still too weak.

At least, he needed to leave after successfully merging with the Dao.
