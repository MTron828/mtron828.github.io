Chapter 2461: Fengtian Scroll

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang finally had peace in Saint’s Tomb as everyone tried to stay out of his way. He also appeared uninterested in the fights for position tokens which were going on intensely.

Time was ticking away, the fight for position tokens finally came to an end.

“Little Brother!”

“Junior Brother Wushuang!”

Zhuo Bing, Ling Dan, Zhong Yi, Su Tong, the other disciples of Ancient Star Temple, and Narcissus Island returned from the outer area, appearing before Jian Wushuang.

“Little Brother, I heard that you single-handedly wiped out nearly 50 First-Class Divine Demons. Even Huan Chen, Long Zishan, Huo Yang, and Yu Aoqing who are part of the Twelve Minor Kings were forced to crush their Safety Tokens and leave Saint’s Tomb. Did you hurt yourself?” Zhuo Bing kept checking Jian Wushuang out repeatedly but did not see any discomfort in Jian Wushuang.

Although they stayed out of the battle in the outer area, they maintained communication with the outside world.

Therefore, they knew about Jian Wushuang’s killings in the inner area.

“It’s okay. I’m good.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly. He was a killer demon in front of outsiders, but he played the role of a younger brother in front of his Elder Sister.

“Junior Brother Wushuang.” Zhong Yi, Su Tong, and others looked at Jian Wushuang with incomparable complex expressions on their faces.

All of them had received a message from Elder Linghe and learned the decision Narcissus Island made. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Jian Wushuang was no longer a disciple of Narcissus Island, hence he was no longer their junior brother.

“Senior Brother Zhong Yi and Senior Sister Su Tong, although I’m no longer a disciple of Narcissus Island, we have somehow fought side by side so you are still my seniors.” Jian Wushuang smiled politely.

Hearing that, Zhong Yi and Su Tong felt relaxed.

They could not violate decisions made by the higher-ups of Narcissus Island, but that decision did not hinder their friendship with Jian Wushuang.

“That’s right.”

Jian Wushuang suddenly flipped his hand and a white token immediately appeared in his palm.

That white token was a position token for viewing the Fengtian Scroll and being enlightened in the process.

“Junior Brother Wushuang, this is?” Su Tong and Ling Dan looked over immediately.

Zhuo Bing and Zhong Yi each had a token. Both Su Tong and Ling Dan who still had none were keen to get one.

“I got this token from that Long Zishan,” replied Jian Wushuang with a smile.

Position tokens were exclusively available only in Saint’s Tomb. It would remain in the tomb even when Long Zishan left.

That token fell into Jian Wushuang’s hands when he defeated Long Zishan.

“I have a token in my hand. Senior Brother Ling Dan and Senior Sister Su Tong, both of you can discuss whom to take this.” Jian Wushuang threw the token in his hand and could care less about what happened next.

Both Ling Dan and Su Tong started their discussion.

They soon came to a consensus.

The position token was given to Ling Dan. In exchange, Ling Dan owed Su Tong a favor in which Su Tong could ask Ling Dan to do something for her in the future.

Ling Dan wanted to owe Jian Wushuang a favor. Unfortunately, Ling Dan knew that Jian Wushuang would not need anything from him.

“It’s almost time. Let’s get ready to go,” announced Jian Wushuang.

Zhuo Bing, Ling Dan, and Zhong Yi, who each held a position token nodded.

The four of them found a place and sat down before beginning to adjust their state of mind.

An hour 1passed in a flash.

Rumbling...

The Heavens above abruptly roared and there was a change in Heaven and Earth.

A huge picture scroll appeared in the uppermost void.

“It’s here.”

Jian Wushuang and those few people were overwhelmed in excitement.

Fengtian Scroll had always appeared in the tomb’s most central void so that everyone could see it.

However, only those who had position tokens could get enlightenment from the Fengtian Scroll.

As for those who did not have a token, they would not be able to get anything out from their Fengtian Scroll observation.

“The three of you have a good time in the enlightenment process. I’ll protect all of you from your surroundings and won’t let anyone disturb you.” Su Tong along with the disciples from Ancient Star Temple and Narcissus Island stayed nearby to protect Jian Wushuang and the others.

Truthfully, they did not need to be protected.

That was the rule of Saint’s Tomb. Disciples could freely contest for the position tokens, but once the Fengtian Scroll was out, no one could disturb the disciples who had position tokens when they were in the process of observing the Fengtian Scroll. Otherwise, Crimson Stone Saint will immediately kill the troublemaker.

The Saint’s Tomb was controlled by Crimson Stone Saint and no one dared to break the rules set by an Undying Saint, even if the Saint had passed away.

Jian Wushuang held the white token in his hand and closed his eyes as his consciousness assimilated with the white token.

Under the white token’s guidance, Jian Wushuang’s consciousness went into the Fengtian Scroll which was spread open in the void above.

The huge Fengtian Scroll had light spots all over it. Those light spots were moving around slowly on the scroll, like very dazzling stars.

The stars were connected, forming a magnificent picture scroll.

“So, this is the Fengtian Scroll?”

“It’s called Fengtian. I wonder what’s in this picture scroll?”

With a hint of curiosity, Jian Wushuang began to examine it carefully.

After a short momentary observation, Jian Wushuang found the mystery in Fengtian Scroll.

“Is this...the Cosmic Mysteries?” Jian Wushuang was electrified.

He could sense a special peerless power in the Fengtian Scroll. This power was neither law nor originated from Heaven and Earth but the mysterious Cosmic Mysteries.

It was not something that can be found and experienced normally, not because it was magnificent or over imposing. On the contrary, it was not as profound as the laws of Heaven and Earth.

Nonetheless, its presence was infinitesimal, just like the pores on a human’s body. Although the pores were inconspicuous, they were indispensable.

That was the mysterious power of Heaven and Earth’s vast expanse. It was one of the main elements that constituted Heaven and Earth but was not studied because of it being weak and subtle.

What Jian Wushuang sensed in the Fengtian Scroll was the mysterious powers of the vast Heaven and Earth.

As Jian Wushuang was achieving enlightenment, he subconsciously began to picture some sword techniques in his mind.

The mysterious power evolved accordingly.

Jian Wushuang was thrilled in just a brief moment.

“So, that’s how it is?”

Jian Wushuang finally understood the functions of Fengtian Scroll. It was through its mysterious power that one derived various things between Heaven and Earth.

For example, it was used to develop sword techniques, derive laws, secret techniques, etc. It worked in many areas and the effect was many times faster than that of self-deduction!
