Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Ye Se is defeated!”

“Chen Feng is definitely the number one among the young disciples in the Wilderness Sword Sect. His strength is really powerful.”

“Before, I had been thinking that Ye Se would win. However the result is...What a disappointment Ye Se is!”

“I don’t know what’s wrong. But I have the feeling that Ye Se didn’t seem to have tried his utmost.”

At the exchange meeting, the experts from different Sects were casually talking about the fight between Ye Se and Chen Feng a while ago. But no matter how they analyzed, the fight was over, and Ye Se had lost.

The disciples in the Wilderness Sword Sect were all pleasantly surprised. The heavily built, middle-aged man who seemed the leader even laughed out brightly. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Who else present wants to step up and take the challenge?” Standing at the center of the Martial Arts Practice Field, Chen Feng looked across, with a slight sneer flashing across his eyes.

The disciples who were standing around the Martial Arts Practice Field looked at each other in dismay, with their heads secretly shaking.

Even Ye Se was defeated by Chen Feng. How would the disciples in these Sects have the courage to fight with Chen Feng?

However at this moment, a black figure stood up from the disciples of the Daluo Heaven Sect. He then slowly walked towards the center of the Martial Arts Practice Field.

Suddenly, a large number of eyes moved upon the black figure from across the Martial Arts Practice Field.

Everybody was staring at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang ignored their eyes, and walked to the center on the Martial Arts Practice Field. Looking at Chen Feng who was in front of him, a clear and cold voice suddenly spewed out of his mouth, “I am Swordsman from the Daluo Heaven Sect. Please enlighten me!”

The Martial Arts Practice Field was in tumult at once.

“Swordsman?”

“Who is Swordsman? I have never heard of you?”

“Daluo Heaven Sect? Is there a disciple named Swordsman in the Daluo Heaven Sect?”

The genius disciples of the old sects all looked odd. Being the two strongest Sects in the whole Northern Region, the Wilderness Sword Sect and the Daluo Heaven Sect were naturally very attractive. So people knew how many disciples these two Sects had and who they were.

However, they had never heard that there was a genius disciple called Swordsman in the Daluo Heaven Sect.

“Where are you from? I have never heard of you, and you want to fight with me? Get out of here,” Chen Feng snarled. He then lifted his hand and slashed his sword directly towards Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang shifted his body, and warded off this sword easily. Finally the sword light landed on the Martial Arts Practice Field, and suddenly there came to a huge sword scar on the ground; the sword scar was more than a half meter wide.

Although Jian Wushuang was warding off the sword. However, at the same time while he was warding off, he was activating his Spiritual Power. By then, his Spiritual Power broke out, and then his Cultivation was naturally revealed in public.

Noticing the Spiritual Power and breath spread out from Jian Wushuang, the experts on the whole Martial Arts Practice Field were stunned. Followed by an outburst of laughter!

“Haha, is this person kidding us?”

“What did I see? An Initial Yang Void Realm?”

“Where is the idiot from? How dare an Initial Yang Void Realm challenge Chen Feng?”

“Does the Daluo Heaven Sect have no experts now? Why they send a young man who just achieved the Initial Yang Void Realm to challenge?”

Numerous eyes around the Practice Field were fixed on Jian Wushuang with contempt and arrogance.

The disciples from the Daluo Heaven Sect who were standing aside also darkened their faces.

“Elder Ling Han, what’s going on?” a disciple from the Daluo Heaven Sect asked.

It was known that among the disciples from the Daluo Heaven Sect who were at the meeting, the weakest one was in the Exceptional Yang Void Realm level. No matter who stepped on the Practice Field, he might fail in defeating Chen Feng, but at least he wouldn’t cause laughter from the different Sects.

A disciple with Initial Yang Void Realm level from the Daluo Heaven Sect, and he?attempted to challenge Chen Feng who was at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm level. If this got out, the Daluo Heaven Sect would be a joke.

“Shut up, just watch. Don’t ask too much,” Lin Han snarled, without explaining too much.

Standing on the Martial Arts Practice Field, Chen Feng also noticed Jian Wushuang’s Cultivation of Spiritual Power. He was extremely stunned, but followed by his laughter, “Haha, are the experts in the Daluo Heaven Sect all thoughtless people like you?”

Hearing this, the genius disciples from the Daluo Heaven Sect all felt shame. They even wanted to find a rock and hide themselves under.

However, Jian Wushuang’s face was extremely cold.

“No need to talk nonsense. Just display your moves and show me your full strength. Otherwise...You will have no chance,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“I won’t have a chance? It’s you who won’t have a chance.” Chen Feng’s face was cold. “Hum, what an ignorant idiot. Since you are looking for a death, then I will help you out.”

No sooner had he uttered this, that Chen Feng suddenly moved his body.

With a gliding move, Chen Feng appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. At the same time, he fiercely stabbed his Long Sword, and an overpowering Wind Thunder Essence Realm suddenly broke out. The sword essence broke through the Void, and caused a burst of crackling sounds on the Void.

This sword was full of monstrous power. Chen Feng had apparently activated his full strength.

“How come Chen Feng dealt with an Initial Yang Void Realm with his full power?”

“Does he want to...?”

“He didn’t spare his strength. Is he trying to kill that young man?”

“Hum, even if that fellow is killed, so what? He is just Initial Yang Void Realm, and he dares to challenge Chen Feng, which was very arrogant. It’s reasonable if he gets killed by Chen Feng. And the Daluo Heaven Sect can’t say anything afterwards, since their disciple is over-confident.”

Everybody was looking at them.

“It’s unbelievable that Chen Feng wants to kill me!” Jian Wushuang sneered. “Well, it saved me a lot of trouble.”

A second later, Jian Wushuang moved his body.

Chen Feng’s eyes turned cold. He almost slashed his sword out with his utmost, which was even difficult for an expert at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm to block. Chen Feng indeed wanted to kill Jian Wushuang. He didn’t worry about the Daluo Heaven Sect giving him trouble, since Jian Wushuang was too over-confident.”

His sword had reached near Jian Wushuang, and was about to stab into Jian Wushuang’s body.

However at this moment, Jian Wushuang suddenly looked up, and gave Chen Feng a cold glance. The glance freaked Chen Feng out, and Chen Feng felt an unprecedented sense of crisis.

Instantly... Jian Wushuang disappeared from Chen Feng’s view. Jian Wushuang just disappeared in front of Chen Feng’s eyes.

“What?” This caught Chen Feng by surprise. He had not reacted before he noticed a strong wind blowing from the side. Chen Feng struggled to turn around, and happened to see a cold sword light gliding to him and it glanced off his neck.

Chi!

There came the sound of a Sword Edge stabbing into the body. Followed by a huge head flying off.

Chen Feng remained with his eyes widened. He felt a spell of dizziness, and with his fading vision, he saw a black figure in front of him.

“What is that?”

Chen Feng subconsciously thought. But soon after, he saw it clearly that the black figure was his body!

“I...” Chen Feng tried to say something. However he could only utter a word. A second later, his head just fell on the ground. It rolled on the ground for a few circles, and then no more movements were heard.
