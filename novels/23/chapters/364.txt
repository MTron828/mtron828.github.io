Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“I’ve comprehended Origin of All Beasts, and I excel at close combat. Yet, the dozen strokes I landed on him did not hurt him at all. On the other?hand, I was injured by a single attack from him.”

“His body is too strong!”

First Holy Master stared at Jian Wushuang with a cold look.

He had to admit that Jian Wushuang had a powerful body.

Jian Wushuang’s body could protect him from a dozen face-to-face attacks.

“First Holy Master, you live up to your?name, ranking number one. You’re much stronger than the other three Holy Masters,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile, while he watched First Holy Master, who was standing opposite him, being surrounded by the other three masters.

“However, if your strength is just this, you cannot protect Holy Emperor Palace.”

The moment he finished his words, a surge of killing intent rose from him. Then, a vast Blood River flowed out at an amazing speed.

Asura Secret Skill, Road to the Underworld!

The turbulent river soon covered an area over a radius of 1,000 meters, with the four Holy Masters stuck inside.

“Hum?”

The four Holy Masters frowned as they felt the overwhelming power of the Blood River.

“Be careful. This Blood River is like Domain, so it can greatly suppress us,” Second Holy Master said seriously.

He had experienced the power of Road to the Underworld, so he knew.

While Road to the Underworld was pervading the whole area, Slaughter Domain started sweeping out as well.

Even a faint flow of Sword Essence began to emanate from Jian Wushuang.

The layer of Sword Essence was like invisible waves, full of terrifying power. It was the first-grade sword technique, ”?Multifold Realm?“, which Jian Wushuang had practiced inside Sword Tower.

As a first-grade sword technique, it was enigmatic. Jian Wushuang had just mastered the first move, the First Realm.

The power of the First Realm was far superior to Sword Sea.

The combination of three techniques, Road to the Underworld, First Realm, and Slaughter Domain.

“Suppress!” Jian Wushunag shouted in a low voice.

Shua... The Blood River tumbled, with waves violently lashing the surroundings. Its great power suppressed the four Holy Masters, causing them to stop for a while. Their expressions changed.

“How powerful!” First Holy Master looked solemn. “We can not move freely in the Blood River. Even I can only display 70 percent of my strength.”

First Holy Master, who was the most powerful among them, had 30 percent of his battle strength suppressed, while the other three Holy Masters had half of their strength suppressed.

“How is this possible?” Second Holy Master widened their eyes in shock and said, “Last time I met him, his Blood River Realm barely suppressed 10 percent of my strength, but now... it’s half of my strength!

“Even though he has reached the Saint Realm, the power of his Blood River should not have improved to such an extent.”

He did not know that Blood River’s power improved greatly because of First Realm.

Regarding the power of the three domains in the previous combination, Road to the Underworld ranked first, Slaughter Domain ranked second, and Sword Sea ranked third.

As for the current power of three domains he was using, Road to the Underworld was still first, but First Realm was stronger than Slaughter Domain.

While the four Holy Masters felt awful under the influence of Blood River, Jian Wushuang, and his two Sword Soul Phantoms, exuded a powerful battle intent.

Soon after, Jian Wushuang began to move.

Bang! His first step caused the air to tremble, and a flow of pressure swept out. The Triple-kill Sword, which was filled with a great amount of Sword Essence, appeared in his hand again.

An overwhelming Spiritual Power gathered in his hand and his body’s strength reached its peak.

Then Jian Wushuang violently slashed at First Holy Master.

The move he performed came from a first-grade sword technique,?“Dragon-killing Sword Technique”?.

The stroke was obviously powerful.

The sword light lashed out, humming as it moved through the air. First Holy Master was shocked by it. He immediately clenched his fists as his huge Demonic Ape Phantom grew immensely, then it let out a snarl and launched two punches.

At the same time, the other three Holy Masters also attacked.

Second Holy Master waved his heavy blood-red hammer, scarlet energy gushing out, smashing downward as if a towering huge mountain was falling.

Third Holy Master wore a cold look as black light gathered in her hands. She also launched an attack using her black dagger that was covered in venom.

Fourth Holy Master’s eyes widened like copper bells. He waved his huge saber and hacked forward with enough power that he could easily split a mountain.

The four Holy Masters attacked with their most powerful moves. Even though there were being suppressed by Blood River, they still managed to release overwhelming power. In an instant, their four strikes collided with the boy’s.

It was a head-on confrontation!

He was fighting with four experts of the Saint Realm!

As a result... The sword light changed into a raging giant dragon before the collision.

The giant dragon roared with an overwhelming momentum and smashed against the four attacks. Then it transformed into a gust of wind and blew the four Holy Masters back.

Jian Wushuang was able to defeat the four Holy Masters by himself.

When the four Holy Masters retreated, Jian Wushuang rushed forward at lightning speed,?appearing in front of his opponents.

“Not good!” Fourth Holy Master looked at the boy in terror. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Jian Wushuang grinned and began to swing the Triple-kill Sword.
