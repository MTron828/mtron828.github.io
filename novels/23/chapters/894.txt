Chapter 895: Island?

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

On a giant island, completely covered by a thick fog, located at the farthest end of the Stellar Fog Sea.

Jian Wushuang came to this island with Lord Spirit Sound.

After landing on the ground, Jian Wushuang took a look at his surroundings.

However, other than the thick fog, the only things within view was scattered gravel. He was surprised to find out that all the stones and even the ground were a weird scarlet color.

“The ground…”

Jian Wushuang stamped on the scarlet ground, finding that it was very hard and smooth. He deliberately stamped harder, but the ground remained unaffected by his strength.

“Follow me.”

Lord Spirit Sound led Jian Wushuang deeper into the island.

Jian Wushuang followed closely while looking inspecting his surroundings. He could tell that there was something unusual about this island.

First of all, it was too quiet. There was no sound at all on such a huge island.

After a short time, Jian Wushuang arrived in front of the only mountain on this island.

This giant mountain was the same scarlet color, but it had a strange shape.

“Here it is,” Lord Spirit Sound said. He stopped and looked up towards the weird mountain.

Jian Wushuang looked at the mountain too. It appeared lifeless and had no sound.

“Gu King, I’ve brought the little guy I told you about last time,” Lord Spirit Sound said. His voice echoed across the island.

The huge island remained quiet for a long time. Then, a deep old voice rang out, as loud as thunder.

“Is that him?”

The sound revealed no emotions at all and came from all directions. Jian Wushuang looked around immediately, but he couldn’t tell where exactly the sound came from.

“Is it from the ground?” Jian Wushuang looked at the scarlet ground.

“A Divine Realm expert?” The deep old voice echoed across the island again.

“Humph!”

“How could a Divine Realm expert deserve what Master left?”

The deep old voice became angry. Immediately, Jian Wushang felt an incredible oppression coming from everywhere. It felt like it could crush his bones and his face turned red.

Seeing this, Lord Spirit Sound flicked his sleeve and the oppression surrounding Jian Wushuang immediately disappeared.

Lord Spirit Sound said, “Gu King, although this little guy is only a Divine Realm expert, he’s an Inverse Cultivator. He just arrived at Star Island about 200 years ago and has already passed the three Eternal Realm tests. It’s rare to have such ability.”

“In addition, the stuff your master left has little to do with a person’s realm, right?”

“You are right, but a Divine Realm expert is still too weak. It’s impossible for him to get what Master left. Come again once he reaches Dao Master.”

“How do you know he’s unable to get it without even letting him try?” Lord Spirit Sound sneered.

After a short silence, the deep old voice spoke again, “Little guy, what’s your name?”

“Blood Mountain, Sir,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“My Master did leave a valuable treasure here, but it’s not easy to acquire. I don’t believe there’s any chance for a Divine Realm expert to succeed. If you still insist on trying, although it won’t kill you, it may cause serious injuries that will need a very long time to recover from.”

The deep old voice stopped for a while, then continued, “Now, let me ask you again. Do you want to try?”

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang nodded without a second thought.

It was such a big opportunity. Who knew if there would be another chance if he missed this one.

Not to mention serious injuries, even if he might die, he would still want to give it a try.

“Ok, as you wish.” The entire island became silent again after these words.

“Are we starting now?” Lord Spirit Sound looked at the scarlet mountain, smiled, then said, “Blood Mountain, pay close attention to what happens next.”

Jian Wushuang was stunned but nodded subconsciously.

Boom Boom Pow… At this moment, the entire island started to shake madly.

“What’s going on?” Jian Wushuang frowned, then looked at Lord Spirit Sound and realized that she was already floating. She obviously knew the island would begin shaking.

Jian Wushuang began to float as well while looking around in confusion.

Suddenly, with a loud buzzing, the peak of the giant scarlet mountain began to split, revealing two weird ‘suns’ that were both a dark gold color.

“This, this is…”

With both eyes opened widely, Jian Wushuang stared at the two ‘suns’ while feeling as if his head was about to explode. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Suns?

What Suns?

They were obviously two giant dark gold eyes.

Yes, they were two eyes, and their size was comparable to two small mountains.

Each eye was several times bigger than the Gold-armored Ancient God that Jian Wushuang had turned into.

While still at the peak of the mountain, the eyes suddenly opened and focused directly on Jian Wushuang.

Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang realized that the scarlet ground he was previously standing on, was wriggling madly.

It was wriggling!

The entire island was wriggling. Next, many huge scarlet tentacles emerged from the wriggling ground.

Jian Wushuang and Lord Spirit Sound were in the sky above the island, watching as this all took place.

He could clearly see that the entire giant island beneath him had become ‘alive’. Numerous tentacles were reaching out from every part of the island as the ground slowly split open, revealing its true form.

Jian Wushuang was stunned upon seeing the island’s true form.

Island?

This was not an island.

It was a giant worm that was had been curled up.

Yes, the scarlet island he saw before was just the outer shell of this giant worm.
