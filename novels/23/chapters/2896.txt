Chapter 2897: Bone Emperor Invites You

——

Jian Wushuang stood quietly in the hall, waiting for the response of the people in front of him.

After a brief discussion, the experts of Heavenly Curve Palace came to a unanimous decision.

“Lord Jian Yi, we are willing to follow you. From now on, you will be the most respected person in the Heavenly Curve World,” Divine Master Blood Lamp said solemnly.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang smiled with satisfaction, but he was not surprised.

He had long heard that the former Realm Master of Heavenly Curve World was supreme and overbearing in the Heavenly Curve World, whether to outsiders or his subordinates. Therefore, not many people in the Heavenly Curve World were truly loyal to him, the Black Blood Emperor he killed was one of them, but Blood Lamp Divine Master was not absolutely loyal to the Realm Master of Heavenly Curve World.

Now that Realm Master Tian Qu was dead, it was the wisest choice for Blood Lamp Divine Master and the others to submit to him.

After subduing Blood Lamp Divine Master and the others, Jian Wushuang would begin to pacify the turmoil in the Heavenly Curve World.

The Heavenly Curve World was in chaos because it lacked the Immortal Saint’s battle strength.

But now that Jian Wushuang had arrived, it was easy for him to pacify the turmoil.

He took out the corpse puppet army and led it by Divine Master Blood Lamp to wipe out the forces.

Even if there were a stubborn resistance, he would come out personally.

In front of his absolute strength, the experts of the Heavenly Curve World had no room to struggle. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In less than a month, the turmoil in the Heavenly Curve World was completely calmed down. The forces bowed their heads and submitted to him.

Jian Wushuang had officially taken over the fallen Realm Master and become the new ruler of the Heavenly Curve World.

Since then, all the preparations had been completed. All that was left was for the Sword Alliance to transfer over.

…

In a desolate void in the Heavenly Curve World.

Buzz!

A hidden space passage suddenly lit up. A moment later, a black-robed figure appeared in the void like a ghost.

“Has he arrived at the Heavenly Curve World?”

The ghost figure raised his head, revealing a pair of demonic eyes.

“That Jian Yi is really troublesome. Previously, he killed the Heavenly Curve World Lord and Elder Su in the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City. After that, he returned to the Pill Sun Sacred World. When I rushed to the Pill Sun Sacred World, he went to the Heavenly Void Temple. He had already gone to the Dragon God World by the time I arrived to look for the Old Dragon God. When I received the news and went to the Dragon God World again, this sword one actually came to the Heavenly Curve World again…” The ghost figure shook his head, he felt bitter in his heart.

“I hope I can meet him this time.”

The ghost figure immediately set off.

Soon, he arrived at the former base of Heavenly Curve Palace.

He did not make a wasted trip this time because he was indeed still in Heavenly Curve Palace.

“Mr. Jian Yi.”

The ghost figure came to Jian Wushuang and said with a smile. Although his expression was modest, he was not too afraid.

“Who are you?” Jian Wushuang looked at the person in front of him in confusion.

The aura of the person in front of him was very strange and obscure. However, Jian Wushuang could still tell that this person was a genuine Immortal Saint.

“I’m Dong Ling from the Bone Emperor Realm.” The ghost figure raised his head, revealing an extremely demonic young face.

“Bone Emperor Realm? You’re from the Bone Emperor Realm?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

The most powerful expert in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow was the Supreme Bone Emperor. Not only was he terrifyingly strong, but he was unrivaled in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. He also had many experts under his command, including several immortal saints.

When the Dragon-phoenix list was released, one of the Immortal Saints under the Bone Emperor went to attend the ceremony.

Now, Dong Ling was obviously the second one.

“Mr. Jian Yi, I’m here today on the order of my Lord Bone Emperor. My Lord wants to invite you to the Bone Emperor Realm to meet him,” Dong Ling said.

“Bone Emperor invited me?” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

He had no contact with this Bone Emperor, and they had no contact at all. But now, this Bone Emperor had specially sent someone to invite him.

This made Jian Wushuang curious about the purpose of the Bone Emperor.

“Could it be that the Bone Emperor felt threatened by my previous achievements and potential, so he came to find me?” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

However, he immediately denied this guess.

“No, that Bone Emperor is not a fool for being the overlord of the Nine Golden Crow Realms for so long. He should know that what I have is not limited by the Nine Golden Crow Realms. I will definitely leave the Nine Golden Crow Realms for a more vast place in the future. It won’t be long before I leave. There’s no need for him to get involved with me. He just needs to wait for me to leave. By then, he will still be the overlord of the Nine Golden Crow Realms. I won’t affect his status at all.”

“Secondly, even if he is very jealous, he should be able to tell that he can’t kill me.”

In the previous battle, Jian Wushuang had revealed many trump cards, including his immortal body.

Realm Master Tian Qu and the others could not control the immortal body at all, and they were still far from it.

However, as long as an expert had the immortal body, it would be very difficult for an Immortal Saint of the same level to kill him.

Although Jian Wushuang was not an Immortal Saint, his battle strength was much stronger than that of an ordinary Immortal Saint. Moreover, he had an immortal body. Therefore, even if Lord Bone Emperor attacked him personally, he could defeat or suppress him. However, it was impossible to kill him.

Bone Emperor should also know this.

Therefore, the Bone Emperor came to invite him was most likely not to deal with him but for other purposes.

However, Jian Wushuang could not guess what his purpose was.

“Mr. Dong Ling, do you know why the Bone Emperor invited me?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“My Lord hasn’t told me.” Dong Ling shook her head.

Jian Wushuang knocked on the armchair with his fingers. Then, after a moment of hesitation, he made a decision.

“Since the Bone Emperor invited me, I’ll go with you.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Seeing Jian Wushuang agree, Dong Ling also smiled.

After Jian Wushuang gave a few instructions to Divine Master Blood Lamp, he followed Dong Ling to the Bone Emperor Realm.

The Bone Emperor Realm was an Emperor Realm.

In terms of territory, the Bone Emperor Realm was much larger than the other realms in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow.

Half of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow territory was occupied by the Bone Emperor Realm.

With such a large territory, there were naturally more experts.

It was said that there were several Immortal Saints in the Bone Emperor realm, but most of them had submitted to the Bone Emperor.

Whether it was in the Bone Emperor Realm or in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, the Bone Emperor was a man of his word. From this, one could see his strength.
