Chapter 717: Xuan Yi’s Anger (Part 2)

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the air above them, a gigantic purple-haired man slowly emerged and dead silence immediately reigned over the whole area.

The strongest Eternal Realm expert in the Firmament Territory, Ancient Sect Palace Master Xuan Yi from Sword Palace, had arrived.

When the experts of the three magnates and the other eight top Sects saw Xuan Yi, they realized that his face didn’t have the usual mild expression.?Instead, he looked slightly ferocious. They all began to feel frightened at this moment.

The name of people, and the shadow of trees.

Xuan Yi was famous in the Firmament Territory and he was a nightmare for most of the Eternal Realm experts in the Firmament Territory.

Even though it was only his doppelganger, it still possessed unprecedented power.

“Jian Wushuang, he was my disciple.”

Xuan Yi said, in a voice that did not display any emotions, “Although he was only in the Skyscraping Realm, his strength was extraordinary. It would not be a problem at all for him to pass through the Eternal Zone. But he died in the end.”

“Cloud Sea Asgard, Immortal Dynasty and Boundless Demon Sect! You, the three magnates, should give me an explanation, shouldn’t you?”

“Explanation? What explanation?” Lady Red, the Elder who was leading the Cloud Sea Asgard group, snorted and continued, “The Eternal Zone is full of dangers. Even Eternal Realm experts can face death there, let alone those disciples in the Skyscraping Realm and the Divine Realm. Even one of the Elders from our Cloud Sea Asgard fell last time.”

“We, Cloud Sea Asgard, had more disciples die this time. Among the three who were in the superior Divine Realm, there was only one who came back alive. We also lost so much, so who should we go to for an explanation?”

“Life and death, poor or rich, it’s all destined. Your disciple has died in the Eternal Zone. The person you should blame is the one who was not strong enough. Who else is there to blame?”

The red-robed elder spoke in an unhurried manner and the experts of Cloud Sea Asgard, as well as the other two magnates, nodded along with him.

“Oh?” Xuan Yi raised his eyebrows, but his voice grew cold. “If my disciple really was killed by those Demon Gods, then I have nothing to say. However…”

Before he finished, Xuan Yi’s figure suddenly faded away, but when his figure appeared again, he had already grabbed someone’s hand. And that person was Wu Dao.

“Xuan Yi, what are you going to do?” All of the experts of Cloud Sea Asgard were extremely surprised.

Xuan Yi entirely ignored them and a purple light flashed in his eyes. Then, he looked towards Wu Dao.

Wu Dao looked back at Xuan Yi, but his eyes immediately grew empty.

“Tell me, did you seen my disciple in the Eternal Zone?” Xuan Yi asked.

“Yes,” Wu Dao nodded dully.

This scene greatly shocked everyone in the surroundings.

“What?” The Eternal Realm experts in Cloud Sea Asgard looked surprised and the expressions on their faces suddenly changed.

They were all aware of what had happened, Wu Dao was completely under Xuan Yi’s control.

He had taken over his mind directly, so Wu Dao was not even conscious of what was happening. All he could do was answer Xuan Yi’s questions slowly and honestly.

How was he doing it?

What an incredibly odd technique!

“Have the elders of Cloud Sea Asgard ordered you to kill my disciple?” Xuan Yi continued to ask.

“Yes,” Wu Dao continued to answer in a dull manner.

“Shit!”

“Damn it!”

“What… What…”

The Eternal Realm experts in Cloud Sea Asgard all began to panic.

They knew beforehand that Xuan Yi would be furious when they killed Jian Wushuang. However, no matter how mad he was, Xuan Yi wouldn’t completely lose it as long as he wasn’t able to find evidence proving that they did it.

But… They never expected Xuan Yi to have a method that directly controlled someone’s mind.

They had underestimated Xuan Yi.

“What happened?” Xuan Yi continued to ask.

“I found him, along with my junior brother, Dao Mei. We should have been able to kill him, but a group of Demon Gods appeared out of nowhere, so we could only escape. Dao Mei was killed by those Demon Gods and I narrowly escaped because of Secret Skill,” Wu Daomu said dully.

“I see,” Xuan nodded and immediately let go of Wu Dao.

Wu Dao quickly came back to his senses, then looked around blankly and said, “What happened? What happened to me?”

He had absolutely no idea what had happened. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

At this moment, Xuan Yi looked toward the experts of Cloud Sea Asgard with his ice-cold eyes.

“Cloud Sea Asgard, do you have anything you want to say now?” Xuan Yi’s voice grew cold.

Lady Red was somewhat terrified and shouted promptly, “Mr. Xuan Yi, Wu Dao did harm your disciple, but he wasn’t the one that killed him. Your disciple’s death had nothing to do with our Cloud Sea Asgard.”

“You’re right. I had intended to kill all 14 of your Eternal Realm experts, but I’ve decided to give you a discount, so I’ll only kill half of them.”

After saying that, he immediately made his move.

In an instant, a strikingly cold sword light appeared, filling up the entire area.

This sword light was extremely dazzling, but it also looked slow and stodgy, as if it possessed no power at all.

It didn’t seem like anything special, but this slow attack shocked all the Eternal Realm experts and their disciples.

Everyone had fallen into a trance. They had become immersed in this brilliant sword light and seemed to have forgotten everything.

The 14 Eternal Realm experts of Cloud Sea Asgard also went numb at that moment.

The sword light seemed to attack them, but none of the 14 experts tried to fight back.

Like a fool, they all went numb, allowing the sword light that appeared before them to freely dance around them.

Swish!

The sound of a sword being sheathed was heard as the sword light finally dissipated. The experts and disciples in the surrounding slowly came back to their senses.

Once they regained their senses, they looked forward and became completely stunned.

Among the people of Cloud Sea Asgard, the 14 Eternal Realm experts still stood there in a scattered manner, but seven of them were missing their heads.

Seven heads instantly flew up into the air at the same time.

With one sword, seven of fourteen Eternal Realms experts had been instantly killed.

Xuan Yi gently waved his sleeve as the sweeping Sword Essence faded away. His face still looked indifferent as if what happened just now had nothing to do with him.

The whole area remained completely silent.

A deathly silence.

And this silence hung over the area for a long time.
