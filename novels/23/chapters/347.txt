Translator: Transn Editor: Transn Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Performing the four Killing Moves, especially the Eighteen Levels of Hell, almost consumed all his Spiritual Power. The Spirit-recovering Elixir would help him recover some.

It began working as soon as he ate it. The size of the Giant behind him increased greatly, becoming hundreds of feet tall, and the power of its sword also soared.

The moment Jian Wushuang raised the Triple-kill Sword above his head, the towering Phantom Giant held up the Long Sword as well.

“Blood Emptying Technique, the third move!” Jian Wushuang shouted, with a hint of madness flashing in his eyes.

Instantly, a huge blood-red sword light swept out.

It was powerful. The moment the stroke lashed out, the whole area became dead still.

The Yin-Yang Dark Dragon Elixir, Eighteen Levels of Hell, and the third move of the Blood Emptying Technique made up his strongest move.

This was his fifth Killing Move.

The Blood River was tumbling and roaring. Second Holy Master, who was stuck inside it, felt as if his consciousness was being devoured by the influence of Eighteen Levels of Hell.

Eighteen Levels of Hell was completely different from Road to the Underworld and Bridge of Helplessness.

It was a special skill that suppressed consciousness.

Even Second Holy Master could barely keep conscious at this moment.

When the blood-red sword light dashed toward him, Second Holy Master could not perform some of his best moves to parry it. He could only wave his hand to throw out a punch.

In the blink of an eye, bang...

A loud boom was heard, causing invisible waves to spread out. Then, lots of plants in the mountains were crushed into dust.

Surprised, Second Holy Master spat out a mouthful of blood. Like a shooting star, he fell down at an amazing speed.

Boom!

Second Holy Master crashed into a giant mountain, thousands of feet away from their battlefield, causing the mountain to break. The elder passed through the mountain and continued to retreat.

Boom! Boom!

Second Holy Master went through two giant mountains in succession, leaving a hole in each mountain. Upon colliding with the third one, he barely managed to come to a stop, but found himself embedded in the mountain.

The whole area became quiet.

In the sky, the roaring Blood River gradually dissipated, as did Bridge of Helplessness and the blood-red pavilion. Jian Wushuang stood above the area with a pale complexion, clutching his chest and staring in the Second Holy Master’s direction.

A large number of onlookers, including many experts of the Saint Realm, could not help sucking in a breath of cold air.

Then they all looked at Jian Wushuang in unprecedented terror.

They originally thought that since Second Holy Master dealt with him personally, he would be able to kill him without a doubt.

But, what they saw was contrary to their expectations.

Jian Wushuang had taken the initiative in this fight.

Five Killing Moves!

He launched five Killing Moves in succession. Each move stronger than the previous one. He did not even give his opponent an opportunity to breathe.

Especially, the last Killing Move. It was so powerful that many top experts were terrified from the bottom of their heart.

Even the Wine Master was shocked when he watched Jian Wushuang perform that last move.

He knew that if he had been targeted by that last attack, he would...

All the onlookers were petrified!

Now they were worried about Second Holy Master instead.

“Is Second Holy Master dead?”

All the onlookers looked toward where Second Holy Master had landed with shock and curiosity.

Broken stones fell as a cloud of smoke and dust covered the hole, so they could not see the scene inside, making it unclear whether Second Holy Master was dead or not.

Suddenly... Swoosh... Lots of broken stones fell from the hole. Then, a black-robed person walked out and reappeared above the area.

The Wine Master’s face fell. He shook his head, sighed, and said, “Second Holy Master is Second Holy Master.”

The Wine Master thought that if Fourth Holy Master or Third Holy Master had been attacked with the five Killing Moves, they would have died. Second Holy Master was more powerful indeed.

“Alive!”

“Second Holy Master is still alive!”

“I knew he would not die with just this.”

Lots of experts sighed as they saw Second Holy Master’s appearance.

Second Holy Master’s aura had weakened.

He looked pale, with blood around the corner of his mouth.

His clothes were torn and one of his sleeves missing.

He looked bad and seriously injured.

But he was alive indeed!

“You didn’t die?” Jian Wushuang said while suspending in the air above.

His face fell and he stared at his opponent with hostility.

He had used his full strength to perform those five Killing Moves.

But Second Holy Master was still alive.

Jian Wushuang had reached his limit and used up all his Spiritual Power. He could no longer fight.

Now he knew that he was standing before the Gate of Hell.

Second Holy Master darkened his face. He wiped off the blood from around his mouth and coldly looked toward Jian Wushuang. “Boy, you do possess some strength. Even I was almost killed by you. If given more time, you would be stronger than me. But it’s pity, you won’t have such an opportunity.”

Then a greenish black Giant Hammer appeared in his hand.
