“Trump cards?” Jian Wushuang’s face fell.

However, all the spectators were tingling with excitement.

Gong Chao still had trump cards left?

“Try this move!”

Gong Chao stepped forward as he violently attacked his opponent with the Stone Cudgel.

It moved slowly.

Jian Wushuang frowned and subconsciously waved his sword to resist it, but when his sword crashed into the cudgel, he immediately felt a strange power which seemed gentle but was actually powerful enough to suppress his sword.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Gong Chao attacked again. The strike seemingly lashed out with mighty strength, but it became gentle in a head-on collision.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Gong Chao struck blows in succession. However, his Staff Technique was variable.?Sometimes it became powerful, but sometimes it was as gentle as water.

It was so exquisite that Jian Wushuang could not find a chance to fight back.

This marvelous skill confused him.

He was at a distinct disadvantage now. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Upon seeing this, the experts in the Skyward Pavilion were astonished.

“That is... Yin-Yang Dao?”

“Right, it’s the Yin-Yang Dao. Strong and weak, quick and slow. It really is the Yin-Yang Dao. Looking at this Staff Technique, he has a high understanding of the Yin-Yang Dao. Although his Yin-Yang Dao is inferior to his Thunderbolt Dao, he has comprehended its first Occult.”

“Gong Chao has actually comprehended the Yin-Yang Dao? It’s the hardest one among the various Daos. Most importantly, the combination of Yin and Yang requires excellent coordination. He is able to display his Staff Technique while giving full play to his Thunderbolt Dao, which means his battle strength has reached a new level.”

There were hundreds of types of Daos.

Yet, the Yin-Yang Dao was the most difficult and exquisite one among them.

Gong Chao switched smoothly between the Yin-Yang Dao and the Thunderbolt Dao as he launched continuous attacks, which placed even more pressure on his opponent.

”?Amazing. He is adept at two kinds of Dao.?” Jian Wushuang frowned, with a flicker of killing intent in his eyes.

“You’ve comprehended two separate Daos, but so have I!”

“You’re good at switching between the two Daos. On this point, I can’t match you, but what about two of me?”

Jian Wushuang snarled in his heart. The next moment, his body flashed.

Swoosh!

A figure appeared by his side.

This figure wore a black robe and held a longsword while radiating a mighty killing intent. He also looked the same as Jian Wushuang.

“What?”

Seeing another Jian Wushuang, Gong Chao was stunned.

It also startled the other geniuses.

“Two, two Jian Wushuangs?”

“One becomes two?”

“What, What’s that?”

All the geniuses were stupefied.

One of the Jian Wushuangs emanated killing intent while the other’s aura seemed to encompass the whole world.

They were his World Body and Slaughter Body.

His World Body, which was full of World Energy, held the Heart-killing Sword.

His Slaughter Body held the Triple-kill Sword while releasing an overwhelming killing intent.

“Kill! Kill!”

The World Body and Slaughter Body shouted at the exact same time as they charged toward their opponent.

“World Prison!”

Jian Wushuang’s World Body waved his hand and a huge World Prison appeared.

“Cataclysm Skill!”

The Slaughter Body wielded the Triple-kill Sword while converging his soaring killing intent into a single point.

If the two bodies merged into one, he was able to use both of the Daos but unable to switch as smoothly as Gong Chao. However, now they were two independent bodies, so they could fully release the power of the two Daos.

”?Emperor Xiao told me not to show my flawless foundation and Strongest Sword Soul, but he didn’t mention my two Original Bodies,?” Jian Wushuang thought.

The moment his two bodies attacked, the experts in the Skyward Pavilion stood up in shock.

“Doppelganger?”

“Doppelganger Secret Skill!”

“Wow, the boy from the Ancient World has actually mastered the Doppelganger Secret Skill!”

“A Skyscraping Realm boy is displaying the Doppelganger Secret Skill. Unbelievable!”

The experts were shocked.

The three experts representing the three magnates were unable to believe what they were witnessing.

“The Doppelganger Secret Skill? Even I haven’t mastered it,” the black-haired elder from Cloud Sea Asgard sighed.

“What a precious skill! It’s fabulous, even in our Eternal World. Aside from the three magnates and the Ancient Sect, the other eight top sects in the Firmament Territory don’t possess the Doppelganger Secret Skill, but a boy from the Ancient World has obtained it?” The arrogant middle-aged man from the Immortal Dynasty was also surprised.

The Doppelganger Secret Skill was valuable enough to arouse the attention of the three magnates as well as the other top sects.

It had a high cultivation requirement and a lot of limits. Even the Eternal Realm experts like the three experts from the three magnates were unable to create a doppelganger.

There was only one expert here who had a doppelganger, and that was Xuan Yi.

They did not know that Jian Wushuang had not practiced the Doppelganger Secret Skill as they thought.

He had been practicing a heaven-defying cultivation method which was greater than the Doppelganger Secret Skill, the Heavenly Creation Skill!

This skill provided him with a flawless foundation as well as the two Original Bodies.

His two bodies were totally different from doppelgangers.
