“Bang!”

Two formidable forces clashed, and the force of the red-haired youth quickly gained the upper hand.

Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword was forced slightly aside, and the long red spear continued to rush toward the chest of Jian Wushuang.

“Clang!”

It sounded like a clunk of metal smashing into metal when the spear hit Jian Wushuang’s scarlet-robe, which was actually his Blood-killing Plate Armor.

The robe absorbed 90 percent of the spear’s energy, but the remaining energy still spread into his body, causing considerable damage to him.

He felt as if his insides had been set on fire and spouted out a mouthful of blood.

“How come he’s so powerful?”?He cast a vigilant look at the red-haired youth.

Before the spear hit him, its powers had been eroded by the Quicksand Realm and the sandstorms and then been counteracted by his First Move of the Heaven’s Bane.

However, it still severely wounded him.

Its power grew less and less as it approached him, but the level of its remaining powers still went beyond that of an all-out attack from an ordinary Universe Master.

“He must be a top-notch Universe Master. Run, Jian Wushuang. Run!” Gu King urged.

Jian Wushuang was well aware that he was unable to compete with this red-haired youth.

Therefore, the moment he managed to stand on own his feet, he immediately activated his Strength of Soul and used his Dragon Blood Secret Skill to flee.

Upon seeing that Jian Wushuang was still alive after withstanding the blow, the red-haired youth was quite surprised. When the young man started to flee, he snorted coldly and chased after him.

While escaping, Jian Wushuang managed to contact the five Palace Masters.

“Palace Masters, I’ve just encountered another Universe Master from the Jin Kingdom. He’s way more powerful than the three kings. I’m confident that I can shake off the kings, but I’m not sure if I can escape from him,” said Jian Wushuang, hastily.

“Another Universe Master?”

“Are you saying that you’re ambushed by four kings?”

All the Palace Masters of the Green Fire Palace were startled.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re able to easily escape from Tianhuan King, Golden Rock King and Tianying King. Who else among the nine kings of the Jin Kingdom is able to stop you?” Void Temple Master asked with a frown.

“Yeah, who else? The nine kings of the Jin Kingdom are of almost equal strength. None of them is exceptionally powerful.” Tang Emperor echoed.

“Tell us more about this Universe Master. How does he look? What can he do?” asked Sunrise Sword Emperor.

“He’s a red-haired youth, and his weapon is a long red spear. He’s much more powerful than Golden Rock King, at least a dozen times stronger. He has severely wounded me with just one stab. Oh, when he wields his spear, there are red snowflakes falling down”

“A red-haired Universe Master, who’s a dozen times stronger than Golden Rock King? He uses a long spear, and when he wields it, there are red snowflakes?”?The five Palace Masters mused in silence. The next moment, Samsara Temple Master and Void Temple Master looked frantic simultaneously, and their pupils suddenly constricted. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“It’s Red Snow King!

“It’s him!”

Void Temple Master exclaimed in astonishment.

“What? Red Snow King?” Tang Emperor, Sunrise Sword Emperor and Red Lotus turned pale with fright and asked in disbelief.

“How is it possible? Red Snow King was killed during the battle between the Jin Kingdom and us 5,000,000 years ago. How come he’s still alive?” Void Temple Master spoke with a trembling voice.

“I can’t believe that he’s still alive!” Samsara Temple Master exclaimed in a hard, cold voice.

Five million years ago, when experts of the Jin Kingdomt had first come to this battlefield, they had more than nine kings.

Instead, there were 14 kings among them.

This Red Snow King was the strongest one among the kings.

Despite the fact that he was also a Universe Master, he was way more powerful than the other 13 kings. He was definitely a top-notch Universe Master.

Five million years ago, the Green Fire Palace had fought a last-ditch battle against experts from the Jin Kingdom and sacrificed a lot to kill Red Snow King on the battleground.

However, no one else than Red Snow King could severely wound Jian Wushuang with just one stab, so this Universe Master with a long spear in hand must have been Red Snow King.

“Red Snow King is far stronger than an ordinary Universe Master. Among all experts in the Green Fire Palace, only Samsara Temple Master is able to resist him with the help of some treasures. The other Palace Masters can only escape when encountering him.”

“Red Snow King is well-known for his amazing speed and formidable offensive power. He’s also on this mission to kill Jian Wushuang. This boy is really in danger!” said Tang Emperor.

“Samsara, you’re out on the battlefield right now. How long will it take for you to reach Jian Wushuang if you travel as fast as you can?” asked Void Temple Master.

“Yes, I’m on the battlefield but quite distant from his location. I guess I need at least several days to reach him,” sighed Samsara Temple Master.

“Several days?” The other four Palace Masters exclaimed simultaneously. The situation looked grim for them.

Red Snow King was after Jian Wushuang at this moment. It would be lucky for the boy to resist him for a few hours, not to mention several days.

Upon hearing the reply of Samsara Temple Master, Jian Wushuang, who was busy running away from Red Snow King, knew that he could only rely on himself now.

“Several days?” he murmured to himself with a frown and then turned his head to look back. The next moment, his pupils constricted.

Not far behind him, Red Snow King spread a pair of golden wings, which enabled him to move even faster than before. Suppressed by Jian Wushuang’s Quicksand Realm, he still moved a little bit faster than the boy.

Upon seeing that, Jian Wushuang made up his mind.

“Palace Masters, you don’t need to worry about me anymore. I’ll try my best to make the Jin Kingdom suffer!” With these words, he halted the communication.

The five Palace Masters of the Green Fire Palace were rendered speechless after hearing his words.

They knew clearly what Jian Wushuang was going to do.

As he could not escape from the grip of Red Snow King, he intended to face off against this mighty Universe Master and try his best to cause losses to the Jin Kingdom even at the cost of his own life.

“Alas…” Tang Emperor sighed, feeling helpless.

In the meantime, Jian Wushuang looked unprecedentedly determined on the battlefield.
