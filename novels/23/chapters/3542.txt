Chapter 3544: Appeared Three Times

As Jian Wushuang had said, the flight-type true treasure had improved his life-saving ability and pursuit ability, but the improvement was limited. The key point was that his life-saving ability was very strong. Even if the ruler personally attacked him, he might not be able to kill him.

As for his pursuit ability...in the great Universe Battlefield, he had a grudge with the Sacred Island. However, the Sacred Island was a small force without a ruler-level expert. There were not many experts in the Universe Battlefield, it was rare to meet them on a normal day. Naturally, he did not need to deliberately pursue anyone.

Compared to the flight-type true treasure, the Absolute Shadow Sword was obviously more useful to him.

With his current strength, after activating the life divine power and the first level of the Blood Crystal Armor, his battle strength was at the peak of the five void realms. Combined with the swordsmanship he created…if he could have another powerful attack supreme treasure, he would be able to compete with ordinary experts of the six void realms.

The Absolute Shadow Sword had such a great improvement for Jian Wushuang.

“With my strength, if I can use the Absolute Shadow Sword, the power of my swordsmanship will not be weaker than that of an ordinary expert of the six void realms. Once I use the heaven-cleaving skill, I can easily crush an ordinary expert of the six void realms,” Jian Wushuang muttered, he immediately exchanged for the Absolute Shadow Sword with 250 contribution points.

After the exchange, Axe One Master personally handed the sword to him.

“Is this the Shadow Sword?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the purple sword in front of him, which was emitting a faint cold light.

The purple sword was about the same length as the Blood Mountain Sword, but its body was thinner and its blade sharper. It floated in the air and emitted a suffocating, cold aura, which made people fear it.

The name of the sword was Absolute Shadow, so it was a divine sword that focused more on killing and cutting.

“My young friend, please recognize me as your master,” Axe One Master said.

Jian Wushuang nodded and immediately dropped a drop of his blood essence into the Absolute Shadow Sword. Soon, the sword recognized him as its master and refined it.

After that, Jian Wushuang finally grasped the divine sword.

“This sword is so cold.” Jian Wushuang held the sword tightly in his right hand, but he could feel the extreme coldness from it.

It was so cold that it was suffocating.

“Unfortunately, I’m in the Star Palace now, so I can’t find a suitable opponent to test the power of this sword. I can only find a suitable opponent to test it when I go to the core area of Devil Smoke Valley later.” Jian Wushuang smiled. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

He had obtained the Absolute Shadow Sword. As for the Blood Mountain Sword that Jian Wushuang had used before...it was refined by his master Xuan Yi. Jian Wushuang had used it from his previous life until this one, so they had a deep relationship.

Even now that he had the more powerful Absolute Shadow Sword, Jian Wushuang did not intend to give it up. Instead, he carried it on his back as usual.

“Unless I am facing an expert who is much stronger than me, I will use the Blood Mountain Sword to fight against him. I will use the Absolute Shadow Sword to defeat him after I have a clear understanding of its strength,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

After exchanging 250 contribution points for the Absolute Shadow Sword, although Jian Wushuang still had 20 contribution points left, he could not use them to exchange for anything useful.

“Axe One Master.” Jian Wushuang suddenly looked at Axe One Master and asked, “Can you ask about something for me?”

“What is it?” Axe One Master asked.

“Ice-heart glazed jade. Have you heard of it, Axe One Master?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Ice-heart glazed jade?” Axe One Master’s expression changed and he nodded deeply, “Of course I’ve heard of it, but it’s a very rare treasure. My dear Heaven Marquis, do you need this ice-heart glazed jade?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “My wife’s soul is now attached to the star-moon agarwood that has existed for hundreds of millions of years. Only when we find the ice-heart glazed jade can we reconstruct her body.”

“Is that so?” Axe One Master understood, but he immediately frowned. “Although there are a lot of opportunities in the three Universe Battlefields and some special treasures appear from time to time, treasures at the level of the ice-heart glazed jade are very rare. In the long time since the Star Palace was founded, this ice-heart glazed jade has only appeared three times.”

“Three times?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

“Yes, and they were all born in the depths of the three battlefields. Although they were born three times, the environment of the first birth of the iceheart glazed jade was too harsh. Not long after it was born, the surrounding experts fell into a terrible inferno and were burned on the spot before they could fight for it,” Axe One Master said.

“Incinerate? A treasure like the iceheart glazed jade can be incinerated?”Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Nothing is impossible. After all, there are a lot of divine flames of destruction in the depths of Devil Smoke Valley. The lower-level divine flames of destruction are fine, but the higher-level divine flames of destruction can even burn a ruler-level expert to death. Although the iceheart glazed jade is a rare treasure, it can still be incinerated at the level of the divine flames of destruction,” Axe One Master said.

“What about the other two times?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The second appearance of the iceheart glazed jade was much better. In the end, it was also obtained by an expert of the six void realms. However, after he obtained the iceheart glazed jade, he sold it to a ruler-level expert for a very high price,” Axe One Master said.

“Ruler? That ruler also needs the iceheart glazed jade?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

“Yes, that ruler-level expert is like you. His wife only has a soul, and your soul is too weak to be possessed. Therefore, the ruler managed to get the iceheart glazed jade from the six void realm expert. Then, he used the iceheart glazed jade to create a glazed body and a divine body for his wife. After that, he and his wife disappeared. I guess they went to the depths of the universe,” said Axe One Master.

“What about the last time?” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists and stared at Axe One Master.

One of the two pieces of ice heart glazed jade had been burned and the other had been used. Jian Wushuang only hoped for the last piece of ice heart glazed jade.

“The last piece of ice heart glazed jade should still be preserved because I’ve never heard of anyone who yearned for it. However, the person who got it was not a nobody,” Axe One Master said.
