Chapter 763: Leaving the Zone

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Palace Master Destruction, everyone is here. Let’s go.” An old lady who had some red spots on her face said.

This old lady was also an extremely experienced Palace Master in the Ancient Sect. She was called Palace Master Water Wood.

“No need to rush, some have yet to come,” Palace Master Destruction answered.

“There are still others?” The Palace Masters were puzzled.

A total of nine experts from the Ancient Sects were going to enter the Eternal Zone and they were all present.

Palace Master Destruction did not explain further and showed a mysterious smile. Those who knew what was going on, such as Mo Tao, Baiyu, Ming Xin and Ling Yu, all had a similar unfathomable smile and did not explain further.

The nine of them continued to wait for half a day at the Heavenly Stone Valley before a figure appeared in front of them.

“Here he comes!” Palace Master Destruction’s eyes lit up.

The others all looked at the newcomer.

“Haha, sorry to have kept all of you waiting.”

Jian Wushuang’s light-hearted laughter echoed throughout the valley. He then appeared immediately in front of all of them with a long sword on his back.

Five of the nine Palace Masters, including Destruction and Mo Tao, had already expected his arrival. Thus, they were naturally not surprised. On the other hand, Palace Master Water Wood and the other three Palace Masters were at a loss.

“Jian… Jian Wushuang?” Palace Master Water Wood’s eyes were widely opened and fixated on Jian Wushuang.

The other three Palace Masters all wore a horrified look as they looked at Jian Wushuang, as if they had seen a ghost.

“You’re so slow. If you arrive half a day later, you’ll miss us again,” said Palace Master Destruction with a smile.

“Sorry, I’ve been delayed by some matters that needed to be handled.” Jian Wushuang also smiled.

“Okay, it’s good enough that you arrived before we left. The space wormhole is ready, let’s go,” Palace Master Destruction said.

“Yes, let’s go.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

The Palace Masters and Jian Wushuang immediately headed to the edge of the Tianqi Mountains.

On the way there, Palace Master Water Wood and the other three Palace Masters asked Jian Wushuang some questions out of curiosity. Jian Wushuang answered them while omitting those that he should not be telling.

? ? About two hours later, they arrived at their destination. There was a wormhole in front of them. The tunnel was opened temporarily, and would only be opened for a short time. Therefore, if they were to miss it, they would have to wait for another 100 years. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Jian Wushuang, before we leave the Eternal Zone, I have to something to tell you,” Palace Master Destruction turned to him.

“I’m listening.” Jian Wushuang listened carefully.

“You’ve been lost in the Eternal Zone for a hundred years and the people outside all think you’ve died,” Palace Master Destruction said seriously, “this time when you’re back, they must be very curious about you.

“Afterall, the Eternal Realm is a land of opportunities. For so many years, the experts from all sects in the Firmament Territory have been fighting with the Demon Gods. Hence, we understand them very well. They loathe the humans and will kill us without hesitation if we come across them.

“But after living in the garden of the Demon God Clan for a whole 100 years, not only are you still in one piece, your strength even improved so much.

“There’s no way they won’t be interested in your stories from the past 100 years.”

Palace Master Destruction paused for a while before continuing, “Without fail, as soon as you step out, the experts from the sects, especially the three magnates, will question you, even forcing you to answer. You better think of what to say in advance.”

There seemed to be a deeper meaning to what Palace Master Destruction just said.

Jian Wushuang naturally understood what he meant. He answered with a nod, “I’ve already thought about it on the way here, I’ll tell them that I’ve been hiding for all those years.”

“Hiding for all those years?” The Masters shot Jian Wushuang an odd glance.

Even they would not believe Jian Wushuang’s excuse, let alone the three magnates and the experts.

Seeing their expression, Jian Wushuang felt a little helpless. Should he just tell them that he actually had the bloodline of the Ancient God Clan, which was why they treated him like their own people?

If he said so, the three magnates and other sects would seize him.

After all, as a Gold-armored Ancient God who also had Imperial Bloodline, he had the highest status and rank in the clan. Those Three-star Ancient God treated him with respect. As long as he was willing, he could easily set up a Baptismal Pool or get his hands on the Essence Blood of an Ancient God.

This was much faster than waiting for the experts of Firmament Territory to enter the Tianqi Mountains every 100 years and fight for them.

“Fine. If you really can’t think of other excuses, make do with this.” Palace Master Destruction smiled. “The Eternal Zone is so big, it’s actually possible that you found a place to hide for 100 years without running into any Demon God.”

“Besides this, there is one more thing I must tell you. 100 years ago, Palace Master Xuan Yi was enraged by the news that you were killed inside the Eternal Zone. He killed seven Eternal Realm experts of the Cloud Sea Asgard and forced another two magnates, on top of numerous sects, to give out their Divine Gems to take revenge for you!

“After all, it was about your death during that time. Besides, it was proven that the Cloud Sea Asgard did send their disciples out to kill you. Since Xuan Yi was so powerful, the three magnates, as well as the other top sects, could only suck it up and do as told!

“Thus, if they find out that you are still alive, they will not let this 100-year-old matter down easily.”

“Hmph!”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help but gave a bitter laugh.

He never thought that his master would do so many things to take revenge for him.

“But after all, this whole thing was started by Xuan Yi. He is very capable and will have a solution for it. You don’t have to worry too much about it. After we get out of Eternal Zone, you can explain the matter to Xuan Yi and get him to tidy things up,” said Palace Master Destruction.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly but deep down, he could not help being worried.

He knew that the others would think there had to be a secret behind him surviving such a long time in Eternal Zone.

The three magnates and top sects would be desperate to get the secret out of him.

The world outside was now a lion’s den to him.

“Desperate times call for desperate measures!”

“No matter what, since I have to leave this place sooner or later, I can’t hide from it forever. I can only face it straight-on!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and his gaze flickered.

“Let’s go!”

After Palace Master Destruction gave his orders, the other masters, as well as Jian Wushuang, gradually stepped into the wormhole in front of them.

Finally, Jian Wushuang was leaving this place that he had been staying in for a whole 100 years!

He was leaving the Ancient God Clan!

Perhaps, he would return someday. But it was for sure that it would be many years later.
