Chapter 2155 Blaton Search

“That is right. If I am not wrong, they must be hiding in the Three Emperors World, be it a very distant place or a dangerous place.” Emperor Bai nodded his head in agreement and continued.“Tian Chen, order the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World to search this place carefully.”

“Roger that.” Ancestor Tian Chen went off to pass the order.

What followed was a blatant and through search within the Three Emperors World.

Even though the Three Emperors World was huge, there were thousands of almighties from the Eternal Chaotic World. If they split up and search, they could search the entire world in a short amount of time.

However, the great emperors would not involve the great emperors.

Jian Wushuang took this time to go into a secret room.

He sat down and a golden sword appeared in front of him.

It was the Hong Jun Golden Sword.

This was the legitimate Hong Jun Golden Sword. He had got it when he’d killed Zi Chen.

The legitimate Hong Jun Golden Sword was much more powerful than the replica.

Jian Wushuang knew this clearly. When he had just reached the fighting power of a great emperor, he had fought Zi Chen. Even though he was slightly stronger, he had still lost when the originals and replicas of the Hong Jun Golden Swords clashed. This was due to the swords themselves.

Now that Jian Wushuang had the legitimate Hong Jun Golden Swords, he was going to refine them.

“The experts from the Ancient Past had really amazing techniques. They could make replicas that greatly resembled the original. Even the aura from the two different swords were exactly the same. The only difference is probably the power.” Jian Wushuang smiled lightly.

Before long, he started refining the swords.

The process of refining the swords was not complicated.

Within a day, Jian Wushuang managed to refine all nine Hong Jun Golden Swords.

“Let me try out its power.” Jian Wushuang thought with anticipation. He controlled one of the Hong Jun Golden Swords as it flew forward.

Whoosh!

A golden beam of light burst forth instantly.

Under his control, the sword maneuvered around the room at a great speed, changing directions every now and then. The sword itself could not be spotted. All one could see was the golden light it emitted.

“Oh boy. The speed increased by so much?” Jian Wushuang was excited.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand as another Hong Jun Golden Sword appeared in front of him. It was the replica version.

Whoosh!

The same golden light burst forth. Even though it had great speed, it was obvious that it was on a completely different level compared to the original version.

Most importantly, the sound the original sword made when it sliced the air was much stronger and piercing.

“This speed… the original is at least three times faster than the replica!” Jian Wushuang clenched his fist as he tested out the power of the Hong Jun Golden Sword.

Boom! Boom!

Both of the Hong Jun Golden Swords burst forth and attacked the void space.

One of the void spaces twisted and turned, while the other burst open.

It looked like the latter had greater power, but Jian Wushuang could feel that the first one had concentrated its power and none was lost.

“Oh my. Based on power alone, the original Hong Jun Golden Sword is at least twice as powerful as the replica. I currently have the fighting power of a stage-three great emperor. The attack from one Hong Jun Golden Sword is equivalent to that of a stage-three great emperor, and I can control seven of them!”

“If I use all seven of the Hong Jun Golden Swords together….”

Jian Wushuang was excited.

Hong Jun Golden Sword?was a very powerful weapon from the Ancient past. It was favoured by many experts that meditated on the Spacetime Doctrine

The Hong Jun Golden Sword was also incredibly powerful.

Ever since Jian Wushang had received the replica Hong Jun Golden Sword from Long Qi, it had benefitted him greatly. Now that he had received the original Hong Jun Golden Sword, he would benefit even more!

“After obtaining the nine Hong Jun Golden Swords, my battle power has increased significantly. If I am ever surrounded again, I can kill them all as long as they are not as powerful as me.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Jian Wushuang remained inside the secret room to familiarize himself with the nine new Hong Jun Golden Swords.

In the blink of an eye, half a month passed.

During this period of time, the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World flipped the Three Emperors World upside down.

It was a pity that they still could not find the experts from the Three Emperors World who were hiding.

Even though they did not find the experts, they found clues.

“Jian Wushuang, come and find me.” Emperor Bai sent a message to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang left the secret room he was in and went to find Emperor Bai inside the palace.

Ancestor Tian Chen too was in the palace.

“Emperor Bai, have you found them?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I have found some clues but we cannot confirm them yet. We need someone to explore the clues first,” Emperor Bai said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Ancestor Tian Chen whipped out a star map.

This was the complete and detailed map of the Three Emperors World.

After Ancestor Tian Chen had taken out the map, he pointed at a certain territory.

“From our deductions, the experts from the Three Emperors World should be hiding here, at this place called the Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground.” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

“Ancient Blood Forbidden Ground?” Jian Wushuang was surprised. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You have heard of it?” Emperor Bai squinted his eyes and looked over.

“Of course,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.
