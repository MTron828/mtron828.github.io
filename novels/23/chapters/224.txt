Chapter 225: The Illusory Realm of Slaughter (Part Three)

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“I’m Wu Xin, the guardian of this world!” Staring at Jian Wushuang, the green-clothed elder said coldly, “Sir, it’s enough that you, an outsider, has intruded into this world. Why must you slaughter here?

“How long have you been in this world, and how many people have you killed?

“Why did you kill them?

“Who you are to kill them?

“Did you know that they were all ordinary beings, among which were old and young? But they all died in your hands!

“Do you think that it is pleasant to kill them, or are you high on killing?

“Tell me why! Tell me!”

As the green-clothed elder finished speaking, his voice almost became a roar.

“Why?” A slight surprise flashed through Jian Wushuang’s eyes as he took a breath and turned to the green-clothed elder.

“I will not attack unless I’m attacked. If I’m attacked, I will certainly counterattack!

“They wanted to kill me, so I killed them!

“If you’re going to kill me, I will kill you too!

“This is the way of killing that I’ve always been following!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold, and when he was talking, the firmness in his eyes did not waver at all.

“What kind of way of killing! In my eyes, you are keen on slaughter. No matter what you say, today I must kill you with my sword,” the green-clothed elder said loudly, and then stepped out suddenly. Just with three consecutive steps, he arrived before Jian Wushuang.

“Demon, go to hell!”

Staring at Jian Wushuang, the green-clothed elder hacked out with the heavy sword in his hand. The sword edge cut through the Void, and directly hacked toward Jian Wushuang’s head.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold and he suddenly raised his head.

Boom… A terrifying killing intent instantly swept out.

Suddenly the world changed color, and the entire space completely froze at this moment.

The killing intent could frighten the Heavens and move the Earth.

This killing intent was condensed through Jian Wushuang’s slaughter of many people ever since he had stepped into this illusion.

He had killed so many people in this illusion that his killing intent would increase by one point every time he killed one more. After such a long period of time, his killing intent had reached an alarming point.

Even if it was only an outbreak of killing intent, it could easily make warriors of the Primordial Gold Core Realm lose their minds.

However, in the illusion, although the green-clothed elder in front of Jian Wushuang was at the Primordial Gold Core Realm, he was born from the illusion. So no matter how strong Jian Wushuang’s killing intent was, it could not, in fact, affect this green-clothed elder at all.

But suddenly the Triple-kill Sword on Jian Wushuang’s back was unsheathed and turned into a cold flowing light that directly hacked out.

Bang!

With a loud blast, the ground below Jian Wushuang’s feet cracked suddenly and his body sank.

As soon as he fell into the illusion, he could not use his spiritual power or even the World Origin that he had comprehended. It would be hard since he could only rely on the combination of the four sword essences and swordsmanship to fight against the green-clothed elder, who was in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm, however, he still had the strength to attempt it.

“Go to hell!” The green-clothed elder’s eyes were crimson and full of murderous intent.

The heavy sword struck again and again, and Jian Wushuang tried his best to fight against it. Just like a wooden boat falling into a storm, he could be destroyed at any time.

When the fierce fight started, Jian Wushuang found that the sword essences he had comprehended were gradually disappearing.

“I can’t use spiritual power nor World Origin, and now can’t I even use the sword essences?”?Jian Wushuang frowned tightly.

He could barely contend with the green-clothed elder if he only relied on his comprehension of the sword essences. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

But now that his comprehension of the sword essences was also disappearing and the rate at which this was happening was so fast that in moments, Jian Wushuang found he could not sense any sword essence.

Boom!

A towering sword light suddenly struck down.

The power of the sword light was not very strong. If it was in the outside world, it was just close to the strength of warriors on the Earthly Dragon List. Normally, such a sword light was nothing to Jian Wushuang. He could smash numerous such sword lights just by just raising his hands. But now… he could not use spiritual power, World Origin, or sword essences.

This sword light became a deadly sword.

“Go to hell, demon!” The green-clothed elder was still crazily roaring.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes also turned crazy, and his killing intent seemed to form the essence. Endless killing intent converged at one point and then burst out suddenly.

“Whoever wants to kill me, I will kill him!”

“Go to hell!”

Jian Wushuang also roared crazily, and the Triple-kill Sword in his hand directly stabbed out.

Still lacking any spiritual power or sword essence, the moment this sword stabbed out, it was covered by perpetual killing intent. Meanwhile, an extremely violent power mixed with the longsword and turned into a terrible sword light that was capable of piercing through mountains.

Bang!

The heavy sword in the green-clothed elder’s hand directly flew out, but the power of the sword light did not abate at all. Rushing towards the green-clothed elder with irresistible force, the sword light directly penetrated through the elder’s body and left a huge hole in his chest.

The green-clothed elder had a feeling of incredible disbelief before he died, and then his body powerlessly fell to the ground.

The moment the green-clothed elder fell down, the endless heavens and earth began to suddenly collapse.

Mountains, rivers, trees, the sky, and the earth all completely disappeared at this moment.

Everything was peaceful again.

In the pitch-black palace of the Ancestor’s Land, Jian Wushuang looked at the darkness around him.

He knew that he had broken through the illusion.

The absolute beauty, who had been waiting quietly in the palace to watch everything, arrived before Jian Wushuang with the strong man. She took a deep look at Jian Wushuang and said, “Boy, congratulations! You have mastered Slaughter Origin and have stepped onto the path of slaughter.”

“Slaughter Origin?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed, and the towering killing intent in his body suddenly swept out. Although it was not as violent as in the illusion, it was still unusual.

Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang also sensed the new power that he had mastered.

This power was very similar to World Origin that he had mastered.

Slaughter Origin!

Similar to the sword essence, the Origin had different types.

The reason why he had been able to kill the green-clothed elder with one sword move was that he understood Slaughter Origin at the last moment.

In the Illusory Realm of Slaughter, World Origin he comprehended could not be used, but Slaughter Origin he had just understood could be used to its fullest extent. Slaughter Origin blended into swordsmanship, which caused the power of his swordsmanship to rise suddenly and sharply, thus allowing him to kill the green-clothed elder of the Exceptional Gold Core Realm with one sword move.

“Is the test of the Ancestor’s Land to comprehend Slaughter Origin?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes.” The absolute beauty nodded. “The first test of the Ancestor’s Land can be divided into three steps, but all these steps are focused around Slaughter Origin.

“Slaughter Origin is an extremely violent Origin that is difficult to control. A warrior who is lucky to understand Slaughter Origin, if his mind isn’t firm enough, is very likely to be directly controlled by Slaughter Origin and become a mad demon that only knows how to kill. As a result, the first step to this test is your ability to master it.

“So you went through six roars of ‘Killing’ at the beginning.”
