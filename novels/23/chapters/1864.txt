Chapter 1865: Great Present

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Universe Galaxy, inside the base of the Lineage of Star.

During this period of time, news of the Star Palace Master dying had already spread to the outside world. As for the experts and disciples in the Lineage of Star, they had also heard about the news and they felt restless. However, with Hall Master Yuan reassuring them, there was no trouble.

The Lineage of Star was just like before.

As for Hall Master Yuan, he was waiting quietly for the results of the battle to spread.

During that battle, scouts from all the powerhouses in the Sanctuary Alliance were present. Naturally, the scouts from the Lineage of Star were present as well and there was a large number of them.

The course of events in the battle was relayed to Hall Master Yuan immediately. When he knew that Jian Wushuang and his group of people had had a huge victory and that they were on their way back, he heaved a sigh of relief.

In no time, Jian Wushuang and the two Hall Masters returned to the Star Palace.

“Haha, let’s welcome the triumphant return of our three heroes,” Hall Master welcomed them, laughing loudly.

Jian Wushuang and the two Hall Masters laughed heartily.

“After this battle, our Lineage of Star has revealed a great force of deterrent. Next, Hall Master Yuan… please go ahead and settle that matter,” Jian Wushuang said.

Hall Master Yuan’s expression changed. He knew which matter Jian Wushuang was referring to.

Previously, before the news of the Star Palace Master dying had spread, the Lineage of Star had been doing recruitment secretly by offering many experts who travelled alone attractive deals.

Among these experts who travelled alone, some of them were attracted. However, the Lineage of Star did not get them to give their answer right away.

After the news of the Star Palace Master being dead was spread, these experts who travelled alone hesitated again. After all, it was risky for them to join the Lineage of Star at this point of time.

Jian Wushuang had known about this a long time ago. Hence, he had never pressed them for replies but instead gave them enough time to consider. It was not until the recent battle where the Lineage of Star had defeated the Abysmal Palace head-on and was powerful enough to frighten everyone that he had made it known to those experts that the Lineage of Star possessed absolute abilities and confidence to deal with any kind of danger.

At this stage, they could show themselves for real and officially invite those experts who travelled alone.

“Hall Master Yuan, how many experts do you think you can recruit successfully?” Hall Master Gu Xin looked at Hall Master Yuan.

“Before the battle with the Abysmal Palace, I had no confidence at all and being able to recruit about two to three Almighties was already considered not too bad. However, now… I reckon that I can recruit at least ten experts who travelled alone and were also at the level of Almighty. Moreover, the numbers might even be more,” Hall Master Yuan laughed.

“That’s great,” the eyes of Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Shi Yun brightened up.

“I shall leave this matter to you, Hall Master Yuan,” Jian Wushuang said.

“No problem,” Hall Master Yuan was extremely confident.

While Jian Wushuang was still having a discussion with regards to some matters with the three Hall Masters…

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed abruptly.

“What’s wrong?” the three Hall Masters looked at Jian Wushuang at the same.

“Do you remember that after I destroyed the Deluge Fortress, I told all of you that I used the price of one Chaos Divine Treasure-level armor to recruit that Emperor God Jiu Yin to the Lineage of Star? Emperor God Jiu Yin agreed to it on the spot. However, he needed some time. And now, Emperor God Jiu Yin has already arrived outside the Universe Galaxy,” Jian Wushuang said while stroking his nose.

“Emperor God Jiu Yin?”

“Emperor God Jiu Yin has come?”

Hall Master Yuan and the two other Hall Masters were over the moon.

After all, Emperor God Jiu Yin was a genuine Emperor God expert. Although he was not a Peak Emperor God, he was definitely a great fighting force to the Lineage of Star.

“Let’s go. Follow me and let’s welcome Emperor God Jiu Yin together,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

Hall Master Yuan and the two other Hall Masters naturally followed behind Jian Wushuang.

In no time, the four of them arrived at the edge of the Universe Galaxy.

“Emperor God Jiu Yin,” as Jian Wushuang looked at the unusually evil black-robed young man at the void in front, he revealed a smile.

“Haha, Sword Emperor,” Emperor God Jiu Yin walked over right away and after he came before Jian Wushuang, he greeted him kindly. As for the three Hall Masters behind Jian Wushuang, he nodded his head to signal to them. After that, he spoke: “I have said before that within thousands of years, I would definitely come to the Lineage of Star. Now that I have come, I wonder if the Lineage of Star and you, Sword Emperor, are still willing to accept me?”

“Of course we accept you,” Jian Wushuang laughed apathetically.

“Emperor God Jiu Yin, for you to be willing to become a Guest Elder of the Lineage of Star, the Lineage of Star is greatly honored by your presence,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Emperor God Jiu Yin grinned and said abruptly: “Oh right. When I was on my way here, I heard that the Abysmal Palace had fought their way here. What is the situation now?”

“The Abysmal Palace has already retreated,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Retreated?” Emperor God Jiu Yin was surprised, “What happened? The Abysmal Palace is a super big powerhouse that is ranked in the top three in the Sanctuary Alliance. Moreover, they have been extremely aggressive and it is impossible for them to have a good start but a poor finish. Since they came for the Lineage of Star this time around, they would definitely attack you. Strange… and I still hurried here at my fastest speed, hoping that I would be of some help to all of you.”

Upon hearing Emperor God Jiu Yin’s words, Jian Wushuang’s heart twitched.

He could tell that Emperor God Jiu Yin had just happened to head to the Lineage of Star. However, after hearing the news about the Abysmal Palace taking action against the Lineage of Star, he had made the best use of his speed to hurry over to help them immediately. However, it was a pity that he was too late.

“Emperor God Jiu Yin, you are right. The Abysmal Palace never let their enemies off. Since they said that they would take action, they would definitely take action. However, it’s a pity that you are too late. Not long ago, my Lineage of Star already fought an intense battle with the Abysmal Palace. Moreover, we defeated them,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Defeated them?” Emperor God Jiu Yin was dumbfounded, “The Lineage of Star defeated the Abysmal Palace head-on? Is this a joke? Could it be that the Star Palace Master took action personally?”

“The Palace Master did not take action. However, the Abysmal Palace has indeed been defeated by us. Moreover, they retreated with a great defeat. This piece of news will probably be made known to you soon,” Jian Wushuang said.

After hearing what was said, Emperor God Jiu Yin was shocked.

He then raised his head and looked at Jian Wushuang with astonishment. After that, he calmed down slowly.

“Forget it. It’s all good since they have been defeated,” Emperor God Jiu Yin laughed and looked at Jian Wushuang again, “Sword Emperor, back then, when you used a Chaos Divine Treasure-level defense armor to recruit me into the Lineage of Star, I said that I would look for you after a few years and I would also bring you a great present. Now, it’s time for me to fulfill my promise and I have brought you the great present.”

“A great present?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Back then, Emperor God Jiu Yin had indeed said that. However, Jian Wushuang was not concerned with it at all.

He had not expected Emperor God Jiu Yin to actually bring him a great present.

“I wonder what this great present is?” Jian Wushuang questioned while laughing.

With his abilities and identity then, normal treasures and opportunities would be unable to attract his attention.

Hence, what kind of item would be considered a great present to him?
