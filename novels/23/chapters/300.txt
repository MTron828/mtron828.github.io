Chapter 301: A Fierce Fight

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The onlookers were stunned.

“Too, too strong!”

“The Lord of Skywave Prefecture is terrifying! I feel like his casual punch could kill me.”

“Swordsman is also strong. He was able to fight him to a draw for now!”

Everyone had gleaming eyes as they stared at the two.

They knew both sides had just made tentative attacks, so they had not used their full strength.

Nobody noticed the two figures that were standing in the air near the battlefield and watching the fight. They were Leng Rushuang and her sister.

“Big brother is quite powerful!” her sister said.

“Powerful?” Leng Rushuang replied with cold eyes, “For someone that is only in the Profound Yang Void Realm, his battle strength is good.”

Compared to other’s great acclaim, Leng Rushuang thought Jian Wushuang’s performance was just good.

While standing above the area, Jian Wushuang and the Lord of Skywave Prefecture both stabilized their body and looked at each other.

“Good, no wonder you dared to challenge me. You do indeed possess some strength.” Lord of Skywave Prefecture stared at Jian Wushuang in the same way he would look at his prey.

“As a Lord of a prefecture, you haven’t shown your full strength, right? Show it, or it will be boring for me to attack you,” Jian Wushuang said casually.

Lord of Skywave Prefecture had shown his scary strength in the fierce confrontation.

He had comprehended Origin of All Beasts and Origin of Raging Fire, reaching the peak of “Momentum”. He also could activate 90 percent of Origin of Heaven and Earth. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The Lord of Skywave Prefecture was not weaker than him in the enlightenment of the Origin. His attack was violent and strong, much stronger than an ordinary Half-saint expert. It was no wonder that he had battle strength of the Saint Realm and was qualified to be the lord of a prefecture.

Jian Wushuang clearly understood that the Lord of Skywave Prefecture had not displayed his real battle strength and that he lived up to his rank on the Bloodmoon List.

“I haven’t used my full strength in a long time because no one could make me, but you’re qualified,” the Lord of Skywave Prefecture said with a faint smile.

He took out a pair of red gloves, which were full of scary mysterious cracks, and slowly put on them.

The onlookers could not help but exclaim.

The Lord of Skywave Prefecture had fought against Jian Wushuang using his fist, but now he was going to use his gloves.

This pair of gloves was his weapon.

“The Lord of Skywave Prefecture is going to use his full strength.”

“I wonder how strong he is.”

All the experts looked at him with an expectant look.

Jian Wushuang shot a glance at the gloves. He remained calm, but in fact, he was a bit worried.

“Little guy, I hope you can hold on for a while, that way I can have more fun,” the Lord of Skywave Prefecture said and grinned.

“Come on.” Jian Wushuang had prepared himself.

Boom!

Then tracts of flames suddenly appeared in the air, as if the whole sky became a sea of fire.

The Lord of Skywave Prefecture looked like Flaming War God that was standing in fire. He overlooked the world with his twinkling eyes and roaring killing intent.

As he clenched his right fist, the flames directly moved toward his fist at an amazing speed. In an instant, the sea of fire completely gathered in his fist.

“Go to hell!” The Lord of Skywave Prefecture shouted.

With a single stride, he appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and immediately threw the powerful punch towards Jian Wushuang’s head.

In the blink of an eye, the sky split and the ground cracked, as if a dormant volcano had suddenly erupted after billions of years.

Jian Wushuang felt as if the furious power could burn the whole world.

“He is stronger than me in Origin of Raging Fire.”?Jian Wushuang thought with a serious look.

He knew that this punch was one and a half times stronger than the previous one.

As for their strength, even a 10 percent improvement meant a lot, but the Lord of Skywave Prefecture had improved his power by 50 percent.

If Jian Wushuang still performed the eighth move of Selfless Sword Technique, he would be defeated without a doubt.

Jian Wushuang was a bit surprised, but he did not panic. As the furious power swept towards him, his scary killing intent suddenly erupted.

The ice-cold killing intent chilled the blood of countless experts. All the spectators looked toward Jian Wushuang in awe.

The killing intent was too terrifying.

As soon as Jian Wushuang lifted the Triple-kill Sword, that was full of roaring killing intent, a towering Phantom Giant suddenly emerged. The current Phantom Giant was so condensed that it almost seemed real.

As Jian Wushuang swung his sword, the giant also wielded the Long Sword and launched an attack.

Hiss!

The stroke seemed to split the sky, leaving a huge crack behind.

All the onlookers were stunned by the terrifying stroke.

The two powerful forces collided head-on under everyone’s gaze.

Bang!

It sounded like thunder on a sunny day, pricking their ears as they covered them instinctively. Above the area, a series of crashes were heard right before their aftermath struck the ground.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

As the earth shook, more and more holes and sword scars suddenly appeared on the ground, as if the area was being destroyed.

In the center of the battlefield, the red-faced Jian Wushuang stared at his opponent and his opponent stared back.

“Slaughter Origin?” The Lord of Skywave Prefecture’s face fell as he said, “You used the scary Slaughter Sword Art. It seems that I looked down on you. You’re a bit stronger than I expected.”

“Just a bit stronger?” A hint of coldness flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. Suddenly, a strong tide of sword essence swept out and covered an area within a 100-meter radius. The Lord of Skywave Prefecture was stuck in the tide.

Then the tide of Sword Essence violently lashed against the Lord of Skywave Prefecture.
