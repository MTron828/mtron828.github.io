4928 Exiled to the Endless Sea

Without Jian Wushuang, Di Qing, and the others, the Six Heavens Realm would have been destroyed by the Yan Immortal army.

Therefore, Zhen Wuyang did not make things difficult for Di Qing.

The destruction of the Six Heavens Realm was a premeditated war. If they did not investigate it thoroughly, it would probably leave behind a source of disaster.

After pondering for a moment, Zhen Wuyang spoke again, “Which one of you killed Prince Yu?”

Jian Wushuang’s heart sank when he heard this. Just as Di Qing had said, Zhen Wuyang would get to the bottom of it.

Just as the Young Emperor was about to speak, Jian Wushuang said calmly, “I killed him.”

All the Grand Elders and Grand Yan Immortals turned their gazes to him, as if their eyes were filled with pity.

Di Qing was slightly stunned. Then, he turned to look at Jian Wushuang with various emotions flashing in his eyes.

Then, Zhen Wuyang said in a deep voice, “Then do you know what crime it is to kill a Prince?”

The Emperor’s Will pressured him. He gritted his teeth and held on, not letting himself fall. “I only know that if I don’t kill him, I will be in danger.”

The long sword was in the air and it broke through the Emperor’s pressure. The Young Emperor stood in front of Jian Wushuang and raised the long sword in his hand, pointing it at Zhen Wuyang.

“Young Emperor, put down your sword!”

All the Grand Elders and Grand Yan Immortals stepped forward to pressure the Young Emperor.

However, he was still unmoved. He raised the True Sword in his hand and pointed the tip of the sword at Zhen Wuyang without taking a step back.

“Do you dare to attack me?” Zhen Wuyang said in a deep voice. At this moment, the Emperor’s splendor shone to the extreme.

Under the Emperor’s splendor, Chen Qing and the others all grunted, and a wisp of divine blood involuntarily seeped out from the corner of their mouths.

The already weak Young Emperor retreated a few steps, and divine blood flowed out of his ears and nose.

However, he instantly stood in front of Jian Wushuang and raised his Real Sword, aiming at Zhen Wuyang again.

Then, he said in a hoarse voice, “Why wouldn’t I dare!”

A hint of disappointment flashed in Zhen Wuyang’s eyes. Then, he casually raised his hand and the Heavenly Dao pressed down.

The True Sword in the Young Emperor’s hand shattered into a hundred pieces. His body was also suppressed by the Emperor’s Heavenly Dao.

“Let go of me, Zhen Wuyang!” He roared, but there was no way for him to break free from this restraint.

Zhen Wuyang did not mind the Young Emperor calling him by his name. Instead, he looked at Jian Wushuang, “Was it really you who killed the Prince”

At this moment, a lazy voice suddenly resounded in the void. Di Qing walked to the front of the group of Yan Immortals.

“Hey, hey, look at me. To be able to kill an Imperial Prince without any fear, in the entire Great Si Region, other than me, Di Qing, I’m afraid there’s no other Yan Immortal!”

After saying this, Di Qing resolutely spread out his ten wings!

In an instant, the magnificent Yan power belonging to a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal spread out in the void.

The magnificent ten-sided wings spread out, and Di Qing’s ancestral bloodline also extended for tens of thousands of miles at this moment!

Screech!

The cry of the Golden Crow was extremely sacred and majestic.

Di Qing was taking the initiative to fight the Zhen Wuyang!

Even though he was a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, he was not even worth mentioning when facing an Emperor.

Just a wisp of Emperor fate energy was enough to easily kill any Grand Yan Immortal, including Di Qing.

If one had to describe the distance between them, it would be like a speck of dust and the bright moon. It was even more incomparable. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

However, even with such a majestic and proud Di Qing, Zhen Wuyang did not even have the slightest interest in fighting.

He looked at Di Qing with interest. “Golden Crow, you never seem to be afraid of me?”

Di Qing smiled and looked at Zhen Wuyang. “To be honest, even after you became the Emperor, I was never afraid. Even now, I’m not afraid. I was afraid that I wouldn’t be able to solve any problems, so I removed this unstable factor from my blood.”

“Are you really not afraid of me?” Zhen Wuyang narrowed his eyes.

Di Qing’s eyes narrowed slightly. “Of course.”

The atmosphere was deathly silent. This was the first time a Grand Yan Immortal dared to contradict an Emperor. To those Grand Yan Immortals, this was an extremely strange scene.

Zhen Wuyang had been fighting and killing all his life. He had killed several Emperors before developing the current Great Si Region.

However, he was not in a hurry to make a move against this guy who could be easily crushed.

“As expected, your temperament is still the same as before. As a member of the Golden Crow ancestral bloodline, it is rumored that you have nine True Lives. This is probably why you dare to confront me.”

“What if I destroy your nine True Lives right now?” Emperor Zhen Wuyang said slowly.

Di Qing’s heart tightened when he heard this. He did not expect Zhen Wuyang to know about his hidden trump card.

He only had seven True Lives left. If Zhen Wuyang was determined to punish him, he would probably die today.

Thinking of this, Di Qing gritted his teeth and did not say anything.

As for Zhen Wuyang, he did not seem to want to know Di Qing’s answer. He extended his index finger and pointed at the void.

In an instant, all of Di Qing’s plans were shattered like a mirage.

Di Qing’s mouth was dripping with divine blood, and his eyes were wide open.

Zhen Wuyang looked at him and said in a deep voice.

“Killing an Imperial Prince is a capital crime to you, but since you have other thoughts, I will spare your life.”

“But I will immediately banish you to the Endless Sea for a year!”

As soon as the Emperor’s mantra was spoken, the Heavenly Dao appeared.

Layers of chains bound Di Qing.

Di Qing’s expression changed drastically when he heard the punishment. “One Hua Year? Are you planning to let me get lost in it?! ”

However, he only left this sentence before his figure completely disappeared into the void.

Jian Wushuang stood up to chase after him, but he could not catch up with him in the end.

Exiled to the Endless Sea, these short words contained endless terror and coldness.

Back then, Chang Duoling, who had single-handedly killed the Nine Heavens, had been exiled to the Endless Sea.

However, he had used some unknown method to escape, so he was extremely cautious with his words toward the Endless Sea.

That unknown place was probably the true purgatory.

Prince Yu was grounded for a Hua Year, and Di Qing was exiled to the Endless Sea for a Hua Year.

Everything seemed to be just the beginning.

Zhen Wuyang slowly swept his gaze across the remaining Yan Immortals in the void battleground. Finally, his gaze stopped on Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang did not avoid it either. Instead, he looked at him coldly.

For some reason, when he met that pair of eyes, Zhen Wuyang felt a very familiar and strange feeling.

At the same time, it felt like they were on equal footing.

This made Zhen Wuyang feel shocked. Why would a mere Yan Immortal give him such a feeling?

An existence that did not even belong to the same realm had already made Zhen Wuyang wary at this moment.

This kind of vigilance was unprecedented for Zhen Wuyang.
