________

After an unknown period of time, Jian Wushuang finally regained consciousness.

Once he regained consciousness, he immediately understood his situation. His face suddenly changed, and his back was instantly drenched in cold sweat.

He was very clear that his previous state was completely at the mercy of others.

“What’s going on?” Jian Wushuang immediately looked around and found that he had come to a dark void where there was no light at all, even his vision was blocked.

Even so, Jian Wushuang still saw a dark figure not far in front of him.

“Who are you?” Jian Wushuang stared at the dark figure. His intuition told him that his muddleheaded state was likely caused by this dark figure.

“You are now in Blood Wave Temple, but I can easily bring you here. Who do you think I am?” The dark figure said slowly in the dark void.

“You are the master of the Blood Wave Temple?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Yes, but it’s just a consciousness.” The dark figure said.

Jian Wushuang was not surprised. He could feel that the figure in front of him did not have any life aura. It was indeed a consciousness.

“Let me introduce myself. My name is Blood Wave, and I come from the Life Palace!” The dark figure said.

“Life Palace? Is it a sect or force that specializes in comprehending the principles of life?” Jian Wushuang frowned. He had never heard of a force or sect called the Life Palace in the Divine Beginning Realm.

However, the Blood Wave Realm could not even be touched by the three Saint Realms and the three Freedom Alliances. It could even block the will of the Heavenly Dao. It was evident that the strength of the master of the Blood Wave Temple was extraordinary to be able to produce such an expert in the Life Palace, he must be extraordinary.

“Jian Wushuang, greetings, Elder Blood Wave.” Jian Wushuang immediately bowed to show his respect.

“Jian Wushuang? Aren’t you called Heavenly Sword Marquis?” Blood Wave asked playfully.

“Senior, you know my name?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Of course, I created the Blood Wave Realm. I know what happened here. Of course, my consciousness is in a deep sleep all year round. Under normal circumstances, it would not be awakened, let alone pay attention to the things in the Blood Wave Realm. But this time, I was alarmed because of you.” Blood Wave gave Jian Wushuang a deep look. “Little guy, it’s your perfect life-level that has alarmed me!”

“Perfect life-level?” Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly changed.

He was a perfect chaotic creature, which was his biggest secret. Although he had used the Heaven-cleaving skill in the Blood Wave Realm and revealed the life pressure of a perfect chaotic creature, he had never expected that...his display would alarm Blood Wave, who had been sleeping all this time?

Moreover, Blood Wave had directly seen that he had a perfect life level.

One must know that there was no specific concept of a life level in the Divine Beginning Realm. An ordinary life was an ordinary life, and a special life was a special life.

As for the word ‘perfect’, it was named by his Master Xuan Yi.

“Senior Blood Wave, how do you know the level of a perfect life-form and recognize it at a glance?” Jian wushuang asked.

“It’s simple. I’ve seen a cultivator at the level of a perfect life-form,” Blood Wave said.

“You’ve seen my master?” Jian Wushuang’s heart skipped a beat. He knew that his master was the only one who had a perfect chaotic life-form in the Divine Beginning Realm, now that Blood Wave had said that he had met a cultivator with a perfect life-level, he subconsciously thought that it was his master, so he blurted it out.

“Your master? What’s his name?” Blood Wave asked.

“His name is Xuan Yi,” Jian Wushuang answered immediately.

“Xuan Yi? I’ve never heard of him.” Blood Wave shook his head.

“How is that possible? Have you met other perfect chaotic creatures, Elder Blood Wave?” Jian Wushuang asked in surprise.

“Haha, little guy, it seems that your horizons are still a little low, but it’s normal. After all, you’re only a saint. You’re not qualified to touch the secrets of this world, let alone the secrets of the entire universe,” Blood Wave said with a smile.

“The universe? Is it the universe battlefield?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The universe battlefield? Sort of.” Blood Wave continued to smile. “Let me put it this way. A cultivator at the level of perfect life, which is a perfect chaotic creature, is very rare. In your current world, it is absolutely unique. However, if it is in the vast universe, it may not be the case. At least, I have seen other perfect chaotic creatures, and there is more than one.”

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Universe? Universe battlefield?

It was said that the universe battlefield was extremely mysterious and had unlimited possibilities.

He had always thought that the universe battlefield was just an opportunity, but now it seemed that it was not so.

In the vast universe battlefield, there seemed to be other cultivators besides the Divine Beginning Realm, and there were even other perfect chaotic creatures!

“Senior Blood Wave, is the Life Palace that you mentioned also a force in the universe battlefield?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes.” Blood Wave nodded. “The Life Palace is the most mysterious and terrifying force in the universe. It has a special feature, which is that it is only open to special life forms. In other words, only special life forms born in the universe are qualified to join the Life Palace.”

“Only special life forms are qualified to join?” Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted.

He knew very well how rare and powerful special life forms were.

In the Divine Beginning Realm, there were indeed too few special life forms. So far, Jian Wushuang had only met two special life forms. One was the Saint Devil Son, and the other was someone he had met before, Xiong Tao from the Divine Ancestor Daoist sect.

These two special life forms had a huge innate advantage.

Saint Devil Son, for example, was only ranked in the top 10 on the True Saint List due to his simple comprehension of the principles. He did not have many unique skills and secret skills, but because of the huge innate advantage of the special life forms, he could even compete with Light King, and that was why he was ranked second on the True Saint List.

Jian Wushuang thought it was terrifying to see a force that only special life forms were qualified to join, and all the experts under its command were special life forms.

“Senior Blood Wave, I’m very curious. How many people are in the Life Palace?” Jian Wushuang could not help asking.

“Many. I don’t know exactly how many, but it’s definitely beyond your imagination. In addition, I just said that only special life forms are qualified to enter the Life Palace, and I’m not talking about ordinary initial-level special life forms,” Blood Wave said.
