Chapter 1100: First Battle!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang’s urge to battle reached its peak; he had drawn the Blood Mountain Sword long ago.

On the other hand, the man in gold armor, who had dashed forward at great speed from the stone pillar, looked extremely murderous.

“You’re foolish to not have escaped after seeing me charge across!”

The man in gold armor’s gaze was extremely cold. A giant gold hammer appeared in each of his hands, each one of them billions of catties heavy.

The man struck just as he appeared before Jian Wushuang, the two giant hammers raining down upon Jian Wushuang at the same time.

They certainly did not waste any time on words. Once the man in gold armor realized that Jian Wushuang was not one of his people, he immediately struck, and with a potentially lethal blow to boot.

The Green Fire Palace had been warring with the Jin Kingdom for exactly five million years, and there were countless killings on both sides. As a result, both parties were already hell-bent on destroying each other.

“Humph!” Jian Wushuang snorted coldly.

At the same instant when the man in gold armor swung his giant hammers, Jian Wushuang had slashed angrily with the Blood Mountain Sword, boundless power in his move.

It was a swordsmanship called ‘Bladed Surge’ from his Coalescence Sword Principle.

“Bam! Bam!”

Two loud sounds from their weapons’ clash rang out, as the giant hammers smashed simultaneously into the Blood Mountain Sword. Jian Wushuang could feel the huge force of the blow and his figure shook. His arms were also a little numb from absorbing the impact of the blow.

“Burst forth!” shouted Jian Wushuang angrily.

The hidden force within the Bladed Surge formed into the second kind of power and it was also released.

“Hmm?” the man in gold armor said, as his expression changed slightly. His figure also could not help but retreat by a few steps.

“Heaven’s Bane!”

Jian Wushuang grasped his sword with both hands. He could feel vast amounts of Ancient God Power flowing into his arms, and soon the Blood Mountain Sword was giving off a huge blood-red glow. He then released the extremely powerful sword light toward his opponent.

The man in gold armor’s gaze was electrifying and he was consumed by killing intent. In an instant, he channelled the power of an advanced Celestial Master and swung one of his hammers at Jian Wushuang with matching ferocity.

The blow easily smashed through the Void, destroying everything in its path.

Both attacks were alarmingly strong and powerful, and there was a loud booming sound as they clashed. Jian Wushuang’s figure flew backward as if it had been shot from a cannon but the man in gold armor merely took a step back.

From the clash, it was pretty evident that the man in gold armor had the upper hand.

“After arriving at the Green Fire Palace, I spent a year in the Tai Qing Palace practicing my skills. I then created the Speed Sword Principle, and my strength has indeed increased, but the biggest strength of my Sword Principle is till speed. It’s not suited for power and currently, I am only on par with a common advanced Celestial Master. This expert from the Jin Kingdom’s strength, on the other hand, absolutely rivals that of a top advanced Celestial Master,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

The man was, however, looking at Jian Wushuang in amazement. He lowered his voice and said, “From your aura, you’re merely at the Eternal Realm, but you’ve possessed such great battle strength. Who are you? Why haven’t I heard of your existence amongst the experts of the Green Fire Palace?”

“My name is… Jian Wushuang!” replied Jian Wushuang coldly.

His feet began to move the instant he stopped talking.

A huge gaping hole immediately appeared in the Void below Jian Wushuang’s feet as his figure appeared phantom-like in a flash before the man in gold armor.

He then swung his sword at his opponent with a swordsmanship that was weird and hard to discern.

“This speed…” the man in gold armor said.

He was surprised as he saw Jian Wushuang’s attack drawing near; his opponent’s speed was extremely great.

The man immediately swung his giant hammers simultaneously.

Jian Wushuang, on the other hand, put on a perfect display of the speed of his swordsmanship.

“Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

As sounds of metal smashing into each other rang out, the Void around the combatants had completely collapsed. Ripple after ripple of the impact from the clash spread out with amazing speed, resulting in the ground beneath them, which was already ruined, to be damaged further; it looked even more terrible.

The man in gold armor was already striking with maximum effort, and even though each blow of his hammer carried huge power, Jian Wushuang could obviously handle the impact from their blows easily. He seemed to not be affected in the least bit and was clearly holding the upper hand in terms of speed.

“Humph, I don’t have time to fool around with you!” the man in gold armor grunted coldly.

Suddenly, his body gave off a golden glow and two coarse and thick arms appeared out from the top of his shoulders, holding similar giant gold hammers like his other two arms.

“Four arms?” asked Jian Wushuang; he could not help but be stunned. “What Secret Skill is this?”

Four giant hammers came swinging at Jian Wushuang simultaneously… All of a sudden, he was flustered.

Jian Wushuang could easily handle the attacks from two giant hammers; he even held the upper hand.

Now, however, four giant hammers were swinging at him at the same time. The tables had completely turned on him, and he was even having trouble blocking the attacks.

“Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong!”

Heavy sounds rang across the sky as the giant hammers rained down on Jian Wushuang with alarming speed. He steeled himself and evaded the first attack. In the next instant, however, a fierce gleam flashed in his eyes.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang hissed chillingly.

A sword light was formed; anyone who saw it would find it extremely beautiful and sorrowful at the same time.

As it shot out toward Jian Wushuang’s opponent, it blocked out all light from the surrounding sky. The man in gold armor could not help but stare at it as well.

As he looked at the sword light, his pupils suddenly contracted.

To his naked eye, the sword light was moving very slowly, but somehow his consciousness told him that it was coming toward him at an extremely fast speed.

Also, as the sword light was formed, a faint echo from a sword also rang out.

All of a sudden, a fearsome consciousness attack was directed at the man in gold armor.

Not only did Jian Wushuang launch the consciousness attack, but he also utilized a portion of the Killing Intent inside his Killing Bead.

He combined the consciousness attack with his Killing Intent on a direct assault on his opponent.

“What?”

The man felt his brain hurt, but luckily for him, it subsided quickly. He then lifted one of his hands, wishing to block Jian Wushuang’s physical attack with a giant hammer, but it was moving too quickly for him. As he had also been momentarily stunned by the consciousness attack, there was no way he could completely block his opponent’s sword.

At last, the sword light slashed through the raised arm. The strong tearing force ripped his armor apart and sliced off half of the arm.

The man was not flustered even after suffering the wound. His figure had retreated far away, and he turned to leave after giving Jian Wushuang a look of mixed emotions.
