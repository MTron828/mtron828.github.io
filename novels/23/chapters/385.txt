Chapter 386: Three Ultimate Stages of the Saint Realm

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Three Ultimate Stages of the Saint Realm...Stage one refers to the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm but with ordinary strength!”

“Such warriors at the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm just meet the requirements of Origin perception, and they only have mediocre manuals and techniques.”

“Like the three experts at the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm of the Luo family, they all belong to this level. In the entire Divine Land, the warriors at Stage One of the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm are most numerous.”

Lei Dao slowly narrated.

“But Stage Two is much stronger than Stage One.”

“Stage Two generally means the warriors at the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm who have reached an extremely high level of the Origin perception and have condensed their Origin Marks.”

“Origin Mark?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Like this.”

Lei Dao lifted his hand. At this moment, Jian Wushuang noticed that there was a mark like a purple thunderbolt on Lei Dao’s arm.

“I perceived the Thunderbolt Origin, so I can condense the Thunderbolt Mark.” Lei Dao continued, “After condensing your Origin Mark, your power will greatly rise when you generate Origin Energy. At the same time, the warriors at Stage Two of the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm own more powerful magic weapons, manuals, or techniques.”

“Of course, this is a normal situation. Some people who have not condensed their Origin Marks, however, still possess battle strength that can compare with that at Stage two.”

“Like you, who have not condensed an Origin Mark, but still own a very powerful physique. Your battle strength is not weaker than mine, although I have the Origin Mark.”

Jian Wushuang did not know how to react.

His body was really a great advantage.

“And what about Stage Three?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Stage Three is quite incredible. The warriors at Stage Three of the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm not only own unusual magic weapons, treasures, and techniques, but also have higher perception of the Origin. Generally, they have more than three Origin Marks at least. As for their battle strength, they are more than ten times stronger than those at Stage Two.”

“I have fought against and exchanged with experts at Stage Three more than once, but we were not at the same level.” Lei Dao smiled bitterly.

“So strong?” Jian Wushuang was surprised secretly.

“Actually, above Stage Three, there is another level which is even more incredible at the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm.” Lei Dao suddenly said.

“Oh? Stronger than Stage Three?” Jian Wushuang looked towards him immediately.

“Yes, those warriors at the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm are called ‘Heaven-defying Level’!” Lei Dao said with a sense of admiration in his eyes. “The warriors at that level of the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm are really monsters at the Saint Realm. Not only in the Iron Saber Territory, but even in the entire Divine Land, they are rare.”

“Those monsters are called at the Heaven-defying Level, not only because they own extremely high perception of the Origin. What’s more important is that they have awakened another kind of unusual power, the power of Soul!”

“Soul?” Jian Wushuang was astonished. “You mean Sword Soul, Saber Soul, etc.?”

“Yes, you know about that?” Lei Dao turned to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang replied with a faint smile. He felt very strange.

Regarding the Sword Soul, he did not only know about it. He had awakened the Sword Soul himself, and his Sword Soul was the Double First-grade Sword Soul.

“There are some experts who have awakened the Soul. Take the Sword Soul as an example. After awakening the Sword Soul, you can condense the Sword Soul Phantom, which can make your strength rise explosively, just like an expert of Stage Three. If you awaken the Sword Soul, your battle strength can dramatically rise several times with the force of the Sword soul, naturally you can be regarded as at the Heaven-defying Level.” Lei Dao said.

Jiang Wushuang agreed with Lei Dao’s words to the bottom of his heart.

Having condensed the Sword Soul Phantom, he indeed could make his strength dramatically rise with the force of the Sword Soul, which was powerful and overwhelming.

“The Heaven-defying Level is the most powerful being at the Saint Realm. Above that is the higher Cloud Realm.” Lei Dao said.

“Cloud Realm.” Jian Wushuang nodded quietly.

Above the Saint Realm is the Cloud Realm. Jian Wushuang knew this.

As for the Heavenly Creation Skill, what is after Venerable Master is Flying to the Ninth Heaven.

Flying to the Ninth Heaven corresponded to the Cloud Realm.

“What a shame! Although both of us are at the level of the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm, we are far from the Cloud Realm.” Lei Dao sighed.

What he said were the facts. It seemed that the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm was just a step away from the Cloud Realm. Actually, however, this step included a lot of twists and turns. It was never easy to break through and reach the Cloud Realm.

“I haven’t condensed the Origin Mark, but I have a strong body. Due to the power given by the Heavenly Creation Skill, I can?rival Lei Dao, who is at Stage Two. Yet, in fact, I still have many trump cards.”?Jian Wushuang thought.

Just now when they fought, Lei Dao said he had not displayed his most powerful techniques, but Jian Wushuang had reserved even more techniques.

For example, there were his Asura Secret Skill, Multifold Realm, and a lot of Sword Skills.

Moreover, he had awakened the Double First-grade Sword Soul, which he also had not displayed.

He had not used the Triple-kill Sword, which was a first-grade weapon, either.

“According to what Lei Dao said, I own the battle strength of Stage Two just with my body and the Heavenly Creation Skill. If I applied the Asura Secret Skill, the Yellow Spring Road, and the Multifold Realm to create domain suppression, I should be able to rival those experts at the top of Stage Two. If I additionally used the force of the Sword Soul, maybe...I could compete with the experts at Stage Three.”?Jian Wushuang thought secretly.

Of course, this was only based on what Lei Dao said. He had to make some guesses and judgment about his own strength. Yet, whether his current strength could really reach Stage Three could not be confirmed until he really fought a Stage Three expert.

“By the way, Swordsman, you have just arrived at the Divine Land. Have you found a place to stay?” Lei Dao suddenly turned to Jian Wushuang.

“You’re right, I haven’t.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Haha, so why don’t you go to the Lord of the territory just like me?” Lei Dao said.

“Lord of the territory? Iron Saber Lord?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Yes.” Lei Dao laughed. “The Iron Saber Lord is a top expert at the Cloud Realm. He has a good reputation in the entire Divine Land. What’s more important, he is very kind and nice, so there are a lot of experts gathered in his territory!”

“You may think the six large families, the middle families and the small families are all powerful. Actually, anyone clearly knows that the most terrifying person is the Iron Saber Lord, and his Iron Saber Army has gathered the most experts.”

“For example, in the Luo family, one of the Six Families, there are about a dozen experts of the Saint Realm, including three at the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm. It looks powerful. In fact, however, the Luo family is nothing in front of the Iron Saber Army, who can randomly send a few warriors to easily destroy the Luo family.”

“There are a lot of experts in the Iron Saber Territory, but frankly speaking, more than ninety percent of the top experts in the territory have been gathered in the Iron Saber Army. And that is where an expert like you should stay.”
