Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Zi Dongwang’s face changed.

The intense battle between him and Jian Wushuang earlier was actually too close to call. However, due to the difference in their defensive powers, he was injured but Jian Wushuang was totally fine. It was something he couldn’t accept.

“Previously, the white-robed swordsman. Now, Jian Wushuang?”

“No, no!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“There’s already God Destroying King above me. I definitely can’t stand a second person above me, let alone a third!”

“Jian Wushuang, you have to die!”

There was an unprecedented insanity twinkling in Zi Dongwang’s eyes. The moment he roared, hong! A boundless purple divine light flowed out from Zi Dongwang. He clasped his hands together and fathomless divine power flowed into his palms.

A terrifying power slowly condensed in his hands.

“Want to go all out now?” Jian Wushuang concentrated.

He could tell that the next move that Zi Dongwang was going to take wouldn’t be insignificant.

If not mistaken, it should be Zi Dongwang’s stongest unique skill.

“Unique skill!” Jian Wushuang shook his head in silence.

He knew that Zi Dongwang was going to perform his strongest unique skill but Jian Wushuang couldn’t give play to a matching sword principle to fight evenly.

In terms of unique skill, he was really at an absolute disadvantage.

No choice. He was only a Universe God in the Second Heaven after all. Even if he were to have the ability to create a unique skill of a higher level, he still couldn’t create one.

He couldn’t match evenly with his sword principle, but Jian Wushuang had another technique.

Rumble. There was boundless divine power flowing in Jian Wushuang’s body along with the Ancient God power that he possessed.

At that very moment, they were all flowing into his right index finger intensely.

His index finger gave out an intense golden light and a bolt of earth-shattering power continued to accumulate.

After a good while, Jian Wushuang and Zi Dongwang were done preparing to launch their moves.

“Jian Wushuang!!!”

Zi Dongwang let out a roar and his voice soared to the Ninth Heaven.

“Come on!” Jian Wushuang let out a chilly glare.

The next moment, both of them launched attacks at one another at the same time.

Hong!

A towering hand that was formed by purple divine power appeared in the universe. The huge purple hand almost formed a substantiated purple crystal and covered the vast void. It slowly patted and the space it passed constantly made explosive sounds. In the end, it shattered like a pane of glass.

Before the huge purple hand, there was an ancient hand that extended. The ancient hand was dark gold and an enormous amount of divine power concentrated in one huge finger in the end. The finger in dark gold poked through the void.

Zi Dongwang’s strongest unique skill.

Jian Wushuang also went all out to perform his strongest attack technique, Ancient God Fourth Finger!

The power of both techniques shook heaven and earth.

Suddenly, they collided head on.

At the beginning, there wasn’t any vigorous noise, only two bolts of boundless divine power constantly compressing and clashing, as though there were two worlds constantly melting.

But the melting only lasted for a short while.

Vroom. A shapeless shockwave suddenly soared up from the middle where the two bolts of power collided. Then, it swept out with no mercy.

Within the one-hundred mile range, Xin Zhu was still standing there as he manipulated the three headless warriors to fight against the three demonic dragons.

However, even with him manipulating the three headless warriors personally, they were only evenly matched with the three demonic dragons.

Then, the shockwave swept out and glided against the three headless warriors and three demonic dragons like breaking dead wood.

In silence, the three headless warriors and the three demonic dragons dispersed straightaway.

One should know that the three headless warriors and three demonic dragons possessed the fighting powers of an ordinary Real God. They were merely hit by the shockwave caused by the collision of the two bolts of power and they disappeared.

“It is that strong?”

Xin Zhu, who was swept by the shockwave, was then gawking with his eyes wide-open.

In the divine power storm that was formed by the two bolts of power.

Wow!

A sharp swordlight forcefully tore all the obstacles before him. Jian Wushuang’s figure directly pierced the divine power storm and appeared before Zi Dongwang.

“Zi Dongwang, take this!” There was a chilly gleam in Jian Wushuang’s eyes and there was suddenly a black longspear that gave out unique aura in his hands.

As his Soul Power flowed and covered the black longspear, it instantly turned into a bunch of black lights and suddenly shot out.

The longspear didn’t look very powerful but in actual fact, the longspear contained the strongest Soul Attack that Jian Wushuang had performed with his all. The second stage of the secret skill of Tian Yuan… Inextinguishable Light!

The inextinguishable light with the support of divine spear was a divine power that was terrifying.

Suddenly, the bunch of black light came before Zi Dongwang.

“Humph!”

Zi Dongwang harrumphed coldly and slapped. The black longspear was immediately slapped away.

However, the Soul Attack contained in the black longspear wasn’t hindered but immersed itself into Zi Dongwang’s body like lightning.

A terrifying Soul Power suddenly descended!

“It’s a consciousness attack!” Zi Dongwang instantly alerted and immediately started a consciousness defense.

However, the consciousness attack was like a sharp blade and forcefully tore his consciousness defense apart. In the end, it hit his consciousness without scruples.

“Ahhh!!!!”

A shrill roar was heard from Zi Dongwang. Zi Dongwang couldn’t stand the sharp pain in his consciousness and he immediately knelt down. His face was flushed red and distorted in agony.

The moment where Zi Dongwang drown in acute pain, Jian Wushuang appeared before him and his Blood Mountain Sword showed no mercy but turned into a crimson streak of lightning and slammed down at Zi Dongwang’s head.

The acute pain in Zi Dongwang’s consciousness had yet to subside and he couldn’t withstand the stroke but the armor on his body covered his entire body.

Clang!

Blood Mountain Sword slashed at Zi Dongwang’s head and a fierce divine power exploded. Even though Zi Dongwang’s head didn’t break apart because of the protection of his armor, the fierce power spread into Zi Dongwang’s body through the armor. Then, it hit the internal organs of his body insanely.

“Poof!”

Zi Dongwang spat a mouthful of fresh blood and his face instantly grew pale. He was dispirited by half and his body started falling down after the hit.

However, Zi Dongwang’s body had yet to fall on the ground but it suddenly stopped. His bloodshot eyes stared at Jian Wushuang and there was fear in his eyes.

“So scary. Such a terrifying consciousness attack!”

“Compared to Xin Zhu’s Nine Weight Destruction, it was much stronger.”

“A consciousness attack like this… I can’t block it. I definitely can’t block it!”

“Run, run!!!”
