Chapter 1319: Nine Sacred Thunders And Three Tests All At Once!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Boom!!!

The ninth Sacred Thunder, which had drawn every one’s attention, finally stopped simmering.

The last Sacred Thunder could determine whether Jian Wushuang could survive.

It gradually revealed its formidable force.

At that moment, the dark clouds separated from each other, from which two flashes of dazzling light

One flash of light was endlessly dark and the other, deep green.

“Two Sacred Thunders?”

These two flashes of light staggered all of the talents who were watching.

They knew there were two Sacred Thunders.

And the endless dark one was the most powerful Dark Sacred Thunder, and carried an annihilatory power.

And the deep green one was an entire Fire Test Sacred Thunder. A deep green Fire Test!

“They arrive at the same time?”

Astonishing!

Everyone was speechless.

Generally speaking, three kinds of God Test came separately.

Occasionally, the Thunder Test came with a trace of fire, only a small trace.

But now, an entire Dark Sacred Thunder and a Fire Test Sacred Thunder came simultaneously!

Worse still, Jian Wushuang felt a sense of anxiety.

The anxiety came without a sign.

Actually, he had been able to stay calm in any dangerous situation after he had tackled so many challenges.

Even at the brink of death, he had always been calm without even a trace of anxiety.

But now…He was upset, and this irritability intensified, directly affecting his emotions and even his control of his own power!

At this moment, Jian Wushuang found it extremely difficult to control his own Spiritual Power!

“Shit!”

He bit his lips violently, causing a great pain that made his mind clearer.

However, his face became completely distorted and horrible. The eyes were also full of unprecedented aggression and madness.

A dark fog containing a mysterious power rose slowly rose in his body, triggering his irritation and conquering him.

Bystanders outside the Tribulation Passing Pinnacle didn’t know what was happening.

“What is he doing?”

“What on Earth is going on?”

“What is happening?

Many practitioners who were watching felt confused.

Only a few distinguished Gods, including the Master of Dayu Palace and Lord Wu Cang, knew what happened. They were shocked!

“It’s a Mind Test!”

“Really?”

Even Master of the Dayu Palace, the supreme God in the Dayu Universe, felt amazed and exclaimed,

“A Mind Test!”

Everyone was shocked when they knew what was exactly happening.

It was true. A Mind Test.

The most difficult one among the three kinds of God Tests, and also the one that had been rarely seen.

It was said that only a vicious sinner taking numerous lives would meet with the Mind Test, with a certain yet low possibility.

Within the long history of the Dayu Universe, the Mind Test had never happeneded at all.

That was why Master of the Dayu Palace didn’t know much about it and had only mentioned a little information in classes.

And now, Jian Wushuang was receiving the Mind Test?

Furthermore, it came with the Thunder Test and the Fire Test!

Three kinds of test came to the same person at the same time!

“How can it be possible”

“This is impossible!!!”

The usually indifferent and calm Lord Wu Cang couldn’t help crying out.

“Why is only the first part of the God Test already so catastrophic?”

“I have never heard about this!”

“Under normal circumstances, no matter how a cultivator is genius or vicious, he will never meet with such horrible test…”

“Unless…”

Lord Wu Cang figured out one possibility.

More specifically, he was reminded of a legend.

“Unless Jian Wushuang is undergoing the so-called Inverse Cultivation Test.” Lord Wu Cang felt staggered.

“Inverse Cultivation Test?” Master of the Dayu Palace couldn’t believe what he heard.

Inverse Cultivation Test?

The most horrible God Test in the Eternal Chaotic World!

Also the most unique one.

And the God Test for Universe Gods was the most deadly in the Inverse Cultivation Test.

Even though Master of the Dayu Palace and Lord Wu Cang were experienced, they had just heard of Inverse Cultivation but never seen it, let alone the Inverse Cultivation Test.

And now they realized that Jian Wushuang was receiving the Inverse Cultivation Test.

Only this could explained why the undergoing test was so horrible.

“Jian Wushuang was practicing Inverse Cultivation!”

Master of the Dayu Palace and Lord Wu Cang clenched their hands excitedly.

They were now sure of who Jian Wushuang was.

Now on the peak of the Tribulation Passing Pinnacle, the dark fog had already covered the whole body of Jian Wushuang, whose breath was getting more and more violent.

“Ooooooh!”

He roared with a distorted face.

He roared, with an unprecedented determination.

He didn’t want to lose!

He didn’t want to end his cultivation journey right now!

He didn’t want to die!

After all, there were still many things for him to accomplish.

He haven’t met Shuang Er. He haven’t known who his master was. He could NOT die!!!!!!
