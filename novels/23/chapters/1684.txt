Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Jian Wushuang!!”

Real God Duan Yan and Real God Huan Yu saw Jian Wushuang’s action and they were shocked.

Especially Real God Huan Yu, it wasn’t easy for her to perform Sea of Heart Region and Whirling World at the same time.

As for the ten top Chaotic Real Gods from Soaring Heaven King Palace, they were first astonished. Then, they laughed.

“Jian Wushuang is courting death!”

“If the ten of us team up, even if he really has the fighting power of one on Real God ranking list, he will only be suppressed!”

“As he wants to die, I shall grant him his wish!”

“Die!”

The ten Real Gods had murderous intention billowing and their cold gazes were fixed upon Jian Wushuang.

The following scene made the ten Real Gods starred with their eyes wide open.

Jian Wushuang appeared in front of them and pointed with his right index finger!

Rumble. There was boundless divine power gathering. Instantly, there was a huge hand that seemed to appear from ancient times.

The huge index finger pointed with a layer of dim light as though it contained a complete Reincarnation Doctrine.

Ancient God’s fifth finger… Get Through Difficulty Finger!

The huge finger pressed over and the ten Real Gods stunned.

Not only them, but also Real Gods Duan Yan and Real God Huan Yu afar, including the experts hidden in the nearby void, were all dumbfounded.

Too powerful. The power contained in the finger was too powerful!

It was so powerful that it exceeded the top Chaotic Real God level. Even on the Real God ranking list, there were definitely very few who could perform an attack of such a level.

The strength of the one finger had yet to explode entirely. Merely an attack could make all ten Real Gods from Soaring Heaven King Palace feel like their scalps were tearing.

“Power, how could it be so powerful?” Real God Duan Yan muttered.

He didn’t know that Jian Wushuang’s divine power was at the level of an Almighty’s. He performed Ancient God’s fifth finger with his divine power of an Almighty level!

How could it not be powerful?

“Hurry up. Don’t just stand there. Work together to block this finger!” A raging voice suddenly rang from the ten Real Gods.

The ten Real Gods immediately came back to reality and took action one after another.

As top Chaotic Real God, they were all experts in each corner of Eternal Chaotic World. However, the ten Chaotic Real Gods took action simultaneously and performed their killer tactics, just to block the huge finger that was attacking them!

However, even though the ten of them had joined forces, the outcome was…

Bang!

There was a ferocious noise that shook heaven and earth.

The spacetime exploded entirely.

At the same time as the spacetime exploded!

“Poof! Poof! Poof! Poof! Poof!”

The ten Real Gods spurted out a mouthful of blood and ten figures flew back from the impact.

He fought against ten alone head-on but in the end, the ten Real Gods were defeated!

Just as the ten Real Gods flew back from the impact, Blood Mountain Sword appeared in Jian Wushuang’s hand and there was suddenly a terrifying sword intention and murderous intention

Swoosh!

With boundless shadows, Jian Wushuang’s figure appeared before a top Chaotic Real God who was closest to him.

Then, Blood Mountain Sword in his hand was swung out mercilessly!

The sword was swung like a bolt of lightning that contained fierce divine power that an Almighty had, and also with the Power of Reincarnation.

“Be careful!” There was someone who shouted a reminder in time from the side.

The brawny man in red armor was shocked. He immediately wielded the saber in his hand and slashed. He wanted to block Jian Wushuang’s stroke.

Dang!

There was a low thud and the saber in the brawny man’s hand flew out. The cold swordlight pierced the brawny man’s head. After it killed the brawny man, the cold swordlight didn’t grow weaker but continued to slash at the black-haired graceful lady behind.

“What?” The black-haired graceful lady never thought that the sword light would continue to swing at her. Hence, she couldn’t dodge in time.

Psst!

The swordlight pierced the black-haired graceful lady’s body and dispersed gradually.

The sight shocked everyone on the spot.

It was a fierce finger earlier that suppressed ten Real Gods head-on. Then, it was a close sword stroke, a casual stroke that killed two top Chaotic Real Gods directly!

What kind of fighting power was that?

Kuang!

The figure moved in a ghostly fashion again. It brought along boundless shadows and appeared behind a black-haired brawny elder.

The same stroke with fierce divine power, merely suppressing one with force. Although the black-haired brawny man withstood it with his all, he was killed by Jian Wushuang with one stroke.

Kuang! Kuang! Kuang!

His ghostly figure continued to move and he continued to swing out swordlights. Every stroke contained murderous intention.

Psst! Psst! Psst!

The figures were slashed or pierced one after another at an unbelievable speed.

In an instant, less than a breath’s time, the entire void resumed tranquility.

In the dark void, Jian Wushuang stood there coldly and slowly put Blood Mountain Sword in its scabbard. Surrounding him were nine floating cold dead bodies.

Although they were dead, there was fierce divine power left in the bodies, which was the reason their bodies didn’t fall below instantly. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Jian Wushuang lifted his head to look in one direction. At the end of his sight, there was a black-robed old lady. The black-robed old lady was Real God Ling Xie from Soaring Heaven King Palace.

“You are quite lucky,” Jian Wushuang broke into a smile.

The smile looked just like a demon’s smile in Real God Ling Xie’s eyes.

She saw the nine cold dead bodies floating around Jian Wushuang. There was astonishment and unprecedented glee in her eyes.

She should be glad, glad that she was lucky and fast enough in her response that she could escape in time.

Otherwise, she definitely would be one of the dead bodies.

In the nearby void, the experts hidden in the dark became quiet.

Everyone was looking at Jian Wushuang, who was standing right in the middle of the void.

With his power alone, he matched evenly with ten top Chaotic Real Gods. Among them, there were two peak experts who were extremely close to Real God ranking list. But in the end, in an instant, less than a breath’s time, nine out of the ten Real Gods were massacred!

There was only Real God Ling Xie, who survived through sheer luck.

Astonishing, shocking!

Everyone found it unbelievable.

One should know just how great a formation it was with ten top Chaotic Real Gods joining forces. Even if it were expert on Real God ranking list, those who were on higher ranking, they should be able to match evenly. However, they were fighting against Jian Wushuang and they were massacred directly.

Plus, the speed of massacre was extremely fast!

“Jian, Jian Wushuang.”

Real God Duan Yan and Real God Huan Yu appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and the two of them were astonished.

Jian Wushuang flashed a smile at the two of them, “I wanted to tell you earlier that, actually… we don’t have to flee!”
