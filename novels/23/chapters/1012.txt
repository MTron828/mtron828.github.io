Chapter 1013: Death Shadow

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“What?” Jian Wushuang asked, unable to hold back his surprise.

As an advanced population, the Rock Demon Clan included not a few experts. Generally, the Elders of the clan were Dao Master experts.

Four Elders had fallen. It meant that four Dao Masters had fallen. There were just ten Dao Masters in the whole Rock Demon Clan.

“Even more, Brother Hong was beaten up by them.” Qing Bin said urgently, “I don’t know how the Black Python Clan called in an expert. He suddenly showed up and severely injured Brother Hong during the head-on fight between Brother Hong and the Leader of the Black Python Clan. If it were not for Brother Hong’s incredible skill in defense, he would probably have got killed.”

“Even God Hong got severely injured?” Jian Wushuang said, squinting slightly.

Including God Hong, there were just ten Dao Masters in total in the Rock Demon Clan. Now four of them had fallen at a time and even God Hong got severely injured, making the battle strength of the high-level leaders of the Rock Demon Clan sank to a low level. Not surprisingly, the experts of the Black Python Clan dared to directly intrude into the city of the Rock Demon Clan.

“Master Wushuang, Brother Hong told me to ask you to leave immediately.” Qing Bin said, “After all, you don’t belong here. You are not supposed to engage in the collision between our Rock Demon Clan and the Black Python Clan. So just get out of here.”

“No need to leave immediately.”

Jian Wushuang shook his head while gazing at the eight Dao Masters of the Black Python Clan in the distance. He could sense the monstrous killing intent from them. He said, “The Black Python Clan have fought with the Rock Demon Clan for so many years. They finally got such a great opportunity, so they won’t give you a break. Not surprisingly, the Black Python Clan must have sent out all the experts today.”

“The Rock Demon Clan is in danger!”

“Jian Wushuang, what do you intend to do?” He heard Gu King’s voice.

“I’m indebted to God Hong. Besides, during these years, I got a lot of help from the Rock Demon Clan. They did me such a great favor, so I should do something for them in return.” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“You want to help them?” Gu King said apathetically.

“You tell me.” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile, while Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand.

“Master Wushuang, what are you doing?” Qing Bin stared at Jian Wushuang with amazement and said.

“Qing Bin, just stand here and watch.” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile, then flying forward.

Jian Wushuang flew across the Void with ease like a Ghost and soon got to the battlefield ahead.

At this moment, the two populations were in an intense battle.

Led by the eight Dao Masters, numerous experts of the Black Python Clan had directly intruded into the city of the Rock Demon Clan.

Numerous clansmen of the Rock Demon Clan struggled to fight back. However, the battle strength of the high-level leaders of the Rock Demon Clan was considerably inferior to that of the Black Python Clan.

Although the left Dao Masters of the Rock Demon Clan joined the fight, they were soon beaten back by the eight Dao Masters of the Black Python Clan.

No one could stop the eight Dao Masters of the Black Python Clan.

“Haha, kill, kill them all!”

“Our Black Python Clan is the unchallenged leader of this territory from today.”

“The Rock Demon Clan, after all these years of fight, today is the extermination day of your clan!”

Angry roars and loud laughs reverberated between heaven and earth.

Led by the eight Dao Masters, the experts of the Black Python Clan killed wantonly in the territory of the Rock Demon Clan. Meanwhile, the Rock Demon Clan was barely capable of fighting back.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang showed up in the midmost battlefield like a Ghost as well as in front of the eight Dao Masters of the Black Python Clan.

“Hmm?”

All the eight Dao Masters saw, but they didn’t pay much attention.

“Where does the brat come from? Get the hell out of here.”

A bald man waved his robe, and instantly there came a blast of power which formed a sharp sword shadow. It came towards Jian Wushuang’s head.

Jian Wushuang stood there indifferently with the corners of his mouth lifted to a special arc and his eyes fixed on Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

“I’ve just created this swordsmanship and never displayed it in the presence of anyone. Today I should try its power on you eight Dao Masters…” Jian Wushuang murmured. Without any big movement, he just waved his sword casually.

It was just a casual swipe which looked like a child’s swipe.

However, just as he waved Blood Mountain Sword, a burst of horrified Sword Essence exploded at the moment.

A sharp sword shadow was unleashed directly.

Fast, it was so fast!

It was definitely several times faster than any swordsmanships that Jian Wushuang had displayed before.

At first, the eight Dao Masters in front of Jian Wushuang didn’t take Jian Wushuang seriously, because he was just at Eternal Realm level. But when they saw this sharp sword shadow unleashed, they showed a trace of astonishment in their eyes.

While they saw the sword shadow, a strange power directly overwhelmed them. At this moment, as their consciousness fell into a temporary pause, they were dumbfounded like a fool.

Swish!

After a low hum, peace was restored and the sharp sword shadow had vanished. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Jian Wushuang stood in the Void, slowly returning Blood Mountain Sword to the sheath.

Watching the eight Dao Masters standing there still, he said with a faint smile, “I should thank Master Ku for inspiring me so that I could create this swordsmanship.”

Master Ku was one of the 18 masters of the Void Temple.

Jian Wushuang used to have a fight with Master Ku outside of the imperial city of Tang of the East. Jian Wushuang still vividly remembered Master Ku’s most powerful move.

The move was stunning and incredibly fast.

The most important thing was that the move contained consciousness attack as well.

The Saber Technique and consciousness attack combined perfectly!

The move shocked Jian Wushuang so much that it constantly crossed his mind when he tried to create a matching swordsmanship for Aurora Sword Principle during the past years. Thus, he intended to combined consciousness attack with his swordsmanship perfectly.

After all, he was rather adept in consciousness attack.

Through several years of study, he finally created this swordsmanship that had the speed of the Aurora Sword Principle and the consciousness attack.

This move was incredibly fast. Meanwhile, the consciousness attack included in the swordsmanship was perfectly displayed after being greatly improved by the swordsmanship. It was even much more powerful than Mind-controlling Secret Skill displayed by Jian Wushuang with all his strength.

What was more, Mind-controlling Secret Skill needed to be displayed by Jian Wushuang in a painstaking and complicated way. The sweeping consciousness attack could be easily noticed. Nevertheless, the consciousness attack included in the swordsmanship really came quietly without a sign, which created this extremely weird but incredibly fast move.

“This move is named Death Shadow.” Jian Wushuang murmured.

As he finished his words, the eight Dao Masters who hovered in the Void ahead of him fell feebly one after another.

Eight figures fell at the same time!

This scene made the whole battlefield fall silent.
