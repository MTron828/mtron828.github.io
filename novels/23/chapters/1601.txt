Chapter 1602: Thunderbolt Island

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Thunderbolt Island is Sanctuary Alliance’s lair. There are many opportunities and cultivation places. To us, Eternal Real Gods, these are all of great use. The experts from each force in the ten sanctuaries would like to cultivate in Thunderbolt Island too. Similarly, it is restricted too. Sanctuary Alliance set a rule that Eternal Real Gods under the control of the great forces get a chance to head to Thunderbolt Island for cultivation every one hundred years and the cultivation period can last for three thousand years each time,” Real God Wu Liang said.

“There’s such a rule?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

“No choice. After all, forces in the ten sanctuaries, including many solo experts, all the Eternal Real Gods are members of Sanctuary Alliance. The total number of all Eternal Real Gods is large while the resources on Thunderbolt Island is limited. Hence, there must be rules. Otherwise, all Eternal Real Gods would stay on Thunderbolt Island all year round. The resources on Thunderbolt Island would have been exhausted long ago.” Real God Wu Liang said.

“True,” Jian Wushuang smiled and nodded in agreement. But his face suddenly changed, “In other words, I can only stay on Thunderbolt Island for three thousand years?”

“Yes, that’s why Hall Master Yuan told you to seize your chance. If you were to waste this opportunity, you would have to wait another one hundred thousand years to visit Thunderbolt Island again,” Real God Wu Liang said, “Of course, if you were to achieve one condition, you would receive the right to stay on Thunderbolt Island permanently.”

“What condition?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Pass the fifth level of Doctrine Palace!” Real God Wu Liang said.

“Er…” Jian Wushuang was shocked at first, then gave a bitter smile.

The fifth level of Doctrine Palace?

One should know that he only possessed the standard to pass the second level of Doctrine Palace. He was still far away from the third level, let alone the fifth level.

“Many Chaotic Real Gods have yet to reach the fifth level of Doctrine Palace, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, normally, a Chaotic Real God’s standard is to pass the fourth level of Doctrine Palace. As for the fifth level, only extremely strong Chaotic Real Gods on the top would be able to pass through that level. Also, only they would get the right to stay on Thunderbolt Island forever,” Real God Wu Liang said.

Jian Wushuang understood too.

Those who had passed through the first level would be the top Void Real Gods.

Those who passed through the second level would be ordinary Eternal Real Gods.

The third level would be considered the top Eternal Real Gods. For instance, Real God Wu Liang, Real God Dan Ding, Real God Ming Xin were on this level.

The fourth level would be the standard of an ordinary Chaotic Real God.

The fifth level would be the top of Chaotic Real Gods. Real God Long Qing who went to Blood Demon Church to catch Lord Leng alive with Jian Wushuang back then was barely at that level.

The sixth level would be the standard of an expert on Real God ranking list.

The seventh level… to enter the seventh level from the sixth level, there was a huge threshold. One who reached this level would have reached the standard of an Almighty in terms of comprehension towards Heaven Way.

Many Almighties were on this level. Also, there were a few monsters listed in the top few on Real God ranking list who were also at this level.

“The fifth level of Doctrine Palace is too far away from me,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Who’s not?” Real God Wu Liang shook his head too, “There are many Real Gods in Lineage of Star and there are some who are Chaotic Real Gods. However, those who could stay on Thunderbolt Island all year round, including Lei Chao, there are only eight of them.”

“Eight?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Even such a great force like Lineage of Star only had six people who had reached the criteria. The total number of experts from all forces in the ten sanctuaries who reached the criteria was probably not many.

Of course, that was if the Almighties were excluded.

The Almighties definitely had the right to stay on Thunderbolt Island permanently.

Jian Wushuang and Real God Wu Liang chatted casually as they hurried their journey. Very soon, they arrived at Cloud Island.

There were many wormholes on Cloud Island. Among the wormholes, there was one that connected directly to Thunderbolt Island. It was just that there were not many that activated it normally.

With a wormhole, Jian Wushuang and Real God Wu Liang stepped foot on Thunderbolt Island very quickly.

…

“This is the lair of Sanctuary Alliance, Thunderbolt Island?”

Jian Wushuang looked around and there was a giant floating island.

The island was extremely huge and boundless. On the island, there were tall mountains that could be seen faintly. There were also palaces and pavilions that were floating in the void.

Jian Wushuang was at the border of the island while there was a faint green light lid behind him. The green light lid covered the entire island and there was green lightning flashing in the lid faintly as though it was going to swallow the world.

The randomly flashing green lightning gave Jian Wushuang a chill after just one glance.

He could tell that if a bolt of slight green lightning were to strike him, it would shatter him into pieces and he would be doomed forever.

Just then, Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly changed.

“This is…?” Jian Wushuang looked at his palm. He gripped his fist, then he creased his eyebrows.

“Why? Do you feel your divine power weakening?” Real God Wu Liang looked at him.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Although he was only a Universe God, as an inverse cultivator, his explosion of divine power could be compared to the top Void Real God favorably. It was maybe even not much weaker than an Eternal Real God. However, he could clearly feel that his divine power was only at the level of an ordinary Real God.

“It’s very normal. Every expert who comes to Thunderbolt Island, including Almighties, have their divine power restricted!”

“Real Gods like us, regardless if we are Void Real Gods, Eternal Real Gods or Chaotic Real Gods, our divine power would only maintain at the level of an ordinary Void Real God when we are here. As for Almighties, their divine power would maintain the level of an ordinary Almighty’s level,” Real God Wu Liang explained.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang understood.

As everyone’s divine power was restricted, he naturally found it acceptable.

Plus, to him, it was good news.

After all, his divine power should be bottom of the people on Thunderbolt Island. But then as their divine power was equal, when they fight against one another to learn from each other, they were only competing for their comprehension of Heaven Way and also unique skill and secret skill. The vast difference in terms of divine power wouldn’t exist.

“Follow me,” Real God Wu Liang brought Jian Wushuang to the middle of the island.

As they plunged forward, he briefed Jian Wushuang about the fundamental of Thunderbolt Island.

“Jian Wushuang, listen up. On Thunderbolt Island, you must remember one thing. They prohibit fighting and killing without permission.”

“After all, Sanctuary Alliance gathered countless sects within Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, including many solo experts. Between these forces and experts, there were many that harbored hatred against one another. But regardless of your resentment, no one can launch an attack on Thunderbolt Island. If the hatred can’t be resolved, there will be a Fighting Space designated for battle on Thunderbolt Island and also and Life and Death Space. They can head over there to resolve it.
