Chapter 695: Demon God Clan

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

On the way to the Eternal Zone, Vice Palace Master Ling Yu traveled side by side with the six disciples. “Since the six of you haven’t been there before, you must have no idea of what kind of place it is. But don’t worry, I’ll tell you,” she said to them.

The six of them immediately gave their full attention to her.

They knew nothing about the Eternal Zone except that it was a dangerous place.

The master started to describe the place to them.

“The first thing you should know about it is that it’s totally different from the Firmament Territory.

“A very special and indigenous species lives there, which is called the Demon God Clan.”

“The Demon God Clan?” Those six seemed surprised when hearing that name for the first time.

Judging by the clan’s name, they could tell it had to be an unusual group.

“In fact, the members of this clan are normal human beings at birth; however, as they grow older, they get baptized by Demon Gods and then become one of them as well. Their power also rockets to a new level.

“Following that is a huge change to their bodies.

“After becoming Demon Gods, they get divided into three groups based on the density of their blood—Copper-armored Demon Gods, Silver-armored Demon Gods, and Gold-armored Demon Gods. The first one is the weakest kind, and the last one is the most powerful.

“All of you should know that both our opportunities and nightmares are hidden inside them.”

The master paused for a while before continuing, “Those opportunities mean the following three things exactly:

“First—the Essence Blood of the Demon Gods.

“After you kill one Demon God, you can refine his body into pure Essence Blood, but the amount you can extract from the three kinds of bodies is not the same.

“For example, a Copper-armored Demon God’s body can be refined into only one single drop of Essence Blood. That will be two drops in the case of a Silver-armored Demon God’s body, and three drops for a Gold-armored Demon God’s body.

“You may want to ask me what kind of use we can make of that Essence Blood. I’ll answer that later. Let’s move on to the second opportunity.

“Second—the Ancient Gods’ Secret Skill.”

The words caused the six disciples to raise their heads in amazement.

“Created by the Demon God Clan, this skill can greatly increase the user’s offensive power in a short time. Aside from Jian Wushuang, the rest of you have all practiced some similar secret skills, right?”

Feng, Liu Chong, Situ Yi, Luo Yong, and Dong’er all nodded.

Though Jian Wushuang had not practiced any secret skill yet, he did know what the master was talking about.

Back when he was carrying out the Earth-level Task, all his targets at that time had practiced those kinds of skills.

Bing Ji, one of those targets, had demonstrated an offensive power that was five times stronger than it had been before by displaying the skill while fighting him.

Hu Hu had even managed to increase it to eight times stronger.

Therefore, this kind of secret skill was somehow very common among the Divine Realm experts. The only difference was how much one could improve his power by using the skill.

Talented as Jian Wushuang was, he still could not study the skill until he reached the Divine Realm.

“There are various kinds of secret skills in our sect and other sects, you know.” The master continued, “And no matter whether they are at higher or lower levels, they can improve one’s power by 10 times at best.

“The same is also true of those skills that the three magnates and top sects have. 10 times is the limitation.

“But different from all those skills, the secret skill that the Demon God Clan possesses can break that limitation.”

“What?”

The six of them could not help being astonished at those words, especially the five who had learned some secret skills.

They had long believed that secret skills could only improve their power by no more than 10 times.

“It indeed is true that their secret skill can produce such a magical effect. As far as I know, the first five levels of the skill can increase one’s power by 15 times.”

The master’s words caused Jian Wushuang’s pupils to suddenly shrink.?“15 times!”?he exclaimed to himself.

“If what the master said is true, this secret skill is indeed invaluable.”

He felt thrilled at the idea of releasing a power 10 times greater than a normal warrior could when fighting an opponent in the same realm. It would be really amazing.

“If I can study and practice this skill, I’ll be much more powerful and can gain an advantage over my opponents.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“All the experts in our territory want to get this skill and hope that they can practice it to a high level after getting it. However, the Demon God Clan has kept it away from others quite well, aside from Cloud Sea Asgard obtaining the first five levels of it while the other two magnates and our sect have gotten the first four levels.

“But still, the first four levels can increase one’s power by 12 times.” The master’s voice echoed again.

On hearing this, all six of them let out gasps in admiration.
