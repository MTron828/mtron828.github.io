Chapter 1899: Show The White Feather

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Universe Galaxy was a treasure that Master of Star Palace had obtained from Seven Star Realm.

Although Universe Galaxy was severely injured, it was an ancient treasure after all.

Hall Master, who was weapon’s spirit of Universe Galaxy, immediately started to revolve Universe Galaxy when he received Jian Wushuang’s message.

Although the humongous Universe Galaxy gave people a mysterious feeling, it never once revealed its true power.

But then, as Hall Master revolved it, Universe Galaxy immediately transformed into a huge formation.

The formation was mysterious and instantly cut off the chase of the experts from Star Extermination Alliance. They were blocked outside of the galaxy.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang and the others appeared in the depths of Universe Galaxy, next to Hall Master Yuan.

Jian Wushuang’s soul power spread out and he could see the scene outside of the galaxy.

He could see that the experts from Star Extermination Alliance outside Universe Galaxy had already started to attack the formation of Universe Galaxy.

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong!

There were deep, loud bangs that resounded continuously. As the entire Universe Galaxy was under attack, it started shaking faintly.

“Hall Master Yuan, can you withstand the attack?” Jian Wushuang looked at Hall Master Yuan.

“Palace Master, don’t worry. Attacking at such a level is merely scratching my itch,” Hall Master Yuan joked confidently.

Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows and said, “The experts from Star Extermination Alliance are merely attacking in scatter. Universe Galaxy could withstand them easily. But if they were to concentrate their attacks together, such as all Almighties attacking one spot, then…”

“Palace Master, just sit and watch me,” Hall Master Yuan was very confident.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He naturally had never doubted Hall Master Yuan.

At the border of Universe Galaxy, the experts from Star Extermination Alliance had originally wanted to barge into the depths of the galaxy and go right into the lair of Lineage of Star. However, just as they stepped foot into Universe Galaxy, they were blocked by the huge formation that was revolving.

“This formation is so powerful. I attacked personally but I didn’t even shake it?!” Palace Master Wu Luo creased his eyebrows slightly.

“Lineage of Star existed for so many years and the old monster old Star Palace even had the Secret Skill of Star Palace. Of course, he would have some solid foundation. The formation should be their last reliance,” the Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church said.

“Humph, you want to rely on the formation to block all of us outside? You must be dreaming,” Number One Divine King from Divine King Island humphed coldly, “Everyone, let’s work together. Let’s attack one spot all together. I’d like to see if the formation can withstand the hit of all Almighties together.”

“Okay.”

The surrounding people nodded simultaneously.

Very soon, almost seventy Almighties in Star Extermination Alliance launched an attack together.

The Almighties launched attack one after another. In an instant, there were attacks that were performed from each and every one of them.

Then, they hit on the same spot of the formation.

Hong!

An unprecedented bang reverberated in the entire galaxy.

The huge Universe Galaxy was hit by the terrifying attack and it started shaking vigorously.

In Universe Galaxy, the experts from Lineage of Star were watching the scene outside the galaxy anxiously, especially the guest elders. They didn’t know what other trump cards Lineage of Star hid up their sleeves. Hence, all of them were anxious.

From what they could see, the formation should be Lineage of Star’s final reliance.

Once the formation shattered, Lineage of Star would be facing a massacre by Star Extermination Alliance. The experts who accepted their invitation not only wouldn’t receive the Secret Skill of Star Palace, their lives might even be threatened.

But Universe Galaxy was really strong.

Hall Master Yuan’s confidence didn’t come from??nowhere.

The experts from Star Extermination Alliance worked together and attacked the same spot. Universe Galaxy received an unprecedentedly heavy hit. However, after quivering for a while, Universe Galaxy once again steadied itself.

There was no damage or any sign of it collapsing.

The experts from Star Extermination saw the scene and they were in disbelief.

“How is this possible?”

“All of us attacked the same spot together and we didn’t manage to break the formation?!”

“The formation is so strong?!”

Palace Master Wu Luo, Number One Divine King, the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church’s faces grew grave.

In the galaxy.

“Blocked it!”

“That’s great.”

The guest elders from Lineage of Star were filled with excitement.

“Humph, like I said, unless a Great Emperor comes personally, no one can break the formation,” Hall Master Yuan smiled coldly.

He was the weapon’s spirit of Universe Galaxy and he naturally knew about Universe Galaxy the most.

He knew clearly that although there were almost seventy Almighties that worked together to attack one spot together, the attacks of the Almighties were inconsistent with different strengths, as well as different characters. Hence, the power of the attack couldn’t superpose flawlessly.

In other words, the attack was messy and it couldn’t concentrate.

“If the people of Star Extermination Alliance were to know a power superposition skill and combine all seventy Almighties’ power together flawlessly, they might be able to pose a threat to Universe Galaxy. But as of now…” Hall Master Yuan smirked.

Jian Wushuang relaxed when he saw the scene in front of him.

He turned around to look at everyone else and calculate the damage from the earlier fight.

Lineage of Star had definitely had the lower hand in the fight earlier. Although the fight lasted for a very short time, there was one Sir God that had passed away. At the same time, there were a few Dao soldiers that were damaged. Besides, most of the people were injured. In short, it was a wretched sight. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, the outcome of the battle was exactly how Jian Wushuang wanted.

Showed the white feather!

He was showing the white feather!

He wanted Star Extermination Alliance to think that Lineage of Star’s fighting power was unworthy and only the formation was blocking them off.

He wanted Star Extermination Alliance to take Lineage of Star lightly.

Then, when Lineage of Star counter attacked in full force, they could hit their vitals and hurt them badly.

“Hall Master Yuan, only put the defense power of the formation on display. You only need to block the experts from Star Extermination Alliance outside the galaxy. Don’t perform any attack techniques that Universe Galaxy has for now,” Jian Wushuang commanded.

“I understood,” Hall Master Yuan nodded.

When Star Extermination Alliance reached Star Land, they decided on the strategy.

Then, everything was within the control of Lineage of Star.

“Now, Lineage of Star has to suffer for a while. However, the grievance can be wiped out very soon. Let the people from Star Extermination Alliance be smug with their success for a little longer,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“Send a command down. From today onwards, no matter how Star Extermination Alliance taunts us, the experts from Lineage of Star won’t take the challenge!”
