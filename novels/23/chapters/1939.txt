1940 Duan Lingfeng“s Arrival

“Master, what should we do next?” Jian Yi looked.

“Let’s sent the disciples of the Luo royal family to Holy Kingdom of South Plume first. Then, let’s head back to Holy Kingdom of South Plume and make a trip to Soul Snatching Palace,” Jian Wushuang said.

“How about him?” King of Venomous Worms pointed at the masked man in black robe that Jian Wushuang had soul-controlled.

“Keep him for now,” Jian Wushuang’s face was cold, “Holocaust Sect has always been very careful. We will keep him to stay in touch with Holocaust Sect. Don’t let Holocaust Sect get suspicious and flee ahead of time.”

“Let’s continue our journey.”

Jian Wushuang’s willpower moved and the ancient silver spaceship started traveling forward again.

The remaining journey was rather smooth.

Very soon, everyone arrived at the territory of Holy Kingdom of South Plume.

Just as they arrived in the territory… A large crowd surrounding a middle-aged man in a purple robe came forward.

“It’s the Monarch of Holy Kingdom of South Plume!”

“Monarch came personally!”

“Let’s go. Hurry up and head out too.”

The disciples of the Luo royal family immediately walked out of the spaceship to greet.

Very soon, they met each other and the exchange of conventional greetings was inevitable.

“Bother Luo’s juniors, only a few of you left?” The Monarch of Holy Kingdom of South Plume looked at the dozen of disciples of the Luo royal family as he sighed emotionally.

Then, the Monarch of Holy Kingdom of South Plume looked at Jian Wushuang and the other few on the spaceship from afar.

Just as he saw Jian Wushuang, the Monarch of Holy Kingdom of South Plume gawked.

Swoosh!

The Monarch of Holy Kingdom of South Plume moved and appeared in front of the spaceship.

“Excuse me. Are you Sword Emperor, Mister Jian Wushuang?” The Monarch of Holy Kingdom of South Plume sounded fearful.

“You know me?” Jian Wushuang glanced at the Monarch of Holy Kingdom of South Plume.

The Monarch of Holy Kingdom of South Plume immediately knelt before Jian Wushuang, “Greetings, Sword Emperor. Mister, I just met a good friend of mine not too long ago. My good friend came from Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries and he had a copy of the mirror image where Sword Emperor performed the shocking stroke in the galaxy. I saw the scene where you killed the experts from Almighties Alliance. I recognized you from the mirror image and also Mister Jian Yi next to you.”

“Oh, I see,” Jian Wushuang nodded coldly.

However, the experts from Holy Kingdom of South Plume that came with the Monarch of Holy Kingdom of South Plume and the disciples of the Luo royal family were shocked.

They had never expected that the Monarch of a Holy Kingdom would kneel and kowtow before so many of them without caring about his identity!

He kowtowed!

As a Chaotic Real God, a Monarch of a Holy Kingdom, he was on eminent position. One who could make him kowtow would be…

“D*mn. Just what kind of an existence did we come across on the way here?” The blue-haired lady, Luo Feng, was thrilled.

As for the other disciples of the Luo royal family, they were astonished too.

Previously, when they had seen Jian Wushuang killing people from Soul Snatching Palace with ease, they had already known that he was extraordinary.

However, they had never expected that Jian Wushuang had the power to make a Monarch of a Holy Kingdom kowtow.

“Get up,” Jian Wushuang waved his sleeve and the Monarch of Holy Kingdom of South Plume couldn’t help but stand up uncontrollably.

Then, Jian Wushuang had looked at the Luo royal family members, “I already escorted you here safely. Now, I am going to make a trip to Soul Snatching Palace. Would any of you like to follow me?”

“To Soul Snatching Palace?” The disciples of the Luo royal family were stunned.

“Forgive me for the intrusion. What are you heading to Soul Snatching Palace for?” The purple-haired youth, Luo Tianhong asked.

“You’ll know when we get there,” Jian Wushuang didn’t explain much.

The disciples of the Luo royal family exchanged a look. Then, Luo Tianhong took a step forward, “Mister, I will follow you.”

“Mm, sure,” Jia Wushuang nodded faintly.

“Brother Tianhong?” The other disciples looked worried.

“Don’t worry. I am merely making a trip with this mister. I will return very soon,” Luo Tianhong comforted the other disciples.

The Monarch of Holy Kingdom of South Plume exhorted softly, “No matter what this Mister tells you to do, do it without hesitation. Do you understand?”

Hearing what the Monarch of Holy Kingdom of South Plume had said, Luo Tianhong nodded heavily.

Looking at the sight, Jian Wushuang smiled.

He had no other intention when he brought Luo Tianhong. He merely wanted to recommend him to his best friend.

“Mister, when do we go?” Luo Tianhong asked softly.

“We’re not in a hurry. Just wait for a bit,” Jian Wushuang replied coldly.

A huge silver spaceship waited in the void.

As for the troops from Holy Kingdom of South Plume, they waited in silence too. Jian Wushuang didn’t leave and the Monarch of Holy Kingdom of South Plume didn’t dare to leave either.

Very soon, a figure appeared at the far end.

“He’s here?”

Jian Wushuang revealed a smile and he moved to greet him in the void.

“Haha, Duan Lingfeng, you’re finally here?” Jian Wushuang let out a hearty laugh.

“After I received your message, I took the spacetime wormhole to rush over at the first instant. I already came here with my fastest speed possible. Don’t complain that I’m slow,” Duan Lingfeng in a white robe and carrying a saber looked cold but there was gentleness in his eyes.

Jian Wushuang and he had been through trials and tribulations together.

When Jian Wushuang had been in danger, he had stood up for him.

Back when he had been cornered by Four Symbol Mansion, Jian Wushuang had rushed there to resolve his dangerous situation too.

They were sworn friends in life and death.

Jian Wushuang didn’t put on airs when he was talking to his friend.

Duan Lingfeng was a cold man normally but when he was talking to Jian Wushuang, he was much friendlier.

“Let go to the spaceship and talk,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng immediately returned to the silver spaceship. Then, the silver spaceship immediately plunged towards the direction of Holy Kingdom of Sky Luo.

“Farewell, Mister!”

The Monarch of Holy Kingdom of South Plume watched as the silver spaceship departed.

…

In the boundless dark void, the silver spaceship plunged at a high speed.

In the cabin, Jian Wushuang, Duan Lingfeng and King of Venomous Worms sat together while Jian Yi and Qiu Yue stood by them in reverence.

As for the purple-haired youth, Luo Tianhong, he stayed outside the cabin and continued to practice his saber skill.

Luo Tianhong didn’t know that the purpose of Jian Wushuang’s trip was to wipe out Soul Snatching Palace. He was filled with boundless hatred and he wanted to increase his power with all his might so that he could take revenge on behalf of the Luo royal family.

The scene was naturally in the sight of Jian Wushuang and the others.

“The young man outside is the disciple that you want to recommend to me?” Duan Lingfeng looked at Jian Wushuang as he held the wine glass.

“Yes, what do you think?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“He is very talented. His saber skill and comprehension of Massacre Doctrine is similar to mine. But, talent and power aren’t enough to become my disciple. Even if he is suitable to become my disciple, I must be willing to take him as my disciple,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

His thoughts were all about how to breakthrough and become an Almighty. He had never thought about taking disciples.

“Hehe, don’t be in a hurry. Let’s watch and see,” Jian Wushuang smiled.
