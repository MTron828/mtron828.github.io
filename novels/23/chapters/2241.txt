Chapter 2242 Body of Undying.

“Haha. There are so many people. Looks like the Divine Demon Nirvana Elixir is very attractive as a reward.”“That is true. It is Lord Jiao.”

“Those who come from the holy land do things differently to others.”

The twenty or so experts in the divine demon realm talked casually.

When they reached their destination, they already knew what they needed to do.

Right then, a man with purple hair in purple clothes appeared within the mountain dwelling.

When this man appeared, he attracted the attention of all the experts in the divine demon realm.

Even though they were under the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth, the experts in the divine demon realm could tell that the purple-haired man had an aura that surpassed that of the divine demon.

“Chen Qi, it is lord Chen Qi!”

“Lord Chen Qi is here.”

Some of the experts in the divine demon realm recognized Chen Qi and greeted him respectfully.

Chen Qi scanned the experts in the divine demon realm coldly, not saying a word.

Within moments, Old Monster Jiao appeared in front of everyone wearing black armour.

“Lord Jiao!”

“Greetings Lord Jiao!”

The experts in the divine demon realm greeted him respectfully. Chen Qi greeted as well as he did not dare to be arrogant. He just did it less respectfully.

“Are all those that you invited here?” Old Monster Jiao scanned around the room and asked.

“Yes my lord. Those who agreed to help are all here. There are a total of twenty three experts in the divine demon realm, and the addition of Lord Chen Qi.”

Old Monster Jiao nodded his head slightly.

Twenty three experts in the divine demon realm... Some of them were stronger than the rest. Those who were more powerful had the fighting power of a peak stage three great emperor, while those weaker only had the fighting power of an ordinary stage three great emperor. Even though it was only at the level of an ordinary stage three great emperor, it was still at the level of a stage three great emperor!

Within the Eternal Chaotic World, there were only two stage three great emperors in Sanctuary Alliance: Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang.

Now they had twenty three experts with the fighting power at least that of a stage three great emperor. It made twenty-four including Chu He.

On top of this, Old Monster Jiao and Chen Qi had both been more powerful than any divine demon during their primes. Under the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth, they had the fighting power of an expert in the half-step divine demon realm. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

This lineup was considered terrifying.

“Chen Qi, thank you for coming. I will remember this favour.” Old Monster Jiao looked at Chen Qi and said.

Chen Qi nodded his head slightly, not speaking.

“As for the rest of you.... Since I have already promised all of you, I will live up to my promise and give all of you one Divine Demon Nirvana Elixir after we return to the Absolute Beginning Divine World.”

The experts were overjoyed.

They knew of Old Monster Jiao’s background and believed that he would live up to his promise.

“Alright, let’s talk about the mission. Everyone here should know that my target this time is Emperor Bai. He killed my ride. He must die!” Old Monster Jiao said extremely coldly.

The experts present raised their eyebrows.

“Sir Jiao,” Chen Qi said suddenly.

The experts in the Divine Demon Realm would refer to Old Monster Jiao as lord. Only Chen Qi would call him sir as there were of the same realm.

“I was informed about what you wanted us to do when I arrived here. I think it is not possible to kill Emperor Bai as a way to take revenge for your ride,” Chen Qi said.

“Huh? Chen Qi, what do you mean by that?” Old Monster Jiao’s face turned dark as he questioned Chen Qi fiercely.

“Sir Jiao. I am not trying to anger you. However, what I said is the truth,” Chen Qi looked directly at Old Monster Jiao, not backing down from the fierce stare. He continued, “Sir Jiao has been awake for a short period of time and has explored this world for some time. How good is your understanding of the top-tier experts in this era?”

“I have limited understanding of them,” Old Monster Jiao said.

He was speaking the truth.

Ever since he had left the Buddhist Demon Sea, he had started to explore the Eternal Chaotic World and had some understanding of the top tier experts in this era.

He knew of Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang. He also knew that they had incredible fighting power.

However, he had not looked into what realm they were in or how strong they really were.

This was why he looked down on Emperor Bai and had suffered losses.

“Sir Jiao, you do not know how strong they are, but I do. I did thorough research on every single top-tier expert,” Chen Qi said slowly.

“Let’s talk about Emperor Bai first. He is extremely powerful and is unanimously considered the most powerful man in this era and is unbeatable in this world. I am sure you will agree with this since you have fought him before.”

Old Monster Jiao face darkened.

After fighting Emperor Bai, he had a certain understanding of how powerful he was.

Just like Chen Qi said, Old Monster Jiao knew that he was no match for Emperor Bai.

“I cannot beat him one on one. This is exactly why I am willing to pay such a heavy price to ask all of you to help me. If we work together, we can kill him,” Old Monster Jiao said.

“There is one more point that Sir Jiao should know. Emperor Bai is not only powerful, he is also an inverse cultivator. Inverse cultivation is a unique way of cultivating and is vastly different from the normal way of cultivation,” Chen Qi shook his head and said.

“Emperor Bai is so powerful because of inverse cultivation. His power is not limited by the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth. Furthermore, inverse cultivators have unique abilities. One of them is the Body of Undying!”

“What?” Old Monster Jiao’s face turned dark.

All the experts in the divine demon realm looked over at Chen Qi in surprise.

“Body of Undying? You mean that Body of Undying that only Undying Saint has?” Old Monster Jiao stared at Chen Qi and asked.

“That is right. There might be differences in the Body of Undying between an Undying Saint and an inverse cultivator, but it would not be a big difference. From what I know, Emperor Bai was once under the effect of Opposing Blood Formation and was killed by the Blood Emperor, who could use the power belonging to the Divine Demon Realm. After Emperor Bai’s divine body was destroyed and annihilated, he regenerated his divine body within moments!!” Chen Qi nodded his head solemely and said.

“He regenerated his divine body even after you completely destroyed it. Is this the Body of Undying?”

After hearing what Chen Qi had said, Old Monster Jiao fell silent.
