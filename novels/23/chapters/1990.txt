Chapter 1991: Sword Emperor’s Arrival

Just as the two of them were thinking of how to escape…

Swoosh!

There was a figure that suddenly plunged over from afar and appeared in front of them in an instant.

“Such speed…”

The middle-aged man who carried three swords and Sir God Mo Yu were shocked. Then, they subconsciously stopped.

They looked at the incomer immediately.

“Tian Jian, it has been a while,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Jian… Jian Wushuang?” The middle-aged man who carried three swords on his back, who was the Master of Sky Sword Mountain stared.

“Sword Emperor?” Sir God Mo Yu was shocked too.

Just as they recognized Jian Wushuang, they noticed the aura that was given out from Jian Wushuang’s body.

“Sir God? Sir God aura?”

“Almighty?”

The two of them were surprised.

One should know that Jian Wushuang could suppress a peak Emperor God at Real God level.

Then, as he broke through, his power…

The Master of Sky Sword Mountain and Sir God Mo Yu took a deep breath and immediately became polite.

“Tian Jian, you look like you are being chased?” Jian Wushuang asked.

He had dealt with the Master of Sky Sword Mountain before. Back when he was still a Universe God, he had stayed in Sky Sword Prison under the Master of Sky Sword Mountain for a few thousand years. It was the Master of Sky Sword Mountain himself that had imprisoned Jian Wushuang.

However, Jian Wushuang also knew that the Master of Sky Sword Mountain had suppressed him because Hall Master Yuan had intentionally instructed him to do so. He naturally couldn’t blame it on the Master of Sky Sword Mountain. On top of that, Jian Wushuang had improved tremendously in Sky Sword Prison.

Later, when Wu Bei’s cave came into the world, Jian Wushuang traded two White Blaze Fruit in exchange for Fiery King’s freedom.

They had had dealings before and they could be considered friends.

“Yeah, someone is after me,” the Master of Sky Sword Mountain replied, embarrassed.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and looked at the void behind. He had felt a bolt of raging aura rushing over long ago.

In the blink of an eye, the figure appeared before Jian Wushuang.

The person was wearing a golden top with messy hair. His beard and mustache were all golden and there was a fire burning in his eyes. The feeling it gave was like a raging beast.

“Judging from his look, he should be the Golden Lion, right?” Jian Wushuang scoffed.

Golden Lion was a nickname from experts of the same level. Those cultivators who were weaker would refer to him reverently as Emperor God Golden Lion.

Emperor God Golden Lion was mad by nature and he was quite famous in Eternal Chaotic World. He had only been a top Sir God previously. He had broken through and became an Emperor God when he’d found an opportunity on the ancient battlefield.

“Many years ago, I had a deep enmity with the Golden Lion. He’ll stop at nothing to kill me. He was only a Sir God back then and I wasn’t afraid of him. But now…” The Master of Sky Sword Mountain smiled bitterly.

Then, Golden Lion looked over like a beast looking at its prey. His hysterical laughter reverberated in the universe, “Tian Jian, why aren’t you running anymore? Go ahead and run! I’ll chase after you no matter how long you run away. No matter where you run to, I will not let you go!”

“Golden Lion, it’s my fault that I killed your disciple. But I didn’t know his identity then. Plus, I already took the initiative to see you and apologized. Do you have to be so persistent?” The Master of Sky Sword Mountain roared.

“Haha!! That’s a joke. You know my temperament. As you have offended me, don’t even dream about getting off the hook just like that. Between you and I, there’ll be no end to this!!” Golden Lion roared coldly.

“You!!!” The Master of Sky Sword Mountain was pissed off.

Jian Wushuang looked enlightened as he finally understood the ins and outs of the story. He immediately said, “Emperor God Golden Lion, Tian Jian and I are friends. Plus, he apologized to you about the death of your disciple. You could take advantage of him but as for killing him, could you please let him off the hook as a courtesy to me?”

“Let him off the hook? Humph? Who are you? I will kill whoever I want. It is none of your business. It’s best if you move aside right now. Otherwise, I will kill you both if I am in a bad mood. Same goes to Sir God Mo Yu!!” Golden Lion roared in anger.

The Master of Sky Sword Mountain and Sir God Mo Yu heard and they were shocked.

Both of them couldn’t help but look at Jian Wushuang.

“Golden Lion, are you courting death?!” Sir God Mo Yu roared from the bottom of his heart. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave, as expected.

“Humph!”

A cold thump reverberated in the universe.

Jian Wushuang didn’t move at all. There was quite a distance between him and Golden Lion, but as he waved…

There was a huge hand that appeared in the void near Golden Lion straight away without any warning.

The hand contained a terrifying power and instantly froze the spacetime around Golden Lion. He couldn’t even move an inch in time.

Bang!

The huge hand slapped Golden Lion brutally and Golden Lion let out a painful groan. He was slammed onto the barren ground and no one knew if he was dead or alive.

The Master of Sky Sword Mountain and Sir God Mo Yu couldn’t help but gulp at the sight, but they weren’t surprised.

Golden Lion was an Emperor God, a top expert. But what was he in front of the legendary Sword Emperor?

Sword Emperor challenged the entire Eternal Chaotic World alone. He had even forced everyone in Eternal Chaotic World to give in. Although it was mostly because of the grand formation in the spacetime storm, it showed Sword Emperor’s capability.

Plus, Sword Emperor had already broken through!

Forget about an Emperor God who had just broken through not too long ago, even a peak Emperor God, like Emperor God Tian Ling and invincible Emperor God or Underworld God, had to bow down before Sword Emperor.

Hualala.

There was a large number of shattered stones that dispersed and fell into the huge pit on the ground. There was a miserable figure who slowly got to his feet.

The figure was naturally Golden Lion.

However, Golden Lion had lost his imposing manner earlier. He only looked to be in a fix and a wretched situation. He also looked more fearful.

His gaze was fixed upon Jian Wushuang and was filled with terror.

He then slowly spoke, “You, you are Sword Emperor?”

“That’s me,” Jian Wushuang’s face was cold.

“You’re really him,” Golden Lion’s face changed.

He was arrogant and obstinate. He was truly a madman and he didn’t care about the story of the experts in Eternal Chaotic World.

He had heard of Jian Wushuang but he had never watched any mirror image of him before. Hence, he couldn’t recognize Jian Wushuang at first glance.

The most crucial part was that Jian Wushuang had broken through and the aura given out was of Sir God level, not Real God. Hence, when he saw a Sir God, he naturally didn’t associate him with Sword Emperor until he attacked. Then, he realized.

He understood that he was in big trouble!
