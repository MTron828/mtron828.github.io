Chapter 2505: Xuan Shen’s Advice (1)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Junior Jian Wushuang greets Daoist Master Xuan Shen.” Jian Wushuang bowed very humbly.

There was almost no one qualified to be greeted in such a way by Jian Wushuang throughout Wusha Wilderness. However, Daoist Xuan Shen before him was undoubtedly qualified to accept such politeness.

The barefooted old gentleman who sat on the chair gradually opened his eyes and looked at Zhuo Yunfeng. “Governor Zhuo, would you mind if I have a word with the kid?”

“As you wish, Daoist Master.”

Zhuo Yunfeng and his wife immediately stood up and exited the hall with their servants.

Shortly after, only Jian Wushuang and Daoist Xuan Shen were left in the main hall.

Daoist Xuan Shen casually waved his hand and manifested a layer of restrictive barrier around the main hall to prevent others from hearing their conversation.

“Kid, I know about you.” Daoist Xuan Shen gazed at Jian Wushuang calmly with his eyes like a clear pool of water as though he had completely seen through Jian Wushuang.

“You know me?” Jian Wushuang was perplexed.

Daoist Xuan Shen said, “I know everything about you which includes your past, present, and future life...”

“Sir.” Jian Wushuang was startled and about to inquire.

Daoist Xuan Shen waved his hand and stopped him from talking. “I know you have a lot of questions, but there are some matters you better off be ignorant about. The reason I’m here to see you now is to give you advice on certain matters.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Jian Wushuang focused and listened.

“One, you and I are on the same side and camp, you shouldn’t doubt this. The reason is that I come from the Seven Stars Black Sect and your master Xuan Yi has a very close relationship with me,” said Daoist Xuan Shen.

Jian Wushuang nodded as there was nothing to doubt about what Daoist Xuan Shen just said.

He had guessed earlier on that even if Daoist Xuan Shen was not from Seven Star Black Sect, he was at least on his side.

The reason being he knew about everything, such as Jian Wushuang’s birthplace in his next reincarnation life, and even visited on the day he was born to name him ‘Jian Wushuang’.

The Reincarnation Passage was a deep mystery that even the Will of Heavenly Way did not know where he would be born. However, Daoist Xuan Shen knew about it.

Obviously, the only logical explanation was Xuan Yi who personally sent Jian Wushuang into the Reincarnation Passage had told Xuan Shen about it.

That alone was enough to prove Daoist Xuan Shen and Xuan Yi were on the same side and shared deep relations.

Jian Wushuang had even guessed the Daoist Xuan Shen in front of him could be Lord of Seven Stars Black Sect!

Seven Stars Black Sect had three supreme figures during their peak.

Xuan Yu—Lord of Seven Stars Black Sect, Xuan Yan—Lord of Divine Punishment Palace, and Xuan Yi—the most unique person in the Seven Stars Black Sect and also Jian Wushuang’s master!

Among the three of them, Xuan Yi’s cultivation level was undetermined while both Xuan Yu and Xuan Yan were Realm Lords. During the great war, Seven Stars Black Sect was toppled, but quite a number of their highest level experts had survived. Perhaps, Lord of Seven Stars Black Sect was also still alive.

However, that was naturally Jian Wushuang’s speculation. Whether Daoist Xuan Shen before him was really Lord of Seven Stars Black Sect was something he could not be certain about and naturally would not dare to ask.

Daoist Xuan Shen continued, “Secondly, it’s about you being a Perfect Chaotic Creature. A Perfect Chaotic Creature is a creature second to none in the Heavens and Earth. A long time ago, your master Xuan Yi was the first Perfect Chaotic Creature to ever exist in the world. After he died, his remaining consciousness has spent tremendous effort and sacrifice until the last bit of his consciousness has completely evaporated just to make you who you are today.”

“However, a Perfect Chaotic Creature isn’t acceptable by Heavenly Way. The Will of Heavenly Way would use every method possible to destroy you so that the balance of Heavenly Way could be maintained. You have probably sensed this.”

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and said, “Mmhm, I’ve heard about it. When I made a breakthrough to the Divine Demon realm in Saint’s Tomb and metamorphosed into a Perfect Chaotic Creature, the world outside underwent radical changes. Furthermore, the energy of the Will of Heavenly Way was concentrating, but for whatever reason, it evaporated before it could be fully formed.”

The Will of Heavenly Way would not disappear for no reason. It vanished because I did it,” said Daoist Xuan Shen.

“You drove it away?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

The energy from the Will of Heavenly Way represented both the Heavenly Way and Cycle of Heaven.

In order to drive the energy away, Daoist Xuan Shen’s abilities must be...

Daoist Xuan Shen smiled faintly. “Don’t feel too shocked. Although its energy is strong, it isn’t as terrifying as you have imagined. The Will of Heavenly Way is constantly in control of the Ancient God Domain and there are many rules of Heaven that it couldn’t defy by itself after all. Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable.”

Moreover, Wusha Wilderness is located beyond the Third Heaven. It can be considered as the outermost edge of the Ancient God Domain, a place where the Will of Heavenly Way was the weakest. The Will of Heavenly Way which concentrated and formed here is thin and weak. It’s really not that strong.”

It was easy for Daoist Xuan Shen to say, but Jian Wushuang would still not take it lightly.

That was the Will of Heavenly Way. Even with various restrictions and his current location which was where it was the weakest, its energy could probably still be insanely powerful when concentrated and formed. Under the Will of Heavenly Way’s threat, an Undying Saint was probably only as powerful as an ant.

In order to drive the Will of Heavenly Way away, one had to have powers of at least higher than an Undying Saint or even that of a Realm Lord.

The Daoist Xuan Shen before him was most probably a Realm Lord.

“Jian Wushuang, even though the Will of Heavenly Way’s energy has been driven away by me when it formed, the Will of Heavenly Way has already noticed your existence. Luckily, I’ve fooled the Divine Intelligence on time. Although it realizes the second Perfect Chaotic Creature has been born between Heaven and Earth, it doesn’t know where you are, so it’s impossible for it to harm you again. Of course, if you trigger a huge event once again, the Will of Heavenly Way could probably track you down,” said Daoist Xuan Shen.

“Trigger a huge event? What huge event could catch the Will of Heavenly Way’s attention? Is it to get incredibly famous in Ancient God Domain or something?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“No, regardless how famous you become in Ancient God Domain doesn’t affect the Cycle of Heaven, hence the Will of Heavenly Way wouldn’t pay attention to you. What I mean by ‘huge event’ are you utilizing the tactics and abilities unique to a Perfect Chaotic Creature. For example...that perfect life rating pressure which you unleashed!” Daoist Xuan Shen said.

Jian Wushuang was slightly stunned.

Daoist Xuan Shen even knew about the life rating pressure. He obviously had a deep knowledge of Perfect Chaotic Creatures. One could even say he knew everything about it.

“Jian Wushuang, you definitely have to master the perfect life rating pressure after you become a Perfect Chaotic Creature. Try oppressing me with it,” said Daoist Xuan Shen.
