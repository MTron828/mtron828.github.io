Chapter 5444 ¬†Fighting a Universe Master

How could he be so strong?

The transformed Heavenly Demon body had reached twelve arms, the most perfect form of the Heavenly Demon body, the true form of the ancient Heavenly Demon.

The ancient Heavenly Demon race, not considered a powerful lineage, with the strongest being only at the supreme-peak level, perhaps unheard of by Grandmaster.

The Twelve-Arm Heavenly Demon, with a divine body enhanced 50,000-fold, was honestly just an average supreme technique, probably not as powerful as the supreme technique created by Bai Junwang.

Yet Jian Wushuang, as a Dao Lord, had mastered the supreme technique created at the supreme-peak level, which was quite extraordinary.

With a divine body enhanced 50,000-fold, Jian Wushuang felt every particle in his body trembling.

The power was too overwhelming.

The Origin Source of space was amplified to 70 percent of the black hole realm.

Whoosh!

At this moment, Jian Wushuang, resembling the true form of the Heavenly Demon, had a scorching force behind him, akin to a black hole.

The towering Twelve-Arm Heavenly Demon had a massive black hole behind its back.

This scene had only appeared in ancient times!

Even if there were a peak-level tier 5 present, Jian Wushuang felt like he could shatter the opponent with a single punch.

Move!

Swish!

Crack!

Boom!

Everything changed in an instant.

Jian Wushuang immediately engaged in close combat, displaying no fancy moves, only fierce punches.

The power of all things poured down like cascading seawater from the sky, and each moment's power consumption was comparable to that of a tier 4 Emperor.

Snap!

After struggling to resist Jian Wushuang's punch, the First True King staggered backward.

The power was too formidable.

Although his realm surpassed Jian Wushuang by a lot, in a head-on collision, he couldn't hold his ground.

This exceeded his understanding; he, a Universe Master and former king of the Three Kings Courts, had never encountered such a powerful Dao Lord.

In countless epochs, he carefully reminisced.

Having once traversed the starry sky and wandered through the vastness of the Moro Time-Space, he had never encountered a Dao Lord as extraordinary as this.

Perhaps the only thing that could be compared to him was the colossal egg that brought about the downfall of the Three Kings Court.

The life born from that gigantic egg was neither a special existence nor a primordial divine beast; it hailed from a stellar community.

In the expanse of the cosmos, he could accept the birth of extraordinary life, but why was Jian Wushuang, a solitary human cultivator, so formidable?

His life level was exceptionally high, and his physical body had reached a state of perfection, with each particle within him constantly transforming into an unending stream of power.

The Origin Source within him was so profound that it made even a Universe Master feel inferior.

The Origin Source of a Dao Lord rivaled that of a tier 6 Emperor.

The more they clashed, the more astonished he became.

Finally, distancing himself from Jian Wushuang, he initiated his ultimate technique.

In a head-on collision, he truly had no way to deal with Jian Wushuang.

However, using his ultimate technique or secret arts was a different story.

Even when solely manipulating space, he could control the local space, showcasing the might of the cosmic realm.

"Condense!"

Space began to distort, forcing Jian Wushuang to retreat with no way out.

When he attempted to get close to the Dao Lord, even though his fist was clearly about to strike the opponent's face, a turn of the head transported him to another space.

He couldn't touch the Dao Lord at all.

The black hole formed by Jian Wushuang, attempting to traverse space, was too slow.

This was the expanse of the cosmic space!

Inhaling sharply, Jian Wushuang marveled at the experience. Although he couldn't win, he had now seen clearly the rules and mysteries of cosmic space.

Layers upon layers of space overlapped, with only two stars traversing through all the spaces. Following this, the black hole evolved into the universe.

Jian Wushuang himself was like those two stars, and some creatures could only exist at the lowest level.

Grandmaster, who had perfected the cultivation of space, stood proudly on the tenth level, wielding the power of the sun, moon, and stars like a king.

"The universe is truly unimaginable!" Jian Wushuang, though powerless, had not completely given up.

He still possessed the ultimate trump card, surpassing any treasure he might have obtained.

Grandmaster, holding the sun and moon in his hands, said indifferently, "Still not giving up?"

"Never!"

Jian Wushuang shouted angrily, "The universe doesn't belong to you alone!"

Hum!

His telepathic force expanded, the black hole behind Jian Wushuang disappeared, and all signs of spatial energy retreated and dissipated.

"One Thought!" Jian Wushuang slightly closed his eyes, his hands forming seals, standing upright, reverting to his original appearance.

At this moment, with him at the center, telepathic force scattered into space, the power of engulfment condensed into a black hole, and the force of all things was multiplying into the universe.

Boom!

Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes, shouting, "Universe, rise!"

A real and massive universe instantly descended, enveloping even the First True King, Grandmaster.

Grandmaster frowned, surveying his surroundings.

That familiar aura made some things clear to him.

It was too familiar‚Äîit was the power he had once wielded, the power of the universe.

It was rising, gradually suppressing the universe space he had created.

There was no choice; the power of the universe space wielded by a Dao Lord was limited.

But Jian Wushuang was different. His universe, linked to Thought power, Devouringf, and All Things, grew stronger with these three aspects.

The more potent they were, the more powerful his One Thought Universe.

From the previous million miles to later billions of miles.

Now, the universe he created with one thought could rival a medium-sized world.

Similar in size to the former Grand Si Region.

Once he became an Emperor, the universe created with his one thought would probably be comparable to higher-level worlds.

When he became the Universe Master, perhaps he could descend upon an entire universe solely by his own power.

That would be the true invincibility.

However, the universe was ultimately illusory. How wonderful it would be if it could become real!

If the Universe Master knew about this idea, he would probably point at Jian Wushuang's nose and call him a fool with dreams.

"In my universe, the enemy either escapes without a trace or meets a complete defeat!"

Jian Wushuang was in a good mood, even daring to mock the First True King.

Now, the opponent couldn't escape anymore.

They could only choose to confront him head-on.

Transforming once again into the Twelve-Armed Heavenly Demon, the Candle Dragon Wings spread wide.

The Candle Dragon arm raised slightly, clenched its fist, and a black hole collapsed.

This power boosted Jian Wushuang's confidence, and he directly attacked the Universe Master.

He not only wanted to defeat the opponent but also to give him a thorough beating.

Boom!

One punch, two punches, tens of thousands of punches!

The punches fell like pouring rain.

Viciously smashing onto the round belly of the Universe Master, yet his clothes seemed to be some extraordinary treasure, as they surprisingly didn't shatter.

It's worth noting that Jian Wushuang's robe had long since torn apart, with only a few strips of cloth left on him.

Only the dim red shining battle armor remained.

Twelve arms, each holding the sun and moon.

Especially the Candle Dragon Arm, its fist turned into a black hole. A punch sent the Universe Master flying billions of miles away.

Then, his figure didn't move. Billions of miles away, another identical Jian Wushuang appeared, hands clenched, six fists ready.

Together, they pounded the Universe Master who had bent down, instantly straightening him out. His figure was like a kicked ball, transmitted back to Jian Wushuang's original position.

For a moment, in the vast universe, there were several Jian Wushuangs appearing and disappearing, truly giving the First True King a thorough beating.
