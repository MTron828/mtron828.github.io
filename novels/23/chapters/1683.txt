Chapter 1684: Formation

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“The experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace have learned their lessons,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

The three top Chaotic Real Gods who appeared within the coverage of his Soul Power stopped nearby but didn’t come nearer to fight with him.

It was obvious that they intended to wait for more experts to gather. When they had a stronger formation, they’d attack him.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t be bothered. He pretended that he didn’t notice the three experts and continued to move forward slowly.

As time passed, there were more and more experts that appeared around Jian Wushuang. The experts who were from Soaring Heaven King Palace and those who were hired by Soaring Heaven King Palace made a total of seven.

A total of seven top Chaotic Real God and two had the power of one who was extremely close in fighting power of one on the Real God ranking list.

Such a formation was very strong. However, Soaring Heaven King Palace wasn’t in a hurry to attack him.

“Jian Wushuang, Real God Huan Yu and I are nearby,” there was suddenly a message.

“Oh, Real God Duan Yan,” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Real God Duan Yan and Real God Huan Yu were two tops Chaotic Real Gods in Lineage of Star. When the experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace were approaching Jian Wushuang, the experts from Lineage of Star naturally followed. However, in terms of formation, the difference was vast.

It wasn’t because there was a vast difference between Lineage of Star and Soaring Heaven King Palace but because Lineage of Star didn’t pay a great price to hire experts for help. Hall Master Yuan wanted to do so but Jian Wushuang had rejected him.

“We are doomed. Soaring Heaven King Palace has already gathered seven top Chaotic Real Gods around himself. Even an expert on Real God ranking list has to avoid such a team formation. The three of us won’t be able to match evenly,” Real God Duan Yan said in a low voice.

“Maybe,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly.

“Jian Wushuang, these experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace came for you. Why don’t you look anxious at all?” Real God Duan Yan was shocked at his calmness.

“It will eventually come anyway. What’s the use of being anxious?” Jian Wushuang smiled but didn’t care.

“You’re so positive,” Real God Duan Yan pouted but suddenly.

There were suddenly three more fierce auras that popped into the range of Jian Wushuang’s soul power coverage.

The three auras quickly gathered with the other seven experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace.

“Another three?” Real God Duan Yan was shocked.

“Sh*t!” Real God Huan Yu looked solemn, “Previously, there were only seven top Chaotic Real Gods and they were already far beyond what we could withstand. But now, there are another three. A total of ten top Chaotic Real Gods. Among them, there are two who are extremely close to Real God ranking list. This team formation is terrifying!”

“Jian Wushuang, hurry up and run. Huan Yu and I will try our best to help you,” Real God Duan Yan said.

“I will perform Heart of Sea Region in collaboration with realm treasure. I should be able to hold them back for a while. You seize the chance,” Real God Huan Yu said.

The two Real Gods were obviously anxious.

“Actually, you don’t have to…” Jian Wushuang had yet to finish his sentence.

“They are going to attack!” Real God Duan Yan’s gaze fixed.

In the dark void before Jian Wushuang, the ten figures flew over at the same time at an extremely fast speed.

The aura of the ten figures was shockingly strong. The moment one moves, he immediately attracted the attention of the experts in the surrounding void.

“They are attacking. Soaring Heaven King Palace is finally attacking!”

“They gathered a total of ten top Chaotic Real Gods before they attack. Soaring Heaven King Palace is cautious.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Among the ten top Chaotic Real Gods, there are two who are extremely close to Real God ranking list. Such a team formation… Even if a true expert on Real God ranking list came across this formation, I reckon he could only turn and flee.”

The experts that had gathered in the nearby void to watch were getting excited.

They followed the experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace to watch the fight.

They want to witness a top genius’s passing with their own eyes.

In the dark void, the top Chaotic Real Gods from Soaring Heaven King Palace appeared in the void before Jian Wushuang and they let out a billowing murderous intention.

“Jian Wushuang, you have to die!”

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

In the terrifying explosion noise, there was boundless divine might that pressed at Jian Wushuang.

However, before they could get close to Jian Wushuang, there was suddenly a lady in white that appeared before Jian Wushuang. The lady in white was graceful. She held a sword in her left hand and a unique compass in her right hand.

“Heart of Sea Region!”

“Whirling World!”

Rumble.

Sea water in jade green swept out and flooded the universe. Instantly, it formed billowing waves that were tens of thousand zhang tall. The billowing waves lapped and covered the ten experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace.

“That is Real God Huan Yu from Lineage of Star. Real God Duan Yan is here too!”

“The two of them want to stop us so that Jian Wushuang will have a chance to flee. Humph. Dream on. Palace Master commanded that we hold no scruples. As the experts from Lineage of Star dare to get involved, we will kill them altogether!”

“Die!”

The ten top Chaotic Real God took out their divine weapons simultaneously. At the same time, there were various auras that spread out. Some were like scorching-hot flames, others like sturdy mountains. There were even some who wielded their huge axes and slashed the first ten thousand tall waves that swept at them.

“Jian Wushuang, let’s hurry up and leave!”

Real God Duan Yan roared. Real God Huan Yu and he wanted to flee at first instant.

The two of them had never thought of fighting head-on with the ten top Chaotic Real God. That was simply courting death.

However, just as they prepared to leave, Jian Wushuang, who stood on the dark land, suddenly lifted his head and his cold eyes let out two substantiated lights as he looked at the ten top Chaotic Real Gods. Suddenly, there was an instant murderous intention that soared up.

Swoosh!

A ghostly figure burst out and left behind countless shadows in the void.

The ghostly figure pierced Sea of Heart Region that Real God Huan Yu performed and appeared before the ten top Chaotic Real Gods.

The sight shocked the experts at the scene, including those experts who were watching in the dark. They were all astonished.

Everyone could tell that Real God Huan Yu had performed Sea of Heart Region and Whirling World with his all in order to create a chance for Jian Wushuang to flee and survive. Everyone thought so, including Real God Huan Yu and Real God Duan Yan themselves.

But in the end, Jian Wushuang didn’t run away but barged out alone. He came before the ten top Chaotic Real Gods.
