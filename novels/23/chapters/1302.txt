Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Clang!

There was a loud clash at the crucial moment. Universe God Qing Yang swung the black sickle in his hand and blocked Jian Wushuang’s attack. The strong power exploded from the sword and cast Universe God Qing Yang off. He was flung off tens of thousands of miles due to the impact, but he barely stopped and his complexion was obviously pale.

Everyone who was watching the battle saw the sight and was surprised.

“This…”

“At first, I thought it would be a battle with no suspense. However, when they started fighting, Universe God Qing Yang was at a disadvantageous position?”

“Universe God Qing Yang was cast off by Jian Wushuang?”

“Jian Wushuang has the advantage?”

Everyone was surprised.

They found it unbelievable.

After all, there was no one who believed that Jian Wushuang could be Universe God Qing Yang’s match before the battle.

Everyone was merely wondering about how long Jian Wushuang could survive under Universe God Qing Yang’s attack.

However, the scene before their eyes was beyond their expectations.

The two of them fought and Jian Wushuang had the upper hand in the end and cast Universe God Qing Yang off.

“Jian Wushuang, it seems like I belittled you,” Universe God Qing Yang could feel the surrounding strange looks and his face grew grave, “A year ago, your power was probably close to a Peak Universe God in the First Heaven. Any Peak Universe God in the First Heaven should be able to win against you. But now, your power has increased to such a level. I’m afraid even Chu Xiao couldn’t be your match now too.”

Universe God Qing Yang didn’t hide his voice and everyone could hear him clearly. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

What he said stirred a discussion among the spectators.

Amongst the crowd, Chu Xiao from Dayu Palace was standing there too. His eyebrows were tightly knitted and he mumbled, “Jian Wushuang, his power has surpassed me?”

He found it unbelievable.

In a year’s time, Jian Wushuang had improved so tremendously.

Not just him, almost everyone at the scene found it hard to believe.

“In a year’s time, your strength increased tremendously. Jian Wushuang, I am really curious… how did you do it? Was it because of the chess game?” Universe Qing Yang said and looked towards Jian Wushuang, “how many moves did you resolve in the Little Scattered Stars Game?”

The surrounding spectators too looked towards Jian Wushuang.

Especially those inner disciples of Dayu Palace. Then, only they remembered that Jian Wushuang didn’t disclose the number of moves he resolved a year ago.

No one else knew how far in the Little Scattered Stars Game he had managed to get in the ten years duration.

Until then, Universe God Qing Yang only thought of asking after seeing Jian Wushuang’s tremendous improvement in a year.

Jian Wushuang didn’t intend to answer Universe God Qing Yang’s inquiry but the Master of Dayu Palace, who was in the void in front of the training field, laughed and cut in, “I know how many moves did Jian Wushuang resolved. Just like you, he studied the chess game for ten years. But in the end, the number of moves that he resolved was three higher than your total, Qing Yang.”

The Master of Dayu Palace replied so lightly, but Universe God Qing Yang heard it and it sounded so jarring.

“Three more moves than me?” Universe God Qing Yang’s eyes were wide open.

The surrounding inner disciples were surprised too.

“Universe God Qing Yang resolved thirty-two moves in ten years and he made three more moves than Universe God Qing Yang. Doesn’t it mean that he resolved thirty-five moves?”

“As a Universe Master, he resolved thirty-five move in ten years? Is this a joke?”

“Didn’t the Palace Master said that the chess game was restrained by one’s level? Wasn’t there too many moves for a Universe Master to resolve? How could he resolve more moves than Universe God Qing Yang?”

“Jian Wushuang is so low profile. He resolved thirty-five moves, which was much better than Universe God Qing Yao, but when he came out from the secret room back then, he didn’t even say a word. If Universe God Qing Yang didn’t ask, we wouldn’t know the exact numbers of moves he had resolved in the game!”

“No wonder. No wonder Jian Wushuang could improve so tremendously in a year. It turned out that he was the one who had the biggest harvest from the chess game back then.”

The inner disciples of Dayu Palace were astonished.

Universe God Qing Yang and Chu Xiao were both left speechless.

When they had resolved the chess game, both of them were arrogant and resolved the chess game before everyone.

Then, only they realized that Jian Wushuang who was in the secret room was the real monster, a monster who was countless times more amazing than them!

“Jiang Wushuang, you are only a Universe Master but you resolved thirty-five moves in the chess game. That’s really impressive,” Universe God Qing Yang looked cold as he stared at Jian Wushuang. Even though he didn’t admit defeat, he couldn’t deny the fact that a Universe God in the First Heaven only managed to resolve thirty-two moves in the Little Scattered Stars Game, even when he gave his all.

However, Jian Wushuang who was just a Universe Master could resolve three more moves than to him.

“Well, it’s better this way. If you were to be too weak, I’d be constrained when I fight against you. But now, I can give my all and fight with you!”

“Jian Wushuang, you should feel honored!”

“Forget about Universe Gods in the Second Heaven or above, you are the only one who is qualified for me to give my all to, to fight against in Dayu World.

“Jian Wushuang, enjoy your last moments. You are going to die soon!”

Universe God Qing Yang’s voice was cold, and every single word reverberated in the universe.

Once again, the entire universe was in silence.

Everyone held their breath and looked at Universe God Qing Yang.

Everyone knew that Universe God Qing Yang was going to give his all in the fight!

Among the crowd, Chu Xiao held his fists tight and bit his lip.

One year ago, he exerted himself to the utmost when he fought with Universe God Qing Yang but he didn’t manage to force him to fight with him all out. But then, Universe God was finally going to give his all.

“He’s finally giving his all?”

The Master of Dayu Palace in the void smiled faintly while Wu Cang next to him was still calm.

Hearing what Universe God said, Jian Wushuang’s lip twitched into a smile and the excitement in his eyes grew abundantly.

“I’d like to see. You, who is recognized as the number one Universe God in the First Heaven by countless cultivators, how strong are you exactly?”

“Come on!”

Jian Wushuang’s calm voice was heard across the universe.

“Humph!”

There was a faint flash in Universe God Qing Yang’s eyes. With a low humph, his body became illusionary before everyone’s eyes.

At first, there was only one Universe God Qing Yang on the training field. But the very next moment, there were more than a dozen of Universe God Qing Yang!
