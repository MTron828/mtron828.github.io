Chapter 2992: Sweep!

——

Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua!

The strange figure kept on flashing with lightning, and in the void, heads were cut off one by one like wheat being cut off.

In less than a breath’s time, eight of the ten or so Immortal Saints of Bloody Blade Island had been killed on the spot.

This terrifying slaughter speed scared the remaining False Saints of Blood Blade Island to death.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s figure burst out again.

“Stop!”

Blood Blade Island Master let out a fierce roar. His eyes turned completely scarlet, and his body shot toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang stopped the slaughter and glanced at Blood Blade Island Master, then he held the sword with one hand.

Buzz!

A majestic sword shadow suddenly slashed out with the boundless sword tree, which was 3,300 meters tall.

A scarlet saber appeared in the Blood Blade Island Master’s hand. It was a blood saber.

As he raised his hands, a vast blood Qi rose. The Blood Blade Island Master seemed to be in a frenzy. At this moment, he had exerted the divine power in his hands to the maximum.

Hua!

The saber light slashed over and collided with the majestic sword shadow.

Dang!

A loud sound rang out. A terrifying shock wave swept out wantonly, raising the entire surface of the sea below.

At the center of the collision, the Blood Blade Island Master’s pupils suddenly shrank. In the next moment, a terrifying force crushed his saber light easily and continued to strike his divine body.

Sou!

The Blood Blade Island Master was like a meteor falling from the sky and crashed into the sea below.

A moment later, he rushed out of the sea again.

However, after he rushed out of the sea, the madness and killing intent on his face had disappeared. What replaced it was shock.

“This guy is clearly just a Divine Master, but his strength is completely superior to mine?”

“He’s too strong. His strength is too strong, and his speed is also far faster than mine. I don’t even have a 10% chance of winning in a fight with him. Let’s run!”

Without any hesitation, the Blood Blade Island Master immediately turned around and fled.

Since he was like this, the remaining undying saints on the Blood Blade Island, who had long been scared out of their wits, naturally fled frantically.

Jian Wushuang, on the other hand, watched them flee. He had no intention of pursuing them.

He only slowly went forward to collect his spoils of war.

It should be known that he had just killed a total of eight Immortal Saints in an instant.

This was also the largest number of Immortal Saints he had killed since he began cultivating.

Even though the eight Immortal Saints were only False Saints and each of them had an average wealth of about one million sacred elixirs, it was still a considerable harvest.

After all of this was done, Jian Wushuang turned to look at Qin Dong, Uncle Lei, and the others.

It was a slow scene. In fact, from Jian Wushuang slaughtering the eight Immortal Saints to forcing the Blood Blade Island Master to flee in panic, it was all done in a very short time.

Qin Dong, Uncle Lei, and their guards were already stunned by the scene in front of them.

To be exact, they were not stunned, but completely stunned!

More than 30 experts, more than 10 Immortal Saints, and even the Master of Blood Blade Island, a powerful True Saint at the peak of stage one, were all sent out by Blood Blade Island. They had no confidence in dealing with such a huge lineup.

Qin Dong and Uncle Lei were even praying that Jian Wushuang would be able to hold off the Master of Blood Blade Island for a while.

But what happened?

In a split second, in a split second.

More than half of the experts of the Blood Blade Island had been killed, and only a few had escaped. The Blood Blade Island Master had been pushed back, and he had also fled in panic.

And the one who had done all this was Heavenly Sword Marquis, who was only exuding the aura of a Divine Master?

“He, he…” Qin Dong pointed at Jian Wushuang, his eyes glazed over. He did not know what to say.

“Young master, watch your behavior. Don’t anger this lord,” Uncle Lei shouted.

Qin Dong was stunned, but he immediately realized what had happened and quickly withdrew his finger. However, he still could not calm down for a long time. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

After a long time, Uncle Lei managed to calm down. After exhaling, he walked toward Jian Wushuang.

“Thank you, Lord Heavenly Sword Marquis, for helping my young master defeat the Blood Blade Island,” Uncle Lei said in awe.

“I’m just trying to complete my task. There’s no need to thank me.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand and said, “Alright, let’s continue.”

After saying that, Jian Wushuang did not look back and directly rushed forward.

Qin Dong, Uncle Lei, and the others immediately followed him.

In contrast, Qin Dong and the others were nervous and worried that they would not be able to leave the Godless Sea area alive.

But now that they had witnessed Jian Wushuang’s strength, their emotions disappeared instantly.

“Uncle Lei, we have come to the right person,” Qin Dong whispered.

“Yes, we have come to the right person. Heavenly Sword Marquis is indeed very powerful. Judging from the battle strength he just displayed, he has at least the battle strength of a peak rank one True Saint. He is even very powerful among peak rank one True Saints. At least, the Island Master of Blood Blade Island is no match for him. With his protection, we should be able to leave the Godless Sea area smoothly,” Uncle Lei said with a smile.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis is very powerful, but I’m curious. Is he really just a Divine Master, or has he been hiding his aura all this time?” Qin Dong frowned.

“Well…he should be hiding his aura. If he’s really just a Divine Master, then his talent is too terrifying. Such a terrifying genius has already entered the legendary three palaces of Heaven-cleaving Alliance. How could he appear here?” Uncle Lei said, he also thought that Jian Wushuang should have concealed his aura.

“Then why did he conceal his aura? I feel that concealing his aura is not of much use.” Qin Dong asked in puzzlement.

“Who knows? Maybe Heavenly Sword Marquis is used to playing the pig to eat the tiger?” Uncle Lei said.

Qin Dong was startled, then he smiled. “Forget it. Whether Heavenly Sword Marquis conceals his aura or not has nothing to do with us. As long as we can leave the Godless Sea area in peace, we will be fine. When we return to the clan and resolve the internal conflict, I will lead the experts of the clan to wipe out the Godless Sea area and turn the four overlords of the Godless Sea area into stray dogs!”

Uncle Lei could not help but smile.

Because of Jian Wushuang’s absolute strength, Qin Dong, Uncle Lei, and the guards were much more relaxed. But in fact, Jian Wushuang knew that his mission was not so simple, he would probably encounter a lot of trouble later.
