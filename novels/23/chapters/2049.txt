2050 Yellow Sand Realm

Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Demon King Chen Yu is pretty impressive!”

Jian Wushuang’s face grew glum as he looked at the surrounding yellow sand realm. He could feel how sturdy the yellow sand realm was.

Within the yellow sand realm, an ordinary Great Emperor or even a Great Emperor that was on Ling Zong level, might not stand a chance to escape.

However, Jian Wushuang was different.

“You want to make me stay with that kind of trick? You’re dreaming!” Jian Wushuang roared. He waved his eighteen arms at the same time and slashed at the yellow sand realm.

It was a round of brutal hits.

The fierce sword lights slashed at the yellow sand realm and it began to quiver vigorously. However, it wasn’t damaged.

Jian Wushuang didn’t give up but instantly began his second round of attacks.

“Boy, die!”

Just as Jian Wushuang attacked the yellow sand realm crazily, Demon King Chen Yu appeared behind him and there was a fierce attack that instantly descended.

Jian Wushuang had no choice but to block Demon King’s attack while he figured out a way to break the yellow sand realm.

Their fight was extremely fierce.

Outside the yellow sand realm, Ling Zong and the other thirteen Great Emperors were watching

They could see the huge yellow sand realm in front of them. However, they didn’t know what was happening within the yellow sand realm.

They couldn’t see with their naked eyes, nor could they probe with their soul power. They could only hear the terrifying roars and clanging noises from the yellow sand realm that struck fear into them.

The roaring continued for dozens of breaths of time.

Finally…

Hong!

There was another loud bang. There was a huge hole that tore open on the yellow sand realm. Jian Wushuang plunged out of the hole and leaped.

Demon King Chen Yu looked angry and he reined back yellow sand realm as jade ruler. He went to pursue Jian Wushuang again.

As Demon King Chen Yu was chasing after him, he commanded, “Immediately arrange for people to set up in front to stop Jian Wushuang. Otherwise, we’ll likely lose him!!”

Demon King Chen Yu was offended when he gave that command.

He was taking care of Jian Wushuang personally.

Since he was Jian Wushuang personally, he was determined to win. However, after the vigorous fight in the yellow sand realm, Demon King Chen Yu wouldn’t be able to kill Jian Wushuang by himself.

“This boy’s defense is too strong!!”

Demon King Chen Yu clenched his hands and he was still thinking of the scene that had happened in the yellow sand realm.

In the yellow sand realm, Jian Wushuang was fighting with him while he was thinking of a way to break the yellow sand realm in the beginning.

But not long after, Jian Wushuang seemed to see how sturdy the yellow sand realm was and he knew that he would need a long time to break the realm if he continued to fight. Hence, he made an insane decision, which was to ignore Demon King Chen Yu’s attack. He didn’t bother about Demon King Chen Yu’s brutal attacks and let them hit his divine body.

Jian Wushuang focused on the yellow sand realm directly.

After a few rounds of attack, he finally broke a hole in the yellow sand realm.

As he was trying to break into the yellow sand realm, he took almost one hundred of Demon King Chen Yu’s attacks.

Based on Demon King Chen Yu’s terrifying power, if one hit of his were to land on the divine body of an ordinary Great Emperor, those who had weaker defense powers would have been dead. Even those who were stronger wouldn’t survive after two to three hits.

However, Jian Wushuang had taken almost a hundred of Demon King Chen Yu’s hits.

Just how insane was his defense power?

With Jian Wushuang’s defense power, as long as he wasn’t stupid enough to fight vigorously with Demon King Chen Yu, he could totally escape.

Hence, Demon King Chen Yu commanded the Great Emperors in Three-Emperors World to stop Jian Wushuang at the front.

As long as they trapped Jian Wushuang and left him no chance to escape, no matter how powerful his defensive power was, he would reach his limit. By then, it would be Jian Wushuang’s death.

Jian Wushuang looked like he was still at his peak and his aura wasn’t weakened at all. On top of that, his running speed was equally shocking.

But he looked extremely solemn.

“Demon King Chen Yu’s attack power is so strong,” Jian Wushuang muttered. He couldn’t help but steal a glance at Demon King Chen Yu behind him.

After he reached the second stage, his divine power had increased tremendously again. In addition to Five Gem Armor, his defense power was terrifyingly powerful.

If it was an ordinary Great Emperor or an extremely powerful Great Emperor, like Ling Zong, who hit him, it would just feel like a scratch. He wouldn’t care much about it. Even if there were a hundred attacks, he could be at ease.

However, Demon King Chen Yu’s hundred attacks in the yellow sand region severely injured his divine body.

Although his severely injured divine body could be quickly recovered with his divine power. Jian Wushuang’s divine power had expanded tremendously. During the time in the yellow sand realm, Jian Wushuang’s divine power had gone by thirty percent.

If a similar situation were to happen a few more times, he was afraid that he couldn’t take it.

However, luckily, he escaped from the yellow sand realm. Then, Demon King Chen Yu was only following behind him. Even if he caught up with him, he wouldn’t be able to stop him.

“Now, I only need to figure out a way to get to the border of Three-Emperors World and meet up with the experts of Sanctuary Alliance,” Jian Wushuang muttered and there was a strange gleam twinkling in his eyes.

He plunged at a high speed. Judging from his travel direction, he was obviously charging at Bronze Heart Region.

Bronze Heart Region was a region closest to the border in Three-Emperors World.

Emperor Bai commanded the Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance to rush to Bronze Heart Region to meet with Jian Wushuang.

Then, in the vast void in Bronze Heart Region, there was a total of seven figures standing side by side.

The seven people’s auras were fierce. They were all Great Emperors and they weren’t Great Emperors from Sanctuary Alliance but from Three-Emperors World.

The seven Great Emperors from Three-Emperors World floated solemnly as they looked at the sky afar. They were obviously for something.

They were naturally waiting for Jian Wushuang’s arrival.

However, Jian Wushuang was still quite far away from Bronze Heart Region.

Even the Great Emperors from Sanctuary Alliance had just departed not long ago. They probably had yet to pass through the outer layer of the dark millstone to enter Three-Emperor World, let alone to get to Jian Wushuang in Bronze Heart Region.

However, Three-Emperors World had assigned a total of seven Great Emperors to wait there. The seven of them who knew battle formations.
