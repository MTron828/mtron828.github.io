Chapter 411: The Inner Area

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“I’ve never been to Inner Area, but I do know something about it since I’ve been on the battlefield for a long time.”?Sir Axe handed a file to Jian Wushuang. “This is information on the experts who adventure there all year round.”

“Information on experts?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up as he took the file. “Thanks a lot!”

“Hey, guys, I have to go now.”

Jian Wushuang exchanged some words Sir Axe, bid his farewells to the rest and departed.

Sir Axe, Lei Dao, and Shi Ling watched Jian Wushuang’s retreating figure with complex expressions writ over their faces.

“Inner Area,” Lei Dao muttered, “when can I take my adventure there? I really envy Swordsman.”

“When you’ve condensed three Origin Marks and stepped into Stage Three, you can go,” Sir Axe looked at Lei Dao and said.

Lei Dao smiled bitterly.

Condensing an Origin Mark was a difficult process. At present, Lei Dao had condensed only one mark, so he didn’t know if that day would come.

“Well, now Swordsman is gone. Without his Realm Technique, our team will be weakened significantly. Let’s go back to our camp before making further plans.” Sir Axe suggested.

“Ok.”

The others nodded at Sir Axe’s words.

On the vast Flaming Battlefield, Jian Wushuang read the file that Sir Axe had given him as he slowly walked forward.

He wasn’t worried about running into trouble at Outer Area as the experts would only be at Stage Two.?If they caused him trouble, they were courting death.

“Inner Area is not as vast as Outer Area, but the killing there is crueler and the experts there are numerous.”?Jian Wushuang was excited.

From the file, he gleaned a lot of useful information.

The data covered over a thousand experts who fought in Inner Area.

These experts were either at Stage Three and had condensed three Origin Marks or had excellent techniques with mighty power equivalent to Stage Three. Jian Wushuang belonged to the latter category.

The strength of different experts at Stage Three would differ.

In the file, Stage Three experts were divided into three groups: ordinary level, high level, and the top level.

Between levels, there was a small but not negligible difference in strength.

In addition to this, the file had also recorded six experts at Heaven-defying Level, but they only showed up in Inner Area occasionally.

“Heaven-defying Level!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed.

Most of experts at this level had awoken their souls like Jian Wushuang and were super geniuses. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Few such experts could be found in one Domain, so it was really rare to see six such geniuses on Flaming Battlefield.

“With my current power and the power from my active Sword Soul, I should be at the ordinary level of Stage Three. I should be able to survive on the battlefield unless I encounter an expert at Heaven-defying Level. Not even a top expert at Stage Three can kill me now.”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself as he approached the Inner Area.

Several days later, Jian Wushuang arrived at his destination.

Compared to the Outer Area, the air in the Inner Area was hotter and filled with more red mist.

“When will I meet my first opponent in Inner Area?”?Jian Wushuang wandered around expectantly.

In Inner Area, an encounter with an expert depended on chance.

With a bit of luck, he might meet two or three experts from rival camps in a single day.

Otherwise, he might have to adventure in vain for a prolonged period.

In the void, a slender elder in green robes walked forward. His face was expressionless.

His pace appeared slow, but with each step, he crossed hundreds of meters. In the space of several steps, he crossed mountains and plains.

Just as the elder passed a mountain, he noticed a black-robed youth who was moving slowly not far away.

“I can’t sense his token. He’s an enemy.”?The elder narrowed his eyes, which were as sharp as an eagle’s eyes.

Taking one step forward, the elder drew close to the youth.

“Eh?” The youth, Jian Wushuang, raised his head when he sensed the elder. He smiled.

“Lucky me. I’ve been in Inner Area only for half a day, and here comes my target.”Jian Wushuang smirked as he quickly recalled the information on related experts.

The file that Sir Axe had given him included portraits of the experts.

That information helped Jian Wushuang recognize the elder.

“Wind Demon.” Jian Wushuang’s smile widened.

“Boy, I’ve never seen you before. Are you a newcomer?” the elder stared at Jian Wushuang with a frown.

Experts like the elder had been in Inner Area for a long time and were familiar with each other, so new faces stood out to them.

“I’m Swordsman, and you are the first person I’m meeting in this place,” Jian Wushuang said flatly.

“Swordsman? Never heard of you,” said Wind Demon coldly, “Not everyone deserves to be in Inner Area, but since you are here, let’s see whether you’re qualified to make a living on this land.”

As the elder’s words fell, a fierce wind rolled up from his body. A strong aura rose like a storm and encircled him.

Boom! The storm stirred the air and swept toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang looked impassive. He stood still and looked at the storm with his eyes flickering.

“This will be my first battle in Inner Area.”

“It’ll also be my first battle in Divine Land that I’ll have to try my best to fight.”

“Wind Demon, don’t let me down.”
