Chapter 149: Three Sword Moves

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

All the people in the Martial Arts Practice Field looked towards the spot where they heard that voice.

A stout man with bronze skin stood there, with his hands folded and a Battle Axe on his back. His body radiated an irritable aura and anger was burning in his eyes at this moment.

“It’s him!”

“Luo Ang.”

“Ranked 14th on the Earthly Dragon List.”

Many disciples and seniors were watching this with great interest.

Jian Wushuang looked at the stout man and recognized him immediately.

Among the seniors of Dragon Palace, Luo Ang, ranking 14th on the Earthly Dragon List. He was at the top of the list, if you didn’t count Baili Chen and Qing Cang.?It’s no wonder he would speak out against Jian Wushuang.

“Luo Ang, what are you dissatisfied about?” Palace Master White asked and frowned.

“Palace Master White, I agree with what you said about striving for the 10 recommendations with our strength. But you gave three recommendations directly, without going through the competition...” Luo Ang said in a low voice.

“I have nothing to say about Baili Chen and Qing Cang as their strengths are universally acknowledged. But Jian Wushuang is a young and inexperienced kid who has only defeated Ouyang Haoyue and ranked 10th on the Earthly Dragon List because of good luck. It won’t be convincing if he automatically gets a recommendation.”

“Then what do you want to do?” Palace Master White asked with squinting eyes.

“It’s very simple. Let him have a front-to-back battle with me. If he can beat me, I will say nothing,” Luo Ang said directly.

What he said caused intense excitement.

Jian Wushuang touched his nose unintentionally and smiled inside his heart,“I’m afraid that Luo Ang is not unconvinced about the recommendation I got but my 10th rank on the Earthly Dragon List.”

Jian Wushuang had predicted that it would cause resentment and doubts after he ranked 10th on the Earthly Dragon List, especially by the experts who ranked 11th to 20th as they would not believe their strength was weaker than his.

And Luo Ang, who ranked 14th on the Earthly Dragon List, was among them.

“Jian Wushuang, what do you think?” Palace Master White looked at Jian Wushuang and asked.

“Since he is doubtful about my strength and wants to fight with me, then let’s fight,” Jian Wushuang answered, accepting it directly.

“Well then, you two have a fair fight. But remember?to stop where you should,” said Palace Master White.

Both Jian Wushuang and Luo Ang nodded their heads, and all the disciples around them began to back away.

“Third brother, are you sure?” Wang Yuan asked and frowned.

“Rest assured,” Jian Wushuang answered, then smiled.

“Your third brother possesses great strength, so it won’t be a problem for him to defeat Luo Ang,” said Su Lie.

He had witnessed how Jian Wushuang defeated Ouyang Haoyue. Naturally, he was more sure about Jian Wushuang’s strength. No one else had witnessed that battle, so they had no idea about how wide the gap between Ouyang Haoyue and Jian Wushuang was. Of course they would doubt Jian Wushuang’s ranking.

But Su Lie, who had witnessed the scene, had no doubt. He even believed that Jian Wushuang should rank higher.

“Boy, though the Golden-dragon Palace put you in the 10th place on the Earthly Dragon List, don’t take it seriously. Sometimes the Golden-dragon Palace makes mistakes. Today I will let you know that it’s not a big deal to defeat Ouyang Haoyue,” Luo Ang stood in front of Jian Wushuang while speaking coldly.

“Perhaps, but... I don’t have so much nonsense to say.” Just as Jian Wushuang finished speaking, a figure had already dashed out.

“Hum~~~! ”

While radiating Sword Essence of Earth, Jian Wushuang lifted the Triple-kill sword and rushed forward as well. A terrifying power instantly gathered and a mighty sword shadow raged.

The 11th move of the Formless Sword Wave!

As the sword shadow rushed out, the surrounding disciples of Dragon Palace all felt dazed by its vast power.

The first and second volume of the Formless Sword Wave only contained 14 moves, and Jian Wushuang was able to display the 11th move easily. How deep was his comprehension in the Sword Essence of Earth?

“With this move, he could easily pass through the 11th layer of the Dragon Gate. What’s more, he’s said to perceive the Earth, Gale, and Raging Fire Essences at the same time,” said someone in the area. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

While watching this vast sword shadow approach, Luo Ang sneered.

“Hum, you are a warrior in the Profound Gold Core Realm. Even daring to actually fight against me, do you want to die?”

The Battle Axe behind Luo Ang also appeared in his hands. He lifted it up and then slashed it down.

It was extremely domineering and seemed like it could break a mountain.

The power of the Exception Gold Core Realm was perfectly displayed.

After that, the two collided.

BANG!

After that loud noise, Luo Ang’s expression suddenly changed.

He discovered that the power of the vast sword shadow Jian Wushuang displayed was not weaker than the power from his Giant Axe. Not only that, it was actually stronger!

During the confrontation, the Axe Shadow he displayed was defeated.

“How can he, a warrior in the Profound Gold Core Realm, possess such strength?”

Luo Ang had no time to show his shock as Jian Wushuang attacked him with another sword move.

This move was very fierce and rapid. It was obviously the Sword Skill of Blood and Fire, with a power that was greater than the Sword Essence of Earth that was displayed a moment ago.

Luo Ang immediately fought back with the Battle Axe, but when the Battle Axe collided with the sword shadow, it was blasted away. Luo Ang’s body was also instantly knocked back at that moment.

Suddenly, there was a streak of light in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“Formless Sword Art... Seventh move.”

CHUU!

A cold sword light appeared at that moment, and the surrounding world seemed to become completely dark.

In the darkness, there was only the sword light.

This sword light passed by Luo Ang at an astonishing speed.

Luo Ang had no time to react. By the time he regained his balance, Jian Wushuang was already standing behind him, sheathing the Triple-kill Sword. At the same time, Luo Ang noticed a few hairs near his ear were falling down.

Luo Ang was stunned.

Not only him, many of the surrounding disciples, and even the seniors, were all stunned.

He had been defeated.

Luo Ang was defeated.

And it was an extremely miserable defeat.

Three sword moves!

Yes, Jian Wushuang used a total of three moves. That was all it took, Luo Ang was defeated. What was worse, if Jian Wushuang had not shown mercy, he would have died under those three sword moves.

The gap was too wide!

“Oh, it seems that this little guy’s strength is even greater than we expected.” Palace Master White was not surprised at all. Instead, she turned to speak with the Temple Masters behind her.

“Indeed, we all knew he would have no problem defeating Luo Ang. But we did not expect him to defeat Luo Ang with only three sword moves. 10th rank might still be a little low.”
