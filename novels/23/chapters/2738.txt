Chapter 2739: Deeply Hidden

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Boom!

Saber Master’s aura was extremely violent as he gradually got closer to Long Xianzi.

“Saber Master, don’t you force me. You’ll have a terrible time if you push me too hard.” Long Xianzi suddenly yelled out loudly with a black bead in her hand. The black bead looked like a normal steel ball.

However, Saber Master was not the only one who could feel the horrendous destructive power from this black bead once it appeared. Even Jian Wushuang and Devilish Wind King in the void further away felt so.

“What’s that?” The Saber Master was stunned.

“This is the second precious item I’ve obtained from this secret realm—a Meteorite Bead. The first item is the Bronze Mirror that can release the Golden Light Domain while the other one is this Meteorite Bead. The Meteorite Bead is a domineeringly powerful single-use precious item. Its power is comparable to a full-strength blow of a Peak Grand Ultimate God. Saber Master, try it if you dare. The most terrible ending is a life and death struggle between the two of us!!” Long Xianzi acted as if she was crazy.

“Haha... A life and death struggle between us? You think too highly of yourself if you plan to scare me off by simply taking a bead out. What a joke? It’s best if you just accept your death.” Saber Master laughed loudly and did not slow down his speed.

Finally, he arrived behind Long Xianzi and waved the crimson battle in his hands.

Long Xianzi’s facial expression changed drastically as her beautiful eyes were filled with unprecedented madness and despair.

“Let’s die together then!!” A wretched scream could be heard reverberating across the sky as Long Xianzi activated her divine power with the black bead in her hand that floated some distance forward.

A wave of horrendous destructive power then immediately exploded from the black bead!!

The skies and land were ruined!!

The entire dark void was completely covered by the wave of destructive energy.

The humongous golden prison Jian Wushuang created was instantly destroyed at that moment.

The horrendous power was still crazily sweeping across such that it even affected Jian Wushuang and Devilish Wind King who were at the edge.

Jian Wushuang and Devilish Win King’s expression drastically darkened as they had to immediately retreat in a risky way to avoid the power.

The black void in front of them had been destroyed and was in complete silence.

“Such power!” Jian Wushuang could not help but exclaim.

Devilish Wind King exclaimed, “Long Xianzi was right. Meteorite Bead’s explosive power just now was comparable to a Peak Grand Ultimate God’s full-strength attack. It’s really powerful! I only wonder if Saber Master had died under such dangerous circumstances.”

Both Jian Wushuang and Devilish Wind King focused on the void in front of them.

The area’s situation soon appeared in their line of sight.

The dark void had regained its peace with Long Xianzi completely disappeared in the middle of the void.

She had disappeared from being completely crushed by the horrendous power.

However, Saber Master was still standing in the void.

It could be seen that Saber Master was slightly pale with some blood trickling on the edge of his mouth. However, the aura on his body had not been weakened. The purple clock was still engulfing his entire body despite growing dull from withstanding the crazy attack just moments ago.

It could be seen that Saber Master had managed to withstand the terrifying power just moments ago and was not badly hurt.

The Bronze Mirror and Long Xianzi’s Interspatial Ring fell into the Saber Master’s hands with the wave of his hand.

Saber Master’s cold eyes then looked over to Jian Wushuang and Devilish Wind King with killing intent.

“Hong Chen and Long Xianzi are dead. Both of you will be next.” Saber Master had a snicker on his face.

Jian Wushuang and Devilish Wind King had darkened expressions on their faces.

“Alliance Master Su Han, don’t hide any means that you have and use them all. Both of us might then have a chance to survive if we fight together,” Devilish Wind King yelled from the side.

“Fight together?” Jian Wushuang smirked before his body trembled and completely unleashed his understanding of Space-time Law as he instantly retreated.

“Alliance Master Su Han!!” Devilish Wind King was startled before mumbling to himself, ‘What a scum!!’

He originally thought Jian Wushuang would join him and try their best to fight Saber Master but did not expect Jian Wushuang would choose to immediately escape. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Saber Master laughed heartily when he saw that. “Haha... Su Han is really smart. He’s well-versed in Space-time Law so he’s quite fast. I’m not confident in killing him if he truly wants to escape in this dark void. However, Devilish Wind King—you don’t plan to run even when Su Han escapes?”

Saber Master looked at Devilish Wind King with great interest.

Devilish Wind King initially looked grim but soon had some slight changes to his facial expressions.

He seemed to be extremely frightened previously as though he was intimidated by Saber Master’s power. However, his expression had softened at the moment he was left alone to face Saber Master despite Hong Chen and Long Xianzi being killed while Jian Wushuang chose to escape from the fight.

A soft smile even started to grow on his face.

Devilish Wind King coldly said, “Saber Master, you’ve thought too highly of yourself. How are you worthy of forcing me to escape?”

Saber Master narrowed his eyes. “Oh, Devilish Wind King? Although you’re only a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God, you’re quite famous in the Danyang Continent. However, you’ve always been extremely cunning which seems to be the truth. You must’ve some last resort that you’ve never used despite encouraging others to take action.”

“You’ve been observing from the side previously when Hong Chen, Long Xianzi, and Su Han joined forces to kill me. You even wanted to make Su Han fight me with his full strength after I’ve shown my true strength by killing Hong Chen and Long Xianzi. Haha... You keep making us fight each other while you gain profits without doing anything. What a great plan.

“I just wonder if your last resort is strong enough and if you’re planning to face me alone.” Saber Master stared at Devilish Wind King but dared not underestimate him.

He was able to see the Devilish Wind King had been scheming against them since the beginning.

He had been encouraging them to fight but never showed any of his methods.

Devilish Wind King planned to only show his means at the moment Hong Chen and Long Xianzi died while Jian Wushuang escaped to the distant void.

The Saber Master was certain the Devilish Wind King relied on something but he had no idea what it was.

“Saber Master, you aren’t too stupid. Unfortunately, the others aren’t as smart as you.” Devilish Wind King smiled lightly and waved his hand.

A figure appeared beside him out of nowhere.

Saber Master’s originally quite calm facial expression suddenly changed when he saw the person’s sudden appearance. “Devilish Wind King, you’ve hidden your intentions so deeply!!!
