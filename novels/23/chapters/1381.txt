Chapter 1382: Soul Master Hall

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“I will not take any disciples. However, if I come across any suitable Soul Master, I shall recommend him to you.” Jian Wushuang said casually.

“Thank you, Master,” Xue Feng and Xue Tong expressed their gratitude.

“Oh yeah, in the town on the border of the forest, is there a Soul Master Hall?” Jian Wushuang asked.

After familiarizing himself with Xue Feng’s troop in the past few days, Jian Wushuang found out that the place with the most Soul Masters gathering together was the Soul Master Hall.

In Tian Ling Land, many Soul Masters were required to get recognition from Soul Master Hall or to pass through the examination.

Jian Wushuang wanted to familiarize himself with Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack and he had to communicate more with other Soul Masters. Visiting the Soul Master Hall would be the best choice.

“In the nearby town, the only Soul Master Hall is in White Sun Town. If you want to head there, we can bring you over. It happens to be time for my sister to sit for a test in Soul Master Hall to become a real one-starred Soul Master,” Xue Feng said.

“Let’s go together then,” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

Xue Feng’s troop continued their journey together.

After they exited the forest, it only took one day’s time to arrive at White Sun Town.

As the only town that had Soul Master Hall in the nearby towns, White Sun Town was rather busy.

A lofty black castle was where the Soul Master Hall was located.

“Master Wushuang, that’s Soul Master Hall. You can enter with my sister. We shall wait outside,” Xue Feng said.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded. Then, he entered the black castle with Xue Tong.

In the lobby of the castle, it was rather crowded. There were many Soul Masters that gathered together and chatting among themselves. At the same time, there were people queuing up in the middle of the lobby. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“These people came to become Soul Masters,” Jian Wushuang looked at people in the long queue and he smiled.

“Master Wushuang, let’s go and queue,” Xue Tong obviously couldn’t wait.

Jian Wushuang and Xue Tong started waiting in the queue. Soon, it was their turn.

“You go ahead first,” Jian Wushuang said.

Xue Tong nodded and went forward.

“In one breath, fill up the crystal with your consciousness. Then, you can consider yourself to have passed through fundamental recognition. Then, you will be qualified to join the one-starred Soul Master examination,” the man in the black robe passed a purple crystal to Xue Tong.

Xue Tong took a deep breath and covered the crystal with her consciousness in the next instance.

In a while, the purple crystal was shimmering with purple brilliance.

“Mm, not bad.”

The man in the black robe took out a token and passed it to Xue Tong, “Take this token and wait by the side. There’ll be someone to bring you to the examination later.”

“Thanks,” Xue Tong took the token and thanked him. She then walked to the side and waited.

“Next,” the man in the black robe said lazily.

Jian Wushuang walked forward.

“Same goes to you. Fill this crystal in one breath,” the man in the black robe said coldly.

Jian Wushuang took over the purple crystal and fiddled with it in his hands. He then put it down and said with a smile, “Your crystal can only recognize one-starred Soul Masters, right?”

The man in the black robe was stunned and recalled her sloppy attitude earlier. He revealed a smiled and asked, “Unless you want to receive recognition of being a two-starred Soul Master?

“Two-starred Soul Master?” Jian Wushuang smiled, “No, I want to receive recognition of a three-starred Soul Master!”

“Three-starred?” The man in black robe stared.

Everyone in the lobby looked at Jian Wushuang.

Three-starred Soul Master was almost non-existent in the nearby towns of White Sun Town.

“Mas- master, you want to receive recognition as a three-starred Soul Master?” The man in the black robe’s voice was shivering.

“Why, can’t I?” Jian Wushuang smiled and said.

“No, no, but…” The man in black robe was stuttering.

Just then…

“What’s going on?” An old voice suddenly rang out and an elderly with white hair and a beard who looked like he had a divine demeanor walked forward slowly.

“Master He!”

“Soul Master He!”

“He was the only Peak two-starred Soul Master in White Sun Town!”

The moment he arrived in the lobby, everyone looked surprised and they looked like they revered him.

“Soul Master He?” Xue Tong was shocked too. There was passion burning in her eyes.

Before she met Jian Wushuang, the only Soul Master that she had heard of and talked about was Soul Master He.

The elderly with white hair and beard walked to the middle of the lobby. The man in the black robe immediately bowed and said, “Soul Master He, this is the man who wanted to receive recognition for being a three-starred Soul Master.”

“Three-starred?” The elderly with white hair and beard suddenly contracted his pupils.

Three-starred Soul Master was a level that he himself had yet to reach.

“Greetings from I, He Chang. I wonder what your name might be?” Soul Master acted rather humbly.

“Jian Wushuang,’ Jian Wushaung said lightly.

Soul Master He was stunned and realized that he had never before heard Jian Wushuang’s name.

“My friend, three-starred Soul Master is an extremely high existence on Tian Ling Land. In White Sun Town, there was never anyone who possessed the power to receive recognition for three-starred Soul Master. However… I can get in touch with the headquarters of Soul Master Hall for them to send someone over.”

“But, before I sent a message, I must know if you possess the qualification to sit for the three-starred Soul Master examination,” Soul Master He said.

“This will do,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly.

“Then, please reveal your consciousness,” Soul Master He said.

Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate and activated his consciousness. Boundless Soul Power surged and formed into a purple tiger instantly, then charged out.

“Huh?”

Soul Master creased his eyebrows and there was suddenly a buzz before him. A long spear that was formed by consciousness appeared from nowhere.

Hong!

A long spear hit the purple tiger directly. The two were stunned for a second before they collapsed one after another.

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and erupted a terrifying Soul Constrain the very next moment.

Rumble.

The Soul Power covered Soul Master He like a thunderbolt. Soul Master He was like a lone boat in a storm and he started shaking.

Everyone in the lobby could feel the terrifying Soul Constrain from Jian Wushuang and they revealed faces of terror.

“Humph!”

After emitting a low humph, Soul Master He grew pale.

Jian Wushuang then reined in his Soul Constrain and everything resumed tranquility.

“Such strong consciousness!”

Soul Master He let out a breath of relief and turned to look at Jian Wushuang, “Your consciousness is really fierce and much stronger than any ordinary three-starred Soul Master. But… If I’m not mistaken, your usage of consciousness was rather inexperienced.”
