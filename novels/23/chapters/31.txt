BANG!

Jian Wushuang sparked Spiritual Power that could match the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm.

Applying the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill,his Cultivation immediately reached the Peak of the Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path.

His present Spiritual Power could almost match the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. Because of the advantages of the Heavenly Creation skill, the Peak of the Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path had nearly the same power as the Peak of the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm for normal Warriors.

“Wh- what happened here?”

“How did his Spiritual Power become so strong?”

All those present were in awe.

They were wondering how Jian Wushuang had become so strong all of a sudden. However, if they looked under the floor, they would find that all the creatures within 100 meters of Jian Wushuang had died.

“What? He is actually retaining his strength?!”

Jian Meng’er who had retreated to the Drill Ground trembled with fright when he saw the aggressive figure from behind.

Jian Wushuang’s look changed completely. His ruthless eyes were fastened on Ye Mo. He was aware that using the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill did great harm to his body, and the pain in his body would grow with each passing minute. He had to end this fight as quickly as possible.

“Kill!”

Jian Wushuang soared,and the Long Sword turned into a ghastly force.

PING!

Sword light shone, cold and glaring.

It was still the First Move of the Anonymous Sword Art, Blood Shadow.

Jian Wushuang defeated Jian Meng’er in a single move. The extraordinary speed of the Sword Art amazed everyone, and the present speed was obviously faster because of Jian Wushuang’s growing Cultivation.

“It’s too fast to think about.”

“Hmm!”

Ye Mo hummed with remarkable noble spirit, and a magnificent sword light appeared.

What Ye Mo used was the Boundless Heaven Sword Art.

But Ye Mo used the Boundless Heavens Sword Art in a much more flexible manner than Jian Meng’er.

This was because Jian Meng’er had just begun to train in the Boundless Heaven Sword Art. Ye Mo, grew up studying the Sword Art in the Tianyuan Sword Sect. They obviously had a different level of understanding towards the Sword Art.

It was still a fight between the Giant of Heaven and Earth and the King of Assassination.

However, Jian Wushuang’s first move, Blood Shadow, met the magnificent sword light instead of going around it, causing these two strong forces to erupt.

It was apparent that the advantage of Jian Wushuang’s first move, Blood Shadow, was its amazing speed. But it still fell behind the Boundless Heaven Sword Art in terms of strength and power.

After the collision of these two swords, the cold and shining sword light darkened quickly with the overwhelming crush following.

“It didn’t work?” Jian Wushuang was disappointed.

“The advantage of your Sword Art lies in the speed, but it lacks in strength. My Junior Sister has been practicing the Boundless Heaven Sword Art for only a short time, thus she didn’t have a deep understanding of it. This caused her defeat. I am much better!”

Ye Mo’s look was ruthless, and he said in a low voice, “Jian Wushuang, you must think your Sword Art is very swift, yes? I will show you what real speed is.”

Ye Mo turned into a Flowing Light as soon as he finished his words.

WAH!

Ye Mo appeared in front of Jian Wushuang swiftly with his sword light.

Both the body and the sword were like Flowing Light.

“How fast!”

“It is so fast!”

A large group of disciples in a Marquis’s mansion were astonished.

“This is one of the four Ultimate Sword Arts of the Tianyuan Sword Sect, Flowing Light Sword Art. It is famous for its speed.” Bai Chong was marveled in the stand.

The four Ultimate Sword Arts of the Tianyuan Sword Sect were all First-class Sword Arts, so once each of them was practiced to a certain degree, they would be extremely terrifying.

As for the Flowing Light Sword Art, its advantage was speed.

It was so fast that the sword light became many shadows and twisted in the air. It looked like it was being swept by the sword light.

Jian Wushuang’s expression was very serious. When Ye Mo’s Sword Art came toward him, he used Aurora Sword Art first.

Speed was extremely important in the Aurora Sword Art, and Jian Wushuang had mastered it.

The Sword Art was extremely fast when it was used.

CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

Numerous consecutive clashes could be heard, but it was obvious that Ye Mo’s Flowing Light Sword Art was faster. Although Jian Wushuang tried his best, Aurora Sword Art was only a First-class Sword Art, while the Flowing Light Sword Art was a supreme Sword Art. it was even known as an Ultimate Sword Art in the Tianyuan Sword Sect, which mainly studied Sword Principle.

There was a big gap between the level of these two Sword Arts, so even though Jian Wushuang had mastered the Aurora Sword Art, he still could not gain an advantage.

In the arena, Jian Wushuang was forced to retreat continuously. Then suddenly, a fierce chop instead of the usual sword jab came towards Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang immediately noticed. He raised his Long Sword naturally, meeting the fierce sword shadow with his body sinking slightly, and then he retreated very quickly.

“Jian Wushuang, your swordsmanship is not so great.” Ye Mo glared at Jian Wushuang ruthlessly. “If your strength is like this, then the battle is over.”

Just as Ye Mo finished speaking, a strong sword essence suddenly burst from him. He moved the Long Sword in his hand slowly. With this move, a huge dim shadow with a height of over 10 meters appeared from behind. The Long Sword was moving with Ye Mo.

Finally, the Sword Art had matured.

“Boundless Heavens Sword Art, Legendary Maneuver!”

Ye Mo slashed suddenly with the Long Sword in his hand. The enormous sword shadow was also wavering.

This sword seemed to be able to split the world in half.

The strong power left the crowd breathless. The horrible sword essence could destroy nearly everything. All the people on the Drill Ground were amazed.

“Not good.”

Bai Chong was in the arena. His expression became serious and the Spiritual Power appeared in his hands. He was ready to save Jian Wushuang. However, he became hesitant as soon as he saw Jian Wushuang’s expression.

Jian Wushuang’s expression was very subtle, with hints of seriousness and surprise, but mostly excitement.

“Is he going to use the Eleventh Move?”

Jian Wushuang stared at the strong sword light coming toward him. At this moment, a deep awareness of crisis sprang up from the bottom of his heart. He thought about how this sword could cut him into two pieces.

But this unprecedented life-or-death crisis made him feel something.

In this moment of life or death, he became calmer and closed his eyes.

“Is this it? Is it like this?”

“I finally understand what it was that prevented me from using this Style.

“It is the ruthlessness for killing.

“If the sword is for killing, how could I lack the ruthlessness for killing?”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, an onrush of excitement flashed before his eyes, and he waved the Triple-kill Sword.

It was the second move of the Anonymous Sword Art, Sword-killing Movement.
