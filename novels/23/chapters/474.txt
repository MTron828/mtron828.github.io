Chapter 475: The Heart-killing Sword

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Double First-grade Sword Souls?”

Marquis Piaoxue’s eyes lit up. “In Sword-suppression Valley, they all pay more attention to those with a gift for Sword Principle instead of strength. In the past, most of the attendees were lords, but sometimes, Saint Realm experts took part in it. Swordsman has awakened Double First-grade Sword Souls, which means he is powerful enough to go to the Sword Principle Meeting.

“Haha! OK, the last expert has been determined, Swordsman. Spirit Lord, go and tell him right now.”

“Yes, my marquis,” Spirit Lord responded and then left.

In the secret chamber of the Lord Mansion in the Blood Sword Territory, Jian Wushuang and his Slaughter Doppelganger were sitting cross-legged and absorbed in meditation.

He had been meditating for three months.

Just at that moment, a surge of overwhelming Slaughter Origin was flowing in Slaughter Doppelganger, condensing a new Mark of Slaughter Origin on his arm.

Now his Slaughter Doppelganger had five Marks of Slaughter Origin.

Jian Wushuang could not help sighing about it.

“The Six-story Pagoda’s Slaughter Restriction is amazing. With the help of the Slaughter Restriction, Slaughter Doppelganger comprehended the Slaughter Origin faster and condensed the fifth Slaughter Origin Mark within three months. At the same time, my true self condensed the fifth World Origin Mark by using the World Scroll.”

Jian Wushuang and Slaughter Doppelganger condensed five Origin Marks each. Now he had 10 marks total.

Jian Wushuang had condensed four World Origin Marks and one Slaughter Origin Mark. Three months later, the total Slaughter Origin Marks was equal to that of the World Origin Marks.

It was all due to the Six-story Pagoda!

As treasures that were helpful in the comprehension of the Origin, the Six-story Pagoda was more wonderful than the World Scroll.

The Six-story Pagoda had six Restrictions, but he was only able to decode the first Restriction.

“Five World Origin Marks and five Slaughter Origin Marks. Although two types of marks can’t release power at the same time, my strength has greatly improved from three months ago,”?Jian Wushuang thought with a faint smile.

Just at that moment...

“Lord!”

Bing Huo called from outside the secret chamber.

Jian Wushuang used his mind, then his Slaughter Doppelganger instantly merged into his true self and five marks were seen on each arm.

Afterward, he stood up, walked toward the door, and opened it to find Bing Huo respectfully waiting outside.

“My lord, Spirit Lord came and said he has an urgent matter for you,” Bing Huo said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and then went toward the main hall.

“Spirit Lord,” Jian Wushuang said upon seeing his guest.

“Haha, Swordsman.” Spirit Lord greeted the young man warmly.

They each sat beside a long narrow table. Then, maids came to serve them some good wine and delicious cuisine.

“Spirit Lord, because you’ve come here personally, I wonder what has happened.” Jian Wushuang was quite curious.

Spirit Lord had a high status. If it was regarding an ordinary matter, Spirit Lord could ask an underling to send a message to him. But seeing that Spirit Lord had come personally, it had to be a great matter.

“I need to tell you something,” Spirit Lord said.

“Swordsman, have you heard about Sword-suppression Valley?” Spirit Lord asked.

“Sword-suppression Valley?”

Jian Wushuang shook his head. Since he was a newcomer, there were many things that he knew little about in the Divine Land.

“Swordsman, have you heard of the Sword Ancestor?” Spirit Lord asked again.

Jian Wushuang was a bit surprised and subconsciously held his cup of wine tightly.

“I’ve not only heard about him, but actually, I’m the descendant of the Sword Ancestor!”

Jian Wushuang did not know why Spirit Lord had suddenly mentioned the Sword Ancestor, so he just tried to appear calm.

“I’ve heard some news about the Sword Ancestor and I only know that he was a super expert in the Divine Land,” Jian Wushuang said with a casual smile.

“Yep, you’re right. The Sword Ancestor was a real super expert.” Spirit Lord sighed. “Now, the Three Ancestors are known as the supreme experts in the vast Divine Land, but thousands of years ago, there were four ancestors!

“The Sword Ancestor was one of the four ancestors. The reason for his death is still unknown. After he died, the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor declined and soon disappeared from the Divine Land.”

“Then, what’s the relationship between Sword-suppression Valley and the Sword Ancestor?” Jian Wushuang held his cup of wine and sipped it with a look of indifference.

Spirit Lord continued, “The Sword Ancestor was known as the ancestor of the Sword Principle. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“It’s said that he had awakened six first-grade Sword Souls and was the first Sword Principle expert in the Divine Land. He had a marvelous magic weapon—the Heart-killing Sword!”

“The Heart-killing Sword?”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

He knew the best Sword Skill that the Sword Ancestor had created was called the Heart-killing Sword Technique. He had kept all its nine moves in mind, but he was only able to display the second move.

But he had never heard of the Heart-killing Sword.

“The Heart-killing Sword is the first magic weapon of the Sword Principle. It’s so powerful that it could easily kill a marquis just by using its own Sword Essence.

“Ever since the Sword Ancestor died, his corpse and treasures have become a mystery. No one knows where they are. He only left the Heart-killing Sword in Sword-suppression Valley, and his personal disciple, Su Ming, has been guarding there,” Spirit Lord said.

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“Su Ming? The Sword Ancestor’s personal disciple?” Jian Wushuang asked as he looked at Spirit Lord.

“Right.” Spirit Lord nodded with a smile. “Thousands of years ago, Sword Ancestor traveled around the Divine Land and no one was able to match him. Su Ming was one of his personal disciples and also the most excellent one.

“Now, Master Su Ming is one of the Nine Sovereigns in the Divine Land!”

Upon hearing that, Jian Wushuang was no longer able to remain calm.
