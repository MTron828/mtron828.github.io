Chapter 859: A Generous Gift

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Even though everyone else had left, Jian Wushuang still stayed there.

Sure enough, just a moment later, he received a message from Xue Lingtian, “Junior brother, come to No.14 VIP room on the second floor.”

“No. 14?”

Jian Wushuang quickly realized that it was the room number of the man who bought the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation.

“Bingo,”?Jian Wushuang thought with a faint smile, then he stepped directly into the VIP room.

Xue Lingtian, who was sitting alone in the room, threw something at Jian Wushuang as soon as he entered.

Naturally, it was the three paintings which contained the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation.

“Do you like this gift, junior brother? “Xue Lingtian looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile.

Jian Wushuang eagerly stared at the three painting scrolls in his hand.

Jian Wushuang knew that Xue Lingtian would prepare a generous gift for him, but he never expected it to be so precious!

These three paintings were worth 10 billion Divine Gems!

“Thank you, First Senior Brother,” Jian Wushuang said gratefully.

“You’re welcome.” Xue Lingtian waved his hand casually.

Jian Wushuang put the three paintings into his Interspatial Ring and sat down in front of Xue Lingtian before asking, “First Senior Brother, did you know in advance that the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation would be up for auction today?”

“Yes.” Xue Lingtian nodded with a smile.

“Since I knew that I had a new junior brother, I started to prepare a gift for you. I happened to learn from the Void Temple that the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation was up for auction today, so I was prepared for it.”

“The Ninth-heaven Sword Formation is very precious. Fortunately, I made preparations so that I could buy it for only 10 billion Divine Gems.”

“If the auction house had spread the news of the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation, it would definitely have attracted a lot of experts who would bring more Divine Gems. By that time, it would be more difficult for me to buy it.”

Jian Wushuang nodded his head after hearing Xue Lingtian’s words.

Since the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation was indeed precious, its true value was probably more than 10 billion Divine Gems.

“By the way, junior brother, I heard from our Master that you killed the second master of the Xia Clan?” Xue Lingtian suddenly asked.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Haha, even though the second master was not as talented as the first master, he had been cultivated by the Xia Clan for a long time. The Xia Clan felt a great loss over his death. No wonder they blamed our Master and the Ancient Sect,” Xue Lingtian laughed.

“They blamed our Master and the Ancient Sect?” Jian Wushuang asked thoughtfully.

He had expected the Xia Clan’s anger and had told his Master about it.

“Don’t worry, although the Xia Clan was angry and wanted revenge, they won’t dare to do anything as long as I’m alive,” Xue Lingtian said.

“Did you talk to them in person?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“No, I just sent a message to the Xia Clan that you’re my junior brother and that we’re disciples of the Ancient Sect.”

Xue Lingtian smiled and continued, “Although the Xia Clan is the strongest overlord clan in the Tang of the East and has always been overbearing, they seem to be scheming something, so they are keeping a low-profile for now. At present, they’re unwilling to offend me, a Master of the Void Temple, just out of anger.”

“Of course, I can only prevent them from taking revenge on the Ancient Sect. I can’t stop them from targeting you.”

“That is to say, the Xia Clan will find ways to kill you, but they won’t dare to trouble our Master and the Ancient Sect.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows, not surprised at all.

Although the position of Xue Lingtian in the Void Temple was high, he still could not stop the Xia Clan from seeking revenge on Jian Wushuang.

The Xia Clan already gave Xue Lingtian respect when they decided to give up getting revenge on the Ancient Sect.

“Junior brother, the Xia Clan has plenty of methods. Once you’ve been discovered by the Xia Clan, it will be really troublesome, so you must act carefully,” Xue Lingtian said.

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Alright, I’ve already given you your gift. I’m a little busy, so I have to go now. If you need me, sent me a message at any time,” Xue Lingtian said.

“Thank you, First Senior Brother.” Jian Wushuang said gratefully.

Not long after Xue Lingtian left, Jian Wushuang also left discreetly.

He was just a Divine Realm expert, but he appeared to be in Eternal Realm because of the disguise with the Yin-Yang Mirror, so he did not cause the slightest attention when he left.

After leaving the auction house, he returned to the Blood Eagle Guard residence through the wormhole. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Once he returned to his bedroom, Jian Wushuang started to study the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation.

“Oh boy, this is the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation!”

“So incredible!”

He stared at the three paintings in his hand.

Each painting represented a sword formation of the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation.

They all possessed a different power.

The first sword formation was called “Trackless Sword Move”.

36 sword-type magic weapons would be combined together to release an extremely terrifying sword move that acted according to the formations special structure.

The second sword formation was named “Flash Sword Formation”, which required a combination of 72 swords.

The third one was called “Aurora Sword Formation”, which required 108 swords.

Each sword formation was stronger than the previous one.

They were called sword formations because they were a combination of sword-type magic weapons, but the real aim was to improve their power.

The most terrifying thing about it though was the supreme level of swordsmanship.

“This sword formation requires so many magic weapons?”

Jian Wushuang squinted slightly and read the introduction to the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation, “The higher-level magic weapons the better. It’s best to use standard-manufactured magic weapons as they’re of the same level and power.”

“It’s easy to get these magic weapons. During the past few years, I’ve completed a lot of Blood Eagle Guard tasks and earned a number of points. With the rest of my points and all my Divine Gems, I should be able to exchange for a set of magic weapons to use with this sword formation.”

“The key factor is the three sword formations. They’re… too enigmatic.”

It was indeed too enigmatic and too profound.

Jian Wushuang started to research on the first sword formation. However, he did not have any clues on it a half a month later.

“It seems like I’ll have to go to the Divine Sea to meditate on the first sword formation.”
