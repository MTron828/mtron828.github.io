4908 The Dao Field Under the Abyss

Immediately after, the sound of bones cracking could be heard.

Without exception, they were all Death Immortals. Without their own consciousness, they were like corpses.

Crack…”

The Death Immortal in the lead seemed to have died a long time ago. All that was left was his Immortal bones. It could be said that he no longer had any combat power.

Jian Wushuang walked at the front. He waved his hand and wiped out the Death Immortals who dared to come forward, leaving no trace behind.

In an instant, the dozen Death Immortals had all disappeared.

This huge hall was built on the endless mountain range. It was the center of the mysterious Heavenly Region and also the place with the thickest Death Qi.

Feng Shan then stepped forward and protected Jian Wushuang. He rushed into the giant hall and started to wreak havoc.

He had smashed a few large holes in the ceiling of the hall. A faint light shone in, and the scene in the hall could barely be seen.

The hall was ancient, and the ground and walls were covered in deep red blood veins, making it look like a battlefield.

Moreover, the blood veins seemed to be alive as they slowly squirmed.

“Pretentious thing, I’ll kill you as well!” Feng Shan said in a deep voice. As he opened and closed his palms, a vast ocean of derived energy poured out and exploded in the hall.

Jian Wushuang suddenly had a bad premonition. However, before he could help, Feng Shan was already in danger!

Suddenly, millions of blood tendons were awakened like prey that smelled fresh blood. They covered the sky and covered the sun as they went to capture Feng Shan.

The great momentum of the Yan power was devoured by the countless blood tendons. Then, he was entangled by the blood tendons and dragged into the abyss.

Jian Wushuang’s slash only cut off thousands of blood tendons and failed to stop it.

Without any hesitation, he flew into the depths of the giant hall.

Shu Yang’s heart trembled and he followed closely behind Jian Wushuang. He couldn’t explain why he did this and followed his instincts.

The giant hall was broken, and there was a deep chasm in the deepest part. Even light could not shine in there. Countless blood veins as thick as real dragons were entrenched in the abyss, and it was extremely shocking.

Jian Wushuang held an Invisible Sword in his hand and majestic divine patterns flowed around his body, preventing all filth from approaching.

Boom!

Immediately after, a figure holding a long sword and flowing with divine patterns appeared. Shu Yang, who held a silver spear, followed closely behind.

Beneath the abyss was a vast and boundless Dao Field. No light could shine here, and it was extremely treacherous.

In the center of the vast Dao Field, Jian Wushuang saw a huge futon made of flesh and bones wiggling slowly.

This huge praying mat was actually made up of Death Immortals. There were at least hundreds of them!

At the same time, the black-robed Grand Yan Immortal, You Yun, was sitting on the futon. His withered face was staring at Jian Wushuang with hatred.

“I miscalculated. I shouldn’t have brought you into my Heavenly Region,” he said fiercely.

Jian Wushuang glanced at him and said coldly, “Cut the crap. Let him go and I’ll spare your life.”

You Yun suddenly stood up from the futon, and red light shot out from his sunken eyes. “Are you sure you have me cornered?!”

“I can kill you the first time, so naturally, I can kill you the second time. Do you still want to try?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold.

“Then I’ll give it a try today. If you beat me, I’ll return him to you!” You Yun shouted. His arms shook, and a blood tendon that was a million feet thick appeared from the dark.

Feng Shan’s body was firmly fixed at the top of the blood tendon, unable to move at all.

You Yun wanted to say something, but Jian Wushuang obviously did not want to talk nonsense. He walked toward him with his sword.

He was shocked and hurriedly controlled the endless death energy to respond.

Crack, crack…

The ground shattered and suddenly, giant claws emerged from the ground and clawed at Jian Wushuang crazily.

Seeing this, Shu Yang hurriedly raised the silver spear in his hand and opened a path for him.

Wushuang Sword Dao, Star River Lake Ocean Sword Intent, first move.

Star.

The Sword Intent of the majestic temple gathered into a line and slashed forward with a momentum that was as if it was splitting open the sky!

The Sword Intent exploded out completely, and countless beams of light burst out along the way, shattering the giant claws that reached out from the ground.

This sword attack had the highest AOE damage and could easily eliminate threats.

You Yun was shocked. The Sword Intent that made him suffocate attacked again, and he was forced to attack.

In an instant, the praying mat under his feet began to squirm.

All the overlapping Death Immortals were struggling in pain. They opened their mouths and formed a strange suction force.

Under this suction force, the Sword Intent was directly devoured.

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly. He felt that something was wrong.

Shu Yang came behind him and said solemnly, “There’s something wrong with the futon that You Yun is sitting on. It can absorb all damage.”

He nodded, not in a hurry to make a move.

At this moment, Feng Shan, who was hanging on the blood tendon, shouted anxiously, “My Lord, leave quickly. Don’t stay here any longer. There’s something wrong with this old thing! He…”

Before he could finish his sentence, You Yun stretched out his hand and released a ball of Blood Qi to knock him out. “How noisy.”

Then, You Yun gave a strange smile, and his figure disappeared in the air.

Shu Yang’s expression changed and he moved toward Jian Wushuang without leaving a trace.

There was a natural chasm between the Grand Yan Immortal and the Yan Immortal, let alone a treacherous Grand Yan Immortal like You Yun.

It could be said that as long as You Yun had killing intent, even if Shu Yang was invincible in the same realm, he could only die obediently, let alone fight against him.

Shu Yang, who was proud and aloof by nature, did not doubt this at all. Therefore, he directly approached Jian Wushuang.

This person was also in the Yan Immortal stage, and could even be said to be his enemy, but now, he felt a great sense of security…

“This is my home. I am the eternal Heavenly Dao here. No one can hurt me!”

“Now, be my nourishment with your devout faith. You are enough for me to make another breakthrough!”

As You Yun’s voice resounded in the abyssal Dao Field, the huge futon made of Death Immortals moved at this moment.

Every Death Immortal was wailing in pain. It was as if they had suffered the most painful punishment before they completely died.

Endless Death Qi spread in the center of the Dao Field. Then, the huge futon moved. All the dead Immortals opened their blood-red eyes at this moment.
