Chapter 2869: Young Master Qu’s Trump Card

——

“The Black Blood Emperor is dead. Next, it’s him.”

Jian Wushuang looked at Young Master Qu coldly.

He knew very well that the four Divine Masters and Black Blood Emperor were just following orders. Young Master Qu was the one who wanted to kill him.

Jian Wushuang had thought that Young Master Qu would be terrified after seeing him kill the Black Blood Emperor. However, what surprised him was the look on his face, he was indeed very surprised that Jian Wushuang could kill the Black Blood Emperor.

However, he was not too frightened.

“What kind of trump card does Young Master Qu have?” Jian Wushuang could not help thinking.

At this moment, Young Master Qu’s eyes were fixed on the Blood Mountain Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand.

“It’s this sword… it’s so sharp and terrifying. I know how strong the Black Blood Emperor’s body-protection is. The body-protection armor on his body is an absolute top-grade heavenly treasure, but in front of this sword, it was torn apart like a piece of paper.”

“This sword…”

Young Master Qu’s eyes lit up. He had already thought of a possibility.

“It seems that the sword principle weapon you asked Lord Mo to refine should be this sword in your hand.” Young Master Qu said excitedly.

“Master Qu, I’m very curious. What else can you rely on to face me so calmly without running away? Aren’t you afraid that I’ll kill you?” Jian Wushuang also looked at Master Qu.

“Kill me? Do you dare?” Master Qu smiled coldly, “Jian Yi, don’t forget that my father is World Lord Tian Qu. He’s an extremely powerful Immortal Saint and his methods are very good. Although he’ll be furious that you killed the Black Blood Emperor, he might not kill you personally. But if he dares to attack me again, I dare to say that my father will kill you at all costs. Do you think you can escape then?”

“This is what you rely on. Do you want to use your father to intimidate me?” Jian Wushuang’s face was very cold.

“Of course not.” Young Master Qu shook his head slightly and then took out a token.

The token looked ordinary, and when it appeared in Young Master Qu’s hand, Jian Wushuang immediately sensed an extremely terrifying aura from it.

This aura made his heart palpitate.

There was no doubt that this aura came from the Immortal Saint.

“Jian Yi, you should be able to see what this token is.” Young Master Qu smiled. “That’s right. This token is a life-saving token that my father personally refined for me. During this period, it contains the power of one blow from my father. It’s enough to kill any Divine Master, including the Invincible Divine Master. If you have the guts, you can give it a try.”

Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted. He finally understood why Young Master Qu was so confident.

It turned out that he had such a trump card.

The token that contained the power of one strike from Realm Lord Tian Qu was the power of one strike from the Immortal Saint. Realm Lord Tian Qu was well-known in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow and was an extremely powerful Immortal Saint. His power was below that of the Immortal Saint, not many people could survive.

After all, the gap between the Immortal Saint and the Divine Master was too big.

Jian Wushuang had already possessed the combat strength of an Invincible Divine Master when he was in the Pill Sun Sacred World. Now that his realm had broken through and his Blood Mountain Sword had undergone a transformation, his overall strength had increased by nearly a hundred times, but even so… he did not think that he was qualified to fight with an Immortal Saint.

However, that did not mean that Jian Wushuang was afraid of Realm Master Tian Qu.

“Master Qu, it seems that Realm Master Tian Qu really dotes on you. He just came to Dragon-phoenix Pavilion to attend the ceremony. Not only did he arrange for you to be protected by an Invincible Divine Master and four Peak Divine Masters, but he also refined a life-saving talisman for you. However… you are destined to be disappointed.” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly, a majestic killing intent slowly rose from his body.

Sensing this majestic killing intent, Young Master Qu’s expression could not help but change. “Jian Yi, do you really want to die?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Although Young Master Qu had absolute confidence in his life-saving command talisman, to be exact, he had absolute confidence in his father.

However, even with his father’s ability, it was not easy for him to personally refine such a life-saving command talisman. Therefore, he hoped that Jian Wushuang would give up so that he could not use this trump card.

But now…

“Courting death? Haha, Young Master Qu, you think too highly of yourself.” Jian Wushuang sneered. The majestic killing intent had completely covered Young Master Qu.

At the same time, a large amount of golden divine power surged out from the surface of Jian Wushuang’s body. In an instant, it formed a huge golden emperor phantom behind Jian Wushuang, which was at least 30,000 feet tall.

Jian Wushuang finally used his secret skill, divine punishment.

As soon as divine punishment was used, Jian Wushuang’s strength soared again, but his body had already rushed out.

Seeing this, Young Master Qu finally did not hesitate anymore.

“Go to hell!”

With a powerful shout, Young Master Qu directly crushed the life-saving token in his hand.

In an instant, a world-shaking and terrifying power suddenly erupted.

This power was much more powerful than the full power of an ordinary Divine Master or even an Invincible Divine Master.

It was definitely at the level of an Immortal Saint, and among them, it was definitely not weak.

Rumble! The sky and earth changed color, and the entire void was shaking crazily.

Under the guidance of Young Master Qu, this sudden burst of terrifying power suddenly turned into a towering hand.

The towering hand opened its fingers and directly grabbed at Jian Wushuang. Wherever it passed, a crisp explosion sounded in the void.

Jian Wushuang, who was moving, felt that a terrifying power had completely covered and sealed him, making him lose any chance to escape.

The towering hand finally covered Jian Wushuang and suddenly clenched.

An explosive power was activated, as if it could crush an entire world.

Jian Wushuang was completely submerged by the overwhelming terrifying power.

In the void next to him, Master Qu stood there and looked at the giant hand in front of him, which was destroying everything. A cold smile appeared on his face.

“Father, this is father’s strength!”

“Jian Yi really deserves to die. He thought that he was amazing enough to kill the Black Blood Emperor, but he didn’t know that he was no different from an ant in front of father. If father wanted to kill him, it would be as easy as squashing an ant.”
