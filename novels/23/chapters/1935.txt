1936 The Luo Royal Family

To Jian Wushuang and the others, they really would pass by Holy Kingdom of South Plume. Hence, letting them hitch a ride was as easy as lifting their hands.

As for the so-called trouble, it could bring them some fun and joy on their way. So why not?

“Everyone, although I agreed to let you hitch a ride, you have to clarify the trouble that you are in to us,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The blue-haired lady and the surrounding few people exchanged a look and nodded faintly.

“Well…” the blue-haired lady immediately started telling them the ins and outs.

Jian Wushuang was listening too.

Very quickly, he understood the entire story.

At the same time, he also found out the identity of the people in front of him.

The dozen people had great backgrounds. They were the royal disciples from Holy Kingdom of Sky Luo, a Holy Kingdom from the surrounding.

Yes, royal family!

Their tribe master was also the Monarch of Holy Kingdom of Sky Luo.

Originally, they were supremes in Holy Kingdom of Sky Luo. They were a definite symbol of power.

However, not too long ago, Holy Kingdom of Sky Luo had gone through a drastic change. There was a major force, Soul Snatching Palace, that had attacked the royal family. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Soul Snatching Palace was originally not as powerful as the royal family. No one knew where they had gotten the assistance.

There were more than a thousand royal disciples that had escaped who were all outstanding geniuses. However, as Soul Snatching Palace continued to chase after them, the number of royal disciples dwindled to a dozen after a few fights.

Among the dozen people, the strongest was the blue-haired lady, Luo Feng. But she was only a Void Real God.

As for the others, they were only Universe Gods.

They intended to flee to Holy Kingdom of South Flume then. Holy Kingdom of South Flume and Holy Kingdom of Sky Luo allied through marriages over generations. The Monarch of Holy Kingdom of South Flume was also the Monarch of Holy Kingdom of Sky Luo’s best friends. He naturally would take them with him. Of course, only on the prerequisite that they could reach Holy Kingdom of South Flume alive.

“Soul Snatching Palace is determined to exterminate we Luo Family. Although it isn’t too far away, we might be attacked by them. You have to be prepared,” Luo Feng said.

“Soul Snatching Palace? Okay,” Jian Wushuang nodded but he obviously didn’t care much.

Luo Feng and a purple-haired youth by her side saw the sight and their eyes fixed on him.

“Soul Snatching Palace is impressive. You’d better not be careless,” the purple-haired youth couldn’t help but add.

“Is it?” Jian Wushuang didn’t say much. But he looked at the purple-haired youth in shock. He could tell that the purple-haired youth wasn’t very old but his gaze was deep. Plus, Jian Wushuang could see a hidden hatred in the depth of his eyes.

The hatred should be derived from the extermination of Luo Family.

“Young man, what’s your name?” Jian Wushuang looked at the purple-haired youth.

“Luo Tianhong,” the purple-haired youth replied coldly.

“That’s a good name. Don’t worry. I’ll dismiss Soul Snatching Palace for you,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The purple-haired youth, Luo Tianhong, didn’t say much after that.

For the remaining time, the ancient silver spaceship continued forward.

In the cabin, Jian Wushuang and King of Venomous Worms were playing chess while Jian Yi and Qiu Yue watched in respect.

As for the disciples from Luo royal family, they were gathered there too but they didn’t talk to Jian Wushuang and the others much.

“Brother Tianhong, do you think we can reach Holy Kingdom of South Plume alive?” A maiden in green asked timidly.

The other disciples from Luo royal family couldn’t help but look at the purple-haired youth Luo Tianhong.

Although the purple-haired youth wasn’t the oldest among the disciples, his power and talent were the strongest. Plus, he had been through the most. Hence, he was the most mature one.

The disciples from Luo royal family had always viewed Luo Tianhong as their leader.

“Don’t worry. We will definitely survive,” Luo Tianhong comforted the disciples at his side and he smiled.

“Mm, I believe in Brother Tianhong,” the timid maiden nodded faintly.

After comforting the disciples, Luo Tianhong came next to the blue-haired lady, Luo Feng.

“Tianhong, what do you think of these few people?” Luo Feng pointed at Jian Wushuang and the others who were around the chess set.

“Although I can’t see through them, I can feel that they should be quite powerful,” Luo Tianhong replied.

“How is it so?” Luo Feng asked.

“Firstly, the spaceship is unusual. They could drive such a spaceship and it shows their power. Plus, they know that Soul Snatching Palace is powerful and could wipe out Luo royal family directly but they didn’t seem to care much about Soul Snatching Palace in their speech. I believe the experts who could drive such a spaceship definitely wouldn’t be idiots that were blind. Hence, they definitely have reliance,’ Luo Tianhong analyzed.

“I thought so too,” Luo Feng smiled, “Actually, regardless of if these people are capable, we are in a desperate situation. We could only bet on this and pray that we bet on the right one.”

“Mm,” Luo Tianhong nodded heavily.

They were really cornered in a desperate situation.

There were originally a thousand disciples but they were chased after by Soul Snatching Palace. There were only a dozen of them left out of the one thousand royal disciples. Luo Feng was the only Real God expert that was escorting them thought their journey. With the remaining fighting power, they would definitely die if they were to come across Soul Snatching Palace.

Hence… they had no other ways.

Helplessly, when they saw that Jian Wushuang and the others were on the spaceship, they decided to try their luck.

As for the result, it was up to their destiny.

On the other side, Jian Wushuang was playing chess with King of Venomous Worms. However, they were also chatting casually while playing chess.

Of course, they had already sealed off the surrounding spacetime. Hence, the Luo royal disciples wouldn’t hear whatever they said.

“Jian Wushuang, I probed earlier. Among these people, there were some who had a special mark left on them, If not mistaken, it should be marked by Soul Snatching Palace,” King of Venomous Worms smiled.

“Mm, I know,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly.

The master of the mark shouldn’t be powerful but should only be a Real God. Jian Wushuang naturally could see the mark easily.

“Do you need me to remove the mark?” King of Venomous Worms asked.

“There’s no need to,” Jian Wushuang shook his head and smiled, “There’s finally some fun. How could we just let it slip? Plus, the mark is unusual. I’d like to verify who left the mark.

“Let’s go with the flow.”
