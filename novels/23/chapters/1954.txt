Chapter 1955: Spread!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the dark void, Sir God Xue Dao’s figure towered. His appearance was vague.

There were dozens of people standing before him in reverence.

Most of the people were Real Gods, there were some Universe Gods as well. They were taken by Sir God Xue Dao before them.

At that moment, dozens of people were shivering in fear.

They didn’t know who the person was before them and why he had caught them, but they knew that the person before them was a true Almighty.

“I brought you here for you to do something for me,” Sir God Xue Dao overlooked the dozens of people before him. He immediately took out a bunch of tokens. “The tokens here, all of you take one each. Then, head to Vientiane Tower, Abysmal Palace, Soaring Heaven King Palace, XXX, Century Phoenix Tower, Sky Blade Group…”

Sir God Xue Dao listed the names of the forces.

Some of the forces were major sects and some were intelligence assassin groups.

Just like Vientiane Tower, they were widely acknowledged as the number ones in Eternal Chaotic World.

Abysmal Palace and Soaring Heaven King Palace were the number one major force.

Sir God Xue Dao then read out a dozen forces’ names.

“After you get to the sects and forces, pass them the tokens. Don’t speak a word after that,” Sir God Xue Dao’s voice was cold. Then, he took out a bunch of Qian Kun rings, “In these Qian Kun rings, there are a thousand doctrine gems each. They are your rewards!”

“Besides, I have already left a special mark on each of your bodies. It’ll be fine if you are to complete the task as I have instructed. Whoever doesn’t send the tokens to the sects or forces within a hundred years, I will take action directly and kill you!”

“Understand?”

Sir God Xue Dao looked at the people around him with a cold gaze.

“Don’t worry, Sir. We will definitely send these token within a hundred years,” there was a Real God that answered.

The others nodded their heads simultaneously.

They never doubted the ability of the Almighty before them. He could kill them at any time so they naturally didn’t dare to go against him.

On top of that, the reward that the Almighty offer could make them go crazy.

“Go ahead!”

Sir God Xue Dao said.

Then, the people immediately moved to their assigned sects and forces. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

In the void, there was only Sir God Xue Dao left. He slowly revealed his face and he looked extremely ferocious.

“Sword Emperor, humph. You can totally kill my brother alone. But now, all experts from Eternal Chaotic World are going to find out about the ancient battlefield. I’d like to see if you are capable enough to kill all experts from Eternal Chaotic World!!!”

…

In no time, the top forces in Eternal Chaotic World and the major sects were going to receive a token.

The token contained information and also a mirror image.

In the mirror image, there wasn’t any fierce fight nor any cultivators, only a battlefield.

An ancient yet vast battlefield.

The mirror image showed a small region of the ancient battlefield.

The top experts from Eternal Chaotic World could easily recognize from the small region that it was an ancient battlefield.

Plus, it was one that everyone was unfamiliar with. It was even different to the ancient battlefield in ancient mystery land.

There was no doubt that it was an entirely new ancient battlefield that no one had discovered!

As for the information given, it was rather simple. It was the location of the hidden space gap in ancient mystery land.

After the tokens reached the hands of the forces and sects, the experts were instantly astonished.

It instantly stirred up an unprecedentedly great commotion in the entire Eternal Chaotic World!!

Such commotion was much greater than when ancient mystery land had never closed.

One should know that it was a brand new ancient battlefield!

One should know that there were many experts in ancient times and it was a period of great prosperity.

After ancient times, the cultivators in the universe continued to grow weaker in power and they had never reached brilliance in ancient times.

Naturally, the ancient battlefield had become a place which all cultivators continuously explored.

Ever since the second era, there were two well-known ancient battlefields, the First Lair and ancient mystery land.

The two ancient battlefields had contained great opportunity. However, the first one was too dangerous while the second one was almost out of opportunities after so many years of exploration.

Hence, although the two ancient battlefields were still attractive to many experts in Eternal Chaotic World, it wasn’t too strong of an attraction.

However, a brand new ancient battlefield would be entirely different!!!

A brand new ancient battlefield contained complete opportunities.

Enthusiastic!

Madness!

The Almighties on top of the pyramid in Eternal Chaotic World went crazy.

Although Almighties were already high and above and there weren’t many things in the universe that could catch their attention.

However, a brand new ancient battlefield that no one had ever found and contained boundless opportunities, it was enough to make the Almighties go crazy!

Forget about the ordinary Almighties, even those Great Emperors on the top wouldn’t be able to stay composed after they found out about the news.

On Thunderbolt Island, on Sanctuary Mountain.

The two Great Emperors who had stayed on Thunderbolt Island all this while as they took care of all affairs in Sanctuary Alliance, Ancestor Tian Chen and East Royal Emperor, they met up.

The two of their faces looked extremely solemn.

“Who spread the news exactly? Is it verified?” Ancestor Tian Chen asked in a deep voice.

“At the moment, we don’t know who spread it. The tokens were sent to various forces and sect by some Real Gods and Universe Gods. They only know that it was an Almighty that instructed them to do so but they didn’t know who the Almighty was. As for the validity of the mirror image and the information contained in the token, it has yet to be verified,” East Royal Emperor said.

“Tokens sent to various forces and sects. It is obviously spread with intention and he purposely hid his identity… Could it be a trap set up by Holocaust Sect or Acheron Palace?” Ancestor Tian Chen creased his eyebrows and made a guess.

“Shouldn’t be. Although the news has yet to be verified, judging from the mirror image, it should really be an ancient battlefield and it was only partial of the ancient battlefield. The battlefield should be rather huge. With such a huge ancient battlefield unearthed, Holocaust Sect and Acheron Palace could definitely conquer it in secret if they were to find it. Why would they spread the news to us?” East Royal Emperor said.

“Besides, even if the two dark forces wanted to scheme against us in Sanctuary Alliance, they would only have the guts to scheme against a few of our experts. They wouldn’t stand a chance to scheme against the entire Sanctuary Alliance or the entire Eternal Chaotic World.”
