Chapter 777: Cloud Sea Asgard, Tian Yunzi!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Pay my respects to Palace Master!!!”

There was utmost respect in Yun Fan’s voice, but there was more passion in it. His voice reverberated throughout the area.

It caused a commotion in an instant.

Palace Master?

There was only one person in this world that could possibly be the Palace Master that Yun Fan the Great Elder was calling.

It was the Palace Master of Cloud Sea Asgard, Tian Yunzi who had reached the level of Dao Master!

“Palace Master of Cloud Sea Asgard?”

“Gosh!”

“A Dao Master came here personally?”

“A Dao Master? Although I’ve reached the Eternal Realm, it’s my first time meeting a legendary Dao Master.”

After knowing the identity of the newcomer, the gazes of the experts on the comer turned heated up.

Dao Master; these two simple words represented the supreme dignity in the Firmament Territory.

It was the supreme existence in the Eternal Realm.

Eternal Realm experts were considered the real experts in the Firmament Territory. However, in the vast Eternal World, unless they had reached the peak of Step Five or Step Six, their strength was considered mediocre.

As for Dao Masters, no matter where they were, they were the real supreme experts.

There were four Realms in the Eternal World, Skyscraping Realm, Divine Realm, Eternal Realm, and Dao Master. Among which, Dao Master was ranked first.

Dao Masters were rare in this world and each of them had unbelievable skills. There were only four known Dao Masters in the Firmament Territory: Palace Master of Cloud Sea Asgard, Emperor of Immortal Dynasty, Sect Master of the Boundless Demon Sect, and Sect Master of the Ancient Sect.

These were the four known Dao Masters.

Of course, in the history of the Ancient Sect, there were another three Dao Masters, but they had left the Firmament Territory a long time ago and had not shown up for many years.

And today, Tian Yunzi, one of the four Dao Masters, have come personally!

It was no wonder that the other experts were so shocked.

“Palace Master of Cloud Sea Asgard?”

Even Jian Wushuang furrowed his eyebrows tightly.

It was indeed amazing that he was able to defeat Yun Fan, Saber Master, and Old Weirdo Dream. His strength was so strong, there was no one else in the Eternal Realm Firmament Territory that was worthy enough to be his opponent, other than his master Xuan Yi.

But no matter how powerful he was, it was impossible for him to fight with a Dao Master.

There was a yawning gap between an Eternal Realm expert and a Dao Master.

Tian Yunzi was standing with his hands behind his back and Yun Fan was standing behind him respectfully.

Tian Yunzi wore an indifferent look while glancing at Jian Wushuang with his sharp gaze.

“Boy, you’re Xuan Yi’s personal disciple Jian Wushuang, right?” Tian Yunzi asked in a flat toneless voice.

Jian Wushuang responded with a smile, “I didn’t expect the Palace Master of Cloud Sea Asgard to know a nobody. It’s my great honor.”

Faced with this supreme expert, Jian Wushuang still looked composed. At the same time, he even took some elixirs from his Interspatial Ring to help him recover his Spiritual Power.

Although he could not predict what was going to happen, he knew that he had better keep his own strength.

“Hehe, Xuan Yi’s personal disciple, the most heaven-defying Divine Realm expert in the Firmament Territory. You aren’t a nobody.” Tian Yunzi smiled while looking at the boy with a bizarre gaze.

“A Divine Realm expert defeated three experts at Step Four of the Eternal Realm and almost killed my Great Elder Yun Fan. You’re amazing!

“As far as I know, your strength was only comparable to a superior Divine Realm expert 100 years ago, but now you have reached this level. Tut, I really wanted to know what happened to you in the Eternal Zone over the last 100 years.

Jian Wushuang sneered, “What? Does the great Palace Master of Cloud Sea Asgard want to attack me too?”

“Attack you? No, I’d like to invite you to our Cloud Sea Asgard. I am personally inviting you, so you’ll accept it, right?” Tian Yunzi looked at Jian Wushuang as he asked.

“That depends on how strong you are.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes became colder.

“Oh?” Tian Yunzi raised his eyebrows.

Hearing this, the spectators were greatly taken aback.

“The Palace Master of Cloud Sea Asgard, a Dao Master, is going to attack this Divine Realm boy too?”

“Jian Wushuang is unwilling to soften his stance even in front of Tian Yunzi?”

“He said that he wanted to see how strong he is?”

“It looks like he wants to challenge this Dao Master?”

Thinking of this, the other experts were stupefied.

“A Divine Realm expert is not yet satisfied with his performance of defeating so many Eternal Realm experts, and still tries to fight with a Dao Master?”

“Where does his courage come from?”

No matter what the other experts thought, Jian Wushuang had begun to move.

He leaped up and appeared in front of Tian Yunzi. This 15-meter-tall boy looked down at Tian Yunzi, the “small figure”. He raised up his longsword with both his hands and endless Sword Essence gathered on his sword.

The surge of power became increasingly mightier, which amazed the spectators.

However, Tian Yunzi still kept his posture while watching this with interest. He did not stop Jian Wushuang from doing his moves.

The moment the power on his sword peaked, Jian Wushuang swung it.

Buzz… A vague sword shadow swept out, covering the whole sky like a ripple. It slashed towards Tian Yunzi.

The third move of Boundless Heaven Sword Art, Red Shade Sword Move!

“He, he really made a move!”

“He really dared to do this?” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“A Divine Realm expert was unwilling to surrender to a Dao Master, and even launched an attack. No one will be able to match his courage.”

“How daring he is!”

“No, I think he’s just too full of himself. It’s crazy enough that he should challenge the Eternal Realm experts, but now the Dao Master too…”

The spectators were shocked and in a chaos.

They all stared at the fight with their eyes wide opened.

At the same time, they also recognized the move that Jian Wushuang had displayed.

Jian Wushuang had used it to defeat Yun Fan, Saber Master, and Old Weirdo Dream.

This attack still contained terrifying power that could make people tremble in fear.

But now, it was being targeted at Tian Yunzi!
