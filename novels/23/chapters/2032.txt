2033 Trap!

“As the four of them appeared here, then outside the golden whirlpool…”

Jian Wushuang spread his soul power. As expected, in the void outside of the golden whirlpool, there were five figures plunging over.

The five of them were the five Great Emperors who had departed to Doctrine Propagation Palace.

If the five of them were in Doctrine Propagation Palace, they would at least need a dozen breaths time to rush there. But then… It had only been a few breaths’ time since Jian Wushuang and his troop had decided to take action. It was obvious that the five of them were already on their way back.

In the middle of the golden whirlpool, in front of the Emperor Supreme Rock, there was a total of four Great Emperors, including the bald man.

Outside the golden whirlpool, there were three Great Emperors who were in charge of guarding the whirlpool.

The five Great Emperors who were rushing to golden whirlpool from Doctrine Propagation Palace.

All of them added up, it would make twelve Great Emperors!

Twelve Great Emperors!

Regardless of if it were to Sanctuary Alliance or to Three-Emperors World, it was a terrifying power.

However, it was taking place in front of Jian Wushuang.

“It seems that you knew long ago that we would take action today?” Jian Wushuang stared at the beast-like man, Ling Zong.

“Of course we did. Actually, not only that, but the Doctrine Propagation Ceremony itself is also merely a scheme that we intentionally plotted against you. We purposely gave you an opportunity to take action,” Ling Zong scoffed.

“I see. It turns out that Eternal Chaotic World is destined to fail this time,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

“Fail? Not that simple, Jian Wushuang. Today, the four of you shall die here!” Ling Zong’s voice became cold and he took a huge stride forward.

Vroom!!

The dark battleaxe appeared in the universe.

The moment it appeared, it became the main focus of the universe.

Jian Wushuang’s face grew dim. When Ling Zong took action, Jian Wushuang immediately wielded his Blood Mountain Sword too.

Boundless divine power instantly poured and swept out.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo, Blast Rainstorm!

A powerful stroke and it instantly collided with the dark axe shadow.

Bang!

The noise resounded and both Jian Wushuang and Ling Zong took one step back simultaneously. Both of their powers were compatible.

“What?” Ling Zong looked at Jian Wushuang in shock.

He remembered that Jian Wushuang had performed a terrifying defense power in Silver-Winged God Mansion back then. The six Great Emperors had joined forces to besiege him for a total of eight breaths’ time and he had remained undamaged. But in terms of true fighting power, Jian Wushuang was about the same as an ordinary Great Emperor.

However, the power that was contained in the sword principle that Jian Wushuang had just performed was compatible with his axe shadow.

“How long has it been? How could his power increase so tremendously?” Ling Zong was first shocked, then he soared with terrifying murderous intention.

“Let’s take action and kill him!!!”

The three Great Emperors behind Ling Zong took action simultaneously.

“Humph!” Jian Wushuang humphed coldly and greeted.

Jian Wushuang had been fearless against the besiegement of the six Great Emperors back in Silver-Winged God Mansion, let alone the fact that there were only four of them then. On top of that, he had cultivated the Immemorial Celestial Body successfully.

However, although he was fearless, Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao at the border of the golden whirlpool couldn’t take it.

They were calm and composed when they were dealing with three Great Emperors. But then, the five Great Emperors had already rushed back from Doctrine Propagation Palace and appeared in the golden whirlpool.

In other words, there was a total of eight Great Emperors fighting against Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao then.

The two of them weren’t as invincible as Jian Wushuang. They didn’t possess the almost immortal body. How could they possibly resist?

After a short while, Emperor Jiu Qiao had already been severely injured while Abysmal Saint Master was not doing any better.

Vroom!

There was a terrifying aura that suddenly spread from Emperor Jiu Qiao.

There was a uniquely fierce force that surfaced from Emperor Jiu Qiao body. The force was the power of Star.

Emperor Jiu Qiao had already played the secret skill of Star Palace.

However, he had only cultivated the first volume of Secret Skill of Star Palace successfully and he could only increase his fighting power by ten times. He still had the lower hand up against the besiegement of so many Great Emperors.

Most importantly, his secret skill of star palace could only last for ten breaths of time.

“We are in great trouble!”

“What do we do? What do we do?”

Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao were anxious.

They had never expected that the chance that seemed hard to come by would be the trap that the other party set up.

They knew that they had gotten into Imperial Peak long ago.

How did they know?

Abysmal Saint Master didn’t understand but there wasn’t time to worry about it.

On the other side, Jian Wushuang, who was hemmed in by four Great Emperors, relied on his power and defense power to run out of the middle of the golden whirlpool. He was then next to Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao.

Vroom. Jian Wushuang’s divine power soared and his divine body increased in size tremendously. He was almost a hundred times bigger in size.

On such a humongous divine body, his heads and arms extended one after another.

His humongous divine body became a huge spacetime black hole and swallowed everything.

He continuously performed sword principles along with unique sword intentions. He blocked all the attacks from the eight Great Emperors who were attacking Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao.

“Humph! Do you still want to stop all of us with your force alone, just like the last time?”

Ling Zong saw and he humphed coldly. His eyes were shimmering with anger. “Fight all-out!!”

A total of twelve Great Emperors were provoked by Jian Wushuang’s actions.

To fight against twelve of them alone?

Who did Jian Wushuang think the Great Emperors were?

The auras of the twelve Great Emperors increased to their maximum and all of them were going all out.

“Abysmal Saint Master, Emperor Jiu Qiao, leave now!!!”

Jian Wushuang roared. At the same time, he tried his best to resist the attacks of the twelve Great Emperors.

Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao made a prompt decision. They knew if their enemy was well prepared long ago, it would be impossible for them to destroy the Emperor Supreme Rock. The most important task then was for them to survive. Hence, they would have to figure it out after they’d escaped.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

Seizing the time when Jian Wushuang blocked the twelve Great Emperors, Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao rushed out of the golden whirlpool at their fastest possible speeds.

As for Jian Wushuang, he fought as he retreated.

Jian Wushuang wouldn’t be a match to twelve Great Emperors simultaneously.

However, without a doubt, even if the twelve Great Emperors fought all out, it would be impossible for them to kill Jian Wushuang in a short time.

Ever since he had cultivated the first volume of Immemorial Celestial Body, his divine body had become stronger than before. It wouldn’t be easy for his divine body to be damaged.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com
