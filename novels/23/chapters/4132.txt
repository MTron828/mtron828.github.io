4133 Enlightenment River

Supreme Giant Axe and Jian Wushuang, who were standing next to Ruler Blood Wave, could not help but smile.

The three of them came here after leaving the Cyan Stone Palace.

“You are indeed impressive to defeat Ninth Kalpa King, who can use the one-thought divine kingdom in the trial field. However, don’t be complacent just because you won the trial. Ninth Kalpa King lost because his cultivation was suppressed to the same realm as yours. In reality, you are still far from him.” Supreme Giant Axe suddenly looked at Jian Wushuang, he urged.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded. He knew that if they were fighting in the real world, Ninth Kalpa King was the Ultimate Ruler. With the strength of his divine power, his strength could rival that of an Ruler, his battle strength was definitely at the level of an Ruler. Even if he used all his skills, he would still be nothing in front of an Ruler.

The Giant Axe Supreme was afraid that he would become complacent after winning a match, so he reminded him a little.

“It’s good that you understand.” Seeing this, the Giant Axe Supreme said nothing more and smiled.

A moment later, the spirit tea was ready, and the rich fragrance of the tea spread out completely. The Giant Axe Supreme made a cup of tea for Jian Wushuang and asked, “Jian Wushuang, what are your plans next?”

Jian Wushuang pondered for a moment, he replied, “Whether it’s my understanding of sword principle or the comprehension of the universe principles, I’m considered good at the Ruler level. However, my own realm is indeed too low, so I want to break through to the fourth-level Ruler as soon as possible.”

Jian Wushuang knew very well that no matter how good his methods were, his own realm was the foundation.

Now, he was only a third-level Ruler. Although his combat power was comparable to the Ultimate Ruler, and even stronger than ordinary Ultimate Rulers, this level, in the vast universe, still nothing.

It is indeed Jian Wushuang’s top priority to improve his realm and cultivation as soon as possible.

“If I want to break through to the Ruler realm, I’ll need to fuse the principles. I’ve already comprehended the seventh principle a long time ago. What I lack is to fuse the seventh principle. Although I have some ideas, if I continue to fuse the seventh principle step by step, I’ll be able to fuse it. However, my progress will be too slow. It’ll take at least hundreds of thousands of years.”

“Too slow.”

Jian Wushuang shook his head.

Hundreds of thousands of years might only be a blink of an eye for most Rulers.

But for Jian Wushuang, who had only cultivated for more than 300,000 years, hundreds of thousands of years was indeed a long time.

“Ruler’s whereabouts are unknown. I’m afraid that the group of mysterious Supreme experts I met in the Nine Luminaries Galaxy are all targeting Ruler...”

“If I want to figure out everything and find Ruler’s true body, I have to have at least the combat strength of a Supreme expert. That’s the only way to not be afraid of those mysterious Supreme experts.”

“I don’t have much time left.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled. He had already had some guesses when he was chased by one of the mysterious Supreme experts, a Supreme expert named Devour Nine.

There could only be one reason why the Thunder God Palace was flattened and why he was being pursued by Devour Nine. Even the Nine Luminaries Galaxy was almost wiped out by them.

It was because of his Ruler, Xuan Yi.

Jian Wushuang could not help but frown as he thought of this.

On the other hand, Ruler Blood Wave and Giant Axe saw the distress on Jian Wushuang’s face.

“Jian Wushuang, are you troubled by the merging of the Seventh principle?” Ruler Blood Wave looked over.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “The further you go, the more difficult it becomes. Although I’ve obtained some special opportunities and have a general idea of how to merge the seventh principle, it will take a longer time.”

“That’s not a problem.” Ruler Blood Wave smiled. “There are many unique places within the lifeguard palace, as well as some excellent training grounds. For example, the training grounds where you fought against the Ninth Kalpa King were the places where many of the cultivators of the lifeguard palace used to simulate battles. As for the fusion of principles, the lifeguard palace naturally has several training grounds that can aid in the fusion of principles.”

“However, now that you have a clear train of thought, the only thing you lack is time, which makes it even easier. I can introduce you to a place. In the third mountain range, there is a Enlightenment River. Inside, you are fusing the seventh principle, and your speed is definitely several times or even dozens of times faster than other places. You can go there and take a look.”

“In addition, the Enlightenment River is not only helpful to the principles, but also helpful to the comprehension of the universe principles. Didn’t you get two lower-grade divine fruits from the Ninth Kalpa King?

“You can try to eat one when you get to the Enlightenment River. Maybe you can gain something from the universe principles.”

“Enlightenment River?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

“Thank you for telling me, senior.” Jian Wushuang expressed his gratitude to Ruler Blood Wave, then left the temple eagerly and headed for the third mountain range.

Looking at Jian Wushuang’s back, Ruler Blood Wave revealed a playful smile.

“Blood Wave, you mentioned the Enlightenment River to this little guy, but you didn’t mention the River Spirit in the Enlightenment River...why is that?” Supreme Giant Axe looked at him with a strange expression.

“I’ll just tell him about the Enlightenment River. As for the River Spirit, it’s not a big problem. He should be able to deal with it himself.” Supreme Giant Axe raised his eyebrows.

The two Supreme Rulers looked at each other with a faint smile on their lips. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

On the other side, after learning about the existence of the Enlightenment River from Supreme Giant Axe Blood Wave, Jian Wushuang went back to his residence to greet Leng Rushuang. Then he immediately went to the third mountain range.

When he reached the third mountain range, Jian Wushuang found out the location of the Enlightenment River by simply asking someone.

Splash.

Before he got close to the Enlightenment River, Jian Wushuang heard the sound of rushing water. When he got closer, he saw a rolling river that was thousands of feet wide in front of him.

The river was pitch-black. Jian Wushuang subconsciously released his divine sense to check. He could not help but exclaim, “What a rich aura of principles. Not only that, but the aura of the universe principles is also extremely rich.”

He could feel that the aura of principles and the aura of the universe principles in the river was extremely rich. It could be said to be thousands of times more than in the outside world. Whether he was comprehending the principles of Heaven and Earth or the universe principles here..his speed must be much faster than in the outside world.

As for the merging of the seventh principle, the time needed to do so could be greatly shortened.
