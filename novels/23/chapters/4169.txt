4170 Killing

“The Lord Zhennan has never been patient. Let’s not waste any more time. what if the monster comes after us?” The Heavenly Ruler’s voice continued.

In an instant, Star Ruler’s mouth opened wide. He stretched out a trembling finger and pointed at Heavenly Ruler’s back while shaking his head at Jian Wushuang.

“Before…senior! Let me explain, what Lord Zhennan and King of the North? I don’t even understand what he’s saying!” The Star Ruler’s forehead was covered in cold sweat as he explained to Jian Wushuang in a panic.

However, before he could finish…

The Heavenly Ruler, who was walking in front and did not get a response, continued to speak in confusion, “Star Ruler, what’s the matter with you? you were the one who suggested going out to find Lord Zhennan and tell him about the monster. Why are you stopping now?”

The Star Ruler’s body went limp upon hearing this.

In the next moment, he noticed that Jian Wushuang was frowning slightly and there was killing intent in his eyes. he was so angry that the veins on his forehead bulged. he looked at the back of the Heavenly Ruler fiercely and shouted, “Heavenly Ruler! When did I say such a thing? I don’t even know who that Lord Zhennan is, and I’m still going to find him? Don’t you talk nonsense and make slanderous accusations!”

The Star Ruler’s words were so awe-inspiring and powerful that even Jian Wushuang almost believed it.

The Heavenly Ruler, who was walking in front, was startled by this thunderous roar and immediately quivered. Then, a trace of anger appeared on his face. He turned his head and angrily said, “Star Ruler, have you been possessed? you don’t even remember what you said, you, you…”

Before he could finish his sentence, his eyes widened and he was dumbstruck. The words in his mouth became unconsciously repeated.

A black-robed, black-haired youth stood next to the Star Ruler. His hands were clasped behind his back as he looked at the Star Ruler from a distance.

When did this monster come?

The next moment.

The Heavenly Ruler suddenly came back to her senses, and her lips trembled as she said, “S-senior, this has nothing to do with me. It was that Star Ruler guy who incited me to find Lord Zhennan, saying that he wanted to make your matter public.”

Before Jian Wushuang could say anything, the Star Ruler’s vision turned black and he almost fainted from anger.

“Heavenly Ruler, you should die!”

The Star Ruler’s divine power surged as he bristled with rage.

Jian Wushuang finally spoke.

It does not matter whether you went to find Lord Zhennan or not, and it does not matter which one of you suggested it, because the result will be the same…

Clang!

The sound of a sword rang through the sky!

The divine sword Wu Qi appeared in Jian Wushuang’s hand in an instant, and a cold light flashed in his eyes.

“Stop fighting, you two. Die together!!!”

Boom!

In an instant, Jian Wushuang pulled out his sword and a dazzling red light, like a Galaxy, slashed toward the Star Ruler and the Heavenly Ruler!

“Heavenly Ruler, do it!!!”

The Star Ruler roared as he watched the sword that was sweeping toward him.

Rip!

He did not dare to hold back. With a flip of his hand, a Star River Map appeared in front of him.

The star river map expanded in the wind and in just a few breaths, it had reached the point where it could cover the sky and the sun.

The 18 stars in the star River Map were connected together, forming an extremely strong defense. Even an invincible Ultimate Ruler would not be able to break it in a short time. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

In the chaos cycles which he had been in possession of the Galaxy map, it had saved his life countless times during critical moments.

It could be said that it was precisely because of the star River Map that the Star Ruler, who was only an ordinary Ultimate Ruler, dared to venture into the Tarot remains.

However, the star chart was already riddled with holes and could shatter at any moment. Even the Star Ruler was not sure how much defensive power was left.

The star River Map had saved the Star Ruler too many times. It was already beyond its limits.

The Star Ruler clenched his fists as he looked at the blood-red sword radiance that was like a Galaxy. He turned his head to look at the star chart in front of him and muttered to himself,”Old friend, please help me one last time! You have to get through this!”

“Whoosh!!!”

In an instant, the blood-red sword radiance struck the star River Map at an extremely fast speed.

Ka ka ka!

In an instant, the sword light was slightly blocked and was in a stalemate with the star River Map.

The star River Map, on the other hand, let out an unpleasant cracking sound.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered and he raised his eyebrows.

He was carrying two divine swords on his back at the same time. Although he had only pulled out the weeping Wu divine sword, it had already been upgraded to the limit of a principles cardinal treasure. His sword Dao universe origin had also entered the third realm, and the laws of the universe had also increased greatly. Although Jian Wushuang was still a Ruler of the fourth level, his strength was no longer what it used to be.

According to common sense, an ordinary Ultimate Ruler would be killed in an instant when facing Jian Wushuang.

He did not expect that the Star Ruler could block his sword with the star River Map in his hand.

This star-river Map seems to be a Supreme-grade defensive treasure. However, the internal structure of this star-river Map has been severely damaged. It would not last more than a few strikes.

Jian Wushuang shook his head slightly. He looked at the Star Ruler and swung his sword again.

“It’s a pointless struggle!”

Boom!

The weeping Wu divine sword trembled hundreds of billions of times in an instant, and a voice similar to the weeping of gods and the chanting of Buddhas and demons came from the weeping Wu divine sword.

A blood-red sword light that was a hundred times stronger than before slashed out again!

This sword seemed to tear a hole in the sky. The huge Star River Map, which covered the sky, cracked like a spider web under this sword!

Kachakachaa.

Cracks began to spread on the star River Map as if it was going to be torn apart.

Bang bang bang!

The 18 connected stars on the star chart exploded one after another!

In the end, under the Star Ruler’s horrified gaze, the star River Map collapsed and exploded into countless pieces.

On the other hand, the blood-colored sword’s radiance that was like a lightning that could tear apart the night sky slashed toward the Star Ruler once again!

“No!”

The sword shattered the Star Ruler’s divine body with a furious roar and destroyed his body and soul!

The current Jian Wushuang might not be able to compete with the nine tribulations King, but he could definitely be considered as one of the giant arms of the Ultimate Rulers!

“There’s still one more.”

Jian Wushuang’s expression did not change at all after killing Star Ruler. He looked indifferently at Heavenly Ruler in the distance.

Run!!!

In terms of power, the Heavenly Ruler was not as strong as the Star Ruler. When he saw that the Star Ruler was killed by Jian Wushuang with only two slashes, he did not dare to fight anymore.

In an instant, he shot off into the distance.

Jian Wushuang’s expression was calm. With a light tap of his toes, he instantly crossed a thousand miles and appeared behind the Heavenly Ruler. He used his fingers as a sword and slashed at the Heavenly Ruler’s head.

Lord Zhennan, come and save me! I have a big secret to tell you!

“Die!” The Heavenly Ruler used all his strength to shout.
