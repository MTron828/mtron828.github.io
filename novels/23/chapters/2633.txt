Chapter 2634: Royal Blood Gem

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

There was a huge gap between the strength of an Earth Ultimate God and an ordinary Ultimate God.

Jian Wushuang went from the Peak Ultimate God Realm to the Primary-level Earth Ultimate God Realm. Thereby, his overall strength was greatly improved.

“Now, even if I don’t use The Stately Painting and settle with just having a few secret techniques, I should be able to compete against the ordinary Heaven Ultimate Gods.” Jian Wushuang clasped his hands tightly. He looked surprised.

Soon, Jian Wushuang walked out of the attic.

After walking out, he did not deliberately conceal his aura.

He was originally giving away the aura of a Primary-level Earth Ultimate God. Under the cover of the black stone, he exuded an aura of a Peak Earth Ultimate God.

Jian Wushuang went up into the void and wandered around the Blood Gem mineral vein.

A tens of thousands cultivators were gathered in the huge mineral vein, mining the Blood Gem.

Suddenly, something that was happening on a big tree not far away attracted Jian Wushuang’s attention.

That big tree was located at a high place. Hence, it was conspicuous. However, what really caught Jian Wushuang’s attention was that there were more than a dozen dead bodies hanging from the trunk of the big tree.

Those corpses hanging from the tree trunk were obviously there as a warning.

“Cang Heng,” Jian Wushuang spoke, his voice echoing.

Cang Heng came up behind Jian Wushuang in just a jiffy.

“What’s going on?” Jian Wushuang pointed at the dozen corpses hanging from the tree and asked in a cold tone.

“Master, those people were killed by the inspector ten days ago,” Cang Heng replied, “It’s such a big mineral vein with a tens of thousands of people mining. Some people escaped the Official Army surveillance and stole some of the Blood Gems. This is inevitable. However, the inspector did an ad hoc body search on some cultivators who were mining. He forcibly searched for some treasures on them. As a result, more than a dozen people were found to be hiding some Blood Gems.

“In fact, the amount found on them wasn’t much, mostly one catty or two catties. The inspector killed them nonetheless and then left them hanging on the tree. Besides, he also reprimanded the Official Army for not doing a good job.”

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly after hearing it.

He knew that was beating the dog before the lion to serve as a deterrent to the miners. The inspector had not done anything wrong but Jian Wushuang thought that the inspector was heavy-handed.

“Did Jin Yihang ask to check the Official Army’s Interspatial Rings?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“No, he didn’t,” answered Cang Heng.

“Okay, pass the order to those Divine Demon Realm miners that I’ll pay them three times more than the original agreed amount after they’re done with it. Tell them to work honestly and don’t try to get out of line. Otherwise, they might survive if the Official Army found out but they won’t be that lucky with the inspector. I won’t be able to save them if it happens,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Cang Heng nodded.

“By the way, have you distributed the Primordial Stones that I gave to all the army brothers?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, it’s all done.” Cang Heng cracked a smile immediately. “Master, you gave us ten million Primordial Stones at one go. All of us got quite a fair bit after the division. The Peak Divine Demon Realm armies received around hundreds each, Primary-level Ultimate God Seargents and High-level Ultimate God Captains received a little bit more and of course, the commanders enjoyed a bigger amount.”

“The brothers in the army are very grateful for Master.”

Cang Heng was telling the truth.

Jian Wushuang received 15 Divine Elixir Pills from Crimson Stone Fort which he needed all of it for himself. Then again, he would never mistreat his Official Army so he took out 10 million Primordial Stones to distribute among the armies.

There were 10,000 men in each battalion and there were altogether 10 battalions. Each of the armies got a fair share from the pool of Primordial Stones, especially the ten commanders. They were grateful to their Territorial Lord—Jian Wushuang.

“Okay, let the brothers continue to be on guard. I’ll fork out another batch of Primordial Stones to distribute among the brothers when the mining is over and the Crimson Stone Fort officials have left.” Jian Wushuang smiled, waved his hand and returned to the camp. Then, he began cultivating on his own.

Thereafter, the Blood Gem mining was progressing smoothly.

With Jian Wushuang’s promise, many of the Divine Demon Realm miners were able to keep mining with a peace of mind. There were not many of them who would risk getting caught stealing the Blood Gems.

Actually, they had no idea what the Blood Gem was and how much it cost. They would not want to risk the consequences of stealing when Jian Wushuang had clearly given them a good promise.

In addition, what Jin Yihang did earlier served the deterrence effect. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Two years had passed.

This mineral vein was extremely huge and there were billions of catties of Blood Gems. It was extremely high in value and it was extremely difficult to mine. Therefore, after the few ten thousand Demon Demon Realm cultivators had been mining for two years, they had only managed to complete one-third of it.

Back in the camp, Jian Wushuang was sitting in the attic, quietly comprehending the Fentian Scroll.

Without warning...

“Master.” Cang Heng’s voice came from outside the attic.

Jian Wushuang slowly opened his eyes. “Commander Cang Heng, what’s the matter?”

“Something is on. Come and have a look quickly.” Cang Heng sounded anxious.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate. He put away the Fengtian scroll and went out with Cang Heng.

Soon, Cang Heng led Jian Wushuang to one of the mines.

There were countless mines where the few tens of thousand people were mining.

Jian Wushuang arrived at an ordinary mine.

There were two commanders with several Divine Demon Realm miners in the mine.

“Cang Heng, what is going on?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Master, look at that.” Cang Heng pointed in one direction.

Jian Wushuang glanced over and what he saw was a stone wall in the mine. The stone wall was made of blocks of Blood Gems. The gems were in light hazy blood color. Those gems were the Blood Gems.

However, among the many Blood Gems on the stone wall, Jian Wushuang spotted a piece of gem in a much darker shade than the other Blood Gems. It was a complete blood-red in color.

The other Blood Gems were in a faint blood color and some had blood streaks in them, but the one that Jian Wushuang saw was deep red in color like blood!

“Could this be the legendary Royal Blood Gem?” Jian Wushuang went wide-eyed in surprise and his heart was beating fast.
