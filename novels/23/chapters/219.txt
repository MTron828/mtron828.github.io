“Third brother, you actually have more talent than Zaixuan. It’s possible if you want to be a disciple of an expert at the level of the Divine Transcendence. Do you want me to introduce you to some of the great experts in Alchemy School? We also have a couple of experts of Divine Transcendence,” said Wang Yuan with a smile.

“Ha-ha.” Jian Wushuang smiled vaguely. “I guess I don’t need it presently.”

Wang Yuan raised his eyebrows, not saying anything.

“By the way, Third Brother, Fourth Sister, what are your upcoming plans?” Wang Yuan asked again.

“I’m preparing to go back to the Ice Nether Valley,” Su Rou answered softly.

Jian Wushuang and Wang Yuan immediately looked over at Su Rou.

“I’ve been gone for too long and Master has urged me more than once to go back,” said Su Rou.

“Master?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“Ye Chen has a good reputation, but I always think that he is hypocritical.” Wang Yuan pursed his lips.

“He is a good person.” Su Rou argued timidly.

Wang Yuan didn’t comment much, but turned to Jian Wushuang. “What about you, Third Brother? How about going back to the Alchemy School with me? The Holy Emperor Palace may be strong, but the Alchemy School is capable of protecting you.”

“Protect me?” Jian Wushuang shook his head slightly. “I will pay a visit to the Alchemy School in future, but I’m afraid I won’t go with you now.”

Jian Wushuang didn’t want to seek shelter under someone else’s roof.

He might find Wang Yuan at the Alchemy School one day, but for now, things were not that bad.

“Well, there’s one place I’d really like now,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Where?” Wang Yuan asked.

“The Innumerable Huge Mountains,” Jian Wushuang said.

“I’ll send you off,” Wang Yuan said.

“Alright,” Jian Wushuang didn’t refuse him this time.

Then they set off again. Su Rou parted from them in the Tianzong Dynasty.

Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang, Wang Yuan, and his attendants headed to the Innumerable Huge Mountains. Soon after, they appeared above the mountains.

“Third Brother, I’ll see you off here. I will go back to the Alchemy School. If you’re in need of any help, you can go to the place where I locked up Lin Yun. It’s one of the contacting points of the Alchemy School. The people on guard can contact me,” said Wang Yuan.

“Okay,” Jian Wushuang said and nodded slightly.

“I shall go now.” Wang Yuan patted the Purple Cloud Condor he was riding as he finished speaking. The Purple Cloud Condor flapped its wings, and soon disappeared from Jian Wushuang’s sight with the group of purple-robed people.

After Wang Yuan left, Jian Wushuang took a breath and had a focused look in his eyes.

“Previously, I thought my enemy was only the Blood Feather Tower. But now I know the Blood Feather Tower is nothing more than a decoy. The Holy Emperor Palace is the monster manipulating them.”

“After all, my strength is too weak. I initially wanted to be admitted by those old sects in the Easternmost Hunting. However, none of the old sects may even accept me since they knew that the Holy Emperor Palace wanted to kill me.”

“As for the Alchemy School... it is true that they can act as a counterweight to the Holy Emperor Palace, but I have to bother Wang Yuan if I want to seek for a shelter there. Even if I do enter the Alchemy School, I have to spend the rest of my life hiding there, which is definitely something I do not want.”

“Therefore, it seems that I have to depend on no one but myself!”

“The only place that can strengthen my skills is the Ancestor’s Land!”

Jian Wushuang stared at the abyss in the Innumerable Huge Mountains, with a shimmer in his eyes.

Thereafter, he headed for the abyss.

The abyss was known as the first Impasse in the Innumerable Huge Mountains.

Jian Wushuang also knew underneath the abyss was the Ancestor’s Land.

The last time Jian Wushuang entered the abyss was to escape the haunt of the Blood Feather Tower. He had no choice but to jump in the abyss for survival.

Now Jian Wushuang looked at the dark abyss that appeared so deep that he could not see the bottom. Streaks of cold wind swirled inside the abyss, fierce and strong.

He jumped off without hesitation.

As he jumped into the abyss, a chilling wind swept over him. At once, a layer of Spiritual Shield emerged from his body, blocking the cold wind with easiness.

He kept hurtling downwards, and eventually landed at the bottom of the abyss.

After regaining his balance, Jian Wushuang looked up dizzily.

“The abyss is badly perceived by many, but in fact, I meet no danger except for the chilling wind. Perhaps any Yin Void expert is able to easily come here,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

Just as he finished speaking...

“Hum.”

A cold sneer rang out abruptly. The next moment, Jian Wushuang saw the honest strong man who had given him the Selfless Sword Technique at the Sword Tomb and a beautiful woman who stood next to him.

The woman was beautiful but kept a cold face.

The two people walked towards him slowly.

“Thanks to the Triple-kill Sword, you didn’t meet any trouble along the way in the abyss. As for others, even a Yang Void Realm warrior, would find it extremely dangerous to get to the bottom. Even if they got here, we would kill them right away,” the absolute beauty said in a cold voice.

Seeing the stunning beauty and the strong man, Jian Wushuang bent himself a little. “Glad to meet you again.”

“Little boy, you’ve come here again?” The woman looked over at Jian Wushuang indifferently.

“I remember telling you to come back only if you break through to the Yin-Yang Void Realm. But now you are only in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm. So what are you doing here?” said the strong man.

The beautiful woman and the strong man were a little frustrated. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Previously when Jian Wushuang was here, he was quite weak, only in the Initial Gold Core Realm. Since he came to the abyss with no other choice, they did not hold it against him and even gave him some gifts.

However, they warned him the last time not to come back until he reached Yin-Yang Void Realm.

But Jian Wushuang came here with only Exceptional Gold Core Realm.

“I come here to take the trial of the Ancestor’s Land,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“Take the trial? You?” The beautiful woman looked down at him with a hint of scorn in her eyes.

“Boy, don’t you know that only an expert of the Yin-Yang Void Realm was qualified to take the simplest first trial of the three trials of the Ancestor’s Land?” The strong man yelled.

“I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “But I also know that my father took the trial with the Exceptional Gold Core Realm, and he passed it.”

“You are not your father. He was extremely talented and he had extraordinary strength in battle at that time. That’s why we broke the rule and let him take the trial, but you... Do you think you can compare with your father?” the beautiful woman said in a low voice.

“I can!”

Jian Wushuang nodded without hesitation.
