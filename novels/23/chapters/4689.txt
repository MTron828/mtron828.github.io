4690 The Young Emperor (2)

Jian Wushuang half-leaned in front of the haystack and said slowly, “I’m not some Emperor you’re talking about. I’m just a wandering cloud, a wild crane.”

Chun Qiu did not say anything more and just smiled in return.

“Why were you captured here as a prisoner?” Jian Wushuang turned to look at him and said.

“Because I was defeated.” Chun Qiu did not hide anything and said slowly, “My father was once an Emperor, but he died in the war. As the son of the Emperor, although I was spared from being slaughtered, I became a prisoner. It would be better to have died back then. At least I would have died happy.”

“Do you know how many years I’ve been in this state?” Chun Qiu laughed at himself. “Even the birth and death of the galaxies in the universe has already begun countless cycles.”

“I’ve always wanted to leave this place, but it’s just an extravagant hope.”

Jian Wushuang did not speak. It was difficult to remove the imprisoning chain on his neck, which greatly limited his ability. He could die if he was careless.

So he could not do anything or say anything now. He had to wait for the right time.

Time passed by bit by bit, and several days later, the deathly silent prison suddenly rang with the sound of hurried footsteps.

After which, close to ten black-robed figures appeared.

Jian Wushuang, who was slowly recovering his Yan power, only took a glance and knew that there were at least two Ancestor realm experts among the ten people.

One of the skinny old men took a step forward. After glancing at him and Chun Qiu, he raised his palm and grabbed at the two of them.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold. At the same time, he struck out with his palm and used his spiritual Yan power to offset the skinny elder’s palm print.

The skinny old man’s eyes flashed with a touch of shock. Then, he took a deep breath and said, “Are you going to disobey my order?”

Jian Wushuang looked at him calmly, then stood up and walked out slowly. Chun Qiu followed closely behind.

As he was escorted out of the prison, Jian Wushuang saw a vast square.

In front of the vast square, there was an ancient bronze hall located in the clouds and smoke. The clouds and smoke on it changed into various scenes, which were quite mysterious.

Jian Wushuang strolled forward like a majestic Emperor and did not look like a prisoner at all.

The skinny old man was quite resentful about this, but from the fight just now, he could tell that the person the Young Emperor wanted to see was not someone he could fight against.

Chun Qiu, who was following Jian Wushuang closely, raised his head and looked at the bronze hall. The corners of his eyes, which were already slightly wrinkled, trembled. Hatred flashed for a moment before he calmed down again.

The 1,000-feet-tall bronze door opened heavily, and hundreds of clouds drifted out, transforming into chasers and cloud butterflies that circled in front of everyone.

In the depths of the giant Hall, a figure dressed in luxurious clothes, half leaning on a magnificent bed, opened his eyes and looked outside the hall.

“Welcome to this Emperor’s sleeping palace, everyone.” He raised his eyebrows and smiled, slowly raising his arms.

“Greetings, Young Emperor.” the ten-some black-robed wardens knelt down and said respectfully.

With a gentle wave of his hand, the luxuriously dressed figure known as the Young Emperor said softly, “You may all leave. No one is allowed to step in without my order.”

The group of black-robed wardens acknowledged and left the hall.

Getting off the bed barefooted, the Young Emperor stretched lazily and walked forward slowly.

With every step he took, an identical True Shadow appeared behind him. There were already dozens of True Shadows in the originally empty and silent hall.

Extremely dense Yan power filled every corner of the space.

Looking at the increasing number of figures in front of him, Jian Wushuang’s pupils moved slightly. He could feel that all the True Shadows were in the Yan Immortal realm.

This Young Emperor’s strength was unfathomable, and even he felt an inexplicable sense of danger.

A total of nearly a hundred identical True Shadows gathered together, and a strong fragrance with a faint fishy smell assailed his nose.

“Newcomer, do you know where I am?” a True Shadow clung to Jian Wushuang and asked.

Chun Qiu, who had taken a few steps back, was filled with fear. His hand was already gripping his dagger tightly.

Jian Wushuang stood still like a mountain. He closed his eyes for a moment and then opened them again. He looked straight at one of the figures.

Their eyes met and the Young Emperor smiled. He clapped and the hundreds of True Shadows merged into one.

“You do have some ability, but why haven’t I seen you before?” The Young Empyrean Lord laughed and then looked at Chun Qiu behind him. “Eh, I’ve seen you before. The son of Emperor Fenghua, Chun Qiu?”

Chun Qiu’s expression changed drastically, and hatred crawled all over his face. His right hand, which was holding the dagger tightly, suddenly swung out, and the powerful Yan power directly stabbed the Young Emperor’s heart.

The corners of his mouth curled up, and he stood in place without dodging.

In the next moment, the space rippled, and a thin hidden figure in a purple robe appeared.

At the same time, an even more powerful force destroyed Chun Qiu’s attack and smashed into his body.

Chun Qiu groaned as he was sent flying back a few dozen meters, only stopping after he crashed into the bronze door.

He spat out a large mouthful of divine blood. At the same time, many supreme treasures enshrouded in a purple glow fell to the ground.

The Young Emperor’s expression froze. How could he not know what the treasures that fell from Chun Qiu’s arms were? He reached out and all the treasures flew into his hands.

“You killed the Yan Immortal at the black mountains?!” The Young Emperor’s expression turned cold, and he waved his palm to kill Chun Qiu.

However, at this moment, Jian Wushuang suddenly stood in front of Chun Qiu and said, “I killed the Yan Immortal. It has nothing to do with him.”

The Young Emperor retracted his palm as if nothing had happened. He turned around and walked slowly with his hands behind his back.

“Shan Ling, the man who guards the black mountains, is in the Yan Immortal cultivation realm. I’d like to know how you killed him with the chains still on you.”

The deathly silence hall suddenly surged with violent Yan power. The thin figure in the purple robe moved and directly hit Jian Wushuang with his palm.

The Yan power was wielded masterfully. It was mighty, but it did not leak out at all. Even the air did not move. However, the terrifying power contained in it made Jian Wushuang not dare to be careless. He directly activated Yan power to resist it. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The seemingly ordinary palm strike directly pushed him back a few feet, and the raging force dissipated.

Enduring the boiling divine blood in his body, Jian Wushuang was about to fight again when the skinny purple-robed man stopped and turned, walking to the back of the Young Emperor.

“You have some skills. No wonder you could kill a Yan Immortal even with the seal.” The Young Emperor Lord turned around slowly, his eyes gleaming.

“But you have to know that the Yan Immortal in the black mountains is my right-hand man. If you kill him, you’ll be cutting off one of my arms. How should we settle this?”

Jian Wushuang did not speak, but he had adjusted his Yan power to the peak. If they were to fight, he was confident that he could severely injure the Young Emperor.
