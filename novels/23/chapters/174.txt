Chapter 175: Nine Emperors Sect

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

That’s Jian Wushuang, the best and peerless genius on the Earthly Dragon List!

If everything went well, he would attain the level of the Yin-Yang Void Realm in future. Once he reached the Yin-Yang Void Realm, he would rank on the Heavenly Dragon List. His future looked promising if he was given more time to improve himself.

How precious was the favor of such a peerless genius?

It was more valuable than those treasures promised by Palace Master White, at least as far as these Golden Dragon Ambassadors were concerned.

“Wushuang, my friends, you can rest assured that we won’t give up now that we’re invited here,” Shui Minghao said and smiled. In fact, he had hesitated when he first knew that he might have to fight with the Blood Feather Tower. Now, his expression showed that he seemed to have calmed down.

“Yeah! Now we’re here, how could we give up so easily?”

“Though the Blood Feather Tower has incredible skills, we, the Golden Dragon Ambassadors, aren’t weak either.”

Other Golden Dragon Ambassadors also started to say something.

“So now, we have to discuss what we should do next,” Jian Wushuang said, taking out a datum.

This was the most detailed datum about the Nine Emperors Sect collected by the Golden-dragon Palace, including the environmental structure of the Nine Emperors Sect and the basic information of its powerhouses. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After a simple discussion, they made a decision.

“The Upper Elder who always practices alone in the Nine Emperors Sect is the strongest one among all the elders. Since he seldom goes out, his response would be slower. Let’s sneak up on him. We’d better kill one or two superiors of the Yin Void Realm before they react,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Brother Ye, Mr. Shui, you’re the strongest among us. You hide secretly until we complete the sneak attack. Once the Upper Elder of the Nine Emperors Sect shows up, Brother Ye, you stop him. Mr. Shui will continue to hide himself, just in case reinforcements are needed.”

“After all, some experts from the Blood Feather Tower are likely to be hidden here, we have to do something to keep us safe.”

“Got it!” The seven Golden Dragon Ambassadors, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou agreed with him.

Once they had decided on the strategy, they took action.

...

The Nine Emperors Sect had numerous followers. In the sect, there was boisterous atmosphere everywhere.

There was a courtyard near the mountain wall of the Nine Emperors Sect, where the perimeter was heavily guarded. Only the leaders from the core of the Nine Emperors Sect were qualified to enter this place.

At this moment, a young man in an elegant robe was brandishing his Long Sword at the center of this courtyard. His motions were continuous, causing light to be reflected from the blade and showing immense power.

The young man was using the Sword Essence of Raging Fire. His comprehension of this essence showed that his skill was great enough to challenge the Seventh Level of Dragon Gate. In addition to his Cultivation of Spiritual Power of the Exceptional Gold Core Realm, his actual strength was comparable to a Powerhouse of the Earthly Dragon List.

Suddenly, that young man struck his sword aggressively towards a wooden stake which had been erected in the yard.

Crack!

The seemingly sturdy wooden stake disintegrated instantly with wood chips flying in every direction.

On seeing the destruction of the wooden stake, the young man looked gloomy.

If he had truly mastered that skill, the stake should have been split cleanly into two halves instead of disintegrating into wood chips. Obviously, he had a long way to go before truly grasping the skill.

“Damn it!”

“I’ve already spent more than half a month on this, but there’s no progress! Old geezer, have you been genuinely teaching me or are you deliberately leading me on?” the young man shouted.

The so-called geezer was the white-haired man who sat on the stone bench, drinking alone.

This white-haired man was not that old in terms of biological age, in fact, he was middle-aged. However, he had messy white hair and a face filled with melancholy, deep wrinkles. Along with the beard he kept, it was easy to mistake him as an old man at first glance.

He held the flagon with his right hand, which was covered in calluses. This showed that he had been using the sword for a long time. There was a wooden sword on the stone table in front of him.

Hearing what that cold-faced youth said, the white-haired man looked at him with dark eyes and said in an icy voice, “Cause you are too stupid.”

“Stupid?” That cold-faced youth was enraged. He rushed towards the white-haired man and grabbed the flagon from him.

Pia!

The flagon was thrown to the ground and broke into pieces.

The cold-faced young guy pointed to the white-haired man and shouted,”Geezer, remember where you are now. I’m warning you, if you withhold anything when you teach me swordsmanship, you’ll never get a good day ever!”

Though the white-haired man frowned slightly as he heard those words, his eyes maintained their cool gaze. He picked up another flagon with his hand and continued to drink. He was not in the mood to talk to him anymore.

The cold youth became angrier and shouted, “You! Geezer!”

At this moment...

“Changfeng.” Suddenly a voice was heard and then a gray-robed elder walked slowly into the yard.

“Father,” the cold youth said respectfully.

The cold-faced young man was named Ma Changfeng and his father was that grey-robed elder, the Third-Elder of Nine Emperors Sect, an expert of the Yin Void Realm. Though Ma Qinghai was just at the level of the Initial Yin Void Realm, his status was highly respected in the Nine Emperors Sect.

Ma Qinghai looked at his beloved son, “What’s wrong?”

He had become a father at an old age so he spoiled his son and would try to satisfy all his whims.

There were few Powerhouses who had mastered Sword Principle in the Nine Emperors Sect. But his son loved Sword Principle, so he had used his status to allow his son to freely enter the courtyard to consult that jailed white-haired man on Sword Principle problems.

“Father, I’ve endeavored to perfect the swordsmanship before but I couldn’t make it. Now, under the teaching of this elder, I’ve still made no progress, even after half a month! He must be fooling me!” Ma Changfeng said gloomily.

“What?” Ma Qinghai looked at that white-haired man,?“Mr. Jian Nantian, how could this be?”

“I’ve said it before.” The white-haired man said in a deep voice and glanced at Ma Qinghai, “I’ve taught him, but hopelessly, he’s too stupid to understand it.”

Ma Changfeng shouted indignantly, “Bastard!”

Ma Qinghai’s face darkened. He said, “Jian Nantian, watch your attitude! You just need to do what my son asked you to! You shouldn’t complain, or you will suffer from the Bone Dissolving Powder again.”
