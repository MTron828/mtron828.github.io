Chapter 3705: The Winner Is Decided?

“A complete swordsmanship system?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.

Once upon a time, he also wanted to create a complete swordsmanship system.

Therefore, there was the later Peerless Sword Manual. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, as Di Shisan said, the Peerless Sword manual was full of offensive swordsmanship, but it did not even have a single defensive swordsmanship. It was indeed incomplete.

On the other hand, Di Shisan’s swordsmanship was based on the sword world, which evolved into the Emperor Sword and the hidden sword, which could be used for both offense and defense.

The sword world itself was equivalent to the realm of swordsmanship. At that time, the impact of the sea of sword essence had always affected Jian Wushuang.

In addition to what Di Shisan had said, his swordsmanship was indeed a complete system.

Moreover, this swordsmanship system was like a magic array. It could complement each other, attack and defense, and advance and retreat at the same time.

This swordsmanship was indeed powerful.

Di Shisan, who was once known as the number one sword principle genius in the Divine Beginning Realm, was finally experienced by Jian Wushuang today.

There were many aspects in his opponent’s swordsmanship that he could not compare with.

And this was because he had made great progress in sword principle and swordsmanship over the past 30 years by comprehending the secret inscriptions in the Heaven Suppression Tablet. Otherwise, he would have been defeated by Di Shisan in the contest of sword principle.

“Di Shisan, I’d like to see whether your swordsmanship system is really complete and whether it’s really that powerful.” Jian Wushuang licked his lips and attacked again in the next moment.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Sword light flashed and activated the universe origin of sword principle.

On the battlefield, Jian Wushuang had displayed his swordsmanship to the fullest.

He had displayed the several sword skills in the Wushuang Sword Manual, Purple Charm, Sword Rainbow, and other sword skills he had created in that special space and time, as well as Star Fire Burning Sun, a seventh-level advanced absolute art created by Jian Wushuang.

He attacked again and again, trying to break through Di Shisan’s hidden sword while fighting against the Emperor 13 Emperor Sword.

Unfortunately, Di Shisan’s hidden sword seemed to be integrated with the entire sword world. This sword technique was almost flawless. Even Starfire Burning Sun could not move the hidden sword, and Jian Wushuang’s other sword techniques could not break it either.

On the other hand, Di Shisan’s emperor sword did not seem to be very powerful, but the key was that it was easy for him to use it. With a casual attack, dozens of sword lights and dozens of emperor swords slashed at Jian Wushuang at the same time, which brought great trouble to Jian Wushuang.

There was also the sea of sword essence that was constantly being attacked. During the battle, Di Shisan even performed several other sword skills derived from the sword world, and one of them was extremely powerful, it was not much weaker than Jian Wushuang’s Star Fire Burning Sun.

Anyone with a discerning eye could see that Jian Wushuang was at an absolute disadvantage.

It was normal. As long as he could not break the hidden sword, Di Shisan would be invincible from the very beginning.

“As expected of Di Shisan. His self-created sword technique system can be attacked from afar and defended from close range. Moreover, it is impeccable. Even Heavenly Sword Marquis could not do anything against Di Shisan’s sword technique in the sword world.”

“In fact, Heavenly Sword Marquis’ swordsmanship is already very powerful and terrifying, especially that sword that suddenly erupted like a raging fire. Its power is really terrifying and it is so powerful that it is suffocating. However, even that sword can’t break through Di Shisan’s hidden sword.”

“This Di Shisan, I don’t know how he created this swordsmanship. It’s really too powerful.”

The surrounding spectators all praised him.

They could see that Jian Wushuang was at a disadvantage in this battle. However, they did not feel that Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship was weak. It was because Di Shisan’s swordsmanship system was too powerful and too abnormal.

Even the Rulers sighed secretly when they saw the scene in front of them.

“It seems that the winner is decided,” Xuan Yan said with a smile.

“What a pity.” The leader of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance sighed, “Actually, in terms of comprehension of the Sword Dao universe origin, Heavenly Sword Marquis isn’t any weaker than Di Shisan. However, in terms of the sword techniques created by both sides, Di Shisan is still slightly stronger.”

“If it was a head-on battle, our little friend Heavenly Sword Marquis wouldn’t be any weaker than Di Shisan. In fact, he might even be a little stronger. Unfortunately, Di Shisan has already created a complete sword technique system and is almost invincible in the sword world. With the same level of power, our little friend Heavenly Marquis really can’t do anything about it.” The Temporal Temple Master added.

“It’s normal for him to lose. After all, Di Shisan has been passed down since the era of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect. Moreover, Di Shisan has stayed at the level of a Principles Master for a very long time. He has been studying the way of the sword for a very long time. That’s why he was able to create this complete sword technique system. As for Heavenly Sword Marquis, the time he has spent practicing is still too short. Moreover, he hasn’t grasped the origin of the universe of Sword Dao for too long. He still has a long way to go in terms of sword techniques.”

“However, it’s only a matter of time before he surpasses Di Shisan in the future,” the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master said.

“I hope this battle won’t be a big blow to the Heavenly Sword Marquis,” the Temporal Temple Master sighed.

Among the three Rulers, Xuan Yan was the only one who was better, but the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and the Temporal Temple Master felt it was a pity.

They actually hoped that Jian Wushuang could defeat Di Shisan in this battle, but the reality was…

“Jian Wushuang, you can’t break my hidden sword. Admit defeat.”

On the battlefield, Di Shisan stared at Jian Wushuang with a cold expression.

From the beginning to the end of the battle, Di Shisan appeared extremely calm. On the other hand, Jian Wushuang had been forced into a sorry state by Di Shisan’s swordsmanship.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang had never been able to break Di Shisan’s hidden sword. Therefore, in many people’s eyes, the outcome of the battle was already decided.

However, after hearing Di Shisan’s words, Jian Wushuang smiled. “Di Shisan, the swordsmanship system that you created really impressed me and gave me a lot of inspiration. I didn’t expect that swordsmanship could form such a complete system. It could even evolve on its own and complement each other.”

“I have to thank you for teaching me a lesson. However, it’s unlikely that you want me to admit defeat so easily.”

“Oh?” Di Shisan looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

Jian Wushuang still did not recognize the current situation. Could it be that he still had some trump cards in sword principle that he had not used?

“Di Shisan, I admit that if I fought you 30 years ago, I would never be your match. But now, I might not be your match.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“Do you have a stronger sword skill?” Di Shisan’s eyes flashed with a hint of surprise.

Jian Wushuang smiled in tacit agreement.

It was true that the strongest sword skill he had created 30 years ago was Starfire Burning Sun.

However, in the past 30 years, he had been comprehending secret inscriptions under the Heaven Suppression Tablet and had made great progress in sword principle. Therefore, he had made a great breakthrough in sword skill.

Now, he had indeed created a sword art that was far stronger than the spark burning the sun!
