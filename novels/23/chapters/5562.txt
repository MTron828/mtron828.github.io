Chapter 5564: Zhuang Zhong

Boom!

Zhuang Zhong’s physical body instantly turned into powder, even his breath was completely extinguished.

Splatter!

After the tremendous force subsided, relying on the faint trace of vitality lingering in the space, Zhuang Zhong quickly restored his form.

However, his aura weakened noticeably, indicating that he had been injured.

Zhuang Zhong was deeply shocked, the opponent’s strength was clearly only at the Half-Step Tribulation level, yet they managed to injure him.

For a moment, he dared not underestimate the opponent any longer.

Shen Ling Frolasa, gasping for breath, once again blocked Zhuang Zhong’s path.

With just one move, it consumed one-tenth of his Origin Source.

It can be considered an exchange of injuries.

If he really could not stop Zhuang Zhong, he would try to consume his strength as much as possible.

By then, Fuego should be able to handle it.

“Do I need to intervene now?” Fuego also paid attention and transmitted his voice to Frolasa.

He was genuinely concerned that Frolasa might not be able to hold back Zhuang Zhong.

Jian Wushuang was also conflicted. The current situation was uncertain, and he didn’t know if it was good or bad.

If Fuego hadn’t regained his strength, he would never be able to leave.

But if Fuego had recovered, he feared it might be a case of exploiting an advantage ruthlessly.

Frolasa shook his head slowly, calm and composed, without transmitting his voice but speaking loudly, “No need to worry about me!”

“Are you so confident?” Zhuang Zhong was somewhat surprised, genuinely intimidated by Shen Ling Frolasa.

The previous move did indeed harm his Origin Source, putting him in a dilemma for the moment.

Emerging from the underground world, he had faced countless difficulties.

When Qishen fell, the first batch of Tribulation-level powerhouses were all suppressed in the depths of the underground, imprisoned in a furnace, serving as fuel for the Qishen Temple.

Now that he had finally escaped, he didn’t want to face trouble as soon as he came out.

Seeing the hesitation in the opponent, Frolasa’s expression gradually turned cold. This was exactly what he wanted. Although he didn’t know how the opponent managed to survive, since the opponent had just appeared, he probably didn’t want to fight to the death.

“Feel free to try!”

Zhuang Zhong stared at Frolasa, somewhat uncertain, and asked, “The power emanating from that great formation is the power of Life?”

When he first came out, he didn’t pay much attention, but now that he could feel the power of the formation, he discovered that the force contained within the formation was actually the power of Life.

In ancient times, to obtain a large amount of Life power, one needed to expend countless Origin Source of All Things to refine it. Now, the Life power contained in that formation was exceptionally powerful. It seemed not to be refined from the power of All Things, but rather, it originated from a cultivator’s body.

This surprised him greatly.

At first, he didn’t believe Frolasa’s words, but now he understood a bit.

Within the great formation, there was also a presence, and the power of that presence was similar to his own, both at the Tribulation realm, and it did not seem weak.

“Wanna chat?” Zhuang Zhong retracted the aura around him and looked at Frolasa with a hint of a smile.

Frolasa felt a twinge of joy; it seemed he had succeeded.

Of course, they could chat. As long as he could stall the other party, once Fuego regained his strength, he would surely slaughter the opponent.

However, before he could answer, the sky began to darken, and a massive vortex began to form.

Both of them were momentarily stunned by this scene.

Frolasa was well-prepared; he knew that Zhen Ling would definitely be unable to resist entering. However, he didn’t expect it to happen so coincidentally—just as he had dealt with Zhuang Zhong, the other party arrived.

Zhuang Zhong, on the other hand, was a bit puzzled by all of this.

The vortex slowly formed, and the power within it leaked out, every strand enough to make even the Universe Master fall.

This was also why this place was one-way; even a powerhouse at the level of the Fifth Tribulation realm couldn’t break through.

In the beginning, only Qishen could freely open this place; others were unable to do so.

The three Divine Masters were powerless to destroy this location.

Exhale!

In the depths of the vortex, faint figures appeared.

Jian Wushuang was familiar with the person leading them. Indeed, it was Zhen Ling.

Although his appearance hadn’t changed, his body underwent a drastic transformation.

That was not all; behind Zhen Ling, dozens of peculiar beings, each terrifyingly grotesque.

Zhen Ling had descended!

This put Jian Wushuang in an awkward position.

Zhen Ling glared with small eyes, sweeping a glance that spoke volumes. Jian Wushuang had completely betrayed them.

One person, however, surprised him.

“Zhuang Zhong!”

“And you are?” Zhuang Zhong was equally astonished. He didn’t know the other’s lineage, but he could sense a familiar aura, that of Qishen, emitting from the person.

Feeling this aura, Zhuang Zhong quickly retreated.

The intimidating force of Qishen was too overwhelming for Zhuang Zhong, a transcendent being who had passed through the first tribulation. Not to mention Qishen, even the Universe Master who had overcome the first three calamities would shudder in his presence.

“No!” Zhuang Zhong quickly realized. Although he felt the similarity between Zhen Ling’s aura and Qishen’s, it was weaker, barely stronger than his own, if at all.

He almost fell for Zhen Ling’s bluff.

“Why are you here?” Zhen Ling didn’t pay attention to Frolasa beside him. Instead, he questioned why Zhuang Zhong had appeared in this place.

Apart from Frolasa, some other transcendent beings were suppressed in the purgatory, becoming a part of the Qishen Temple.

How did Zhuang Zhong suddenly appear here?

Zhen Ling suddenly turned to look at Frolasa.

Frolasa knew what the other was thinking but remained unresponsive.

This turn of events made the situation somewhat perplexing.

Zhuang Zhong’s appearance disrupted the plans of the two.

Originally, Zhen Ling’s descent was to either kill or detain Frolasa and Fuego.

Shen Ling just wanted peace; in 100,000 years, they would find a way to leave this place.

However, Zhuang Zhong’s appearance completely threw the situation into chaos.

Regardless of which side one stood on, there was now a certainty of victory.

If he helped Frolasa, then Zhen Ling’s avatar would definitely lose. There was no possibility of winning.

Even if they couldn’t defeat Zhen Ling now, they could at least delay it.

For Jian Wushuang at this moment, it couldn’t get any better. Not only could he leave, but at least he wouldn’t be held accountable by Zhen Ling afterwards.

However, if Zhuang Zhong betrayed them and sided with Zhen Ling, it would be different. Not only would the grand formation be broken, but both Fuego and Frolasa would also perish. Regardless of whether Zhen Ling killed him or not, he would be unable to leave this place.

Jian Wushuang stood up directly, halting the grand formation.

Fuego also stepped forward. Now, everyone except Zhuang Zhong himself understood that life and death were in the hands of the other party.

Zhen Ling’s expression eased, no longer pressing for answers. Instead, a smile appeared on his face as he spoke, “Zhuang Zhong, the strongest of the Zhuang Clan, originally from the Three Kings Court, am I right?!”

“How do you know? Who are you exactly?” Zhuang Zhong was wary of Zhen Ling. Although his strength was inferior, the aura of the Qishen Temple could intimidate him.

Seeing this, Shen Ling quickly transmitted Zhen Ling’s identity and the current situation of the Qishen Temple through divine communication.

He feared that Zhuang Zhong would be frightened by Zhen Ling’s aura.

Zhuang Zhong’s expression changed after hearing this information, followed by wild laughter. All fear in his heart disappeared.
