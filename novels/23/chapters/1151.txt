Chapter 1152: Inside the Chillywind Valley (Part One)

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Red Snow King did not feel very surprised when he heard Jian Wushuang call him by his real name.

He knew that he would be exposed once he showed his powers.

“Jian Wushuang, I really admire your ability. You’re only a Dao Master, but you managed to escape from the Three Kings of the Jin Kingdom and even I must spend much energy to catch you. It’s amazing,” Red Snow King said smilingly.

“You are a genius, a real genius!

“Although we all live in the Eternal Chaotic World, there are few geniuses like you!

“Unfortunately, if an extraordinary genius dies, he’ll be a loser. Today, you must die!”

“You’re right. I admit that I’m doomed to die today, but… I’ll never die at the hands of an expert from the Jin Kingdom. I won’t give your country an extra advantage.” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“What?” Red Snow King said with surprise.

“Have you seen the huge sinkhole at your feet?” Jian Wushuang asked suddenly.

Red Snow King glanced at the deep and mysterious sinkhole, but he didn’t see anything.

“I discovered the sinkhole long ago, and I named it Chillywind Valley.” Jian Wushuang laughed. “It is huge and deep beyond my imagination, but I don’t know whether there is a big opportunity or a natural impasse in it!

“I’ve always been curious about what lies at the bottom of the hole, but I never had the courage to find out before.

“Now that I’m doomed to die, I’ve decided to go down there to see whether it’s an opportunity or an impasse at the bottom of Chillywind Valley…

“Do you want to make a bet with me?” Jian Wushuang asked.

He looked very relaxed.

Red Snow King became a little anxious.

“Haha. If you are not afraid to die, you should follow me. Otherwise, you have to let me go.” Jian Wushuang grinned broadly at Red Snow King.

“Boom!”

A strong aura suddenly burst out from the body of Jian Wushuang again. The small amount of spiritual power that was left in his body began to revive.

He flew directly to the bottom of the mysterious sinkhole like a falling stone.

As he left, he swallowed several of the remaining elixir pills that could make him regain spiritual power and a drop of Ancient God Power.

Obviously, he was at the point of no return.

Upon seeing that, Red Snow King frowned and began to think about it.

He looked at the bottomless and mysterious sinkhole, and then he felt a natural fear.

There must be something that could threaten him at the bottom of the sinkhole.

However, Jian Wushuang was already frantically falling to the bottom of the sinkhole. If he didn’t follow, he wouldn’t know whether Jian Wushuang was dead or alive.

“Do I go or not?”

After a moment’s thought, he decided to enter the sinkhole.

“He’s just a Dao Master, but he dares to go into that sinkhole. I have no reason to fear him. Besides, it was difficult for me to put him in this situation. If I don’t continue to hunt him down, he’ll probably survive due to some opportunity. If that happens, it’ll be a nightmare for the Jin Kingdom!”?Red Snow King thought to himself.

“I can’t disregard my previous efforts, so I must kill him now!”

His eyes gradually became scarlet, and then he spread his red and gold wings behind him. In an instant, he turned into a red and gold flowing light rushing to the bottom of the sinkhole.

Seeing Jian Wushuang and Red Snow King fly into the sinkhole, Heaven Illusion King, Golden Rock King, and Heaven Shadow King who were standing in the void above the sinkhole all frowned.

“What should we do? Should we follow them?” Heaven Shadow King asked.

“There aren’t any records about the Chillywind Valley in the Jin Kingdom, so we don’t know what lies at the bottom of the sinkhole. However, as they’ve already entered the sinkhole, we shouldn’t just stay here and wait,” said Golden Rock King.

“Considering Red Snow King’s battle strength, it should be a piece of cake for him to kill Jian Wushuang, but I’m afraid there might be something at the bottom of the hole that will help Jian Wushuang escape. Furthermore, if Red Snow King dies there, it’ll be a huge loss to the Jin Kingdom. Therefore, we’d better follow him and help,” said Heaven Illusion King.

“We should leave now. There are indeed a lot of natural dangerous lands on the battlefield, but few can threaten us. I think we won’t meet them, but we should be careful. If we notice that something is wrong, we will quickly escape.” Heaven Shadow King said.

“Okay.”

Golden Rock King and Heaven Illusion King nodded in agreement.

They immediately moved and flew to the bottom of the Chillywind Valley.

In Chillywind Valley.

“Whoosh!”

Jian Wushuang was using the Dragon Blood Secret Skill, and he unleashed his Strength of Soul to its maximum.

When he saw the four kings of the Jin Kingdom follow him and enter the valley one after another, he laughed coldly.

He had said that he knew nothing about the Chillywind Valley, which was a lie.

In fact, it was quite clear to him that there was something dreadful inside the Chillywind Valley.

Since he chose to burst into the valley, he was ready to give up this original body. However, he would try his best to make the Jin Kingdom pay the price before that. The greater the cost, the better.

“That’s great. Four kings of the Jin Kingdom…

“Red Snow King is the strongest among them. Five million years ago, the people of the Green Fire Palace spent much time and energy to defeat him. They thought they had killed him at that time, but he was still alive. And the Chillywind Valley…

“Before long, the Blood Coldwind inside this hole will start to blow. Let me see whether it is powerful enough to finish him off.”

Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

He had once witnessed the power of the Blood Coldwind personally and believed that it was a terrible weapon.

He wasn’t sure, however, whether he could kill Red Snow King with this weapon.

“As for the three other kings from the Jin Kingdom…”?Jian Wushuang laughed coldly.

“Their strengths and skills are far weaker than those of Red Snow King. If they’re attacked by the terrible Blood Coldwind, they’ll die.

“I have to make sure that they don’t have a chance to escape from this Blood Coldwind.”

Suddenly…

“Boom~~~”

A roar came from the bottom of the huge hole. Meanwhile, the whole world began to tremble fiercely, becoming stronger and stronger.
