2028 Source of Energy

Jian Wushuang, Abysmal Saint Master and Great Emperor Zhi Luo became quiet but there was a great commotion from the bottom of their hearts.

The Supreme Emperor Stone in the golden whirlpool in front of them was too huge.

It was a total of a hundred zhang tall. It simply equated to a huge mountain.

According to East Royal Emperor, a nail-sized Supreme Emperor Stone contained pure divine power of a Sir God, just how terrifyingly great was the pure divine power contained in the Supreme Emperor Stone that was a hundred zhang tall? Just how unbelievable was it?

“In ancient times, only the top sects and forces had the ability to use Supreme Emperor Stone in their great formation as a source of energy. Back then, the huge Supreme Emperor Stone in Imperial Peak that Three-Emperors World treated as Holy Crystal, in addition to the surrounding gold whirlpool, was obviously a method to run a great formation. Could it be…” Jian Wushuang suddenly thought of a possibility.

“Jian Wushuang, Emperor Bai and the others discussed and thought that if the great formation outside the dark millstone could engulf such a large area and still remain that powerful, it definitely requires an abundant source of energy. The Supreme Emperor Stone is most likely the crucial part to run the formation of the dark millstone,” Emperor Jiu Qiao said.

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes. He had already thought of the same thing.

Any great formation would definitely require the support of pure energy.

For example, the huge formation that was set up by his master in the ancient battlefield actually depended on the spacetime storm around it as its energy source.

It was naturally not easy to maintain the great formation around the dark millstone that was impressive.

However, the Supreme Emperor Stone absolutely had the power to maintain the revolving dark millstone.

“In other words, as long as we can destroy the huge Supreme Emperor Stone, the great formation around the dark millstone will collapse entirely?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“Theoretically, yes. Besides, there’s no need to destroy the Supreme Emperor Stone. As long as the connection between the Supreme Emperor Stone and the dark millstone is destroyed, which is the golden whirlpool around the Supreme Emperor Stone, the dark millstone is supposed to stop after the Supreme Emperor Stone failed to provide it pure energy,” Emperor Jiu Qiao said.

“If so, let’s hurry up and figure out a way to destroy the Supreme Emperor Stone and the golden whirlpool,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

But Jian Wushuang shook his head, “We have yet to confirm that the Supreme Emperor Stone is the main factor that drives the dark millstone. On top of that, even if it is real, it won’t be so easy to destroy it. We have to take our time and plan meticulously.”

“That’s true,” Abysmal Saint Master and the other two Great Emperor nodded faintly and they eventually calmed down.

Jian Wushuang, who stood before the golden whirlpool, maintained a casual manner. He looked around casually and he had spread his soul power long ago.

“The golden whirlpool could be said to be the most important place in Imperial Peak. The guards there are naturally strict. Not only were there deacon guards from Imperial Cabinet in sight, but there were also three experts of Great Emperor level hidden around to keep watch of this place. Once there is any movement, the three Great Emperors would take action immediately.”

“Besides, the Imperial Cabinet on the top of Imperial Peak isn’t far away from here. Once there is movement, there will be a large number of experts from Imperial Cabinet to those who were cultivating on Imperial Peak. In a short time, it could at least gather seven to eight Great Emperors,” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

Imperial Peak was the most important place in Three-Emperors World. The old lair of Imperial Cabinet was located there.

How easy would it be to destroy the Supreme Emperor Stone there?

“Don’t be in a hurry. Now that I am in Imperial Peak. I’ll stay in Imperial Peak for a while. I will ask around for more information and we will find a chance to take action,” Jian Wushuang said.

The other three Great Emperors nodded simultaneously too.

They also knew that there were some things that couldn’t be rushed through. They had to take one step at a time. They had to have a well-planned strategy before taking action.

Otherwise, not only would their trip be into vain, their lives would be at stake too.

Then, Jian Wushuang stayed in Imperial Peak.

From the outside, he looked like he was working hard to improve his power and using the cultivation resources. However, he was actually making friends with some other experts and asking salacious questions.

In the blink of an eye, half a year passed.

With his hard work from the past six months, they came to a conclusion. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The Emperor Supreme Rock was really the most important treasure in Three-Emperors World. It was also the source of energy in Three-Emperors World. Hence, it would naturally play a pivotal role in operating the dark millstone.

As long as they could destroy the Emperor Supreme Rock, the great formation outside the dark millstone would collapse directly.

“Target locked. Now, it’s time to figure out the hows,” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes, “In Imperial Peak, we will not have any external assistance, nor will we have any stratagem or means that we could use. Hence, the only thing that we have an option for is the time to take action.”

The other three Great Emperors nodded simultaneously.

The Emperor Supreme Rock was within the golden whirlpool. There was no doubt that they could only barge into the golden whirlpool and take thunderous measures if they wanted to destroy it.

They only had only one method to hand. Similarly, they definitely would have to deal with the hindrance by the top experts within Three-Emperors World.

They could only seek to have absolutely perfect timing.

“I just received news that Imperial Peak will throw a Doctrine Propagation Ceremony in twenty years. Besides the three Great Emperors guarding the golden whirlpool, the other Great Emperor experts in Imperial Cabinet will attend the ceremony personally while all cultivators in Imperial Peak will gather in Doctrine Propagation Palace. The palace was quite a distance away from the golden whirlpool. Even if a Great Emperor rushed in at full speed personally, I reckon it will take at least a dozen breaths of time to rush back. If we were to opt to take action on Doctrine Propagation Ceremony day, the success rate would be much higher,” Jian Wushuang said.

Imperial Cabinet was not too far away from the golden whirlpool. They could hurry over in five breaths of time with the traveling speed of a Great?Emperor. Compared to the dozen breaths time from Doctrine Propagation Palace, there would be an extra seven to eight breaths of time.

Don’t belittle the seven to eight breaths of time, the success rate will go up tremendously with the extra breaths given to Jian Wushuang and the three Great Emperors.

“If so, let’s do it on that day. It’s only twenty years away. Although Eternal Chaotic World is now in danger, we can afford to wait another twenty years,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

“Mm, we agree too,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo and Emperor Jiu Qiao nodded in agreement too.

Before long, the four of them came to a mutual agreement to take action at the Doctrine Propagation Ceremony happening twenty years later.
