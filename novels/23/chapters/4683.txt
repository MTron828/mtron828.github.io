4684 A Pot of Wine in the Mortal World

Old Master!

Jian Wushuang suddenly woke up, sweat pouring out of his sideburns.

The burning pain in his meridians disappeared and was replaced by a cold void.

He clenched his fist, which meant that the Ancestor realm Great Dao had long dissipated and that his fate energy had returned to the universe.

From now on, he would no longer have any connection with the entire Divine Power Universe.

“Is it worth it to search for that illusory ultimate realm? ” he asked himself, but no one could give him an answer, and there was no turning back.

After changing into a green robe, Jian Wushuang walked out of the inner hall slowly and arrived at the main hall of the Cloud Palace.

At that moment, Ninth Kalpa King, Elder Xue Bo, and the others in the Cloud Palace had gathered there and had not left. When they saw Jian Wushuang appear, they were all stunned and then they all ran over.

“Cosmos God, you’re alright. It’s good that you’re alright!” Xue Bo’s eyes were bloodshot as he looked at Jian Wushuang with great reluctance.

Ninth Kalpa King was still a man of few words, but the concern in his eyes betrayed his expressionless face.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. “It’s fine. I won’t die for the time being. However, from today onwards, I will no longer hold the position of Cosmos God. The position of Cosmos God will be passed down to each and every one of you here.”

“No, I don’t agree!” Xue Bo immediately opposed. “Palace Master Wushuang, you are the only one who can become Cosmos God. This is definitely not our choice. It is the choice of the Heavenly Dao!”

“We don’t agree either, Lord Cosmos God.” Long Yan and Long Chi nodded at the same time.

Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “I have returned all the fate energy to heaven and earth. From today on, heaven will make a choice between each of you.”

With that, he returned the 10 percent of the Ancestor realm aura that the Dragon Emperor Llinhe had left behind to Long Yan and the Long Chi. At the same time, he also gave the Heavenly Path’s fate energy that was attached to him to all the Half Ancestors.

At that moment, a voice was heard in the quiet Cloud Palace. Then, a figure that looked exactly like Jian Wushuang appeared.

Their eyes met and Jian Wushuang waved his hand at the True Shadow.

Then, the clay idol turned into a stream of light and flew into his palm.

The flowing light was the size of a broad bean, and it was beating rhythmically like a heart.

“What is this?” Elder Xue Bo asked in confusion.

Jian Wushuang murmured, “This is my past.”

Then, he said, “Everyone, I’m going to leave for a few days to make a trip to the lower realm. To settle some trifling matters.”

Jian Wushuang nodded in agreement.

After walking out of the palace, he turned back to look at the towering palace for the last time, then walked into the heavens slowly.

“Have you already decided?” Ninth Kalpa King looked forward into the layers of the universe.

Jian Wushuang nodded. “After I send my past to the lower realms, I’ll prepare to leave.”

“No matter when you come back, you have to remember that we’re all waiting for you,” Ninth Kalpa King said as he turned his head and looked at him.

Jian Wushuang smiled and patted his shoulder. “I know.”

The Divine Power Universe was vast and boundless, including tens of thousands of worlds. However, the one with the largest base was the mortal world, which had thin spiritual energy.

Sitting in the clouds, Jian Wushuang looked at the flowing light in his palm and the past came to his mind.

Once he reincarnated, his millions of years of memories and obsessions would also disappear.

However, Jian Wushuang still threw it down resolutely.

“You didn’t want to keep him in the Cloud Palace, just to throw him into the mortal world?” Ninth Kalpa King was puzzled. “Do you know how many hundreds of years his lifespan will be at most? You won’t even have the slightest bit of Dao affinity?”

He said slowly, “It might not be a bad thing to be able to enter reincarnation.”

Ninth Kalpa King shook his head helplessly and said, “Let’s go. I’ll go with you to the lower realm to see where he will go.”

At the Bai Manor in Changping County.

With the sound of a baby’s cry, the storm that had been pouring for ten days finally stopped, and the world became clear.

The Bai Manor was decorated with lanterns and streamers, and red lanterns stretched for dozens of miles. Every servant was full of joy. After carefully accepting the reward money given by the housekeeper, they greeted each other.

The wife who had been pregnant for 11 months finally gave birth to a son. At the same time, the flood that had spread through the entire county city was also dispersed, causing everyone to be surprised.

The news that anyone who went to the Bai Manor to say a few words could receive 10 wens of wedding money spread, and for a time, the people surrounded the Bai Manor’s gate.

At the same time, two figures dressed in plain clothes strolled along the long corridors and pavilions of the Bai Manor, but the servants who were hurrying past ignored them.

“This kid who entered the reincarnation cycle, is that kid you? Or should I say, your past?” one of the handsome young men asked.

The other young man, who was a little thin but had a majestic look in his eyes, replied, “It’s me, but it’s not me. Ever since he left my body, he became an independent little fellow.”

Ninth Kalpa King smiled quietly. “Since you said that he’s an individual existence different from you, then how about I give him Immortal roots and let him acknowledge me as his Master? This way, even if you leave, the heavenly Cloud Palace will have a successor.”

“No, Ninth Kalpa.” Jian Wushuang felt helpless. “In this way, too many hidden dangers may be exposed. Even I don’t know what the consequences will be if I separate him from my body. I might as well let him enter reincarnation safely.”

“Alright, alright, I’ll do as you say.” Ninth Kalpa King teased, “Who asked you to be Cosmos God?”

“After today, I’m no longer Cosmos God. I think Dao Yan should be able to take on the position of Cosmos God.”

“You’ve already decided?”

Jian Wushuang nodded and looked at him at the same time, “As for you, you will be my last trump card in this universe.”

Ninth Kalpa King nodded slightly. “I understand.”

As the two conversed, they had already walked through the corridor to a wing room.

They entered through the door. At this moment, there was only a couple in the huge room.

“Madam, you’ve had a hard time,” in front of the half-closed bed, a middle-aged man held the woman’s hand tightly and said gently.

The woman smiled and pursed her lips. “It’s unfortunate.”

In a cradle wrapped in brocade, a baby with red lips and white teeth was staring at two figures with a pair of round eyes.

Ninth Kalpa King made a funny face and then pointed his finger at the little guy’s forehead.

Threads of warm divine power entered his brain.

“Since you don’t want me to give this kid the Immortal root, then I’ll let him live to 500 years old, have descendants, and be free from disease and disaster…”

The little guy chuckled, and the first baby tooth began to grow out of his pink gums.

Jian Wushuang also smiled, and crystal tears fell from his eyes silently.

“Let’s go, Ninth Kalpa.”

“Alright,” he said.
