2035 It“d Be Impossible to Escape!

Among the Great Emperors in Eternal Chaotic World, excluding supreme Emperor Bai, there was a distance between the Great Emperors, although it wasn’t too great.

For example, the strongest Red Dragon King and Abysmal Saint Master, they were only stronger than the ordinary Great Emperors by a slight bit. However, when they fought one-on-one, it would be impossible for the two of them to kill the weakest Great Emperor.

However, the Great Emperors in Three-Emperors World were obviously stronger than the Great Emperors in Eternal Chaotic World.

They were above the standard of a top Great Emperor. For example, the beast-like bald man, Ling Zong, was much stronger than Red Dragon King and Abysmal Saint Master.

Then, the tall and sturdy man who was charging at Great Emperor Zhi Luo was also not any weaker in fighting power than Ling Zong.

“Outsider, die!” The tall and sturdy middle-aged man glanced at Great Emperor Zhi Luo. His eyes were filled with murderous intent.

Vroom!

A terrifying aura engulfed Great Emperor Zhi Luo.

As the tall and sturdy middle-aged man plunged over, Great Emperor Zhi Luo felt a sense of crisis.

Without hesitation, her figure turned illusionary. She had no intention of fighting the tall and sturdy middle-aged man head-on. Then, she appeared in the void where the spacetime gap was. As she slapped, the originally-small spacetime gap instantly expanded and transformed into a spacetime tunnel.

The spacetime tunnel was enough for one person to fly through.

However, Great Emperor Zhi Luo had merely expanded the spacetime tunnel and she had yet to leap into it. The tall and sturdy middle-aged man appeared from nowhere again. Then, his palm began magnifying continuously like a huge star that was charging at Great Emperor Zhi Luo.

Emperor Zhi Luo was shocked and she quickly raised her hand to block. In the end, she fell in the direction of the huge palm.

“Humph. Do you want to escape via this spacetime tunnel?” The tall and sturdy middle-aged man smirked coldly. Then, he waved and a billowing spacetime power swept out.

The spacetime tunnel, which was big enough for a person to fly through, began to resume.

“Sh*t!” Great Emperor Zhi Luo’s face changed.

She had been through hardship and she had even used the one-time use ancient treasure that she had obtained from the ancient battlefield to make a spacetime tunnel.

It was also the only route of return for the four-members experts’ troops.

However, the tall and sturdy middle-aged man was obviously not any weaker in the manipulation of spacetime power compared to her.

“Go away!”

Great Emperor Zhi Luo’s aura soared and her divine power increased tremendously. She held a spear in each of her hands. As she wielded them, she brought about terrifying power and stabbed.

The spears were aiming at the void in front of her. However, they came before the tall and sturdy man via spacetime power. The man had no choice but to retreat.

Great Emperor Zhi Luo’s figure became illusionary. She didn’t retreat and instead advanced to fight the tall and sturdy man head-on instead.

At the same time, she let out a shrill scream, “Abysmal Saint Master, Emperor Jiu Qiao, hurry up and leave. Leave now!!!”

Her roar reverberated in the universe. Great Emperor Zhi Luo tried her best to keep the tall and sturdy man occupied.

Then, Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao happened to rush to the scene. They noticed the spacetime tunnel that was returning to its original size.

The spacetime tunnel had already shrunk in size tremendously and it only needed a short while until it disappeared entirely.

“Zhi Luo!!!”

Abysmal Saint Master clenched his hands.

Emperor Jiu Qiao by his side also looked pale with rage. They knew clearly that Great Emperor Zhi Luo was trying her best to keep the tall and sturdy middle-aged man occupied while Jian Wushuang was fighting ferociously against the twelve Great Emperors. He wouldn’t be able to rush there before the spacetime tunnel disappeared entirely.

Then, there was only Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao who would manage to escape in time.

“Go!!!”

Abysmal Saint Master roared and he immediately grabbed Emperor Jiu Qiao to throw him into the spacetime tunnel. Then, Abysmal Saint Master leaped into the spacetime tunnel too. Just as the spacetime tunnel was going to resume its original size, they got in.

In the blink of an eye, Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao’s figure left and the spacetime tunnel disappeared completely.

“D*mn it. Two of them escaped.”

The tall and sturdy middle-aged man, who was being kept occupied by Great Emperor Zhi Luo, grew angry and his power increased tremendously.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

There were three continuous bangs, then Great Emperor Zhi Luo humphed and fell backward. The direction in which she retreated was the direction where Jian Wushuang was.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang met with Great Emperor Zhi Luo and both of them stood side by side.

The figures surrounding them stopped and towered over them. They looked at Jian Wushuang and Great Emperor Zhi Luo with shimmering gazes.

The aura that they carried was terrifying.

There was a total of twelve Great Emperors that had besieged Jian Wushuang earlier, including Ling Zong. Now, there was the tall and sturdy middle-aged man who was compatible with Ling Zong. Hence, there was a total of thirteen Great Emperors!

Among the thirteen Great Emperors, they hemmed Jian Wushuang and Great Emperor Zhi Luo in right in the middle.

“Sword Emperor, I’m afraid the two of us can’t escape,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo looked pale as she glanced at Jian Wushuang. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly. He also knew his situation.

There was a great formation surrounding Imperial Peak. Great Emperor Zhi Luo had been through a lot of trouble to open up a spacetime tunnel. However, the spacetime tunnel had already disappeared. She wouldn’t be able to open it again. In other words, for the two of them it would be impossible to escape!

“Luckily, Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao have escaped. Our four-member expert troop hasn’t been wiped out entirely,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo laughed, but her laughter was extremely pathetic.

Jian Wushuang took another deep breath.

At such a crucial moment, Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao had to run.

Because those who had stayed back were destined to die. There was almost no possibility of struggle. The four members of experts troops naturally should try their best to escape! Then, they could save some fighting power for Sanctuary Alliance, for Eternal Chaotic World.

As Jian Wushuang and Great Emperor Zhi Luo talked, the beast-like Ling Zong and the tall and sturdy middle-aged man gathered among the thirteen Great Emperors.

“What happened? How could you let Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao escape?” Ling Zong creased his eyebrows and demanded to know.

“How dare you say that about me? I have to deal with three in Peak Chaotic Realm. Why don’t you give it a try and see if you can make all of them stay? On the other hand, there are a total of twelve Peak Chaotic Realm who couldn’t kill one person from early stage Chaotic Realm when they fought an all-out battle,” the tall and sturdy middle-aged man teased.

Ling Zong paused but didn’t continue to call him to account.

“Although two escaped, Sword Emperor stayed. Among the four of them, he was the most important target. As long as we can kill him, we can consider ourselves to have successfully accomplished the task,” Ling Zong said.

The surrounding people nodded heavily.
