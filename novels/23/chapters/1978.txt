“Wasted its resources?” The experts looked at Jian Wushuang.

“That’s right. The cultivation environment in Green Fire World now is far beyond Eternal Chaotic World. However, the easiest thing to create in such a cultivation environment isn’t peak expert but... genius!” Jian Wushuang lowered his voice, “the more outstanding a place is, the higher the probability of giving birth to a genius. Just like the ancient times...”

“During ancient times, the geniuses were as many as the clouds. It was far beyond our era. If we really want to compare, our batch of geniuses would at most be second-grade if put in ancient times. We couldn’t even be considered as first-grade geniuses. I believe everyone should know this clearly.

Hearing what Jian Wushuang said, the experts at the scene became quiet.

The ancient times, the most prosperous first era and the era that they were in, there were vast differences.

Not only in terms of experts, but also in talent.

There were countless geniuses in ancient times. Any one of them in the current era would be known as a miracle.

“Sword Emperor, what are you trying to say?” Ancestor Tian Chen creased his eyebrows and asked.

“Very simple. If Green Fire World were to be made as a cultivation sanctuary better than Thunderbolt, it would only benefit the higher experts in Eternal Chaotic World. Although it would help to increase the fighting power of the top experts tremendously, it wouldn’t make any changes to the roots. If Green Fire World’s value were to be put on the younger geniuses, it would be entirely different,” Jian Wushuang’s voice was loud and clear.

“I suggested the condition to not let any experts above Real God level enter because I wanted to turn Green Fire World into the number one genius sanctuary in Eternal Chaotic World, a genius’ cradle.

“I’d give out a huge territory in Green Fire World. Sanctuary Alliance, special tribes and all forces in Eternal Chaotic World could send a batch of disciples to the territory. Then, as long as they never break through and become Real Gods, they can reside there. They can even reproduce there.”

“Although there wouldn’t be much of a visible effect in the short term, through generations of reproduction and inheritance, the later disciples would be more and more talented, more and more outstanding. There might even be people who possess a unique constitution in the future generation.

“Unique constitution?” There were many who were surprised.

“That’s right. As long as the cultivation condition is outstanding, some babies that have just been born will possess unique constitution, just like my father. He has the body of a sword spirit, which is rare. One of my brothers is a Celestial Elixir. This happened before Green Fire World transformed entirely. As the cultivation environment becomes more outstanding, the unique constitution born in Green Fire World is growing in number. Now, from what I know, among the cultivators in Green Fire World, there are more than thirty of them who have unique constitutions. There are many that have yet to be discovered,” Jian Wushuang said.

“This, this...” Many experts were dumbfounded.

Unique constitution was what countless cultivators dreamed of in Eternal Chaotic World.

Having a unique constitution was equal to having the requirement to be a peak expert. Then, one was only required to work hard and obtain opportunities.

For instance, the body of a sword spirit was born an expert in Sword Principle.

If a Celestial Elixir reincarnated, he would only need sufficient resources to nurture. He was destined to become the top elixir maker. He could even become an elixir almighty.

These were all unique constitutions that people were envious of.

However, such constitutions were too rare in Eternal Chaotic World. Among the geniuses and experts in the ten cultivation sanctuaries, the number of cultivators with unique constitutions could be counted on one’s fingers.

But then, in Green Fire World itself, there were more than thirty of them who possessed unique constitutions in Green Fire World?

Just how unbelievable it was.

The experts’ eyes became green with envy.

It was just as how Jian Wushuang had described, Green Fire World could totally become a genius’ cradle. If it was put to use appropriately, it could totally generate large number of top geniuses continuously. It could even be comparable to the first era, or even the ancient times.

If these geniuses grew stronger, even if among dozens of them or even hundreds of them, there was only one who really grew strong for real, Green Fire World could still continuously produce more experts in Eternal Chaotic World. It was of a much greater use in making a cultivation sanctuary.

“Sword Emperor, even if what you said is true, you do not allow any Almighties or even a Real God to enter Green Fire World. Only cultivators below Universe God level are allowed to enter. When they enter Green Fire World, wouldn’t they be under your control? By then, you can still do whatever you wish. From what I know, Green Fire World already has many Real Gods. If the cultivators from Sanctuary Alliance didn’t even have any Real Gods in Green Fire World, wouldn’t the cultivators from Green Fire World bully our men as they wish?!” Yan Zun suddenly said.

“No one needs to worry about this. I can guarantee that no cultivators from Green Fire World will step foot in the territory that your cultivators are having, nor will they get involved in any affair in your territory. Plus, if you are really worried, I can take another step back. I will allow you to pick ten Almighties to form an Alliance of Ten to attend garrison duty all year round. However, these ten Almighties could only be Sir Gods or Emperor Gods,” Jian Wushuang said. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The surrounding people were in deep thought.

Only ten Almighties and only Sir Gods and Emperor Gods. They naturally couldn’t restrict Jian Wushuang at all. However, it wouldn’t be a problem to restrict the cultivators from Green Fire World.

With the ten Almighties, it shouldn’t be a problem to protect those who were below Universe God level.

As for Jian Wushuang, he naturally had Sanctuary Alliance and experts from various forces to guard against him. He shouldn’t act recklessly too.

“Everyone, this is my first condition. I wonder if all of you agree with it?” Jian Wushuang looked around.

The Great Emperors immediately started their discussion.

After a short discussion, Ancestor Tian Chen spoke again, “Sword Emperor, you do know that Eternal Chaotic World is huge? Sanctuary Alliance alone has great power, let alone the special tribes. Hence, the territory required definitely isn’t small.”

“To allocate how huge a territory for Sanctuary Alliance, special tribes and also various forces, we can talk about this later. I only want to know if everyone is willing to agree with my first condition to only send cultivators below Real God level and have ten Sir Gods or Emperor Gods form an Alliance of Ten to step foot in Green Fire World.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes, we can agree on this condition,” Ancestor Tian Chen nodded.
