Chapter 1407: The Battle Between The Strongest Two

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“The battle between the strongest two is finally coming!”

Many disciples around the vast galaxy were excited.

Even the elderly deacons were looking forward to it.

“Guess who will win the next battle?” A woman in a green robe said.

“Definitely Ling Feibai. But it’s uncertain how many difficulties Jian Wushuang can bring to him.” A strong man said.

“Indeed, Ling Feibai is much stronger than other disciples, including the disciples of the Star Palace. Although Jian Wushuang had an excellent performance, he still cannot rival Ling Feibai. But he will pose great challenges for Ling Feibai.”

“Exactly.”

The elderly deacons chatted and laughed casually.

In the crowd, the Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao looked at each other face to face, and both of them could read each other’s minds.

In addition to the supreme palace master, only they knew the secret of Jian Wushuang.

He was just a Universe God in the First Heaven.

It was already remarkable for a Universe God in the First Heaven to have had such a great performance.

It would be surprising if Jian Wushuang could win the second round of the battle.

What’s more, it would be a miracle for a Universe God in the First Heaven to win the battle and keep the position of the disciples in the Star Palace.

But now, Jian Wushuang had not only made a miracle, he was also competing with Ling Feibai, the most excellent Universe God in the second heaven. This was far beyond their expectations.

No one could stay calm if they heard that a Universe God in the First Heaven could rival the top Universe God in the Second Heaven in the Star Palace.

“We still don’t know how much he can surprise us.” The Hall Master Yuan said excitedly, watching Jian Wushuang’s battle.

Jian Wushuang was now standing face to face with Ling Feibai on the Star Land.

“I thought it would be Xia Feng or Mo Ze who would come to the final round to battle with me, but I never expected you.” Ling Feibai looked at Jian Wushuang with a gentle smile.

“But I expected it.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Ling Feibai showed his contempt, “I know you are good at consciousness attacks and Phantasmagoria, but that means nothing to me.”

“Come on, show me all your power.” Ling Feibai said.

He stood there confidently.

“Don’t worry, you won’t be disappointed.” Jian Wushuang said.

Jian Wushuang started to generate power. As he blinked his eyes a little, a scarlet halo burst out.

Eighteen Asura Hell again!

“That’s another Eighteen Asura Hell!”

“It is the Phantasmagoria from Jian Wushuang!”

“He was using such powerful skills so early!”

Many disciples watching the battle could not help but tighten their hands.

Jian Wushuang had used this Phantasmagoria several times in the battle and no one could resist it.

Even the genius Xia Feng and Mo Ze couldn’t resist this Phantasmagoria from Jian Wushuang.

With this tactic, Jian Wushuang defeated the other eight disciples.

Now, facing Ling Feibai, the strongest Universe God in the Second Heaven, Jian Wushuang decided to use his skills right at the beginning.

The Eighteen Asura Hell started to come into play, and meanwhile, Jian Wushuang started to wave his sword.

His swordsmanship was as quick and violent as a blazing flint.

He had created it during the 90-year cultivation in the Long Gang Mystery Land.

This swordsmanship was called the Fire Light!

Buzz!

Ling Feibai at first felt surprised about the attack, but soon he calmed down.

“It’s a good skill, but it still won’t affect me.” Ling Fengbai laughed.

Jian Wushuang was shocked. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Even geniuses like Xia Feng and Mo Ze struggled to resist my Phantasmagoria, but Ling Feibai isn’t affected at all?”

At that moment, Jian Wushuang saw that Ling Feibai wave a purple soft sword.

“You are good at swordsmanship, so am I.” Ling Feibai said.

The purple sword begin to generate power. It collided with Jian Wushuang sword, causing tremendous sparks.

Bang!

Jian Wushuang suffered a great backlash while Ling Feibai remained unaffected.

Then Jian Wushuang started to generate his Black Tortoise to block the attack of the purple sword light, but the Black Tortoise’s power dissipated quickly under the attack and Jian Wushuang was forced to retreat instantly.

“Your defense is not bad.”

“But I haven’t show my true power.”

Then Ling Feibai’s eyes turned bright and purple. He generated another sword light again, of the same size as the previous one, but it was much more powerful and much faster.

Jian Wushuang generated his soul power to form three Demonic Dragons that rushed to Ling Feibai.

The purple sword light pierced three Demonic Dragons in an instant, and then bombarded the Black Tortoise again.

Bang!

This time, the giant Black Tortoises totally collapsed. Jian Wushuang himself was also attacked.

“The attack is so strong!”

Jian Wushuang was shocked by Ling Feibai’s great power.

“Why can a Universe God in the Second Heaven break both my black tortoise and the demonic dragon?!”

“His swordsmanship is extremely excellent. Besides, his divine power is extremely powerful. It is absolutely comparable to an ordinary Universe God in the Third Heaven.”

King of Venomous Worms said to Jian Wushuang, “As far as I know, he may have combined three Strongest Sword Principles just as you did. He is as powerful as a Universe God in the Third Heaven.”
