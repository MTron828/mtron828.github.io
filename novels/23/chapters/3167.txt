Chapter 3168: Personal Verification

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

“Space-time Temple Master has accepted me as his disciple?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes darted around.

Space-time Temple Master was a super expert who stood at the top of the pyramid in the Divine Beginning Realm. Even the will of the Heavenly Dao had to retreat in front of him. Even the three masters of the Saint Realm in the three Saint Realms, who stood high above, did not dare to be presumptuous in front of Space-time Temple Master, as for ordinary Principles Masters, they had to kneel in front of Space-time Temple Master.

Such a supreme existence was already at the invincible level.

In the Divine Beginning Realm, the only people who could compete with him were the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and the founder of the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect.

How could such a supreme existence accept him as a disciple?

If it were an ordinary person, they would be overjoyed.

However, Jian Wushuang appeared indifferent. Moreover, the Temporal Temple Master had long given up the idea of using the space-time stone to accept disciples.

“Little guy, although the Temple Master might not accept you as a disciple, you have already proved your talent in space-time by comprehending the space-time divine skill in the time-space stone comprehension stage. As long as you cultivate hard in the future, your achievements will not be too bad under the cultivation of the resources of our Temporal Temple,” Ba Cang said.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“By the way, there’s one more thing that I need to verify,” Temple Master Bai Xing suddenly said.

“Verify what?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

“I saw your fight before. Your swordsmanship combined perfectly with the space-time principles. It seems to be quite exquisite. I want to see it with my own eyes,” Temple Master Bai Xing said with a smile.

Hearing Temple Master Bai Xing’s words, Ba Cang, who was beside him, had a strange look on his face.

Of course, he knew why Temple Master Bai Xing did this.

“Sure.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Temple Master Bai Xing immediately waved his hand. With this simple gesture, a separate space-time appeared around him.

Although this space-time was not big, it was enough for Jian Wushuang to display it to his heart’s content.

“With one hand, a single space-time was formed. Temple Master Bai Xing is so powerful.” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

However, he could understand that the Temporal Temple was one of the three Freedom Alliances in the Divine Beginning World. Since Temple Master Bai Xing was able to become the Deputy Temple Master of the Temporal Temple, she was in charge of most of the matters in the Temporal Temple, her strength must be extraordinary.

Jian Wushuang estimated that Temple Master Bai Xing’s strength was at least as strong as the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

Jian Wushuang, Temple Master Bai Xing, and Ba Cang had already stepped into this separate spacetime.

“Little guy, show your swordsmanship to your heart’s content. Don’t be afraid.” Temple Master Bai Xing stood there and looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded. With a flip of his hand, the Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand.

Looking at Temple Master Bai Xing in front of him, a trace of excitement flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

It was a great blessing for Jian Wushuang to be able to fight with an expert of Temple Master Bai Xing’s level.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang moved directly.

His body swayed, and he immediately performed the silver light movement technique.

He easily appeared in front of Temple Master Bai Xing like a ghost and immediately slashed out the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

A shocking violent aura suddenly swept out.

It was the Peerless Sword Manual, Xi Xiang!

Temple Master Bai Xing raised his hand and casually slashed out again. Immediately, a small green light swept out. With a clang, Jian Wushuang was directly sent flying.

Jian Wushuang was not discouraged. His body swayed, and the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand immediately became hazy.

It was the first move of the Peerless Sword Manual, Star Dream!

Buzz!

The sword light passed through Temple Master Bai Xing’s divine body, but it did not touch the real body.

“It’s too fast.” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He did not see how Temple Master Bai Xing moved, but it was obvious that Temple Master Bai Xing was no longer in the void in front of him.

“Continue!”

An indifferent voice came from behind Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang turned his head and looked at Temple Master Bai Xing again, and then…boom!

An earth-shaking power swept out. It was the Peerless Sword Manual, the first move of setting sun!

As soon as the setting sun appeared, a terrifying space-time annihilation power suddenly swept out.

“Oh, space-time annihilation?” Temple Master Bai Xing raised his eyebrows, and his expression finally changed. Then, he counted with his index finger, and the space-time annihilation formed in front of him instantly collapsed, the space-time annihilation had returned to its original calm.

“Combining sword skill with space-time annihilation, this move is not bad.” Temple Master Bai Xing smiled.

Since Jian Wushuang had displayed his sword skill, he had already displayed three sword skills.

Although Xi Xiang and Star Dream were not bad, they were not worthy of Temple Master Bai Xing’s attention.

However, the setting sun move perfectly combined sword skill with space-time annihilation, which made Temple Master Bai Xing’s eyes light up.

“If you have any other swordsmanship, feel free to use it.” Temple Master Bai Xing smiled.

Jian Wushuang did not disappoint Temple Master Bai Xing. Soon, he used his sword again…

Life and death moment!

Ninth firmament illusionary sword realm!

Emperor Blood Kill!

Three sword moves were used one by one.

Temple Master Bai Xing did not care about the two sword moves, life and death moment and ninth firmament illusionary sword realm. It was not until Emperor Blood Kill was used that Temple Master Bai Xing showed a strange expression again. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Previously, it was a combination of sword technique and space-time annihilation, but this sword technique is actually a perfect combination of space-time suppression?

“While displaying the sword technique, it also exerted the space-time suppression to the extreme. Haha, what an interesting sword technique. I’m surprised that you can think of this.” Temple Master Bai Xing smiled.

Obviously, Temple Master Bai Xing was very appreciative of the Emperor’s Blood Kill that Jian Wushuang had created.

He was even more impressed with it than he was with the ‘setting sun’ move.

“Little guy, I saw you fight with the rank seven True Saint from the Purple Cloud Pavilion. Your swordsmanship should be more than this. You should have a more powerful move. Show me that move too.” Temple Master Bai Xing’s eyes were full of expectation.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath, and his expression became unusually solemn.

He stared at Temple Master Bai Xing in front of him, and in the next moment, he drew his sword.

He slowly raised the sword in his hand. It seemed to be a very simple action, but it instantly stirred up the surrounding space and time, and the surrounding void became completely blood-red.

The blood-red sky, the blood-red earth, and even the air were filled with a large amount of blood fog.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang was no longer a human cultivator, but an Asura in hell!

This was a blood-red Asura!

“This is the sword.”

The moment they saw Jian Wushuang raise his sword, Temple Master Bai Xing and Ba Cang, who were also in this space-time, had their eyes suddenly lit up.

They had all seen the scene of Jian Wushuang fighting with Bai Yuan. In that scene, Jian Wushuang had displayed many sword skills, but what really shocked them was the sword that Jian Wushuang had displayed.

This sword technique was called Blood Asura!
