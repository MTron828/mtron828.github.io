Chapter 165: The Soaring Sword Essence

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

It has completely calmed down in the Cloud mountain range.

Everything was silent.

Suddenly, an incredible sword essence rose like a giant dragon that has been sleeping for millions of years.

The sky discolored and the earth instantly began to shake.

Throughout the Cloud mountain range, Gold Core Realm warriors who had a core and those would do not, were both alarmed at this moment.

“This sword essence...”

“What a terrifying Sword Essence. This simple sword essence frightens me to the core. It’s so strong!”

“Right now, among the people still alive in the Cloud mountain range, there is only one person can release such a powerful sword essence, Jian Wushuang!”

The warriors were frightened, but at the same time, they also understood what Jian Wushuang wanted to say.

“With a sword in hand, no one is my match!”

Indeed, he had the strongest understanding of Sword Principle in history!

“Haha, it begins.”

Those experts who had gathered together in the air were now in an uproar.

“The battle between Jian Wushuang and Xue Yun will be exciting!”

“Before, Jian Wushuang had absolutely no chance to win against Xue Yun. But now it’s a different?story.”

“The combination of three sword essences qualifies him to fight against Xue Yun. Not only that, the outcome is unpredictable.”

These experts were discussing it.

Before the selection battle, Jian Wushuang had met with Xue Yun once. But they were just greeting each other and Xue Yun did not use his full strength. At that time, people knew the two would have a fight, but no one had faith in Jian Wushuang.

After all, Xue Yun was too strong.

However, on the first day of the selection battle, Jian Wushuang’s strength greatly improved when he combined three sword essences together. Moreover, he killed Ouyang Haotian who was at the Half Step Yin-Yang Realm with one sword move, which made everyone realize that his strength was strong enough to fight against Xue Yun.

Today was the last day of the selection battle.

This day only belonged to Jian Wushuang and Xue Yun.

A battle between peak geniuses, that rarely appeared each decade in the Tianzong Dynasty, was about to start.

After the incredible sword essence soared toward the sky, creating a loud booming sound, a terrifying aura rose from the peak of another mountain.

This aura was cold and dark!

It seemed that this aura could swallow everything in the universe.

The instant that the aura rose, the world turned dark. The master of this aura naturally became the king in this world of darkness.

A sword essence that could control the world.

An aura that could swallow everything.

They rose and confronted each other from a great distance…

The whole world became silent, and all the warriors in the Cloud mountain range were holding their breath. Staring at the soaring sword essence and the terrifying dark aura, no one dared to say anything.

No one dared to move at all, for they were afraid that the slightest movement would make them a target for the soaring sword essence and the dark aura.

When the sword essence and aura finally reached their peaks.

Dung! Dung!

Deep footsteps were heard. Although the sound was very low, within the silent Cloud mountain range it was like a huge drumstick beating on the hearts of everyone, making every warrior’s throat go dry.

“The Summit Battle!” Standing at the peak of one of the mountains, Yang Zaixuan watched everything with great intensity. Although he was supercilious, when he saw the soaring sword essence and dark aura, he did not dare to get involved with them.

“This is the battle between the greatest geniuses in our Tianzong dynasty.”?Baili Chen also sighed.?“Unfortunately, the one fighting against Xue Yun isn’t me.”

The moment that Jian Wushuang’s soaring sword essence was released, he knew that Jian Wushuang was stronger than him.

“Third brother.”?Standing on a high place, Su Rou frowned slightly. There was a little expectation but even more worry in her eyes.

Outside the Cloud mountain range, near to the edge of the mountains, a large number of warriors was gathered.

The last few days, these warriors had been standing here watching the Cloud mountain range. Although there were few things they could see, they were still very excited, and their enthusiasm was not reduced at all.

When the soaring sword essence and the dark aura suddenly appeared, the crowd became excited.

“That’s Jian Wushuang and Xue Yun!”

“Haha, the last day, on the last day, these two monsters are finally going to fight.”

“The Summit Battle, this is the battle between two peak geniuses of the Tianzong dynasty. This battle is bound to be written into the Millennium Chronicle of the Gladiator Arena.”

“I have been waiting so many days for this unprecedented battle!”

Numerous warriors were shouting in excitement and shock.

This was a battle that would shock the world.

Even if the battle had not yet begun, the soaring sword essence and the dark aura that could swallow everything were enough to make them crazy and excited.

“It remains unknown who will have the last laugh.” Ling Feng, looking a little pale, was also standing at the edge and staring forward.

He was also one of the Gold Core Realm warriors who participated in this selection battle. However, he only spent one day in the Cloud mountain range before giving up without any hesitation. He understood the horror of this selection battle very well.

Now, the two strongest candidates were going to fight.

“Senior brother.” Next to Ling Feng, Jian Meng’er clenched her teeth, her heart filled with unwillingness.

One of the participants that drew everyone’s attention at this moment, was the person that she had once looked down upon from the bottom of her heart.

She even thought he was trash and would never have any good prospects in his lifetime.

But now?

This man had already gone somewhere far beyond her reach.

Even if it was Lin Feng, who she adored, he was far from being able to compare with that person, let alone her.

“If, if I had left him some leeway at that time...”?Jian Meng’er thought of this, but she did not dare to think further.

She knew that Jian Wushuang had a trace of affection for her when they were young.

If she was not so self-conceited at that time, or she left a little leeway for Jian Wushuang, perhaps they would be together right now.

But now, everything was gone.

The footsteps were heard constantly. Under everyone’s gaze, two figures slowly walked out from two different directions.

One of the figures had turned into a sharp sword, shattering the earth and flying to the Ninth Heaven.

Another figure was just like a behemoth from legends that could swallow everything, overwhelming everything in the universe.

The two people had already become the focus of everything.

With only a kilometer between them, the two appeared in the vast plain in front of the Cloud mountain range.

At this moment, they both looked up at nearly the same time, as if their real eyes collided in the air.

Whoosh!

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang’s body disappeared.

Zoom!

Xue Yun’s body disappeared at the same time too.

“Where are they?”

All the warriors watching this incomparable battle were confused. but suddenly, at the very center of the plain...

A terrifying sword light that could tear apart the heaven and earth collided with a blood-red blade that could swallow the universe.

Suddenly, the sky split and the ground cracked!
