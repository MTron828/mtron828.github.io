4493 Defeating the Enemy With a Single Finger

Whoosh!

As soon as the divine corpse of Supreme Tarot appeared, the sharp and earth-shaking aura instantly shocked everyone!

“This is the divine corpse of Wushuang!”

“It’s said that this divine corpse is the strongest divine corpse on Coffin Mountain. Even the Sect Master and the five Grand Elders couldn’t refine it!”

!!

“Scar… Scar-level aura! This divine corpse has already reached the Scar level!”

“No wonder Wushuang isn’t afraid of Senior Brother Yan Dan. He has this backing!”

Bang! Bang!

The corpse’s expression was numb, and his movements were stiff. He raised two of his fingers to form a sword finger and pointed at the shriveled arm that was coming from the void.

In an instant, endless Sword Qi burst out from the tip of the divine corpse’s finger!

Boom!!

An earth-shattering sound rang out, and the arm that had torn everything retracted instantly as if it had been electrocuted. Then, Yan Dan seemed to have suffered some kind of backlash, and he took three steps back, his face flushed.

It was not over yet. Another painful groan came from the void behind Yan Dan. A shriveled divine corpse with black hair fell out of the void.

This divine corpse was Da Huai.

Jian Wushuang defeated the enemy with one finger!

In an instant, everyone cried out in alarm.

They did not expect that Yan Dan, the first disciple of the Sect Master who had just been crowned as the number one disciple and had the Scar-level power, would be forced back by the Tarot divine corpse with a single finger!

“Bastard!” Yan Dan’s face was livid. He stared at Jian Wushuang and growled, “I was just careless just now. Let’s do it again!”

After he finished speaking, he began to gather all his void power crazily, and the entire square began to shake.

“Alright.” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and the coldness in his eyes grew. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Just as the two of them were confronting each other…

“Enough!”

The God Refining Sect Master frowned. Immediately, his words were absolute. As soon as he said those words, the square, which had been like a raging sea, suddenly calmed down.

An extremely vast and powerful force separated Jian Wushuang and Yan Dan.

“Sect Master!”

Seeing this, Yan Dan felt as if he had finally gathered his strength and wanted to throw a punch, but it was as if he had hit cotton. He felt extremely aggrieved.

“Sect Master, let me teach Wushuang a good lesson!”

“You want to teach him a lesson? Don’t you think you’ve embarrassed yourself enough?”

The God Refining Sect Master snorted and looked at Jian Wushuang, “Wushuang, let me ask you, what was the meaning of this before? Why did you block Yan Dan’s path?”

Jian Wushuang’s purpose of showing off his strength had been achieved. Therefore, when he saw the God Refining Sect Master interrupt his battle with Yan Dan, he did not feel much. He cupped his hands and replied calmly, “Sect Master, I stopped Senior Brother Yan Dan because he provoked me when he passed by me just now. He said that he wanted to make me his slave. I was so angry that I did what I did.”

When the God Refining Sect Master heard this, he could not help but look at Yan Dan, his face darkening.

“Look at you, you could have just left obediently after getting what you wanted, but you had to be clever and provoke others. Now, you’ve put yourself in a difficult position, haven’t you?”

Shaking his head, the Sect Master cursed in his heart, ‘What an idiot!’

After taking a deep breath, the God Refining Sect Master looked at Jian Wushuang and replied, “Alright, you and Dan Yan are from the same sect. In the future, you will both be the pillars of my God Refining Sect. You can’t get into a big fight over a small verbal conflict. Do you understand?

“Alright, this matter is over. Let’s end the banquet.”

The God Refining Sect Master stood up and shook his head.

“Yes!”

As the God Refining Sect Master stood up, the other disciples in the square naturally did not dare to remain seated. They all stood up to send the Sect Master off.

“Wushuang, you deserve to die!”

Yan Dan glared at Jian Wushuang and the veins on his forehead popped out because of his anger.

If they were not in the God Refining Sect, he would not have been able to suppress his impulse and would have killed Jian Wushuang.

“Wushuang, don’t worry. We still have a long way to go. I’ll slowly settle the matter between us in the future.”

With that, Yan Dan strode away.

A touch of disgust flashed in his eyes when he saw Jiu Sha. It was this woman who had made him lose face today. He was afraid that if he took her back to be his Dao Companion, he would only become a joke. It would be like he had picked up something that Jian Wushuang did not want.

“And you, lowly servant. Today’s matter was all because of you. After I kill Wushuang, I’ll slowly deal with you.”

With a cold snort, Yan Dan stomped on the ground with his right foot. The floor beneath him cracked, and a small pit appeared. He transformed into a beam of light and shot into the sky, disappearing from the square outside the Sect Master’s hall.

When Jiu Sha saw Yan Dan leave, her nervous heart finally eased.

She looked at Jian Wushuang gratefully and said thank you softly.

Jian Wushuang shook his head and did not pay much attention to her. After exchanging a glance with Elder Mi Feng, he walked in the direction that the God Refining Sect Master had left.

He still remembered that the God Refining Sect Master had once told him that after the Sect Disciple Competition was over, there would be a mission for him.

…

In the Sect Master’s hall.

The God Refining Sect Master sat at the head of the table. He looked at Wushuang, who did not leave with the crowd but followed him into the Sect Master’s hall, and nodded.

“Wushuang, I originally wanted to wait for you to rest for a few days before telling you about the mission. Since you’ve come, I will tell you now.”

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and nodded, “Sect Master, please speak.”

...

“Alright.” The Sect Master of the God Refining Sect looked into the distance. He did not speak immediately. Instead, he seemed to be thinking about what to say in his mind.

After a while, he said, “Wushuang, do you know of the Land of Gods in our universe?”

“The Land of Gods?”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. He had a feeling that what the God Refining Sect Master was about to say was one of the top secrets of the Void Universe.

“That’s right. Most people don’t know about the Land of Gods, so I’ll tell you about it today.”

The God Refining Sect Master’s eyes flickered and he muttered, “The Land of Gods is not one of the forbidden areas of our universe. It was formed after birth.”

“About tens of thousands of void eras ago, there were a few powerful beings from another universe that came to our universe. These beings were from the same place as those people who were with you when you first joined.”

“These alien races have unfathomable motives and are ruthless. After their identities were exposed, they started a massacre in our Void Universe. They are extremely powerful, and each of their cultivation is at least at the Six Scar level like me!”

“One of them has an even more unfathomable cultivation base, and his methods are strange. He has the power to suppress the life source, and he’s countless times more powerful than me!”

As the God Refining Sect Master spoke slowly, Jian Wushuang was shocked.

What is this…?!
