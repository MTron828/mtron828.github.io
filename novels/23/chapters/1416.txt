Chapter 1417: The First Level Of The Mind Status!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“The four-hundredth level!”

When Lei Chao saw Jian Wushuang had entered the four-hundredth level, he was excited, with his eyes beady and a smile on his face.

“Jian Wushuang. That is enough. Come on.” Lei Chao said.

Jian Wushuang stopped climbing and came to Lei Chao.

“I thought you could learn how to control your mind through cultivation in the Mind Cliff, but I didn’t expect you to be able to reach the first level of the mind status. It’s really good.” Lei Chao exclaimed.

“The first level of mind status?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“Haven’t you found that something has changed in your mind?” Lei Chao explained.

“Yes, I feel that, but I don’t know what the levels of mind status are.” Said the Jian Wushuang.

“The mind status is divided into three levels, and the first level is a clear mind connecting with soul. This level is difficult for ordinary Gods to reach, even in the Eternal Chaotic World, many Real Gods have not reached it.” Lei Chao said.

“Many Real Gods have not reached it?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Your second round of God Test is coming. At this juncture, it’s lucky for you to reach the first level in your mind status. It’s time to go back. There’s only a month left,” Lei Chao said.

“Yes, let’s go.”

Lei Chao and Jian Wushuang set out to leave directly.

When he left, Lei Chao sent a message to Su Rou, but he did not meet Su Rou again.

At an exquisite attic in the Dark Phoenix Pavilion

“What an indifferent man he is!” Su Rou was unsatisfied with Lei Chao. She asked her subordinate, “You just said that Jian Wushuang reached the 400th level of the Mind Cliff?”

“Yes, I witnessed it.”

“So that means Jian Wushuang has achieved the first level in his mind status? Su Rou’s eyes was twinkled with surprise. “What a genius! When will my disciples reach such a high level?”

She muttered and sighed for a long time.

After leaving the Dark Phoenix Pavilion Jian Wushuang and Lei Chao went directly to the Cloud Island.

“Jian Wushuang, Hall Matser Yuan asked us to go directly to the Firmament World. He has been waiting for us there.” Lei Chao said.

“Good.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Soon, they appeared in the Cloud Island, and through a wormhole in the island, they went directly to the Firmament World

The Firmament World was lifeless and isolated.

It was the perfect place for the God Test.

When they arrived, Hall Master Yuan was waiting there.

“How about your cultivation in the pavillion?” Hall Master Yuan asked

“Not bad. My mind improves.” Jian Wushuang answered.

Lei Chao added, “He has reached the first level of mind status.”

“Oh!” Hall Master Yuan was happy, “Great!”

It was very good for him to reach that level before the coming of the God Test.

“God Tests are extremely dangerous and full of life-threatening risks, especially the Inverse Cultivation Test. I was quite worried before, but now you have reached the first level of mind status, I am not so worried.”

Then Hall Master Yuan took out several treasures. “These are what I have prepared for you to pass your God Test.”

“These are two Heart Guard Elixirs.”

Hall Master first handed the two milky elixirs to Jian Wushuang. “They can make you feel calm and perform well in the God Test, especially when your state of mind is affected.”

Jian Wushuang received the elixirs immediately.

“And these two are Tribunal Passing Elixirs, for you to recover your wounds. The God Test is aimed at your mind status and there is seldom an attack, but you can keep them for unexpected circumstances.”

Jian Wushuang took the two elixirs.

“As for this…” Hall Matser Yuan took out a bronze mirror. The bronze mirror looked antique and extraordinary.

“This is the Exquisite Mirror. It also protects your mind at a critical time. It is one of the most powerful treasures in the Lineage of Star.” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Exquisite Mirror?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the mirror for a while and then thanked the Hall Master Yuan.

“You are welcome. As long as you can survive the God Test, all our efforts will be worth it.” Hall Master Yuan said, “Well, you should keep those things with you. There’s not much time left. You should make good use of it and keep yourself in an optimal state.”

“Yes.” Then Jian Wushuang sat down in an empty space above a vast sea to wait for the test.

He would receive the test there.

“Jian Wushuang, the second round of the God Test is more dangerous than the first, but it seems that you are calmer?” King of Venomous Worms asked.

Jian Wushuang said, “Yes, maybe because I have experienced such a process before, so I am less anxious now.”

“In my opinion, it has something to do with your improved state of mind.” King of Venomous Worms said. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Do you need to go out of my body during my God Test?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I don’t have to because the God Test will be mainly a test for the mind, without attacking your force.”

“That’s good.” Jian Wushuang said, then continued to wait.

“Huh!”

Jian Wushuang breathed slowly, making his heart completely calm.

His heart was quiet, and even the whole sky was quiet and peaceful.

He was now in his optimal state.

The God Test was coming!
