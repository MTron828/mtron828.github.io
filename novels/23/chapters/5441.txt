Chapter 5440 ¬†Meet Again

Jian Wushuang finally met Hu Qing.

In fact, they had met many times before, but they never had the chance to recognize each other.

"Brothe rWushuang!" Hu Qing's eyes sparkled.

Jian Wushuang was also delighted. Within the Qishen Temple, Hu Qing was the only person with whom he had a deep bond, and someone he could completely trust.

"It's been so many years!"

In the blink of an eye, nearly 10,000 years had passed.

The two set up a barrier and began discussing their experiences over the years.

Jian Wushuang's own affairs were hard to articulate; he could only be vague about them.

Hu Qing understood that these years had not been easy for him and didn't inquire further.

Instead, he learned some things about the Grave God Mountain from Hu Qing.

On the Grave God Mountain, the situation was as harsh as on the Original Planet.

On the Original Planet, even Dao Lords found it difficult to fall.

But on the Grave God Mountain, in these years, many Dao Lords of the Ultimate Dao had fallen.

Comfortable environments existed everywhere, but it all depended on strength.

Emperors with formidable power, like Shang, had no threats within the Qishen Temple; they had all gone to the River of Time.

They even explored the River of Time thoroughly, slaughtering countless Chaos Beasts of the tier 6 and even supreme-peak level.

They traversed this River of Time almost completely.

After all, it wasn't as powerful as the ancient Moro Time, which was much stronger than their River of Time.

In the current River of Time, the number of tier 6 Emperors was not even comparable to the natives of the Four Great Secret Realms.

However, the quality was considerably higher.

In the River of Time, there were numerous universes.

Many powerful beings were born, and there were many One Revolution tier 4 Emperors, probably countless times more than in the Four Great Secret Realms. However, there was almost no difference in the number of tier 4 Emperors, and tier 6 Emperors were even fewer than in the Four Great Secret Realms.

Now, from Jian Wushuang's perspective, there were probably over 10,000 tier 6 Emperors in Tiannan of the Earth Realm alone.

Kingdoms like Great Xia had at least a few thousand. Adding in some solitary tier 6 Emperors, the conservative estimate surpassed 10,000.

Hu Qing's expression paused as she recalled something.

He quickly introduced, "Brother Wushuang, this is my disciple, Jiang Shang!"

"The junior Jiang Shang pays respects to Senior Wushuang!" Jiang Shang revealed a faint smile, but deep down, she remained cautious of Jian Wushuang.

She always felt a certain evil aura from him, similar to the one who killed her brother.

Although Jian Wushuang had known this already, he still showed a surprised expression.

The former novice monk now had a disciple, and both master and disciple were peak-level tier 5 Emperors.

For their first meeting, Jian Wushuang took out a treasure from his mustard seed, a Soul-Sealing Jade, as a gift.

He obtained this treasure by killing the Mo Luo Crown Prince, making it a rare and valuable item.

The other party might not necessarily appreciate it, but the intention was there.

Handing over the Soul-Sealing Jade to Jiang Shang, Jian Wushuang lightly smiled, "Now that both master and disciple are Emperors, don't look down on it!"

After receiving the Soul-Sealing Jade, Jiang Shang thanked him and remained silent.

Soon, Zhen Wuyang also approached. Hu Qing quickly dispelled the barrier.

"Jian Wushuang!" Zhen Wuyang, without his former imposing aura, now appeared gentle.

Seeing him, Jian Wushuang quickly bowed, respectfully saying, "Greetings, Emperor!"

"No need for formalities. Our statuses are the same now, no need for such courtesy!"

They talked about many things, mentioning the Princes and Prince Yan.

However, they all fell.

Qishen Temple looted all the powerful beings in the Yan Immortal realm and then carried out a brutal selection process.

None of the Yan Immortal experts within the Great Si Region managed to enter the Grave God Mountain.

The farthest they reached was the Original Planet, where they perished at the hands of the Devouring Demons.

Some retired and returned to the Great Si Region, informing Zhen Wuyang's avatar about the situation.

At this moment, they had undergone significant changes.

Facing those extremely familiar individuals, even though they perished, there was no sense of sadness.

Especially Zhen Wuyang. Clearly, his children perished, yet he showed no regret.

In their eyes, those selected were the strong, and those who perished were the weak. There was nothing to regret.

Adhering to the strong is the way of kings, as well as the path of dominance.

Looking forward is everything; Jian Wushuang himself emerged from the mundane and committed his fair share of foolish deeds. He once gave up everything for a soulmate, only to find it turned into a fleeting dream upon reflection.

It might be better to turn all past experiences into a thread, suspended in the air.

The two briefly discussed some of their past experiences, but the majority of their conversation revolved around the murals in this place.

Anyone who had seen the murals couldn't help but be shocked!

It was predicting the future!

If it was a short-term prediction, it wouldn't be a big deal.

Having Jian Wushuang predict the fate of a mortal was almost a sure thing.

But predicting the destiny of an Emperor was a different story.

Even if he was an Emperor himself, he couldn't discern it.

Especially predicting from ancient times to the present.

This was simply unimaginable; on Grave God Mountain, they had never heard of such a thing.

However, on the murals in this place, their appearances were depicted.

They had once suspected whether the scenes appeared only when they entered.

However, three individuals had no discernible features or auras. If the changes occurred when they arrived, why didn't it reveal the faces of Jian Wushuang, Hu Qing, and Jiang Shang?

If it were true, it would be terrifying.

Zhen Wuyang and the others originally intended to communicate with Zhen Ling but found that they couldn't establish contact with the outside world from this place.

Just as everyone was puzzled, Jian Wushuang always felt something was amiss.

Where did Zhi Shan, the first to enter the Three Kings Court, go?

From the moment they entered until now, there was no sign of him.

If a few people disappeared, it would be understandable, but he was the only one who vanished.

The first to enter. V·ªãSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)cùíêm for new ùíèovùíÜlùíî

Gone!

While others hadn't paid much attention, Jian Wushuang became alert.

Emperors of tier 5 could enter here.

Zhi Shan's strength shouldn't be insufficient to enter!

Could it be that there's something strange here?

Just then, the hall trembled. Everyone looked up, and the sight nearly scared them out of their wits.

Tier 6 Emperors, and even Ultimate Emperors, felt a chill down their spines.

Above their heads, dozens of corpses were suspended.

In normal circumstances, corpses were nothing to be feared, especially not by these powerhouses.

But upon closer inspection, these corpses were none other than their own physical bodies!

Boom!

Jian Wushuang's scalp tingled, quickly stepping back and then looking down at his own arm.

His other avatar had shattered long before entering the Soul Dao, broken early on to avoid detection by others.

Now, in his true form with all treasures on him, he raised one arm, bursting through the sleeve and revealing the Candle Dragon Arm. It was all real.

Yet, his physical body was suspended above, appearing as a clearly defined corpse with a grayish complexion.

Everyone present was shocked!

Could they have fallen?

That was impossible!

Jian Wushuang took in a sharp breath.

Others were even more drenched in sweat on their foreheads.

Emperor Tianchan couldn't accept it. He exploded directly, attacking a tier 5 Emperor from the Elder Palace.

In an unguarded moment, he smashed the opponent's head with a palm, instantly sending blood mist into the air.
