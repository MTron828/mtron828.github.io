Chapter 1380: Three-starred Soul Master!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Screech!”

A shrill cry was heard across the universe. A crimson phoenix appeared before the Hungry Wolves Clan before Xue Feng.

Then, the feathers on the crimson phoenix turned into crimson flowing lights and merged into the Hungry Wolves Clan members with terrifying speed.

A dozen Hungry Wolves Clan members paused in the void. Then, fumble. Almost half of them fell forward.

“What?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“This… This is a consciousness attack!”

“It’s Soul Master. They have Soul Master among them!”

The remaining Hungry Wolves Clan members screamed, but didn’t dare to move forward.

The leader of the Hungry Wolves Clan, the man in the gold mask, took one step back and looked at the person next to him, “Mei, what’s going on?”

“I never expected that there would be two Soul Masters in this troop, and there’s one Soul Master that I can’t even detect,” the person in the black robe named Mei lowered her voice and replied, “However, although I can’t detect his existence, his consciousness attack wasn’t strong. His earlier technique was fierce but it only killed a level one Divine General. He didn’t kill just level two Divine Generals though. It obviously meant that he wasn’t too high of a level too. He is at most a two-starred Soul Master and he has just leveled up very recently.”

“Two starred Soul Master? You take care of him then,” the man in gold mask said.

“No problem,” the person in the black robe named Mei nodded and took a step forward.

On the other side, Jian Wushuang, standing among Xue Feng’s troop, looked rather cold.

“I am out of practice. The earlier technique collapsed on the way. Otherwise… There are not many from the Hungry Wolves Clan who could have survived the technique earlier,” Jian Wushuang thought in his head.

His Soul strength was near to the level of a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven. If he were to put his full power to play, even a Universe God in the Third Heaven wouldn’t be able to resist. Even if it was a group attack, it wasn’t something a second level Divine General could withstand either. However, when the crimson phoenix swept out, it only killed those first level one Divine Generals.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang lifted his head. He had already seen the person in the black robe named Mei walking towards him.

“I never expected that there would be a two-starred Soul Master in your little troop. I wonder – what’s the two-starred Soul Master’s name?” Mei asked.

“Jian Wushuang,” Jian Wushuan replied straightaway.

“Jian Wushuang?” Mei kept quiet for a while, but she shook her head after that, “I know any two-starred Soul Masters who are slightly famous but I’ve never heard of you. It seems that you only just broke through and became a two-starred Soul Master. How about this? I shall give you a chance to join the Hungry Wolves Clan. This way you can save your own life.”

Jian Wushuang sneered at what she said, “If you were to kneel down and bow before me to ask for mercy, I would let you live.”

“You’re asking for it!”

There was a flash of coolness in Mei’s eyes. The very next moment, swoosh! A huge black shadow that was formed by consciousness suddenly charged towards Jian Wushuang. The black shadow was a huge cobra.

Not only was the cobra huge in size, but it was also extremely flexible.

“I’m impressed. This person’s manipulation of consciousness is much stronger than Xue Tong,” Jian Wushuang complimented in silence, but his eyes suddenly turned cold.

Hong!

His Soul Power suddenly erupted. Then, Jian Wushuang had never performed Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack but straightaway performed a Soul Constrain vigorously.

Soul Power that was close to a Peak in the Third Heaven was like a heavy hammer than suddenly slammed down onto the plundering cobra. It shattered the cobra into pieces and continued to move forward at Mei.

“How is this possible?”

There was an unprecedented terror in Mei’s eyes below the black mask. Her eyes were wide open.

“Three-starred!”

“Three-starred Soul Master!”

A shrill voice was heard from Mei and her eyes grew dim.

Swoosh!

Mei’s figure fell down.

The sight shocked everyone on the scene, including the siblings, Xue Feng and Xue Tong.

“Three-starred Soul Master?” Everyone couldn’t help but mumble to themselves.

In Tian Ling Land, if a two-starred Soul Master was rare, a three-starred Soul Master was even more hard to come by.

In the nearby towns, there was definitely less than five three-starred Soul Masters!

Such big figures would definitely make everyone around the region shiver in fear.

Then, there was such existence before them.

“Damn it!”

The leader of the Hungry Wolves Clan, the man in the gold mask, roared and glared at Jian Wushuang.

In Tian Yuan Land, Soul Masters were scary and they were definitely the strongest players within their own level.

For instance, a two-starred Soul Master would be much stronger compared to a second level Divine General.

Then, a three-starred Soul Master was naturally much stronger than an ordinary level three Divine General.

“Let’s go!”

Although the man in gold mask was upset, he could only leave.

Under his command, the rest of the Hungry Wolves Clan members let out a breath of relief and retreated.

They were really not brave enough to fight against a three-starred Soul Master.

However, just as the man in gold mask turned to leave…

“You come as you wish and leave as you wish. Aren’t you living a little too comfortably?” Jian Wushuang cold voice rang out. Then, the Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hands.

Wah!

Jian Wushuang moved and suddenly charged forward.

“Such speed!”

Xue Feng, Xue Tong and the people in their troop were terrified by the speed Jian Wushuang revealed.

Such a speed was obviously faster than any of theirs.

The man in the gold mask saw that Jian Wushuang moved forward directly. He wasn’t angry, but actually happy instead.

“Son, you’re just a Soul Master and you dared to fight in close combat with me?”

The man in the gold mask had a murderous intention that was flaring up.

Three-starred Soul Master was scary indeed. However, such terror only existed when there was a certain distance between him and the opponent. Then, he could opt to fight with Soul Power.

But then, Jian Wushuang charged towards him to fight in close combat recklessly?

Wasn’t he asking for death?

On the Tian Ling Mystery Land, which Soul Master dared to fight close combat with a warrior?

“Die!”

The man in the gold mask immediately took out a huge ax and wielded it with strong strength.

Jian Wushuang too erupted his power to its limit and performed a unique skill!

“Ghosting!”

Boundless swordlights swept out and overlapped at a terrifying speed. It was as though thousands of millions of swordlights had gathered in the same spot.

The power of swordlight then exploded.

“Dang!”

After a loud collision, a terrifying power swept through the surroundings.

After another loud clash, the man in the gold mask staggered and fell backwards.
