Chapter 1598: Kill!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The ten sword shadows, every single one equaled a full hit of a beginner Eternal Real God.

Just then, the ten sword shadows fused into one completely.

The brand new sword shadow contained an outrageous power, even Real God Shi Jue couldn’t help but crease his eyebrows under the sword shadow.

“I comprehended for five hundred years with full concentration and created this strongest stroke!”

“This stroke is made from ten sword principles. Hence, its name is Ten Waves!”

“Go!”

Jian Wushuang ambled and waved the sword in his hand.

In the void at the top, the sword shadow that was fused together by ten sword shadows descended.

The entire heaven and earth pressed down.

Under the pressure, Real God Shi Jue realized that he wouldn’t be able to dodge the sword shadow regardless. He could only opt for fighting head-on.

“Sky Breaking Claw!”

Real God Shi Jue roared and the golden, ferocious exotic beast that he substantiated suddenly shimmered with gold as boundless divine power concentrated in its claw. Then, he took a huge stride and swung his sharp claw that gathered endless power.

There was a golden crack in the sky.

It was as though the claw split heaven and earth apart.

Then, the two bolts of terrifying attack collided.

Bang!

A tremendous noise shook the earth.

The sword shadows that filled the sky shot out in all directions in madness and it left huge space cracks in the void.

Jian Wushuang looked and took three steps back.

As for Real God Shi Jue, the golden, ferocious exotic beast that he substantiated was thrown out by the impact. As it flew off, its body continued to churn and it only regained stability after it staggered for a while.

Then, his face grew even paler.

“B*stard!”

“It’s a pity that I can only give seventy percent of my power to play. Otherwise, I definitely can win against you!” Real God Shi Jue bellowed.

Hearing Real God Shi Jue’s bellow, Jian Wushuang’s face grew solemn.

Real God Shi Jue was right. If he were to be able to let out his peak fighting power, he really could fight against Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang also could tell that the strongest stroke that he had performed earlier, in terms of the power of sword principle, actually wasn’t stronger than Real God Shi Jue’s Sky Breaking Claw.

“Although the stroke I performed was fierce, I think it’s lacking something,” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows and said.

Ten Waves that he performed earlier were extremely strong in power. In terms of its level, it could barely reach the threshold of advance rank two unique skill. However, Jian Wushuang found the stroke far from perfect. If he could make up the flaws, his stroke would definitely be stronger or even achieve another brand new level.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re lucky this time. Don’t come across me again next time. Otherwise, I will definitely kill you!” Real God Shi Jie glared at Jian Wushuang coldly. Then, he immediately turned into a flowing light and plunged into the void faraway.

“You want to leave?” Jian Wushuang smirked coldly and immediately chased after in full speed.

“Jian Wushuang, I can’t kill you. But it’s even more impossible if you want to kill me. Don’t waste time,” Real God Shi Jie noticed Jian Wushuang who trailed behind him and he roared.

“Waste time? I don’t think so!” Jian Wushaung’s gaze was cold.

“Alright then. Continue to follow me if you have the guts. At most, I’ll run to Four Symbol Land directly. I’d like to see if the top genius in Lineage of Star would dare to enter Four Symbol Land,” Real God Shi Jue said coldly. When he was fighting with Jian Wushuang, he enquired Real God Wu Wang for information about Jian Wushuang and he knew that Four Symbol Mansion harbored great resentment against Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang squinted.

Real God Shi Jue reminded him that Soaring Heaven Land was right next to Four Symbol Land. If he were to continue to drag on, forget about Soaring Heaven King Palace, he reckoned the experts from Four Symbol Mansion would catch up too. By then, he would be in big trouble.

“Real God Shi Jue is extremely powerful. Although he was severely injured and unable to put his peak power to play, he still isn’t an easy target to kill. If I want to take care of this quickly, there’s only one way!” Jian Wushuang thought and the power of Star Palace hidden in his body was put to full play at the very next moment.

The secret skill of Star Palace, he performed it straightforwardly!

At the same time, there was vigor churning in Jian Wushuang and the divine power in him started burning in madness.

The secret skill of Star Palace, the second volume!

Secret skill of Dragon Blood, the second level!

They were performed simultaneously.

Jian Wushuang’s speed instantly increased by a hundred times!

Phew!

Like a gale, Jian Wushuang, who was originally a thousand miles away, suddenly took a huge leap in an instant and came behind Real God Shi Jue.

Then, he raised the sword in his hand.

“Die!”

There was a bellow then a sword was swung out.

“What?”

Real God Shi Jue stared. He could feel a strong death danger from the stroke and his face instantly grew grave. He waved his sharp claw and wanted to withstand the stroke.

However, due to the difference in their traveling speed, Jain Wushuang’s stroke slashed Real God Shi Jue without hindrance.

Bang!

Real God Shi Jue quivered and he didn’t even manage to scream hysterically before his divine body became a cloud of blood mist. He was more than dead.

Jian Wushuang continued to float there as he watched everything in silence. There was faint amazement in his eyes. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“The second volume of the secret skill of Star Palace increased the power that I performed by a hundred times. When I slash a stroke, I reckon it is even stronger than an ordinary Chaotic Real God’s full hit. Although Real God Shi Jue is an Eternal Real God and his defense power is decent, and he might even have Real-God-level armor, in the end, he couldn’t withstand it and died an instant death!”

“Simple, brutal, extremely fierce!”

It stirred a great commotion in Jian Wushuang’s heart.

The secret skill of Star Palace… the strongest secret skill among the four secret skill in Lineage of Star was also the most famous secret skill.

The secret skill was also one of the fundamental reasons why Lineage of Star was so strong.

The secret skill was segregated into three volumes.

Before Jian Wushuang break through and become a Universe God in the Third Heaven, he could only train for the first volume. When he performed it, it could increase his attack power by tenfold and it’d last for ten breaths.

After he became Universe God in the Third Heaven, he did the second volume of the secret skill of Star Palace.

The second volume of the secret skill of Star Palace could increase his attack power by a hundredfold in an instance!

It was a hundred times!

With Jian Wushuang’s current power, his full-on sword principle could barely be compared favorably with a hit by advanced Eternal Real God. However, when it increased by a hundred times, the power would be much stronger than many Chaotic Real Gods’ full hit. Real God Shi Jue was already severely injured, how could he withstand the hit?

Hence, there was the scene.

“Honestly speaking, I am doubtful if the secret of Star Palace was created by the founder of Lineage of Star because the secret skill is too scary,” King of Venomous Worms’ voice rang in Jian Wushuang’s head.

“It is really scary,” Jian Wushuang nodded in agreement.

Jian Wushuang didn’t feel so when he completed the first volume.

But then, when he had completed the second volume, he could see the scariness of the secret skill.

“However, there is a limitation to this secret skill. Such as, when performing the second volume, it can only last for one breath,” Jian Wushuang muttered.
