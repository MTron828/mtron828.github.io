“The owner of Sky Sword Mountain?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“The owner of Sky Sword Prison said that you wanted him to release someone from the Sky Sword Prison once but he didn’t agree. Now, he has promised you that you can release anyone with two White Blaze Fruit,” Lei Chao said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang found it strange.

“Humph, to release a Real God, one White Blaze Fruit is more than enough. He asked for two?” King of Venomous Worms humped in Jian Wushuang’s head.

“You act at your own discretion. The two White Blaze Fruits are not definite. The owner of Sky Sword Mountain himself said it could be discussed,” Lei Chao said.

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang understood the situation.

In Sky Sword Prison, Fiery King was still imprisoned. If possible, Jian Wushuang would figure out a way to bail Fiery King out.

As for the White Blaze Fruit… It depended on the amount of White Blaze Fruit that he got after the grand fight banquet. He could decide then.

“Jian Wushuang, let me remind you that as we have received the news of you getting a White Blaze Fruit, various Universe Gods in Wu Bei’s cave definitely will have received the news too. They know that you have a White Blaze Fruit with you, so it is inevitable that there will be an expert who wants to take it away from you. Hence, be careful. In Wu Bei’s cave, there is quite a number of Universe Gods who are at a higher rank than you are. If you were to really be at a critical junction, give up White Blaze Fruit and save your own life,” Lei Chao exhorted.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He wasn’t stupid either. He wouldn’t really sacrifice his live for a White Blaze Fruit.

After they cut off the connection, Jian Wushuang continued to wander around the cave dwelling.

On the island where experts had gathered, the entrance to Wu Bei’s cave was still wide open. There were Universe Gods from everywhere in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries that entered one after another.

At that very moment, there was a young man in a white robe carrying a saber on his back that had appeared on the island.

The young man in the white robe had long brown hair, a pair of drowsy eyes and a handsomely cold face. He was a man with a remarkable appearance.

“That’s the entrance to Wu Bei’s cave?”

“During the years in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, I have been challenging experts from all over. However, the strongest that I’ve met is one who was close to Universe God ranking list. He didn’t even make me have to give my all. But in Wu Bei’s cave now, more than eighty percent of experts on Universe God ranking list are gathered here…”

“This is a battlefield for true experts. It’s a battlefield that belongs to me!”

The young man in a white robe looked at the cave dwelling below as his eyes shimmered with joy.

“I heard that Jian Wushuang is in Wu Bei’s cave too. I hope I can meet him.”

With a faint smile, the young man in a white robe plunged down and entered Wu Bei’s cave.

There were many experts on the island who were astonished.

“Such swift speed. This speed… seems to surpass ordinary Real God’s!”

“Who is the person who went in just now?”

“I don’t know. He isn’t an expert on Universe God ranking list. He should be a solo expert who isn’t quite famous.”

“The birth of Wu Bei’s cave has led to the appearance of many Universe Gods who aren’t famous before but very powerful. The person earlier was one of them.

…

In Wu Bei’s cave, the fight over the White Blaze Fruit was still on going.

On the fourth day Jian Wushuang entered the cave dwelling, he found a White Blaze Fruit.

But in the following ten days, Jian Wushuang didn’t even find one Iron Wing Beast.

On the eleventh day.

Hong!!!

A vigorous roar spread. Although it was very far away, Jian Wushuang heard it at the very first instance.

“That direction!”

Jian Wushuang immediately locked into one direction and rushed over in an explosion of speed.

When he appeared in the battlefield, he saw four Universe Gods joining forces to hem the Iron Wing Beast in to kill it.

The four Universe Gods besieged the Iron Wing Beast and there were already wounds on it. Then, Jian Wushuang joined the battlefield straightaway without hesitation.

His participation shocked the other four Universe Gods and they immediately recognized Jian Wushuang.

“It’s Jian Wushuang!”

“Top twenty on Universe God ranking list!”

“Shit!”

Jian Wushuang dashed into the battlefield and the four Universe Gods didn’t have the ability to stop him. They saw the eruption of Jian Wushuang’s Sword Principle and his thunder-like techniques instantly killed the Iron Wing Beast.

However, after Jian Wushuang had killed the Iron Wing Beast, he didn’t see the existence of Qian Kun ring like the previous dead body.

“No White Blaze Fruit. The effort was in vain,” Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly but he had no choice.

The Iron Wing Beast in Wu Bei’s cave, not every one of them carried a White Blaze Fruit. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

After killing an Iron Wing Beast, it depended on luck if there was a White Blaze Fruit or not.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

A bunch of figures caught up with them. They were Universe Gods who rushed over due to the fighting. In addition to the four Universe Gods who had besieged the Iron Wing Beast, there was a total of ten people.

The ten of them scattered as they stared at Jian Wushuang.

“The four of us joined forces and we finally did injury to the Iron Wing Beast with great difficulty. However, Mister Jian Wushuang, you killed the Iron Wing Beast on your own in an instant. You live up to your name as an expert in the top twenty on the Universe God ranking list. I admire you,” one of the four Universe Gods who besieged the Iron Wing Beast earlier, a brown-haired elderly said.

“There’s no use if I killed it. There isn’t any White Blaze Fruit in the Iron Wing Beast’s body,” Jian Wushuang replied.

The surrounding Universe Gods exchanged a look. They saw it themselves. Jian Wushuang really didn’t get a Qian Kun ring from the dead body of the Iron Wing Beast.

“Although this Iron Wing Beast doesn’t have it, from what I know, Mister Jian Wushuang killed an Iron Wing Beast alone previously and took out a White Blaze Fruit from it,” the brown-haired elderly suddenly said.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly and smiled, “Why? Unless you’re interested in the White Blaze Fruit that I got previously?”

“I dare not. I am only casually bringing it up. I do not have the guts to take anything away from Mister Jian Wushuang. Farewell,” the brown-haired elderly said, then turned to leave.

The other Universe Gods took another glance at Jian Wushuang but they didn’t have the courage to fight him. They left one after another.

Most of them had received a reminder from the higher-ups of their sects. If they were to come across experts in the top thirty on the Universe God ranking list, unless there were tens of Universe Gods to launch an attack together, or if there was another expert on the Universe God ranking list to join the fight, they should leave immediately.

Without sufficient formation strength, fighting over a White Blaze Fruit with a top thirty expert on Universe God ranking list, was simply courting death.

Ten Universe Gods, there were nine who left very quicky, but there was one who didn’t leave.

It was an ugly young man with dark skin. The young man carried a strange crimson saber on his back and the aura that he gave out was quite wicked too.

With a tinge of a chilly gleam, his gaze was fixed on Jian Wushuang.
