Chapter 909: The Arrival of Di Jing

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The man turned out to be Di Jing, whom Jian Wushuang met in the Acient World and saved his life.

Di Jing was a surbodinate of Emperor Xiao.

“I don’t come alone. She came here with me.” Di Jing pointed to the door behind Jian Wushuang.

Turning around, Jian Wushuang noticed a dirty girl who hid behind the door.

“Leng Ruxue?” Jian Wushuang felt surprised.

“Hi, big brother. I haven’t seen you in a while.” Leng Ruxue walked toward him with a bright smile.

Jian Wushuang was wearing an odd expression as he looked at her.

He had met Leng Ruxue before, and knew she was the younger sister of Leng Rushuang. However, he?found that Leng Rushuang was the only princess in Tang of the East. No one heard of Leng Ruxue.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang wondered about her. Now they met again.

“How come you are still young after so many years?” Jian Wushuang chuckled.

“I ‘m a grownup.” Leng Ruxue answered proudly.

Jian Wushuang laughed and turned to Di Jing.

“Dear Di Jing, are you in the Ancient World with Emperor Xiao? Why you come here with my First Senior Brother?” Jian Wushuang sat beside him and aksed.

He used to think Di Jing’s strength was unfathomable, although he was not as strong as Emperor Xiao. As Jian Wushuang improved his strength and opened his mind, he was able to judge the real Realm Di Jing entered.

Dao Master!

As the seventh War God of Emperor Xiao, Di Jing was a real expert at the level of Dao Master.

“My lord went back to the Eternal World. I come to see you.” Di Jing smiled.

“See me? About the Selection Ceremony?” Jian Wushuang guessed.

“Yes.” Di Jing nodded seriously, “Miss Leng is my lord’s flesh and blood. He has been helping her detoxify the Ice Heart Poison for years. He loves his daughter so much.”

“A few days ago, my lord heard that Emperor Leng would hold a Selection Ceremony for Miss Leng. So we came here instantly.”

“Sure enough.” Jian Wushuang was not surprised.

Emperor Leng wanted to make alliances with Xia Clan through marriage, to which Emperor Xiao would never consent.

“So my lord let me ask you, would you participate in the Selecion Ceremony held three years later?” Di Jing got right to the point.

“Of course I would.” Jian Wushuang did not hesitate.

“So, if you win at the Selection Ceremony, you will marry my lord’s daughter?” Di Jing stared at him.

“I will.” Jian Wushuang nodded, “but only if Miss Leng is willing to marry me.”

“Hey, don’t worry, my big brother. I’m sure my sister will marry you.” Leng Ruxue giggled.

Jian Wushuang shrugged.

“Well, let’s disscuss it.” Di Jing began to talk.

“The Selection Ceremony will invite experts from all the forces. Many geniuses want to win, but there’s only one winner. So the competition will be fierce.”

“And the cometition focuses on two things.”

“One is the wedding gifts.”

“The other is talent strength.”

“The geniuses eligible to participate must have a certain power behind them. Some of them may be the top geniuses from all the forces, while some may be personal disciples who have been carefully cultivated by old masters. In short, since they will attend the Ceremony,?their wedding gifts are definitely great.”

“Among these geniuses, the one who has the biggest power behind him is Xia Mang, First Master of Xia Clan.”

“The marriage between Xia Clan and Tang of the East is bound to happen. Emperor Leng had conspired with Xia Clan earlier. As the biggest overlord clan in Tang of the East, Xia Clan will prepare extraordianry wedding gifts.”

“Jian Wushuang, have you prepared any wedding gifts?” Di Jing asked. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“I do have prepared some, but I don’t know if they are better than those of Xia Clan.” Jian Wushuang frowned.

After he knew the Selection Ceremony from Wang Yuan, he immediately began to prepare two wedding gifts.

They were Crape Myrtle Elixir and Bodhi Dan. The Elixir could surpress the poison inside Leng Rushuang.

The two gifts were treasures. Especially the Bodhi Fruit, it could help an Eternal Realm expert become Dao Master.

Jian Wushuang was confident that his wedding gifts could match those of other guniuses, but he was not sure weather they were better than the gifts of Xia Clan.

After all, being the biggest overlord clan in Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land, Xia Clan had an impressive history.

Their wedding gifts would be well prepared.

Not to mention, Jian Wushuang needed to surpass Xia Mang in every aspect.

“My lord said he could help you if your wedding gifts are not good enough.” Di Jing said.

“Are you sure?”Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Emperor Xiao is Leng Rushuang’s father. How can he prepare the wedding gifts for his son-in-law?

Xue Lingtian said nothing beside them. At this moment, he said to Di Jing, “We won’t bother Emperor Xiao. Since Wushuang is the disciple of Ancient Sect, we will prepare his wedding gifts.”

“My junior brother,” Xue Lingtian looked at Jian Wushuang, “I will tell our master about this. His gifts won’t let you down.”

“Thanks.” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily. He was confident in his master’s mysterious and amazing skills.

After hearing his words, Di Jing’s complexion turned odd.

According to the information he received, the master of Jian Wushuang and Xue Lingtian was only an Eternal Realm expert from an ordinary sect in the remote domain.

How can an Eternal Realm expert prepare great wedding gifts?

Although puzzled, he didn’t talk about it too much, because Jian Wushuang and Xue Lingtian were so confident.

“Now that we do not have to worry about the wedding gifts, the only thing left is strength. Jian Wushuang, can you battle with Xia Mang?”

Di Jing looked at him.
