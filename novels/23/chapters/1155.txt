Chapter 1156: The Death

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Jian Wushuang, did you meet the Holy Masters from the Green Fire Palace when you flew around Chillywind Valley? Have you told your location to others?” Samsara Temple Master asked.

“I’m sure that I didn’t meet experts from the Jin Kingdom and the people from our Green Fire Palace at that moment. As for my location…” Jian Wushuang suddenly felt surprised. “Celestial Master Golden Axe knows!”

“What? Celestial Master Golden Axe?” The five Palace Masters immediately looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Celestial Master Golden Axe is the only person who knows my location,” Jian Wushuang said.

He continued, “Celestial Master Golden Axe seemed to get into trouble on the battlefield and wanted several Holy Masters who had reached the level of the Exceptional Realm to help him, so he sent a message to me. I promised him that I would come, but I realized that his strength was far superior to mine, so I gave up.

“It was because he sent the message to me that I told him my location.”

“Has Celestial Master Golden Axe really done it?”

The five Palace Masters all frowned.

Celestial Master Golden Axe was indeed a good man with a good reputation in the Green Fire Palace.

He once fought against the Jin Kingdom on behalf of the Green Fire Palace, and even killed several Holy Masters from the Jin Kingdom.

He went through fire and water for his own friends, but he never cared about the favor that others owed him.

Was he really the spy from the Jin Kingdom?

“In fact, I suspected that there was a spy from the Jin Kingdom in our Green Fire Palace long before.”

Samsara Temple Master frowned and then said, “Our Green Fire Palace sent Ji Wumeng to exercise Samsara at a great expense before, and we were very careful about it. Therefore, the Jin Kingdom shouldn’t know about this matter, but they did. I guessed that it was our people who revealed the confidence at that moment, but I didn’t think that it was Celestial Master Golden Axe.”

“It’s difficult to understand a man!” Red Lotus shouted coldly with clenched hands.

“He has only appeared for less than five million years and knew the matters about Jin Wumeng and Jian Wushuang. He is likely to be the spy from the Jin Kingdom,” Void Temple Master said in a low voice.

“It’s too early to assert that he is the spy because we have no hard evidence now. If we go and find him, he probably won’t admit it. But we have no way now because he is indeed very popular in the Green Fire Palace,” Tang Emperor said.

“It’s very easy for us to find some hard evidence,” Sunrise Sword Emperor said.

“Shall we draw the snake out of its hole? What should we do?” Jian Wushuang and the other Palace Masters all stared at Sunrise Sword Emperor.

“They think that Jian Wushuang has been assassinated at this moment. If Celestial Master Golden Axe is the real spy, he must be a little scared. Therefore, it is not easy for us to get him out now. We should wait and then begin our action after he lets down his guard…” Sunrise Sword Emperor suggested.

“Okay.” The other four Palace Masters all nodded.

“So you’d better stay in the Green Fire Palace for some days. After we know who is the real spy, you can leave, okay?” Tang Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “Well, there is another thing that needs the help of a Palace Master.”

“What? You can feel free to say it.” Void Temple Master laughed.

The five Palace Masters regarded Jian Wushuang as an expert with the same strength as them. If they did not intend to hide him, they would probably announce that Jian Wushuang would become the sixth Palace Master of the Green Fire Palace.

“My dead Original Body carried a lot of treasures and an insect beast. When I was chased by Red Snow King and knew that I couldn’t escape, I asked the insect beast to fly away with those treasures in advance.

“And then my Original Body was smashed in Chillywind Valley. The Blaze Quicksand Gourd was likely to fall into the bottom of the valley, so we could hardly get it again. However, my other treasures and that insect beast still remain on that battlefield, so… I want to ask a Palace Master to go there and bring that insect beast back. After all, I can’t go to that battlefield at this moment.” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“It’s simple, and I can help you.” Samsara Temple Master said with a smile, “My Original Body is also on the battlefield and is not far away from there, so I’d be glad to bring your insect beast back personally.”

“Sorry to trouble you,” Jian Wushuang gratefully said. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“It’s my pleasure. You need to tell me where your insect beast is.” Samsara Temple Master thought that it was nothing and then smiled.

After that, the five Palace Masters talked about it with Jian Wushuang for more than half a day and then left, while Jian Wushuang continued to stay in the secret chamber. Moreover, Tang Emperor also stayed there to keep Jian Wushuang from being discovered.

Meanwhile, the five Palace Masters immediately announced the news of Jian Wushuang’s death to the Holy Masters from the Green Fire Palace.

When people heard that Jian Wushuang had been assassinated and died on the battlefield, they felt very shocked.

“Is Jian Wushuang dead?”

“The Jin Kingdom! The Jin Kingdom!!!”

“Tianhuan King, Golden Rock King, Tianying King, and Red Snow King, who were said to have died, all appeared on the battlefield. They are famous Universe Masters, but they set a trap to assassinate Jian Wushuang, didn’t they? They are so shameless!”

“It’s a pity that Jian Wushuang, a peerless genius, has died!”

“I heard that Jian Wushuang had become a Dao Master. He had the same strength as our five Palace Masters. If he continued to exercise his skills and then become a Holy Master in the future, he would probably have become the leader of our Green Fire Palace, but now he has died…”

“Jian Wushuang is dead, but the Jin Kingdom also lost something. Jian Wushuang led the four kings of the Jin Kingdom to an impasse in a place called Chillywind Valley before he died, and then they paid a great price for this. Tianying King seems to have been killed by Jian Wushuang!”

“Jian Wushuang knew that he was doomed to die, so he tried his best to make the Jin Kingdom lose some more things. He is really good!”

The people of the Green Fire Palace were all discussing it.

When the Holy Masters in the Green Fire Palace learned that Jian Wushuang had been assassinated by the kings from the Jin Kingdom, they felt very angry. But when they heard that he had killed a Universe Master of the Jin Kingdom and painted Red Snow King into a corner before he died, they were very shocked and felt great admiration.

But in fact, what they felt most was regret.

They felt sorry for Jian Wushuang, the peerless genius.

That was because although Jian Wushuang was only a Dao Master, he could fight against Universe Masters and even killed one of them. If he hadn’t died, he would have had a great future.

Unfortunately, he had died. The Jin Kingdom had expected for Jian Wushuang to have greater strength in the future and then become a disaster to their country, so they took pains to ask the four kings to assassinate him, and they succeeded.
