Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Hum?”

The Lord of Skywave Prefecture’s expression changed when he felt the tides of Sword Essence somewhat hindering his movements.

“Hum, a special trick. It looks like ‘Domain’, but it is not the real?thing,” the Lord of Skywave Prefecture said coldly. He suddenly withdrew his hand. The next moment, a magic red light gleamed in his hand.

The flash of light looked violent and blazing. The moment Jian Wushuang saw it, his heart could not help but skip a beat.

The Lord of Skywave Prefecture held the flash of red light and then launched a powerful punch toward Jian Wushuang.

“Dragon Howl!” He shouted with a frightening look.

Dragon Roar, his strongest skill, was displayed.

The huge punch looked ordinary, but when it appeared, flames suddenly filled the sky, converging into a Gigantic Flaming Dragon. With an incredible howl, it rushed toward Jian Wushuang.

In an instant, the weather changed and the whole area trembled.

Jian Wushuang felt the strength of this flaming dragon, but managed to keep a cool expression.

Even ordinary experts of the Saint Realm who saw this powerful move would take it seriously, as did Jian Wushuang.

“Try my next stroke.” Jian Wushuang spoke.

He coldly stared at his opponent, with a roaring killing intent. He slowly slashed out with the Triple-kill Sword, and the Phantom Giant behind him also attacked.

The moment the stroke lashed out, the whole world became dead still.

All the onlookers held their breath.

Everyone stared at the stroke and shivered in fright. Although they knew they were not the target, they still felt as if they would be killed by it.

Quite a few experts were petrified by this stroke.

The second move of the Blood Emptying Technique, Sky-shaking Stroke!

As a superior third-grade Sword Skill, the Blood Emptying Technique only had three moves, but all the moves were very powerful.

The first move of the Blood Emptying Technique, All-smashing Stroke, was powerful enough.

The second move could release more power than the first one.

The stroke could destroy the whole world and exterminate everything.

Jian Wushuang had just mastered the second move and had not used it against anyone yet.

The Lord of Skywave Prefecture was the first opponent Jian Wushuang attacked using this move.

The huge sword shadow collided with the flaming dragon, but the head-on collision did not result in a loud sound.

The two forces quietly weakened each other at breakneck speed.

Suddenly, a huge fireball moved toward Jian Wushuang, burning his upper-clothes and even beginning to burn parts of his upper body. Fortunately, he triggered his Spiritual Power to extinguish the fire, or he would have been burnt to ash.

In fact, the upper part of his body was blackened by the fire, with some parts even being scorched.

“What a terrifying attack!”?Jian Wushuang looked at his blackened body and sighed in private. Then he sneered.?“He might not be in good condition after receiving my strike.”

Jian Wushuang looked up, towards the Lord of Skywave Prefecture. The latter widened his eyes and spat out a mouthful of blood.

The onlookers could not help but exclaim.

“He spat blood!”

“The Lord of Skywave Prefecture spat blood?”

“One spat blood, the other was burned.”

“What a bitter fight!”

It was bitter indeed.

Many people originally thought the Lord of Skywave Prefecture would win, as he had been famous for longer and should be stronger than the young man.

However, now, no one dared to think this way.

The Lord of Skywave Prefecture wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth, breathing deeply as he looked toward Jian Wushuang. “I took it lightly. I didn’t expect your stroke to be full of killing intent. My carelessness gave you an opportunity. I won’t let it happen again.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang asked while smiling slightly.

“Let’s fight!” The Lord of Skywave Prefecture snarled and launched another attack.

With a roaring killing intent, Jian Wushuang prepared to block it.

The final battle continued.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The crashes shook the area and the frightening power spread to the ground below. The land changed so much that it was no longer recognizable, yet Jian Wushuang and the Lord of Skywave Prefecture were still locked in a fierce battle.

Both of them tried their best, but they could only draw against each other.

The onlookers enjoyed it.

The tide-like Sword Realm that Jian Wushuang emanated started to change without any signs.

The tide-like Sword Essence became more turbulent, spreading more widely. After a while, the Realm of Sword Essence had pervaded a radius of more than 1,000 meters.

In the Sword Realm, endless Sword Essence swept toward the Lord of Skywave Prefecture like a tsunami.

“What?”?The Lord of Skywave Prefecture’s face changed.

Jian Wushuang was ecstatic at this moment.

“The third move of the Sword Realm, Sword Sea!”

Jian Wushuang mastered the second move of the Sword Realm a year ago. Then he had studied the third move, which was quite profound. Though he spent a year practicing it, he still felt he had not fully grasped it.

He did not expect to comprehend Sword Sea during this fierce fight. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yet, it happened so easily.

Experts of the Daluo Heaven Sect would go crazy in envy if they knew. After all, the Sword Realm came from the Daluo Heaven Sect. A large number of experts had studied this Sword Skill in the history of the Daluo Heaven Sect, but none of them had mastered the third move, Sword Sea.

Jian Wushuang had only practiced the Sword Realm for about a year, but now he had mastered Sword Sea.

It was a big surprise for him.

Jian Wushuang was somewhat stunned. After coming to his senses, he looked toward the Lord of Skywave Prefecture and spoke in a cold voice.

“Lord of Skywave Prefecture, it seems that you will die today,” Jian Wushuang said.
