Chapter 2130 Forestalling

The last time Jian Wushuang had infiltrated the Three Emperors World with a small team was because they had to. The Dark Millstone was operating and they had to stop it. It was out of necessity.But this time…

Although it would be a surprise attack, there was still a high level of risk involved.

“Relax, even though the risks are high, we have a more comprehensive plan in our hands,” Emperor Bai smiled.

Jian Wushuang started listening attentively.

“Jian Wushuang, The Three Emperors World is different now. They used to have enormous formations to protect themselves, and they had spies monitoring our every move within the Sanctuary Alliance, that was why the enemy knew what you all were doing the previous time.”

“But now, with the Supreme Emperor Stone destroyed, the Three Emperors World no longer has large protective formations to protect themselves. The spies have all been taken off too. You will be able to infiltrate without a trace,” Emperor Bai said.

Jian Wushuang squinted and asked, “Even though that may be true, the Three Emperors World on its own is still very strong. If we want to hurt them badly, we need more Great Emperors, and that will be impossible to hide.”

“That is correct, that is why we need you to hide,” Emperor Bai smiled.

“Me?” Jian Wushuang flinched, before coming to his senses. “You want me to disguise myself, and let the Great Emperors hide within my Chaos Divine Weapon?”

The last time the four experts had managed infiltrated into the Three Emperors World’s core – the Imperial City – Jian Wushuang was only at the Early Stage Chaotic Realm, with the other Great Emperors hiding within his Blood Mountain Sword.

Again, the same move?

“Jian Wushuang, your Chaos Divine Weapon is an outstanding weapon in terms of power and aura concealment abilities. Even I could not tell it was a suppressing-type treasure. If our experts were to hide within it, the other experts would not be able to tell.”

“You can still infiltrate the Three Emperors World’s lair – the Imperial City – easily. Find the best chance and strike. Kill those experts in the shortest time possible. Not just the Great Emperors, but the Emperor Gods, Sir Gods, kill as many as you can.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“I have discussed it with Tian Chen. If you pick a good time, our team will take down hundreds of Almighties within the shortest time, and maybe take down some Great Emperors if we are lucky!” Emperor Bai said solemnly.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were gleaming, trying to process everything.

After a while, he nodded. “Indeed, the Imperial City is the Three Emperors World’s largest congregation of experts, with plenty of Almighties. If I can find a good opportunity, I can make a dent in their forces. But after I’m done, they will naturally send their reinforcements in the shortest time possible. I’ll be in danger by then.”

“Don’t rush,” Emperor Bai waved his hand. “That was just step one. Now, for step two, that’s the most important one.”

“The second step?” Jian Wushuang’s gaze shifted.

“A token, prepared for you,” Emperor Bai handed it Jian Wushuang.

This token was gold from top to bottom, and had an ancient aura to it. Most importantly, it had a boundless Spacetime Power which even Jian Wushuang could not see through.

“Emperor Bai, this is…” Jian Wushuang looked at the golden token curiosity.

“This is a Void Token, discovered by our experts in an ancient battlefield a long time ago. From the creation of the Sanctuary Alliance till now, we have only found one,” Emperor Bai said.

“Only one?” Jian Wushuang flinched. One could only imagine the rarity of this treasure.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

He was familiar with timespace tunnel tokens. They had them at the Eternal Chaotic World.

But those tokens had restrictions: they could only work within the same holy kingdom.

If the other party was in another kingdom, the token would not work.

Those tokens were also contricted by space and time. If a certain spacetime were to be locked up, the token would not work.

But the token Emperor Bai was holding … it ignored spacetime locks and distance.

No matter how far you were, the token would work. No wonder the Sanctuary Alliance could only find one.

Jian Wushuang was certain that the token must have been a rare treasure even in the Ancient Era.

“Jian Wushuang, before your team makes their move, I will gather all the experts from both the Sanctuary Alliance and the Special Tribes Alliance. Once the Three Emperors World reinforcements start to come for you, use the token. We’ll all rush through!” Emperor Bai said solmenly.

Jian Wushuang was taken aback by this plan, but understood completely.

Send a small team of experts to forestall the Imperial City and deal as much damage as possible, then use the Void Token to bring in the rest of the forces to fight the enemy reinforcements.

“You intend to wipe them out in one shot?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Correct, or at least we must damage them severely. We cannot go soft on our sworn enemy, we will make our move once we get the opportunity,” Emperor Bai said coldly.
