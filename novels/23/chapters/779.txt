Chapter 780: The Wilted Leaf

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The wilted, yellowed leaf looked ordinary, but it was actually Jian Wushuang’s strongest trump cards.

He received it from Elder Yi.

Jian Wushuang possessed the Imperial Bloodline, which meant a lot to the Ancient God Clan. Before Jian Wushuang left the Ancient God Palace, Elder Yi was worried that he would face a deadly crisis when fighting with the outsiders, so he gave the lifesaving item to the boy.

This wilted leaf contained the power of Elder Yi’s one finger!

Don’t underestimate the power of one finger. Elder Yi was a true Three-star Ancient God, which was equivalent to a Dao Master for the Human Warriors. Aided by his Ancient God body, he was more powerful than a Dao Master, so the latter had to use his full strength to deal with the elder’s one finger power.

Now, Jian Wushuang’s opponent was only a doppelganger of a Dao Master.

Crack!

He squeezed the wilted leaf and it cracked into pieces.

The mighty power hidden in the leaf was finally activated!

? ? Growl… The terrifying power quickly gathered in the Void, forming a 1,000-feet-tall Gold-armored Ancient God in the blink of an eye.

Although the Gold-armored Ancient God was a spectral image, his mighty aura struck terror into everyone’s heart.

Tian Yunzi was also surprised at the appearance of the giant Ancient God Phantom.

The Gold-armored Ancient God Phantom raised his right arm which was as muscular as a mountain before endless power converged into one of his fingers. The finger radiated gold light suddenly and the Gold-armored Ancient God Phantom pointed at the sky.

The void began rupturing, creating a black hole with a radius of hundreds of feet.

The spatial turbulence which was terrifying enough to shatter everything was tumbling violently inside the Black Hole.

This scene sent a chill down the spectators’ spines.

“This, this is Dao Master’s Power?”

“A Black Hole so big?”

“Gosh!”

Everyone was stunned.

Even Jian Wushuang was shocked. He had sensed how powerful Dao Master was when fighting with Tian Yunzi, but now that he used Elder Yi’s offensive power, he finally realized that Dao Master’s strength was beyond his imagination.

This simple finger had not used any Secret Skills, but its terrifying power still rocked everyone. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

This giant finger was several times stronger than the First Finger of the Ancient God that Jian Wushuang had displayed before. It suddenly appeared in front of Tian Yunzi without giving him any chance to dodge it.

“Shit.” Tian Yunzi’s face darkened.

He realized that it was impossible for him to resist the terrifying power of this finger.

? ? “Looks like I have no other choice.”

Tian Yunzi’s expression darkened. Just when the giant finger was about to touch his body, a figure suddenly appeared in front of the doppelganger, clenched his fists, and threw a violent punch.

Peng!

An earthshaking loud boom was heard before the whole void collapsed.

Huge space rifts extended for 1,000 feet. The Void looked as if it was completely torn apart.

The giant Ancient God Phantom disappeared after releasing the full power of one finger. The wilted, yellowed leaf which had run out of its power fell from the boy’s hand.

The broken space finally regained peace.

At this point, the spectators all fixed their eyes onto the two figures who shared the same figures, appearance, and temperament.

The only difference was that the one who stood in front of the other had a natural mighty aura which was superior to anyone present.

“Two, two Tian Yunzi?”

“This, this is…”

Upon seeing this, all the experts were greatly taken aback.

There would not be two Tian Yunzis for no reason. The one who dealt with Jian Wushuang was his doppelganger, which was the one standing behind.

Hence, the Tian Yunzi who had just withstood the attack from the terrifying finger should be…

“Original Body!

“It’s his Original Body!”

“The Original Body came!”

All the spectators widened their eyes.

Faced with Tian Yunzi’s doppelganger, Jian Wushuang still had an opportunity to fight against him and nearly killed him by employing one of his trump cards. But now, Tian Yunzi’s Original Body showed up?

“Original Body?”

Jian Wushuang looked at Tian Yunzi’s Original Body with a wry smile.

He had used up all his skills and brought out all his trump cards, but he could only kill Tian Yunzi’s doppelganger. But now, he was faced with Tian Yunzi’s Original Body, a true Dao Master.

Even if Jian Wushuang was at his peak, he would not dare to challenge this Dao Master.

Tian Yunzi’s Original Body was dressed in a holy white robe but he looked somewhat pale. Apparently, it was not easy for him to deflect the attack from the giant finger.

“What a powerful strike, it even caused me to suffer a bit.”?Tian Yunzi was deep in thought.?“It only used physical strength and hasn’t displayed any skills. It looks like the finger’s owner is much stronger than me.”

Jian Wushuang spoke. “Tian Yunzi, I didn’t expect that your Original Body was hiding nearby.”

Since Tian Yunzi’s Original Body was able to appear quickly after his doppelganger was dying, he definitely had been somewhere nearby.

Tian Yunzi had been unwilling to personally deal with Jian Wushuang due to his status, so he had dispatched his doppelganger here.

But he had never expected that Jian Wushuang had a trump card that could kill his doppelganger, so he had to show up.

“Humph!”

Tian Yunzi snorted and looked at Jian Wushuang with cold eyes. “My doppelganger may not be good, but it cost me a lot to put it together. I can’t let you destroy it just like this.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded and said with a snicker, “You came here personally, looks like Cloud Sea Asgard really thinks highly of me.”
