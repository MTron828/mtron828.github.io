Chapter 2556: Battle of the Earth Ultimate Gods (1)

“Save your words, let’s fight!!”

Pei Qi roared with his battle blade instantly unsheathed as a powerful blade essence surged.

Broom boom boom~ A wall of divine power swept outwards which shook Heaven and Earth.

Whoosh!

Pei Qi’s body suddenly moved mysteriously and was already standing in front of San Shouwang when he appeared again.

At the same time, his battle blade lashed out three strokes of incredibly sharp fleeting lights that were ruthlessly cutting open the air they passed by.

San Shouwang sneered without moving even half a step. However, there was a ball of terrifying energy gathering in his palm.

Boom!

An assertive barbaric punch burst outward and collided head-on with the three streaks of fleeting lights.

The fleeting lights fell apart with a loud bam as San Shouwang’s huge fist clashed against Pei Qi’s battle blade at a stalemate.

However, an invisible collision wave swept up just as they made contact.

The collision wave expanded outward violently at a terrifying speed.

Broom boom boom~

In an instant, the entire Combat Ring fell into a horrible windstorm as countless pebbles were swept by it.

Jian Wushuang, various clans experts, and those cultivators present stood watching in silence outside the ring.

The audience was unaffected due to the restrictive shield on the ring’s edge blocking the collision waves originating from those incredible explosive powers in the Combat Ring.

However, the observers could still sense the incredible heart-pounding energies from within the Combat Ring.

“They are truly worthy to be called ‘Earth Ultimate Gods’. Just their divine power energy alone is not something a Peak Ultimate God can endure.” Jian Wushuang told himself.

An Earth Ultimate God’s divine was already at least ten times more powerful than a Peak Ultimate God!

What was the concept of being ten times more powerful?

It meant that an Earth Ultimate God could easily crush a Peak Ultimate God with just his divine powers without using any special tactic or Laws.

The gap between an Earth Ultimate God and a Regular Ultimate God was simply too far apart.

Pei Qi and San Shouwang finally separated in the Combat Ring. However, Pei Qi charged forward again in the next instant.

Sharp lights were shining from his eyes and battle blade.

“The Blade of Fleeting Light!”

Splash!

A colorful beam of fleeting light as though pouring from the stars above broke out.

It immediately charged at San Shouwang upon its appearance as its colorful lights caught everyone’s attention.

“What a joke!”

San Shouwang scoffed and grinned upon seeing that and immediately began gathering a surging of energy in his right palm.

Boom!

Another heaven-shattering barbaric punch was released.

Such was San Shouwang’s incredibly barbaric and ruthless style.

It mattered not how beautiful one’s move looked. A punch was all he needed!

If one punch were not enough, then he would release two punches.

Bam!

Another loud collision had slightly shaken San Shouwang’s body but the beautiful fleeting light immediately fell apart at that very instant.

However, a ghastly figure suddenly appeared amidst the fleeting light which was falling apart.

Pei Qi’s eyes were cold and emotionless as killing intent surged violently from his body before stabbing his battle blade forward.

“The Blade of Darkness!”

Ring!

A beam of blacklight flashed like a bolt of dark lightning. It sliced through the void in the blink of an eye and shot right at San Shouwang with terrifying powers.

The blacklight was too fast and close to San Shouwang such that even San Shouwang did not have time to block the attack with his fist from such a short distance.

Bam!

Heaven and Earth were shaken by it as infinite blacklights containing the power to garrotte shrouded the void around San Shouwang and attacked ruthlessly.

“Did he succeed?”

“Don’t tell me His Excellency is defeated...”

The countless cultivators observing outside the Combat Ring widened their eyes.

“It isn’t so easy.” Jian Wushuang intensely frowned.

A brown bear-like figure once again appeared at the same spot after the blacklights dispersed as he expected. San Shouwang remained indifferent with his body covered in a deep purple energy layer that shrouded his entire physique like armor.

The blacklight attacks a moment ago were completely blocked by that deep purple armor.

“That...is the Divine Armor of Destruction!”

“I hear that only when one’s Destruction Law understanding is at an extremely high level could they form an armor merely with Destruction Powers. The formed armor has a terrifying defensive power!”

“His Excellency’s understanding of the Destruction Law is way too profound. Mr. Pei Qi’s attack just now couldn’t even break open his Armor of Destruction despite being so powerful.”

Countless people exclaimed.

So long no one could break the Divine Armor of Destruction apart upon its formation, San Shouwang was practically invincible.

“Pei Qi, your ability has to be a lot higher than this as an Earth Ultimate God. Show me what you’ve got otherwise it’s no fun!” San Shouwang opened his jaw and grinned.

Pei Qi squinted with a serious expression. “As expected, you can’t be killed with normal means. Well then...”

Ring!

Infinite blade essences surged, immediately shrouded the entire Combat Ring, and formed a gigantic Blade World.

Pei Qi had certainly developed his very own Principle World as an Earth Ultimate God and he finally unleashed it at that moment.

Infinite blade essence filled Heaven and Earth with Pei Qi as the master of that particular Principle World.

Jian Wushuang murmured, “He activated his Principle World. Looks like he’s serious this time.”

The many experts around exclaimed in surprise.

They then realized that the battle had only just begun.

“Pei Qi formed his Principle World. The Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord naturally must have formed his own too.” Situ Yuan remarked at the side.

Just as he predicted, another gigantic world had soon been activated after Pei Qi unleashed his Principle World.

It was San Shouwang’s incredibly huge Principle World with its power comparable to Pei Qi’s Blade World in every way.

Both Principle Worlds began clashing in the Combat Ring, but neither could damage the other. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

A violent aura surged from San Shouwang’s body right at that moment as another thick layer of halo burst out over his Divine Armor of Destruction.

San Shouwang’s expression was cold with his extremely frosty eyes.

Boom!

San Shouwang suddenly paced forward as his figure moved.

San Shouwang had only been passively taking Pei Qi’s attacks since the beginning without taking any initiative to attack.

However, he had finally started taking the offensive side.

Unlike before, his power was enough to shake Heaven and Earth as soon as he attacked!

San Shouwang’s expression turned ferocious as the halo which shrouded his body’s surface completely turning him into a vicious beast.
