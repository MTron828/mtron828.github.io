“Are you really just an Eternal Realm expert?”

Upon hearing Dao Master Dreamless’s question, Jian Wushuang smiled helplessly. “I’m indeed at the Eternal Realm, but my Bloodline Power has already reached the Dao Master Level. To be precise, I’m a Dao Master presently.”

Jian Wushuang was telling the truth.

The Inverse Cultivator at the Eternal Realm was regarded as a Dao Master in the Eternal Chaotic World.

His Ancient God Power had reached the Three-star Level. In this aspect, he was on a par with a Dao Master as well.

All this proved that he was qualified to be a Dao Master.

“Really? I assume you cannot be so powerful without other factors.” Dao Master Dreamless sighed with emotion.

After knocking a glass of wine back, Jian Wushuang smiled and asked casually, “Dao Master Dreamless, mighty as you are, you probably are a Rank Eight Reincarnator, right?”

“Yes.” Dao Master Dreamless nodded.

Overjoyed, Jian Wushuang immediately said seriously, “Dao Master Dreamless, to be honest, I persuaded you to stay here because I hope you can do me a favor.”

“Oh?” Dao Master Dreamless raised his eyebrows but he did not feel surprised. “Tell me about it. I’ll do my best if I can.”

Dao Master Dreamless was an amiable man. He relished networking with many people.

He preferred to make contact with experts like Jian Wushuang who was powerful and had great potentials. Normally, he would not refuse if he could assist them.

Jian Wushuang said, “2,000 years ago, one of my close relatives was selected as the Reincarnator by the Samsara Temple, but I haven’t received any message from him until now. That was why I?came here from the Void Continent. I’m looking for him.

“In order to do that, I paid a big price to Jin Yu, a Gold-clothed Deacon, but he failed to find him. Therefore, I have no other choice but to ask a Rank Eight Reincarnator for help.”

“You want me to search for your relative using my powers?” Dao Master Dreamless glanced at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded solemnly. “I’m ready to pay any price as long as you’re willing to help me.”

Dao Master Dreamless frowned.

“Do you have difficulty doing that?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“I’m sorry. I can’t help you with that.” Dao Master Dreamless shook his head.

“Why?” Jian Wushuang’s heart knocked.

“I do want to help you.” Dao Master Dreamless gave a wry smile. “Considering your potential, if you don’t die young, you definitely can become a top-notch person in the Green Fire World. I wish to make friends with you or let you owe me a favor. But I can do nothing on this matter.”

“Jian Wushuang, you may not know that the experts in the Samsara Temple are actually divided into two categories. The first kind is responsible for matters related to the selection of Reincarnators. While the second kind is the Law Executors who’re in charge of removing all obstacles for the Samsara Temple through battles.

“These two types of experts hold different posts. You can also regard them as two main factions. Neither side will intervene in each other’s affairs. As a Heaven-level Law Executor, my job is to fight on the battlefield. I have no control over the information about those Reincarnators and thus cannot aid you.”

“I don’t have the right to do that.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang had a rather surprised look on his face.

He always harbored the idea that as long as he found a Rank Eight Reincarnator, he could look up the information of all Reincarnators below Rank Eight. However, things went contrary to his wishes.

In fact, there were two major factions in the Samsara Temple. The Law Executors were only responsible for fighting outside.

“Jian Wushuang, you should ask Inner Elders for help. They are Rank Eight Reincarnators and are in charge of the selection of Reincarnators. They should be very clear about the information of Reincarnators below Rank Eight.” Dao Master Dreamless said.

“Inner Elder?”?

Jian Wushuang bore this in mind.

“I seldom make contact with them, but I can introduce you the only one I am familiar with.” Dao Master Dreamless added.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes immediately lit up.

Although Dao Master Dreamless could not help him find his father’s whereabouts, it would be very kind of him to introduce him an Inner Elder.

“That Elder named Ding Mo. I’ll send him a message. You just need to take this token to find him in the Divine Monster Territory. That old man has a strange temper, but he ought to do me a favor and meet you. I just don’t know when he plans to meet you.” Dao Master Dreamless continued.

“Thank you a lot.” Jian Wushuang took the token and said appreciatively.

“You’re welcome.” Dao Master Dreamless waved his hand casually. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“By the way, Dao Master Dreamless, I remember you mentioned the Green Fire Palace before. What’s that?” Jian Wushuang asked again.

“Green Fire Palace…” Dao Master Dreamless had the yearning for it written on his face. He murmured, “I just heard about that organization but am not qualified to join it. so, I don’t know much about it either.”

“I just know its the assembly site of top-notch experts in the Green Fire World.”

“It has a high requirement on people who join it. Normally, only when one’s strength reaches the Celestial Master Level can he receive its invitation. Others who’re qualified to join being the rulers of some forces that have power.”

“In other words, 90% of the top-class experts and forces in the entire Green Fire World are its members. The Samsara Temple in the Samsara Continent, the few advanced populations here, the Void Temple in the Void Continent, and the four big countries are all its affiliates.”

Jian Wushuang was taken aback as he heard all this.

“As the overlords of two continents, the Samsara Temple and the Void Temple are just its members!

How terrifying that organization is?”

“Well, what about the Empyrean Patriarch?” Jian Wushuang asked with a solemn face. “According to what you’ve said, almost all of the top-class experts in the Green Fire World are its members. Given his strength, he should be able to join it, right?”

“Of course.” Dao Master Dreamless nodded. “In terms of strength, he’s indeed qualified to join the Green Fire Palace, but it’s a pity that he’s obstinate and unruly. Moreover, he’s always overweening. It’s said that when he broke through to the Celestial Master Level, the Green Fire Palace had invited him, but he directly refused.”

“Refused?” Jian Wushuang looked at Dao Master Dreamless, dumbfounded.

“So many top experts, including the two temples, joined the Green Fire Palace. There must be something special about it. But why did Empyrean Patriarch refuse it?”

“That’s all I know about the Green Fire Palace. Jian Wushuang, if you want to know more, just practice hard. The Green Fire Palace will invite you after you break through to the Celestial Master Level. You’ll understand everything then.” Dao Master Dreamless said.
