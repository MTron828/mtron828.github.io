Chapter 2736: A Fierce Battle

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Boom! Boom!

Hong Chen and Long Xianzi directly took action.

The Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen had an extremely wild aura and the moment his aura came storming outward, his figure also grew three meters tall. He became extremely strong and burly like a small mountain and even had on completely black armor that looked like beasts’ scales. The armor looked extremely cold as it covered his entire body while his burly body came hitting Saber Master ferociously.

An illusory shadow of an extremely huge beast that looked imposing and ferocious also appeared behind him.

Long Xianzi controlled the Golden Light Domain and also came attacking speedily. She appeared beside Saber Master like a ghost as a wave of terrifying aura coagulated on the green spear in her hands as though it was prepared to carry out a fatal attack.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang and Devilish Wind King were only Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods on the surface so they could not rush forward and fight face to face with Saber Master, hence they searched for an opportunity from the side. For example, Jian Wushuang had nine of his Infernal Crimson Divine Swords floating there with all of them combined to form a huge black divine sword.

“Attack!” Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen’s ruthlessness exploded and was the first to appear beside Saber Master as his mountain-like figure went knocking into the latter.

“Humph.” The Saber Master humphed coldly as his combat power was still extremely strong even though he was being suppressed by three parties with his output only at less than 70 percent.

He could be seen suddenly striding forward as he waved the purple battle saber in his hands outward. An overpowering saber-light went sweeping forward with burning purple flames and looked like it intended to burn the entire void down.

Boom!

The humongous purple fire sea slightly shook after Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen knocked into it.

However, the burning temperature in the sea of fire also caused Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen’s facial expression to slightly change as his body came to a direct pause.

Whoosh!

A rotating spear shadow with incomparable strength and power came stabbing toward Saber Master’s head like a dragon coming forth from its lair.

The Saber Master was aware earlier of what was going on. His body slightly trembled before unleashing an attack with his saber which directly sent the spear shadow flying outward and Long Xianzi stumbling backward.

‘What a strong wave of power. He still has such an overpowering force even though he’s being suppressed by three forces?’ Long Xianzi was completely stunned.

However, a black divine sword came rushing towards him like a mountain drill the moment Saber Master fought off Long Xianzi.

The black divine sword not only carried the power of Transmigration Law but also emitted a strong aura of destruction.

The first sword formation of the Transmigration Sword Formation—Heaven’s Edge!

“How dare a firefly to contend with the sun or moon’s brightness!” The Saber Master smiled in disdain as he did not even pull his saber when facing the sword formation. He only slightly moved his body before a huge wave of divine power coagulated into a huge fiery beast in the void ahead of him. The fiery beast managed to send the black divine sword flying with only a forward pounce.

“Great.” Jian Wushuang spoke with uncontrollable admiration, but a smile soon appeared at the corners of his mouth. “Let’s try this then...”

Jian Wushuang’s divine power exploded as the power of Transmigration Law had also been unleashed.

The black divine sword that was sent flying backward suddenly dismantled into nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords amid the void before quickly combining again.

However, the swords did not turn into the black divine sword but became a black blunt object that looked like a huge piece of black-colored wood.

The huge black wood was still in the shape of a sword.

Boom!!

The huge black wood once again attacked Saber Master under Jian Wushuang’s control.

The huge black wood was much slower compared to the black divine sword but had even more terrifying power concealed within it.

The second sword formation of the Transmigration Sword Formation—All Sank!

The Saber Master’s eyes froze when facing the huge black wood and chose to swing his saber at that moment.

Bang!!

Purple flames filled the entire space as the terrifying saber shadow directly knocked into the huge black wood.

A low collision sound could be heard as the huge black wood slightly trembled before it resumed its attacks.

“Hmmm?” The Saber Master’s facial expression darkened. “It looks like I’ve underestimated you. You may have been lucky when you killed Fo Yi as a Peak Heaven Ultimate God but you’re really quite strong. At the very least, the power from this sword formation you’re showing right now is already comparable to ordinary High-level Grand Ultimate Gods.

“Unfortunately, all of you are still very far off if you want to get rid of me using such methods!!” The Saber Master’s voice was so loud that the sky trembled. His body was soon covered in burning purple flames.

At that moment, the dark void around them was completely engulfed in a sea of purple flames.

The purple flames were pounding around madly which caused a certain effect toward Jian Wushuang’s Prison of Punishment and Long Xianzi’s Golden Light Domain.

The Saber Master had also completely erupted. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He swung the purple saber in his hands over and over again. Every wave was accompanied by raging fires and ferocious power. The power of his saber skill was still suffocatingly strong under the three parties’ suppression.

He had transformed into a King of Flames and also a Saber Master. He and his saber alone could sweep and destroy everything in the Heavens and Earth.

Jian Wushuang, Hong Chen, Long Xianzi, and Devilish Wind King who had been looking for an opportunity to attack did not have any advantage despite working together. On the contrary, they were being forced into a disadvantageous position.

“He’s really powerful. He’s truly one of the top three High-level Grand Ultimate Gods in the Danyang Continent. His current show of power is after being suppressed by three parties. We won’t be his opponent even if the four of us work together if his power completely erupted without any suppression,” said Long Xianzi in a low voice.

“Humph, so what if he’s powerful? He has to die if he doesn’t hand over the Interspatial Ring!!” Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen humphed coldly before moving his body and suddenly waved his hand the moment he collided with Saber Master.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Four cold figures suddenly appeared in the void beside them.

Those four figures looked like humans but were cold and lifeless. Apart from that, they had a layer of bronze-colored light covering their body surface.

“These are...Corpse Puppets?” Jian Wushuang’s facial expression changed.

“Four Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets?” Long Xianzi and Devilish Wind King also looked at Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen in surprise.

“Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen, how did you obtain Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets? Could it be...” Long Xianzi’s facial expression changed as she thought of a possibility.

She obtained two Interspatial Rings from the secret realm respectively and got her hands on two special treasures. One of them was the bronze mirror that unleashed the Golden Light Domain.

Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen had also obtained two Interspatial Rings. He might have obtained several Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets from those rings.

“Attack!!” Four Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets appeared in the void as Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen gave an order.

In the blink of an eye, those four Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets immediately attacked Saber Master.
