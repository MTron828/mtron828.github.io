Chapter 1828: Impressive Bad Name

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

One Realm Pearl was a treasure that he had gotten from a unique place during the six thousand years when Jian Wushuang had been wandering in the ancient battlefield.

Although it was a Chaotic Divine Treasure, it was sometimes more useful than a Chaotic Divine Treasure.

One Realm Pearl could form a realm on its own. It only required willpower to activate it and instantly formed a complete space, just like a formation.

In short, it would become formation in one’s will!

For instance, Emperor God Fan Yuan was running away to a far off place, but the moment Jian Wushuang activated One Realm Pearl, it instantly became a complete space and blocked Emperor God Fan Yuan’s way. It didn’t give him any chance to escape.

In the six thousand years, Jian Wushuang searched through many special places on the ancient battlefield and received many opportunities and treasures. One Realm Pearl was merely one of them and it wasn’t even the best treasure.

After Jian Wushuang killed Emperor Fan Yuan, he knew that Blood Mountain Sword broke through and had the power of a Chaotic Divine Treasure.

Jian Wushuang was thrilled.

“The next target, near Holy Kingdom of White Fog…”

Jian Wushuang drove his ancient spaceship to the destination of his next target. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

But he didn’t know that there was a hubbub in Sanctuary Alliance because of him.

Previously, although Jian Wushuang had started a massacre and killed a total of seven Sir Gods, they were Sir Gods after all. The power that Jian Wushuang had displayed wasn’t as ridiculous but then…

Emperor God Fan Yuan and Emperor God Jin Ming, the two experts of Emperor God level had been killed by Jian Wushuang!

Plus, the two Emperor Gods weren’t killed separately by Jian Wushuang but they were together and they had teamed up. In the end, they were still killed by Jian Wushuang brutally.

One should know, they were Emperor Gods!!!

In Eternal Chaotic World, there was only a total of over eighty Emperor Gods. Every one of them was Heaven and Earth Supremes. They were a superb existence but Jian Wushuang had killed two at once.

What was going on?

“This is insane!”

“He can even kill Emperor God experts. Jian Wushuang is too scary!”

“Six thousand years ago, he was barely evenly matched with Emperor God Tian Xiao. After six thousand years, his power has improved to such a level?”

“Emperor God Fan Yuan and Emperor God Jin Ming teamed up but couldn’t flee from Jian Wushuang’s hands. Jian Wushuang’s power should have reached the level of Peak Emperor God if not mistaken!”

“A Real God could be compared favorably with a Peak Emperor God? Emperor Bai wasn’t even that scary back then!”

“Monster! He’s a monster!”

“Jian Wushuang and the other two Hall Masters from Lineage of Star obviously wanted to exterminate everyone who harbored grudges against Lineage of Star. Plus, Jian Wushuang is so strong that he could even kill Emperor God directly. Those that they eye are in big trouble!”

In Sanctuary Alliance, people were in intense discussion.

Everyone made a new evaluation regarding Jian Wushuang’s power based on his battle achievements.

Peak Emperor God!

His fame as Sword Emperor instantly rose to a brand new level!

This fame was an impressively bad name!!

…

Colored Glaze Sanctuary, Soaring Heaven Land.

In an extremely hidden secret room, a purple-robed elderly waited anxiously. Soon, a green-robed young man walked in.

“Haha, Sir God Xuan Bing. Long time no see. Looking as graceful as ever,” the man in the Taoist robe chuckled and said.

“Sir God Qing Fu, you must be joking. How do I still look graceful?” The purple-robed elderly sighed.

Sir God Qing Fu raised his eyebrows. He naturally knew Sir God Xuan Bing’s situation and he laughed and said, “Sir God Xuan Bing, you are quite courageous. A Sword Emperor from Lineage of Star is hunting experts who share great resentment with Lineage of Star. At such a crucial moment, you did not look for a place to hide but came to Colored Glaze Sanctuary instead. Aren’t you afraid that Sword Emperor will come and look for you?”

“I am. Of course I am afraid,” Sir God Xuan Bing replied. “Because I’m afraid, that’s why I seized the time to come and looked for you, Sir God Qing Fu, when Jian Wushuang was still at Sir God Jin Ming’s. As for the purpose of my visit, I hope that Soaring Heaven King Palace can take me in. From today, I will follow Soaring Heaven King Palace’s lead.”

“Oh?” Sir God Qing Fu looked surprised. He had known of Sir God Xuan Bing’s intention long ago but he didn’t point it out. Then, as Sir God Xuan Bing had said it, he replied, “Sir God Xuan Bing, we of Soaring Heaven King Palace came forward to express our intention to be on friendly terms with you long ago. But then, you took a different stance.”

“This…” Sir God Xuan Bing felt bitter.

When Soaring Heaven King Palace had thrown out an olive branch back then, Jian Wushuang had yet to come to Eternal Chaotic World. Although he had harbored deep-seated resentment, only the Master of Star Palace from Lineage of Star had had the capability to kill him. Due to some restraints, the Master of Star Palace wouldn’t come after them on purpose.

Plus, Lineage of Stars hadn’t been this crazy back then.

But now there had been Jian Wushuang’s sudden rise and his terrifying power, and he was only a Real God. Without scruples, as long as he had a reason, he could massacre wantonly. Sanctuary Alliance wouldn’t stop him. The few Sir Gods and Emperor God Jin Ming were only a warning to the others.

Emperor God Jin Ming and Emperor God Fan Yuan were killed. Sir God Xuan Bing, who did he think he was?

Once Jian Wushuang found him, he would definitely be dead.

Hence, he could either flee to some remote Holy Kingdom in Eternal Chaotic World so that Jian Wushuang couldn’t find him, or he could join some major forces and seek refuge.

Sir God Xuan Bing was obviously the latter.

“Sir God Xuan Bing, I know that you have been forced into a corner by Sword Emperor from Lineage of Star. Luckily, Soaring Heaven King Palace is also in an endless fight with Jian Wushuang. As you’re willing to yield to us sincerely, we of Soaring Heaven King Palace will naturally keep you safe. As long as we of Soaring Heaven King Palace announce this, at least when you’re in Colored Glaze Sanctuary, Jian Wushuang definitely won’t dare to touch a single strand of your hair,” Sir God Qing Fu smiled.

“Thank you Sir God Qing Fu,” Sir God Xuan Bing was delighted and he said, “Before I came to see you, I sent a message to Sir God Qian Ren. If Soaring Heaven King Palace is willing to accept, he and I will join Soaring Heaven King Palace together.”

“Haha, even better,” Sir God Qing Fu beamed with joy.

Ever since Jian Wushuang had fought with Soaring Heaven King Palace the last time, they had lost four Sir Gods and their power had diminished drastically. They were thinking of ways to recruit more Sir Gods to join them but now were two Sir Gods who had come to them instead.

Plus, the two Sir Gods, Sir God Xuan Bing and Sir God Qian Ren weren’t weak. Especially Sir God Qian Ren, he was also a top Sir God and he was listed on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

“Jian Wushuang, you probably never expected Soaring Heaven King Palace to be benefiting from your massacre,” Sir God Qing Fu was laughing maliciously from the bottom of his heart.
