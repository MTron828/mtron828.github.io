“Humph, the nine tribulations really have a good plan.”

In the void, a flash of anger appeared on Giant Axe Supreme’s face. He had personally given Jian Wushuang the middle-grade principle divine fruit as a welcome gift, and the nine tribulations actually dared to set their sights on his welcome gift.

In the next moment, he was about to say something to decline the request on Jian Wushuang’s behalf when he saw Supreme Gai Fu, who was standing next to him, glance at him, he said indifferently, “Giant Axe, this trial is between the juniors. How would it look if you interfered?”

Giant Axe’s pupils constricted when he heard that. He then remembered that Ninth Kalpa King had been brought back by Supreme Gai Fu.

Although the senior officials of the Life Palace, including Supreme Gai Fu, had been disappointed by Ninth Kalpa King’s failure to break through to the Supreme realm all these years, if he forcefully interfered in this trial…it would be easy for others to talk about him.

“This...”

After pondering for a moment, he was about to speak when he saw Ruler Blood Wave shake his head slightly.

“Fine.”

He sighed and turned to look at Jian Wushuang outside the trial field. He could only hope that Jian Wushuang would not agree to Ninth Kalpa King’s request.

...

Outside the arena in the Cyan Temple.

“Jian Wushuang, if you lose this trial, give me the middle-grade principle divine fruit that Giant Axe emperor gave you. How about it?” Ninth Kalpa King looked at Jian Wushuang with his hands behind his back and said with a fake smile.

As soon as he said this, there was an uproar among the spectators.

“What a ruthless Ninth Kalpa King. He asked for the middle-grade principle divine fruit that Giant Axe emperor gave to Jian Wushuang!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Tsk, tsk, I’m afraid Ninth Kalpa King has been coveting that middle-grade principle divine fruit for a long time.”

“Hahaha, in my opinion, this trial is fake. It’s only real if you suppress Jian Wushuang and get the principle divine fruit!”

“Now it’s up to Jian Wushuang to agree or not.”

Many eyes fell on Jian Wushuang, waiting for him to make a decision.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes. He was not in a hurry to agree with Ninth Kalpa King. Instead, he asked, “Ninth Kalpa King, if you lose, what will be the reward?”

“I lose?” Ninth Kalpa King sneered. Then, he flipped his right hand and took out two scarlet divine fruits, he said, “If I lose, not only will I give you these two low-grade principle divine fruits, but I will also give you an additional 200,000 origin stones. In total, the value is about the same as your middle-grade principle divine fruit. What do you think?”

Jian Wushuang nodded. Indeed, in terms of value alone, two low-grade principle divine fruits and 200,000 origin stones were about the same as his middle-grade principle divine fruit.

In the next moment.

“I agree,” Jian Wushuang said lightly.

“Hahahaha, Jian Wushuang, you really didn’t disappoint me.” Hearing this, a hint of joy suddenly appeared in Ninth Kalpa King’s eyes.

When Jian Wushuang said ‘I agree’ in the crowd, there was an uproar.

“Stupid!”

“Ninth Kalpa King’s intention to cheat him of the middle-grade principle divine fruit is already so obvious. Jian Wushuang should have seen through it, but he still agreed to the fight even though he knew it?

“Does he really think he can defeat Ninth Kalpa King?

“Jian Wushuang may be talented, but he is too arrogant because of his short cultivation.”

The spectators in the crowd shook their heads, either sighing or mocking.

In the mysterious void where the three Supreme-beings stood.

“Arrogant.”

Seeing that Jian Wushuang agreed to Ninth Kalpa King’s challenge, Giant Axe Supreme snorted and thought to himself out loud, “Little guy, if you lose the middle-grade principle divine fruit, I’ll see where you can cry.”

...

“Jian Wushuang, let’s begin.”

As if afraid that Jian Wushuang would go back on his words, Ninth Kalpa King pressed his palm on a statue outside the trial field.

This statue was the opening passage of the trial field. It was extremely precious and could perfectly duplicate all the divine power and will power of the trial object and condense a Divine Body in the trial field, it guaranteed that the two of them would be in the same realm when they sparred in the trial field.

“Okay.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and pressed his hand on the statue in front of him without hesitation.

A burst of golden light flashed and a crack suddenly appeared in the void of the Cyan Temple.

In the next moment.

Jian Wushuang and Ninth Kalpa King shot their consciousnesses toward the crack.

In the trial field, there was a boundless starry sky.

Ninth Kalpa King’s Divine Body was the first to be condensed. He stepped on the void and his divine power surged.

Then, Jian Wushuang’s Divine Body was also condensed, and waves of sharp sword essence soared into the sky.

“Jian Wushuang, I’m at the same level as you. Don’t say that I’m bullying you.” Ninth Kalpa King smiled coldly. He did not want to say anything more. The divine power in his body suddenly burst out and he took the lead to slap Jian Wushuang.

This palm was made of divine power, and the vast divine power almost crushed the void.

“You want to test the strength of my Divine Power?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. Then he formed a sword with his fingers and slashed out a sword light made entirely of divine power, directly slamming toward Ninth Kalpa King’s palm.

Rumble!

A burst of sound spread out.

Ninth Kalpa King and Jian Wushuang did not use their full strength at the beginning. Jian Wushuang did not take out his divine sword. He just formed a sword with his fingers. It was obvious that he wanted to compete in the strength of divine power.

In terms of the strength of their divine power, both of them were perfect, and they had at least 70 percent of their innate advantages.

The collision...a terrifying power burst out instantly. Then, Ninth Kalpa King’s majestic divine power swept toward Jian Wushuang like a rising tide in the sea.

Facing the surging divine power, Jian Wushuang was like a small boat in a raging sea. No matter how powerful Ninth Kalpa King’s divine power was, he remained unmoving despite looking dangerous.

“Jian Wushuang, are you only good at defense?”

Ninth Kalpa King laughed loudly. The violent divine power was like a storm, slapping Jian Wushuang again and again. Each time, the strength of his divine power was stronger than the last time!

“Ninth Kalpa King, you want to test the strength of my divine power, then I’ll let you have it!”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang did not waste any more time. A cold light flashed in his eyes, and he did not hesitate any longer. The powerful divine power in his body also began to erupt!

Jian Wushuang waved his hand, and a shocking sword rainbow slashed toward Ninth Kalpa King’s head!

The strength of his divine power, which was 8,000 times stronger, suddenly burst out!

Swish!

This sword attack directly defeated all of Ninth Kalpa King’s attacks. Even Ninth Kalpa King could not help but retreat a few steps back.

This retreat immediately showed the difference in the strength of their divine power.

“Eh?”

The Ninth Kalpa King regained his balance, but his face sank, and a flash of shock appeared in his eyes. “This kid’s divine power is actually 8,000 times stronger than mine?”
