Chapter 3060: Monsters Among Monsters

_________

Silence!

The whole world was silent.

Mountain King, Mirage Water, and the evil master stood side by side, staring at Jian Wushuang with their eyes wide open. They saw Jian Wushuang merge the Evil God Venom into his longsword, they knew that Jian Wushuang had the strength to kill them.

Jiu Luo and the False Saints were also stunned.

“Sir, we are from the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces,”Mountain King said immediately.

“The Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces again?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Since he came from the endless territory, he had met several geniuses from the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces.

Jian Wushuang had long known that the three people in front of him must be from a powerful force with an extraordinary background. He did not expect them to be from the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces.

“The Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces are divided into the Heaven and Earth Palace, the Primitive Palace, and the Chaos Palace. Which palace are you from?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The Primitive Palace. The three of us are from the Primitive Palace,” Mountain King said directly.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and was not surprised.

These three people were obviously much stronger than Xue Yu, Long Yun, and Qian Chen, whom he had met before. However, they were not ridiculously strong. They should not be the super geniuses of the Chaos Palace. The geniuses of the Primitive Palace suited their identities.

“I’ve long heard that there are many monsters in the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. The geniuses of the Primitive Palace are the best among the monsters. I’ve witnessed it today.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly, but he had already put away the Blood Mountain Sword. “You three didn’t kill us directly just now, so I’ll let you live.”

After saying that, Jian Wushuang looked at Jiu Luo and said, “Jiu Luo, let’s go.”

Jian Wushuang turned around and left.

Jiu Luo and the other false saints had also recovered from their shock. They looked at the three of them in amazement and then left with Jian Wushuang.

The three of them stood in the same place without any intention of stopping him.

As for wiping out part of their memories, it was naturally impossible.

Soon, Jian Wushuang and the others had disappeared from Mountain King and the other two. Mountain King and the other two were still standing there. They looked very excited and could not calm down for a long time. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After a while, the evil master was the first to speak. “Mirage Water, you are good at the soul and have the best sensing ability. Did the man just now disguise his divine power aura, or is he really a rank one True Saint?”

Mountain King immediately looked at Mirage Water.

But Mirage Water shook her head slightly. “I didn’t sense any signs of him hiding his aura. At least from what I see, he is indeed just a first level True Saint.”

“If even you can’t tell, then this person is most likely a first level True Saint. But they are both first level True Saints, how can he be so strong?” The evil master said in shock.

Mountain King and Mirage Water were also shocked.

Yes, too strong!

“The three of us are all from the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, and we’re all top geniuses of the Primitive Palace. Even in the vast Divine Beginning Realm, our talent is definitely the best, and the most terrifying. Even if we encounter the monsters of the Chaos Palace…”

“In this era, there are only two monsters of the Chaos Palace who are still at the first level True Saint. I’ve fought with one of them before. Although that person’s strength is terrifying and is much stronger than mine, I feel that if we work together with the evil master, we should be able to fight. If we add Mirage Water, the three of us working together can even completely suppress that genius of the Chaos Palace!”

“But today, the three of us met a cultivator who was also only at the first level True Saint Realm. The three of us combined our full strength, and in the end… We were completely defeated?” Mountain King muttered.

Mirage Water’s expression was solemn. “His soul is extremely tough, and his soul defense ability is also extremely strong. The soul attack that I used with all my strength did not have the slightest effect on him. Even when I used my strongest ultimate move, the starry sea realm, he was able to break it in an instant. His willpower is terrifyingly strong!

“His strength is also ridiculously strong. When he fought you head-on, he smashed you to the ground with one sword strike!

“His speed is even faster than before. As expected, his comprehension of the space-time principles has reached the third stage, and his sword arts are even more tyrannical. In just one exchange, that sword arts completely crushed the evil master, and even crushed the evil master’s divine body on the spot..

“His speed, strength, and soul are all incredible, and I don’t feel any weakness in his body. I even felt that he was holding back when he fought with us. In other words, he didn’t use his full strength!”

“This man is too terrifying!”

“Terrifying!!”

That was what Mirage Water thought of Jian Wushuang.

Mountain King and the evil master thought the same.

“If a genius of the Chaos Palace is a monster in the Divine Beginning World, then that man should be a monster among monsters. Even the monsters in the Chaos Palace are inferior to him,” Mountain King said.

“From the direction he’s flying and the team he’s with, he should have rushed over from the endless territories. He’s currently forming a team to pass through the white bone region. Such an inconceivable monster actually appeared in the endless territories?

“Who exactly is he?” The evil master was curious.

“No matter who he is, since we’ve met him today, then we can’t pretend that we didn’t see him. We must immediately report this matter to the higher-ups,” said Mountain King.

“Yes, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance has a rule. It’s a great reward to introduce some top geniuses to the Three Palaces. As for the man just now, he’s an incredible monster. Once he joins the Three Palaces, the three of us will get a lot of benefits. By the way, we forgot to ask his name,” said the evil master.

Although they had just fought with Jian Wushuang, they had not asked his name.

“I heard the True Saint in their team call him Brother Heavenly Marquis. He should be called Heavenly Marquis, right?” Mirage Water asked.

“I think so.” Mountain King nodded. “It’s impossible for a monster like him to be completely traceless. As long as we report his name, it should be easy for the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to find out his background. Let’s leave this place quickly.”

Soon, the three geniuses left.

The three of them had come to the bone region to carry out a special mission of the Primitive Palace. It had nothing to do with Jian Wushuang. It was because Jian Wushuang happened to see them when they attacked the stronghold of the Blood Crow Organization, in order not to leak the news, they fought with Jian Wushuang.

However, they did not expect that such a freak would appear in this fight.

After the three of them left, they immediately reported what happened here to the higher-ups of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces.
