Chapter 363: Slaughter Experts of the Saint Realm

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Clang!

A metallic sound rang out.

The blue-robed woman was suddenly stunned.

Many spectators, including the four Holy Masters, also froze in shock.

Jian Wushuang directly grabbed the blade of the cyan longsword, which contained the full power of 18 experts.

Despite the overwhelming power of the longsword, Jian Wushuang held the blade tightly. The longsword was a second-grade magic weapon, but it could not even seem to hurt Jian Wushuang.

“How, how is that possible?”

Everyone was dumbstruck.

The whole area became silent.

“How it could be?”

The blue-robed woman widened her eyes and stared at Jian Wushuang. Then a hint of coldness flashed in her eyes.

“Go to hell!”

A sudden surge of energy was emitted from the cyan longsword, which then changed into sharp spines and shot towards Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was a bit surprised, but he just closed his eyes and let the spines crash against his body.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

The continuous crashes resounded through the air. Each spine could easily kill an ordinary Saint Realm expert, but they did not work against Jian Wushuang. His body was like an indestructible gem, so the collision just caused sparks to fly in all directions.

“This...” The blue-robed woman was completely petrified.

The sword strike she had performed with her full strength had been caught by Jian Wushuang using only a single hand.

Now, the countless spines did not even puncture his skin.

“That boy!” Second Holy Master was shocked.

He still remembered when he tried to kill Jian Wushuang. After the boy’s strength suddenly erupted, he could barely prick the boy’s skin with his strongest move, Scarlet Thunderbolt.

Such a powerful body!

It was indestructible!

While the blue-robed woman was in a daze, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and glanced at the woman. Then he quickly stretched out his left arm, grabbed the woman’s neck, and raised her up.

“I, I...” The blue-robed woman was terrified. Her neck was currently being grasped by Jian Wushuang so tightly that she felt as if her strength was of no use and she was completely unable to resist.

As Jian Wushuang exerted more strength...

Crack!

The blue-robed woman’s neck broke and her breath instantly disappeared. Then her body was tossed onto the ground below.

When the woman died, the Aeon Devil-killing Formation began to collapse.

Force of Gale and Thunderbolt began to surge inside Jian Wushuang’s body. Shua! He moved so fast that no one could see his body.

They all watched a lightning pass by two experts of the Saint Realm.

Then, Jian Wushuang reappeared with the Triple-kill Sword in his hand, scarlet blood dripping from his sword.

The two experts of the Saint Realm widened their eyes as blood began dripping from the sword scar left on both of their necks.

Shua!

Then Jian Wushuang easily flashed by three other Saint Realm experts, killing them before they even had an opportunity to struggle.

Shua! Shua!

Lightning emerged and flashed through the air.

Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!

The sound of bodies being cut was heard in quick succession, striking terror in their hearts.

“Run!”

A forlorn cry came out. Then, the surviving Saint Realm experts started running back, towards Holy Emperor Palace, in panic.

“Asshole!”

Shocked and angry, First Holy Master let out a snarl and moved forward.

Boom!

He launched an attack, his huge palm print covering the whole sky.

“Hum?”

Jian Wushuang, who was hunting these experts of Holy Emperor Palace, raised his head and immediately flashed through the huge palm, splitting it in two.

This attack gave several experts enough time to run toward the four Holy Masters and escape death. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

In the blink of an eye, among the 18 Saint Realm experts who made up Aeon Devil-killing Formation, 13 experts were killed and only 5 survived.

Silence!

The whole area became silent at this moment.

Countless experts and a large number of young Warriors watched in shock as a dozen Saint Realm experts fell from the sky.

They all widened their eyes and felt terrified.

“Too, too strong!” A young warrior could not help but speak.

This caused the whole Holy Emperor Island to become heated.

“Of the 18 experts, 13 were killed!”

“Were they really experts of the Saint Realm?”

“Legendary experts of the Saint Realm were killed so easily? Just like...a rooster being killed!”

A year ago, when Jian Wushuang reached Venerable Master, he cut off the legs of Second Holy Master with a single stroke. His battle strength had been far superior to an ordinary Saint Realm expert.

Over the past year, he had obtained great opportunities in the Ancestor’s Land and reached Pinnacle of the Saint Realm. His battle strength had improved greatly. With the help of his perfect body and Heavenly Creation Skill, he could kill a Saint Realm expert who mastered Domain as easily as butchering a rooster.

The Aeon Devil-killing Formation was really powerful, but once it collapsed, it was easy for Jian Wushuang to kill them.

“This is the number one genius on the Nanyang Continent, Jian Wushuang!”

“His battle strength is too terrifying!”

“He is much stronger than an expert of the Saint Realm, and even the four Holy Masters. I’m afraid that, on the Nanyang Continent, only the mysterious Monarch of the Tang Dynasty could defeat him. Holy Emperor Palace is in danger this time!”
