Chapter 2174 Frenzy under the Crimson Ligh

The sudden change of events rocked the entire Three Emperors World.“What is happening?”

“The sky turned red!”

“Crimson Light covers the sky, this is not a good sign.”

Countless Three Emperors World cultivators looked up towards the sky.

The sky was completely blanketed in a layer of crimson light, as if it were wearing a red robe.

The Crimson Light was extremely seductive as well.

Within the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds.

“The chap’s Crimson Light covered the entire Three Emperors World?”

“What is this Kaiser Blood thinking?” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

The Eternal Chaotic World army had purged a bulk of the Three Emperors World, but many of their experts remained to watch what had happened.

He knew first-hand about the Crimson Light covering the entire Three Emperors World.

Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang’s faces were darkened at the sight of it.

They were increasingly uneasy.

For that Kaiser Blood, with that devious smile of his, no one knew what he was thinking.

“Haha, the slaughter commences,” Kaiser Blood said coldly.

Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

The two of them looked around their surroundings but did not notice any difference.

But somewhere within the Three Emperors World…

At a village deep in the mountains of a normal domain.

.

A braided girl, aged around eleven or twelve, was staring at the sky above her.

“Daddy, look, the sky changed colour, it changed colour,” the little girl said.

A plain-robed, middle-aged man walked out of the hut behind the girl, puzzled by what she was looking at.

“What is this?” the middle-aged man murmured. His gaze started to change.

At that moment, the girl beside him turned and bit the man’s torso.

The middle-aged man could not avoid it; a chunk of his flesh was bitten off.

“Hong-er, what are you doing?” the middle-aged man shouted in pain.

And then he realised – his daughter’s face was completely twisted. Her bright eyes were no more, for they had turned bloodshot, full of mania. She pounced on the middle-aged man once again.

As if she had lost her mind.

The middle-aged man’s pupils were turning crimson red as well. Not long after, the man started fighting to the death with his daughter.

Soon, he had killed the girl with his own bare hands.

Afterwards, the frenzied man pounced on others.

He had lost his mind.

And it was not just him. The entire village had lost their minds.

They were slaughtering each other.

They had completely lost their sanity, slaughtering everyone at sight.

The once peaceful village was now bleeding.

At another prosperous domain.

The domain contained many many families, the strongest of them was the Duan Mu family.

The Duan Mu family had many experts – almost twenty Chaotic Realm experts. But as the battle between the Eternal Chaotic World erupted, the Chaotic Realm experts had all lost. All that remained were the Real Gods and Sector Gods.

Even the Chaotic Real Gods were gone due to the Eternal Chaotic World’s raid.

The experts of most families were now generally Eternal Real Gods.

Despite that, the Duan Mu family was still regarded as the king of the domain.

At that very moment, the Real Gods of the Duan Mu family had gathered to watch the sky above.

“Something’s wrong,” the purple-robed elder murmured.

The purple-robed elder was a pinnacle Eternal Real God, now considered the strongest within the family.

“Not the sky, something’s wrong with that crimson light,” another Eternal Real God beside him murmured.

Suddenly…

“My lord!”

“My lord!” A panicked Void Real God rushed over.

The Void Real God’s eyes were bloodshot.

“What happened?” the purple-robed elder frowned.

“My lord, the clan is in a mess! The disciples have started slaughtering one another, many of them are already dead,” the Void Real God said.

“What?” the purple-robed elder and others were taken aback.

“Come, let’s go see!” he said. But by the time the purple-robed elder reached the scene, he drew a cold breath.

Duan Mu family was in a bloodbath!

Countless disciples, including the servants, were engaged in the slaughter.

The slaughter saw no friend nor foe – everyone was simply killing one another. There were several Duan Mu disciples that charged towards them as well.

“They’ve all gone mad!” the purple-robed elder was bawling. His eyes were turning red as well. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

At that moment, the Void Real God that had delivered the message had turned as well. Without hesitation, he charged towards the elder.

“Damn it!” the purple-robed elder had made his move as well.

As the Duan Mu family Real Gods entered the battle, the slaughter only turned more intense.

All the Duan Mu family Real Gods had fallen, including the purple-robed elder.

They were surrounded by endless slaughter.

It did not just happen to the Duan Mu family, but every single corner of the Three Emperors World.

The crimson light covered the entire Three Emperors World.

Under the crimson light, every single domain and cultivator under the Three Emperors World had lost their sanity and joined in the slaughter.

The Crimson Light was glaring, which made it even more attractive.

The Three Emperors World, under the Crimson Light, had instantly turned into a hell on earth!
