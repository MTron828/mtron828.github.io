—

“Die!”

Blacklight Master roared, and the three Principles Masters instantly attacked.

The three terrifying auras instantly reached their limits. Blacklight Master took the lead, and his body was covered in endless darkness. It was as if his entire body had merged into the darkness, this endless darkness transformed into a gigantic dark beast that crazily devoured everything. The two people beside him were experts at the fourth level of the void, and they were even stronger than the Blacklight Master! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The eyes of the beautiful woman with snow-white long hair suddenly turned ghastly white. She gently raised her jade-like hand, and a devilish purple soft sword appeared in her hand. Then, she simply slashed out, the space was sliced apart like a piece of paper. In an instant, a chill swept through the sky, and the entire world turned into a world of ice and snow.

In this world of ice and snow, a cold sword shadow directly slashed toward the Demon Master Chenhuo.

The last person was originally over three meters tall, but at this moment, his body expanded once again, instantly reaching a height of thirty meters. The hair on his body expanded explosively as if he had turned into a true ancient fierce beast…the ancient ferocious beast roared and waved a huge axe in its hand.

The axe shadow descended majestically as if it could smash all obstacles in front of it into pieces.

The three Principles Masters did not make a move, but when they did, the terrifying power and movements caused the entire Wu Xin City to instantly sink into terror.

“Too strong, this is the Principles Master!”

“Three Principles Masters attacking at the same time. This scene is too terrifying.”

“I feel like this day is about to be defeated by these three Principles Masters. Even though I’m standing very far away, I still feel like I’m going to be killed at any moment. The Principles Masters are indeed extraordinary.” Countless cultivators were discussing in Wu Xin city.

Although there were many more experts in the Third Heaven than in other places, those who had reached the level of Principles Masters were still considered top-notch experts in the Third Heaven. and for a small Wu Xin City…the Principles Masters were legendary existences that were rarely seen on normal days.

But now, not only did they see the Principles Masters, but they also saw three law masters attacking at the same time. This was the first time for many cultivators in Wu Xin City to see such a scene.

“Haha, three Principles Masters attacking at the same time, and one of them is at the third level of the Void Realm and two at the fourth level of the Void Realm. With such a lineup…I want to see what this person can use to block it.” Zhao Yong stood at the edge of the battlefield, looking at the scene in front of him, his expression was extremely excited.

“Is this the true strength of the Principles Masters? They are too terrifying.” In the tavern, Zhao Mang and Zhao Ling were also amazed. Zhao Mang was more worried than amazed. “These three Principles Masters are so terrifying. can master withstand them?”

Zhao Mang was worried about Demon Master Chenhuo, but Jian Wushuang, who was sitting next to him, was still leisurely drinking wine. His expression did not change at all, as if the power of the three Principles Masters outside the tavern burst out in an instant, it was as if he did not care about them at all.

And it was true.

Not only did he not care about the three Principles Masters, but Demon Master Chenhuo was even more disdainful.

Sure enough, after the three Principles Masters made their moves, Demon Master Chenhuo also made his move directly.

There was no need for Demon Master Chenhuo to use his full strength to deal with a mere void third realm and two void fourth realm experts. He did not even use a divine weapon or true treasure. He just waved his hand and then flipped his palm. With a flip of his hand, a power that suffocated everyone present suddenly erupted.

Hong!

The world trembled, and this power instantly charged at the attacks of the three Principles Masters.

The expressions of the three Principles Masters changed drastically at this moment.

“This is…” Blacklight Master’s eyes widened.

“Be careful!” The beautiful woman with long snow-white hair immediately let out a fierce shout and immediately unleashed her strongest power.

However, even so…

Rumble ~~~

The three Principles Masters’ attacks instantly collapsed.

The darkness around the Blacklight Master was scattered and retreated. His entire body flew backward like a kite with a broken string. While he was retreating, his divine body had already begun to collapse.

The snow-white long-haired beauty had also disappeared. The ice and snow around her had also disappeared. Her sword shadow had also been destroyed. At the moment the power swept over, she immediately spat out blood, more than half of her divine body was instantly destroyed.

Finally, the middle-aged man who had turned into a thirty-meter-tall ancient beast let out crackling sounds. All the bones and muscles in his body exploded, and his divine body also quickly collapsed.

In the blink of an eye, two of the three Principles Masters’ divine bodies collapsed on the spot, and the other one’s body had also collapsed by more than half!

And this was completed with just a flip of the Demon Master’s hand.

Silence!

The entire world had fallen completely silent. It was completely silent!

In Wu Xin City, countless cultivators widened their eyes and watched everything with incredulous expressions.

In the tavern, Zhao Mang and Zhao Ling also had incredulous expressions.

Of the three Principles Masters of the Illusionary Moon Sect, one was at the third level of the Void Realm, while the other two were at the fourth level of the Void Realm. With such a powerful lineup attacking at the same time, the terrifying might earlier had frightened everyone, previously, everyone had been amazed at how powerful these three Principles Masters were.

However, in the blink of an eye, these three Principles Masters had been completely defeated.

They had been defeated with a flip of their hands, and it was a miserable defeat!

Everyone was shocked by this scene, and it took them a long time to calm down.

If there was one person who was not surprised by this scene, it was Jian Wushuang. He knew the strength of Demon Master Chenhuo very well. To be honest, the three Principles Masters of the Illusionary Moon Sect…even he did not care about them, let alone Demon Master Chenhuo.

In the void at the center of Wu Xin City, the three Principles Masters of the Illusionary Moon Sect had gathered together again.

The three of them stood side by side, staring at Demon Master Chenhuo with unprecedented fear and shock in their eyes.

“Just now, I lost more than 50% of my divine power!” Blacklight Master said in a low voice.

“I’m still fine. I only lost 30%,” the three-meter-tall middle-aged man said. “I lost a little more than 10%,” the snow-white long-haired beauty also said.

The three of them looked at each other. Huge waves had already been stirred up in their hearts.

With a flip of his hand, he had defeated the three of them and caused them to lose so much of their godly power. The other party’s strength…
