Before Jian Wushuang left, the Tang Emperor, Emperor Xiao and Yang Zaixuan were already at a level higher than that of a Dao Master. They had a long lifespan and they would definitely not die a normal death in just tens of thousands of years.

Since that was the case, there was only one possibility. They were killed by someone else.

“Who was it!?” Jian Wushuang looked at Wang Yuan with his eyes filled with hatred to the point that they were about to crack.

Wang Yuan’s expression had a ghastly pale expression and he only spoke after a long time, “The people who killed Second Brother, Elder Tang Emperor and Emperor Xiao, were the thirteen Devil Bloods!”

“The thirteen Devil Bloods?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes slightly. When he was still in the Green Fire World back then, he had never heard of the thirteen Devil Bloods.

“Old Three, please calm down. I will fill you in slowly,” Wang Yuan said.

Jian Wushuang suppressed his fury and murderous intent forcefully to calm himself down so that he could listen to Wang Yuan.

“I have just told you. After you left, the Green Fire World underwent a great change where an unending stream of experts were born. Second Brother is extremely talented and he is only inferior to you among the four of us. As for Elder Tang Emperor and Emperor Xiao, they were the earliest batch of experts and their abilities rose the most. Moreover, as the Green Fire World had just experienced a great battle with the Jin Kingdom, many experts were extremely united. Hence, at the start, everything was going in the right direction.”

“However, thousands of years ago, the Green Fire World underwent a great change and the thirteen Devil Bloods appeared…”

“There is a total of thirteen people in the thirteen Devil Bloods and they did not have any reputation in the past. After they appeared, they fought all the way into Tang of the East. Tang of the East had long been the Green Fire World’s first country and its abilities were extremely powerful. Moreover, with the Second Brother, the Tang Emperor, Emperor Xiao and other similar experts keeping watch, Tang of the East was rightfully impregnable. However, in the end, Tang of the East was massacred by the thirteen Devil Bloods easily.

“In the end, Elder Tang Emperor, Emperor Xiao and Second Brother were killed by the thirteen Devil Bloods. At the same time, the whole Tang of the East was completely occupied by the thirteen Devil Bloods.”

“The movements of the thirteen Devil Bloods were too fast. They were so fast that even the Green Fire Palace was unable to react. After that, the thirteen Devil Bloods created a Devil Church and looked for believers wantonly. With that, their abilities got stronger day by day.”

“Could it be that the Green Fire Palace allowed the Devil Church to continue getting stronger?” Jian Wushuang asked with a low voice.

“Of course not. Before Tang of the East underwent the great change, the Green Fire Palace stepped in. However, it was useless as the thirteen Devil Bloods were too strong,” Wang Yuan said bitterly.

Many people beside him also could not help but lower their heads.

“Too strong?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes shrank.

“They are really too strong. Among the thirteen Devil Bloods, none of them are someone who the Green Fire Palace can compete with. For example, currently, the strongest person in the Green Fire Palace is your father, Palace Master Jian Nantian. However, even if it were him, he would be completely helpless when he comes across the thirteen Devil Bloods,” Wang Yuan said.

Jian Wushuang could not help but look at his own father.

Jian Nantian was a proud person and he considered himself the best in the world. However, as he listened to Wang Yuan, he nodded his head.

It was obvious that he acknowledged that fact.

“Before the gap in terms of abilities, even if the Green Fire Palace wanted to take revenge for Second Brother, Elder Tang Emperor and Emperor Xiao, what can we do?” Wang Yuan sighed lightly.

“Abilities, right?” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists and his eyes were filled with murderous intent. “I will avenge Second Brother, Elder Tang Emperor and Emperor Xiao!”

“Boss Wang Yuan, where is the base of the Devil Church?” Jian Wushuang had already stood up.

“Old Three, don’t be reckless,” Wang Yuan stopped Jian Wushuang right away.

“Shuang’er,” Jian Nantian also frowned.

“It’s useless. The thirteen Devil Bloods are really too powerful. According to Dan Xin’s predictions, the thirteen Devil Bloods have already achieved the level of a Real God. Moreover, they are not normal Real Gods. Even when placed in the vast Eternal Chaotic World, any one of them would be considered a first-class expert, let alone the thirteen Devil Bloods teaming up.”

Wang Yuan sighed lightly, “Old Three, I know that you are filled with sorrow and that you wish to avenge Second Brother and the rest of them. All of us wish to do so as well. However, no matter how much we want to avenge them, we cannot send ourselves to our deaths!”

“Send ourselves to our deaths? They are merely trash, what right do they have to kill me?” Jian Wushuang laughed disdainfully.

“Old Three, they are Real Gods,” Wang Yuan said in an imperative tone.

Everyone by the side also looked at Jian Wushuang.

They had gotten some information from the ancient battlefield nearby and they knew that the Pure Sun Realm, which was also the Real God Realm, was after the Universe God Realm.

With regards to Real Gods, they also had some knowledge about them. Real Gods were super experts.

For example, for a Universe God of the Second Heaven like Jian Nantian, the weakest Real God could kill hundreds upon hundreds of him with a flip of his palm.

In the current Green Fire World, Real Gods were invincible.

Upon hearing Wang Yuan’s words, Jian Wushuang laughed although he was extremely furious, “Haha~~~ Real Gods, bullshit!!!”

“Forget about Real Gods. Even if an Almighty at the level of a Sir God or Emperor God were to kill my brothers, I would want him dead as well!!!”

Jian Wushuang’s words caused everyone present to be shocked.

From Jian Wushuang’s words, they could also tell that Jian Wushuang seemed to not spare a glance for Real Gods.

“Old Three, you are able to kill Real Gods?” Wang Yuan opened his eyes wide and asked.

Jian Nantian, Su Rou and the rest of the people also looked at Jian Wushuang in succession.

“Hmph, Real Gods… in the years that I have travelled in the Eternal Chaotic World, I have already killed so many Real Gods that I have lost count of them. Even Almighties, who are above Real Gods, I have also killed more than five of them. For these thirteen Devil Bloods or whatever they are called, even if they were top Chaotic Real Gods, it would be easy for me to kill them,” Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice.

Upon hearing that, everyone was first stunned. After that, they were over the moon.

Wang Yuan cried tears of joy, “That’s great. That’s great, Old Three. We must avenge them. You must really avenge Second Brother!!!”

“Old Three, Old Two cannot die for nothing!” Su Rou also said earnestly.

“Kill all of them. Destroy the thirteen Devil Bloods!!”

“The thirteen Devil Bloods had done all kinds of evil. For many years, the whole Green Fire Palace has been crushed under their feet and we only dared to be furious but not say anything. If not for us controlling the Great Spacetime Formation nearby which caused the thirteen Devil Bloods to be worried, they would have gone on a killing spree and killed all of us a long time ago. And now… kill! Kill! Kill!”

“They have to die!”

Everyone in the area unleashed shocking murderous intents in succession.

In the Green Fire World, countless cultivators hated the thirteen Devil Bloods to the bone. However, they suffered from a lack of abilities.

However, at that time, Jian Wushuang… the savior who had turned things around with his power alone at the critical moment back then in the great battle with the Jin Kingdom, had returned!

This had allowed them to see hope.

Just then…

“Eh?” Jian Nantian’s expression changed abruptly.

“What’s wrong?” Jian Wushuang looked at Jian Nantian.

“The people from the Devil Church have come to our doorstep,” Jian Nantian said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold at once.
