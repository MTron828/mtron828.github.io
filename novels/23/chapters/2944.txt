Chapter 2945: Beheading

——

From the battle between Jian Wushuang and Jin Shi, he could see that Jian Wushuang’s basic divine power, comprehension of rules, and even the creation of absolute arts were inferior to Jin Shi’s. The reason why he could confront Jin Shi head-on was that the point is that his understanding of Sword Dao was too high.

With a high understanding of swordsmanship, the power of his swordsmanship would naturally skyrocket. To be able to match Jin Shi, Jian Wushuang’s boundless sword tree should be about 30,000 feet tall.

And her judgment was spot on.

Jian Wushuang’s boundless sword tree was 33,000 feet tall, but it was not because his understanding of the sword principle was too high.

He had just bred the boundless sword tree not long ago, but because his physique was different, his starting point was too high.

Many people had only grown the boundless sword tree to the limit of 33,000 feet, but once he gave birth to the boundless sword tree, it was 33,000 feet tall.

Although his comprehension of the sword principle was not very high, when the 33,000-feet-tall boundless sword tree was activated, the power of his swordsmanship increased.

“A mere Divine Master’s comprehension of the sword principle is actually so high. It’s simply unbelievable. In addition, he is also extremely outstanding in other aspects. All in all, he definitely has the qualifications to enter the Heaven and Earth Palace of our Heaven-cleaving Alliance. If his comprehension of the rules were to improve slightly, it would not be a problem for him to enter the Primitive Palace,” said Yao Yu.

“Haha, I think so too. With his current strength, he can barely enter the Primitive Palace. I didn’t expect that you and I could meet such a genius just because we went on a mission out of boredom. The Primitive Palace, even you and I are only members of the Heaven and Earth Palace. There is still some distance to go before we can enter the Primitive Palace. As for the Heavenly Sword Marquis…” The purple-haired young man did not finish his words.

“Don’t worry. Let’s wait and see. I have a feeling that Heavenly Sword Marquis hasn’t gone all out,” Yao Yu said.

“He hasn’t gone all out?” The purple-haired young man’s expression changed, and he immediately looked at the mirror image in front of him.

In the mirror image, it was in Black Dragon Mountain.

Bang!

With a loud bang, Jian Wushuang and Jin Shi were both pushed back.

Jin Shi’s aura was cold, and his eyes were burning with anger. He stared at Jian Wushuang, but he was also shocked.

“A Divine Master is so strong?”

Jin Shi was indeed shocked.

He now believed that Jin Shan had indeed died at the hands of this Divine Master.

Because this Divine Master’s battle strength was definitely comparable to an ordinary Peak False Saint.

“Your strength is not bad. You are much stronger than Jin Shan. You are a good opponent to train your swordsmanship.” Jian Wushuang held his sword with one hand and looked at Jin Shi with a faint smile.

“Train your swordsmanship?” Jin Shi’s expression changed. “Do you think I’m your opponent to train your swordsmanship?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang smiled. “Unfortunately, your strength is still weak and you can’t really put pressure on me. The effect of the training is minimal. In that case, I don’t need to waste time with you. I’ll kill you directly.”

“Kill me directly? How arrogant!” Jin Shi snorted with disdain in his heart.

Jian Wushuang did not waste any more words. His body shook, and immediately majestic golden divine power began to gather crazily behind him.

In the blink of an eye, a 30,000-meter-tall Golden Emperor Phantom appeared behind him.

The seven-star secret skill and the nine luminaries star armor were immediately used.

In just a moment, Jian Wushuang had used all three of his secret skills, and his battle strength had soared to a whole new level!

In the outside world, when he fought with Xue Dong King, who had also reached the peak of the pseudo-saint realm and was infinitely close to the True Saint realm, he had only used the seven-star secret skill to gain the upper hand.

But now, he had used all three secret skills at the same time.

“As expected, Heavenly Sword Marquis still has some tricks up his sleeve!

“His aura has improved a lot. I feel that he is much stronger than before.”

In the tower outside the enchantment, the purple-haired young man and Yao Yu’s pupils shrank when they saw this scene.

As for Jin Shi, although he felt that Jian Wushuang’s aura had improved greatly, he did not pay much attention to it. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Boy, no matter what, you are only a Divine Master. I don’t believe that you can really overturn the heavens!” Jin Shi shouted. Golden Light burst out from his body, and in an instant, he turned into a huge golden beast and crazily attacked Jian Wushuang.

Before he got close to Jian Wushuang, the shocking evil aura swept over him.

Looking at the crazy Jin Shi, Jian Wushuang just smiled faintly and waved his sleeve.

Streams of black light burst out instantly.

These black streams of light were 18 underworld blood divine swords with astonishing auras!

As soon as the 18 underworld blood divine swords appeared, they immediately merged perfectly with Jian Wushuang’s control at the fastest speed.

Buzz!

A faint humming sound, like the sound of a sword, slowly sounded in the world.

Although the sound was not loud, it was extremely strange. In the void, a brand new black divine sword that was only two meters long but extremely wide appeared out of thin air.

The moment this two-meter-long black divine sword appeared… Buzz buzz buzz buzz… the surrounding world suddenly turned gray.

This gray-white seemed to have fallen into a boundless sea of snow, and everywhere was a vast expanse of white. In this vast expanse of white, the only black color that stood in opposition was the black divine sword in the center of the Void.

The black magic sword had become the only focus in the world.

The fourth level of the Samsara Sword Formation, the world of ice and snow, had taken shape!

“Go!”

Jian Wushuang pointed.

The black magic sword instantly turned into black lightning and shot out. In an instant, it appeared in front of Jin Shi.

Jin Shi’s eyes were red, and there was endless golden divine power gathering in his right palm. Suddenly, he swung his right arm, and a golden fist smashed out like a golden meteorite falling from the sky.

The black divine sword stabbed crazily.

Bang!

With a loud sound, a terrifying power spread out and shattered everything in the surroundings.

In the middle of the collision, Jin Shi’s body shook, and his aura instantly weakened, with faint blood flowing out of his mouth.

It was obvious that he had been completely crushed in this head-on collision.

“Die!”

Killing intent flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. The black divine sword did not stop for a moment, but it shot out again and directly hit Jin Shi’s divine body.

Jin Shi’s body was covered with protective armor. He seemed uninjured, but the inside of his divine body had been shattered.

A Peak False Saint had died on the spot!
