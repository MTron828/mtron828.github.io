Chapter 797: Cercis Island

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Cercis Island was very prosperous. There were plenty of shops and huge crowds of people.

Soon after arriving on the island, Jian Wushuang found that the experts here had pretty high standards.

There were countless Divine Realm experts here, and there were many experts at the Eternal Realm.

When he arrived at the island, he headed directly for an intelligence shop.

“Please give me a piece of information about Cercis Island. The more detailed, the better,” Jian Wushuang said to the attendant at the counter.

“The most detailed information will cost 100,000 Divine Gems,” the attendant replied with a smile.

“It’s so expensive!”?Jian Wushuang recoiled inwardly at the price.

100,000 Divine Gems was about all money that a superior Divine Realm expert would own.?“It’s just a piece of detailed information about this island. The cost is exorbitant!”

Despite this, Jian Wushuang purchased the information at a cost of 100,000 Divine Gems.

In the last 37 years that he spent traveling, he had met and killed scores of bandits, some of whom were experts at Step One or Step Two of the Eternal Realm. He had obtained many Divine Gems from them, adding on to his stash from the Firmament Territory. Now, he still had a large number of Divine Gems left after his trip through the wormhole of the Void Temple.

Thus, 100,000 Divine Gems was relatively insignificant to Jian Wushuang.

“And I also want the details of an expert on Cercis Island,” Jian Wushuang added.

“Whose?” the attendant enquired.

“Lei Xin, he’s a strong guy, an Eternal Realm expert. He should have broken through to Step Four of the Eternal Realm at least, perhaps even Step Five. I heard that he has joined a great power, and that he has a disciple named Su Ming,” Jian Wushuang replied flatly.

“Wait a minute please,” the attendant said as he looked down to search for information. After a while, he looked up again and continued, “I’ve found the details of the man you mentioned. This information is very valuable. The price is 200,000 Divine Gems.”

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang paid 200,000 Divine Gems.

The attendant quickly arranged all the information, handed it to Jian Wushuang and said, “This is what you’ve bought.”

Jian Wushuang took the information and placed it in his Interspatial Ring, then walked away.

There were numerous shops and taverns on the busy streets of Cercis Island. Jian Wushuang entered a three-storey tavern.

He chose a seat near the window and ordered a jug of wine. He began to drink while perusing the information he had bought.

“Tut, tut, the Lord of Cercis Island is really awesome!”?Jian Wushuang gasped in admiration.

According to the information he had obtained, there was a lord of this Cercis Island who possessed exceptional power.

Cercis Island abutted the Tang of the East. Its location had led to a large number of experts passing through. Many experts often gathered on the island.

Having to face so many experts, the Lord of Cercis Island had adopted a tough stance and what he said carried weight.

He had made many rules on Cercis Island, and no one had ever dared to break them, including the supreme experts in the Level of Dao Master.

It was said that a powerful Dao Master had once violated the rules, challenged the authority of the Lord of Cercis Island. The lord had dealt with him personally.

The powerful Dao Master had been immediately suppressed by the Lord of Cercis Island. The lord’s power may not be as great as that of the four Emperors at the height of the Tang of the East, but many in the Eternal World were in awe of his power. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The information also mentioned that he was eccentric and that his rules were outlandish.

The first rule was that private fighting and killing were not allowed on Cercis Island.

For that reason, there was a Blood Battle Arena on the island, which had been specially established for fights. In the Blood Battle Arena, the fighters were not restrained even if someone was killed, whereas the fighters would come to a bad end if they fought on the other parts of the island and were caught.

“The Lord of Cercis Island built up the Cercis Army at great expense to keep the peace on the island,” Jian Wushuang read. Then he squinted through the window at the teams of purple-armored sergeants who occasionally passed the street below the tavern.

Those sergeants were part of the Cercis Army.

The army, founded by the Lord of Cercis Island, consisted of 10,000 sergeants.

Every sergeant in the army was carefully selected. Even the weakest sergeant had the battle strength of a superior Divine Realm expert, and the leader of a 10-sergeant squad was in the Eternal Realm.

Within the Cercis Army, the higher the rank of a sergeant, the more formidable he was.

“Of the 10,000 Cercis Army sergeants, the weakest is the superior Divine Realm expert, and about 1,000 sergeants are experts in the Eternal Realm.”?Jian Wushuang was impressed.

There were more Eternal Realm experts in the army than in all of the Firmament Territory.

“The sergeants are scattered all over the island, so no matter where the fighting is happening, swift action can be taken by the army. In addition, some of the sergeants are at Step Four or Five of the Eternal Realm, which guarantees that fierce fights can be easily suppressed,” Jian Wushuang went on reading, and thought to himself,?“If I fight on this island, I’m afraid I’ll be put down by them too.”

“Fortunately, this rule is not absolute,” he murmured and smiled.

The second rule of Cercis Island stated that anyone who had won 10 times in a row in the Blood Battle Arena would be entitled to a Cercis Token. That token gave its owner the privilege to kill people anywhere on the island.

The first rule forbade fighting and killing, while the second gave some experts the privilege of killing. It demonstrated how strange the island owner’s rules were.

“Blood Battle Arena?”

The information purchased by Jian Wushuang also contained details about the Blood Battle Arena.

The Blood Battle Arena was the craziest killing field on Cercis Island, a battlefield for life-or-death duels.

Many experts had fought each other in the Blood Battle Arena. There were usually casualties for at least one side!

Fighters typically met cruel ends, so the people who fought in the Blood Battle Arena were real experts who had great confidence in themselves.

After 10 consecutive victories in the Blood Battle Arena, the winner would be given a Cercis Token. The Cercis Token gave the winner many privileges on Cercis Island, such as shopping concessions in all its shops, and the privilege of living on the island all year round.

It was said that it was possible to obtain 100 victories in a row. However, few experts could achieve this, and such an expert may not show up one for hundreds of years. It was more common to see experts winning 10 consecutive victories.

As Jian Wushuang went through the information, he suddenly noticed a handsome young man escorted by two guards into the shop opposite the tavern.

Immediately, his face became grim, and his eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Su Ming!” Jian Wushuang muttered.

He clenched his hands resentfully, and the cup in his hand nearly crumbled.
