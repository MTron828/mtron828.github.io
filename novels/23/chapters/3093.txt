Chapter 3094: Heaven-Cleaving Star

After the fight, in the void outside the arena.

“Elder Mo Shan.” Jian Wushuang stood in front of Mo Shan.

“Little guy, I knew you had a high comprehension of the space-time principles and excellent swordsmanship. I didn’t expect you to have such high attainments in the reincarnation principles. Your sword formation is also quite extraordinary,” Mo Shan said.

“Senior, did you just see it in the gladiator arena?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes.” Mo Shan nodded slightly, then he said seriously, “It’s more difficult to comprehend the rules later on. Therefore, 99% of the cultivators in the Divine Beginning World usually focus on studying one principle. After all, one’s energy is limited. If one studies two principles at the same time, it’s likely that they will be dragged down by each other, which will lower their own achievements. They can only think of other principles after they break through to become a Principles Master.”

“When you become a Principles Master, can you study other principles?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course, to become a Principles Master, you must have completely comprehended and mastered a principle. After mastering this principle, Principles Masters will find a way to master a second principle in order to increase their strength. After all…to completely master a principle, you can get a rule will. This principle will is extremely powerful. The reason why Principles Masters are far superior to the Immortal Saint is because of the existence of this principle will!”

“However, if you can master two principles at the same time, you will naturally be able to get two sets of the will of principles, and your strength will naturally be stronger,” Mo Shan said.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood. “The will of principles?”

He secretly remembered this, but he also knew that his strength was still too weak. He was still far from completely mastering one principle.

“Of course, ordinary cultivators don’t dare to split their attention at the Immortal Saint level, but you are different. You are a true genius and a peerless genius. Even if a genius like you comprehended two principles at the same time, the chances of becoming a Principles Master in the future are very high,” Mo Shan said.

Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Well, 80 years have passed, and the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Land is about to open. Come with me to the Heaven-cleaving Star,” Mo Shan said.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Jian Wushuang immediately followed Mo Shan and set off.

…

The Heaven-cleaving Star Alliance was widely recognized as the number one Freedom Alliance in the Divine Beginning World. Its power was huge and spread throughout every corner of the Divine Beginning World.

In addition to having a large number of secret lairs in the Divine Beginning World, the Heaven-cleaving Star Alliance also had two lairs.

The Heaven-cleaving Star was one of the lairs of the Heaven-cleaving Star Alliance, and it was also the location of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces.

A large number of genius disciples and some high-level experts of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces lived in the Heaven-cleaving Star all year round.

“This is the Heaven-cleaving Star?”

Jian Wushuang had already stepped into the Heaven-cleaving Star through the space passage.

As soon as he arrived at the Heaven-cleaving Star, Jian Wushuang immediately found that this star was different from other places.

“So strong, so strong gravity. I feel that the gravity of this star is at least a hundred times stronger than that of other places!” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

The gravity was 100 times stronger, which meant that it was 100 times more difficult to move on this star than in other places.

If a cultivator stayed in the star for a long time, he would be affected by the gravity all the time and would benefit a lot.

“You are only at the edge of the star. When you reach the center of the star, the gravity there will be stronger. The gravity will suppress and promote the cultivator. If you stay in the star for a long time, your divine power will increase faster than in other places and your divine body will be stronger,” Mo Shan also said.

Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

He could feel that the speed at which he accumulated divine power on the star was much faster than in other places.

“Of course, the gravity is only one of the many opportunities and superior cultivation conditions on the star. The star was moved from the universe battlefield by the Alliance Master of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. It has all kinds of magical abilities. It’s a pity that you’re not a member of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. Otherwise, you would be qualified to see them one by one,” Mo Shan said.

Jian Wushuang shrugged, feeling helpless.

“Let’s go.”

Mo Shan led Jian Wushuang to the center of the Heaven-cleaving Star.

There were already many people waiting in the center of the star.

Most of them were genius disciples of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces.

Today was the opening day of the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, so many disciples of the three palaces were attracted to it.

Among the crowd, there were all kinds of discussions.

“After 10,000 years, the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm is finally about to open again. Unfortunately, I’m too weak, so I can’t get a spot.”

“The Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm opens once every 10,000 years. Each time, there are only three spots. All the geniuses of the three palaces add up to hundreds of people. So many people are only fighting for three spots. Naturally, only the best three people in each era are qualified to enter. As for the others, don’t even think about it.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Three quotas? Hehe, as far as I know, only two people from the three palaces have been given quotas.”

“What?”

“Only two quotas?”

There was a sudden commotion in the crowd.

“It’s true that there are two quotas. These two quotas were obtained by the thorn tiger and thunder god of the Primal Chaos Palace. Originally, the Primal Chaos Palace also had a quota, but I heard that the quota of the Primal Chaos Palace was sent out by the Three Palace Masters not long ago.”

“Given away? To whom?”

“I don’t know, but I heard that it wasn’t someone from the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, but an outsider.”

“What?”

“An outsider got a quota to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm? How is that possible?”

“What’s going on with the three Palace Masters, why would they give such a rare and precious quota to an outsider?”

“That’s right, such a precious quota, even the three palaces of heaven slaying felt that it was too little, why would the three Palace Masters take the initiative to give it away?”

“Who knows, but there are rumors saying that the person’s talent is too incredible, making the three palace lords exclaim in admiration. That’s why they gave him a spot. There are also rumors saying that it’s because the person has a special background that the three palace lords gave him a spot.”

Many geniuses of the three Palace Masters were discussing the spot.

While they were discussing, many genius disciples were filled with righteous indignation.

“Unfair!”

“The three Heaven-cleaving Palaces are extremely lacking in quotas to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm. How can the three Palace Masters just casually hand over one?”

“That’s right. Piercing Tiger and Thunder God are the two top geniuses of the ancient palace. They each received a quota, so we have nothing to say. However, how can an outsider have the qualifications to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm?”
