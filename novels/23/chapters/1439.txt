Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Shockingly loud thunder could be heard on the horizon. Along with the thunder, there was a savage power that swept over from all directions.

Suddenly, the earth shattered.

The surrounding spectators were terrified!

“Humph, I paid a great price to nurture the ten Kings. Not only are they powerful, but when they are united in a formation, besides experts on Universe God ranking list, no one else will be evenly matched. Although he is strong, he is dreaming of being able to fight evenly with the ten Kings,” the leader of Hei Longshan, the bald man, said.

As he spoke, the huge, demonic dragon suddenly let out a raging roar. Then, it wielded the longspear in its hand and suddenly a boundless flame that covered the entire universe spurted out. The flame formed into demonic dragon knights and they charged towards Jian Wushuang.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang was in a fix.

Looking at the scene, Universe Gods in Hei Longshan suddenly looked delighted.

Only Mu Tao wasn’t. Ever since Mu Tao had seen Jian Wushuang, there was only fear in his eyes. When he saw Jian Wushuang in a pinch, he shook his head, “It’s useless. It can’t stop him. No one can stop this demon!”

He knew well how scary Jian Wushuang was.

Back then when he was on Ancient Moon Island, not only had Jian Wushuang performed terrifyingly great swordsmanship and a scary consciousness attack, the thing that had made them hopeless was his unbelievable power of defense.

Back then, when a few Peak Universe Gods launched a full attack and hit Jian Wushuang’s body directly, it didn’t affect Jian Wushuang at all.

That was the scariest part about Jian Wushuang. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

With such a terrifying divine body, he was destined to not fail.

As expected, on the battlefield, even though he was facing the attack of demonic knights and in a pinch, his aura wasn’t weakened at all. On the contrary, he grew even stronger.

“I don’t want to waste any more time on you.”

A cold voice was heard from Jian Wushuang’s mouth. In Jian Wushuang’s eyes was a chilly gleam.

There was also a significant crimson light erupting from the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

“Reincarnation Sword Principle… The bleeding technique!”

Rumble!

A terrifying crimson light suddenly erupted, the entire, vast void suddenly drowned in a crimson ocean. In the crimson ocean, a ray of swordlight penetrated the void and slashed at the demonic knight. There was a sudden explosion of Power of Reincarnation.

The demonic knight too immediately resisted with the longspear.

However, it collided with the crimson light.

Psst!

The spear was broken into two directly. The crimson swordlight wasn’t hindered but plunged at the body of the demonic knight.

That very moment, the entire universe went quiet.

The demonic knight collapsed immediately and fell apart. The ten Kings in it were revealed.

The ten Kings look terrified.

They had never expected that when the ten of them united to transform into a demonic knight with formation, they would be defeated by a Universe God.

Just then, Jian Wushuang suddenly showed a flash of murderous instinct.

“Reincarnation Sword Principle… Bleed to the end of the world!”

Wah!

A shrill, crimson sword light filled the air. In the dark void, it was like writing a crimson yet tragic and soul-stirring route to the end of the world.

It looked extremely eye-catching.

The route to the end of the world passed before the ten Kings.

Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst! Psst!

The ten Kings’ eyes were wide-open as their heads were chopped off.

With that one swung, the famous ten Kings in Hei Longshan lost their lives in an instant.

So impressive!

The tens of thousands of Universe Gods in the surrounding void were in a sudden, unprecedented shock.

Jian Wushuang was murderous. After he had killed the ten Kings, his gaze was redirected to the leader of Hei Longshan, the bald man.

“Before shooting the rider, one should shoot the horse first. Before capturing the thief, one should capture the King first!” There was coldness in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. The next moment, his figure moved and charged towards the bald man.

“Sh*t!”

The bald man felt Jian Wushuang’s intention to kill, his face grew grave.

Although he was the leader of Hei Longshan and he was the number one among all bandits in Hei Longshan, he knew clearly that when the ten Kings united, they could oppress him easily even if they didn’t perform a formation. However, Jian Wushuang had defeated the ten Kings’ demonic dragon knight in an instant and killed all ten of them.

He was such a terrifying existence. How could he be his match?

“Quick, hurry and block him for me!”

The bald man roared and commanded the surrounding bandits to block Jian Wushuang while he ran towards the void behind.

“Trying to run away?” Jian Wushuang sneered as a vast Soul Power stirred.

Vroom.

Without performing a Five Beast Manipulation Knack, without performing crimson Phoenix, with mere Soul Power, he swept out and covered the void before him, then started suppressing with Soul Power.

The terrifying Soul Power pierced into the surrounding Universe Gods’ head like a thorn instantly.

Suddenly, hua la la la. Like raindrops, more than a thousand Universe Gods’ corpses fell down before Jian Wushuang.

Before Jian Wushuang, there was immediately a broad route. Another boundless Soul Power swept out. Jian Wushuang performed the secret skill of Tian Yuan directly.

The first technique in secret skill of Tian Yuan, Inextinguishable Light!

A silent soul-light caught up to the bald man at an incredibly fast speed and was absorbed into his body.

“Ah!!!” The bald man cried out. His body stopped and his hands were on his head as he screamed in pain.

The bald man was a true Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven, after all. With Jian Wushuang’s current Soul strength, performing Inextinguishable Light would at most make him feel pain and affect his movement. However, it wouldn’t be possible if Jian Wushuang intended to kill the bald man with Inextinguishable Light.

The moment the bald man stopped, Jian Wushuang immediately appeared behind him. He swung out a swordlight and the bald man’s head flew off.

Jian Wushuang lifted his hand to catch the bald man’s skull.

In the void, Jian Wushuang held his sword in one hand and held the bald man’s head in the other. He looked around at the Hei Longshan experts surrounding him. He exerted strength in his palm and the bald man’s head exploded in his head. Then, Jian Wushuang spoke in a cold voice.

“Whoever blocks me… will die!!!”
