2030 The Ceremony Began

“Arrogant?”

Lin Tianhao smirked, “This person had called himself Ah Shou. He came to Imperial Peak in the same batch of ranking competition as me. Not only is he arrogant, he is also unrestrainedly arrogant. I had an argument before. I told him my identity but he didn’t care about Lin Family at all.”

“Oh?” The handsome young man’s gaze grew cold.

Didn’t care about Lin Family?

One should know that the handsome man was from Lin Family too.

“You are Ah Shou, right? As you don’t care about Lin Family, I believe that you must be very powerful. As we have crossed paths today, why not make a trip to the battlefield together?” The handsome young man asked in a deep voice.

“Battlefield?” Jian Wushuang thought.

It was a place designated for battle in Imperial Peak. The rules at Imperial Peak were strict but in the battlefield, as long as both parties agreed, they could fight all they wanted.

“Hehe, just a battle anyway. Do you think I’m afraid of you? But I am very busy. I have no time to waste. So, I’ll take to you next time.”

Then, Jian Wushuang turned to leave without looking at their response. He left very quickly, as though he were running for his life.

Lin Tianhao and the handsome young man saw his response and they looked at him in disdain.

“This b*stard was so arrogant back in Imperial City and he didn’t respect anyone at all. Now he is in Imperial Peak and realized that there are many experts who are far more powerful than him, he’s now well-behaved!” Lin Tianhao scoffed.

“Humph. He didn’t dare to take the challenge but he sounded like he wouldn’t yield. Rubbish!” The young man still looked in disdain.

The two of them didn’t bother much and left very quickly.

In a corner near the border of the great formation, Jian Wushuang hid in secret. He let out a breath of relief when he saw Lin Tianhao and the handsome young man making a move to leave.

“Sword Emperor, how do you feel being cornered by two young men at the early stage Chaotic Realm?” Great Emperor Zhi Luo joked in Blood Mountain Sword.

Jian Wushuang rubbed his nose and smiled helplessly.

If it wasn’t because he had concerns and he couldn’t expose his overly powerful strength, he could have killed the two of them with a wave.

However, he could only flee because of his concerns. He couldn’t just take the challenge.

“Great Emperor Zhi Luo, is there a result?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Mm, yes, there is,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo nodded.

Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao looked at Great Emperor Zhi Luo.

“I inspected carefully but the spacetime surrounding Imperial Peak is very unique. It might be because of the great formation covering it. It would be extremely difficult to open up a spacetime tunnel that connects to the outside world from inside Imperial Peak. With my power alone, it will be impossible,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo said.

“Impossible?” Jian?Wushuang, Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao looked shocked.

“Calm down,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo smiled, “With my power alone, it is naturally impossible. Fortunately, I once obtained a unique spacetime treasure when I wandered in an ancient battlefield. With the assistance of the treasure, I should be able to open up a spacetime tunnel.”

“That’s great,” Abysmal Saint Master immediately beamed with joy.

“Zhi Luo, I knew you would have a way,” Emperor Jiu Qiao looked at Great Emperor Zhi Luo.

Although Great Emperor Zhi Luo wasn’t powerful, Emperor Bai wouldn’t hesitate to put him in the four members experts troop. Plus, there was no objection from any of the Sanctuary Alliance higher-ups. It was because Great Emperor Zhi Luo was great with spacetime skills and she would be extremely helpful to the four members expert troop.

Regardless of if it was when they were besieged by the six Great Emperors or then, they had to rely on Great Emperor Zhi Luo to set up a spacetime tunnel as their route of escape.

“The three of you make it sound so easy. My spacetime treasure is a one-time item. If I were to use it this time, it’d be gone. So, don’t waste my treasure. You definitely have to destroy the Emperor Supreme Rock or the golden whirlpool,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo said.

“Don’t worry, we will,” Emperor Jiu Qiao said.

“Alright. On Doctrine Propagation Ceremony day, Zhi Luo, you first set up the spacetime tunnel. As for the task of destroying the Emperor Supreme Rock or the golden whirlpool, the three of us will take care of it,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

“Alright,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo nodded.

The four of them discussed and they had a fully-planned strategy.

Then, they only had to wait for the arrival of Doctrine Propagation Ceremony day.

In the blink of an eye, more than ten days passed.

It was finally the day where Doctrine Propagation Ceremony started.

Doctrine Propagation Ceremony in Imperial Peak was only held once over many years. Every time there would be a few higher-ups from Imperial Cabinet, also those in Peak Chaotic Realm, who came to teach.

The experts in Peak Chaotic Realm were pathetically few, even in Three-Emperors World.

Any one of them who taught would be extremely attractive to all cultivators in Three-Emperors World.

Hence, a large number of cultivators in Imperial Peak were excited when Doctrine Propagation Ceremony started. When the door of Doctrine Propagation Palace opened, the cultivators swarmed in.

The opportunity lands in Imperial Peak were normally filled up a large number of cultivators comprehending there, such as the three lofty statues. But then, there was no one at the three statues. The people who were comprehending there had already departed to Doctrine Propagation Palace.

Besides the few at the crucial stage or cultivating in seclusion, the other cultivators at Imperial Peak had already gathered in Doctrine Propagation Palace. Even the deacons in Cabinet Imperials went there too. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

In other words, almost ninety-nine percent of the cultivators in Imperial Peak were gathered in Doctrine Propagation Palace.

Of course, Jian Wushuang wasn’t one of them.

Jian Wushuang continued to stay where he was as he fixed his gaze upon the pinnacle in Imperial Peak, where the Imperial Cabinet located.

Finally… Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

There was a total of five figures that plunged out from Imperial Cabinet at the same time. The five figures didn’t hesitate but plunged towards Doctrine Propagation Palace directly.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes beamed with excitement when he saw the five of them leaving.

“A total of five Great Emperors who resided in Imperial Cabinet all year round left for Doctrine Propagation Palace,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

He knew that there wouldn’t be many experts of Great Emperor level, even in Three-Emperors World. It was already great that there were twenty of them. On top of that, more than half of the Great Emperors were scattered through various regions in Three-Emperors World but not within Imperial Peak.

It was already shocking enough that there was a total of eight Great Emperors guarding in Imperial Peak.

Then, the five Great Emperors in Imperial Cabinet went to Doctrine Propagation Palace. Hence, in that short period of time, Jian Wushuang would only have to deal with the three Great Emperors who guarded the golden whirlpool all year round.
