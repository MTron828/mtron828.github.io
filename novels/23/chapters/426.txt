Chapter 427: Deng Huo’s Arrival

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Deng Huo?”

Hearing his name, even though it was Jian Wushuang, he couldn’t help but feel his heart skip a beat.

On the Flaming Battlefield, there were experts like Bone King, Duo Xin Marquis and Xue Luo overlords, who few dared challenge.

They were strong but not invincible. The real invincible ones were the six super experts of Heaven-defying Level.

Six Heaven-defying experts for the two camps, each camp had three.

Deng Huo was one of those Heaven-defying experts in the Pale Moon Marquis Camp!

On the entire Flaming Battlefield, they were the true supreme and invincible ones except for the Lords.

“Heaven-defying Level?”

Xue Yang, Beast and their companions had both eyes widely opened. They were all frightened while looking at Deng Huo.

“How could this be?” Bone King roared.

“There are three Heaven-defying experts in Pale Moon Marquis camp. Their status was even higher than some normal lords. They seldom come to the Flaming Battlefield, how could one appear here today?”

Bone King couldn’t believe what he had seen.

Experts of Heaven-defying Level came to the Flaming Battlefield only once in a long while. Even if they came, usually they went directly to the Inner Area. Once they went to the Inner Area, it took time for the Pale Moon Marquis to send them here.

Today, how could an expert of Heaven-defying Level arrive within a day, there had to be a reason. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Was Deng Huo just in the campsite of Pale Moon Marquis or setting out to the Flaming Battlefield when we attacked Jiushe Cave Mansion?”?Bone King was thinking.

Yes.

Deng Huo set out from the campsite and as soon as he arrived at the Outer Area he got the message, asking him to help Duo Xin Marquis take back the Jiushe Cave Mansion. Therefore, he came immediately.

Though he arrived later than Duo Xin Marquis and his companions who used a Space-travel Spell.

“Master Deng Huo!”

“Master Deng Huo!”

Duo Xin Marquis and the other experts of the Pale Moon Marquis camp saluted the white-robed elder.

Deng Huo, an expert of Heaven-defying Level, was much stronger than those at Peak of Stage Three. Even it was Duo Xin Marquis, he would respectfully address him as Master.

Deng Huo, the white-robed elder who seemed like standing in sunlight, assessed the situation quickly. When he saw the body of the green-clothed elder below and the emaciated lady, he turned sullen.

“Nine Peak of Stage Three joined hands. Instead of defeating them, one of you died and another was heavily wounded, such a humiliation.” Deng Huo’s cold voice echoed in the void.

Hearing this, the experts of the Pale Moon Marquis camp felt embarrassed but no one dared contradict him.

If it were another expert who said that, Duo Xin Marquis would have been angry. But it was Deng Huo, so he dared not express his discontent.

“And stupid.”

Deng Huo continued, “You are here to take back Jiushe Cave Mansion. However, you’re trapped in a fight with them outside the cave mansion. Given more time, people in the cave mansion will finish the Formation and then, what can you do even if you kill them all?”

“Then the Jiushe Cave Mansion will be taken away from us, wouldn’t it?”

Experts of Pale Moon Marquis camp were all stunned and bitterly smiled.

They knew what he meant, but what could they do, no one was able to get past the fight to enter into the cave mansion.

Deng Huo looked at Jian Wushuang and the others, “I’m going to seek opportunities in the cave mansion, it’s better to settle the fight here as quickly as possible.”

As he finished talking, Deng Huo turned into a dazzling light and rushed towards the entrance of Jiushe Cave Mansion below.

“Damn it!”

Jian Wushuang and Bone King, as well as the others immediately realized his intentions.

Lady Red was alone establishing her Formation in the Jiushe Cave Mansion. She was just a normal Pinnacle of the Saint Realm. If Deng Huo found her, she would be killed easily.

If he did that, they would fail their task.

“I’m going to stop him.”

Bone King was going to try to stop Deng Huo, but before he could leave, Duo Xin Marquis immediately stopped him.

“Bone King, where are you going?” Duo Xin Marquis said with a cold smile.

“Bastard.” Bone King cursed inside. He had to stop and deal with Duo Xin Marquis first.

As for Xue Yang, Beast and the others, their strength was not high enough to stop Deng Huo. Even if they could, they were busy fighting with others.

Only Jian Wushuang could do it.

“You stay here and stop Duo Xin Marquis and his companions, I will deal with Deng Huo!” Jian Wushuang said with a stern face.

“Swordsman!”

Bone King, Xue Yang and the others frowned, not because they didn’t believe Jian Wushuang, but rather Deng Huo was too strong and only Bone King was capable of fighting with him.

Even if it was only for a short while.

Now they could do nothing but pray that Jian Wushuang could survive.

Though it was a slim chance. If Jian Wushuang failed, they would have to flee as soon as possible.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang followed Deng Huo and rushed into the Jiushe Cave Mansion.

Once Jian Wushuang left, the Blood River vanished. Experts of the Pale Moon Marquis camp felt a sense of relief.

Duo Xin Marquis clenched his right hand with light flashing in his eyes.

“Bone King, I could not fully use my strength under the Realm just now. Let’s fight again.” Duo Xin Marquis said in a deep voice.

“Humph, bring it on.” Bone King’s face was cold and stern. Xue Yang, Beast and others were also eager to battle.

If it were moments ago, it was difficult for them to fend against those experts without the help of Jian Wushuang’s Realm.

But now, the green-clothed elder was killed and the black-robed emaciated lady was heavily wounded. Their battle strength was almost the same and an equal fight was possible.

“Come on.” Bone King roared, the two camps erupted into a fierce fight.
