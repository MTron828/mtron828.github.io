Chapter 748: An Acquaintance

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Mind-controlling Secret Skill was one of the Ancient God Clan’s top three Secret Skills. It aimed to target the opponent’s mind.

If one practiced this Secret Skill to its fullest, he might be able to control others’ minds.

But apparently, Jian Wushuang’s present phase was too low. He had just learned the rudiments of this Secret Skill. Thus, even though he cast it with all his strength, he could only disrupt the mind of the white-haired elder for a moment. But thanks to this moment, Jian Wushuang had seized the chance and destroyed him for good.

Now, he had killed two of the three Eternal Realm of Immortal Dynasty experts. Only one had escaped by fluke, the purple-clothed lady.

“Your Excellency.”

Gu Mian, Gu Wu, and the two clansmen who guarded the Baptismal Pool approached Jian Wushuang, their faces frightened and awe-stricken. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The last time they saw Jian Wushuang, he had only been at the One-star Level. They had taken word of his strength with a grain of salt.

Although they knew Jian Wushuang was from the Ancient God Palace and Gu Heng had once told them in person that Jian Wushuang’s strength was stronger than most of the clansmen, they still found it hard to believe because none of them had ever witnessed his true strength.

But now, seeing Jian Wushuang strike with their own eyes, they did not dare to doubt his strength anymore.

“Oh my god! That outsider was really quite powerful. If it had been me dueling with him, even if I turned into an Ancient God and went all out, I could at most suppress his power a bit. But he didn’t hold himself together long under Jian Wushuang’s attack. And at last, he was killed, wasn’t he?”

“And Jian Wushuang did all this without transforming into an Ancient God, right?”

Gu Mian and Gu Wu voiced their admiration in hushed tones.

They were both Two-star Silver-armored Ancient Gods. Their strength was quite impressive, almost rivaling human combatants at Step Two of the Eternal Realm. Subduing the elder out in the open would be a piece of cake. But to actually kill him, that would be impossible.

But Jian Wushuang had done it, without even transforming into an Ancient God.

“Gu Mian, Gu Wu.”

Jian Wushuang turned to look at them. “From now on, the two of you can stop following me. You should go on your own adventures.”

“What?”

“Er…?”

Their expressions quickly altered.

Gu Heng had ordered them to follow Jian Wushuang for all time.

“The reason Gu Heng ordered you guys to accompany me was to protect me,” Jian Wushuang began. “Now, as you witnessed, I am much stronger than you. I can travel in the Tianqi Mountains by myself. If I actually fall into a dangerous situation, you two won’t be much help. You might even be an extra burden.”

Gu Mian and Gu Wu exchanged dismal looks, and both gave a wry smile.

They knew that he was only telling the truth.

“Right then, that’s settled. I’ll take off first.” Jian Wushuang said briskly. Then, he left.

Gu Mian and Gu Wu stood there, watching Jian Wushuang’s silhouette fade into the distance.

Jian Wushuang was walking alone in the Tianqi Mountains. He suddenly came to a halt and looked back.

Seeing that Gu Mian and Gu Wu were not following him, a hearty smile curled on his lips.

“One day I’ll leave the Eternal Zone and go back to the Firmament Territory. If these two from the Ancient God Clan keep tailing me, how am I supposed to get out of here?” he said, shaking his head.

At this precise moment, he sensed something weird and looked out toward the end of the Void ahead.

A vague black dot appeared.

“Is someone there? Could it be an Ancient God or an expert from the Firmament Territory?” Jian Wushuang was intrigued. He headed towards the black dot.

As he approached the black dot, its true appearance gradually became clear.

“Is that him?

Jian Wushuang’s eyes suddenly brightened, and a smile spread across his face. This smile was icy cold, as piercing as a blade.

He quickly sped up and flew straight towards the black figure.

He could see a young man carrying a saber on his back. He was flying slowly, his eyes cold and lofty.

His clothes were a bit tattered, his face looked a little glum. It was obvious that he had just had a fierce fight.

It was Wu Dao.

A century prior, he had been a disciple of the Cloud Sea Asgard. But now, he was an Elder.

“Damn Demon Gods, they are so tough! Especially the Silver-armored Demon Gods!” Wu Dao cursed through gritted teeth as he flew by himself.

He had known perfectly that he had just arrived in the Eternal Realm and could not face the Demon Gods on his own. Thus, when he entered the Tianqi Mountains, he had immediately joined two other Elders of the Cloud Sea Asgard and they had started the journey together.

But the three of them had bumped into a group of four Demon Gods, and one of them was a Silver-armored Demon God.

The two sides instantly started to fight. Of course, the three Elders were no match for the Demon Gods. They had been forced to flee in panic. But the each of them had chosen a different way to escape, and this was why Wu Dao was now traveling all alone in this stretch of Void.

“Those Demon Gods have built-in advantages. If I come across a Copper-armored Demon God, it will be very difficult to tackle him on my own. If I run into a Silver-armored Demon God, all I can do is run away…” Wu Dao said thoughtfully. “Based on my current circumstances, the first thing I should do is go to the contact station and rejoin the other two Elders.”

Just when Wu Dao had made up his mind, a figure suddenly emerged in the Void just ahead of him.

“Er… is that?” Wu Dao widened his eyes and tried to see what it was. His expression became strange. “Demon God? A One-star Demon God? Wearing a mask?”

The One-star Demon God abruptly sped up and hurtled towards him.

He noticed that the One-star Demon God’s eyes were flickering with a trace of killing intent.

“You’re just a One-star Demon God. How can you kill me?”

“Go to hell!”

Wu Dao was infuriated. His saber appeared in his hand. Raging killing intent rose up from his body. He charged directly towards the figure.

Holding his sword in one hand, Jian Wushuang made a hacking move. He also performed the coordinated 11th Level of the Star-river Secret Skill to the extreme. The Sword Heart in his sea of consciousness unleashed half of its power as well.

This move seemed casual, but its power was so overwhelming that even a man at Step One of the Eternal Realm might not be able to sustain it.

Wu Dao also thrust his saber out. He spared no effort in this first strike.

A streak of sparkling saber light stretched out. It remained there for a long time before it dispersed. Its power was equally astonishing.

“Damn you, Demon God bastard, your Essence Blood is mine now!”

Wu Dao’s eyes were scarlet. He had a savage look in his face.

Soon, the two figures confronted each other in the Void.
