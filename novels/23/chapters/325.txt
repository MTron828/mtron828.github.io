Chapter 326: The Treasure Auction

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei entered Ice Nether Valley as solitary experts, so they were given a room.

That night, the moon was dimmed by clouds.

“Tomorrow is the wedding day, Second Brother must have arrived at Ice Nether Valley.”

Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei sat at a table, drinking tea and chatting.

“Hehe, I’m so excited at the thought of tomorrow,” Chi Mei replied and laughed in a strange way.

“Ice Nether Valley is too big and I don’t know the way. Otherwise, I could look around and try to find Fourth Sister. That would be better.”?Jian Wushuang secretly shook his head.

He planned to explore Ice Nether Valley tonight, but he finally gave up because it was too big.

“It all depends on tomorrow.”?A light of firmness flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

At the moment... Knock, Knock! Someone knocked on the door.

“Come on in.” Both Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei looked at the door.

The door opened. A disciple of Ice Nether Valley walked in and told Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei, “Sir, there is a treasure auction in Dongling Pavilion, many people will be there to bid, so I came here to inform you.”

“A Treasure Auction?” Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei looked at each other.

“It’s being hosted by Ice Nether Valley. Many treasures will be auctioned, and our young sect master personally picked three valuable and rare treasures in honor of the guests who traveled so far,” the disciple said.

“Really?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and asked.

“You can go if you are interested. Sorry to bother you.” After saying that, the disciple left and went to inform the other guests.

“We have had rotten luck with treasure yesterday, and today there is a treasure auction. ‘Treasure’ again?” Chi Mei said and sneered.

“Come on, let’s have a look,” Jian Wushuang said and smiled slightly, then they left for the Dongling Pavilion.

The Dongling Pavilion was a two-story pavilion, that currently had many warriors gathered inside.

“So many people.”

Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei went to a corner on the second floor. They looked around, but they were unable to find Yang Zaixuan and his companions.

At the center of the pavilion’s first floor, the treasure auction was already in progress, and many treasures had been auctioned off. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Currently, an Origin manual was being auctioned. However, Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei looked down on the level of this Origin manual. Still, there were many experts who were interested in bidding for it.

Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei watched them indifferently.

But he had to admit that there were many treasures. They were nothing to Jian Wushuang, or to experts of the Saint Realm such as Chi Mei, but they were valuable to experts in Yin-Yang Void Realm.

More than an hour later, nearly one hundred treasures had been auctioned off, and it was finally?time for the main attraction, the final three treasures.

At this point, Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei became curious.

“Let’s see what Master Ye Chen has picked,” Jian Wushuang said and smiled.

Among the final three treasures, the first one was a pure golden elixir, that had been placed inside a jade box and gave off a fragrant smell.

“It’s... a Paleopole Elixir?” Chi Mei was surprised.

Jian Wushuang was also a little bit surprised.

He had heard of it.

The Paleopole Elixir was “analogous” with the Saint Breakthrough Elixir, which meant it functioned similarly to a Saint Breakthrough Elixir. It boosted the breakthrough to the Saint Realm, but its effect was much weaker than the Saint Breakthrough Elixir.

A Saint Breakthrough Elixir would increase the odds of success by 20%, but a Paleopole Elixir would only increase the chance by 5% at most.

Still, it was enough to draw in experts at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm and even Half-saints.

As expected, the Paleopole Elixir caused a stir in the Dongling Pavilion. Many burning eyes focused on it.

As soon as the elder announced the start of the auction, they immediately started bidding on it.

“Though the Paleopole Elixir’s effect is much weaker than Saint Breakthrough Elixir, it still helps. Swordsman, aren’t you even slightly interested in it?” Chi Mei looked at Jian Wushuang with interest, since he hadn’t reach Divine Transcendence yet.

“Less than 5%, it’s not worth much to me.” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

Actually, he believed he could reach the Saint Realm without a boost. A Saint Breakthrough Elixir might slightly interest him, but he would not go crazy over it, let alone a Paleopole Elixir.

The fierce bidding war, for the Paleopole Elixir, continued for 15 minutes. In the end, it was finally auctioned off for 8 million Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid.

8 million Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid wasn’t a small number.

It might be the total assets of an average Saint Realm expert.

Once the first item was sold, the second item immediately appeared. It was a manual, a second-grade Origin manual.

“A second-grade manual?”

“Second-grade!”

“My God!”

The whole Dongling Pavilion became frenzied.

On the Nanyang Continent, only the eight top sects had second-grade manuals, but those weak old sects didn’t. At most, they had superior third-grade manuals.

Now, a second-grade manual showed up in the auction. Surely, it would cause a ruckus.

“Ye Chen really brought out a big surprise.” Chi Mei smiled and said, “Unfortunately, it’s useless for me.”

Jian Wushuang was still indifferent, showing no interest in the Origin manual.

Finally, it was sold for 19 million Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid.

Finally, the last one appeared.

It was.... a leaf!

“A leaf?”

Many warriors in the pavilion were stunned while looking at the leaf on the exhibition stand.

Even Jian Wushuang felt weird as he looked at it.
