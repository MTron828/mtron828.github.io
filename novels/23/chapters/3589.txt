Chapter 3590: The Five Pinnacle of the Six Realm Experts

Although there were more than 100 experts around Jian Wushuang, only five of them had reached the pinnacle of the six realm. Therefore, the movements of the five pinnacle of the six realm experts were noticed by the other experts, however, when the five pinnacle of the six realm joined hands and rushed toward Jian Wushuang, the void immediately stirred.

“They’re finally going to make a move!”

“Before Blood Spirit King arrived, the four of them were not absolutely sure that they could force Blood Sword Master. But now, with Blood Spirit King, this lineup is enough!”

“Five experts of the pinnacle of the six realm, especially top experts like Blood Spirit King and Blood Saber Emperor. I’m afraid only a Ruler can do nothing to such a lineup.”

A series of sighing voices sounded from every corner.

In just a moment, the five experts had appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and said, “Five experts, are you ready to attack so soon? Why don’t you wait for a few more experts at the pinnacle of the six realm to arrive?”

The lineup of five experts at the pinnacle of the six realm might seem extremely terrifying to others, but Jian Wushuang felt that it was still a little lacking.

He wanted to intimidate everyone. Naturally, the more experts the better.

The five experts of the pinnacle of the six realm were not enough to meet Jian Wushuang’s requirements.

“Blood Sword Master, the five of us are here together. You should understand your current situation. You have no more room for struggle. You’d better tell us everything you know.” Blood Saber Emperor said.

“Tell us? Who will hear it? The five of you or all the experts present?” Jian Wushuang said with interest.

“Of course, only the five of us will hear it.” Thunder Blaze Master said coldly.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and said with a smile, “If that’s the case, what about the experts around us? After all, they have followed me for a long time. It can’t be for nothing, right?”

As soon as he said this, the Principles Masters who were in the surrounding void immediately began to discuss quietly.

Just as Jian Wushuang said, they had rushed here on purpose. If they did not get anything, how could they be satisfied?

Putting aside the opportunities that Jian Wushuang had already obtained, at least they had to know what kind of opportunities Jian Wushuang had had over the years. The secrets of the Life and Death Realm were also of great concern to everyone present.

If Jian Wushuang only told these five experts of the pinnacle of the six realm, the other experts would certainly not be satisfied.

“Blood Sword Master, at this time, do you still want us to panic?” Blood Spirit King smiled coldly. “You’d better tell us what you know. As for the surrounding experts, after the five of us confirm that what you said is true, we will naturally make it public.”

“Yes, we alone can’t swallow the secret of the Life and Death Realm. We will definitely reveal it later.” Blood Saber Emperor nodded.

Hearing this, the expressions of the experts around them immediately eased up.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and said, “I really want to reveal the secret of the Life and Death Realm, but unfortunately, even I don’t know what is in the Life and Death Realm.”

What Jian Wushuang said was the truth.

He did not know what the secret of the Life and Death Realm was. After all, he did not enter the Life and Death Realm before, but he had never entered that special space and time, however, he did not know how he came out of that special space and came out of the Life and Death Realm.

Therefore, it was obviously impossible for these people to know the secret of the Life and Death Realm.

However, in the eyes of others, Jian Wushuang was lying.

“It seems that you really intend to monopolize the secrets of the Life and Death Realm alone.” Blood Spirit King’s eyes turned cold.

“Four, what are you waiting for? Since Blood Sword Master is so stubborn, let’s attack together. I don’t believe that he can keep his mouth shut when his life is at stake!” Thunder Blaze Master said.

“Let’s attack together.” Nine Sword Demon Master’s eyes turned cold. The pitch-black godly sword on his back had already appeared in his hand.

The other four also took out their own true treasures.

“Go!”

As Blood Blade Emperor was the first to attack, the five experts at the pinnacle of the sixth realm moved at the same time.

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong!

Five shocking auras burst out at the same time. Any one of these five auras was enough to make an ordinary expert at the pinnacle of the six realm tremble.

Experts at the pinnacle of the six realm represented the pinnacle among Principles Masters. Each of them had mastered seven portions of the power of the will, and they were only one step away from becoming a Ruler. Any one of these Principles Masters was enough to make people revere them, would have been awe-inspiring. But now, there were five of them working together to kill Jian Wushuang.

“Five experts at the pinnacle of the six realm.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes gradually turned cold as he looked at the five people who were attacking him at the same time.

The five experts at the pinnacle of the six realm were slightly less than he had expected, but it was enough for him to use them to establish his power.

“Well, let’s make it these five.”

Jian Wushuang muttered and flipped his palm. The Absolute Shadow Divine Sword appeared in his hand.

“Eh? He changed his sword?”

When Jian Wushuang took out the Absolute Shadow Divine Sword, it immediately attracted the attention of Blood Saber Emperor.

The five of them had fought with Jian Wushuang before. Because they could not defeat him alone, they chose to join forces. When Jian Wushuang fought with them, he only used the Blood Mountain Sword, but now, he had taken out the Absolute Shadow Divine Sword.

“Humph, so what if he exchanged swords? That sword looks like an advanced universe supreme treasure, so what?” Nine Sword Demon Master smiled disdainfully.

His name was Nine Sword, and his sword was also a weapon. He was good at sword principle, but the divine sword in his hand was indeed a top-tier universe supreme treasure. It was one level higher than Jian Wushuang’s Absolute Shadow Divine Sword.

“Don’t waste your time with him. Attack with all your strength,” Blood Spirit King shouted in a low voice. She was wearing a pair of scarlet gloves. A large amount of blood mist was surging on the gloves, and a monstrous power condensed in her hands.

Blood Saber Emperor, Thunder Blaze Master, Nine Sword Demon Master, and Kun Master also attacked with all their strength at this moment. They showed no mercy.

Jian Wushuang could not block all the attacks of these five people at the same time. Under normal circumstances, the best way to deal with such attacks was to try to dodge them together, however, Jian Wushuang had no intention of dodging.

He took a step forward instead of retreating. He activated the Universe Origin of Sword Principle with his shadow sword, and a surge of violent aura rose up. The sword struck out with a thunderous momentum, it formed a huge blood-red flash...
