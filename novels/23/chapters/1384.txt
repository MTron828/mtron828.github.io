“My Black Tortoise’s defense capability is strong and resilient!” Jian Wushuang smiled.

No matter how violent the attack was, Jian Wushuang’s Black Tortoise stood still. Even when the tortoise was attacked and its halo became dimmer, it would soon recover with the flow of Jian Wushuang’s soul power.

“Good defense!”

But Feng Tao continued to say, “If you only keep defending without attacking, you can’t pass the exam!”

Jian Wushuang smiled, “OK, I will.”

He soon shouted, “Demonic Dragon!”

Boom!

Right then, a giant, ferocious dragon rushed into the battlefield as fast as a flash, roaring resoundingly as if it would shake the sky. Then it rushed to the green giant, caught him and bit its green throat.

The green giant screeched and shivered. No matter how hard he tried, he failed to escape from the mouth of the Demonic Dragon.

The Demonic Dragon was the craziest beast in the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knacks.

The Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack was used to transform the great soul power into five exotic beasts.

They were Demonic Dragon, Purple Tiger, Crimson Phoenix, Black Tortoise and Divine Ape.

They were distinct from each other, and the Demonic Dragon was the most ferocious.

Black Tortoise was good at defense.

At that moment…

The green giant’s neck was cut by the Demonic Dragon, so its head dissipated into nothing in the heaven.

Seeing this, Feng Tao was shocked and he consciousness power exploded.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Another three green giants appeared in the battlefield, even bigger than the previous one.

But Jian Wushuang wasn’t nervous, “You have three green giants, but I have three Demonic Dragons.”

Boom!

He generated his power to transform into another two murderous dark-color Demonic Dragons.

Now it was three Demonic Dragons versus three green giants.

They continued the fierce battle.

At last, all the three giants dissipated and only one Demonic Dragon was there. A very close competition.

Feng Tao was exhausted and injured. He looked at Jian Wushuang and expressed his admiration, “Excellent!”

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He had defeated Feng Tao.

With the same consciousness strength as Feng Tao, Jian Wushuang had defeated him with the powerful Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack.

Feng Tao asked Huo Yi, who was at the margin of the battlefield, “Have you recorded the battle?”

“Yes, the whole process is recorded.”

“Good. We have done our jobs.” Feng Tao smiled to Jian Wushuang, “We will take the recording back to the headquarters and submit it to our leaders. We will inform you of the result.”

“What a long procedure…” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Or you can go together with us to save time.” Feng Tao said, “Resources there are far better than here.”

Jian Wushuang felt excited.

Now he still needed to improve his skills to control the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack.

But the limited number of soul masters in the White Sun Town couldn’t satisfy his need to practice.

In the headquarters of the Soul Power Temple, things would be different. There would be top tribes and talents who Jian Wushuang could learn from.

“Why not?” Jian Wushuang admitted.

“When?” Feng Tao asked.

“Right now.”

He only had to inform Soul Master He and leave a message to Xue Feng and Xue Tong. After finishing all of it, Jian Wushuang headed to the headquarters of the Soul Power Temple.

The headquarters of the Soul Power Temple was called the Soul Island.

It was a large island with many talents.

In the Soul Island, there were also those as prestigious as Real Gods in the Tian Ling Mystery Land.

Though they were not as powerful as Real Gods in the Lineage of Star.

No almighty had existed in the whole of Tian Ling Mystery Land.

“Jian Wushuang, here are our headquarters.”

Feng Tao and Huo Yi took Jian Wushuang to the Soul Island.

As soon as he arrived, Jian Wushuang soon felt a strong force.

“Consciousness attack?”

But soon, he realized that the consciousness attack was too weak, meaning it was nothing compared with even the Tian Yuan Mystery Land in the Snow Kingdom, let alone the Reset Palace.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang could also feel the powerful breath from many talents.

Feng Tao said, “The Soul Island was founded by the creator of our Soul Master Temple, Real God Demonic Rain, who is also acknowledged as the most powerful master in the Tian Ling Mystery Land. The secret skill Eighteen Asura Hell that he created is still the most consciousness attack secret skill.”

“Real God Demonic Rain? Eighteen Asura Hell?” Jian Wushuang had no idea.

“It is also said that he has been to the world out of the Tian Ling Mystery Land.” Feng Tao said.

Jian Wushuang was surprised.

So, Real God Demonic Rain had traveled in the Eternal Chaotic World?ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
