“It’s more than three billion catties, perhaps somewhere between three to four billion?”

Jian Wushuang was surprised to hear the numbers from Cang Heng.

The market price for one catty of Blood Gem was worth 10 Primordial Stones. Three billion catties of Blood Gem would cost a whopping 30,000,000,000 Primordial Stones!

“Unfortunately, we can’t bag it all.” Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly along with the commanders next to him showing an equally helpless expression.

It would be fortunate if they would own up one percent of the entire Blood Gems wealth.

“How long will it take for those from Crimson Stone Fort to arrive?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“They’re already on the way. You can expect them to be here within ten days,” replied Cang Heng.

“Within ten days? We’ll wait for them then,” said Jian Wushuang.

Eight days passed.

Jian Wushuang stayed in the Blood Gems camp throughout those eight days.

“Master.” Cang Heng came in to report, “The people from Crimson Stone Fort have arrived, but...”

“But?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“That inspector is their leader,” said Cang Heng.

“Inspector?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled. “Oh, you mean the Inspector who deliberately made things difficult for me before I became the Territorial Lord? The one who asked me for benefits but I told him off, right?”

“Yes, it’s him. I find out that he’s called Jin Yihang and does have a certain background in Crimson Stone Fort. I heard he’s a direct disciple of a certain faction in Crimson Stone Fort. Four people came with him this time and the four of them are Peak Earth Ultimate Gods if my senses are correct,” said Cang Heng solemnly.

“We do have a bit of trouble here. I’ve offended him before, and he might make things hard for me since he’s here as an inspector.” Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly but did not care too much. “Let’s go and meet the Inspector first.”

Jian Wushuang went with Cang Heng to the void outside their camp.

The menace-looking purple-robed man, Jin Yihang stood up in the void while peeping down at the Blood Gem mineral vein below.

“Tsk, tsk. It’s way too big. How much exactly is it worth? I’m afraid it’s worth a few ten billion Primordial Stones.” Jin Yihang was admiring the wealth contained in the mineral vein.

“According to Northern Darkstar Territory Official Army’s message, the Blood Gems contained in this mineral vein are more than three billion catties with its value being more than thirty billion Primordial Stones,” reported a Peak Earth Ultimate God behind him.

“Thirty billion Primordial Stones?” The other Peak Earth Ultimate Gods were shocked and began discussing.

“I really didn’t expect there would be such a large mineral vein in an ordinary stellar region. Their territorial lord is going to make a fortune.”

“Yes, according to Crimson Stone Fort’s rules, we should reward the stellar region who discovered and reported to the Crimson Stone Fort of such valuable Natural Treasures like mineral veins. In this case, Crimson Stone Fort will only take away ninety percent of the treasures and give the remaining ten percent to the Territorial Lord as a reward!”

“It’s impossible to leave one-tenth worth of such a huge treasure that’s more than thirty billion Primordial Stones behind. I’m guessing that one percent is probably the capping amount.”

“It’s worth more than three hundred million Primordial Stones even at only one percent. Many Heaven Ultimate God’s net worths are less than a hundred million Primordial Stones. This Territorial Lord has hit it big.”

The four Peak Earth Ultimate Gods were green with envy during their conversation.

They envied the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord.

Jin Yihang was unhappy when he heard their conversation.

“What nonsense!”

Jin Yihang rebuked, “Listen up! No one will bring up the reward later. Northern Darkstar Territory is under Crimson Stone Fort’s jurisdiction and even manages the entire Danyang Holy Domain. Crimson Stone Fort is out to mine it since a Blood Gem mineral vein appears in the Danyang Holy Domain. What does it have to do with the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord?”

The four Peak Earth Ultimate Gods looked at each other and did not say anything but they knew what was going.

Jin Yihang did not want to leave anything for the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord and wanted to take the share that was supposed to be the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord’s.

Jian Wushuang, Cang Heng, and the other commanders had emerged from the camp and soon appeared in front of Jin Yihang.

“A pleasure to meet Master Inspector.” Jian Wushuang bowed slightly while maintaining a humble posture in front of the Inspector.

“Jian Yi, I didn’t expect to meet you again so soon.” Jin Yihang coldly stared at Jian Wushuang.

He still remembered how he had suffered a loss from Jian Wushuang and was being resentful.

“I haven’t seen you for many years, but you still haven’t changed a bit.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“Let’s not carry on with the small talks. I’m here to first confirm whether there are such a large amount of Blood Gems mineral vein here. Crimson Stone Fort will naturally send a higher-level expert to acquire it upon confirmation. You should show me around this mineral vein at this instance,” said Jin Yihang.

“No problem.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. He beckoned Cang Heng to take Jin Yihang and the others to survey the Blood Gem mineral vein.

They were done with the survey in just a few moments.

“It’s indeed a huge Blood Gem mineral vein. The amount of Blood Gems within is a lot and of extremely high value!” Jin Yihang tightly clasped his hands with an excited expression.

However, he soon calmed down and peered coldly at Jian Wushuang. “I’ve checked the Blood Gem mineral vein and we now shall wait for the high-level experts from Crimson Stone Fort to arrive, acquire, and start mining it. There’s nothing for you to do here, so you can go back for the time being.”

Jian Wushuang’s face sank but did not make a move. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Jin Yihang told them to leave but said nothing about the benefits and rewards they deserved to get.

“Master Inspector, the Northern Darkstar Territory must be handed over the Crimson Stone Fort when something like the Blood Gem mineral vein appears according to Crimson Stone Fort’s rules. If I remember correctly, doesn’t Northern Darkstar Territory also get to keep a portion of it?” said Jian Wushuang.

“Is there such a rule? Why don’t I know of it?” Jin Yihang pretended to be puzzled and even glanced at the four Peak Earth Ultimate Gods behind him. “Do we really have this rule in Crimson Stone Fort?”

The four Peak Earth Ultimate Gods looked at each other and denied the existence of that rule out of fear they would offend Jin Yihang.

“Jian Yi, you heard it yourself. Crimson Stone Fort doesn’t have this rule at all. You were wrong.” Jin Yihang smiled evilly.
