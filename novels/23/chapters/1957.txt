One godly spirit was already so powerful but there were five of them in Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror!

Plus, when the five godly spirits attacked altogether, they could form Five Fire Formation. Then, the fighting power that the five godly spirits put to play would be even stronger!

“In terms of power alone, I am far from a Great Emperor’s match. However, with Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirrors, I can be fearless when I run into an ordinary Great Emperor,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

With Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror to hand, Jian Wushuang had an extra trump card.

Plus, the trump card was pretty fierce.

Jian Wushuang was still filled with excitement, but suddenly...

“Palace Master!” Hall Master Yuan sent a message.

“Hall Master Yuan, what’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang asked with a smile.

Lineage of Star was just like Green Fire World then. They were both flourishing with prosperity. He had never been worried when he passed Lineage of Star to Hall Master Yuan.

“There’s something, a major thing,” Hall Master Yuan briefly shared the news about the brand new ancient battlefield.

At first, Jian Wushuang could keep his cool.

However, the moment he heard about the brand new ancient battlefield, his face changed.

At the very end, his face grew grave.

He was extremely upset!

“You are saying the brand new ancient battlefield is connected through a hidden space gap in ancient mystery land?” Jian Wushuang asked in a deep voice.

“Yes,” Hall Master Yuan nodded.

Jian Wushuang quivered in fear.

An ancient battlefield reachable through space gap... No doubt they were talking about the ancient battlefield in Green Fire World!!!

“Hall Master Yuan, how did you get the news? Do you know who else knows about the news?” Jian Wushuang asked closely.

“The news spread like wildfire. The entire Sanctuary Alliance, all forces, sects in Eternal Chaotic World, including many solo experts already know the news. On top of that, a large number of experts have already rushed over to the ancient battlefield. In fact, Lineage of Star received the news relatively late,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“It has spread around?” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists.

“Palace Master, the guest elders in Lineage of Star intend to explore the brand new ancient battlefield as well, what do you...” Hall Master Yuan had yet to finish his sentence.

“Tell them not to head over to the ancient battlefield,” Jian Wushuang roared directly.

“Why?” Hall Master Yuan creased his eyebrows.

“Don’t ask why, just follow my instructions,” It was inconvenient for Jian Wushuang to say too much. After some thinking, Jian Wushuang said again, “Hall Master Yuan, tell the guest elders to get ready. I’ll send He Xiu back to Lineage of Star and have him bring them to a place.”

“Where?” Hall Master Yuan couldn’t help but ask.

“They’ll know when they arrive. On top of that, let He Xiu bring along those Dao soldiers. Just leave a few of them behind to ensure there is nothing wrong with Lineage of Star,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay, I understand,” Hall Master Yuan nodded but didn’t ask further.

After communicating with Jian Wushuang, Hall Master Yuan’s gaze quickly redirected to the guest elders. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Everyone, Palace Master has commanded all of you to not step foot in the ancient battlefield,” Hall Master Yuan announced.

“What?”

The guest elders, who were originally enthusiastic and excited, became distressed and immediately burst into an uproar. They questioned Hall Master Yuan as to why this had happened.

Hall Master Yuan replied in a deep voice, “Palace Master didn’t explain the actual reason but as Palace Master said so, he must have his meaning. Everyone only has to follow his instructions.”

The guest elders were unhappy but they didn’t argue.

However, they were only guest elders of Lineage of Star and Lineage of Star couldn’t really restrict them. Although they didn’t say much, it was uncertain if they would follow Jian Wushuang’s instructions.

...

Wushuang City, in the secret room.

Jian Wushuang sat there but then, his face grew grave.

“D*mn it!”

Jian Wushuang roared and he couldn’t help but clench his right hand into a fist to punch the ground.

Although he didn’t use his divine power in that punch, merely his strength of divine body caused a huge pit on the ground. The entire secret room almost collapsed.

“What I worried about the most finally happened!” Jian Wushuang muttered.

What did he worry about the most?

No doubt, it was Green Fire World being exposed to the outsiders.

One should know that the battlefield that Green Fire World was located on was a great opportunity and treasure.

Green Fire World was at the core of the battlefield and it was nurtured from the battlefield. On top of that, the ancient battlefield had started to transform over recent years.

Just how great was Green Fire World’s value?

When Emperor God Xie Xin found out about Green Fire World, he immediately wanted to conquer it and charged there straight away.

It was because Emperor God Xie Xin didn’t know the value of Green Fire World and the ancient battlefield entirely yet.

If he were to really know, he believed that even a Great Emperor would absolutely go crazy as well.

Over the years, he had been extremely cautious and worked hard to grow Green Fire World with his all. He himself had been trying hard to cultivate and increase his power. That was because he knew that the secret of Green Fire World would be exposed one day. He hoped that he could be standing on the peak of the universe before the secret was exposed. Then, he would be able to protect Green Fire World so that all forces wouldn’t dare to lay a finger on it.

But then, although he was extremely close to that step, he was slightly off after all.

At such a crucial moment, the secret of Green Fire World exposed...

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang moved and left the secret room.

At the same time, he sent messages to all higher-ups in Green Fire World – Jian Nantian, Wang Yuan, Su Rou, Palace Master Yun and so on – to call for a discussion.

Very soon, all higher-ups in Green Fire World, including the rulers of the nine top forces, had gathered together.

Jian Wushuang sat in front of these people.

“Father, how did the probing of the surrounding battlefield by Green Fire World go?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s not bad,” Jian Nantian reported, “As Green Fire World continues to grow, there are more and more experts who wander in the surrounding battlefield. In terms of newly-found special places, there are more than a dozen types of them. Among the special places, there are many that still have yet to be explored in-depth.”

“You know that Green Fire World is located on a huge skull and right in between the eyebrows of the skull. Over the years, the experts from Green Fire World explored more than half the skull and they drew a detailed Star Map. As for the places outside the skull, we have yet to venture in as it is too far away.”

Jian Wushuang nodded faintly then he said solemnly, “Send down my command. Tell all experts who are wandering in the ancient battlefield to return to Green Fire World. On top of that, prohibit anyone from wandering in the ancient battlefield.”
