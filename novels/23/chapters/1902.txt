Chapter 1903: The Birth of The Strongest Trump Card

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Merely a standing, without any substantive action. When the war exploded, Almighties Alliance wouldn’t provide any assistance.

What was the use then?

“Hall Master Yuan, you can’t put it that way,” Emperor God Xiu Luo stood up, “We Almighties Alliance are the strongest out of all three alliances. The number of our Almighties is more than one hundred. With such power, merely declaring our standing is sufficient to make the two alliances have scruples and not take action hastily.”

“It’s good enough to be able to do so.”

“We Almighties Alliance only want to save some trouble. If Lineage of Star were to not agree, what if we Almighties Alliance took the two alliances’ side?”

“Merely the existence of Star Extermination Alliance and Supreme Ten Alliance has already cornered you to such a state. Relying on the grand formation of Milky Way, you can only be protected temporarily. If we Almighties Alliance were to join them… Humph, by then, without attack superposition formation, over two hundred Almighties from three alliances will attack simultaneously, your tortoise shell definitely can’t withstand it either.”

Emperor God Xiu Luo’s voice was cold.

To him, the visit to Lineage of Star was only to remove unnecessary trouble.

After all, if the three alliances were to attack at the same time, there would definitely be dispute in sharing of profit. If he could get Secret Skill of Star Palace just by declaring their standing, it was naturally the best situation.

If Lineage of Star were to be smart enough, they would know the pros and cons.

They should also know that they definitely didn’t stand much hope if they were to fight three alliances at the same time.

“Emperor God Xiu Luo, are you threatening Lineage of Star?” Hall Master Yuan’s face grew gloomy.

Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun looked upset too.

“So what if I am threatening you? Lineage of Star has already reached such a situation, so we of Almighties Alliance are willing to give you a last chance. As long as you pass us the inheritance of Secret Skill of Star Palace, it will be done and it is already a great mercy. Otherwise, I will immediately discuss with the other two alliances to join forces together to break your tortoise shell and wipe out Lineage of Star!” Emperor God Xiu Luo’s voice was cold.

“If so, Lineage of Star has to thank Almighties Alliance then? Thank you, Emperor God Xiu Luo, for your mercy?” Hall Master Yuan glared at Emperor God Xiu Luo.

“Of course,” Emperor God Xiu Luo smirked, “Hall Master Yuan, I have said what I want to. There’s no need to talk further. You’d better inform Emperor Sword who is cultivating in seclusion. Let him consider this carefully then reply me.”

“Farewell!”

Then, Emperor God Xiu Luo’s figure shook and his consciousness embodiment dispersed.

Looking at Emperor God Xiu Luo’s consciousness embodiment disperse, the three Hall Masters in the palace looked in distress.

“Ridiculous. Emperor God Xiu Luo is ridiculous!” Hall Master Nie Yun roared.

“He is ridiculous. But Almighties Alliance has the capital to be ridiculous,” Hall Master Gu Xin said in a deep voice, “However, isn’t Almighties Alliance going overboard? They don’t contribute anything to Lineage of Star. They only don’t take action against Lineage of Star, then they want Lineage of Star to pass them the inheritance of Secret Skill of Star Palace?! Even if they want to gain with little pain, this is basically nothing! They are obviously looting a burning house.”

“Regardless, the terms are laid on the table. There is no space for negotiation. As for the final decision, let Palace Master do it,” Hall Master Yuan was calm.

Immediately, Hall Master Yuan sent the content of his conversation with Emperor God Xiu Luo to Jian Wushuang.

In Sword Star, in a secret room, Jian Wushuang continued to cultivate in seclusion.

After two hundred and fifty years of cultivation, Jian Wushuang had reached the most crucial period.

In his body, there was an enormous, strange strength concentrating in him madly.

The power was power of Star!

Power of Star was strange and contained great power. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Then, the power of Star in Jian Wushuang’s body was transforming.

Yes, it was transforming.

The transformation lasted for a very long time and it was very slow.

Jian Wushuang had already continuously transformed for over a decade.

Finally, the transformation of power of Star completed.

“The third volume of Secret Skill of Star Palace… Completed!”

The very moment when his power of Star completed its transformation, Jian Wushuang opened in his eyes. In the depth of his eyes, there was a strange light that burst out.

The light seemed to contain the entire boundless star.

Secret Skill of Star Palace was a secret skill of Seven Star Black Sect.

The secret skill was extremely powerful.

Just like the danger that Lineage of Star was facing, it was mainly because of the secret skill.

The attraction to the secret skill by all forces and experts in Eternal Chaotic World was too great.

However, due to its attraction power, it showed its scariness.

Secret Skill of Star Palace was put into three volumes!

The first volume allowed one to multiply one’s attack power by ten times for ten breaths’ time!

The second volume allows one to multiply one’s attack power by a hundred times for one breath of time!

The second volume’s ability to multiply one’s attack power by a hundred times was already unbelievable.

The reason why the Master of Star Palace was so scary was because he had cultivated the second volume. Plus, because there was an existence of a drop of unique blood essence, he could last for a long time after he performed the secret skill.

He could massacre and stop at nothing. Unless one was a Great Emperor, no one could stop him.

The second volume was as such. Then, the third volume…

The third volume allows one to multiply one’s attack power by a thousand times but they could only perform one move!

It was the strongest volume in Secret Skill of Star Palace. Although only one move was allowed, a multiplication of power of a thousand times was terrifying enough.

However, it was extremely difficult to cultivate it.

Jian Wushuang had heard that only the Master of Star Palace was the only one who had cultivated the third volume of Secret Skill of Star Palace in the whole of Lineage of Star.

The rumors spread among deacon elderlies because they had thought the Master of Star Palace had created the Secret Skill of Star Palace. Hence, the Master of Star Palace had cultivated all three volumes of them,.

But in actual fact, Jian Wushuang was sure that the Master of Star Palace hadn’t cultivated the third volume, only the second volume.

In the entire Lineage of Star, ever since the Secret Skill of Star Palace started, no one had cultivated the third volume.

But then… Jian Wushuang had cultivated it!

Although there were many twists and turns in the journey, Jian Wushuang had studied carefully for a very long time. Even he thought he would at least need to breakthrough and become an Almighty before he could cultivate the third volume of Secret Skill of Star Palace successfully. But who knows, he had yet to breakthrough and merely at the peak of Real God, he had already cultivated the third volume of the secret skill successfully.

Lineage of Star was facing a great danger. To be able to cultivate the Secret Skill of Star Palace successfully, it was too important for Jian Wushuang.
