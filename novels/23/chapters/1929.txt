1930 In Peace

Although Jian Wushuang was confused, he didn’t bother to think about it further.

“Sword Emperor, everything is settled and I shall bid you farewell,” Purple Moon Emperor said.

“Thank you, Great Emperor, for helping. Jian Wushuang and Lineage of Star will remember this,” Jian Wushuang expressed his gratitude.

“Haha, don’t mention it,” Purple Moon Emperor let out a hearty laugh, then he turned to leave.

As for Qian Mingzi, he naturally followed Purple Moon Emperor.

“Hall Master Yuan,” Jian Wushuang looked at Hall Master Yuan by the side, “Send down an order. Tell the experts of Lineage of Star to take back Star Land.”

“Yes,” Hall Master Yuan nodded.

“Palace Master, how about the two alliances?” Hall Master Nie Yun asked.

“The two alliances retreated and the war has ended for now,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“Ended? We are letting the two alliances off the hook just like that?” Hall Master Nie Yun’s eyebrows were tightly knitted and there was obviously reluctance in their eyes.

Hall Master Yuan and Hall Master Gu Xin were upset too.

Although Lineage of Star had won a great victory in the war, the two alliances weren’t wiped off.

“Could it be because of Sanctuary Alliance?” Hall Master Yuan turned to look at Jian Wushuang.

“Not only because of Sanctuary Alliance, but also because Eternal Chaotic World isn’t peaceful for a while,” Jian Wushuang said calmly, “I have already reached a mutual agreement with Emperor Bai. Lineage of Star will stop fighting with the two alliances for now. After some time, when Eternal Chaotic World regains its stability, we will fight with them again.”

“I understand,” Hall Master Yuan nodded.

“Go ahead,” Jian Wushuang waved, “Although the two alliances aren’t wiped out, Lineage of Star has survived the war and our danger has been resolved.”

“The skies clear up after a storm!”

“After this war, Lineage of Star will reach a brand new level after all!”

“Most importantly, from today, there won’t be anyone in Eternal Chaotic World who dares to cast greedy eyes over the Secret Skill of Star Palace in Lineage of Star. Lineage of Star will truly be in peace now!!”

…

Sanctuary Alliance and all forces in Eternal Chaotic World had been watching after Lineage of Star and the three alliances.

On the day when the three alliances finally fought with Lineage of Star.

At first, almost everyone was certain that Lineage of Star would be destroyed and wiped out.

Without a chance to struggle.

However, when the end result was announced, everyone found it unbelievable.

The three alliances had been defeated!

They were crushed!

Star Extermination Alliance, who had attacked first, were defeated by Lineage of Star. There were almost seventy Almighties of them but only less than twenty survived in the end!

Supreme Ten Alliance did slightly better. Although quite a number of their Almighties were killed in the process of running away, it was much better compared to Star Extermination Alliance.

The most tragic one would be Almighties Alliance.

Almighties Alliance, that was made of more than a hundred Almighties, should be the strongest among all three alliances. But in the end, Almighties Alliance vanished into thin air. All experts had died and not one survived.

Unbelievable!

The result was entirely beyond one’s expectation.

Even the Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance didn’t expect it would be so.

Of course, the process of the war was gradually announced.

Lineage of Star displayed their terrifying power and the true power of Universe Galaxy.

Especially Jian Wushuang’s shocking stroke.

“One stroke destroyed the entire Almighties’ Alliance? Is that a joke?”

“Hundreds of Almighties were massacred by Sword Emperor’s one stroke!!”

“That’s too scary. Sword Emperor is so scary. He’s simply a demon.”

Countless people were astonished.

They yielded because of the terrifying stroke that Jian Wushuang had revealed.

Then, Great Emperor came personally to wipe out everything.

Just as Jian Wushuang was in a desperate situation, a mysterious expert suddenly took action.

With one glance the boundless darkness dispersed.

One stroke and it shattered Abysmal Saint Master’s defense armor, which led to severe injury of Abysmal Saint Master.

If it wasn’t because Abysmal Saint Master wasn’t qualified enough, he would be long dead in the person’s hands.

Then, Emperor Bai came personally and had an exchange of blows with the mysterious expert.

Hundreds of millions of miles vanished. Such a terrifying scene struck fear into everyone.

No one expected that the war that was originally suppressed, the war that had no suspense, suddenly had had such a drastic change from nowhere.

But, regardless of the process, the result was confirmed.

After the war, everyone understood that there was no one in Eternal Chaotic World that could pose a threat to Lineage of Star.

The people who harbored deep-seated resentment and cast greedy eyes over Secret Skill of Star Palace, no matter how great their resentment or their greed was, they wouldn’t dare to attack Lineage of Star.

Just like the two remaining alliances, they immediately retreated to their old lair after the war and didn’t dare to attack Lineage of Star again. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Such a scene reminded people of Master of Star Palace’s massacre when he was cornered by various forces many years ago.

Back then, because of the Master of Star Palace’s massacre, the forces in Eternal Chaotic World had been deterred.

As long as the Master of Star Palace was alive, there were no forces who dared to attack Lineage of Star.

But then, the war played an even greater deterrent force to Eternal Chaotic World.

Not only were there more experts that had passed away, but also because of the terrifying stroke that Jian Wushuang performed.

Most importantly, even when a Great Emperor attacked, Abysmal Saint Master, who was a Great Emperor in third place, left with a severe injury.

Who would have the guts to move Lineage of Star?

Just as all forces were still astonished, the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance showed the changed on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

On Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list,?there was no change for the top fifteen Great Emperors.

Everyone knew about the mysterious expert that had appeared in the war, Emperor Thirteen.

However, because Emperor Thirteen was too mysterious and his background was too unique, even though he was on par with Emperor Bai or even more powerful than Emperor Bai, he wasn’t listed on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

On the contrary, the ranking below the Great Emperors were drastic.

There was no choice. There were too many experts that had died in the war in Universe Galaxy. There were many Emperor Gods from Almighties Alliance that were killed by Jian Wushuang. Hence, the change was drastic.

Then, the ranking below Great Emperor on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list was as such.

The sixteenth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list was still Underworld God!

There was no doubt about it.

Even though, regardless of if it were Jian Yi or Emperor God Tian Ling, they had displayed fighting power that could be compared to Underworld God favorably, they had never fought after all. On top of that, Underworld God was widely acknowledged previously. If there wasn’t any battle achievement, it wouldn’t change Underworld God’s ranking.

The seventeenth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list was… Jian Wushuang!
