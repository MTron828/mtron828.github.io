4887 Only One Step Away From Sword Immortal

Everything was destroyed, and even the void was destroyed.

One must know that this was a Heavenly Region in the Great Yan Domain. Every Heavenly Region was permeated by the laws of the Heavenly Dao, and its toughness was enough to support a battle between Yan Immortals and Grand Yan Immortals.

But now, they were all destroyed.

The entire Six Heavens Realm was protected by Di Qing’s Yan power.

Some of the Yan Immortals who did not manage to dodge in time were also completely annihilated by this Sword Dao.

This sword strike was too powerful, it could cut the sky, destroy Domains, and destroy the enemy. It was as if no Yan Immortal could block this attack, not even a Grand Yan Immortal!

The vast Sword Intent of the Lake Style lasted for a long time.

The Heavenly Gate was magnificent, and the lake flowing out of it was quiet and peaceful.

Di Qing stared at the scene, and even he felt his heart palpitate.

The endless Sword Dao that stretched like a river finally retreated, and the dilapidated void finally revealed itself slowly.

Jian Wushuang stood still, surrounded by countless Sword Intents. No one dared to look at him directly.

He held his sword with one hand, his eyes indifferent to the extreme.

In front of him, Chang Duoling was still standing, his face a little pale.

“I, I lost? How is that possible?”

Jian Wushuang ignored him and slowly let go of him.

Chang Duoling lowered his head with difficulty, as if he had sensed something.

At his chest, an Invisible Sword surrounded by Sword Intent had pierced through his Immortal body.

The purest Immortal Source was quickly dissipating.

The Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens, the Supreme Treasure that he was proud of, which could block the attack of a Grand Yan Immortal, was also broken by Jian Wushuang.

A single sword strike had exterminated a Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal.

“Ughh… Ah.”

On the eve of his death, Chang Duoling made a move.

He used all his strength to throw the Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavensto Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took it and looked at him calmly.

“Your sword move is too powerful. It would be a pity if you die here… I’d like to see how much chaos you can cause in the Great Si Region.”

After saying these last words, Chang Duoling died!

Like falling stars, he quickly disappeared into the void, leaving no possibility of resurrection.

Jian Wushuang was still standing in the same place. After stuffing the Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens into the Boyang Bowl, a touch of fatigue flashed in his eyes.

Eliminating a Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal in one battle was something that had never happened before.

He was like a lonely Sword Immortal, standing in the void.

Jian Wushuang turned around slowly. As he took a step forward, divine blood gushed out from every inch of his skin!

Then, he fell straight into the endless void like a graceful swan!

The next moment, the Young Emperor and the others all flew up and caught Jian Wushuang, who was covered in blood.

Di Qing slowly let out a breath, turned around, and faced the remaining 200 Yan Immortals, he suddenly spread out his ten-sided wings.

“Let’s do it one way or another, you guys can stay here.”

A belated massacre quietly unfolded.

In the last battle, less than 20 of the 400 Yan Immortals who came to destroy the Six Heavens Realm escaped.

Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal Chang Duoling had also been completely annihilated in this battle.

…

“Argh…”

In the hazy chaos, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes with great difficulty.

His head was heavy, as if he could not remember anything.

In the chaos, he only heard an excited voice reverberating in the hall.

With the sound of hurried footsteps, Jian Wushuang felt many people surrounding him. At the same time, warm liquid dripped into his dry mouth.

The liquid contained an extremely pure medicinal effect, and once it entered his mouth, it restored his meridians.

After repeating this for a long time, Jian Wushuang finally managed to open his eyes.

What he saw was the Young Emperor, followed by Di Qing, Chun Qiu, Chen Qing, and the others, who surrounded him.

“You’re awake, you’re awake. Brother Jian, your Immortal body is truly terrifying. You’ve suffered such a heavy internal injury, yet you’re able to wake up in such a short time.”

Cheng Qing said with a loud voice, his eyes full of admiration.

“It’s good that you’re awake,” the Young Emperor nodded and handed the porcelain bowl to him.

Jian Wushuang took it and drank it up. Then, he asked, “How long have I been sleeping?”

“Less than ten years,” Di Qing crossed his arms and said. “I thought you would sleep for tens of millions of years.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Jian Wushuang clenched his fist. After finding that his Immortal body was fine, he said, “It’s alright. The injury is not too serious. I’ll recover completely after resting for a while.”

Everyone looked at him as if he was a monster.

To be able to kill the most difficult Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal with the power of a Yan Immortal and even recover in such a short time… This could not be predicted with common sense.

Cheng Qing came over again and said excitedly, “Brother Jian, I’m afraid you’re already a Sword Immortal now, right? Ten years ago, I don’t think I could have blocked that sword strike.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang slowly shook his head, “No, I’m afraid I’m still far from a Sword Immortal.”

“It can’t be. Even such a powerful strike can’t break through to the threshold of a Sword Immortal? It’s so difficult.” Cheng Qing was a little shocked.

The so-called Sword Immortal was an illusory level, and this level was not related to the Yan Immortal.

So far, the only Sword Immortal that Jian Wushuang had acknowledged was Ding Baiyi.

He was the real master of the Sword Principle. With just one stroke of the Extinctive Sword, he had shocked Jian Wushuang.

If he wanted to become a Sword Immortal, he might have to use the last Sea Style and merge the entire Star River Lake Sea Sword Styles.

However, Jian Wushuang was now confident that he could definitely fight against Ding Baiyi with the Sword Intent of the Lake Style.

After all, even he himself was amazed by the Sword Intent of the Lake Style.

The Young Emperor pondered for a moment and said, “Then, Brother Jian, have you touched the opportunity of Grand Yan Immortal?”

Jian Wushuang shook his head again, “It’s the same as before. I’ll stop at the peak of the Yan Immortal. I’m afraid it’ll take a long time to reach the Grand Yan Immortal.”

This was the truth. Even though he had comprehended the most powerful sword technique in that earth-shattering battle and killed a Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, he still did not have the opportunity to break through to the Grand Yan Immortal realm.

It was as if the way up had been sealed.

Jian Wushuang guessed that the reason why he did not realize the opportunity to break through to the Grand Yan Immortal was most likely related to his inability to condense the Immortal Source.

If he needed the most basic Immortal Source to advance to the Grand Yan Immortal, he was afraid that he would not be able to advance any further.
