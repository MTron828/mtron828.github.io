Chapter 811: Punishment from the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master, the bald man who was exuding an air of authority, looked around before fixing his gaze on Mr. Wu. “You’re an expert at the top of Step Five of the Eternal Realm, but you almost got yourself killed by a Divine Realm expert. You really know how to give credit to my name, humph!” he said in a deep voice containing power.

Mr. Wu shivered a little and hurriedly replied, “Pavilion Master, I’m sorry for my incompetence, but his strength is extraordinary. He is the most incredible Divine Realm expert I have ever met. He has already killed Elder Lei Xin and he even has a very terrifying Puppet Fighter. I really am no match for him.”

“Humph!”

Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master gave a cold snort and paid no more attention to Mr. Wu. Instead, he turned his slightly angry eyes towards Jian Wushuang.

“Young man, you killed a Guest Elder of my Heavenly Cloud Pavilion and you even tried to kill a second one! You’re quite bold!” he said, his deep voice placed undue pressure upon Jian Wushuang. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang momentarily paled. The pressure on his body was very painful to him. Fortunately, his body was much stronger than those of his peers, or else the pressure would have overwhelmed him.

“Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master.”

Jian Wushuang hastened to open his mouth while speaking in a tone of respect.

Regardless of whether the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master was at odds with him, he was still a Dao Master and worthy of his respect.

“I have a reason for killing Lei Xin. His disciple, Su Ming, betrayed our master and almost caused the extinction of our bloodline. We were sworn enemies. I had to kill him, but Lei Xin stopped me and even tried to kill me for his disciple!” Jian Wushuang said straightforward.

Then he added, “Since he wanted to kill me, I certainly wouldn’t stand for it. And, Mr. Wu came with him to help kill me, so I certainly would not let him off either. Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master, if you were me, you wouldn’t go easy on someone who wanted to kill you, would you?”

“Humph, you’re so sharp-tongued. No matter what reason you have, it is an incontrovertible fact that you killed a Guest Elder of Heavenly Cloud Pavilion!” the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master said coldly.

“But you’re lucky to have met me instead of one of the others.”

The Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master went on, “I’m the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master, a Dao Master, but you’re just a Divine Realm expert. I won’t deal with you personally, but punishment is inevitable.”

“Hand over all the treasures and Divine Gems you got from Lei Xin, then give me another 30,000,000 Divine Gems as compensation. If you do,?I’ll let it go at that.”

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened a little at his words.

Handing over all the treasures and Divine Gems he got from Lei Xin, then another 30,000,000 Divine Gems as compensation?

“Okay, I’ll give it to you.”

Jian Wushuang agreed after pondering for a second. Then he handed out two Interspatial Rings.

“Here are two Interspatial Rings. One was Lei Xin’s, I have not had time to look into. The other contains 20,000,000 Divine Gems and treasures worth around 10,000,000.”

The Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master took the two rings and took a quick glance into them before nodding, “All right, I will not pursue this matter. You can go now.”

“Thank you, Pavilion Master.”

Jian Wushuang breathed a sigh of relief, withdrew the Eternal Realm Puppet Fighter, and then left immediately.

The Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master and Mr. Wu, who stood respectfully there, were alone on the surface of the sea.

Mr. Wu looked at the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master strangely. He knew that the Pavilion Master had always defended his people. Moreover, Lei Xin had a high position in the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion. Now, Lei Xin had been killed. Although he did not wish to kill Jian Wushuang personally because of his identity, he should not have let him go after only requiring 30,000,000 Divine Gems as compensation!

He had never seen such a powerful Divine Realm expert like Jian Wushuang. He had many means and must have extraordinary stuff.

Leaving aside the other things, the Eternal Realm Puppet Fighter was priceless.

However, the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master only asked Jian Wushuang for 30,000,000 Divine Gems. Didn’t he go too easy on Jian Wushuang?

Mr. Wu dared not ask the Pavilion Master these questions, so he kept them in his heart.

“You go back first, I have something to do,” the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master said as he left.

Mr. Wu also left after bowing respectfully towards the direction in which the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master had disappeared.

Outside Cercis Island, above the boundless sea.

There was a skinny silver-haired elder with a hunchback sitting on a purple exotic beast. The purple exotic beast was running freely through the sky, leaping dozens of miles with each step.

With a swoosh, a man appeared beside the purple exotic beast. It was the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master who had just punished Jian Wushuang.

“Lord,” the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master reverently bowed to the skinny elder.

“What? Do you feel that his punishment is too light, so you are dissatisfied with this?” the elder asked, then looked at him with a smiling face.

“Humph, he really is lucky. Without your command, I would have slapped him to death,” the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master said in a low voice.

“Haha, If you had slapped him to death, you would have been in trouble now,” the elder smiled casually and continued speaking, “He is by no means an ordinary person!”

After saying this, the elder squinted slightly and his voice became grave, “His bloodline is extraordinary. He is very weak now, but even I dare not underestimate the potential of his bloodline. As a Divine Realm expert, he possesses such a formidable battle strength. It’s incredible!”

“He is an amazing person. In addition to his own great opportunities, someone like that must have a very capable person behind him. It may be his master or his elder. And that person is definitely one of a few truly mighty people. Even I dare not offend those people.”

The elder took a glance at the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master.

“Besides, did you notice his scarlet magic sword?” the elder demanded suddenly.

“Yes,” the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master nodded, “His strength is not much stronger than Lei Xin’s, but he completely suppressed Lei Xin with his magic sword, and his battle strength suddenly reached Step Six. In my opinion, the sword should be an Emperor Weapon!”

The Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master and the skinny elder had been watching the fight between Jian Wushuang and Lei Xin from nearby.

However, when Lei Xin was killed, the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master did not come forward to stop Jian Wushuang. Only when Mr. Wu was about to be killed did he appear.

“An Emperor Weapon?” the elder nodded, “It is at least an Emperor Weapon, but I can’t tell which level it is at.”

“The accomplishments of the person who made that magic sword has definitely reached great heights in refining weapons. That magic weapon used special means to hide its strangeness. If we had not seen him use that magic weapon to kill Lei Xin, we would have never known its true value. A person who can refine such amazing Emperor Weapons can never be unknown in the Eternal World. With his ability, the person can easily call several powerful Dao Masters to act as his thugs and easily become an overlord as long as he is willing to pay them with an Emperor Weapon.”

“Yes, the person who refined that magic weapon really is powerful,” the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master agreed with him seriously.

“Therefore, it makes sense to only punish him slightly instead of killing him. If you really killed him, huh, do you think you would be able to keep your life after the people behind him found out?” the elder said with a sly smile.

After hearing this, the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master was drenched in cold sweat. He hurriedly said, “Thank you for reminding me, lord.”

“You’re one of my people. Of course I will help you,” the elder replied, “You just punish him a little and he will neither care nor hate you. As long as you don’t bother with him in the future, this matter will be over.”

“I know,” the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master nodded.

“All right, I have been out for a long time. It was interesting to see such an amazing young man, but it’s time to go back,” the elder went on, “By the way, the second master of the Xia Clan will arrive at Cercis Island tomorrow. Greet him for me.”

“The second master of the Xia Clan? The one who is known as the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World?” the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master asked.

Then his face changed and he said, “I wonder if he can beat Swordsman.”
