Chapter 414:

The Horrifying Blood Puppet

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Bang!

A booming sound resounded in the area.

Explosive forces expanded in all directions. Where fists met, squeezing noises were heard, as if the space could not bear the forces.

“Eh?”

Xue Luo looked at the puppet in astonishment.

He felt a slight pain in his arm. His power had always been his biggest advantage and helped him succeed in every battle. Now, in a battle of brute strength, he was hurt while the puppet was unscathed.

The puppet struck two more punches which were as powerful as the first one.

Xue Luo’s eyes were glacial. He waved his hands and ran toward the punches.

Bang! Bang!

Two booming sounds echoed. Xue Luo fell backward several steps while the puppet remained standing where he was.

“Blood Puppet overpowered him!”

Watching from the ground, Jian Wushuang was surprised by the result.

“Xue Luo is a super expert, well-known for his defense. Even someone at Heaven-defying Level can’t hurt him. However, he lost to the puppet in that battle of power. That means the puppet is more powerful.”

In the next moment, Jian Wushuang saw the puppet attack again.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

The puppet rained blows on Xue Luo, like a storm that refused to let up.

The Blood Puppet was unintelligent and attacked his enemy simply by punching and sweeping his legs. However, while his strikes lacked skill, he possessed an overwhelming power that frightened Xue Luo.

With such power and incredibly fast speed, the puppet was definitely as strong as an expert at Stage Three.

As for the puppet’s defense.

It was even more impressive. When the two had collided, Xue Luo had felt pain and numbness. The puppet had been completely unaffected.

The puppet did not have fighting skills but still frustrated Xue Luo with his considerable power.

“I’m less powerful than him.”

“I’m slower in speed than him.”

“I’m even much weaker in defense than him!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

As these thoughts ran through his head, Xue Luo lost all his will to fight.

“Who the hell made this puppet? How could it be so powerful?” He roared in a barely suppressed voice and looked livid.

He did not know that the puppet had been created by Sword Ancestor, a person who could match Three Ancestors. Such a puppet was never meant to be just an ordinary fighter.

“I can’t go on like this.”?Gnashing his teeth, Xue Luo cast a sharp glance at Jian Wushuang, who stood nearby.

Domineering and arrogant, he had bowed to no one in Inner Area.

He had thought that the puppet was an ordinary one and had not taken it seriously. He had tried to dispatch it before attacking Jian Wushuang. He had not expected it to be so strong and that he would fail.

Now, he had no other choice but to change his target to Jian Wushuang.

“Since the puppet is controlled by the boy, killing him will stop the puppet’s attack. Then, his Interspatial Ring and the puppet will be mine.”

Having made up his mind, Xue Luo flashed and turned away from the puppet, heading toward Jian Wushuang.

“Kill him!”?Killing intent surged in his eyes.

As soon as Xue Luo changed his target, Jian Wushuang understood his intention and smirked.

“Though you have a strong defense, you have no chance to kill me at your normal speed.”?Jian Wushuang sneered. From Jian Wushuang’s body, Blood River spread out and covered Xue Luo with Sword Realm.

Repressed by the two techniques, Xue Luo was slowed to a snail-like pace.

He could never approach Jian Wushuang at this speed.

“How could it be possible?”

“I never expected that he has Realm Techniques.”

Xue Luo shot Jian Wushuang an amazed look. Just then, the puppet dived at Xue Luo again.

“Bastard!” Xue Luo looked pale. He was already weakened by the Blood River. Another fight with the puppet would exacerbate his situation.

A short while later, he had sustained scratches all over his body, but he was not badly injured.

He gazed at Jian Wushuang and the puppet from a distance in the void.

Noticing that the puppet’s breath had weakened, he realized that its store of energy from the Blood Gem was depleted.

“Boy, without your puppet, what else can you rely on to fight me?” Xue Luo scowled and his eyes burned with rage.

“Well, do you really think that I only have one gem to power my puppet?” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly and produced another Blood Gem.

Xue Luo narrowed his eyes.

“Xue Luo, if you want to suffer some more, just try it,” Jian Wushuang said coolly.

Xue Luo’s mouth twitched. Horror filled his eyes when their gaze fell on the puppet.

He was still traumatized from being overpowered by the puppet, who was stronger than him in power, speed, and defense.

“Damn you! All you have is a puppet. Without it, I can kill you as easily as crushing an ant.” Xue Luo raged.

Jian Wushuang sneered. “Even without the puppet, you won’t be able to stop me if I want to escape.”

Xue Luo’s countenance changed, and he snorted. “Fine! Boy, you’re lucky that I’m letting you go this time, but there won’t be a second time.”

Xue Luo headed away in fury.
