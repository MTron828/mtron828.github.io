Chapter 684: Dan Yang City

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Dan Yang City, was within the vast territory under the control of the Ancient Sect. It was a very ordinary, small city.

This kind of city was home to many warriors, but few experts. According to the information given to Jian Wushuang, there were many families in the city. Among these families, even the strongest cultivators were only at the novice or intermediate Divine Realm. There were no advanced Divine Realm experts.

Not long ago, a Great Demon named Bing Ji suddenly appeared in Dan Yang City. With immense strength, he quickly overpowered and slaughtered many of the Divine Realm experts from the city. Many families lost both experts and warriors at the hands of Bing Ji. Helpless, these families sought help from the Ancient Sect.

There was a family named He. The He family were among the most respected in Dan Yang City. With three intermediate Divine Realm experts, the He family enjoyed a combined strength unrivaled by other families. However, with only one intermediate Divine Realm expert left, and the deaths of quite a few novice Divine Realm experts, their strength had significantly declined.

Jian Wushuang approached the gate of the large mansion of the He family.

“Who are you?” Demanded one of the two guards that stopped Jian Wushuang.

Without speaking, Jian Wushuang waved his hand as he produced a token. It was the disciple token of the Ancient Sect.

“An Ancient Sect disciple?” The two guards were amazed to see the token. One of them said hurriedly, “Lord, wait a minute, please. I’ll report to our Master immediately.”

With that, the guard turned and headed for the mansion.

There were dozens of people gathered in the large meeting hall of the He family. All doors and windows had been tightly sealed. Taking the lead of the meeting was a grey-haired elder. He was He Yun, the current Master of the He family and the only surviving intermediate Divine Realm expert of the family.

Others were some experts from the He family as well as masters and experts belonging to other families of Dan Yang City.

These families had formed an alliance since Bing Ji appeared in Dan Yang City.

“He Yun, the Bing Ji threatens to wipe out every family in Dan Yang City if we cannot pay a ransom to him of 500,000 Divine Gems within twenty-four hours. What should we do now?” A white-robed, old lady frowned worryingly as her voice echoed throughout the meeting hall, making the atmosphere become even tenser.

“500,000 Divine Gems! He demands too much!”

“500,000 Divine Gems! Ha ha, collectively, the families here have barely been able to accumulate 1,000,000 over the years, and he expects us to pay out 500,000 in one go. Hump!”

“We will not pay, if it comes to a life and death battle, then so be it.”

The Divine Realm Experts present spoke, full of irritation and anger.

500,000 Divine Gems was a fortune to the families of Dan Yang City.

After all, the assets of an Eternal Realm expert would add up to 1,000,000 Divine Gems and most of the superior Divine Realm experts had only a few hundred thousand Divine Gems or so. Due to years of accumulation, these families would be able to offer some gems, but 500,000 Divine Gems was still far more than they could afford.

“Enough! Silence!”

A notably distinguished voice rang out — He Yun sitting at the head of the room finally opened his mouth to speak.”Bing Ji is a true advanced Divine Realm expert, and you all know very well the difference between an advanced Divine Realm expert and an intermediate Divine Realm expert. To put it bluntly, he’s capable of killing all of us in this room single handed. Do you want to fight against him? In doing so, are you not courting death?”

Hearing this, the Divine Realm experts in the hall became silent.

Fight against Bing Ji?

They had tried this before, with little success. In their last encounter, a number of Divine Realm experts had died as well as two intermediate Divine Realm experts from the He family, without Bing Ji being hurt in the slightest.

The gap between intermediate and advanced Devine Realm experts was immense.

“Since he wants Divine Gems, we can give them to him for the time being.” He Yun continued, “I have already sent a message to the Ancient Sect for help. Its expert will arrive soon. When the expert is here, Bing Ji can’t run amuck any more. As for the Divine Gems that we hand over, we can get it back then. The best we can do for the Ancient Sect expert is to ensure that he gets everything he needs.”

“Well said.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Bing Ji may be an advanced Divine Realm expert, but he’s no match for the Ancient Sect.”

“We’ll wait until the expert sent by the Ancient Sect arrives”.

The Divine Realm experts all agreed with He Yun, happily awaiting the arrival of the Ancient Sect expert.

After all, their combined strength would still not be enough to fight Bing Ji, though the Ancient Sect could easily kill him.

“What I fear most is that once we give Bing Ji the Divine Gems, he will immediately flee and the Ancient Sect expert will make a futile trip. At that time, we’ll still suffer, so we must find ways to hold him here until the expert arrives...”

When He Yun was talking, the closed door suddenly swung open and a figure entered the room. It was the guard who came to report.

“How dare you interrupt?” He Yun’s face darkened.

“Master, lords, there’s someone waiting at the door with the disciple token of the Ancient Sect, not only that but it’s an inner disciple token,” the guard blurted out.

“What?” The Divine Realm experts in the hall were at first surprised, and then became ecstatic.

“The Ancient Sect expert has arrived?” He Yun jumped up in excitement. Then he spoke. “Quickly, invite him in.”

“Yes, Sir.” The guard hurried out to invite Jian Wushuan inside.

“Everybody, let us go welcome him in,” commanded He Yun.

Everyone left the hall to welcome Jian Wushuang who was soon visible to this group of Divine Realm experts.

But when they looked closer at Jiang Wushuang...

“Is this a joke?” He Yun, the grand Master of the He family and an intermediate Divine Realm expert, widened his eyes. “S-Skyscraping Realm?!!”

As a Divine Realm expert, he had an uncanny ability of perceiving aura. He instantly recognized the young man in front of him as a Skyscraping Realm cultivator, a fact that would not change even though this young man seemed to be an expert.

“How could they send a Skyscraping Realm cultivator?” The Divine Realm experts present had become faint. They had expected a savior, but instead they got a Skyscraping Realm cultivator...

“Who’s He Yun, Master He?” Jian Wushuang stood in front of this group of experts, and he looked around indifferently.

He Yun’s face had turned pale, his heart sunk. After hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, he answered in a weak voice. “I am.”
