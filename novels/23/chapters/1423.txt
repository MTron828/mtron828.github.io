Chapter 1424: Reincarnation Doctrine!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Jian Wushuang was even more amazed by Duan Lingfeng’s talent after he heard what King of Venomous Worms said.

In Eternal Chaotic World, Universe Gods in the Third Heaven who could comprehend a slight bit of Power of Heaven Way could be considered as a monster among monsters. There weren’t many of them.

However, Duan Lingfeng understood a slight bit of Massacre Doctrine when he was only a Universe God in the Second Heaven. No wonder King of Venomous Worms had complimented him back then.

“The Supreme Four Doctrine, the Nine Heaven God Doctrine… either one of them would be extremely difficult to grasp. However, Lineage of Star lives up to its name of overlord in Purple Moon Sanctuary. They made great efforts to create a river solely with the Power of Heaven Way. The River of Heaven Way included the Supreme Four Doctrine, the Nine Heaven God Doctrine. When you’re in the river, you can feel these Powers of Heaven Way clearly!”

“The clearer you can feel them, the easier you will be able to comprehend them.”

“The Real God Hall deserves to be the most precious land of opportunities in Lineage of Star. It’s too useful,” the King of Venomous Worms sounded surprised.

Obviously, even with his broadness of vision, he had never seen such great effort and such an amazing place for comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way.

“Jian Wushuang, the Real God Hall has an unforeseeable benefit to you. You only have a month’s time. Don’t waste it. Use the time to understand,” King of Venomous Worms said in a hushed voice.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He had found out the existence of the Supreme Four Doctrine and the Nine Heaven God Doctrine. After Jian Wushuang had found out that Duan Lingfeng took the leap because he comprehended a slight bit of Massacre Doctrine, he yearned for the Power of Heaven Way.

But Real God Hall was the best place to comprehend the Power of Heaven Way. It shouldn’t be missed.

In the river that was made up of the Power of Heaven Way, Jian Wushuang sat down. He closed his eyes and felt the Power of Heaven Way surrounding him.

Jian Wushuang felt that parts of the Power of Heaven Way were extremely familiar.

“The strength should be the Power of Space, right?” Jian Wushuang felt one of the strengths.

That was the strength that made him feel extremely familiar.

One should know that one of the three Strongest Sword Principle that Jian Wushuang opened up was the Spacetime Sword Principle and it involved the Power of Spacetime.

He understood the Power of Spacetime to a certain level but it had not involved Heaven Way yet.

But then, he felt the Power of Spacetime in the river of Heaven Way.

“Spacetime Doctrine was one of the Four Supreme Doctrine!”

“Out of the Four Supreme Doctrine and the Nine Heaven God Doctrine, the former is slightly longer and more difficult to understand. The latter is the reverse. However, overall, it isn’t much different.

“Jian Wushuang, if you were to find that you were more familiar with the power of Spacetime, it would mean that you’re more suitable to comprehend this doctrine but not those that you don’t find familiar. You will find it rather difficult to comprehend them,” the King of Venomous Worms’ voice was heard in Jian Wushuang’s head.

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly, “If merely based on intimacy, I feel that there are two Heaven Ways that I found closest to me. One is Spacetime Doctrine while the other unique strength should belong to Reincarnation Doctrine.”

Reincarnation Doctrine – it involved reincarnation!

Among the three Strongest Sword Principles that Jian Wushuang had opened up, there was a Reincarnation Doctrine!

Besides, the most important part was that he had just passed his second Inverse Cultivation Test and had experienced the Nine Lives Reincarnation Test!

He had just experienced the Nine Lives Reincarnation Test and his understanding of reincarnation was beyond anyone’s comparison.

Then, he could feel the surrounding Power of Reincarnation and he realized that he was comprehending the Reincarnation Doctrine. He found it even easier than the Spacetime Doctrine.

“The Four Supreme Doctrine and the Nine Divine God Doctrine… the easiest should be the Reincarnation Doctrine,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“If so, what are you waiting for? In this one month, seize the time and spend all your effort in understanding the Reincarnation Doctrine. As for the Spacetime Doctrine and the others, you can put them aside for now,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded as he understood himself.

He could only enter Real God Hall once and he could only stay for one month on each visit. Hence, the time was extremely precious.

If he were to be distracted and try to comprehend both Reincarnation and Spacetime Doctrine at the same time, one month would obviously be insufficient.

He might as well focus entirely on Reincarnation Doctrine only.

In Real God Hall, Jian Wushuang had already started comprehending the doctrine wholeheartedly.

“Reincarnation…”

“The combination of Yin and Yang, the life and death cycle, it is reincarnation…”

Half a month flew past.

“It’s done!”

Jian Wushuang sat in Real God Hall and he suddenly opened his eyes. There was excitement in his eyes. Along with a clap of his hands, a unique strength slowly gathered.

The strength, it was the Power of Reincarnation!

“Reincarnation Doctrine, beginner?” King of Venomous Worms found it unbelievable, “How could it be so easy?”

King of Venomous Worms was astonished.

“King of Venomous Worms, didn’t you say it would be extremely difficult to understand the Power of Heaven Way? But why…” Jian Wushuang was surprised too.

He never thought that he could understand the Reincarnation Doctrine so quickly and so easily.

In just half a month’s time, he had mastered a slight bit of Power of Reincarnation.

Although the Power of Reincarnation was weak, Jian Wushuang had actually become a beginner on Reincarnation Doctrine.

“Luck!”

King of Venomous Worms complimented, “Back when you opened up Reincarnation Sword Principle, you already possessed the basis of comprehending Reincarnation Doctrine. However, you’re lucky that you happened to experience Nine Lives Reincarnation Test during your second Inverse Cultivation Test. After you experienced Nine Lives Reincarnation Test, your understanding of reincarnation was far beyond anyone else’s. Besides, you’re in Real God Hall and you get to feel the Power of Reincarnation clearly… Most importantly, you are a quick learner.”

“Thanks to all of that, you comprehended one bit of Power of Reincarnation within half a month!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Half a month. Tsk tsk. If the others were to find out that it only took you half a month from getting in touch with Heaven Way to mastering the Power of Reincarnation, they would definitely be jealous!”

“One must know, in Eternal Chaotic World, there were many Real Gods that spent a long time and invested great effort but couldn’t grasp the Power of Heaven Way!”

“Well, comparing one to another does piss people off!”

Hearing King of Venomous Worms’ compliment, Jian Wushuang smiled.

“I just mastered a slight bit of Power of Reincarnation and I am considered only a beginner in Reincarnation Doctrine but there is a space for improvement. For the remaining half of a month, I have to use the time to improve the mastery of Power of Reincarnation,” Jian Wushuang thought and continued to comprehend the doctrine.

The one-month time limit was over really soon.
