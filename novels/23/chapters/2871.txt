Chapter 2872: Beginning the Refinement

——

“Easily killing the four Peak Great Divine Masters that I placed beside Hong ‘er, killing the Black Blood Emperor, and even surviving my attack, killing Hong ‘er in the end!”

“Good, good! It’s very good in front of everyone!”

Realm Master Tian Qu clenched his hands tightly, but his body was trembling in anger.

“Hong ‘er, just you wait. I’ll avenge you soon!”

Realm Master Tian Qu growled. Soon, he moved directly toward the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City.

…

After killing Young Master Qu and the others, Jian Wushuang left as fast as he could.

In the void, Jian Wushuang was checking the treasures in the interspatial rings of Young Master Qu and the others.

It had to be said that Realm Lord Tian Qu really doted on Master Qu. Master Qu was only a Senior Great Divine Master, but his wealth was much higher than that of an ordinary Invincible Divine Master. Just the ready-made saint elixirs alone… he had 300,000 of them, as well as various resources and various magic weapons and treasures. They were also extremely valuable.

As for the Black Blood Emperor, although he was an Invincible Divine Master, his wealth was much lower than Master Qu’s. However, he still had more than 100,000 saint elixirs and a lot of resources and treasures.

In addition to the wealth of the four Great Divine Masters, Jian Wushuang had obtained 500,000 saint elixirs and countless resources and treasures. Unfortunately, these people, including Master Qu’s interspatial ring, did not have any particularly valuable treasures, there was no treasure that was so precious that Jian Wushuang was moved or useful to him.

Jian Wushuang could do nothing about it.

Now, he has a lot of treasures, and the level is very high, ordinary treasures, for him, really has no attraction.

“I got two million sacred elixirs from brother Mo. after absorbing all of them, not only did I break through to the elementary Divine Master level, but I also accumulated more than half of my divine power. Now, I have 500,000 sacred elixirs. If I devour all of them, although I still can’t break through to the Advanced Divine Master level, my divine power will improve a lot and I’ll be one step closer to the Advanced Divine Master level.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Although killing Young Master Qu and the others would cause him some trouble, and he might even be hunted down by the Tian Qu Realm Lord, it was a good deal for him to get so many sacred elixirs at once.

Jian Wushuang was in deep thought when suddenly…

“Jian Yi, my friend.” A message was transmitted to him.

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed, and he immediately took out a token.

This token was given to him by Mo Tao, the number one blacksmith in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, who had already reached the eighth grade.

“Brother Mo, are you looking for me today to start refining that domain-type holy treasure?” Jian Wushuang’s voice carried a trace of joy.

“Haha, you guessed it right, my friend. Over the past ten years, I have completely recovered my mind, and I have also consolidated my breakthrough in the weapon-refining realm. Now everything is ready, and I can start refining. If you are not busy, you can come to my Fire Cloud Castle. If you can’t leave, it doesn’t matter. After I have finished refining, you can come and take it.” Mo Tao smiled, his attitude was extremely warm and amiable.

“Well, I’ll come over now.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He immediately left for Fire Cloud Castle.

When he came back to fire cloud castle, Bi Yan had already received the news and was waiting outside. When Jian Wushuang arrived, Bi Yan quietly brought Jian Wushuang into Fire Cloud Castle and came to Mo Tao.

“Brother Mo.” Jian Wushuang laughed heartily.

“My friend Jian Yi, it’s been more than ten years since we last met. Your strength has grown. I heard that not long ago in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, you made a name for yourself and even made that Young Phoenix look at you differently?” Mo Tao looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“Brother Mo, you also know about this?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Although he had not made a move in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, his appearance had attracted a lot of attention. After all, he had asked the Young Phoenix to ask his name.

“Mr. Jian Yi, since the Dragon-phoenix list has been opened, the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion has invited our Fire Cloud Castle to attend the ceremony. Although the master was not free and did not go in person, he sent an in-name disciple to go. After he came back, the in-name disciple told me about the matter and then I would pass it on to master,” Bi Yan said.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood.

“Well, my young friend Jian Yi, the main reason for inviting you here is to refine the domain-type holy treasure. But what do you want from this domain-type holy treasure?” Mo Tao asked.

“If you want it… try to make it more powerful and easier to control. Because I know several domain-type methods myself. I hope these domain-type methods can work perfectly with the domain-type holy treasure and complement each other, so as not to repel each other and affect its power,” Jian Wushuang said.

There were all kinds of strange domains in the domain, and even if they were used by the same person, it would be difficult for them not to be repelled.

Jian Wushuang could only try to reduce the repelling.

“I understand. However, the activation of a domain-type treasure will consume a lot of divine power. The higher the level, the more powerful the domain-type treasure will be. If you need a more powerful one, I can do my best. But you also have to consider whether your divine power can keep up with it,” Mo Tao said, he was also giving Jian Wushuang a suggestion.

After all, Jian Wushuang was only a Peak Divine Master. It was not easy for a normal Peak Divine Master to control a domain-type holy treasure, and that was just the ordinary power, if Jian Wushuang wanted the power to be stronger, it would require more divine power.

“Don’t worry about divine power. I have a special constitution, so I have enough divine power,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Mo Tao recalled Jian Wushuang’s blood essence… he knew that Jian Wushuang was not an ordinary person, so he nodded secretly.

“If these are the only requirements, then I can start refining now. However, I don’t plan to use the Holy Heavenly Furnace this time. After all, once I use the Holy Heavenly Furnace, it will cause too much trouble. Last time, when I added the blood essence to the divine sword, it caused a lot of trouble. Many experts came to me, so I spent a lot of effort to get rid of them,” Mo Tao said with a smile.

“Moreover, I am now a genuine eighth-grade blacksmith. Even if I don’t use the Holy Heavenly Furnace, I can still refine a suitable domain-type holy treasure for you.”
