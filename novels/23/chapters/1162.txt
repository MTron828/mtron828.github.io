Chapter 1163: Blind Old Man

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Triple-kill Sword was extremely important to Sword Marquis Mansion.

Jian Wushuang recognized it at once even though the one in the grim-faced young man’s hand was reforged.

“Looks like I found someone to pay for my liquor.”?Jian Wushuang grinned. He then walked up to the young man.

The moment he took the first step, he morphed into someone else.

His scarlet robe was replaced with a rugged sackcloth. He turned into a white-haired and blind old man wearing a pair of torn straw sandals.

He disguised himself as a lonely and blind old man walking on the street alone with a bamboo stick in hand.

The sound of hooves of the Wildebeest Beasts became louder as the group of people neared. The pedestrians made way for them except Jian Wushuang. He slowly walked toward the group as if he did not hear anything.

Soon the group caught sight of the blind old man.

“Hm?”

The disciples riding the Wildebeest Beasts belonged to the younger generation of Sword Marquis Mansion. Several of them showed their anger when they saw an old blind man getting in their way.

“Blind old man! Did you lose your hearing as well as your vision? Get out of the way or our Wildebeest Beasts will stomp on you and turn you into a meat pie,” a green-robed girl next to Jian Xiaoyao said arrogantly.

“Oh?” The blind old man raised his head with a calm look as he came to a standstill.

“Do you want to die? Move!”

She took a long whip from the waist of her Wildebeest Beast and swung it at the old man.

Perhaps the blind old man was in luck. He happened to move to the side and thus, dodged her whip.

“What?” The girl’s eyes burned with fury. She was about to swing her whip again.

“Stop!” The grim-faced young man’s deep and reproachful voice resounded.

“But…” The girl in green turned to look at Jian Xiaoyao.

“Give him some money and ask him to leave,” Jian Xiaoyao said.

“You want me to go?” The girl appeared deeply unhappy.

“Hurry up and do it!” Jian Xiaoyao’s voice turned cold.

The girl dared not to disobey his order. She climbed down from her Wildbeest Beast and walked up to the blind old man.

“Come on. I’ll take you aside,” the girl said impatiently. She subconsciously placed her hand on the old man’s shoulder.

The blind old man snorted. “Which family are you from, little girl? How can you speak to an elder in such a rude manner? Today I’ll teach you a lesson in your elders’ stead.”

He raised his bamboo stick and swiped the girl.

The old man’s action appeared so casual that everyone thought that he was just brandishing the stick as he lectured the girl.

Even a smart kid would be able to dodge the stick, never mind the green-robed girl. She was a warrior in the Spiritual Sea Realm. It would almost be too easy for her to do so.

However…

“Thwack!”

The bamboo stick hit her on the butt without facing any obstacle whatsoever.

The girl could feel the scorching pain on her butt. She instantly flew into a rage.

“You old bastard, I’m going to kill you!” she screamed furiously.

“How disobedient! I’ll hit you again!” The old man once again brandished his stick.

“Thwack!”

The girl took another blow on the same place, making her face turn even redder. This time, however, she reacted calmly.

She stared at the blind old man, somewhat stupefied.

The others were also looking at him with astonishment.

Perhaps it was a coincidence that the girl failed to evade the old man’s first blow. It was another story now that she had been hit twice.

“This… This blind old man…” Surprise took hold of the disciples of Sword Marquis Mansion that were riding their Wildebeest Beasts.

Jian Xiaoyao then got off his Wildebeest Beast and came up to the blind old man.

Jian Xiaoyao apologized to the old man with a sincere, humble attitude. “Please forgive my cousin for she didn’t mean to offend you. She’s still young.”

Unlike the green-robed girl and other disciples of Sword Marquis Mansion, his abundant experience taught him to never judge a book by its cover.

The old man’s two successive attacks might look simple but they had successfully hit their target. He knew that he could not underestimate belittle this old man.

“Instead of moving out of the way of a blind old man walking down the street, you made your cousin ask me to leave. You deserve to be punished as well,” the old man said, pretending to be unreasonable. He waved his bamboo stick again.

He made a simple strike in the manner of a mother punishing her child.

Jian Xiaoyao stared at the stick in alarm and moved out of the way before the old man moved the stick.

“Thwack!”

Jian Xiaoyao was forced to squat. His eyes were full of shock.

The crowd was dumbfounded. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The green-robed girl was a weak 14-year-old. However, Jian Xiaoyao was the genius of Sword Marquis Mansion who had just won the first prize in the Easternmost Hunt.

He was the strongest among the experts of the younger generation of the 10 dynasties.

It was a shock that he suffered a blow as well.

“Boy, are you unhappy with the result? You can come and try it again.” The old man waved at Jian Xiaoyao with a sly smile on his face.

“Elder, please advise me,” Jian Xiaoyao said with a serious expression. Instead of anger, his eyes were filled with strong excitement.

The Triple-kill Sword appeared in Jian Xiaoyao’s hand. Jian Wushuang took a deep breath.

Jian Xiaoyao brandished his sword.

The sword moved as slickly as if it was a spiritual snake slithering through the Void.

“How fast!”

“Too fast!”

“Is this the true strength of the champion of the Easternmost Hunt?”

The warriors could not help exclaiming when they saw Jian Xiaoyao’s performance.

But all of a sudden…

“Thwack!”

The Triple-kill Sword flew out of Jian Xiaoyao’s hands. The seemingly powerless bamboo stick struck him and he felt a stinging pain.

“How is this possible?”?Jian Xiaoyao was stupefied.

“He didn’t use his Spiritual Power at all! His power is as weak as that of an ordinary human and his attack is excruciatingly slow too! How did I end up losing?”

Even as Jian Xiaoyao doubted himself, the excitement in his eyes became stronger and stronger.
