Chapter 2521: First-Class Divine Demon

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Xiao Tiexin was dumbfounded.

Everyone knew about the powers within Primordial Stones.

In the Ancient God Domain, many cultivators used Primordial Stones as a currency though there were also some who often used them to restore or enhance their divine powers.

However, the effects were not as significant because the direct absorption speed from those stones was slow for many cultivators. An ordinary Ultimate God might require several days to absorb the powers of just one stone even with his full concentration. It was too time-consuming and most importantly, it consumed a lot of resources. A Primordial Stone was expensive, so it was considered extravagant to cultivate using it.

Xiao Tiexin got to see it with her very own eyes that day.

Jian Wushuang’s divine power absorption speed was phenomenal to her horror. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

She could clearly sense many Primordial Stones around Jian Wushuang had dimmed and turned into ordinary stones.

In just merely an hour, Jian Wushuang had refined around a hundred Primordial Stones.

She finally understood Jian Wushuang borrowed her Primordial Stones to absorb and refine the powers within.

Jian Wushuang chose to do it after the remaining Xueya Escort members had left as he was not worried about showing such a scene to Xiao Tiexin.

‘At the speed, I’m afraid that my six thousand Primordial Stones will be completely gone within two days. He had absorbed such a great amount of divine power... Could he possibly advance to the Ultimate God?’ Xiao Tiexin thought.

She was right. Jian Wushuang was indeed aiming to make a breakthrough to a higher level.

However, he was not targeting the Ultimate God level. Instead, he just wanted to achieve the First-Class Divine Demon realm.

Time passed and Jian Wushuang was completely engrossed in the process of absorbing and refining divine powers.

Xiao Tiexin had also quieted down. She wanted to focus on protecting Jian Wushuang from the interference or possibly any bandits that would attack him.

The Primordial Stones around Jian Wushuang continued dimming at an alarming speed. In less than two days, all 6,000 Primordial Stones were completely refined by Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had also smoothly broken through from Second-Class Divine Demon to First-Class Divine Demon!

Of course, the black stone disguised Jian Wushuang’s combat powers and made him appear to have made a breakthrough from the Peak Divine Demon level to the Ultimate God level.

Xiao Tiexin walked over to greet Jian Wushuang.

“Mr. Jian Yi, congratulations!” said Xiao Tiexin with clear amazement on her face.

Before his breakthrough, Jian Wushuang was already able to kill Ultimate Gods and defeated the Demonic Moon Prefecture Governor. She wondered what he could do with his powers after progressing to a higher level.

Truth be told, progressing from Second-Class to First-Class Divine Demon might seem like a small advancement, but for Jian Wushuang this progress caused his strength to have a qualitative improvement.

‘Now, I’m probably unmatched among the High-Level Ultimate Gods such that I can easily defeat or even kill someone like the Demonic Moon Prefecture Governor without even using the Nine Sparkle Stars Armor Technique. I might be able to face off a Peak Ultimate God if I have other trump cards in hand,’ Jian Wushuang was quite pleased with that thought in mind.

“I have made progress in my realm, now it’s time for me to work out my plan,” said Jian Wushuang with his glowing eyes.

“Tiexin, come with me.”

Jian Wushuang took Xiao Tiexin, returned to the Demonic Moon Mountains again, and wandered there.

“Mr. Jian Yi, what on earth do you want to do?” Xiao Tiexin asked suspiciously.

“Don’t worry, you’ll find out later.” Jian Wushuang decided to not reveal it yet.

After what seemed like a lifetime, Jian Wushuang stopped in front of a giant mountain.

“Found it.” Jian Wushuang had a smile on his face with his eyes locked on the mountain ahead.

There were pavilions and palaces on the mountain with a hazy restriction shield enshrouding the area.

“Is this the Demonic Moon Prefecture’s nest?” Xiao Tiexin was taken aback as she commented, “Mr. Jian Yi, are you thinking of attacking their nest?”

“Why not?” Jian Wushuang smiled mischievously.

Xiao Tiexin was stunned.

Jian Wushuang could easily wipe out Demonic Moon Prefecture’s Ultimate Gods before even making a breakthrough. With his newly attained divine powers and strength, he could probably wipe out the entire Demonic Moon Prefecture.

“That’s Demonic Moon Prefecture, one of the Eighteen Prefectures! There are eighteen prefectures deeply ingrained in Dark Thunder Territory having intricate relationships with each other. Your action today might incur the hostility of other prefectures. The other seventeen prefectures will not turn a blind eye, I’m afraid that...” Xiao Tiexin frowned.

“What could happen? Will the other seventeen prefectures join forces and kill me together? They must first be able to find me and obtain the opportunity. As for now, I’m definitely after this Demonic Moon Prefecture. If I don’t do it, where do I get so many Primordial Stones to return your favor?” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

“Mr. Jianyi, those Primordial Stones are nothing but Demonic Moon Prefecture...” Xiao Tiexin wanted to continue speaking.

However, Jian Wushuang waved his hand and interrupted her. “I’ve already decided. You just need to watch me.”

Jian Wushuang was not bothered if his actions would nettle with the Eighteen Prefectures since he had planned to face them off sooner or later.

He had no choice as he needed a lot of Primordial Stones. In fact, he needed heaps of it.

The 6,000 borrowed Primordial Stones from Xiao Tiexin were insufficient as it only allowed him to breakthrough as a First-Class Divine Demon.

Therefore, he had his target set on the Eighteen Prefectures for resources.

Although those Eighteen Prefectures had never rubbed him the wrong side they were still unscrupulous bandits who robbed others. Jian Wushuang was just contributing to society by eradicating these evils.

Xiao Tiexin knew she could not change Jian Wushuang’s mind.

As for Jian Wushuang, he had his eyes locked on Demonic Moon Prefecture at the front as surging divine powers started arising from within him.

The divine powers were obviously stronger than before as it madly condensed behind Jian Wushuang and formed a thousand-foot-tall Golden God Shadow behind his back in the blink of an eye.

Jian Wushuang was performing the Seven Stars Secret Technique.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Several handprints were produced as he wore a grim expression.

“Prison of Punishment!”

Rumbling...

The Heavens and Earth shook as infinite golden divine powers swept across the area, forming a vast ocean of golden divine power that expanded madly in every direction.

The golden divine power ocean was moving fast, abruptly, and continuously expanded wider.

In the Demonic Moon Prefecture’s nest, a large number of bandits within were alarmed by the sudden attack.

A commotion had stirred up in the Demonic Moon Prefecture and quickly turned chaotic.
