Chapter 1110: Life Elixirs

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Following a brief and polite chat, they began to get down to business.

“Celestial Master Jin Qu, the three of us rushed over here on Void Temple Master’s order but we don’t know what has happened. Please tell us the details,” Yi said.

Jian Wushuang, Yi, and Meng Long knew that something must have happened for Void Temple Master to issue such an order.

“Something major did happen. To be precise, a big opportunity has appeared,” Jin Qu answered.

“A big opportunity?” The three of them were surprised.

“Here’s the thing,” Jin Qu explained. “When a Green Fire Palace expert passed by the area lately, he found a Life Elixir.”

“A Life Elixir?” Jian Wushuang became stunned.

Yi and Meng Long also appeared to be confused.

Jian Wushuang was the only one among them who had never studied elixir. Yi and Meng Long knew a thing or two about elixirs but Life Elixirs were foreign to them.

Suddenly, Gu King’s voice resounded in Jian Wushuang’s mind. “Life Elixir is good news for the Green Fire World.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang asked, intrigued.

“Life Elixir is an inimitable elixir and has only one effect. It can help a Dao Master to integrate his existing Dao and condense his Dharma Body.”

“Integrate Daos and condense Dharma Body? Wouldn’t that mean becoming a Celestial Master?” Yi asked in surprise.

“Yes, Life Elixir is an elixir that can advance a Dao Master into a Celestial Master. Moreover, under normal circumstances, one elixir can produce one Celestial Master,” Jin Qu answered.

Jian Wushuang was shocked to hear this.

It was a great challenge for a Dao Master to become a Celestial Master as one would be required to integrate existing Dao to create one’s Dharma Body.

There were a large number of Dao Masters in the Green Fire World, and quite a few of them had reached the top of Rank Three. However, few Celestial Masters had emerged.

Though there were quite a number of Celestial Masters in the Green Fire Palace, they had all arduously improved themselves over time in the Green Fire World for 40 million years.

It was a challenge indeed to produce a Celestial Master.

Yet, Life Elixirs now presented an easy way for a Dao Master to become one.

If this elixir became available in the Green Fire World, all the Dao Masters would go mad over it.

“Though Life Elixirs are extraordinary, they’re useless to us since we’ve reached the level of Celestial Master,” Yi said.

“You’re right that it’s useless to us. In fact, if there’s only one of this elixir, Green Fire Palace wouldn’t have cared. The issue is that there are tons of Life Elixir here!” Jin Qu said seriously.

“Tons of Life Elixir?” the other three asked in surprise.

One elixir would produce a Celestial Master.

Then wouldn’t a bulk of Life Elixirs produce an army of Celestial Masters?

Green Fire Palace would not have cared if the elixir could produce a single Celestial Master. However, if a large number of Celestial Masters was at stake… There were only a hundred Celestial Masters in Green Fire Palace, which was insufficient for their battle against the Jin Kingdom.

With a new group of Celestial Masters, Green Fire Palace would have the ability to directly fight the Jin Kingdom. Perhaps, they could even dominate the battle.

“There are numerous Life Elixirs here but no one knows the exact number. I’m sure there are no less than a hundred of them,” Jin Qu said confidently. “When the Green Fire Palace expert found the Life Elixirs, he informed only Void Temple Master.”

“Void Temple Master then ordered several Celestial Masters nearby to search the area for Life Elixirs. Unexpectedly, when they arrived and were ready to act, Jin Kingdom experts also found the place. Therefore, both sides began searching and fighting for those Life Elixirs.”

“Void Temple Master ordered you three to come after realizing the Jin Kingdom experts found out about it.”

“I see.” The three of them finally understood what had happened.

“Celestial Master Jin Qu, you’ve been here for several days. Did you find any Life Elixirs?” Yi asked.

“I came here 10 days ago with Celestial Master San Jie but we separated to increase our chances of finding Life Elixirs. I found three in the past three days,” Jin Qu answered. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You found three at one go?” Jian Wushuang asked. Jin Qu’s answer surprised them.

Three Life Elixirs could create three Celestial Masters.

Just then…

“Hm?” The three of them felt something.

They had just received news from Void Temple Master through the token.

Void Temple Master told them about Life Elixirs as well as their purpose. He said that a Life Elixir was worth 10,000 Fire Points at the Fire Points Exchange Office.

“10,000 Fire Points for one!”

Yi was stunned but his surprise soon gave way to excitement. He turned to look at Jin Qu in admiration. “Congratulations, Celestial Master Jin Qu! You just earned 30,000 Fire Points.”

“Points that I earned after nearly losing my life. If I hadn’t been lucky enough to meet you three, I would’ve paid for it with my life,” Jin Qu replied.

The three of them exchanged looks before chuckling.

“Not only are these Life Elixirs valuable, but they’re also of great importance to Green Fire Palace. We should try our best to find more,”Yi said. “Why don’t we split up and look for them? Jian Wushuang, you should go alone since you’re the strongest. The three of us will stick together just in case.”

“Sure.” Jian Wushuang nodded as he was used to acting alone.

Meng Long and Jin Qu also agreed.

There were many Jin Kingdom experts here. If they tried searching the way Jin Qu did, they might just lose their Elixirs.

They would be able to put up a fight if the three of them stayed together.

“Then, I’ll be taking my leave.”

Jian Wushuang waved at them before flying off.

Yi and Meng Long waited for Jin Qu to recover a little before setting off to find Life Elixirs.
