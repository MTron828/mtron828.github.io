“Ah!”

A shrill scream suddenly exploded in the void.

Blood Eagle, Violent Bear, and the other leaders immediately looked at the source of the scream. When they saw it, their pupils suddenly shrank.

“Ninth brother!” Blood Eagle was even more furious.

The one Blood Eagle called Jiu was the long-haired brown-haired man who had slashed Jian Wushuang with his saber.

However, at this moment, his eyes were wide open, and his face was full of fear and disbelief.

He slowly lowered his head and looked at his chest. There was a blood-colored divine sword that had pierced through his heart. He could clearly see the cold blade and his blood on the blade.

“I, I…” Before the brown-haired man could say anything, the cold blood poison had already corroded his divine power and his voice disappeared on the spot.

Another leader was killed on the spot.

Jian Wushuang, who had killed the brown-haired man, gave a strange smile. Then he disappeared in front of everyone.

“Be careful!”

“It’s a movement technique. It’s so terrifying that we can’t catch any traces of him. At the same time, he has a very terrifying assassination swordsmanship. He is hiding around us and waiting for the right time to attack us!”

“Quick, find him. If we don’t find him, we will only be targets and be assassinated by him.”

“Find Him? How? Fourth Brother, who is best at soul techniques, has been killed by him. Our soul techniques can’t sense his existence at all.”

Terrified voices sounded one after another.

The remaining leaders of the 13 axes were all panicking.

They had no choice. They were all shocked by Jian Wushuang’s silent assassination technique.

They guessed correctly that what Jian Wushuang was using was an extremely strange movement skill. Of course, it could also be said to be a unique secret skill, he could hide among these leaders silently and wait for an opportunity to attack.

In addition, there was a reason why Jian Wushuang killed the fourth brother who was good at soul skills.

Not only because the Fourth Brother’s soul attacks had been affecting him, but also because he was good at soul techniques. His soul sensing ability and soul searching ability were naturally stronger. With the Fourth Brother’s soul attainments, it was very likely that he could sense his existence, which made it much harder for him to attack.

But now that the Fourth Brother was dead, the remaining people, including Blood Eagle and Violent Bear, could not sense his existence.

These leaders were like living targets in front of him.

Swish!

A cold sword light silently appeared behind one of the leaders. From the moment the sword light flew out to the moment it pierced through the leader’s divine body, it could not make any noise or sound, the leader did not even have time to react before he was pierced by Jian Wushuang’s divine sword and killed on the spot.

Then, Jian Wushuang disappeared again.

“No!”

“Bastard!”

The leaders of the 13 axes cursed in anger, but there was nothing they could do.

Jian Wushuang attacked again and again.

Chi! Chi! Chi!

One by one, the leaders were killed by Jian Wushuang’s sneak attacks. None of them could react in time.

In the blink of an eye, only two of the eight leaders were still standing there.

These two were Blood Eagle and Violent Bear.

They were strong, so Jian Wushuang deliberately left them at the back.

“Bastard!”

“Bastard!”

Blood Eagle and Violent Bear’s eyes were bloodshot. They had been watching their brothers being killed by Jian Wushuang, but they had no way to stop him.

Now, only the two of them were left with the 13 axes.

“Second Brother, be careful. If nothing goes wrong, Heavenly Sword Marquis is going to attack you next,” Blood Eagle said.

“I know.” Violent Bear nodded, but his face was extremely solemn. His nerves had been tense, and his soul power had been spread out to the greatest extent, sensing the wind and grass around him.

Suddenly…

A ghost-like figure appeared beside Violent Bear.

As soon as it appeared, a cold sword light had already pierced toward Violent Bear’s throat. The sword light swept out, but it was still silent and did not cause any movement.

Jian Wushuang’s movement was too strange and quiet. Even though Violent Bear was in a state of full alert, he did not notice Jian Wushuang’s appearance at the first moment. It was when the sword light was attacking him, although the sword light did not cause any movement, there was a slight sound of the sword cutting through the air.

The sound was almost negligible, but Violent Bear, who was nervous, still heard it.

“Over here!”

Violent Bear suddenly turned around, and his violent aura was instantly suppressed. He wanted to block Jian Wushuang’s fatal sword.

But…

“How could it be so fast?”

Violent Bear’s eyes were wide open as he watched the cold longsword pierce through his skin. However, his palm was still two feet away from the sword.

Chi!

The longsword instantly pierced through Violent Bear’s throat. The cold blood venom contained in the sword seed also entered Violent Bear’s body and crazily eroded his divine body. At this moment, 80% of Violent Bear’s divine power was directly eroded, however, 20% of his divine power was still preserved.

Buzz, buzz, buzz. A large amount of divine power began to gather, and violent bear’s divine body wanted to reassemble again.

However, Jian Wushuang directly pointed out.

One finger void annihilation technique!

Boom!

A huge space-time storm suddenly took shape. This space-time storm contained extremely terrifying destructive power, annihilating everything in the space where Violent Bear was. Violent Bear’s divine body did not have time to reassemble at all, the remaining 20% of his divine power had already been completely annihilated by this space-time storm.

An Immortal Saint, Violent Bear, who was infinitely close to being invincible, also died.

“Second Brother, no!”

Blood Eagle’s eyes turned red as he watched from the side.

But everything happened too quickly. It was so fast that he could not stop it at all. Violent Bear had already been killed.

After Violent Bear died, he was the only one left alive.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis!”

Blood Eagle’s voice was as cold as if it came from hell. His eyes were bloodshot and veins popped on his forehead.

Jian Wushuang had just killed his brothers who had lived with him for hundreds of thousands of years.

Jian Wushuang had killed 12 of his 13 brothers!

How could he not be angry at such a great hatred.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang just smiled faintly and said, “Blood Eagle, don’t worry. You will be with your brothers soon.”
