“It’s me.”

The weird elderly with a long golden tail spoke, “However, I don’t like it when people call me Elder Dragon Turtle. My name is?Long Qi. You can call me Lord Long Qi.”

“Yes, Lord Long Qi,” Jian Wushuang greeted politely.

Jian Wushuang behaved rather respectfully when he was talking to a superb expert that could kill him countless times with a snap of his fingers.

“Let’s go. Follow me into the palace to see the master,” Long Qi said.

“The master?” Jian Wushuang’s heart skipped a beat.

From his viewpoint, Long Qi before him was already shockingly strong, but who knew that he would have a master?

Just how strong was his master?

Jian Wushuang gulped and suppressed the fear in him. Then, he followed Long Qi into the crystal palace.

On the way, Long Qi suddenly asked, “Jian Wushuang, where did you learn the Secret Skill of Seven Star?”

“Secret Skill of Seven Star? What Secret Skill of Seven Star?” Jian Wushuang looked confused.

“You don’t know?” Long Qi stole a glance at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang shook his head subconsciously.

There were many secret skills that he had cultivated, but there was not one that was called the Secret Skill of Seven Star.

“You don’t know about Secret Skill of Seven Star, but when you were fighting against the two creatures outside, you performed that secret skill. The secret skill contains the unique power of Stars, If I’m not mistaken,” Long Qi said.

“The power of Stars?” Jian Wushuang stunned and he said, “The secret skill that I performed just now is called the Secret Skill of Star Palace but not Secret Skill of Seven Star.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“What Secret Skill of Star Palace? Who named it?” Long Qi’s face grew upset and there was a pressure that was given out uncontrollably. Jian Wushuang immediately became apprehensive and cautious.

“Such pressure, my goodness…” Jian Wushuang felt bitter.

“Let me ask you, how did you get the secret skill?” Long Qi asked and he reined in his pressure.

Jian Wushuang let out a breath of relief and answered, “Sir, the secret skill is one of the four secret skills of Lineage of Star. It is extremely famous in the Eternal Chaotic World and it was created by the Master of Star Palace from Lineage of Star. Everyone knows that. Why would Lord Long Qi say that it’s Secret Skill of Seven Star?”

“Created by the Master of Star Palace? Hehe, tell me, at what level is the Master of Star Palace?” Long Qi asked with interest.

“The Master of Star Palace is an Almighty and he is a top expert among the Almighties. Of course, compared to you, he is far behind,” Jian Wushuang said.

He was telling the truth. It wasn’t like he had never seen the Master of Star Palace.

Although he had never seen the Master of Star Palace launch an attack with his own eyes, he was sure that the Master of Star Palace couldn’t compare favorably with Lord Long Qi.

“Hehe, he can’t even win against me. How can he create the Secret Skill of Seven Star?”

Long Qi scoffed, “Young man, let me tell you, the secret skill that you cultivated is the Secret Skill of Seven Star that our master of Seven Star Black Sect created personally. The Master of Star Palace that you were talking about earlier, I reckon he got lucky and inherited it from the Seven Star Black Sect Master. That’s why he obtained the secret skill.”

“Seven Star Black Sect?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He had wandered in Eternal Chaotic World for so long and he had joined Sanctuary Alliance. He was considered quite knowledgeable and experienced but he had never heard of Seven Star Black Sect.

However, Jian Wushuang could imagine that a sect that included superb experts like Long Qi and his master, and also created Secret Skill of Seven Star, was definitely a terrifying sect.

If Jian Wushuang wasn’t mistaken, a sect like this should have only existed in ancient times!

“We of Seven Star Black Sect already vanished for so many years. Your so-called Master of Star Palace could get a partial inheritance from Seven Star Black Sect, he is quite lucky. But you’re quite lucky yourself too. You came to the place when master was asleep and triggered the power of Stars, which awakened me. Otherwise… hehe, you might already be dead by the hands of those creatures,” Long Qi chuckled.

“Thank you for coming to the rescue,” Jian Wushuang could tell that Long Qi was the one who had made the whirlpool in the water earlier and brought him into the independent space.

If not, he would definitely still be being chased after by those Star Demons. He might stand a slim chance to escape but he most likely would be killed by the Star Demons.

“Humph, I saw that you cultivated the Secret Skill of Seven Star and seem to be associated with Seven Star Black Sect. That’s why I saved you. However, I can only save you temporarily. As for how you leave in the future, I can’t help much with that,” Long Qi said.

Jian Wushuang smiled but didn’t bother.

Under the lead of Long Qi, Jian Wushuang quickly arrived at the middle of the crystal palace.

The lofty hall had many decorations that were made of crystals. In the middle of the hall, there was a huge crystal coffin floating in the air.

Yes, a coffin.

In the coffin, there was a person lying down serenely.

It was a black-haired man who was taller than five meters and dressed in a luxurious gold robe.

The black-haired man looked gentle and pretty. His demonic prettiness was enchanting.

In terms of appearance, the black-haired man put many beautiful women in Eternal Chaotic World to shame.

“This… this is Lord Long Qi’s master?” Jian Wushuang looked at the coffin before him, dumbfounded. He looked at the black-haired man in the coffin.

The black-haired man was lying down serenely with his eyes closed but there was a shapeless power that was being given out from his body that reigned in Jian Wushuang’s consciousness.

The image changed and Jian Wushuang suddenly realized that he was brought to a huge battlefield out of nowhere.

On the battlefield, a massacre was being carried out.

The sky was tainted with blood. The uppermost heavens were torn with a few cracks forcefully in the battle. From the cracks, there were pillars of water showering down. It was obvious that the sky had holes in it.

On the ground below, there were words that collapsed one after another. Thousands of living things broke around the world and instantly vanished into thin air.

Superb experts with shocking powers passed away in the war one after another. Some experts passed away and their bodies immediately turned into billowing hills or turned into a sea of blood.

Among the experts, a pretty man who was more than five meters tall was letting out roars as unwillingness filled his ears.

The loud roar reverberated in Jian Wushuang’s ears.

“Doomed. Seven Star Black Sect is doomed!”

“Xuan Yi, Xuan Yi!”

“It’s all because of you!!!”

A hysterical roar shook Jian Wushuang and the image shattered. In the crystal palace, Jian Wushuang’s consciousness woke.

At that very moment, his head was empty.
