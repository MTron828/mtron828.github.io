Chapter 593: Returning to the Ancestor’s Land

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“This elixir can regenerate broken limbs. Give it to the little girl.”

Jian Meng’er was stunned. Then she took the elixir and, being surprised and delighted, walked toward the little girl whose arm had been cut off by Fire Ghost.

“Lin’er, take it. Be quick.” Jian Meng’er’s voice trembled as she spoke.

The little girl was crying in pain. And after she swallowed the elixir, her severed arm started regrowing again.

She quickly made a full recovery.

Upon seeing this, Jian Meng’er cried out joyfully as she gratefully looked at her savior. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Jian Wushuang gave her a glance but said nothing, then he went over to Jian Xinhong.

Jian Xinhong, who had fainted because of the aura suppression, had still not regained consciousness.

Jian Wushuang bent over and gave Jian Xinhong an elixir that emitted a light scent.

He had many high-level elixirs, which were his trophies from the Divine Land and Monster Continent.

Jian Xinhong did not wake up, but he looked better after taking the elixir.

Jian Wushuang felt relieved and then stood up, finding his clansmen walking toward him and gazing at him in admiration.

He breathed deeply and said solemnly, “Everyone, I’m back!”

Jian Wushuang quickly helped the Sword Marquis Mansion turn the corner and recover to a normal condition.

Although Fire Ghost had tortured those clansmen for several days, only a few of them got killed, so the Sword Marquis Mansion did not suffer great losses. One day later, Jian Xinhong woke up.

Jian Wushuang sat in the front of the meeting hall accompanied by Jian Xinhong, who looked a bit pale, while those elders, including Jian Meng’er, stood below.

Besides them, experts from the Alchemy School, Di Xi, and Hong Xuzi were also present at the meeting.

“My little friend, Wushuang, when you left, you asked me to take care of the Sword Marquis Mansion, but today... Alas, I’m sorry.” Hong Xuzi sighed.

“I’m also sorry,” said the Sect Master of the Alchemy School, Wang Yan. “Two days ago, our Alchemy School received the news that the Sword Marquis Mansion was in trouble, so I immediately sent a Saint Realm expert here, but I didn’t expect that the enemy would be so powerful. He killed my elder in just a single move.”

It was the truth.

A Saint Realm expert from the Alchemy School had tried to protect the Sword Marquis Mansion, but he was killed by Fire Ghost with only one move.

“Everyone, regarding this matter, I understand. Fire Ghost was the supreme expert in the Divine Land. It’s understandable that you were unable to resist him,” Jian Wushuang said without a hint of blame in his tone.

Upon hearing this, Wang Yan, Hong Xuzi, and the other experts felt relieved.

They had been afraid that Jian Wushuang would vent his anger on them, but obviously, Jian Wushuang was not such a person.

“My little friend, Wushuang, Fire Ghost had forced those clansmen to tell him the location of the Ancestor’s Land. It seems that many people have been targeting the Ancestor’s Land,” said a white-haired elder who had just returned from the Divine Land.

“Right, there are many experts and they’re also supreme beings. But don’t worry,” Jian Wushuang continued in an icy voice, “I’ll go to the Divine Land and kill them all!”

Jian Wushuang was filled with killing intent.

He was remembering all of those experts who had forced him to flee.

After staying there for a day, Jian Wushuang was about to leave.

“Mansion Master, I’ll leave my Blood Puppet in the Sword Marquis Mansion. If anyone attacks our mansion, you can use this Blood Puppet to repel them.”

He had received this Blood Puppet from the Ancestor’s Land. When he had just arrived at the Divine Land, the Blood Puppet had greatly helped him and had saved him several times.

Nevertheless, with the improvement of his strength, the Blood Puppet became almost no use to him.

Jian Wushuang was easily able to kill an Eight-cloud Realm expert, or a sovereign, or even a Skyscraping Realm expert, so there was no need for him to use this Blood Puppet.

It could be a good choice to let this Blood Puppet be the trump card of the Sword Marquis Mansion.

Jian Wushuang also gave Jian Xinhong many Blood Gems, which were enough to activate the Blood Puppet many times.

After everything was arranged well, Jian Wushuang set off.

Jian Wushuang did not return to the Divine Land, but instead, he went to the Ancestor’s Land.

The abyss in the Innumerable Huge Mountains!

Although Jian Wushuang had been here many times, he had never perceived anything special and only felt that the abyss was mysterious because he had been weak at that time.

However, this time, he was able to see it through with only one glance.

“This abyss is actually a Formation?” Jian Wushuang was astonished, but he immediately realized that this Formation was aimed at avoiding the exploration from other experts.

“This Formation is exquisite. If I had not visited here several times and learned its secret, I would not have found out that the Sword Ancestor’s cave mansion was in the abyss. I might have thought that it’s only an ordinary dangerous place.”?Jian Wushuang sighed.

The Skyscraping Realm experts who killed the Sword Ancestor almost turned the plane world over searching for the Sword Ancestor Cave Mansion.

They had also launched a search in the Nanyang Continent, but they gained nothing because of the protection of this Formation.

Jian Wushuang stepped into the abyss without a second thought.

The moment he landed on the Ancestor’s Land, the two Puppet Fighters, Jin Ling and Mu Shan, walked over.

“Jian Wushuang, hmm, this is...”

Jin Ling and Mu Shan stared at Jian Wushuang with an odd expression.

They could tell that compared to several years ago, Jian Wushuang had greatly changed.

They were not clear about how many changes that he had made, but they knew that the young man was now much more powerful than before.
