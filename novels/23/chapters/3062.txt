Chapter 3064: The Junior Divine Sect

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

When he was in the endless territories, Jian Wushuang had carefully read all kinds of information about the Third Heaven, including the various sects and powers in the Third Heaven.

For example, the most famous sects in the First Heaven were the Three Pavilions, the nine courtyards, and the twelve Divine Sects!

They were the top sects in the First Heaven. Of course, the sects and powers in the First Heaven were far more than these. There were even some powerful sects that were comparable to the twelve Divine Sects and the nine courtyards, however, they were not that famous.

Jian Wushuang knew about the Young Divine Sect because it was one of the twelve Divine Sects!

The Young Divine Sect was able to become one of the twelve Divine Sects because it had once given birth to a Principles Master.

“I’ve just arrived at the First Heaven. Although I’ve read some information here, I’ve never experienced the real environment. The Young Divine Sect is one of the twelve Divine Sects. It’s a good place for me to stay and familiarize myself with the environment,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself, he had already made up his mind.

“Okay, I’ll go with you to the Young Divine Sect,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Haha, that’s great. Let’s go now.” Jiu Luo seemed very excited.

Jian Wushuang and Jiu Luo immediately set off together.

The First Heaven was very big and boundless.

There were many countries in the First Heaven. Each country had its own emperor. However, these countries all submitted to the sects, such as the Three Pavilions, the nine courtyards, and the twelve Divine Sects, they all occupied many countries.

Among them, the Young Divine Sect had 81 countries, which were extremely powerful.

Jian Wushuang and Jiu Luo had already obtained the Star Map of the First Heaven. They also knew about the existence of some spatial passageways. It only took them a short time to pass through the spatial passageways, they had already arrived in front of the Young Divine Sect.

“That’s the Young Divine Sect.”

Jiu Luo stood high in the void and looked at the ancient sect that occupied a huge territory in front of them.

The sect was completely covered in a layer of faint purple fog. The entire sect seemed to be faintly discernible and extremely strange.

If one closed their eyes, no one would even think that there was a sect there. Instead, it seemed to be an empty void.

“The time and space where the sect is located is very special.” Jian Wushuang stared at the ancient sect in front of him. He had a feeling that the ancient sect seemed to be out of place with the surrounding time and space as if the two were in different time and space.

Jian Wushuang had felt this strange feeling from Mo Shan, the senior of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces.

“If I’m not wrong, the reason why I have this special feeling is because of the secret realm of heaven and earth.” Jian Wushuang’s expression darkened. “It’s not surprising that the Young Divine Sect doesn’t exist in this space-time, but in the heaven and earth secret realm created by an expert!”

The heaven and earth secret realm was created by a Principles Master.

The heaven and earth secret realm was extremely strong and could store many things. It was normal for a rule master to put his sect in his own heaven and earth secret realm, if the secret realm of heaven and earth was complemented by a powerful formation, even some powerful Principles Masters would not be able to shake the sect.

After all, it was very difficult to destroy a secret realm of heaven and earth with the support of a formation.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, let’s go down,” Jiu Luo said.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

The two turned into two long arcs and rushed toward the gate of the Young Divine Sect.

There were more than ten people guarding the huge gate, including some True Saint experts.

Jian Wushuang and Jiu Luo were immediately stopped when they landed in front of the gate.

“Who are you? What are you doing in the Young Divine Sect?” A True Saint stared at Jian Wushuang and Jiu Luo coldly.

Jian Wushuang looked indifferent, Jiu Luo said, “My name is Jiu Luo. I just came from the endless territories. As for my purpose...I met a senior named Su Qianqiu from the Young Divine Sect a long time ago. He gave me an opportunity and said that I would come to the Young Divine Sect to take him as my master after I reached the Immortal Saint Realm. This is the token he gave me when he left.”

Jiu Luo took out a token. It was just an ordinary token, but it contained a special aura.

The True Saint took the token and looked at Jiu Luo in surprise. “You’re Elder Su’s disciple? Elder Su has a strange temper and is always in closed-door cultivation. I’ve never heard of him having any disciples.”

“I’m not sure either, but it’s been three thousand years since Elder Su gave me the opportunity,” said Jiu Luo.

“Alright, wait here for a while. I need to confirm it first,” said the True Saint.

“No problem.” Jiu Luo smiled and waited in front of the mountain gate.

Not long after, a middle-aged man in a loose robe walked out.

“Deacon Wan.”

Upon seeing this middle-aged man, the people guarding the mountain gate all bowed respectfully.

In the Young Divine Sect, Deacon was second only to elders, and their status was extremely high.

“Who is Jiu Luo?” The middle-aged man in the loose robe, Deacon Wan, asked.

“I am,” Jiu Luo answered immediately.

Deacon Wan nodded slightly. “I just confirmed with Elder Su that he did go to the endless territories 3,000 years ago and left an opportunity for a little guy named Jiu Luo. As for what you said about acknowledging him as your master, it is true. However, Elder Su said that he is currently in closed-door cultivation and will only come out after some time. Therefore, he wants me to settle you down first. When he comes out of closed-door cultivation, you can formally kowtow and acknowledge him as your master.”

“No problem.” Jiu Luo was delighted. “By the way, this Heavenly Marquis brother beside me is my good friend. He came with me from the endless territories. I wonder if he can come with me?”

“Your good friend?” Deacon Wan glanced at Jian Wushuang, he nodded again and said, “Since you are about to take Elder Su as your master, you must be a disciple of the Young Divine Sect. A core disciple invites a good friend to the sect as a guest. Of course, the Young Divine Sect won’t refuse. You two, come with me.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After that, Deacon Wan led Jiu Luo and Jian Wushuang into the Young Divine Sect.

When they entered the sect, Jian Wushuang and Jiu Luo immediately saw a magnificent and even shocking scene.

They saw a dense cluster of 30,000-meter-tall mountains standing in every corner. There were endless pavilions and palaces. Some were suspended in the void, while others stood on the mountains.. The surrounding void was filled with white clouds, there were even some strange beasts and immortal birds. They were magnificent and fascinating!
