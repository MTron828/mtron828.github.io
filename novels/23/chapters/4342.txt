4343 The Fiery Sun Star Area

“The Fiery Sun Star area should be in front of us.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered. According to the universe map, the Fiery Sun Star area was full of volcanic craters and flowing magma. The air was high all year round. Except for some cultivators who needed to refine fire, few people would stay here.

If it were any other time, Jian Wushuang would not have stayed.

“According to the records, the volcanic crater in the Fiery Sun Star area was formed naturally. If that’s the case, then there should be an innate chaotic fourth fire Qi inside.”

“I’ll try and see if this bronze cauldron only needs the Yi wood Qi or all the innate Qi of the five elements.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and drove universe boat toward Fiery Sun Star area.

He did not deliberately speed up the stopping of universe boat. Instead, he was at ease along the way. He stopped from time to time to look at the scenery of the universe, the dense starry sky, the Flowing Milky Way, the Secrets of the sun, moon, and stars, the hurrying of the world, and to comprehend the true meaning of the great Dao.

Along the way, Jian Wushuang vaguely understood that the great Dao might be everything in the universe and the rules of operation. It was illusory but real.

However, every time Jian Wushuang thought about it on a deeper level, he felt that his comprehension was like a dream or an illusion. He could not grasp anything.

Jian Wushuang kept thinking along the way as he headed for Fiery Sun Star area.

Not long after that, they arrived at the Fiery Sun Star area.

Standing in the universe, Jian Wushuang looked at Fiery Sun Star area. It was a huge fireball. Before he got close, he could feel a burning aura. Jian Wushuang stopped the universe boat and put it away. He didn’t wake Leng Rushuang, who was cultivating in the heaven suppressing monument. Instead, he walked into Fiery Sun Star area.

Fiery Sun Star area was an uninhabited star. As soon as Jian Wushuang stepped into the plane of Fiery Sun Star area, he felt an even hotter wave of heat coming at his nose. There were sparks everywhere in the air and the ground was dried up. Green smoke rose from the cracks. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

As far as the eye could see, there were erupting volcanoes everywhere. From time to time, one could see volcanoes erupting, spewing out countless streams of lava mixed with rolling black smoke. They then slowly flowed, emitting a terrifyingly high temperature.

The entire Fiery Sun Star area was extremely hot. Even Jian Wushuang felt a little uncomfortable.

Jian Wushuang finally got used to it after some adjustments. He spread his divine power and covered the Fiery Sun Star area.

Under the vast coverage of Jian Wushuang’s divine power, he immediately knew the entire Fiery Sun Star area like the back of his hand. The other places in the star area were just like what Jian Wushuang had seen. There were dry and barren volcanoes everywhere. A few cultivators were hiding in the dark and cultivating in seclusion to refine the fire power.

The cultivators ‘cultivations weren’t high, so Jian Wushuang didn’t disturb them. His divine power just swept past them and went elsewhere.

In addition, Jian Wushuang also found a huge natural karst cave in the center of the Fiery Sun Star area!

This cave was incomparably huge, taking up almost half of Fiery Sun Star area. Inside, a large amount of lava was rolling like boiling water. It kept boiling, and fist-sized bubbles gushed out.

Many branches spread out from the Fiery Sun Star system like a spider web, leading to countless volcanoes. It could be said that the current landscape of the entire Fiery Sun Star system was formed by this magma cave.

“If there’s innate fourth fire Qi in the Fiery Sun Star area, it should be in this cave.”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and then took a step forward. Suddenly, he shot toward the karst cave in the center of Fiery Sun Star area.

A moment later, a cave with a wild monster’s mouth wide open appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

As he stood in front of the cave, waves of heat waves that had formed a substance rushed toward him. Jian Wushuang’s divine body couldn’t help but crack slightly.

Then, Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and divine power gushed out of his body. He then plunged into the lava in the karst cave.

Bang!

Lava splashed up like waves and soon, Jian Wushuang’s figure was gradually swallowed by the lava.

In the karst cave, the terrifyingly high temperature was enough to melt everything. The boiling lava attacked Jian Wushuang and washed over his divine body.

An ordinary Ultimate Ruler would have been melted into a pool of blood by the lava. However, under Jian Wushuang’s boundless divine power, the lava could not hurt him at all.

Jian Wushuang continued to sink and his divine power continued to explore, looking for the innate fourth fire Qi.

At the same time, he felt the ancient bronze cauldron in his interspatial ring become restless again!

Not long after Jian Wushuang was immersed in the lava, he did not know that a group of uninvited guests had gradually arrived outside the Fiery Sun Star area.

“Hurry up! In the scorching sun karst cave, the time for the fire primordial spirit fruit to bear fruit every one million years is almost up!”

“This time, we can’t let anyone else beat us to it!”

Seven Ruler realm experts with different appearances stood outside the Fiery Sun Star system and spoke with burning eyes.

There were both men and women among the seven or eight Rulers, and their auras were very different. It was obvious that they had come from all over the world and were not from the same sect.

One of them was a seductive woman in red with a hot body, revealing her shoulders and beautiful legs. She smiled and said, ” the fire Yuan fruit bears fruit once every one million years, and there are seven fruits at a time. The competition is usually very fierce. This time, we have brother Tuoba, so we can definitely get all seven fire Yuan fruits.

A tall, burly man in a black robe beside the charming woman laughed heartily when he heard this. Seventh Sister, don’t worry. This time, I’m here. Getting the fire Yuan fruit will be a piece of cake.

After that, he paused for a moment before he continued, “Let’s go. It seems like we are the first ones who have come to Fiery Sun Star area. We should go to the fiery sun karst cave and get a good spot.”

“I’ll follow big brother Tuoba’s arrangements.”

“That’s right. Three days later, the fire origin Dao fruit will surface from the lava of the fiery sun karst cave. At that time, the seven of us will attack together and take the fire origin Dao fruit!”

The others chimed in.

A moment later, the seven of them flashed and stepped into the Fiery Sun Star area.

They didn’t stop in Fiery Sun Star area. They went straight to the center of the huge cave, found a place to sit down cross-legged, and waited for the fire Yuan fruit to appear.

And this was only the beginning.

In the next three days, more and more Ruler-level cultivators came from afar and stepped into the blazing sun Star Domain. They guarded the scorching sun cave and the fire Yuan fruit.

Suddenly, the originally desolate and uninhabited flaming sun Star area became lively.

There were even experts who were close to the invincible Ruler level.

The atmosphere at the side of the scorching sun karst cave gradually became extremely heavy. The Rulers sized each other up, their eyes filled with deep enmity and fear.

What no one noticed was that beneath their feet, in the terrifying lava of the flaming sun karst cave, a black-haired figure had already sunk to the bottom.

“What is this?”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and looked at the ball of fire formed by countless flames and lava in front of him.
