“Whoosh!”

Countless black chains shot out from Qiu Long’s back like javelins and smashed at the godly armor guards!

In an instant, the Overlord’s Divine Palace was filled with screams.

God’s blood filled the air, and shrill cries of despair rose and fell.

!!

Commander Buxu’s entire head was forcefully broken off, and he tossed it around like a ball.

The great Overlord’s Divine Palace was a sea of blood and corpses. with his hands behind his back, Qiu Long leisurely walked toward the great hall where the great Overlord was.

The heavily-guarded Overlord’s Divine Palace was like a walk in the park under Qiu Long’s feet. No one could stop him for a moment.

It was as if he had entered a no-man’s land!

After half an incense’s time.

Qiu Long stepped into the Overlord’s shrine.

This was where the Overlord was.

At this moment, the Overlord Divine Palace was quiet. the seats of the seven commanders were all empty.

The Overlord sat on his Dragon Throne with his eyes closed. His qi and blood were boiling like the sun.

Clatter…tap tap…

Clatter…tap tap…

Hearing the footsteps, the Overlord’s eyes suddenly opened, and a divine light flashed through his eyes.

“Eh? You didn’t stop him?” The Overlord’s brows furrowed, and a look of displeasure flashed across his face.

So many people, yet they could not stop a single person?

However, he did not care much about it. Or rather, as one of the nine magnates, there were only a few people in the eight cities that he cared about.

However, Qiu Long was obviously not in this category.

Qiu Long raised his head and looked at the Overlord. He shrugged and said with a smile, “Big guy, your men are really rude. I only wanted to say one sentence and they wanted to kill me. Tell me, how are you going to compensate me?”

“Compensation?” Hearing this, the Overlord was so angry that he laughed. This person had killed all of his subordinates, and now he was asking for compensation?

Also, he was the possessor of the undying Overlord body, one of the nine big shots of the last eight cities, and this person actually called him big guy?

“Go to hell!”

The Overlord sneered and stomped with his right foot. His whole body suddenly flew up and his right fist condensed into a sun, smashing towards Qiu Long!

This punch was just a casual punch from the Overlord, but it was like the beating of the ancient heavenly court’s war drum. It caused the space to shake and a few cracks to appear!

This punch was enough to directly blow up a star!

This punch was filled with the might of an invincible Ruler!

However…

Qiu Long just stretched out his palm and grabbed at the Overlord’s right fist!

Bang!

With a muffled sound, the Overlord’s punch hit the Dragon’s palm. The huge force spread out and directly shattered the Overlord’s Divine Palace!

With the two of them as the center, the ground within a hundred feet collapsed!

Such a terrifying punch landed on Qiu Long’s outstretched palm, but it could not advance any further.

“What?” The Overlord’s expression changed.

“You’re also rude.”

Qiu Long shook his head and clenched his fingers. He then grabbed the Overlord’s fist and threw it out!

In an instant, the Overlord was sent flying, and his body smashed a long ravine on the ground.

The Overlord jumped up from the dust, his face extremely gloomy.

“What do you want?” The Overlord asked coldly.

At the same time, the power in his body began to condense, and his skin began to be covered with mysterious runes that were filled with a vast and ancient aura.

He had activated the immortal tyrant body!

“I’m asking you, where is the Blood Sword?” Qiu Long twisted his neck and asked.

“You’re looking for the Blood Sword?” The Overlord’s eyes narrowed.

…

…

On the battlefield of the 16th city.

Several escaping lights chased after Jian Wushuang and flew quickly above the Nine Heavens.

“I’d like to see where you can escape to,” the Golden Crow Prince said with an indifferent expression.

Just as he finished speaking.

Bang!

Jian Wushuang’s charging figure suddenly stopped!

“Oh? You’re not running?”

The Golden Crow Prince laughed scornfully and stopped as well.

The Rabbit Buddha, the Moonslayer, the Dark Demon Descendant, and the others changed their figures and surrounded Jian Wushuang in a square.

“When did I say I was going to escape?” Jian Wushuang stood in the void with his hands behind his back and his eyes swept across the faces of the four people.

“Blood Sword, I’ve given you a chance, but you didn’t cherish it. Now, don’t blame me for being merciless.”

“Let’s go!” Emperor Jin Wu said indifferently. Then, he took a step forward and charged at Jian Wushuang with two tridents in his hands.

He waved his halberd and countless divine flames surged out from the two tridents, turning into a sun-swallowing Fire Dragon that roared across the world!

The Golden Crow race was born in the sun and stars. They bathed in the divine sun fire all year round and grew by absorbing the divine sun fire. They were the strongest race in the universe!

As for the Golden Crow Emperor, he was the eldest son of the Golden Crow monarch, a Supreme expert!

From this, one could see how terrifying his halberd was!

If it was in the outside world, it was enough to burn a galaxy into nothingness!

“The Buddha is merciful, I can’t bear to kill.” The Rabbit Buddha heaved a long sigh and looked as if he was bemoaning the state of the universe and pitying the fate of mankind. However, he did not hesitate to smash the demon subduing Zen staff in his hand toward Jian Wushuang!

This strike was simple and heavy, and the golden ring on the staff made a strange sound.

Then, the sound of Buddha surged as if a Great Buddha had descended between heaven and earth. He struck down with his giant hand to punish evil!

The Dark Demon Descendant laughed wildly. He pulled with both hands and a Blood River was drawn out from the void and surged toward Jian Wushuang.

As for the handsome young man, the Demon Blade, Moonslayer, he did not say a word. Instead, he pulled out the Demon Blade in his hand.

A flash of coldness flashed across Moonslayer’s face. Then, an extremely fast saber light, like a lightning tearing the night sky, quickly folded the void and slashed at Jian Wushuang!

In an instant, the four unrivaled Rulers attacked Jian Wushuang at the same time!

Jian Wushuang’s black hair was flying in the air. Facing the shocking attacks that came from four directions, although his eyes were full of fighting intent, his heart was extremely heavy and he did not relax at all.

“Sundering stars!”

Jian Wushuang shouted coldly and his eyes were as sharp as an eagle’s. He immediately activated his divine power that was more than twelve thousand times stronger and the willpower that was ten times stronger given by the laws of the universe. He turned into a silver sword rainbow that was nearly ten thousand feet long!

Jian Wushuang flipped his right hand and the sword rainbow in his hand swept out to meet the four unparalleled Rulers’ shocking attacks!

Boom!

However, the star slashing sword rainbow, which was usually invincible, only lasted for a few breaths of time when facing the joint attack of these four people before it was instantly defeated.

But…

A few breaths of time was enough!

Jian Wushuang took advantage of this gap and stomped his right foot heavily, charging toward the Dark Demon Descendant!

Of the four unparalleled hegemons, the Golden Crow Imperial Prince was the strongest, and the Dark Demon Descendant was already a bit weaker than them. Moreover, he had also been heavily injured, making him the easiest to kill!

“Divine power ignition!”

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang performed the Dragon-destroying secret skill and his strength increased greatly!

In a flash, he appeared in front of the Dark Demon Descendant.

“What?”

While the Dark Demon Descendant was still in a daze, Jian Wushuang’s Wuqi Divine Sword had already slashed down at him!

“The first one to die will be you!”
