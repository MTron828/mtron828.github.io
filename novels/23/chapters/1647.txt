1648 The Right To Stay Permanently

“This place it shall be.”

As Jian Wushuang looked at a spacious area which was halfway up a mountain, he waved his big hands immediately. With that, a great amount of Divine Power appeared.

The Divine Power then turned into a black castle in the open area.

By achieving abilities similar to Jian Wushuang, one would be able to use their Divine Power to create a palace or cave easily.

However, as Jian Wushuang was creating his castle, he also attracted the attention of the Masters of some palaces in his vicinity.

“Looks like I will have another new neighbor. I wonder who he is?” a long-robed old man floated over and in no time, he came to the void that Jian Wushuang was in.

At the same time, he also saw Jian Wushuang.

“A Void Real God?” the long-robed old man revealed a surprised expression right away.

Although Jian Wushuang’s Divine Power could rival that of a Chaotic Real God’s, he was still a Stage One Real God in the end. Thus, the aura that he had released was only at the level of a Void Real God and the long-robed old man could tell with a glance straight away.

“I am Jian Wushuang from the Lineage of Star. Greetings to Real God Wu Xing,” Jian Wushuang said modestly.

“Jian Wushuang? The Inverse Cultivator of the Lineage of Star?” The long-robed old man known as Real God Wu Xing opened his eyes wide, “You… you are actually creating a palace in the Sanctuary Mountain. Could it be that you have already cleared the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace?”

“I was just fortunate,” Jian Wushuang chuckled. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“You have really cleared it?” Real God Wu Xing felt that it was unbelievable.

He knew that Jian Wushuang had only cleared the Inverse Cultivation Test for the Third Heaven not too long ago. Moreover, after fighting with the experts of the Four Symbol Mansion in the Burning Demon Region, he became extremely famous and even his identity as an Inverse Cultivator was exposed.

However, the abilities that Jian Wushuang displayed during the battle in the Burning Demon Region were merely that of a normal Eternal Real God. Similarly, his level of comprehension of the Heaven Way was not very high.

Furthermore, how many years has it been since that battle?

Not only had he made a breakthrough to Real God, he had also cleared the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace. How shocking was his speed of improvement?

“Real God Wu Xing, do you want to have a chat with me in my castle?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

“It’s fine,” Real God Wu Xing shook his head and in the blink of an eye, he left.

Not long after that, Real God Wu Xing spread the news of Jian Wushuang creating a castle in the Sanctuary Mountain and that he had also cleared the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace.

In no time, the whole Thunderbolt Island and even the whole Sanctuary Alliance was shocked.

It must be known that up till the very moment, the Monster King who was previously known as the number one of the Void Real Gods had only managed to clear the fourth level of the Doctrine Palace even though he had been stuck in Void Real God for many years.

What about Jian Wushuang?

He had only made a breakthrough not too long ago and there was still huge room for him to improve as a Void Real God. Not to mention that he would also become an Eternal Real God and Chaotic Real God in the future.

“Too Fast! Jian Wushuang’s speed of improvement is too fast!”

“He has managed to clear the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace even though he has only made a breakthrough to Real God not too long ago and this is really frightening. Could this happen because of him being an Inverse Cultivator?”

“No. Although Inverse Cultivators are frightening, they do not have much of an advantage in terms of comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way. For Jian Wushuang to be able to clear the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace after making a breakthrough to Real God recently, it is completely thanks to his own power of comprehension, as well as his own talents.”

“In other words, even if Jian Wushuang were not an Inverse Cultivator, he will still be a monster-level super genius of the Eternal Chaotic World. By adding his identity as an Inverse Cultivator on top of that… his potential is a lot greater than Real God Wu Bei’s.”

“That’s right. Although Real God Wu Bei is also an Inverse Cultivator, his comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way is not as slick as Jian Wushuang’s.”

The Sanctuary Alliance, the Thunderbolt Island as well as the experts of powerhouses from everywhere were discussing and exclaiming.

Of course, to the Sanctuary Alliance, it was good news to them that such an amazing genius had appeared. However, to other experts or powerhouses who had ulterior motives, it was completely different.

At the Four Symbol Mansion of the Ten Cultivation Sancturies’ Colored Glaze Sanctuary.

Within a lofty palace, the Four Symbol Mansion Master, as well as many high-level experts of the Four Symbol Mansion, were gathered together.

“The fifth level?”

The Four Symbol Mansion Master was the intimidating man who wore a robe. His eyes, which were glowing with a shrill light, were looking down, “How long has that Jian Wushuang been training in the Thunderbolt Island? It has not even been two thousand years, right?”

“It has been less than five thousand years since the battle between him and the Four Symbol Mansion. After such a short amount of time, he was able to clear the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace. Moreover, he also made a breakthrough to Real God. If he were given a bit more time, wouldn’t he become an Almighty?”

Many high-level experts of the Four Symbol Mansion who were within the palace had extremely ugly expressions.

Jian Wushuang’s speed of improvement was indeed frightening.

“Mansion Master.” All of a sudden, Real God Chi Huo started to speak, “Shouldn’t we change the way we treat Jian Wushuang?”

“Chi Huo, what are you trying to say?” the Four Symbol Mansion Master looked at Real God Chi Huo.

“Jian Wushuang himself is an Inverse Cultivator and his power of comprehension is so great. Now, he has managed to clear the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace even though he has only just made a breakthrough to Real God. Moreover, with the frightening level of an Inverse Cultivator, he should be able to get into the Real God ranking list when he becomes an Eternal Real God. If he were to become a Chaotic Real God, he would definitely possess the fighting capabilities of an Almighty. Furthermore, he might be even stronger than Real God Wu Bei. Hence, there is no need for the Four Symbol Mansion to continue making things so difficult for him,” Real God Chi Huo said.

“Chi Huo, are you trying to say that the Four Symbol Mansion should stop going after him from now on? Even though he has killed tens of Real Gods of the Four Symbol Mansion in the Burning Demon Region, we should just leave this matter as it is?” an Elder stepped out and shot down his suggestion.

However, Real God Chi Huo laughed, “The hatred between the Four Symbol Mansion and Jian Wushuang actually originated from the battle in the Burning Demon Region. You’re right. During that battle, the Four Symbol Mansion indeed suffered big losses as many Real Gods died. However, those Real Gods were merely some normal Void Real Gods. Since there are so many Void Real Gods in the Four Symbol Mansion, it would be considered nothing even if a few of them were to die. Thus, the only thing that can be said to be lost is the Four Symbol Mansion’s prestige!”

“The Four Symbol Mansion has always wanted to kill him so that we can get back our prestige.”

“If Jian Wushuang’s speed of improvement were not so fast, we would indeed be able to take action and kill him when there is an opportunity to do so. However, now… not only he has already made a breakthrough to Real God, he is also a member of the Sanctuary Alliance. In addition, his potential is unbelievable. If such a person continues to grow, at the very least, he will possess the fighting capabilities of Real God Wu Bei when he is at his peak. With some opportunities, he will probably become another Star Palace Master. If his luck is really good, there might even be hope for him to achieve the level of an Emperor in the future!”

“Therefore, it is too risky to go after such a top genius unyieldingly in order to get back some prestige.”

After hearing Real God Chi Huo’s words, everyone present became silent.

After thinking it through many times, they felt that Real God Chi Huo’s words were rational.

After all, although Jian Wushuang had offended the Four Symbol Mansion, it was not at the stage where they had to fight to their last gasp
