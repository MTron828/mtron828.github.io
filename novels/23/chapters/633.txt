Chapter 634: Enlightenment Mountain

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Bewildered, the geniuses who passed the second round left the Drill Ground with the middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man quickly took them to a towering mountain.

“Here we are.”

The middle-aged man stood in the air and pointed toward the towering mountain in front of them, then said, “This is Enlightenment Mountain. There are many cave mansions on the Enlightenment Mountain. You can stay here for a month and cultivate.”

“Go!”

The middle-aged man waved and did not explain anything.

The 124 geniuses were confused, but they rushed toward Enlightenment Mountain since the middle-aged man told them to.

However, as soon as they reached the mountain, the geniuses immediately noticed there was something unusual about it.

“What’s going on?”

“Why do I feel like it is easier to comprehend Dao here than it is in other places??”

“Right, I feel like that too!”

All the geniuses were surprised to find that it was much easier to comprehend the Dao here.

“This Enlightenment Mountain actually has such a kind of ability?”

With a hint of surprise in his eyes, Jian Wushuang immediately found a cave mansion and entered.

As soon as he entered the cave mansion, he found it easier for him to comprehend the Slaughter Dao.

“It’s faster to comprehend the Dao in the cave mansion than outside.”

These geniuses also quickly noticed this point. They couldn’t help being overjoyed. Naturally, all the geniuses found their own cave mansion and began to comprehend and cultivate.

At this time, no one wanted to think about anything else. All they were thinking about was cultivating and comprehending!

They meditated on the Dao they had comprehended.

They found that meditating on the Dao here was at least twice as fast as in other places across the world!

That was to say, one day of meditation in the cave mansion was equal to two days outside.

Besides, they could stay here for a full month! A month was brief, but they could reach a new level in Dao comprehension with such great cultivation conditions.

“We’re here to see who can make the most progress!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Sitting cross-legged in the cave mansion, Jian Wushuang knew very clearly in his heart why the man wanted them to stay here for a month.

What kind of person could be called a genius?

Those who had a gift!

And what was the best way to demonstrate how gifted they were? Progress!

The speed of progress was also the standard for those sect experts to choose talents. This month seemed short, but anyone with real talent would be able to make a lot of progress under such conditions.

“One month?” A?spark flashed through Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

A month was a short amount of time, even for the top geniuses here. They could make progress this month, but they couldn’t make much progress.

But Jian Wushuang was different.

He had just broken through and took the first step in the Heaven-treading Realm!

He went straight to the Firmament Territory Feast immediately after making his breakthrough. But, the greatest benefit of the Heaven-treading Realm was talent in comprehension, which was very different from the Skyscraping Realm.

He was already an absolute genius with a flawless foundation and his talent was so great that he was by no means weaker than the 123 geniuses that were currently at Enlightenment Mountain.

Furthermore, his talent in comprehension directly became ten-odd times better after reaching the Heaven-treading Realm.

His current level of comprehension was already beyond imagination.

One month was enough to increase his strength by leaps and bounds.

“Now I just have to wait and see how much progress I can make in one month.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, with a glimmer of expectation in the eyes. Then, with a thought, an identical figure appeared beside him.

The World Body and the Slaughter Body both began to focus on cultivation and meditation in this cave mansion.

There were many geniuses in Enlightenment Mountain, but they were all currently busy in their own cave mansions, so none of them would bother Jian Wushuang.

Time went by slowly...

In a flash, one month had passed.

“Come out, all of you!”

The middle-aged man shouted out from above Enlightenment Mountain, but his voice contained magic power which transmitted it to all the cave mansions.

Those geniuses, who were completely absorbed in meditation, were immediately awakened, one by one.

The two Jian Wushuangs in the cave mansion opened their eyes at the same time.

“A month passed so quickly.”

Jian Wushuang sighed lightly, but there was no regret on his face. Instead, his eyes were shining.

After the two Original Bodies were united again, Jian Wushuang slowly walked out of the cave mansion.

All the other geniuses also came out one by one. Seeing their expressions, Jian Wushuang knew that they all should have benefitted a lot in this last month.

“Follow me.”

After saying this, the middle-aged man took them back to the Drill Ground where the Firmament Territory Feast was held.

The Skyward Pavilion was still quietly floating above the Drill Ground and the sect experts were already back.

They were talking casually.

“Now that a month has passed, I wonder how much progress these little guys have made.”

“Who knows, but it should not be small. After all, they stayed at Enlightenment Mountain for the whole month, where they could meditate on the Dao twice as fast as in other places. Even an average genius can make some progress in a month, let alone these top geniuses who can make it to the third round.”

“Let’s wait and see, many of these little guys have deliberately hidden their strength during the first two rounds of the genius battle, but the third round is different. These little guys will reveal their strength one by one, then we’ll find out who is the strongest!”

The experts from the sects were all looking forward to what would happen.

In the room where the Ancient Sect was, the eyes of the purple-hair man, Xuan Yi, were focused on Jian Wushuang, Feng, and the other four people.

But he was not concerned with the top geniuses from the Eternal World.

“The two little guys, Jian Wushuang and Feng, have hidden themselves very well. Especially Jian Wushuang. He even caused my Sword Heart to become excited, which has never happened in the Firmament Territory. Even more of their strength will be revealed during Round Three!”

“I hope... they’ll give me a surprise.”

Xuan Yi smiled.

The middle-aged man presiding over the conference had already begun to announce the contents of the third round on the Drill Ground.

“Round Three consists of the Arena Battle.”
