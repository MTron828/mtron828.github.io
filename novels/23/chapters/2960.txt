Chapter 2961: A Huge Sum of Money

“Take a look.”

With that, Xue Dong King walked forward.

“Lord Tianshou, we have obtained a treasure. We would like you to determine its value,” Xue Dong King said.

“Sure.” The Golden Light Shadow nodded.

“Brother Heavenly Masquis, take out the Divine Earth Fruit,” Xue Dong King said.

Jian Wushuang took out the Divine Earth Fruit without hesitation.

The Golden Light Shadow glanced at the Divine Earth Fruit and already had the result.

“The Divine Earth Fruit is very useful for cultivators who are comprehending the earth rules, especially those below the Master of Laws. It is enough to make many Immortal Saints who are comprehending the laws fight for it. Even some top Immortal Saints would covet it. This treasure is very valuable and very rare. You can choose to keep it or exchange it for me. But if you choose to keep it, you have to pay a fee of 500,000 sacred elixirs!” The Golden Light Shadow said.

“Appraisal fee? 500,000 sacred elixirs?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, you need to pay an appraisal fee to ask Lord Tianshou to appraise a treasure in the Treasure Pavilion. The higher the value of the treasure, the higher the appraisal fee. However, if you choose to exchange this treasure for Lord Tianshou, Lord Tianshou will help you appraise it for free,” said Xue Dong King.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood.

“Sir Tianshou, the Divine Earth Fruit is of no use to us, so I’ll exchange it for you directly. But how many saint elixirs can I exchange for this treasure?” Xue Dong King asked.

Sir Tianshou pondered for a moment and then said, “100 million!”

“100 million!”

Hearing this number, Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King were stunned. They looked at each other with a trace of shock in their eyes.

100 million? 100 million sacred elixirs?

They had guessed that the Divine Earth Fruit was very valuable, otherwise, the Star Sea Saint would not have come to fight for it.

However, they estimated that the Divine Earth Fruit was only worth about 20 to 30 million sacred elixirs. It was already very good that it was worth more than 30 million sacred elixirs.

However, it was obvious that they had underestimated the value of the Divine Earth Fruit.

This Earth God Kingdom was an excellent treasure used to comprehend the laws of the Earth. Many True Saint experts who were proficient in the laws of the Earth and had great strength coveted this treasure. How could its value be ordinary?

“100 million sacred pills. This is because we are only ordinary members, right?” Xue Dong Wang said.

“Yes.” Lord Tianshuo directly nodded. “According to the rules of the Treasure Pavilion of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, the higher the level of the members, the more authority they have. Whether you buy it in the Treasure Pavilion, there are certain benefits. For example, if you buy the same treasure, ordinary members must pay 100% of the sacred elixirs, but earth-level members only need to pay 90%, and heaven-level members only need to pay 80%, and so on!”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Now he finally knew the benefits of being a high-level member.

“It’s true that you can only get 100 million sacred elixirs if you exchange the Divine Earth Fruit for me with your authority as an ordinary member. But if you become an earth-level member in the future and exchange the Divine Earth Fruit for me, you can get 10 million more sacred elixirs. As for your choice, it’s up to you,” Lord Tianshuo said.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King immediately began to discuss.

“Xue Dong King, what do you think?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“You’ve seen the three-star mission this time. With my strength, it will be a bit stressful to complete three three-star missions alone. I’m afraid it will take some time for me to successfully become an earth-level member. But if I can get this sacred elixir, I can exchange it for a lot of good things. Then my strength will improve a lot, and the speed of completing the mission will be faster. So, I hope to exchange for this Divine Earth Fruit now. What about you?” Xue Dong King looked over.

“I think so too.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Even if they waited until the earth-level members went to exchange, they would only get 10 million more sacred elixirs. If they split the money, they would each get 5 million more sacred elixirs.

5 million sacred elixirs were not as important as 100 million sacred elixirs.

Of course, they did not need to wait so long.

“Sir Tianshou, we have decided to exchange for the Divine Earth Fruit now,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay.” Sir Tianshou nodded slightly. With a flip of his hand, the Divine Earth Fruit disappeared from his hand. “Now you have 100 million sacred elixirs. If you divide the 100 million sacred elixirs equally, each of you will get 50 million sacred elixirs. You can choose to buy treasures from me or get ready-made sacred elixirs. Within ten days, someone will deliver the sacred elixirs to you.”

“Let’s take a look at the treasures first,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

What a joke. The Treasure Pavilion of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance was the only one in the Divine Beginning World.

How vast was the Heaven-cleaving Alliance?

It was not surprising that 99% of the treasures in the Divine Beginning World should be available in the Treasure Pavilion, as long as there were some. However, one needed a certain level of authority to exchange for them.

Although they were only ordinary members, there were still some extraordinary items that ordinary members could exchange for.

“You can tell me what kind of treasures you want.” Lord Tianshou’s tone was cold and emotionless.

“Brother Tianhou, this is your first time in the Treasure Pavilion. You can go first,” said Xue Dong King.

Jian Wushuang did not stand on ceremony. After pondering for a moment, he said directly, “Lord Tianshou, I first need some treasures that can help me accumulate divine power.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Treasures that can accumulate divine power? You mean treasures that can refine and help you reach the highest level of divine power in a short time?” Sir Tianshuo asked.

“Yes, I haven’t cultivated for a long time. In the past, I relied on absorbing the pure power of the sacred elixir to increase my divine power. But now that I’m at a higher level, I need more and more divine power. Absorbing the sacred elixir alone costs a lot of sacred elixirs, and the effect is even weaker,” Jian Wushuang said.

“You’ve been absorbing the sacred elixir to increase your divine power?” Lord Tianshou looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis.” Xue Dong King was also quite surprised.

“Why, is it strange?” Jian Wushuang asked curiously.

“Of course it’s strange,” Xue Dong King said directly. “Brother Heavenly Marquis, first of all, you should know that the sacred elixir is mainly used as a currency in the Beginning Divine World. Secondly, it’s used to absorb and refine. Even if it’s really used to absorb and refine divine power into your own, the process is very complicated and long. Under normal circumstances, very few people do this. Even if they do this, many people are helpless. But you’ve been absorbing and refining the power of the sacred elixir to increase your divine power. This is a waste!”
