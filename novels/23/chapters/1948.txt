1949 Outsider

In Wushuang City, in the secret room, Jian Wushuang sat alone with his eyes closed.

He had been cultivating in seclusion for the past twelve thousand years. He broke seven stars previously and they was all recovered. His power had resumed its peak.

Not only that, his comprehension of doctrine improved tremendously as well. Both Spacetime Doctrine and Reincarnation Doctrine had already reached the extreme limit of the eighth level in Doctrine Palace.

In terms of Sword Principle, he had also had a breakthrough.

“The current me has improved tremendously in my overall power, but it is a pity that I will never step out to the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill, Chaotic Supreme.

Since he had received the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill, he had been studying it.

He had been figuring out ways to breakthrough.

He had already put in painstaking effort but he felt that he was just slightly away from breakthrough.

The slight bit was just like a layer of window paper. With just one poke, it would break.

However, the window paper required a great opportunity.

Hence, Jian Wushuang tried to keep himself composed.

Just then…

“Huh?”

Jian Wushuang was surprised and he opened his eyes. His figure moved and he left the secret room.

In the lofty discussion hall in Wushuang City.

Vroom!

Jian Wushuang’s body appeared on the highest throne out of nowhere.

“Father, Brother Wang Yuan, Fourth Brother, what’s the matter? Why are you in a hurry to see me?” Jian Wushuang looked at the three of them next to him.

He said before he had started cultivating in seclusion. Unless it was something very urgent, one shouldn’t interrupt him when he cultivated.

“There’s something urgent,” Jian Nantian’s face grew grave.

“Let me break this to you,” Wang Yuan said directly, “Third Brother, there’s an outsider in Green Fire World.

“Outsider?” Jian Wushuang immediately looked distressed.

Green Fire World and the entire ancient battlefield was under the cover of the great formation. Without the permission of the higher-ups in Green Fire Palace, no one could barge in as they wished.

In such a situation, there were outsiders in Green Fire World?

“Either he is an expert in a deep sleep in the ancient battlefield, or he is an expert from Eternal Chaotic World who came to the battlefield through the space gap in ancient mystery land by luck, just like King Gu Tong back then,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

“How’s the power of this outsider?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Very powerful. Terrifyingly powerful,” Wang Yuan said solemnly. “Green Fire World grew over the years and our power is way beyond what it was in the past. There are many cultivators who have already reached the level of a Real God. However, the outsider just stood there and many of our Real Gods didn’t even have the guts to fight back. If I am not mistaken, he should have reached the Almighty level that you mentioned.”

“Almighty?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

“The outsider seems to have understood the history of Green Fire World. He came and attacked Green Fire Palace with thunderous measures. Green Fire Palace couldn’t resist at all. We sent out the few Dao soldiers that you left behind. However, with the few Dao soldiers joining forces, he still defeated them with ease,” Wang Yuan said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

The few Dao soldiers that he left in Green Fire Palace were merely ordinary bronze-armored Dao soldiers.

Theoretically, the few Dao soldiers joining forces could easily match a Sir God evenly.

In the end, they were defeated with ease. The enemy was at least a top Sir God or Emperor God.

“Do you have any mirror image of him fighting with the Dao soldiers?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, I ordered someone to record them,” Su Rou stood up and took out a token.

Su Rou waved and a huge mirror image immediately appeared in the void.

In the mirror image, the outsider fought with the few Dao soldiers.

A total of four Dao soldiers were fighting all-out, but in the end, the malicious-looking young man only attacked casually and suppressed the four Dao soldiers easily. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

When Jian Wushuang saw the malicious-looking young man in the image, his eyes dilated in shock, “It’s him!!”

Jian Wushuang recognized the malicious-looking young man.

There were many experts in Eternal Chaotic World. There were many Almighties among them. Any Almighty who was famous, Jian Wushuang paid attention to them.

The malicious-looking young man in the image was an Emperor God, Jian Wushuang naturally knew him.

“Emperor God Xie Xin, he came to Green Fire World?” Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold.

Emperor God Xie Xin had been wandering in the ancient mystery land. As he appeared there, no doubt, he had definitely come through the space gap in ancient mystery land.

“Luckily, it was only an Emperor God who barged in unintentionally and he isn’t that powerful. He is well within my power to deal with. If it was really an ancient experts, it’d be real trouble,” Jian Wushuang let out a breath of relief.

Emperor God Xie Xin’s power was ordinary, so Jian Wushuang could deal with him.

If it were to be an ancient expert who had woken up from the ancient battlefield, that would be true trouble.

An ancient expert, even the weakest one wouldn’t be one that Jian Wushuang could easily deal with once he resumed his peak fighting power.

“Third Brother, you know this outsider?” Wang Yuan asked.

“Never met him, but I know his background. So, what happened after?” Jian Wushuang asked again.

“The outsider’s intention is obviously to conquer Green Fire World. Hence, after he defeated the few Dao soldiers and revealed his power, he didn’t massacre the higher ups in Green Fire World but he left a message. He said that he would give us one month’s time to consider. One month later, if Green Fire World and the nine top forces in Green Fire World do not yield to him, he will kill all of us one by one!”

“Besides, he even brought up you, Third Brother,” Wang Yuan looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Oh? What did he say?” Jian Wushuang looked cold.

“He knows that Third Brother, Wushuang City Master is widely acknowledged as the strongest person and your word carries great weight. Hence, he said to let you go and see him,” Wang Yuan said.

“For me to see him? Hehe. Emperor God Xie Xin has guts,” Jian Wushuang sneered but he understood, “I reckon Emperor God Xie Xin doesn’t know my identity.”

Jian Wushuang knew just how famous he was in Eternal Chaotic World.

Even Great Emperor had scruples, let alone just Emperor God Xie Xin.

However, Emperor God Xie Xin didn’t care about him but had relayed a message for Wushuang City Master to see him personally. He definitely didn’t know Wushuang City Master’s true identity.

Emperor God Xie Xin probably only knew that the strongest person in Green Fire World was Wushuang City Master but he didn’t know the true name of the Wushuang City Master.

If Emperor God Xie Xin knew, forget about his mad behavior, he would have run away from Green Fire World long ago.

“Where’s this outsider now?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“He’s in the palace floating outside Green Fire Palace,” Wang Yuan answered.
