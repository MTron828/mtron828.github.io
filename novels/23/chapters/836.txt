Chapter 837: Breaking Through the Military Pagoda

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“I’ll seize every chance to join the Blood Eagle Guard. I want to try in the Military Pagoda. Could you show me the way?”

“Come with me then,” Asura consented.

Jian Wushuang explained his plan to Ouyang Xuan and the others and followed Asura to the Military Pagoda.

The Blood Eagle Guard was a special organization in the Royal Guard, the elite of the elite.

To join, first one had to be powerful.

The Royal Guard had specially set up the Military Pagoda to test the challengers’ power.

The black pagoda stood towering in the center of the barracks.

“Here it is.”

Asura led Jian Wushuang to the front door of the pagoda. “The test in this tower is very unusual, but it should not be a problem for you to make it to the ninth floor. Once you succeed, you can apply to join the Blood Eagle Guard.”

“I see, thanks.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Go on then,” Asura said.

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang strode into the black tower.

He arrived on the first floor.

This floor was a wide ground made of special materials, very hard, and in the center stood a cold figure.

At a glance, Jian Wushuang could tell it was a Puppet Fighter.

The moment Jian Wushuang went in, the puppet Fighter immediately opened his eyes and started speaking. “Challenger, you only need to hold up under my attacks for half an hour, then you can enter the next floor.”

“Half an hour?” Jian Wushuang repeated.

“Let’s begin.”

Without another word, the Puppet Fighter made his move.

Woosh! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The Puppet Fighter crossed 60 meters in one step, striking out his saber at the same time.

The blade light went straight for Jian Wushuang.

“Well?”

Jian Wushuang had a rather strange look.

He could tell that the Puppet Fighter was in Step Three but not powerful. He could defeat him directly, let alone holding on for half an hour under his attacks.

“It is not difficult to pass the first floor of this Military Pagoda,”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

He defended himself casually without beating down the Puppet Fighter.

When half an hour had passed, the Puppet Fighter immediately stopped attacking and let Jian Wushuang pass to the second floor.

Walking along the stairs, Jian Wushuang came to the second floor of the tower.

Same as the first floor, the second floor was also a large ground, and his opponents were at the same level as the Puppet Fighter on the first floor. The only difference was that there were two Puppet Fighters waiting for him.

It was the same on the third floor, only there were four Puppet Fighters.

On the fourth floor, there were eight Puppet Fighters.

And so on.

Jian Wushuang was so powerful that even though he had not transformed into an Ancient God, he still overpowered the Puppet Fighters regardless of how high the floor was, or how many more Puppet Fighters he encountered.

Before long, he reached the ninth floor of the tower.

The Puppet Fighters on that floor were in Step Three as well, and there were 256 of them in total.

The Puppet Fighters joined hands to attack Jian Wushuang. They worked together well. Normal Step Four Eternal Realm experts would barely be able to hold on for half an hour, however, Jian Wushuang was extraordinarily powerful and good at dealing with joint attacks.

Back when he was in the Ancient God Clan, he had gained a lot of experience in fighting against joint attacks.

Jian Wushuang looked at ease as he fought with the 256 Puppet Fighters. Soon, half an hour had passed.

He passed through the ninth floor.

On the tenth floor, he encountered 512 Puppet Fighters.

Heavily outnumbered, Jian Wushuang could not fight as leisurely as before. He was suppressed by the Puppet Fighters and struggled for half an hour.

Finally, he passed through the tenth floor.

As for the eleventh floor, since Jian Wushuang did not intend to turn into an Ancient God, it was impossible for him to pass it.

In just a few moments, he was defeated and his challenge ended.

He walked out of the tower.

“How did it go?” Asura immediately asked him.

“Not bad, I made it to the tenth floor.” Jian Wushuang answered with a smile.

“What?! The tenth floor?” Asura was surprised. He looked at Jian Wushuang in amazement.

He had only made it to the ninth floor and failed to pass the tenth after a moment of struggling.

He was surprised that Jian Wushuang was at the same level as him but had made it further than him in the tower.

“Asura, I have passed the tenth floor and met the requirements for joining the Blood Eagle Guard. What should I do next?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Soon, the Blood Eagle Guard will know that you have broken through the tenth floor. Someone will come to find you and ask if you want to join the Blood Eagle Guard. If you say yes, they will ask you some questions and you will give them your basic information. After they check and confirm it, they will let you join,” Asura replied.

“Is it that simple?” Jian Wushuang frowned hard.

According to what he had heard from Ouyang Xu before, the Blood Eagle Guard’s standards were very high.

However, now it seemed that it was not that high.

“Of course, it’s not that simple.” Asura continued, “To join the Blood Eagle Guard, first you have to be powerful. Generally, you have to have reached Step Four. Another requirement is regarding your identity.”

“Identity?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“The Blood Eagle Guard is a very special organization. They carry out missions for the royal families, and many of the missions are about the internal conflicts between those families, therefore, they have to act in secret. Naturally, they have some special requirements regarding the identities of their members.”

Asura immediately started explaining.
