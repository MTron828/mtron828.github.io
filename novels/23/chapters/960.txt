Chapter 961: Regained Consciousness

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The battle ended.

It was an unprecedentedly fierce battle which had shaken the earth and heavens.

The moment it concluded, the stories about it began spreading throughout the Eternal World at an amazing rate.

In only a few days, the entire Eternal World heard about this shocking piece of news.

Everyone was astonished!

No one had ever thought that the mysterious National Master of Tang of the East had been secretly scheming against the country.

No one had expected the famous Emperor Leng and the Xia Clan to be the National Master’s accomplices.

Days after the battle, warriors in Tang of the East were still in shock.

After all, they had nearly been annihilated by those people, and the entire Tang of the East had nearly been turned into an abandoned land.

Both of the two belligerent parties had suffered heavy losses in this battle.

Nearly two-thirds of the Dao Masters engaged in this battle were killed, and the situation was even worse for those serving under Emperor Leng. Among her 24 bodyguards, only 6 of them survived. Emperor Leng herself was also suppressed by Emperor Xiao.

As for the Xia Clan, it suffered a devastating blow!

As the No.1 overlord clan in Tang of the East, the Xia Clan had displayed a formidable strength in the battle.

It just had never expected that its most elite troop, the Immortal Army, would have been annihilated by Jian Wushuang.

Many high-level experts of the clan were killed during the battle, including Ancestor Xia Yong and Master Xia Tao.

It could be argued that nearly all the high-level experts of the Xia Clan were killed in this battle.

Without them, the clan could no longer maintain its position as the No.1 overlord clan in Tang of the East. To make matters worse, they had to suffer oppression at the hands of Emperor Xiao, as now he regained control of this country.

The former No.1 overlord clan of Tang of the East could hardly restore its the power and influence in the future.

In this sense, Emperor Leng and the Xia Clan were totally defeated.

They were destroyed and had absolutely no strength left for counterattack or even struggle.

When trillions of living creatures in Tang of the East knew what Dao Yuanzi, Emperor Leng and the Xia Clan had done, they were filled with raging indignation. They would never forgive Emperor Leng or let her control their country even if she started all over again someday.

When the entire Eternal World was impressed and moved by this fierce battle, all the cultivators in this world remembered a name:

Jian Wushuang.

He was such a super genius and had created so many miracles on the battlefield.

He was the cause of this battle.

He was also the hero of this battle. He had completely turned the tables on his enemies during this battle by annihilating the Xia Clan’s Immortal Army.

He had defeated Ancestor Xia Yong of the Xia Clan with just three fingers.

When Dao Yuanzi’s evil plan had been exposed and everyone on his side had felt helpless, he had saved everyone and suppressed Dao Yuanzi with amazing powers.

He was no doubt a hero with astounding capabilities.

In the meantime, all the cultivators found it hard to believe that this dazzling hero and creator of miracles on the battlefield was just an expert with Eternal Realm.

Therefore, they could only describe him as a genius, an exceptional genius or even a monster.

To their great disappointment, this genius died during the unprecedentedly fierce battle.

Everyone present at the scene had witnessed his death: he turned himself into a dense blood fog, from which no one could manage to come back to life.

No matter how much the warriors admired his abilities and strengths, they could only sigh wistfully every time they thought of him.

Gradually, ten years passed.

During those years, Jian Wushuang gradually became just a name in a legend, which would be mentioned occasionally by the people in the world.

No matter how amazing he had been, he could hardly avoid the fate of being gradually forgotten by them.

No one expected Jian Wushuang, this legendary figure in the history of Tang of the East and the Eternal World, to be able to come back to life 10 years after he had turned himself into a blood fog.

At this moment, a red worm beast with countless tentacles was crouching inside a cave mansion several thousand kilometers below the ground.

A dark golden light spot was floating inside the void in front of its head.

“Gu King, where are we?” Jian Wushuang’s voice came from the light spot. He had just regained his consciousness.

“That’s not important. You just need to know that you’re safe here. You can restore your body as soon as possible at this place,” replied Gu King.

“Restore my body?” Jian Wushuang said dryly.

He had spent ten years reviving his consciousness contained in the drop of Ancient God Essence Blood, which was dark golden in color, and now he had to restore his body step by step based on this drop of blood, which was the only remaining part of his body.

“It took me so many years to restore my consciousness. Compared to this process, body restoration is much more complicated. I don’t know how long it will take to complete this job,” added Jian Wushuang.

“Well, it was you who did this to yourself, wasn’t it?” Gu King teased. “If you had followed my advice and left with your little girlfriend, none of this would’ve happened. Your body would be alright, so would the 70 percent of Essence Blood of King Luo Zhen.”

Jian Wushuang was struck speechless but deep inside his heart, he did not feel regret for his choice at all.

“Fortunately, you always stick to an Inverse Cultivation method, and when your body turned into a blood fog, you happened to be at the level where you were equipped with Everlasting Realm. This Realm enabled you to come back to life. Without it, you were dead long ago,” added Gu King, somewhat grumpily.

Jian Wushuang chuckled bitterly while feeling that he had to agree with Gu King.

Forcing himself to absorb all the remaining Essence Blood of King Luo Zhen could be considered as a suicide behavior.

Nevertheless, with the help of Everlasting Realm, he did not need to worry about his own life. As long as he still remained at this level of cultivation, he would never succeed in killing himself no matter how hard he tried.

As long as there was a drop of his blood left in this world, he could survive.

Not to mention that Gu King had quickly spotted and protected the drop of blood when his body had exploded into a blood fog.

“Oh, yeah, what happened after that battle?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“What else could happen? You killed Dao Yuanzi and demolished his Life Devouring Formation. As such, you guys won the battle, but you suffered heavy losses as well,” said Gu King. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“My side suffered heavy losses.

“This battle must’ve greatly sapped the strength of Tang of the East.” Jian Wushuang could not help but sigh in his heart, although this result met his expectations.

“I’ll restore my body and regain my powers as quickly as I can. I have to return to Tang of the East as early as possible,” said Jian Wushuang.
