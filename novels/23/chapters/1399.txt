Chapter 1400: Ling Feibai

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Everyone watched the rotation battles.

The genius named Duan Tianhong won all nine battles. He naturally became the first among Universe Gods in the First Heaven in Lineage of Star. He and the other four disciples among the top five became disciples of Star Palace.

The battle among Universe Gods in the First Heaven in Lineage of Star ended then.

There was discussion in the surroundings of Titanic Star.

“Duan Tianhong is strong as usual!”

“He got his quota to be a disciple of Star Palace winning first place during the last session and it’s the same for this session as well!”

“I heard that he would be going through his God’s Test in the Second Heaven. Once he passes through it, he will become a disciple of Universe God in the Second Heaven. By then, it’d would be hopeless for him to get the first place in the battle.”

“To be able to win the first place for the battle is impressive enough.”

Everyone was astonished.

At the beginning of the battle, the disciples of Star Palace and ordinary disciples would take part. If one were to perform a failing power, the disciples of Star Palace might be degraded into an ordinary disciple while the ordinary disciples might stand a chance to become disciples of Star Palace.

Considering the current session’s participants, it was expected that the five quotas for the disciples of Star Palace were within everyone’s abilities.

When the battle among Universe Gods in the First Heaven ended, it would naturally be followed by a battle amongst Universe Gods in the Second Heaven.

“All disciples who are Universe Gods in the Second Heaven, please come forward,” A deacon elderly gathered them on Titanic Star.

All of the disciples who were Universe Gods in the Second Heaven and the few disciples of Star Palace, including Jian Wushuang, stepped foot on Titanic Star one after another.

“Disciples who are Universe Gods in the Second Heaven in Lineage of Star are more than Universe Gods in the First Heaven?” Jian Wushuang looked around. Including himself, there was a total of fifty two Universe Gods in the Second Heaven in Lineage of Star.

Some of the disciples stayed in mystery land or wandered outside for a long time. Some cultivated in seclusion. Hence, Jian Wushuang didn’t see them much.

Until before the battle started, these disciples were gathered together.

Fifty-two genius disciples fighting for only five quotas of disciples of Star Palace.

“The four of them…”

Jian Wushuang looked at four people in the crowd. The four of them were like him, disciples of Star Palace. The one that most revered was a handsome youth. The handsome youth had a gentle smile that people found friendly.

However, everyone around him knew how scary that person was.

“He’s the strongest amongst the disciples who are Universe Gods in the Second Heaven in Lineage of Star, Ling Feibai?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the handsome youth and his pupils contracted.

In the past years of him staying in Lineage of Star, he had found out about the top geniuses in Lineage of Star.

Amongst Universe Gods in the Second Heaven, Ling Feibai was undeniably the top.

Just like Duan Tianhong who had won first place among Universe Gods in the First Heaven. Maybe… Even scarier!

“It is said that Ling Feibai once fought a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven when he was wandering outside. In the end, they were tied!” Jian Wushuang recalled his fighting results and gasped in silence.

A Universe God in the Second Heaven who was on par with a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven!

Ling Feibai wasn’t an inverse cultivator.

With his fighting result, he wasn’t looked down upon!

There were many disciples who were Universe Gods in the Second Heaven who treated Ling Feibai as a true monster. No one had the guts to fight against him.

Of course, among those people, Jian Wushuang was not included.

“Ling Feibai, I really want to fight him,” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands together and smiled faintly.

Besides Ling Feibai, the other three disciples of Star Palace weren’t weak either. Amongst them, there was Xia Feng who had bad beef with Jian Wushuang. He was extremely powerful too.

However, besides the few disciples of Star Palace, the rest of the people – even the strongest among ordinary disciples, Luo Quan – Jian Wushuang didn’t care about.

“It is needless for me to say the rules. Whoever’s name is called, please head over to the tower.”

The deacon elderly’s voice spread and he started reading names,”First, Lu Yun.”

Then, the ordinary disciple, Lu Yun, whose name was called, immediately walked towards the wormhole and stepped into it.

After she entered the wormhole, she came out in a few breaths time.

When she came out, she looked like a mess and she looked embarrassed too.

“Next…”

A disciple entered the tower. Most of them stayed in the tower for about ten breaths time.

It was the standard of a normal ordinary disciple. Those who were more outstanding, such as Luo Quan, Lu Han and the other few, stayed for more than fifteen breaths time in the tower.

As for the few disciples of Star Palace, they performed even better.

Especially Ling Feibai!

Vroom!

When Ling Feibai came out from the wormhole, it was dead silent in the Titanic Star.

Everyone looked at Ling Feibai in astonishment. There was surge of emotion in everyone’s heart.

“Forty-one breaths time. He stayed in the tower for forty-one breaths time!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Oh my God! Besides him, the other one who performed the best among the disciples who are Universe Gods in the Second Heaven merely stayed in the tower for twenty breaths time. This is unheard of!”

“Ling Feibai is so scary!”

Everyone was shocked. Everyone found it unbelievable.

Ling Feibai’s performance was too astonishing.

“This young man.”

Xia Feng in the scarlet robe, who was a disciple of Star Palace, shook his head in silence. He obviously couldn’t be compared favorably.

“That monster,” Luo Quan gasped in silence. He was the top among the ordinary disciples. In the battle, he stood a chance to grab the quota to be a disciple of Star Palace. However, even if he became a disciple of Star Palace, he wasn’t bold enough to challenge Ling Feibai.

“He stayed in the tower for forty-one breaths time. Ling Feibai is really amazing,” Jian Wushuang complimented.

The battle continued and the disciples entered the tower one after another.

Soon, it was Jian Wushuang’s turn.

“Next, Jian Wushuang!”

Along with the deacon elderly’s calling, everyone’s gazes suddenly fixed on Jian Wushuang.

Those gazes were strange.

Among them were some who were sneering, taunting and making fun of him.

“Look, disciples in Star Palace, our senior Jian Wushuang is here!”

“Jian Wushuang? I have been wandering in mystery land, I didn’t know him. But when I returned, I saw the mirror images of him fighting with other disciples. I’ve got to ask, how did he even qualify to be a disciple of Star Palace?”

“Who knows? It doesn’t matter now. He will become an ordinary disciple after the battle.”
