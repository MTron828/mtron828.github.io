Chapter 5279: 10,000-Fold Divine Body

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After fully repairing his injuries, Jian Wushuangs spiritual consciousness returned, and his true form descended.

He slowly opened his eyes. Within the deep golden irises, a hint of crimson remained, exuding an evil aura.

Ever since breaking through the fifth level, that pressure returned once more. However, his powerful mental strength continued to suppress the malevolent energy relentlessly.

Standing up, Jian Wushuang clenched his fists, and a faint bow formed in his body. The red mark on his forehead began to glow.

The third eye, the Eye of the Candle Dragon, erupted completely, operating at its limit.

“Beast God!”

Jian Wushuang roared lowly. The ground beneath his feet became smooth, instantly boiling as a massive disc appeared.

Above it was marked the totem of the Candle Dragon.

Roar!

An enormous Candle Dragon shadow, tens of thousands of meters long, soared from beneath his feet, its dragon roar unparalleled in the world.

“Domain!”

Swoosh!

The flat totem beneath his feet transformed into a blood-stained space, and the Candle Dragon completely turned into a living creature.

It was a pity that the Candle Dragon Wings could not stack, or else it would have been much stronger than it was now.

A faint red flame began to rise from his body.

His divine body continued to increase in size.

The basic divine body, initially three thousand times, quickly amplified to five thousand times. “7,000 times!” “8,000 times!” “9,000…” “9,998!’

“10,000 times!”

The once faint red flame had turned crimson by now.

The Demonic Annihilation Armor had all been dyed into a dark red battle armor.

A 1,000-fold divine body, he had achieved it.

Now, all he needed to do was maintain it, maintain this state for 10,000 years.

According to what Qiuhuang and the man in the black armor had said, after completing each Refinement trial, he could recuperate, giving him some breathing room.

However, in the end, he still had to maintain it for several hundred, even a thousand years.

“Phew! ”

Jian Wushuang exhaled a long breath. After his body straightened completely, he stood at around nine feet tall.

“Senior, I’m prepared. We can open the Refinement trial tower now,” he said.

As his voice fell, a figure rose again from the cosmic bronze furnace.

The middle-aged man in black armor looked at Jian Wushuang with a complex expression and slowly said, “A 10,000-fold divine body… You might barely be able to hold on, but I wish you good luck.”

With a deep finger movement from the man, the trial tower emitted a buzzing sound, and then the first floor of the tower shone brightly.

“Go in!”

Jian Wushuang bowed once more in gratitude and then, without any hesitation, stepped directly into the first floor of the trial tower.

The black-armored figure watched as Jian Wushuang entered the trial tower, his eyes filled with astonishment.

When Jian Wushuang had just arrived, he had sensed a peculiar aura emanating from him, especially after he had restored his origin source; that aura had become even stronger.

“Who is he, really?” the man in black armor mumbled, his face etched with doubt. “If he were the incarnation of a true god, Zhen Ling should have noticed, shouldn’t he?”

After hesitating for a moment, he returned to the Universe Bronze Furnace, a plan forming in his mind.

Little did Jian Wushuang know that he had caught someone’s attention.

While others were chosen by Zhen Ling, he was different; he had caught the eye of a Demon Lord. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Swish!

Once he stepped into the trial tower, he realized that this pocket dimension was drastically different from the purgatory he had imagined.

This place was like a secluded paradise, a tranquil valley teeming with ordinary creatures—cattle, sheep, horses, and other wild animals.

Ding!

As soon as Jian Wushuang landed, before he could react, his identity token received a message.

“Within ten years, consume all the livestock in this area.” “Huh?!” Jian Wushuang stared at the token, dumbfounded.

Eat everything?

Wasn’t this too easy?

If it was just about eating, he could devour it all in one gulp.

But when he tried to mobilize his Yan power, he found that he couldn’t.

He couldn’t even retrieve anything from his Sumeru World.

Now, apart from his robust physical body, he was no different from an ordinary person.

Ever since he had landed on the grassy field outside the valley, he couldn’t even fly.

Then he saw the geese gliding gracefully in the sky above.

Jian Wushuang was utterly baffled!

What kind of trial was this? He had spent so many treasure points, only to be tasked with learning how to hunt like an ordinary human.

After contemplating for a while, he still didn’t know where to start.

In this line of work, he truly had no experience whatsoever.

It wasn’t until his stomach started rumbling loudly that he realized the long-lost sensation of hunger.

The heavy armor clung to his body, incredibly burdensome. He began to remove the armor, leaving himself in a light suit which felt comfortable. His movements were swift and sharp; he could probably leap about a Zhang high, quite different from an ordinary person.

Until, he saw a wild boar, nearly the length of a zhang, ramming into a fruit tree madly. After the fruits fell, it would collect them and eat.

Jian Wushuang swallowed hard.

Looking around, he picked up a stone and aimed at his first prey, the wild boar.

In the time it took for an incense stick to burn, beneath the fruit tree, only Jian Wushuang was left standing, or rather, he was barely standing, leaning against a tree.

The wild boar strolled leisurely towards the only river in the valley to drink water.

Jian Wushuang clutched his aching stomach; this feeling was even worse than when he was fighting for his life.

A sense of helplessness washed over him.

Jian Wushuang gritted his teeth and picked up some fruits that the wild boar didn’t care for. He rubbed them against his body and, as he bit into one, almost spat it out immediately.

A taste so unbearable, it seemed the fruit wasn’t ripe at all.

Jian Wushuang, looking quite bedraggled, found it difficult even to walk. He felt like his ribs had been broken by the wild boar.

Luckily, he was slightly stronger than an average person; otherwise, he might have been left behind by the wild boar.

Stumbling, he made his way towards the river, about three feet wide. First, he washed his face, which cleared his head a bit. Then he drank the clear water from the river greedily.

He continued to drink until he felt somewhat satiated before stopping.

Lying flat on the grass, he turned his head and saw that the tusked wild boar was now upstream from him.

The water he had just ingested suddenly felt tasteless.

The sky gradually darkened.

In the daytime, the valley was bathed in sunlight, but at night, it was filled with the howls of wolves.

If it were in the past, it wouldn’t be a big deal, but now Jian Wushuangs fighting capacity was not even as good as that of a wild boar. He had to be careful.

Before it got completely dark, he climbed up the crooked-necked tree.

A sleepless night left his eye sockets somewhat sunken.

At ten in the morning, he went with the herd of livestock to the river to drink water, but this time, he was smarter and went to the upper reaches.

Although he was not very satisfied, at least he wouldn’t feel as uncomfortable. At least he had survived a day. He also ate quite a few ripe fruits in the tree, gaining a bit of confidence.

Dealing with wild boars was out of the question.

Apart from wild boars, there were also foolish deer in the mountains, a slightly smaller threat. He could start with them.

After deciding on a plan, Jian Wushuang began to explore the forest on the

mountainside..
