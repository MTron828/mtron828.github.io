Chapter 5303 - 5303: Tenth Refinement

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The senior either underestimated the situation or believed that this universe would produce two supremely powerful beings.

Regardless, these two individuals would be the focus of future cultivation, especially Jian Wushuang.

However, one couldn’t reveal too many details, as it might shift from being unintentional to intentional. After reaching the summit, there would likely be a scrutiny of one’s entire life.

Powerful individuals like them didn’t want to be treated as pawns.

The universe revolved.

The heavens and earth spun!

All the laws had long been established.

Breaking free from space, mastering time!

Though not in this particular time and space, they existed in a corner of the starry sky.

Demon Sound Mountain.

In the Universe Bronze Furnace, the extinguished consciousness unexpectedly reformed, and the origin source and divine body erupted once again.

Jian Wushuang had somehow come back to life.

“This?”

Even he felt a bit bewildered. All of this was real; he had come back to life.

Death lingered at the moment it had just occurred.

The force of revival propelled him back to his peak. Without much time to ponder, the shattered divine body and origin source had already integrated into his flesh. The scorching heat of the flames once again swept over him.

This time, in his peak state and armed with the experience from just moments ago, he managed to withstand it.

Willpower is related to one’s state of mind. The stronger his state of mind, the more resilient his willpower.

He endured through the first wave, the second wave, and even the final wave,

Originally intended to temper his physical body, now both the origin source and the divine body were simultaneously refining into his flesh.

The first in history!

Even Zhen Ling couldn’t help but be shocked when witnessing this.

“Is this the Tenth Refinement?”

“Haha, it seems a little guy has created the Tenth Refinement, let’s add another layer!” Zhen Ling waved his hand, and Jian Wushuangs figure entered another space.

Just as he was thinking of finding a reason to bestow treasures upon Jian Wushuang, it seemed that the opportunity had presented itself.

However, this was also because Jian Wushuang was strong enough to resist and even innovatively create the Tenth Refinement.

Swoosh!

After being transported to another space, Jian Wushuang took a good look at his own body.

The entire body was naked.

The skin was crystal clear, exceptionally round, and due to the skeletal structure, his upper body was extremely strong.

Only the hair had changed color, turning white.

White hair and face, with only the eyes carrying a hint of blood, the Candle Dragon Eye on his forehead emitting a glow.

“Phew! ”

With a breath, it was indeed a clone.

The clone had no aura.

“Transform! ”

Swoosh!

The clone instantly turned into a feather, lightly floating. Jian Wushuangs thought power was extremely strong, enveloping the feather, making it impossible to perceive any aura on it, just feeling like an ordinary feather. “Such ability is even more powerful than what Qiuhuang described!”

Jian Wushuangs face lit up with joy.

Before he could fully enjoy it, a phantom woman suddenly appeared in front of him.

“Jian Wushuang!’

The woman’s voice was cold, startling Jian Wushuang.

Just as he was about to bow in greeting, he suddenly realized that he was not wearing anything. He quickly took out a clean python robe from the Sumeru World and put it on.

White hair, adorned with the python robe, gave him a majestic aura.

Facing the cold woman, Jian Wushuang cautiously responded.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He had initially thought he would directly enter the Demon-Sealing Space or be welcomed by Shan Jun. Unexpectedly, a phantom woman appeared suddenly.

“On the orders of Zhen Ling, I hereby reward you for creating the Tenth Refinement of the supreme physique!’

Jian Wushuang was somewhat puzzled, “The Tenth Refinement?”

Could it be because he refined both the divine body and the origin source together?

Indeed, there was a possibility of this nature. No wonder his physical body was much stronger than Qiuhuang had described, able to simulate various substances.

After receiving the reward, without even having the chance to thank this

‘Zhen Ling, the illusory woman departed.

She came quickly and left just as swiftly.

Jian Wushuang didn’t dwell on it. He wasn’t aware that the illusory woman was a transformation of Zhen Ling within the Qishen Temple.

The Demon Sound Mountain had almost been emptied; there were no more figures there, and the Emperors couldn’t enter. The Elder Palace had just taken over, and it was unlikely for them to arrive so quickly.

With a wave of his hand, the reward jade box flew over.

Upon opening it, Jian Wushuang was pleasantly surprised to find a light green board inside.

Fitting perfectly on his thumb, he put it on, and at that moment, a scene appeared in his mind.

It was a majestic deity teaching sentient beings in his own Daoist temple.

Above the Daoist temple, many people were seated.

The scene gradually disappeared.

Jian Wushuang only remembered that there were several ancient characters written above, ‘Qishen’!

He recognized it.

It was Qishen lecturing, and on Qishen’s right thumb, holding an ancient book, there was also a light green board.

At this moment, Jian Wushuangs breath became constrained. Regardless of whether this board had any practical use, it held great significance as a collector’s item.

A board that Qishen had carried for years inevitably contained Qishen’s aura to some extent or even encapsulated Qishen’s Great Dao, making it extremely precious.

He carefully rotated the board. His mind became ethereal, and his cultivation speed increased by more than a hundredfold. Moreover, this board contained a miniature universe.

He moved it slightly.

The enormous black and white Yin-Yang Taiji Array suddenly appeared.

It was actually an array!

An array that protected tranquility!

Although this treasure didn’t substantially enhance his strength, it was undoubtedly the top-notch auxiliary treasure.

For a moment, holding it in his hands, he found it hard to let go.

This feeling, he hadn’t experienced in countless years. Like a child with a toy, he couldn’t stop playing.

His entire spirit improved significantly, and his thought power was stronger than before.

“It’s time to leave.’

Jian Wushuang stood in place, waiting quietly.

Hum!

His feet rotated slightly, radiating numerous rays of light.

He hadn’t noticed!

In an instant, his figure disappeared from the original spot and reappeared at the summit of the Demon Sound Mountain.

Jian Wushuang looked around. The place where the Demon-Sealing Pillar was placed now had a deep pit.

What happened?

Where was Shan Jun?

The surroundings had changed too.

The Demon Sound Mountain, which was initially in a void, was now within a lake. Though vast, Jian Wushuang guessed it was a lake because it was freshwater.

The sky was azure!

It had been a long time since he entered the real world.

“Little guy!

A familiar voice rang out, pulling Jian Wushuangs thoughts back.

Turning around, he was surprised to see the old man with goat horns.

“Senior Yang, why are you here?” Jian Wushuang asked in amazement.

Yang Sanmu smiled faintly. “l should be the one surprised that you’re here!”

Listening to the old man, Jian Wushuang learned that the Demon Sound Mountain had been moved to the core of the Four Major Secret Realms, and Shan Jun had been captured.

This made Jian Wushuang feel extremely guilty; it must be the calamity

caused by devouring that universe origin source.

If, one day, he attained the Dao, he would surely rescue Shan Jun.

For this reason, he unknowingly accumulated a lot of karma..
