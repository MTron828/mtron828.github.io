Half a day later.

“Real God Dan Ding and Real God Ming Xin should have left. We can take action now,” Elder Wu Liang sent a message.

“I shall greet Real God Shi Jue at the bar first. The two of you hurry over then,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Alright,” Elder Wu Liang and Elder Fei Yan nodded as they plunged over quickly from outside of the town.

Jian Wushuang moved into the bar.

In the bar, there was a prohibition that covered the private room which Real God Shi Jue was in. Any ordinary probing wouldn’t notice his existence, naturally, he wasn’t worried that anyone could find him.

After all, not everyone was like Jian Wushuang. He had Soul Power.

“I, Shi Jue, was forced into a corner by Lineage of Star. I had no choice but to hide in the Holy Kingdom far away from Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. Fortunately, God pitied me and gave me a chance to turn things around!”

“As long as I can become a member in Alliance Sanctuary and cultivate on Thunderbolt Island, even Lineage of Star will face various limitations. At least in many places, they can’t kill me openly and I will get aid from some resources on Thunderbolt Island to increase my power.”

“One day, when my power increases tremendously and I become the top Chaotic Real God like Real God Jiu Gong who is an expert on Real God ranking list, Lineage of Star wouldn’t be able to do anything to me.”

Real God Shi Jue clenched his fists tight.

In Eternal Chaotic World, there were some top experts who had offended large power forces but still lived well.

Just like Real God Jiu Gong from Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom, he was a classic example.

He fought Lineage of Star ferociously. He dared not enter Lineage of Star’s territory but the experts from Lineage of Star didn’t dare to enter his Holy Kingdom either. Regardless of the person, he wouldn’t hesitate to kill whoever entered. Lineage of Star could do nothing about it either.

After all, Real God Jiu Gong was a superb existence on the fifth place on Real God ranking list. In terms of fighting power, he could be compared favorably with an Almighty.

Real God Shi Jue wanted to become the second Real God Jiu Gong.

“This is my only chance to flip over. I must seize the chance!”

Real God Shi Jue cleaned his hand and thought but his face suddenly changed. He noticed that someone had ignored the surrounding prohibition and walked through it.

“Huh? There’s someone in the private room? I thought there was no one.” A Universe God carrying a sword on his back appeared before Real God Shi Jue.

Real God Shi Jue squinted his eyes slightly and glanced at the Universe God, “Get out!”

“Hehe, don’t be so hot tempered,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and took a seat before Real God Shi Jue. He then raised a glass casually, “It’s boring to drink alone. Why not let me keep you company, Real God Shi Jue?”

At first, Real God thought Jian Wushuang was an idiot that barged into the private room by accident. But when Jian Wushuang called his name, Real God Shi Jue’s face suddenly stiffened.

“Who are you?” Real God Shi Jue spoke with a deep voice.

“In this world, one who would find you at the first instant when they found out Real God Shi Jue’s whereabouts. Who do you think I am?” Jain Wushuang smiled.

“Lineage of Star,” Real God Shi Jue’s face grew grave. He immediately spread his consciousness power but he didn’t notice any strong aura within his consciousness range that bothered him. There was only the Universe God before him. Real God Shi Jue became uncertain.

After all, Lineage of Star had finally found him. They wouldn’t just send a Universe God to kill him, right?

“Real God Shi Jue, you dare to kill the disciples of Star Palace from Lineage of Star and you killed two of them at once. You really have guts,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

But suddenly… Vroom! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

A shocking sword intention instantly exploded.

The entire room was immediately filled with the bolt of sword intention.

Blood Mountain Sword on Jian Wushuang’s back was out of the scabbard.

“Such a swift stroke!”

Previously, Real God Shi Jue didn’t worry about Jian Wushuang who was only a Universe God. But the moment Jian Wushuang struck with his sword, his pupils contracted in shock.

Wow!

A sword light flashed and Real God Shi Jue had already moved to the side to dodge the stroke. Then, the sword light dispersed and the room remained complete. The surrounding prohibition continued to exist and the table before Jian Wushuang only cracked when Jian Wushuang disappeared entirely.

“His strength control is so perfect?” There was shock across Real God Shi Jue’s face but then…

Hong!

A terrifying aura was like an awakened dragon that swept out. It was illustriously pressuring.

Jian Wushuang took into consideration that it was a pub and there were many cultivators in the pub. Hence, he controlled the power of the performed sword principle to not affect the other cultivators. However, Real God Shi Jue obviously didn’t care much.

His aura as an Eternal Real God was extremely fierce. He shattered the entre pub like breaking a piece of dead wood.

The cultivators in the pub plunged out simultaneously and ran far away.

Jian Wushuang and Real God Shi Jue appeared in the void. But the moment they appeared, Real God Shi Jue immediately noticed two fierce auras plunging over from the surroundings.

“These two are Real God Wu Liang and Real God Fei Yan from Lineage of Star!”

“D*mn it!”

Real God Shi Jue’s face changed.

“Shi Jue, you can’t escape,” Real God Wu Liang (Elder)’s face was cold and his robe fluttered. He had another black sword that appeared in his hand.

“Today, you have to die!”

Real God Fei Yan had rage soaring into the sky too. After he spoke, rumble. A flush of green torrents flowed out like a raging tsunami. It swept out and covered the heaven and earth. Suddenly, the void surrounding Real God Shi Jue was covered.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Among the green torrents, there was a huge green hand and there were waves that stirred the space. They pressed towards Real God Shi Jue together.

There was a dim light on Real God Shi Jue’s body. Then, there was a black, exotic beast that soared up from his body and his gaze was as sharp as an eagle’s. As his aura churned, it turned into ghosts that twinkled in the void. It shuttled to and fro and dodged the huge green hands and green waves that billowed against him at ease.

At the same time, his body wanted to rush over from the besiegement of the three of them.

“Real God Shi Jue’s martial art motion is really impressive,” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and the Power of Spacetime suddenly rippled outwards.

Jian Wushuang moved!

A total of almost a hundred shadows were cast at the same time. With the aid of the Power of Spacetime, Jian Wushuang’s hundred shadows were like fish that were frightened and shuttling around in the water.

In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang appeared next to Real God Shi Jue.

“This Universe God is really fast and his martial art motion is so creepy!”

Real God Shi Jue saw Jian Wushuang’s arrival and there was shock in his eyes.

Then, he saw Jian Wushuang wield his sword.
