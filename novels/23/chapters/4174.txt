4175 A Palm Strike

Jian Wushuang was not dead. It was the Ruler Blood Wave who had sent them the news.

After all, the magic lamp that Jian Wushuang had left in the divine Palace of life was still lit. Although he was not dead, he had lost contact with them all these years. There was no news at all. It was obvious that he was not in a good situation.

In fact, after Jian Wushuang’s great change in the second level, his body was controlled by the sword spirit of the Tarot Divine Sword. For thousands of years, he naturally could not contact the outside world. And now, Jian Wushuang had just come out.

“Let’s go. Most of the Omega Rulers who wish to join us have already arrived. All we need to do is select a few of the most elite of them, and then have you personally lead them. I imagine that should be enough to defeat Ruler Silver Roc’s side.” Divine Marquis Qingfeng said.

The Ninth Kalpa King nodded, and a hint of coldness flashed in his eyes.

There were not many opportunities left in the Tarot Ruins, and he still had not heard anything about the second level that King Zhufeng had mentioned. It was probably only King Zhufeng’s guess.

Now that things had come to this, there was no longer a need to stay in the Tarot Ruins.

But…

Before he left, it was time to settle some grudges!

The Blood Nether Emissaries, Lord Zhennan, and the Ruler Silver Roc will not be able to escape!

Ninth Kalpa King’s eyes glinted coldly. Divine Marquis Qingfeng followed closely behind him and strode out of the palace.

…

A moment later, the two of them walked out of the palace, and the crowd immediately burst into a commotion.

“It’s the Ninth Kalpa King! the Ninth Kalpa King has come out!”

“The Ninth Kalpa King is really strong! The divine power aura around his body is not on the same level as mine!”

The eyes of the Ultimate Rulers flashed with a hint of fervour.

An expert would be respected and worshipped wherever he went, and the Ninth Kalpa King was the well-deserved expert among the Ultimate Rulers!

The Ninth Kalpa King’s expression did not change at all when he heard these exclamations. He glanced at the Ultimate Ruler outside the palace and said indifferently, “If you want to join my camp, you can. I only have one request, and that is to be able to take one of my palm strikes!”

“Come, let me see your strength.”

After saying that, the Ninth Kalpa King took a step forward. He stepped into the void and looked down at the Rulers.

“This…”

When the many Ultimate Rulers heard this, they looked at each other, uncertain.

They did not expect that the requirement to join the Ninth Kalpa King’s camp was to take a palm from him!

This was far beyond their expectations.

Among the Ultimate Rulers, the Ninth Kalpa King’s strength was comparable to that of the Supremes. Although they were also Ultimate Rulers, many of whom were top Ultimate Rulers, they were not sure if they could withstand one move from the Ninth Kalpa King.

The originally noisy crowd had become unusually quiet at this moment.

For a moment, no one actually dared to take a move from the Ninth Kalpa King.

At the outermost part of the crowd, Jian Wushuang, who was dressed in a loose black robe with a hood covering most of his face, could not help but smile.

The Ninth Kalpa King was still as conceited as ever.

Jian Wushuang muttered to himself and then he smiled.

“What’s wrong? There are so many of you here, yet none of you have the courage to take a single move from me?” The Ninth Kalpa King stepped into the void, looked down at the crowd, and said indifferently.

As soon as he finished speaking, there was a commotion in the crowd.

And then, a muscular Ultimate Ruler with a sledgehammer in his hand soared into the sky.

“Ninth Kalpa King, I, the Golden Ape, am here to experience it!” This Ultimate Ruler’s body was like an iron tower, and he gave off an extremely oppressive feeling. He raised his head and said with an arrogant expression, everyone says that the Ninth Kalpa King is the strongest Ruler, even comparable to a Supreme. “Today, I’ll see if you, the Ninth Kalpa King, are really that strong!”

“You talk too much.” The Ninth Kalpa King was expressionless. He directly raised his palm and slapped down at the Golden Ape!

“Rumble!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

In an instant, countless divine powers surged and formed a giant palm that covered the sky!

This palm covered the entire sky. In the face of this palm, the Golden Ape Ruler was as small as an ant.

“Take this palm and I’ll allow you to join my camp.” The Ninth Kalpa King retracted his hand and stood with his hands behind his back, his expression indifferent.

The giant palm was surging with power as it slammed down on the Golden Ape.

Break!!!

“Die!” The Golden Ape God bellowed in rage as it saw this palm strike that seemed as if the heavens were about to collapse. It raised its giant hammer and smashed it down!

Waves of divine power gathered in his arms. The muscles on his arms twisted and twisted, emitting a terrifying power.

Bang!

This hammer and the Ninth Kalpa King’s palm collided together!

A surge of divine power burst forth, causing the entire mountain range to shake.

Ruler Golden Ape spat out a mouthful of blood as he was sent flying back. He crashed into the ground, creating a small crater in the mountain range.

The light from the palm did not dim in the slightest. It was as if it had been stung by an ant as it continued to strike down at the Golden Ape.

“No!”

“This…!” The Golden Ape was stunned.

At this moment, he truly understood how great the difference in strength was between the Ninth Kalpa King and an ordinary Ultimate Ruler like him!

“He’s too weak.”

The Ninth Kalpa King shook his head and waved his hand. The huge palm in the sky gradually dissipated.

“Carry it away, next one.” The Ninth Kalpa King retracted his gaze and looked at the others again.

The entire place was silent, leaving only the sound of heavy breathing.

They were simply scared out of their wits by the Ninth Kalpa King’s palm. It was too strong! Although the Golden Ape was not one of the top-tier Ultimate Rulers, it was still extremely powerful. Yet, it could not even take a single palm.

This Ninth Kalpa King’s strength was on a completely different level from them!

They could tell that if the Ninth Kalpa King had not held back at the end, this palm would have been enough to kill the Golden Ape Ruler.

“No one else?” The Ninth Kalpa King said indifferently.

No one in the crowd replied for a long time. After a long time, a middle-aged man wearing cloth clothes and straw shoes and holding a divine spear walked out of the crowd.

“Ruler Spear River, I’m here to ask Ninth Kalpa King for advice.” The middle-aged man’s expression was solemn. the divine spear in his hand was as white as a rainbow. he was extremely nervous.

“Take my palm!” The Ninth Kalpa King did not say much. Just like before, he continued to slap down at Ruler Spear River.

“Swish!”

Ruler Spear River raised his head to look at the palm. He first took a deep breath, then let out an explosive roar and charged into the sky!

“Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang!!!”

“Die!” A cold light exploded from Ruler Spear River’s divine spear, and then he thrust it out like a dragon, striking out 789 times in succession!

The spear shadows intertwined and stacked on top of each other like an impenetrable curtain of rain. They smashed onto the giant palm.

A moment later, the power of the giant palm gradually dissipated, and the sky returned to its clear state.
