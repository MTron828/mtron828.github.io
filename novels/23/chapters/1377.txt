Chapter 1378: Soul Master!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the ancient forest, the youth in the crimson robe who was carrying a long sword slowly moved forward.

“It smells of blood. It is quite pungent. It seems that there are always fights in this forest,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Swoosh!

A crimson flowing light swept past the forest. Jian Wushuang stopped under a big tree but his gaze was fixed in front of him.

There was a two-meter tall figure at the open space before him.

“This should be the beast in Tian Ling Mystery Land, right?” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

The beast before him was huge in size and it had three humongous heads. The eyes were bloodshot red and it looked extremely ferocious.

When Jian Wushuang appeared, the three-headed beast responded. There were two bloodshot red eyes fixed on Jian Wushuang.

Then, rumble!

An extremely savage aura exploded from the beast and it charged towards Jian Wushuang like lightning.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes contracted but he didn’t draw his sword. There was a strong Soul Power that surged out from his body.

Suddenly, his Soul Power turned into a purple tiger and roared as it leaped forward.

Bang!

A loud thud and the three-headed beast groaned in pain. After the huge body plundered for a while, it finally fell on the ground.

“A purple tiger formed by Soul Power nearly collapsed from the crash?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

Although he had killed the beast, he obviously wasn’t happy with the attack earlier.

“Jian Wushuang, the usage of Soul Power requires continuous accumulation and practical training. You will familiarize with the method over time. You just mastered the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack. It is inevitable that you will seem a little rusty in using it. It will get better after a few more times,” King of Venomous Worm said.

“Mm.” Jian Wushuang nodded and continued to move forward.

…

In the mid-region of the forest, there happened to be a troop of over ten people moving forward slowly.

“We will reach the Fiery Lion King’s territory soon. Tread softly so that it won’t sense you and escape,” the man in the black shirt looked at his troop behind him.

“Mm,” Everyone nodded simultaneously and looked extremely solemn.

“Sissy, the Fiery Lion King is very powerful. Our troop can barely kill it. We can’t allocate another person to protect you. Don’t expose yourself. Find a place to hide. Until we kill the Fiery Lion King, you can’t come out. Understand?” The man in black shirt looked at one person and said.

“Mm,” the maiden in black that looked innocent nodded continuously, but her eyes were twinkling with excitement.

Soon, they arrived at the territory of the Fiery Lion King.

“It’s there!”

The man in the black shirt looked at the Fiery Lion King with the flaming red body which was more than three-meter tall and standing under a big tree. His eyes grew bright with the sight.

“Let’s do it!”

The troop, which was well prepared and had came specifically for the Fiery Lion King, immediately took action without hesitation.

“Roar!”

A fight immediately took place.

“Be careful!”

“D*mn it, the Fiery Lion King became even stronger than before?”

“Sh*t, it’s running away!”

“Let’s go after it!”

The troop started a chase with the Fiery Lion King in the forest.

Then, the direction where the Fiery Lion King was running towards had a figure in a crimson robe that was moving forward slowly.

“Huh?”

Jian Wushuang hauled his footstep. His Soul Power was spread all the time. He naturally could feel the Fiery Lion King that was running towards his direction almost instantly.

The Fiery Lion King was running towards where he was and it suddenly appeared before him.

“Roar!”

Looking at the youth in crimson robe blocking his way, the Fiery Lion King let out a raging bellow and charged towards Jian Wushuang.

“Be careful!”

“Move!”

The man in black and the people behind him who were chasing after the Fiery Lion King immediately shouted.

Jian Wushuang didn’t move an inch but looked at the Fiery Lion King charging towards himself as though he was dumbfounded by the sight. However, perceptive onlookers would see that there was a strange light twinkling his eyes. Vroom!

A shapeless force swept out and suddenly covered the body of the Fiery Lion King.

The Fiery Lion King was originally charging towards Jian Wushuang in total madness and at lightning speed. However, the force that swept out led to the diminishment of its terrifying speed and it was soon stopped entirely. Then, its dead body fell to the ground.

“What?”

The man in the black shirt and his troop ran over quickly and came beside the Fiery Lion King’s dead body. Looking at the dead body on the ground, all of them were astonished.

“The Fiery Lion King is a extremely strong second-level beast which could be compared to an ordinary two-starred Divine General. The person before us didn’t even move and he killed the Fiery Lion King?”

“Soul Master!”

“And he’s a very terrifying Soul Master. He’s at least a Peak two-starred Soul Master!”

The man in the black shirt fixed his gaze at Jian Wushuang and he quickly bowed politely the very next moment, “Xue Feng troop captain, Xue Feng. Greetings to the Soul Master. Thank you, Soul Master, for helping us to take care of the Fiery Lion King.”

“Soul Master?” Jian Wushuang lifted his eyebrows.

Before he departed, he found some information about Tian Ling Mystery Land. He also knew that there were two kinds of cultivators there. One was a warrior which was commonly seen and the other was the Soul Master that the man in the black shirt mentioned.

Soul Masters specialized in studying consciousness and soul.

In Tian Ling Mystery Land, Soul Masters were rarer than warriors and of a much higher class.

Whoever was Soul Master, even if he was just a one-starred Soul Master, which was the lowest ranking, would be respectable.

“Your troop came specially for the Fiery Lion King? Jian Wushuang asked coldly.

“Yes,” the man in black shirt, Xue Feng nodded, “Our troop came across the Fiery Lion King once. Unfortunately, it happened too suddenly and we weren’t prepared so it escaped. It even nearly killed one of us. Hence, our troop intentionally came to take revenge!”

“Oh, I see,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly, “The dead body of the Fiery Lion King should be quite valuable. Go ahead and take it.”

“You’re giving the dead body to us?” Xue Feng and the other cultivators in the group were stunned but they quickly understood.

“The dead body of a Fiery Lion King is not unimportant, but to someone who is at least a Peak two-starred Soul Master, it shouldn’t be anything,” Xue Feng thought to himself. He didn’t refuse and took the dead body of the Fiery Lion King into his Qian Kun Ring directly.

Then, the maiden in black that had been following at the back came over.

“Brother,” the maiden in black came before Xue Feng and asked with concern, “Are you okay?”

“It was nothing. Luckily, this master lent us a hand,” Xue Feng smiled and continued, “Sissy, quickly come and greet the Soul Master.”
