1951 Misunderstanding

Rumble.

The divine might of an Emperor God pressed the scene so mightily.

The experts from Green Fire World at the scene revealed an expression of terror and reverence.

Before an Emperor God, their strongest cultivator was only a Real God. They didn’t even have the guts to attack.

The purple-haired elder next to Emperor God Xie Xin was like a fox borrowing the awe of a tiger and roared, “Mister Emperor God came personally. Why aren’t you on your knees yet?!”

“Knees?”

Jian Wushuang’s gaze turned cold as he glanced at Emperor God Xie Xin, who was high above. He lifted the corners of his lips into a unique curve, “You told me to come and see you personally. When I came, you made me wait for a while. Now, you want me to kneel before you? Hehe, Emperor God Xie Xin, I really wonder who gave you the courage to do such things?”

Jian Wushuang’s voice had a tinge of disdain as it resounded in the universe.

Emperor God Xie Xin, who stood arrogantly above with his hands behind him, was shocked.

Since he had come to Green Fire World, although he put his power in display, he had never announced his name.

For instance, the Real Gods who sought his patronage only referred to him as Emperor God, but no one knew his name.

However, the person could call him by his name?

“You are…”

Emperor God Xie Xin looked down slightly. Only then, he finally looked at Jian Wushuang.

It was the first time he had looked at Jian Wushuang after he had walked out of the palace.

With one glance, he saw Jian Wushuang’s appearance and felt the unique aura clearly. Emperor God Xie Xin was stunned.

Not only his gaze but his expression stiffened.

Even his heart seemed to have stopped beating then.

The entire spacetime paused.

Only Emperor God Xie Xin was looking at Jian Wushuang in shock.

After a while… Vroom!

Emperor God Xie Xin quivered and he could feel as though his scalp had exploded.

“You, you are… Sword, Sword Emperor?” Emperor God Xie Xin stared at Jian Wushuang. His expression was as though he had seen a ghost.

He really thought he had seen a ghost.

A Sword Emperor who was famous for his bad name in Eternal Chaotic World. He, of course, could recognize him.

Emperor God Xie Xin was extremely fearful of Sword Emperor.

If he were to come across Jian Wushuang in Eternal Chaotic World, he definitely would take another route without hesitation and didn’t dare to offend him.

But then… He saw Sword Emperor in Green Fire World?

“How is this possible?”

“How could it be?”

“How could Sword Emperor be here?”

Emperor God Xie Xin was in disbelief.

The ancient battlefield where Green Fire World was was so secretive.

After over twelve thousand years of wandering, Emperor God Xie Xin was sure that the ancient battlefield had almost never been wandered before.

It was totally sealed off from Eternal Chaotic World.

Hence, Green Fire World on the ancient battlefield was naturally sealed off from the world as well.

He had never expected himself to come across any experts from Eternal Chaotic World there, let alone the infamous Sword Emperor.

Before he had taken action against Green Fire World, he had found out about Green Fire World and he also knew Wushuang City Master.

He also knew that Wushuang City Master was only a Real God. The truth was as such, he was only a Real God.

However, he had never expected Wushuang City Master to be Jian Wushuang!

“Wushuang City Master? Jian Wushuang?” Emperor God Xie Xin felt bitter.

Judging by the name itself, Wushuang City Master did carry the name Wushuang. However, there were so many people with the same name. Who would associate Wushuang City Master with Jian Wushuang?

“Emperor God Xie Xin!”

Emperor God Xie Xin was still astonished, terrorized and in disbelief when Jian Wushuang spoke again, “You haven’t replied to my question. I’d like to know who gave you such courage?”

Emperor God Xie Xin was stunned and he had yet to reply.

The purple-robed elder, who was like a fox borrowing the awe of a tiger, bellowed, “How dare you speak to Mister Emperor God like that?! Wushuang City Master, are you sick of living?”

The moment he said that, Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave.

However, Emperor God Xie Xin was covered in a cold sweat. He stole a glance at the purple-robed elder and he was still smiling in disdain.

Hong!

Emperor God Xie Xin slapped.

The purple-robed elder had yet to respond but bang! He had already become a cloud of bloody fog!

The sight shocked the surrounding people, especially the few Real Gods who sought the patronage of Emperor God Xie Xin.

Before they managed to ask, they saw Emperor God Xie Xin attacked again. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

There were a few continuous bangs. The few Real Gods who sought patronage from Emperor God Xie Xin turned into clouds of bloody fog and died.

After that, Emperor God Xie Xin then let out a breath of relief. Then, he looked at Jian Wushuang. On his malicious face, there was an awkward smile, “Sword Emperor, this is a misunderstanding, a great misunderstanding.”

‘A misunderstanding, a great misunderstanding’.

It reverberated through the universe and all cultivators in Green Fire World were astonished.

“A misunderstanding?” Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold, “I don’t think so, Emperor God Xie Xin. You wanted me to see you and I came. You wanted me to wait for you and I waited. Now, should I listen to the person from earlier and bow to you?”

“No, no. How dare I? Sword Emperor, this is a misunderstanding,” Emperor God Xie Xin shook his head and took out a Qian Kun ring, “Sword Emperor, I crossed the line this time. This Qian Kun ring has all the resources that I have gathered all my life. Take this as an apology to you, Sword Emperor. I hope Sword Emperor doesn’t record a demerit. I will leave immediately and never step foot in Green Fire World ever again.”

“Leave now?” Jian Wushuang said coldly, “There’s no hurry. As we have met, I happen to have things to ask you, Emperor God Xie Xin. For example, how did you come to this battlefield? Besides you, who else knows about this battlefield?”

“This is simple. I can answer you right now,” Emperor God Xie Xin smiled faintly and looked as though he was more than happy to answer Jian Wushuang’s question. But in the next moment…

“Run!”

Swoosh!

Emperor God Xie Xin turned into a shrill black flowing light as he plunged to the vast battlefield behind.

Without hesitation and extremely decisively!!

He knew the surrounding battlefield clearly and also the value of Green Fire World.

As he had found out about the battlefield and Green Fire World, according to Sword Emperor’s bad name and his conduct, he absolutely wouldn’t let him leave alive.

Absolutely not!!!

Hence, he had to run!!

The experts from Green Fire World were dumbfounded at the sight.
