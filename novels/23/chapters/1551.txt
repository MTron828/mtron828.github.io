Chapter 1552: Barge In

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“I had some dealings with Blood Demon Church before. Although there are four Real Gods, besides Blood Demon Church Master who reached the second stage, the other three are just first stage Void Real Gods. With our line-up, we can easily suppress Blood Demon Church,” a bald elderly with a hunchback, Real God Yin Tuo, said.

“Even so, let’s not let our guards down,” Jian Wushuang glanced at everyone around him, “When we launch attack later, Real God Bai Ying, Real God Yin Tuo and Brother Fiery King, the three of you tear the Protective Array apart and barge into Blood Demon Church for a massacre. The bigger the movement, the better. Real God Long Qing and I will seize the time when Blood Demon Church is in chaos to head over to Ancient Demon Mountain to capture Lord Leng alive. We retreat once we have caught her.”

“OK,” Real God Long Qing nodded.

“You get the final say,” Real God Bai Ying and Real God Yin Tuo showed respect to Jian Wushuang too.

Only Fiery King creased his eyebrows, “Jian Wushuang, you want to head to Ancient Demon Mountain personally?”

He remembered Hall Master Yuan had exhorted for Jian Wushuang not to reveal himself.

“I am responsible for Lord Leng. If I don’t go personally, I can’t be at ease,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“If so, alright then. But, please be extremely careful,” Fiery King said.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

Very soon, the five of them arrived before the lair of Blood Demon Church.

“The three of you have to take action first,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Don’t worry about it.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Real God Bai Ying, Real God Yin Tuo and Fiery King immediately moved forward.

Jian Wushuang and Real God Long Qing hid behind.

Very quickly… Hong!!!

The terrifying roar was heard from the void in the front and boundless crimson god burst out. It tore an opening in the Protective Array of Blood Demon Church.

In the lair of Blood Demon Church, it instantly stirred a commotion.

“Who is it?”

A roar reverberated in the universe along with angry voices.

“Haha, giblets of Blood Demon Church, you exterminated the Fiery Family three million years ago and I, Fiery King, have come back to take revenge.

A laugh with tremendous momentum and a tinge of madness rang across the universe like thunder. Jian Wushuang could recognize Fiery King’s voice the moment he heard it.

As for whatever Fiery King had said about three million years, it was merely a random excuse that he had made up.

There were countless powers and tribes that Blood Demon Church had exterminated in Blood Demon World. They reckoned they themselves didn’t know if they had exterminated the Fiery Family. Naturally, they thought Fiery King was simply there to take revenge.

Hong!

In Blood Demon Church, Real God Bai Ying, Real God Yin Tuo and Fiery King spread their ferocious aura.

Especially Real God Bai Ying and Real God Yin Tuo, as they were two Eternal Real Gods. Three experts barging in and the experts in Blood Demon Church felt as though it was the end of the world.

The team immediately exploded and all the Real Gods launched attacks wantonly. The Universe Gods had no room to interfere.

Blood Demon Church was naturally in utter confusion and chaos.

At that very moment, Jian Wushuang, who was waiting near the lair of Blood Demon Church, squinted his eyes.

“Real God Long Qing, let’s move,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Mm, let me rein in my aura. The few Real Gods in Blood Demon Church were flustered at the sudden attack by Real God Bai Ying and the others. I think they won’t have the time to probe carefully, so they shouldn’t be able to notice me,” Real God Long Qing said.

“That’s great, let’s go.”

Jian Wushuang and Universe God Long Qing immediately turned into flowing light and passed through the opening of Blood Demon Church’s Protective Array to enter into Blood Demon Church.

Then, Jian Wushuang took out the route map that Elder Xue Yang had drawn earlier and he plunged in the direction where Ancient Demon Mountain was located.

Although they had met many cultivators of Blood Demon Church on the way, the Universe Gods in Blood Demon Church were fleeing in a panic, helter-skelter. They didn’t even bother to look at Jian Wushuang and Real God Long Qing. Even when they saw them, they would only treat them as people in Blood Demon Church.

As for the Real Gods in Blood Demon Church who were fighting in the void, they were even more unlikely to notice them.

Jian Wushuang and Real God Long Qing entered the depth of Blood Demon Church without hindrance.

“Ancient Demon Mountain, it’s there.”

Jian Wushuang lifted his head and looked up at the ancient lofty peak at the end of his field of vision.

That peak was Ancient Demon Mountain, also where Lord Leng stayed.

Jian Wushuang and Real God Long Qing were approaching Ancient Demon Mountain at a terrifying speed.

In the black palace on Ancient Demon Mountain.

“Leng, this is the Seven Star Moon Warbler Lotus. I’ve put in a great effort and finally got it,” a stony-faced young man in a luxurious purple long robe flashed an enchanting smile while sitting before Lord Leng. He was holding the Seven Star Moon Warbler Lotus in his hand.

Looking at the Seven Star Moon Warbler Lotus, Lord Leng’s eyes glistened and smiled, “Thank you, Your Highness Mu Hong.”

“Don’t mention it,” the stony-faced man, His Highness Mu Hong looked at Lord Leng with passion in his eyes, “Leng, I am quite free recently and I’d like to keep you company in Blood Demon Church. I wonder if it’s okay.”

“Your Highness Mu Hong, you must be joking. With your background, you can go wherever you like. If you were to want to stay in Blood Demon Church, would there be anyone who would chase you away? Blood Demon Church Master doesn’t have the guts to.” Lord Leng smiled and replied.

“Haha, so you agree,” His Highness Mu Hong immediately beamed with joy.

Just then, hong!

A vigorous roar was heard from afar and the few people in the black palace were frightened.

“What happened?” His Highness Mu Hong’s face changed slightly.

“It’s Blood Demon Church. There were three Real Gods that barged in. They seem to be there to take revenge and they are fighting the Blood Demon Church Master now,” a chubby red-haired middle-aged man behind His Highness Mu Hong replied.

“Is that so?” His Highness Mu Hong nodded.

Blood Demon Church worked for them and had made so many enemies. When the enemies had no power, they naturally could only hold back. Whenever they grew stronger, they would return to take revenge. It was very normal.

“His Highness, Blood Demon Church Master sent a message and said that the enemy is too strong. They couldn’t stand it any longer, they’d like to ask Your Highness for help,” the chubby, middle-aged man said.

“Humph, I just got here, I have no time to bother with this affair. Tell him to figure it out himself and that he has to take care of it soon. If it were to interrupt Leng and I, I’d kill him,” His Highness Mu Hong sounded cold.

“Let me tell him now,” the chubby middle-aged man was going to reply.

“Something’s wrong,” the old lady in a black robe behind Lord Leng said in a hoarse voice.
