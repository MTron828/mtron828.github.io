Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“What is it?”

Nine Whiskers looked at the vast ocean of golden sword intent in front of him in shock.

This ocean of golden sword intent was endless and had an indescribable power. Moreover, this ocean of sword intent was obviously perfectly integrated with the golden formation around it.

Hualala! The enormous golden sea churned, and endless waves of golden sword intent surged toward Nine Whiskers one after another.

Nine Whiskers did not have time to be shocked, and he could only hurriedly use a method to block the attack of this golden sword intent. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

!!

However, just one wave of golden sword intent was enough to shock Nine Whiskers.

“At the fifth level, the power contained in this wave of golden sword intent is absolutely not inferior to the full-force attack of a Ruler at the fifth level. Even I have to go all out and use my ultimate move to block it!”

If it was just one or two golden sword essence waves, Nine Whiskers would not care. But the key point was that under the golden sea of sword essence, the mighty golden sword essence waves followed one after another, they surged toward him in an earth-shaking manner.

In just a moment, he was hit by more than ten waves of golden sword essence.

Under such an impact, he had to use his full strength to block it. However, using his ultimate move more than ten times in a row consumed a lot of his divine power.

In addition, Nine Whiskers had been severely injured by Jian Wushuang in the hazy sword formation and had lost nearly half of his divine power. Now, he was trapped in the wave light sword formation and suppressed by the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation, Nine Whiskers was completely terrified by the waves of golden sword essence.

“It’s endless. The waves of sword essence are endless. Even if I’m at the peak of my strength, I can barely hold on for a while in this sword formation, not to mention that I’m severely injured.”

“Run, run!”

Nine Whiskers did not want to kill Jian Wushuang anymore. He was completely terrified and just wanted to escape.

Although he had encountered several crises over the years, he was able to turn defeat into victory with his skills. But now, facing Jian Wushuang, there was nothing he could do.

He could only run.

However, he was now trapped in the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation.

With Jian Wushuang’s current strength, the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation activated by the three Heaven Suppression Tablets was so powerful that it directly suppressed the galaxy. Even though Nine Whiskers was the Ultimate Ruler of the fourth level, his battle strength was comparable to that of the fifth level, however, it was not so easy for him to escape the suppression of the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation.

“No, no!”

Nine Whiskers cried out in alarm. He wanted to escape, and he had even used his life-saving secret art.

However, facing the golden sea of sword intent that was crazily sweeping over him, he did not have any space or opportunity to escape. He could only watch as his divine power was constantly being consumed, and the aura on his body was constantly weakening.

“It’s over!”

Nine Whiskers was in despair. He was even wailing in his heart.

He was unwilling to die, let alone at the hands of a second-level Ruler.

However, no matter how unwilling he was, the gap between his strength and Jian Wushuang’s was still there.

Before Jian Wushuang had used the three sword formations, Nine Whiskers could have fought Jian Wushuang equally. However, once Jian Wushuang used the three sword formations, Nine Whiskers was no longer Jian Wushuang’s opponent.

In fact, if Nine Whiskers had not been too greedy and did not want to kill Jian Wushuang, Jian Wushuang would have spared his life. It was a pity that Nine Whiskers had sought his own death.

He thought that his most powerful killing move, even the fifth-level Ruler, would be dead for sure. It should be easy for him to kill Jian Wushuang, a second-level Ruler. However, Jian Wushuang survived.

Buzz!

Another wave of golden sword essence rushed toward him. Nine Whiskers’s divine body could not hold on any longer and collapsed. His life was instantly cut off.

After Nine Whiskers died, his long spear, armor, and treasures that had merged with his body floated in the void, leaving behind his interspatial ring.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and took all the treasures.

Then Jian Wushuang put away the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation and the three Heaven Suppression Tablets into his interspatial ring.

After doing all this, Jian Wushuang looked at the Void to the side.

In that direction, Ruler Mo Chen from the Nihility Star had been standing there watching the battle. However, as the battle progressed to the final stage, Nine Whiskers fell into the wave light sword formation and made his final struggle, naturally, Ruler Mo Chen had also seen it.

Ruler Mo Chen had never expected that even Nine Whiskers was no match for Jian Wushuang. Moreover, it seemed that he was about to die at Jian Wushuang’s hands.

After all, Nine Whiskers was invited by him to avenge his two brothers. Now that Nine Whiskers was about to die, how could he dare to stay any longer?

Therefore, while Nine Whiskers was still struggling, Ruler Mo Chen had already sneaked away.

It could not be helped. He was not on the battlefield. When Jian Wushuang activated the Divine Devil Heaven Suppression Formation, it did not cover him. Jian Wushuang was so focused on Nine Whiskers that he did not have time to pay attention to him, so he let him escape.

“Humph, he’s lucky.”

Jian Wushuang snorted and waved his sleeve. He turned around and walked into the universe boat.

…

In the galaxy not far from the battlefield, Ruler Mo Chen turned into a stream of light and sped through the galaxy.

He did not dare to stop for a moment, afraid that the Ruler of the universe boat would chase after him after he killed Nine Whiskers.

His eyes were filled with unprecedented shock.

“Even Mr. Nine Whiskers is no match for the Ruler of the universe boat? And it seems that he is going to die soon!”

The shock in Ruler Mo Chen’s heart could not be any more intense.

One had to know that when he went to invite Nine Whiskers, he had absolute confidence in the latter.

The latter’s power was so strong that it made him feel despair. However, he had not expected that even such a supreme being would be killed by that universe boat Ruler.

“Even Mr. Nine Whiskers was killed by him. In this Purple Micro Galaxy, there really isn’t anyone else who can threaten that universe boat Ruler. If I want to take revenge for my two brothers, I’m afraid it will be impossible.” Ruler Mo Chen sighed heavily.

He wanted to take revenge, but the other party was too strong.

He was so strong that he despaired. Most importantly, the other party showed his talent and potential.

After all, the other party was only a second-level Ruler. If a second-level Ruler could kill Nine Whiskers, who had a fifth-level Ruler, it would be amazing in the future.

It could be said that Jian Wushuang’s strength and talent made him lose the desire to take revenge.
