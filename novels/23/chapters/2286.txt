Chapter 2287 Awaken Part 2

Ever since the first era, countless experts had ventured into the Ancient Mystery Land.Over time, most of the opportunities and treasures had been found.

After the ancient battlefield around the Green Fire World was found, most of the experts chose to go there to explore. The Ancient Mystery Land had started to become quiet.

At a humble corner within the Ancient Mystery Land was a barren hill.

This hill was extremely large. However, there was no life on this hill at all. It was a completely barren hill.

Over the years, many experts had passed it, but they had never noticed it. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Even though there were some who had noticed it stayed and searched the place, nothing was ever found.

It was a completely normal, barren hill.

That is, until Xuan Yi’s voice was heard there through the restrictive formation. The barren hill started to change.

Large amounts of rocks collapsed rapidly. It was as though the barren hill was stripped of its outer clothes before it’s true features were seen.

It was not a hill, it was a human!

A giant who was incredibly big.

The giant sat there cross-legged. The hill had been formed because he had not moved for trillions of years.

At the next instant, the giant opened his eyes. His irises radiated fierceness, just like those of a savage beast.

He then stood up and used his hands to tear the air above him. Under his force, Heaven and Earth was torn apart as a giant Space Tunnel big enough to fit him inside appeared.

The giant entered the space tunnel without any hesitation.

...

Eighth Lair!

At the bottom of a river found within the Dark Region, there was a hidden stand-alone space.

The giant Crystal Palace stood quietly above the back of Long Qi. A giant coffin floated at the centre of the Crystal Palace.

A man lay peacefully within the coffin.

This man with black hair was over five meters tall. He wore a long golden cloak.

He had a gentle look. He was so handsome that he seemed bewitching.

“People of the Seven Star Black Sect, awaken!”

Xuan Yi’s majestic voice was heard.

At that instant, the handsome man sleeping peacefully within the coffin opened his eyes.

He had deep, shiny eyes. They looked like sparkling gems.

Crack~~ Crack~~

Cracks started to form on his coffin before it finally crumbled.

The beautiful man landed on the ground softly.

Whoosh!

A figure appeared so fast he seemed to have teleported. He appeared beside the handsome man. This figure was a strange old man who had a long, golden tail.

This old man was Long Qi.

At this moment, his eyes were burning with excitement and fanaticism as he looked at the beautiful man with black hair.

“Master, you are finally awake!” Long Qi said, trembling.

“Yes.” The handsome man with black hair nodded his head before he commanded, “Long Qi, follow me.”

The handsome man waved as a gigantic space tunnel appeared. The handsome man and Long Qi disappeared into the tunnel.

Similar events were happening throughout the Eternal Chaotic World, one after another.

Heaven’s Horizon, in front of the passageway and the Reincarnation Passage. Xuan Yi stood there calmly, holding two souls in his hands.

Even when he was standing against three Masters of the Holy Land, Xuan Yi was calm and composed. He seemed absolutely confident.

The three Masters of the Holy land knitted their eyebrows tightly.

They knew that Xuan Yi has always been unpredictable. He had been this way back when he was alive, and even as a consciousness incarnation after death.

Right when everyone was wondering what would happen...

Boom!!!

A giant crack appeared in Heaven and Earth. A crimson figure stepped out from within the crack.

He wore crimson red armour, helmet and boots. Even his skin was crimson red.

The moment he appeared, an unprecedented wave of scorching heat swept out in all directions and shrouded the entire battlefield.

All experts present felt as though they were in the middle of a sea of fire. It was not any ordinary sea of fire.

To them, the three-meter-tall man in crimson armor was not a cultivator, but a flame that could burn everything in this world.

When he appeared, he drew the attention of every single expert there.

“That man...”

Bing Shan, who was standing behind the Masters of the Holy Land, was shocked.

“It’s him! One of the Seven Stars of the Seven Star Black Sect, Fire God Zhu Yuan!” Bing Shan roared in a low voice.

“One of the Seven Stars?” The three Masters of the Holy Land frowned.

When the Seven Star Black Sect had been around, the Seven Stars had been seven top-tier experts who were all extremely well known throughout the Absolute Beginning Divine World.

The most powerful of them all was Emperor Thirteen, who could go even against Masters of the Holy Land.

Even though the other six were not as powerful as Emperor Thirteen, they were of similar power levels.

In this Heaven and Earth, under the powerful Restrictions of Heaven and Earth, an expert with the fighting power of that of one of the Seven Stars was still a threat to the Three Masters of the Holy Land.

To make matters worse, the appearance of Fire God Zhu Yuan was only the beginning.

The space was soon torn apart again. A giant who was hundreds of feet tall walked out of the torn spacetime.

This giant was extremely fierce, just like a savage beast.

“Xiong Jue, one of the Seven Stars!” Bing Shan cried out once again.

The space was repeatedly torn apart and figures walked out of their own space tunnels.

Within moments, eight people appeared on the battlefield.

These eight people each radiated an overbearing aura.

“Oh my! Out of the most well-known Seven Stars from the Seven Star Black Sect, three of them have appeared. Including the most powerful Emperor Thirteen, a total of four of them are gathering here?”

“The remaining five are Divine Punisher Elders from the Seven Star Black Sect!”

Many of the experts from the ancient past trembled in fear.

Even the three Masters of the Holy Land looked grim.

They know exactly how powerful the Seven Stars from the Seven Star Black Sect were. They were only inferior to an expert in the realm of Master of the Holy Land.

As for Divine Punisher Elders... Back in its prime, the Seven Star Black Sect had had a Divine Punishment Palace.

Within the Divine Punishment Palace, there had been a total of ten Divine Punishment Elders. All of these Divine Punishment Elders were top tier experts. Even though they were weaker than the Seven Stars, their fighting power was not too far off. One Star Man was one of the Divine Punishment Elders.

During the Battle of the Ancient Past, no matter if it was the Seven Stars or these Divine Punishment Elders, they were the most powerful people from the Seven Star Black Sect.

Now, eight of the most powerful people from the Seven Star Black Sect had gathered!
