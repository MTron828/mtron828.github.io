Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Buzz!!!

All of a sudden, a frightening saber light appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. Originally, this saber light was unleashed by that Sir God himself. However, with the amplification by the Killing Formation, its power rose by close to ten times.

Jian Wushuang raised the Blood Mountain Sword in his hands, rumble~~~ A total of sixty-one crimson sword shadows was formed and they superimposed onto one another instantly and formed a new sword shadow.

After that, the sword shadow was swung out and it clashed with the saber light head-on.

In the end… bam!

With a loud sound, the crimson sword shadow was dissipated almost instantly and the saber light, which still contained a considerable amount of power, continued to head toward Jian Wushuang.

Upon seeing that, Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned grave.

The huge body of the King of Venomous Worms, who was below him, rolled up fiercely and countless tentacles appeared crazily.

The saber light swept past everything and cut open thousands of tentacles of the King of Venomous Worms in one go. A considerable amount of power also struck the body of the King of Venomous Worms, which was filled with dark red scales, and this caused the King of Venomous Worms to feel extremely uncomfortable.

“It’s too strong!”

“This is the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts. If the people who deployed this formation were to use any attack, its power would rise by close to ten times after the amplification by the Killing Formation. Unless we are able to destroy this Killing Formation forcefully, no matter how many techniques we have, we will definitely die!”

“Jian Wushuang, think of a way quickly.”

The King of Venomous Worms’ voice was filled with impatience.

Jian Wushuang’s expression was ice-cold and he was looking at the five Sir Gods outside the Killing Formation. Among the five Sir Gods, the cold man who was holding a big hammer was about to attack.

“I have to give it my all,” Jian Wushuang chenched both his fists tightly and his eyes were glowing with determination.

On his dark golden Ancient God body, there were six stars in the space between his eyebrows. However, at that time, Jian Wushuang slapped his own forehead fiercely.

Slap!

All of a sudden, the Quadrangular Star at the highest point was broken into pieces.

“Ancient God’s Secret Skill… Star Destruction Skill!”

This was a Secret Skill which would allow one’s abilities to rise greatly for a short period of time by destroying one’s own Ancient God Star.

It was a Secret Skill that only Ancient Gods possessed.

With one Ancient God Star destroyed, the Ancient God Power in Jian Wushuang’s body skyrocketed in an instant and even the King of Venomous Worms below him underwent a slight change at that moment.

Rumble~~~

Within the Killing Formation, the second attack had already appeared.

It was an ancient, big hammer. The big hammer had repelled the universe and it contained power which could destroy the world.

Upon seeing that, Jian Wushuang’s eyes glowed with a dark golden light and an infinite amount of Divine Power gathered on his right hand’s index finger instantly.

“Ancient God’s Sixth Finger, Sun Corrosion!”

Boom!

A dark golden, giant finger pierced the space forcefully and clashed with the ancient, big hammer with lightning speed. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

A violent booming sound could be heard at once and the frightening power spread in all directions. However, the power was stopped by the crimson wall of the Killing Formation which acted as an obstacle.

Jian Wushuang only felt an impact spreading toward him which caused his body to stagger. After that, he retreated a few steps backward quickly.

“Even though my abilities rose greatly after I destroyed one Ancient God Star, I am still at a disadvantage?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned grave and he understood immediately.

Destroying only one star was totally not enough to have an impact on the Killing Formation at all.

“Hmph!”

Jian Wushuang gave a cold hum and his eyes became even more determined. His palm then slapped his own forehead again.

“Slap!””Slap!”

Two Ancient God Stars were destroyed at the same time.

In addition to the one star that he had destroyed previously, it was power from destroying three stars.

Rumble~~~ The Ancient God Power in Jian Wushuang’s body underwent a transformation in terms of quality immediately!

At that moment, his abilities rose greatly.

Straight after that, he took big steps forward. As he looked at the crimson palm that was forming within the Killing Formation, a vast amount of Ancient God Power burst forth.

“Break!”

With a furious cry, Jian Wushuang clenched his right fist and punched fiercely.

The crimson palm also changed into a crimson flittering light and attacked with lightning speed.

Bam!

The sound shook the heavens and the crimson flittering light dissipated. The crimson palm which contained power that had been amplified greatly with the help of the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts was actually torn apart right away.

“What?”

Outside the Killing Formation, all the five Sir Gods revealed shocked expressions.

They knew how powerful the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts was. Moreover, all five of them were Sir Gods who were extremely strong. Their own abilities were already very unreasonable and with the amplification of the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts, their attack power would increase by close to ten times.

Under such circumstances, the attacks that they had unleashed randomly should have achieved the limit of a Sir God and they should be very close to Emperor Gods. For such attacks, among the Sir Gods in the Eternal Chaotic World, there were not many of them who could repel them head-on.

However, Jian Wushuang had actually torn apart their attacks which had been amplified by the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts.

Those abilities… were much stronger than they had expected.

“This Jian Wushuang has probably not used the Secret Skill of Star Palace yet!”

“Damn it. He is a lot more difficult to deal with than the reports said.”

“Use the Devil Nine Cuts right away. Don’t give him any chances!”

The five Sir Gods made a decision immediately.

The five Sir Gods then took action at the same time straight away and a great amount of Divine Power could be seen entering the Killing Formation crazily.

Rumble~~~ The void also shook madly.

A vast amount of Divine Power gathered in the void of the Killing Formation. With the Divine Power gathering, a gigantic crimson god appeared in front of Jian Wushuang slowly.

The devil god was a thousand feet tall and it was not considered very big. However, the aura that it emitted was already past the level of a Sir God and it had achieved a completely new level. It was the level of… anEmperor God!

“It’s Devil Nine Cuts!”

“A Devil Nine Cuts created by five Sir God experts working together will achieve the level of an Emperor God!”

Upon seeing that, the King of Venomous Worms became extremely terrified.

Jian Wushuang’ expression was also extremely grave. He could feel a huge amount of pressure from the Devil Nine Cuts in front of him.

“King of Venomous Worms, please return to my body first,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Alright,” the King of Venomous Worms nodded his head.

If it were a Sir God-level intense battle, with the King of Venomous Worms already transformed into the Full-foot Plenilune, the King of Venomous Worms could indeed fight side by side with Jian Wushuang and hence be of great help to Jian Wushuang.

However, when the battle rose to the level of Emperor Gods, there would be no room for the King of Venomous Worms to step in.

What he could do was stay within Jian Wushuang’s body and do his best to help Jian Wushuang recover his Divine Power and body.

Within the Killing Formation, the extremely huge Plenilune giant beast started to shrink with shocking speed immediately. After a short amount of time, he became a small worm beast and entered Jian Wushuang’s body again.

The Killing Formation became spacious at once.

Jian Wushuang had an enormous amount of aura and his body expanded until he was a thousand feet tall. His body was glowing with dark golden light and only three Ancient God Stars remained in the space between his eyebrows. The light that the three Ancient God Stars emitted was unusually dazzling as well.

In front of Jian Wushuang was the thousand-foot-tall Devil Nine Cuts. The body of the Devil Nine Cuts was scarlet in color and it was as though a layer of armor had covered it. In addition, it possessed a tremendous amount of murderous intent.
