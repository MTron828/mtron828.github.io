Seeing that the other party was immersed and not exchanging greetings, he continued to walk forward.

The Soul Dao Secret Technique.

This technique could be considered a free gift to them, also regarded as the most powerful secret technique.

However, obtaining the complete technique would probably require going through some challenges.

After ascending 8,000 steps, Jian Wushuang found that he could see the scenery beyond the 800 steps.

9,000 steps meant he could see 900 steps.

So, 10,000 steps corresponded to 1,000 steps.

He was unsure whether this was related to the Soul Secret Technique or the realm of the soul.

9,999th step.

Here, seven Emperors were stationed.

These seven were all powerhouses from the Elder Palace, ranging from the tier 6 like Situ Nan to tier 5 peak-level Emperors.

From ancient times to the present, their realms might not be very high, but in terms of the soul, they were considerably stronger than the Inheritors like him.

It was just unclear why they had stopped here.

Although they were said to be stronger than the Inheritors, Jian Wushuang had only seen the shadow of one of the Inheritors, Wan Xing. Moreover, Wan Xing had been following closely behind him, not much weaker.

Their soul was indeed stronger than the Inheritors, but the speed of comprehending secret techniques was not as fast as that of the Inheritors.

This was an indisputable fact; otherwise, why would Zhen Ling bother nurturing them?

After digging through countless universes, they had selected these Inheritors. Among the Inheritors who entered this place, even the weakest, Wan Xing, could rank in the top 1,000 among Inheritors.

Stronger than some Ultimate existences.

Not all beings mastering the Ultimate Dao would become transcendent Dao Lords or Emperors.

Some Inheritors who grasped the Ultimate Dao were currently not even Dao Lords, stuck at the fifth or sixth level, unable to advance.

Also, it was the first group of Ultimate existences that, after accumulating cultivation for a long time and encountering the Qishen Temple, erupted into Dao Lords. Subsequently, they began seeking breakthroughs.

However, even among this group, very few could perfect the Ultimate Dao after such a long time of cultivation. Currently, it seemed that only Hu Qing had successfully merged with the Dao in a perfected manner.

Jian Wushuang was among the first group of people to master the Dao Ultimate, reaching the eighth level‚Äîa member of the initial cohort.

The Extreme Dao had no bottlenecks for him. Once he mastered the realm of black holes, he could rapidly reach perfection in his cultivation.

His merging with the Dao was also progressing quickly.

However, he had not made any preparations for merging with the Dao.

This time, he wanted to see if he could gain some benefits from this place.

Preparations for merging with the Dao.

When Hu Qing merged with the Dao, he watched, and there were so many treasures, not to mention the power contained in the eye-shaped spiritual spring.

Probably, not even all the godstoness in a million trillion regions in Tiannan could produce such an effect.

This wasn't a single stone but a whole region.

Even if he emptied the entire southern region, he couldn't get as many godstoness as what was contained in that one glance of the spiritual spring, not to mention the numerous other treasures he couldn't see.

The most crucial thing was the location; the place had a profound and abundant aura, probably a dwelling place of a Universe Master.

He wasn't fortunate enough to enjoy such a place with the right timing, location, and people.

Originally, he thought that even the Zhen Ling might favor him, but due to the incident with Kui Organization, not being expelled was already considered good enough. He didn't dare to ask for more.

Upon reaching the 9,999th step, Jian Wushuang finally understood why so many powerful beings were trapped here.

This place was indeed extraordinary.

The secret technique of the soul wasn't difficult; he comprehended it in a month. However, the subsequent chess game puzzled him.

In the Origin Source space.

A phantom figure appeared.

This person had blood-red skin, disheveled hair, and wore a black robe embroidered with golden runes. A bit overweight and untidy, with eyes like copper bells.

This reminded Jian Wushuang of the Yama in the mortal world.

Ordinary people would be truly startled at the sight.

"Hehe, little guy, play another round with me!"

The entire space transformed into a chessboard, and the two faced each other from a distance.

Chess of war!

Jian Wushuang pondered for a moment, first paying his respects, then starting to contemplate.

He understood the rules of the chess game through the opponent's description, but the tactics were a different matter.

In war chess, there were no conventional chess pieces.

All the pieces were condensed in space.

Jian Wushuang imitated the person opposite him and condensed a chess piece, a piece of the Wood Dao.

Wood Dao, the Spirit of Heaven and Earth!

The root of the Five Elements.

He had set up a good scenario, but the problem was where to place it.

Fortunately, he possessed the Extreme Dao and knew where to use the Wood Dao origin.

Water!

Water nourishes Wood!

Jian Wushuang made his move, placing the Wood Dao chess piece at the boundary of the chessboard, where there was a natural river.

The old Yama's eyes lit up, expressing delight, "Little guy, interesting!"

The chess piece he had just condensed was held in his hand the entire time, and Jian Wushuang had no idea what kind of chess piece it was.

Snap!

A Light Dao chess piece!

It landed in the darkest corner of the chessboard, which was originally Jian Wushuang's territory, instantly illuminating half of the chessboard.

Jian Wushuang also tried to imitate, but he found that each time the opponent countered.

After some contemplation, Jian Wushuang grasped the void, and two chess pieces appeared in his hand. He placed a Thunder Dao Origin Source first, placing it at the edge of the opponent's Light Dao chess piece. Instantly, lightning flickered, and the sky darkened a bit.

"Hmm?"

The old Yama, was somewhat surprised, momentarily uncertain.

After thinking for a while, he reached into the Origin Source space and condensed a chess piece.

Yang Dao Origin Source.

Combining Light Dao with Yang Dao, a hot star was formed.

"You can do it like this?" Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Could it be played like this?

Encircling this point, Jian Wushuang embarked on a lengthy path of decryption.

Cultivating Thunder Dao to generate an electric world.

While the opponent increased the stakes, he also continuously invested.

Dark Dao, Thunder Dao, Electric Dao, Rain Dao, Wind Dao.

Finally, he condensed Destruction Dao, and its further evolution led to a black hole.

Jian Wushuang's path broadened.

No matter how vast the Light Dao was, where else could it go?

Jian Wushuang revealed a pleased expression.

He was about to win.

However, at this moment, Yama revealed a slight smile. He found the little guy in front of him very interesting and had no intention of going easy on him.

He won m ost of the other people who had come before at this point.

But Jian Wushuang was unaware.

Crack!

A move was made.

Around the scorching stellar pavilion, nine large planets began to orbit, forming a river.

"What is this?"

Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded.

He hadn't even figured out black holes, and the other party had crossed the universe, directly opening up a river of time and space.

How was he supposed to play now?

He never expected to end up like this and began to doubt himself.

Others could pass through, so why couldn't he? ƒêiscover nùíÜw chaptùíÜrs ùíên n0ùíóe(l)biùíè(.)com

"I lost!" Jian Wushuang shook his head, somewhat despondent.

The old man, Yama, was very happy and said with a faint smile, "Little guy, don't be in a hurry. Let's continue."

In this space, Jian Wushuang was trapped by the opponent for who knows how many years before finally breaking free.

From the first round's black hole to later devouring the universe with a black hole, it truly allowed him to understand the complex structure of the universe.

However, winning against the universe was not easy, but later on, Jian Wushuang took a broader approach.

He no longer focused on individual cities or lands but drew a line first, opening up myriad realms with that line, sketching a starry sky. Only then could he be considered to have defeated the opponent head-on.
