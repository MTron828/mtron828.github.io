Chapter 2778: Blood Thunder King’s Glee

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“It’s Blood Thunder King and his faction’s experts, there are also some people who are...from the Sword Alliance!”

“Sword Alliance?”

“When did Blood Thunder King get together with the Sword Alliance?”

The experts fighting from the two major factions were deeply surprised.

Yun Shan and Yin Su’er noticed the arrival of Jian Wushuang and the others and were puzzled.

Especially Yin Su’er, she gave a deep look at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang, Blood Thunder King, and the others who suddenly arrived on the battlefield from the void nearby began attacking and killing the experts from Yun Shan’s faction.

“Sh*t!”

“Damn it!”

“Blood Thunder King!”

The Grand Ultimate Gods in Yun Shan’s camp were frightened.

They were already at an absolute disadvantage, on the verge of defeat, and had been fighting hard all the time.

Blood Thunder King and the Sword Alliance joining in the attack and targeting them all of a sudden did not do them any good. How were they going to resist the fierce attack?

“Haha, go to hell!”

Blood Thunder King’s eyes turned scarlet as he stared at a High-level Grand Ultimate God in Yun Shan’s camp and immediately displayed his masterstroke.

The 15 Grand Ultimate Gods under Blood Thunder King’s command including those from the Sword Alliance and their four corpse puppets did not hold back as all of them attacked and killed mercilessly.

The miserable Grand Ultimate Gods in Yun Shan’s camp received a devastating blow.

Almost all of the Grand Ultimate Gods were killed in an instant. In the end, only four of them managed to escape from the waves of attacks and fled to the distant void in distress.

Among the four who survived by luck were Yun Shan and three other High-level Grand Ultimate Gods!

There were more than a dozen Grand Ultimate Gods in Yun Shan’s camp when Yun Shan and Yin Su’er faced off against each other, but only four of them survived. The four who survived were seriously injured and unable to recover their combat power to its peak in a short period.

Yun Shan’s faction was defeated with no chance of making a comeback.

“Blood Thunder King!”

Yun Shan’s infuriated voice echoed in the sky with his eyes seeming to be discharging flames of fury as he stared at Blood Thunder King.

Blood Thunder King laughed. “Haha, Yun Shan. Are you surprised? You and Yin Su’er have been fighting all these years over the full control of Crimson Stone Fort, but both of you have never considered me as equal from the beginning to the end. I bet you didn’t expect me to win this hand?”

Yun Shan’s complexion sank and turned to look at Jian Wushuang. “Sword Alliance... You colluded with the Sword Alliance!”

“Collusion? Yun Shan, don’t you think that’s a bit harsh. There’s no enmity between Crimson Stone Fort and the Sword Alliance, so I only asked Alliance Master Su Han to come forward and do me a little favor. Why do you think it’s a collusion?” Blood Thunder King laughed mockingly before instantly setting his gaze on Yin Su’er and the others. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Yun Shan’s faction is now crippled. We don’t need to care too much about them. Although Yin Su’er’s faction still possessed certain combat power, they are a far cry from their peak state. Alliance Master Su Han, we are much stronger than Yin Su’er’s faction once we joined hands. We’ll win this battle.”

Blood Thunder King wore an absolute confidence look on his face and was pleased.

Even though Yun Shan’s faction suffered the most in the recent war, Yin Suer’s faction was not spared either as several of their Grand Ultimate Gods had fallen.

As for the Grand Ultimate Gods who survived, they suffered a certain degree of injuries. The combined combat power of Blood Thunder King and the Sword Alliance was superior to that of Yin Su’er’s faction under such circumstances.

The experts in Yin Su’er’s camp pulled a long face after hearing Blood Thunder King’s claim.

The appearance of Blood Thunder King and the Sword Alliance joined hands after their fierce fight with Yun Shan’s faction was giving them a lot of pressure.

Of course, that was also because they knew nothing about what was going on.

Yin Su’er and Palace Keeper Si Zhen remained calm as they knew the truth.

“Blood Thunder King, don’t you think it’s too early to be this happy? We haven’t even fought yet, how do you foresee the result?” Yin Suer jeered coldly.

Blood Thunder King smiled. “Haha, matters have gotten up to this stage, Yin Su’er. Why are you still struggling? I’ll fulfill your wish if you don’t want to admit defeat yet. Alliance Master Su Han, I heard your domain oppression methods are very sophisticated and played a big role during the Sword Alliance’s fight with the Divine Demon Sect. Will I be fortunate enough to see that today?”

“Of course you are.” Jian Wushuang smiled as he spoke to Blood Thunder King as though they had been friends for many years.

An ancient bronze mirror emerged from Jian Wushuang’s body after that and a large expanse of golden light dispersed from the ancient bronze mirror—filling the entire battlefield and even the entire void.

In addition, a large amount of golden divine power had begun to condense crazily behind him.

Buzz... A large amount of golden divine power condensed. In the blink of an eye, a 10,000-foot-tall Golden Emperor appeared behind Jian Wushuang.

The Golden Emperor looked majestic while overlooking the world.

As soon as the Golden Emperor took shape, Jian Wushuang pointed a single finger and a vast golden divine ocean power rushed out frantically.

Soon, a huge Golden Prison took shape that covered the entire battlefield—shrouding all the experts on the battlefield.

In addition, a layer of dark golden armor formed on the surface of Jian Wushuang’s body.

The dark golden armor was Nine Sparkle Star Armor’s Precious Armor.

The vast Star Armor Domain emerged.

Next, sword intent started rising to the sky as Jian Wushuang’s 100,000 miles Perfect Sword World was displayed.

Golden Light Domain, Prison of Punishment, Star Armor Domain, Sword World... Four oppression methods were displayed at the same time.

At that instance, many experts on the battlefield could already feel Jian Wushuang’s various oppression methods displayed. Although Jian Wushuang had not fully put his domain oppressions methods to use, those Grand Ultimate Gods could already feel its greatness.

Jian Wushuang began to secretly send messages while those four oppression domains were forming.

“Jue Xin, An Ying...”

Jian Wushuang sent messages to several Grand Ultimate Gods under his command. “I’ll do my best to oppress the domain later. When the time comes, you shall do this...”

Jian Wushuang quickly explained his plans in the messages.

After receiving a message from Jian Wushuang and knowing Jian Wushuang’s real intentions, Jue Xin, An Ying, and Lan Junzhu were surprised.
