5074 Twenty Quasi-Grand Yan Immortals
Jian Wushuang’s brows furrowed slightly; this aura, it felt both unfamiliar and familiar at the same time.

He realized that there was no avoiding it anymore.

Accompanied by the tremors in the void, the once silent emptiness began to shift and change colors.

A mist, which seemed to appear out of nowhere, billowed up, obscuring everything.

“Again?” Nan Xuan said with solemnity.

The mist billowed, and a majestic aura filled the air.

“Do you truly believe you can act as you wish in Great Mi Heaven?” A voice, filled with unparalleled authority, resonated through the empty space like a tolling bell.

However, a figure that Jian Wushuang was all too familiar with suddenly appeared.

“Prince Jiu?”

“Jian Wushuang!”

In the nearly twenty thousand years since they had last met, Prince Jiu’s demeanor had undergone a drastic transformation.

Now, he exuded an intimidating presence, an intangible but palpable aura of supreme authority that filled the entire space. His ink-gold battle armor made him look like an emperor emerging from a sea of corpses.

Golden rays emanated from his True Eyes, captivating all who looked upon them.

And behind Prince Jiu, 20 figures clad in black robes stood in formation, as imposing as mountains and as terrifying as can be.

Deathly silence filled the air.

Their eyes met. Jian Wushuang looked calm, while Prince looked angry. Veins were popping out of his hand that was gripping the hilt of the sword at his waist.

He said angrily, “Jian Wushuang, you’ve humiliated me time and time again. Do you truly think you can escape punishment?”

A thunderous sound reverberated through the void.

Following that, Jian Wushuang said, “I have no intention of being your enemy. This time, I came to the Great Mi Heaven only to find a friend. It’s just that my journey didn’t go smoothly, and I had to remove some obstructive Yan Immortals along the way.”

“Do you realize that the Yan Immortals you removed were all under my command?”

Prince Jiu took a step forward, and his supreme authority bore down directly.

Nan Xuan’s expression changed slightly, and the Yan power within his body began to boil.

Only Jian Wushuang remained indifferent, completely disregarding his authority and aura. “I just said that I cleared some obstructive Yan Immortals, not because they were Great Mi Heaven’s Yan Immortals that I acted.”

The prince’s tightly furrowed brow eased slightly. “Even if it wasn’t intentional, I will never let go of the massacre of so many subordinate Yan Immortals!”

Jian Wushuang’s gaze sharpened, and a formidable divine pattern quietly surged around him. It was a plain but impossible-to-ignore pressure, rising from the bottom to counter Prince Jiu’s authority and displaying resistance.

Faced with this sudden and even more imposing pressure, Prince Jiu took half a step back, his expression uncertain.

There was unconcealed astonishment in his eyes. It had only been a few tens of thousands of years, but Jian Wushuang’s presence had surpassed what it used to be.

But soon, he regained his composure and said, “Jian Wushuang, old accounts and new accounts, we’ll settle them today!”

After his words, the prince swiftly drew the longsword hanging at his waist, and the sword’s tip, emitting a green light, pointed straight ahead.

In the next moment, the 20 figures in black robes behind him all moved, and the surging Yan power reached its peak.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang looked at Nan Xuan and said, “If you leave now, there’s still time.”

“Don’t joke, Young Friend. I won’t leave you behind in this dangerous place,” Nan Xuan frowned. “It’s too perilous here. Let’s go together.”

He said calmly, “I won’t leave. He won’t let me go.”

Nan Xuan was puzzled. “Just because of him, a young chap who isn’t even a Grand Yan Immortal?”

Jian Wushuang wanted to tell Nan Xuan that this young chap, who wasn’t even a Grand Yan Immortal, was the Emperor’s second son, the prince beneath the Emperor supreme’s seat, and his strength ran much deeper than what he showed.

But he ultimately remained silent and instead took a step forward, placing himself in front of Nan Xuan.
“Jian Wushuang, do you think you can withstand the entire Great Mi Heaven?” Prince Jiu’s voice trembled, and the 20 figures in black robes behind him moved in unison.

The extremely surging Yan power was almost tangible, and a unique aura descended.

20 black robes represented 20 Yan Immortals, but these Yan Immortals were no ordinary ones; they had mastered their own Immortal Styles.

Once they mastered an Immortal technique, it meant they had found their own path, the path to ascend.

Quasi-Grand Yan Immortals!

20 Quasi-Grand Yan Immortals!

“I’m not trying to withstand the entire Great Mi Heaven, but the entire Great Mi Heaven is here to stop me!” Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows were as sharp as a sword, full of unyielding pride.

Pointing his long sword, Prince Jiu commanded, “Strike!”

Boom, boom, boom!

The clouds billowed, and the force erupted. Under the influence of the 20 Quasi-Grand Yan Immortals, the void began to shatter.

They had all mastered their own Immortal Styles, far surpassing ordinary Yan Immortals, and even Jian Wushuang felt the gravity of the situation.

An Invisible Sword wrapped in bright golden divine patterns quietly appeared.

Facing the 20 Quasi-Grand Yan Immortals, he directly released the Wushuang Sword Dao.

Wushaung Sword Dao, Star River Lake Sea Sword Intent, first move.

Star.

With this sword move, the void directly shattered, and thousands of starlight pillars ascended, devouring everything in sight like a raging dragon.

Nan Xuan, who had a long sword by his waist, also drew his sword without any hesitation.

A brilliant sun appeared behind him, and nine crimson-golden rays of sunshine followed the sword.

At that moment, the void was covered in the aura of crimson-gold.

The 20 Quasi-Grand Yan Immortals were like moths to a flame as they were engulfed.

A deafening roar, capable of tearing apart the planes of entire Heavenly Regions, finally erupted in the southwest direction of the Great Mi Heaven.

The range of this shockwave was too vast, even Prince Jiu couldn’t ignore it.

He hurriedly waved his hand to bring down endless authority, using it to suppress the turmoil.

As the Master of the entire Great Mi Heaven, it was connected to Prince Jiu’s fate energy, so he could suppress the chaos very quickly.

At the same time, the shock and fear in his eyes only grew.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

When had Jian Wushuang grown to such a level that he could single-handedly confront 20 Quasi-Grand Yan Immortals?

One had to know that there were a total of 20 Quasi-Grand Yan Immortals, enough to trample over any Super Heavenly Region!

But now, they seemed to be in dire straits?!

The resentment towards Jian Wushuang made Prince Jiu unable to endure any longer, and he directly shattered the void, slashing towards Jian Wushuang.

The void tore apart, and Lord Jiu, wearing ink-gold battle armor, broke through the brilliant golden radiance, his sword cutting through everything.

However, his long sword did not land on Jian Wushuang but was blocked by a slender and deep green True Sword.

“Hey, I say, let us leave, or else your Heavenly Region will be destroyed.” Nan Xuan held his swords with both hands, keeping Prince Jiu at bay, and said loudly.

“Get lost!” Prince Jiu almost went insane, raising his sword for a furious strike.

Stars burst forth, but Nan Xuan blocked them all.

“Ignorant!” He sneered, and with a shake of his deep green sword, he forced Prince Jiu back a hundred meters.

Blood surged within Prince Jiu, and he was so infuriated that he nearly spat out a mouthful of blood.

He could not understand why Jian Wushuang always had Grand Yan Immortals by his side.
