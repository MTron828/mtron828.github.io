A couple of Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals approached. Even though he could resist against one or two, if dozens of powerful beings came together, he couldn’t guarantee he could hold them off until they entered the large formation he had prepared in advance.

“Everyone, if you insist on fighting…” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered as he scanned the approaching crowd, his figure suddenly flashing.

Clang!

The long spear held by the Perfected Nine Revolutions pierced out violently!

A trail of afterimages followed Jian Wushuang as he mobilized his Yan power, the momentum of his spear no less than that of the Perfected Nine Revolutions  directly attacking the man with triangular eyes.

“Die!” Catch the leader first, and the rest will follow. As soon as he moved, Jian Wushuang locked onto the leader with triangular eyes.

The long spear pierced the air like a dragon. In that moment, Jian Wushuang appeared beside the man with triangular eyes.

Before the others could react, the long spear had pierced through the man’s chest. Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang appeared behind him, catching the blood-stained spear with one hand and smashing his fist towards the man’s head with the other.

Boom!

All of this happened in an instant. Before the others could comprehend what was occurring, the man with triangular eyes had already fallen.

Jian Wushuang held the blood-stained spear in one hand and the corpse of the man with triangular eyes in the other.

“A Six Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal has killed another Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, earning 1,000 points!” A message appeared in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

In addition to the basic points, Jian Wushuang also gained the accumulated points of the man with triangular eyes, which were more than 20,000. However, due to the higher-level kill, even the accumulated points were multiplied by ten.

“Over 200,000 points!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes widened in astonishment; his ranking had instantly shot up into the top 5,000.

This was terrifying beyond belief. He had thought only his basic achievements would double, never imagining that even his accumulated achievements would multiply.

If he killed a Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal with an accumulated record of 100,000 battles, he would gain tens of millions in achievements!

“Tsk!” Jian Wushuang had initially planned to kill their leader and leave, to avoid drawing attention. These Perfected Nine Revolutions were only worth 1,000 points each; it wasn’t worth the risk. Now, it seemed he had no choice but to kill them.

This exceeded his estimates!

What he didn’t know was that this was a special privilege unique to Six Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals, just not documented on their identity tokens.

“Go!” The other Perfected Nine Revolutions sensed the danger and scattered in all directions.

Jian Wushuang could kill their leader in an instant, and he could kill any one of them as well. Even if they ganged up on him, they would still suffer significant casualties.

The risk was too high; it was better to escape directly. As for seeking revenge?Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

That was practically impossible!

If it weren’t for the cunning of the man with triangular eyes, they wouldn’t have pledged allegiance to him in the first place.

It was a chance encounter, an alliance formed to engage in illicit activities. Now that the ship had sunk, they naturally abandoned it and fled in different directions.

Since these people scattered, Jian Wushuang had no way to pursue them. He could only deal with those who were relatively close to him.

Their achievements poured into his identity token with a clatter. Although the accumulated achievements of those few individuals were only a few thousand, multiplying it by ten meant tens of thousands.

Adding to the tally was the triangular-eyed man; this time, he had amassed a record of 350,000 points, placing him around the top 4.

The distance to the previous thousand was still quite significant.

Jian Wushuang pocketed his token, lowering his gaze to the Perfected Nine Revolutions sealed beneath him.

“After using your weapon, I’ll leave your corpse intact!” Jian Wushuang raised his hand, channeling a powerful Yan power into his opponent’s mind.

Silent in his killing; such was the might of Yan power.

“Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, Zhong Sheng, has been killed. You have gained a record of 150,000 points!” Seeing the displayed number, Jian Wushuang wasn’t particularly surprised.

He hadn’t exerted much effort in slaying this Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal; gaining 150,000 points was quite good considering.

After stowing away his precious spear, he could already sense several grand and majestic auras soaring toward the sky, rushing in his direction.

Although the commotion earlier hadn’t been significant, it had still attracted the attention of the strong in the surrounding area.

“Let’s go!” Jian Wushuang flickered, swiftly disappearing into the sky.

In just a few breaths, a Perfected Nine Revolutions arrived at the scene. He made no attempt to conceal his aura, his demeanor exuding dominance.

“Arrived late! Over a dozen Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals managed to escape; their strength is commendable, probably at the peak of Perfected Nine Revolutions level.” Behind the domineering man floated a crescent-shaped flying blade, emanating an incredibly powerful aura.

Even his precious weapon was of the utmost quality.

The power of a regular precious weapon generally sufficed for Yan Immortals up to the Nine Revolutions level, but most top-tier precious weapons were wielded by Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals. For individuals as formidable as the Perfected Nine Revolutions, ordinary precious weapons were simply insufficient.

Just like Jian Wushuang, his entire set of precious items was barely adequate during his Yan Immortal days. Once he ascended to the realm of Grand Yan Immortal and faced other Nine Revolutions, even Perfected Nine Revolutions, these precious items fell short.

Only transcendent innate treasures or those of a higher caliber could meet the current demand.

In ordinary circumstances, Grand Yan Immortals would, at most, employ pinnacle innate treasures. However, with the opening of the Qishen Temple and major powers unlocking their treasuries, even the Emperor bestowed upon the immensely powerful Perfected Nine Revolutions, born from the source, a transcendent innate treasure. This treasure was a crescent-shaped blade adorning his back.

Already at the peak of the Ninth Revolution, possessing this transcendent innate treasure elevated his strength to touch the threshold of supremacy. He could now rank among the top 1,000 on this primordial planet.

Now, facing a Perfected Nine Revolutions daring to hunt him within his territory, his brows furrowed, a cold glint in his eyes.

After a deafening explosion of air, he shot out, his form disappearing hundreds of thousands of miles in the blink of an eye.

Jian Wushuang hadn’t gone far yet. He wasn’t in a rush. He had come precisely to lure a Perfected Nine Revolutions. If he fled too fast, the other party wouldn’t be able to detect his aura.

After a few more flickers, Jian Wushuang felt a stir in his heart. “He took the bait!”

That overbearing aura permeated the entire mountain range. Though still quite distant, Jian Wushuang could feel it. The other party was heading straight for him.

“Oh no, he’s too fast!”

Jian Wushuang’s form suddenly accelerated, but it was already too late. The dominating aura, enveloping the entire mountain range, was right behind him.

For a moment, he felt a bit panicked. In a usual situation, he might not have been afraid of an ordinary Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal. But this pursuer, judging from his aura alone, was beyond the usual Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals he encountered.

“You can’t escape!”

The formidable man behind Jian Wushuang roared, his crescent-shaped blade instantly surging forth, slashing towards Jian Wushuang..
