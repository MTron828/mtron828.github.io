Chapter 3118: Purple Sky Pavilion

——

The Purple Sky Pavilion was the most elite and strongest force of all the forces controlled by the Sixth Prince.

Although the Purple Sky Pavilion only had about forty people, the weakest among them was a rank four True Saint, and there were quite a few Peak rank four True Saints. As for a rank five True Saint… Just in the Purple Sky Pavilion alone! There were four of them!

In addition to the Purple Sky Pavilion, there were three other rank five True Saints gathered here. In other words, there were seven experts at the rank five True Saint Realm under the command of the Sixth Prince.

Among them, Xing gang, the commander of the Purple Sky Pavilion, had reached the peak of rank five!

“No wonder the Sixth Prince was able to fight against the third prince for so long. It turns out that he has such a powerful force under his command.” Jian Wushuang was secretly amazed.

There were seven rank five True Saints, dozens of rank four True Saints, and more than 200 rank three True Saints!

Such a powerful force was enough to conquer a small country in the First Heaven.

Not long after the Sixth Prince gathered his power…a large number of experts suddenly spread their auras in the void in front of the mansion.

“They’re here!” The experts in the mansion raised their heads in unison.

A large number of black dots suddenly appeared in the void in the distance.

Those black dots were densely packed, and in the blink of an eye, they appeared in front of the mansion. Then, a large number of figures began to appear.

Buzz buzz buzz.

One after another, powerful auras spread out from these figures.

At this moment, there were already more than three hundred cultivators who had arrived, and all of them had extremely powerful auras. Even the weakest one was a rank three True Saint, and there was not even a cultivator below the rank three.

There were also quite a few rank four True Saints.

As for the rank five True Saints, there were actually a total of nine rank five True Saints spreading their auras from the crowd in front!

Nine rank five True Saints, along with a large number of fourth and rank three True Saints, more than 300 experts appeared in the air in front of the residence, instantly causing the experts under the Sixth Prince’s command to feel an enormous pressure.

“As expected, in terms of strength, the Third Prince’s strength is even stronger!”

Many people sighed in their hearts.

At the front of the crowd, the Third Prince, who was wearing a luxurious golden robe, had a cold expression on his face. He looked at the people in the residence through the layer of restrictions above the residence.

“Sixth Prince, as your elder brother, I personally came to see you. It’s fine if you didn’t come to see me, but why did you activate the array to shut us out?” The Third Prince’s magnificent voice spread throughout the world.

“Hmph, you came to see me? You came all the way here with all the experts under your command just to see me? Aren’t you afraid that others will laugh at you if you tell others?” The Sixth Prince snorted coldly.

“Haha, I do have a motive. However, if you think that the array around your mansion is enough to stop me, you are a little too naive.” The Third Prince sneered.

“I don’t want to hide in this mansion forever. Since you took the initiative to kill your way here today, then the two of us should really put an end to it.” The Sixth Prince said in a deep voice.

“Put an end to it? You didn’t have the guts to say this before. It seems that Ah Qing invited an expert from the sacred feather sect to give you enough confidence.” The Third Prince said in a cold voice.

“That’s right. Today, with Elder Zi Xing from the Holy Feather Sect and Lord Xin Zong Here, you can forget about stirring up any more trouble,” the Sixth Prince said in a low voice.

Elder Zi Xing and Xin Zong also took the initiative to release their own divine power auras.

It had to be said that the divine power auras of a rank six True Saint and a Peak rank five True Saint were very powerful.

Sensing these two auras, a trace of panic flashed through the eyes of the experts under the Third Prince’s command.

But right at this moment…

“Holy Feather Sect, hehe. A mere unranked sect, yet it’s so imposing.” An indifferent laughter suddenly sounded out. The person who laughed was surprisingly Chu Yixiao, who was standing beside the Third Prince.

At the same time that Chu Yixiao spoke, Deacon Long suddenly raised his head. Boom! Boom!

A similarly tyrannical divine power aura erupted.

This divine power aura was not weaker than Elder Zi Xing’s, and it was even slightly stronger!

“A rank six True Saint!”

“Another rank six True Saint!”

The experts under the Sixth Prince’s command were all shocked.

The experts from the Third Prince’s camp all let out a sigh of relief when they sensed that there was another rank six True Saint, and that his aura was even stronger.

Since there was a rank six True Saint in both camps, there was nothing to be afraid of.

“Who are you?” Elder Zi Xing narrowed his eyes and stared at Deacon Long, who was emitting divine power.

“Deacon Long of the Purple Sky Pavilion!” Deacon Long said coldly.

“Purple Sky Pavilion?” Elder Zi Xing’s expression changed.

The experts of the Sixth Prince’s camp were all shocked.

Even Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted.

Purple Sky Pavilion…was too famous in the First Heaven. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

In the First Heaven, the three pavilions, nine courtyards, and the twelve divine sects stood at the top!

The twelve divine sects alone were very powerful and had a deep foundation. It was not surprising that the twelve divine sects had given birth to Principles Masters. Even if the Principles Masters had either died or lost their whereabouts, the 12 divine sects all had top-notch Immortal Saints guarding them.

The 12 divine sects were like this, and the three pavilions and nine courtyards, which were above the 12 divine sects, were naturally even more powerful.

Especially the three pavilions!

They were the three overlords of the First Heaven!

Jian Wushuang had read the information of the three pavilions before. To be able to become one of the three pavilions, the purple pavilion must have a living Principles Master guarding it. Just this alone was enough to scare people, the Purple Sky Pavilion also had Immortal Saints who were invincible. There were many top-level and peak-level Immortal Saints, and their overall strength was extremely powerful.

Compared to the Purple Sky Pavilion, the Holy Feather Sect was nothing.

After all, the Holy Feather Sect was far inferior to the twelve divine sects. The most powerful Sect Master of the Holy Feather Sect, Moon Reflection Sect, was only a rank seven True Saint.

Moreover, in the entire Holy Feather Sect, there was only one rank seven True Saint.

“Someone from the Purple Sky Pavilion?” Elder Zi Xing’s expression was ugly. However, he immediately said in a low voice, “What does the fight within the Zhen Wu country have to do with your Purple Sky Pavilion?”

“How is it not related?” Chu Yi laughed coldly, “Listen carefully. From now on, the Zhen Wu Country is already under the control of my Purple Sky Pavilion. Moreover, my purple cloud pavilion has recognized Mu Feng as the new king of the Zhen Wu Country. Whoever dares to disobey will be going against my Purple Sky Pavilion!”

As soon as these words came out, the Sixth Prince’s camp immediately had a commotion.

If the Purple Sky Pavilion really had such an order, then not many people present would dare to disobey it.

“What a joke!”

Elder Zi Xing laughed coldly.
