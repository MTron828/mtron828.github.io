Chapter 2351: Restraint

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The Hong Jun Divine Rod emphasized power. It was domineering and extremely powerful.

As for Hong Jun Golden Swords, they focused on speed. When combined with Spacetime Rules of Order, their movements would be unpredictable and extremely creepy.

They were similarly made weapons but their natures were completely different.

In his previous life, Jian Wushuang had killed many experts by manipulating the Hong Jun Golden Swords.

And now, the first Second Grade Divine Demon that he had encountered was able to use the Hong Jun Divine Rod.

“Looks like I have underestimated you. It doesn’t matter though. You are still going to die!”

“Die!”

Xiang Yi’s voice was icy cold and the dullish-gold long rod before him shot out once again.

“When I got reincarnated, I lost all my treasures, including the Hong Jun Golden Swords. Otherwise, I could try using them against the Hong Jun Divine Rod,” Jian Wushuang mumbled to himself. Seeing the dullish-gold long rod striking towards him once again, he was fearless. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Boom!!

The imposing figure of the rod was like the tail of a serpent dragon that swept onto Jian Wushuang’s body directly. However, it didn’t hit anything material.

Clearly, this was just an illusion that Jian Wushuang had left behind after grasping the Spacetime Rules of Order.

As for the real Jian Wushuang, he had moved away like a phantom.

Weng~~~

Just like a phantom, Jian Wushuang covered a long distance and appeared before Xiang Yi suddenly.

“His speed...” Xiang Yi was astounded and wanted to pull back the Hong Jun Divine Rod to defend himself.

“Will you make it on time?” Jian Wushuang scoffed, thrusting his Blood Mountain Sword forward.

Although the Hong Jun Divine Rod was extremely powerful, it was ordinary in terms of speed and agility. These were its weaknesses.

Jian Wushuang had once practiced with an imitation of a Hong Jun Divine Rod. Therefore, he knew about these weaknesses.

When manipulating the Hong Jun Divine Rod, Xiang Yi would never reach the level of agility that Jian Wushuang had had with the Hong Jun Golden Swords.

Considering these circumstances and the fact that Jian Wushuang had grasped the Spacetime Rules of Order, his advantage in speed and agility was more prominent.

Weng!

The chilling sword light pierced towards Xiang Yi’s throat, and Xiang Yi clearly couldn’t pull back his Hong Jun Divine Rod in time to block the attack.

However, at this very moment, Xiang Yi shouted and flexed. Immediately after, a blurry wall of energy coalesced before him.

This wall was shockingly made up of his soul power.

The Hong Jun Divine Rod had to be used with one’s soul power and one’s understanding of Rod Principle to release the greatest might.

Since Xiang Yi could manipulate the Hong Jun Divine Rod to attack, he naturally specialized in the aspect of soul attack.

Now, his soul power had quickly gathered to form a headless giant carrying a toothed mace. As it shouted, it smashed towards Jian Wushuang furiously.

Following a loud crash, Jian Wushuang’s sword strike was neutralized. At the same time, an incredible soul power swept towards Jian Wushuang’s soul.

However, Jian Wushuang’s consciousness sea was guarded by a black Exquisite Pagoda. The soul power couldn’t shake the Exquisite Pagoda by the slightest.

“A meagre Chaotic Realm is so tough in the aspect of the soul as well?” Xiang Yi furrowed his brows and pointed his finger at Jian Wushuang. “Go!”

The returning Hong Jun Divine Rod smashed towards Jian Wushuang once again.

At the same time, the headless giant that had been formed from soul power also charged towards Jian Wushuang with the toothed mace.

As for Xiang Yi, he kept his eyes on Jian Wushuang. He was ready to release a soul attack at any moment to exert pressure on Jian Wushuang.

However, Jian Wushuang was simply too fast!

The Hong Jun Divine Rod couldn’t even catch the corners of Jian Wushuang’s clothes.

As for the headless giant, Jian Wushuang could easily make his way around it as well.

Jian Wushuang could choose to appear before Xiang Yi and engage in close combat with him.

If Jian Wushuang had not successfully created the Exquisite Pagoda, Xiang Yi’s soul attack might still have been a threat to Jian Wushuang. As for now, he couldn’t shake the Exquisite Pagoda even a little if his soul attack was compelling.

In other words, Xiang Yi’s three greatest tricks... The Hong Jun Divine Rod, the headless giant formed from soul power, and his soul attacks were completely ineffective against Jian Wushuang.

As for Jian Wushuang, he was a huge threat to Xiang Yi with his incredible sword technique.

Xiu! Xiu! Xiu!

Several rays of sword light were launched constantly.

Jian Wushuang was now totally engaged in battle. Although Xiang Yi was a Second Grade Divine Demon, he wasn’t well-versed in close combat fighting skills. All of a sudden, he was being pushed back by Jian Wushuang. He gave his all to continue driving the Hong Jun Divine Rod and releasing soul attacks.

However, they weren’t doing anything to Jian Wushuang at all.

This was, in fact, the weakness of an expert specializing in soul attack.

For an ordinary expert that specialized in the soul, they could only choose to flee if their soul attack couldn’t threaten the other party. Xiang Yi was in fact really strong. His soul could be used to attack or defend and could be considered to be close to perfection. Even if he was facing a Second Grade Divine Demon, he could exert considerable pressure with the might of the Hong Jun Divine Rod and the combination of the headless giant and soul attacks.

For most ordinary Second Grade Divine Demons, they could only flee in defeat.

However, he happened to be fighting Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was too fast and could completely ignore the Hong Jun Golden Rod and the headless giant.

He also had a strong soul defense and wasn’t afraid of Xiang Yi’s soul attack at all.

More importantly, Jian Wushuang’s close combat ability and Sword Principle were simply too frightening.

As a Second Grade Divine Demon, Xiang Yi had some level of skill in close combat fighting. Moreover, the intensity of his power was a lot greater than Jian Wushuang. Logically speaking, he should have the upper hand.

However, the reality indicated otherwise. Jian Wushuang was almost completely overwhelming him in close combat fighting.

“How can this be?”

“I’m completely suppressed by Jian Wushuang?”

“My soul attack can’t do anything to him?”

Xiang Yi’s expression darkened.

Previously, he had had no regard for Jian Wushuang at all. Even though Jian Wushuang had killed two Chaotic Divine Demons, they had only been Third Grade Divine Demons and there was a huge difference.

Now that he was fighting Jian Wushuang personally, he found Jian Wushuang to still be miles from him.

Yet, Jian Wushuang was completely countering him!

His attacks were rendered useless before Jian Wushuang.

While he was completely overwhelmed by Jian Wushuang’s close combat abilities:

Around the battlefield, the numerous experts from Lin Mansion were completely dumbstruck.

“A Second Grade Divine Demon is getting suppressed?”

“What is this? Wasn’t he enjoying a huge advantage previously?”

“Why do I feel that Xiang Yi has become a lot weaker suddenly?”

Most of the experts in Lin Mansion were weak and couldn’t understand the reason.

However, a few Divine Demon Realm experts were aware. It wasn’t that Xiang Yi had become weaker. Instead, Jian Wushuang was completely countering him, rendering Xiang Yi’s various attacks completely useless.
