Chapter 1813: Sword Slave

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Unfortunately, I lost nearly all of my treasures in that fierce battle. Only this piece of Five Gem Armor is for you. It is also severely broken.”

“Thank you,” Jian Wushuang was very grateful. “Predecessor, could you please do me another favor? ”

“Say it.” Wu Hun was very patient.

“I have a slave, and he was a strong man in the ancient times…” Jian Wushuang talked about Dao Yuanzi and their subtle relationship.

“So… do you want to completely erase his own consciousness and completely control him?” Wu Hun asked.

“Yes, only in this way will there be no risk, I wonder if you can help me?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, let your slave come out first.”

Jian Wushuang nodded, and immediately waved his sword and released Dao Yuanzi.

“My lord.”

Dao Yuanzi immediately vowed to the sword, and when he saw Wu Hun, he was shocked.

He had stayed in the sword and he knew what was happening outside, but he couldn’t hear the conversation between Jian Wushuang and Wu Hun.

“You are Dao Yuanzi?” Wu Hun asked with a powerful voice.

Dao Yuanzi looked at Wu Hun, and felt something bad was happening. Suddenly, he was struck by a great soul power.

Dao Yuanzi got scared.

He now knew what was happening.

“You want to erase my consciousness? You can never do that!!!” Dao Yuanzi resisted violently.

The strength of this resistance had even caused some difficulties for Wu Hun.

“Be quiet!” Jian Wushuang exerted some power onto Dao Yuanzi.

“Bastard, I have already surrendered to you. You kept me with you and even want to control my soul? ”

“I would rather die than let you succeed!!”

Dao Yuanzi snarled wildly, and with his roar, his soul began to burn.

For a practitioner, their soul being controlled was much more miserable than being dead.

Wu Hun increased his power and exerted to Dao Yuanzi’s body.

“Ah!” Dao Yuanzi screamed, his voice hysterical.

But the screams only lasted for a while.

After a while, he completely calmed down.

He stood there without awareness.

Seeing this scene, Wu Hun was relieved and said, “Fortunately, your slave is in a state of serious injury. Plus you have left a soul stamp on him. Otherwise … It is absolutely difficult to rely on my remaining consciousness to completely erase his consciousness.”

While talking, the shape of Wu Hun became more transparent, as if it was going to dissipate at any time.

Jian Wushuang understood.

There had been little consciousness left in Wu Hun’s body, and it was used to erase the consciousness of Dao Yuanzi, so Wu Hun had little energy left and he was going to dissipate.

“Thank you for your kindness, I will remember it forever.” Jian Wushuang said solemnly.

“I am glad to meet you. It is you that helped me. It is my fortune. If you really want to thank me, you should work hard to cultivate. If one day you become the very top one of the world, tell the other people of the Ancient Clan that you are the descendant of Wu Hun, then I will die without regrets!”

“Ha ha ~~~”

Wu Hun’s laughter still echoed in the heavens for a long time, but the shape of him was gradually becoming transparent under the gaze of Jian Wushuang.

Then, Jian Wushuang stood up and looked at Dao Yuanzi.

At this moment, Dao Yuanzi was completely different from how he had been before.

“His own consciousness has been completely erased, and now I will directly control him.” Jian Wushuang exerted the power into Dao Yuanzi’s mind.

Dao Yuanzi couldn’t resist at all. Soon, Jian Wushuang had completely controlled his soul.

“My Lord.”

Dao Yuanzi greeted Jian Wushuang, his eyes full of respect like never before. He had totally changed.

“From today, you are my first sword servant. Your name is now Jian Yi.”

“Yes, my Lord.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jian Wushuang nodded with satisfaction and then looked around.

“I have inherited the blood lineage of Wu Hun. So maybe I can conquer the consciousness of those soldiers just like Wu Hun did?” Jian Wushuang wanted to have a try.

Though those Dao Soldiers were not powerful individually, they could be a useful tool when hundreds of them fought together.

“Try it out.”

Jian Wushuang stepped forward.

Around Wu Hun’s corpse, many Dao Soldiers rose.

But this time, Jian Wushuang felt different.

“Dao soldiers were created with the blood essence of the Ancient Clan, with a purpose to protect Wu Hun’s body.”

So Jian Wushuang could easily conquer them as now he had inherited Wu Hun’s blood.
