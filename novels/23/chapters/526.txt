Chapter 527: Sheer Shadow

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

It was night. There was a nameless hill in the Sky Solitude Mountains.

Under the dim moonlight, Jian Wushuang stood on that hill with a longsword. He was clad in a black robe and his eyes were closed.

There was complete silence.

A fresh breeze started and blew past Jian Wushuang, causing him to finally open his eyes.

As his eyes opened, wow!

A sword shadow flitted in the dark sky.

This sword shadow was soundless but unique.

Extinction! Right, that was the Extinction Conception.

One sword attack would cause the extinction.

The sword shadow glided across the Void, leaving a long Sword River that dissipated slowly.

When it was over, the silence persisted but there was a smile on Jian Wushuang’s face.

“The Fourth Move of Heart-killing Sword Technique, finally I made it.” Jian Wushuang was filled with joy.

Sheer Shadow, the Fourth Move of Heart-killing Sword Technique, was a terrifying Killing Move. Its power was above Enchant which was the Third Move.

Jian Wushuang had been cultivating this move, especially during these two months in the Sky Solitude Mountains. He was unable to improve his comprehension of the Origin, so he had focused on the Sword Principle. Finally, he had figured out this sword movement.

“My strongest offensive power can be improved to the next level since I’ve understood this move.”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

Just then, a whooshing sound was heard.

Abruptly, the sound of wind whooshing could be heard issuing not far from the horizon. Although the sound was faint, Jian Wushuang was still able to hear it.

“Anyone here?”?Jian Wushuang frowned and immediately walked forward.

Under the dark cover of night, he could see ten people, including seven men and three women, rushing forward. All of them looked deadly serious.

“Soon, we will be able to leave the Sky Solitude Mountains and arrive at the human group’s territory.”

An elder with white hair and rosy cheeks led these people. He said in a low voice, “As soon as we leave the Sky Solitude Mountains, we will immediately be separated. We’ll obey the order to mix with the human group. After that, we will try our best to get close to the advanced experts in the human group, so that we can send as many messages as possible to our ethnic group, understand?”

The other nine people nodded solemnly.

These people were spies. The monster group had sent them here at great cost. The spies had to blend in with the human group to obtain important information or to assassinate some geniuses in the human group.

It had not been easy for them to survive the encounters with the East Camp barriers.

Once they made it past the Sky Solitude Mountains, they could get into the Huaman Territory. Then, they wouldn’t be easily recognized in the human group.

The ten monster spies were rushing forward.

Suddenly, a figure popped up in front of them and blocked their way.

“Hmm?”

The white-haired elder with rosy cheeks frowned and stopped immediately. He squinted at Jian Wushuang who had blocked their way and said, “You’re a human expert and even a Divine General!”

Jian Wushuang stared at the ten people, his guard up.

The Sky Solitude Mountains was behind the East Camp. It was a desolate landscape where even retirement sergeants in the East Camp were unlikely to pass. It was strange to see a ten-person squad with such high caliber here.

“Two experts are the Seven-cloud Realm and the rest are all the Six-cloud Realm, but these two experts don’t have any aura of the Divine General’s token.”?Jian Wushuang’s face clouded over.

If they didn’t have the aura of the Divine General’s token, then they were not Divine Generals. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The squad was obviously from the East Camp. However, in the East Camp, only a few sergeants were in the Seven-cloud Realm Level but were not Divine Generals.

It was very suspicious that such a squad was walking in the Sky Solitude Mountains in the dark.

“Who are you?”

As Jian Wushuang spoke, he discreetly crushed the Messaging Slip and sent a message to Qing Huo. He asked Qing Huo to bring a Monster Discriminator immediately.

Only the Monster Discriminator would be able to judge if they were monster spies or not.

“My Lord Divine General,” the elder answered. “We are sergeants in the third squad of the East Camp. We have a special mission and we are passing here.”

The monster group had been fighting with the human group for years, so they were familiar with the military system of the human group in the East Camp.

“Special mission? What is it?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I can’t tell you,” the elder answered humbly.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. He smiled and continued, “What a coincidence! I also have some friends in the third squad. I heard the Tian Ying commander in your squad has a bad temper, it’s really unlucky for you guys to work for him.”

Without thinking, the elder laughed and said, “Even though our commander has a bad temper, he is nice to us.”

The smile on Jian Wushuang’s face vanished when he heard the elder’s answer. At the same time, a Triple-kill Sword appeared in his hand. He gave the elder a cold look and said, “I’m sorry, but I don’t know anyone in the third squad and I just made up the Tian Ying commander.”

The elder’s expression changed dramatically and the expressions of the nine people behind him grew flinty.

They all knew that their true identities had been exposed.

“Monster spies!” Jian Wushuang’s cold voice resounded through the area.

“Kill him!”

The elder howled and then rushed towards Jian Wushuang to kill him. An aura of the Seven-cloud Realm erupted.

Without hesitation, the nine monster spies behind the elder also charged towards Jian Wushuang.

Since he had uncovered their identities, they had to kill him.

A flurry of attacks began.

Jian Wushuang raised his head and smiled. “Ridiculous!”

As soon as he made that utterance, Jian Wushuang transformed his figure and retreated. It happened so fast that the monster spies did not see the transformation.

Hua!

Soundlessly, Jian Wushuang’s figure appeared beside the elder.

“So fast?” The elder was shocked but Jian Wushuang’s Triple-kill Sword was already slashing at him.

It was only one slash, but Jian Wushuang put all his power behind it!
