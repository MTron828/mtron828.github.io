“This is...”

Jian Wushuang looked into the Interspatial Ring in his hand and saw a large number of Blood Gems piled up like a mountain.

The naked eye rough estimation amounted to around a few billion catties.

There was no doubt the Interspatial Ring was used to store those Blood Gems!

The 3,700,000,000 catties of Blood Gems from the mineral vein which amount to the wealth of 37,000,000,000 Primordial Stones were all in this Interspatial Ring.

“Jian Yi, give it to the Fort Master!”

The Scorpion King roared while relying on his last bit of the medicinal effect to try his best and stop those three Grand Ultimate Gods—Gu Ji, Bai Tu, and Li Qianji.

Those three Grand Ultimate Gods realized what the Scorpion King had given to Jian Wushuang.

“Quick! Stop him!”

“Kill that kid and take back the Interspatial Ring in his hand!”

“Hurry up!”

Those three Grand Ultimate Gods screamed as they were being held down by the Scorpion King and could not free their hands, but the Heaven Ultimate Gods from Life and Death Tower and Divine Demon Sect had the freedom to attack. More than a dozen Heaven Ultimate Gods in the void near Jian Wushuang gave up on chasing and killing the Crimson Stone Fort group before going straight at Jian Wushuang instead after hearing the three struggling Grand Ultimate Gods’ command.

Jian Wushuang had a determined look on his face. He cast a deep look at Scorpion King after making a decision.

“Run!”

Jian Wushuang was moving at his top speed as he tried his best to skim forward.

However, the Heaven Ultimate Gods from Life and Death Tower and Divine Demon Sect were right behind him.

Jian Wushuang had to do something.

Boom!

A majestic gush of divine power like a volcano that had been dormant for hundreds of millions of years erupted from Jian Wushuang.

It was just way too much.

The divine power discharged by Jian Wushuang was beyond what many Heaven Ultimate Gods’ could have imagined.

A pure divine power eruption.

He had used this trick when he first encountered the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor in the Dark Thunder Territory.

Their gap was astonishingly huge as he was only a Second-class Divine Demon at that time while the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor was a Peak Divine Demon.

However, Jian Wushuang had only used around 30 percent of his divine power which was sufficiently terrifying to forcibly block Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor away for a long time before managing a complete retreat.

The divine power he possessed was countless times greater than before after reaching Earth Ultimate God realm. He was also discharged more than 30 percent of his divine power—it was 50 percent!

How much exactly was 50 percent of the vast and incredible amount of divine power?

A divine power ocean!

A huge and boundless divine power ocean instantly formed.

There seemed to be no end to the divine power ocean. Divine power tidal waves at a few hundred feet to even a few thousand feet high frantically swept around.

The Heaven Ultimate Gods who came from every direction to attack Jian Wushuang were instantly crushed and drowned by the divine power ocean.

“How’s this possible?”

“How can his divine power...be so much?”

“Unbelievable. What a spectacular divine power!”

Those Heaven Ultimate Gods were shocked by the pure divine power’s impact. Although the power driven by that divine power was not too intense and it did not pose much threat to them, they still had to resist with all their strength and were busy dispersing it without any time to worry about Jian Wushuang.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang concurrently produced a few hundred apparitions at the same time before displaying his scary full speed.

In just a matter of seconds, he had shuttled out of those Heaven Earth Ultimate Gods besiege and left the battlefield.

“Scorpion King, farewell!”

Jian Wushuang left a message as he quickly disappeared from everyone’s sight.

The divine power ocean slowly faded away after he left.

The world was returned to its original state as the Transmigration World that spread throughout the battlefield had also disappeared.

“Garbage! A bunch of garbage!”

The three Grand Ultimate Gods—Gu Ji, Bai Tu, and Li Qianji—were furious.

On the other hand, the Scorpion King was grinning as he saw what Jian Wushuang had done.

“His cultivation speed is extremely fast as he had made a breakthrough from Primary-level Ultimate God realm to Peak Earth Ultimate God realm in just twenty years. His combat power is also strong enough to allow him to simultaneously contend against three Grand Ultimate Gods without being defeated. The techniques he has used—Transmigration World and the surging divine power he instantly discharged were shocking...”

“He’s extremely talented and powerful with great techniques with unfathomable potentials!”

“No wonder the Old Master appreciated him, haha... He’ll definitely help the Fort Master to resolve this deadlock and I won’t have any regrets even if I die!”

The Scorpion King smiled with shining bright eyes.

The medicinal effect in his body had completely dissipated and replaced by a serious side effect.

His divine power began to quickly fade away as well. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Scorpion King, go to hell!”

The three Grand Ultimate Gods—Gu Ji, Bai Tu, and Li Qianji—did not show the Scorpion King any mercy and killed the weakened Scorpion King who was incapable to resist without hesitation.

The battlefield gradually calmed down after the Scorpion King died.

Crimson Stone Fort had sent more than a dozen Heaven Ultimate Gods—eight of them had died and left their bodies behind with only a few managed to escape.

Some of the Official Army soldiers had also died during the battle but most of them managed to escape with the main reason being the Official Army had a very large number despite being relatively weak. Those Heaven Ultimate Gods from Life and Death Tower and Divine Demon Sect did not bother to chase after them when they scattered and fled.

What they cared about most was Jian Wushuang!

He had escaped under their noses!

He escaped from three Grand Ultimate Gods and more than a dozen Heaven Ultimate Gods.

Not only did he escape, but had also taken away the Interspatial Ring storing the Blood Gems!

The Life and Death Tower and Divine Demons Sect were originally here for the Interspatial Ring!

Although they killed the Scorpion King, they did not get the Interspatial Ring.

“Damn it! Damn it!”

Gu Ji, Bai Tu, and Li Qianji stood side by side with extremely gloomy expressions.

“We had a seamless plan. I thought the Scorpion King would die with none of the Crimson Stone Fort’s people able to escape. I also thought we’d definitely get the Interspatial Ring, but a petty Earth Ultimate God actually disrupted our plan.” Gu Ji held her hands tightly.

They had investigated each Heaven Ultimate Gods in Crimson Stone Fort present to ensure that the plan would go smoothly before carrying out their plan.

They had only done so for the Heaven Ultimate Gods and had left out the Earth Ultimate Gods.

Earth Ultimate Gods were just like ants to them after all. What impact could they have in the battle?
