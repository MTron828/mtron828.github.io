2305 The Figh

Under the gaze of the Zhuo Yunfeng couple, Lin Tiefeng and the rest, Jian Wushuang and Lin Yan walked to the center of the garden.

When they reached the center of the garden, Lin Yan held his sword up and told Jian Wushuang, “Draw your sword.”

“Sword?”

Jian Wushuang smiled. Everyone was confused when they saw him walk over to the tree at the side and pick up a tree branch about thirty centimeters long.

“This is my sword,” Jian Wushuang waved at Lin Yan and said.

“Jian Wushuang, are you trying to humiliate me?” Lin Yan exploded with rage.

The spectators knitted their eyebrows in confusion.

They thought that Jian Wushuang was being arrogant.

Even if Jian Wushuang had a terrifying talent in the Sword Doctrine, he had been tested for it and he was facing a child who was two years older than him. How could he beat him with just a branch?

“Wushuang is usually a thoughtful kid. Why is he doing all these nonsensical things when it comes to swordplay? Does he really want to become a Sword Boy?” Luo Xinqin said.

“Humph. Who knows? I realized he has been under my protection all along and has never tasted failure before. If he loses to Lin Yan today, I will definitely send him over to the Lin Family to become a Sword Boy,” thought Zhuo Yunfeng as he clenched his fists tightly.

Everyone thought that Jian Wushuang was being too arrogant and had underestimated Lin Yan.

The only people who would not think so were those who knew who he really was.

Jian Wushuang was an “old monster” who had lived for around a hundred thousand years. He would be making a joke of himself if he were to use the Blood Mountain Sword in a duel with a kid around fourteen years old. However, Jian Wushuang felt that he was bullying Lin Yan as by even using a branch.

If he wanted to humiliate the Lin Family, he could beat Lin Yan even without a branch.

“Humph. Since you want to become a Sword Boy so badly, I will fulfill your wishes. However, since I am two years older than you, I will be in a higher realm compared to you. To be fair, I will not use my divine power at all. We will only compete in terms of our sword skills,” Lin Yan said through clenched teeth.

“That is no need for that. Just use all the power you have. That way, you will be convinced about your eventual defeat. You are in the Early Stage of Transformed God Realm. I have also reached this stage.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

As he said this, a wave of divine power surged from his body.

“Huh?” Lin Yan was shocked. From the aura that was radiating from Jian Wushuang, he could sense that Jian Wushuang was as powerful as him.

“Early Stage of Transformed God Realm? He has reached this stage and he is only twelve?” Lin Tiefeng and Lin Yi looked over in surprise.

Even Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin were stunned.

The type of cultivation done in the Eternal Chaotic World was different to in the Absolute Beginning Divine World, hence the stages of cultivation were also named differently.

Within the Absolute Beginning Divine World, a cultivator would start as a Practice God.

In this realm, there were a total of thirteen steps.

Each step was a huge breakthrough. With how abundant Spiritual Energy was in the Absolute Beginning Divine World, any genius could finish the thirteen steps quickly.

After Practice God was Transformed God!

A Transformed God was equal to a universe god back in the Eternal Chaotic World.

A universe god would turn all of the spiritual energy he accumulated into pure divine power. This was the same in the Transformed God Realm. The only difference was that one had to pass the Universe God Trial to become a Universe God, while there wasn’t a trial to become a Transformed God.

What came after the Transformed God Realm was the Pure Sun Realm, which was also the equivalent of a Real God!

After the Pure Sun Realm was the Chaotic Realm, then the Divine Demon Realm. The Divine Demon Realm was also referred to as a Chaotic Divine Demon.

Under normal circumstances, a cultivator would become a Transformed God by the time he turned eighteen. People like Lin Yan would be considered geniuses as he was a transformed god at the young age of twelve. But now, Jian Wushuang had also shown that he was in the Early Stage Transformed God Realm.

Based on the aura, Jian Wushuang’s divine power seemed purer that of Lin Yan.

“Husband, do you know when Wushuang entered the Transformed God Realm?” Luo Xinqin asked.

“Nope. This little one never reveals too much about himself. Even though I did take note of his cultivation base. Based on my judgment, I thought he was in the tenth or eleventh step of the Practice God Realm. I never thought that he had become a Transformed God,” Zhuo Yunfeng shook his head and said.

He was pleasantly surprised.

Yes, he was pleasantly surprised.

Even though he did not know how good Jian Wushuang’s sword skills were, at least his cultivation base was good.

“Humph, your cultivation base is not weak. It is a pity that we are competing with our sword skills,” Lin Yan stared at Jian Wushuang and said.

“Come, attack me as you like.” Jian WUshuang smiled casually.

Lin Yan attacked without hesitation. He dashed forward and swung the sword he held in his hand.

A cold sword light was seen as the snow froze in the air.

He was still using Sword Principle Snow Congelation. He did not hold back anymore after finding out that Jian Wushuang was not a weakling.

Jian Wushuang also moved when Lin Yan attacked.

Hum!

A soft hum was heard.

The cold sword light was nowhere to be seen. The surrounding snow continued to fall to the ground.

The entire garden was completely silent.

Lin Yan’s eyes widened in surprise. He stood there as a branch was pushed up against his chest.

“You lost.” Jian Wushuang smiled lightly.

Silence!

The entire garden was silent.

Everyone was speechless.

Even Lin Tiefeng and the adults who stood around him were quiet. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Lin Yi, your understanding of the Sword Doctrine is the deepest among us. Did you see what Jian Wushuang did?” Lin Tiefeng asked with a deep voice.

“I, I...” Lin Yi stuttered. He shook his head and before he finally said, “No, I did not see what Jian Wushuang did.”

“What?” Lin Tiefeng and Zhuo Yunfeng were shocked again.

Neither of them were experts in the Sword Doctrine. It was understandable that they could not see what Jian Wushuang had done. On the other hand, Lin Yi specialized in the Sword Doctrine and his understanding of the Sword Doctrine should have been in the top thirty within the Anjiu Prefecture, even he did not know how Jian Wushuang attacked.
