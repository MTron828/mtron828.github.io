4757 Chewed Wine

Only big guys like the huge Sea Sky Octopus that had transcended the concept of Yan Immortal could control Yan Immortal’s consciousness, but it was still limited.

However, in this Heavenly Region, where even Entry Yan cultivators were rare, everything was like an ant to Jian Wushuang and the others, so they naturally did not have to worry.

“How is it, Old Four? Did they drink?”

“They drank it, they drank it. They already drank three jars!”

“That’s good. Send another 20 jars over later. We’ll just drug these ignorant Young Masters of the aristocratic families. Why do you think they’re out here for no reason? They’ll die in our hands in the end.”

“But then again, why is the effect of this medicine so bad? Ten jars in, and they are still standing? Give me more later.”

Separated by a layer of gauze, a few hunchbacked figures were discussing in low voices.

Naturally, their soft voices all entered the ears of Jian Wushuang and the other two.

After another whole jar of wine went down his stomach, Chen Qing picked up a peanut from the plate and asked, “Brother Jian, did you have enough to drink?”

Jian Wushuang put down the wine bowl and nodded.

After that, Cheng Qing knocked on the table with her finger. “Waiter, bill please.”

“It’s coming, it’s coming!”

More than a dozen fierce-looking men ran out from the back of the stall, all of them with sharp knives on their backs.

With just a glance, Cheng Qing raised his eyebrows and smiled. He flicked the peanut in his hand over.

The peanut that was wrapped in strong Yan power cut through space and passed through his body.

Swish-

The leader of the men didn’t even have time to take out the sharp knife on his back before he felt an unbearable pain in his stomach.

He subconsciously looked down and saw a head-sized hole in his stomach.

Even the dozens of men behind him were frozen on the spot, looking at the huge hole in disbelief.

“What an eyesore.”

No longer looking at them, Chen Qing waved his hand and released Yan power, crushing them into fine powder.

The restaurant was completely silent.

Jian Wushuang, who was sitting in the same place, also picked up a peanut and flicked it to the ceiling.

In an instant, the entire ceiling, along with the six floors of the top floor, collapsed.

Chun Qiu quickly released Yan power to protect the three of them.

Then, a few screams sounded, and then it was quiet again.

A moment later, in the lobby of a restaurant, a black-robed man was lying unconscious on his back.

On the other side of the black-robed man, a teary-eyed woman was looking at Jian Wushuang and the other two in horror. As she was cut by the gravel, there were a few more bloody marks on her beautiful face, which made her look even more delicate.

Seeing this scene, Cheng Qing could no longer sit still. He immediately stood up and kicked the unconscious man into powder.

“Young Lady, are you alright?” Chen Qing waved his hand to untie the rope on her body as he spoke with a gentle expression.

The woman subconsciously shifted away. “I’m fine.”

“You were kidnapped by them and brought here?”

“No, I’m the manager of this restaurant…”

After some small talk, Jian Wushuang and Chun Qiu silently looked at Chen Qing’s glib tongue and let down the soft and beautiful shopkeeper’s defense.

…

“My three honored guests, this is a unique brew personally brewed by the shopkeeper to repay you for saving my life.”

The real waiter brought a jade pot and poured another cup for the three of them. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The wine was crystal clear, and when it fell into the cup, it gave off a light fragrance.

Chen Qing’s index finger twitched, and he immediately picked up the cup and drank it all in one gulp. At the end, his eyes lit up. “Good wine, slightly sweet in the mouth, and also a little sour. Top quality!”

After tidying up her appearance, the gentle and beautiful woman walked out of the back of the carriage. When she heard this, her face could not help but blush.

When the waiter heard this, she immediately raised her thumb and said, “Your Excellency’s wine-tasting skills are top-notch. This excellent wine was personally made by my family. It was naturally fermented with chewed rice as the tune. It’s extremely delicious.”

The air froze and Jian Wushuang silently retracted his hand that touched the cup.

Chun Qiu, who had already drunk half a mouthful, stood rooted to the ground, his face turning green.

Cheng Qing’s mouth twitched, and his eyelids twitched uncontrollably, “You, you mean, this wine, is chewing wine?”

“That’s right, the wine yeast was personally chewed by me.”

“…”

Although the shopkeeper looked gentle and beautiful, he had never heard of anyone making wine by chewing the yeast. Jian Wushuang secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He was glad that he did not speak too fast, otherwise, he would be traumatized by wine.

Perhaps sensing that their expressions were unnatural, the gentle and beautiful woman pursed her lips and moved forward to remove the wine pot.

Cheng Qing hurriedly stopped her. “What’s the matter?”

“I know you guys don’t like it.” The gentle and beautiful woman pursed her lips.

“Well, it’s probably because the customs are different. I don’t mind.” As he said that, Cheng Qing directly took back the wine pot and began to drink to his heart’s content.

When the gentle and beautiful woman saw this, her face turned even redder. She turned around and ran back into the back of the store.

Jian Wushuang and Chun Qiu gulped unconsciously, sighing in their hearts about how powerful Chen Qing was.

“Good wine,” After finishing the jug, Cheng Qing wiped his lips and took out an exquisite palm-sized wine jug from his pocket, and threw it to the waiter. “Give it to me. Fill it up.”

…

“It doesn’t matter if it’s chewed yeast or not. The main thing is that I like to drink.”

Cheng Qing lay back down on the heavenly beast’s broad back, leisurely taking a sip of wine.

As they traveled outside the Heavenly Region, Chun Qiu held back his laughter and said, “Brother Chen, are you planning to leave just like that? I saw the shopkeeper’s eyes looking at you just now, and she seemed to be reluctant to part with you.”

Cheng Qing slowly opened his eyes and then closed them again, “She is a mortal, and I am a Yan Immortal. Since there is no end to this, I might as well pretend that nothing happened.”

Jian Wushuang agreed with Chen Qing’s words. Even a mortal who could not cultivate could live for more than 500 years due to the fate energy of the Great Yan Domain.

However, to a Yan Immortal’s destiny that had broken the shackles and his near-infinite lifespan, it might be a period of Enlightenment in the billions. All the ties in the past would turn into the clouds and smoke of the past.

It was best not to be tainted by this karma.

Sitting on the heavenly beast’s back, Jian Wushuang looked at the flowing galaxy and could not help but recall the deepest memory in his heart.

He had made a decision when he was about to come to the Great Yan Domain after the Divine Power Universe had cut off the past.

This decision was only known to Ninth Kalpa King, and it was personally carried out by him.

After Jian Wushuang had left the Divine Power Universe, Ninth Kalpa King had sealed a large realm with the maxim of Great Dao. In that large realm, Jian Wushuang’s descendants were also sealed.

Even though he had resolutely cut off his past, he was still selfish.

This was a stupid decision he had made because he did not dare to face the consequences.
