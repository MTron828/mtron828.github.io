Chapter 2977: Slaughter

——

“No!”

“Spare me!”

The bald old man let out a shrill scream. He wanted to beg for mercy from Qian Chen, but it was too late.

Qian Chen chased after the bald old man and slashed again. The bald old man did not have any room to struggle. His god body collapsed again.

Then, when the bald old man’s body reassembled, the saber light continued to slash out.

This happened only three times. The bald old man’s body reassembled four times, but his divine power was completely exhausted. In the end, he was still killed by His Highness Qian Chen.

After the bald old man died, His Highness Qian Chen picked up his interspatial ring. He scanned it with his consciousness and nodded slightly. The Dragon Flame Beast’s corpse was indeed in the bald old man’s hands.

“Those two fled really quickly.” His long and narrow eyes glanced at the distant void.

At the same time that he killed the bald old man, the divine bodies of the two True Saint companions of the bald old man had already reassembled. They immediately fled and could not care about the life and death of the bald old man at all. His Highness Qian Chen also had no way to chase after them.

After all, it would indeed take some effort to kill a True Saint expert who had an immortal body.

Even if he was much stronger than the bald old man and could destroy the other party’s divine body with one strike, the other party could still reconstruct his divine body.

Under such circumstances, he could only focus on the bald old man alone.

“Twelve teams, one team has been dealt with. There are eleven left…”

A cold smile appeared on Prince Qian Chen’s lips, and then he set off again.

In the void outside the Dragon Flame World, in the black dot shrine, the triangular-shaped battle-helmet man and the six black-clothed men under his command were all gathered together. In front of them was a huge mirror image, in the mirror image, the scene of what happened to Prince Qian Chen in the Dragon Flame World.

“Too powerful! Prince Qian Chen is too powerful!”

“Prince Qian Chen is only a Peak False Saint and not a True Saint. He doesn’t even have an immortal body yet. But when he killed a rank one True Saint, it was as if he killed a chicken. With one slash, he destroyed a powerful rank one True Saint’s divine body.”

“As expected of a super genius from the heaven and earth palace. His combat power is really strong.”

The six black-clothed men were continuously praising and sighing.

Clearly, the scene that appeared on the screen made them feel extremely shocked.

As for the triangular-shaped battle-helmet man, his expression was also quite interesting, “Heaven and Earth Palace… As far as I know, the Heaven and Earth Palace is only the lowest amongst the three most core palaces of our Sky War Alliance. Above them are the Primal Palace and the Primal Chaos Palace. The geniuses of these two palaces are truly terrifying, especially the Primal Chaos Palace!”

“Rumor has it that as long as a super genius from the Primal Chaos Palace doesn’t die, he or she will definitely be able to comprehend a law and become the Master of Laws!”

“Master of Laws!”

The six black-robed men looked at each other, their eyes filled with endless shock.

In their eyes, it was already heaven-defying enough for Prince Qian Chen to easily kill a first-level True Saint as a Peak False Saint. However, he only came from the Heaven and Earth Palace, which was the lowest of the three palaces.

They could not imagine how terrifying the geniuses from the Primal Palace and Primal Chaos Palace who were even higher than the Heaven and Earth Palace were?

“Those teams in the Dragon Flame World are going to be in big trouble.”

The man in the triangular helmet sighed quietly.

The truth was true as the man in the triangular helmet had expected. This Prince Qian Chen was too powerful. He was so powerful that he had definitely surpassed the level of a first-level True Saint.

Although he was alone, he could do whatever he wanted in the Dragon Flame World.

Moreover, he still had the positions of the twelve teams. According to the positions in the jade slip, he went to them one by one. First, he asked them to hand over the corpse of the Dragon Flame Beast. If they did not agree, he would take action immediately.

Under his thunderous methods, the teams could not resist at all.

One by one, the teams were mercilessly massacred by His Highness Qian Chen.

In fact, as long as these teams brought the Dragon Flame Beast’s corpse and stayed in the Dragon Flame World for a month, they would be rewarded with 200 million sacred elixirs. However, only ten days had passed in this month, and one-third had passed, eight out of the twelve teams had already been defeated.

The Dragon Flame Beast corpse in the hands of these eight squads had also fallen into the hands of Prince Qian Chen.

Twelve days after the mission began, this Prince Qian Chen had found the ninth squad hidden within the Dragon Flame World, and this squad was surprisingly the Barbarian King squad.

Bang!

Similarly, majestic divine power rose from Prince Qian Chen’s body, directly charging toward the cave abode where the eight Barbarian King squads were hiding.

The eight Barbarian King team members were immediately alerted and appeared in the void.

The Barbarian King Team members stared at Prince Qian Chen with strange expressions.

Jian Wushuang was also looking at Prince Qian Chen.

“This man…” Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted.

Although he sensed that the man’s aura was only at the peak of the False Saint realm, his sense of smell from the long years of slaughter and crisis told him that this black-robed young man was not simple.

“Who are you?” The Barbarian King’s voice was cold as he stared at Prince Qian Chen.

“You don’t have the right to know my name.” Prince Qian Chen appeared a little arrogant. “I’ll give you two choices. First, hand over the Dragon Flame Beast’s corpse and leave the Dragon Flame World!”

“Second, die!”

“What a joke!” The Barbarian King roared, but he did not care about his identity as a True Saint. He took a step forward and attacked.

As soon as the Barbarian King attacked, the terrifying power immediately pressed down on Prince Qian Chen. At the same time, the huge ax on his back appeared in his hand.

Everyone in the Barbarian King Team was shocked when they saw the Barbarian King’s attack.

From what they knew, man tie was someone who cared about his identity. His opponent was only a Peak False Saint. Under normal circumstances, man tie would not attack by himself. Even if he wanted to attack, he would not do his best in the beginning.

But now…the Barbarian King’s aura soared. A layer of pale golden armor appeared on his body. The giant ax in his hand was also very powerful.

Obviously, the Barbarian King had used his full strength and unleashed his strongest battle strength.

This was even more surprising.

Only Jian Wushuang could understand the Barbarian King’s intention.

“The Barbarian King must have realized that this man is not to be trifled with, so he attacked with his full strength.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and stared at the black-robed young man who was only a Peak False Saint.

Suddenly…

The black-robed young man, who was also Prince Qian Chen, attacked.

He only attacked casually, but when the dazzling saber light appeared in the world, everyone in the Barbarian King Team was shocked and furious! Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com
