“Red Dragon…” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang watched the Red Dragon King in astonishment.

He could feel the aura around the Red Dragon King, especially that unique Bloodline Power. Even Jian Wushuang himself dared not underestimate it.

Wasn’t the Red Dragon King’s power on par with the Abysmal Saint Master’s?

But now it was obvious to Jian Wushuang, the Red Dragon King had surpassed the Abysmal Saint Master. He’d gone above and beyond.

“Haha, from the looks of it, I’m not the only Great Emperor that hid their true power in the Sanctuary Alliance huh?” Great Emperor Zi Xu let out a hearty laugh.

“Hngh, I only achieved a breakthrough not too long ago, and I did not get a chance to demonstrate my power, so no one knew. But you’re different. You had so much power from the very beginning, but intentionally kept it hidden from us. You thought it through…” the Red Dragon King’s irises constricted. With an aura of death radiating around him, even his movements became forceful.

“Sword Emperor, together, let’s take him down!”

“Aye,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

With all the strength they had, they made their move.

Jian Wushuang alone could not have fully suppressed Great Emperor Zi Xu, but collaborating with the Red Dragon King… the Red Dragon King demonstrated astonishing skills, especially with the Ancient Dragon Clan Bloodline he possessed, making his power extremely formidable. In terms of battle skills he was only slightly weaker than Jian Wushuang, but more than enough to battle Great Emperor Zi Xu.

With both of them joining forces, Great Emperor Zi Xu naturally could not resist further, and was eventually suppressed.

Whether it was Jian Wushuang or the Red Dragon King, both their Bloodline Powers and Divine Powers were much more vigorous and copious than Great Emperor Zi Xu’s. If the battle went on any further, Great Emperor Zi Xu would most certainly die.

“AAAHHHH!!!! TO HELL WITH THE BOTH OF YOU!!!!”

A formidable roar let out, as Great Emperor Zi Xu finally began his frenzy. His Soul Power burnt rapidly.

“Soul Ignition?” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

He knew clearly how terrifying a Great Emperor who used Soul Ignition could become.

Great Emperor Zhi Luo had used Soul Ignition and the Secret Skills of Star Palace to fend off the many Great Emperors from the Three-Emperors World, gaining precious time for Jian Wushuang back then.

But Great Emperor Zi Xu was so much more powerful than Zhi Luo.

Boom!

Frenzied Great Emperor Zi Xu, having used Soul Ignition, appeared in front of Red Dragon King almost immediately.

“Red Dragon, watch out!!” Jian Wushuang tried to warn him.

Hong!

A merciless spear pierced through Heaven and Earth, causing the Void to explode to form a Spacetime Storm. This Storm ravaged the entire manor.

Once heaven-on-earth, the manor was now no more than rubble.

Against such a powerful spear, the Red Dragon King gave everything to resist, but it was not enough. With a loud thud, the Red Dragon King was thrown back, his body trembling after such a tremor. He was left largely unhurt, thankfully.

Jian Wushuang’s gaze was sharp-eyed like a razor. Power from within his body was emerging as more heads and limbs popped out from him.

“Bring it on, Zi Xu!!”

Jian Wushuang let out a roar, within a few moves he was in front of Great Emperor Zi Xu, his swordsmanship mercilessly used to cut Zi Xu down.

Under normal circumstances, Great Emperor Zi Xu’s death was already inevitable, having used Soul Ignition. There was no need to go hard on Zi Xu – simply avoid his blows and wait for the Soul Ignition to end.

But Jian Wushuang, he had no fear.

Against the frenzied Great Emperor Zi Xu, he insisted on going hard, as an unbridled battle pursued.

Earth-shattering roars echoed through the air, as if the sky was on the brink of collapse.

The battle ensued for several breaths of time. Finally, Great Emperor Zi Xu’s aura diminished, the light from his eyes dimmed, and soon he could not be heard.

The spy of the Acheron Palace, fifth in the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, had fallen!

“Is he finally dead?”

Jian Wushuang was still standing in the Void as he watched Great Emperor Zi Xu’s lifeless body fall from the sky, displaying no expression of any sort. His aura remained strong.

You must know, even during his encounter with Demon King Chen Yu in the Three-Emperors World he managed to stay energised throughout the entire battle thanks to his strong power from within himself.

Great Emperor Zi Xu could use Soul Ignition to gain that temporary burst of energy all he wanted, but compared to Demon King Chen Yu? It was barely enough. Jian Wushuang had only fought him for several breaths of time, and naturally Wushuang emerged unscathed.

Whizz!

Red Dragon King appeared beside Jian Wushuang.

As he gazed upon Great Emperor Zi Xu’s corpse, Red Dragon King could not help but gasp in admiration. “Sword Emperor, what a marvelous feat! The Ancient Dragon Clan Bloodline, my strength and self defence mechanisms have made me extremely powerful. But even I, faced against the frenzied Great Emperor Zi Xu, having ignited his own soul, could not do much but retreat. But you, you faced him head on, and emerged without a scratch… I guess what Zi Xu said was right. Amongst the Great Emperors in the Sanctuary Alliance, your power is the closest to Emperor Bai’s.”

“Second in rank amongst the Heaven and Earth Supremes, definitely goes to you.”

Having heard this, Jian Wushuang could not help but laugh.

He was not interested in rankings, after all.

他对这些什么排名可不感兴趣.

Wong!

A figure precipitated. Emperor Bai had arrived too.

“Emperor Bai,” Jian Wushuang and Red Dragon King immediately turned around.

Emperor Bai glanced upon Jian Wushuang, a trace of a smile playing across his lips. “Not bad Wushuang, such fighting power at the Second Stage… so much stronger than me when I first began.”

Emperor Bai had nothing but praise for Jian Wushuang.

The reason why he had sent Jian Wushuang and Red Dragon King to take down Great Emperor Zi Xu was also because he wanted to witness Jian Wushuang’s capabilities.

And Jian Wushuang had indeed proved himself.

“It’s only a shame you’re lacking in Dao realisation for you to ascend to Doctrine Palace’s ninth level, which is the standard for all Great Emperors. Otherwise, you would’ve been the top amongst the The Second Stage Great Emperors.” Emperor Bai heaved a sigh.

“Second Stage Great Emperors?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled. “What do you mean by that, Emperor Bai? You mean there are levels and ranks even amongst Great Emperors?”

“You didn’t know?” Emperor Bai looked at Jian Wushuang astonished, nodding soon after. “Makes sense anyway. You’ve improved so quickly, and you’ve only reached Great Emperor so recently, it’s only natural you lack this area of knowledge. Let me explain it to you.”

Jian Wushuang fixed his attention on him, listening closely.

“Wushuang, you’ve encountered many Great Emperors in the Three-Emperors World, amongst them were extremely powerful ones, power even comparable to Demon King Chen Yu’s level. You can tell, even though they are all Great Emperors, in terms of ability… the disparity is clear, right?” Emperor Bai smiled.
