Chapter 2632: Condition

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Boom!

Jin Yihang felt that he was hit hard by a huge world with its power grinding his body. His internal organs were displaced as blood poured out from his eyes, nose, ears, and mouth.

The impact would be enough to instantly kill Jin Yihang had Jian Wushuang not held back toward the end.

Whoosh!

Jin Yihang barely managed to stand firm in the void with his pale face whereas his body was trembling violently.

His divine power breath was at its weakest as though he could be completely wiped out at any time.

Cang Heng and several other commanders watched in disbelief.

They knew that Jian Wushuang’s combat power was at the Peak Earth Ultimate God level and should be considered extremely strong among Peak Earth Ultimate Gods upon seeing Jian Wushuang defeat the Green Flame Territorial Lord. However, they had never expected Jian Wushuang’s combat prowess to be so strong.

The four Peak Earth Ultimate Gods who joined forces were instantly defeated without breaking a sweat!

His combat prowess level was probably comparable with Heaven Ultimate Gods, right?

“You! How dare you hurt me?”

Jin Yihang’s eyes widened followed by a loud shriek as he was looking at Jian Wushuang in malice and folie.

“Hurt you?” The corner of Jian Wushuang’s lips was slightly raised. “No! I’m afraid you’ve misunderstood. Believe it or not, not only would I dare hurt you, but I also dare kill you too.”

Jian Wushuang’s smiling expression looked like a devilish smile to Jin Yihang at that moment.

“No, you absolutely will not dare. I’m an inspector from the Crimson Stone Fort, Crimson Stone Fort will never let you go if you kill me!” Jin Yihang roared with his deliberate loud tone and seemed to be cheering for himself.

He firmly believed that Jian Wushuang would only hurt him at most and never thought that Jian Wushuang would ever kill him.

Otherwise, Jian Wushuang would have killed him just now when he got the chance.

Jian Wushuang looked at Jin Yihang and sneered, “You’re really stupid, so what if I kill you? Don’t forget that the Blood Gem mineral vein is still in my hands. I believe many factions will be interested in this mineral vein if I release the news.”

“Would the likes of Nanwu Palace, Divine Demon Sect, Life and Death Tower, Dongfang Clan, and such care about the Crimson Stone Fort? Do you think they won’t accept it were I to share this mineral vein with them in return for their protection?”

Jin Yihang was horrified.

His pride, self-righteousness, and envious background in the Crimson Stone Fort collapsed.

He might be full of himself but he was no fool.

He knew what Jian Wushuang said was true.

Jian Wushuang was indeed capable of killing him on the spot.

Jin Yihang’s attitude began to change after recognizing the fact.

“Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord. No, Master Jian Yi.” Jin Yihang forced a smile on his face. “That’s just a misunderstanding. We can slowly talk about it now.”

“Talk about it? What do you want to talk about?” Jian Wushuang sneered.

Jin Yihang’s divine power breath was extremely weak as he quickly took out a few elixir pills and swallowed them. He opened his mouth after a couple of breaths while still feeling a little weak and said, “The Blood Gem mineral vein appeared in Northern Darkstar Territory and was acquired by the Official Army earlier. Northern Darkstar Territory can indeed keep a part of the wealth after alerting the Crimson Stone Fort of its existence according to the rules.

“However, this Blood Gem should be of no use to you, so we will replace it with Primordial Stones. Crimson Stone Fort will fork out fifty million Primordial Stone as a reward for Northern Darkstar Territory who discovered and guarded this Blood Gem mineral vein. How about that?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Fifty million Primordial Stones?” Cang Heng and the other commanders were shocked and overjoyed.

Primordial Stones in the millions were exorbitant to those Peak Ultimate God commanders as many of them could not earn even a million Primordial Stones in their lifetime. It was not hard to imagine how happy they were with those fifty million Primordial Stones?

They had never seen such a huge amount of Primordial Stones ever since they started cultivation.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang was a little dissatisfied when he heard the amount. “Fifty million Primordial Stones is too little. Are you trying to dismiss beggars? Don’t forget that this Blood Gem mineral vein is huge with its value of more than thirty billion Primordial Stones. How dare you offer us fifty million Primordial Stones!”

Jin Yihang was a little embarrassed and spoke again after a little hesitation, “One hundred million Primordial Stones. Nothing more!”

“One hundred million!” The few commanders gasped.

Jian Wushuang groaned slightly.

One hundred million Primordial Stones was not much for Jian Wushuang at that moment. However, he knew that he was merely a Territorial Lord with a combat power of at most Heaven Ultimate God. The Crimson Stone Fort was considered a powerful force to Jian Wushuang, so he could not ask for too much.

Just as previously described, Crimson Stone Fort was taking the meat while Northern Darkstar Territory could only just have its gravy.

He got 100,000,000 out of the 30,000,000,000 Primordial Stones—one three-hundredth was still quite a lot.

“Just one hundred million then, but I have a condition,” said Jian Wushuang.

“What condition?” Jin Yihang glanced over.

“I don’t need Primordial Stones. I want Divine Elixir Pills. You’ll have to replace the one hundred million Primordial Stones with an equivalent amount of Divine Elixir Pills which comes to twenty Divine Elixir Pills,” said Jian Wushuang.

Jin Yihang roared, “No way! A Divine Elixir Pill’s market price is worth five million Primordial Stones. However, the fact remains that you might not even be able to exchange them for a single Divine Elixir Pill even if you fork out ten million Primordial Stones. Although Crimson Stone Fort has an extraordinary background and a lot of elixir pills, we’ll never give away twenty Divine Elixir Pills as a reward. It’s simply impossible!”

Jin Yihang paused before continuing, “Fifteen—at most fifteen Divine Elixir Pills. I have to get approval from the Crimson Stone Fort’s high-level management to personally agree to this condition for this.”

“Just fifteen it is. You may get the approval now.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He never expected to get 20 Divine Elixir Pills and thought it was quite good if they could get even ten.

Fifteen was beyond his expectations.

According to his estimations, he would need about 20 Divine Elixir Pills to make a breakthrough from Peak Ultimate God to Primary-level Earth Ultimate God. He had already obtained four Divine Elixir Pills and would have 19 Divine Elixir Pills when he received the 15 from Crimson Stone Fort. It should allow him to attempt a breakthrough to the Primary-level Earth Ultimate God realm.
