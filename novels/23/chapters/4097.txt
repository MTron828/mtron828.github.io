Chapter 4098: Comparable to a Supreme-Being?

“Of course, Blackhawk is a Supreme-being. He shouldn’t have bothered to fight against a weak and low-level special life-form. But today, he attacked you and was willing to take out three Heaven Lake Divine Fruits to ask me to leave…after all, the Heaven Lake Divine Fruits are extremely valuable. A single one is enough to make a Supreme-being envious, but he was willing to take out three of them. It seems that your life-level is very high.”

“My lord, to tell you the truth, I am a perfect life-level cultivator,” Jian Wushuang said.

“A perfect life-level cultivator?” Ruler Heart Slayer’s eyes lit up. “Haha, I Knew It. I was wondering how Blackhawk could be so generous. It turns out that he has his eyes on a perfect life-level cultivator. There are countless special life-forms in the vast universe, but only a handful of them can reach the perfect life-level. In the current universe alone, there are no more than five living perfect life-forms!”

“Although Blackhawk is a Supreme-being, he has never met a perfect life-form. If he can kill you, he will be rewarded handsomely from the Cosmos Temple. In comparison, three Heaven Lake Divine Fruits are nothing.”

!!

Heart Slayer understood why Blackhawk was willing to take out three Heaven Lake Divine Fruits and ask him to leave.

If it were him, he would be willing to give him five or ten portions of the Heaven Lake Divine Fruits as long as he could kill Jian Wushuang, not to mention three portions of the Heaven Lake Divine Fruits.

Killing a perfect life in the Cosmos Temple was definitely a great merit.

“Little guy, you are actually a cultivator at the level of a perfect life?” Ruler Heart Slayer looked at Jian Wushuang with a fiery gaze.

He had learned about Jian Wushuang from Supervisor Feixue. He knew that Jian Wushuang had comprehended a trace of the universe principle at the level of a principle Ruler. He was already a super genius rarely seen in billions of Star Worlds, there were probably no more than ten such super geniuses in an era of the universe.

Such a genius was already amazing enough. In addition to his even rarer status of a perfect life-level, how great was Jian Wushuang’s potential?

Although Ruler Heart Slayer was very knowledgeable, he could not predict Jian Wushuang’s future achievements.

Because in his eyes, Jian Wushuang had a bright future. As long as he did not die halfway, it was possible for him to reach any level in the future.

What he could guess now was Jian Wushuang’s lowest achievement. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Little guy, with your potential, as long as you don’t die halfway, you will definitely become an Ultimate Ruler. And if nothing goes wrong, when you become an Ultimate Ruler, you should be comparable to an ordinary Supreme-being,” Ruler Heart Slayer said with a smile.

“Comparable to a Supreme-being?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

How powerful was a Supreme-being?

Jian Wushuang had not known about it before the fight, but after the fight, he realized that there was a huge gap between a Supreme-being and a Ruler that could not be bridged.

Before he met the Supreme-being who had killed him, he had fought with an Ultimate Ruler, or even a top-tier Ultimate Ruler. With his powerful body-protection techniques, Thunder God Palace Master had used all his skills, but he could not do anything to him.

Logically speaking, Jian Wushuang was strong enough. But when he met the Supreme-being, he realized how ridiculous his strength and body-protection technique were in front of the Supreme-being.

The Supreme-being who had chased him in the Dusty Rain Star World had just casually attacked him, but he had been severely injured and almost died. The difference in strength was like heaven and earth.

It was because the difference was too great that Jian Wushuang was not sure whether he could match an ordinary Supreme-being after becoming an Ultimate Ruler.

“Little guy, I know you’re only a third-level Ruler, but your battle strength is barely comparable to an Ultimate Ruler?” Heart Slayer looked over.

“I guess so, but I also used some special methods,” Jian Wushuang said.

“No matter what method you use, it’s a fact that you have such battle strength.” Ruler Heart Slayer smiled, “If you can reach this level in the third level, then when you break through to the fourth level, your battle strength should be comparable to that of a superior Ultimate dominator. When you reach the fifth level…I’m afraid that few Ultimate Dominators will be your match. Once you break through to the Ultimate dominator level, your strength will undergo a qualitative change again. When that time comes, it’s not an extravagant hope to be comparable to a Supreme.”

Jian Wushuang nodded secretly.

Indeed, he already had such battle strength at the third level, and he still had three major realms, the fourth level, the fifth level, and the Ultimate Ruler level. If he could surpass all three major realms…especially when he broke through from the fifth level to the Ultimate Ruler level, it would be a huge transformation.

By that time, his strength would definitely soar to a whole new level. He might even be comparable to or even stronger than an ordinary Supreme-being!

“My lord, is there an Ultimate Ruler in the universe who is comparable to an ordinary Supreme-being?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Well…yes, but very rarely. Under normal circumstances, every 10,000 chaos cycles or so, there will be a super genius who is comparable to an Ruler at the level of an Ultimate Ruler. There are even super geniuses who can kill an Ruler in a head-on fight at the level of an Ultimate Ruler. For example, 100,000 chaos cycles ago, a super genius named Jie Dong was a Ruler who had reached the Ultimate level. He was not a special life form and was merely an ordinary cultivator. However, his comprehension of the principles of the universe was frighteningly high, even higher than that of an ordinary top-tier Ruler. Coupled with some special encounters, his strength was incomparably terrifying.”

“In his era, he was recognized as the number one Ruler in the vast universe. He was so strong that he had killed an Ruler in a head-on fight!” Said Heart Slayer.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help but take a deep breath.

An Ultimate Ruler who had achieved the status of an ordinary life-form had killed an Ruler in a head-on fight?

This Ultimate Ruler named Jie Dong was so terrifying!

“Unfortunately, it was because this Supreme genius named Eastworld was simply too heaven-defying that all of his enemies were terrified of him. As a result, his enemies paid an enormous price and even lost the lives of several Rulers to kill this genius named Eastworld. If Eastworld hadn’t died, he would’ve long ago become an Ruler by now. Given his talent, he would’ve long ago surpassed Supreme Rulers and reached the virtually invincible level.” Ruler Heart Slayer sighed softly.
