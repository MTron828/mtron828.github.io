4745 Face the Wall and Be Punished

None of the Yan Immortals from the Heavenly Court could have predicted such an ending.

Jian Wushuang was like a startled swan, barging into every line of sight. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

It was too unbelievable. This was the first time that the Immortal Peach was taken by a Yan Immortal, who was not one of the seven Princes.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang was not the Young Emperor’s companion, so the Immortal Peach in his hand was completely his.

He took out the Immortal Peach that contained the shackles of fate from his arms. He did not even look at it longingly. It was like an ordinary fruit.

“Hey, catch.” Jian Wushuang smiled and threw the Peach to the Young Emperor.

A stream of light streaked across the air and then landed in his hand.

Looking at the fruit in his hand, the Young Emperor raised an eyebrow. He only needed to take a bite and the Fortune in the Immortal Peach would rush into his body and help him break through.

However, the next moment, the Young Emperor opened his palm and cut the Peach in half.

“Hey, catch.” He said the same and threw half of the Immortal Peaches to Jian Wushuang.

The two of them smiled at each other before biting down on the Immortal Peach in their hands.

…

The Immortal aura was vast, and the smoke was flowing.

The Heavenly Court, which was still filled with singing and dancing, was extremely quiet at this moment.

Emperor Zhen Wuyang, who was sitting on the Emperor’s throne, was suppressing his anger with his intimidating eyes.

Below him, the Princes were all silent and dejected.

Prince Jiu, who had just woken up from his coma, had a pair of cold, heroic eyes.

Two figures slowly walked into the giant hall of the Heavenly Court.

The Young Emperor, who had changed into a luxurious court dress, had a rare smile on his face. He did not care that all the eyes were on him.

Jian Wushuang looked calm as he slowly walked forward. It was as if he had mountains and rivers in his heart, vaguely revealing a majestic aura.

He did not panic at all in the face of such a scene. He even wanted to say that it was a small scene in his heart.

Before he entered the Great Yan Domain, he had stood at the peak of the Divine Power Universe and had the experience of controlling the Great Dao. This had made his every move carry a sense of awe that could not be erased.

Even Zhen Wuyang, who was sitting on the Emperor’s throne, felt that he was on the same level as this young man.

However, this feeling was soon erased from his mind. Zhen Wuyang suddenly slapped the desk and shouted, “Impudence!”

All of the Yan Immortals were silent. They naturally knew why the Emperor was so angry.

All the taboos that could not be broken in the previous Peach-seizing battles had been broken this time.

They formed their own groups and became the weapons and dogs of the Princes. They no longer behaved like the Yan Immortals of the Heavenly Court.

However, most importantly, the rule that the Heavenly Court must not be stained with blood was broken by the Young Emperor and the strange guy beside him.

Thus, at this moment, all the Yan Immortals that were participating in the fight for the Peach were looking at the two of them with meaningful looks.

“Why aren’t you kneeling, you good-for-nothing!” Zhen Wuyang shouted angrily again, and his palm almost broke the desk in front of him.

However, the two figures did not move at all.

Jian Wushuang was baffled and looked to the side.

The Young Emperor smiled and said, “Imperial Father, if you want me to kneel, you must have a reason. After all, I’m a good-for-nothing and I can’t stand in front of them.”

Then, he looked at the other six Princes with a mocking expression.

Emperor Zhen Wuyang was furious and slammed the table again. “I’m your father! Isn’t this reason enough? Yes or no?”

The Young Emperor knelt down on one knee. “That’s enough.”

Seeing the Young Emperor kneel down, Zhen Wuyang’s expression softened a little, and he glanced at the Yan Immortals with his attractive eyes.

“What a foul atmosphere. It was a good match, but dozens of Yan Immortals died. Do you think you can ignore this iron law?!”

Prince Yu, who was full of anger. stood up and said, “Imperial Father, those Yan Immortals were killed by Prince Yan and the guy beside him. We didn’t fail…”

“Do you think your mistake is lighter than theirs?” Zhen Wuyang looked at him and said, “You destroyed the divine mountain peak that supported the Heavenly Realm with your own hands and tried to break the rules in vain. You wanted to use it to undo the restriction on the Immortal Peach. Tell me, did you do it?!”

Prince Yu broke out in a cold sweat. He did not expect that his true intentions would be discovered by his meaningless actions. “Imperial Father, listen to me…”

“No need to explain. Later, go to the Heavenly Realm and receive 100 strikes with the cane, not a single strike less!” Zhen Wuyang said angrily.

Prince Yu’s face turned pale. The 100 strikes in the Heavenly Realm were all personally carried by the great master, and each strike was enough to make an ordinary Yan Immortal suffer.

If he were to be hit 100 times, he would probably be unable to get out of bed for 100 years!

“Yes, Sir.” Prince Yu gritted his teeth and returned to his original seat. Prince Mo, who was not on good terms with him, almost laughed out loud.

Zhen Wuyang said in a deep voice, “I’m very disappointed in your performance in this Immortal Peach battle. Later, all of you will go to the Heavenly Realm and receive 50 flogs to reflect on yourselves!”

All of the Yan Immortals had bitter expressions on their faces. They did not gain much from the Heavenly Court’s feast, but instead, they received 50 cane strikes.

However, no one dared to refute him. They all cupped their hands and said, “Yes, Sir.”

At this time, the Young Emperor pretended to cough, and his pale face turned red.

“Father, Prince Yan’s body is weak. I’m afraid I can’t take the cane…”

Emperor Yang of Zhenwu nodded and waved his hand. “Prince Yan is exempted from punishment. The rest of you will be punished as usual.”

Hearing this, the other six Princes were all indignant. They glared at the Young Emperor but did not dare to say anything for fear of being hit a few more times.

As if he was afraid that the Yan Immortals would think that he was biased, Zhen Wuyang said, “But Prince Yan’s behavior was terrible, so he will be punished to be face the wall of the Wind-Listening Platform for 10 years.”

It would have been fine if he did not say this, but once he did, all the Yan Immortals’ gazes almost burned the Young Emperor to ashes.

He said he was going to the Wind-Listening Platform to be punished, but wasn’t it more appropriate to say he was going on a vacation?

The entire platform was filled with peach and bamboo trees. The Heavenly Court’s Immortals were chatting among them, and from time to time, one could even see the Fairies dancing.

In such an environment, how could he face the wall and reflect?

“What are you waiting for? Do you think the punishment isn’t enough?” The voice of Zhen Wuyang rang out.

Hearing this, all the Yan Immortals rushed out of the Heavenly Court, afraid of falling behind.

After taking a deep look at the Young Emperor, a glint of gloominess and ruthlessness flashed in Prince Jiu’s eyes. Then, he strolled out of the Heavenly Court.

For a moment, there were only 100 figures left in the vast Heavenly Court.

All the Elders looked at the Young Emperor and Jian Wushuang with great interest, as if they were very interested in their team.

Zhen Wuyang looked at Jian Wushuang with a domineering gaze and said, “Why don’t you go and receive your punishment?”
