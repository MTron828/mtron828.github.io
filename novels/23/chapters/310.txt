Chapter 311: Upgrade, A First-grade Magic Weapon!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“You practiced your swordsmanship, I played my zither. There is nothing to thank me for.” Glancing at Jian Wushuang, Leng Rushuang said in a cold voice, “You should thank it.”

Leng Rushuang turned her hand over and a long sharp sword appeared.

“Triple-kill Sword.” Once it appeared, Jian Wushuang stared at it.

It was his weapon, so he certainly recognized it.

To survive Tan Feng’s chase, he had abandoned the Triple-kill Sword and all of his belongings. He planned to take them back when he was strong enough to defeat Tan Feng. He didn’t expect the Triple-kill Sword to be in Leng Rushuang’s possession.

“I took it back from Tan Feng for you.” After saying that, Leng Rushuang threw it to Jian Wushuang.

After catching it and gripping it firmly, Jian Wushuang began stroking the cold sword edge. At the same time, the Triple-kill Sword seemed to be shaking violently, in a cheerful manner. Suddenly, Jian Wushuang’s face changed, “Its power...”

After holding it, he felt that the Triple-kill Sword’s power had increased by a large margin!

It was originally a medium second-grade magic weapon, but now...

“It is a good sword. Since it’s the embryo for a Sword of Killing, it still has room for improvement.” Leng Rushuang glanced at Jian Wushuang and said, “I noticed Sword Spirit was damaged when I took it back, so I restored its power using some special means and... it upgraded.”

“Now it is a first-grade magic weapon.”

She spoke like it was something simple, but Jian Wushuang was shocked when he heard what she said.

“First-grade, a first-grade magic weapon?”

Feeling the power of the Triple-kill Sword, Jian Wushuang was dumbstruck.

Weapons are classified into three grades!

The third grade is normal, the second grade is spiritual, while the first grade is masterful!

On the Nanyang Continent, even a third-grade magic weapon is rare. Even experts of the Saint Realm would be eager to get one. The Holy Emperor Palace offered a superior third-grade magic weapon as a reward for capturing Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian, which attracted a lot Saint Realm experts.

There were only a few second-grade magic weapons on the Nanyang Continent. Only top sects like the Alchemy School and the Holy Emperor Palace might have them.

As for first-grade magic weapons... They only existed in legends on the Nanyang Continent!

Even the Alchemy School or the Holy Emperor Palace might not have one.

But now, Jian Wushuang’s Triple-kill Sword had upgraded to a first-grade magic weapon?

Within only a month, Leng Rushuang had restored the Triple-kill Sword’s full power and even upgraded it to the first grade?

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath, then he looked at Leng Rushuang earnestly.

The longer he stayed with Leng Rushuang, the more unfathomable he felt she was.

Whether it was the incredible melody she played that could speed up comprehension of Origin and Spiritual Power, or her ability to upgrade the Triple-kill Sword, both implied that Leng Rushuang had exceptional strength.

He was curious about Leng Rushuang’s background, but he knew better than to ask.

“Your sword had been upgraded to a powerful first-grade weapon, so you need to be careful. If it’s not necessary, do not use it.” Leng Rushuang’s voice was still cold as she said, “I will give you a sword. Although it is only a superior third-grade magic weapon, it’s enough for daily use.”

Moving her hand again, a purple flowing light appeared. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

It was a purple longsword that resembled the Triple-kill Sword in both shape and size. However, it was far less powerful.

While looking at the purple longsword, Jian Wushuang thought it was strange.

Not the purple longsword, but the person who gave it to him, Leng Rushuang.

She has been giving him the cold shoulder from the very beginning. Yet now, she is suddenly treating him so well. Not only did she reclaim his Triple-kill Sword and upgrade it, she also gave him another magic weapon?

When did this lady, that causes everyone else to feel fear, become so nice?

Though he was confused, he took a deep breath and said seriously, “I owe you a favor. If you need my help someday, I will do my best.”

During this month of cultivation, he had improved a lot while listening to her play the zither. Now, she even gave him the Triple-kill Sword and the purple longsword. Though he didn’t know what she wanted, he still felt grateful.

“I do need your help, but not now. You are not strong enough yet. I will look for you once you meet the requirement. At that time, you will definitely help. After all, I rarely need help from others,” Leng Rushuang said coldly.

“Sister, send him away.”

Leng Ruxue quickly walked out of the room.

“Big Brother Wushuang, follow me,” said Leng Ruxue as she led Jian Wushuang out.

Jian Wushuang followed Leng Ruxue and walked out of the woods. Once they made it to the perimeter, Leng Ruxue took out a jade token and handed it to Jian Wushuang.

“Big Brother Wushuang, take it. Maybe you will need it,” Leng Ruxue said.

“What’s this?” Jian Wushuang looked at it curiously. He got along with Leng Ruxue during his month-long stay in the Nature Residence, so he had no longer had any prejudice or dissatisfaction with these sisters.

“You will understand,” Leng Ruxue said and smiled.

Jian Wushuang shrugged, then he folded his hands, bowed, and said, “See you.”

Afterwards, Jian Wushuang quickly disappeared in the void out of the woods.

Leng Ruxue returned to the woods and went to Leng Rushuang.

“Hehe, sister, you played the Nature Melody for a whole month, and you even played the Icy Heart Melody once. Many supreme experts have offered a high price, but they didn’t even get to hear it once.”

Leng Ruxue smiled lightly, then asked in a joking voice, “Are you interested in him?”

“You’re thinking too much.” Leng Rushuang glanced at Leng Ruxue and then coldly said, “He has a special Cultivation Method that can devour my Icy Heart Force. He is the first person to be able to do that. I might need his help to control the Icy Heart Poison in my body one day. That’s why I helped him.”
