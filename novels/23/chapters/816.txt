Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Everyone in the audience looked at Jian Wushuang with pity.

In their opinion, if Jian Wushuang fought with Xia Yan, there was no doubt that he would die.

“Come on. Release all your strength or you’ll have no chance,” Xia Yan looked at Jian Wushuang nonchalantly, as if he was looking at an ant.

“Of course, if that’s what you want,” Jian Wushuang replied casually.

Then, the Emperor Sword instantly appeared in his hand and he swung it at Xia Yan from a distance.

Immediately, a huge sword shadow rushed forward to strike Xia Yan.

However, they were too far apart and the blow was so slow that any of these powerful Divine Realm experts could avoid it. As for Xia Yan, it was a piece of cake.

“What is he doing?”

“Did he realize that he will be killed in an instant, so he gave up and has decided to put on a show?”

“Something isn’t right. Even I could avoid that blow.”

Many warriors in the audience were talking.

And, as they expected, when the sword shadow reached Xia Yan, he easily avoided it with a slight move.

“You really are just an ant.”

Xia Yan smiled contemptuously and moved near Jian Wushuang in an instant. Then, a dark blade light swept out.

The blade light moved surprisingly fast.

Both Zong Yuan and Mo Ling had been killed by this same blade light.

At such a sight, many people in the audience secretly sighed.

But just as the blade light was about to strike Jian Wushuang…

Clang!

A mysterious sword shadow silently appeared and blocked the incoming saber just in time.

“What?” Xia Yan looked up in wonder.

“What?”

“He fended off Xia Yan’s attack!”

It caused profound astonishment among the audience.

They saw Jian Wushuang swing his sword and block Xia Yan’s saber.

“That’s interesting.”

Xia Yan’s mouth curved into a thin smile, but his eyes were exceptionally cold. His wrist moved and he continued attacking Jian Wushuang with his dark, chilly saber. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Three saber shadows with icy lights shot at Jian Wushuang’s throat, heart, and forehead.

These three saber shadows were not very powerful, but they were remarkably fast.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The three saber shadows were all blocked as well.

“How can he keep up with my speed?”

Xia Yan was baffled, but he sniffed in a dismissive way. Suddenly, he raised the dark, chilly saber and an overwhelming power swiftly condensed in it.

Whoosh!

The blade light shot out in a twinkling.

Xia Yan’s previous attacks were fast, but the power they carried was very ordinary. However, this blow contained a vast power.

Jian Wushuang also raised his sword to block that blow immediately.

Bang!

He blocked it.

But the terrifying power behind that blow landed on Jian Wushuang like a great mountain. It instantly knocked him down, causing him to fall down and strike the arena.

A huge pit appeared on the arena, and the smoke billowed.

Looking towards Jian Wushuang, who was still inside the huge pit, Xia Yan sniffed disdainfully and said, “This Divine Realm expert is not bad, but he still lost in the end.” Then he turned to leave.

Everyone in the audience watched Xia Yan in awe.

“Xia Yan really is exceptionally formidable.”

“In all three fights, his opponents were all some of the strongest Divine Realm experts, but in the end, he won easily.”

“No wonder he dared to say he would fight against all three opponents at once. Now, it seems that even if the three Divine Realm experts joined forces, they would not be able to compete with him for 15 minutes.”

Sentences of praise for Xia Yan came from all directions.

Xia Yan could actually hear the people talking about how amazing his strength was, but he still wore an indifferent, graceful look, pretending not to care. However, he was extremely happy on the inside.

He enjoyed the feeling of being admired by so many people.

It made him very delighted and pleased.

In a jolly mood, Xia Yan walked to the edge of the arena. Then, he looked at Lin Wan and said, “Miss Wan’er… ”

However, he was suddenly interrupted by the sound of the ground breaking and a little stone that looked like a flowing light flying directly towards his head.

Xia Yan’s face darkened and his aura rose, immediately smashing the little stone into powder. Then he turned to look back.

He saw that Jian Wushuang had risen from the huge pit and was brushing the dust from his clothes in a cold manner.

Xia Yan’s face instantly became stiff.

“He didn’t die! And he isn’t even hurt much.”

Xia Yan was startled by what he saw.

The blow that Jian Wushuang faced carried so much power that even an expert at Step Four of the Eternal Realm would not be unscathed if the expert was hit head-on by it.

“How come he’s not hurt?”

“He is not hurt, and his aura did not even weaken a bit!”

“The…”

Many warriors in the audience also turned their eyes towards Jian Wushuang.

They were totally shocked.

Only the Lord of Cercis Island, the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master, and Yang Zaixuan looked the same as before

On the arena, Jian Wushuang gazed at Xia Yan with an expressionless face. “Xia Yan, I heard you are called the number one Divine Realm expert of the Eternal World, aren’t you?” he asked freezingly.

“Yes, what about it?” Xia Yan said and gazed back at Jian Wushuang with a look of disdain still on his face.

The corners of Jian Wushuang’s mouth lifted as he coldly said, “Nothing, I just want to tell you that if you only have this much strength, that title will be mine after today.”

Jian Wushuang said these words in a casual manner, but most of the warriors in the Blood Battle Arena were startled and stared at him in wide-eyed shock.

“The title of the number one Divine Realm expert will belong to him?”

“What does that mean?”?they wondered.

“Haha, well, I’d like to see how you will take it away from me,” Xia Yan replied, then his face had become grave. Apparently, he was completely vexed by Jian Wushuang.

“You’ll see soon enough.”

With that, Jian Wushuang grasped the Emperor Sword even tighter and activated his Bloodline Power.

His body began to bulge as it grew at an amazing rate.

At the same time, his aura soared.

Under the gaze of countless openmouthed warriors, he became a 15 meter tall Gold-armored Ancient God in about a minute.

Along with his body, his Emperor Sword had also enlarged and turned into a sword that was 10 meters long.
