Chapter 663: Comprehension

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the Eternal World, a man could have two, three, or even more Masters. The more Masters the better, as long as his Masters could help him with his cultivation.

But Jian Wushuang was different.

He came from the Ancient World, where a Warrior usually had only one Master or two Masters at most. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The relationship between the master and disciple was very important.

After all, as a Warrior’s strength grew stronger and stronger, many of his relatives and friends would gradually grow old and die. The ones who could still accompany him were usually his disciples or Masters.

Therefore, he would not choose a Master easily.

“Both Palace Master Baiyu and Mo Tao have extremely high comprehension of the Dao and they’re definitely qualified to be my Masters. However, I have no knowledge of their personalities,”?Jian Wushuang shook his head while pondering.

In the whole Ancient Sect, the only person he admired both in strength and personality wasXuan Yi.

Therefore, the only Master he wanted to accept was Xuan Yi.

He did not care if other people thought he was arrogant or conceited.

As for the condition to become Xuan Yi’s disciple, it might be impossible for other people to completely comprehend the three sword scars, but not for Jian Wushuang.

He possessed the Strongest Sword Soul and heaven-defying talent in Sword Principle. In addition, he had reached the Heaven-treading Realm, which meant his comprehension ability was currently at its highest. He was sure that he could fully comprehend the three sword scars.

“The first sword scar contains nine sword movements, while the second one... looks identical with the first one, but it actually contains three sword movements that originate from those nine sword movements...”

The three sword scars were extremely enigmatic.

The nine sword movements in the first sword scar alone were extremely profound.

For example, Zhu Lie, who had a certain level of talent in Sword Principle, still spent more than 10 years on the first sword scar before he fully comprehended the nine sword movements.

However, no one knew that Jian Wushuang had fully comprehended them in two months.

Jian Wushuang had thoroughly comprehended the first sword scar.

It took Zhu Lie more than ten years to do it, but Jian Wushuang succeeded in only two months.

He had already started meditating on the second sword scar.

Jian Wushuang insisted on his belief and goal, continuing to cultivate while relying on his Strongest Sword Soul and supreme talent that had been endowed to him by the Heaven-treading Realm and the Heavenly Creation Skill.

Time flew.

No matter what the disciples in the Ancient Sect said about him, Jian Wushuang still cultivated and meditated alone.

Half a year had elapsed since Jian Wushuang first entered the Ancient Sect.

In front of the dark stone tablet at the Sword Tower, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes which were sparkling with surprise.

“I finally succeeded!”

In the past six months, he had spent most of his time meditating in front of the Sword Tower. Four months ago, he had already fully comprehended the first sword scar.

The second sword scar should be far more difficult to comprehend than the first one for ordinary experts. But Jian Wushuang had reached the Heaven-treading Realm and had a terrifying level of talent in comprehension.

Four months!

Four months after Jian Wushuang fully comprehended the first sword scar, he had also completely comprehended the second one.

“Palace Master Xuan Yi will give a lecture in the Sword Tower two days from now. It’s a good time for me to have finished comprehending the second sword scar,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and then turned to inspect the third sword scar.

The last sword scar.

“This sword scar...” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

He thought the three sword scars were exactly the same half a year ago. However, after he comprehended the first one, he felt the second and third were different.

The second sword scar contained three sword movements that originated from the nine movements in the first one.

The third sword scar contained one sword movement which was the integration of the nine sword movements.

So, naturally, the third sword scar was the most difficult.

“It took me half a year to fully comprehend the first and second sword scar. I wonder how long it’ll take me to comprehend the third one,”?Jian Wushuang thought and then continued to meditate.

The next day, a woman with sky blue hair and a beautiful face was sitting on the highest platform in the huge Martial Arts Practice Field of the Sword Palace. Many disciples from the Sword Palace had gathered around her and were listening carefully to her lecture.

This Absolute Beauty was the second Vice Palace Master of Sword Palace, Ling Yu.

When Jian Wushuang first came to the Ancient Sect half a year ago, Ling Yu also expressed her wish to accept Jian Wushuang as her personal disciple, but she was rejected by Jian Wushuang.

Ling Yu quickly finished her lecture and was about to leave when Jian Wushuang stood up.

“Vice Palace Master,” Jian Wushuang appeared in front of Ling Yu and bowed slightly.

“Jian Wushuang,” Ling Yu glanced at him, her beautiful eyebrows slighting raising.

She had been shocked by Jian Wushuang’s talent. However, Jian Wushuang had not chosen a Master from the Ancient Sect even now, so he had been pegged as being proud and conceited. Many experts, including her, were disappointed with him.

“If Jian Wushuang had chosen me, Palace Master Baiyu, or Palace Master Mo Tao as his Master, he would have already reached a new level. Nevertheless, he chose to cultivate by himself. It’s unlikely that he’ll make great progress during this period of time. It can be said that he wasted half a year,”?Ling Yu thought, shaking her head slightly.

Although it was a pity, she would not force him to change his mind.

Everyone had to make their own choices and follow their own path in life. Since Jian Wushuang chose to refuse the offer of her and the other experts, they would not insist no matter how talented he was.

“Jian Wushuang, what can I do for you?” Ling Yu asked.

“Well, I’ve been meditating on the three sword scars left by Palace Master Xuan Yi and I had some comprehensions yesterday,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Oh?” Ling Yu raised her eyebrows.

The Sword Palace disciples on the Martial Arts Practice Field turned to Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“Some comprehensions?”

“Has he fully comprehended the first sword scar in just half a year?”

“Impossible. The three sword scars left by Palace Master Xuan Yi are so enigmatic. Even the nine sword movements contained in the first sword scar are so profound. Even though Jian Wushuang has an extremely high gift in Sword Principle, it’s impossible for him to fully comprehend the first sword scar in half a year.”

“I’ve been meditating on the first sword scar for nearly 20 years and have only just mastered the seventh sword movement. Did he expect to comprehend the nine sword movements in half a year? He must be joking.”
