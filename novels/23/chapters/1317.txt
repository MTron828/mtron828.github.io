Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Fire test!

It was a complete fire test!

The moment it took shape, everyone on the scene was shaken!

Jian Wushuang’s expression looked extremely solemn.

He watched as the fire test slowly descended.

Vroom!

The terrifying flame suddenly swept out from Jian Wushuang’s body. Suddenly, the universe became a scarlet fire sea.

Jian Wushuang stood right at the core of the scarlet fire sea. The scarlet flame submitted to him and he was the king of the scarlet fire sea.

“That is… Scarlet Kingdom?”

“It’s Scarlet Kingdom, the secret skill that the Island of Secret Island gained fame with!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“The Master of Scarlet Island passed down Scarlet Kingdom to him?”

Many experts that recognized the scarlet fire sea couldn’t help but gasp.

Scarlet Kingdom was quite famous in the Dayu World.

The Master of Scarlet Island swept over Dayu World with the secret skill and he was all and might among Universe Gods in the Second Heaven.

Then, Jian Wushuang learned the secret skill and he performed the secret skill as he underwent God’s Test. He used the scarlet fire sea to fight against the horrifying fire test that was descending from the void above.

“Come on!”

Jian Wushuang gripped Blood Mountain Sword in his hand tightly as he bellowed. The scarlet fire sea surged as though it too was roaring in anger and giving vent to its unhappiness.

The next moment, he held the handle of Blood Mountain Sword with both of his hands.

A surging sword aura that made people hold their breath was given out from Jian Wushuang’s body.

The Blood Mountain Sword was also trembling in rage.

“After I cultivated in seclusion for a century, I accumulated swordsmanship through resolving the Little Scattered Stars Game and spent another dozen of years to constantly digest and understand. Then, I finally created the stroke technique!”

“I created this stroke technique specifically for the Inverse Cultivation Test!”

“It is born to fight the test and it exists to resolve the test!”

“It’s name… is Test Wrecker!!!”

Jian Wushuang mumbled. The moment he finished talking, an unprecedented brightness flashed from his eyes.

He gripped his Blood Mountain Sword tightly as he waved it without hesitation.

“Buzz!!!”

A cold, ear-piercing noise was heard across the universe.

It was extremely shrill, as though someone were roaring hysterically.

A cold sword light that was eye-catching suddenly lit up.

“That is…”

“A rank two unique skill?”

The experts outside Tribunal Passing Pinnacle stared.

The sword light appeared and was followed by dark whirlpool forming around it. There was an unprecedented rage and determination along with Jian Wushuang’s billowing fighting spirit and unhappiness!

Surrounded by the scarlet fire sea, it suddenly collided with the emerald green fire test descending from the sky above.

Poof!

There wasn’t the clashing noise that they imagined there’d be, nor was there any terrifying pressure that spread around.

The moment the two collided, it started melting at a terrifying speed.

The boundless emerald green flame burned everything mercilessly. The sword technique that Jian Wushuang performed earlier was extremely fierce, and it was the strongest stroke he had performed as of then. It was a full force stroke with the assistance of Scarlet Kingdom!

However, he was facing a real fire test.

Among the three God’s Test, the fire test was in second place. Its scary level wasn’t comparable to thunder test.

Looking at the cold sword light melting at a shocking speed, it disappeared entirely very soon. However, the divine lightning that was formed with emerald green flame had parts of its power left and it surged towards Jian Wushuang.

Vroom!

The emerald green flame came into contact with Blood-killing Plate Armor and suddenly started burning crazily.

Even though it was separated by the Blood-killing Plate Armor, Jian Wushuang could still feel the blood all over his body and all his organs were burning altogether.

“Humph!”

A coolness grew, and the Soul Power in Jian Wushuang’s body spurted out and wrapped around the emerald green flame on the surface of his body.

Poof poof poof!!!

An enormous amount of Soul Power was burning mercilessly, but the emerald green flame gradually slowed down.

“Wow!”

Jian Wushuang suddenly spat two mouthfuls of blood. His face grew pale and his body started quivering. He looked like he couldn’t stand straight on his feet.

But the very next moment, he lifted his head.

He could clearly feel that the thundercloud in the void above had started brewing again.

The movement of brewing was much bigger than the previous eight times of divine lightning.

“Is it the last strike?”

Jian Wushuang’s pupil contracted and he waved his hand directly to wipe away the blood on the corner of his lips. Then, he stood straight.

Even though his divine body was severely damaged under the eight strikes of divine lightning and he couldn’t stand firmly, he was still standing proudly.

He, from when he was born till now, no matter what kind of danger or hardship he faced, he… Never backed off!

Such firmness and determination, that’s Jian Wushuang!!!

Looking at the thundercloud’s transformation, everyone outside of Tribunal Passing Pinnacle was stirred.

“There’s a ninth strike?”

“There’s one last one!”

“This is the last test!”

Everyone gripped their fist and they were shouting at the bottom of their heart.

They were glad, glad that they didn’t come across such terrifying God’s Test.

At the same time, they were also looking forward, looking forward to Jian Wushuan who had created a lot of miracles in the God’s test to create another miracle in order to cross the last move.

“The last divine lightning, it should be the strongest strike!” The Master of Dayu Palace too clenched his fist as his eyes beamed with excitement.

“The first God Test and he encounters a total of nine bolts of divine lightning. This is unbelievable. If he were to die at the last divine lightning, it ends here. However, if he were to pass this, his achievement after this would be unpredictable!!!” Wu Cang clenched his teeth and thought excitedly.

“Jian Wushuang, one last one! You must pass this last move no matter what!” King of Venomous Worms who was hiding deep in the ground was watching Jian Wushuang all this while. He was also cheering him up at that very moment.

“Pass it!”

“It’s the last, don’t give up!”

“You can do it!”

The experts surrounding Tribunal Passing Pinnacle started cheering for Jian Wushuang in their heart too.

The God’s Test that day sent all the spectators to astonishment.

Jian Wushuang revealed his capability and stubbornness in the God’s Test, and he turned people around. Even Universe God Jiu Hai and the Master of Golden-sun Sect, who harbored deep-seated grudges against Jian Wushuang, were impressed with Jian Wushuang performance in the God’s Test, even though they wanted Jian Wushuang to die in the God’s Test.

On the peak of Tribunal Passing Pinnacle, Jian Wushuang lifted his head to look at the sky above. His body trembled faintly and he felt every living thing in the universe was cheering for him.

The last bolt of divine lightning!”

“Life or death relies on this move!”
