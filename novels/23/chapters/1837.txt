Chapter 1838: The Last Person

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Hunting power…

It was true that Jian Wushuang’s Hong Jung Golden Sword and Moon Picking Skill were closely related to Spacetime Doctrine.

As for Spacetime Doctrine, speed was the most impressive factor. Jian Wushuang relied on the two techniques. As soon as he suppressed his enemy, it would be very difficult for them to flee.

Although Emperor God Liu Guang and the Master of Star Palace were powerful, they would need to put in a lot of effort to kill a powerful Emperor God. Besides, they might let their enemy flee. They were definitely not as relaxed as Jian Wushuang.

The moment Emperor God Bing Can died, Jian Wushuang was free. Then… Jian Wushuang turned to look at the eleven Sir Gods at the side.

The eleven Sir Gods were fighting ferociously with Emperor God Jiu Ying and the four silver-armored Dao soldiers.

Along with Jian Wushuang’s flash of murderous intention, the three Hong Jun Golden Swords instantly became three resplendent golden light under his control. Then, they flew in three different directions simultaneously.

Suddenly, the three Hong Jun Golden Swords appeared behind three different Sir Gods.

“No!”

“This…”

“D*mn it!”

The three Sir Gods’ faces changed. Some of them were fighting with Emperor God Jiu Yin together, some were fighting with the silver-armored Dao soldiers. However, Jian Wushuang’s Hong Jun Golden Sword suddenly flew at them and didn’t give them any chance to struggle.

The three Hong Jun Golden Sword instantly pierced two bodies.

Although there was one who responded in time and blocked the attack, Hong Jun Golden Sword contained the power of a Peak Emperor God. The moment he collided with the sword, the Sir God got severely injured while the Hong Jun Golden Sword only quivered slightly and continued its attack. It pierced the person’s head.

In the blink of an eye, the three Sir Gods were killed.

“My goodness!”

“Too scary!”

“We can’t resist the golden swords!”

“Run, hurry up and run!”

The remaining Sir Gods were terrified and they started running away.

They were originally forced to team up in order to defend their lives. However, dealing with Jian Wushuang’s crushing power and his terrifying massacre pattern, they were shivering in fear. It had only been a short while since the explosion of the war but Sir God Tian Can and three Sir Gods had died.

At first, the team formation that could fight for a while suddenly had a great disparity in power. Plus, there was Jian Wushuang who was a killing machine.

They had already lost their courage to continue the fight.

However, although they wanted to run away, they would require Jian Wushuang’s permission.

Jian Wushuang flipped his hand and there was a purple pearl that gave out a unique aura that appeared in his hand. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

It was a One Realm Pearl.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang moved with his willpower and boundless purple energy swept out from the One Realm Pearl. It instantly covered the surrounding void of a few million miles. The Sir Gods who were ready to run were engulfed within.

One Realm Pearl, turned into a formation with one willpower.

“Today, none of you shall escape.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice that contained shocking murderous intention reverberated in the few million miles void engulfed in the formation.

The remaining eight Sir Gods saw that their ways were blocked and they panicked. Such fear and shock turned into madness in a short period of time.

“I will fight all out with him!”

“Even if I die, I won’t let him leave in peace.”

“Die! Die! Die!”

The eight Sir Gods’ faces were distorted. They instantly turned around and charged at Jian Wushuang.

Among them were a few that had billowing energy. Some were churning with magical clouds. There were two Sir Gods who had consumed a few elixirs and their auras had increased tremendously.

It was obvious that the eight Sir Gods were going all-out.

It could be called a last chance. It could also be called a desperate fight of a cornered beast.

Looking at the Eight Sir Gods’ faces, they were cold and fearless.

“Emperor God Jiu Yin, let’s do this!”

Jian Wushuang said coldly, then the three Hong Jun Golden Swords flew out first. Then, he took a huge leap and drew out Blood Mountain Sword.

Blood Mountain Sword that already transformed into Chaotic Divine Treasure displayed terrifying sword intention that could shake the universe.

“Even when eleven Sir Gods team up, there was nothing and you wanted to struggle when there are only eight of you?”

“Die!”

Emperor God Jiu Yin smirked coldly and his figure turned ghostly as he flashed here and there.

The four silver-armored Dao soldiers followed.

The experts from both parties instantly fought.

The battle ended very quickly. In a short while, the eight Sir Gods were killed.

Among the eight Sir Gods, there were six who were killed by the three Hong Jun Golden Swords.

“Sword Emperor, your golden sword is really scary.”

Emperor God Jiu Ying looked at the three Hong Jun Golden Sword floating around Jian Wushuang and he looked reverent.

The fear of the three Hong Jun Golden Sword’s was seen in his eyes. It would have been okay if there was only one. However, the combination of three, he couldn’t resist. If he were to fight with Jian Wushuang, he could only opt for fleeing. As for he could escape, that would depend on his luck.

“Emperor God Tian Can and all the Sir Gods were killed. Now, there is only one person left,” Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold as he looked to the other side of the battlefield.

On the battlefield, Emperor God Liu Guang were fighting ferociously with Fortress Master Hong Tian.

Of course, Emperor God Liu Guang definitely had the upper hand and she suppressed Fortress Master Hong Tian.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang and Emperor God Jiu Yin’s body appeared on the battlefield.

The two people who were fighting instantly stopped.

Fortress Master Hong Tian was holding a huge axe in each hand and there was rage soaring from his body. However, his face didn’t look good.

He had never expected the total of twelve Almighties, including Emperor God Tian Can. Such a great formation would be massacred by Jian Wushuang in such a short time.

Jian Wushuang’s power was much stronger than he had imagined.

While the Almighties at his side had been killed while Jian Wushuang, Emperor God Liu Guang and Emperor God Jiu Yin had maintained their full fighting force. If the three Emperor Gods were to team up…

“I’m in big trouble!”

Fortress Master Hong Tian felt an intense danger.

“Fortress Master Hong Tian, like I said, I will come to Deluge Fortress and kill all thirteen of you. I never go back on my words,” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold.

Fortress Master Hong Tian’s face grew in distress. He glanced at Jian Wushuang and suddenly said solemnly, “Jian Wushuang, if I were to swear now that I would stay at the border of Eternal Chaotic World from today, and as long as Lineage of Star is there, I will never step foot in the ten sanctuaries, would you be willing to let me go?”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang smirked and said, “If it was on Thunderbolt Island and you said so before every expert of Sanctuary Alliance, I would consider it. But now… It’s too late!”
