The Temporal Temple also had reinforcements. They were the 10-man team of Master Lin Guang, who had just returned to the Divine Beginning Realm and had been exploring the universe battlefield.

After receiving the message from Temple Master Bai Xing, Master Lin Guang rushed to the Saha Island as fast as he could.

While the battle was still in its climax, Jian Wushuang had stopped the Nine-tailed Clan members with the help of Asura Demon God. Lin Guang Master’s ten-man team finally arrived at the battlefield.

This ten-man team had been to the universe battlefield before. The universe battlefield was so dangerous that ordinary Principles Masters did not dare to go there. Only Principles Masters who had reached the third realm of the Void Realm dared to go there, only when they formed a team with others would they dare to go to the universe battlefield.

Thus, Lin Guang Master’s 10-man team was generally made up of Principles Masters who had reached the third level of the Void Realm and above. There were also three who had reached the fourth level of the Void Realm, especially Lin Guang Master, who was in the lead. His strength was not any weaker than Ba Cang’s, he was an expert of the fifth level of the Void Realm.

The appearance of the ten-man team on the battlefield changed the situation once again.

After Jian Wushuang’s Asura Demon God’s power was completely exhausted, Lin Guang Master and the other two Principles Masters of the fourth realm of the void came to him.

“Little guy, go to the back. Leave the Nine-tailed Clan to us,” Lin Guang Master, who had silver hair and a graceful figure, said gently.

“Thank you, Master Lin Guang.” Jian Wushuang nodded gratefully and immediately retreated.

“Where do you think you’re going?” Da Yu and Da Su of the Nine-tail Clan looked grim. They were about to give chase...

“Haha, your opponents are us,” Master Lin Guang laughed. Two other experts of the void fourth realm from his team followed him. Although there were only three of them...they were able to easily stop the nine-tailed Principles Master of the nine-tailed race.

No matter what methods the nine-tailed race used, they were unable to get rid of Lin Guang Master and the other two.

On the other battlefield, the intense battle between Star River Master and Bai Xing Hall Master was nearing its end.

“Scram!”

With a low shout, Bai Xing Hall master clapped his hands. Space-time, fire, and earth — three types of principle energy stirred wildly at this moment, condensing into a three-colored phoenix in the blink of an eye, this three-colored phoenix did not emit the slightest bit of power. This was the perfect embodiment of Palace Master Bai Xing’s control over all his energy.

After which, this three-colored phoenix opened its mouth and directly collided with the Star River Master in front of it.

This collision shattered the boundless darkness where Star River Master was. A muffled groan suddenly sounded in the boundless darkness. Immediately after, Star River Master’s somewhat miserable figure shot out from the boundless darkness.

After a long while, the Star River Lord’s figure finally regained his footing. His face also carried a trace of paleness as he gritted his teeth and stared fixedly at the Bai Xing Hall Master, “Star River, you’re really something. After all these years, although your fighting style is still the same as before, your use of the rules has risen to a higher level than before. In particular, you’ve also made a new breakthrough in your ultimate move. You’re really something.”

“Hmph, do you think that after all these years, I really haven’t improved at all?” Palace Master Bai Xing sneered.

Many years ago, she had fought with Star River Master. At that time, she had just broken through to the sixth level of the void, but she had relied on her advantage in terms of realm to forcefully suppress Star River Master. And after so many years...Star River Master had also broken through to the sixth level of the void, but her strength had also increased quite a bit. It was just that she had not shown it at the beginning.

“With Heavenly Sword Marquis’ spacetime world and Elder Dark Bone rushing over to help, now that Lin Guang Master’s ten-man team has also arrived at the battlefield, just their current combat strength alone is enough to deal with the three great Saint Realms, the Sorcerer God Sect, and the Nine-tailed Clan. It Won’t be long before those four old fellows from Quiet Moon Abyss also arrive at the battlefield. When that time comes, the overall situation will be set! Temple Master Bai Xing clenched his fists.

The Temporal Temple was at an absolute disadvantage in this battle.

After all, they were fighting against the three Saint Realms at the same time, so their battle strength was not proportional to each other at the beginning.

However, Jian Wushuang had a universe supreme treasure like the Mountain River Map in his hands, and he could also use the spacetime world. When the spacetime world appeared, it was comparable to the battle strength of more than a dozen Principles Masters, which equaled the battle strength of both sides.

Then, Elder Dark Bone appeared, and Jian Wushuang’s own trump card was also very powerful. The three Saint Realms were unable to kill him at the first moment until now. Lin Guang Master’s team had arrived, now, if the three Saint Realms did not have any other backup plans, then the spacetime temple was already confident of victory in this battle.

“Galaxy, it seems that this time, the three Saint Realms will return empty-handed.” Temple Master Bai Xing sneered and stared at Galaxy Master.

“Hmph, the battle isn’t over yet. That Heavenly Sword Marquis is still trapped by us. Isn’t it too early for you to say this?” Star River Master snorted.

“Oh, is that so?” Palace Master Bai Xing suddenly gave a strange smile. She had already received the message that the four masters of Tranquil Moon Abyss had arrived!

Hu!

A gust of violent wind suddenly swept across the battlefield.

The violent wind swept across, containing a majestic power. It actually directly blew the weaker Principles Masters on the battlefield to the side.

Even the stronger Principles Masters were only barely able to stand firm under the violent wind.

The violent wind swept across the entire battlefield, causing the fierce battle between the two camps to stop. Only then did the violent wind slowly calm down.

After the violent wind calmed down, everyone immediately looked over, only to discover that four more figures had appeared in the middle of the battlefield. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

These four figures were from left to right. The first was a short hunchbacked old man. This hunchbacked old man’s gaze was cold, and there was a cold smile at the corner of his mouth. His body was also surrounded by a strange layer of black fog, the black fog also emitted a stench that made people shudder.

The second person had white hair and white eyebrows. His eyebrows were extremely long, and they were so long that they reached his chin. His eyes were very small, and his gaze was turbid. His expression was also extremely cold as if he did not care about anything in his surroundings at all. What was worth noting was that...there was a dark red dot between his brows. This dark red dot seemed to contain an endless divine might.

The third person looked like a child. He was about the size of a child and looked about the same as an eight or nine-year-old child. His skin was fair and his hair was tied into a small braid. On his chubby face, there was a playful smile, his gaze swept across the crowd with incomparable craftiness. Anyone who was swept by his gaze felt as if they were being targeted by a devil.

The last person was an old woman wearing a silver robe and holding a walking stick with the head of a snake. This old woman’s body was covered with traces of hiding.. Her body was also filled with a deathly aura, as though she could die at any moment.
