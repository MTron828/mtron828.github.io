When he was captured, he initially thought the other party would kill him directly, but he didn‚Äôt expect this old guy to actually want to take over his body.

His Dao was a unique Extreme Dao; even if the other party was an unparalleled powerhouse, they couldn‚Äôt possess him. In the end, due to a twist of fate, they merged into one.

He had no choice but to swear an oath, temporarily sharing a body.

But this was not a long-term solution.

Bai Junwang wanted to reforge an origin source that didn‚Äôt belong to the Qishen Temple, aiming to cultivate back to the tier 6 Emperor.

Now, Jian Wushuang, in the Earthly Realm, was conducting a ritual to forge the origin source for the other party.

Just a little more was needed. As long as he helped Bai Junwang refine a new origin source, the other party could separate from his body.

If they violated the oath, both of them would witness the collapse of the Great Dao.

Originally, he was accustomed to this kind of life, but now, seeing Hu Qing, he also wanted to join those inheritors in their journey to the Grave God

Mountain.

That place was his holy land for cultivation, with endless resources.

Moreover, the old man with the goat horns had promised to forge a Divine Beast Weapon for him. The other party probably already thought he had perished.

Bai Junwangs eyes moved, comforting him in a low voice, ‚ÄúJian Wushuang, don‚Äôt be sad. As long as you follow the great divine spirit, I guarantee that your cultivation speed will be much faster than those so-called inheritors.‚Äù

This statement was not empty. Although he had been busy with blood sacrifices for a thousand years, his cultivation had not lagged behind.

In the Earthly Realm, he was the young master of a mysterious organization called ‚ÄòKui‚Äô. The divine spirit had promised him that once he broke through to Emperor, he could become the leader of the Kui organization, controlling the earthly realm.

This hidden force in the shadows was extremely powerful.

Just one of the branches that Jian Wushuang knew of had two tier 6 Emperors presiding over it, one in the light and one in the dark.

In the light, it was an ancient sect, while in the shadows, it stirred the winds and clouds, collaborating with surrounding forces to clear out the Qishen Temple.

In the Earthly Realm, the Qishen Temple sat in Tianzhou, the central core of the entire continent.

The other regions ‚Äì Tiannan, Tianbei, Dongyu, and Xiyu ‚Äì were all in chaos, and if the Qishen Temple came over, they would be driven away.

The position of the young master in the Kui organization was very high, surpassing ordinary Emperors and comparable to a tier 4 Emperor.

Confirming identity mainly relies on the token. The token in Jian Wushuang‚Äôs hand is a third-grade token.

Usually, only a tier 4 Emperor who has made significant contributions can

obtain this token. A tier 5 Emperor gets a second- grade token, and a tier 6

Emperor gets a first-grade token.

There is also the legendary super-first-grade, and Bai Junwang once belonged to that level.

With this third-grade token, Jian Wushuang can contact Emperors and Dao Lords in any region he goes to, and powerful beings will come to his aid.

This blood sacrifice is initiated by the Kui organization within the ancient Great Xia Kingdom.

‚ÄúA second-grade elder is summoning you; your treasures have arrived!‚Äù Bai Junwang reminded.

Jian Wushuang didn‚Äôt reply, transforming into the deceased Ninth Prince of

Great Xia.

At the same time, in the ancestral temple of Great Xia, the Emperor responsible for guarding the soul lamps saw the ninth soul lamp at the top light up again and breathed a sigh of relief.

Some places can conceal soul lamps. At first, he thought the Ninth Prince had fallen, almost going to report. Fortunately, there is a rule: report only after the soul lamp has been extinguished for a quarter of an hour.

Transformed into the Ninth Prince of Great Xia, Jian Wushuang disappeared like a phantom, heading towards the imperial capital of Great Xia.

In Great Xia, on this continent‚Äôs southern land, it is considered a super dynasty. The first Divine Emperor who founded the country was a sixth-rank Emperor, now retired and in seclusion.

The current Emperor of Great Xia is a young tier 5 Emperor, with average strength and potential but remarkable governing skills.

Within the Great Xia clans, everyone respects him. Apart from this Emperor, there are also ancestors and several elders, all of whom are tier 5 Emperors.

If they cannot gain support, they are just puppets.

Imperial City of Great Xia.

This super city is like a giant beast lying on the earth.

16 city gates are wide open, with billions of people entering and leaving every day.

With so many powerful individuals gathered, the capital naturally thrives and bustles.

Especially the places for entertainment for these powerful beings.

There are many crazy cultivators in the realm, and even more lazy cultivators.

Under the shadow of his father‚Äôs influence, it was challenging for him to grow, especially in this city filled with numerous temptations.

East City.

The most prosperous and lively place.

Jian Wushuang used the identity of the Ninth Prince, ‚ÄòXia Mang Guanyu‚Äô, to arrive in the capital. Though conspicuous, he kept a deep concealment, a true master of hiding within the court.

The benefits of his transcendent physique were not only in its strength but also in the various means it offered for transformation.

In the Shangqing Palace, he had witnessed Broly, who practiced the art of transformation, growing stronger with each change. Jian Wushuang, on the other hand, could mimic anything he wanted. Now disguised as the Ninth Prince, even the founding Divine Emperor couldn‚Äôt perceive him unless scrutinizing his origin source.

For an ordinary tier 5 Emperor, let alone recognizing his origin source, it would be challenging even to detect any difference in his appearance. Imitating the memory of Xia Mang Guanyu, he swaggered into the capital. In less than 15 minutes, a group of palace guards arrived, surrounding and escorting him.

Having devoured the memories of the Ninth Prince, Jian Wushuang knew that, while the Prince‚Äôs mother wasn‚Äôt the empress, her background was extraordinary. She came from a prominent family‚Äîher father was a powerful tier 5 Emperor, and several uncles were tier 4 Emperors, making their influence strong in both court and society.

Moreover, his mother herself was at the peak of the tier 4, making her the strongest in the harem. With only one son, Xia Mang Guanyu had grown up unrestrained and fearless.

Unfortunately, he had crossed paths with Jian Wushuang this time.

Completing the clan trial in a remote county, Xia Mang Guanyu‚Äôs trial was thwarted by Jian Wushuang, who seized the opportunity.

Jian Wushuang cared little for the intricacies of these tangled forces. If necessary, it would take only a bit of time to wipe out the entire Great Xia, but there was no need, nor time, for such a boring endeavor.

‚ÄúYour Highness, are we heading to the Foxfire Palace? Should I have the Firefox Immortal arrange things beforehand?‚Äù asked the leader of the guards, also his close attendant.

The clan trial was brutal, regardless of one‚Äôs status. Everyone had to undergo the trial; failure meant a decline in status, success brought treasures and future support on those treasures.

Supported by his mother and grandfather, Xia Mang Guanyu lacked nothing in treasures.

Even without Jian Wushuangs interference, he would likely have passed the trial. Yet, these unfortunate individuals had their trial location right next to where he was cultivating, and Jian Wushuang took advantage of the situation.

The leader of the guards knew that every time the prince returned from a trial, he would head to the Foxfire Palace to vent his frustrations.Fiind updùíÇted ùíèovels on nùíê/v/elbin(.)co/m

Living in luxury day after day, the real pressure came in life-and-death struggles. Each successful trial required a period of relaxation and unwinding..
