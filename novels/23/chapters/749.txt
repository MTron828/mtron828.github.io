Chapter 750: Secret Assembly Sites

“You!”

“You’re…”

Wu Dao’s eyes widened. He stared unblinkingly at the face before him.

He was too familiar with this face.

A hundred years ago, precisely because of the owner of this face, he had successfully stepped into the Eternal Zone.

“Jian Wushuang!”

Wu Dao growled in a note of disbelief. “No way, no way, how could it be you?”

“You’re supposed to be dead. You should have died a long time ago.”

“How is this possible? How could this be?”

He was at a total loss.

To his shock, this exceptional genius who he thought had already died a hundred years ago was reappearing in front of him today.

And he had become an incredibly powerful expert.

It should be noted that a century earlier, though Jian Wushuang was an exceptional genius, he had been too young to reach any Realms beyond the Skyscraping Realm. At that time, Jian Wushuang might have been able to put up a fight against him by exercising all his skills and means.

But over the past hundred years, Wu Dao had gained a remarkable breakthrough. He had entered the Eternal Realm and crossed the threshold of being an expert.

Once he stepped into the Eternal Realm, his strength soared.

A hundred years ago, Wu Dao had been quite confident that he could kill Jian Wushuang with a casual slap. But now, the Jian Wushuang standing before him had cornered him with invincible strength, leaving him not a single chance to fight back.

He was too powerful.

The strength Jian Wushuang displayed was too powerful!

“He is already at Step Two of the Eternal Realm, perhaps even higher than that.”

“He is merely a Divine Realm expert, how could he be so powerful?”

“And it only took him a hundred years to achieve this?”

Wu Dao mumbled to himself, his eyes growing out of focus.

“Wu Dao, do you still remember when you, Dao Mei, and Long Tao joined hands and attempted to kill me a hundred years ago?”

Jian Wushuang looked down at Wu Dao and asked with cold viciousness. “Back then, I was too weak. I had to resort to the power of the Demon Gods to deal with you guys, mere disciples of Divine Realm experts. But now, it’s different!”

“Think about what the three magnates—the Cloud Sea Asgard, the Immortal Dynasty, and the Boundless Demon Sect—did to me a hundred years ago. Now, I’m going to make them pay for what they did at a cost 10 times or even 100 times higher!”

“And destroying you is just the start.”

“You’re the first. It won’t take long before I send more experts from the Cloud Sea Asgard to keep you company in hell.”

Jian Wushuang shook his hand, and a violent force pressed down on Wu Dao.

Wu Dao had long since lost the ability to resist his attacks. He had no choice but to allow this force to destroy him, to crumble his Life Core and crash his body into dust.

“Ho…ho…” Wu Dao’s eyes were wide-open, filled with terror and rage. Blood was trickling down from the corners of his mouth.

It was unbelievable that the three magnates should have provoked such a dreadful monster in the battle a hundred years ago!

How much he wished he could tip off the three magnates, warning them to dispatch top-ranking experts and do this monster in before he could incur real disasters upon them.

However, he had no chance to do so.

As death descended upon him, Wu Dao caught a vague sight of the kind of outrageous mayhem Jian Wushuang was about to cause in the Tianqi Mountains and the Firmament Territory.

In the beginning, Jian Wushuang’s battle strength had merely scraped the level of a superior Divine Realm expert. But now, just a hundred years later, he was already in the Eternal Realm and could kill anyone as easily as slaying a chicken!

In another century, or two centuries, or a millennium, what kind of Level would he reach?

Unfortunately, since Message Tokens were useless in the Eternal Zone, his words obviously could not be spread.

After destroying Wu Dao, Jian Wushuang picked up the Interspatial Ring that Wu Dao left. His mind racing, he started to rifle through its contents.

A moment later, he found what he was looking for.

He lifted a hand and a token appeared in his palm.

It was the token carrying the records of a map, the map of the Tianqi Mountains.

Just as Jian Wushuang expected, Wu Dao had reached the Eternal Realm not long ago, and this was the first time he had traveled to the Tianqi Mountains. Accordingly, the map he carried was a map of the Tianqi Mountains, on which several of the Cloud Sea Asgard’s secret assembly sites were marked out.

One of the secret assembly sites lay not far from the region where Jian Wushuang was standing. It was actually in the direction that Wu Dao had been heading.

“This Wu Dao looked sort of shabby. Apparently, he just went through a huge fight. I suppose he got separated from the other Cloud Sea Asgard experts. If nothing else, he was going to rejoin them at one of the assembly sites. However, halfway through his journey, he happened to bump into me.” Jian Wushuang gave a cold laugh.

If Wu Dao had been heading for a secret assembly site, that meant other experts were waiting or about to arrive at the assembly site. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

If Jian Wushuang went there, he was likely to run into other experts from the Cloud Sea Asgard.

“Hee hee, the Cloud Sea Asgard!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining with excitement. He stuck out his tongue and licked his lips.

“Well since I figured this one out first, I’ll make it my first target!”

After taking a short break, Jian Wushuang set off straight towards the Cloud Sea Asgard’s secret assembly site.

Two hours later, he arrived at a very ordinary canyon in the Tianqi Mountains.

At first, the canyon had been unnamed. But since the Cloud Sea Asgard had made it one of their secret assembly sites, it was given a name, the Cloud Canyon.

Jian Wushuang did not descend down into the canyon directly from the high Void. Instead, he strode across a forest and came to stand on the top of a stone wall. He gazed down at the canyon, taking in everything.

A black-robed woman was sitting cross-legged on a boulder in the canyon, quietly waiting for someone. She was quite vigilant, casting her eyes on her surroundings from time to time.

Jian Wushuang had never met this woman. She was not one of the ones who had entered the Eternal Zone last time.

But despite the long distance between them, Jian Wushuang could still feel her rich aura. This told him that she was definitely stronger than Wu Dao.

“There are many Ancient God Clansmen in the Tianqi Mountains, and they are all very tough and powerful. If experts from the Cloud Sea Asgard want to take the Baptismal Pool, they’ll have to attack in groups of three or four. Counting this woman and Wu Dao, I’ve only met two of them. So, that means there are more experts coming this way,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

“The woman is alone. I should attack her now! Otherwise, once the others arrive, it’ll be much harder to kill them all.”

“I’d better kill her first, and then stay in the Cloud Canyon and wait for more stupid hares to crash into a tree stump!”

His mind made up, Jian Wushuang’s Emperor Sword emerged in his hand. He slinked towards the canyon without making a sound.
