Chapter 5503 ¬†Perfect Plan

No wonder Zhen Ling insisted on taking him to the Grave God Mountain; it turned out to be for this.

"Once this matter is accomplished, not to mention a complete Origin Source of the Universe, the future of Qishen Temple will be yours!" FOlloow ùíèewest stories at nùíê(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Whether Jian Wushuang believed this statement or not, Wu Zuo truly believed it.

Otherwise, he wouldn't be so ingratiating towards Jian Wushuang, addressing him as a brother and generously gifting him the Universe Origin Source.

A thought flickered in Jian Wushuang's mind. At this moment, whether he hesitated or refused, he had to face it.

This is Qishen Temple!

What could he do here?

Just as Wu Zuo said, the future of Qishen Temple would be him. Fuego, this troublemaker, must be eliminated, or it would not be beneficial to him.

"Alright, I agree!" Jian Wushuang gritted his teeth and said, "Whatever is needed, just say it!"

A smile appeared on Wu Zuo's face. He pulled Jian Wushuang to sit down and continued, "Lord Zhen Ling didn't really mention it, but you can lower your guard and try to let the other party approach you!"

"Let the other party find me?" Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

But he had to go out for that!

In the Elder Palace, even Shen Ling's hands probably couldn't reach this place.

"You should have encountered some difficulties in these days!" Wu Zuo seemed to have anticipated it.

He wasn't a fool. Since Zhen Ling was scheming like this, there were probably some covert actions already in motion.

Now, hearing Wu Zuo's words, Jian Wushuang recalled the events on Fenyang Island.

Externally, it seemed that the Palace Miao Yi he brought along was taken away by the formidable Master, Si Tian. Although he didn't mind, others had already noticed his exclusion and even suppression.

Moreover, he was ridiculed by Si Tian Emperor in a sarcastic manner.

Generally, strong individuals couldn't tolerate such treatment.

This was a good entry point. Jian Wushuang couldn't survive in the Elder Palace, so the Divine Spirits took advantage of the opportunity to infiltrate.

Jian Wushuang didn't say much, just nodded.

He understood!

All of this was probably being manipulated by Zhen Ling.

Over the years, the inheritors in the Four Great Secret Realms were not uncommon, let alone in a place like the Elder Palace.

Even if suppressed, one could only endure.

Who told him that his strength was inferior!

In Jian Wushuang's heart, a plan emerged.

Since that was the case, he might as well turn the tables, especially since Zhen Ling had his back.

Rather than sit idly by, he could take decisive action, eliminate Si Tian, and then betray the Elder Palace.

Stage a bitter plot for Shen Ling.

By then, he could seize Gong Miao Yi, and escape all the way to the extreme north. Even if Shen Ling didn't take the bait, he could still find Nie Yuan.

Simply perfect!

After killing Si Tian, he would also obtain the components of the Beast God Weapon.

The more Jian Wushuang thought about it, the more he felt the perfection of this plan.

Killing just one Si Tian, Zhen Ling wouldn't care at all. Everything was for the greater good.

So, sacrificing one Si Tian was a small price to pay.

Jian Wushuang glanced around, and Wu Zuo understood the implication. Calmly, he said, "Rest assured, the two of us here, no one can overhear!"

Subsequently, Jian Wushuang laid out his entire plan, disclosing it all to Wu Zuo.

Wu Zuo clapped his hands, elated.

"This plan is truly virtuous!"

With his assistance, this plan could proceed flawlessly.

After Jian Wushuang killed Si Tian and severely injured Tie San by making him self-detonate using the Universe Origin Source, he could discreetly take action and eliminate Tie San.

Even if Sword God Chang Feng went to complain to Zhen Ling, it would be suppressed.

Absolutely perfect!

Jian Wushuang eliminated Si Tian; getting rid of Tie San wasn't too much!

Although Tie San's strength was not at the supreme-peak, he was the Hall Master of Longevity Hall, possessing considerable authority, and was also Chang Feng's younger brother.

These two brothers had caused a lot of obstruction in his path to becoming the contender for the Palace Lord position.

Naturally, they had to be eliminated.

After much deliberation, the two of them thoroughly analyzed the plan, devising an escape route.

Escape was easy; he had some connection with Qiuhuang and needed to pull him into the scheme.

Once successful, with Wu Zuo replacing Chang Feng as the Palace Lord, the position of Central Hall's master could be given to Qiuhuang. Moreover, Wu Zuo could also assist him in becoming a tier 6 Emperor.

This advantage needed no further explanation.

Qiuhuang would undoubtedly agree to it.

In the aftermath of being pursued, it was a matter for the Enforcement Hall. At that time, it would all depend on acting skills.

There was just one question: Whose universe origin source exploded?

In the end, Wu Zuo gritted his teeth and decided to handle it himself.

Origin Source self-detonation!

To destroy a Universe Origin Source... Wu Zuo didn't have this type of Origin Source among the ones he possessed.

"This Origin Source, I obtained it in the God's Tomb, a supremely and Speicial Life Form. I exchanged it for my own life!"

You call that greedy?

Jian Wushuang was somewhat surprised, but then he thought that someone like Wu Zuo wouldn't spend money on things he could snatch.

"Ten percent is enough!" Jian Wushuang accepted it without hesitation.

Wu Zuo then instructed, "Be cautious in everything. After the incident, I will suppress the news and send people to capture you. Let those who try to capture you inadvertently leak this matter."

"Excellent!" Jian Wushuang nodded in agreement.

Everything was going according to plan; now they just needed an opportunity.

At this moment, someone outside reported and presented an invitation.

"Invitation to the Grand Wedding of the Blessing Longevity Hall Master!"

After reading it, Wu Zuo was overjoyed and handed the invitation to Jian Wushuang, saying, "Haha, it's truly heaven helping me!"

"10,000 years later!" Jian Wushuang secretly rejoiced; this way, he still had plenty of time to prepare.

It was indeed a perfect opportunity, one that couldn't be missed.

10,000 years later, Longevity Hall Master Tie San and Gong Miaoyi happily tied the knot and became Dao Companions!

This was truly a perfect opportunity!

At that time, he would definitely present a grand gift.

A forced marriage, murder, and treasure acquisition, all in one go!

Wu Zuo patted his shoulder and comforted him, "Wushuang, my brother, don't be too sad. I will help you kill Tie San, and the woman will be yours too!"

"Wu Zuo, you're mistaken. I have no interest in her!" Jian Wushuang shook his head.

His heart had died long ago, on that spirited night.

Snatching Gong Miaoyi was just part of the plan, unrelated to romantic feelings!

The real target was Si Tian.

At this moment, Wu Zuo handed out another jade slip and said, "You should hold onto this. I've gathered information about the Beast God Weapon for you. There is also a Beast God Weapon in the Heavenly Realm. You can give it a try. If you need help, contact me anytime!"

"The Heart of the Candle Dragon, Mahayana Spirit Mountain?" Jian Wushuang felt a slight joy. This conflicted with the information provided by Shen Ling, but he was more inclined to trust Wu Zuo. After all, the latter was a prominent figure in the Heavenly Realm, and his information was more reliable than that gathered by that rat, Shen Ling.

"That kid Si Tian once asked Tie San for it, but there's a supreme-peak expert on the Mahayana Spirit Mountain. Ordinary people can't take it down. However, if I step in, the other party should give some face. If it's impossible, just snatch it!" Wu Zuo said indifferently.
