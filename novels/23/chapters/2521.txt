Chapter 2522: Major Upheaval

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Governor and several other remaining Ultimate Gods gathered in a magnificent palace within Demonic Moon Prefecture’s nest.

There were once, nine Ultimate Gods but only six remained.

“Governor, how’s your injury?” asked one of the Ultimate Gods.

“Fortunately, I’ve restored about seventy percent of my strength. Hopefully, I’ll completely recover in a few days,” said the Governor who was still a little pale. “After spending years with eagles, I never expected we’d be attacked by another eagle. I must have lost my foresight. I didn’t expect such a terrifying genius would appear within the Xueya Escort Team. Not to mention, a Peak Divine Demon who could subdue me. Such super geniuses are scarce even in the entire Ancient God Domain, yet we encounter one of them!”

The Governor sighed at his ill fate.

It was rare to see a genius like Jian Wushuang as many people could not even come across one in their lifetime. In a sense, the Demonic Moon Prefecture must have been lucky.

“Governor, we’ve concurrently lost three Ultimate Gods with even you being injured. If the other seventeen prefectures know about this, they might even hit us when we are down beside ridiculing us,” said a thin old man dressed in grey who was in charge of intelligence.

The Governor’s complexion turned ugly and hissed in a low voice, “Try containing the news and don’t spill anything to the other seventeen prefectures. Let’s talk about this when my strength is fully restored.”

“Yes.” The Ultimate Gods all nodded in agreement.

Unexpectedly...

A terrifying power erupted and their whole world started shaking.

The many pavilions and palaces in Demonic Moon Prefecture violently shook.

“What happened?”

“Go out and take a look.”

The Governor and several Ultimate Gods immediately left and appeared hovering in a void above.

They were greeted with an earth-shattering scene.

An infinite ocean of golden divine power was frantically sweeping from all directions and completely enshrouding the Demonic Moon Prefecture’s nest.

There was a heavy restriction shield formation Demonic Moon Prefecture had set up at heavy expense surrounding the prefecture which could even parry off attacks from High-Level Ultimate Gods. However, that shield was shaking violently under the golden divine power’s attacks and finally gave way before being shattered.

“The shield is gone?” The Governor along with the others were shocked.

Thereafter, the golden divine power ocean engulfed the entire Demonic Moon Prefecture and formed a huge Golden Prison.

The Golden Prison was like a sturdy iron barrel that trapped all their experts.

“This... What technique is this?

“It’s a prison. It’s so strong that even our restrictive shield was crushed! Who made this prison?”

A tumultuous panic broke loose within the prefecture.

Suddenly...

“Governor, look! He’s there!” yelled an Ultimate God nearby in a shrill and forlorn tone.

The Governor and other experts traced the shout’s source and saw two figures standing on the Golden Prison’s edge.

They were no other than Jian Wushuang and Xiao Tiexin!

“It’s both of you!”

The Governor of Demonic Moon Prefecture was initially shocked but then became furious.

It was just a few days ago that he was injured twice by Jian Wushuang and his prefecture’s people were defeated. The Demonic Moon Prefecture suffered a great loss in the battle against Jian WuShuang and Xiao Tiexin.

After the incident, he dared not take revenge against Jian Wushuang for fearing the consequences. However, Jian Wushuang and Xiao Tiexin were unrelenting and even appeared before him?

How could the Governor not be irked by their disparaging gestures?

“G... Governor, look! Look at his divine powers...” The stuttering voice was from an Ultimate God who also previously took part in the Xueyue Escort Team massacre as he stared fearfully at Jian Wushuang.

The Governor finally noticed the divine powers Jian Wushuang emanated from that Ultimate God’s cue.

Jian Wushuang’s divine power aura was increased by two levels under the black stone’s influence and had reached the Ultimate God level.

“U... Ultimate G... God?” The Governor was stunned.

“Has he broken through to the Ultimate God Realm?”

“How is it possible? Four days ago, he was at Peak Divine Demon realm!”

“Did he make such crazy progress in just four days?”

The other experts around were also shocked.

They had suffered great losses when that person was just at Peak Divine Demon realm. What would happen if that person had made a breakthrough into the Ultimate God realm?

“Tiexin, you stay here.”

Jian Wushuang told Tiexin as he made his way ahead toward the people of Demonic Moon Prefecture.

“Governor, I haven’t seen you for a few days. How are you?” Jian Wushuang wore a playful smile on his face.

“What are you doing here?” Feelings of fear had overwhelmed the Governor’s anger.

“Aren’t you stating the obvious? A few days ago, you and your people came to rob us, and as soon as you took action, you placed a restriction to trap all of our people. Now, I’m here to return the favor. Although my Golden Prison isn’t a restriction, I can assure you its power is no less than an ordinary restriction!” Jian Wushuang said.

The Governor was trembling in fear as he could see what was about to happen from the surging golden divine power.

The Golden Prison was not something he could forcibly break open.

None of the experts trapped within the prison were able to escape.

“Your Excellency, there have been no conflicts between us before. I admit the previous incident was purely a misunderstanding. Besides, you’ve already killed three of my Ultimate Gods. Do you want to wipe us out? What if we offer you ten thousand Primordial Stones as our sincere apology? How about that?” The Governor spoke servilely.

He had no choice as the pressure Jian Wushuang asserted on him was too great and he desperately needed to retreat.

As for the ten thousand Primordial Stones which he offered, he was in great despair for losing them. Nonetheless, there would be opportunities of earning the Primordial Stones as long the Demonic Moon Prefecture remained.

“Haha, ten thousand Primordial Stones? Governor, have you forgotten how you treated the Xueyue Escort Team before? A small guard like Xiao Tiexin from the Xueyue Escort Team was willing to give up six thousand Primordial Stones to save her life but you refused to accept her offer. Aren’t you being a bit stingy to just offer me ten thousand Primordial Stones?” Jian Wushuang sneered derisively.

“Your Excellency, we have made concessions. Don’t push us too far,” said the Governor coldly. “You are indeed strong, but don’t forget this is the Dark Thunder Territory and Demonic Moon Prefecture is one of the Eighteen Prefectures. The Eighteen Prefectures have always been acting unanimously against outsiders. If you dare to attack us, the other seventeen prefectures will join forces and kill you!”
