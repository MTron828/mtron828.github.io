4498 Set Off to the Land of Gods

Yan Dan.

This person was the only person that the God Refining Sect Master had already decided on to take over the throne.

However, with Jian Wushuang’s appearance and the dispute between Yan Dan and Jian Wushuang at the Sect Master’s banquet that day, the God Refining Sect Master gradually became disappointed in Yan Dan.

Sensitive, easily angered, headstrong, narrow-minded, ambitious, and not shrewd.

This was the Yan Dan that the God Refining Sect Master had seen at the banquet the other day.

How could such a person control a Holy Land and lead it to glory?

That day, he did not point out these things. For one, no matter what, Yan Dan was still his head disciple. He could not scold him in front of the whole sect. For two, if he told Yan Dan all his feelings, it would be hard to avoid imbalance in his heart and resentment.

The God Refining Sect Master naturally did not care about resentment, but there was no need for it.

On the contrary, Jian Wushuang’s performance that day had made him somewhat amazed.

He was neither haughty nor humble, and his expression was calm.

When the God Refining Sect Master looked at Jian Wushuang that day, he could not help but say something from the bottom of his heart.

‘A heart with thousands of thunderbolts and a face as calm as a Lake could become a general!’

Exceptional talent represented the upper limit of Jian Wushuang’s growth. His outstanding wisdom meant that Jian Wushuang would never bring the God Refining Sect into a land of eternal doom!

All of a sudden, Void Master Ba Huang’s heart started to waver when he thought about the position of the next Sect Master.

The hall was silent.

Since the God Refining Sect Master did not say anything, the others naturally did not dare to make any noise.

After a long while, the God Refining Sect Master finally opened his mouth and said, “I’m sure you know why this Sect Master has gathered you here today, right?”

Before anyone could say anything, Yan Dan stepped forward and said, “Lord Sect Master, I’m guessing that the mission is about to begin?”

“That’s right.” The God Refining Sect Master nodded his head. He then looked at the crowd and said in a deep voice, “I’ve just received news that the other sects and forces have already sent their disciples to the Land of Gods. You should also not delay and set off for the Land of Gods immediately!”

“Yes!” Jian Wushuang, Fu Chen, and Yan Dan lowered their heads and said.

At this moment, they knew that the three of them were the candidates to go to the Land of Gods.

“Wushuang, oh Wushuang, let’s see if you’ll die after we leave the God Refining Sect!”

Yan Dan lowered his head and looked at Jian Wushuang, sneering.

A vicious plan began to form in his mind.

Jian Wushuang was expressionless, but he had his own thoughts.

It would be fine if Yan Dan acted obediently along the way, but if he wanted to be stupid and court death, Jian Wushuang did not mind sending him on his way.

“Alright, you three can set off.”

“Remember, don’t force anything, and be careful of people from other sects.”

The Sect Master said in a deep voice. Then, he waved his sleeve and a giant bird that looked like a bone dragon flew out from the back mountain of the God Refining Sect.

This giant bird had no hair, no flesh, only white bones. Its eyes were completely black.

On his back, there was a high platform for people to step on.

Jian Wushuang and the other two took a step forward and immediately flew up, landing on the high platform on the back of the giant bird.

Screeeeeech!!

The giant bird stretched out its head and let out a long screech. It immediately carried Jian Wushuang and the others and shuttled through 108,000 miles. They left the God Refining Sect and shot toward the Land of Gods.

The God Refining Sect Master took a deep look at the place where Jian Wushuang and the other two had disappeared. He shook his head and only looked away after a long while.

In the main hall, Elder Ban Shan also looked at the three people who had disappeared and was lost in thought for a long time.

…

God Refining Sect, Elder Hall.

At the residence of Elder Shen Lian.

Thud, thud, thud, thud.

A series of hurried footsteps could be heard.

A trusted disciple of Elder Shen Lian walked in hurriedly.

“Master, Young Master Yan Dan, Wushuang, and Fu Chen have already left the God Refining Sect on the giant bone bird,” the trusted disciple knelt on the ground and said in a low voice.

“Oh? They left just like that?”

In the center of the hall, Elder Shen Lian, who was sitting cross-legged, opened his eyes. A sharp glint flashed in his eyes.

“Alright, alright. I’ll leave now. If the Sect Master asks where I’ve gone, just say that I’ve come to a sudden realization and left the sect to look for a breakthrough opportunity. Do you understand?”

“I understand!” the trusted disciple quickly replied. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Mmm.” Nodding his head in satisfaction, Elder Shen Lian stood up. He took a step and disappeared from the Elder Hall.

“Wushuang, Wushuang, the Land of Gods will be where your bones are buried!”

In the void, Elder Shen Lian’s cold voice was heard.

…

At the same time.

Not far away from the God Refining Sect, there was a group of bright stars.

This place was close to the Void Forbidden Land and was sparsely populated. Very few people would pay attention to this place.

...

However, such a place was where the Crimson Whale Gang, the largest gang of space pirates in the surrounding billions of miles, was located.

This group of space pirates was notorious for robbing Void Warriors who passed by in space all year round. The entire Void Universe gritted its teeth at them, but there was nothing they could do.

The reason for this was that the Chief of Crimson Whale Gang was a Four Scar Void Master!

Under the leadership of this Four Scar Void Master, the entire Crimson Whale Gang had become extremely rampant. Even Scar-level Void Warriors would have a headache when they saw him and could only obediently pay in treasures to bribe him to avoid trouble.

Crimson Whale Gang’s headquarters was located in the middle of the stars, like the belly of a giant whale.

At this moment, the Chief of Crimson Whale Gang, who struck fear in the hearts of others at the mere mention of his name, was kneeling obediently at the feet of a silver-haired youth with icy eyes.

“L-Lord Bing Ye, I’ve received news that the Land of Gods has opened. All the major forces and sects in the Void Universe have sent their elite disciples to the Land of Gods to break through the restrictions and find the alien races.”

The Chief’s entire body trembled as he spoke, not even daring to take a deep breath.

It could be seen that the Chief was extremely afraid of this silver-haired youth.

“Hmm.” The silver-haired youth with icy eyes nodded expressionlessly and asked, “Luo Ming, I asked you to send someone to inquire about ‘Jian Wushuang’ in the God Refining Sect. Do you have any news?”

“Lord Bing Ye, I’ve sent someone to ask around. There’s no one named Jian Wushuang in the God Refining Sect. Instead, there’s someone named ‘Wushuang’ who passed the selection and entered the God Refining Sect. He has a rare talent in the God Refining Sect.”

...

“Wushuang?” The silver-haired youth squinted his eyes and sneered, “Jian Wushuang, Jian Wushuang, you’re really lucky. You didn’t die that day. Instead, you managed to enter the God Refining Sect and become a super talent, a Heaven’s Favorite disciple.”

Shaking his head, the silver-haired youth continued to ask, “Let me ask you, how is Wushuang’s current situation?”

“Wushuang, huh? My Lord, according to my spy, Wushuang has already left the God Refining Sect and is following two other disciples to the Land of Gods!”

“He also went to the Land of Gods?”

The silver-haired youth’s brows twitched, and then he laughed. “Good, good, good. Jian Wushuang, I’ll wait for you in the Land of Gods!”

With that, he lowered his head and instructed the original Crimson Whale Gang’s Chief, “Luo Ming, get ready. We’re going to the Land of Gods!”

“Yes!” The Chief head respectfully retreated.

After the Chief left, the silver-haired youth raised his head and looked into the distance. A cold light flashed through his eyes.

This person was none other than Supreme Bing Ye, who had entered the Void Universe with Jian Wushuang!
