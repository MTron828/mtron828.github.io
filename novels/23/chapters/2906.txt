Chapter 2907: Suppression

——

Buzz!

Endless sword essence burst out from Jian Wushuang’s body, and the Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand.

He casually waved his sword, and in an instant, the Majestic Sword Shadow, together with the great domain of the nine universe blood light river, crazily pressed down on Elder Qin.

“What?” Elder Qin turned pale with fright.

She had never expected that Jian Yi would dare to attack her directly in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s lair.

This sudden attack was completely beyond her imagination. However, she was a genuine Immortal Saint, so her reaction speed was extremely fast. She immediately used many protective measures to try to block Jian Wushuang’s sword.

However, the power of Jian Wushuang’s attack was too terrifying. It was beyond his imagination.

Splash.

The sword shadow passed by, but Elder Qin was not damaged at all.

However, the many protective measures on her body had been completely shattered by the sword light.

“He could have killed me with that attack, but he didn’t hurt me at all. He wanted to… capture me alive!” Elder Qin instantly understood.

However, Jian Wushuang had already attacked again.

He only pointed his finger at a distance, and the power of the space-time rule burst out instantly.

Heaven-fixing skill!

This move had little effect on the immortal saint when Jian Wushuang had not made a breakthrough in his comprehension of the space-time rule.

However, now that his comprehension of the space-time rule had reached the Immortal Saint-level, the power of this move would be much stronger.

Even if Elder Qin was an Immortal Saint, he could not resist this move.

Jian Wushuang immediately stepped forward.

“Stop!”

Chu Yong finally reacted and shouted. At the same time, his terrifying strength burst out. He held a red long spear in one hand. The long spear pierced through the void and formed a huge pillar of fire, which rushed toward Jian Wushuang.

“Get lost!”

Jian Wushuang did not even bother to look at Chu Yong. Instead, he slashed out with his sword and instantly activated the power of the boundless sword tree in his body to the maximum.

Whoosh!

A huge sword light swept out.

The sword light, with the majestic power of the rule, hit the fire pillar head-on.

The fire pillar was extinguished instantly, and Chu Yong was sent flying at the first moment. He was in an extremely sorry state.

Jian Wushuang was not hindered at all. He appeared in front of Elder Qin and swung his Blood Mountain Sword again.

This time, he did not use his swordsmanship, but the suppressive power of the Blood Mountain Sword!

The Blood Mountain Sword could kill and suppress enemies!

It was just that Jian Wushuang rarely used this suppressive skill before.

But now…

Buzz! Buzz!

The Blood Mountain Sword turned into a towering giant mountain, and a huge whirlpool appeared at the bottom of the mountain. The whirlpool crazily swallowed everything. First, under Jian Wushuang’s guidance, it directly swallowed Elder Qin, and then the Blood Mountain Sword turned into a divine sword again, it returned to Jian Wushuang’s hand.

It was too fast!

Jian Wushuang moved too fast.

In just a moment, he sent Chu Yong flying and then suppressed Elder Qin.

After doing all this, he looked around.

What he was looking at was naturally the manor behind him. In the attic of the manor, Leng Rushuang had also come to the window.

“Jian Wushuang…” Leng Rushuang’s eyes were extremely complicated.

“I’m sorry.” Jian Wushuang and Leng Rushuang looked at each other, but his figure directly rushed toward the void to the side.

“Jian Yi, how dare you!”

A loud shout suddenly sounded in heaven and earth.

It was so loud that it shook the entire Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

Chu Yong was the one who shouted. He had seen Jian Wushuang suppress Elder Qin in front of him, and it was in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion was completely shaken.

A large number of figures flew up and rushed in the direction of the pavilion.

Long Xingzi, the Pavilion Master of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, rushed over at once.

At the same time, a few hidden experts of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion also rushed over.

In the blink of an eye, three Immortal Saints arrived in front of Jian Wushuang. Including Chu Yong, there were four of them.

In addition, there were many powerful disciples of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, such as the Invincible Divine Master, who was rarely seen in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. However, there were several in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, and they had surrounded Jian Wushuang in just a moment.

Of course, this was also because Jian Wushuang did not make a move. Otherwise, it would not be so easy for him to be alone.

“Chu Yong, what happened? Where is Elder Qin?” Long Xingzi stared at Chu Yong with a gloomy face.

“Pavilion Master, Elder Qin has been suppressed by this Jian Yi,” Chu Yong said in a low voice.

“What?” Long Xingzi was shocked, but then he flew into a rage!

He was not the only one. The other two Immortal Saints and the disciples of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion were all furious.

This was the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. An outsider, Jian Yi, had suppressed an Immortal Saint-level Elder of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s lair?

“Jian Yi, the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion respects your strength and identity. We welcome you and treat you with the utmost care, but now you have suppressed Elder Qin of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. You are too arrogant.” Long Xingzi’s voice was cold. “Release Elder Qin quickly and hand over a million sacred elixirs to apologize to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, or else…”

“Or else what?” Jian Wushuang stood alone, facing the countless experts of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion without any fear.

Long Xingzi’s face changed.

Even the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion did not dare to underestimate Jian Wushuang’s strength. Therefore, they did not want to offend him unless it was necessary.

But now…

“Jian Yi, the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion has no enmity with you. So what do you want to do today?” Long Xingzi shouted in a low voice.

“My goal is simple. I want to know where Young Phoenix is going and why she is going there.”

“Besides, when the Dragon-phoenix ranking was released, you placed her name at third place. In other words, her contribution to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion is ranked in the top three among all the predecessors of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. She is only second to the founder of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, Ancient Sage, and the third Pavilion Master. However, what contribution did she make to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion that you would place her in third place?

“I want to know everything.

“As long as I know everything, I will let Elder Qin out and guarantee that she won’t be hurt. But if you don’t tell me, then don’t blame me for being rude!”

Jian Wushuang’s expression was solemn and extremely cold.
