Chapter 2764: Nanwu Palace Master

He was a bulky middle-aged man who wore a loose and luxurious robe with a dignified expression on his face.

His hands were behind his back while he stood in the void and oversaw everything from the peak with cold eyes. Although all of those who stood in front of him were considered strong Grand Ultimate Gods, they were no different from ordinary experts in the bulky middle-aged man’s opinion.

The most noticeable part about him was the divine power being released from him.

The wave of divine power unleashed was really too strong!

Although he was also a Peak Grand Ultimate God, he was much stronger when compared to Dong Shen.

Their superiority was distinguishable simply by his wave of divine power without the necessity for both of them to fight it out as the bulky middle-aged man was far stronger than Dong Shen.

“This is... Nanwu Palace Master?” Experts who were fighting furiously from the Sword Alliance and Divine Demon Sect were surprised when they saw that bulky middle-aged man.

“It’s Nanwu Palace Master, the current publicly recognized number one expert in the Danyang Holy Domain!!”

“He’s actually here?”

“The Golden Prison has been broken. Let’s run! Quick!” The remaining Divine Demon Sect’s Grand Ultimate Gods grabbed the opportunity to immediately escape into their surroundings at the same time the others were stunned.

Jian Wushuang and the others had also stopped their attacks while looking over to the bulky middle-aged man with a serious look in their eyes.

As the saying goes—a big tree was a good shelter. The saying applies to a well-known person too.

Nanwu Palace Master was after all the incumbent publicly acknowledged first-ranked expert in the Danyang Holy Domain.

He was ranked first among the Ultimate Gods in Danyang Holy Domain.

That fact could be noticeable from either the divine power he unleashed which was one whole level higher than Dong Shen or his actions of breaking Jian Wushuang’s Golden Prison with a simple attack. In short, he was an extremely strong person who nobody dared to ignore.

“Nanwu...” Dong Shen standing in the void had also seen Nanwu Palace Master’s arrival. However, the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet was still blocking him.

“Dong Shen, this is the first time I’ve seen the Divine Demon Sect be in such an embarrassing situation. A first-rated force badly defeated a pinnacle force such as yourself,” said Nanwu Palace Master in a relaxed manner with his cold yet filled with a strong hint of dignity in his voice.

“Humph, it’s easy for you to critique when you’re at the sidelines. Do you think the Sword Alliance is merely a first-rated force?” Dong Shen asked with a solemn expression on his face.

“That’s true.” Nanwu Palace Master slightly nodded.

His purpose for rushing over was because he received news that the Sword Alliance had wiped out the Heavenly Blood Alliance in a thunderous manner and almost caused all the experts from the Divine Demon Sect to come forth.

His original purpose was to observe the Divine Demon Sect’s true combat power but did not expect to see such a great and almost unbelievable change in the battle.

It was true that the Divine Demon Sect had sent every member they had with a total of 12 Grand Ultimate Gods and even Dong Shen personally took action. However, the results were them being heavily defeated by the Sword Alliance in direct combat.

In addition, he had been staying in a nearby void and was able to see the ongoing fierce battle in the Golden Prison as his soul power was sufficiently strong to ignore the Golden Prison’s blockade. Therefore, he was able to observe everything happening on the battlefield. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The Sword Alliance’s Grand Ultimate God-level combat power had greatly surprised even himself.

The combination of all five Grand Ultimate Gods that consisted of Strange Old Tong, Jue Xin, Old Snake, An Ying, Lan Junzhu, and even Jian Wushuang coupled together with a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet, a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet, and two Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets—such Grand Ultimate God-level combat power was really horrifying. Together with Jian Wushuang’s suppressive domains that covered the entire area, only the Crimson Stone Fort and his Nanwu Palace among the five pinnacle forces in Danyang Continent were capable of defending against such combat power.

“Sword Alliance...” Nanwu Palace Master’s facial expression slightly darkened when he looked over at Jian Wushuang with his sharp eyes.

“I’ve heard about how strong Alliance Master Su Han of the Sword Alliance was. You’re undeniably a pinnacle genius that killed Fo Yi—a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God—head-on while you were still a Peak Heaven Ultimate God. Now that I’ve seen you today, you really are exceptional,” said Nanwu Palace Master with a hint of certainty in his words.

He saw the battle clearly with his own eyes. Although Jian Wushuang was only a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God and had not previously taken any action, his motions were capable of completely changing the situation. He started with activating his domains to suppress the entire battlefield and constricted every expert under the Divine Demon Sect on the battlefield.

His subsequent actions then killed four Grand Ultimate Gods in one go while working together with the Sword Alliance’s experts such that even the Fiery Cloud Demon Master was killed by him.

Although such power was not a threat to him, it was enough to catch his attention.

Jian Wushuang smiled humbly and asked, “Nanwu Palace Master, I’ve been looking forward to meeting you. What happened today is between the Sword Alliance and Divine Demon Sect. It has nothing to do with the Nanwu Palace and I know that the Sword Alliance had never caused trouble with Nanwu Palace. I wonder why Nanwu Palace Master is here today?”

Nanwu Palace Master was silent for a short while before speaking, “Alliance Master Su Han, it’s true there are no grudges between Nanwu Palace and Sword Alliance. The Nanwu Palace shouldn’t have gotten involved in what’s going on today. However, the Divine Demon Sect is one of the five pinnacle forces in the Danyang Continent and carries great influence. It’ll affect the pinnacle forces’ position once losses are too great and will have a great impact on the situation in the Danyang Continent. At that moment, the balance that we’ve tried so hard to maintain will be completely disrupted and might lead the Danyang Continent into a chaotic state.

“Hence, I hope Alliance Master Su Han can stop whatever that’s going on to give Nanwu Palace some face. What do you think?” Nanwu Palace Master spoke in a gentle voice. Although he sounded casual, he gave off the suppressive aura of someone superior.

Jian Wushuang and all the Sword Alliance’s experts were able to feel extremely strong pressure coming from Nanwu Palace Master.

Jian Wushuang knew that if he refused to stop and continued the battle, Nanwu Palace Master would personally take action.

At that moment, battling Nanwu Palace Master was not something Jian Wushuang was completely confident about.

“I don’t dare object now that Nanwu Palace Master has personally made this request. This battle shall end here. However, the Sword Alliance has taken over Heavenly Blood Alliance and nobody should ask us to relinquish it. I hope Nanwu Palace Master can understand this,” said Jian Wushuang.

“That’s for sure. The forces in the Danyang Continent won’t stop fighting against one another. Understandably, the Sword Alliance is powerful enough to take over one or two forces and control some territories. I believe Sect Master Dong Shen also thinks so too.” Nanwu Palace Master glanced at Dong Shen.

Dong Shen had an extremely darkened facial expression.

He was not reconciled with the ongoings at that moment but there was nothing he could do even if he was unhappy about it.

He could see the situation in front of him—the Sword Alliance not weaker than the Divine Demon Sect when comparing their total strength, it was stronger instead.
