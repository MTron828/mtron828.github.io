Chapter 284: Fool

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“He defeated me?” Shen Tianyu could not believe it.

He had tried his best, but lost the fight.

As he was retreating, Jian Wushuang had already launched an attack on him. Covered by the heavy fog, Shen Tianyu was not able to move freely, so he looked slow and lifeless.

“I didn’t expect that I would be killed by a nobody,” Shen Tianyu stared at Jian Wushuang and said angrily.

“Nobody?” Jian Wushuang said with a sneer, “After I kill you, I won’t be a nobody.”

The Triple-kill Sword lashed out and immediately pierced Shen Tianyu’s body, leave a big hole in his chest.

Shen Tianyu’s body fell to the ground. Jian Wushuang stood next to him and looked down.

“A top expert, who ranked within 500 on the Bloodmoon List, is powerful indeed. If he had not been afraid that Protectors would come and chosen to perform a frontal attack against me, I would not have killed him so easily.”?Jian Wushuang thought.

He was quite clear that he could kill Shen Tianyu because Shen Tianyu was distracted.

He had comprehended Origin of the World and Slaughter Source, which would help him in a frontal attack, but Shen Tianyu was adept at speed, so frontal attacks were his weak point.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Tai Shan and the other eight teammates appeared beside Jian Wushuang.

“Shen Tianyu is dead?” Tai Shan and Mo Ying looked at the corpse in surprise.

“Swordsman, you...” said Tai Shan, staring at Jian Wushuang in shock.

Now they knew Jian Wushuang just fought them for fun at that time.

“Shen Tianyu ranked high on the Bloodmoon List. Only one of our Protectors ranks higher than him. Moreover, He had fought with a Half-saint expert for a long time. Though he failed, he survived.

“However, now, he was killed by you. This strength...” Mo Ying smacked his lips and sigh.

Jian Wushuang could not help but laugh.

He had a fight with a Half-saint expert from the Wilderness Sword Sect at the gathering of the sects of the Northern Region.

The Half-saint expert was strong indeed. He had tried his best to fight, but the top expert just blocked his attack casually. Lastly, he drew with his opponent. Shen Tianyu, who could have a fierce fight with a Half-saint expert, was really powerful.

Whoosh!

A figure rushed over and quickly appeared in front of them.

Jian Wushuang and his nine teammates immediately locked their eyes on it.

“Protector Wu Jiu.”

Tai Shan immediately spoke.

Wu Jiu coldly looked at the corpse on the ground.

“This is... Shen Tianyu?” Wu Jiu narrowed his eyes and said.

Wu Jiu ranked lower than Shen Tianyu on the Bloodmoon List. He and Bei Mu could only suppress Shen Tianyu, but they were not able to kill him. But now, Shen Tianyu was dead.

“You killed Shen Tianyu?” Wu Jiu cast a glance at them.

The moment Tai Shan opened his mouth and wanted to say that Jian Wushuang killed by himself, Jian Wushuang scrambled to reply. “Shen Tianyu was so confident that he did not detect that we ambushed him. We took the chance and worked together to kill him. It took us all of our strength.”

“Oh?” Wu Jiu looked around and saw quite a few holes, which indicated a fierce fight, so he nodded.

“Shen Tianyu could not block the attack from one of our squads. He wasn’t as strong as I expected.” Wu Jiu sneered, and then waved his hand to take the corpse and the Interspatial Ring away.

“You did well. Just go back to Heartless City by yourselves.” After finishing his words, Wu Jiu left.

Tai Shan and Mo Ying’s face darkened.

“Why?”

“Swordsman killed Shen Tianyu with great effort. Wu Jiu just said a few words to us and then took Shen Tianyu and his Interspatial Ring away.”

The others all felt it was unfair.

Wu Jiu had nothing to do with Shen Tianyu’s death, but he could take all the trophies away.

Shen Tianyu was not only the top expert on the Bloodmoon List, but also the chief of Wing Gang. As he had managed the gang for a long time, his Interspatial Ring must be precious.

“Swordsman, you just let him go?” Mo Ying looked toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang just gave a slight smile and said, “Just some Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid. Even if we get them, we’ll have to hand them in. How much shall we have? As long as Wu Jiu reports our contribution, our master won’t treat us unfairly.”

Jian Wushuang seemed to not care about it.

In fact, he did not care about the Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid indeed. He felt that it was more important to fight against a top expert.

“Let’s go back,” Jian Wushuang said.

Then they returned to the Heartless Sect. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Shortly after this, Wu Jiu and the other experts of Bloody Blade Team also came back.

The Bloody Blade Team succeeded in this action. They not only rooted out the Wing Gang, but also killed the two chiefs of it.

After returning, Wu Jiu and other two Protectors immediately went to meet the Master of Heartless Sect.

The ninth squad gathered in their own manor, waiting quietly.

“Hehe, our squad got the limelight because of Swordsman,” Mo Ying said with a smile.

“Swordsman could kill a top expert on the Bloodmoon List by himself. I think the name of Swordsman will show up on the list soon. Our squad can benefit from it.”

“I wonder what prize our Master will award us?”

All the members of the ninth team looked forward to it.

They had made a great contribution to their sect. Therefore, they should be rewarded.

Shortly after, Tai Shan came back, with a bad look.

Looking at their teammates, especially Jian Wushuang, Tai Shan wore a complicated expression and spoke after taking a deep breath. “We were fooled by Wu Jiu. He brought Shen Tianyu to meet our Master, but he didn’t mention us and said he killed Shen Tianyu with great efforts.”
