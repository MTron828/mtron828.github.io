Chapter 1880: Owner Recognition!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The time limit of one thousand years had passed. Those people who had immersed themselves in the comprehension of Sword Principle and sword intention opened their eyes simultaneously.

In the past one thousand years, regardless of Luo Xianzi and the few who had cultivated on cultivation platform in sword tomb or those experts who could only stay outside of the sword tomb because they didn’t have Sword Principle Inheritance Token, they had gained a bountiful harvest. Most of them were wearing smiles on their faces but there were, of course, some that looked regretful.

They were unhappy that the time was so short and they didn’t improve much in their swordsmanship.

“Sword Emperor,” Luo Xianzi appeared next to Jian Wushuang, “How did it go?”

“Not bad, how about yourself?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Not too bad. My comprehension in Sword Principle has increased by quite a bit,” Luo Xianzi said, “I heard that not only are there great opportunities in Emperor Sword Palace, there is also a terrifying sword technique. But it’s a pity that although I comprehended carefully and tried to look for it, I couldn’t find it.”

“That sword technique must rely on luck,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“That’s true,” Luo Xianzi nodded, “Emperor Sword Palace has been opened many times. Over the years, only the founders of Emperor Sword Sect received the sword technique. I am confident that I am not much weaker in comprehension than the founder of Emperor Sword Sect, but I am not as lucky as him.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly but didn’t speak.

The broken sword was too obscure.

Even the worshipping sword intention was extremely ambiguous. Jian Wushuang could find it not only through years of studies but it also largely depended on luck.

As for comprehension of sword principle, that relied on one’s gifted talent.

They didn’t talk anymore and walked to the exit of the Emperor Sword Palace.

When they arrived at the exit, Jian Wushuang realized that the expert who had entered Emperor Sword Palace together walked to the altar of the eight King Swords again.

When they had first arrived at Emperor Sword Palace, the experts had already tried owner recognition once.

After one thousand years of comprehension, these experts obviously wanted to try a second time.

It was a pity that their second try failed as well.

“Jian Wushuang, these people failed. Now, there are two of us left. You and I. Who shall go first?” Luo Xianzi looked at Jian Wushuang.

King Swords’ owner recognition, everyone who entered Emperor Sword Palace would give it a try regardless of the outcome.

After all, even if owner recognition failed, they had nothing to lose. But once there was a King Sword that recognized one as its owner, the person would be gain abundantly.

“You go ahead first,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Luo Xianzi didn’t refuse and immediately walked towards the altar.

When she came to the altar, Luo Xianzi started owner recognition with the first King Sword. When she failed, she continued to the second.

Very soon, Luo Xianzi had tried all eight King Swords. The end result was that none of the King Swords responded.

Luo Xianzi bitterly smiled as she walked back.

The surrounding experts saw and sighed emotionally.

“Even Luo Xianzi failed. It seems that King Swords’ owner recognition isn’t that easy!”

“Over the years, besides the founder of Emperor Sword Sect, there is no one who has gotten a King Sword. Although Luo Xianzi was powerful, she seems to be slightly behind from King Swords’ owner recognition standards.”

“Luo Xianzi already tried. Now, there’s only Jian Wushung left. I wonder if he has the luck to make one of the King Swords recognize him as owner.”

“Him? I admit that he is powerful but his understanding of Sword Principle isn’t higher than Luo Xianzi’s.”

“Mm, Luo Xianzi couldn’t do it, Jian Wushuang shouldn’t be able to do it either.”

The surrounding people were whispering.

Luo Xianzi already returned to Jian Wushuang, “It seems like I am not lucky enough to get the King Sword. Emperor Sword, there’s only you left who stands a chance to get King Sword to recognize you as its owner,” Luo Xianzi said.

“Haha, Luo Xianzi, you failed to do so and I will only be the same,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Who knows if you don’t try. Maybe you’re lucky enough.” Luo Xianzi said.

Although Luo Xianzi said so, she obviously didn’t think that Jian Wushuang could succeed either.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows, then he walked towards the altar without hesitation.

In front of everyone, Jian Wushuang approached the altar.

However, before he reached the altar, when he was still a hundred meters away…

Vroom!!

There were eight terrifying sword intentions that suddenly soared up from the altar.

The eight sword intentions had existed previously but they were quite ambiguous and they weren’t strong. However, at that very moment, the sword intentions intensified multiple times.

Before the experts’ eyes, the eight King Swords that were floating quietly at the altar suddenly shook vigorously.

Such vigorous shiver was obviously showing of excitement and wild joy.

Everyone was shocked at the sight.

“How did it…”

“This, this is…”

“When we went to try for owner recognition, the eight King Swords didn’t even move. Now, Jian Wushuang merely got closer to them and the eight King Swords are so drastically different and they became so excited? How is it possible?” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The surrounding experts were astonished.

Especially Luo Xianzi, she was shocked.

When divine weapons recognize their owners, don’t they rely on power and comprehension of Sword Principle?

In terms of power, she wasn’t any weaker than Jian Wushuang. In terms of comprehension of Sword Principle, she was stronger than Jian Wushuang.

Even she didn’t cause the eight King Swords to respond, but they shook vigorously at the same time when Jian Wushuang appeared?

“Could it be…” Luo Xianzi’s eyes dilated. She figured out a possibility.

The possibility was quickly determined.

“Sword Emperor definitely received the hidden terrifying secret skill from the sword tomb!”

“Yes, definitely so. Otherwise, the eight King Swords definitely wouldn’t be so excited!”

Disregarding everyone’s astonishment, Jian Wushuang continued to walk forward. Very soon, he arrived at the altar.

When he stepped foot onto the altar, the eight King Swords were in a commotion. Every single King Swords flew over from each corner of the altar and stood before Jian Wushuang. All of them were quivering as though they were trying to ingratiate themselves with Jian Wushuang. It seemed to be a battle among the King Swords.

“The King Swords are fighting to recognize Jian Wushuang as their owner?”

The surrounding people were dumbfounded.

Even Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He had comprehended King Sword Principle and he had already expected that the King Swords might want to recognize him as owner when he went forward for owner recognition.

But he had never expected that the eight King Swords would be that excited and they would be fighting to recognize him as owner.
