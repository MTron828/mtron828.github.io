“I just got three of them like that?” Jian Wushuang still could not believe his luck when he put them into his Interspatial Ring.

“Jian Wushuang, not so soon. You get the elixirs, the Jin Kingdom experts won’t let you off!” Gu King reminded.

Jian Wushuang looked grave. He looked around and sensed numerous eyes burning with greed.

Most of them belong to the Jin Kingdom experts.

“Kill!”

“Die!”

Almost simultaneously, two figures in gold armors appeared beside Jian Wushuang out of nowhere. They came directly at him. They were the nearest to Jian Wushuang and were the first to attack him.

“Since when do Medium Celestial Masters think they can kill me?” Jian Wushuang smirked and drew his Blood Mountain Sword, with killing intents in his eyes.

Clang!

A low echo of sword rang.

A sword light was formed out of nowhere; anyone who saw it would find it extremely beautiful, sorrowful, and hypnotic at the same time.

At that moment, many Jin Kingdom experts squinted.

“That swordsmanship again!”

“He used that swordsmanship to kill nearly 20 Celestial Masters of ours!”

“Careful, consciousness attack!”

Some Jin Kingdom expert reminded.

However, it was too late. The two attacking Celestial Masters were already in a trance and were beheaded by the beautifully sorrowful sword light. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The two medium Celestial Masters were killed in moments.

“Bastard!”

His killing two experts made other Jin Kingdom Celestial Masters more furious. Their killing intents grew intenser.

“Jian Wushuang, this way!” A woman’s shout rang over the battlefield to Jian Wushuang.

He immediately looked into the distance and found Celestial Master An rushing toward him.

Besides, many Green Fire Palace experts had stopped some of them Jin Kingdom experts. Moreover, some capable experts were also dashing toward him.

“Celestial Master An is formidable. As long as I’m with her, the Jin Kingdom can’t touch me.” Jian Wushuang squinted and made the decision. Immediately, he dashed toward her.

All the Jin Kingdom experts in the way tried to stop him. At the same time, their Celestial Masters dived toward Jian Wushuang.

“You can’t run!”

A thunderous shout rang in Jian Wushuang’s ears. It was the strong elder whom he had fought that stopped him, wielding his heavy sword.

“You again?” Jian Wushuang’s countenance slightly changed. The strong elder was a real deal Celestial Master in Exceptional Realm and exceeded him in strength.

“Well, I failed to stop you last time. This time, you can’t escape!” The elder snorted and brandished his heavy sword at Jian Wushuang again, overwhelmingly.

“Ridiculous.”

Jian Wushuang sneered and wielded his Blood Mountain Sword as well.

Crash!

The two clashed and Jian Wushuang was immediately defeated back. However, by the force, Jian Wushuang managed to sail through the Void and got away from the Elder.

“Slick!” The elder was both shocked and furious. Then, he rushed toward Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, hand out Nirvana Elixirs, or… prepare to die!”

A sudden roar reverberated in the space as a giant and powerful Axe Shadow emerged in front of Jian Wushuang.

The Axe Shadow seemed to be able to shatter the world, even Jian Wushuang felt that he might fail to ward it off.

The ax belonged to the middle-aged man with a thunder-like mark between his brows. He was the one who got the first Nirvana Elixir.

“Another one?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. He performed Heaven’s Bane in his full strength.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

As Jian Wushuang darted backward, many other Jin Kingdom experts rushed toward him.

“Damn!” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

“Jian Wushuang, quickly, give me the three elixirs. I’m good at defense. Even if I’m besieged, I can protect them until Celestial Master An arrives.” shouted Celestial Master Green Wolf who had caught up with Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, pass the elixirs to Celestial Master Green Wolf!” Celestial Master An in the distance also urged.

However, hearing Celestial Master An, Jian Wushuang furrowed his brows and shook his head.

“Celestial Master Green Wolf, help block one Celestial Master in Exceptional Realm for me.” Jian Wushuang asked in a low voice.

“What?” Celestial Master Green Wolf’s countenance changed.

Under such circumstances, Jian Wushuang really should pass the elixir to Celestial Master Green Wolf. The latter could keep them until Celestial Master An arrives.

Why did he refuse?

“Doesn’t he trust me? Or does he think that I’ll take all the credit?” Celestial Master Green Wolf was both shocked and angry.

“Stupid, stupid!” Celestial Master Green Wolf roared in his heart. “Nirvana Elixir is important to our Green Fire Palace. How can he be so selfish at this time?”

“If he insists and let the Jin Kingdom experts take them away, that’ll be terrible. He’ll become the sinner of Green Fire Palace!”

Celestial Master Green Wolf was furiously in doubt.

Other Green Fire Palace experts were all shocked.

“How daring he is!”

“Green Wolf is right beside him, why doesn’t he pass the elixirs? What does he want?”

“At this time, he’s actually thinking for his own benefits. He doesn’t trust Celestial Master Green Wolf and is not willing to hand it over!”

Other Green Fire Palace experts appeared angry.

In their eyes, Jian Wushuang kept the elixirs because he was selfish and wanted to keep the three elixirs to himself.

However, no one knew Jian Wushuang’s real intentions.

He did trust Celestial Master Green Wolf, and he was not selfish at all.

The truth was that… Compared to Celestial Master Green Wolf, the elixirs would be safer with him!
