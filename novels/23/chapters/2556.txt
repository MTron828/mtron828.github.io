Chapter 2557: Battle of the Earth Ultimate Gods (2)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Beast King Transformation incarnate!”

The extremely ferocious beast that San Shouwang had turned into pounced forward with terrifying momentum. The fist which had condensed incredible powers lashed toward Pei Qi like the sharp claws of a beast.

Pei Qi was in full concentration and also triggered his divine body the moment San Shouwang made a move. Right after, his divine body suddenly grew five meters tall into a small hill.

His aura had also risen a lot following the swift growth of his divine body. He was performing a very powerful secret technique.

After that, a strong glare shot out of his eyes as his battle blade was shrouded by a layer of crimson-colored light.

“The Blade of Blood Deity!”

Boom boom boom!!! The huge volume of blood mist gushed out and flooded the surroundings into a huge blood ocean.

Pei Qi’s five-meter tall blood-red Blood Deity figure waved the battle blade in his hands as it clashed with the ferocious beast that was pouncing him.

Bang!

Heaven and Earth trembling hard as infinite airwaves sweeping across. The two Principle Worlds began to shake violently.

San Shouwang’s ferocious beast form bounced and flew backward.

Pei Qi’s five-meter-tall Blood Deity form had also stumbled a few steps backward before standing still again.

“Haha, you have some skills.”

San Shouwang laughed heartily as the aura of violence once again swept over.

“It’s time to end this.” Pei Qi stared frostily at San Shouwang. “I’ll surely take your life with this next move!”

“Well, let’s see who’s more skillful then.” San Shouwang roared deeply as well.

Incredible amounts of divine powers were violently gathering toward both their bodies.

They were accumulating energies!

“Is there going to be a verdict?”

“The final and also most powerful clash.”

“This collision will decide their fate. I wonder who will survive in the end.”

The experts outside the Combat Ring held their breaths as hardly anyone blinked from worries that they would miss the coming up clash.

Even Jian Wushuang had his eyes glued to the ring.

Both Earth Ultimate Gods had maximized their divine power accumulation inside the Combat Ring.

San Shouwang was the first to attack.

His figure expanded as scales began forming on the surface. Previously, it was his divine powers that simulated a ferocious beast, but at that moment scales began covering his entire body and had truly turned him into a ferocious armored beast with deep purple scales. The beast turned into a streak of purple shadow and swiftly pounced forward.

“Beast King Fury!”

San Shouwang’s purple beast form let out a furious heaven-shaking roar that resonated in the Combat Ring.

“That roar has sonic attacks embedded. No, not just that but also soul attacks as well and both are very powerful.” Jian Wushuang’s expression turned gloomy.

However, Pei Qi remained calm when he heard the roar. He slapped his chest. Bam! Three drops of blood essence shot out at the same time.

Pei Qi’s aura had simultaneously and immediately shrunk a great deal such that even his face turned pale.

However, the battle blade he held was glowing with brighter and more beautiful crimson lights than before.

“My fate, the grudge of many Pei clansmen, my forty thousand years of hard work, and everything else will depend on this single strike! It’s either him or me!” Pei Qi mumbled as he held the battle blade and raised it high with both his hands.

“Bloody Deity Slaughters Heaven!”

Vroooom!

The boundless blood ocean violently crashed as Pei Qi’s eyes were filled with the craze. The Blood Deity he formed waved its battle blade downward.

As soon as the blade struck, a crimson blade-light that could split Heaven and Earth immediately formed and swept outward.

As the crimson blade-light appeared, its terrifying energy turned the surrounding blood ocean into steam.

San Shouwang’s purple beast form did not waste a second as it charged directly at the crimson blade-light with infinite ferocity and sneered as he did so.

Ring~~~ The two Principle Worlds that were violently pressing against each other began to tremble.

The two Principle Worlds were initially even-leveled with none able to win over the other. However, San Shouwang’s Principle World’s energy for some reason suddenly and radically surged!

In the blink of an eye, it kept pushing back Pei Qi’s Principle World.

Some energies went through and began affecting Pei Qi.

“What?”

The audience was shocked.

“Pei Qi’s Principle World is being directly repressed?” Jian Wushuang was stunned as well.

The sudden repression of the Principle World even caught Pei Qi by surprise. However, the situation had occurred and he could not allow himself to give way.

Finally, the purple beast barbarically charged clashed head-on with the Pei Qi’s crimson blade-light with its powerful energies.

The beast directly collided with the blade-light. At the same moment the collision took place, the crimson blade-light immediately turned dim and terrifying energy exploded.

Boom boom boom!!! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Infinite amounts of divine powers were violently swept in all directions.

The divine power shrouded the entire battlefield and brought forth a massive divine power storm.

Pei Qi and San Shouwang were in the eye of the storm and giving all they had to outplay each other.

The cultivators surrounding the Combat Ring could no longer see what was happening within the ring.

They could only wait for the divine power storm to die down and for the final result to present itself.

The divine power storm persisted for a long time before it began to gradually break apart.

The storm disappeared completely after a while and the two figures within were once again visible.

San Shouwang had once again reverted into his human form and so did Pei Qi’s divine body.

“Ah!” San Shouwang spat out a gulp of fresh blood with a pale face. The deep purple Divine Destruction Armor that shrouded him had cracked open that even his protective armor had a clear white mark—a blade strike mark.

The blade strike had broken through the Divine Destruction Armor, landed on his protective armor, and left him severely injured. However, though San Shouwang’s aura was a lot weaker he was still very much alive.

As for Pei Qi...

Pei Qi did not show any superficial injuries nor marks.

However, blood started streaming out of his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears.

Pei Qi’s eyes were bright red and staring deadly at San Shouwang.

“I won’t give in!!!”

Pei Qi growled. However, the signs of life had completely vanished after his growl as his divine body lifelessly limped and toppled forward.

“D-d-dead?”

“An Earth Ultimate God has just died like this?”

All the experts observing the battle from outside the Combat Ring were shocked.
