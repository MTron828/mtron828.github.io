4646 Three Wishes

With just one glance, Jian Wushuang realized that Feng Qi’s current situation was far more serious than he had imagined.

Her shattered divine soul was like wisps of smoke and clouds, dissipating without stopping. She could no longer hold it together.

If she did not belong to the Phoenix clan, one of the three ancient clans, that Void God’s attack would have been enough to kill her.

Perhaps sensing the intrusion of an external force, a bare-chested handsome young man stood up. When he was about to get angry and attack, he saw that it was Jian Wushuang, and the anger in his eyes turned into sadness.

“How’s the situation? Do you need me to do anything?” Jian Wushuang walked up quickly and asked.

The handsome young man wanted to say something, but he hesitated. In the end, he said, “I’m afraid that it will be very difficult for the Matriarch to get through this.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s heart sank. “That’s impossible. Don’t all the members of the Phoenix clan have the ability to be reborn? I’ve seen Feng Qi use it before. She recovered from the state of near-death very quickly.”

“That’s right. Our Phoenix clan can indeed undergo Nirvana. However, our Matriarch’s soul has already dispersed. We can’t even wake her up, so how can she undergo Nirvana?” The handsome young man’s eyes dimmed. “Even if the descendants of my clan worked together, we couldn’t wake her up.”

Looking at the dissipating soul that could not be suppressed even in the Nirvana Formation, he was afraid that if this continued, Feng Qi would really die.

Without thinking, Jian Wushuang said directly, “Can you let me enter the formation? I’d like to try.”

There was a flash of hesitation in the handsome young man’s eyes. However, before he could say anything, Jian Wushuang directly stepped into the formation.

“Ah!” An anxious voice came from behind, “You must hurry up. I’m afraid that the Matriarch might die at any moment.”

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang came to the center of the formation. He looked at Feng Qi, who was sleeping with her eyes closed, and slowly sat down in front of her.

“I’m coming.”

The scorching little flame dissipated with the wind.

Jian Wushuang seemed to be having a heart-to-heart talk with Feng Qi, telling her about the past. From the first time they met to the time they fought side by side, he described it as if he was talking about his family’s treasure.

“I’m very grateful for everything you’ve done. You saved my life in Rodu, and you also saved my wife’s life in the Offworld Battlefield without hesitation. I now owe you two lives. If you don’t wake up, I’m afraid I won’t be able to repay you.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“After you wake up, I’ll make three promises to you and the Phoenix clan. No matter where I am or when I am, these three promises will be valid forever.”

“In addition, I think that in the coming years, the Divine Power Universe will be too boring if there are no women like you.”

The calm words were accompanied by hair-thin flames that spread in the array.

The handsome young man who was like an ant on a hot pan outside the array had also stopped in his tracks at this moment. His eyes were fixed on the center of the array.

Feng Qi’s soul, which had been constantly dissipating, began to stop dissipating. At the same time, those scattered souls began to transform into the appearance of the little Fire Phoenix and quickly returned to her body.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang was overjoyed. He cut open his left wrist and the divine blood that belonged to a Perfect Life Form dripped on the left half of Feng Qi’s body.

The divine blood, which contained vigorous and tough life force, was like a vine, quickly repairing and nourishing Feng Qi’s broken body.

Her skin was filling up rapidly, and every meridian was being repaired. Feng Qi’s pale face was also turning red quickly.

After a long time, Feng Qi slowly opened her eyes and looked at Jian Wushuang, who was nourishing her with divine blood. She said, “I heard everything you said just now.”

Jian Wushuang, who was already a little dizzy, forced a smile and said, “It’s good that you heard me. If you didn’t, I would have wasted my breath.”

“Are you serious about what you said?” Feng Qi continued to ask.

Jian Wushuang nodded. “Naturally.”

Feng Qi looked happy. She did not notice Jian Wushuang’s pale face. “You don’t owe me anything. I saved you willingly.”

After bleeding for nearly half an incense’s time, even Jian Wushuang could not hold on any longer.

“Q-quickly undergo Nirvana. I can’t hold on much longer…”

Feng Qi finally came back to her senses. She hurriedly stood up and covered the wound on Jian Wushuang’s wrist with her hand. “You’re really a fool. You’ve lost so much life source origin blood. Aren’t you afraid of damaging your life source?”

Jian Wushuang shook his head slowly. “Don’t worry about me… Your matter is more important, so don’t delay it.”

“Then wait for me here, and don’t leave no matter what.” Feng Qi bit her lips. “If you leave, I won’t go into Nirvana.”

Jian Wushuang only felt dizzy and could not care about anything else. He could only nod repeatedly.

Feng Qi smiled, turned around, and walked away.

In front of her, a barrier that was burning with terrifying flames had been completely opened.

A pair of fiery wings suddenly spread out behind Feng Qi’s back, and then she entered the Fire Domain.

Her front foot left the ground, and Jian Wushuang fainted in the center of the formation.

The Phoenix clan’s descendants did not dare to step into the formation because of the Matriarch’s order. They could only try to control the fire so that Jian Wushuang, who was in the eye of the formation, would feel more comfortable.

Time passed by. Two days later, tens of thousands of fiery feathers suddenly shot out of the Fire Domain’s boundary that had been calm all this time.

At the same time, a beautiful and valiant-looking woman with a pair of fiery-red wings on her back rushed out.

After the successful rebirth, Feng Qi ran directly to Jian Wushuang, who was sleeping on the eye of the formation.

She raised her hand and cut her wrist as well. The divine blood with the Phoenix breath of the ancestral bloodline dripped into Jian Wushuang’s mouth.

The handsome young man standing at the periphery saw this and hurriedly said, “Matriarch, you must not!”

Feng Qi turned a deaf ear to it, and the ancestral blood of the Phoenix clan continued to drip into his mouth.

“Absorb it, you must absorb more.”

As the divine blood of the ancestral bloodline entered his throat, Jian Wushuang’s 10,000 meridians began to burn at the same time.

At the same time, the shadow of a Phoenix with its wings spread out and chirping appeared in the center of his chest, as if it was alive.

As for Feng Qi, after thinking for a while, she stretched out her right hand and quickly drew something on Jian Wushuang’s left arm.

Immediately, a simple Phoenix totem emerged and was immediately hidden under his skin.

After doing all this, Feng Qi giggled like a child, and then returned to her usual cold and lonely appearance.

Feng Qi did not withdraw her hand until the ancestral blood in Jian Wushuang’s body was full.

Everything calmed down and Jian Wushuang fell into a deep sleep again.

Feng Qi slowly walked out of the formation and said in a low voice, “You guys stay here and take good care of Palace Master Wushuang. Once there’s any news that he’s awake, inform me.”

The handsome young man nodded in agreement and then continued to carefully operate the formation.
