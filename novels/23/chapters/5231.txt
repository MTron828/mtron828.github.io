Chapter 5232 - 5232: The Power of Profound Techniques

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The blinding light persisted, but Leng Shuang and Si Tian managed to keep their distance. However, Dao Lord Xue Yue, blocked by Wan Xing, found himself drenched in cold sweat.

Moments before, he had been preparing to join the siege against Hu Qing. If Wan Xing hadn’t intercepted him, his fate might not have differed much from PO Jun’s.

PO Jun was already injured at that point. Even if the two of them had teamed up, they wouldn’t stand a chance against Hu Qing.

Dao Lord Wan Xing’s face mirrored shock. He was all too familiar with the aura that had erupted from that earlier strike; it was a top-tier martial technique, far more potent than the one he had cultivated.

Is this the favoritism of the Qishen Temple?

Wan Xing involuntarily gasped. That strike had possessed the power of a half-step Emperor.

And that wasn’t all. Among those present, only Jian Wushuang knew that Hu Qing was merely at the Nine Revolutions level!

To have half-step Emperor strength at the Nine Revolutions stage was terrifying. Even the fifth-order Emperors probably weren’t this monstrous when they reached the Grand Yan Immortal level.

Absolutely monstrous!

Jian Wushuang had mastered the Extreme Dao, barely reaching the Dao Lord level after advancing to the Nine Revolutions. In contrast, Hu Qing had directly achieved the half-step Emperor level.

Originally, Jian Wushuang had believed that upon entering the Nine Revolutions, he could leave all peers behind, truly becoming invincible at the same level. Now, it seemed he had been too optimistic.

Hu Qing was stronger than him. That was the reality.

The peripheral Grand Yan Immortals had all teleported millions of miles away.

The intense light made it impossible for them to see what had truly transpired.

When the light receded, PO Jun’s aura dissipated, but the aura of the Monster Monk Hu Qing still lingered.

“PO Jun has fallen?”

Someone couldn’t believe it. The Dao Lord, ranked second on the achievements board, had fallen!

“How is this possible? The Monster Monk actually managed to kill a Dao Lord!”

“The heavens are changing. Everyone, prepare to leave the Feather Continent!”

The Feather Transformation Continent was truly on the brink of upheaval. Now that Dao Lords were facing the risk of falling, let alone those at the half-step Emperor level.

Ranking of the Original Planet Alpha Nine, based on achievement points:

1st: Monster Monk Hu Qing

2nd: Dao Lord Xue Yue

3rd: Dao Lord Leng Shuang 4th: Dao Lord Si Tian

5th: Dao Lord Wan XingExpplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Hu Qing emerged victorious!

“Ten billion achievement points!” Hu Qing sighed inwardly. Originally, he had intended to share half of his achievements with Jian Wushuang, but unfortunately, PO Jun was unwilling to relinquish his token.

“Brother Wushuang!”

Hu Qing suppressed his aura, becoming milder, and swiftly moved to Jian Wushuang’s side.

“Brother Wushuang, I appreciate your help this time!”

However, Jian Wushuang seemed indifferent, shrugged, and said flatly, “It has nothing to do with me. Even if I didn’t come, they wouldn’t have been able to harm you!”

Not to mention the power of the light just now, just the strength that could suppress PO Jun in battle was sufficient to protect Hu Qing from other Dao Lords.

As for Dao Lord Wan Xing, even if Hu Qing wasn’t a match, he could still escape.

PO Jun ended up in this situation due to his initial carelessness. It was a surefire situation, but he lost his life and couldn’t escape.

The five Dao Lords were never a united group; they were ruthless individuals who took advantage of others’ weaknesses and aimed for their lives.

“These achievement points!” Hu Qing felt a bit embarrassed, holding his identity token in his hand.

Seeing his hesitation, Jian Wushuang patted his shoulder heavily and teased, “What’s the matter? It hasn’t even been a year, and you’re already feeling sorry for me? Don’t forget, you used to be a little novice monk clinging to my legs. I don’t need to rely on others’ achievements to climb up the rankings, right?”

Thinking back to the weak little novice monk who used to cling to his legs and now had become so powerful, Jian Wushuang sighed deeply. Fate really played tricks on people!

His former masters could rest in peace now.

Dao Lord Wan Xing frowned as he looked at Jian Wushuang and Hu Qing. Their relationship was extraordinary; otherwise, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t have directly confronted the Dao Lords without knowing anything.

It seemed like they were close friends to the point of life and death!

Such people were much more reliable than those so-called allies. Friends to the death, relationships that transcended life and death, during battles, you could entrust your back to them without worry.

It seemed that this turmoil was coming to an end now.

It was unrealistic to expect another battle now.

The trial had barely passed ten years, and it was not yet time for the final showdown.

Leng Shuang was injured, and her strength was insufficient. Xue Yue’s power was average. Among those who could truly fight on this Original Planet, there were only Hu Qing and him.

As for Jian Wushuang, although his methods were bizarre, in the face of absolute strength, all tricks and schemes were worthless.

Hu Qing turned around, his smile fading from his face, adopting an appearance of facing a formidable enemy.

“Wan Xing! ”

Jian Wushuang stood with hands behind his back, utterly composed. His Thought power was immense; not only did he outclass half-step Emperors, even Emperors paled in comparison. He could sense the battle intent emanating trom Dao Lorcl wan Xing Dut no resolve.

In this fight, it was likely that Dao Lord Wan Xing would fall, and the fight would turn into a matter of pride.

Having obtained the inheritance and mastered profound techniques, they willingly came here as whetstones. For Hu Qing, not crossing over meant certain death. But if he succeeded, he would transform like a carp leaping over the dragon gate, and this Original Planet would cease to be a threat.

The throne of the first was incredibly secure, impervious to any challenge.

However, others lacked Jian Wushuang’s powerful Thought power, unable to probe others at will.

What they saw was another impending battle of world-shattering proportions. Fear crept in; they worried that these Dao Lords might suddenly sweep over them. They retreated tens of millions of miles away, maintaining a safe distance.

“Let the battle continue! When you’re all dead, I, Ji Chaoyang, will be the first.” Ji Chaoyang, second only to Dao Lords in strength, remained remarkably low-key. He had both the inheritance and profound techniques, not to mention an abundance of treasures. Besides strength, he shared many similarities with God -Emperor MO Long.

While MO Xuan’s strength capped at Perfected Grand Yan Immortal, he managed to reach the half-step Dao Lord level, approaching the level of actual Dao Lords.

“No, they won’t really fight, will they?” Everyone held their breaths, their throats tight with anxiety.

If another battle erupted, oddly enough, it could favor them. The top-tier powerhouses were nearly obliterated, leaving them at the apex.

Yet, there was one thing they dreaded. Regardless of who won or lost, the survivor would become the mightiest on this Original Planet, unbound and unrestrained, free to slaughter at will.

That prospect was beyond their imagination!

At that point, beneath the Dao Lords, everyone would be insignificant, devoid of distinctions, all prey.

Gulp!

Many watched the slightest movement of the two, as if trying to grasp that split second when they would act.

The core figures, apart from Jian Wushuang, clenched their fists, sweat in their palms evidence of their extreme tension.

The aura of Dao Lord Wan Xing rose like an ascending dragon, making him seem the master of the entire void.

It was a sign of stepping into the threshold of the origin source of space, a concept that terrified even Jian Wushuang.. The origin source of space!
