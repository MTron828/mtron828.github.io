Currently, he only sees the tip of the iceberg, and more crystals lie beneath the sea.

Even reaching the peak of his soul realm doesn't guarantee the complete integration of all crystals.

This requires assistance from the spatial realm.

Once the spatial realm reaches the level of a black hole, he can quickly devour and fuse these crystals.

"Continue!"

Though small, every advancement in his soul brings the fusion of many crystals and a purer strength.

The first time, he ascended 2,000 steps in one go.

This time, he ascended 800.

He has caught up with Emperor Tianchan, the top-level Emperor among the tier 6f.

Chasing these people is nothing. Since entering, he hasn't seen a single Inheritor.

He hasn't even glimpsed Broly's silhouette.

Perhaps their speed is faster than his, even though he entered earlier.

They shouldn't have distanced themselves so much!

The higher the soul realm, the farther he can see.

Now he can discern those within 100 steps in front of him.

Once muddled, his eyes are now as sharp as thunder and lightning.

Cross-legged, he continues to cultivate, elevating the Sea of Extreme Dao.

And so, the cycle repeats.

After an unknown period, Jian Wushuang finally encounters a familiar face.

"Emperor Wan Xing!"

104 steps away from Wan Xing, Jian Wushuang is delighted.

It has been thousands of years since they parted ways after the Original Planet.

Now, not only has the other party successfully integrated Dao, but it seems he has also become a disciple of Situ Nan. He's thriving now.

Situ Nanis the deputy hall master of the Enforcement Hall in the Elder Palace, with strength comparable to the supreme-peak.

He wields immense power in the Heavenly Realm, and taking Situ Nan as a master practically means striding with authority in the Heavenly Realm.

However, the current Wan Xing seems to be more restrained.

Gone is the once domineering aura, replaced by a subtle presence.

It's like that of an ordinary cultivator, taking each step carefully, contemplating for a long time with each step before advancing again.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang quickly caught up, turned to glance at Wan Xing, expressionless, and effortlessly surpassed him.

Seeing Jian Wushuang overtake, Wan Xing was somewhat surprised, but it was only a momentary surprise. He then continued to immerse himself in the comprehension of his secret technique.

5000th step.

Snap!

As Jian Wushuang stepped in, his figure flashed and disappeared from the original spot.

"At this place, the eternal changes!"

Jian Wushuang hadn't reacted yet when he heard an ancient voice, surprisingly in the ancient language he could understand.

"Cultivator, you've climbed 5,000 steps, indicating that your soul has reached the threshold of the 30,000 Halls Heavenly Lord. You can choose any Transformation Dao method here."

Jian Wushuang saw the scenery in front of him clearly.

A colossal ancient hall with many thrones above, and floating in the uppermost space was a gigantic skull, resembling a mythical beast. The voice seemed to come from there.

A reward of a complete set of Dao methods?

Jian Wushuang revealed a joyful expression.

The Transformation Dao!

It belongs to a very special Origin Source Dao, even rarer than the Ultimate Dao.

And the methods of the Transformation Dao are even scarcer.

Although he is not a practitioner of the Transformation Dao, the Extreme Dao contains elements of it, and the Transformation Dao can change everything.

No matter what he cultivates, he can incorporate the principles of the Transformation Dao.

This is somewhat like the Extreme Dao, but while the Extreme Dao encompasses All Things, the Transformation Dao changes and alters All Things, fundamentally different.

Divine Demon Body Refinement.

Jian Wushuang took a jade slip from the nearest throne and examined it carefully.

It was a manual on body refinement, similar to the one in the Demon-sealing Space.

However, he didn't need this one.

After a brief glance, he put it back.

"Slaying Gods!"

"Demonic Eyes!"

Various techniques, Jian Wushuang glanced at them and abandoned, as they didn't seem very suitable.

These thrones seemed to follow a sequence; the closer to the front, the more powerful the techniques.

Jian Wushuang wasn't in a hurry, systematically inspecting each one.

After inspecting tens of thousands of techniques, he realized that if these were revealed, they might attract the appearance Zhen Ling.

No wonder Bai Junwang had said that the Three King Court, in ancient times, could rival the Qishen Temple.

Indeed extraordinary.

There were so many techniques at this level.

Moreover, these techniques seemed to be created by supreme-peak level experts.

At the top, there were more than ten thrones whose techniques Jian Wushuang didn't have the authority to view.

"Cultivator, you need to reach 10,000 steps to select techniques from the thrones above."

Jian Wushuang stepped back, respectfully saluting, "For the time being, this junior has no need. I would like to continue ascending."

"Very well!"

The giant beast opened its mouth and swallowed Jian Wushuang whole.

Continue ascending!

Mainly because most of the profound arts he obtained were out of the ordinary. ƒêiscover nùíÜw chaptùíÜrs ùíên n0ùíóe(l)biùíè(.)com

The Heavenly Demon Technique is a supreme-peak level technique.

Even though he hadn't perfected its cultivation, he was not inclined to delve into such advanced studies anymore.

If he were to learn, he would choose the strongest; the ordinary ones didn't interest him.

He continued on his journey.

It didn't take long before he encountered a familiar face, although they weren't exactly close. It was a tier 5 peak-level Emperor from the Elder Palace.

Surprisingly, he kept encountering several of these old fellows. Despite their age, their insights were comparable to Wan Xing.

Glancing back, he saw Wan Xing trailing 200 steps behind him.

The higher the realm of the soul, the clearer one's vision became. Beyond 5,000 steps, he could even make out scenes 300 steps away.

As he progressed, he realized that the fragments of information he gained formed a rudimentary soul technique when linked together.

When he subtly manipulated it, his entire being trembled, and a force emerged in the palm of his hand.

The power of the Soul Dao was peculiar, similar to the Transformation Dao.

Jian Wushuang speculated that one of the three kings in the Three Kings Court likely cultivated the Soul Dao.

Otherwise, they wouldn't have attached their Soul Dao secret technique to the steps.

Upon careful examination, he discerned that this secret technique had roughly five layers.

Despite nearing 7,000 steps, he had yet to fully grasp even the first layer.

It seemed that he might only understand it after reaching 1,000 steps, making it more demanding than the requirements for the Transformation Dao, which needed 5,000 steps.

The threshold for the Transformation Dao was set at 5,000 steps since it was not his main cultivation path.

"Island Lord Gui Ling?"

Once again, a figure appeared before Jian Wushuang. It was indeed Gui Ling, reaching here at such a fast pace, proving the extraordinary strength of a tier 6 peak-level expert.

Despite any flaws in the Origin Source, the soul remained flawless.

As Jian Wushuang caught up, Gui Ling remained indifferent, steadily advancing.

At 5,000 steps, he also visited the Eternal Transformation Pavilion and learned a shocking truth‚Äîflawed Origin Source.

The realization that his Origin Source was defective was something only a few peak experts in the Four Great Secret Realms were aware of.

Unable to progress further, they began to doubt themselves.

Gui Ling, not having reached the true peak of the Emperor tier, obviously lacked this awareness.

Now that he understood, he felt a mix of disappointment and surprise.

The surprise came from discovering a method in the Eternal Transformation Pavilion to help him restore his flawed Origin Source.

Jian Wushuang's Origin Source was flawless, and he remained oblivious to these intricacies.
