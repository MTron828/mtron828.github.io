“I really do want the jade sword.”

Emperor God Liu Guang lifted her head and looked at Jian Wushuang, “However, there is a total of ten jade swords. Even though there are a few that are lost, there are still some remaining. Plus, it will be still a long time until the next opening of Blood Cloud Palace. In this period of time, I can totally look for it slowly on my own. With my power and my position, it will definitely not be difficult for me to find one. I don’t have to cae about the jade sword in your hand.”

Jian Wushuang’s face changed slightly. He knew what Emperor God Liu Guang said was a fact.

Although the token to enter Blood Cloud Palace was rare and precious, if Emperor God Liu Guang were to spend some time and effort to look for it slowly, she would be able to find it. It wasn’t too high of a price to pay.

“Emperor God Liu Guang, if you help, I will owe you a favor,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Oh?” Emperor God Liu Guang was surprised.

Although she was dying to get the jade sword, she wasn’t in a hurry. Jian Wushuang couldn’t convince her with the jade sword.

But with the addition of Jian Wushuang’s favor, the deal was entirely different.

One should know that if Jian Wushuang could breakthrough and become an Almighty, he would possess fighting power of a Great Emperor. He might even reach the level of Emperor Bai.

Although he would come across countless dangers and unexpected incidents during the process, there was a high hope after all.

“A possible Great Emperor-to-be who could be side-by-side with Emperor Bai, a favor from him is hard to come by,” Emperor Liu Guang nodded and stood up, “Jian Wushuang, I agree to make a trip to Deluge Fortress with you, but there’s one thing… I will only attack once. After the fight with Deluge Fortress, regardless of if you reach your goal to kill all the Almighties or not, I will not attack again.”

“Okay,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He intended to destroy Deluge Fortress in one shot anyway. It was naturally unnecessary to attack the second time.

“If so, let’s move now,” Emperor God Liu Guang said.

Jian Wushuang immediately made a move with Emperor God Liu Guang and Emperor God Liu Guang entered the ancient spaceship that Jian Wushuang had come in.

“Master,” Jian Yi stood next to Jian Wushuang.

“Sword Emperor, this is…?” Emperor God Liu Guang glanced at Jian Yi. In her eyes, Jian Yi was just an ordinary person.

“He’s my servant. He takes care of my daily living. He doesn’t have any power,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Oh?” Emperor God Liu Guang understood.

Very quickly, the ancient spaceship departed.

…

In the dark void outside Abysmal Sanctuary, the ancient spaceship stopped in silence.

“Sword Emperor, what are we doing outside Abysmal Sanctuary?” Emperor God Liu Guang asked.

“Don’t be in a hurry, let’s wait,” Jian Wushuang said.

“It seems like you have other helpers. Well, that makes sense. Deluge Fortress gathered thirteen Almighties and there are Fortress Master Hong Tina and Emperor God Bing Can in commanding position. To kill all of them, Lineage of Star definitely has to turn out its full force. Would the Master of Star Palace be involved this time as well?” Emperor God Liu Guang said.

Jian Wushuang didn’t explain but continued to wait.

A few months later, a black spaceship drove over. Then, a black-robed, evil-looking young man walked out of the spaceship and entered Jian Wushuang’s silver spaceship.

“Sword Emperor, oh, Emperor God Liu Guang is here too?”

The black-robed young man was calm when he saw Jian Wushuang, but he revealed a reverent look when he saw Emperor God Liu Guang.

Emperor God Liu Guang was a superb existence in the twenty-seventh place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

“Emperor God Jiu Yin? You asked him too?” Emperor God Liu Guang looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly then he flipped his hand and took out a spear that gave out boundless chilliness. He passed it to the black-robed young man, Emperor God Jiu Yin.

“Emperor God Jiu Yin, this is your reward. What do you think?” Jian Wushuang said.

“It’s really a Chaotic Divine Treasure and the power seems strong too,” there was passion burning in Emperor God Jiu Ying’s eyes.

He wasn’t close to Jian Wushuang. The reason why he had rushed over was that Jian Wushuang had sent him a text and said that the reward would be a Chaotic Divine Treasure.

Chaotic Divine Treasure, even an ordinary Emperor God wouldn’t have one. Only an Emperor God with extremely strong power would have at most only two of the items.

Just like Emperor God Jiu Ying, he only had a simple attack Chaotic Divine Treasure.

Then, he was only going to offer Jian Wushuang a helping hand to barge into Deluge Fortress so he would be able to get a Chaotic Divine Treasure. Emperor God Jiu Yin of course wouldn’t decline.

“Sword Emperor lives up to his name. You are quite generous,” Emperor God Liu Guang glanced at Jian Wushuang.

“It’s only a Chaotic Divine Treasure. Now I get to invite an Emperor God experts who was on the forty-ninth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list to join forces with me. It’s very worthy,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Although Emperor God Jiu Yin wasn’t a Peak Emperor God, he was very close to one. His close combat skill was extremely scary and it would be best to use it to massacre some Sir Gods.

“I have something to tell the two of you ahead of time,” Jian Wushuang looked at Emperor God Liu Guang and Emperor God Jiu Yin and said, “There are only three of us who are going to barge into Deluge Fortress.”

“What?” Emperor God Jiu Yin’s face instantly grew grave.

Emperor God Liu Guang also looked at Jian Wushuang in shock.

“Sword Emperor, you’re joking, right? The three of us can fight evenly with the thirteen Almighties led by Fortress Master Hong Tian? Plus, Fortress Master Hong Tian and the others knew that you’re coming after them, they will definitely make preparations ahead of time. Who knows, by then, we might be dealing with more than thirteen, maybe fifteen or more,” Emperor God Jiu Yin said.

“With the three of us, if we were to fight with Fortress Master Hong Tian and the others altogether, we might only have a fifty percent chance of winning,” Emperor God Liu Guang remained cold. “Sword Emperor, you paid a huge price to invite myself and Emperor God Jiu Yin. You won’t only do it for a fifty percent winning chance, right?”

“Of course not,” Jian Wushuang smiled. Then, he flipped his hands. There were immediately four silver-armored, brawny figures that appeared next to him.

“This is… Dao soldiers?” Emperor God Liu Guang was shocked.

“Emperor God Liu Guang, you know them?” Jian Wushuang was surprised too. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Emperor God Liu Guang nodded, “Once when I wandered in Ancient Mystery Land, I met similar Dao soldiers. It is said that Dao soldiers are substantiated with ancient tribe experts’ blood essence. There are a few levels and these four silver-armored Dao soldiers should have the power of an ordinary Emperor God. The four of them together should be able to match evenly with an Emperor God.

“In addition of the four Dao soldiers, our winning chance should increase by ten percent.”

“Sixty percent?” Jian Wushuang smiled, “Don’t worry. When I’m here, there won’t only be a sixty percent winning chance.”

“Let’s go.”

The huge silver spaceship immediately plunged in the direction of Abysmal Sanctuary at a terrifyingly fast speed.

An earth-shattering war was coming.
