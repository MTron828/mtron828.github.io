Chapter 2643: Kill Them All

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“The two of you want to kill me?” A trace of disdain flashed in the Scorpion King’s eyes.

Although Bai Tu and Li Qianji were Grand Ultimate Gods, their strength was only average at most. Scorpion King could easily battle two such Grand Ultimate Gods without suffering a disadvantage.

“Hehe. The two of us are certainly not enough, but what if she joins us?” Li Qianji cracked a strange smile.

A black-robed cultivator’s aura suddenly rose to the Grand Ultimate God level and was even stronger than Bai Tu and Li Qianji from among the group of black-robed people.

“Long time no see, Scorpion King.”

An icy-cold voice came from a blue-haired woman who had a cold and desolate appearance.

“Gu Ji?” The Scorpion King’s complexion finally changed.

He did not care much when it was only Bai Tu and Li Qianji, but it was a different matter with the blue-haired Gu Ji around.

Although Gu Ji was only a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God, she was extremely strong among those of similar level and was not much weaker than the Scorpion King. Scorpion King had fought Gu Ji many years ago and only gained a slight upper hand.

“Scorpion King, give the Interspatial Ring containing those Blood Gems in your hands to me,” said the blue-haired Gu Ji indifferently.

“Dream on.” Scorpion King gave her a cold stare before he instantly became aggressive.

Those Blood Gems were of great value and meant a lot for the Crimson Stone Fort.

The pressure on Yin Su’er could be relieved quickly upon obtaining the Blood Gems.

The Scorpion King would never hand over this batch of Blood Gems in vain for that reason alone.

“I can see that you won’t accept the loss. We’ll just have to kill first if that’s the case,” said Gu Ji coldly.

“Go kill them! Spare no one!” Li Qianji coldly said.

The killing intent in those more than 40 Heaven Ultimate Gods from Divine Demons Sect and Life and Death Tower surged upon hearing her command!

“Kill!”

“Kill them all!”

“Haha. Divine Demon Sect, let’s see who kills more!”

The earth-shattering screams and yelling resounded as more than 40 Heaven Ultimate Gods attacked like hungry wolves.

The Crimson Stone Fort had only sent a dozen Heaven Ultimate Gods which caused the combat power between both groups to be disproportionate. Crimson Stone Fort could only do their best to defend and resist the attacks.

“Oops!”

“There’s a big problem!”

The Official Army felt their scalps numbed upon seeing the combat powers of 40 Heaven Ultimate Gods.

They knew they were no match for those Heaven Ultimate Gods.

“Retreat. Retreat. Get back to the edge!” Jian Wushuang immediately ordered.

The Official Army retreated without any hesitation.

They never wanted to participate in the war, and neither was there any need for them to do so. The Divine Demon Sect and the Life and Death Tower were not targeting them after all.

However, the combat power between both groups was disproportionate when the battle began with many Heaven Ultimate Gods from Divine Demon Sect and the Life and Death Tower had no opponents, so they started targeting the Official Army.

“Official Army? Humph, they must have secretly gained a lot of benefits from guarding this area for so long and probably also have a lot of Blood Gems on them. Let’s kill them too!”

“Kill them all!”

Several Heaven Ultimate Gods immediately chased after the Official Army.

“Damn it!”

Cang Heng and the other commanders panicked when they saw that.

“Quick! Get into formation and block their attacks.” Cang Heng let out a stern cry as four Official Army commanders took action together while they continued to retreat.

Four gushes of powers erupted, but each of those powers only reached the level of a High-level Earth Ultimate God.

Such power level was simply a joke in the eyes of Heaven Ultimate Gods.

“Funny!”

One of the Heaven Ultimate Gods sneered and instantly routed the four powers with just a hand wave. There was a terrifying power acting on the four army formations at the same time. Although the impact received by the four army formations was equally shared, every soldier in the four thousand troops including the four commanders grunted upon being hit by the impact. Some of them with weaker physical protective abilities had traces of blood dripping from the corners of their mouths.

“They’re just like ants. Kill them all.”

The more than three meters tall burly old man stretched out his palm and gathered a surge of divine power in the void before him. A huge dark cloud was formed and covered a large number of soldiers below in the blink of an eye.

The terrifying power contained in the dark cloud frightened every soldier and commander—caused them to fall into despair.

That kind of power was not something they could resist using their military formation.

In the nick of time...

Boom!

A huge black awl pierced through the void and with its terrifying power and instantly bombarded the dark cloud.

The dark cloud which was completely formed using divine power obviously could not withstand the attack’s impact before it collapsed and dissipated.

“What?”

The burly old man was surprised and immediately looked at the void next to him. There was a golden-robed young man with a longsword standing in the void coldly staring back at him. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“An Earth Ultimate God?” The burly old man frowned.

An Earth Ultimate God blocked the blow he had just released?

“Territorial Lord. It’s the Territorial Lord!”

“The Territorial Lord has taken action!”

The Official Army soldiers were very pleasantly surprised.

“What are you doing? Why aren’t you standing back?” Jian Wushuang rebuked in a low voice.

“Yes, yes.” The Official Army knew what Jian Wushuang meant and retreated to the battlefield’s edge under the guidance of several commanders such as Cang Heng.

The burly old man along with another two Heaven Ultimate Gods who attempted to attack the Official Army earlier did not chase after them but gathered together. The three stood side by side while looking at Jian Wushuang with interest.

“Territorial Lord... You’re the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord, right?”

“You’re just a Peak Earth Ultimate God but you can parry off and defeat the attack of a Heaven Ultimate God. How interesting!”

“He was displaying a sword formation, right? The Transmigration Power in the formation was so strong. I heard that someone bought the Transmigration Sword Formation manual created by the Sword Lord Tong Xin with forty million Primordial Stones in an auction held by the Star Picking Pavilion not long ago. It seems that person was the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord.”

“An Earth Ultimate God who managed to become a Territorial Lord and have forty million Primordial Stones. He must be rich! He must have also gained a lot of benefits from the Blood Gem mineral vein in his Northern Darkstar Territory. I’m afraid that his current net worth is much more than any of us—Heaven Ultimate God!”

“Won’t his wealth be ours after we kill him?”

The three Heaven Ultimate Gods grinned at each other.
