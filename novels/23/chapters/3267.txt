The betting was settled, and soon Jian Wushuang and Light King were ready to fight.

Underworld Emperor, Di Hao, and the others immediately stepped aside to make way for an empty battlefield.

The experts who were looking for opportunities around Blood Wave Temple noticed what was happening.

“What’s going on? It seems like the Light King is going to fight with the Heavenly Sword Marquis?”

“Yes, they are going to fight, and it was the Light King who took the initiative to go up. However, they shouldn’t be fighting to see who is stronger. After all, the Light King is definitely the strongest. The reason they are fighting now should be because of the number one offensive power!”

“The first place in attack power?” Although the Light King was publicly acknowledged to be the strongest, the Heavenly Sword Marquis killed the Nine Temples Saintess with one sword attack. Then, he was recognized as the first place in attack power by the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Now, if the two of them were just fighting for the strongest power, the outcome would not be certain!”

“In my opinion, the Light King will definitely win. After all, he has merged the two principles, and his strength is unfathomable. In terms of attack power, the power of the combination of the two principles is too strong.”

“That’s not necessarily true. You didn’t see the scene where Heavenly Sword Marquis killed the Nine Temples Saintess. Although the Nine Temples Saintess has less than 50% of her divine power left, I dare say that the Light King is absolutely incapable of doing that.”

Many experts expressed their views on the fight between Jian Wushuang and the Light King. Some thought that the Light King’s attack power was the strongest, but many also thought that Jian Wushuang’s unique skill was the best. After all, even the ranking on the True Saint List said so.

But who had the strongest attack power was about to be revealed.

In the vast void, Jian Wushuang and the Light King were facing each other from a distance.

“Light King, you attack first.” Jian Wushuang appeared very casual.

“Then I won’t be polite.” The Light King smiled faintly, and the cyan long stick on his back appeared in front of him. As he held the long stick in his right hand, in an instant, a dense wave of light and wind principles surged out.

The power of these two great principles was incomparably dense. Clearly, the Light King’s comprehension of these two principles had already reached the limit of a True Saint. and the most terrifying thing was that after these two great principles surged out...they directly fused together at the fastest speed.

When the new power emerged after the two principles merged, everyone present was filled with fear and gratitude.

Among the many Immortal Saints in the Divine Beginning Realm, only the Light King could merge the two principles.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, what I’m going to use next is my most powerful move. I created it many years ago after merging the two principles. So far, I’ve only used this move four times. Three times, I killed an Invincible Saint, and the last time, I killed eight Peak Saints in one breath!

“Extermination!”

“I named this move...extermination!”

Light King stared at Jian Wushuang with sparkling eyes, and his leisurely voice spread throughout the surrounding area of Blood Wave Temple.

Hearing his words, there was a commotion among the surrounding spectators.

Extermination. Just from the name alone, it could be seen how terrifying this move would be.

“I’ll wait and see.” Jian Wushuang still smiled faintly, showing no signs of wanting to make a move.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, be careful!” Light King finally made his move.

He held the cyan-colored long stick in both hands at the same time. The cyan-colored long stick, which was less than two meters long, suddenly expanded to three meters long, like a small mountain. On this ‘small mountain’...the principles of light and the principles of wind were perfectly combined, and a destructive power slowly condensed.

“One strike...extermination!”

The cyan staff in the hand of Light King finally smashed down.

Boom!

The world suddenly trembled, and the void seemed to be completely collapsed.

The mighty cyan staff shadow, with a terrifying aura that shocked everyone present, directly smashed toward Jian Wushuang.

At this moment, the entire world fell into a dead silence. Everyone stared at the cyan staff shadow with wide eyes. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“This Light King really hid his strength!” Di Hao shouted in his heart.

He had fought with Light King directly, but Light King had easily defeated him with the combined power of two principles. At that time, Light King did not use the combined power of two principles to perform his ultimate move.

“This strike is too powerful!”

A trace of shock appeared in the eyes of Underworld Emperor and Tie Ta.

While everyone was in a state of shock, under the cyan staff shadow, Jian Wushuang’s face turned cold as he watched the cyan staff shadow smashing toward him.

“Heaven-cleaving skill!”

Buzz!

Strong pressure from the life level directly burst out from Jian Wushuang’s body.

This pressure ignored the strength of both sides and the realm level. It was the pressure from the most fundamental life level.

The most important thing was that this pressure could not be resisted.

Light King’s aura was overwhelming, and his eyes were shining. He was very confident in his most powerful strike. None of the Immortal Saints could resist this strike.

That was why he wanted to compete with Jian Wushuang in terms of offensive power and even took the gamble.

However, at this moment, the supreme life-level pressure from Jian Wushuang suddenly came into effect.

Under this supreme pressure, the expression on Light king’s face instantly froze!

“What, what is this?” There was a trace of fear in Light King’s eyes. Under this pressure, his consciousness seemed to have come to a halt. And what he had used was an earth-shaking strike, at this moment, the power of the strike was reduced by nearly half.

Then, Jian Wushuang struck.

He simply raised the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand and struck out with it.

In the eyes of everyone around him, his strike was very ordinary.

However, when they were fighting for the eighth Blood Wave Token, Underworld Emperor and Tie Ta had seen with their own eyes that Jian Wushuang had used such an ordinary strike to kill the Nine Temples Saintess, who had nearly 50% of her divine power.

Now, the same sword move collided with Light King’s cyan long staff in an instant.

Then...bang!

With a deafening sound, the overwhelming power spread out crazily. In the middle of the battlefield, a cyan long staff was thrown out, and Light King’s body was shot out like a cannonball, finally, it smashed into the formation light membrane surrounding Blood Wave Temple.

The array light film, under the impact of the Light King, slightly trembled.
