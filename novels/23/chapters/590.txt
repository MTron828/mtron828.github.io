Chapter 591: Blood Bladesman

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“No, impossible!”

Fire Ghost lay prostrate in the pit. The terrifying killing intent had suppressed him and shattered his bones.?Blood poured profusely from his mouth. His face was red and there was unprecedented shock in his eyes.

The oppression of the killing intent was similar to aura oppression.

Just now, he had forced Jian Xinhong to fall and faint by using aura oppression.

He was able to do this because he was much more powerful than Jian Xinhong.

Now, this young man had just used killing intent to suppress him. It had been strong enough to cause him to fall and his bones to crack.

How was that possible?

Even the sovereigns or Three Ancestors were not as strong as this.

Jian Wushuang, who had been forced to flee from the Divine Land, and who he held in contempt, had managed to perform this impossible feat.

Fire Ghost was dumbfounded, but he suddenly had a strong desire to survive.

“Blood Bladesman! Master Blood Bladesman!”

“Help me, please come help me!” Fire Ghost roared.

He knew that Blood Bladesman was hidden nearby and that he would come over if he noticed something happening here.

If Blood Bladesman came, he would still have an opportunity to survive.

The Drill Ground turned deathly silent.

The clansmen looked at Jian Wushuang as they trembled in excitement.

They had been yelling his name in their hearts. Their hero had finally shown up and his strength did not disappoint.

Fire Ghost was a devil and very powerful, but compared to Jian Wushuang, he was as weak as an infant.

Jian Wushuang had not even displayed any of his moves. He had merely used aura oppression on the Evil Marquis to overcome him. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

What terrifying strength! What a frightening skill!

“How, how is this possible?”

Experts from the Alchemy School and the Imperial House of the Tianzong Dynasty, and even the white-haired elder who had just returned from the Divine Land, widened their eyes in shock.

“This, this is the Evil Marquis, who is the strongest among the 72 Marquises. Sovereigns could defeat him, but they won’t be able to do so using aura alone. Even if the legendary Three Ancestors show up, they might not have such a power.”

Under everyone’s gazes, Jian Wushuang’s gaze was steely as his killing intent violently pressed on Fire Ghost.

“Evil Marquis,” Jian Wushuang said in a frosty tone, “you’re still hoping that Blood Bladesman will come to your aid, right?”

Fire Ghost was unable to move or speak under the oppression.

“It’s a pity...” Jian Wushuang looked at Fire Ghost while shaking his head. “You won’t have such an opportunity.”

Jian Wushuang raised his foot and stomped on his enemy’s head.

The terrifying power landed squarely on the panic-stricken Evil Marquis. In the next moment, his head shattered into pieces.

The famous Evil Marquis, the number one expert of the 72 Marquises, died.

He had trampled on the clansmen from Sword Marquis Mansion.

Now, he had become a corpse.

Jian Wushuang wore a grim expression as he surveyed the area. “Blood Bladesman, you’ve been watching for so long. It’s time you revealed yourself.”

The moment Jian Wushuang finished his words, a figure flashed and appeared on the Drill Ground.

The figure was a skinny elder who was as scruffy as a beggar and had a hint of evil in his eyes.

Blood Bladesman was one of the Skyscraping Realm experts who had forced Jian Wushuang to escape from the Divine Land.

He was also one of the murderers responsible for the death of the Sword Ancestor.

“Hey hey, I came here to try my luck. I wondered whether I’ll be able to find the cave mansion Sword Ancestor left. It seems that I made the right decision.” Blood Bladesman had an evil smile on his face. “Jian Wushuang, those old guys have been looking for you. They didn’t expect that you’ve quietly returned.”

“That’s fine. Since you’re back, I don’t need to expend too much energy searching for Sword Ancestor Cave Mansion.”

Blood Bladesman stared with the young man, not concealing his surprise and delight.

He had come to the Nanyang Continent to get the location of Ancestor’s Land from the clansmen in Sword Marquis Mansion. He had let Evil Marquis torture the clansmen for three days, but he had not obtained what he sought.

He had been disappointed and ready to give up but Jian Wushuang had appeared. How could he not be happy?

“Tell me. Where is the cave mansion? I’ll spare your life if you tell me,” Blood Bladesman said in an evil tone.

“Blood Bladesman, are you done with your nonsense?” Jian Wushuang glanced at him, expressionless.

“Hum?” Blood Bladesman sneered. “Boy, don’t think you’re powerful just because you’ve killed Fire Ghost. That’s right. Your killing intent is strong. If I’m not wrong, you’ve comprehended Slaughter Dao, but that’s only enough to deal with some Cloud Realm experts. It’s useless against me.”

“Stop talking.” Jian Wushuang shook his head. He was tired of this elder’s nonsense. His Heart-killing Sword appeared in his hand.

He had been able to kill Fire Ghost with ease but he now faced Blood Bladesman, a real Skyscraping Realm expert. Jian Wushuang would need to use his weapon if he wanted to kill the elder.

His 330-feet Golden Sword Soul Phantom suddenly appeared behind him.

The Heart-killing Sword lashed out.

The seventh move of the Heart-killing Sword Technique, Star River!

The brilliant strike provided the only light in the entire area as it pierced through the void and appeared in front of Blood Bladesman.

Its power erupted.
