Chapter 1352: Arrival

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

One month later.

“Finally!”

On the spaceship, Jian Wushuang was rather delighted.

In the Ancient Star Sea, there was danger everywhere. Even if it was just him in the Ancient Star Sea, he would be on high alert at all times. Now that the spaceship had left the Ancient Star Sea region entirely, Jian Wushuang was finally relaxed.

“Jian Wushuang, you want to head to the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries and I have to send Yu and Hai to their hometown. We shall part ways in the World before us,” Duan Lingfeng said.

“Alright,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

After the journey in Ancient Star Sea, especially when they joined forces to kill the expert from Sky Devour Clan, Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng built a relationship.

Jina Wushuang was more than happy to make friends with a real expert like Duan Lingfeng who valued friendship.

However, they each had their own agenda. Hence, they naturally had to part ways.

Soon, the spaceship arrived in the World.

“Duan Lingfeng, I hope we cross path again in the future,” Jian Wushuang bid farewell to the other three.

“Wait ’til I send Yu and Hai back to their hometown, I will wander around the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries too. By then, we might meet again!” Duan Lingfeng said, “I’d like it if when I see you, you’re already a Universe God in the Third Heaven!”

“Haha, I will try,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“Brother Wushuang, goodbye.”

Luo Yu and Luo Hai bid farewell to Jian Wushuang and left.

In the boundless darkness of the void, a spaceship slowly traveled.

“Jian Wushuang, as you passed through Ancient Star Sea, the following route is comparatively safe. However, the journey is long,” King of Venomous Worms’ voice was heard, “your current location to the nearest sanctuaries would require a thousand years under the condition that there is no interruption. Besides, during the last part of the route, there is the boundless void that I was telling you about!”

“The boundless void is where massacres happen widely. Many experts and geniuses who want to head to the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries lost their lives when they were passing through the boundless void. Hence, you have to be extremely careful when you’re there.”

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

“Let’s go.”

Jian Wushuang continued his journey.

In the following time, Jian Wushuang passed as he hurried through his journey and cultivated.

During the process, luckily King of Venomous Worms always took the form of a human and kept Jian Wushuang company. That’s why Jian Wushuang didn’t find it too boring.

On the way, he didn’t come across too much of an incident. In the journey of his passing by all the Kingdoms and Worlds, it was rather smooth until he reached the boundless void.

The boundless void was right next to the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. Due to its geological location, the massacre was insane and the robbery was even more rampant.

Jian Wushuang knew about how dangerous the boundless void was. Hence, when he entered the range of boundless void, he had been rather careful. Even so, when he passed through the boundless void, he came across two huge dangers, and both threatened his life.

During the first time, he happened to run into a final battle between two gangs of robbers. One party was defeated while the other winning party started a massacre. All cultivators in the region were affected and the same went for Jian Wushuang. He was surrounded by over a hundred Universe Gods. He could only pull the secret skill of dragon blood and made a narrow escape.

As for the second time, he ran into a mad man who was cultivating in the boundless void! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The mad man was a Universe God in the Third Heaven. Not only was he strong, but he also loved killing. He wandered around the boundless void and killed whatever cultivator that he met, regardless if the person offended him or not.

Jian Wushuang met the mad man and the mad man took action immediately. Jian Wushuang couldn’t resist at all and it was even difficult for him to run away. In the end, Jian Wushuang performed the secret skill of Tian Yuan under duress. It led to severe injuries of the mad man by catching him by surprise. It also shocked the mad man.

The mad man was worried that Jian Wushuang could still perform another similar consciousness attack. Hence, he didn’t continue to pester Jian Wushuang. That’s why Jian Wushuang got his life back.

Besides those two times, the other encounters were well within Jian Wushuang’s means.

Just when Jian Wushuang passed through the boundless void, it was already a thousand and a hundred years later.

A thousand and a hundred years was nothing to a Universe God. However, it was actually lengthy for Jian Wushuang.

It was the first time he had hurried a journey for such a long time.

In the dark void.

“Jian Wushuang, it’s one of the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, East Royal Sanctuary!” King of Venomous Worms said.

“We’re finally here?” Jian Wushuang was beaming with joy and he looked at a huge land at the end of his sight.

It was also a huge land floating in the dark void. But as one of the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, the East Royal Sanctuary was bigger than the ordinary World by a few folds.

Let alone the experts on the land.

The Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries were the experts’ paradise!

Very soon, Jian Wushuang arrived in the East Royal Sanctuary.

The moment Jian Wushuang laid his feet on the East Royal Sanctuary, he could feel that the surroundings were filled with the Soul Power of the universe.

As it was a Cultivation Sanctuary, it naturally possessed cultivation conditions to which no other places could compare. In the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, regardless of if it was for cultivation or comprehension, the speed would definitely be a few times faster.

“No wonder so many geniuses and experts would take the risk to come to the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. No other places could compare favorably with the cultivation conditions here,” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

“Jian Wushuang, don’t be too happy just yet. You’re at the East Royal Sanctuary, which is one of the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries but not Purple Moon Sanctuaries where the Lineage of Star is at!” king of Venomous Worms said.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

During the lengthy period of time where he was rushing his journey, he heard from King of Venomous Worms about the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries.

He also knew that the Lineage of Star was within the Purple Moon Sanctuary. It’s the overlord and power in Purple Moon Sanctuary.

And the East Royal Sanctuary was quite far from the Purple Moon Sanctuary.

“To go to the Purple Moon Sanctuary from the East Royal Sanctuary, there are two ways. One is to take a wormhole that connects the two sanctuaries. However, that level of wormhole costs a huge price even to take just one ride. It isn’t something you can afford.”

“As for another way, it’d really need you to rush the journey on your own. Forget about the even longer journey from Snow Dojo to the East Royal Sanctuary, the danger during this journey is even bigger!”

King of Venomous Worms said.
