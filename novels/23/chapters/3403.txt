Chapter 3405: Hundred Battle Platform

Translator: EndlessFantasy TranslationEditor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It was reported that after the incident, the spirit ancestor had carried out a crazy revenge on the northern borer and even the blood clan, killing many of the blood clan’s experts. However, the northern borer had been living well, and in the end, the northern borer had become the blood clan’s grandmaster,

although the spirit ancestor’s strength had increased greatly at this time, and he had become the first ancestor in the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect, he still could not kill the northern borer and avenge the husband.

Even after so many years, the hatred that spirit ancestor had for the northern borer had not weakened at all.

“Now we’re in trouble,” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice. “According to Temple Master Bai Xing, among the experts in the six void realms known to the Temporal Temple, only the clan leader of the Nine-tailed Clan is good at souls. If even the Temporal Temple only knows about these two people, I’m

afraid that only these two people in the Divine Beginning Realm can satisfy my requirements.”

“The grandmaster of the Nine-tailed Clan can’t help me. Spirit ancestor can help me, but the conditions…”

Jian Wushuang also felt that this matter was very tricky.

If he wanted to ask spirit ancestor to help him, he had to kill the northern borer.

But the northem borer was obviously not easy to kill.

“There’s no need to rush. Senior Hemp Yi and I have already made an agreement. The soul stripping will definitely be carried out, but it will take some time. After all, I can’t kill the northern borer now. However, if I can’t kill it now, it doesn’t mean that I won’t have a chance in the future. As long as I

improve my strength or break through to become a rule master, then I can join hands with Chenhuo and design a plan to kill it.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.

He could only wait until he was stronger. It was obviously impossible to kill the northern borer now.

“The blood clan…one of the four divine clans, the blood clan!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“The lair of the blood clan is in the third heaven. It seems that I have to go to the third heaven as soon as possible after I understand the situation here,” Jian Wushuang thought.

The Third Heaven was not only the lair of the blood clan, but also the four divine clans and the three Saint Realms.

Previously, Jian Wushuang had many misgivings about that place and did not dare to enter it easily. But now, although he still had some misgivings, he was not as timid as before.

Moreover, his parents and relatives in this life were in the Third Heaven. Miss Xiao’er, whom he had encountered and formed an alliance with, was also in the Third Heaven. He had always been curious about the identity of Miss Xiao’er, naturally, he needed to know more about this matter.

“Chenhuo, let’s go,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Where are we going?” Demon Master Chenhuo asked.

“We’ll go to the blood ancestor’s bloodline first and greet them,” Jian Wushuang said, and the two flew directly toward the mountain range where the blood ancestor’s bloodline lived.

However, as soon as they arrived at the range of the mountain range, they saw a large number of people gathering in the void in front of them.

“There are so many people, and there are many rule masters. More than half of them are not from the blood ancestor’s bloodline. What’s going on?” Jian Wushuang frowned and looked at the void in front of him, there were obviously three groups of people.

One of them was naturally from the blood ancestor’s bloodline. With ancient wheel master as the leader, many Principles Masters had shown up.

The other group consisted of ten Principles Masters. Two of them were in the lead. Judging from the aura and power they emitted, they seemed to have reached the level of the fifth void realm.

The two groups stood in the center, above the blood ancestor’s residence, in the void. It was obvious that they were fighting each other.

The last group of people stood on both sides, talking and laughing, They were obviously neutral spectators.

Among these spectators, Jian Wushuang also saw the existence of Bai Jue.

“Mr. Bai Jue.” Jian Wushuang immediately sent a message to Bai Jue.

After a while, Bai Jue had arrived in front of Jian Wushuang.

“My young friend, you came out from the spirit ancestor?” Bai Jue still looked quite humble.

“I just came out. I wanted to say hello to the blood ancestor and leave, but I didn’t expect to see this scene. Mr. Bai Jue, what’s going on?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“What else could it be? It’s just two factions fighting for each other’s interests. Besides the blood ancestor’s faction, the other faction is from the nether ancestor’s faction. During this period, the blood ancestor’s faction and the nether ancestor’s faction have been fighting over a territory. Both sides know

their limits. But today, the nether ancestor’s faction actually came knocking on our door,” Bai Jue said.

“Knock on the door?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“I’s not a rare thing. There are many sects in the bloodline of the divine ancestor. There are often conflicts and fights among the major sects. It’s normal for them to fight each other, but as long as they know their limits and don’t make a big mess, it’s fine. It’s also common for one sect to block the door of

another, but the one being knocked on the door is, after all, the bloodline of the blood ancestor.” Bai Jue sighed.

“The bloodline of the blood ancestor is one of the four major sects of the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect. All along, he was the only one who fought at the gate of other sects. who dares to come to the residence of the bloodline of the blood ancestor?

“Unfortunately, the bloodline of the blood ancestor has lost several top experts in recent years. Even the blood ancestor is trapped in the universe battlefield and can’t come back for the time being. The bloodline of the blood ancestor is not as powerful as before. That’s why the bloodline of the nether

ancestor dares to do this.”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He had heard about the trouble the blood ancestor’s bloodline had encountered recently. However, he did not expect the trouble to be so big that the other sects had directly attacked them.

Jian Wushuang was listening to Bai Jue’s narration. At this moment, the leader of the nether ancestor’s faction, an expert of the five realms of the void, let out a low roar, “Ancient Wheel, since you and I have different opinions and can’t come to a conclusion, there’s no need to continue arguing. Let’s go to

the hundred battle platforms!”

“Yes, let’s go to the hundred battle platforms!”

The experts of the nether ancestor faction also echoed.

But when they heard the words, “Hundred battle platforms!” The Principles Masters of the blood ancestor faction, including Master Ancient Wheel, had ugly expressions and fell silent for a moment.

“Mr. Bai Jue, what is this hundred battle arena?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The hundred battle arena is a battlefield in the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect for experts to spar with each other. Under normal circumstances, if the factions in the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect can’t come to a conclusion due to a verbal dispute, they will go to the hundred battle arena and rely on their

strength to solve the problem!”

“If the two factions go to the hundred battles platform, they will each choose three experts to fight in three matches. Two out of three wins, and the one that wins will naturally get the victory,” Bai Jue explained.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood.
