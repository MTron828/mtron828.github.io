Chapter 357: Multifarious Sword Skills

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Jian Wushuang, how is it going?”

Jin Ling and Mu Shan came over to Jian Wushuang and asked him.

“I’ve memorized all the movements of the Heart-killing Sword Technique,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“Great!” Jin Ling was very happy to hear that.

“You’ve done as well as that traitor,” Mu Shan said with a smile.

“Traitor?”?Jian Wushuang was intrigued by this information.

“This was your first chance, the Heart-killing Sword Technique. Let’s move on to the second one,” said Jin Ling, then he led Jian Wushuang to a tall tower.

The tower was about 24 meters high, the top of which thrust into the clouds like a sharp sword.

In the upper part, there were two elegant words, Sword Tower.

“This is...?” Jian Wushuang looked up at the lofty building before him.

“It’s the Sword Tower, as you can see,” Jin Ling said, “It consists of multifarious Sword Skills, and it’s one of the most important heritages of the Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline. Most of the Sword Skills inside were created by the top experts of the Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline, while the rest were collected from other places. There are many skills of various kinds.

“Only one-tenth of the skills were handed down after the destruction of the Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline. But, at present, those are enough for you to practice.

“You can stay inside as long as you want and carefully choose skills you want to learn, either by reading or memorizing them, but you can’t take them out of the tower.”

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“You can enter,” Jin Ling said.

Jian Wushuang thought nothing of stepping into the tower.

As soon as he entered, he saw lines of bookcases filled with thick and dense books. Even with only a quick glance, it was obvious that there were tens of thousands of books.

He went to the first bookcase, on which he noticed a list of books.

He was immediately shocked by the number of Sword Skills that were recorded on the list.

“6,400 third-grade sword techniques!”

“970 second-grade sword techniques!”

“10 first-grade sword techniques!”

“Holy God!”?Jian Wushuang was deeply shocked.

The amount of treasure accumulated by the Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline over the long years was simply amazing.

There were a great number of the third-grade Original Sword Techniques as well as 970 second-grade sword techniques.

If these sword techniques appeared in the Nanyang Continent, a considerable number of Saint Realm experts would go crazy over them.

But, inside this tower, they were so common that there was almost a thousand of them.

As for the first-grade sword technique, they only existed in the legends of the Nanyang Continent. That was also true for manuals, magic weapons, and elixirs of the first-grade.

Powerful as the Holy Emperor Palace was, it only had eight superior second-grade manuals.

But in this tower, there were up to 10 Sword Skills of the first-grade.

What did this mean?

If these scrolls were taken out to the Nanyang Continent, all the forces and experts would go crazy trying to snatching them.

More importantly, even though only one-tenth of the Sword Skills were maintained after the fall of the Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline, the number of Sword Skills stored in the tower was still a vast amount.

If this amount of sword skills still remained, one can only imagine how many there were when the Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline was at its peak.

Just thinking about it was enough to shock Jian Wushuang.

“There are many types of sword skills, from various fields, but which ones would be useful to me?”?Jian Wushuang immediately began checking them carefully.

He started by checking the 10 first-grade sword techniques.

Even though these 10 sword skills were no match for the Heart-killing Sword Technique, which was created by the Sword Ancestor himself, they were still very powerful.

“First-grade sword technique, Mind’s Eye Sword Technique!”

A single glance at the introduction on the scroll was enough to cause Jian Wushuang’s eyes to light up.

“Mind’s Eye Sword Technique” was a special and unique Sword Skill. Maybe it would be better to call it a method.

It was a technique for warriors to condense their Sword Essence and store it between their eyebrows. Once released, the essence would surge out with a quick burst.

“Store Sword Essence between the eyebrows?”?Jian Wushuang smiled.

He had heard of many Sword Skills, but the Mind’s Eye Sword Technique was the most unusual and unique one that he had seen.

But, he also understood how devious this technique could be if used at the right time.

What would happen if someone unexpectedly attacked with a powerful blast of Sword Essence from between his eyebrows in the middle of a fierce fight? There are definitely very few people who could anticipate this attack and react quickly enough.

“The longer the Sword Essence is stored, the more powerful it will be. And, it can be released in a split second. What a brilliant first-grade sword technique!”?Jian Wushuang praised it inwardly.

If properly applied, this sword skill could be a weapon of mass destruction, so Jian Wushuang was very interested in it.

However, he was in no rush to practice it right this moment. He continued to look through the rest of the first-grade sword techniques.

4 of the 10 first-grade sword techniques were powerful attacks that worked well with Slaughter Origin. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

As for 2 others of the 10, one attached great importance to speed while the other one was abstruse. But they were both powerful.

The above six were skills for a head-to-head fight while the remaining four were quite unusual.

Mind’s Eye Sword Technique was one of them. To Jian Wushuang’s surprise, he also found a Sword Skill named “Multifold Realm” among the remaining four.

Similar to the Sword Realm that he had gained from the Daluo Heaven Sect, the Multifold Realm was also a skill that could overpower an opponent by forming a Sword Realm.

But, as a first-grade sword technique, Multifold Realm was much more powerful than Sword Realm.

It was divided into five levels.

The first level, the First Realm!

The second level, the Tenfold Realm!

The third level, the Hundredfold Realm!

The fourth level, the Thousandfold Realm!

The fifth level, the Multifold Realm!

Each level was more powerful than the previous one.

“The power behind the combination of Blood River, Slaughter Domain, and Sword Realm is my trump card. But, it’s a pity that Sword Realm is only a third-grade skill. Even though I’ve mastered it to the highest level, Sword Sea, it still isn’t that helpful when combined with the Blood River from Road to the Underworld.

“But Multifold Realm is different! As a first-grade sword technique, even the first level of it is much more powerful than Sword Sea. Combined with Road to the Underworld, the force will only be stronger.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered.

Among the 10 first-grade sword techniques, this technique was his favorite, followed by Mind’s Eye Sword Technique.

Inside the tower, as he casually looked through the scrolls, he would pay more attention to the techniques that surprised him, which increased his understanding of Sword Principle more and more as he progressed.

While immersing himself in study, he lost track of time.
