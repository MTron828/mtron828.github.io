“He Xiu is quite pitiful,” Jian Wushuang shook his head and sighed.

According to the information, He Xiu was the top genius of the young generation in He Family. Not only was he talented, his mental state was terrifyingly strong. He had extremely great potential.

However, after the news of him privately possessing opportunity and Taiqing Ancient Panacea spread, He Xiu suffered the calamity of his family being exterminated. Almost the entire He Family was killed. Only he managed to escape along with the opportunity and Taiqing Ancient Panacea.

Then, he ran into You Ming Mountain and countless experts chased after him.

He was originally a God’s favored one, but he was being hunted. He Xiu was of course pitiful.

Although he was pitiful, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t pity him at all.

After all, he was one of those who were chasing after He Xiu.

In the pub, Jian Wushuang was drinking alone. At the same time, he continued to flip through the information.

Then, a dozen figures came into the pub from outside.

These people let their auras spread wantonly. All of them were Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven. Among, their leader, a brown-haired man was already a Void Real God.

One should know that they were only in one of the Holy Kingdoms, not a place like the ten sanctuaries. A Real God leading a dozen of peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven, such a troop was terrifying enough.

“These people are from Ling Family!”

“Ling Family?”

The originally noisy pub instantly went quiet. Everyone in the pub was looking at the dozens of people from Ling Family who had just walked it. Most of them had fear in their eyes. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Ling Family?” Jian Wushuang took a glance at the people.

From the information that he had just read. Ling Family was like the He Family that was exterminated. They were both big families in Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu but they were slightly more powerful than He Family.

However, Jian Wushuang couldn’t even be bothered by the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu, let alone Ling Family.

With a simple glance, Jian Wushuang continued to drink while he read the information on hand.

“The few of you, go away!”

The brown-haired man, who was the leader of the people from Ling Family, looked at the few cultivators at the table before him and pressed over with his Real God aura. The few warriors’ faces grew pale from the pressure and they immediately gave their table up with hesitation.

The brown-haired man sat at the table and there was someone who poured him a drink immediately.

“Humph, He Xiu, that bastard, he is so well hidden. It has been over ten years and we have yet to find him,” the brown-haired man roared without any cover-up.

Ling Family and He Family were the two strongest families in Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu. They were normally sworn enemies. Then, as He Family was in trouble, Ling Family was, of course, the happiest party. Ling Family was also the most hardworking party that was chasing after He Xiu from He Family.

The brown-haired man was burning with rage. He chugged his drink and looked around him.

Looking at the gaze of the brown-haired man, everyone in the pub lowered their heads. Only Jian Wushuang was still flipping through the information in his hand.

“Huh?” The brown-haired man’s gaze stopped at Jian Wushuang.

“This person…”

It wasn’t because Jian Wushuang didn’t lower his head that he noticed Jian Wushuang but because of Jian Wushuang’s attire.

The brown-haired man flipped his hand and there was a copy of the information in his hand.

He was from Ling Family and Ling Family knew He Family the best. He was also very familiar with He Xiu. Hence, the copy of the information about He Xiu that he had was in much more in detail than the one provided by You Ming Pub.

“Crimson robe, carrying a sword on his back. Back when He Xiu was wandering, he dressed in a crimson robe and carried a sword on his back, exactly like this person before me. Both of their features look very young too,” the brown-haired man fixed his gaze.

He had never seen He Xiu before, nor did he have He Xiu’s portrait, but he knew He Xiu’s attire.

He Xiu was good with a sword and he was crazy about swords. So, he always carried a sword on his back.

“You saw He Xiu once. Is it this person?” The brown-haired man looked to a Universe God from Ling Family next to him and asked.

“Misted, when I saw He Xiu back then, I only saw him from afar. I didn’t see his facial features. But in terms of body shape and attire, the two of them are quite similar. But He Xiu is running for his life. He wouldn’t come to You Ming Pub like an idiot and not bother to disguise himself.” The Universe God from Ling Family said.

“Humph, we will find out if it is him when we question him,” the brown-haired man humped coldly. He looked at Jian Wushuang with a sharp glare.

“Young man, come here!”

As he humphed, his Real God-level pressure pressed onto Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang continued to flip through the information in his hand but he glanced at the brown-haired man, “You’d better not provoke me. Otherwise, you’ll regret it.”

“Haha, in Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu, who has the capability to make Ling Family regretful? This is such a joke. Young man, you’d better take out your Qian Kun ring for me to check. Otherwise, I will kill you and check your Qian Kun ring after,” the brown-haired man scoffed but it was doubtlessly a commanding tone.

The Universe Gods from Ling Family who stood behind him were smirking coldly too.

Then, Jian Wushuang didn’t speak anymore but extended his finger slowly and pointed in the direction of the brown-haired man.

Vroom!

A shapeless sword intention swept out.

The sword shadow looked weak and didn’t seem to be powerful at all.

But when it appeared, it instantly flew before the brown-haired man. The brown-haired man was still smiling but there was a sudden shock in his eyes. The sword shadow flew past his body then through the Universe Gods’ bodies behind him.

Then, the sword shadow quivered and dispersed.

Jian Wushuang reined back his palm and raised his glass to take a sip.

“In this world, there are so many idiots. Even though he is already a Real God,” Jian Wushuang muttered and remained at ease.

The cultivators from Ling Family, their bodies stiffened on the spot and then fell one after another. Then, there was not a squeak but only blood that constantly flowed out from their wounds.

Every cultivator in the pub saw the scene and their faces grew pale. They looked at Jian Wushuang with an unprecedentedly terrified look.

Real God was an absolute superb expert in Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu.

However, a superb expert was just like an ant when he was killed by the person before their eyes so casually. Such power…

These people immediately understood that the young man in the crimson robe who was sitting alone while he read the information was truly a top expert. He was at least the level of an Eternal Real God, or even higher.
