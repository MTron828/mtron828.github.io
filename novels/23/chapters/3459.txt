Chapter 3461 All Under Control

It had been less than 15 minutes since the guardian array of the Scarlet Gold Clan had been destroyed and the Divine Moon Palace and the blood marten race had attacked the Scarlet Gold Clan. However, the Scarlet Gold Clan had already calmed down.

The many clansmen of the Scarlet Gold Clan had been appeased by the Principles Masters who had been controlled by the Scarlet Gold Clan. After all, most of them did not know what had happened. With the appeasement of the elders…most of them did not think too much about it.

And the entire Scarlet Gold Clan had naturally been completely controlled by the Divine Moon Palace.

If there was only one thing that had not been controlled, it would be the Scarlet Gold Clan Leader.

In the void at the center of the Scarlet Gold Clan, a layer of temporary array had been set up around this void. This array had blocked the vision and soul probing of the Scarlet Gold Clan’s clansmen. In other words…the members of the Scarlet Gold Clan did not know what was happening in the void.

In this void, many Principles Masters of the Divine Moon Palace, the blood marten race, and the Scarlet Gold Clan were gathered there. However, at this moment, everyone’s eyes were fixed on the person in the middle, it was naturally the Scarlet Gold Clan Leader.

“Scarlet Gold Clan Leader, at this point, aren’t you going to surrender?” Er Xiu looked at the Scarlet Gold Clan Leader with a mocking expression.

“Er Xiu!” Scarlet Gold Clan Leader’s eyes were bloodshot like a hungry beast. “Your Blood Marten Clan actually defected to the Divine Moon Palace?”

“Defected? No, my Blood Marten Clan is an ally of the Divine Moon Palace. Mr. Heavenly Sword Marquis can testify to that,” Er Xiu said with a smile.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis?” Clan Leader Scarlet Gold immediately looked at Jian Wushuang again. His eyes were bloodshot, and a shocking hatred rose from the bottom of his heart.

He had killed his son with Jian Wushuang, and today, Jian Wushuang had attacked his clan with many experts from the Divine Moon Palace and the Blood Marten Clan, although Jian Wushuang did not fight with the experts from his clan, Jian Wushuang only used the time-space restriction and time-space restriction at any time, it completely blocked the escape route of the experts from his clan.

Because of this, none of the Principles Masters of the Scarlet Gold Clan could escape. Everyone was left behind and then controlled by Miss Xiao’er. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Clan leader, I personally don’t have any malice toward the Scarlet Gold Clan, but unfortunately, I was born in this world and have no control over many things. Today, the Scarlet Gold Clan has been reduced to such a state. You can only blame yourself for being too weak,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Haha, too weak?”

“Yes, too weak. If we were not only a top clan but also a divine clan, we wouldn’t have been so easily defeated by you. How dare you kill my son?” Clan Leader Scarlet Gold shouted.

“Well, it’s all over now. Clan Leader Scarlet Gold, you’d better behave. Maybe you’ll suffer less. Otherwise…” Xiao’er’s eyes shone with a strange light.

Upon seeing Xiao’er, the Scarlet Gold Clan Leader revealed a terrified expression.

“It’s you, it’s you!”

“It was you who used a method to control Elder Chi Li, allowing Elder Chi Li to act as an insider and destroy our tribe’s protective array. It was also you who turned all the Principles Masters of our clan into Palace Masters!”

“You demon!”

The Scarlet Gold Clan Leader roared crazily, and his gaze was directed at the Principles Masters of the clan who originally belonged to the clan.

At this moment, these Principles Masters were standing in the surrounding void like wooden blocks. They looked at him with a hint of mockery and ridicule.

“Bastards, idiots, they are all a bunch of idiots!” The Scarlet Gold Clan Leader could not help but shout in shock and anger.

“Don’t worry, you will soon become like them.” Xiao’er smiled, then, she said, “This Scarlet Gold Clan Leader still looks lively and vigorous. It seems that he still has a lot of godly power left. Lord Xu, destroy his godly body once more and make him lose the ability to resist.”

“Yes.” Lord Xu nodded and then attacked again.

With Lord Xu’s power at the sixth level of the void, it was too easy for him to destroy the divine body of the clan leader of the Scarlet Gold Clan when the clan leader of the Scarlet Gold Clan could not escape anymore.

In just a moment, the divine body of the clan leader of the Scarlet Gold Clan was destroyed again, and the remaining divine power was also damaged. However, Lord Xu did not destroy the last bit of divine power left by the clan leader of the Scarlet Gold Clan. He left the clan leader of the Scarlet Gold Clan with his life.

And at this moment, Xiao’er appeared in front of the Scarlet Gold Clan leader.

“Scarlet Gold Clan leader, look at me,” Xiao’er said softly. Her voice was so beautiful that people could not help but feel intoxicated.

“Demon, you demon.” The Scarlet Gold Clan Leader clearly knew Xiao’er’s methods and knew that he could not look at Xiao’er. However, when he heard Xiao’er’s voice, he could not help but look over. When he looked over, his eyes quickly became empty and he was stunned. In the void beside them, Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chenhuo stood there quietly, making everyone pay attention to the scene in front of them.

They saw Scarlet Gold Clan Leader and Xiao’er looking at each other. The former was completely stunned as if he was possessed, while Xiao’er was mumbling something to him, Scarlet Gold Clan Leader nodded stiffly on the way.

After a while…

“Well, go and recover your divine power,” Xiao’er said softly.

“Yes, master.” Scarlet Gold Clan Leader nodded and then flew toward the void.

This scene made Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrink.

“Miss Xiao’er’s enchantment is really amazing. An expert at the peak of the fifth void realm became her slave in a short time,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

“It is indeed a terrifying enchantment. Fortunately, Miss Xiao’er’s cultivation is not very high. She is only at the fourth void realm. If she reaches the fifth void realm or even the sixth void realm, no one among the masters of rules would be able to resist her enchantment. Even I don’t have absolute confidence,” Demon Master Chenhuo said.

“Fortunately, Miss Xiao’er is my friend, not my enemy. Otherwise, I would have killed her earlier,” Jian Wushuang said.

After controlling all the experts of the Scarlet Gold Clan, Xiao’er flew toward Jian Wushuang.

“Miss Xiao’er, Congratulations. After controlling the Scarlet Gold Clan, your Divine Moon Palace’s overall strength has reached a new level. I’m afraid that the Divine Moon Palace won’t be afraid of the Nine-tailed Clan even without the help of me and the Blood Marten Clan,” Jian Wushuang said.

“It’s nothing. Although my Divine Moon Palace can compete with the Nine-tailed Clan, I’m still far from taking control of the Nine-tailed Clan. You and the Blood Marten Clan are indispensable,” Xiao’er said with a smile.
