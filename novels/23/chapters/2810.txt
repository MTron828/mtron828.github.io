Chapter 2811: Blood Solidification

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

There were countless secret techniques in the absolute beginning divine realm.

There were those that could increase one’s strength and power, and those that could increase one’s protective ability. Naturally, there were also secret techniques that could increase one’s speed.

The Marquis of Three Yin in front of him should have cultivated a very powerful secret technique that could increase one’s speed.

With the help of the secret skill, his speed and his attack speed were greatly improved.

Otherwise, his speed would not be so fast.

“Damn it, he is so fast that even I can’t resist him.” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He had fought with Marquis of Three Yin hundreds of times, so Marquis of Three Yin was faster than him. Under such circumstances, he was under more and more pressure and could not hold on any longer.

Clang!

There was another sound of metal colliding. Jian Wushuang’s blood mountain sword was forced to move to the side.

“A flaw!”

Marquis of Three Yin’s eyes narrowed. He waved his right hand, and a sharp scarlet claw tore through the air and directly attacked Jian Wushuang’s divine body.

Jian Wushuang could not defend against this claw with his blood mountain sword.

However, just as the scarlet claw was about to touch his divine body, a hazy purple light suddenly burst out from Jian Wushuang’s body.

The purple light continued to expand, forming a layer of purple barrier in an instant. At the same time, a faint ancient bell sound echoed.

It was Jian Wushuang’s protective treasure, the Purple Emperor Bell.

The claw grabbed the purple bell, causing it to emit a clear bell sound. The color of the bell dimmed slightly, but the power of the claw was completely blocked by him.

“Huh?” Marquis of Three Yin’s face darkened. He quickly retreated and pulled away from Jian Wushuang.

Standing in the void far away, the Marquis of Three Yin looked at Jian Wushuang again.

“A protective treasure? And it seems to be quite powerful?” The Marquis of Three Yin murmured.

He did not know that the Purple Emperor Bell was obtained by Jian Wushuang after he killed Saber Master in the secret realm. It came from that secret realm.

The secret realm was left behind by the rule master, so any treasure that appeared from there was nothing special.

The Purple Emperor Bell’s protective ability was, of course, very strong.

“With such a protective treasure in hand, I’m afraid such an attack can’t do anything to you. In that case, I’ll have to use my killing move.” The Marquis of Three Yin’s eyes were filled with a fierce light, and there was a layer of blood-red mist surrounding his body.

Without any warning, the Marquis of Three Yin appeared directly in front of Jian Wushuang.

He waved the sharp claw in his right hand again.

It looked no different than before, and Jian Wushuang subconsciously waved his blood mountain sword to block it.

However, just as the blood mountain sword was about to collide with the sharp claw, the sharp claw disappeared in front of him.

“Is this... a phantom?” Jian Wushuang’s face changed.

Marquis of Three Yin sneered and condensed the divine power in his hand. “Divine heart-gouging claw!”

“Chi!!”

The blood-red claw grabbed Jian Wushuang’s heart with blood-red power.

The barrier formed by the Purple Emperor Bell was still in front of the blood-red claw. However, as soon as the blood-red claw touched the Purple Emperor Bell, it opened its five fingers. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The five streams of light were like five sharp sword rays, and a terrifying power burst out.

Crack!

Cracks appeared in the place where the blood-red claw touched the previously indestructible barrier of the Purple Emperor Bell.

Then the entire barrier of the Purple Emperor Bell was completely broken.

“It broke my Purple Emperor Bell in one strike?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He immediately understood that this claw was the ultimate skill created by the Marquis of Three Yin. It was extremely powerful and extremely ghostly.

“Die!”

The blood-red claw broke the barrier of the Purple Emperor Bell and continued to attack Jian Wushuang’s divine body.

However, Jian Wushuang’s body-protection ability was not limited to the Purple Emperor Bell. His own body-protection ability was extremely powerful. The claw had already used up about 80% of the Purple Emperor Bell’s power, leaving only 20% of its power, it was only enough to break through the dark golden armor formed by the nine luminaries star armor.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang was still sent flying heavily, but he soon regained his footing.

He stood in the void and stared at Marquis of Three Yin with a grave expression.

“As expected of the invincible divine master. He’s really strong!” Jian Wushuang sighed inwardly.

“Just this claw alone can’t hurt him?” The Marquis of Three Yin looked at Jian Wushuang and frowned slightly.

That claw was indeed one of the ultimate skills he had created, but it obviously could not hurt Jian Wushuang. It had only broken the Purple Emperor Bell on his body.

“It seems that I have to use my last move.”

Marquis of Three Yin murmured, but his expression became extremely cold.

“Sword One, you can only be proud of being able to force me to use my strongest move, even if you die on the spot.” The Marquis of Three Yin’s voice echoed throughout the world.

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s face could not help but darken.

“This guy actually has some tricks up his sleeve?”

“I thought that claw just now was his strongest move, but he actually has an even stronger move?”

“If I’m not mistaken, that claw just now should be the ultimate skill, and now he has an even stronger move. In other words, he created two ultimate skills at the same time?”

The experts of the Sword Alliance were also trembling in fear.

From the beginning of this battle, they knew that this battle was not something they could interfere with.

Even Elder Tong was not qualified to participate in such a big battle. They could only stand in the distance and watch quietly.

The Marquis of Three Yin did not say any more nonsense. His expression was cold, and the vast blood-colored fog on his body swept out crazily.

The blood-colored fog began to become extremely dense, like blood clouds that covered half of the world.

In the blink of an eye, the blood-colored fog that filled the sky formed a huge creature in the void.

It was a blood-colored giant wolf that was hundreds of meters tall and awe-inspiring.

This blood-colored giant wolf had scarlet fur, scarlet eyes, and scarlet fangs. The most eye-catching part was its four sharp claws.

Each of the four sharp claws was several meters long. Under the illumination of the light, they looked extremely cold and frightening.

The giant blood-red wolf appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and stared at him with its scarlet eyes.

Jian Wushuang stood there and could not help feeling a little frightened when being stared at by the giant blood-red wolf.

At this moment, the Marquis of Three Yin, who was covered by the giant blood-red wolf, suddenly had a cold look in his eyes.

“Swish!”

The giant blood-red wolf rushed forward and raised one of its four sharp claws high up in the air.

A scarlet claw shadow, which seemed to be condensed from blood, kept enlarging in the depths of Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“Blood-condensed claw!”

The Marquis of Three Yin also spoke coldly.
