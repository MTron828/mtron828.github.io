Chapter 1663: Zi Ye’s Arrival

The black universe was filled with nothingness.

The chubby old man Real God Peng Huo, who was like a small mountain, was standing on a mountain and he was waiting quietly.

After a short while, a shadow appeared in his line of vision.

The approaching person wore purple armor and battle boots. In addition, his head also wore a battle helmet. He also looked handsome and he looked just a purple war god.

“Real God Peng Huo,” Real God Zi Ye’s face revealed a modest expression.

Although he was a top Chaotic Real God, he was still inferior to Real God Peng Huo.

“Zi Ye, why is the Soaring Heaven King Palace looking for Jian Wushuang?” Real God Peng Huo asked. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“We naturally have something for him. However, it’s not convenient for me to tell you the details,” Real God Zi Ye laughed.

Real God Peng Huo raised his eyebrows and said disapprovingly, “Forget it if you do not wish to tell me. I saw Jian Wushuang previously. He is in that direction.”

Real God Peng Huo pointed in a direction, “Continue going straight from there. He’s nearby a piece of void that is millions of miles away. However, that is where I saw him ten days ago. As for whether he is still in that region, I have no idea.”

“Thank you very much, Real God Peng Huo.” After thanking him, Real God Zi Ye hurried in that direction straight away.

Real God Peng Huo was still standing on the mountain and he looked on as Real God Zi Ye left. It was only after Real God Zi Ye had moved far away that his face revealed a strange smile. After that, he took out a transmission token.

“My little friend Jian Wushuang, Real God Zi Ye has come. Moreover… he’s alone.”

“Real God Peng Huo, thank you very much and I’m sorry for troubling you,” Jian Wushuang’s voice could be heard from the token.

Real God Peng Huo chuckled and put his token into his Qian Kun Ring.

“The Soaring Heaven King Palace wishes to take care of Jian Wushuang. However, Jian Wushuang also seems to want to take action against the Soaring Heaven King Palace. I really have no idea who is plotting against who.” Real God Peng Huo revealed a thoughtful expression, “However, I do not need to care about the crazy fights between the two sides as it does not concern me. It will be alright as long as I do not offend either side.”

Everyone knew that Real God Peng Huo had an extremely good reputation all around and he had never provoked someone else of his own accord. Instead, it had always been other people who went looking for him.

However, in actual fact, this was related to his character.

He had no ambitions and only wished to be free and unfettered. In addition, he was not concerned with the fights between the powerhouses of the Eternal Chaotic World. In spite of that, his relations with other people were good.

To put it in good terms, he was a smooth person who had a good sense of propriety. However, to put it in bad terms, he was a genuine old fox.

Moreover, such an old fox had been able to live for a long time.

…

Millions of miles away, Jian Wushuang was sitting down on the dark land and waiting quietly. At that moment, he was smiling.

“As expected. The Soaring Heaven King Palace only sent Real God Zi Ye alone as they thought that it would be sufficient to kill me.”

“That’s right. After all, Real God Zi Ye is a top Chaotic Real God and he is very close to the Real God ranking list. Even if he were to come across other top Chaotic Real Gods like Real God Long Qing, he would be able to kill them. Moreover, the abilities that I unleashed back then in the inner layer to kill Real God Gu Ying were not stronger than Real God Long Qing’s.”

As Jian Wushuang laughed, he stood up slowly.

“Let me go and welcome Real God Zi Ye!”

Jian Wushuang moved his feet and he walked forward slowly.

Atop the dark void, Real God Zi Ye who wore a purple armor and also had a commanding presence was travelling in accordance to Real God Peng Huo’s directions.

After a short while, he noticed a shadow which appeared in the range of his own consciousness detection.

“I have found him!” Real God Zi Ye’s eyes were like an eagle’s and he looked toward the front.

Atop the dark and barren land, the shadow of a blood-robed young man who was carrying a long sword on his back was moving forward slowly.

Although he was taking small steps, every step was filled with strength. Hence, any random step of his would easily cover a distance of hundreds of miles.

It was only when the shadow of the young man was less than ten thousand miles away from Real God Zi Ye that he stopped moving. A cold wind flew by and blew up his blood robe, as well as his hair.

At the next moment, the shadow of the young man raised his head and revealed a resolute and young face. The face contained a pair of penetrating eyes which were like a pair of gems, and the shrill light that they were emitting illuminated the dark void.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re really here!”

Real God Zi Ye’s voice shook the heavens. After that, his body changed into purple lightning and descended in front of Jian Wushuang. In addition, the ground that he stepped on with his battle boots was smashed into pieces.

Jian Wushuang was looking at Real God Zi Ye who was in front of him. Although he had already prepared himself a long time ago, he was expressionless on the surface. He then said: “So it’s Real God Zi Ye of the Soaring Heaven King Palace. Do you have anything for me?”

“Haha. Jian Wushuang, are you really that stupid, or are you simply acting dumb?” Real God Zi Ye was extremely arrogant.

“From the looks of it, you are here to take revenge for Real God Gu Ying, right?” Jian Wushuang giggled.

“Of course. Not just anyone can kill the Soaring Heaven King Palace’s people,” Real God Zi Ye said with a low voice.

“Back then, Real God Gu Ying and Real God Xue Ling had cast their greedy eyes on my Grade Three Demon Core and they attacked me. As such, I took action and killed him to protect myself. Shouldn’t I have done that? Could it be that I should have let him kill me so that he could snatch my treasure away? The Soaring Heaven King Palace’s people are too unreasonable,” Jian Wushuang shouted while pretending to have a furious look.

“Since you also know that the Soaring Heaven King Palace is unreasonable, why are you still asking me questions? No matter what reason it is, as long as you kill the Soaring Heaven King Palace’s people, you must die!” Real God Zi Ye was filled with overwhelming murderous intent.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and he laughed sardonically.

He then opened up his right hand, which had been closed tightly all the while, and revealed a token.

“That’s a… Mirroring Token?” Real God Zi Ye’s expression changed slightly and he looked at Jian Wushuang, “You did that on purpose?”

“You only caught on now?” Jian Wushuang sneered and kept the Mirroring Token which had finished recording into his Qian Kun Ring, “I am done with the Mirroring Token. Now, it’s time for me to make my move!”

“Hmph, no matter what you do, you have to die today!”

Real God Zi Ye was filled with murderous intent. With a flip of his palm, a purple saber appeared in his hands.

Buzz!!!

Real God Zi Ye made his move straight away.

Within the vast black void, four additional purple moons appeared out of thin air.

The four purple moons were extremely dazzling and they illuminated the dark void with purple light.

As for Jian Wushuang, he could tell clearly that the four purple moons were four bright rays of saber light.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

The four purple moons swept past the area and left four purple shadows behind on the void.

Space and time seemed to have been affected greatly.

Swoosh!

All of a sudden, the void behind Jian Wushuang tore open and a purple moon appeared. Moreover, the purple moon was aimed at his head.
