Chapter 3184: Killing His Way to the Door

——

Blood Eagle was well aware of his own strength.

In terms of strength, if the Heavenly Sword Marquis did not hide his strength in the mirror image, Blood Eagle was confident that he was stronger than him. However, even if he was stronger than the Heavenly Sword Marquis, he was only slightly stronger. The two of them were so close in strength, it would be extremely difficult to completely defeat the other party. As for killing him, it was just wishful thinking.

After all, at their level of strength, not to mention that each of them had extraordinary life-saving methods, just their immortal bodies alone were a huge problem.

For example, Jian Wushuang could easily kill a True Saint at the peak of rank seven for four reasons.

First, he was much stronger than his opponent.

Second, he had the master seal, which sealed the space and time in the first place, making it impossible for his opponent to escape.

Third, his Blood Mountain Sword was so sharp that it could easily tear apart his opponent’s protective armor.

As for the fourth reason, it was the cold blood poison. Once it entered his opponent’s divine body, it would destroy his divine power and kill him.

Even if Jian Wushuang was only one of the four conditions, he might not be able to kill the four of them. It was because he had all four conditions that the four of them could not escape, they could not escape from him at all.

However, if it was Blood Eagle, he was not confident that he could kill Jian Wushuang.

“Brother, are we just going to let it go?” Violent Bear growled.

“Let it go? Of course not!” Blood Eagle’s eyes were filled with killing intent. “Sixth, eighth, eleventh, and thirteenth are brothers who have gone through life and death with us. Now that they have all died in the hands of Heavenly Sword Marquis, how can we just let it go? A blood debt must be paid with blood. However, if we want to Kill Heavenly Sword Marquis, we have to think of a way.”

Blood Eagle fell into deep thought.

After a long while, he raised his head again, he said, “That Heavenly Sword Marquis came to my Nine Wolf Mountain Range and killed old six, old eight, old eleven, and old thirteen. He is obviously targeting my thirteen axes. He probably wants to kill all of my thirteen axes. Now that he has only killed four leaders, he will not give up. Instead, he will continue to stay in the Nine Wolf Mountain Range and wait for an opportunity. This gives us a chance to kill him!”

“How about this? I’ll send a message to Carefree Young Master and ask him to help me kill him.”

“Carefree Young Master?” All the leaders present were stunned.

“Big brother, will Carefree Young Master agree to help?” Violent Bear frowned.

One had to know that Carefree Young Master did not have any connection with thirteen axes before. This time, it was only because the Blood Wave Realm was about to open and carefree young master wanted Blood Eagle to enter the Blood Wave Realm with him, that was why he had contact with the thirteen axes.

However, it was just contact. They did not have any friendship. Why would Carefree Young Master help them?

“He will help. Carefree Young Master will definitely help.” Blood Eagle was extremely confident, “Although the Carefree talisman that Carefree Young Master is in is a first-class force in the Divine Beginning Realm, there aren’t many spots for them to enter the Blood Wave Realm. The reason why Carefree Young Master is willing to give me one of the spots isn’t just because of my strength. The most important thing is that I’m comprehending the law of death. Moreover, I can comprehend that formation…”

“I’ve already grasped 50-60% of that formation. Before entering the Blood Wave Realm, I can even grasp 70% of that formation. Among the helpers that Carefree Young Master carefree wants to invite, I’m afraid that no one can match me. Therefore, I’m also quite important to Carefree Young Master. Now that my thirteen axes are in trouble, if I ask him for help, he most likely won’t refuse.”

As soon as Blood Eagle spoke, he immediately took out his token and sent a message to Carefree Young Master.

The other leaders of the thirteen axes were waiting there quietly.

After a short while, Blood Eagle took back his token with a smile on his face. “As I guessed, Carefree Young Master has agreed. He will immediately send Iron Dragon Saint and Unity Saint to our Nine Wolves Mountain Range. With their speed, they will arrive here in five days at most.”

“Iron Dragon Saint? Unity Saint?” The surrounding leaders were pleasantly surprised. Apparently, they had heard of their names.

“Iron Dragon Saint and Unity Saint are both top experts who have been famous in the Divine Beginning World for many years. Either of them is probably stronger than me. With their help, together with my brothers and I, we can easily kill Heavenly Sword Marquis. What I’m worried about now is whether Heavenly Sword Marquis will leave our Nine Wolf Mountain Range before the arrival of Iron Dragon Sword and Unity Saint,” Blood Eagle said.

If Jian Wushuang left right now, they would have suffered a great loss and would not be able to do anything to him.

But if Jian Wushuang was not in a hurry to leave, as long as he was still in the Nine Wolf Mountain Range, they were confident that they could find him and kill him.

Blood Eagle was thinking with the other leaders, but at this moment…

Weng!

A majestic power suddenly erupted in the void outside. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What’s going on?”

“This is…”

The Blood Eagle, Violent Bear, and the remaining leaders were all shocked. Immediately, their bodies rushed out.

The moment everyone appeared in the void outside, they immediately saw the barrier that completely sealed the surrounding space.

That barrier covered the entire green flame mountain in all directions, leaving not a single gap.

“This barrier…seals off space and time. When Han attacked sixth and eighth, he also directly sealed off space and time. The method of sealing off space and time is exactly the same as this barrier!”

“It’s Han, it’s Han who’s here!”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis!”

Many eyes began to search for him. Soon, everyone’s eyes focused on a young man at the end of their line of sight.

This young man was naturally Jian Wushuang.

“As expected, the nine surviving leaders of the 13 axes are all here.” Jian Wushuang stood in the void with a faint smile on his face as he looked at the nine leaders who appeared in front of him.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis!”

Blood Eagle’s voice was cold, and his eyes seemed to spit fire. He stared at Jian Wushuang and said, “You killed four of my brothers, and you still dare to come here?”

“Oh, you recognized me?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and was not surprised.

Three hundred years ago, he fought with Bai Yuan of the Purple Cloud Pavilion and killed a rank seven True Saint with the power of a rank four True Saint. His battle record was incredible, and the mirror image of their battle spread throughout the Divine Beginning World, as for what techniques he was good at, what weapons he used, and what laws he comprehended, all the experts already knew about it.

Now that he had come to the Nine Wolves Mountain Range to kill, even though he had changed his appearance, the techniques he used had not changed. In addition to his similarly inconceivable ability to cross realms, it was normal for the other party to recognize him..
