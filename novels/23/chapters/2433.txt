Chapter 2434: Three Tokens

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Too powerful, he is too powerful!”

“Even a First-Class Divine Demon was instantly killed. Wouldn’t I be seeking death if I go up now?”

Many genius disciples around were afraid.

They were afraid of Jian Wushuang’s power.

If one had such strong powers, no one would dare to challenge him even if he had treasures that many wanted.

Jian Wushuang was just that kind of a person.

No one dared to snatch the position token in Zhuo Bing’s hands with Jian Wushuang by her side.

Of course, they were willing to give that up to a certain extent because it was only the first position token.

There were a total of six position tokens, and the genius disciples around would have opportunities to compete for the other five tokens. There was no need to challenge that terrifying Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang noticed how the attitude of those people around him have changed. He knew that he had shown them enough to make them fearful of him and was pleased.

“Big Sister, let’s go,” said Jian Wushuang.

The surrounding crowd immediately gave way to Jian Wushuang and the others.

“Little Brother...” Zhuo Bing stared at Jian Wushuang incredulously.

She even wondered if Jian Wushuang, who was standing in front of her was really her little brother.

She was worried sick when she knew that Pang Tao had targeted Jian Wushuang before, but who knew that Jian Wushuang was not bothered at all.

Ling Dan, Zhong Yi, and Su Tong had weird expressions on their faces.

Jian Wushuang smiled helplessly. “Everyone. I know you have a lot of questions, but we have to get out of here first.”

“Yes, yes.” Zhuo Bing and the others agreed.

Jian Wushuang and his group made their way out using the path that was opened up for them.

However, someone was not going to let them leave so easily.

In that hidden independent space...

“I’m surprised by this young man. That Pang Tao guy who was killed by him had the power of Peak Divine Demon but had no chance to crush the token in his hand. Haha.”

“It seems that was not enough to put pressure on Jian Wushuang. In that case...”

The Crimson Stone Saint smiled in a weird demeanor and two white tokens appeared in his hand.

Those two white tokens were instantly tossed out.

Jian Wushuang, Zhuo Bing, and the others were about to leave the crowd as those genius disciples around had suppressed the greed in them. No one was going to do anything to stop them.

At this moment...

Bang! Bang!

The ground underneath Jian Wushuang’s feet suddenly cracked open and two bright white lights shot up.

The two white lights appeared right next to Jian Wushuang, one on each side. Jian Wushuang frowned and subconsciously waved his hand, catching both white tokens.

“This...”

The sudden change of events caught Jian Wushuang by surprise.

Zhuo Bing, the others next to him, and those genius disciples from various sects around were all stunned.

The first token position which appeared before that everyone was fighting for had ended up in the hands of Zhuo Bing.

No one dared to fight for that token because of Jian Wushuang.

Suddenly, two more position tokens appeared at the same time and both fell directly into Jian Wushuang’s hands.

The two tokens plus the one with Zhuo Bing added up to a total of three tokens altogether. Jian Wushuang had three tokens!

Those genius disciples from various sects were consumed by jealousy.

Jian Wushuang looked at the two position tokens in his hand and frowned. “The position tokens were supposed to appear in every corner of the inner area, but now three of them appeared at the same time in the area where I’m located. It might be a coincidence for the first one, but these two... These two were sent directly to me, how could it be a coincidence?”

It looks like I was intentionally put in this situation.”

Jian Wushuang seemed to have figured it out. His gaze became gloomy all of a sudden.

He knew that all of this was deliberately plotted by someone, and there could only be one person who could control when and where these tokens appear in the tomb.

Crimson Stone Saint!

“That old guy, is he targeting me?” Jian Wushuang murmured.

Those people around who had given way for Jian Wushuang and his group to leave had once again encircled them. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

There were hundreds of genius disciples from various sects and all of them with their fiery eyes were staring at the two position tokens in Jian Wushuang’s hands.

One of the First-Class Divine Demons said, “Jian Wushuang, you are indeed strong. We will let go of that position token with the Ice Queen, but I hope you would hand over those two position tokens to us.”

The First-Class Divine Demon was quite polite, or perhaps he was just cautious and did not take immediate action to snatch it. He hoped that Jian Wushuang would take the initiative to hand the tokens over.

“Yes, the first position token is fine, but these two must be given away.”

“There are only six position tokens. You already have one. You can’t be too greedy.”

“Jian Wushuang, give it away.”

There were a few First-Class Divine Demons around who acted as representatives and all of them tried to coerce Jiang Wushuang into giving up his tokens.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold.

He knew that these genius disciples were horrified by his powers, hence they were willing to give up on a single token.

However, to allow Jiang Wushuang three position tokens which accounted for half of the six available seats, they were not going to let that happen.

“Little brother.” Zhuo Bing and the others also looked at Jian Wushuang.

They were calm. Although Jian Wushuang had attained two more position tokens, it was not something good.

Jian Wushuang glanced at Zhuo Bing, but he was actually deep in his thoughts.

‘Big Sister is very keen at getting a seat to be enlightened by Fengtian Scroll so the first position token must be hers. I also need a position token for myself. As for Ling Dan, Zhong Yi, and Su Tong, though they had not expressed their intentions, they are also extremely eager for those position tokens. Now that I have three tokens, the last token should be assigned to one of them which currently is just.’

After pondering for a moment, Jian Wushuang had made up his mind.

He needed all three tokens. How could he give them up?

“Big Sister, give me your token,” said Jian Wushuang.

Zhuo Bing did not hesitate and immediately took out her token.

Jian Wushuang took it and said, “All of you, get out of the battlefield.”

“Get out from the battlefield?” Zhuo Bing’s expression changed
