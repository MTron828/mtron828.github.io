Chapter 3116: Help

——

Although a rank five True Saint was the top elite warrior in the Zhen Wu Country, there were still some in the entire country. With the power of the Third Prince, it was not difficult to find an elite warrior who could compete with a rank five True Saint.

However, a rank six True Saint…

It must be known that the strongest warrior in the Zhen Wu Country was the king of the Zhen Wu Country who had suddenly disappeared. He was only a rank six True Saint!

Previously, the king of the Zhen Wu Country was also the only rank six True Saint in the Zhen Wu Country.

Now that the king of the Zhen Wu Country had disappeared, how could the Zhen Wu Country still have the combat power to fight against a rank six True Saint?

Thus, if that rank six True Saint from the Holy Feather Sect had arrived in the Zhen Wu Country and gathered with the Sixth Prince to attack them directly, they would not have any room to resist.

“Humph, a level six True Saint…so what?” A fierce light flashed in the Third Prince’s eyes like an electric arc. “If Ah Qing could find the Holy Feather Sect to help, wouldn’t I find helpers?” A rank six True Saint was indeed invincible in the Zhen Wu Country. However, this was the First Heaven, where the number of experts was as high as the clouds. It would not be difficult to find one or two rank six True Saints!

The Third Prince’s face was gloomy, but he already had an idea in his heart.

Immediately, the Third Prince took out a communication talisman and used it to communicate with others.

After a short moment, the Third Prince revealed a bright smile. “Everyone, there is no need to rush. It won’t be long before the helpers that I have invited will arrive.”

Hearing the Third Prince’s words, the powerhouses in the palace looked at each other in dismay and felt much more at ease.

The Third Prince began to wait.

This wait only lasted for ten days.

In front of the huge mansion where the Third Prince lived, two figures sped over and stopped in mid-air.

“Mu Feng!”

A majestic voice came from one of the people’s mouth and resounded in the world.

Mu Feng was the Third Prince’s real name. There were many people who knew this real name, but usually, no one dared to call him by his name. Most people called him His Highness or the Third Prince.

But now, the person who came called the Third Prince by his name. Moreover, when the Third Prince heard this voice, he was not angry, but happy instead.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Surrounded by a group of people, the Third Prince’s figure immediately appeared in front of the two people.

“Haha, Brother Yixiao.” The Third Prince laughed heartily, and his eyes were filled with joy.

The person whom the third prince called ‘Brother Yixiao’ was actually a blood-haired young man dressed in luxurious clothes. This blood-haired young man had a cold expression, and he carried a blood-colored battle saber on his back. His aura was especially cold.

Chu Yixiao was a genius disciple from the Purple Heaven Pavilion. He had a cold temperament, but when he saw the Third Prince arrive, a rare smile appeared on Chu Yixiao’s face, “Mu Feng, we haven’t seen each other for a long time. Is it good to see you?”

“It’s alright. It’s just that I’ve encountered some trouble recently.” The Third Prince deliberately sighed. After that, he turned his gaze toward a white-bearded old man beside Chu Yixiao. That white-bearded old man’s gaze was cloudy, standing there, his entire person looked like a celestial being.

“Brother Yixiao, who is this senior?” The Third Prince asked.

“This is deacon long from my Purple Sky Pavilion. I know that you’ve encountered some trouble. You’re worried that I won’t be able to resolve it by myself, so I’ve invited Deacon Long to come with me. Deacon Long is a genuine rank six True Saint. Moreover, his strength isn’t ordinary.” Chu Yixiao said.

“Rank six True Saint?” The third Prince’s eyes lit up, but he immediately bowed. “Mu Feng greets Deacon Long!”

“Get up.” The sage-like white-bearded old man, Deacon Long, glanced indifferently at the Third Prince. “This old man has come because of Yixiao. Tell me, what do you want this old man to do for you?”

“There is no rush. I have already ordered someone to prepare a banquet. Let’s drink while we talk. What do you think?” The Third Prince said.

“Okay.” Yixiao nodded. Immediately, the three of them returned to the magnificent palace.

In the magnificent palace, wine and meat were served on the table. Only then did the Third Prince begin to recount the trouble he had encountered.

“This is how it is. If the Holy Feather Sect had not appeared, the position of king of the Zhen Wu Kingdom would have been mine for sure. But now, it’s troublesome.” After the Third Prince had finished speaking, he quietly raised his head and looked at Chu Yixiao and Deacon Long.

Deacon Long’s death was very ordinary. It seemed that what the Third Prince had said had nothing to do with him.

Chu Yixiao also slightly frowned. “Mu Feng, this matter of yours is indeed troublesome. After all, the Holy Feather Sect is located near the Zhen Wu Country. Even if the Holy Feather Sect forcefully forced the Zhen Wu Country to become its subordinate, I don’t think anyone would say anything. And now, your sister has become a disciple of the Holy Feather Sect. She might even become the personal disciple of the Sect Master of the Holy Feather Sect. So, it’s only natural for the Holy Feather Sect to help her resolve the internal conflicts in the Zhen Wu Country.”

“No, since Ah Qing can make the Zhen Wu country submit to the Holy Feather Sect, then I can also make the Zhen Wu Country submit to the Purple Cloud Pavilion.” The Third Prince said.

“Submit to the Purple Cloud Pavilion?” Chu Yixiao’s expression changed, immediately, he said with a smile, “Mu Feng, it’s not that you don’t know. Although our Purple Cloud Pavilion is much more powerful than the Holy Feather Sect, our Purple Cloud Pavilion is too far away from the Zhen Wu Country. We don’t know how many territories are separated in the middle. How could we care about this Zhen Wu Country?”

“That’s true, but it’s not absolute. Brother Yixiao, Deacon Long, the reason why I invited the two of you here today is that I hope that you can think of a way. Oh right, this is the gift I prepared for the two of you. I hope that you can accept it.” Mu Feng waved his hand and took out two interspatial rings, Chu Yixiao and Deacon Long each had one.

Deacon Long glanced at the interspatial rings and nodded slightly.

As for Chu Yixiao, the corners of his mouth curled up, but his expression could not help but darken, “Humph, the Holy Feather Sect is just an unranked sect in the first heaven. They have quite a wide scope of control. Mu Feng, don’t worry. Since I’m here with Deacon Long today, I’ll naturally lend you a hand.”

“Many thanks, many thanks, Brother Yixiao!” The Third Prince was overjoyed, but he secretly pursed his lips in his heart.

He and Chu Yixiao were indeed once friends.

Before Chu Yixiao joined the Purple Cloud Pavilion, the two of them had taken risks together, but it was only an adventure. After all, they did not really share life and death together, so they could only be considered friends. Of course, the other party would not work for him for free, therefore, although he did not refuse at the beginning, he said that it would be difficult to deal with all kinds of trouble.

But now, as soon as he took out the meeting gift, Chu Yixiao immediately changed his attitude.

Sure enough, money could make the devil move the millstone.

“Mu Feng, let’s not waste any time. Gather your men and we’ll set off directly,” Chu Yixiao said.

“Set off directly? Kill our way to our door now?” The Third Prince was startled.

“Of course. Deacon Long and I don’t plan to stay for too long this time. Moreover, if we delay, things will change!” Chu Yixiao said with a smile.

“Okay.” The Third Prince nodded and immediately went to prepare.
