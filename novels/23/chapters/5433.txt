"Since you all are uneasy, I'll go in first," Jian Wushuang said with a slight smile, restoring his appearance and concealing his identity.

However, when he looked at Bukun, a hint of hostility appeared in his eyes. Bukun recognized him, but the old man was clever enough to pretend not to notice.

No mercy!

"After I go in, kill all those who can't enter, especially that old man!"

Jian Wushuang wore a smiling face but secretly ordered the elimination of everyone unable to enter.

Being unable to enter indicated average strength, and these tier 5 peak-level Emperors should be able to easily sweep through them.

Clatter!

Jian Wushuang entered the barrier. The stone statue hesitated for a moment, its figure shrinking continuously.

Even when it became tiny and formed a character, it couldn't get smaller. However, it still differed from Jian Wushuang's realm, and in the end, Jian Wushuang was teleported away without the statue making a move.

This surprised many people.

Bukun's father sighed in relief and whispered, "My son, I can't accompany you on this adventure. Remember to follow the Island Lord after entering and don't provoke others."

"Got it!" Broly nodded, then unusually added, "Father, take care. I'm going in!"

Clatter.

After Broly entered the barrier, the stone statue restored its strength to that of a tier 5 Emperor.

In a brief moment, Broly effortlessly shattered the statue, even more easily than Zhen Wuyang and the others.

Bukun revealed a satisfied smile.

From fleeing the Heavenly Realm to successfully merging with Dao in the Western Sea, Broly's actions were significant, attracting the attention of the Turtle Spirit Island Lord, who took him as a disciple.

After obtaining a powerful backer, Bukun was content and devoted himself to cultivation.

Broly's strength advanced rapidly, and his realm seemed intricately connected to Broly's; the stronger Broly became, the faster Bukun would break through.

However, something strange occurred.

When Bukun was a tier 3 Emperor, he wasn't as formidable as a tier 2 peak-level, but now, at the tier 5 Emperor, his combat power was even weaker than some tier 4 ordinary Emperors.

As his realm ascended, his combat power weakened. The weaker his strength, the stronger Broly became, as if it were a kind of destiny.

This was the Dao of Transformation!

In the external world, after no one else could enter, a great battle took place.

In this battle, everyone perished, including Broly's father, Bukun.

Inside the Three Kings Court, Jian Wushuang entered and found a long, narrow passage. Numerous steps connected, leading to the deepest point.

Looking ahead, he could only see up to the tenth step. A bit surprised but without much thought, he stepped onto the stairs.

Buzz!

A stream of information began to transmit to his mind, a formidable esoteric technique!

"What is this?" Jian Wushuang frowned.

The esoteric technique was short and simple, something he could understand at a glance. Without much contemplation, he quickly mastered it and ascended to the second step.

Like before, a piece of information reached his mind with just a glance.

This time, it was a bit more challenging, but he deciphered it in the blink of an eye.

The two could be linked.

It was a supreme technique about the Origin Source of Qi. Th.√™ most uptodatùìÆ nùíêvels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Jian Wushuang continued forward. When he stepped into the third step, a figure appeared behind him... one step, two steps, three steps, and the figure vanished.

"Is it him?" Jian Wushuang thought of Broly, whom he had encountered at the Shangqing Palace.

He disappeared directly?

Isn't that too quick?

Even in simplicity, there should be a pause!

But the other party rushed straight up, surpassing 10 steps, and soon became invisible ahead. It was unclear how fast he was.

In just the blink of an eye, he reached the 10th step.

Jian Wushuang began to doubt himself.

Was the other party too fast, or was he too slow?

The difference was too significant!

Is this the Dao of Transformation?

Jian Wushuang was deeply shaken in his heart.

The Dao encompasses all things and myriad ways. When these ways transform into the Power of All Things, he found it incredibly marvelous. However, he still hadn't comprehended the rules contained within.

Perhaps he could find answers from Broly. Jian Wushuang's eyes darkened.

He continued forward.

A quarter of an hour later, he saw a figure ahead.

It was a tier 6 Emperor, apparently a strong figure from the Turtle Spirit Island.

He wore a high crown, with a face resembling white jade.

It was Bai Huang!

As a sea lion, he was quite famous in the Western Sea.

However, his strength was lacking, belonging to the category of those who were ostentatious but not powerful.

Just a regular tier 6.

Quickly, Jian Wushuang caught up with him.

"Hmm?"

Bai Huang turned his head and also noticed Jian Wushuang.

He had already been somewhat embarrassed at the rear.

Even Broly, a disciple of the Turtle Spirit Island Lord, had surpassed him.

Now, he was overtaken by Jian Wushuang, causing his expression to change slightly.

Jian Wushuang paid no attention to him, brushing past.

In this realm, there was no divine power in his body, making it impossible for him to retaliate against others.

Otherwise, he would have to be cautious of these people.

The 1,700th step.

Jian Wushuang encountered another tier 6 Emperor, still a powerful figure from the Gui Ling Island.

After traveling this far, Jian Wushuang finally grasped a hint of the purpose.

Walking here was more like comprehending a secret technique.

This technique tested their souls.

Jian Wushuang's soul power was not weak, and by now, he had understood some of its subtleties.

The Soul Dao Origin Source!

This rather special Origin Source, Jian Wushuang encountered for the first time.

Moreover, the creator of this technique was likely a powerhouse of the Ultimate Dao, as the contained Origin Source was immensely powerful.

It contained the insight of the Ultimate Dao.

Jian Wushuang was certain that this existence was definitely a powerhouse at the level of the Universe Master.

The higher he went, the stronger Jian Wushuang's soul became.

Combining what he had comprehended before, he was now beginning to grasp a part of the soul Origin Dao.

In his Sea of All Things, the strongest was still the Sword Dao, but the Soul Dao Origin Dao, starting from a drop of water, had evolved into a pool.

Whew!

2,000th step.

Finally, he felt a sense of stagnation.

It was time to stop and cultivate.

The growth of the soul was crucial for his realm advancement.

The Sea of Extreme Dao.

The increasingly powerful Jian Wushuang began to melt the shattered origins floating in the Sea of Origin Source.

Each piece was like crystal.

Continuous fusion and release made him even more powerful.

The last three layers of the Extreme Dao had no bottlenecks.

The only difficulty was how to digest these unmerged Origin Source crystals within the Sea of Origin Source.

Initially, they were fragments; now, they had condensed into an underwater reef.

They became an obstacle to his breakthrough.

If these reefs were not removed, he would eventually suffer.

Cultivation was like a flat boat floating on the sea; it could withstand storms, but if it touched a reef, disaster was imminent.

To smoothly proceed, he had to melt these reefs.

But now, he had only fused less than one layer, with 90 percent still remaining.
