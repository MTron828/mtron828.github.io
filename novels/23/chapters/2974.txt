After a short while, the man in black received a reply from each team.

“My Lord, among the thirteen teams that have completed the mission, only one team has given up. The other twelve teams are all willing to continue with the second phase of the mission. As for those that have not completed the first phase of the mission, they have already begun to leave,” the man in black said.

“Twelve teams?” The man in the triangular helmet nodded slightly. “As expected, the attraction of two hundred million sacred elixirs is really huge. Only one of the thirteen teams is willing to give up. Looks like they all want to complete the mission.”

“Tell them to rest and adjust for ten days in the Dragon Flame World. The second phase of the mission will begin in ten days.”

“Yes.” The man in black nodded respectfully.

At this moment…

“Eh?” The man in the triangular helmet’s expression suddenly changed and he immediately stood up. “His Highness Qian Chen has entered the wormhole and will arrive soon.”

“What?”

“So fast?”

Everyone in the Divine Hall was shocked.

“Let’s go. Follow me to welcome His Highness Qian Chen.” The man in the triangular helmet immediately led the people in the Divine Hall outside.

In front of a majestic wormhole, the man with the triangular helmet and six men in black under him stood there respectfully and waited quietly.

After a short while, the wormhole in front of them erupted with a blinding light.

Then, a figure slowly stepped out of the wormhole.

The person was dressed in a black robe and was only about 1.7 meters tall. He carried a battle saber on his back. His face was handsome and his eyes were long and narrow.

As soon as he appeared, his sharp eyes immediately swept toward the triangular-shaped battle-helmet man and the others.

“Greetings, Your Highness Qian Chen!”

The triangular-shaped battle-helmet man and the six black-clothed men immediately bowed respectfully.

However, both the triangular-shaped battle-helmet man and the six black-clothed men had already reached the True Saint-level, especially the triangular-shaped battle-helmet man whose aura had reached the third level True Saint, he was definitely a true expert.

The aura emitted by the black-robed young man, His Royal Highness Qian Chen, who made them bow respectfully, had yet to reach the True Saint level.

That’s right, His Highness Qian Chen was merely a False Saint, a Peak False Saint!

However, it was this Peak False Saint who made the seven True Saints in front of them, including the man in the triangular helmet, extremely respectful. They did not even dare to breathe loudly.

“Let’s go in and talk,” Prince Qian Chen said.

The man in the triangular helmet immediately led Prince Qian Chen into the Divine Hall.

“Your Highness, this is the target of Your Highness’ mission this time. It contains the information of twelve squads of experts.” The man in the triangular helmet handed a jade slip to Prince Qian Chen.

“Mm, thank you for your trouble.” Prince Qian Chen nodded slightly, but casually threw the jade slip to the side.

“Your Highness, aren’t you going to take a look?” The man in the triangular helmet asked in puzzlement.

“Some of the strongest cultivators are only first-level True Saints. What’s there to look at? This mission isn’t difficult at all for me,” His Highness Qian Chen said. His words were very casual. He was not boasting, but it was true, he did not take it to heart at all.

When the man with the triangular helmet saw this, he could only sigh in his heart, but he did not doubt Prince Qian Chen’s strength at all.

“As expected of the top genius from the Heaven and Earth Palace. He’s clearly only a Peak False Saint and has just broken through not long ago, but he doesn’t put ordinary first-level True Saints in his eyes,” the man with the triangular helmet thought.

“Right, how much longer until the mission starts?” Prince Qian Chen asked.

“Ten days.” The man in the triangular helmet replied.

“Mm, I’ll stay here for ten days. When the mission starts, you can call me.” His Highness Qian Chen replied.

“Yes.” The man in the triangular helmet nodded.

His Highness Qian Chen immediately closed his eyes and entered a state of comprehension.

“Only ten days, yet he still didn’t forget to comprehend. He’s already a genius disciple of the heaven and Earth Palace, yet he still works so hard?” The man in the triangular helmet sighed in his heart before he left.

This triangular-shaped man was only an expert from the outer circle of the War Sky Alliance. He had no access to the true core of the War Sky Alliance.

He had only heard of the three palaces of the War Sky Alliance, but he did not know much about them.

If he knew more, he definitely would not think this way.

One had to know that the three palaces of the War Sky Alliance were the top genius gathering camps in the Beginning Divine World. Those who could enter the three palaces were all super-geniuses at the monster level.

With so many super-geniuses gathered together, there was naturally competition. Moreover, this competition was exceptionally intense and even crazy. In such an environment, naturally, no one dared to relax. Each and every one of them fought with their lives. Yet, this Prince Qian Chen…was just like this.

Ten days. Although it was short, this Prince Qian Chen was still in the midst of comprehending.

Very quickly, ten days had passed. The triangular-shaped battle-helmet man once again appeared in front of this Prince Qian Chen.

“Prince Qian Chen, the time has already passed. Your Highness can set off now.” The triangular-shaped battle-helmet man respectfully said.

“Mn.” Prince Qian Chen acknowledged. His gaze had already opened.

After a long while, this Prince Qian Chen passed through the spatial passageway and descended into the Dragon Flame World.

The experts of the twelve teams who were still in the Dragon Flame World did not know that such a genius expert had arrived.

Only the man with the triangular helmet and the black-clothed men under him started to pity them.

“Two hundred million sacred elixirs is indeed a big temptation. Unfortunately, not everyone can get such a big reward!”

“I wonder how many of the twelve teams will survive after His Highness Qian Chen’s massacre?”

…

In a vast void in the Dragon Flame World.

Buzz!

A young man wearing a black robe and carrying a saber appeared here. He had a jade slip in his hand.

The jade slip contained the information of the experts who were still in the twelve teams in the Dragon Flame World. It also included the positions of the twelve teams.

His Highness Qian Chen still did not look at the information of the experts of the twelve teams. Instead, he looked at the positions of the twelve teams. Then, he directly rushed toward the team closest to him.

This was a barren plain without any signs of life. The land of this plain had already turned completely yellow. Not to mention human cultivators, even the strange beasts of the Dragon Flame World rarely lived in this barren plain.

However, one of the twelve teams was currently hiding in this barren plain.

This team had a total of six people.
