Chapter 3408 On the Hundred Battle Arena

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The next day, on the hundred battle arena.

The hundred battle arena of the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect was located in a special space-time zone. It was enormous and boundless, allowing people to wantonly engage in fierce battles inside without affecting the

outside world.

This was because the news of the experts of the blood ancestor’s bloodline and Xuan Master and the others of the nether ancestor’s bloodline engaging in a battle in the void yesterday had long spread throughout the

entire Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect.

The blood ancestor’s bloodline and the dark ancestor’s bloodline were both large sects of the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect. Naturally, their battle attracted many experts.

Countless experts gathered around the hundred battle platform. There were experts from various sects, as well as many genius cultivators from the Dao Palace. At a glance, there were no less than several thousand

people.

Experts from the blood ancestor lineage and the nether ancestor lineage had also arrived.

“Haha, Ancient Wheel, I didn’t expect that your blood ancestor lineage would have the courage to compete with my nether ancestor lineage on the hundred-battle arena.” Xuan Master’s somewhat wanton laughter

reverberated throughout the entire void. “I know that your blood ancestor lineage has lost quite a bit of its peak combat strength over the years. In order to prevent others from saying that my nether ancestor lineage

is bullying you, I might as well tell you the names and order of the three people that my nether ancestor lineage will send out.”

“There are three battles on the blood battle platform. In the first battle, my nether ancestor lineage will send out Master Flame Mountain!”

“In the second battle, I will personally take action.”

“As for the third battle, it will be taken out by my nether ancestor lineage’s master. Your blood ancestor lineage can decide on your own battle order based on the names of the people that my nether ancestor lineage

will send out to battle.”

Xuan Master’s tone was very arrogant. He had no intention of putting the blood ancestor clan in his eyes at all.

This was very normal. After all, in the current blood ancestor clan, other than Master Ancient Wheel, there was really no one else that he could care about.

After hearing Xuan Master’s words, Master Ancient Wheel’s expression sank slightly.

Of the three experts sent by the dark ancestor clan, Xuan Master and Master Flame Mountain were already within everyone’s expectations. As for the third battle, the Leaf Master was also an expert who had long

reached the pinnacle of the four void realms, among the void four realms, he was almost invincible. On the side of the blood ancestor’s branch, there was no one else who could contend with him except for Master 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ancient Wheel himself.

In other words, in these three matches, only Master Ancient Wheel was confident of winning one match against Master Flame Mountain or Master Leaf. But in the remaining two matches, there was almost no chance

of winning.

“Mr. Heavenly Marquis.” Master Ancient Wheel could only look at Jian Wushuang.

“Master Ancient Wheel, don’t worry so much. You just need to defeat Master Flame Mountain according to what you said yesterday. Now that the nether ancestor bloodline has taken the initiative to announce the

number of experts they will send and the order of the battle, it’s even more convenient. You’ll be the one to fight in the first match,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Alright.” Ancient Wheel Master nodded slightly. He did not hesitate too much. He directly raised his head and looked at Xuan Master and the others with his sharp eyes. “Xuan Master, there’s no need to say any more

nonsense. Since our blood ancestor lineage has come to this hundred battle platform, we won’t be afraid of you. Let’s begin the first battle.”

“Very good.” Xuan Master smiled and glanced at Master Flame Mountain. “Flame Mountain, go.”

Master Flame Mountain smiled coldly, and his body flashed into the hundred-battle arena.

On the side of the blood ancestor, Master Ancient Wheel also entered the hundred-battle arena.

Seeing the blood ancestor send out Master Ancient Wheel in the first battle, the dark ancestor and the surrounding experts all looked surprised, but soon everyone laughed.

“Looks like the blood ancestor’s bloodline wants to rely on the Master Ancient Wheel to win one match first!”

“The only person the blood ancestor’s bloodline can bring out right now is this Master Ancient Wheel. And now, the first to be sent out is Master Ancient Wheel. If they win one match first, even if they lose the next two

matches, they won’t lose too badly.”

“That’s right. As long as the Master Ancient Wheel doesn’t fight against the Topspin Master, he should have a great chance of winning against the other two people. And that Leaf Master is in the third match. If Master

Ancient Wheel chooses him as his opponent and waits until the third city, he probably won’t even have the chance to make a move. This is because the blood ancestor’s bloodline has already lost the first two matches.”

The experts who were watching the battle were casually chatting and laughing.

n the hundred battle platform, Master Ancient Wheel and Flame Mountain Master did not waste any more words. The moment they met, they immediately attacked.

Hong! Hong!

Two majestic auras erupted from the hundred battle platform almost at the same time.

egardless of whether it was the Master Ancient Wheel or Master Flame Mountain, they were all experts at the fifth level of the Void. If this level was placed in the Divine Beginning Realm, it would be the strongest

combat strength of some great powers and great sects. When such experts fought fiercely...the commotion was also shocking.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Ear-splitting booming sounds rang out one after another. On the hundred battle platform, many spatial cracks spread out like a spider web. The entire hundred battle platform was filled with an aura that could destroy

the world.

At this moment, these two people were already engaged in an incomparably violent and fierce battle. The two of them were madly clashing and killing each other.

Master Ancient Wheel grasped the three great laws of darkness, earth, and lightning at the same time. The two great principles of darkness and lightning had already perfectly fused together. That attack was

incomparably violent. Along with the battle saber in his hand, he slashed out time and time again.

Each slash seemed to be able to destroy the world.

As for Master Flame Mountain, he grasped the three great principles of life and death, wind, and fire at the same time. Within them, the two great principles of wind and fire were compatible with each other. Fire

borrowed the power of the wind, and its power soared explosively. With a casual wave of his hand, a sea of fire filled the sky. He wore a scarlet red glove in his hand, with a casual palm strike, a huge sea of fire attacked

Master Ancient Wheel.

Each palm strike seemed to be able to melt the world.

The attacks of these two people were incomparably wild and violent. The two of them specialized in head-on confrontations. Since this was the case, the two of them did their best to display their techniques to the

fullest on the hundred battle platform.

As the head-on confrontations occurred time and time again, the frightening might of the collision also caused the experts watching from outside the hundred battle arena to secretly suck in a breath of cold air.

However, in this battle, those with discerning eyes could tell that in this head-on collision, Master Ancient Wheel had a slight advantage. Although this advantage was very small, as long as one had an advantage...it

would be magnified in every head-on collision.

As expected, as the number of head-on collisions increased, the subtle gap between the two sides had gradually widened. Master Flame Mountain gradually fell into a disadvantage, and even began to be suppressed by

Master Ancient Wheel.

“Master Flame Mountain is going to lose.”

Jian Wushuang looked calmly at everything in the hundred-battle arena.

Not long after Jian Wushuang said this, a shocking boom was heard in the center of the hundred-battle arena, and Master Flame Mountain’s somewhat miserable figure also retreated..
