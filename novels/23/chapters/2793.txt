In the blink of an eye, the giant black tree was about to collide with the Giant Black Thunder Beast.

As a result..

“Roar! !”

The Giant Black Thunder Beast roared and opened its bloody mouth, swallowing the giant black tree in one gulp.

“What?”Jian wushuang’s expression changed.

Although the sword formation was swallowed by the Thunder Beast, Jian Wushuang was still able to sense it. He immediately wanted to activate the power of the sword formation and blast it away.

However, he soon found that the destructive power of the Black Thunder Beast was far stronger than his sword formation. His sword formation collapsed under the impact of the power, the nine underworld blood swords were also attacked by the Black Thunder.

The nine underworld blood swords exploded in an instant.

“SH * t!”Jian wushuang’s face darkened.

The Samsara Sword Formation was one of his many skills, and it was more powerful than his swordsmanship.

However, now that the nine underworld blood swords had exploded, he could not build a new sword formation. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Your Sword Formation is indeed powerful, but now that I’ve destroyed it, I’d like to see what else you can do!”

Palace Master Nan Wu sneered. After the Black Thunder Beast swallowed the Sword Formation and destroyed the nine Netherblood divine swords, he pointed with his right hand, and the Thunder Beast continued to charge toward Jian wushuang.

In the blink of an eye, the Black Thunder Beast had appeared in front of Jian wushuang. It immediately turned into a majestic black thunder power and completely covered Jian wushuang, giving him no chance to escape.

Crackle, crackle. The Black Thunder crazily destroyed everything.

The void where Jian Wushuang was was completely enveloped by the Black Thunder.

Not far away from the void, Palace Master Nan Wu looked at the void with a sneer.

“Even an ordinary peak great divine paragon wouldn’t be able to survive this move of mine. As for this sword one... even if he survived, his ending would probably be extremely miserable.”Palace master Nan Wu had absolute confidence in this move.

To be exact, she had absolute confidence in her own strength.

He had broken through to become a peak great divine paragon a long time ago, and he was already an extremely powerful existence among peak great divine paragons. Even in the entire Golden Crow Nine Realms, there were only a handful of peak great divine paragons who could defeat him.

However, he was truly invincible in the pill sun continent.

No one was his match.

For example, when he fought with Yin Su’er and elder Tong just now, he didn’t use his full strength, but Yin Su’er and elder Tong were still suppressed by him.

It was the same even when two peak great deity realm experts joined hands. What was this sword one?

The Black Lightning power that filled the sky finally dissipated, and the void reappeared in everyone’s sight.

However, upon seeing the scene in the void, the expression of palace master Nan Wu, who had been somewhat proud, changed slightly.

Jian wushuang was still standing in the void with a cold expression, holding a longsword in his hand. However, he did not look embarrassed at all, not even the corner of his clothes had changed, clearly, the destructive attack of the black thunderbolt did not have any effect on him.

To be exact, it had no effect on him at all.

Because there was a purple barrier on the surface of Jian Wushuang’s body. The purple barrier was a purple bell, which was extremely powerful and blocked the impact of the Black Thunderbolt.

After blocking it, although the color of the Purple Bell had dimmed and its power had been greatly weakened, the purple bell still existed.

“A protective treasure?”

Palace master Nan Wu’s face darkened slightly. “It was able to completely block my attack. The power of the protective treasure is really impressive. Unfortunately, it’s useless!”

“No matter how strong the protective treasure is, it can only passively defend itself. As it continues to be attacked, the power of your treasure will continue to weaken. The purple bell will directly disappear. At that time, you will still die!”

Palace Master Nan Wu’s cold voice echoed in the world.

Hearing this, Jian wushuang smiled coldly and said, “Passive defense? I don’t intend to keep defending passively.”

As he said this, Jian Wushuang’s expression changed and a ray of light surged out of his divine body and fell into his hand.

It was an ancient painting scroll.

This ancient painting scroll was the Mountain River Map!

The mountain and river map had always been one of Jian Wushuang’s biggest trump cards. He rarely used this trump card. He didn’t even plan to use it unless it was absolutely necessary, because the mountain and river map would cause too much commotion, others could tell at a glance that this was definitely an extraordinary treasure.

Because of this, even if he used this treasure, he would usually only use it in a one-on-one situation where no one around could see him.

But now..

“I have no choice. Palace Master Nan Wu is too strong. If I want to fight him head-on, I have to use this treasure, let alone defeat him.”Jian wushuang muttered and then waved his hand.

The ancient scroll immediately turned into a golden light and merged into the surrounding void.

In an instant, the sky and earth changed color.

Within the boundless void space, an incomparably beautiful painting world appeared out of thin air.

This painting world was extremely lifelike. There were mountains and rivers within the world, and there were even nine gigantic continents.

“This is?”Palace Head Nan Wu raised her head to look at the void space above, and couldn’t help but frown.

The experts from both sides who were currently engaged in a frenzied battle on the battlefield at the side were also the first to notice the changes in the void space.

“What is this?”

“A world? What a real world?”

“What kind of treasure is this?”

The experts from both sides were shocked.

They all knew that this wonderful world was formed because Jian wushuang took out a treasure.

But they didn’t know what this treasure was, or what kind of treasure it was, or what its function was.

However, the moment this marvelous world appeared, they could already tell that this treasure was extraordinary.

There was nothing they could do, because the world in the void was too real and too spectacular. Standing under this void, they could not help but feel a trace of awe.

And at this moment... Buzz Buzz! ! !

A shocking sword intent suddenly swept up, and everyone present felt that the world around them had begun to change.

They had originally been in the vast void above executors city, but in the blink of an eye, they had already appeared on a desolate empty land. On this empty land, there were many swords. There were longswords, flexible swords, heavy swords, and all sorts of things, but without a doubt, each of these swords had an astonishing aura.

But on this vast empty land, there were thousands of longswords stabbed into the ground.

This was a sword tomb, a huge sword tomb!
