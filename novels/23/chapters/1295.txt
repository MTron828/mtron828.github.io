Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The Master of Dayu Palace realized that he had forgotten himself earlier. He immediately reined his expression in and lowered his voice as he continued to ask, “Jian Wushuang really resolved the thirty-fifth move? Are you sure?”

“I have been looking at the secret room that he was in. How could I possibly make a mistake?” Wu Cang smiled.

The Master of Dayu Palace couldn’t help but took a breath when he received confirmation from Wu Cang.

While Wu Cang continued, “Even a Universe God in the First Heaven who could resolve thirty-three moves would be considered as a top genius. Every extra move meant it was more impressive. If a Universe God in the First Heaven were to resolve thirty-five moves, he would be like a top genius among geniuses. The most unbelievable thing is that Jian Wushuang is merely a Universe Master!!!”

“A Universe Master can resolve thirty-five moves in ten years. I wonder how high his comprehension level is and how great his potential is.”

“In short, Jian Wushuang is much stronger than even Universe God Qing Yang!”

The Master of Dayu Palace’s eyes were glistening with joy. He also knew what it meant for a Universe Master to resolve thirty-five moves in ten years.

“Look, he’s coming here.” Wu Cang beckoned to the Master of Dayu Palace.

That very moment, everyone who resolved the Little Scattered Stars Game in their respective secret room exited one after another. They returned to the vacant lot and gathered there.

Jian Wushuang naturally went there as well. However, everyone’s focus was on Universe God Qing Yang, so no one noticed him.

Jian Wushuang didn’t mind. After he came to the vacant lot, he stood by the border. He didn’t move or speak.

Besides the Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang, no one else knew how many moves in the Little Scattered Stars Game he had resolved in the secret room.

Then, Chu Xiao who was in the middle of the vacant lot finally stood up. He held his fist tight as he looked at Universe God Qing Yang with rage burning in his eyes.

“Universe God Qing Yang.”

Chu Xiao spoke with a deep voice, “I lost in the chess game. I admit defeat. Next, it’s a real test of our power. On this vacant lot, before the Palace Master and all experts from Dayu Palace, do you dare to fight another match against me?”

Chu Xiao asked and the surroundings became noisy.

“Chu Xiao is asking Universe God Qing Yang for a face-to-face match!”

“This match would be different from the chess game earlier!”

“Yeah, to resolve the chess game, one relies on their comprehension level. Universe God Qing Yang has a high level of comprehension but it doesn’t mean that he is stronger than Chu Xiao!”

“Humph. In terms of strength, Chu Xiao is top one in Dayu Palace. I have never seen anyone stronger than him among Universe Gods in the First Heaven!”

Those inner disciples from Dayu Palace started talking among themselves. Most of them were confident in Chu Xiao.

Universe God Qing Yang smiled when he heard Chu Xiao. He said, “Let’s fight as you wish. If I don’t defeat you face-to-face, I’m afraid you’ll find it difficult to concede defeat.”

It was a simple invitation, and Universe God Qing Yang accepted the challenge.

Suddenly, those surrounding inner disciples from Dayu Palace moved backwards simultaneously to make sufficient space for Universe God Qing Yang and Chu Xiao to fight.

As for those higher-up experts in Dayu Palace, they didn’t stop them either. They obviously accepted the match between the two of them.

To higher-up experts in Dayu Palace, for example the Master of Dayu Palace, the matches between the younger generation were nothing to be concerned about. Sometimes, he would even trigger such battles on purpose.

After all, if there wasn’t any competition among the disciples, their growth would be limited.

Then, the match between Universe God Qing Yang and Chu Xiao, to the higher ups in Dayu Palace… It’d be great if Chu Xiao won. But even if he lost, it would be considered as a training for Chu Xiao. There would be no harm done. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In the middle of the vacant lot, Universe God Qing Yang and Chu Xiao were facing each other.

There was a purple spear that appeared in Chu Xiao’s hand while Universe God Qing Yang had a black sickle. The two of them were giving out an extremely fierce aura.

“Kill!”

Chu Xiao roared and he took the first move and attacked first.

Universe God Qing Yang greeted the attack.

Bang!

There was a loud noise that was heard across the void. They started fighting and the extreme divine power of the First Heaven was released without restraint.

The terrifying divine power strangled the entire space. The sky and earth was shaken.

After their first collision, Chu Xiao’s figure suddenly became ethereal.

“Competing in speed?”

Universe God Qing Yang smirked as his figure became ghostly too.

Wah! Wah! Wah! Wah!

The two figures swept past quickly in the void. The speed was so high that it was hard for the ordinary inner disciples to even catch a glimpse of their bodies.

They could only see the little afterimages in the void.

Fast, the two of them were extremely fast!

“Too fast!”

Many inner disciples in Dayu Palace were surprised.

They were dazzled by the sight.

After a while, they were done competing in speed. Then, they started fighting ferociously. In the end, the most powerful unique skills collided.

Bang! Bang!

A loud noise was heard across the sky. Then, the match between Universe God Qing Yang and Chu Xiao that had been taking place for half an hour finally ended.

“Universe God Qing Yang!”

Chu Xiao looked ferocious as he stared at Universe God Qing Yang and bellowed, “You are really terrifyingly strong. You are the strongest among all Universe Gods in the First Heaven that I have come across. Next, I will put my strongest move to play. If you can defend yourself against this, I, Chu Xiao will admit my defeat!”

“The strongest move?” Universe God Qing Yang smirked, “Go ahead.”

Chu Xiao quickly blew.

“Devil Stars and Moon!”

Chu Xiao bellowed and threw out his purple spear that had accumulated boundless divine power.

That shot… Roar! His rage soared and there was suddenly a devil created from pure divine power. The devil was huge and it ran towards Universe God Qing Yang as it roared in anger.

A terrifying hostility and pressure spread from the devil.

“There it is. Devil of the Stars and Moon! Chu Xiao’s strongest sword move!”

“It’s been a while since I last saw Chu Xiao use this. Even if he were to fight with the few Universe Gods in the First Heaven in the palace, he didn’t need to use this to take victory.”

“Chu Xiao even used this move. I don’t think Universe God Qing Yang will be able to endure this.”

The inner disciples of Dayu Palace held their breath as they watched.

However, looking at the Devil of the Stars and Moon charging towards himself, Universe God Qing Yang smirked and waved his hand.
