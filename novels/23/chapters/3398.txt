Translator: EndlessFantasy TranslationEditor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Haha, my dear Heavenly Marquis, it’s hard to imagine that you would come to me with your current strength and status. What can I do for you?” Bai Jue was very humble and humble.

He always remembered that when Jian Wushuang had just reached the first heaven, he was just a little guy who had just entered the true Saint Realm. Although he was very talented, he thought highly of him, however, he thought that Jian Wushuang would at most have a chance to challenge the

Principles Master.

Unexpectedly, as time passed, Jian Wushuang’s growth rate became more and more astonishing, and his fame in the Divine Beginning Realm also grew. Especially the battle on the Saha Island not long ago, which completely shocked the entire Divine Beginning Realm.

Until now, not to mention an ordinary Principles Master like him, even in the entire Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect, no one would dare to underestimate Jian Wushuang at all.

Bai Jue was both delighted and proud that such a peerless genius had taken the initiative to send a message to him.

Obviously, Jian Wushuang remembered him.

“Mr. Bai Jue, I do have something to trouble you with,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Just say it. As long as I can do it, I won’t refuse,” Bai Jue said.

“It’s like this. For some special reasons, I need to go to the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect to meet one of the nine ancestors, Spirit Ancestor, and ask her to help me,” Jian Wushuang said.

“You want to meet Spirit Ancestor? You need Spirit Ancestor’s help?” Bai Jue was stunned.

“Why? Is there a problem?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, there is.” Bai Jue said in a deep voice, “My dear Heavenly Marquis, you may have heard that Spirit Ancestor is the most cold and difficult person to get along with when the nine ancestors of the Heaven Ancestor Daoist Sect are present. Sometimes, she is completely unreasonable. With your current

status and status, I’m afraid that no one dares to ignore you. However, Spirit Ancestor doesn’t care who you are. No one can say for sure whether she will see you or not.”

“Tknow, but I have to try anyway,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Well, how about this? I can go to the Spirit Ancestor’s branch for you and see if the Spirit Ancestor is willing to meet you,” Bai Jue said. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“No need.” Jian Wushuang shook his head. “In addition to meeting the Spirit Ancestor, I have to go to the blood ancestor’s branch for some other things. So I’m going to the divine ancestor’s Dao field no matter what. The reason I’m sending you a message now is that I hope you can tell the people of the

blood ancestor’s branch for me. Don’t let me be turned away when I come to see you.”

Jian Wushuang had already been rejected twice, and each time, he had been rejected directly.

But he could not keep fighting his way in, could he?

“That’s easy.” Bai Jue smiled and said, “How about this, my friend, you can come to the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect now. I will inform the blood ancestor lineage in advance, and then I will personally lead you to visit the blood clan.”

“Thank you for your help,” Jian Wushuang said gratefully.

After the transmission was cut off, Jian Wushuang looked at Demon Master Chenhuo and asked, “Chenhuo, are you interested in following me to the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect?”

“Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect?” Demon Master Chenhuo’s expression changed. “It’s said that the nine ancestors of the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect are all super experts. When the Amethyst Demon Sect was alive, I had always yearned to fight with one of the nine ancestors, but I never had the chance. Now

that I have the chance, of course, I have to go. It would be even better if I could fight one or two of the nine ancestors in the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect.”

“Haha, let’s go then.”

Jian Wushuang laughed heartily and immediately left with Chenhuo.

The three Freedom Alliances of the Divine Beginning Realm were widely recognized as the three overlords of ambition. To a certain extent, even the three Saint Realms were extremely fearful of the three Freedom Alliances.

The three Freedom Alliances’ lairs were also quite special.

For example, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance directly occupied two huge stars as their lairs. Moreover, these two stars were forcefully refined by someone with great methods. They were not born naturally in the Divine Beginning Realm.

The Temporal Temple was synonymous with mystery. No one knew the exact location of their lairs. Even the experts of the Temporal Temple could only rely on special methods to enter their lairs.

As for the appearance of the Heavenly Ancestor, his lair was also very unique. It was located on a floating piece of land outside the Third Heaven.

This piece of land was a huge battlefield. Many years ago, the leader of the Heavenly Ancestor Daoist Sect, the heavenly ancestor, had transferred it from the Cosmic Battlefield. In other words, this piece of land did not belong to the Divine Beginning Realm, it belonged to the vast universe.

Naturally, this land was very different from the other places in the Divine Beginning Realm. The conditions for cultivation were much better than the other places in the Divine Beginning Realm.

The huge floating land was completely covered by a magnificent formation. At the front of the formation, besides many guards standing at the entrance, there were also two figures emitting magnificent auras standing there.

They were both Principles Masters. One of them was Bai Jue, who Jian Wushuang had sent a message to, and the other was Master Ku!

Back in the Blood Wave Realm, countless Immortal Saints fought for the opportunity of the Blood Wave Realm. Master Ku was the strongest Immortal Saint in the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect. He had also received a Blood Wave Token, from then on, he broke through to become the Principles Master in the

Blood Wave Realm.

“My young friend, the Heavenly Marquis, has already sent me a message. He will arrive soon,” said Bai Jue.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis…” Hearing this name again, Master Ku’s expression was extremely complicated. “Previously in the Blood Wave Realm, this Heavenly Sword Marquis was on equal footing with me. In the beginning, he was even much weaker than me. But now, although he is still an Immortal

Saint, his strength has long surpassed mine. I really don’t know how he cultivated.”

“You don’t have to be discouraged. I heard from your blood clan that you have already opened the heaven and earth secret realm. I’m afraid that it won’t take long for you to complete it. Once you open the heaven and earth secret realm, you will gain another portion of the power of your will. That will be

the ruler of the principles of the second realm of the void. Compared to my little friend, the difference isn’t too big,” Bai Jue said.

“How can it not be too different? Four hundred years ago, on the Saha Island, this Heavenly Sword Marquis could already fight against experts at the four void realms. Now that four hundred years have passed, he must be even stronger.” Master Ku curled his lips.

Beside him, the guards of the Heavenly Ancestor Daoist Sect watched in astonishment as these two leisurely chatted.

They were well aware of their strength and status in the Heavenly Ancestor Daoist Sect.

“Lord Hundred Absolute and Master Ku are standing here at the same time. Clearly, they are waiting for someone. But who is it that made these two lords wait here?” Those guards were extremely curious.

Not long after, two human figures rushed over from the void in front of them.
