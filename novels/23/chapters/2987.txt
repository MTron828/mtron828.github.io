Chapter 2988: What a Pity! What a Pity!

——

Although Mo Shan did not finish his sentence, his meaning was clear.

Under normal circumstances, the heaven-cleaving union would only invite the same genius once. Only those super-geniuses who were very, very talented would have the opportunity to invite him a second time.

For example, Jian Wushuang, a Divine Master, had the battle strength of a second rank True Saint. It was incredible. He was the kind of genius who could be invited a second time.

However, if Jian Wushuang refused the second time, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance would never invite him a third time.

In the history of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, there had never been a genius who had invited the same genius three times.

Hearing Mo Shan’s words, Jian Wushuang sighed in his heart.

It was not that he was not interested in the Three Palaces. He also knew that entering the Three Palaces to cultivate was much faster than cultivating alone. There would be more room for growth and more achievements in the future.

However, he had too many concerns, so he did not dare to appear in the eyes of the top experts of the major forces.

“Master Mo Shan, I’m sorry.”

Jian Wushuang said one last word, bowed respectfully, and then turned to leave.

Mo Shan looked at Jian Wushuang’s back, still frowning, but he did not ask him to stay.

Until Jian Wushuang left, Mo Shan began to ponder.

“I have already used a special method to guide him, and it seems that he is obviously interested in the chaos palace, but in the end, he still refused?” Mo Shan’s expression was quite strange.

He had been watching Jian Wushuang’s reaction. When he saw that Jian Wushuang was tempted by his words, he thought it was going to be a success. He did not expect Jian Wushuang to reject him at the last moment, and so completely, he did not even have time to finish talking about the rights and benefits of some disciples of the Chaos Palace. Obviously, there was no room for negotiation.

“He was obviously tempted, but he refused to join the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Could it be that this little guy has a grudge against a big figure of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and has many concerns?” Mo Shan muttered.

No matter what, Jian Wushuang was only a Divine Master, and he was just a little guy to the huge Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

Such a little guy would never have a deep grudge with the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Even if there was a grudge, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance would probably not continue to blame him because of his high talent, under such circumstances, Jian Wushuang still had so many misgivings.

In his opinion, there was only one possibility, which was that Jian Wushuang had a deep personal enmity with an expert of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

“The second invitation was rejected, so the Heaven-cleaving Alliance will definitely not invite him a third time. It seems that this super-genius is destined to be unable to become a disciple of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. What a pity, what a pity.”

Mo Shan secretly praised him and then left.

…

In the Treasure Pavilion, the Golden Light Shadow, Lord Tianshou, gathered in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Lord Tianshou, I want to ask you to find the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“Gold-Splitting Secret Manual?” Lord Tianshou’s expression changed.

“It was left by an extremely powerful Rule Master, the Gold-Splitting Master. It’s a secret manual that combines the space-time rule and sword principle. By the way, it also contains the void swordsmanship created by the Gold-Splitting Master,” Jian Wushuang said immediately.

“I know.” Lord Tianshuo nodded slightly. “You’re quite capable. The Gold-Splitting Secret Manual is not only extraordinary, but it’s also the most suitable for you. Who taught you?”

“Well…” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly but did not answer.

Lord Tianshuo shrugged. “It’s useless to tell you. There is indeed a Gold-Splitting Secret Manual in the Treasure Pavilion, and all four volumes are available. However, even the first level of the four volumes of the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual requires the permission of a heaven-level member to exchange for it.”

“What?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

The first volume required the permission of a heaven-level member?

Was the level of the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual so high?

“With my current strength, completing three earth-level three-star missions should be nothing. It won’t take long for me to become a heaven-level member,” Jian Wushuang murmured, then he asked, “Sir Tianshuo, how many sacred elixirs do you need to exchange for the first volume of the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual?”

“Not much, 800 million!” Sir Tianshou said directly, Jian Wushuang could not help being stunned.

800 million sacred elixirs?

Just one volume?

“This, this is too expensive!” Jian Wushuang could not help but click his tongue.

He thought that he had just completed the special three-star earth-level mission and obtained 100 million sacred elixirs, which was enough. If he really could not, he still had the Destruction Beast God statue. If he exchanged for the Destruction Beast God statue from Sir Tianshou, he could also exchange for 500 million sacred elixirs, which added up to 600 million.

However, he did not expect that with 600 million sacred elixirs in hand, he could not exchange for the first volume of the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual.

“It seems that I have to find a way to get some sacred elixirs,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

For now, if he wanted to get enough sacred elixirs as soon as possible, he had to find a way to complete the task.

Jian Wushuang came to the hall of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and began to read the three-star earth-level tasks.

The endless territory was vast and had endless territories. There were countless secret nests of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. In such a vast territory, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance naturally issued many three-star earth-level tasks.

Jian Wushuang began to read carefully.

“This mission is quite difficult. With my strength alone, I can barely complete it, but the final reward is only 20 million sacred elixirs. It’s too little!”

…

“Although the reward is very high, with 50 million sacred elixirs, the place to go is one of the truly forbidden places. Even a rank two or three True Saints could die or be lost forever!”

“I’m not afraid of death. It’s not easy to kill me, but it’s too difficult to be lost forever. Forget it.”

…

“This mission is too risky. It’s not suitable.”

…

Jian Wushuang read carefully and finally decided on three missions.

These three missions were all three-star earth-level missions, which were quite difficult, especially the last one.

“The first and second missions were all rewarded with 40 million sacred elixirs. As for the third mission, the reward was 100 million sacred elixirs, which added up to 180 million sacred elixirs!”

“If I can complete all three missions, with the sacred elixirs I have, and sell the Destruction Beast God statue, I can barely make up 800 million sacred elixirs.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled.

Soon, he went to accept the task.
