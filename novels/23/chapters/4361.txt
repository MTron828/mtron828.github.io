4363 The Supreme Martial Artist Takes Action

“Damn it!”

In the next moment, Ruler Qingmu rose from the ground and stared at Jian Wushuang with a livid expression.

Since he was young, he had been a proud son of the heavens, favored by the heavens and earth. His cultivation path had been smooth and smooth.

He was born with a Dao fruit, and he had obtained the demon Phoenix bloodline on a casual trip. Even if he broke through a realm, he could make a limit true treasure recognize him as its master.

!!

No matter where he, Young Master Qingmu, went, he was always greeted with praise and admiration.

Due to all kinds of encounters, he had become extremely conceited. He was so conceited that he thought that no one below the Supreme-being level in the entire universe was his match. Even Jian Wushuang, who was rumored to have killed a Supreme-being and was crowned as the number one genius in the world, was only slightly worthy of his attention.

However, today, he was easily defeated by a masked man who had appeared out of nowhere!

The pride and conceit that he had cultivated for tens of millions of years were trampled under his feet and ruthlessly trampled on!

This was an embarrassment that he had never experienced before!

Waves of monstrous anger surged in his chest, wanting to burn him to ashes!

The next moment.

“Dammit, dammit, dammit! You should die!”

The blood vessels on Young Master Qingmu’s forehead twisted as he roared,

“Devil Phoenix transformation!”

Boom~!

In an instant, his blood began to boil, and mysterious symbols began to appear on his body.

Suo~~!

Immediately after, a pair of wings formed from flames spread out from his back. They were ten miles wide!

At his neck, eight heads grew out in a twisted manner!

The demon phoenix was a branch of the Phoenix Clan. It had nine heads and was extremely powerful!

The awakening of his bloodline was still ongoing, and even more terrifying changes were happening to his body.

Suddenly.

“Are you performing acrobatics?”

Jian Wushuang looked at him indifferently, stretched out his right hand in his direction, and slowly spread his five fingers.

If this Young Master Qingmu was really from the demon Phoenix royal family, Jian Wushuang would still be interested in taking a look. However, he was just a half-human, half-puppet monster. He naturally didn’t want to waste his time.

He had even killed a real dragon before, let alone this defective one.

“Come over.”

Jian Wushuang’s five fingers grabbed at the void.

In an instant, Young Master Qingmu, who was immersed in the transformation and his divine body was undergoing various gorgeous changes, felt as if an invisible hand had grabbed his throat. The divine power circulating in his body was forcibly cut off and he flew toward Jian Wushuang.

“This…w-what is this?”

The young master struggled to speak.

He felt that the divine power that was grabbing onto him seemed to be in harmony with the world. His awakened power of the demonic phoenix could not shift the power of the great Dao at all.

In the next moment, Jian Wushuang grabbed his neck and lifted him up as if he was a little chick. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Y-you let me go!”

The Young Master Qingmu, Jian Wushuang, raised his right hand in the air, flapped the wings on his back, and flapped his hands and feet. He was shocked and angry to the extreme.

He still had a trump card that he had yet to use. He had yet to truly awaken the demonic phoenix state, and now he was caught by Jian Wushuang. He was extremely unwilling.

“Venerated youth, three moves have passed, you’ve lost.”

Jian Wushuang let go of his hand and shook his head.

After that, Jian Wushuang ignored him and walked toward the swelling earth on the high platform.

To the current Jian Wushuang, only a Supreme could really make him spirited. As for the Rulers, he had no interest in killing them.

This Young Master Qingmu boasted of his strength, but in his opinion, he was just a frog at the bottom of the well who had never even been to the depths of the universe.

Unknowingly, the entire place was deathly silent.

Everyone looked at Jian Wushuang in a daze. Their eyes were so shocked that they almost fell out and their mouths were so wide open that an egg could be stuffed in.

Young Master Qingmu was defeated?

Unrivaled in the wildlands, with the title of Junior Venerable, the one bestowed with the title of heaven’s son, Junior Venerable Qingmu, was defeated just like that!

They looked at Jian Wushuang in shock. From the beginning to the end, Jian Wushuang had only used one finger, one sleeve, and one grab. Everyone could see that Jian Wushuang had dealt with it easily and had a lot of strength left.

The Stardust Ruler’s expression was one of shock and disbelief as he muttered, “Impossible, absolutely impossible. Young Master Qingmu is an invincible existence. He can’t be defeated.”

…

“Give me the soil of breath.”

Jian Wushuang said to the head of the Feng family as he stepped onto the high platform.

The head of the Feng family’s heart trembled when he heard this, and a troubled look flashed across his face.

Everyone knew that the breathing earth was already in Young Master Qingmu’s possession. The so-called rules and competition were just a formality to him.

However, the Feng family’s master didn’t expect that Jian Wushuang, an uninvited guest, would come out of nowhere and easily defeat Young Master Qingmu!

If he were to hand over the soil of breath, he would undoubtedly offend the Qing clan.

...

The Green family didn’t just have one Young Master Qingmu. That was a true Ruler power with a Ruler in charge!

“I’ll say this one last time, give me the soil of breath.”

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold and a murderous intent flashed in his eyes.

In an instant, the head of the Feng family felt a great sense of horror as if he was on the verge of death. His body trembled violently, and he no longer dared to hesitate. He trembled as he handed over the soil of breath.

Jian Wushuang took the breathing earth and a smile appeared on his face.

He had finally gathered all the innate five elements Qi!

“It’s time to really open the ancient bronze cauldron.”

Jian Wushuang thought about it. He was also looking forward to what the ancient bronze cauldron would look like after it had completed the five elements.

However, he did not notice.

In the distance, Young Master Qingmu’s expression had already become extremely gloomy!

He clenched his fists tightly, and a wave of humiliation turned into a surging killing intent that surged in his chest!

...

“There’s no way this person is a Ruler! No Ruler in the universe can defeat me!”

“Right! This person must be a Supreme martial artist. Only a Supreme martial artist’s strength would be far above mine!”

Young Master Qingmu’s killing intent madly flickered. The proud him would never admit that there was another Ruler in this world who could defeat him!

He, Young Master Qingmu, was the protagonist of this universe, the beloved Son of Heaven and earth. How could he lose?

Just as Jian Wushuang was about to leave Planet Tianhuang…

He couldn’t hold it in any longer. He crushed the silk bag at his waist and shouted with a twisted expression, “So what if you’re a Supreme martial artist? Not even a Supreme martial artist can insult me!”

“Patriarch, please make your move!”

“BOOM!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a white-haired elder in the center of Planet Tianhuang opened his eyes and struck out with his palm from thousands of miles away!

The speed of the palm was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, it covered thousands of miles and continued to grow. Finally, it covered the sky and pressed down on Jian Wushuang!

In an instant, the Spratly Islands split into pieces. The surrounding ocean waves rose up, and countless seawater rolled up, connecting heaven and earth and forming a turbulent water column!

The people on the island scattered like birds and beasts, terrified to the extreme.

Jian Wushuang, who had already flown up to the sky, narrowed his eyes.

“A Ruler?”

In the next moment, the power of the great Dao in Jian Wushuang’s body exploded and turned into countless sword Qi that interweaved and formed a palm. It collided with the Supreme master’s palm that was coming at him with great momentum and could overturn the world!
