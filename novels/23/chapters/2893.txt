Chapter 2894: Make Way

——

“The Alliance Master killed an Immortal Saint with his own hands?”

The experts of the Sword Alliance were shocked.

After a short moment of shock, they began to ponder.

They were hesitating whether to follow Jian Wushuang to the Heaven Curve World.

Obviously, the Heaven Curve World was more vast than the Pill Sun Sacred World, and the platform was also larger. The Sword Alliance could directly control everything there, which was very beneficial to every cultivator in the Sword Alliance. However, in that case… they had to leave the Pill Sun Sacred World…

Everyone was hesitating.

Jian Wushuang did not have time to wait for them to make a decision. He glanced at Xiao Tiexin beside him and said, “Xin Er, you heard what I said. I’ll leave the rest to you.”

“Yes.” Xiao Tiexin nodded respectfully.

Jian Wushuang disappeared from the hall.

After leaving the Sword Alliance, Jian Wushuang immediately went to Crimson Rock Castle.

In Crimson Rock Castle, Jian Wushuang met Yin Su’er, who had broken through to become an Immortal Saint.

“Castle Lord Yin, Congratulations. You’ve finally reached the Immortal Saint-level.” Jian Wushuang smiled and said.

“It’s all thanks to you, Mr. Jian Yi. Su’er is very grateful for your help,” Yin Su’er said solemnly.

She was telling the truth.

There were two reasons why she was able to make the breakthrough.

First, the crisis in Crimson Rock Castle had been resolved. The situation had been resolved, and her worry had completely disappeared.

Second, it was because of the Saint Ascension Elixir.

The crisis in Crimson Rock Castle had been resolved with Jian Wushuang’s full help, and the Saint Ascension Elixir had been given to her directly by Jian Wushuang.

“Mr. Jian Yi, I heard that you fought against three Immortal Saints alone in the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City. You even killed Realm Lord Tian Qu and Elder Su on the spot. What an awe-inspiring and admirable skill you have.” Yin Su’er sighed softly.

“Well, let’s not talk about formalities for now.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand and said, “I’m here today for one thing.”

Yin Su’er immediately looked over.

“Realm Lord Tian Qu is dead. Without the Immortal Saint in charge of the Tian Qu World, it should be a mess now. I plan to take the corpse puppet army to sweep the obstacles in the Tian Qu world and then transfer the Sword Alliance there,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Sweep the Tian Qu World?” Yin Su’er was shocked.

Tian Qu World was a Sacred World that was much bigger than the Pill Sun Sacred World.

It was so domineering to sweep the entire Sacred World.

However, Yin Su’er also knew that Jian Wushuang did have such strength.

“Mr. Jian Yi, with your current strength, it’s easy for you to sweep the Tian Qu World, but I’m afraid it won’t be easy for you to transfer the Sword Alliance there,” Yin Su’er said.

“Why?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

“Mr. Jian Yi, the Sword Alliance is a big force after all. It has a big business and many cultivators under its command. If you want to transfer the Sword Alliance at one time, you must bring a lot of cultivators with you. If so many cultivators go directly to the Heaven Curve World through the space passage, the price will be too high. Even you, Mr. Jian Yi, don’t want to bear such a huge price,” Yin Su’er said.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang nodded secretly.

It was true that the cost of teleporting from one realm to another was very high.

Jian Wushuang did not care about the cost of tens or hundreds of cultivators. However, there were at least 10,000 cultivators in such a large Sword Alliance. If there were families, there would be even more.

Even Jian Wushuang would not be able to afford the cost of teleportation.

“If I can’t use the space passage to transfer, I’ll have to rely on my own strength to get from the Pill Sun Sacred World to the Heaven Curve World. However, there are two realms between the Pill Sun Sacred World and the Heaven Curve World. These two realms are the Heaven Void World and the Dragon God World. If the Sword Alliance wants to go to the Heaven Curve World, they have to pass through these two realms. In other words, Mr. Jian Yi, you have to borrow the passage from these two realms.”

“In these two realms, the Dragon God Realm is still fine. The Dragon God Realm Lord, the Old Dragon God, used to have a good relationship with my father. The reason why the Divine Void Realm hasn’t been able to attack our Pill Sun Sacred World is that the Dragon God Realm is watching us from the side, which is enough to intimidate the Divine Void Realm. As long as I send a message to the Old Dragon God, or if Mr. Jian Yi goes to visit him personally, the Old Dragon God will definitely agree to take the path. But the key is the Heavenly Void Realm…” Yin Su’er said.

“The Heavenly Void World?” Jian Wushuang curled his lips. “As long as the Old Dragon God agrees to let me pass, I’ll go there myself.”

Yin Su’er raised her eyebrows. She already knew what Jian Wushuang was going to do.

Jian Wushuang did not stay in the Pill Sun Sacred World any longer. He immediately led the corpse puppet army to the Heavenly Void World.

…

The Heavenly Void World was ruled by the Heavenly Void Palace.

The Heavenly Void Palace was located at the core of the Heavenly Void World. It was on a vast and beautiful island.

The island was filled with sparrows and sparrows. It was a paradise on Earth.

To the various forces and countless cultivators in the Heavenly Void World, this island was also a holy land that everyone yearned for.

The owner of the island, the Heavenly Void Temple Master, had long been a legend in the Heavenly Void World.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang had already arrived at the void above the island.

Looking down at the celestial-like Heavenly Void Temple on the island through the layer of restrictions covering the island, a teasing smile appeared on the corner of Jian Wushuang’s mouth.

“That Heavenly Void Palace Master really knows how to enjoy himself. The Heavenly Void Palace he created is really magnificent.”

After mumbling, Jian Wushuang shouted in a low voice.

“Heavenly Void Palace Master, get out here!”

“Get out here!”

A mighty voice that sounded like thunder echoed in the entire Heavenly Void Palace.

The peace in the Heavenly Void Palace was immediately broken.

In an instant, countless figures rushed out of the island.

At the same time, there were also many shocked and furious voices. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Who dares to be presumptuous in front of our Heavenly Void Palace!?”

“Who dares to be disrespectful to the Lord Palace Master?”

“How dare you ask the Lord Palace Master to get out? How dare you!”

Those who rushed out were all experts from the Heavenly Void Palace. Their bodies were filled with a fit of shocking anger. When they appeared in the void and saw Jian Wushuang standing outside the island, the aura he emitted was only that of a divine master, the anger of these experts grew even more.

“A mere Divine Master dares to shout in front of the Heavenly Void Palace. He’s really courting death!”

“Kill him!”

Immediately, experts of the Heavenly Void Palace attacked, wanting to kill Jian Wushuang on the spot.
