2056 Origins

After the banquet ended, Jian Wushuang naturally returned to Green Fire World.

There were many experts in Green Fire World, including Jian Wushuang’s family and friends. When they found out that Jian Wushuang had returned, they were naturally surprised.

Although Jian Wushuang had only left for thirty years, they knew that Jian Wushuang had gone to an extremely dangerous place.

Fortunately, Jian Wushuang had come back alive.

After a simple gathering with his family and friends, Jian Wushuang began to cultivate again.

He knew clearly what he wanted to do, which was to constantly increase his power. Then, he could protect his hometown, his family and his friends.

In the blink of an eye, twenty years flew past.

In the past twenty years, no matter if it was Eternal Chaotic World or Three-Emperors World, they had been preparing for the upcoming war. No one from any party would start a war before full preparation was done. At least, neither party had fought for the past twenty years.

In the secret room in Wushuang City, Jian Wushuang had sat quietly as he studied the sword principles.

Suddenly… Vroom!!

There was a fierce aura that suddenly soared up from within Wushuang City. The aura was accompanied by strong divine might.

Jian Wushuang was immediately shaken. He plunged towards the source of the aura without hesitation.

When he got there, he saw a destroyed pavilion and a figure slowly rising.

The person looked at Jian Wushuang smilingly.

“Father!!”

Jian Wushuang quickly greeted in excitement.

The figure that soared up was his father, Jian Nantian. Then, Jian Nantian wasn’t giving out an aura of a Chaotic Real God but of a Sir God level!

An Almighty! His father had become an Almighty.

“Father, congratulations,” Jian Wushuang laughed. He’d seen Jian Nantian break through and he felt even happier than at seeing his own breakthrough.

Because he clearly knew what Jian Nantian’s breakthrough represented.

It meant that besides himself, the first Almighty in Green Fire World had been born!

Jian Nantian was the first among all cultivators in Green Fire World to step foot on the Almighty level.

With the first person becoming Almighty, would the second and third Almighties be far away?

In no time, various forces and experts in Green Fire World rushed over. When they saw Jian Nantian break through, the experts congratulated him on his achievement. At the same time, they grew excited in anticipation.

“Palace Master, congratulations!” Hall Master Yuan’s consciousness embodiment came to congratulate him too.

Jian Wushuang smiled and then asked, “Hall Master Yuan, how is Lineage of Star doing? Has Universe Galaxy fully recovered?”

“Thanks to Palace Master, the spiritual influence of heaven and earth in Green Fire World is very pure, far purer than Purple Moon Sanctuary by dozens of times. With such intense spiritual influence of heaven and earth, Universe Galaxy is almost fully recovered. It will be much more powerful than before too,” Hall Master Yuan smiled.

“As for Lineage of Star, everything is in order. Plus, the environment in Green Fire World has benefited the disciples of Lineage of Star too. They have improved tremendously. Now, Lineage of Star not only continuously gives birth to Real Gods, even Almighties… we have already given birth to two now.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang beamed with joy.

Almighty!

Back in Purple Moon Sanctuary, there were only four Almighties in Lineage of Star, including Jian Wushuang. It was extremely difficult to even produce one.

However, Lineage of Star had been at Green Fire World for less than two thousand years but there were already two Almighties. The speed… was naturally far beyond Purple Moon Sanctuary.

“Palace Master, your lineal disciple is cultivating in seclusion too. When he exits seclusion, I reckon he should become an Almighty too,” Hall Master Yuan smiled and added. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He had a total of two lineal disciples.

He had first taken in Lin Lan. After all, he was from Ancient Worlds. He had limited talents. Although he had received many resources for nurturing due to Jian Wushuang, he would at most become a Chaotic Real God. It was almost impossible for him to break through and become an Almighty.

The other one was the extremely talented He Xiu.

He has extremely gifted himself. On top of that, Jian Wushuang had mentored him. He had already shown his spurs in Eternal Chaotic World long ago.

Then, he had already reached the peak of Chaotic Real God. Next, he was naturally aiming for Almighty level. It was within Jian Wushuang’s expectations.

“Oh yeah, Hall Master Yuan, regarding what I told you to check, how was it?” Jian Wushuang suddenly asked.

“I got it done long ago and I am certain that the guy, Chen Hu, who you left in the commoner’s world in Qing Tian Mystery Land, had already passed away six thousand years after you left Qing Tian Mystery Land,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Passed away?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows but he had been mentally prepared.

Chen Hu… Jian Wushuang had met him when he was going through his third inverse cultivation test. Then, he had lost all his divine power and become a fragile old man, so he could only go for training in a commoner’s world. He had gotten to know Chen Hu there and they had been through a lot. Chen Hu could be considered as half his disciple.

Later on, he had passed his third inverse cultivation test and he had regained his power. When he’d left Qing Tian Mystery Land, he’d left behind a test for Chen Hu. As long as he could pass the test within a time limit, he would send someone to pick him and bring him to Eternal Chaotic World and take him on as his disciple.

After tens of thousands of years, he didn’t feel anyone taking the test that he’d left behind. Then, he realized that Chen Hu might have passed away.

“Actually, Chen Hu worked hard to improve and he was very close to passing the test that you left there. However, six thousand years after you left, Qing Tian Mystery Land went through a drastic change and stirred up a great war. Chen Hu, as the leader of one of the parties, although he fought with his all, was defeated and he passed away during the war,” Hall Master Yuan reported.

Jian Wushuang sighed emotionally but he could do nothing about it.

One’s fate was in one’s hand.

Just like himself, he had been through so many life and death dangers until he’d reached where he was.

Green Fire World had also been through many obstacles and challenges until it could secure a standing in Eternal Chaotic World and hold such a position.

If it didn’t pass any threshold during the process, the ending would be entirely different.

Now he was facing a similar situation.

Eternal Chaotic World and Three-Emperors World were going to fight a life-and-death war. As one of the peak existences in Eternal Chaotic World, he would either lead Eternal Chaotic World and defeat the other party or be vanquished alongside Eternal Chaotic World and Green Fire World!
