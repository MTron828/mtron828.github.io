Chapter 2457: Elder Wujian’s Rage

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

On the vast glade outside of Saint’s Tomb...

The experts from various sects were still gathering and waiting.

“Jian Wushuang is dead meat for sure!”

“Indeed, he is targeted by so many sects. He can’t possibly escape.”

“We’ve got news! Jian Wushuang has been besieged by many disciples and is now cornered. Long Zishan and others from the Great Compassion Sect have also arrived and fought him.”

The news spread among those experts.

They were quite relaxed after hearing the positive news.

They had to admit that Jian Wushuang was indeed an amazing genius, a monster level to be frank.

However, he had made a terrible mistake to arouse a hornet’s nest.

He only had one end waiting for him—Death!

In a corner, the three Narcissus Island elders stood together.

“Second Elder, how’s the Lord dealing with it?” Elder Wujian asked anxiously.

“The Lord has discussed Jian Wushuang’s issue with many Elders, but they haven’t decided on what to do yet,” said Elder Linghe.

Elder Wujian frowned. “No decision? What’s there to decide? The Lord should’ve personally come here. Only when he’s here in person can we keep Jian Wushuang safe.”

Elder Linghe took a deep look at Elder Wujian and solemnly said, “Wujian. This matter is not as simple as you think. Jian Wushuang has irked too many sects. Our Narcissus Island should act cautiously to avoid being a public enemy of those sects.”

Currently, those Elders on the island are divided into two factions. A few people think Jian Wushuang is an exceptional genius just like you, one that has never appeared in the Wusha Wilderness with a bright and promising future. They think that Narcissus Island should keep him at all costs.”

“But the other faction with a larger number of Elders think that Narcissus Island shouldn’t be enemies with so many sects as this will bring disaster to Narcissus Island, hence they think that Jian Wushuang should be handed over.”

Elder Wujian’s complexion changed. “What? Hand him over? Jian Wushuang is the disciple of Narcissus Island. Not only did Narcissus Island not defend him, but they are also considering handing him over?”

Elder Wujian thought that idea was unfathomable.

Why would a sect not try their best to defend a disciple?

He thought that Narcissus island should at least give their best to help Jian Wushuang even if they were pressured by those angry sects. How could they even think of handing Jian Wushuang over?

How could a prominent sect do something so unabashed?

Linghe spoke again, “Wujian, you have to figure out something first. Jian Wushuang is after all just an outer disciple of Narcissus Island. He hasn’t been in Narcissus Island long and the most important part is that he’s only willing to serve as an outer disciple even though he had unparalleled talent. Why do you think he did that? He obviously enjoys freedom. If I must be honest and to put it bluntly, he had no sense of belonging towards Narcissus Island.”

“Why should we, Narcissus Island, risk offending all these sects to defend a disciple like him?”

“Elder Linghe is right. Although I must admit that Jian Wushuang is incredibly talented, we must also consider the feelings of other sects and hand Jian Wushuang over to them. This may sound somewhat inhuman, but it’s the appropriate thing to do.” The Seventh Elder nodded as he expressed his opinion.

“You two...” Elder Wujian could not believe his ears.

He could see that both Elder Linghe and the Seventh Elder agreed to hand Jian Wushuang over.

If both of them had that idea, it was not hard to imagine what the majority of the elders in Narcissus Island would think.

“Of course, we are entitled to our own opinions, but the final decision lies in the hand of the Lord. So, let’s just wait and see,” said Elder Linghe.

Elder Wujian scoffed, “Wait and see? Now that the battle has broken out in the tomb, all the genius disciples are besieging Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang will definitely not be able to handle it himself. I’m 80 percent sure that he would be crushing his Safety Token to escape. However, after he came out of the tomb, the experts here would never let him go. If Narcissus Island doesn’t step in to protect him, wouldn’t he be dead for sure?”

Elder Linghe bluntly rebuked, “Well, he asked for it. If he had chosen to be a core disciple of Narcissus Island in the first place and showed a sense of belonging towards Narcissus Island, we would do our best to protect him. Too bad he had chosen to be an outer disciple.”

Elder Wujian was furious, but he had no choice except to continue waiting.

The experts from all the other sects were also waiting patiently in the glade.

They were waiting for Jian Wushuang’s beheading news or Jian Wushuang to crush his Safety Token and appear in the glade.

Either way, Jian Wushuang would be dead.

Their wait did not last long.

Hum!

A burst of light lit up suddenly. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Is he here?”

“Is it Jian Wushuang?”

Instantly, all eyes were on the light.

The light diminished and a figure slowly emerged in front of everyone.

However, the experts present had a strange color to their faces when they saw who that was.

The figure that appeared was a cold and haughty woman—the top genius of the Great Compassion Sect and one of the Twelve Minor Kings, Yu Aoqing!

Instead of Jian Wushuang, Yu Aoqing was the first to appear.

“Aoqing, what’s going on?”

“Sister Aoqing, why would you crush the Safety Token?”

Several experts from the Great Compassion Sect immediately stepped forward and asked.

They were flabbergasted.

Yu Aoqing’s eyes were still a little hollow.

She was still in a daze thinking about the scenes of her fight against Jian Wushuang in the tomb.

Especially the scene where she found it extremely unbelievable.

She was in the state of Self-Oblivious and delivered her strongest stab ever under such perfect timing. The dagger had also penetrated Jian Wushuang’s body, yet Jian Wushuang’s ribs managed to ward it off.

“Junior Sister Aoqing,” Tu Qiancheng cried out again.

Yu Aoqing came back to her senses and realized that everyone around her had their gazes fixed on her body. Yu Aoqing was startled at first before she slowly said, “The power of Jian Wushuang is far more terrifying than we thought. Senior Brother Zishan and I, along with Junior Brother Yan who formed the Four Elephant Formation attacked him together, but we were all defeated. Junior Brother Yan and the rest were beheaded by him on the spot.”

Subsequently, almost 50 First-Class Divine Demons attacked him at the same time, but they were still unable to kill him. I found an opportunity to strike the most perfect attack but failed to kill him. I was then forced to crush the Safety Token to escape.”
