4156 Another Attack

Although the battle in the Fengyang Canyon was risky, we all got what we wanted. A smile suddenly appeared on the Ninth Kalpa King’s face.

The godly medicine was already in his hands.

With this Shen Yao, he would have more opportunities to break through to the Supreme-being realm.

“Alright, let’s go find a place to hide first. After I’ve cleared all the poison in my body and restored my divine body and divine power to their peak, we’ll continue our adventure.” The Ninth Kalpa King said.

Jian Wushuang and Divine Marquis Qingfeng both nodded.

Just as the three of them were about to find a place to hide, a sneer suddenly exploded in the sky.

“Hahaha, Ninth Kalpa King, where do you think you’re going?”

Upon hearing this, the Ninth Kalpa King and Jian Wushuang’s expressions changed in an instant, and they quickly looked up.

In the sky above them, Lord Zhennan, Qing Xuzi, Ruler Silver Roc, five Blood Nether Emissaries, and eight unrivaled Ultimate Rulers were standing in the void with their hands behind their backs, looking down at them.

“How did they get here so quickly?” Divine Marquis Qingfeng’s face turned extremely ugly. Logically speaking, the Tarot Ruins was vast and these people shouldn’t have been able to find them so quickly.

Jian Wushuang and Ninth Kalpa King looked at this scene and could not help but frown.

There was something strange!

After they left the Fengyang Canyon, they had changed their direction dozens of times and deliberately avoided all the experts in the surroundings to come here. By right, no matter how powerful Lord Zhennan and the others were, they should not be able to find their location.

But now, huhu!

“Could it be the poison in my body?”

The Ninth Kalpa King’s face sank and he immediately checked his body carefully. Sure enough, there was an extremely obscure mark in the part of the venom that was still in his body.

The mark had completely fused with the venom. The Ninth Kalpa King had been so focused on resisting the corrosion of the venom that he had not noticed the existence of the mark.

“Silver Roc!”

The Ninth Kalpa King raised his head and fixed his eyes on the Ruler Silver Roc. His eyes were filled with killing intent. At this moment, his killing intent toward the Ruler Silver Roc had reached its peak!

“What’s wrong? Ninth Kalpa King, are you very angry now? Very well, maintain your anger. Next, I’ll make you feel pain in despair, and experience the pain you inflicted on me three million years ago! Hahahaha!” The Ruler Silver Roc looked at the Ninth Kalpa King, and the corners of his mouth slowly opened. He covered his face and laughed in a deep voice. He laughed so hard that his waist bent, and his eyes were full of crazy pleasure.

Three million years ago, his entire clan was exterminated by the Ninth Kalpa King alone. He was the only one left to perform a secret skill and escape from the Ninth Kalpa King’s hands by luck, saving his life.

The hatred of the Tu Clan was absolutely irreconcilable!

It had been three million years!

He had been waiting for this opportunity for three million years!

“You’re looking for death!”

The Ninth Kalpa King was a proud man. How could he tolerate such humiliation from the Ruler Silver Roc? he suddenly wanted to burst out and kill the Silver Roc at all costs.

Just as he was about to soar into the sky, a hand suddenly landed on his shoulder and gently pressed down.

“Don’t fall into his trap. He’s deliberately luring you to kill him.” Jian Wushuang shook his head and spoke indifferently.

The Ninth Kalpa King was so angry that he lost his mind, but Jian Wushuang did not.

In the sky above them, Lord Zhennan and the others had already formed a diamond shape, like a large net, completely sealing off the escape route of the three of them.

Once the Ninth Kalpa King rushed up to fight with them, he would immediately fall into their trap, which was exactly what they wanted.

Although the Ninth Kalpa King was strong, the poison in his body had not been completely eliminated, and his divine power had also been greatly damaged. It would be very difficult for him to fight with these eight invincible Rulers.

“We can’t fight this battle. We can only run.” Jian Wushuang sent a message.

The Ninth Kalpa King took a deep breath. He was not a stupid person. After this impulsive momentum, he naturally calmed down very quickly.

“Jian Wushuang, if we continue to stay together, I naturally won’t be afraid. However, the two of you might become my burden. So, I will use the Divine Kingdom of One Thought to trap these eight people. You and Divine Marquis Qingfeng can take the opportunity to leave.” The Ninth Kalpa King stared at Lord Zhennan, the Blood Nether Emissary, and the others in the sky and replied.

Jian Wushuang thought for a while and then nodded.

He had never been a pretentious person, so he could tell that although he was still in his peak condition, he could not perform the original universe anymore. If he fought with Qing Xuzi again, he would definitely be no match for Qing Xuzi. Of course, with his life-saving abilities and his incredible godly body and godly power, these people couldn’t kill him.

However, Divine Marquis Qingfeng’s condition was too bad. He could not be of any help and might even become a burden to the Ninth Kalpa King.

It would be better for the two of them to leave directly.

“Then you must be careful.” Jian Wushuang said.

Upon hearing this, the Ninth Kalpa King looked at Jian Wushuang with a heroic smile and said resolutely, “Don’t worry. I may not be a match for these eight people when they join forces. However, if I, the Ninth Kalpa King, want to leave, no one can stop me except for the Supreme martial artist!”

This was his pride, as well as the confidence he had as the number one expert in the Ruler realm! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang looked at Ninth Kalpa King’s smile and was suddenly dumbfounded.

From the battle in Fengyang Canyon until now, although he and the Ninth Kalpa King had not made it clear, the two of them had gone through thick and thin together. One must know that before entering the Tarot Ruins, the two of them had been at loggerheads.

“Jian Wushuang, Divine Marquis Qingfeng, let’s go!”

In the next moment, the Ninth Kalpa King’s eyes narrowed, and a fierce roar rang out between heaven and earth.

“One Thought Divine Kingdom!”

Boom! Boom! Boom!

In an instant, an unprecedented powerful aura exploded with the Ninth Kalpa King as the center!

This aura was completely different from the aura of the Ninth Kalpa King. It was filled with a feeling of the great Dao’s mystery. As soon as this aura appeared, the entire Tarot Ruins seemed to be unable to withstand it and emitted a ‘ka ka ka’ sound similar to glass breaking!

Black iron chains shot out from the void, covering the sky and forming a cold boundary that wrapped around the eight of them.

In that world, the sky and earth changed. Many mountains stood tall and rivers ran. It was like a world of its own!

“This is…One Thought Divine Kingdom!”

“How is this possible? The Ninth Kalpa King has yet to break through to the Supreme-being realm, so how could he have comprehended the One Thought Divine Kingdom?”

Even a Supreme martial artist can only control a Divine Kingdom of One Thought after reaching a certain level. How could the Ninth Kalpa King display a divine Kingdom of one thought with the power of a Ruler?!

Duke Zhennan, Qing Xuzi, the five Blood Nether Emissaries, and the Ruler Silver Roc were all dumbfounded at this moment!
