2066 The Godly Spirit“s Metamorphosis

“Jian Wushuang, I know you have a special relationship with the Ancient God Clan, even the Nine-star Ancient God King Luo Yu from the Clan said they wanted to make you their new Ancient God as part of their clan. The brawl amongst the Ancient God Clan seems to relate you quite a bit, so…” Emperor Bai looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Since the issue is related to you, you should step out and settle it.”

“Understood, I’ll move out now,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Okay, if you get yourself into any trouble within that special tribe, inform me. Of course, with your current abilities, most issues shouldn’t get in your way,” Emperor Bai said.

Jian Wushuang gave a faint smile before taking off.

After leaving Thunderbolt Island, Jian Wushuang was not in a hurry to visit the Ancient God Sanctuary and instead he went back to the Green Fire World.

Even though this visit to the special tribe would not take long, the Eternal Chaotic World was under ordinary circumstances. Jian Wushuang found Hall Master Yuan and Jian Nantian, and left them a few words.

Then Jian Wushuang came to an enormous sea of fog. This was Star Foggy Sea.

“King of Venomous Worms.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice resonated across the entire Star Foggy Sea.

Soon, the green-robed elder the King of Venomous Worms had morphed into appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Master.” The King was ever so respectful.

Since the King had leeched onto Jian Wushuang’s body, it was always “Jian Wushuang”. Not “Master”.

Today was different.

The Jian Wushuang of today was without a doubt one of the strongest amongst the Great Emperors, the best the Eternal Chaotic World had, and definitely stronger than his previous master King Luo Zhen.

With that amount of prestige and power, even the King of Venomous Worms had to show Jian Wushuang some respect. Naturally he called him “Master”.

“You’re living quite comfortably from the looks of it!” Jian Wushuang looked at the King curiously. Jian Wushuang had just arrived to witness the King poking fun at one of the fellows in the Foggy Sea. Oh how happy he looked.

“This is all thanks to you, Master,” The King mocked.

And indeed so. As a Plenilune, he had previously needed to leech off of an Ancient God to survive.

But the bloodline of Jian Wushuang was so much purer than the Ancient Gods, the King only needed to leech for a short period of time, extract some Ancient God blood essence, and he would live for ten thousand years, or even a hundred thousand years by himself. With the blood essence, he could morph into a human, moving freely amongst many Cultivators, with no need to stay within Jian Wushuang’s body. Of course he was more comfortable than before.

“I’m here for you, because I need to visit the Ancient Gods Sanctuary. Will you follow?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The Ancient Gods Sanctuary? Since you, Master, have asked, I will follow,” the King agreed without hesitation.

“Let’s go then.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

The King immediately morphed into a mini worm and made his way into Jian Wushuang’s body.

After the King, Jian Wushuang went to find Jian Yi.

“Jian Yi, your current skills, have they been restored to what they once were?” Jian Wushuang watched Jian Yi. He could feel that subtle aura of power around Jian Yi.

That aura, surpassed the Abysmal Saint Master, probably comparable the Second Stage Great Emperors like Great Emperor Zi Xu and Red Dragon King.

“Almost there, but soon. A century should be enough for me to fully restore my power,” Jian Yi replied. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang could not help but be astonished.

Jian Yi now already possessed the fighting power of a Second Stage Great Emperor, more or less, but he hadn’t reached his true potential yet? When he fully restored his power, how powerful then would he be?

“Jian Yi, we have split the Great Emperors of the Peak Chaotic Realm into four stages. What stage do you think you’ll be once you’ve fully restored your power?” Jian Wushuang gave a brief explanation on how the stage divisions worked.

Jian Yi thought through it for a while, and replied, “At my peak, I should be at the top of the Second Stage, or at least near the top.”

“Only the top of the Second Stage” Jian Wushuang sighed. “Not confident to compare yourself with the Third Stage Great Emperors?”

“Master, don’t tease me, I only follow what you have taught me. Third Stage Great Emperors have all a bit of Rules of Order. Rules of Order! What a noble power that is!”

“Even during the Ancient Past, when Chaotic Realms were plentiful, those who could really understand a bit of Rules of Order were no more than a handful. If I was capable of that, I would have joined some influential organisations and become one of their elite disciples! Not been some nobody who’s only good in intelligence,” Jian Yi sighed.

“Oh,” That made sense to Jian Wushuang. He too knew that the Rules of Order were not easy to understand.

“Okay, you continue to build up your strength here in the Green Fire World. I’ll be gone for a while, the responsibility of keeping this place safe now lies with you,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Aye.” Jian Yi nodded solemnly and left.

After Jian Yi left, Jian Wushuang’s expression changed abruptly.

“Is it finally working?”

A tinge of delight could be seen on Jian Wushuang’s face, as with a flip of his hand he took out a bronze mirror that emitted a unique smell.

This bronze mirror was the Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror!

The Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror was a treasure from the Ancient Past, obtained after Jian Wushuang had slain Emperor God Xie Xin.

Back when the Green Fire World was in crisis, and Great Emperor Colored Glaze along with others had charged in, this Mirror had provided Jian Wushuang with quite a bit of assistance.

The Mirror was nurtured with Divine Power. The stronger the Divine Power, the better the Mirror worked.

Back when Jian Wushuang had yet to master the Inverse Cultivation’s seventh step, the Mirror had been nurtured with Divine Power, allowing the Five Great Godly Spirits to all emit Peak Emperor God powers, joining hands to form a Godly Spirit Array, enough to fight against a Great Emperor.

But ever since he had mastered the seventh step, there was an evolution in his Divine Powers. The Five Great Godly Spirits had also start to metamorphosize.

This period of metamorphosis was long, from then all the way to now. Finally it had ended.

That was why Jian Wushuang only took the Mirror out now.

“I wonder how strong the Mirror is now?”

With a glimmer of hope, he summoned one Godly Spirit.

A dark shadow appeared, there came along an eerie chill, as if it came from Hell itself.

This aura was terrifying enough to scare even Jian Wushuang himself.

Luckily it was him. If it was a normal Real God or Sir God, they would choke in the face of this horrifying aura.

The strength of this aura, to a certain extent, also symbolised the power of the Godly Spirit!
