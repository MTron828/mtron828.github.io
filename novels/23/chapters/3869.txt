Chapter 3871: Sword Skill Wave Light

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The power of the sword shadow burst out, and the black hole suddenly shrank and then disappeared.

Deer Bug Demon Ancestor raised his head and looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise. “A principles treasure? You have comprehended a trace of the universe’s principles?”

At this moment, a huge wave had been stirred up in Deer Bug Demon Ancestor’s heart, but he immediately calmed down.

“If I kill you, this principle treasure will be mine.”

Deer Bug Demon Ancestor’s killing intent soared. The long shuttle in his hand turned into sharp purple electric arcs at this moment. Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! It was so fast that no one could see it clearly.

The purple electric arcs directly attacked Jian Wushuang’s head.

Jian Wushuang also waved the Wuqi Divine Sword in his hand. In terms of swordsmanship speed, he was not inferior to the long shuttle at all. However…Jian Wushuang was only a Principles Master. He relied on his perfect life level and many secret skills to perform, in terms of power, he was only at the threshold of a master at the peak of the second level.

Deer Bug Demon Ancestor, on the other hand, was a master at the third level. In terms of divine power, he was much stronger than Jian wushuang.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

After only a few collisions, Jian Wushuang was completely crushed. He looked quite miserable.

“As expected of a master at the third level. impressive.” Jian Wushuang exclaimed, but the excitement in his eyes did not diminish. “With such strength, I can use it to test out that move.”

Jian Wushuang took the initiative to attack.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Streams of sword essence swept out like waves.

In an instant, the void in front of him seemed to have sunk into an endless sea. Countless waves spread out in layers, never ending.

Sometimes the waves were violent and violent, rolling up huge waves.

Sometimes they were gentle, like a spring breeze.

Sometimes they were vast and mighty, like thousands of soldiers and horses galloping out.

The sea of sword essence surged and completely covered deer insect demon ancestor.

Deer Bug Demon Ancestor did not care about Jian Wushuang’s sword skill at first. He casually waved his long shuttle, which swept up astonishing power and easily defeated the incoming waves.

But after defeating one wave, the second wave immediately swept over, defeated the second wave, and the third wave came again.

The waves with shocking sword essence were endless.

After dozens of waves came one after another…

“Is this swordsmanship endless?”

Deer Bug Demon Ancestor frowned. He also found that it was useless to blindly defeat the waves of sword essence that came from the table.

He could only use his strength to completely defeat Jian Wushuang’s sword move and disperse the surrounding sword essence.

“Purple light!”

Deer Bug Demon Ancestor let out a low groan, and the purple shuttle in his hand suddenly burst out with a dazzling purple light.

The purple light was like a giant purple sun that appeared between heaven and earth, shining brightly.

And in the center of the purple sun, an extremely terrifying power suddenly poured out.

It was Deer Bug Demon Ancestor’s most powerful move, purple light!

This move was one of the reasons Deer Bug Demon Ancestor had been able to dominate the eternal dark prison for hundreds of chaos cycles.

Rumble…

The bright purple light directly scattered the surrounding waves and destroyed more than half of the sea of sword essence in one breath. However, it did not completely destroy the sea of sword essence.

Under the rolling of Jian Wushuang’s divine power, the Sea of sword essence that had been destroyed more than half soared into the sky again. The endless waves of sword essence continued to attack unscrupulously.

“What?” Deer Bug Demon Ancestor’s expression finally changed.

How could his strongest move fail to completely break this sword skill?

This sword skill was very obvious. As long as it was not broken in one breath, it could be recovered instantly.

The waves were really endless.

Although Deer Bug Demon Ancestor was extremely powerful and could easily break the waves that attacked him, he could only be dumbfounded in the face of the endless waves.

Deer Bug Demon Ancestor immediately wanted to escape from the sea of sword essence, but the sea of sword essence swept out from all directions with him as its core. He could not escape at all.

He could only fall into the sea of sword essence and passively resist the waves.

“In the Red Cloud World, I created one of the most powerful sword skills, wave light, not to kill enemies, but to entangle and trap them. Deer Bug Demon Ancestor fell into my wave light sword skill. Unless he can completely defeat my sword move with overwhelming power, he can only be entangled by my sea of sword essence.”

A smile appeared on Jian Wushuang’s face as he looked at Deer Bug Demon Ancestor, who was trying to break free from the sea of sword essence.

The three strongest sword skills he had created.

The most powerful was the hazy attack, which was used to kill enemies.

The Earth Guard was a body-protecting sword skill, which was used for defense.

The light sword skill was used to trap enemies.

This move was not very destructive, but its ability to trap enemies was very impressive.

Although Deer Bug Demon Ancestor was a third-level Ruler, he was best at domain and body protection. As for his killing ability and killing power, they were not very strong, now that his domain was completely suppressed by Jian Wushuang, Deer Bug Demon Ancestor could not break the wave-light sword skill in one go. Naturally, he was trapped by Jian Wushuang’s sea of sword essence.

Deer Bug Demon Ancestor tried to break free in the sea of sword essence, but he could not. After a while, he finally gave up.

“I’m so sullen. This battle is really sullen.”

Deer Bug Demon Ancestor was also a little angry. While he was blocking the waves of sword essence, his eyes were locked on Jian Wushuang, who was using the wave-light sword essence.

“This man is far weaker than me, but he is good at entangling people, but he is very difficult to deal with. I am weaker in offensive power, so I can’t break his sword art. I know he has a principle supreme treasure, but I can’t get it.” Deer Bug Demon Ancestor shook his head.

“Sir, stop,” Deer Bug Demon Ancestorsuddenly said in a low voice.

“Stop?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“What? Although I can’t do anything to you, do you want to kill me with this sword skill?” Deer Bug Demon Ancestor looked at Jian Wushuang coldly.

Jian Wushuang smiled.

Indeed, his wave light sword skill was very powerful, but it was only used to trap the enemy.

As for killing Deer Bug Demon Ancestor with this sword skill, it was just a joke. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Deer Bug Demon Ancestor was a third-level Ruler, and he was famous for his domain and protective abilities. His protective abilities were much stronger than his offensive abilities. To kill him…even the five strongest experts in the ninth dark zone could not do it. Unless he mobilized the array’s power, he definitely could not do it.
