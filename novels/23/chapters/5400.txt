Chapter 5399 - 5399¬† Open the Bronze Door

After a brief stalemate, with the reinforcement of Gong Miaoyi, Jian Wushuang finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Beneath the swirling sea, a bronze door appeared remarkably ancient.

Jian Wushuang and Bai Junwang stood on the side, patiently awaiting the opening of the grand gate.

With Gong Miaoyi offering substantial support, Jian Wushuang wasn't surprised. Judging from the expressions of those around him, he could speculate that it wouldn't be long before formidable individuals from the Mo Luo Nation arrived.

The only uncertainty was the size of the catch.

If the prince 'Luo Sha' came, it would be an extraordinary stroke of luck.

A perfect double-edged opportunity.

While Jian Wushuang didn't particularly care about the treasures behind the bronze door, if they were easily obtainable, he wouldn't refuse them either.

There were many places he would need treasures in the future. He hadn't reached a stage where he could disregard resources.

Even after reaching the Dao Merge, he would still have a demand for treasures, especially potent eternal artifacts or unique items like those within the Forest of Eternal Secrets.

Snap!

Jian Wushuang raised an eyebrow as Gong Miaoyi opened the bronze door, and a majestic aura spread from within.

The power within it was at a tier 5 level.

Observing from outside, the interior seemed ancient and corroded. The existence of this cave was evidently ancient. Even Bai Junwang sensed a familiar atmosphere, reminiscent of their era.

"There shouldn't be any danger inside; it's the aura that's intriguing!" Bai Junwang smiled faintly, showing little interest in the treasures.

After the recovery of his origin source, Bai Junwang communicated with Shen Ling. He only awaited the recovery of his physical and divine bodies. At that time, he would truly be restored to his peak.

With his complete transcendent peak strength, combined with his former peak divine body, his combat power would rival superpowers like Wu Zuo and Bai Yi.

The treasures in the Four Great Secret Realms no longer held any attraction for him.

Only the contents of the God's Tomb were somewhat special, and he couldn't exaggerate its significance.

Now, he found himself quite interested in a young girl named Gong Miaoyi.

Perhaps the restoration of the desolate origin source had revitalized him, bringing forth a youthful restlessness within.

Jian Wushuang stood on the side without rushing in.

Instead, he patted Bai Junwang's shoulder and transmitted a message, "Don't be careless; the danger is not inside but outside!"

Bai Junwang, still somewhat excited, clearly wasn't as calm as Jian Wushuang. He had yet to realize the connection between Gong Miaoyi and the people from the Mo Luo Kingdom.

The cave entrance opened.

Gong Miaoyi, rarely humble, turned around and looked at Jian Wushuang, speaking softly, "May I ask, sir, would you like to enter first?"

It was her first time here, or else she wouldn't be unaware of the location.

Jian Wushuang had confidence in entering first. Even if it meant attracting the powerful from the Mo Luo Kingdom, she didn't seem to care much. Her mother had left her a voice transmission jade slip detailing all the secrets of this place.

What was hers was hers, and no one could take it away.

Knowing there was no danger, Jian Wushuang naturally didn't hesitate. With a cold snort, he, along with Bai Junwang, entered the cave directly.

As they passed by Gong Miaoyi, the unhidden greed in Bai Junwang's eyes surprised everyone. Being at the peak of the tier 4, how could he behave as if he had never seen a woman before!?

The two powerful individuals from the Mo Luo Kingdom were indifferent, as eccentric characters were quite common in the demonic path, and they were not surprised.

Yan Changqing, on the other hand, was somewhat annoyed, eyes burning with fire, on the verge of taking direct action, cursing the nuisances under his breath.

On the side, Gong Miaoyi had a hint of relief in her eyes.

Fortunately, she had kept a trump card, agreeing to the conditions set by the Fourth Prince of the Mo Luo Kingdom.

She didn't want to fall into the hands of those old monsters; she feared a lifetime of torment, living in purgatory.

After taking a deep breath, she led her people into the cave.

After everyone entered, the bronze gate closed again, disappearing beneath the depths of the Swirling Sea. T√¥p ùíèùíêvùíÜl updates on n/(o)/v/ùíÜlb/in(.)com

However, when Gong Miaoyi entered the cave, she left a trace of mental energy in the outside world‚Äîa coordinate.

Based on this coordinate, the Fourth Prince of the Mo Luo Kingdom could easily find her.

When Jian Wushuang came out, he would have to face the Mo Luo Kingdom's formidable individuals blocking the entrance.

In the Western Sea.

Several seas away from the Redwood Island, in the 'Turtle Spirit Island'.

Here stood a massive island, comparable to a planet.

On this island was one of the top forces in the Western Sea.

It couldn't exactly be called a force because the owner of this place had no disciples, and the number of powerful individuals sitting here was pitifully few.

Apart from disciples, there were only some servants.

Yet, with just these people, they held control over one of the gigantic islands in the Western Sea, and no one dared to provoke them.

The reason for all this was the owner of this place, whose strength was almost heaven-defying.

He was a renowned tier 6 peak Emperor in the Western Sea.

One person constituted an entire force, and no one dared to offend.

This tier 6 Emperor was accompanied by six disciples, each a formidable Emperor in their own right. The weakest among them was a peak tier 4 Emperor, while the strongest reached the peak of the tier 5.

Two of these disciples hailed from the same family‚Äîthe royal family of the Mo Luo Kingdom.

"Fourth Prince, the deployment of powerful forces within the army must be approved by His Royal Highness the Crown Prince!" A tier 5 Emperor clad in exquisite armor blocked the path of the Fourth Prince.

The Fourth Prince, Luo Chuan, had grown up on Redwood Island under the guidance of his master. Now, at the peak of tier 4, his combat prowess wasn't far behind that of his elder brother.

Luo Chuan snorted coldly and bellowed, "This is the military might of Mo Luo, not a private army of that woman, Luo Sha!"

The Mo Luo Kingdom had invaded the Western Sea, and their main base was on Redwood Island.

With Great Xia no longer a potential adversary, Mo Luo expanded its territory twofold and doubled the size of its army. A fifth of Mo Luo's elite forces were under the command of Prince Luo Sha.

The remaining forces were split among the royal family, with the rest held by the elderly patriarch. Mo Luo had few tier 5 Emperors among its ranks, so the number of armies directly controlled was limited.

Luo Sha could control one-fifth of the elite forces because he had grown up accompanying the army from a young age. Step by step, he had climbed to this position.

In the invasion of the Western Sea, he had been promoted to commander, leading forces without having to bow to the whims of the elderly patriarch.

Now, in seclusion on Redwood Island, Luo Sha prepared to break through to tier 5. Once successful, his status would skyrocket once again.

Although Mo Luo did not formally establish a crown prince, those with discerning eyes could see that, in terms of strength, ability, and succession, Prince Luo Sha was the one.

If he achieved another breakthrough, the issue wouldn't be about establishing a crown prince but about deposing his father and taking the throne himself.

The current Emperor of Mo Luo had average strength and mediocre talent. Otherwise, the conquest of such vast territories wouldn't have left the kingdom in such poverty.

Luo Sha, on the other hand, carried significant responsibilities. Having battled and studied throughout his life, he ruled his assigned territories with impeccable order and governance.

In the Mo Luo Kingdom, his prestige ranked among the top three.
