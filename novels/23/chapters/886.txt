Chapter 887: Zi Dong’s Evaluation

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Indeed, he had failed with dignity.

True to his status as Star Island’s widely-recognized number one King, Zi Dong’s strength was much greater than Jian Wushuang’s.

“He has already formed his own Dao long ago and not just one of them. He has already cultivated the Divine Yin Thunder Secret Skill till Level Two. It is much stronger than mine. His knowledge of the spear is also extraordinarily strong.” Jian Wushuang was praising Zi Dong in his heart.

“Xuefeng.”

At this moment, Zi Dong looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile on his face. “Your current strength is still lacking a little bit, you can’t even make me get serious.”

After hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help but laugh bitterly.

He could also see that Zi Dong fought with him casually just now, it was obvious that he was just messing with him.

Those surrounding them heard the conversation and were taken aback.

The strength that Zi Dong exhibited just now totally crushed Jian Wushuang. And yet this was not all that he had?

“Of course, it is just your current strength that’s weaker than mine, we can’t be sure of what’s to come in the future.” Zi Dong smiled lightly. “I can see your potential, there is still a humongous space for improvement.”

“Firstly, let’s talk about your heavy sword formation, you probably just mastered the technique recently. There is still room for improvement. Once you level up to a certain degree and become more flexible, you can then make me really give out my best.”

“Other than that, you still have a definite room for improvement in Sword Principle. Also, for the Divine Yin Thunder, you only managed to condense one thunderbolt just now. It was also very weak. If you manage to improve your Sword Principle and Divine Yin Thunder greatly, you can then come and fight a real duel with me. You may even defeat me.”

“And if you have enough time, I am even sure that you can surpass Level Three of the black tower!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Zi Dong said these lines with a serious gaze.

Those on the Drill Ground listening were all shocked.

They did not expect Zi Dong to make such good remarks about Jian Wushuang after defeating him completely.

Jian Wushuang could be able to defeat Zi Dong in not too long?

And Zi Dong also said that if Jian Wushuang was given enough time, he could surpass Level Three.

Is…that possible?

Jian Wushuang was also lost. He shooked his head and said, “That will all be in the future, and no one knows for sure. At the very least, my current strength cannot be compared to yours. But I believe that it is just a matter of time before I can fight a real duel with you and even defeat you.”

“Haha, I am actually very excited about that.” Zi Dong laughed, “Then from today onwards, if you need anyone to help you gauge your skills, feel free to come to find me anytime. Anyways, I’ve been on the island for so long that I am always bored. If I could have an opponent like you to accompany me, I could not ask for more.”

“Thanks.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

Zi Dong was definitely a true expert.

At least Jian Wushuang had never seen someone as strong as Zi Dong in this level of the Eternal Realm. In fact, Jian Wushuang felt that even the peerless genius of the Xia Clan, who was widely recognized to be the number one in the Eternal Realm of Eternal World, was not compatible to Zi Dong, in terms of strength.

It would also definitely be beneficial for Jian Wushuang to have an expert to help him gauge his skills.

“I am looking forward to the day that you become stronger than me.”

Zi Dong smiled and after speaking, he turned and left.

Jian Wushuang did not stay for long on the Drill Ground. He immediately returned to his house. He sensed some flaws in his Ninth-heaven Sword Formation while fighting with Zi Dong just now. Since it was an imperfection, he had to fix it for sure.

The crowd on the Drill Ground started to disperse too.

That was the end of the commotion for the day. However, Jian Wushuang remained a hot topic among the crowds on Star Island for a while.

It was incredible that he could surpass Level Two of the black tower after just two years there.

Not only did Zi Dong personally acknowledged Jian Wushuang’s potential, he even thought that Jian Wushuang could surpass Level Three if he was given sufficient time.

A high evaluation like this naturally caused Star Island to become quiet. Even the five Dao Masters were also surprised.

However, although they started to take notice of Jian Wushuang, they never showed up.

In the depths of Stellar Fog Sea, in the lake covered with grey smog.

Lady Red was still sitting quietly on a huge lotus leaf in the middle of the lake. There was a playful smile on her face.

This enchanting woman was naturally Lord Spirit Sound.

Lord Spirit Sound had an Original Body. Once incarnated, the one on Star Island would just be her incarnation. Her Original Body was always on the lake.

“Xuefeng, Xuefeng…” Lord Spirit Sound repeatedly mentioned Jian Wushuang’s name.

“This Xuefeng is not bad indeed. As an Inverse Cultivator, he has now acquired that marvelous sword formation. Most importantly, he has an extraordinarily high level of understanding.”

“He is now capable of passing the test on Level Two. If he’s given enough time, he could even pass the one on Level Three. That is very likely.”

“Seems like it won’t be long before the Lineage of Stars gains one more disciple.”

Lord Spirit Sound mumbled a few sentences to herself. Suddenly, her voice stopped. She looked towards her side.

The Stellar Fog Sea had many misty fogs that could cover the crowd’s line of vision. However, they did not have any effect on Lord Spirit Sound. Her gaze could pass through the endless fog, into the vast Void. She looked towards a huge island that was at the extreme end of the Stellar Fog Sea.

That island was extremely far away from Star Island. It could be said that it was on the opposite side.

That island was also covered in fog, but it was even denser and much more mysterious.

“Gu King, a fella came to my Star Island. He has great potential and has chances of leaving the fog sea. Most importantly, that fella has a definite relationship with your master.” Lord Spirit Sound opened her mouth and her voice traveled through the vast Void to the mysterious island.

“Hm.” An ancient and thick voice was heard from the deepest part of the island as a response to Lord Spirit Sound.

“Why, are you not interested at all?” Lord Spirit Sound found it strange.

“Interested?” The ancient voice paused before continuing, “No need to bother about him for now. Bring him to me when he can really pass the tests on Star Island.”

After speaking, the voice disappeared completely.

Sitting on the huge lotus leaf, Lord Spirit Sound smiled and closed her eyes.
