The moment the banquet ended, Hall Master Yuan gave Jian Wushuang two White Blaze Fruits.

Jian Wushuang took out the transmission token straight away. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Sir God Mad Dog,” Jian Wushuang said with respect.

After some time, Sir God Mad Dog replied, “Jian Wushuang? I heard that a little kid like you currently possesses the fighting capabilities of a Sir God. Moreover, you are ranked first in the Real God ranking list. How impressive. Back then, I really did not misjudge you. However, it’s a pity that you were unwilling to be my disciple. If not, I would have the right to brag.”

“Sir God Mad Dog, please don’t make fun of me.” Jian Wushuang laughed and asked, “Where are you now? Are you in the Thunderbolt Island?”

“No, no. I have just come out of Thunderbolt island and I am about to reach the Holy Kingdom of Dark Light,” Sir God Mad Dog said.

“The Holy Kingdom of Dark Light?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

He had some impression of the Holy Kingdom of Dark Light. It was a Holy Kingdom that was not too far away from the Ten Sanctuaries.

“I will set off now to go to where you are,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Why? Are you finding me for something?” Sir God Mad Dog questioned with doubt.

“It’s nothing much. Back then, didn’t you ask me to get you some White Blaze Fruits? I have just gotten them and I am specially sending them over to you,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“Haha, I appreciate the sentiment. I will be waiting for you in the Holy Kingdom of Dark Light,” Sir God Mad Long laughed heartily.

After terminating the transmission and knowing the whereabouts of Sir God Mad Dog, Jian Wushuang did not waste any time and he headed to the Holy Kingdom of Dark Light immediately.

…

The Holy Kingdom of Dark Light was a normal Holy Kingdom in the Eternal Chaotic World.

In particular, there were border areas in a region and they had been ruled by a powerhouse known as the Dark Sky Fortress for many years.

In a giant mountain range.

Slap! Slap!

Sounds of a whip hitting flesh could be heard. At the same time, painful cries could be heard.

“Move faster. You are so slow. Are you looking to die?”

Some black-armored soldiers were ordering many cultivators to dig for gems.

There were many cultivators and their numbers amounted to more than tens of thousands of them. Most of them were Heaven Masters. However, a small number of them were Universe Gods.

They had all been captured and brought over by the Dark Sky Fortress with force. After being brought to their current location, their lived their days out so miserably that it was at the point where they were better off dead than living. Although the cultivators were filled with anger and grievance, they could not show them. After all, to them, the Dark Sky Fortress was too powerful and it was a huge monster.

All of a sudden, while a big group of black-armored soldiers were gathered together, a purple-robed middle-aged man who was more than two meters tall walked over.

Upon seeing the purple-robed middle-aged man, although many cultivators who were doing hard labor below were gnashing their teeth with hatred, they had no choice but to lower their heads.

The purple-robed middle-aged man was the Fortress Master of the Dark Sky Fortress, who was also an overlord of the whole Holy Kingdom of Dark Light.

The Dark Sky Fortress Master descended in front of a cave which had a seal on it, was at the center at the mountain range and was also guarded by many soldiers.

“How is the progress?” The Dark Sky Fortress Master looked at a soldier beside him.

“Fortress Master, everything has been smooth,” the soldier answered.

“Alright,” the Dark Sky Fortress Master nodded his head. After that, he entered the cave alone.

The Dark Sky Fortress Master walked deep into the cave. Over there, there was a center which was filled with black air and the center was filled with pitch-black vines. On top of the vines, there was a pitch-black fruit which was emitting a sweet smell. The fruit was also the size of the head of a baby.

Upon seeing the fruit, the Dark Sky Fortress Master’s eyes filled with excitement.

“Haha, by using the hatred of many cultivators as nutrients, the speed of growth the Resentful Soul Fruit has indeed risen greatly!”

“It will be done soon. In at most ten years’ time, this fruit will fully ripen. At that time…”

The Dark Sky Fortress Master became extremely excited while thinking about it.

He had found the fruit a long time ago. However, when he had first found it, the fruit was still extremely far away from ripening. As such, he had intentionally caught many cultivators and brought them to this area so that he could use their hatred to accelerate the growth of the fruit continuously.

For the fruit, he had paid an extremely huge price.

However, as long as the fruit was able to completely ripen, the price that he paid would be worth it.

“It’s a Resentful Soul Fruit. Just one of them alone is probably worth more than the possessions of many Chaotic Real Gods,” the Dark Sky Fortress Master was muttering to himself.

However, something strange occurred abruptly.

All of a sudden, a part of the void broke open. After that, an old, yellowish palm came out from the void and grabbed the pitch-black fruit. The palm then plucked the fruit straight away. Under the panicked eyes of the Dark Sky Fortress Master, the pitch-black fruit was plucked by the palm.

After that, the palm shrank violently and disappeared.

The Dark Sky Fortress Master became stupefied where he stood and a weird laugh rang in his ears, “Hehe, thank you very much.”

The Dark Sky Fortress Master stared with so much anger that his eyes were about to tear apart!

“Who is it? Who is it?”

“Quick, find him. Find this person immediately. I want his body torn into thousands of pieces!”

The Dark Sky Fortress Master’s roaring voice, which was filled with an infinite amount of anger, resounded through the gigantic mountain range. The mountain range also went into an uproar at once and countless soldiers of the Dark Sky Fortress started to search crazily.

Just then, two figures were standing in a void somewhere in the mountain range.

One of them was a strange old man who wore tattered clothes and was in a complete mess. He also wore a neckband which was filled with white bones. At that time, he was holding a pitch-black fruit and laughing arrogantly.

“Sir God Mad Dog, that’s merely a Resentful Soul Fruit. If you need it, I have one with me and I can give it to you. Hence, why did you exert so much effort to play tricks on those people?” Jian Wushuang who was carrying a long sword on his back asked with a puzzled expression.

“Hehe, Jian Wushuang, you don’t know about me. I love to eat and I am fond of foods that are very valuable and rare. However, when eating, I like the flustered and exasperated look of someone whose item has been secretly eaten by me even more,” Sir God Mad Dog laughed strangely.

“For example, this Resentful Soul Fruit is merely worth one hundred to two hundred Doctrine Gems. To either of us, it is considered nothing. However, to the Dark Sky Fortress Master, this treasure is like his life savings. Thus, it would be weird if he did not go crazy from anger if I were to steal this Resentful Soul Fruit under his nose. And I like to see him go crazy. Haha, this is really interesting.”

As Sir God Mad Dog spoke, he raised the pitch-black fruit in his hands and took a bite. After that, he ate the pitch-black fruit with great relish.

“Its taste is really not too bad,” Sir God Mad Dog said willfully.

Upon seeing that, Jian Wushuang shook his head.

In this world, there were many kinds of people. Sir God Mad Dog was a true lunatic and everyone knew that.

However, Jian Wushuang also knew that Sir God Mad Dog’s crazy and strange way of doing things was definitely related to what he had experienced in the past.

After all, all the Almighties paid close attention to their prestige and only Sir God Mad Dog did not care about it in the slightest bit. It was even to the point that his name was Mad Dog.

Looking at just that point alone, he was unique among the Almighties.
