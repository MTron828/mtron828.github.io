Chapter 2830: The Corpse Puppet Army Was Dispatched

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

“Corpse puppet army, let’s kill them!”

Jian Wushuang said softly.

Standing around Jian Wushuang, the hundreds of lifeless corpse puppets suddenly raised their heads and released a terrifying divine power aura.

In the next moment, they turned into streams of light and charged toward the experts in the sky mirage like a pack of hungry wolves.

The entire corpse puppet army was mobilized.

This was the battle strength of more than a hundred Advanced Great Divine Masters. Even the battle strength of Peak Great Divine Masters had eleven of them.

This battle strength was too powerful. It was simply too tyrannical..

The moment they entered the battlefield, they immediately changed the situation of the entire battlefield.

“Not good!”

“Be careful!”

“These corpse puppets...”

The expressions of the experts from the Heavenly Mirage World Camp changed drastically.

They originally had an absolute advantage and could even be said to be crushing. However, with these corpse puppets entering the battlefield, the situation was completely reversed in terms of Great Divine Masters’ battle strength.

One had to know that the Heavenly Mirage World Camp had less than 160 Great Divine Masters in total, and more than half of them were low-level Great Divine Masters.

But now, the corpse puppet army was made up of high-level Great Divine Masters. The weakest was a high-level Great Divine Master, and there were also quite a few high-level Peak Great Divine Masters. With such formidable combat strength... even without the Great Divine Masters of the Pill Sun Sacred World... the corpse puppet army alone should be enough to fight these Great Divine Masters of the Heavenly Void World.

If the Pill Sun Sacred World had nearly 70 Great Divine Masters, the gap would be too great.

It was even greater than the Heavenly Void World Camp’s advantage over the Pill Sun Sacred World Camp.

“Kill!”

“Kill them!”

“Leave all these bastards of the Heavenly Void World behind!”

The experts of the Pill Sun Sacred World were all extremely excited when they saw such a powerful corpse puppet army join the battlefield as their own camp.

The morale of the Pill Sun Sacred World camp also soared. Many experts also attacked with all their might. Together with the corpse puppet army, they began to crush the Heavenly Void World Camp.

“Damn it. Sword One, where did he get so many corpse puppets?”

“These corpse puppets are too troublesome!”

Chen Kong’s face was gloomy in the Heavenly Ethereal Realm’s camp. He had already fought with a golden-armored corpse puppet.

This golden-armored corpse puppet was naturally not his opponent in a one-on-one fight. However, there were too many corpse puppets around, which made him feel even more troubled.

And at this moment...

Weng!

A blood-colored figure suddenly appeared in front of him. That blood-colored figure clenched his fist once again, and blood clouds rolled down. A huge fist directly smashed towards Chen Kong’s face.

Chen Kong was shocked, but he was not afraid at all. He similarly swung his fist, wanting to block that blood-colored figure’s fist head-on.

Bang!

The two fists collided head-on. At the moment of collision, the sound of bones cracking was immediately heard.

Chen Kong was frightened.

“This... this power...”

Chen Kong looked at the blood-red figure in front of him. He did not expect the power contained in the blood-red figure’s fist to be so terrifying. When the fist collided with his, the bones in his right arm... exploded.

A terrifying power even passed through his arm and directly into his divine body.

“Pu!”

Chen Kong’s divine body trembled and he immediately spat out a mouthful of blood. His body also shot backward in a sorry state.

At the same time, he let out a fierce shout.

“Invincible Divine Master!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“It’s a corpse puppet at the level of invincible Divine Master!”

Chen Kong’s shout was incomparably loud and clear, reverberating throughout the entire battlefield.

The many experts who were frantically fighting on the battlefield all heard this shout.

In an instant, many gazes locked onto the blood-colored figure.

The blood-colored figure was similarly lifeless. Clearly, it was also a corpse puppet. However, they had already noticed that although it was also a corpse puppet, the aura emitted by this blood-colored corpse puppet was far more powerful than those golden-armored corpse puppets.

There was no doubt that this was indeed a corpse puppet at the level of an Invincible Divine Master.

“Damn it, there are even corpse puppets at the level of an Invincible Divine Master.” The Heavenly Void Army commander’s expression changed drastically, and he could not help but curse in his heart.

Just the corpse puppet army made up of copper-armored, silver-armored, and golden-armored corpse puppets had put them at a peerless disadvantage when they entered the battlefield. They had even been completely crushed. In the end, this corpse puppet army... there was even a blood-armored corpse puppet at the level of an Invincible Divine Master...

After all, an Invincible Divine Master was far superior to many Great Divine Masters.

He could slaughter a Great Divine Master, or even a Great Divine Master at the peak, all by himself.

The Marquis of Three Yin was the only Invincible Divine Master present in the Heavenly Void World. Jian Wushuang, who was on par with the Marquis of Three Yin in the Pill Sun Sacred World, naturally had Invincible Divine Master’s combat strength.

Since the beginning of the battle, the two Invincible Divine Masters had only been able to keep each other in check.

However, if either side suddenly made a move, it would be a disaster for the experts of the other side.

But now, the Marquis of Three Yin and Jian Wushuang were both still in a stalemate. Neither side could make a move, but the Pill Sun Sacred World had one more Invincible Divine Master...

Swish!

On the battlefield, the blood-red corpse puppet rampaged through the crowd, wantonly attacking the experts of the Heavenly Void World.

The blood-red corpse puppet was not good at speed, but it was extremely powerful. Its fists kept striking out. The terrifying power contained in those fists was enough to easily kill an Advanced Divine Master, and a Peak Divine Master would be severely injured by it, although they could not die, they would still be heavily injured.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

One fist after another was blasted out. In the blink of an eye, a total of eleven Great Divine Masters of the Heavenly Void Army had died at the hands of this blood-colored corpse puppet, and two Peak Great Divine Masters had been heavily injured by it.

It was unstoppable!

No one could stop the blood-colored corpse puppet’s footsteps.

He rampaged through the crowd and massacred wantonly.

This made the battlefield, which was already tilted toward the Pill Sun Sacred World, even more so.

The commander of the Heavenly Void Army also joined in the battle. As he fought, he was also constantly concerned about the changes in the situation on the battlefield.

The situation in front of him was naturally seen by the commander of the Heavenly Void Army.

“This corpse puppet army is too powerful. With the existence of that blood-armored corpse puppet, their overall combat power is much stronger than our camp. Our camp has suffered heavy losses from the battle until now, and we are on the verge of defeat. If we continue to fight fiercely... we will only lose more experts!”

The commander of the Heavenly Void Army narrowed his eyes, soon, he made up his mind.

“Those who belong to the Heavenly Oasis, retreat! All of you, retreat!”
