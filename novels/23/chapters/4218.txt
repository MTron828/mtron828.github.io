“You talk too much.”

Jian Wushuang’s expression was calm and he looked at Yin Yang Divine Lords indifferently.

In the next moment, Jian Wushuang’s body swayed and he charged toward the Yin Yang Divine Lords.

“Hmph, arrogant!”

!!

Yin Yang Divine Lords looked at each other and shouted in unison, “Divine power, Flame Dragon!”

“Sacred art, ten thousand miles of ice and frost!”

In an instant, the temperature in the area where Jian Wushuang was at dropped sharply. An extremely cold power of principles fell and countless broken arms and ruins turned into ice sculptures.

Under the power of the cold, everything slowed down. A thin layer of frost formed on Jian Wushuang’s Wuqi Divine Sword.

Moreover, the frost continued to extend upwards along the blade of Wuqi Divine Sword as if it was going to freeze Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank slightly. He could feel that under the power of the ice, the divine power that was boiling in his body started to slow down.

And this was not the end!

The divine power in the Yang Divine Lord’s hands surged. He pulled with both hands, and countless divine power gathered and turned into a huge flaming dragon that could swallow the sun.

“Go!”

The Yang Divine Lord’s red hair flew in the wind as he pushed forward. In an instant, the huge fire dragon flowing with lava let out a roar that shook the nine heavens and ten lands. It bared its fangs and brandished its claws as it bit at Jian Wushuang!

The two killing moves from Yin Yang Divine Lords were aimed at Jian Wushuang!

Even Jian Wushuang’s face turned grave when he saw the two killing moves.

After the Yin Yang Divine Lords was done, he immediately put his hands behind his back and looked at each other with a touch of pride on his face.

Before the two of them were subdued by the evil-looking young man, they were famous Ultimate Rulers in the universe and the big shots of the eighth city.

They were confident that it would not be a problem for them to take down Jian Wushuang, who was only a fifth stage great Ruler, with their combined strength.

“Roar roar roar!”

The Yang Divine Lord’s fierce divine power had transformed into a magma dragon. It hovered in the sky, and a huge heat wave was spewing out of its nose, burning the void.

On the ground, thousands of miles of glaciers had formed. The ground under Jian Wushuang’s feet was covered in frost. The broken walls and ruins had turned into huge ice sculptures. The whole world seemed to have turned into a World of Ice and snow.

The nomological origin power that the two of them had comprehended, one extreme yin and one extreme yang, could change the world and was extremely terrifying when they executed it together.

Jian Wushuang held the Wuqi Divine Sword in his hand and stepped into the void as if he was trapped in a world of ice and fire. His expression became a little serious.

“As expected of an expert from the back city. He’s much stronger than the Rulers of the first five cities.” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

The ancient path of stars was worthy of being the place where all the Rulers of the universe gathered. Not only were there many Ultimate Rulers, but their quality was also several levels higher than the outside world.

If this Yin Yang Divine Lord was in the outside world, he would definitely not appear as a Supreme. He was an existence that could dominate a region at the Ruler realm. However, in the end, he had become someone’s servant on the ancient path of stars. He had not even entered the back eight cities where true experts were.

Jian Wushuang had long heard that the 10th city was the dividing line among the 18 cities on the ancient road of stars. The real experts, the abnormal existences among the Rulers and the geniuses, all fought in the last eight cities.

Jian Wushuang gathered his thoughts and looked at Yin Yang Divine Lord indifferently. He said, “This principles of yin and yang isn’t bad. If I continue to grow, I might be able to reach the threshold of a One Thought Divine Kingdom.

Yin Divine Lord and Yang Divine Lord stood with their hands behind their backs. When they heard what Jian Wushuang said, they lifted their eyelids and looked at Jian Wushuang in disdain. “Blood Sword, you do have a good eye. Since you understand how powerful we are, you should obediently surrender and follow us to see our master. If you make master happy, maybe if he’s in a good mood, he’ll take you in as a slave and spare your life, considering your talent.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Ruler Hao Jin, who had been stunned by Yin Yang Divine Lord’s attack, looked at Jian Wushuang with anticipation.

He hoped that Jian Wushuang would go and seek refuge with the master behind the Yin Yang Divine Lords.

If the Yin Yang Divine Lords were already so powerful, how terrifying would their master be?

A fine bird chooses a tree to live in, and a wise minister chooses his master.

On the ancient path of stars, it was extremely normal for the weak to rely on the strong.

After all, there were experts everywhere on the ancient path of stars, and the killing was extremely brutal and tragic. If one could rely on an expert, it was equivalent to finding a powerful backing for themselves.

What’s more, if the great beings they were attached to were lucky enough to stand out in the ancient path of stars and obtain the qualification to participate in the universe banquet of all races, then they would naturally be able to rise to the heavens and follow them to the universe banquet.

It could be said that other than those who were extremely confident in their own strength or those few heaven-defying existences who had stepped into the peak of the universe Overlord realm, others would more or less choose to follow the strong.

For example, wasn’t he, Ruler Hao Jin, dependent on Jian Wushuang now?

Finally, Jian Wushuang sighed under the expectant gaze of Ruler Hao Jin and said, “Yin Yang Divine Lords, you either want me to kill myself or make me your master’s slave. What kind of person do you take me for?”

“What kind of person did you take me for?” When the Yin Yang Divine Lords heard that, they laughed and said, “Blood Sword, oh Blood Sword, don’t you even understand the principle of the weak submitting to the strong?”

After laughing, the Yin Yang Divine Lords faces turned cold and he snorted, “Blood Sword, don’t be ungrateful. This is the last chance I’m giving you. In your life, you have to understand that you have to grasp opportunities. Otherwise, once you miss it, it won’t come back again. Do you understand?”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang didn’t bother to say anything more. He sneered, “Idiot.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Jian Wushuang did not hesitate any longer. He stomped heavily and created a huge pit on the frozen floor. His body shot out like a cannonball and he charged toward Yin Divine Lord and Yang Divine Lord!

“I’m giving you face, but you don’t want it.”

Yin Yang Divine Lords snorted, “Flame Dragon, go! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Ten thousand miles of ice seal, rise!!!”

Boom!

Immediately, the magma dragon in the sky opened its mouth and roared, spitting out a huge fiery dragon breath. Then, it wagged its tail and bit Jian Wushuang fiercely!

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold and he poured his divine power into the Wuqi Divine Sword. Then, he swung the ‘sky-opening’ sword again and slashed at the magma dragon!

Chi chi chi chi!

Under Jian Wushuang, icicles as thick as mountains rose from the ground and stabbed at Jian Wushuang with a cold and terrifying force!

“Get lost!”

The light in Jian Wushuang’s eyes grew by three inches. He shouted coldly and stomped his right foot on the ice peak!

For a time, Jian Wushuang was fighting one against two and he was fighting with the Yin Yang Divine Lords at the same time!
