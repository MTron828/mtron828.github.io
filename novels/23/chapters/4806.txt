4807 Chase

For a moment, all the top cultivators within thousands of miles were silent.

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly. Then, he waved his hand and the Yan power boundary protected the entire restaurant.

Rumble!!!

It was the sound of the earth being torn apart.

Following that, one pavilion after another collapsed and shattered. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In the center of the violent explosion, only a restaurant remained standing. It did not even suffer the slightest damage.

Cui Jing, who was drinking, could not help but tremble when he saw the scene outside. However, when he saw Jian Wushuang sitting by the window, still looking lazy, he inexplicably felt at ease and continued to drink.

“Brother Jian, do you need me to investigate?” Chun Qiu asked in a low voice, already prepared to fight.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang shook his head and said, “No, the troublemakers are here.”

As his voice fell, the sound of a heavy object falling to the ground was heard.

“Run! Why aren’t you running anymore?!”

A thunderous roar resounded.

Outside the broken street, two extremely thin figures fell into the rubble.

A Yan Immortal that looked like a Vajra threw two figures into the ground.

An irrepressible muffled groan sounded.

Behind this Yan Immortal, there were another five Yan Immortals, all of them with sinister expressions.

“Damn you, aren’t you good at running?”

Pulling back his feet, the Vajra-like Yan Immortal clenched his fist in the air and directly grabbed the thin figure’s neck, lifting him up from the ground.

“Ah…” His dirty hair covered his face, but it could not hide his pain.

Sticky blood flowed out of the wounds on his skin.

“B-Brother, I’m scared.”

Another even thinner figure was lying on the ground, his hands helplessly pushing away the gravel, as if he wanted to use it to stand up.

The thin figure who was being strangled slowly calmed down, and his bloodshot eyes were lifeless.

“Let my brother leave, I’ll go with you.”

When the Vajra-like Yan Immortal heard this, it was as if he had heard the funniest joke. He laughed, “A piece of trash like you dares to discuss conditions with me? Come back with me, no one will be able to escape.”

With that, he waved his other hand and grabbed the two thin figures in his hand as if he was pinching ants.

“Trash like you are only fit to be medicinal catalysts.”

When the thin figure heard this, his originally lifeless eyes suddenly narrowed. Then, like a wild beast, he opened his mouth and bit Yan Immortal’s ear.

Bang!

A powerful palm smashed into his face. Blood gushed out of his seven orifices, and he fainted in an instant.

The Vajra-like Yan Immortal laughed in disdain. He picked up another figure and was about to leave.

In the next moment, an extremely cold female voice resounded through the shattered earth.

“Release them.”

Jian Wushuang looked toward the source of the voice and was surprised.

The one who spoke was a woman in a gray robe. Her face was not gentle and beautiful, but she was full of heroic spirit and exuded a sense of majesty.

This heroic-looking woman was one of the last seven swordsmen who had wreaked havoc in the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture.

They met several times in the Sand Demon Cave, but he did not know where she went.

But now, they actually met again in this Heavenly Region, it was simply unbelievable.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows slightly and wanted to see what she would do next.

After shouting that sentence, the heroic-looking woman was not afraid at all. A powerful Yan power was already circulating around her body.

The Vajra-like Yan Immortal, who was carrying a thin figure in each hand, stopped in place and slowly turned his head.

When he saw that it was a woman, his violent eyes were filled with desire.

“I was wondering who it was, so it’s a little girl,” the Vajra-like Yan Immortal threw the two figures in his hands to the Yan Immortal behind him. Then, he rubbed his palms and walked toward her without any fear.

A look of disgust flashed in the eyes of the heroic-looking woman. Then, with a thunderous momentum, a long sword shot out without any warning.

Yan Immortal’s eyes focused, and his neck subconsciously tilted to the side, barely dodging the terrifying attack.

However, there was a long and narrow wound that almost cut his neck in two.

It was just that in this one exchange, he had been severely injured.

This made him both shocked and angry, and at the same time, he waved his hand to suppress it.

The sky suddenly caved in, and an invisible giant palm smashed toward the heroic-looking woman.

She frowned, and like a ghost, with an unimaginable speed, she rushed to the front of the Vajra-like Yan Immortal.

The Vajra-like Yan Immortal was shocked. He took a few steps back and shouted, “Crush her!”

As he shouted, the five Yan Immortals behind him moved.

With the combined power of six Yan Immortals, an unparalleled Yan power prison appeared. The terrifying force once again caused the ground to crack.

The heroic-looking woman, who was originally moving at an extremely fast speed, was also affected. It was as if she was in a quagmire, and she found it difficult to move.

To fight six Yan Immortals alone was impossible even if she was at her peak, let alone in this state.

The six unparalleled forces descended and made her spit out blood. Even if she wanted to, she was powerless to reverse the situation.

“Little Girl, you actually dared to hurt me. Today, I will make you beg for death!”

A roar came from the Vajra-like Yan Immortal’s mouth. Yan power chains surged from his palms as he once again tried to capture the heroic-looking woman.

However, at the next moment, a lazy voice suddenly sounded.

“You’re really noisy,”

He subconsciously turned his head to look at the source of the sound, only to see a pitch-black urn smashing straight at him.

Bang!

An extremely muffled sound rang out, and the thick fragrance of the wine spread in all directions.

The jar directly tore apart the combined attack of the six Yan Immortals and heavily exploded on the face of the Vajra-like Yan Immortal.

Then, he fell to the ground with his head raised and fainted.

With just a casual strike, he made a Yan Immortal lose the ability to resist. What kind of outlandish means was this?

With an exquisite wine pot in one hand and a three-foot sword in the other, Jian Wushuang walked forward slowly, free and unrestrained.

The five Yan Immortals took a few steps back at the same time, looking at him with vigilance.

The heroic-looking woman clutched her chest and slowly stepped back. She looked at Jian Wushuang with shock and disbelief.

“Who are you? It’s best if you judge the situation and do not have any more conflicts with my Li Fire Sect. We will let bygones be bygones for the matter just now.”

One of them, a clean-faced Yan Immortal, was shocked by Jian Wushuang’s power, but his words were not polite.

After all, in his opinion, no matter how powerful Jian Wushuang was, he could not possibly fight against five of them alone.

However, very quickly, he swallowed this thought into his stomach, and his eyes widened to their maximum.

This was because he saw four figures that were as tall as divine peaks walk out of a restaurant not far away and stand behind this young man in order.
