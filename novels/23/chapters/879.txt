“She is my friend!”

“Who dares touch her?”

A ice-cold voice spread about as people around felt their hearts stop beating. Then numerous pairs of startled eyes immediately looked at Jian Wushuang.

“It’s him!”

“It’s Blood Mountain! That newcomer!”

“Newcomer? Now he’s been the 13th king of Star Island.”

People began whispering.

The Absolute Beauty also looked toward Jian Wushuang. When she saw clearly Jian Wushuang, her face was lit up with joy. “You’re Blood Mountain, aren’t you?”

“Ling Long, long time no see.” Jian Wushuang smiled to the Absolute Beauty.

The Absolute Beauty was exactly Ling Long. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Previously, four of Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard came to Stellar Fog Sea together. They started with good control, but then they encountered a group of Exotic Beasts and had to flee in all directions. However, Shui Jin was killed while Jiu Zui and Ling Long was got separated from Jian Wushuang.

Over the past few years, Jian Wushuang had no clue whether Jiu Zui and Ling Long were dead or not.

But now, Ling Long had come to Star Island. She survived and had been wandering about in the fog sea.

“You are that Blood Mountain?”

A somewhat cold voice was uttered by Tian Quan as his eyes looked to Jian Wushuang.

“Yes, it’s me.” Jian Wushuang replied, nodding smilingly.

“Well, I heard that you’d passed through Level One of Black Tower for the first two days you came to Star Island. Now you’re the 13th king on Star Island, but your strength means nothing compared to me. I’m urging that you’d better wise up and give the woman to me.” Tian Quan said chillingly.

It’s been more than millions of years since he came to Star Island. It took a long time for him to pass through Level One of Black Tower. He was so powerful that he’d been ranking the 6th among the 13 kings.

Jian Wushuang had just passed through Level One of Black Tower. It was estimated that he just began cultivating the nine Secret Skill. How could he put it in his eyes?

“What if I don’t give her to you?” Jian Wushuang looked cooly to Tian Quan, folding his arms.

“No?” Tian Quan’s eyes grew cold, giving a fearful laugh. “Do you think you can protect her with your strength?”

When he finished talking, Tian Quan began attacking Tian Quan.

An violent wind suddenly was blowing hard as Tian Quan vanished. Then he appeared again before Jian Wushuang, while there was a black longspear on his hand. This longspear had an increasing flow of air around, gloomy and ghastly.

“Newcomer, let me teach you how to respect the seniors.”

A cold voice was uttered by Tian Quan, while the black longspear stabbed directly on Jian Wushuang’s Head.

It was so fast and his attacking skill was also malevolent.

After seeing this, Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes without panicking.

As soon as Tian Quan attacked him, his Bloodline Power inside his body was sprouting up, transforming into Gold-armored Ancient God at once. Meanwhile, his Blood Mountain Sword also appeared on his hand.

As his Sword Principle greatly improved, the power of his Blood Mountain Sword became stronger an stronger.

With the black longspear directly stabbing towards him, Jian Wushuang waved his Blood Mountain Sword at once.

Clang!

A sound gave a deafening aftermath, as metal stroke metal.

Phew! Phew! Phew!

Three black Flowing Lights abruptly swept around.

Tian Quan waved his longspear for three times in a split second. The longspear was so fast that it gave out an violently destructive aura with irresistible force.

Jian Wushuang’s brows knitted as he immediately resisted the attempt of three longspears to attack him.

When he resisted the attack, however, his body went backward for a few steps, thoroughly flurried.

“Qian Yu was right. There were at least ten people who had the ability of breaking through Dao Master among the 12 kings, but they always attempted to suppress their Realms. Like Tian Quan, he is one of them.” Jian Wushuang and Tian Quan were putting a tough fight while he was well aware of Tian Quan’s specific strength.

At the same time, he also felt a uniquely Destructive aura from Tian Quan’s longspear.

“Tian Quan has developed a kind of Dao of his own,” Jian Wushuang said secretly.

There were a variety of Dao.

The first kind was to perceive Origin of Heaven and Earth, evolving from Origin of Heaven and Earth into Origin Dao.

For example, Jian Wushuang meditated World Origin and Slaughter Origin at the very beginning, and then they evolved into World Dao and Slaughter Dao.

The second kind was Sword Principle, Saber Principle, Spear Principle and other kinds of Weapon Dao.

This kind of Dao was a self-understandong of magic weapon. The improvement of Sword Heart and the elegance of swordsmanship also belonged to Sword Principle.

The two kinds of Dao both belonged to Eternal Realm, which were not accessible to Divine Realm experts.

Howeverm, there was the third type of Dao, which was quite unique.

As for the third Dao, it was not necessary to tell different types. People had to explore and create it by thier own. People could make their own Dao.

The reason why Dao Master in the Eternal World was called Dao Master was that they had developed and mastered their own Dao.

The reason why Dao Master in the Eternal World was called Dao Master was that they had developed and mastered their own Dao.

If you wanted to achieve at Dao Master, you had to try to develop your own Dao. No matter what level you achieved at, you would acquire the ability of Dao Master if you created it.

When Jian Wushuang battled with Tian Quan, he had perceived an independent Dao existing in the movement of the longspear Tian Quan performed.

Apparently, Tian Quan had opened up his own Dao.

“He’d opened up his own Dao with so many skills himself. No wonder he could pass through Level One of Black Tower. And he even cultivated one of the nine strongest Secret Skills on Star Island, which helped him improve significantly his strength.” With half closing his eyes, Jian Wushuang was lost in thought.

Phew! Phew! Phew! The Flowing Lights shot out from Jian Wushuang’s Interspatial Ring one after another.

Under Jian Wushuang’s control, the 36 Blood-sky Swords converged in a second.

Jian Wushuang had a deeper understanding of Ninth-heaven Sword Formation from two years ago. More importantly, his Sword Heart had achieved Level Five. The power of his Sword Heart skyrocketed, driving Ninth-heaven Sword Formation to largely rise in both speed and power.

“Go!”

As Jian Wushuang pointed remotely, the scarlet longsword combined by the 36 Blood-sky Swords was like a haze of sun, shooting up violently.

It was so fast that experts around could hardly see clearly the Shadow of the scarlet longsword.

Then, the scarlet longsword had appeared right before Tian Quan.

“Too fast!”

Tian Quan appeared to be shocked by the speed of Ninth-heaven Sword Formation. But with his strength, it was not that fast before he could react. When Ninth-heaven Sword Formation swept fiercely toward his Head,he directly stabbed it with the black longspear on his hand.

Two ghastly blasts of power collided in the Void.
