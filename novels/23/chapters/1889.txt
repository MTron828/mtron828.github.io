Chapter 1890: Give Way

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold.

In the end, the entire vast void was like it was frozen.

Sir God Bei Han suddenly grew awkward, “Sword Emperor, I was just suggesting a method satisfactory for both parties. You should also put yourself in my shoes. After all, we do not wish to put in so much effort and get nothing in return.”

“Humph, everything in this world has risk. You want to receive the Secret Skill of Star Palace from Lineage of Star but you do not want to take any risk? If I were to let you inherit the Secret Skill of Star Palace now, when the war exploded, regardless of the situation of Lineage of Star, it wouldn’t be related to you. Would you fight the war for Lineage of Star wholeheartedly?”

“Sir God Bei Han, don’t treat the others like idiots. I believe that if anyone here was me, none of you would be willing to give the promised benefits to the other party before the war began. Am I right?” Jian Wushuang looked around.

The surrounding Almighties exchanged a look. Although most of them wanted to receive the inheritance of Secret Skill of Star Palace then, they knew that what Jian Wushuang said made sense.

There was no free lunch in this world.

You have to put in effort before you get rewarded. That’s a definite.

One had yet to put in effort but wanted to receive a reward. It was really ridiculous.

“Sword Emperor.”

There was a figure that stood up. It was Emperor God Jiu Yin who had been invited by Jian Wushuang personally and also the first who had opted to join Lineage of Star’s campsite. Emperor God Jiu Yin smiled, “Everyone, maybe you don’t know, but I am a killer. I have been a killer for so many years. Although killers are on the dark side, I also know a simple principle. Work first, get paid later!”

“Killing has a huge risk. If I were to be reckless, I would lose my life. However, there are still many killers that are constantly taking a mission for a targeted reward.

“Comparatively, I find Lineage of Star’s invitation that we accepted not as risky as an ordinary killer mission. After all, when we are at the brink of death, we can leave directly and Lineage of Star won’t stop us. As long as we are careful, our lives are ensured.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“As for what Sir God Bei Han said, to get an inheritance of Secret Skill of Star Palace, and only then fight for Lineage of Star, that’s a joke.”

The moment he said that, the surrounding people nodded in agreement.

Only Sir God Bei Han looked embarrassed.

“Humph. If I do not get the Secret Skill of Star Palace first, I won’t fight for Lineage of Star,” Sir God Bei Han said.

“If so, forgive Lineage of Star for not seeing you off. Go ahead,” Jian Wushuang looked cold.

Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun looked cold too.

Lineage of Star wasn’t like before anymore. Forget about the experts that they invited, with the Dao soldiers alone, it was a terrifying fighting power.

With such fighting power, Sir God Bei Han was nothing. He wanted to leave and Jian Wushuang and his troop wouldn’t stop him.

“Very good. I’d like to see how Lineage Star is going to survive this danger!”

“Humph!”

Sir God Bei Han humphed coldly and left.

Jian Wushuang and no one at the scene stopped him.

After Sir God Bei Han left…

“Everyone, although what Sir God Bei Han said was like a wild fantasy, it also reminded me. It wasn’t a small war after all. If there was any mistake, Lineage of Star would be doomed forever. You might return empty-handed. So, I have changed my mind now,” Jian Wushuang’s voice spread.

The Almighties immediately looked at Jian Wushuang.

Changed his mind?

Was Jian Wushuang agreeing to let them get the inheritance of Secret Skill of Star Palace?

“Everyone, as you are coming for the Secret Skill of Star Palace, you definitely have a certain understanding of Lineage of Star. You should know that there are three volumes in Secret Skill of Star Palace and they contain different level of power.”

“Now, although I can’t let you inherit the Secret Skill of Star Palace ahead of time, I can promise those who put in extra effort during the war for Lineage of Star, we will reward each of you according to merit. In accordance with credit, you may inherit the first volume of Secret Skill of Star Palace first. If you put in a great effort, you may inherit the second volume.”

“Then, even if Lineage of Star were to be destroyed in the end, as long as all of you gave your all, you would stand a chance to receive the Secret Skill of Star Palace during the process so you won’t return empty-handed. What do you think?” Jian Wushuang looked around.

Hearing what Jian Wushuang had said, the Almighties beamed with joy.

Reward according to merit and receive the inheritance of Secret Skill of Star Palace during the process of war.

Compared to the promised hundred thousand years of service to get the inheritance, it was way more secure.

“Sword Emperor, don’t worry. No matter what happens next in Lineage of Star, we will go all out!”

“Yes, all out!”

The Almighties on the spot showed their standing. They looked determined.

If they were to be said to be insecure previously, no one thought so after.

Everyone was convinced and willing to go to war for Lineage of Star.

“Let’s go down and prepare,” Jian Wushuang waved.

The Almighties left one after another.

In the void, there was only Jian Wushuang and the other three Hall Masters left.

“Palace Master, I never expected for you to give way,” Hall Master Yuan looked at Jian Wushuang in shock. “Actually, you don’t have to give way and these people would still fight for Lineage of Star.”

“Even so, they have scruples more or less. They might even be insecure. When it comes to crucial times, these scruples and insecurities will affect the entire situation. Plus, Sir God Bei Han said something right. If these experts were to get the Secret Skill of Star Palace, their fighting powers would become stronger. Hence, I will separate the Secret Skill of Star Palace into three volumes to receive the inheritance.”

“If they were to inherit the first volume, they would definitely figure a way to get the second and third volumes…”

“In actual fact, it is great enough to be able to cultivate the Secret Skill of Star Palace. To cultivate the second volume, it’s too difficult. It is impossible to cultivate the third one. Only we know that and these people don’t know,” Jian Wushaung smiled.

“That’s true,” Hall Master Yuan nodded faintly.

Ever since the Master of Star Palace had received the Secret Skill of Star Palace, only Jian Wushuang and the Master of Star Palace had cultivated the second volume. The others had merely got the first volume cultivated. As for the third volume, there was no one who had cultivated it successfully.
