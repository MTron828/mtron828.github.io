Chapter 592: Blood Bladesman’s Killing Move

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Seeing his opponent showing his move, Blood Bladesman sneered. “You are not worried that your Sword Marquis Mansion will disappear if we fight in there?”

A fight between two powerful experts would cause a great commotion.

They all had the battle strength of the Skyscraping Realm. If they had an all-out fight, the Sword Marquis Mansion would not be strong enough to sustain it. Moreover, the two Saint Realm experts were unable to display their full strength in such a small place like the Sword Marquis Mansion.

However, Jian Wushuang was eager to battle and looked as if he was not worried about it at all.

“You won’t have such an opportunity.” Jian Wushuang’s frosty voice resounded through the area.

The power of his sword shadow fully erupted into action.

Boom! The space was split as his sword shadow appeared in front of Blood Bladesman.

“What?”

Blood Bladesman, who had remained calm and composed, was suddenly shocked by this sword shadow.

He felt its terrifying power and immediately reacted. And the moment a blood-red saber appeared in his hand, he brandished it without hesitation. This attack contained a power that was strong enough to destroy the world.

The cold and dazzling saber light lashed out!

The two strikes smashed into each other.

Bang!

A deep sound of their impact resounded, which shook Blood Bladesman.

“How... how is that possible?”

Blood Bladesman looked at his hands, which were bleeding. The sharp pain rendered him unable to hold his blood-red saber.

Had his saber been knocked away from just one attack?

Their initial confrontation produced inconceivable power waves that were strong enough to ruin the entire Sword Marquis Mansion. However, Jian Wushuang radiated a blast of terrifying aura to cover up the power waves.

Boom... The power waves erupted, but no spectator got hurt as Jian Wushuang’s aura had sustained it.

“It’s impossible!”

Blood Bladesman was dumbfounded and could not believe it.

How powerful this young man was!

Even the Sword Ancestor at his peak might have been inferior to him.

It was amazing that Jian Wushuang could have made such rapid progress in such a short period of time.

It had been less than a year since he was forced to leave the Divine Land.

But now, he had gotten stronger than the Sword Ancestor?

“Go to hell!”

Jian Wushuang ignored his opponent’s shock and attacked him again.

Blood Bladesman went pale, a sense of crisis rising in his heart.

“You want me to die? You go first!” Blood Bladesman suddenly roared as he waved his hand.

A blood shadow flew across the Void.

Jian Wushuang recognized it the moment it dashed out. It was a sharp scarlet dagger and was quickly approaching.

It moved so fast that it would be difficult for Jian Wushuang to avoid this attack.

Nevertheless, he did not intend to dodge it.

Upon seeing this, Blood Bladesman showed a frosty smile.

“Die!” Blood Bladesman cried, his face twisting with ferocity.

He was famous for the Blood Saber.

Many people thought his Blood Saber was the blood-red saber that he used. Actually, he was called “Blood Bladesman” because of this moving scarlet dagger.

That dagger was his real Killing Move. He had used it to kill many powerful opponents since he started his cultivation.

He had saved the day many times by using it, so he thought it would also help him this time.

This scarlet dagger with terrifying power crashed into Jian Wushuang. It pricked his clothes and landed on his chest, leaving just a light white mark there.

The smile on Blood Bladesman’s face froze at once.

“My scarlet dagger has only left a white mark on the young man’s chest?

“It didn’t prick his skin?”

“This, this...” Blood Bladesman was petrified.

At this point, the cold sword shadow that Jian Wushuang displayed charged smoothly and pierced Blood Bladesman’s body. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

This Skyscraping Realm expert, who had a good reputation in the Ancient World, died.

Jian Wushuang stood on the ground as he touched that white mark on his chest, with a hint of scorn flashing through his eyes.

Blood Bladesman’s powerful Killing Move was able to kill Skyscraping Realm experts who came from the Divine Land or other plane worlds and did not have powerful bodies.

However, under the attack of his Killing Move, Skyscraping Realm experts in the Monster Continent—like the 33 Temple Masters from the Monster-exterminating League—could be seriously injured, but even the weakest would not die.

Human Warriors from the Monster Continent were more powerful than Warriors from the other plane worlds.

Jian Wushuang had a terrifying body, so he was not hurt by Blood Bladesman’s Killing Move.

He walked toward Blood Bladesman and waved his hand to take the Interspatial Ring, blood-red saber, and scarlet dagger. Then, he said while looking downward, “Blood Bladesman, don’t worry. You are just the first one!

“It won’t take long for someone to accompany you!

“Those Skyscraping Realm experts who had attacked the Sword Ancestor and forced me to flee from the Divine Land, I’ll kill them all!

“And Su Ming, I won’t forget him. I’ll get my revenge on all of them, one by one!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and his eyes were filled with killing intent.

Numerous clansmen were staring at Jian Wushuang in admiration.

This legend in their eyes had appeared at a critical moment and killed all the enemies with his heaven-defying strength.

He had not disappointed them indeed.

At this point, Jian Wushuang turned to look at his clansmen. The first one that he saw was Jian Meng’er.

He calmly looked at Jian Meng’er, who wore a complicated expression on her face.

Then he waved his hand and threw an elixir to her.
