Chapter 1639: Transformation Phase, Deep Sleep!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Even though I am only a Stage One Ultimate Real God, my Divine Power is equivalent to that of a Chaotic Real God. This is really impressive.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Jian Wushuang gasped in admiration. At the same time, he was also feeling the power of the golden water droplet within his body thoroughly.

“According to the Method of the Sixth Step of Cultivation Strength, when the first Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet is formed, I will only be an Early Stage Stage One Ultimate Real God. In the future, the second and third Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplets will form as well. With that, the Ultimate Divine Power that I can control will increase even more and become even more majestic. Moreover, when the tenth Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet is formed, I will be able to make a breakthrough to become a Stage Two Ultimate Real God.”

“After that… I will continue to form Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplets until a hundred of them are formed. With that, the Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplets will fuse together and form an Ultimate Divine Power Pearl, and I will undergo a complete change to become a Stage Three Ultimate Real God. At that time, my Divine Power will be comparable to a top Almighty’s, like the Star Palace Master’s!”

Jian Wushuang clenched both his fists tightly and he was extremely delighted.

At the same time, he was gasping in admiration. It was no wonder that many top experts in the Eternal Chaotic World would be so afraid of Inverse Cultivators.

It was really because Inverse Cultivators were too frightening, especially those Inverse Cultivators who had cleared the Inverse Cultivation Test for the Third Heaven as they had unlimited possibilities!

Take Real God Wu Bei as an example. In actual fact, his level of comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way was not considered very high and it could not be compared to that of a normal Almighty. However, he had achieved Stage Three Ultimate Real God. With that, his Divine Power was many times stronger than a normal Almighty’s. Even though his comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way was slightly weaker, he would still be able to compete on equal footing with a normal Almighty. Moreover, he would even be able to push back Almighties with slightly weaker abilities.

Furthermore, as soon as his level of comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way became higher, he would definitely be able to reach a level similar to the Star Palace Master.

If a mere Sixth Step Real God were already so strong, what about the Seventh Step?

It was really unimaginable. If an Inverse Cultivator were to enter the Seventh Step, what level would he be at? From what Jian Wushuang thought, an Inverse Cultivator who had entered the Seventh Step would be at the Emperor level, even if he had only just entered it.

“It’s not only my Divine Power; my body is the same as well,” Jian Wushuang giggled.

After becoming an Ultimate Real God, Jian Wushuang realized an exciting thing. One of the Four Secret Skills of the Lineage of Star, Xuan Mie Golden Body, that he had put in quite a bit of effort to cultivate, had become utterly useless to him.

It was indeed useless to him.

After all, there were only three volumes of Xuan Mie Golden Body. By cultivating it to its peak, it could only allow his body to achieve the level of a Chaotic Real God.

However, at that very moment, he had made a breakthrough and become an Ultimate Real God. Hence, his body had naturally achieved the level of a Chaotic Real God as well.

“My Ancient God Power has also made a breakthrough.” With a thought, a significant amount of Ancient God Power appeared in Jian Wushuang’s body immediately. Moreover, all the Ancient God Power gathered at the space between his eyebrows and this caused patterns of Quadrangular Star to appear in the space between his eyebrows.

Initially, there were five stars. However, at that very moment, the sixth Quadrangular Star had appeared.

Six-star Ancient God!

Jian Wushuang had only just become an Ultimate Real God and he was at Stage One. However, if his Ancient Power and Divine Power combined and he was to unleash the Ancient God Unique Skills and Secret Skills, their power would definitely achieve a level that was never seen before.

In short, with the breakthrough, his abilities had definitely risen many times when they were compared to the past.

Jian Wushuang had absolute confidence to face a Chaotic Real God. Moreover, if his level of comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way were higher, he would be even more frightening.

“Puff!”

After exhaling, Jian Wushuang, who was over the moon, regained his composure.

“Oh, right. King of Venomous Worms, since I have already made a breakthrough to become a Six-star Ancient God, you should have made a breakthrough along with me, right?” I remembered you telling me that there was a vast threshold between a Five-star Ancient God and Six-star Ancient God. As soon as I make a breakthrough, you will also undergo a significant change and might even awaken many fighting abilities. Am I right?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

However, when his words left his mouth, he did not get an answer from the King of Venomous Worms, even after a long time.

“King of Venomous Worms?”Read more chapter on vi pnovel

Jian Wushuang frowned and he shouted for the King of Venomous Worms in his mind this time around.

“Stop shouting.”

Finally, the King of Venomous Worms’ voice could be heard and his voice was obviously a lot deeper, “Jian Wushuang, let me first congratulate you for finally making a breakthrough to become a Real God. However, at the same time, I must tell you something. My Plenilune Clan grows in accordance to the Ancient Gods that we live in. Since you have made a breakthrough to become a Six-star Ancient God, I have also been affected greatly. Now, I am in the transformation phase. However, this transformation phase requires a period of time before it is complete. During this period of time, I will be in a deep sleep. Hence, I will be unable to talk to you and also unable to help you recover your Divine Power.”

“Transformation phase? Deep sleep?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“The transformation phase has already begun and I am about to enter a deep sleep. To make a long story short, for a while, I will be unable to help you and you will have to rely on yourself for everything. Please be extremely careful and don’t die before I wake up from my transformation,” the King of Venomous Worms warned.

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head, “How long will your transformation phase take?”

“Under normal circumstances, as a Plenilune Centipede, my transformation phase should take tens of thousands of years. When I lived in King Luo Zhen’s body back then, my transformation phase took a total of thirteen thousand years. However, now is my second time entering the transformation phase so it should not take as long as before. However, I am not sure about the exact duration either. In short, you must be careful in everything you do.”

“That’s it…”

As soon as its words left his mouth, the King of Venomous Worms’ aura disappeared and he had gone into a deep sleep.

“At this stage, the King of Venomous Worms actually went into a deep sleep. This is going to be a bit troublesome,” Jian Wushuang frowned.

It was indeed troublesome. He had just made a breakthrough to become a Stage One Ultimate Real God and only one Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet was formed. Although his Divine Power was reliable, the amount of Divine Power he possessed was not a lot. As soon as he fought and unleashed his moves wantonly, he would exhaust his Divine Power quickly. Thus, he would not be able to last long.

Initially, there was still the King of Venomous Worms in his body helping him to recover and that would allow him to be more relaxed. However, at that very moment, the King of Venomous Worms had gone into a deep sleep. Thus, his only Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet was really insufficient for him.

“Looks like if I were to fight in the future, I would have to try my best to conserve my Divine Power,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

He then got up slowly.

The moment?he got up, he could faintly hear all the bones in his body giving out crackling sounds and his body felt refreshed.

After stretching himself, Jian Wushuang finally walked out of the secret room.

Within the Ancient God Palace, Jian Wushuang was walking toward the front slowly.

At that moment, he passed by a lofty palace.

All of a sudden, Jian Wushuang raised his head and he saw a figure in front of him who was walking over. His face then wore a smile, “Brother Jinyu.”

Gu Jinyu was a Stage Two Six-star Ancient God within the Ancient God Palace.

“Gu Jian?”

Gu Jinyu also saw Jian Wushuang. He went closer.

“Eh?” Gu Jinyu’s eyes shrank, “This god power… what a strong god power!”
