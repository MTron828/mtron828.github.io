Chapter 1635: One Faceoff

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Haha. King Gu Tong’s lineage, which once stood at the peak of the Gu King City, has fallen completely? The expert that it sent out is trash like this?”

A wanton and loud laughter reverberated across the universe. The Six-star Gold-armored Ancient God who defeated Gu Heng was floating in the sky and the unreasonable amount of aura on his body was oppressing everyone.

“Damn it!”

Many clansmen under King Gu Tong’s lineage were extremely furious. However, they were unable to do anything.

Apart from King Gu Tong, Gu Heng was the strongest person within their lineage. However, it was obvious that he was not an opponent for the Six-star Gold-armored Ancient God that was in front of them.

Since their abilities were inferior to the Six-Star Ancient God, no matter how arrogant he was, they would be unable to do anything.

However, at that very moment, Jian Wushuang, who was within the crowd, stepped out abruptly.

“Leave this person to me,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Jian Wushuang?” Before Elder Yi, Elder Ying and the rest of the people could react, Jian Wushuang had already stepped forward.

Jian Wushuang went in front of that Six-star Gold-armored Ancient God directly.

“Let me be your opponent,” Jian Wushuang said.

“You?” the Six-Star Gold-armored Ancient God shot a glance at Jian Wushuang and he sneered straight away, “Haha. Looks like King Gu Tong’s lineage has really fallen. The person who have sent just now is still a Six-star Ancient God. But now, they have actually sent a Five-star Ancient God. This is really funny. King Gu Tong’s face has really been totally thrown away by all these people under him.”

After hearing what was said, many Ancient Gods of King Gu Tong’s lineage clenched their fists tightly and they were enraged.

Jian Wushuang had an indifferent expression as he had never fought for himself. However, dark golden light appeared from his body and he became a hundred foot tall lofty Ancient God instantly.

Powerful aura was released from Jian Wushuang’s body. At the same time, the pressure from his Bloodline was also released.

The eyes of the Six-star Gold-armored Ancient God, who was originally extremely arrogant, shrank fiercely when he saw Jian Wushuang’s Ancient God body.

“A Royal Ancient God!”

Many Ancient Gods of King Gu Tong’s lineage revealed a shocked expression in succession.

In the whole Gu King City and even the whole Ancient God Sanctuary, there were not many people who possessed the Royal Ancient God Bloodline.

Jian Wushuang did not say anything unnecessary. The Blood Mountain Sword had already appeared in his hands and his powerful sword essence shot up to the highest heavens.

At the next moment, Jian Wushuang moved.

Bam! Bam!

The big feet of the Ancient God’s body that Jian Wushuang had transformed into were stomping into the ground madly. His body was like a huge mountain that was charging and his speed was extremely fast.

As he charged forward, the aura and the pressure from his Bloodline became stronger and heavier respectively.

The eyes of the Six-star Gold-armored Ancient God were filled with malice, “Hmph, so what if you’re a Royal Ancient God? In the end, you are only a Five-star. Since you wish to bring shame on yourself, I shall grant you your wish!”

Boom!

The Six-star Gold-armored Ancient God’s movement tore open the void. His hands were holding a golden big hammer tightly and it had already started to gather a vast amount of power.

However, just as the both of them were about to clash head-on, the Six-star Gold-armored Ancient God was about to swing the big hammer in his hands.

Buzz!

Jian Wushuang’s body flashed strangely and he disappeared from the front of the Six-star Gold-armored Ancient God straight away.

“What?” the Six-star Gold-armored Ancient God became shocked at once.

Straight away after that, an ear-piercing explosive sound could be heard from behind him. When he turned his head fiercely, he saw a brilliant, dazzling sword light.

“This speed… how can he be so fast?” the Six-star Gold-armored Ancient God opened his eyes wide and he was unable to react at all.

Piak!

The sword light dissipated and the sword blade of Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword struck the huge body of the Six-star Gold-armored Ancient God. His powerful strength had caused the Six-star Gold-armored Ancient God’s body to shake and he retreated backwards while staggering. In the end, he fell to the ground. However, he stood up again in an instant and his eyes, which were looking at Jian Wushuang, filled with anger.

“If I had used the edge of my sword just now, your head would already be gone,” Jian Wushuang’s cold voice resounded across the universe.

The Six-star Gold-armored Ancient God’s body trembled. Even though he was extremely furious, he could only suppress his anger and not let it show.

He knew that Jian Wushuang was right. If Jian Wushuang had used the sword edge instead of the sword blade just then, he would already be dead.

“Is he really only a Five-star Ancient God?” the Six-star Gold-armored Ancient God felt that it was unbelievable.

He was a Stage Two Six-star Ancient God. However, he was defeated after one faceoff. Moreover, he would already be dead if his opponent had not shown him mercy.

This was something that a Five-star Ancient God could do?

When the Ancient Gods of King Gu Tong’s lineage who were standing by the side of the battlefield saw such a scene, they became stupefied as well.

“Jian Wushuang, he, he…” Gu Heng opened his eyes big and his face was filled with disbelief.

“He defeated a Stage Two Six-star Ancient God in just one faceoff?” Elder Ying and Gu Yang were both extremely shocked.

The Jian Wushuang who they knew was a genius. However, he was far from being so frightening.

“As expected of the top expert to have cleared the sixth level of the Star Moon Tower,” Elder Yi clenched both his fists tightly.

Amidst a void, far away from the battlefield, there were a few shadows. These people were experts from the Asura Tribe. In particular, the person at the front was the leader of the Asura Tribe, Gu Luo.

They had been staying in the void and they were keeping track of everything that was happening on the battlefield.

At the start, when the Six-star Gold-armored Ancient God of their tribe had defeated Gu Heng easily, they had laughed as they were pleased and not surprised in the slightest. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

However, at that very moment, the experts of the Asura Tribe were so shocked that they were stunned.

“How is that possible? That little kid is only a Five-star Ancient God!”

“With the Power of Five-star Ancient God, he defeated a Stage Two Six-star Ancient God instantly. Moreover, he also possessed the Royal Bloodline. This person… Could he be the exceptional genius whose name shook the Gu King City after clearing the sixth level of the Star Moon Tower not long ago?”

“The first in history?”

The experts understood quickly.

“If it’s really him, then that explains it,” the leader of the Asura Tribe squinted his eyes and he took a look at Jian Wushuang, who was far away. After that, his body moved and he headed toward the battlefield in front of him. As for the people behind him, they naturally followed him closely.

In a jiffy, Gu Luo and his people appeared on the battlefield.

“Leader, I am incompetent,” the Six-star Golden-armored Ancient God who was defeated in the hands of Jian Wushuang apologized to Gu Luo right away.

“This matter is not your fault,” Gu Luo waved his hands and his eyes already looked toward Jian Wushuang, “Royal Ancient God Bloodline. Although you are merely a Five-star Ancient God, you have such strong fighting capabilities. If my guess is not wrong, you should be the genius Gu Jian, who cleared the sixth level of the Star Moon Tower, right?”

“That’s me,” Jian Wushuang admitted openly.
