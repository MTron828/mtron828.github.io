Chapter 2477: A Competition of Speed

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“You should not have declined,” said Fan Jianxian coldly.

“Don’t tell me, you really think you’re qualified to be my teacher?” scoffed Jian Wushuang.

In Saint’s Tomb, Crimson Stone Saint wanted to take him as his personal disciple so much that he even offered to give him extremely attractive benefits, but Jian Wushuang was not interested at all.

Who did Fan Jianxian think he was?

“That’s also true. However, since you’re not my disciple, you’ll have to die today!” Fan Jianxian still sounded cold.

Just as his voice faded, Fan Jianxian’s pale hand had reached for the green sword behind his back.

Schwang!

As the long sword was unsheathed, a bolt of stunning sword essence shot through the void as though a gigantic dragon had woken up.

Fan Jianxian single-handedly swung the green sword and swept sideways.

Whoosh!

A piercing green sword-light furiously sliced towards Jian Wushuang.

Air was being split open wherever it swung by and suffocated those surrounding experts with its terrifying power.

Jian Wushuang remained at the same spot and watched as the green sword came at him. However, he had no intention of dodging, but to fend off with his own sword.

It was not until when the green sword-light arrived three meters before him that Jian Wushuang suddenly took action.

His right hand formed a claw grip as a mixture of surging divine powers and sword essences gathering in his palm.

In the blink of an eye, his hand had already held onto the incoming sword-light and squeezed it really hard.

The green sword-light which almost made all those surrounding experts suffocate had exploded under Jian Wushuang’s squeeze.

Countless green sword-lights were dispersed in every direction.

“An attack at this level is quite insufficient to kill me.” Wu Jianshuang continued to stand there with a smile.

However, those Divine Demons around were already stunned beyond words.

They were already incredibly shocked when Jian Wushuang grabbed Tu Qiancheng’s sword-light.

However, the person who just issued that attack was a legitimate Ultimate God expert. Even though the Ultimate God had not unleashed his full power, that casually released sword-light which was already incredibly powerful was neutralized by a bare-handed Jian Wushuang and squeezed till it exploded.

That ability...

“As expected, you’re already equipped with an Ultimate God’s battle strength. Moreover, your body is also extraordinarily strong.”

Fan Jianxian’s face was cold and expressionless, even though Jian Wushuang had squeezed his sword-light.

After all, that sword strike was only casually issued just to test out Jian Wushuang’s true abilities.

The test results were clear.

“Regardless, whether your battle strength is merely comparable to Ultimate God. Even if you really are an Ultimate God expert, you are still going to die because you killed my personal disciple!”

Fan Jianxian’s eyes shot out a cold light.

With a huge noise, his sword essence shot up into the sky.

Fan Jianxian’s figure was moving mysteriously under the infinite sword essences.

Similar to teleportation, Fan Jianxian’s figure appeared in front of Jian Wushuang as he thrust out his green-colored long sword.

The strike silently instantly stabbed through Jian Wushuang’s body and exited from the other side.

“So fast!”

Those many experts around were shocked by watching the battle.

“Did Jian Wushuang die?”

“No, that can’t be!”

Those Divine Demons’ faces changed.

Fan Jianxian’s pupil slightly shrunk as well because the Jian Wushuang that he stabbed had gradually disappeared.

“Space-time shadow?”

No, a Space-time shadow wouldn’t be able to escape my soul power’s scrutiny. That was not a shadow, it’s a Space-time apparition...” A piercing light flashed in Fan Jianxian’s eyes.

Space-time apparitions were something that could only be formed by possessing an extremely high understanding of the Space-time Law and reaching the first stage.

What Jian Wushuang just formed was a Space-time apparition, something completely different from the Space-time shadow he had formed a while ago.

“This kid has reached such a high level of understanding towards Space-time Law?” Fan Jianxian also felt incredibly shocked.

The difficulty of understanding laws only got harder with each increasing stage.

In normal circumstances, the first stage of law understanding was something very difficult to achieve, even for a regular Ultimate God.

For example, Fan Jianxian was still a far cry from reaching the first stage of law understanding.

However, Jian Wushuang had obviously achieved the first stage of Space-time Law since he could so easily form an apparition. He might even be quite skillful in that stage.

Jian Wushuang was on a higher level than him when it came to the understanding of laws.

Ring!

A soft ring sliced through the air.

The ring was very soft and might even be unnoticeable to First-Class and Peak Divine Demons. However, Fan Jianxian had super sharp senses.

As the ringing started, he did a backhand with his sword, leaving a strange slash trace in the void before suddenly retracting the tip of his sword from the void.

Previously, there was nothing in that part of the void, but when the sword tip retracted, a cold crimson-colored long sword appeared, and along with it was Jian Wushuang’s figure.

Clank!

Jian Wushuang’s figure vanished once again.

“Oh, competing in speed? Hmph, do you think I would be worried?” Fan Jianxian’s eyes projected a coldness as his figure shook and vanished.

In the middle of the battlefield, both Jian Wushuang and Fan Jianxian exploded with great speeds.

Two ghastly figures flashing repeatedly in the void. Every time the surrounding speculators saw their figures flashed, they had already appeared in another part of the void. They would appear a thousand meters above in one moment and on the ground by the next while causing explosions with every clash.

Those two figures mysteriously intertwined.

Nobody could catch where the figures would appear next as they could only see violent flashes of sword-lights sweeping willfully. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

On the glade, those sects’ experts and their disciples were stunned to the core.

“Goodness!”

“This is what true speed looks like! We Divine Demons are very fast as well, but it’s incomparable to this!”

“Be grateful! Be grateful that we didn’t continue attacking Jian Wushuang, or else he would’ve slaughtered all of us as easy as lifting a finger just by relying on his terrifying speed.”

“Ultimate God. This is an Ultimate God!”

Countless experts exclaimed in awe.

Those disciples from various sects all showed fanatical and excited expressions.

It was the first time for most of them to witness a battle on the Ultimate God-level. The most unbelievable part was that one of those Ultimate Gods was a disciple just like them, visiting Saint’s Tomb to look for opportunities.

However, this person had gained the ability to challenge an Ultimate God in the blink of an eye.

Just from the situation alone, both of them were more or less equal in the fight.

At least, Jian Wushuang and Fan Jianxian were on similar levels judging from their speed.
