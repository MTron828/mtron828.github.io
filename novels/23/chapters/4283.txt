4288 Jian Wushuang Comes Out of Seclusion!

God Refining Tower, ninth level.

The originally dense and surging origin source law aura had almost completely dissipated.

All that was left was a black-robed, black-haired statue that seemed to have existed since ancient times. It sat cross-legged in the void, and waves of extremely powerful aura spread out from it, sweeping in all directions and squeezing the entire chaotic space of the ninth floor.

“After 5000 years, I’ve finally reached the initial stage of the ‘Eternal Night’ sword technique.” A deep voice came from the black-robed, black-haired sculpture.

!!

In the next moment, the statue suddenly opened its eyes!

An earth-shattering and extremely sharp divine light flashed through the eyes of the statue!

He was Jian Wushuang!

In the close to 10000 years that he had spent in the God Refining Tower, not only had he broken through to the realm of an Ultimate Ruler and grasped the second move of the zenith sword canon, Daybreak, he had even deduced the ‘Eternal Night’ sword move to the small success realm!

The current him, one sword could be a world!

The sword fell, and Eternal Night descended!

And this was far from his greatest improvement.

“The Tarot divine sword…”

Jian Wushuang lowered his head and saw a dark golden sword full of mysterious runes floating in front of his knees. There was a closed vertical eye on the hilt of the sword.

Then, he opened his palm, and his five well-defined fingers grabbed the hilt of the Tarot divine sword!

In an instant, Jian Wushuang felt as if his heart and blood were connected.

Puchi!

The eye on the hilt of the Tarot divine sword suddenly opened!

An extremely evil aura was emitted from the vertical eye!

The vertical eye was covered in cobweb-like blood vessels. The black eyeball was spinning, and it was filled with a sinister feeling.

“Even though I can only use a trace of the Tarot divine sword’s true power, it’s enough.” Jian Wushuang smiled and a look of satisfaction flashed in his eyes.

The Tarot divine sword was the peerless divine weapon that Tarot Supreme had used to dominate the universe. In terms of grade, it was far beyond the level of a law Supreme treasure. It had reached a level that Jian Wushuang could not understand.

Even if he could only use a trace of its power, it would surpass all of Jian Wushuang’s current sword principle super powers. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jian Wushuang flipped his hand and put the Tarot divine sword back into the sandalwood sword case on his back. Then, he slowly stood up.

Ka-chak.

His divine body made crackling sounds like beans being fried.

“Qiu Long, don’t let me down.”

Jian Wushuang muttered to himself in a cold voice.

…

Outside the God Refining Tower.

Just as the Overlord arrived and was about to step into the God Refining Tower.

“Whoosh!”

Two rays of light pierced through the heaven and earth from the distance. They were a step ahead of him and landed at the entrance of the God Refining Tower.

As the light gradually dissipated, the First Prince stood in front of the God Refining Tower with his hands behind his back. The corners of his lips curled up in a mocking smile as he said, “The great Overlord has actually fallen to the point where he needs to escape into the God Refining Tower to save his life?”

The Overlord’s expression changed as he turned around to look.

Scarlet Sun Demon Master was expressionless, and he blocked his way with a long black saber in his hand.

Seeing this, the Overlord’s heart sank, and his face turned ugly.

In the Tenth City, the many Ultimate Rulers saw this and could not help but sigh.

“Fate makes fools of people, and heroes meet their end.”

A powerful being at the level of a big shot has actually fallen to the point of being hunted down.

“It seems like we can’t stay on the Ancient Path of Stars any longer.”

They naturally knew about the changes that happened in the last eight cities. Qiu Long had killed those who disobeyed him, which was true to the saying, ‘those who follow me live, and those who resist me die’.

In the last eight cities, apart from those who had submitted to Qiu Long, the other Ultimate Rulers had basically been killed.

Fortunately, they were weak and Qiu Long did not care about them, so no one came to find trouble with them. He did not know if he should be glad or smile bitterly…

“Let’s hurry up and leave. When the big shots fight, I’m afraid we’ll be caught in the crossfire.”

After sighing, these Ultimate Rulers all soared into the sky, planning to leave.

When the First Prince and the others saw this, they did not care. They were just a bunch of small fries, and they did not care to deal with them.

“Overlord, just surrender.” The First Prince’s gaze turned and finally locked onto the Overlord.

A majestic aura rose with him as the center, and the terrifying pressure directly crushed all the houses within a ten-mile radius!

Behind the great Overlord, the Scarlet Sun Demon Master twisted his neck and released his own pressure, as if an ancient demonic god had descended.

The Overlord took a deep breath and knew that there was no way to end this peacefully. Fortunately, he had a fierce and ambitious personality. A look of determination flashed in his eyes as he said in a deep voice, “Then come!”

“Alright, I’ll fulfill your wish.”

The First Prince licked the corner of his lips, a sickly cruelty on his face.

Just as he and the Scarlet Sun Demon Master were about to attack and kill the great Overlord with one strike…

All of a sudden!

...

“Rumble!!”

As if the sky was falling and the earth was cracking, the entire Tenth City, a region of nearly 100000 miles, started to tremble!

At this moment!

The ground cracked and the sky changed colors. Gusts of wind howled, and the entire Tenth City seemed to have fallen into a raging sea!

An extremely powerful pressure descended with a bang, threatening all directions!

in front of this pressure, the First Prince’s and Scarlet Sun Demon Master’s pressure was like a stream in a mountain facing an ocean. They were so insignificant that they were on completely different levels!

In just a breath, he was crushed!

“What’s going on?”

The First Prince and the Scarlet Sun Demon Master exclaimed in shock.

Even the Overlord was shocked. He, who had the immortal Overlord body, felt like a little chick shivering in front of this destructive pressure.

Only at the fortress where ‘Lord Blue’ of the Tenth City was located, she, who had been resting with her eyes closed, opened them. a smile appeared on her face as she said softly, “He’s finally out.”

...

Bang!

At this moment, the God Refining Tower’s bronze door that had been sealed for close to ten thousand years suddenly shattered!

Countless dragon-like sword Qi shot out from it!

“Who’s causing trouble?”

The First Prince and the Scarlet Sun Demon Master roared as they used their divine power to block the sword Qi!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

However, when the dragon-like sword Qi hit them, they were sent flying hundreds of meters away, leaving countless deep sword marks on the ground.

The First Prince and Scarlet Sun Demon Master were both shocked and furious as they glared at the God Refining Tower.

Da da da da.

Da da da da.

A heavy sound of footsteps came from the God Refining Tower.

Following that, they saw a cold-looking young man dressed in black with his jet-black hair hanging down loosely. He was carrying a sword case on his back as he walked out from the darkness of the God Refining Tower.

“Who is he?”

When the grave-looking young man walked out of the darkness of the God Refining Tower, the First Prince and Scarlet Sun Demon Master trembled in disbelief.

Even the Overlord was dumbfounded. It was as if he had been struck by lightning.

“Jian Wushuang!”
