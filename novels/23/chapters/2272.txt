Chapter 2273 Saint Soul, Elder Shehua

Not only was he so strong, but he had the Body of Undying as well?They had all done their best to destroy Jian Wushuang’s holy body.

For that, many of them had paid heavy prices to demonstrate those moves.

They had barely managed to do it once, much less a second time.

But Jian Wushuang’s Body of Undying could reform a countless amount of times.

They could never kill Jian Wushuang.

“Invincible! Invincible!”

The Ancient Era experts were howling.

Indeed, Jian Wushuang was invincible in their eyes.

There was nothing the Ancient Era experts could do to him.

Suddenly... Boom!

The earth shook suddenly as a faint light emerged from the dark and foggy Heaven’s Horizon.

The faint light grew brighter.

Indistinctly, a familiar aura emerged from the other end of the light.

“The... aura of the Absolute Beginning Divine World!” the Ancient Era experts all sensed it and immediately went fanatical over it.

“It has begun!”

“The few Masters have created a gap for the link passage!”

“At this rate, it won’t take long for the entire link passage to emerge!””

The Ancient Era experts were all extremely excited.

Bing Shan’s eyes turned cold and he howled, “The link passage will open soon, but no one is to enter before Lord Leng.”

“The only way to enter the link passage is to block the Sword Emperor with your life. After Lord Leng enters, do as you please.”

The Ancient Era experts went into a frenzy upon hearing it.

Countless bloodshot eyes were staring at Jian Wushuang.

Undoubtedly, Jian Wushuang was impossible to kill.

But all they needed to do now was to block Jian Wushuang.

They could definitely do that.

“Let’s go!”

“We need to trap him, don’t give him a chance to escape!”

“We need to let Lord Leng go first.”

The Ancient Era experts said it again.

But this time, they had no intention of killing Jian Wushuang, they simply needed to trap him.

Ancient Era experts had various killing tactics and even more ways to entrap people.

The sheer number of Ancient Era experts flooded Jian Wushuang beyond comprehension. It would be unrealistic for Jian Wushuang to be able to breakthrough.

Leng Ruxue and Bing Shan stood side by side as they watched the light grow brighter from within the grey mist. A link passage gradually appeared, but it was still narrow and unstable.

As long as the link passage stabilised, they could step through directly.

But at that moment, One-Star Man and the others in the Void made their move.

“Guys, it’s our turn!” One-Star Man looked around with dazzling eyes.

“Haha, finally!”

“It’s been so long since I stretched my bones.”

“Let’s go!”

Ten-odd streaks of flowing light flew in from the Void and directly into the battlefield.

“Haha, Three Big Holy Lands, Four Big Holy Tribes, Eight Big Holy Sects rascals, come meet the Saint Soul!”

A burst of hearty laughter was made by a thin old man in a black robe. His eyes were eerily grey, and a grey fire seemed to burn from within, making him look extremely devious.

As the laughter echoed, a horrifying Soul Power billowed through the surrounding Ancient Era experts.

Under that power, many weak Chaotic Divine Demons lost consciousness and fainted upon contact.

Only stronger Chaotic Divine Demons and beyond could resist it.

“What a strong Soul Attack, stronger than Sword Emperor’s,” the Ancient Era experts that had managed to stay awake were shocked.

Jian Wushuang’s Soul Attack was strong.

But its power could only be felt when concentrated into one-to-one attacks against Chaotic Divine Demons.

If he were to spread that Soul Power around, it would do minimal damage to surrounding Ancient Era experts.

But now, the skinny old man did as such, and half of the Chaotic Divine Demons fainted.

How strong was that Soul Attack?

“It’s Saint Soul!”

“It’s him!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“The old man’s not dead!”

The Ancient Era experts were angered upon hearing that name.

Saint Soul was one of the strongest experts in the Seven Star Black Sect, Ancient Era.

He had been named a Saint for his Undying Saint abilities and received the title Soul for his mastery in Soul Power.

Even back at the Absolute Beginning Divine World, very few Undying Saints could have surpassed him in terms of Soul Power.

Thankfully, due to the restrictions, his Soul Power could only be maintained at Chaotic Realm levels, unable to display its full power.

Without the restrictions, he would have killed thousands of Chaotic Divine Demons immediately.

“Hngh, Little Soul, you stole my thunder,” said the grey-clothed old lady.

“Haha, I could never, Elder Shehua.” Saint Soul laughed respectfully.
