Chapter 5416 ¬†Friendship

Near the Swirling Sea.

The Island Lords Gui Ling received the message and immediately took action. However, they lost contact with Mo Qian and the others shortly after setting out.

"The intelligence is flawed. Mo Qian has already fallen," remarked a tier 6 Emperor skilled in deduction.

He had long deduced that Gong Miaoyi's strength had significantly increased, far beyond that of an ordinary tier 5 Emperor, with two formidable allies by her side.

Island Lord Gui Ling had an unpleasant expression. After waiting for so long, they still couldn't locate Gong Miaoyi. Now, when they finally received information, it vanished again.

On the side of the inheritors, many powerful individuals had gathered.

In the main hall where Zhen Wuyang resided.

Crash!

Chishui directly shattered the teacup into pieces, cursing, "People from the Grave God Mountain are one thing, but why are the elders from the Elder Palace here too? Those old wastes, what use are they? They've been stuck at the same level for a lifetime, why compete with us for opportunities?"

"Brother Chishui, don't get too angry. Even if the Elder Palace's strongmen come, they may not necessarily surpass us!" Tongtian Buddha remained calm, observing everything.

Zhen Wuyang stayed silent, but internally, he cursed. Tongtian Buddha had already saturated his opportunities, so he naturally didn't care about this small matter. It was easy for him to speak.

The Elder Palace sent the Hall of Enforcement, with Wu Zuo in command.

Two tier 6 peak-level Emperors and ten tier 5 peak-level Emperors, each possessing complete Origin Source Dao. Just the two tier 6 Emperors alone could sweep aside everyone present.

Although all were forces under Zhen Ling, when it came to competing for treasures, no one would yield.

What would happen when the time came?

"The situation has somewhat exceeded our control!" Zhen Wuyang spoke up, "Brother Chishui, don't you have some connection with Senior Shang? Perhaps you could..."

Chishui's expression changed, and he cleared his throat a few times. He first took out a new teacup, poured himself a cup of tea, and slowly took a sip.

Zhen Wuyang and Tongtian Buddha were anxious but didn't want to rush him.

"I do have some friendship with Senior Shang!"

While he said that, those who rose to prominence early knew that he and Shang rose to power together, belonging to the same generation. However, they had significant grievances.

Even back in the Bloodthirst Continent, they didn't get along.

It wasn't until the Grave God Mountain, where he heard that Shang had reached tier 6, and was treated like a treasure by Zhen Ling. They heard that Shang carefully cultivated, and that he changed his attitude. He even lowered his status to mend relations.

Shang, naturally quiet and reserved, had similar topics with his peers, and they reconciled to some extent.

Zhen Wuyang smiled and said loudly, "Brother Chishui has a wide circle of friends. Tongtian and I admire that. If Senior Shang can be persuaded to come this time, I think we're at least 90 percent secure."

These words were appreciated by Chishui.

"Then I'll ask?"

"Please ask!"

Hahaha!!!

With similar smiles, Chishui really went to ask.

Grave God Mountain.

In a cave halfway up the mountain, Chishui's avatar stood up and walked out.

Looking up.

Grave God Mountain had 88 layers, and Chishui was currently on the 40th floor.

To climb higher required strength.

In Grave God Mountain, flying was restricted, but if you could break through the 60th floor, you could fly as you pleased.

Following the stairs, he walked all the way to the 64th floor. ƒêiscover nùíÜw chaptùíÜrs ùíên n0ùíóe(l)biùíè(.)com

The only abode of the Ultimate Emperor 'Shang' was right here.

The entire 64th level, all to himself.

"Senior Shang!"

Chishui, with a smile on his face, called out softly.

Ripples gradually rose in the abode, and a man with white temples but a young face walked out.

"Chishui!" After a reply, Shang couldn't help but comment, "How many times have I told you, let's just call each other brothers!"

Chishui's face shook, saying solemnly, "Absolutely not, you are now a tier 6 Emperor, naturally, you're my senior!"

"You!" Shang pointed at Chishui, and in the end, he could only shake his head helplessly.

If they really followed the hierarchy, he would have to address Chishui as an 'ancestor'.

In his youth, Shang's Dao Companion was a Special Life Form, connected with Chishui from childhood, considered of the same lineage.

It was because of this Dao Companion that he came to know Chishui, and their relationship became strained due to their evenly matched strengths.

Now, resolving the tension, Chishui's current attitude truly made him uncomfortable.

"Let's go, we can talk inside!" Shang waved his hand, and the two entered the abode.

Though called an abode, it was a miniature world where ordinary people lived, and Shang's residence was on a cloud peak.

Bao Han Court!

The two sat facing each other.

"Is this your avatar?" A breath dispersed, and Chishui only then discovered that Shang was actually just an avatar, but the power emanating from it was vastly different.

Shang didn't conceal it either, nodding and personally pouring tea for Chishui.

Chishui was surprised; after several years, Shang's strength seemed to have increased significantly.

Now, just a mere manifestation of his avatar left Chishui unable to fathom the depths.

"This time coming, it seems there's some business," Shang remarked, understanding without further elaboration.

Chishui didn't beat around the bush either and straightforwardly stated, "Indeed, a small matter!"

"A small matter?"

"A small matter!"

However, after hearing Chishui's account, Shang's gaze shifted.

This small matter was not trivial. When his true self ventured beyond the realms, Zhen Ling personally orchestrated this affair. Perhaps Chishui and the others were unaware.

"I'll go!"

Seeing the decisiveness of the other party, Chishui thought he was being given face and stood up, somewhat excited.

Following Shang meant at least he could get some benefits, maybe even a chance to partake in some substantial gains.

"But my true self is not in this place. This time, I can only send my avatar," Shang said with a faint smile.

Chishui had no objections to this.

Just this avatar was impenetrable to him, with strength at least ffreaching the pinnacle of tier 6. Coupled with the Ultimate Emperor level, it possessed a flawlessly perfect Origin Source.

Even the formidable experts of the Elder Palace would be swept away.

With powerful external assistance secured, Chishui gained some confidence in front of Zhen Wuyang and Tongtian Buddha.

"Two gentlemen, I'll be straightforward. Since the four of us are joining forces, should we reconsider the distribution?" Chishui glanced at the two.

Given Shang's status, he would probably disdain such matters, so Chishui had to handle them in advance.

"Naturally!" Zhen Wuyang nodded and said, "In that case, I'll contribute two-tenths, and the two of you can contribute two-tenths each!"

Tongtian Buddha was indifferent.

Previously, they had agreed on a three-three-four split, with Zhen Wuyang taking four-tenths.

Of course, this was all based on treasures obtained collectively. If someone relied on luck to acquire a treasure, it would be considered personal.

Suppose three people cooperated to seize a treasure; then, it would be divided according to a three-three-four ratio.

Now, with Zhen Wuyang offering one-tenth and the other two contributing one-tenth each, it became a three-three-two-two split.

Chishui really wanted to say that Zhen Wuyang was just as greedy as Shang, getting the same share as him. Was it just because he initiated the proposal?
