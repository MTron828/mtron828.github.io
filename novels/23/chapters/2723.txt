Chapter 2724: Cemetery

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Besides Jian Wushaung, the other five also had one of those six Interspatial Rings.

Jian Wushuang had no idea what treasures those five people had but judging from their noticeable electrified expressions, they must have got some extremely precious treasures as well.

The six of them gradually calm down after the big surprise.

“Although the treasures we got from this palace are extraordinary, the real great opportunity of this secret realm is in its deepest part. What we have now is just some entrée,” ​​said Saber Master.

Jian Wushuang and the others nodded.

They had indeed just entered the ancient castle and had merely gotten a door gift prepared for them by the secret realm’s owner. Those treasures were nothing compared to the real opportunity within the secret realm.

“We’d better be well prepared especially for those who need to restore their divine power and heal their wounds. Let’s be in our top form as the journey we are facing next is not as easy as before,” warned the Saber Master.

Devilish Wind King and others looked solemn. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

They knew the oncoming events so they felt a fair bit of pressure on their shoulders.

The six people soon began to recuperate and recover their lost divine power in the dim palace.

They were recovering from the trials they went through at the place of crisis second stage where they dueled against the spirits of principles and lost a great deal of divine power.

Jian Wushuang sat down and swallowed a few pills—pretending to be recovering from his injuries.

10 days passed by very quickly.

After 10 days, they had restored most of their divine power.

“Alliance Master Su Han, how are your injuries? Have you recovered from it?” Devilish Wind King looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Fortunately, I’ve recovered seventy percent of my strength after swallowing some pills, but it’ll probably take several months for me to fully recover,” replied Jian Wushuang.

“Oh, do you want us to spend a month waiting for you here?” Someone spoke coldly. It was none other than Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen.

“Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen, we’re not in a rush, are we? We should be able to spend another month or so here,” said Devilish Wind King.

“What do you mean?” Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen shot a sharp glare at Devilish Wind King and seemed unhappy with his response.

“It’s alright.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand and smiled. “Although my strength has not been fully restored, there shouldn’t be a problem for me to get into some action. Let’s start.”

“Alliance Master Su Han, are you sure?” Devilish Wind King frowned.

“Yes, I’m sure.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Devilish Wind King did not say much after that.

“Let’s move on quickly,” suggested Saber Master.

The other Grand Ultimate God exchanged looks. They were well prepared so none of them had any disagreement.

Jian Wushuang also nodded.

The group of six soon set off again.

They moved along the dim palace and continued to the depths of the ancient castle. After crossing a corridor, a huge cemetery appeared before Jian Wushuang.

“This is...” Jian Wushuang was surprised to see the scene before him.

What greeted his eyes was a huge piece of boundless dark gray land. On the ground were many small greenstone coffins about two yards lengthwise which was the normal size for a human’s usage.

There were too many of those stone coffins.

The stone coffins were densely packed with very little space between each of them and no end to it.

Jian Wushuang conservatively estimated that there were at least a few thousand of those stone coffins just from seeing with his naked eyes.

However, he probably only saw a small part of the entire cemetery.

“Alliance Master Su Han, have you noticed the black mist in this cemetery?” Devilish Wind King beside Jian Wushuang glanced over his shoulder.

“Yes, the pungent black mist is coming from the corpses,” said Jian Wushuang.

Devilish Wind King agreed, “Yes, it’s the smell of the corpses. Precisely, I think it’s poison released from the corpses and it’s very strong. You can take two steps forward and have a look at it.”

Jian Wushuang took two steps forward as suggested by Devilish Wind King and immediately sensed the black mist sweeping toward him. A thick corpse scent filled his surroundings as the corrosive black mist came directly at him and attacked his divine body.

“It’s very poisonous indeed.” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes slightly.

He could feel the poison released from the corpses in the black mist was potent and sufficient to corrode a cultivator’s divine body.

It could probably destroy the divine body of an ordinary Heaven Ultimate God within seconds.

As for the Grand Ultimate Gods, they felt slightly better as they had the tyrannical divine power to resist the poison. However, a greater amount of divine power would be consumed the longer they stayed in the cemetery.

“These are some Corpse Poison Pills I’ve specially hired someone to refine these years. Although these are not high-level pills, it helps to resist the poison nonetheless. Alliance Master Su Han, I’ll give you one of these.” Devilish Wind King took out a reddish-black pill and handed it to Jian Wushuang.

“Thank you very much.” Jian Wushuang thanked him as he accepted the Corpse Poison Pill and immediately swallowed it.

It did not make a difference to him whether he took the Corpse Poison Pill or not.

Jian Wushuang was a Perfect Chaotic Creature. His divine body was impermeable by many types of poisons. Not to mention the poison from those corpses, he was immune to many other poisons that were a hundred times more powerful.

However, he pretended that he needed the Corpse Poison Pill and consumed it.

Devilish Wind King was not the only one as Saber Master, Hong Chen, Long Xianzi, and Yi Shen also came prepared with their Corpse Poison Pills and swallowed it.

Then...

“Let’s go,” said Saber Master before the group of six immediately skimmed forward.

Devilish Wind King was telling Jian Wushuang about the cemetery along the way.

“Alliance Master Su Han, this cemetery we are in now should be the third stage place of crisis and it’s more dangerous than the previous two places,” said Devilish Wind King seriously.

“This cemetery is huge and extensive. I don’t know for sure how big it is and how long it’ll take to walk through this cemetery because we stopped here at this cemetery the last time we came to this secret realm. We were unable to go past this cemetery.” Jian Wushuang showed quite a solemn expression upon hearing it.

He knew Devilish Wind King and the others came with the same lineup of six Grand Ultimate Gods the last time they were at the secret realm but had stopped at the cemetery.

The cemetery was very dangerous.

“This cemetery is mysterious and extremely dangerous. First and foremost is the corpse poison that is all over the cemetery. We did not prepare any Corpse Poison Pill the last time we were here and had to rely on a lot of our divine power to resist the poison’s corrosive effects. Therefore, our divine power had been insufficient for us to carry on. We came prepared this time, so it’s much better. However, this poison isn’t the most dangerous thing in this cemetery. Instead, the stone coffins around us are the most dangerous...”
