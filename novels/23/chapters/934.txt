Chapter 935: The Seal Was Broken

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“How is this possible?” Xia Mang was stunned.

How could Jian Wushuang kill one of them when the three of them had gone up against him together?

“Does this younger still have tricks up his sleeve?”?Xia Mang thought in fear.

Indeed, Jian Wushuang possessed unusual skills. He was unable to use his Mind-controlling Secret Skill in his battle with Xia Mang earlier, but in this battle against three Dao Masters, he surprisingly unleashed the skill in combination with the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation. It was so effective that he instantly killed one of his opponents.

This was the first Dao Master that Jian Wushuang killed!

It was unusual for an Eternal Realm expert to kill a Dao Master.

However, few noticed this as three Dao Masters had died earlier in the battle.

“Master Mubai, Jian Wushuang is too powerful. We can’t beat him,” Xia Qi said.

“I know.” Xia Mang was sullen. “I’ve already asked Elder He for help.”

“Elder He?” Xia Qi was pleasantly surprised.

Though both sides were evenly-matched, Emperor Leng’s camp outnumbered the other side. Thus, they were able to team up and confront their enemies together.

The gloomy and cold Elder He had been fighting together with a Heavenly Guard against a War God of the other camp not far away. He withdrew from that fight after receiving Xia Mang’s request and hastily rushed over to the latter.

“Elder He,” Xia Mang greeted.

Elder He stared fixedly at Jian Wushuang without replying to him.

“Kid, I know that you’re the one who killed Second Master,” he said.

Back then, he had accompanied Xia Yan to go to Cercis Island for a marriage proposal. In the end, the proposal failed and Xia Yan was even killed. When he returned to the Xia Clan, he was punished for failing to protect his master. Since then, he held a grudge against Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang recognized Elder He, too.

“Be careful. This person ought to be Rank Two Dao Master.” Gu King’s voice resounded inside him.

“Rank Two Dao Master?” Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrunk. “That means he has opened up two Dao?”

There were three ranks for a Dao Master.

One rank meant one Dao.

A Rank One Dao Master had opened up one Dao; a Rank Two Dao Master had opened up two Dao, and so on.

“But his Dao is just at the normal level, and he’s at the lower level among Rank Two Dao Masters. You can try fighting him,” Gu King said.

“I understand.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and in next moment, dozens of Flowing Lights burst out of his Interspatial Ring. The Flowing Lights merged and formed the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation that hovered in front of him.

This was the Second Sword Formation of the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation!

“Kill!”

Jian Wushuang wielded the lavender lightsaber formed out of 72 One-meter Swords and swung it at the Void.

With a sharp and harsh sound, the lightsaber struck Elder He like a rapidly rotating “awl”.

The crazing rotating “awl” struck Elder He’s head with an incredible power at lightning speed.

The attack would have killed an ordinary Rank One Dao Master before he could react. Elder He was different.

“Humph!”

Elder He gave his sleeve a flick and gray mist began gushing out. The mist gathered and soon formed a gray cloud.

When the “awl” crashed into the vast and mysterious gray cloud, it was as if it hit a mass of cotton. It went through the cloud effortlessly.

“What a joke.”

With another flick of his sleeve, Elder He sent the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation flying back at Jian Wushuang, along with the gray cloud.

“What kind of skill is this?”?Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“His Dao might be weak but it’s very strange. Be careful,” Gu King said.

“Do I need you to tell me that?” Jian Wushuang retorted. He then threw himself backward at a high speed.

However, the gray cloud was even faster and it soon enveloped him completely.

He couldn’t see anything in the cloud and was beginning to lose his consciousness, too.

“Boom!”

When he heard a wind-breaking sound next to him, he hastily turned around. However, it was too late for a vigorous palm smashed heavily onto his chest.

“Pfft!”

Jian Wushuang coughed up blood as he was thrown out of the cloud at high speed. His face turned deathly pale.

Over on the stand, Leng Rushuang witnessed everything happening to him.

The war had been going on for a quite a while and more than half of the imperial palace was already in ruins. The experts were also engaged in heated battles but no matter how mad the situation became, no one tried to attack Leng Rushuang.

No one wanted to hurt her and thus, kept their distance from her.

Therefore, she stood in place as a spectator of the battle since the beginning.

Her beautiful face was pale with fright, but the most visible emotion she was expressing was… anger!

Yes, it was anger!

Her anger was ignited when she saw Elder He severely injuring Jian Wushuang.

“Why?”

“Mother, why?” she whispered.

Her voice was so low that only she could hear it. The rest were naturally oblivious, as focused on the battle as they were.

“For all my life, I’ve never once disobeyed your words or went against your wishes!”

“When Father broke things off with you and subsequently suffered defeat in your hands, I still stayed with you despite knowing it was your fault!”

“So why… why would you treat me this way?”

“I love Jian Wushuang!”

“I want to marry him. Why… why would you stop me?”

“Why?”

Leng Rushuang bellowed, her voice sending tremors through the world. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

There were unprecedented anger and madness in her eyes.

There had been a heavy Seal placed on her a long time ago to seal the Icy Heart Poison inside her body.

It was also meant to seal something more terrifying and inconceivable inside her.

Now, alongside the crazed look in her eyes, the Seal was unexpectedly broken…
