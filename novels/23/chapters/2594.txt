After returning to the Territorial Lord Mansion, Jian Wushuang handed over the mansion’s matters to Xiao Tiexin and Cang Heng before going into seclusion again.

His only purpose for going into seclusion was to refine the Primordial Stones and make a breakthrough to Peak Ultimate God!

He was able to display the powers of a Primary-level Earth Ultimate God when he discharged his divine power. Nonetheless, his real divine power was merely at the High-level Ultimate God under the black stone’s disguise. He was still a step away from becoming Peak Ultimate God.

He wanted to cross into the higher cultivation realm before the auction started.

That was his desire. However, he was uncertain if it could be done at his will. The divine power contained in the Primordial Stones was no longer enough for him after all. Although the divine power was vast enough, its purity was far from sufficient. However, he could attempt crossing over to the Peak Ultimate God realm with such a large number of Primordial Stones at his disposal.

He was really uncertain if he could make a breakthrough so he could only try his best.

A month passed in a blink of an eye.

In the void above Northern Darkstar Territory, two figures were heading in the Territorial Lord Mansion side by side.

Those two people which consist of a man and a woman looked very young.

“We should be arriving at the Territorial Lord Mansion soon. I really want to see what the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord who killed Zhong Hun looks like.” A handsome white-robed young man smiled. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Senior Brother, don’t you think you’re expecting too much of the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord? He probably just got lucky. How good could he be?” A red-clothed girl next to the young man pouted.

“Junior Sister, don’t underestimate him or should I say don’t underestimate Zhong Hun. Zhong Hun was from the Witchcraft and Wizardry Sect who are extremely cunning with their despicable means. Both of us paid a huge price to force him into a dead end. I thought he was going to die, but he managed to escape from under our noses with his trump card.

“Even if he was hurt and suffered from the backlash to the point that he lost his strength, someone like him was easy to be killed. However, he ends up dying in the hands of the Territorial Lord. I don’t believe the Territorial Lord is just lucky and inept,” said the young man.

He knew exactly how difficult it was to deal with Zhong Hun.

It was why he became curious about the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord who killed Zhong Hun.

“We’re here.”

The duo arrived in front of the Territorial Lord Mansion and stopped.

“Territorial Lord.”

The young man shouted with his loud and clear voice which reverberated every corner of the mansion including the underground palace’s secret chamber where Jian Wushuang was. Jian Wushuang heard the young man.

Jian Wushuang who had remained in the secret chamber to refine Primordial Stones while trying to find ways of making a breakthrough to the Peak Ultimate God realm immediately opened his eyes and furrowed his brows slightly.

The very next second, he took action and appeared in the void above the mansion before the two youngsters.

“The two of you...” Jian Wushuang looked at the two people in front of him and was shaken up.

‘Heaven Ultimate God! These two people are both at the Heaven Ultimate God realm!’

The two of them did not hide their divine power breath, hence Jian Wushuang noticed their realm at a glance. Those two were genuine Heaven Ultimate God experts and unlike Zhong Hun, both were at their peak—especially that handsome young man.

The young man just stood there. Although he did not make any move, he was exerting an invisible pressure on Jian Wushuang. The pressure he exuded was much stronger than any Jian Wushuang had ever experienced in his current life. He was a terrifying Heaven Ultimate God.

“I’m Jian Yi. A pleasure to meet the two Masters.”

Jian Wushuang was respectful toward the experts and saluted them slightly.

“Is Jian Yi your name?” The handsome young man looked at Jian Wushuang with a gentle smile on his face. “My name is Su Qin and this is my junior sister, Liu Xian’er. We’re both here to meet the Territorial Lord.”

“I wonder why the two of you are looking for me?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Hang on. Could you invite us into your mansion first?” Su Qin asked.

“Of course! Please, Masters.” Jian Wushuang led the two of them to his mansion.

In a majestic hall, the three of them sat down on a table respectively as Xiao Tiexin and several maids brought food and wine.

“Xin’er, you may leave first,” ordered Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Xiao Tiexin nodded and peeked at the Su Qin duo before leaving.

After they left, Jian Wushuang waved his hand and set up a heavy restrictive shield around the hall.

“Masters, could you please tell me about the matter now?” Jian Wushuang remained humble but unperturbed.

Jian Wushuang was capable of fighting against a Heaven Ultimate God and even an Undying Saint. There was no need for him to be afraid as opponents at those levels were no longer able to kill him.

“Territorial Lord, the two of us are here only for one matter. I wonder if you’ve heard of Zhong Hun?” Su Qin smiled and studied Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang remained a straight face but his heart skipped a beat.

He guessed those two people were probably there for Zhong Hun and was proven to be right.

“I do know Zhong Hun. I killed him.” Jian Wushuang was straightforward.

He knew very well the two people must have learned the news of him killing Zhong Hun and he would not quibble at all.

“The two Masters came to me because of Zhong Hun. I guess both of you must be the ones who caused him to be in such a miserable state?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Why are you so sure? Can’t we be Zhong Hun’s comrade? You ought to know that Zhong Hun came from an impressive background.” Su Qin smiled.

“Zhong Hun was indeed powerful. However, I’m sure he had no companions—at least none in Danyang Holy Domain. Otherwise, he could have sent a message to his companions and asked them for help instead of hiding alone in a deserted area under my Northern Darkstar Territory. Why would he choose to rely on killing and absorbing the soul powers of some ordinary cultivators to restore his strength?” Jian Wushuang said.

“That’s right.” Su Qin nodded and immediately smiled. “We are indeed the ones who severely injured Zhong Hun and wanted to directly kill him, but his impressive life-saving technique saved him and allowed him to escape.

“We have been looking for his traces in the nearby territory all this time but to no avail. Not too long ago, we received news that Zhong Hun was killed by the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord.”
