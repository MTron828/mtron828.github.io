Chapter 2263 Heaven’s Horizon

This was the outermost area of the Eternal Chaotic World. This was where Heaven and Earth ended.Here, there was no life, no mountains or valleys. It was just a space that was dark and misty.

This was different from the dark space within the Eternal Chaotic World. The dark space was extremely vast and seemed endless.

On the other hand, there was a limit as there was black mist here. It seemed as though there were restrictions in this dark mist that completely blocked off the Eternal Chaotic World and the Absolute Beginning Divin World.

Jian Wushuang and the other experts took a spaceship and set off from Thunderbolt Island, reached their destination quickly.

“Is that Heaven’s Horizon?”

Jian Wushuang stood as he looked at the dark mist in the distance.

The dark mist looked so fragile and weak that a gale could simply disperse it. In reality, no ordinary man could open this passageway.

“Here is the place,” Emperor Bai said with a very serious tone.

“This is where the Eternal Chaotic World ends. Many years ago during the first era, many experts from the Absolute Beginning Divine World opened a passageway here and sent in a wave of experts. Most of them were in the Divine Demon Realm. There were also some who were more powerful.”

“That battle was extremely tragic!”

“In that era, countless experts and great emperors sacrificed their lives just to keep this world safe.”

“Now, the passageway is about to open again. Who knows if the people over in the Absolute Beginning Divine World will send in another wave of experts. If another wave comes it will be a disaster for the Eternal Chaotic World, as the threat is even greater than that of the Three Emperors World back in the past.”

The great emperors turned pale when they heard what Emperor Bai said.

After all these years, they had gotten to know certain secrets from the first era and the ancient past from the experts from the ancient past who had awakened.

They knew why the first era had ended.

They feared the Absolute Beginning Divine World.

“Do not worry. The reason why the super powers from the Absolute Beginning Divine World opened this passageway is so that those experts from the ancient past who awakened can return. They will not completely destroy the Eternal Chaotic World,” Jian Wushuang said.

He had discussed this matter with Emperor Thirteen and One-Star Man and come to that conclusion.

Emperor Thirteen and One-Star Man confirmed this fact, and Emperor Thirteen sounded very certain.

As a man who could go up against the Master of Holy Land, if Emperor Thirteen said that the Absolute Beginning Divine World would not send in any experts, he should be right.

“Looks like we are early. Up till now, no expert from the ancient past who awakened has come,” the Abysmal Saint Master said.

“The passageway should open in a few days. It is normal for these experts to not come at this time. Let us wait patiently. They should be here soon,” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

“Yes, let us wait,” Emperor Bai said.

The great emperors from the Eternal Chaotic World started to wait in this space patiently.

Two figures appeared in the distance as they headed towards them at a very fast speed.

“Here they are.”

“Two experts from the ancient past.”

The great emperors from the Eternal Chaotic World looked over the two figures who were heading closer.

One was an elder with red hair, while the other was a woman with blue clothes.

Their auras were far stronger than that of any ordinary great emperor. Without a doubt, they were experts from the ancient past.

They noticed the presence of Jian Wushuang and experts after they reached Heaven’s Horizon.

“They are from Sanctuary Alliance!”

“Emperor Bai! And that man standing right at the front is Sword Emperor!”

The elder with red hair and the woman in blue clothes turned pale. They were fearful of Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai.

Both of them were ordinary experts in the Divine Demon Realm. Under the Restriction of Heaven and Earth, the fighting power they had was similar to that of an ordinary stage three great emperor. They were nothing compared to Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai.

Three thousand nine hundred years ago, Jian Wushuang had massacred eleven experts in the Divine Demon Realm.

“We must be careful. Let us not go over there. If Emperor Bai or the Sword Emperor head towards us, we shall escape immediately,” the elder man with red hair said.

“Yes.” The woman in blue clothes nodded her head.

They did not know why the group of great emperors from Sanctuary Alliance came to Heaven’s Horizon. They had to be cautious.

After all, they would not joke around when their lives were at stake.

However, it was evident that Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai did not want to attack them.

They were just gathered there, waiting.

Time passed in the blink of an eye. More and more experts reached Heaven’s Horizon.

Three days passed.

There was not much time left before the passageway would open. Those experts who wished to leave using the passageway had all reached it.

In the dark space before Heaven’s Horizon, figures filled the entire space. Some were gathered in groups, while others gathered in pairs.

One could see hundreds of experts in a single glance.

“So, so many people!”

“These people are all experts from the ancient past. The weakest among them have the fighting power of a stage three great emperor. They are much stronger than us.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“I have carefully counted. There are one-hundred-and-thirty-eight experts.”

“One-hundred-and-thirty-eight? Oh my god!”

The great emperors from the Eternal Chaotic World felt as though there was something stuck in their dry throats.

Simply thinking of one-hundred-and-thirty-eight experts with at least the fighting power of a stage three great emperor could make one’s hair stand on end.

Within the Eternal Chaotic World, only Jian Wushuang, Emperor Bai and Jian Yi had the fighting power of a stage three great emperor.

Jian Yi also came from the ancient past.

“Luckily, Emperor Bai and the Sword Emperor are around as deterrents. If these experts go wild...” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

Indeed one-hundred-and-thirty-eight experts from the ancient past would be disastrous for the Eternal Chaotic World if Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai were not around. Without them, the Sanctuary Alliance would have no way of controlling these experts.

The great emperors from the Eternal Chaotic World felt glad that they had these two incredibly powerful people as their leaders.
