Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“He has indeed defeated me before,” Real God Tian Ming admitted right away.

“There you have it. Since you are also not his opponent, if I were to bet a match with him, wouldn’t I be making myself embarrassed? Moreover, I do not have much training time left in the Fairy Palace,” Real God Chen Yue forced a smile. After that, he asked immediately, “For you to come again now, could it be that you wish to have a battle with Jian Wushuang again?”

Real God Tian Ming shook his head, “Jian Wushuang’s level of comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way is extremely high. Although I have improved during the past two thousand years, he must have improved a lot as well. Hence, I am not confident that I can defeat him. Let us observe the situation first.”

“Yes, you’re right,” Real God Chen Yue nodded his head.

At that moment… Swoosh!

A figure entered the Fighting Space and this attracted the attention of many experts in the wrestling ring.

“It’s Real God Xian Feng!” Chen Yue was shocked.

“It’s him?” Real God Tian Ming’s eyes squinted.

Most of the people in the Thunderbolt Island were Eternal Real Gods. Although there were also a few Void Real Gods, there were very few of them.

Among the Void Real Gods on the Thunderbolt Island, Real God Tian Ming was considered one of the top Gods. However, there were also Void Real Gods who were stronger than him and one of them was naturally the Monster King.

The Monster King of the Soaring Heaven King Palace had been recognized as the number one among the Void Real Gods. Thus, Real God Tian Ming’s abilities were naturally incomparable to the Monster King’s.

Apart from the Monster King, the only other Void Real God in Thunderbolt Island who had made him extremely fearful was Real God Xian Feng.

Within the Fighting Space.

Real God Xian Feng had already appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“One thousand years of training time in the Thunderbolt Island, as well as a hundred Doctrine Gems?” Real God Xian Feng was looking at Jian Wushuang.

“That’s right,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“Alright. I have ten years of training time in the Fairy Palace. Let’s get started.” Real God Xian Feng had a cold expression and his hands were already holding his purple saber.

“As you wish,” Jian Wushuang laughed and the Blood Mountain Sword had already appeared in his hands.

After that… Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s body moved straight away.

He did not use his martial art motion. Instead, he only relied on his own speed as well his comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine. However, the speed that he unleashed in an instant caused many Real Gods outside the Fighting Space to open their eyes wide.

“This speed?” Real God Xian Feng was shocked as well.

“The fourth level?”

“His comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine has definitely achieved the standard needed to clear the fourth level!”

Real God Xian Feng’s expression turned ugly at once.

He knew that Jian Wushuang had defeated Real God Tian Ming before two thousand years ago. Moreover, with Jian Wushuang’s talents, his abilities would definitely be stronger after two thousand years.

However, he did not expect Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine to be able to achieve the standard needed to clear the fourth level of the Doctrine Palace in just a short two thousand years.

After all, it would be more difficult to comprehend the Power of Heaven Way the more one comprehended it.

The fourth level of the Doctrine Palace was equivalent to the standard of a Chaotic Real God and it would not be easy to achieve it. For example, a top genius like him had been stuck at the third level for a very long period of time and he had been unable to achieve the fourth level. However, Jian Wushuang had actually managed to achieve the fourth level so easily?

“Damn it!”

Real God Xian Feng gave a cry. When he saw Jian Wushuang’s body appearing in front of him, he became vigilant immediately and also held his saber tighter.

Swish!

Jian Wushuang attacked with his sword straight away. Under the influence of the Power of Spacetime, the stroke was so fast that even the naked eyes of a Void Real God were unable to capture it.

Real God Xian Feng also swung his saber to block the attack immediately.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

The both of them fought instantly. Moreover, the battle entered the climax as soon as they fought.If you like reading comics please visit Webnovel.live

As for the experts outside the Fighting Space, they could tell with a glance that the battle was completely one-sided.

Real God Xian Feng had also comprehended two Doctrines at the same time. Moreover, both his Doctrines had achieved the peak of the third level and they were very close to the fourth level.

However, even though he was only one small step away, the gap between the power levels was so great that it was shocking.

Jian Wushuang did not even need to use his Reincarnation Doctrine. He relied purely on his comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine, as well as his own Sword Principles. Moreover, he did not even unleash his Power of Spacetime fully. However, even with all that, he still managed to completely suppress Real God Xian Feng.

“It’s too fast. His speed is really too fast!”

“Can’t last any longer, I can’t last any longer!”

Real God Xian Feng was roaring in his mind. Although he did his best to block the attacks and had also used all his tricks, he had only lasted for a short period of time against Jian Wushuang’s attacks and he was defeated in the end.

The Fighting Space had already quieted down completely.

Jian Wushuang still stood in his own position and he was putting the Blood Mountain Sword on his hands back into his scabbard slowly. In front of him, Real God Xian Feng was staring at him with an extremely grave expression.

“Thank you for letting me win,” Jian Wushuang chuckled.

“As expected of an Inverse Cultivator. Although you have only just become a Real God, your comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine has already achieved the standard needed to clear the fourth level of the Doctrine Palace. You are indeed impressive and I accept my defeat,” Real God Xian Feng said with a low voice. After that, he took out a Token of the Fairy Palace’s Legacy, gave Jian Wushuang ten years of training time and left.

Outside the Fighting Space, Real God Tian Ming and Real God Chen Yue was together.

“Even Real God Xian Feng has been defeated. This Jian Wushuang is very strong!” Real God Chen Yue exclaimed in admiration.

“He has already made a breakthrough to Real God. Moreover, his comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine has already achieved the standard needed to clear the fourth level of the Doctrine Palace. Hence, it’s normal for Real God Xian Feng to not be his opponent,” Real God Tian Ming said.

“Fourth level of the Doctrine Palace… that is the standard of a Chaotic Real God’s comprehension. Since Jian Wushuang is so strong, who would still dare to have a match with him?” Real God Chen Yue said.

“Hmph, of course there is someone who would dare to bet a match with him,” Real God Tian Ming’s eyes turned cold.

“Tian Ming, you are referring to…” Real God Chen Yue looked toward Real God Tian Ming.

“There’s no rush. I have already sent a message to get him to come here,” Real God Tian Ming laughed coldly.

In no time, a figure appeared within the wrestling ring.

When that person appeared, many Real Gods in the wrestling ring looked over immediately. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“The Monster King!”

Everyone’s eyes turned grave.

Even though quite a number of people present were Eternal Real Gods and the person who came was merely a Void Real God, no one dared to underestimate him.

After all, he was Monster King, the number one among the Void Real Gods.

“Xian Feng, even you were defeated?”

The Monster King was still gloomy and evil like before.

“I was defeated. There’s indeed quite a large gap in our abilities,” Real God Xian Feng admitted magnanimously.

“This will be interesting,” the Monster King grinned. However, his eyes turned hazy, “Back then, Jian Wushuang left the Thunderbolt Island and it is unknown as to where he went. Moreover, he left for two thousand years and when he returned, he had actually made a breakthrough to Real God already?”

“Monster King, are you here for Jian Wushuang as well?” Real God Xian Feng looked toward the Monster King.

“Haha. This Jian Wushuang is an Inverse Cultivator. Although I have defeated him in the past, he was merely a Universe God that time. But now… I wish to see how strong he is after making a breakthrough to Real God,” the Monster King laughed nonchalantly.

“Then you had better be careful and not be careless. If not, you will have to give away your position as the number one of the Void Real Gods,” Real God Xian Feng said.
