“Continue to the next force?”

Jian Wushuang slowly shook his head. “This will be the end of this trip. Our Sword Alliance has huge gains as we’ve gained control of the lands that originally belonged to the Seven Absolute Temple and Blood Water Gang after continuously wiping them out. If we continue our path, brothers of the Divine Sword Army might be able to take it but the remaining third-rated forces aren’t dumb. I’m sure they have already gotten news about what our Sword Alliance is doing and will be prepared.”

“There’s a possibility that the remaining three forces have already gathered together. We might not be able to gain an upper hand if we continue our journey of conquering others. Let’s focus on integrating the lands we’ve just gained and talk about this later.”

“Alright.” Long Shan nodded.

The Divine Sword Army soldiers were slightly disappointed when they knew the journey of conquering others was not continuing but they quickly settled down.

They knew that they were the Sword Alliance’s sharpest sword and they were not in a hurry as there would surely be a lot more conquering battles like what they had experienced that day.

As the Sword Alliance was busy integrating the territories that once belonged to the Seven Absolute Temple and Blood Water Gang, the rulers of the remaining three third-rated forces had already gathered together just as Jian Wushuang expected.

They were in a huge mansion where the Corpse Palace was located.

In the huge hall, a bald man who was like a bag of bones was sitting on the throne. There was a wine glass on the table in front of him that was filled with crimson-colored blood.

It was the blood of a virgin.

The bald old man’s face was filled with anticipation and desire as he looked at the virgin’s blood in the glass. He picked up the glass and slightly wet the corner of his lips before gulping everything down. He had a prolonged intoxicated and content expression on his face after drinking the blood.

“Palace Master Gu Mo is still extremely laid back when we’re already in an imminent crisis.” A slightly unfriendly voice could be heard. The person speaking was a middle-aged man in long robes seated in front of a table at the end of the hall.

The middle-aged man in long robes was emitting a powerful Peak Heaven Ultimate God aura. There was a lady in green clothing sitting opposite of him who had her eyes closed but a serious expression on her face nonetheless.

The bald old man had finally put down the wine glass in his hands and glanced over at the duo sitting underneath before smiling and asked, “An imminent crisis? Everything is going well, so where is this imminent crisis coming from?”

“Palace Master Gu Mo. Do you really not know or are you faking it? The Sword Alliance has already taken action. They managed to conquer both the Seven Absolute Temple and Blood Water Gang in less than two days. At this rate, the next force the Sword Alliance will be aiming for could be my Divine Dragon Pavilion or the Purple Dress House. They might even directly take action towards your Corpse Palace.”

“The Sword Alliance is coming at such a menacing rate. We might follow in the footsteps of Seven Absolute Temple and Blood Water Gang if we don’t prepare ourselves,” shouted the middle-aged man in long robes who was also the Divine Dragon Pavilion Master in a deep voice.

“Brother Sheng Long, aren’t you worrying unnecessarily? Putting the fact that the Sword Alliance might not even take action against both of you. Even if they really take action against you, you shouldn’t be afraid either as all of us are third-rated forces after all,” said the bald old man slowly who was also one of the Corpse Palace Masters—Palace Master Gu Mo.

The Corpse Palace had two palace masters—Gu Mo and Shi Mo. Both of them were Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods.

Between the two of them, Shi Mo was much stronger but seldom involved himself in mundane affairs. Gu Mo was the one taking care of the Corpse Palace’s daily affairs.

“Palace Master Gu Mo, I’m not in the mood for jokes at such important times,” said the long-robed middle-aged man coldly.

He clearly understood the strength of his Divine Dragon Pavilion. As a third-rated force, the Divine Dragon Pavilion’s strength was similar to the Seven Absolute Palace and Blood Water Gang. If the Sword Alliance was able to wipe out both forces so easily, they could easily wipe out the Divine Dragon Pavilion and Purple Dress House too. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“It looks like Brother Sheng Long is really nervous this time.” Gu Mo smiled but the expression on his face gradually changed to a serious one. “No matter what, the Sword Alliance has gone overboard this time and has already become a serious threat to us. Everybody will feel insecure if this continues, hence why don’t we make an appointment with the Sword Alliance Master and have a good discussion with him to resolve this matter.”

“Make an appointment with him to have a discussion?” The long-robed middle-aged man was extremely angry. “Gu Mo, what are you thinking? The Sword Alliance has already openly taken action and we only plan to make an appointment with the Alliance Master to discuss ways to resolve this matter? What a joke!”

“Is this a joke to you? What great ideas do you have then, Brother Sheng Long?” Gu Mo asked.

“Simple, the Sword Alliance is a great threat and its ambitions are clear to all of us. We cannot be sitting ducks and need to grab this chance before the Sword Alliance has full control over the Seven Absolute Palace and Blood Water Gang’s territory. The three of us should join hands and wipe out this Sword Alliance before they grow too strong,” said the long-robed middle-aged man seriously.

“I agree.” The green-clothed lady who had been quiet while sitting there in an upright manner also slightly nodded.

Both of them had a prior discussion between themselves before coming over to the Corpse Palace together.

Gu Mo smiled indifferently. “The both of you agree to directly take action and wipe out the Sword Alliance. However, have you thought about the fact that it isn’t so easy to wipe out the Sword Alliance. If I’m right, the Sword Alliance has a strong power secretly supporting them.”

“What?” The expressions on both the long-robed middle-aged man and green-clothed lady changed as they immediately turned their heads to look at Gu Mo.

Gu Mo continued, “I’m just making assumptions but there’s a huge possibility it’s true. The Sword Alliance originated from the merger of Dragon Divine Gang and Purple Beast Alliance. Both forces were third-rated forces without many resources. However, the Sword Alliance has been wantonly raising a large army after Su Han appeared and integrated both forces to form the Sword Alliance. They even offered very attractive terms.

“Third-rated forces like us offer one million Primordial Stones as payment to a Primary-level Heaven Ultimate God for a hundred years of service. On the other hand, the Sword Alliance is so rich that they offer three million Primordial Stones to any Primary-level Heaven Ultimate Gods who joins and obeys them for a hundred years. Their offer is three times that of ours!!

“They attracted many experts to join them because they had such attractive terms. This is why the Sword Alliance’s strength increased by so much within one year till the point that they could wipe out the Seven Absolute Palace and Blood Water Gang.

“The Sword Alliance can afford such high payments because they owned a huge amount of resources and had substantial financial support. However, where did these resources and financial support come from? Only relying on High-level Heaven Ultimate God Su Han is not enough. That’s why I’m certain that the Sword Alliance has a huge powerful clan supporting them from behind the scenes!

“This powerful clan might be an extremely strong second-rated force on the Danyang Continent. However, it might also be a really powerful first-rated force.”
