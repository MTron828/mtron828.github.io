Chapter 1509: A Taste Of His Own Medicine

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Even your strongest move cannot kill me. Now, it’s my turn to kill you!”

Jian Wushuang’s roar resounded across the universe. His body was like a ghost and he created eighteen shadows. In no time, he appeared in front of Universe god Xiong Fu.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Swift, violent and artful sword shadows appeared one after another. Under the influence of the Power of Spacetime, the speed of the sword shadows was extremely fast.

With Jian Wushuang’s martial art motion, he attacked Universe God Xiong Fu again and again.

“Oh no!”

Universe God Xiong Fu’s expression changed greatly and he swung his giant axes to block.

However, in terms of speed of martial art motion, he was unable to keep up and he was pushed back by Jian Wushuang in no time.

Jian Wushuang’s sword light attacked one after another and Universe God Xiong Fu used every ounce of his strength to block them. However, Jian Wushuang would find openings during a few instances and struck Universe God Xiong Fu with his Sword Principles.

If one or two strokes struck him, he would not be too concerned. However, as time went by, the Sword Principles that landed on his body continued to increase. No matter how strong his defense was, he would be unable to take so many attacks.

“I have to escape as soon as possible, if not I will really be in danger!”

Universe God Xiong Fu understood this point and he looked for an opportunity to escape immediately.

However, it was a pity… Jian Wushuang’s Blaze Quicksand Gourd’s territory was present and he had also used the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood. Hence, his speed would be many times faster than Universe God Xiong Fu’s. Even if Universe God Xiong Fu were to use all his tricks, he would be unable to shake Jian Wushuang off.

Jian Wushuang continued to attack time and again. He struck Universe God Xiong Fu’s body repeatedly and caused his injuries to increase unceasingly.

After some time, Jian Wushuang had over twenty swords attacking Universe God Xiong Fu’s body head-on. After twenty strokes, blood flowed out from the corners of Universe God Xiong Fu’s mouth and his body was on the verge of collapsing.

“Jian Wushuang, I admit that you are impressive. I will give you the White Blaze Fruit!” Universe God Xiong Fu shouted.

“White Blaze Fruit? Haha. After killing you, won’t the White Blaze Fruit still be mine?” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Jian Wushuang, you are too much!” Universe God Xiong Fu was extremely furious.

“You said it yourself. In this world, abilities earn you respect. Since my abilities are stronger than yours, even if I go over the line, what can you do?” Jian Wushuang sneered, “Cut the crap, die!”

“Damn you!” Universe God Xiong Fu cursed loudly. At the same time, he was struggling against Jian Wushuang madly.

He could only struggle.

Escape. It was impossible for him to escape!

Fight. The speed of Jian Wushuang’s martial art motion had pushed him back completely and did not give him any chance to counter-attack. He could only allow Jian Wushuang’s Sword Principles to strike him repeatedly, making his injuries more fatal.

As for going all out… He had already tried going all out. Using his strength to stop his motion and even unleashing his strongest move. However, he was still unable to do anything against Jian Wushuang.

In such a situation, what awaited him was death.

“No, no!”

Universe God Xiong Fu roared madly. He had already sensed death approaching him. Although he was struggling with all his might, he still had no way out.

He could only look on as the number of injuries on his body continued to increase, his body gradually reaching its limit and finally… collapse completely!

Bam!

With a low, deep voice, Universe God Xiong Fu’s life came to an end and he stopped breathing. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang stood in the void. As he looked at Universe God Xiong Fu’s body, his eyes filled with coldness.

“Long Ya had given you the White Blaze Fruit just now. However, you still wanted to kill him. And now, I am merely letting you have a taste of your own medicine. Hence, you cannot blame me. You can only blame the fact that you deserve to die!” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself. After that, he swung his hand and plundered Universe God Xiong Fu’s Qian Kun Ring as well as all his treasures.

While plundering his treasures, Jian Wushuang took a look quickly and he could not help but be amazed.

Universe God Xiong Fu was indeed a top expert who ranked ninth on the Universe God ranking list. He had quite a number of treasures on him.

All the pieces of armor that he wore were Chaos Unique Treasures that were of the level of a Real God. Even those two giant axes of his were Chaos Unique Treasures of the level of a Real God. Hence, it was no wonder that his strength was so powerful. However, it was a pity. With the death of Universe God Xiong Fu, all the treasures on him, including the White Blaze Fruit, had fallen into the hands of Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang.”

A voice could be heard. Long Ya who was recovering his Divine Power at a void far away had come over.

As he looked at Universe God Xiong Fu’s body, which had fallen to the ground, Long Ya’s face was filled with astonishment, “You… you actually killed Universe God Xiong Fu? That’s a super expert ranked ninth on the Universe God ranking list!”

“Ranked ninth?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and he wore an indifferent smile.

Universe God Xiong Fu was indeed worthy of being ranked ninth on the Universe God ranking list. His abilities were certainly powerful.

However, on the basis of the Reincarnation Doctrine, Jian Wushuang had managed to comprehend a small bit of the Power of Spacetime. Hence, at the moment, he definitely had the fighting capabilities to get into the top ten of the Universe God ranking list.

Comparing real fighting capabilities, he was not very different from Universe God Xiong Fu. Even if he were stronger than Universe God Xiong Fu, he was only slightly stronger.

However, the key point was that Jian Wushuang had overpowered Universe God Xiong Fu!

“I cannot say that I overpowered him. Instead, it’s my martial art motion that is too strange and frightening. I reckon that most of the experts, including the Universe Gods on the Universe God ranking list, could only take a beating if they were to come across my martial art motion. The only exceptions are the Universe Gods who honed their martial art motions to an extremely high level as well and are able to match my speed,” Jian Wushuang giggled.

Universe God Xiong Fu had died in an oppressed manner.

He was definitely not weaker than Jian Wushuang by much. However, as he was unable to keep up with the speed of Jian Wushuang’s martial art motion, he could only take a beating continuously and defend continuously during the fight. Moreover, he was unable to block the attacks completely. Hence, he had died.

“Long Ya, how is the recovery of your Divine Power?” Jian Wushuang looked toward Long Ya.

“The effects of the elixirs that you gave me are not bad. I have already recovered ten percent of my Divine Power. Although I am unable to participate in a big battle, I will be fine if I am just moving around,” Long Ya said.

“That’s good,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head. At that moment, he realized that a shadow was dashing over from the void that was not too far away.

“It’s Xuan Yi,” Jian Wushuang revealed a smile.

When they received Lei Chao’s message that Long Ya was being pursued, both Jian Wushuang and Xuan Yi hurried over at their fastest speed.

However, as Jian Wushuang was closer, he would naturally arrive earlier. As for Xuan Yi, he only managed to arrive at that moment.

“Jian Wushuang, Long Ya, are both of you all right?” Xuan Yi appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and Long Ya.

“I am all right. I am lucky that Jian Wushuang arrived in the nick of time,” Long Ya said.

“Ok,” Xuan Yi noticed the big pile of bodies on the ground, especially Universe God Xiong Fu’s body.

“That’s… Universe God Xiong Fu?” Xuan Yi stared.

“That is indeed Universe God Xiong Fu. However, he is dead now. He was killed by Jian Wushuang,” Long Ya said.

“What?” Xuan Yi looked at Jian Wushuang incredulously.

“All right, let’s not talk about this now. Let’s leave this place. That fight just now was not small; quite a number of Universe Gods around the area are looking,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Understood.”

Long Ya and Xuan Yi nodded their heads simultaneously. After that, the three of them left at once.
