Chapter 5211: One Man Shaking Ten Thousand Immortals

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Hmph, a tier 5 Emperor who only achieved his status through the use of an

Eternal Treasure. Together, we can suppress him; there’s nothing to fear.”

Most of these individuals agreed to the plan primarily because the indigenous Emperor possessed too many treasures, treasures plentiful enough to make them all covetous. Although he was a native Emperor who hadn’t ventured beyond this continent, he possessed the most complete ancient heritage and not just one but several Eternal Treasures that even tier 5 Emperors coveted.

Such a vast treasure trove naturally stirred the envy of tens of thousands of Emperors from the Original Universe. If they could seize these indigenous Emperors, their trip wouldn’t be in vain.

Buzz!

“Attack! ”

The power of the Eternal Tower erupted, a ferocious aura sweeping across the entire continent.

Several peak-level Emperors leaped into the air, their figures expanding to towering heights.

Tens of thousands of Emperors formed a majestic formation, sitting under the Eternal Tower, continuously channeling their power into the tower. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

If Eternal Treasures corresponded to Grand Yan Immortals, then innate Eternal Treasures corresponded to Emperors. The Eternal Treasure corresponded to the peak existence within the river of time and space.

The universe might collapse, time might recur, but Eternal Treasures would never perish. In the eyes of Emperors, its power was infinite.

The combined power of ten thousand Emperors infused into the Eternal Tower, causing it to radiate an unprecedented brilliance.

“What!

The indigenous Emperors were clearly shocked by this scene. Although they possessed ancient heritage, the difference in numbers was too vast. While they had tier 5 Emperors, they might find it difficult to contend with the towering treasure before them in the current situation.

This power was too overwhelming. Except for the Lord God, this was the second time they had experienced such suffocating might.

A myriad of rainbow lights stood like the pillars of heaven.

“Eternal Treasure, to suppress all the insignificant beings!” Demon Lord Fengyu’s black robe fluttered in the wind, her exceptional figure graceful like a deity. As her words fell, the immense power of the Eternal Tower pressed down upon the indigenous Emperors.

This was an attempt to directly suppress the tier 5 Emperor with the Eternal Treasure.

Without relying on the treasure, it was unrealistic for these tier 4 peak Emperors to try to besiege and kill the tier 5 Emperor who possessed the Eternal Treasure.

The difference between the tier 4 and 5 was simply too vast; relying solely on numerical superiority was utterly impractical.

To suppress, or even kill, a tier 5 Emperor, they had to rely on powerful treasures, formations, tactics, and various methods that could merge the strengths of tens of thousands of Emperors. Only then could they contend with a tier 5 Emperor.

A tremendous force of attraction suddenly struck. The tier 5 Emperor found it somewhat difficult to resist, and the other native Emperors fared even worse, transforming into streams of light swallowed into the interior of the Eternal Tower.

This move played directly into their hands, making the tier 5 Emperor quite a headache. These Emperors were not his subordinates; they were all disciples and descendants of the Lord God. Now that they were all suppressed, he couldn’t even save them in time.

These inheritors had gone too far, thoroughly infuriating him.

“You are challenging the gods!” the tier 5 Emperor roared.

The tier 5 Emperor forcefully stabilized his figure, slowly raising a clenched fist that caused ripples to spread throughout the void.

“Stop it!’

Boom!

A fist shadow that shook heaven and earth appeared, directly smashing the Eternal Tower millions of miles away.

The powerful Emperors presiding over the Eternal Tower were shaken in their chests, spewing out blood.

As the controller of the Eternal Tower, Demon Lord Fengyu suffered even more severe backlash. That punch, even through the Eternal Tower, left her severely wounded.

Was this the strength of a tier 5 Emperor?

Or was it that the tier 5 Emperor with the Eternal Treasure was just too strong, capable of single-handedly challenging myriad immortals?

“Fengyu, what do we do?”

“This person is too strong, beyond our expectations. He definitely has the Eternal Treasure that amplifies his origin source.”

Demon Lord Fengyu snorted coldly, glancing at everyone and saying, “What? Are you scared already, right at the beginning?”

“Continue!”

Now that they were all inside the Eternal Tower, there was no way to stop them. These people all cursed Demon Lord Fengyu for being crazy.

“A bunch of timid people, yet they still think they can obtain great opportunities!” Fengyu sneered inwardly.

Just a bit of injury and they were already considering retreating. They had been so arrogant and domineering in the Original Universe for so long, but now they had become so afraid of death.

Throughout their lives, they never achieved tier 5 strength of Emperor, let alone reaching the peak of the universe.

Fengyu had gained some insight now. No wonder Qishen Temple looked down on them. Grand Yan Immortals and Yan Immortals were undergoing trials, while they, the Emperors, were left in the Bloodthirst Continent.

This indicated that Qishen Temple never considered them true trial participants. They were just waiting for other Emperors. Even if everyone gathered, they would probably be dismissed with meager rewards.

Hoping this group of people would reach the peak of the universe was futile. It would be better to cultivate Yan Immortals and Grand Yan Immortals anew.

Not only would it be easier to control, but cultivating their own people meant Qishen Temple would have some certainty.

These Emperors were different. They had been noble for too long. Subjecting them to hardship wouldn’t be so easy.

Just look at these Emperors now; they couldn’t wait any longer. They had started to stir.

Whoosh!

Above the Bloodthirst Continent, a rift appeared in the void, and a sturdy man in a green armor emerged from it.

Returning to the main camp, Long Yi noticed the numerous Emperors below and shook his head in resignation.

Swish!

“Brother Long, forgive my late arrival,” said the newcomer. He was the supreme being of the Original Universe, ‘Shang% who mastered the Ultimate Dao.

Shang had an ordinary appearance, but the aura of destruction exuding from him made people palpitate with fear.

“No offense taken. 1 apologize for my lack of hospitality,” Long Yi said politely. He knew that True Spirit valued Shang greatly, hence the extreme courtesy.

A being with the potential to grasp the origin source of the universe!

Mastering the universe’s origin source made one the ruler of the universe, the Universe Master. Within Qishen Temple, Universe Masters could rank alongside the Lord Gods, equal in status to True Spirit.

Now that Shang had received benefits from Qishen Temple, even if he didn’t settle there, he would be given an honorary position in the future. He was essentially internally endorsed. Long Yi naturally showed great respect; after all, this person might not only be a colleague but also a potential superior.

“Their state of mind is too poor, too impatient. Even if they were given heritage, it would be wasted,” Shang remarked, observing the battles below. He was especially disappointed to see Chishui’s flushed face.

Strong individuals of the same era had been left far behind by him.

Among the tier 5 Emperors, he was a unique existence. All the other tier 5 Emperors in the universe had gone to the River of Time, and many of them never returned. These Emperors knew the secrets of the Original Universe. As long as they didn’t produce a Universe Master, they would be devoured by the Forbidden Demon Lord, a taboo they were too afraid to resist.

They had even given up their homeland. Life had no origin for them anymore; only the journey back was incomplete.

To become an Emperor required completeness, and to vie for the universe required even more integrity..
