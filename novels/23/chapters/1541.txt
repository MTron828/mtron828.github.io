Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Why are you anxious? I’m not asking you to kill him now but later on when you enhance your power and have the capability to,” Real God Wu Bei stole a glance at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang let out a breath of relief and immediately replied solemnly, “Real God Wu Bei, I can promise you that I will figure out a way to kill Demon Heart Kingdom Monarch on your behalf as soon as I have the ability to. If I were to not reach that level ever, you couldn’t blame me.”

“Don’t worry. If you were to never reach that kind of level or if you passed away, I naturally couldn’t pin the blame on you. Plus, at your current level, you are really far off that level. Forget about the other factors, it is still unknown whether you can become Real God successfully. After all, you have one last Inverse Cultivation Test to go through,” Real God Wu Bei sighed.

“The last Inverse Cultivation Test is the toughest test as an inverse cultivator. Although you are quite powerful, the possibility of you passing the test is still not high.”

Jian Wushuang’s pupils contracted as he heard that remark.

“Real God Wu Bei, you’re an inverse cultivator at the stage of Real God. In other words, it meant that you passed through all three Inverse Cultivation Tests. Can you tell me what the last Inverse Cultivation Test about?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Inverse Cultivation Test, the toughest test for an inverse cultivator.

The previous two Inverse Cultivation Tests that Jian Wushuang had been through had brought him to the brink of death.

Naturally, for the third Inverse Cultivation Test, the toughest test, Jian Wushuang was worried himself.

“I can’t tell what the third Inverse Cultivation Test is exactly. but the moment I expose the Inverse Cultivation Test, it will become entirely different,” Real God Wu Bei explained, “However, I can tell you that when it comes to my third Inverse Cultivation Test, everything that I went through still strikes fear in me now. Plus, because of the Inverse Cultivation Test, it caused a drastic change in my temperament. Hence, the people in Eternal Chaotic World treat me as a madman.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows were tightly knitted.

The third Inverse Cultivation Test had made Real God Wu Bei so terrified and his temperament underwent a drastic change?

“Just how scary was the test?” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Real God Wu Bei didn’t explain much but extended his hand and took out a grey stone bead.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang looked and his gaze instantly fixed onto the grey stone bead.

He wasn’t unfamiliar with the grey stone bead. When he had received the Heavenly Creation Skill previously, it was contained in the grey stone bead.

Jian Wushuang had yet to find out what material the stone bead was made out of.

“The inverse cultivation skill of Real God level, also the sixth step of inverse cultivation, is stored in the stone bead,” Real God Wu Bei smiled and passed the grey stone bead to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took the grey stone bead and swept his soul power over it. He was delighted.

“The Sixth Step of Cultivation Strength!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were twinkling with joy.

“I only have the Sixth Step of Cultivation Strength. I cultivated to the extreme limit of a Real God with this skill when I was live. However, as I couldn’t get my hands on the Seventh Step of Cultivation Strength, which is the one that equals the skill of an Almighty, I have trapped it there. I didn’t even break through when I died,” Real God Wu Bei sighed.

“Even Real God Wu Bei couldn’t find the Seventh Step of Cultivation Strength? Could it be that?the Seventh Step of Cultivation Strength never existed?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“That’s not it. I know who carries the Seventh Step of Cultivation Strength but that person… He’s too aloof. Forget about me, many Almighties who are much stronger than I am aren’t even qualified to see him. I naturally don’t stand a chance. I don’t even have the chance to get in touch with him. How can I ask him to pass me that skill?” Real God Wu Bei smiled bitterly.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang nodded in silence.

“Jian Wushuang, if you were to reach the level I was at before I died one day, you could ask any Almighty who is stronger. Any Almighty who is strong will know who has the Seventh Step of Cultivation Strength,” Real God Wu Bei asked.

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang understood.

Then, Real God Wu Bei flipped his palm and two dark, mysterious rings appeared in his hand.

“Senior Wu Bei, what’s this?” Jian Wushuang looked at the two rings suspiciously.

“These two rings contain a White Blaze Fruit Tree each. I gave God Destroying King one just now for him to leave first. Hence, I did some tricks,” Real God Wu Bei said.

“A White Blaze Fruit Trees in these two rings? How is it possible?” Jian Wushuang was amazed.

He could tell that the black rings should be Qian Kun rings.

Although there was storage space in a Qian Kun ring, it was used to keep various kinds of treasures. However, treasures were treasures, they were dead objects. But White a Blaze Fruit Tree was a true living thing.

It possessed life-force.

In Eternal Chaotic World, whatever life-force, such as human cultivators, exotic beasts, they were alive, how could they be kept in Qian Kun ring?

Even the Natural Treasures had to be plucked and cut off from their life-force before storing them in Qian Kun ring.

But then, the two Qian Kun ring…

“Why? You find it unbelievable, right?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Real God Wu Bei looked at him with a smile, “When I first received these few rings, I was astonished too. However, such a Qian Kun ring existed and it was made by a superior personally, back when the Almighties were fighting over the White Blaze Fruit Tree and had an insane fight. The reason they couldn’t call the match was that the procedure was very complicated to maintain the White Blaze Fruit Tree’s life-force when they wanted to transplant it.

“But it was different for me.”

“I took the entire plot of land that cultivated the sapling of White Blaze Fruit into the ring while the Almighties could only watch me.”

“No wonder Real God Wu Bei, you can take away the sapling of White Blaze Fruit so openly before the Almighties. This is why, huh?” Jian Wushuang complimented and then asked, “You said that these few rings were made by a superior. Would this superior be the one that helped you nurture the other two White Blaze Fruit Trees?”

“Yes, it’s him. Actually, not only the ring and the nurturing of White Blaze Fruit Tree, even the restriction in my cave is set up by him. Because of the existence of the restriction, the Almighties outside can’t enter,” Real God Wu Bei smiled.

“Even the restriction is set up by the superior? Who exactly is this superior?” Jian Wushuang asked curiously.

“I don’t know his exact identity, nor do I know his actual power. I only know that he is very good at making weapons, formation and many realm techniques. Even many Almighties who specialized in weapon-making and formation couldn’t be compared to him favorably. He is definitely one of the most mysterious people I’ve seen all my life,” Real God Wu Bei said.

Jian Wushuang was stunned when he heard it.
