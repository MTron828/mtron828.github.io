Chapter 839: Blood Eagle Armor

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“All of them were killed?”

“The second master of the Xia Clan had a high status, so he should have had some special lifesaving tricks. But it says that Xia Yan used his lifesaving item, but was still killed by Jian Wushuang.”

As Commander Hong read the information, he could not help but sigh.

The Xia Clan was considered a magnate in the Tang of the East.

Even the Imperial House of Tang of the East was in awe of it.

Jian Wushuang had killed Xia Yan. It was terrible enough to provoke the Xia Clan.

“However, both Blood Mountain and Asura, their origins are clear. Although they have a great grudge against the Xia and Dongyan Clans, it has nothing to do with the Imperial House, so they’re acceptable.”

Commander Hong carefully checked the information about the two candidates, and then ordered, “Accept Blood Mountain and Asura.”

The scarlet-robed elder who had met Jian Wushuang set out to pick up the two men.

Three figures rushed across the azure sky.

Jian Wushuang and Asura followed the elder with a flicker of expectation in their hearts.

They had learned about the Blood Eagle Guard, but they had never actually been there before.

The scarlet-robed elder led them into an ancient forest. They crossed several Restrictions before they finally saw a large military camp.

This was the Blood Eagle Guard’s secret hideaway.

Instead of tents, they had built numerous towering residences and courtyards.

In the Blood Eagle Guard’s lair, each Blood Eagle Guard had his own mansion or courtyard.

The scarlet-robed elder landed on the ground with Jian Wushuang and Asura.

“Here you are, your ID tokens.” The scarlet-robed elder handed a bronze token to each of them.

The scarlet tokens were engraved with a lifelike bloody eagle. They looked very mighty and domineering.

“This token certifies your identity as a Blood Eagle Guard, but unless it is absolutely critical, don’t expose your identity while doing a task outside, understand?” said the scarlet-robed elder.

“OK.”

Jian Wushuang and Asura both nodded. They quickly received the tokens and then used their blood to bind them.

“Both of you have just joined the Blood Eagle Guard, so I will give you a brief introduction of our organization.” The scarlet-robed elder started talking about it as he walked forward with the newcomers.

“Since both of you are from the Royal Guard, you have definitely heard a lot about the Blood Eagle Guard, so I don’t need to talk more about what the Blood Eagle Guard is responsible for. I’d like to tell you some rules.

“First of all, the Blood Eagle Guard has a rigid hierarchy. Blood Eagle Guards are divided into three levels: One-Clawed, Two-Clawed, and Three-Clawed. More claws means higher level, so Three-Clawed Blood Eagle Guards rank highest among our guards.”

“From One-Claw to Three-Claw?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

When he was still in the Ancient World, there were Golden Dragon Guards in the Tianzong Dynasty whose ranks were marked by “Claw”.

However, Blood Eagle Guards and Golden Dragon Guards were completely different.

The scarlet-robed elder continued, “You have just joined and have not yet accepted any tasks, so it is natural that both of you are One-clawed Blood Eagle Guards. In the future, once you’ve accepted enough tasks and obtained brilliant battle achievements, you’ll be promoted to Two-clawed Blood Eagle Guards.

“In addition, the Blood Eagle Guard belongs to the Royal Guard, but our treatment is completely different from Dragon Guards’.

“The Blood Eagle Guard is a trump card for the Imperial House, so we’re more important than ordinary Dragon Guards. Each Blood Eagle Guard can receive the best training from the Imperial House. In addition to privileges, you can enjoy three types of special treatment after joining the Blood Eagle Guard.

“Three types of special treatment?”?Jian Wushuang thought with a hint of expectation.

“The first is the Blood Eagle Armor,” the scarlet-robed elder said as he waved his hand. Two scarlet suits of armor embroidered with a blood eagle pattern appeared in front of them.

“Armor?”

Jian Wushuang frowned.

“A suit of armor is regarded as superb treatment?”

“First you bind it to yourself and then put it on.” The scarlet-robed elder did not explain much.

Jian Wushuang and Asura followed his order without hesitation. After binding it to himself, Jian Wushuang immediately perceived its peculiarity.

“This is...”

Jian Wushuang put on his Blood Eagle Armor and clearly sensed that this armor had the incredible defensive ability, much better than the Gold-dragon Armor that he had obtained in the Royal Guard. This armor was not only useful for defense, it also improved offensive power.

Thinking of this, Jian Wushuang clenched his right fist; an explosive force was transmitted from the armor. Obviously, his strength had improved.

“How is that possible?”?Jian Wushuang thought in shock,?“Armor that can actually enhance the offensive power?”

It was no surprise that the armor had defensive capabilities. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Extremely high-level armor could have heaven-defying defensive power.

However, Jian Wushuang had never heard of armor being able to help increase offensive power.

“It looks like you both feel it.”

The scarlet-robed elder smiled when he saw their shock. “The reason the Blood Eagle Armor is considered one of the three types of special treatment is that it not only has powerful defense ability, it also helps increase its owner’s offensive power.

“Only the Imperial House of Tang of the East possesses Blood Eagle Armors. Each piece of armor is implanted with a special restriction at a huge price. When you launch an attack, the inside restriction will be activated to greatly improve your offensive power!

“Of course, both of you are just One-clawed Blood Eagle Guards, and what you get is first-rank armor. If you progress to Two-clawed or Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards, you will gain the second-rank or third-rank armor. Then your offensive power will be even greater.

“From what I understand, the third-rank armor can help double a person’s offensive power!”
