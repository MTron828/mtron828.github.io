Chapter 1468: Expose

Blood Emperor knew clearly just how scared Heartless King was in terms of consciousness.

Her consciousness, including her manipulation method of consciousness, wasn’t something any ordinary Real God could be compared to.

That was also the reason he invited Heartless King over.

“Can you definitely find him?”

“Hehe, Blood Emperor, you made it sound so easy.”

Heartless King shook her head and smiled, “A range of a billion miles. If I were only to sweep the range with consciousness, it’d be easy. However, Jian Wushuang is obviously good at hiding so I have to rely on consciousness to probe inch by inch and you also know that the coverage of consciousness is restrained in Sky Sword Prison. Even if it was me, I’d need more than half a month to probe inch by inch over a hundred thousand mile range.

“Now, you’re asking about a billion miles. How long will it take?”

Sweeping the range with consciousness and probing inch by inch were totally different.

If one were only sweeping the range with consciousness, it’d be easy. If a real God wasn’t restrained, their consciousness could easily sweep a hundred thousand miles. A range of a billion miles could be swept in a short time.

However, probing inch by inch would require using consciousness to probe every corner within the search range. It would be much more difficult than sweeping the range with consciousness. Naturally, the time required would be much longer.

The reason Jian Wushuang said that Heartless King’s ability to search for experts was weaker than his was because Jian Wushuang lit up his Soul Power. He spread his Soul Power and he could cover each corner of the entire area. Anyone within the range of his Soul Power would reveal themselves.

Although Heartless King’s consciousness was strong, she couldn’t do that.

If some experts were to hide themselves, she had to spend a long time and great effort on probing inch by inch to find them.

That was the reason why Heartless King couldn’t fulfill the conditions to reach Sky Sword Prison after so many years.

In the one billion mile range, probing inch by inch was actually very difficult for Heartless King.

“Blood Emperor, I’m afraid I won’t be able to help,” Heartless King said coldly.

Blood Emperor creased his eyebrows slightly then said, “Two Evil Soul Pearls, how about that?”

“Evil Soul Pearls?” The Heartless King was surprised but she immediately turned to look at Blood Emperor, “Blood Emperor, you are really people from that force, huh?”

“Regardless of where I’m from, we are now prisoners in Sky Sword Prison. Aren’t we?” Blood Emperor said.

“True,” Heartless King nodded and smiled, “Three Evil Soul Perks and I’ll find Jian Wushuang for you.”

“Three?” Blood Emperor found it a pain.

Evil Soul Pearl was Holocaust Sect’s exclusive treasure. It required extremely great effort and a high price to pay in order to refine one.

Evil Soul Pearl was a great help for consciousness.

Although Blood Emperor was an expert in Holocaust Sect, he didn’t have many Evil Soul Pearls. But then, he had to take out three pearls at once.

“Although Evil Soul Pearl is precious, it is nothing compared to Blood-killing Plate Armor!” Blood Emperor squinted his eyes and then nodded, “Three Evil Soul Pearl, deal.”

Then, Blood Emperor passed a Qian Kun ring to Heartless King, “There’s one Evil Soul Pearl here. The other two I’ll give you after I kill Jian Wushuang.”

“Sure,” Heartless King smiled faintly and examined it.

There was a boundless consciousness that spread out from Heartless King and covered every single corner within range.

Heartless King had already started probing for Blood Emperor within a one billion mile range.

However, even for Heartless King, it wasn’t easy to find Jian Wushuang within the one billion mile range. Even if she didn’t rest, it would require a long time.

In the blink of an eye, it had been seventy years.

In the void, Heartless King was still probing inch by inch with consciousness while Blood Emperor followed next to Heartless King.

“In this hundred thousand mile range, he isn’t here. Let’s head to the next area,” Heartless King said.

Then, Heartless King and Blood Emperor immediately came to the next void.

“For seventy years, we already searched through half of the one billion mile range. If Jian Wushuang were to really be within the one billion miles range, we will be able to find him very soon.

Heartless King said and then spread her consciousness again.

At that very moment, in the underground below Heartless King and Blood Emperor, in the depth of the cave dwelling, Jian Wushuang was seated quietly as he comprehended the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation.

“After so many years, I’ve comprehended the second painting thoroughly. Next up, the third painting,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

There was a total of nine images in the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation. Based on Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of Reincarnation Doctrine, he could only comprehend the first three.

He had already comprehended the first two among the three. Jian Wushuang reckoned that if he were to comprehend the third one as well, his comprehension of Reincarnation Doctrine would be qualified to pass the first level of Doctrine Palace. By then, he didn’t have to be afraid of Blood Emperor either.

“The third is obviously more profound compared to the two previous ones…” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

But suddenly… There was a boundless consciousness spreading across. Naturally, Jian Wushuang’s cave dwelling was within range too.

“There’s experts here to disturb me with consciousness again? It seems like Blood Emperor has yet to give up.”

Jian Wushuang smoked as he spread his Soul Power. He wanted to see which experts released consciousness.

Just as he looked clearly with his Soul Power, Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave.

“It’s Blood Emperor!”

“And the other person…”

The person was in a white robe, looking extremely holy. On top of that, her consciousness was extremely shocking.

Jian Wushuang immediately recognized the person.

“It’s Heartless King!”

“Blood Emperor invited Heartless King over?”

Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave.

The hiding method that King of Venomous Worms passed down to him had no problem if he were to use it to deal with an ordinary Real God. Even if the Real Gods’ swept their consciousness across him, they would never notice his existence.

However, it was Heartless King who came. She was a Real God who was good at consciousness attacks. Among Real Gods in Sky Sword Prison, she was the strongest in terms of consciousness strength.

Jian Wushuang wasn’t confident in himself that his hiding method was still sufficient before Heartless King.

“I hope she doesn’t notice me.”

Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows tightly, trying his best to conceal his aura to his maximum. However, he also considered the worst situation and made plans for it.

Heartless King was probing inch by inch with her consciousness. Very soon, she found Jian Wushuang in the cave dwelling.

“Mm?”

Heartless King moved and locked her fierce consciousness power on Jian Wushuang.

“Found him,” Heartless King revealed a smile.

However, in the cave dwelling in the depths of the underground, Jian Wushuang’s face instantly changed.

“She found me!”

“Hurry up and run!”

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang who made a plan for the worst conditions, instantly started running away.

…
