Chapter 1698: Hall Master

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Don’t worry, it’s a good thing.”

Hall Master Yuan smiled, “When you reached the fighting power of Eternal Real God, you naturally became one of the deacon elderlies in Lineage of Star. Then, you injured Sir God Qian Lan. In terms of power, you should not be any weaker than an ordinary Almighty. According to the rules in Lineage of Star, only one with fighting power of an Almighty can become a Hall Master!”

“Hall Master?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“In Lineage of Star, the highest position is naturally Palace Master, followed by the three Hall Masters. Among the three Hall Masters, besides myself, the other two are Almighties,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Jian Wushuang’s face grew strange when he heard that.

The fighting power of an Almighty could qualify one to become Hall Master, but Hall Master Yuan obviously wasn’t an Almighty.

Hall Master Yuan seemed to see Jian Wushuang’s thoughts. He said, “Don’t look at me like that. I can become Hall Master because of a unique factor. You’ll find out about it later on.”

Jian Wushuang shrugged but didn’t ask.

“Return to Sword Star and get ready. After some time, I will throw a banquet for you. The birth of a new Hall Master is very meaningful to Lineage of Star. We can’t take this lightly. I’ll have all the experts of Lineage of Star to hurry their journey back to participate in the banquet. Then, I will announce it personally,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Alright,” Jian Wushuang nodded and didn’t reject. “Yeah, Lei Chao had been wandering in the Sixth Lair. Will he return?”

“I’m not sure for now, but the possibility isn’t high,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Jian Wushuang was quiet. Then, he returned to Sword Star.

There wasn’t much that had changed on Sword Star. All the maidservants were still there but Qiu Yue had left Lineage of Star a while back to wander outside.

Jian Wushuang stayed in Sword Star as he waited.

For the rest of the time, there were experts of Lineage of Star coming back one after another. Some came back from Thunderbolt Island, some came back from the Eighth Lair, and there were some that come back from all over Eternal Chaotic World.

Just like Hall Master Yuan had described, the birth of a new Hall Master was a major event to Lineage of Star.

After all, an Almighty was extremely important to any force in Eternal Chaotic World and was one of the people to count on. Every extra person would increase the overall power tremendously.

Lineage of Star, as one of the great forces in Eternal Chaotic World, had had three Almighties in commanding positions previously but now there were four.

Regardless of if it was experts of Real God level or disciples of Universe God level in Lineage of Star, no one wasn’t thrilled when they found out about the news.

In the blink of an eye, a month’s time had passed.

The banquet started as usual. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The higher-ups in Lineage of Star, besides those who couldn’t rush back in short notice, almost all of them were present.

The banquet was extremely busy and there were a few lofty thrones arranged side by side.

Besides Jian Wushuang and Hall Master Yuan, there were another two figures seated there.

“Jian Wushuang, let me introduce. This is Sir God Shi Yun, who is a big-name figure in Sanctuary Alliance,” Hall Master Yuan said as he pointed at a handsome, middle-aged man who kept short hair with great height and powerful build.

“Big-name figure? Don’t listen to him. Jian Wushuang, I’m Nie Yun. You can call me by my name or just call me Hall Master Nie Yun. As for Sir God Shi Yun, it’s just a title,” the tall and sturdy middle-aged man, Nie Yun, said with a hearty smile.

“Greetings, Hall Master Nie Yun,” Jian Wushuang behaved humbly.

He knew long ago that besides Hall Master Yuan, there had been another two Hall Masters in Lineage of Star.

However, the other two Hall Masters had never involved themselves with worldly affairs. Hence, he only saw them that day.

“This is Hall Master Gu Xin. The others refer to her as Sir God Gu Xin,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Hall Master Gu Xin,” Jian Wushuang greeted humbly.

“Greetings,” the extremely enchanting woman, who looked like a fairy from a painting, Hall Master Gu Xin, said. Her voice was captivating too, “In Eternal Chaotic World, forget about the Almighties, even many Real Gods have titles. Jian Wuhsuang, you have the fighting power of an Almighty now. Are you not giving yourself one?”

“Title?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Hall Master Yuan and Hall Master Nie Yun looked towards him.

Most experts had titles that belonged to them.

Jian Wushuang had met many Real God that had their own titles. The same went for the Almighties.

The titles were many and varied but all had their unique points. Some named themselves according to the divine weapon that they were good with, or unique skill, or doctrine that they comprehended. Some named themselves casually.

“A long time ago, when I was still back in my hometown, I was pathetically weak but I still received the title of Sword Emperor,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Sword Emperor?” The surrounding three Hall Masters exchanged a look and nodded faintly.

The title was given by oneself casually. It was as well without it as with it. Jian Wushuang was good with swords and he had the fighting power of a Sir God. It was normal that he would be referred to as Sword Emperor.

The banquet was extremely crowded and busy. There were many Real Gods that got up to toast Jian Wushuang occasionally. After all, the main focus of the banquet was Jian Wushuang.

During the banquet, Jian Wushuang was chatting casually with the three Hall Masters next to him. They had set up prohibitions around them so the Real Gods beneath couldn’t listen to the content of their conversations.

“Jian Wushuang, I heard that you made Soaring Heaven King Palace suffer a great loss and you gained an abundant benefit from them?” Hall Master Nie Yun looked at him.

“It did happen,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Haha, well done! Soaring Heaven King Palace has always been aggressive and barbaric. I was upset with them long ago.” There was a chilly gleam in Hall Master Nie Yun’s eyes.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang looked at Hall Master Nie Yun in shock.

“Jian Wushuang, you might not know this but Hall Master Nie Yun once had an issue with Soaring Heaven King Palace. He once fought against Soaring Heaven King Palace but then he suffered a minor loss. This time, you vented his grievance on his behalf,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang understood.

“Humph. Soaring Heaven King Palace look down their noses down at everyone and it is a common sight. Jian Wushuang, if you fight Soaring Heaven King Palace again in the future, show no mercy. Go ahead and kill them directly,” Hall Master Nie Yun said.

“Actually I’m curious. Soaring Heaven King Palace suffered such a great loss this time. Theoretically, they should be raging with anger but why didn’t they dare to fight Lineage of Star head-on? With Soaring Heaven King Palace’s power, they totally have the capital to start a war with Lineage of Star?” Jian Wushuang asked confusedly.

He had wanted to ask that question since long ago.
