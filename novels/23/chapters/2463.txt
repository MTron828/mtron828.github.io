Chapter 2464: Breakthrough!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The atmosphere had considerably calmed down in Saint’s Tomb.

The various sects’ genius disciples were indulging in the Divine Power Ocean and absorbing as much divine power as possible.

The day slowly passed and soon it had been three months.

Two silhouettes stood next to each other on the edge of the vast Divine Power Ocean.

“Congratulations Junior Brother on your breakthrough to First-Class Divine Demon Realm,” said a smiling young man with long purple hair.

“Haha, that was pure luck. I was only one step away from First-Class Divine Demon Realm. When I tried to overcome one of the trial bridge’s tests, I learned something and met the requirements for a breakthrough. What I lacked were some divine powers. I’ve been absorbing a fair bit of divine power for the last three months, hence I attempted a breakthrough to the First-Class Divine Demon Realm and made it!” The chubby young man smiled heartily.

The Divine Power Ocean was very useful.

Besides the accumulation of divine powers, one could also attempt a breakthrough in one’s cultivation bottleneck by absorbing a large amount of divine power.

However, such breakthroughs were only applicable to First-Class Divine Demons or lower.

After all, the highest level that could be admitted into Saint’s Tomb was First-Class Divine Demons, hence First-Class Divine Demons were unable to progress to Peak Divine Demon Realm in the tomb, but Second-Class Divine Demons could try advancing into the First-Class Divine Demon Realm.

The chubby young man took advantage of the Divine Power Ocean and easily achieved First-Class Divine Demon Realm.

Both of them were chit-chatting casually while walking as they passed the area where Jian Wushuang was.

The strong turbulence waves around Jian Wushuang caught their attention.

“That is...”

“That absorption power is really quick and the waters around are choppy.”

Both of them stopped in their tracks, looked over, and immediately spotted Jian Wushuang who was in that area.

“It’s him!”

“It’s the monstrous Jian Wushuang! No wonder!”

A trace of fear flashed in their eyes.

They had seen Jian Wushuang’s mass killings with their own eyes. All the various sects’ genius disciples in the tomb had developed tremendous fear for Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang’s divine power absorption speed is too fast. If he has been going on at this pace for the past three months, then he must have acquired an incredible amount of divine power.”

“It’s strange he hasn’t broken through yet. He’s obviously still in the Chaotic Realm, isn’t he?”

Both of them were flabbergasted.

“Let him be. Jian Wushuang is indeed a large monstrous freak. Let’s not stay here,” said the purple long-haired young man.

“Yes, let’s move along.”

The two dared not delay and ‘escaped’ as quickly as possible.

They would not have been so frightened if they met someone else. Before Jian Wushuang... Jian Wushuang was already recognized as the Grim Reaper of the tomb and offended countless sects. Under such circumstances, Jian Wushuang might just kill them without any scruples if they rubbed him the wrong way.

After the two left, Jian Wushuang remained there and continued absorbing the Ancient God Divine Powers.

Exactly as what the two had seen, Jian Wushuang had been absorbing the Ancient God Divine Power at lightning speeds for three months.

Apparently, an ordinary Chaotic Realm would probably reach the upper limit in three days but Jian Wushuang was different. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He was a Perfect Chaotic Creature whereby his divine powers were limitless.

He needed a large volume of divine power to advance from the Peak Chaotic Realm to Divine Demon Realm, hence he definitely needed more divine power as compared to an ordinary Peak Chaotic Realm.

After insanely absorbing for three months, he had finally reached his power accumulation limit.

At that point, Jian Wushuang stopped absorbing the divine powers around him.

Jian Wushuang was stoked.

“I’ve reached the limit in power accumulation and there’s no possibility of any further improvement. It’s time for a breakthrough!”

Rumbling...

The boundless divine powers circulated frantically in Jian Wushuang’s body, forming a surging stream of divine power.

Under careful control, the stream of divine power pushed through the bottleneck in Jian Wushuang’s body.

The bottleneck was tough!

There was a huge gap between the Chaotic Realm and Divine Demon Realm.

Therefore, it was extremely difficult for a breakthrough from the Chaotic Realm to Divine Demon Realm as the requirements were extremely hard to meet.

Nonetheless, for Jian Wushuang, he had made his breakthrough and reached the Divine Demons Realm in his previous life. He was just reincarnated to once again go through his cultivation.

He had fulfilled the requirements for advancement to the Divine Demon Realm.

Not only did he fulfill the requirements, but had actually surpassed it long ago. What he lacked was just divine powers.

The divine powers in his body had also reached the breakthrough requirements, and the Divine Power Ocean around him could continuously channel support for his breakthrough.

Jian Wushuang was completely confident with his breakthrough.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The stream of divine power continuously battered the bottleneck’s barrier.

The stream of divine power collapsed after every single attack launched but Jian Wushuang immediately mustered a new stream for the next attack.

In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang had already launched nearly ten waves of attacks towards the barrier.

A crack finally appeared on the extremely tough barrier.

A small leak would sink a great ship.

The appearance of a small crack had rocked that barrier’s stability.

There were two more waves of attack next.

Rumbling...

The barrier had given way.

“Divine Demon Realm, here I come!”

Jian Wushuang was over the top.

Divine Demon Realm was the peak of his previous life’s cultivation level.

Similarly, that level was the starting point for a Perfect Chaotic Creature!

With Jian Wushuang’s breakthrough, the infinite divine power ran through every corner of his body and Jian Wushuang’s heart experienced a euphoric moment.

That was the enlivened feeling of transformation and advancement.

He could feel every cell in his body transcending which greatly improved his life rating!

Boom!

Without warning, an extremely unique and transcendent pressure emerged from Jian Wushuang.

The pressure did not come from a person’s strength or aura, but from his life rating.

The pressure erupted from Jian Wushuang and within moments it had covered everywhere across the nine heavens and ten domains.

Endless waves repetitively stirred up in the Divine Power Ocean and rolled towards Jian Wushuang. However, none of those waves had really crashed upon Jian Wushuang. It was as if the Divine Power Ocean had a soul and submitted itself at Jian Wushuang’s feet.

Divine Power Ocean was seemingly worshipping Jian Wushuang!
