Chapter 2252

All Ou

The intense fight was now not just between Jian Wushuang and Old Monster Jiao – Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai had joined forces, two versus one!Obviously Emperor Bai would not simply stand around while Jian Wushuang was fighting Old Monster Jiao.

Hua lala ~~~the golden Divine Power Sea rushed over once again, and Old Monster Jiao’s eyes turned cold.

“Get lost!” another angry roar was let out. Old Monster Jiao’s black Divine Power rolled out once again, entirely blocking the golden Divine Power Sea.

But at that moment... Xiu!

Xiu!

Xiu!

Xiu!

Xiu!

Streaks of golden light came bursting out from the surrounding golden Divine Power Sea without warning.

Those golden lights were Hong Jun Golden Swords!

Hong Jun Golden Sword was one of Jian Wushuang’s trump cards and had helped him immensely throughout the years of battle.

Its might went without saying as well.

20,000 years ago, Jian Wushuang could only manage to perform seven Hong Jun Golden Swords. But after Jian Wushuang had mastered the seventh step and learnt about the Rules of Order, he could perform nine Hong Jun Golden Swords.

Nine Hong Jun Golden Swords, to the maximum number!

The nine Hong Jun Golden Swords were hidden within the golden Divine Power Sea, under Old Monster Jiao’s radar. When it burst out, the nine Hong Jun Golden Swords were boosted with the help of spacetime rules and blasted out in unparalleled speeds.

Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Nine rings that sounded like metallic collisions were let out continuously.

The Hong Jun Golden Swords were too fast for Old Monster Jiao to block. All nine swords went through Old Monster Jiao’s holy body.

The terrifying shock went through his armour and into his holy body.

“Puu!”

Even Old Monster Jiao, against the nine Hong Jun Golden Swords, spat out a large mouthful of blood. His face instantly turned pale.

He was blasted backwards.

At that moment, Emperor Bai situated in a Void not too far away, caught a moment of opportunity.

“Punish, Destroy!”

The terrifying powers from the golden emperor’s palms were released and spread all over the land.

They were closing in on where Old Monster Jiao was.

Boundless power came pressing down on it.

Old Monster Jiao’s face instantly sank – his Scaly had died under that move.

He knew how terrifying that move was.

The golden palms seemed to be moving slowly, but its terrifying powers horrified Old Monster Jiao as well.

He began to resist it frenziedly.

Hong!

The golden emperor’s palms finally closed in.

The Void Old Monster Jiao was in was naturally crushed into bits by the palms.

“Is he dead?” Jian Wushuang looked towards the Void indifferently.

Coupling the nine Hong Jun Golden Swords and Emperor Bai’s attack, he should have been dead by now.

But in reality...

Hong!

A terrifying aura burst out from where Old Monster Jiao was.

At the same time, a thick, disgusting bloody aura was rolled out.

“What?” Jian Wushuang flinched.

“Is he not dead?” Emperor Bai was shocked as well.

They saw the figure of Old Monster Jiao rising up from the Void once again, but only now he was in a miserable state.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai realised there was another crimson secret restriction between his brows.

The terrifying bloody aura was exuded from that crimson secret restriction. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

At a Void far away from the battlefield, the Ancient Divine Demons that Jian Wushuang chased away and Chen Qi did not escape.

They had their eyes glued on that battle.

When Old Monster Jiao revealed his crimson secret restriction...

“Is the Life-Preserving Secret Restriction! From the Holy Land!” Chen Qi was shocked.

“My lord, he used the Life-Preserving Secret Restriction?”

“He can only use that five times in his life,” Old Monster Jiao’s subordinate Chu He was astonished as well.

He knew exactly what the secret restriction meant.

It was a tactic unique to the Holy Land, only used when desperate.

Even during the Ancient Era battles, against the Seven Star Divine Realm experts, Old Monster Jiao had not used his Life-Preserving Secret Restriction, but against the two elites of the current era Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang, he had no choice.

The moment he used it, it meant that he was going all out.

“ALL DIE!”

A roar rose from the battlefield. Old Monster Jiao had a frenzied look on him, his thick and bloody aura had turned into an endless blood river.

In the blink of an eye, the blood river had appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, closest to Old Monster Jiao.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes felt cold and he pulled out his Blood Mountain Sword.

A simple stab carried boundless sword essence and split the blood river apart.

The enormous blood river was instantly ripped in half by Jian Wushuang.

“Damn it!”

“Even after the Life-Preserving Secret Restriction, the restrictions on this earth are too much. I can’t even fight against that Sword Emperor!”

Old Monster Jiao gritted his teeth, but there was nothing he could do.

He had used his final trump card, but obviously that had no effect against Jian Wushuang.

“Run!” Old Monster Jiao did not hesitate.

After knowing there was no way to kill Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai, he used the added powers from the Life-Preserving Secret Restriction and tried to escape.

A crimson phantom quickly escaped towards a nearby Void from the centre of the battlefield.

“Trying to escape?” Jian Wushuang’s face sank. But shock followed.

He saw how fast the Old Monster Jiao was.

Terrifying!

“Too fast.”

“Even with my Power of Spacetime, there is no way I could catch up with him,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

It was hard for him alone to catch Old Monster Jiao.

“Emperor Bai, catch him!” Jian Wushuang shouted.
