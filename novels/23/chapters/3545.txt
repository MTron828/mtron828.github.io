Chapter 3547: Cutter Board

“The first flame tide alone has cost me more than one-thirtieth of my divine power. The flame tide behind me is even hotter and more massive. Once I’m completely sucked in, even if my divine power is vast, I might not be able to withstand it.” Jian Wushuang was shocked, he immediately burst out with his fastest speed and rushed to the side.

Although the flame tide was terrifying, its speed was actually not very fast. The first flame tide just now could not be avoided because Jian Wushuang was too close to it, but the remaining flame tide…Jian Wushuang could avoid it.

However, just as he was about to break out of the range of the flame tide, a sudden red light attracted Jian Wushuang’s attention.

“What’s that?” Jian Wushuang looked at the red light in front of him.

Although it was surrounded by red flames because of the flame tide, the red light was very eye-catching in the midst of the flames.

“Whatever it is, take it away.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand and caught the red light while moving to the side.

However, the moment his right hand touched the red light, an incredible scorching power was transmitted directly from the red light.

Almost in an instant, Jian Wushuang’s right hand burned up.

“This?” Jian Wushuang was shocked. Although his right hand was burning up, he still endured the intense pain to grab the red light and put it into his interspatial ring.

After doing all this, Jian Wushuang escaped from the range of the flame tide as fast as he could.

Whoosh!

The flame tide was still rolling up crazily, and its range was getting larger and larger. It swept out in a vast and mighty manner.

However, Jian Wushuang had already arrived in the void outside the flame tide. He watched the flame tide crazily sweep around, but the flame tide could no longer affect him.

However, at this moment, Jian Wushuang did not pay attention to the flame tide. Instead, he was checking his divine body.

“My divine power was consumed by one-fifth at that moment?” Jian Wushuang was completely stunned at this moment.

When the first flame tide came, he had lost more than one-thirtieth of his divine power. Although he was a little surprised, he could understand.

After all, it was a flame tide that could make people’s faces change. It was normal for it to have such erosive power.

However, Jian Wushuang could not understand. He had just put the red light into his interspatial ring...he had just caught the red light and put it into his interspatial ring in an instant. The process was so short, it had only been a moment, but in such a short time, not only had his right palm been completely burned, but he had also used up one-fifth of his divine power.

He had used up one-fifth of his massive divine power at one time? What kind of terrifying power would be needed to do that.

As for the red light...Jian Wushuang immediately began to inspect his interspatial ring.

He found a shocking scene. After all, there were many treasures in his interspatial ring, which he had collected after killing many experts over the years, but now, except for a few extremely high-level treasures, all the other treasures in his interspatial ring had disappeared.

Yes, they had disappeared.

To be exact, because the red light had entered the interspatial ring, the original treasures had been directly evaporated by the terrifying temperature contained in the red light.

Only a limited number of extremely high-level treasures had managed to resist the terrifying temperature contained in the red light and remained.

Jian Wushuang immediately switched the remaining few treasures to another interspatial ring. Then he carefully looked at the red light.

It was not until the red light was the only treasure left in the interspatial ring that the red light finally quieted down. Jian Wushuang finally saw the true appearance of the red light.

The red light was actually a strange-shaped knife disk.

The knife disk looked a bit old and a bit old, but its surface was red and boiling hot, which appeared because it had been at the bottom of the Blazing Sea for a long time.

“What is this knife disk?” Jian Wushuang frowned and looked at the knife disk.

He could not see the material of the knife disk, but he could imagine that it had stayed at the bottom of the Blazing Sea for such a long time without being damaged. The material of the knife disk must be amazing.

Jian Wushuang also tried to refine the knife disk, but as soon as his soul power touched it, his soul immediately began to hurt. This was caused by his soul being unable to withstand the incredible temperature on the knife disk. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“The temperature is too high. I can’t even touch it, let alone refine it,” Jian Wushuang murmured, but soon he felt relieved. “Although I don’t know what this cutter board is, I can tell that it must have a great origin. Maybe it’s a very special treasure. I just don’t know its use.”

“I have no choice but to keep it. When I have the chance, I’ll find someone to see what it is.”

Jian Wushuang let out a sigh of relief. Even though he had lost one-fifth of his divine power and his right palm had been burned, his strength was still at his level, the burning of his palm would not harm him at all, and the divine power he had lost could be recovered at the fastest speed.

The only thing that made Jian Wushuang feel a bit distressed was the treasures in his interspatial ring that had been evaporated. After all, they had been accumulated over the years. However, when he thought of the miraculous properties of the knife disc…Jian Wushuang felt better.

Even if he did not know the exact origin and use of the knife disk, he could guess its value. It was definitely more valuable than all the treasures evaporated from his interspatial ring combined.

Boom!

A sudden boom made Jian Wushuang look toward the void in front of him.

In the void in front of him, the huge flame tide filled the entire sky. The flame tide had crashed into a huge rock that had stood in the middle of the Blazing Sea for many years, it had long been immune to the impact of the flame tide. It only made some booming sounds.

“The flame tide is too terrifying. It will sweep over a larger and larger area. I don’t know when it will completely stop. If an expert accidentally falls into the range of the flame tide at this time, I’m afraid the end will be quite miserable.” Jian Wushuang sighed, however, he did not think too much about the flame tide. Instead, he continued to fly toward his target, the core area of Devil Smoke Valley.
