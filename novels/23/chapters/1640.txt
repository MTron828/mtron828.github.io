Chapter 1641: The Last Secret Skill

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The seventh level was the last level of the Star Moon Tower.

After Jian Wushuang appeared in a vast wasteland, he saw his opponent right away.

His opponent had already revealed her Ancient God body. It was a Gold-armored Ancient God. However, what was different was that its body was obviously slightly more emaciated and it was not as big as other Ancient Gods.

“Lady Gu Mei, it’s you?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Gu Mei was a Seven-star Ancient God.

The seventh level of the Star Moon Tower was actually personally guarded by her.

“Gu Jian, you are very outstanding and I admire your talents. However, even though I admire your talents, I cannot break the rules of the Ancient God Palace. Hence, when we fight later on, I will not show you any mercy,” Gu Mei said.

“Lady Gu Mei, please do your best,” Jian Wushuang laughed indifferently.

He could tell that Gu Mei was merely an Ancient God shadow. Thus, the abilities that she could unleash would be comparable to a Real God’s on the Real God ranking list and she was totally within the level of people whom he could deal with.

Rippling sword essence appeared from Jian Wushuang’s body.

In the next moment, Jian Wushuang made his move.

Within the seventh level of the Star Moon Tower, Jian Wushuang and Gu Mei’s Ancient God were fighting an intense battle against each other.

…

Atop the floating sacrificial altar in the sky outside the Star Moon Tower.

“I wonder if Jian Wushuang will be able to clear the seventh level!”

“This Jian Wushuang is not stupid. Since he has the guts to challenge the seventh level, he definitely has absolute confidence.”

“But after all, the seventh level is guarded by Lady Gu Mei herself.”

A number of top experts were having various discussions.

As for Jian Wushuang, not long after he entered the Star Moon Tower, Gu Mei, who was atop the sacrificial altar and had closed her eyes all the while, opened her eyes.

“Lady Gu Mei, how was it?”

“Is Gu Jian dead or alive?”

The surrounding Ancient Gods looked at Gu Mei in succession.

“For the result, wouldn’t all of you be able to find out by looking?” Gu Mei chuckled.

Everyone looked toward the Star Moon Tower at once.

All of a sudden, a dim light appeared from the seventh level of the Star Moon Tower.

“He had cleared it!”

“He actually succeeded?”

The top experts above the sacrificial altar, as well as the Ancient Gods below who came to observe, opened their eyes big at that very moment.

At that very moment, Jian Wushuang’s body had already come out from the Star Moon Tower and he came before the sacrificial altar.

“Lady Gu Mei, thank you for letting me win,” Jian Wushuang gave Gu Mei a bow.

“I did not expect you to possess that kind of peculiar Secret Skill,” Gu Mei looked at Jian Wushuang with a baffled expression.

Jian Wushuang smiled and did not say much.

“Ling Shan, bring him to the Ancient God Palace to inherit the last Secret Skill,” King Gu You instructed personally.

“Understood,” Ling Shan nodded his head and brought Jian Wushuang to the place of inheritance.

After Jian Wushuang had left.

“Gu Mei, please tell us what exactly happened in the seventh level,” King Gu You looked toward Gu Mei.

“I am also very curious,” King Gu Tong also wore an interested expression.

“King Gu You, King Gu Tong, and everyone else present. Firstly, I have to say that my Ancient God shadow did not hold back in the seventh level of the Star Moon Tower and it displayed abilities that were in accordance with the standards of the Star Moon Tower,” Gu Mei said.

“After Jian Wushuang became a Six-star Ancient God, his abilities were indeed very powerful and he could rival a Stage Three Six-star Ancient God. However, when he was fighting an intense battle against my Ancient God shadow, he was completely suppressed. At the start, it was extremely one-sided and I even thought that there was no doubt that he would die. However, in the blink of an eye, his abilities skyrocketed abruptly.”

“If I’m not wrong, he has unleashed a very special Secret Skill which allows his power to achieve a completely new level which might even be above mine. Moreover, after unleashing his Secret Skill, neither did he waste any time on me nor compete with me in terms of close-quarters combat skills. Instead, he only unleashed Unique Skills and Secret Skills to compete with me in terms of power!”

“Even though it was purely a head-on clash of attacks, I was not his opponent and I was defeated.”

“That’s it?” The top experts present all looked at one another.

Among them, a red-haired, tall old man said: “Two thousand years ago when he challenged the sixth level of the Star Moon Tower which was guarded by me, he was not my opponent at the start as well. However, all of a sudden, his abilities skyrocketed and the power he unleashed was way greater than mine. Thus, I was defeated. It seems like he had used that Secret Skill as well.”

As soon as his words left his mouth, many experts present understood.

“This little kid actually possesses that kind of Secret Skill. No wonder he is so confident,” King Gu Yi laughed apathetically.

…

Ancient God Palace.

Under the guidance of Ling Shan, Jian Wushuang came in front of the three black ancient attics again.

Out of the three attics, Jian Wushuang had already gone into two of them and inherited the Thunder Attracting Skill, as well the Star Destruction Skill. At that very moment, he was only left with the final attic.

“You may go in now. The rules are the same – you only have ten years’ time,” Ling Shan said. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head. Without hesitation, he stepped into the palace.

When he entered the palace, the first thing he saw was still the one million foot hall Ancient God shadow, which was at the end of his line of vision.

“The Moon Picking Skill is the most powerful and mysterious skill of the Ancient God Clan’s Three Secret Skills. Hence, I wonder how impressive this Secret Skill is.”

Filled with a bit of excitement, Jian Wushuang sat down with his legs crossed immediately.

“Let’s begin!”

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes. In no time, Memories of Inheritance flowed into him.

Jian Wushuang also did his very best to absorb the Memories of Inheritance.

However, all of a sudden…

“Eh?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed fiercely.

“The Moon Picking Skill is actually a Spacetime-type Secret Skill?”

Jian Wushuang was surprised.

It should be known that what he had comprehended was the Spacetime Doctrine. Hence, his ability to detect the Power of Spacetime was naturally high.

As he absorbed the Memories of Inheritance, he could feel clearly that the Moon Picking Skill involved Power of Spacetime.

The Moon Picking Skill was an extremely advanced and frightening Spacetime-type Secret Skill. Hence, it could be said to be a remarkable ability.

However, it was unusual that such a Secret Skill did not require one to comprehend the Power of Spacetime at all. Instead, one only required a great amount of Ancient God Power to use it.

“How exquisite…” As Jian Wushuang muttered to himself, his consciousness could not help but enter a state of comprehension.

As he absorbed the Memories of Inheritance, he also used them to learn the Secret Skill and, from there, he comprehended the Spacetime Doctrine as well.

After all, such an advanced Spacetime Secret Skill would involve an extremely huge amount of Power of Spacetime. Moreover, these were all things that Jian Wushuang could comprehend.

Time passed by… In a flash, ten years had passed.

The inheritance of the Moon Picking Skill had come to an end. As for Jian Wushuang, not only did he learn the complete method to use the Moon Picking Skill, his level of comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine had also increased greatly.

“If I’m not wrong, my comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine has already achieved the standards needed to clear the fourth level of the Doctrine Palace,” Jian Wushuang giggled.
