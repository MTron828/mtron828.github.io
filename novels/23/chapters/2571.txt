Jian Wushuang arrived at a huge battlefield while being accompanied by the various clans’ experts.

The battlefield was the Combat Ring!

“It’s the Combat Ring! Jian Yi has made his way to the Combat Ring?”

“What’s he doing at the Combat Ring?”

“Is he going to fight against all the clan experts? Isn’t that stupid of him?”

All the clan experts were shocked to see Jian Wushuang just arrived and simply stood in the Combat Ring.

He had become a public target with countless experts eager to get the Heavenly Treasure battle armor from him. Even the Territorial Lord had personally made a move. How could he remain so calm in the Combat Ring? Everyone was perplexed by his unusual behavior.

However, no one attacked Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang stood leisurely in the Combat Ring with his eyes half-closed as he quietly waited.

In less than half an hour... Swoop! Swoop! Swoop! The sound of wind breaking echoed from across the nearby void.

A large number of soldiers in battle armor emerged one after another and formed two battalions with each made up of nearly a thousand people. In the center of both armies was a dark-skinned man wrapped in animal skins. The hair on his arms and face were extremely exuberant. The well-built man akin to a brown bear slowly made his way forward.

He emanated a violent aura.

“The Territorial Lord is here!”

The people from various clans who gathered around the Combat Ring—as well as some experts who came from being attracted by the news—held their breath.

They looked at the well-built man in absolute awe.

In a void surrounding the Combat Ring was the Situ Clan Leader, Situ Yuan, and several other Situ Clan Elders.

“Clan Leader, the Second Elder has already arrived at the Tianyang Mountains with the Situ Clan’s youngsters. They can use the Tianyang Mountains’ spatial passage to leave the Northern Darkstar Continent or even the Northern Darkstar Territory,” said an old woman with a snake-head cane.

“Alright.” Situ Yuan nodded slightly. “Let the Second Elder and the rest of them wait at the Tianyang Mountains first. We’ll prepare for the worst outcome. Our every problem will be solved if Jian Yi wins, but tell them to leave immediately if he loses.”

“Yes.” The old woman nodded solemnly.

The Situ Clan was in a life or death situation and needed to be fully prepared for the worst possible outcome under such circumstances.

In the blink of an eye, the well-built San Shouwang who slowly came forward from a distance appeared in the Combat Ring. On the side, the two army battalions formed a circle and surrounded the Combat Ring.

“Are you Jian Yi?” San Shouwang sounded arrogant with a voice laced with a hint of pride.

“San Shouwang.” Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and slowly raised his head.

“I hear your battle armor is very powerful. It’s not something an ordinary Ultimate God can own. Take these one hundred thousand Primordial Stones and give the battle armor to me. I’ll guarantee no one will dare trouble you in the future.” San Shouwang waved his hand and an Interspatial Ring appeared.

As a Territorial Lord and the top-ranked expert in the Northern Darkstar Territory, he did not act rashly and launch an attack. Instead, he bargained at the price of one hundred thousand Primordial Stones for Jian Wushuang to willingly give the armor to him.

One hundred thousand Primordial Stones was a large number for many clans but it was only a drop in the ocean compared to the true value of a Heavenly Treasure battle armor.

Jian Wushuang did not answer but calmly looked at San Shouwang instead. “San Shouwang, do you know why I appeared in this Combat Ring?”

San Shouwang narrowed his eyes slightly.

“I was waiting for you.” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently. “I watched from the sides when you fought with Pei Qi in this Combat Ring. Unfortunately, you declared that you wouldn’t accept a challenge for a thousand years after that battle. I have no choice but to come up with something that will lure you out of seclusion. It’s only after such will I be able to face off with you in the Combat Ring! A deathmatch battle!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was loud and resounded across the surrounding void.

Many experts beside the Combat Ring were shocked upon hearing that.

“What did he say?”

“A deathmatch battle? Is he going to have a deathmatch with the Territorial Lord?”

“My God, he deliberately came to this Combat Ring just to wait for the Territorial Lord’s appearance so that he could challenge him in a battle?”

“No, not only that. He even purposely showed off his Heavenly Treasure battle armor to entice the Territorial Lord!”

“How gutsy! Isn’t he just a Peak Ultimate God?”

The void around them clamored in turmoil.

The people shot Jian Wushuang many surprised and strange gazes.

They could understand why someone would want to challenge the Territorial Lord.

However, the unexpected part was the challenger’s realm being at only a Peak Ultimate God!

There was a huge gap between a Peak Ultimate God and Earth Ultimate God in terms of combat strength and such was proven in the battle between San Shouwang and Pei Qi.

However, why was Jian Yi still so confident?

Even San Shouwang himself was shocked to hear that from Jian Wushuang!

After a brief moment of shock, San Shouwang laughed out loud. “Boy, did I hear you correctly? A Peak Ultimate God dares to challenge me to a deathmatch battle?”

Jian Wushuang kept a straight face as he moved around before exposing the golden robe on his body which then spread out the magnificent and powerful aura of a Heavenly Treasure.

“This armor... As expected, it’s indeed a Heavenly Treasure battle armor!” There was a strong gleam in San Shouwang’s eyes.

“The battle armor is here. Come take it if you want it,” Jian Wushuang indifferently teased him.

“Haha, good! I’ll send you to hell since you have a death wish!” San Shouwang let out a loud laugh while an intense and violent aura that resembled a fierce beast instantly rose within him as his eyes flashed with strong killing intent.

San Shouwang fired the first shot.

His figure remained stagnant but a surging divine power began to gather on his right palm.

The divine power was almost ten times stronger than a typical Peak Ultimate God’s!

Such a concentrated and powerful divine power! San Shouwang then stepped forward and flung out his right fist.

Boom!

Suddenly, the world shook.

The void seemed to shatter by the blow as invisible ripples spread out.

It was a crude and hard punch without any fancy moves. After that blast, an impressive gush of divine powers converged in the void ahead and formed a three-meter-high strange beast in the blink of an eye. The beast roared as it frantically charged toward Jian Wushuang.
