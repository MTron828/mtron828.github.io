Chapter 2346: Hatred

Elder Chen’s words plunged the experts of the Zhuge Family into silence.

They didn’t want to admit it but what Elder Chen had said was the truth.

If it was just the Zhuge Family, killing Jian Wushuang would be impossible.

However, if Jian Wushuang wanted to deal with the Zhuge Family, it would be too easy. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

If he joined any sect and requested for the Zhuge Family to be annihilated, it would be a nightmare for them.

“Elder Chen, do you have an opinion?” Zhuge Yuanchong looked over.

“Simple. Your Zhuge Family shall forget the hatred you have for Jian Wushuang and never speak of revenge again. In fact, if possible, it would be best for you to head over personally and apologize to Jian Wushuang,” Elder Chen said.

“Apologize? Impossible!” Zhuge Hong exploded. “Jian Wushuang killed so many experts of our Zhuge Family and our Ancient Elder even died at his hand. Not seeking revenge is one thing, but now we have to apologize to him? If this gets out, won’t our Zhuge Family lose all face?”

Elder Chen squinted his eyes and didn’t say another word.

As for Zhuge Yuanchong, his views and exposure weren’t ordinary as the family head.

Hearing Elder Chen, he pondered for a moment before speaking. “Forgetting the hatred shouldn’t be an issue. Our Zhuge Family doesn’t have the strength to seek revenge against him as well and naturally won’t go and offend him. However, if we have to apologize to him... We aren’t at that stage yet.”

“Family Head Zhuge, are you thinking of Xiang Family?” Elder Chen looked over.

“Yeah.” Zhuge Yuanchong nodded. “In this battle, it isn’t just our Zhuge Family that has suffered huge losses. The Xiang Family has as well. Similarly, Xiang Family lost a Divine Demon to Jian Wushuang and the Xiang Family will definitely hate him to their cores. Moreover, different from our Zhuge Family, Xiang Family is standing at the top of the six elite families in Anjiu Prefecture. They are also more overbearing in their actions.”

“Also, the Golden Cauldron Sect that is behind the Xiang Family is very dominant. From what I understand, a genius from the Xiang Family joined Golden Cauldron Sect years ago. He’s probably an Enforcement Elder in Golden Cauldron Sect by now and happens to be the biological younger brother of the Divine Demon that Jian Wushuang killed!!”

“Summing everything up, Xiang Family will definitely not let this rest because of Jian Wushuang’s talents. If I’m right, that Enforcement Elder in the Golden Cauldron Sect that is from Xiang Family will definitely attend to this personally.”

“An Enforcement Elder from the Golden Cauldron Sect?” Elder Chen squinted his eyes.

Although the Golden Cauldron Sect wasn’t the most elite sect in the Wusha Barren Region, it was still stronger than the Dongzuo Sect.

An Enforcement Elder in Golden Cauldron Sect wouldn’t be considered high level in Golden Cauldron Sect but they would still have a level of authority and status that an ordinary Chaotic Divine Demon could compare with.

Moreover, from what Elder Chen knew, an Enforcement Elder in the Golden Cauldron Sect would typically be a Second Grade Divine Demon.

In other words, the Xiang Family might get a Second Grade Divine Demon to come for Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang is extremely strong. Even when facing the three Divine Demon Realm experts from the Xiang Family, he still could kill one of them and severely injure another. Among Third Grade Divine Demons, he is likely to be at the very top. However, if he is to compare with a Second Grade Divine Demon, there should still be some distance. If the Second Grade Divine Demon from Xiang Family is to go all out, he will very likely be able to kill Jian Wushuang!”

“Also, if I’m getting this right, the Half Step Divine Demon, Yan Que, that I paid a hefty sum to invite from Water Fairy Island, has probably died at his hand rather than that of the Lin Family,” said Zhuge Yuanchong.

“Yan Que? It can’t be... Jian Wushuang was just at the Pure Sun Realm then!” Zhuge Hong blurted out automatically.

“He’s just an Early Stage Chaotic Realm now and didn’t he kill Chaotic Divine Demons easily?” Zhuge Yuanchong took a glance at Zhuge Hong.

Zhuge Hong was stunned but forced a bitter smile.

“If that is the case, the Water Fairy Island will likely have their eyes on him as well.” Zhuge Yuanchong smirked and said, “In that case, I’ll inform Water Fairy Island about Jian Wushuang. I believe they will be very interested in him as well.”

“And once he is targeted by the Second Grade Divine Demon from Xiang Family and Water Fairy Island, he will most likely meet a sorry end. At that time, our Zhuge Family can just watch from the side. If Jian Wushuang dies, everything will be resolved and our revenge will have succeeded. However, if he survives under such circumstances, we will visit them the very next day to apologize personally.”

Upon hearing this, the other experts in the Zhuge Family exchanged glances and nodded their heads forcefully.

Indeed, if the Zhuge Family lowered their heads and apologized to Jian Wushuang now, they would lose all face.

However, if Jian Wushuang survived the Second Grade Divine Demon from Xiang Family and Water Fairy Island, all the other families in Anjiu Prefecture would only see it as a natural thing to do. They wouldn’t mock the Zhuge Family.

This was because Jian Wushuang would truly be someone they couldn’t afford to offend then.

“Let’s go with this for now. Relay the message to all experts and disciples in our Zhuge Family to be more honest in their actions for now,” Zhuge Yuanchong instructed.

“Yes.”

...

Just as Zhuge Yuanchong had expected, the Xiang Family was raging with anger.

Many experts in the Xiang Family were vengeful.

This time, the Xiang Family had suffered huge losses.

It was especially so as a Chaotic Divine Demon had been killed. Even for the Xiang Family, this was a huge blow.

“Family Head, we have heard from Xiang Yi. He’s currently on dangerous ground with several other Divine Demon Realm experts. He has to finish the mission issue by Golden Cauldron Sect before he can return,” the Divine Demon Realm burly old man said.

“Did he say how long he would take?” Xiang Zong asked.

“His sister’s death is a huge blow for him. His killing intent is alarming. Once he’s finished the mission, he will not return to Golden Cauldron Sect. Instead, he will rush here immediately. Also, those Divine Demon Realm experts that were with him for the mission might come along as well. In terms of timing, he said it would take three months at the very most. If he is lucky, he could be back at Xiang Family within two months,” the burly old man said.

“Three months? Alright then. We will wait patiently for three months. Once Xiang Yi returns after three months, we will kill our way into Lin Mansion and shred Jian Wushuang into a thousand pieces to appease the experts from our Xiang Family that died in battle! However, we must send people to keep an eye on Jian Wushuang, especially those whom he has gotten in contact with. I’m worried he might join some sects in the three months. Once he has the protection of a sect, it won’t be that easy for us to deal with him.”
