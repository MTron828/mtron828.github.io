4242 Challenging the Tower

Peng peng peng!

Jian Wushuang swept the Wuqi Divine Sword in his hand, and sharp sword essence kept exploding.

Every sword intent that exploded killed no less than a hundred Yuan siphoning beasts. Huge pits were blasted open in the dense horde of Yuan siphoning beasts!

However, after these beasts died, more emerged from the darkness and charged at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was expressionless. To him, no matter how many of the soul-devouring beasts came, they would not pose any threat to him.

With the Wuqi Divine Sword in his hand, killing these soul-devouring beasts was as easy as chopping melons and vegetables.

“I would like to see how many energy devouring beasts there are in this God Refining Tower.”

Jian Wushuang sat down with his legs crossed and closed his eyes. He used his divine power to control the Wuqi Divine Sword and it swept through the first level of the God Refining Tower.

The Wuqi Divine Sword slithered around Jian Wushuang like a spiritual snake. the cold sword light slashed down continuously, taking the life of the soul-devouring beast.

The massacre was so intense that the sky turned dark. No less than 100000 Yuan devouring beasts had died at Jian Wushuang’s hands.

In the God Refining Tower, it was as though there was no concept of time. after an unknown amount of time, the number of yuan devouring beasts on the first level started to decrease.

Whoosh!

With a flash of blood-red sword light, the Wuqi Divine Sword killed the last soul-devouring beast. Jian Wushuang slowly opened his eyes and stood up.

“Come.”

Jian Wushuang stretched out his hand and clenched his fist. The Wuqi Divine Sword appeared in his hand.

And the first level of the God Refining Tower was filled with sword Qi!

In the next moment, the sword Qi was completely absorbed by the God Refining Tower.

“Eh? What’s going on?”

Jian Wushuang frowned, but before he could think further, the scene changed again.

He was still surrounded by the dark void, but Jian Wushuang could feel that the place had become different.

The space here was more stable, and there were traces of rich nomological aura in the void.

Although this principles energy could not be compared to the river of enlightenment, it was several times more than the outside world.

Tap tap tap tap.

A sound came from the void again, but this sound was different from the roar of the yuan siphoning beast. It was as if someone was walking in an orderly manner in the dark.

“The first level has the yuan siphoning beasts. What’s the second level?”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and looked at the void curiously.

He did not have to wait long.

A weirdo covered in bandages, holding a rotten broken sword, and only his eyes could be seen, suddenly condensed in the void.

A…two…three…

in just a few seconds, tens of thousands of bandaged swordsmen had gathered in the void.

These bandaged swordsmen were wrapped in old and yellow bandages. Even their heads were wrapped in layers of bandages, only revealing a pair of lifeless and numb eyes.

The rotten broken swords in their hands drooped under their bodies like walking corpses. They staggered toward Jian Wushuang.

“Oh? A swordsman without consciousness? This is interesting.”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and tried to slash at the bandaged swordsman.

Clang!

A loud muffled sound was heard. The bandaged swordsman, who had been cut by Jian Wushuang, numbly raised the rotten broken sword in his hand to block.

However, the difference between Jian Wushuang and the bandaged swordsman was too great. The bandaged swordsman was cut into pieces in less than a breath’s time. The sword light that Jian Wushuang casually slashed out directly cut a 1000-foot-long blood path in the group of bandaged swordsmen before it stopped and disappeared.

Jian Wushuang swung his sword a few more times and found that there was no difference from before. He shook his head in disappointment, “This bandaged swordsman is too weak. He’s only slightly stronger than the energy-devouring beast.”

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang no longer had the mood to observe. He released the Wuqi Divine Sword and let it kill the bandaged swordsmen.

Clang clang clang!

The sound of swords clashing rang out as the bandaged swordsmen raised the decayed broken swords in their hands to block. However, before they could really block, the Wuqi Divine Sword was like a killing machine, quickly piercing through them.

The powerful and sharp sword intent directly blew up these already rotten swordsmen into dust.

It did not take long before the bandaged swordsmen were all killed by Wuqi Divine Sword.

Jian Wushuang opened his right hand and the Wuqi Divine Sword shot back into his hand.

“It was absorbed again?”

Jian Wushuang frowned. He could feel that the remaining sword essence on the Wuqi Divine Sword was absorbed by the surrounding void again.

“What’s going on? Or perhaps, what is this God Refining Tower trying to do?”

Jian Wushuang was lost in thought. From the first level of sword Qi to the second level of sword essence, Jian Wushuang had an illusion that the sword Qi and sword essence he was absorbing would affect their training in the God-refining area.

A moment later, the scene in front of Jian Wushuang changed again. He knew that he had reached the third level.

As long as he passed the third level, he would be able to obtain the clearance voucher to enter the eight cities.

…

…

At the same time, in the Tenth City.

Buzz! Buzz!

Two loud bell chimes suddenly sounded in the sky above the Tenth City.

The sound of the bell was filled with an ancient and vast feeling, giving people a feeling that it came from ancient times.

When they heard the two bells, all the Ultimate Rulers in the tenth city raised their heads in unison.

Someone is challenging the God Refining Tower!

The two bell chimes mean that the person who challenged the tower has already passed two levels and reached the third level!

They were all discussing.

However, there was no change in their expressions. after saying those words, they lowered their heads again. in the tenth city, they had seen many people who had passed through the two levels of the God Refining Tower. Thus, there was nothing to be surprised about.

Only a small number of people had a look of interest in their eyes as they headed toward the God Refining Tower.

Outside the God Refining Tower.

‘Blue’ did not leave. Instead, he crossed his arms and raised his head to look at the God Refining Tower. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Buzz! Buzz!

Two bell chimes came from the God Refining Tower. ‘Blue’ exclaimed when he saw this and said, “The two bell chimes came out almost at the same time. It seems that Blood Sword’s speed in breaking through the tower is very fast.”

At some point in time, Ruler Hao Jin had also arrived outside the God Refining Tower. When he heard Blue’s mumbling, a hint of pride appeared on his face. He puffed out his chest and chuckled. Lord Blue, our Lord Blood Sword is the one who personally killed Heavenly Snake Playboy. It is naturally not a problem for him to pass the first three levels of the God Refining Tower.

‘Blue’ looked at him indifferently and did not reply. instead, he continued to mutter to himself, “I remember that Heavenly Snake Playboy seemed to have reached the fifth level and was unable to go any further. I wonder how many levels this Blood Sword can reach.

After ‘Blue’ finished speaking, he continued to look up at the God Refining Tower with a pensive look in his eyes.
