Unexpectedly, he managed to find them, and all at once, there were seven, precisely the number he needed.

However, the price these seven demanded was exorbitant.

50 million each, totaling 350 million for all seven.

He wasn't lacking in funds; rather, he was afraid of arousing suspicion by revealing too much.

"Your Highness, not at ease?" Seeing Xia Mang Guanyu remaining silent, the tier 4 Emperor in golden attire asked with confusion.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and spoke, "No, it's just that the price is too high. I am only a Prince; if I were to produce so many godstones, it would undoubtedly invite trouble!"

"Your Highness, rest assured. I understand this, and I will keep it confidential. They won't leak any information!"

Seeing the other party's solemn assurance, Jian Wushuang directly took out a mustard seed, placed it on the table, and said, "Here are 50 million godstones. You can take it over now as a sign of my sincerity. When they arrive, I will give another 100 million, and before the expedition, I will settle the remaining godstones!"

"No problem!" The Emperor in golden attire revealed a smile. A hint of killing intent flashed in Jian Wushuang's eyes. This time, he was treated like a fat sheep.

They just raised their price out of the blue!eastern fantasy

35 million, they really dared to ask for it. Let's see if they have the fate to spend it.

The strength of these casual cultivators was mediocre, yet their asking price was outrageously high.

Night fell.

The seven tier 4 Emperors arrived at the military camp.

After Xia Mang Guanyu entertained them and left 100 million godstones to them, they hastily departed.

A confidential decree came from the palace.

On this very day, the Great Xia Dynasty officially declared war on the Mo Luo Kingdom.

On the day of the declaration of war, General Gutong, leading a million troops, flattened a city in the Mo Luo Kingdom.

On the imperial border were four battlefield cities.

Three of these cities were guarded by three generals, and one was under the command of the Empire's First Marshal.

However, currently, only General Gutong was present.

Today, the Emperor summoned the Crown Prince and some influential courtiers, probably for this matter.

Upon entering the Qianyang Gate, it was already bustling with activity.

Here, Jian Wushuang also saw the immensely powerful Second Prince.

"Marquis Xia Mang!"

Jian Wushuang recognized the person's face; he was a chubby man, and his understanding of him from memory was limited.

Now seeing him in person and sensing the aura around him, it was extraordinary.

The two guards by his side were both tier 4 Emperors, displaying a more extravagant lineup than even the Crown Prince.

The Crown Prince had only one tier 4 Emperor by his side.

The tier 4 Emperors by their side were figures willing to lay down their lives for them.

In contrast, Jian Wushuang's side seemed a bit lacking in significance, clearly recruited through financial means.

Moreover, both the Crown Prince and the Second Prince held military power.

"That Marquis Xia Mang has already reached the tier 4 Emperor level, and he harbors a peculiar power within him, not weaker than the peak of the tier 4!" Bai Junwang's voice echoed in his mind.

Jian Wushuang felt a stir in his heart.

Peak of the tier 4?

This was much stronger than the Crown Prince, at least he wouldn't need to exert full force to defeat the Crown Prince, but the Second Prince, he was not a match.

This person was so powerful that he was probably the counterpart to the Mo Luo's Eldest Prince on the battlefield.

At that time, the Princes of Great Xia would become the laughingstock.

No wonder the Crown Prince had vehemently opposed going to war in the first place; there was this underlying connection.

Seeing the other party from a distance, Xia Mang Guanyu's face lit up, revealing a warm smile. "Second Brother, wait for me!"

The chubby Second Prince heard Jian Wushuang's shout, turned unexpectedly, and smiled.

"Ninth brother!"

The two entered the depths of the imperial palace together, leaving the guards outside naturally.¬†This chapter is updatd by no.v_eln.ext.c_o_m

In the main hall of the Positive Yang Palace.

It was the first time for Jian Wushuang to see the Emperor.

"Xia Mang Yunxing!"

This figure, comparable to the ancestor of the Xia Mang Clan, was indeed extraordinary.

From him, Jian Wushuang saw the shadow of Elder Jiu Jian.Alll ùíçùíÇtest novùíÜlùíî on novelbùíän/(.)cùíêm

After everyone took their seats, Jian Wushuang dared to look carefully. The hall was now almost full, with dozens of tier 5 Emperors, not to mention tier 4 Emperors.

The other two generals among the Three Great Generals had also arrived, both peak tier 5 forces, similar to Xuanyuan Dapan.

Of course, Xuanyuan Dapan was also there, along with several sons. Finally, an hour later, after Xia Mang Yunxing, the commander-in- chief of Great Xia's 'Xia Mang Yunzhan', took his seat, everyone was present.

Jian Wushuang not only secretly assessed Xia Mang Yunxing but also learned that he not only commanded the great army of cultivators in Great Xia but was also the current Imperial Emperor's brother.

The two brothers were both peak tier 5 Emperors.

However, Xia Mang Yunxing became famous much earlier than the current Emperor!

Swish!

With everyone present, they stood up, bowing respectfully regardless of who they were.

"Pay respects to Your Majesty!"

Xia Mang Yunxing sat on the throne, pressed his hand, and his gaze was extremely imposing.

Beside the throne, there were several grandmaster chairs, with several old eunuchs sitting above.

On the left and right sides of Xia Mang Yunxing, two people stood, and everyone bowed respectfully, but these two individuals remained unmoved.

One was the Royal Teacher, 'Wuliang Buddha'.

The other, a eunuch in a red robe embroidered with bold patterns, had a head full of white hair and a face unnaturally pale.

When Jian Wushuang stood up straight and glanced at him, he felt a sense of unease deep in his heart.

In this grand hall, this person's strength was probably the strongest. Jian Wushuang didn't even dare to actively inquire of Bai Junwang, fearing that the other might see through his disguise.

"Don't worry, that red-robed old eunuch is indeed at the tier 6, but he has flaws. His strength is quite ordinary, much weaker than the Lie Huo I killed in the past. At my peak, I could have killed him with a breath!" Bai Junwang spoke casually, treating a tier 6 Emperor as if he were just an insect.

Jian Wushuang, however, secretly transmitted his voice, "Old man, if you come out now and blow him away, do I still need to be afraid?"

"Hmph, you don't believe me?" Bai Junwang clenched his fist, speaking coldly, "Wait until I regain my strength, and watch how I slaughter the Great Xia!"

If he truly regained his strength, slaughtering the Great Xia would be a trivial matter. With Bai Junwang's unparalleled strength, not only the ancient kingdom of Great Xia, but the entire Tiannan would lack a worthy opponent. The only question was when he could fully recover his strength.

"This time, if I can refine the origin source, it's already good. Afterward, the divine spirits granted me a divine body and flesh, but I still need to integrate the power of all things into Bai Junwang. That process won't be completed in less than 1,000 years," Bai

Junwang explained.

"Stop talking!" Thinking about those troublesome matters, Jian Wushuang felt a headache. He didn't want to listen to Bai Junwang boasting.

Xia Mang Yunxing slowly stood up, looked at everyone, and spoke with a voice like a bell, majestic, "The demonic path is rampant, and the chaos in the Tiannan is enough. The northern border of the Great Xia cannot become another chaotic region!"

Everyone listened carefully.

"Summoning you all today is for the matter of expedition. Share your thoughts!" Xia Mang Yunxing said these words and then left the grand hall with the Royal Teacher and the red-robed eunuch. He was the decision-maker, not the strategist.

After the people in the hall discussed a strategy, he would come back and make the final decision.

This was how Imperial Emperors acted.

If defeated, kill the strategists; if victorious, take credit as the decision-maker.

Everyone was intelligent; who wouldn't see through this?
