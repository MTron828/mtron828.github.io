Chapter 1203: Celestial Elixir

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“If I’m not mistaken, the little fatty has indeed refined himself into an elixir. In other words, he’s an elixir himself,” said Gu King with a slight smile. “It is called the Celestial Elixir.”

“Celestial Elixir?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

“It’s a peculiar and rare elixir. Its greatest feature is that it has a spiritual nature. Once it’s refined, it can directly transform into a person and can even cultivate itself just like human beings. Basically, it’s not much different from humans.”

“Your brother is no different from your father who is transformed from a Sword Spirit!”

“Your father is the reincarnation of a Sword Spirit while your brother is the reincarnation of a Celestial Elixir. He’s a Celestial Elixir all along but it’s just that he has just metamorphosized now.” Gu King laughed. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“I see.” Jian Wushuang was still in shock.

“Being an elixir itself, a Celestial Elixir has the blessed gift of refining elixirs. Given abundant resources and provided proper conditions, he can certainly be a top alchemist in the future!” Gu King added.

“But few Celestial Elixirs can be top alchemists in the Eternal Chaotic World. One reason is that they lack both the conditions and resources for cultivation. The other is that many cultivators covet these extraordinary Celestial Elixirs. If experts in the Eternal Chaotic World have one, their strength will improve significantly!”

“So, once found, a Celestial Elixir will probably be eaten alive by powerful cultivators!”

“Eaten alive?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“Look how scared the little fatty is. He’s clearly worried that someone in Green Fire Palace will find out about his identity and swallowed him.” Gu King jested.

Jian Wushuang looked at Wang Yuan and saw that the latter indeed look unhappy to be here. His eyes were full of anxiety.

“I did not expect his origin to be so special.” Jian Wushuang’s expression was strange and complex.

“Senior Huo Qiong, I’ll personally escort Brother Wang Yuan to Dan Xin Palace,” he said.

“Thank you.” Huo Qiong smiled.

“It’s my pleasure. Wang Yuan is my brother. If he can claim Dan Xin Palace, it’s great news for the Green Fire World.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He then sent a message to Samsara Temple Master before setting off.

“Let’s go, Brother Wang Yuan.”

“Third Brother, do take care of me now that you enjoy a high reputation of a Palace Master,” Wang Yuan said unhappily.

“Rest assured that no one will hurt you as long as I’m here.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Celestial Elixir could really bring immeasurable benefits to cultivators.

But it had no effect on the war. Besides, Wang Yuan was his brother. He would never allow harm to come to Wang Yuan.

He left with Wang Yuan at once.

Green Fire Palace was pretty far from Dan Xin Palace. It took them more than 10 years to get there.

“That is Dan Xin Palace. Go on and enter.” Jian Wushuang pointed at the golden palace floating in front of them.

The golden majestic palace had been floating there since it came into being.

Though both sides had sent experts who had made notable achievement in elixir refinement to claim Dan Xin Palace in the past few years, no one succeeded.

Wang Yuan raised his head to look at the palace. He swallowed uneasily before walking slowly toward it.

The door to the palace swung open when Wang Yuan neared and a chubby, bald elder stepped out.

The elder had a pair of small, mouse-like eyes. He was Dan Xin, the spirit of the similarly-named palace.

“Eternal Realm?”

The elder looked at Wang Yuan with contempt. In a scornful voice, he said, “You dare claim Dan Xin Palace when you’re just an Eternal Realm expert? Do you want to die?”

Wang Yuan froze for a moment but he could tell that the bald elder was just spirit. Undeterred, he replied, “You said one’s cultivation has to be less than 500,000 years and one has to have some achievements in elixir refinement. You didn’t say anything about realms!”

“Well, you’re not wrong that there’s no realm limitation. You’re free to try but the same rule applies. Dig up a million pounds of Black Iron and then we’ll talk,” the elder said with a face full of smiles.

“One million pounds?” Wang Yuan was shocked.

Behind him, Jian Wushuang’s face darkened. “Dan Xin, the war between Green Fire Palace and the Jin Kingdom is looming. I don’t have the patience to play with you. I give you two choices: either let my brother in and begin the test or I’ll kill you right now. Even if I can’t kill you, I’ll suppress you so you’ll never see the light of day!”

“You can try me if you think it’s a joke!”

Jian Wushuang looked cold.

The Jin Kingdom and Green Fire Palace both coveted Dan Xin Palace, which was why they left it here.

However, they had such a small chance of victory in the war. Their loss would spell the destruction of the Green Fire World. Put it this way, Dan Xin Palace was useless. He had every reason to destroy the palace lest the Jin Kingdom got its hand on it.

The elder immediately turned to look at Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang?”

The bald elder narrowed his eyes because he recognized Jian Wushuang. In the battle of Dan Xin Palace, Jian Wushuang’s performance was outstanding. In fact, he even bantered with Jian Wushuang.

He frowned, knowing that Jian Wushuang was not joking around.

“Oh well. If you don’t want to play with me, so be it. Come right in, young man,” the elder said.

Wang Yuan took a deep breath and entered Dan Xin Palace without hesitation.

The doors closed after Wang Yuan. Surprisingly, the bald elder walked toward Jian Wushuang.

He stopped right in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, you said Green Fire Palace is going to war with the Jin Kingdom? Tell me more,” the elder said.

The elder had lived a long and lonely life. Now there was someone to talk, he definitely would not let Jian Wushuang go.

Jian Wushuang merely spared him a glance with his cold eyes and nothing more.

To him, the bald elder was just an old madman and freak that he did not want to bother with.
