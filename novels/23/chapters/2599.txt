“Master, the scale of the auction this time is much larger than before and the treasures are of very high level. Among them are some very precious and rare treasures. Your Heavenly Treasure offensive divine soul weapon is indeed precious but among all the other treasures up for auction, it’s probably ranked in the top ten. It’s still quite far off from being the grand finale item to be auctioned.

“Of course, it will qualify if it’s a High-level Heavenly Treasure offensive divine soul weapon,” said the Black Chief.

Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded.

He had underestimated the auction’s scale. He thought that his Heavenly Treasure offensive divine soul weapon was very precious and rare. Surprisingly, it was only ranked in the top ten among the many treasures up for auction.

“Let’s make it the first treasure to be auctioned if this is the case,” agreed Jian Wushuang.

“Okay.” The Black Chief nodded slightly.

“By the way, I still have some resources here. Can you please have a look at them and see how many Primordial Stones are they worth so I’ll have a rough idea.” Jian Wushuang took out another Interspatial Ring.

There were a lot of cultivation resources along with a myriad of treasures in that Interspatial Ring.

They were left behind by San Shouwang and Zhong Hun and each was quite valuable.

The Black Chief began to carefully scrutinize each of them.

He raised his head after a while. “Master, a rough estimation of your resources here should be around twelve million Primordial Stones.”

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. He did a calculation with Xiao Tiexin before and was told an almost similar figure.

“During the auction, I should be able to use these resources to pay if I want to buy any of the auctioned items, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course you can,” said the Black Chief.

“That’s fine.” Jian Wushuang cracked a smile on his face.

He had used up some of the Primordial Stones he received from Zhong Hun’s Interspatial Ring. However, there were still approximately 6,000,000 Primordial Stones. After adding in 2,000,000 Primordial Stones from selling the Divine Destruction Beast manual and the 10,000,000 to 12,000,000 Primordial Stones worth of resources, he would have about 20,000,000 Primordial Stones in total.

Apart from that, he still had a Divine Elixir Pill that was equivalent to 5,000,000 Primordial Stones.

The four treasure pieces he put up for auction at the Star Picking Pavilion were worth a lot of Primordial Stones, especially the Heavenly Treasure defensive armor and the offensive divine soul weapon.

“If I add up all the Primordial Stones I could get after the auction, my total assets will be more than one hundred million Primordial Stones!” Jian Wushuang held his hands in confidence.

100,000,000 Primordial Stones was truly an amazing amount.

He wondered if it was enough for him to buy The Stately Painting.

“There’s one more thing.” Jian Wushuang looked at the Black Chief again. “You knew I’m from the Northern Darkstar Territory and I haven’t been the Territorial Lord for long. The previous Territorial Lord, San Shouwang had handed over a unique treasure to the Star Picking Pavilion over the past few decades. It’s an unusual picture scroll and I heard it’ll be auctioned in this coming auction. Is this true?”

“Picture scroll?” The Black Chief looked surprised before slowly nodded. “It’s true indeed.”

“When will the picture scroll be auctioned? How much will the price be like?” Jian Wushuang asked.

The Black Chief wore a strange look. “Master, I’m sorry. The Star Picking Pavilion has a rule. There will be many treasures to be auctioned but we are unable to release information about these treasures before the auction. As for the picture scroll you mentioned, I was able to affirm that it’ll be auctioned because you were able to tell me about the picture’s origins. That’s all I can say.”

Jian Wushuang was helpless.

“Master, this is your token. You’ll have a box on the second floor when the auction begins. If something happens during the auction, I’ll also use the same token to send you a message. During this time, you may also choose to live in the Star Picking Pavilion and I can arrange a secret chamber for you if you’d like.” The Black Chief handed a token to Jian Wushuang.

“Yes, please.” Jian Wushuang took the token and smiled faintly. He soon arrived at a secret chamber in the Star Picking Pavilion Soon under the Black Chief’s guidance.

“It’s less than four months before the auction date. I’ll just wait here during this time.” Jian Wushuang took out the Fengtian Scroll before closing his eyes and began to meditate.

Time was passing by slowly.

As the auction day got closer and closer, more and more experts from the other stellar regions arrived.

In a flash, it was the day before the auction began.

Star Picking Pavilion was brightly lit that night.

Jian Wushuang continued to mediate in his secret chamber with his eyes closed when a soft knock suddenly sounded on the door.

“What’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang kept his eyes closed.

“Master, the auction will officially begin tomorrow. Many Territorial Lords from various stellar regions, experts from various sects, and also some independent experts have now gathered in the Star Picking Pavilion. We’ve invited all these experts to a grand banquet tonight so that everyone can get to know each other. Would you be interested in joining?” The Black Chief’s voice came from outside the secret chamber.

“Banquet? I got it.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

The Black Chief immediately left. Jian Wushuang had also stood up and walked towards the banquet.

It was a huge noisy banquet with hundreds of experts participating in the banquet with more than a dozen of Territorial Lords among them.

Jian Wushuang was also a Territorial Lord but his identity was not sufficient to be a star of the banquet. There were many more people attending the banquet with much higher status and power than him.

Jian Wushuang briefly glanced around. Among the hundreds of experts, he spotted more than 20 Peak Earth Ultimate Gods with the remaining being either Primary-level or High-level Earth Ultimate Gods. As for those who had the higher Heaven Ultimate God cultivation realm, there were only six people!

Besides that, there were a few people around who were not particularly powerful but had impressive backgrounds.

Especially the menacing-looking crimson-haired young man who was sitting in the center of the banquet. The young man was just a Peak Earth Ultimate God, but the few Heaven Ultimate Gods who sat around him dared not act arrogant and behaved humbly around him. They seemed to be quite fearful of him.

From the conversations of the Territorial Lords around him, Jian Wushuang learned that the crimson-haired young man came from Nanwu Palace and he was the Young Palace Master of the Nanwu Palace!

Nanwu Palace was one of the top five powerful sects in the entire Danyang Holy Domain!

There was hearsay that Nanwu Palace had the capabilities to even challenge the Crimson Stone Fort!
