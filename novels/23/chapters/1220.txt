Chapter 1221: The Grand Formation of the Enduring Samsara

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Seeing that Jian Wushuang was still alive, his comrades heaved a sigh of relief.

“A trap! That’s indeed a trap!”

“The great Monarch of the Jin Kingdom did not appear even at the first battle. To think that he would elect to conceal himself to ambush Master Wushuang! Hardly the conduct befitting a king!”

Huge roars of anger and indignant shoutings arose within the deep of the Battle Fortress.

The Palace Masters of the Green Fire World immediately convened to discuss their plans.

With incredible restorative powers of his own coupled with the help of the Gu King, Jian Wushuang required only a short period to heal himself with a new arm fully regrown.

“Palace Master Yun. I am afraid no one is better than you in the skills of using magical formations. Do you have any inkling as to what that black and white vortex is?” The Samsara Temple Master sat in his throne and asked, his deep voice rumbling with concern.

The rest of the Palace Masters present immediately turned to look at Palace Master Yun.

Palace Master Yun was one of the oldest entities in the Green Fire World. Long had he been deep in delving into the arcane skills and masteries of using magical barriers and formations. Indeed, there was no better person than he who knew more about magical formations.

Palace Master Yun frowned as he raked his mind for answers to the inquiry of the Temple Master. It took quite some time before he uttered, “The black and white swirling mass is a mixture of two different energies of opposing polarities. The conjurer of the mass has harnessed both energies to create a revolving cycle that consumes and breaks apart both air and space around it. T-that… That is indeed a magical formation!”

“More importantly, it looks oddly alike to a formation I have once read about in an ancient codex, the Grand Formation of the Enduring Samsara. Yes, it looks almost the same.”

“The Grand Formation of the Enduring Samsara?” This sent a shudder across the crowd of Palace Masters present.

“Yes. That swirling mass of black and white color is indeed the Grand Formation of the Enduring Samsara.” Jian Wushuang’s voice came suddenly.

The Gu King had earlier recognized the spinning vortex.

“This is bad! Woe is upon us if that is really the Grand Formation that you spoke of!”

Palace Master Yun’s voice grew deep and hoarse, “The ancient codex that I have once read is actually chanced upon by experts of the Green Fire Palace somewhere from this vast battlefield. Despite having recorded many unique and powerful magical formations, much of the codex has been damaged and scattered with missing chapters and pages.”

“The descriptions of this Formation in the codex is incomplete. But from the pieces of fragmental information remaining, it is safe to conclude that the Grand Formation is indeed terrible and dangerous to us all!”

“The swirling vortex might seem ordinary and harmless and even a Dao Master may easily destroy it. But once completed, the vortex will increase into a gargantuan size in only two hours. By then, there will be no ways for us to destroy it.”

“Two hours!” The stunned crowd of Palace Masters began to look worried.

It had been more than two hours since the woman of the Jin Kingdom began her rituals to conjure the vortex.

Could this not mean that the Grand Formation had fully stabilized?

“Indeed, what Master Yun said is correct. With only two hours, the Grand Formation will be fully secured. That’s why I urged you to strike immediately before. It’s imperative that you destroy the formation before it nears completion. But now…” The voice of the Gu King rang grimly in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

Jian Wushuang grimaced with dread. He turned to Palace Master Yun, “Master Yun, what powers does the Grand Formation wield? Will it keep on expanding?”

“Yes. It will grow ceaselessly.” Palace Master Yun acknowledged, “Its reach now will hardly be able to threaten us. But as it grows in size, so does its strength, its powers will draw in and swallow everything around it. With no one to stop it, its growth will never see its end!”

“The vortex will only require a few years to grow into a staggering size. By then, it will be able to destroy this Battle Fortress and reduce us into shreds. The Green Fire World, having lesser endurance than that of the Battle Fortress, will surely fall as well.”

“What!” The Palace Masters present were all astounded.

With only a few years of maturation, the swirling vortex of energies would be able to destroy even the Battle Fortress?

With the Battle Fortress and the Green Fire World remaining anchored and immovable, the position of the vortex just in front of the Fortress would make the Fortress its first and foremost prey when it grew larger.

“So, the Jin Kingdom would only have to wait and watch us being devoured by this vortex when they would not need to even lose any of their soldiers?” The Void Temple Master uttered with shock.

“That is true.” Palace Master Yun nodded wearily.

Silence filled the hall as the Palace Masters instantly fell into a sullen dismay of fear and dread.

They were still reveling in the victory of the first battle not long ago, honestly believing that they finally had the power to challenge the Jin Kingdom.

They were confident that they would prevail.

But never had they expected that the Jin Kingdom employed the use of something so deadly and terrible.

The Grand Formation of the Enduring Samsara that was such a terrifying horror!

“No. We cannot allow it to continue growing. We must destroy it before it destroys us!” The Samsara Temple Master bellowed.

“Aye! We must destroy it at once!”

“The vortex will be our greatest nightmare if not removed!”

An unconquerable resolution shone in their eyes.

In one way or another, the black and white vortex must be stopped! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Palace Master Yun, you seemed to be most familiar with this Grand Formation. Do you have any suggestions?” The Samsara Temple Master looked towards the Palace Master Yun.

The old Palace Master shook his head. “I am afraid not. As I have mentioned earlier, the information of the Grand Formation in the ancient codex is hardly complete. The description of it is all I have.”

“What? We do not know how?” There was hushed murmuring and dark glances shared among the Masters.

“Do you know of any way to undo this formation, Gu King?” Jian Wushuang asked his companion.

“Despite my adventures in the Eternal Chaotic World with King Luo Zhen, I have barely any understanding in magical formations. I have once seen with my own eyes another Grand Formation of the Enduring Samsara; another one which had grown for millennia. But it was an immensely powerful entity who have destroyed it.” The Gu King related of his tale.

“Destroyed with sheer raw power?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“You would best find another way yourself. The one who destroyed the Grand Formation I’d seen was one of the most powerful supreme entities; one who was equal to the founder of the Star Bloodline. None of you here possess any strengths that could hope to match his.” The Gu King remarked.
