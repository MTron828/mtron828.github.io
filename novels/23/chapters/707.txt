Chapter 708: Two Versus Two

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The purple saber lashed out like lightning.

Shua…

It moved extremely fast.

“This speed!” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Luckily, he was proficient in Sword Principle so he was able to react in time.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

Wu Dao brandished his saber with terrifying strength and made swift strikes in succession.

The killing intent in his eyes soared as Jian Wushuang fully released the power of the World Dao.

The World Dao contained everything in the world. Although it had no peculiarity, it was flawless. Jian Wushuang combined it with his swordsmanship and succeeded in resisting attacks from his opponent.

“Ghost Shadow!” Wu Dao shouted.

The purple saber shot forward with doubled speed and force.

“Violet Calamity Sword Skill.” Jian Wushuang immediately displayed his trump card.

Boom! The collision caused Jian Wushuang to tilt backwards and made his hands tingle. Wu Dao remained unaffected and continued to unleash saber light at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang appeared fearless and remained stoic.

Seeing Jian Wushuang resisting in a composed manner, Wu Dao was surprised. “Boy, you do possess some strength.”

He had underestimated Jian Wushuang. After witnessing his fight with Gong Chao, Wu Dao had even proclaimed that he would be able to kill him with a single strike. However, Wu Dao had barely been able to suppress him, even with his full strength.

“Hum, I can’t match you in offensive power, but your Saber Technique is far inferior to my Sword Technique.

“I can’t defeat you, but it’s impossible for you to kill me.” Jian Wushuang growled.

He had completely comprehended the nine Occults of the Slaughter Dao.

Now he was capable of remaining undefeated with the help of his exquisite swordsmanship.

“You’re right. It’s hard to kill you on my own. What a pity! There’s another expert who wants you to die.” Wu Dao sneered as he looked at a spot next to Jian Wushuang.

“Hum?” Jian Wushuang paled as he found a figure standing next to him.

“Dao Mei?” Jian Wushuang’s face fell.

Now he had to deal with two superior Divine Realm experts from Cloud Sea Asgard.

Dao Mei folded his arms and said coldly, “Wu Dao, didn’t you say that you could kill him with a single strike?”

“I didn’t know that he had hidden his strength. It’s already reached our level. He is even stronger than Xue Guzi. Moreover, his swordsmanship is too exquisite,” Wu Dao snorted.

He was telling the truth.

His overall strength was far superior to Jian Wushuang, but he was unable to defeat the boy because of his extraordinary?swordsmanship.

“Extraordinary swordsmanship? Hehe, what about comparing it to my Saber Technique?” Dao Mei sneered. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Dao Mei was proficent in Saber Technique.

“Let’s work together to kill him. This zone is full of danger. If we dally too long, we might draw the attention of the Demon Gods or the other experts,” Wu Dao said in a solemn tone.

“OK.” Dao Mei nodded.

Terrifying aura erupted from the two experts as they charged forward.

”?Two superior Divine Realm experts??” Jian Wushuang was not frightened.

Shua! his body seemed to split for a second and two figures appeared. One resisted Wu Dao, while the other one dealt with Dao Mei.

Two versus two. Jian Wushuang continued to hold his own in the fight.

“Doppelganger Secret Skill?”

“Humph, he had displayed that skill in the Firmament Territory Feast. It’s not a big deal.”

“It won’t change anything.”

The strength of Wu Dao and Dao Mei erupted.

They were the strongest among the superior Divine Realm experts. Although Jian Wushuang had comprehended the Fifth Occult of World Dao and Slaughter Dao and his strength had greatly improved after entering the Eternal Zone, he was still weaker than the two experts.

Fortunately, his excellent swordsmanship helped him to withstand their attacks for a while.

“Humph, Jian Wushuang, I’ll see how long you’ll withstand our attacks,” Wu Dao said in an icy tone.

Wu Dao launched continuous attacks, giving Jian Wushuang no respite, causing his World Body to gradually retreat.

The Slaughter Body was in a worse situation.

Jian Wushuang had used the Heart-killing Sword, instead of his Eternal Weapon, the Emperor Sword, so his Slaughter Body was weaker than the World Body.

The Slaughter Body was only adept at offensive attack, but he was still inferior than Dao Mei.

While the two Original Bodies fought the two experts, the black-robed figure who had been hiding in the nearby forest watched.

”?It looks like there’s no need for me to make a move. The two little guys from Cloud Sea Asgard can kill Jian Wushuang,?” the man thought. His face was completely concealed by his robe.

“Tut, Jian Wushuang is amazing. It’s a pity that he follows the Ancient Sect and has become Xuan Yi’s personal disciple.”

“Xuan Yi has fostered three monsters, so no one will allow him to bring up the fourth one.”

“What a pity! A peerless genius will die!” the black-robed figure murmured.

Abruptly, he looked at the battlefield with an odd expression. “Hum?”

“Here comes another expert from the Immortal Dynasty.”

“Hehe, things are getting interesting.”
