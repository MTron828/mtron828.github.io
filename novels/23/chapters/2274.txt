Chapter 2275 Jian Wushuang and Leng Ruxue

Leng Ruxue’s words got Bing Shan thinking. He immediately recalled his Lord from the Absolute Beginning Divine World before nodding his head.Indeed. That lord’s vision was incredible.

Leng Ruxue had to be very different and unique if the lord was willing to accept her as a lineal disciple and pay a hefty price to bring her back from this sealed off Heaven and Earth back to the Absolute Beginning Divine World.

Even though Jian Wushuang was incredibly powerful, Leng Ruxue should have no problem staying alive since she was that lord’s disciple.

Bing Shan thought of this and hesitated no longer.

His figure flickered as he appeared at one side of the vast space.

“One Star Man, you are almost on the same level as the Seven Stars. Let me see how strong you really are,” Bing Shan said coldly.

“Haha. As you wish.” One Star Man laughed heartily as he too appeared in that vast space.

These two powerful experts started their fight.

They fought each other fairly and no more dared to interrupt.

Now that Bing Shang and One Star Man were headed for the vast space at one side, the only people left at Heaven’s Horizon were Jian Wushuang and Leng Ruxue. They stood apart, looking at each other.

“Jian Wushuang. I never thought that there would be a day that we would face off against each other,” Leng Ruxue looked at Jian Wushuang playfully.

“I have been waiting for this day for a very long time. Since you took over Rushuang’s body and left the Green Fire World tens of thousands of years ago, I predicted this day would come.” Jian Wushuang looked at Leng Ruxue coldly and indifferently.

“Is that the case? I already took notice of you when you entered the Eternal Chaotic World and made yourself known. At that point in time, I could have killed you easily without giving you the chance to become stronger, much less become who you are today,” Leng Ruxue raised her eyebrows and said.

Jian Wushuang’s face turned dark.

He knew she was speaking the truth.

Leng Ruxue had been in the Eternal Chaotic World for quite some time before he came. She had joined the Holocaust Sect and had incredible status and techniques.

If she had used the power of the Holocust Sect to assassinate him, he would already have died.

“Do you know why I have yet to kill you and have allowed you to live until today?” Leng Ruxue smiled.

“Rushuang,” Jian Wushuang said softly.

“Smart. Even though I have suppressed that dumb woman’s consciousness and she does not usually get in my way, she would resist with all her might if I were to do something that would harm you. This would cause great trouble for me. Hence, I allowed you to continue to grow,” Leng Ruxue said playfully.

“However, I did not expect you to grow so powerful so quickly. By the time I had complete control over this body with the help of my Master and the opportunities she left behind, you had already grown and it was extremely difficult to kill you at that point in time.”

Even though Leng Ruxue said this casusally, Jian Wushuang’s heart was trembling.

“Rushuang, she... Even though she is suppressed, she is still trying her best to protect me?” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists tightly, to the point where his nails were biting into his flesh.

“That dumb woman is asleep right now. Even if I were to kill you now, she would have no idea. Even if she knew, there is no way she will cause any trouble for me anymore. However, it is still troublesome that we share this body together. I tried to wipe away her consciousness but I was afraid that I would be wounded as well since we share a common body. Hence, she is still alive.”

“However...” Leng Ruxue’s tone suddenly changed.

“Jian Wushuang, do you know what the first thing I will do after I reach the Absolute Beginning Divine World is?”

Jian Wushuang turned pale.

“Haha. Looks like you’ve guessed it. Yes, the first thing I will do is to ask my master to help me wipe out her consciousness. Given how powerful my master is, she can wipe her out without having any negative effects on me even if we share the same body.”

“At that point in time, this body will be truly mine and I will not need to share this body with a that dumb woman anymore.” Leng Ruxue laughed hysterically.

Jian Wushuang’s expression turned extremely cold.

An extremely strong killing intent started gathering around Jian Wushuang.

“What, are you angry that I am going to wipe out your wife’s consciousness? Do you want to suppress me? Do you have the ability to do so?” Leng Ruxue burst out laughing.

Jian Wushuang then exhaled lightly. His face became calm and he said, “The reason you talked so much was to buy time for the passageway to fully open. If you anger me, it will be much easier to escape into that passageway. Do you think I will fall into your trap?”

“Uh...” Leng Ruxue’s smile faded as she smiled once again, “Looks like you saw through my plan. So what? Do you think you can stop me?”

“Of course!’

Jian Wushuang grunted as he attacked.

With a simple dash, he appeared in front of Leng Ruxue.

The Blood Mountain Sword in his hand slashed towards her head with incredible penetrating power.

Xiu!

The cold blade passed through Leng Ruxue’s head but there were no bloodstains at all.

“Hehe. You really are ruthless. Your wife also resides in this body. You both are married. There is a saing: a couple should have deep affection for each other even if they are together for only a short period of time. You should hold back a little to ensure that your wife’s body is not destroyed.”

Leng Ruxue appeared in the space to one side as she said playfully.

“She is so fast.”

Jian Wushuang was surprised, but his vision became sharper and more resolute.

“If the body is destroyed, I can find another one. What I want is my wife’s consciousness, her soul!”

Jian Wushuang said coldly as a wave of powerful sword essence swept out in all directions.

Whoosh!

The entire battlefield became a vast ocean filled with sword essence.

The sword ocean spread far and wide, and Jian Wushuang was the master within this ocean.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were bloodshot as the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand turned crimson red.

Whoosh!

A crimson sword light burst forth as it dyed the entire Heaven and Earth red.

This battlefield turned dark crimson red.

This sword light stirred the power of the ocean of sword essence and appeared in front of Leng Ruxue immediately. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))
