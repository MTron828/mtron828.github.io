“Talent in comprehension?”

Emperor Xiao was aghast that Jian Wushuang had improved his talent in comprehension significantly.

“Such a fantastic skill!”

“It’s possible to build a perfect foundation by working hard. However, the innate talent... how could the Heavenly Creation Skill change it?” Emperor Xiao gasped in admiration.

The foundation could be built with hard work.

But innate talent was born.

It was possible to build a perfect foundation by working hard.

But to change one’s talent in comprehension?

Emperor Xiao thought it was beyond logic.

“Since you have made the breakthrough, say goodbye to your friends before you leave. It may be years before you can return.” Emperor Xiao said.

“Ok.” Jian Wushuang nodded and left.

Jian Wushuang didn’t go back to the Nanyang Continent as he had already settled his matters there.

In a huge black castle, three people sat at a table which held jugs of wine. Their intention was clear – to get thoroughly drunk!

The trio consisted of Jian Wushuang, Yang Zaixuan and Wang Yuan.

“Third bro, let’s drink our body weight in wine. I’ve brought the best from my collection.” Wang Yuan said, pretending that he could not bear to part with his best wine.

“It’s a rare chance. Let’s have a good drink today.” Jian Wushuang said with a laugh.

Jian Wushuang had met Wang Yuan not long after he returned to the black castle.

Wang Yuan had lost considerable weight over the recent years. He had been heavy-set but he now had a more average appearance.

It was because he had been working hard in recent years.

During these years, Wang Yuan had been learning alchemy from a mysterious alchemist, who did not seem to be from the Ancient World.

The alchemist was strong and skilled but bad-tempered. Under his tutelage, Wang Yuan had suffered.

“I wish Fourth sister was here.” Wang Yuan said with a sigh.

“Fourth sister?” Jian Wushuang recalled the shy girl, Su Rou.

Su Rou had a unique body. After her body had awakened in the Nanyang Continent, she had been taken away by a mysterious expert. None of them knew where she had been taken.

Jian Wushuang had asked Emperor Xiao about Su Rou and his father, but Emperor Xiao had refused to tell him, saying that Jian Wushuang would know when it was the right time.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t do anything about it.

“Third Bro, the Eternal World is more dangerous than the Ancient World. Be careful.” Wang Yuan warned him.

“It’s a pity that my master has a task for me. Otherwise, I would get an Ancient World Token to attend the Firmament Territory Feast with you.” Yang Zaixuan said.

Jian Wushuang smiled in acknowledgment.

During these three years, he had become familiar with Yang Zaixuan’s strength.?The latter was strong enough to attend the Firmament Territory Feast. But as he was Emperor Xiao’s personal disciple, he had been tasked to do something else.

“Don’t worry. I experienced so much alone in the Divine Land, I know how to protect myself.” Jian Wushuang reassured them with a smile. Inwardly,?he cautioned himself not to be complacent.

He knew that the Eternal World was not the Divine Land.

They drank and talked for the entire night.

The next morning, Emperor Xiao, Di Jing, Yang Zaixuan and Wang Yuan stood in the black castle’s garden. They looked at Jian Wushuang.

This was the day that Jian Wushuang would leave the Ancient World.

“Master Emperor Xiao, the Sword Marquis Mansion is counting on you.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Set your heart at rest. I will protect the Sword Marquis Mansion.” Emperor Xiao said.

“Thank you so much, Emperor Xiao.” Jian Wushuang said with a bow.

He trusted Emperor Xiao.

Under Emperor Xiao’s secret protection, no one in the Ancient World would be able to destroy the Sword Marquis Mansion.

Right at this moment, the Ancient World Token in Jian Wushuang’s hand suddenly shone and emitted a surge of power. In the next instant, clouds gathered and the wind blew.

“Has it begun?”

Jian Wushuang raised his head and saw a Portal above him.

The portal contained a special aura. This was Jian Wushuang’s second time experiencing it.

In his previous experience, Su Ming had crumbled the pledge in the Darkness Temple and Xue Yang, a Divine Realm expert of the Universal Thunder Sect, had emerged from a Portal. The aura in that Portal was the same as today’s.

Jian Wushuang knew that it was the aura of the Eternal World!

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang looked at them and said, “Goodbye, everyone!”

“Bye!” Emperor Xiao waved.

“Third bro, take care.” Wang Yuan and Yang Zaixuan said in unison.

Jian Wushuang nodded and looked around. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Ancient World, Divine Land and Nanyang Continent... bye!”

Then Jian Wushuang jumped and flew into the Portal.

Soon, he disappeared and the Portal closed. Emperor Xiao and the rest who remained behind looked at one another.

“The Eternal World, I’m coming!”

Jian Wushuang had left.

He had left the Ancient World. Perhaps he would return. But that would be years later.

His heroic deeds would be celebrated in every corner of the Ancient World.
