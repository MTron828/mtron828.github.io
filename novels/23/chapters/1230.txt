Chapter 1231: Break the Formation in Restrictions!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Do we still have a chance?”

Jian Wushuang’s face lit up, but then he frowned again. “Even if you can think of other ways, Flame Deity Puppet has fallen into the hands of the Jin Kingdom monarch. If we don’t have anything to hold the Jin Kingdom, we can’t get near to the vortex.”

“Correct.” Samsara Temple Master and others also nodded.

The Jin Kingdom monarch stayed in the black and white vortex. And according to their plan, Flame Deity Puppet would hold the Jin Kingdom monarch back to gain them some time.

But now, Flame Deity Puppet had been lost.

There stood the Jin Kingdom monarch. The moment they approach, he would kill them in an instant.

“The Jin Kingdom monarch is a top expert above the Universe Master level, I can’t confront him.” Xuan Yi smiled and continued, “However, who says that you must get close to the core of the black and white vortex to break it? I will stay in this Battle Fortress and break the Enduring Samsara Formation for you.”

“What?”

Xuan Yi said it casually, but the people around him were all shocked.

Break the Enduring Samsara Formation behind the Battle Fortress?

The core of the Enduring Samsara Formation, the black and white vortex, was 100,000 miles away.

Was it possible to destroy it far away from it under the protection of the Restrictions?

Was this some kind of joke?

“Xuan Yi master, one who wants to destroy a Formation, must first destroy the core of the Formation. Now we’re 100,000 miles away from the black and white vortex, how can we manage it?” Palace Master Yun frowned and asked.

He also had great knowledge of Formation.

Before he knew about Xuan Yi, he believed that he was the top master of Formation in the Green Fire World.

He knew about Formation and contended that it would be impossible to break it from a distance.

But Xuan Yi had said that…

“Can’t we really destroy it without getting close to the core of the Formation? I don’t think so.” Xuan Yi shook his head and smiled.

“Xuan Yi Master, are you really sure?” Palace Master Yun still could not believe it.

“I’ll try and you’ll see. Anyway, you don’t need to do anything for me. Even if I fail, there will be no consequences.” Xuan Yi smiled.

“True.” The Palace Masters who were present nodded.

If Xuan Yi decided to break the Formation behind the Battle Fortress, he naturally did not need soldiers to cover up for him or anything.

“My disciple.” Xuan Yi looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes?” Jian Wushuang acted respectfully.

No matter how other Palace Masters thought of Xuan Yi, Jian Wushuang put his absolute trust in his own master.

If he said that he could break the Formation 100,000 miles away, he must have had a way.

“Haven’t I grant you the Mountain River Map?” I’ll borrow it.” Xuan Yi replied.

“Mountain River Map?” Jian Wushuang cocked one eyebrow.

The Mountain River Map was the most precious of the three treasures that Xuan Yi gave him.

It was a Chaos Divine Treasure. Though it was somewhat defective, it was still invaluable.

However, it was at a high level. Since Jian Wushuang obtained it, he had only used it once, in order to suppress Dao Yuanzi. And he had had help from King Luo Zhen’s Essence Blood to display it. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Now, though he had reached the Dao Master level, he still found it very difficult to utilize the Mountain River Map.

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang quickly took out the Mountain River Map and handed it to Xuan Yi.

“Master, do I need to cancel my ownership?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Under normal circumstances, treasures only performed the best in its owner’s hands.

Since Xuan Yi wanted to use the map,Jian Wushuang thought that he might need to cancel his ownership.

“Cancel your ownership? There’s no need.” Xuan Yi shook his head. “If you cancel your ownership, my effort would have been futile.”

“Futile?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He failed to follow his master.

“Don’t worry, just stand here and watch me.” Xuan Yi did not explain and slowly floated to the midair.

Xuan Yi floated directly to the Void above. He stayed close to the Restrictions and stopped before he almost crashed into them.

Numerous Green Fire World experts inside the Battle Fortress had witnessed him.

The Celestial Masters and Dao Masters all looked in doubt.

“What is the master of Jian Wushuang, Master Xuan Yi, going to do?”

“He seems to try to destroy the Formation. But it’s 100,000 miles away. How can he do it inside the Battle Fortress?”

“I heard that Master Xuan Yi plans to destroy the Formation just inside the Battle Fortress!”

“Inside the Battle Fortress? What’re you talking about?”

The Celestial Masters and Dao Masters all looked in disbelief.

All the Palace Masters were stunned and bore doubt in their hearts.

Outside the Battle Fortress, at the core of the black and white vortex, the glamorous woman Jiu Xi, and the Jin Kingdom monarch hidden in the dark, also noticed the noise in the Battle Fortress.

Despite the cover of the Restrictions, they could still faintly see Xuan Yi drifting at the edge of them, and even saw Xuan Yi’s realm.

“Eternal Realm?”

“What is the Green Fire World doing?”

The Jin Kingdom monarch and Jiu Xi were also baffled.

At this time, Xuan Yi floated to the Void above and flicked his hand. Then, a streak of Flowing Light shot into the Void.

“That is…”

The Jin Kingdom monarch and Jiu Xi both watched the thing Xuan Yi threw out.

It was a marvelous map. Xuan Yi stretched to unfold the map completely. Then, it instantly merged into the Heavens and Earth and disappeared.

This move seemed quite eccentric.

But suddenly, buzz…

A strange light shone brightly on the ground, on the vast battlefield.

Such a dazzling light attracted all the people present. The Jin Kingdom monarch and Jiu Xi also looked up.

The endless sky above their heads started to change!

“What?”

Everyone was eye-widened and full of horror watching the changes in the sky.

Even the Jin Kingdom monarch looked horrified at this moment.

The vast sky had been completely replaced by a huge and wonderful World Scroll.

This World Scroll seemed endless. The black and white vortex had already expanded a lot, but the World Scroll occupied the entire sky!

Vast aura spread slowly from within the World Scroll.
