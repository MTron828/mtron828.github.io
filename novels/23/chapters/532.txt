Chapter 533: Endless Demonic Beasts

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Emergency! Emergency!”

“The Monster Army is coming. Everyone from the East Camp is being ordered to go to Sky Fire Plains right now!”

“Everyone, go to Sky Fire Plains this instant!”

Both Jian Wushuang and the leader of the third squad received the emergency alarm at the same time.

They were both shocked.

The East Camp, which was responsible for guarding the eastern border of the human’s territory, often collided with the Demonic Beasts. Under normal circumstances, they could easily cope with the Demonic Beasts’ onslaught.

But, at this moment, everyone in the East Camp was being summoned to the battlefield. It was not difficult to imagine how urgent the alarm was.

Monster Army!

These two words carried a lot of meaning.

“I thought that we would get to relax in the Sky Solitude Mountains for a month. It seems like that won’t be possible now,” said the squad leader as he smiled slightly. He then turned towards the sergeants behind him and shouted, “Brothers, it’s time to earn some Monster Cores!”

The sergeants had realized there was an emergency, so his words excited them.

Especially the sergeants under the command of Jian Wushuang, who had spent the last two months, leisurely, in Sky Solitude Mountains. They instantly became excited when they heard that they would finally have a chance to earn some Monster Cores.

“Everyone in the tenth squad,” Jian Wushuang shouted loudly, “Go, kill the Demonic Beasts!”

“The third squad, follow me,” the leader of the third squad also said.

The two squads, which were supposed to be in the middle of transferring the duty of guarding the Sky Solitude Mountains, headed toward the Sky Fire Plains together.

The Sky Fire Plains seemed boundless.

They were on the eastern border of the human territory on the Monster Continent. On the other side was the vast territory occupied by the Demonic Beasts.

The Demonic Beasts often attacked the humans, and the battlefield was usually the Sky Fire Plains.

However, currently, numerous Demonic Beasts were releasing earth-shaking roars from the Sky Fire Plains as they rushed toward the East Camp’s defense structure.

When Jian Wushuang and his subordinates arrived at the Sky Fire Plains, they were shocked by the scene in front of them.

“Too many, way too many Demonic Beasts,” Jian Wushuang could not help exclaiming.

Countless Demonic Beasts were pouring in from all directions. Fortunately, the East Camp had set up a huge Formation in the Sky Fire Plains, which was powerful enough to cover the entire plain. Behind this Formation, numerous sergeants were waiting for commands.

The tenth and third squads went to gather with other squads of the Seventh Army.

Fang Han, the commander of the Seventh Army, stood in front, but his face was still pale and his aura was weak.

“Damn it. Why did the Monster Army have to come now?”?Fang Han thought with a gloomy face.

He had been seriously wounded by Jian Wushuang today. Even now, he had only barely recovered his strength.

For him, it was definitely the worst time to fight against the Monster Army.

“What happened? Why are so many Demonic Beasts attacking us so suddenly?”

“It’s rare to see an assault by so many Demonic Beasts in the entire human history!”

“I heard that two Monster Kings are getting married today and they ordered the monsters to attack the humans.”

The sergeants of East Camp were busy discussing with each other.

Countless Demonic Beasts were fiercely assaulting the huge Formation, eager to tear up the Formation and kill all Human Warriors inside it. Nevertheless, the Formation was extraordinary and remained solid even though it was being violently attacked by so many Demonic Beasts.

Of course, the most solid part was the core of the Formation. The Formation was too vast and was being attacked by so many Demonic Beasts from all directions. It was only natural that this fierce assault caused some small breaches to appear in the more vulnerable parts.

Even though the breaches could be quickly repaired by the Formation, it still took some time.

“Report!”

“A breach appears in the Zone No. 17 of the Formation!”

“Send the Fourth Army to guard Zone No. 17 and kill all the Demonic Beasts that were able to enter the Formation!”

“Yes!”

“Report!”

“A large breach appeared in Zone No. 8. Hundreds of Demonic Beasts have entered the Formation.”

“Send the First and Third Army to block the breach and kill all the Demonic Beasts that entered!”

“Yes, sir!”

“Report!”

“Command...”

Commands were quickly transmitted.

At the innermost battlefield of the Sky Fire Plains, the top experts of the East Camp had gathered. Even two Temple Masters who rarely appeared were there along with numerous generals were also waiting.

They were confident that they could resist a direct attack from the Demonic Beasts because there were two Temple Masters, several generals, and the assistance of the Formation.

But the key to victory was those breaches that were being caused by the Demonic Beasts assault.

After all, the Sky Fire Plains were too vast, which made it difficult for the Formation to cover the whole plain while still remaining firm. With it being attacked by the Demonic Beasts from all directions, the Formation could not remain completely unbroken in every corner.

The emergence of some small breaches was inevitable.

As small as the breaches were, the Demonic Beasts would be able to enter the human’s territory through them, which would bring about a massacre. Therefore, all of the breaches had to be guarded.

“Report. A breach appeared in Zone No. 9 of the Formation!”

“Send the Seventh Army to guard the breach in Zone No. 9.”

After receiving the command, the sergeants of the Seventh Army, who had been preparing to fight, became excited.

“Follow me!”

As the commander, Fang Han, though seriously wounded, led the whole Army and headed for Zone No. 9.

Zone No. 9 was quite far away from the front battlefield. Even though the sergeants marched at full speed, it still took them a while to arrive. During this period, over a thousand Demonic Beasts had swarmed into the Formation through the breach.
