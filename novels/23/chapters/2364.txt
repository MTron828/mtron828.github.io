Chapter 2365: Ming Long

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

After hearing what Wu Jian said, Yu Yang had an odd look.

Elder Nine, Wu Jian, personally brought an outer disciple to the Outer Garden. He even treated him kindly and called him a little friend?

Who was Jian Wushuang? What was his background?

“Yu Yang, I shall hand Jian Wushuang over to you. If anything happens to him, you will be answerable.” Wu Jian said as he looked at Yu Yang.

“Don’t worry, Elder Nine. I will take good care of him.” Yu Yang smiled awkwardly.

“Little friend Wushuang, this is my transmission token. If anything happens, you can look for me.” Wu Jian said as he passed a transmission token to Jian Wushuang.

“Thank you Elder Wu Jian.” Jian Wushuang thanked Wu Jian.

“What happens next depends on you. If you want to become a core disciple of the Water Fairy Island, you can come and look for me.” Wu Jian said.

Soon, Wu Jian left.

Jian Wushuang and Yu Yang stood side by side in front of the courtyard.

“Elder Yu Yang, I will be in your care.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“You are too modest. Elder Nine personally handed you over to me. Of course, I will take care of you. Let me arrange a place for you to stay in. Do you have any requests?” Yu Yang said kindly.

“I just want to live alone.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“No problem.” Yu Yang smiled.

There were numerous outer disciples. Most of them lived together with other outer disciples.

However, there are isolated houses for those outstanding outer disciples. Even though Yu Yang was not sure how powerful or talented Jian Wushuang was, he was brought here by Elder Wu Jian. This alone was enough to give Jian Wushuang the right to live alone in a house.

Yu Yang started to arrange for Jian Wushuang’s accommodation.

Soon, he led Jian Wushuang to an independent courtyard. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Little friend Wushuang, I will leave now. If anything happens in the Outer Garden, you can come and look for me.” Yu Yang said,

“Thank you Elder Yu Yang.” Jian Wushuang thanked him gratefully.

Yu Yang left. Jian Wushuang stood alone within the courtyard.

Jian Wushuang released his soul power and covered the area around him, including many outer disciples.

“Huh?”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. He walked forward and soon reached a neighboring courtyard.

There was a small open patch within the courtyard. There was a man in green clothes who was concentrated on practicing a blade skill.

Even though the blade skill was not of high grade, this man made the simple blade skill seem extremely intricate and powerful.

“Middle-stage Chaotic Realm?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the man with interest.

He knew that the man was not old. At the same time, he was not considered young.

Any genius should have either reached or surpassed Peak Chaotic Realm at his age. However, it seemed like he broke through to the Middle-stage Chaotic Realm only recently. He was not talented in cultivation. He was an ordinary cultivator.

However, Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up when he saw the man’s sword skills.

“His understanding of the blade doctrine and his blade skills were of low level. He barely made the cut to enter the blade doctrine realm. However, this blade skill is still extremely powerful when he cast it. In order to do this, he has to practice the same move over and over to reach this level of mastery.”

“This meant that ... He is a very hardworking man, to the point it made up for his lack of talent!”

Jian Wushuang smiled lightly.

He could see that the cold man was not a genius. However, he was someone who was willing to put in the hard work to grind his craft.

Soon, the cold man finished his drill.

“Senior Brother Ming Long, your sword skills are getting even better.”

“Yes. No one in the Outer Garden and Inner Garden can match your blade skills.”

“It might be a little exaggerating to say that no one in the Inner Garden can match him in blade skills. However, in the Outer Garden, he is definitely the most powerful person.”

Many other disciples were also attracted by Ming Long’s drills. They walked up to him and started to praise him.

“Alright. Stop flattering me. If you are willing to put in the hard work, all of you can do so too.” Ming Long smiled lightly. His eyes were calm. He was not proud even though everyone else around him was praising him.

“This man has a good mentality.” Jian Wushuang thought to himself as he observed.

Right then, Ming Long noticed Jian Wushuang.

“Junior Brother, I have never seen you before. Are you also part of the Outer Garden?” Ming Long walked towards Jian Wushuang and asked.

Jian Wushuang smiled as he replied, “Greetings, senior brothers. I am Jian Wushuang and I arrived on Water Fairy Island today.”

“I see.” Ming Long said.

“I have heard that there was an outer disciple that was brought in here by Elder Wu Jian. That should be you.” A disciple among the crowd said.

“Elder Wu Jian personally led you in?”

The other outer disciples saw Jian Wushuang in a different light.

The outer disciples were of lower status, as it was difficult for them to even meet an Elder Deacon, much less an elder from the Elder Group.

Jian Wushuang could get Elder Wu Jian to lead him in personally?

“Junior Brother Wushuang. You must be so powerful that even Elder Wu Jian values you. Are you willing to have a spar with me?” Ming Long looked at Jian Wushuang with passion in his eyes.

“A spar? I am still weak and is no match against you, Senior Brother. Can we not do it?” Jian Wushuang shook his head in surprise.

“Is that the case? Alright. Junior Brother Wushuang. Elder Wu Jian should have told you that even though the outer disciples had a low status, there is a way for us to change that and become a core disciple. Three months later, there will be a selection battle. If you obtain the first position in that selection battle, your chances of becoming a core disciple will increase. Work hard.” Ming Long encouraged.

“Thank you, senior brother.” Jian Wushuang smiled thankfully but he did not take those words to heart.

Jian Wushuang came to the Outer Garden because he did not want to become a core disciple.

He would not participate in the selection battle.

Even so, Jian Wushuang could see the burning desire that Ming Long had to pass the selection battle.

Jian Wushuang and the other Outer Disciples then chatted. All of them were of the same status, hence they did not put up a front.

After the chat, everyone left. Jian Wushuang also left the Outer Garden and headed for the Water Fairy Tower.
