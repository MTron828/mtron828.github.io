Chapter 3555: Shocking

In just a split second, the monster was killed by Jian Wushuang.

Of course, this was normal. After all, Jian Wushuang’s battle strength was definitely at the peak of the sixth void realm after using the heaven-cleaving skill. In addition, he also had the shadowless escape skill, so he could make a sudden attack, moreover, the monster had been severely injured by him from the beginning, and its strength had been greatly reduced.

Under such circumstances, it was naturally very easy for Jian Wushuang to kill it.

After killing the monster, Jian Wushuang went directly to the Silver Axe and picked it up.

“It really is a top-tier universe supreme treasure.” The moment Jian Wushuang held the Silver Axe, he had already felt the power of the Silver Axe.

Unfortunately, he did not use the axe as a weapon. When the Silver Axe fell into his hands, he could only use it to exchange for contribution points and then go to the Star Palace’s Supreme Treasure Vault to exchange for other supreme treasures.

Moreover, he had just arrived at the core area of Devil Smoke Valley, so it was impossible for him to immediately go back and exchange it for contribution points.

“The Xue Kong Master must have seen me kill this monster. It seems that I have to think of a way to deal with him.” Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Well, he’s already here.”

Jian Wushuang looked ahead and saw that the Xue Kong Master had come.

However, when the Xue Kong Master appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, he looked shocked.

It was just as Jian Wushuang had said. He had seen Jian Wushuang kill the monster the whole time. It was because of him that he was shocked and found it unbelievable.

When he saw Jian Wushuang choose to attack the monster directly, he wondered if Jian Wushuang was dizzy and thought that he could kill the monster with his own strength, however, when he saw Jian Wushuang seriously injure the monster, he was immediately shocked.

Later, when he saw Jian Wushuang attack again and easily kill the monster, he was completely stunned.

He was indeed stunned.

He had never expected that Jian Wushuang, who seemed to have used all of his strength when he fought with him, could only fight with him. He was even slightly weaker than Jian Wushuang, he had actually killed the monster alone, which could rival an advanced expert of the sixth realm.

Now, he appeared in front of Jian Wushuang again. Apart from being shocked, he also had mixed feelings.

“Blood Sword Master, did you hide your strength when you fought with me?” Xue Kong asked.

“Not exactly. I did use my strongest strength when I fought with you, but I didn’t use some of my trump cards. I was able to kill this monster because I used this trump card,” Jian Wushuang said.

He did not lie. The heaven-cleaving skill was indeed his trump card. Under normal circumstances, he did not intend to use this trump card.

“Trump card?” Xue Kong Master still looked at Jian Wushuang deeply.

He could see that when Jian Wushuang killed the monster, he did indeed burst out with the combat strength of the pinnacle of the six realm.

And for a person whose combat strength was only in the initial stage of the sixth realm to burst out with the combat strength of the peak of the path, this trump card was really too strong.

“Xue Kong Master, although you and I discovered the axe at the same time, according to what you said before, whoever kills the monster first and gets the axe will get the axe. Now the axe is mine,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Of course. You have such a powerful trump card. No matter how much I think about the axe, I don’t have the ability. It’s a pity that the expert I invited came here for nothing.” Xue Kong Master’s expression had softened.

Knowing that it was impossible to get the axe from Jian Wushuang again, the Xue Kong Master was relieved.

“Xue Kong Master, there’s one more thing I need your help with,” Jian Wushuang suddenly said.

“Help?” Xue Kong looked at Jian Wushuang strangely.

“It’s like this. Until now, not many people know about my trump card, but now that you know it, I want you to keep it for me. After all, it’s best not to let too many people know about my trump card. I also don’t want others to know about my axe, which is a top-tier universe supreme treasure,” Jian Wushuang said.

“I understand. I can promise you that I won’t tell anyone about this, but I’ll still tell the force behind me about it,” Xue Kong Master said.

Jian Wushuang could not help but be speechless.

If Xue Kong Master told the force behind him about his trump card, it would be no different from directly revealing it?

“Of course, I can report it later. Now, I’ll only remind the people who have a certain relationship with me and are adventuring in the depths of Devil Smoke Valley. How about it?” Xue Kong Master said.

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang immediately smiled.

It was only to tell a limited number of people. If it was not completely publicized, Jian Wushuang could still accept it.

To be honest, although the Xue Kong Master saw him kill the monster with his heaven-cleaving skill, he did not know how many times he could use this trump card because Jian Wushuang killed the monster so quickly, or how long he could use it.

At present, the Xue Kong Master probably only knew that he could release his battle strength at the pinnacle of the six realm in a short time, but he did not know how long it would take.

“Xue Kong Master, goodbye.”

Jian Wushuang said and left. This time, the Xue Kong Master did not follow him.

He looked at Jian Wushuang’s back and sighed. Then, he left.

Soon, Xue Kong Master returned to the place where he had met Red Nether Master.

“Xue Kong, are you going to kill Blood Sword Master?” Red Nether Master immediately came up to him.

“Yes.” Xue Kong Master nodded.

“What’s the result? Although Blood Sword Master is not weak, he’s still weaker than you, right?” Red Nether Master said.

“I can’t say much about this, because something unexpected happened midway,” Xue Kong Master said.

“What happened?” Red Nether Master asked.

“We encountered a monster on the way to battle,” Xue Kong Master said.

“And then?” Red Nether Master looked at Xue Kong Master.

“And then...” Xue Kong Master hesitated for a while, but he still didn’t tell him what had happened, however, he still said, “I promised Blood Sword Master. There are some things that I can’t tell him directly. However, you and I have some friendship. Let me remind you that if you meet Blood Sword Master alone in the future, you should try to avoid him. This Blood Sword Master is not as simple as you think.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Oh?” Xue Kong Master was surprised.

Blood Sword Master was not as simple as he thought?

He even said that he would try to avoid him if he met him alone in the future?

What exactly happened when Xue Kong met Blood Sword Master?

Red Nether Master could not figure it out, but Xue Kong Master did not say much and soon left.
