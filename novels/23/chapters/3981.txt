“This…”

At this moment, Jian Wushuang was in a daze.

He had thought that the blood-red pill was purely a pill that could increase his strength in a short period of time. However, after taking it, he found that it was not the case.

At least the blood-red elixir contained not only the power of the elixir, but also an ancient will power and a vast message.

The vast message was first about the use and origin of the elixir.

“The Primordial Spirit Treasure Elixir!”

Jian Wushuang did not know the real name of the blood-red elixir until now.

However, Jian Wushuang was surprised by the origin and use of the elixir.

The Primordial Spirit Treasure Pill is a top-grade autarch-level pill. Anyone who takes it, be it a Principles Master, a Ruler of chaos, or a Supreme Ruler, will immediately enter a state of ‘epiphany’! Whether it was the speed of training or the speed of comprehension can be directly increased a hundred times!

This elixir was one of the most popular elixirs in the vast universe. Even a Ruler at the Supreme Realm longed for it.

The simple introduction shocked Jian Wushuang. “This elixir is completely different from what senior Wind Devil said.”

When Wind Devil gave him the blood-red elixir in that special space, wind demon clearly said that this elixir could increase his strength in a short period of time, but it had great side effects, once he swallowed it, he might even die.

Jian Wushuang remembered clearly that Wind Devil did say so. Therefore, he had always regarded this elixir as his strongest trump card. Until the last moment, he did not want to swallow the elixir and risk his life.

But now, when he really swallowed the elixir, the information he got was completely different.

The blood-red elixir was called the treasure elixir of the great spirit. It was a elixir that could make people fall into a state of enlightenment in a short period of time. It was purely used to help with cultivation and comprehension. Moreover, it was of a very high level.

If Jian Wushuang had obtained this elixir, he would have been overjoyed.

After all, achieving the state of enlightenment was very rare.

But now…he had swallowed the elixir to fight with Star Demon Ancestor. What was the point of enlightenment at this time?

Jian Wushuang felt bitter. He did not know why Wind Devil made such a big mistake.

But the information that came to his mind made Jian Wushuang completely understand.

Wind Devil left him the following information.

“Jian Wushuang, since you can see this information, you must have swallowed the elixir I gave you. Did you not think of it? Are you dumbfounded?”

“Haha!” Wind Devil obviously did this on purpose, the message was full of ridicule.

“Anyway, let me tell you first. Indeed, I lied to you. The elixir I gave you is not something that can increase your strength in a short period of time, but the price is very high. It can even kill you. I can’t give you such an elixir. After all, you have comprehended a trace of the universe principles at the level of a Principles Master. Such a super genius is a treasure even for the Lingyun Star lineage. Why would I give you such an elixir?”

“Of course, the main reason I lied to you was to train you. If I told you the real purpose of this elixir, you would have swallowed it earlier and solved the problem with your strength. What’s the point of training?”

Jian Wushuang had a strange look on his face.

He now understood that Wind Devil had been lying to him from the beginning. There was such an elixir that could be of great use to him, but he told him that it was used to fight at critical moments.

At that time, he had not thought that Wind Devil would lie to him because of his identity.

Of course, Wind Devil had lied to him for his own good.

Jian Wushuang continued to listen.

“Jian Wushuang, listen carefully. The Primordial Spirit Treasure Pill that you have swallowed is one of the top elixirs in the vast universe. It is coveted by countless supreme-beings and is even coveted by them. Of course, although the pill itself is precious, star master left a trace of will in it. This trace of will is the most precious and most important thing. It is much rarer than the Primordial Spirit Treasure Pill,” Wind Devil continued.

“Will?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He swallowed the spirit-treasure pill, and an ancient and majestic will instantly rose up and now completely covered the entire universe void.

This ancient will was left behind by Star Master Lingyun?

No wonder it was so strong.

“This pill was originally prepared by the star master for his personal disciple. Unfortunately, the great battle came too suddenly back then, and the star master did not have the time to take in a personal disciple. This pill was kept in that special space-time with us until you passed the test of the eighteen ultimate formation set by the star master. At that time, we thought that you had the qualifications to become the star master’s personal disciple, but it was just barely qualified. In addition, you were an Immortal Saint back then, and your strength was too weak. If we had given you this pill back then, it would have been too wasteful. That’s why we didn’t give it to you directly back then, but let you choose an inner star secret art instead.”

“However, when you came to that special space-time, you not only broke through to become a Principles Master, but you also comprehended a trace of the universe principles. Tsk, tsk, a Principles Master comprehended a trace of the universe principles, and you’re a perfect life-level cultivator. I’m afraid that there’s no one else with such talent in the entire universe. Therefore, at that time, we were sure that you could become the star master’s personal disciple. Therefore, when you asked us to save you, I discussed with the other brothers and gave you the Primordial Spirit Treasure Pill.”

“Jian Wushuang, I lied to you. I told you to swallow the elixir at the critical moment. You must be in a very dangerous situation. But it doesn’t matter. As long as the star master’s will is awakened, no one can hurt you.”

“The elixir will not only help you enter a state of enlightenment, but more importantly, after the star master’s will is awakened, it will give you a great opportunity. This opportunity is actually the guidance left by the star master. It is his understanding of the principles of heaven and earth, the principles of the universe, weapons refinement, alchemy, formation, and various daos, such as saber principle, sword principle, and spear principle. The star master has lived for countless years and is an invincible supreme. He has unique insights and comprehension in all aspects

“After you consume the Primordial Spirit Treasure Pill, you will be able to come into contact with the star master’s will. The star master’s will will teach you for a hundred years.

“Of course, this is a hundred years in a special state, but in the outside world, it’s only a day!”
