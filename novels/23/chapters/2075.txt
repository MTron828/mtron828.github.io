2076 The Nine War Spirits

Jian Wushuang had inherited Wuhun’s Ancient God bloodline. This bloodline was pure and gave him complete bloodline power.

The first bloodline of the Ancient God Emperor was less pure compared to that of Jian Wushuang.

Under the effect of suppression of bloodline power…

Most royal Ancient Gods would have to walk slowly, one step at a time up the steps. Some of those whose wills were weaker might not even reach the top of the steps.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang had walked up quickly. It was as though there was no suppression at all, and he walked without feeling any resistance.

Even thought the suppression got stronger as the number of steps climbed increased, Jian Wushuang was not affected.

Within moments he finished more than half the steps and he was not slowing down.

“This brat…”

King Chen Xing was standing on the void. Upon seeing how easily Jian Wushuang was walking up the stairs, he squinted his eyes and muttered, “As much as I do not want him to be the next Ancient God Emperor, I have to admit his bloodline is extremely pure. It might even be on par with my father’s bloodline.”

“King Chen Xing, the Sword Emperor is going to finish walking all the steps,” King Zhan Cang said.

“This is normal. My father’s first measure is simply suppression of bloodline power. Any royal Ancient God can persist through this first measure as long as they have the will. His bloodline is even purer than most Ancient Gods with the royal bloodline, hence this will barely pose any problem to him,” King Chen Xing said indifferently.

“However, my father left behind three measures. This first measure is the easiest. The next two will not be so easy for him to pass.”

King Chen Xing understood the measures well as he too had once tried to enter forcibly.

Just like King Chen Xing said, Jian Wushuang walked up the hundred steps easily without stopping,

As soon as he set foot at open area the top, a few blurry mirages started to solidify.

Hum! Hum! Hum! Hum! ~~~

A total of nine blue mirages solidified. Their faces were unrecognizable. Every single one of them were extremely large and they each held a different Chaos Divine Weapon.

All nine figures scanned the area and locked on to Jian Wushuang.

“Intruders! Those who dare to disturb the Ancient God Emperor in his sleep shall die!”

A cold, robotic voice came out of one of the figure’s mouth as the nine of them attacked.

Their aura was terrifying, and every aura was targeted and focused on Jian Wushuang. He frowned deeply as he took the situation seriously.

He could tell that the nine figures were very powerful.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! ~~

The nine figures attacked...

One of the figures held a bat that was ten meters long and as thick as a bucket. It looked like a small hill from Jian Wushuang’s perspective. However, it looked like a small plant in the hands of the figure. The figure swung the bat as it crashed towards Jian Wushaung with the momentum of heaven and earth.

Another figure had two metal hammers for its hands. The metal hammers were gigantic. After a loud bellow, the hammers morphed into lighting and thunder as they appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. Even though the aura was not felt, one could tell how strong the attack was just by seeing the electric sparks.

Another figure morphed into a humongous ancient beast in golden armor and crashed towards Jian Wushuang. He looked like a flying battle fortress.

As for the other blurry figures, each attack was definitely powerful. One of the figures was an Ancient God and he used the Ancient God Finger.

“What a powerful aura. What are these?” Jian Wushuang thought to himself, shocked. He swung his sword at once.

A special sword essence could be felt. Jian Wushuang started to devour everything around him. He looked like a huge, dark vortex.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo, Mixed Elements Spirit!

Pong! Pong! Pong! Pong! Pong! Pong! Pong! Pong! Pong!

Nine loud clashes were heard as the nine different attacks were deflected one at a time. However, the attacks were so strong that Jian Wushuang backed off a few steps.

“Oh my. Everyone here at least has the fighting power of a top tier stage one Great Emperor. Two of them have fighting powers equivalent to a stage two Great Emperor.” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

People like Abysmal Saint Master were at the level of a top tier Great Emperor.

There were very few people at this level in the entire Eternal Chaotic World. However, the weakest of the nine figures possessed fighting power at this level. Two of them even had the fighting power of a stage two great emperor. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The battling power of this group was too powerful.

King Chen Xing, King Luo Yu and the other Ancient Gods were observing Jian Wushuang using their soul power.

Their faces turned pale when they saw the nine figures appear.

“These nine figures are the nine top tier experts who fought with my father. They are the strongest under my father’s command. Back in the first era, every single one of them had the fighting power of a top tier stage two great emperor. Two of them were even top tier stage 2 great emperors!’ King Chen Xing scoffed.

“As the first era ended, these nine great warriors died along with my father. However, they were absolutely loyal to him, hence they still guard him till this day in the form of a war spirit.”

“Even though the nine war spirits now are weaker than they were in their prime, their fighting power is still very powerful. Furthermore, all nine are fighting Jian Wushuang together!”

“Not any ordinary man can enter his grave due to this the second measure my father put in place outside the Ancient Emperor Grave.”

Back when King Chen Xing tried to enter the Ancient Emperor Grave forcibly, he fought the nine war spirits. He almost died on that day. Luckily, he had a powerful self-defense mechanism which allowed him to pass this test and move on. On the other hand, Jian Wushang…

“Even though the Sword Emperor has high fighting power, his self-defense mechanism might not be as strong as mine. Without it he definitely cannot survive for thirty seconds.”
