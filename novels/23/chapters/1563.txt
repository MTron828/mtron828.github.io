After he performed a three-move spear skill in outstanding manner, the surrounding people were astonished.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and said, “Your spear skill is shabby still. There are many places for improvement. Let me give you a few pointers…”

Jian Wushuang advised sincerely.

Although his power had already vanished, his knowledge and experience regarding weapons were still there.

After giving pointers, the powerfully-built man suddenly saw the light and had a great harvest.

“Old Mister Wu Chen, please take a look at my spear skill.”

The people in the village asked Jian Wushuang for pointers.

The people in the village resided in the deep mountain and they had no chance to meet any experts. Sometimes, there were one or two warriors who would pass by, but who would bother with them?

Then, they finally got to meet Jian Wushuang and had found out that he knew so much about spear skills. Of course, they couldn’t wait to ask for pointers and also ask him their questions.

Jian Wushuang was happy to teach too. He even intentionally taught the people in the village a spear skill.

It was an unqualified spear skill that he had obtained back when he had first started to wander in Eternal Chaotic World, but to the people in Chen Village, it was like getting a treasure.

Later on, the people in the village would practice this spear skill early in the morning. If they were to run into a problem that they didn’t understand, they would ask Jian Wushuang.

Hence, Jian Wushuang was highly respected by the people in the village.

In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang had stayed in the village for more than half a month.

At the battlefield in the village, Jian Wushuang stood in a corner while Chen Hu’s sister sat by his side. She was only a little girl at the age of four with two braids, Chen Qiu. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

On the battlefield, everyone in Chen Village was going for a battle.

The battle was categorized according to age.

Chen Hu won first place among the kids at the age of eight.

“Brother got first place again. He’s so amazing,” the little girl saw that Chen Hu had won the first place and she was dancing in excitement.

“Your brother is not amazing, but he is hardworking enough and he is willing to train assiduously.

“Brother will definitely become a warrior in the future and I want to be like him too,” the little girls said with her childish voice.

Jian Wushuang smiled.

Just then… Deng deng!!

The ground suddenly shook vigorously.

“Clatter of horses’ hooves?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

“Oh no, it’s a mounted gangster. The mounted gangsters are here!”

Along with the screen, the entire village was suddenly in chaos.

“Hurry up, hurry up.”

A large number of adult men in the village took out their metal or wooden long spears and rushed to the battlefield.

Before everyone gathered at the battlefield. Bang!

A loud bang and the door of the village was pushed opened forcefully. Then, a troop of almost hundred men barged into the village.

“Haha, Chen Village, we are here to collect the yearly fees,” a bright and loud laugh rang through the entire village.

“Yearly fees? Misters, haven’t we handed in the yearly fees?” An elderly in the village asked.

“Humph, you paid the yearly fees to Ruffian Gang. You have yet to pay to Baisha Gang. Hurry up and pay. You have to pay us twice what you paid to Ruffian Gang!” A man with a scar on his face who was leading the mounted gangsters bellowed.

“What?” The elderly exclaimed in surprise, “Twice? How can Chen Village afford it?”

“You can’t afford it? Humph, don’t blame us then. Brothers, attack. Kill all the men and catch all the beautiful woman,” the leader of the mounted gangsters roared.

Suddenly, the mounted gangsters were like strong wind. They instantly started a massacre.

Everyone in Chen Village was raging with anger.

“B*stard!”

“Fight with them!”

“Kill them! Let them know to not push the men in Chen Village the wrong way!”

The people in Chen Village took their weapons and fought against the mounted gangster.

They were born in the depths of the mountain, surrounded by the mounted gangsters. They practice their spear skills every day to improve their strengths in order to deal with the mounted gangsters.

It was time for them to counter attack.

However, the people in Chen Village used weapons that were coarsely made and most of them were made of wood. However, those gangsters were on their warhorses and using metal weapons. There were sabers, axes, long spears and so on. Plus, among the mounted gangsters, there were quite a few warriors.

Although there weren’t as many of them as there were people in Chen Village, the fight was dominated by them.

Most of the people in Chen Village were killed by the mounted gangsters directly.

“D*mn it!”

On the battlefield, Chen Fu, who was still scrawny and small, saw the scene and his eyes grew red. He carried the long spear in his hand and wanted to charge forward to fight against the mounted gangster. But he moved and he was immediately grabbed by Jian Wushuang.

“Hu Zi, don’t be silly. Hurry up, bring your sister and your mom into the house to hide. What’s happening here isn’t something children and women can interfere with,” Jian Wushuang said.

“But, Old Mister…” Chen Hu wanted to say something.

“Hurry up!” Jian Wushuang suddenly bellowed.

Chen Hu clenched his teeth. Then, he immediately pulled Chen Qiu, who was frightened and as pale as a sheet, and ran into the house.

While Jian Wushuang stood on the battlefield and watched the massacre before him. There was suddenly a long sword in his hand.

The sword was just an ordinary sword.

He had no divine power then, he couldn’t activate Blood Mountain Sword.

He carried a variety of treasures in his hand, like some tokens that contained attack power. Those tokens could easily exterminate the mounted gangster before him the moment it was activated.

However, the tokens required divine power to be activated too. Hence, he couldn’t use them.

But the only thing that he could use was an ordinary, and at best very sharp, sword.

Jian Wushuang took a stride forward and entered the battlefield.

Just as he leapt, he wielded his sword and instantly stabbed it through a mounted gangster’s throat.

Then, he flicked and stabbed another mounted gangster’s eyes. Then, Jian Wushuang landed on the ground.

The moment he landed, he staggered and fell.

“D*mn!” Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave.

He was a dying old man and his strength was far behind an ordinary adult’s. He possessed great swordsmanship but he couldn’t give full play to it.

Just then, he only moved a little and he felt his strenuous. If he were to be slightly strong, like an ordinary adult man, even without the assistance of Sword Intention, his origins and doctrines but with the simplest swordsmanship, he was confident he could kill all of the mounted gangster before him.

What could he do….

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang tried his best to walk around the crowd. As he walked through one round, he killed four mounted gangsters, one was blinded and the other one got his arm chopped off.

But then, he was also panting.

“Where did this old man come from? Take this!”
