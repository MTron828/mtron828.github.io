Chapter 3186: Attack Together

_________

The black light was extremely gorgeous.

Jian Wushuang could tell at a glance how terrifying the black light was. In terms of threat, the black light was much bigger than the axe displayed by Blood Eagle.

Buzz!

The soul attack displayed by the purple-haired elder was already sweeping toward Jian Wushuang.

“Humph, how can such a soul attack defeat me?” Jian Wushuang sneered. In his spiritual sea, the towering exquisite pagoda shook slightly and blocked the soul attack completely.

Jian Wushuang was only slightly affected by the soul attack, but the overall effect was not significant.

However, just as Jian Wushuang blocked the soul attack, the black light appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, one step ahead of the axe shadow.

Jian Wushuang’s body swayed strangely.

“Swish!”

The black light, which was like a meteor, passed through Jian Wushuang’s divine body without being affected at all.

“No.” Blood Eagle’s expression suddenly changed. “This guy actually dodged it?”

Blood Eagle was stunned.

In such a situation and at such a close distance, Jian Wushuang had just suffered a soul attack. How could he still use his movement technique to dodge the attack of the black light?

How was this possible?

Blood Eagle found it unbelievable.

However, at this moment, Jian Wushuang’s figure had condensed in the void beside him, and his eyes looked directly at the black light.

After the black light pierced through his afterimage, it stopped in the air so that Jian Wushuang could see it clearly.

The black light was a black dagger, which emitted an extremely strange and terrifying aura. The blade of the dagger was covered with a layer of pitch-black poison, and it was not as simple as just having poison on the blade, Jian Wushuang also felt an extremely strange power from the black dagger.

“Blood Eagle, you have a good trick. You fight me one-on-one on the surface, but secretly ask your brothers to cooperate with you and prepare a killing move. You want to kill me while I’m not carrying you.” Jian Wushuang looked at Blood Eagle, there was a mocking smile at the corner of his mouth.

“Humph, all is fair in war. You took the initiative to kill your way to my Green Flame Mountain, so how can I be polite to you?” Blood Eagle’s eyes were cold, but then he looked around. “Brothers, let’s kill him together and avenge sixth, eighth, eleventh, and thirteenth!”

Blood Eagle and Jian Wushuang had fought, and he had already seen that Jian Wushuang was not weak. He could not defeat him alone, so Blood Eagle wanted the other leaders to join him.

“Okay!”

The other leaders also agreed readily.

“Brother, let me help you,” Violent Bear was the first to speak.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, give back my four brothers’ lives!”

The other leaders surrounded Jian Wushuang with killing intent.

“You want to kill me? With just you?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Although he was alone and had to face nine experts, he was not afraid.

Seven of them had reached the peak of rank seven True Saint, and two of them were infinitely close to the Invincible Saint. However, Jian Wushuang did not show any fear or fear. On the contrary, there was a faint excitement in his eyes.

“In the 290 years on the time-space Island, with the help of many opportunities on the time-space Island, my strength has improved so much that I don’t even know what level my battle strength has reached. Today, I can use them to test my strength,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

“Brothers, let’s do it!” Blood Eagle shouted in a low voice and took the lead to attack Jian Wushuang.

Blood Eagle’s body was full of a dense death aura, which surged wildly in the surroundings. He grabbed the huge axe in one hand and then swung it toward Jian Wushuang as if he was splitting the mountain and the earth.

The other leaders also made their moves.

Among the 13 axes, Violent Bear’s strength was second only to Blood Eagle’s. He was also close to the Invincible Saint Realm. At this moment, he flipped his hand and took out a huge stone stick. It was called a stone stick, but in Violent Bear’s hand…it was like a huge stone pillar. Violent Bear held the stone pillar with both hands, and a destructive power condensed in the stone pillar.

Then, the stone pillar suddenly stabbed toward Jian Wushuang.

As for the other leaders, although they were not as strong as Blood Eagle and Violent Bear, they were at the peak of rank seven True Saint, and their skills were not ordinary.

At this moment, they all greeted Jian Wushuang.

Some used their battle sabers to slash out huge saber shadows.

Some used their long whips to turn into countless long snakes and bite at Jian Wushuang.

He also used a cold spear to stab at Jian Wushuang’s heart from behind.

In addition, the fourth brother of the 13 axes, the purple-haired elder, was also constantly using soul attacks to influence Jian Wushuang.

“Haha, come on!”

Under the siege of the 13 axes, Jian Wushuang was pleasantly surprised. He laughed heartily and went up to meet them alone.

“Bang!”

The first move of Xi Xiang!

The violent sword light forced Blood Eagle to retreat. Then Jian Wushuang slashed out with his sword. The shocking power contained in the sword cut across the sky and hit the stone pillar of the Violent Bear, causing it to retreat.

“Get lost!”

With a roar, he used the first move of setting sun.

The shocking sword light contained the space-time annihilation. With Jian Wushuang’s current comprehension of the space-time principles, the power of the space-time annihilation was shocking and extremely powerful. It immediately destroyed the attacks of the surrounding leaders.

In the huge space-time annihilation storm, Jian Wushuang’s figure flickered like a ghost.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

Silver ghosts shuttled through the storm at an extreme speed. At least none of the leaders of the 13 axes could keep up with his speed.

“So fast! He’s so fast!”

“Be careful!”

The leaders of the 13 axes cried out in alarm. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

They had intended to besiege Jian Wushuang, but Jian Wushuang’s burst of speed was so fast that they could not keep up with his speed at all.

In the storm, Jian Wushuang used his speed to fight with them again and again. Each time he fought, he would at most face two or three leaders at the same time. In a short time, these leaders…they could not do anything to him.

At this moment…

Jian Wushuang’s body, which was flashing, suddenly took a step toward the void.

When he took a step forward, the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand had already fallen.

He had already displayed extremely fast swordsmanship.

The Peerless Sword Manual, life and death moment!

Chi!

The purple-haired elder’s head was directly thrown away.
