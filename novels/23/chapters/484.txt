“What a monster!”

A series of exclamations reverberated in the massive Sword-suppression Valley, which was completely stirred up.

The fusion of three Sword Souls was unprecedented in the history of the Divine Land. What was this if not monstrous?

In the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang felt somewhat muddled upon becoming aware that he had fused three first-grade Sword Souls together completely.

“They’re fused?”

“They’re fused just like that?”

Jian Wushuang murmured to himself, his eyes filled with disbelief.

He had easily done what nobody else could ever do.

It had been nothing more than an idea in his head, which he followed and ultimately succeeded in actualizing on his first attempt.

He had done what was impossible for anyone else to do in the simplest, most casual, and most untroubled fashion.

“It’s the Heavenly Creation Skill!”

After calming down, he finally understood what went on.

The biggest difference between him and others was the Cultivation Method he had mastered!

He was an Inverse Cultivator who cultivated the Heavenly Creation Skill!

It was in the blood of inverse cultivators to defy the natural order and go against convention.

The Heavenly Creation Skill in his body had involuntarily operated during the fusion of the three Sword Souls. This was an indication that said skill was inextricably linked to his fusion ability.

Jian Wushuang felt at ease once he understood this point.

The Heavenly Creation Skill was a heaven-defying cultivation method. Anything that was impossible would be made possible upon becoming related to it.

The fused body of the three Sword Souls was clearly a tad smaller than what Jian Wushuang had imagined in his sea of consciousness. However, it soon began to shake violently and metamorphosis!

That’s right, it was a metamorphosis!

The Sword Soul in the sea of consciousness was originally transparent, illusionary, and glass-like. However, its color gradually changed – a layer of gold gradually appeared over its transparent parts, like a newborn baby putting on his first set of clothes.

The transparent Sword Soul seemed as if it had put on garments which were warm gold in color.

In only a short time, the transparent and illusionary Sword Soul in the sea of consciousness metamorphosized into a golden Sword Soul which emitted a boundless radiance.

At the same time, the majestic Sword Soul Phantom, which was formed from the three phantoms behind Jian Wushuang, also began to metamorphosis.

Like the Sword Soul in the sea of consciousness, a layer of gold appeared on and gradually covered its entire body.

The majestic Sword Soul Phantom gradually solidified and transformed into an impressive Golden War God which body mass greatly expanded.

It grew at an astonishing speed from its original stature of close to 100 feet.

It exceeded 100 feet in the blink of an eye and still continued to grow rapidly.

110 feet! 120 feet! ...150 feet!

The Golden War God, which was originally already of a towering height, grew non-stop under the horrified looks of the numerous Sword Principle experts in Sword-suppression Valley.

Finally, when it reached 180 feet in height, it gradually stopped growing.

“180 feet!”

“A Sword Soul Phantom of 180 feet!”

“A golden Sword Soul Phantom?”

“What on earth is this?”

Shock and bewilderment!

Confused, none of the Sword Principle experts could believe their eyes.

For a Sword Soul Phantom, a hundred feet was considered the maximum height even if it was first-grade!

Furthermore, Sword Soul Phantoms were but spectral images, or in other words, shadows, which were typically monotone.

The sight in front of their eyes had utterly defied what was reasonable.

A 180-feet tall, golden-colored Sword Soul Phantom was no longer what they imagined a first-grade Sword Soul to be.

It had surpassed the category of a “first-grade Sword Soul”!

“Is it above first-grade?” Many of the Sword Principle experts wondered.

Its eyes, which had been tightly closed, opened vigorously right at this moment, a streak of boundless Sword Essence flashing across them.

Boom... Gushing from its body was a boundless Sword Essence which was a few notches more powerful than the one emitted from the Heart-killing Sword. This sword essence swept forth with an overwhelming momentum.

In a twinkling, it swept onto the bodies of many Sword Principle experts in the valley.

The head-on approach of the gushing Sword Essence caused the faces of the experts to turn ghastly pale. Some experts even spat blood and hurriedly retreated backward.

As it swept through the world, the terrifying Sword Essence carried an aura of transcendence and intent to outstrip all things of the universe.

The next moment...

Ching! Ching! Ching! Ching! Ching!

Shrilling sword echoes?rang out in every corner of the valley.

They were made by the weapons in the hands of the Sword Principle experts.

These weapons had merely saluted when they faced the Heart-killing Sword previously. This time, however, under the attention of the 18-feet tall, golden Sword Soul Phantom...

Clang clang clang clang clang clang!

Among the thousands of weapons in the valley, those which were magic weapons or better disregarded their owners as they surged out of the Interspatial Rings toward the Sword Soul Phantom.

Like a dense cloud of locusts which covered heaven and earth, thousands upon thousands of weapons gleamed in brilliant colors as they encircled the Sword Soul Phantom.

Subsequently, a supreme Sword Essence swept forth from the Sword Soul Phantom.

Shushhh... thousands upon thousands of weapons saluted in unison at this very instant, sending shrilling sword echoes into the heavens.

These echoes shook the entire world as if they were the voices of immortals.

...

Far away from the Divine Land, in Jian Wushuang’s hometown of the Nanyang Continent.

Inside a cave mansion located within the territory of the Tang Dynasty.

A middle-aged man in plain gray robes raised his head forcibly at this very moment. He was able to see clearly everything that was happening in the Sword-suppression Valley of the Divine Land through a void which was hundreds of millions of miles long.

“A thousand sword applause for the most powerful Sword Soul!”

“He’s indeed worthy of being the chosen disciple. He has managed to achieve the most powerful Sword Soul in this kind of place and at such a young age. It probably won’t be difficult for him to attain the most powerful Sword Principle hereafter.”

Laughing gently, the middle-aged man flipped his hand such that an object appeared in it.

Astonishingly, it was a gray stone bead which was as big as a baby’s fist. It emitted a peculiar aura.

Jian Wushuang would certainly recognize this object with one look. It was exactly the same as the mysterious stone bead in his body which provided him with the Heavenly Creation Skill!

“It seems that I have to find an opportunity to pass this to him.”
