Chapter 1791: Your Son Has Returned

Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

In the past, the strongest people in the Green Fire Palace were the Universe Masters!

Moreover, there were so little Universe Masters that it was pathetic. Before Jian Wushuang had risen to prominence, the Green Fire Palace had only had five Universe Masters. As for Heaven Masters, there were only about two hundred of them.

Such fighting capabilities were so weak that it was depressing.

Due to that, they were forced by the Jin Kingdom where to be unable to compete against the Jin Kingdom even after paying huge prices in the final great battle. If not for Jian Wushuang making a breakthrough at the critical moment in the end and killing the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom who was at the level of a Universe God of the First Heaven, the Green Fire Palace would have been destroyed a long time ago. Moreover, the Green Fire World would definitely not exist either.

However, on that very day after tens of thousands of years, the Green Fire Palace was a lot more powerful than before.

At that moment, among the large number of cultivators who were gathered in the war fortress below, there was actually a total of eighteen Universe Gods of the First Heaven!

As for Universe Masters, they were everywhere.

If not for him knowing that the big formation that Xuan Yi had deployed was still present and that no one from the outside was able to come in, Jian Wushuang would really suspect that the current Green Fire World was occupied by the powerhouses which came from the Eternal Chaotic World.

“Both of you, wait for me here.”

After giving out his instructions, Jian Wushuang floated toward the Green Fire Palace below.

…

In an open space in the Green Fire Palace.

A fatty who wore a luxurious, loose and long robe was lying down and drinking wine.

Beside him stood a bald-headed old man.

“Boring. The days are getting more and more boring,” the fatty was drinking wine and he felt extremely gloomy.

“I have told you before that this world is too small and you should travel in a universe that is more vast. With that, it will be more interesting. However, you refused to listen. As of now, it will not be so easy to leave even if you want to,” the bald-headed old man said.

“How would I know that things would become like this?” the fatty curled his lips. “If I had known that this would be the case, I would have gone along with Old Three to travel outside fifty thousand years ago.”

“Stop complaining. It’s useless even if you complain,” the bald-headed old man said furiously.

“Ah!” the fatty sighed and his eyes filled with recollection. “Speaking of Old Three, I wonder how he is doing outside. And now, I wonder what level he has achieved?”

“Hmph, stop thinking about that brother of yours. The universe of the outside world is filled with danger. When he left, he barely possessed the fighting capabilities of a Universe God. In the outside world, there are countless people who can kill him. Now that tens of thousands of years have passed, who knows if he is still alive?”

“What an inauspicious remark. Old Three is so impressive, he must still be alive. Moreover, he will definitely return in the future,” the fatty had absolute confidence in ‘Old Three.’

Just then…

“Boss Wang Yuan,” a voice could be heard abruptly.

“Eh, who called me?” the fatty was stunned. “This voice… is so familiar!”

“It’s Old Three’s voice.”

The fatty stood up abruptly.

In front of him, a figure came into view slowly.

It had a familiar face and aura. It was the ‘Old Three’ who the fatty had mentioned.

“Old Three, it’s really you?” Wang Yuan revealed a delighted expression at once. At the same time, he pinched his own face as he wanted to find out whether he was dreaming.

“Haha, I’m not dreaming. It’s real.”

“Great.”

Wang Yuan laughed loudly and his huge body ran toward Jian Wushuang immediately. Without hesitation, he hugged Jian Wushuang.

“Boss Wang Yuan, even after not seeing you for so many years, you are still the same as before and you are still so smooth and round as well,” Jian Wushuang teased and he had an extremely good mood.

Boss Wang Yuan… he was his genuine good brother who had gone through thick and thin with him.

“Old Three, let’s find a place and have a good drink,” Wang Yuan took Jian Wushuang and headed to the imperial palaces which was far away.

“No problem, let’s get the rest of the people as well,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

As the bald-headed old man who was by the side looked on as Wang Yuan and Jian Wushuang left, he became dumbfounded.

“This Jian Wushuang has actually returned for real? Moreover, his aura…” the bald-headed old man squinted his eyes slightly.

The bald-headed old man was a weapon’s spirit of the Loyalty Palace and he had always followed Wang Yuan.

As for the Loyalty Palace, it was born from the ancient battlefield nearby. Hence, the bald-headed old man was extremely knowledgeable.

He could tell that Jian Wushuang’s current aura was many times more powerful than it had been before.

…

In no time, the news of Jian Wushuang’s return spread with shocking speed.

In a split second, the whole Green Fire Palace and the whole Green Fire World were in an uproar.

Jian Wushuang had become a legend in the Green Fire World a long time ago.

Even though tens of thousands of years had passed, this legend was still imprinted in the minds of many people, especially those experts who had gone through the decisive battle with the Jin Kingdom.

That great battle had depended on Jian Wushuang’s power alone to save all of them from a desperate crisis.

In a vast courtyard, a large number of people had gathered. Most of them were the experts who had gone through that battle. Quite a number of them had interacted with Jian Wushuang before and at that moment, they were chatting with Jian Wushuang joyfully and harmoniously.

“Old Three!”

An extremely emotional voice could be heard.

After hearing the voice, Jian Wushuang looked over. When he saw the extremely beautiful black-robed young lady, he revealed an elated smile, “Haha, Old Four!”

The two of them hugged each other right away.

To Jian Wushuang, Su Rou was like his biological sister.

In no time, Xue Lingtian brought a woman over.

Xue Lingtian was Jian Wushuang’s brother and he was also Xuan Yi’s Lineal Disciple. He also had an extremely good relationship with Jian Wushuang.

Upon seeing his own senior, Jian Wushuang was also extremely delighted.

As for that woman, she cried tears of joy the moment she saw Jian Wushuang. At the same time, she knelt down. “Greetings to Master from your disciple, Lin Lan. Master, you have finally returned.”

“Little girl, please get up,” Jian Wushuang laughed and waved his hands.

In his life, he had only accepted two people as his disciple. In particular, Lin Lan was the first disciple he accepted. She was also someone who Jian Wushuang owed greatly.

Because, he, a Master, had almost never guided Lin Lan before. He only gave her some resources so that she would grow by herself.

It should be known that for He Xiu, his Registered Disciple, he would give him some advice occasionally back when they were in the Lineage of Star.

However, Lin Lan did not disappoint Jian Wushuang as well.

In terms of realm, she had become a Universe Master. Although that naturally meant nothing in the Eternal Chaotic World, it was already very shocking in the Green Fire World.

Jian Wushuang was chatting with his senior and disciple. At the same time, he was asking them something about the Ancient Sect.

With the disappearance of Master Xuan Yi and him leaving the Green Fire World, the Ancient Sect had always been under Xue Lingtian’s control and everything was alright.

Just then…

All of a sudden, a man and woman appeared in the courtyard.

As the two of them appeared, the voice of Jian Wushuang, who was chatting with Xue Lingtian, disappeared. He then stood up and he looked at the two of them with mixed feelings.

Similarly, the man and the woman were looking closely at Jian Wushuang.

“Father, mother!”

“Your son has… returned!”
