Chapter 2374: Luogu Territory

He left Narcissus Island with the five core disciples and all six of them flew through the void together.

“Junior Brothers, I can now tell you about the mission since we have left Narcissus Island,” said Xiao Heng.

The rest of them including Jian Wushuang were listening with full attentiveness.

Just like Jian Wushuang, nobody knew anything about the mission. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Xiao Heng only told the four core disciples that they were going on a mission together, but nothing about the mission details.

“This mission is rather unusual as it will be full of danger because it’s located in Luogu Territory!” said Xiao Heng solemnly.

“Luogu Territory?” The four core disciples exclaimed in surprise.

Even Jian Wushuang got slightly caught off guard when he heard ‘Luogu Territory’.

Within the Wusha Wilderness, there were many areas separated into counties with each covering a rather vast land.

However, other than a few less accessible areas in the Wusha Wilderness there was only one area that was not separated by counties but simply called a territory.

That area was Luogu Territory!

Although it’s called a territory, Luogu Territory was a rather small land area which was even smaller than a regular commandery and located within the Wusha Wilderness.

However, this small piece of land had a terrifyingly big reputation within the Wusha Wilderness.

Luogu Territory was infamous for its bloodshed and chaos!

It was the most violent and chaotic place within Wusha Wilderness. Various organized powers intertwined with each other in full complexity. Experts of many kinds from lone wolves wanted by various sects and clans to extremely atrocious criminals with varying backgrounds were all gathered there.

It was a generally acknowledged no man’s land.

As long as one had the ability, he could do anything he wanted in Luogu Territory and nobody could do anything about it.

Even various top sects and clans in the Wusha Wilderness such as Narcissus Island and the Great Compassion Sect could not do much.

“You should all know what kind of place Luogu Territory is by now. I just wanted to tell all of you that it is a lawless place and they wouldn’t hesitate to do what they want. While carrying out missions at other places, we could state our identities as core disciples of Narcissus Island when we run into danger and people would usually give us face by going easy on us. However, that is not the case in Luogu Territory at all.”

“Many people in Luogu Territory are desperate fugitives actively being pursued by various sects and clans. Therefore, if we expose ourselves as Narcissus Island disciples, it could further provoke their intentions to kill us; however they can.”

Xiao Heng continued after a short pause. “Our mission is to rescue someone from Luogu Territory.”

“Rescue mission?” Jian Wushuang was slightly surprised.

“Mu Clan of Qinling, you have probably heard of them?” Xiao Heng looked around.

One of the core disciples immediately answered, “Mu Clan? I do. That’s a big clan that carries a long legacy and also one of the overlords of Wusha Wilderness. Although they are not a sect but only a clan, the Mu Clan of Qinling’s foundation is definitely stronger than most regular sects. Even when compared to Narcissus Island, we’re slightly stronger than them but not by much. Why? Is this mission related to the Mu Clan?”

Xiao Heng nodded. “Yes, it is. This mission is a favor for the Mu Clan, the story can be traced back to more than ten years ago when their Second Miss was abducted by some mysterious experts and has disappeared since. Although the Mu Clan did everything to investigate, they could not find any information about her.

“Time quickly flew by and everyone in the Mu Clan assumed that the Second Miss had died. However, someone unexpectedly had seen her in Luogu Territory not so long ago and brought the news to the Mu Clan. Mu Clan certainly took it seriously, but they had run into some internal issues and couldn’t send experts over in a short time. Hence, they asked Narcissus Island for help.”

“And what we need to do is to get to Luogu Territory, find this Mu Clan’s Second Miss, and then bring her back to Narcissus Island.”

The four core disciples raised their eyebrows after hearing the story.

“That’s it? Doesn’t sound too difficult.”

“Of course it isn’t hard for us, but for some people, it’s harder than reaching the heavens.”

At that point, the four core disciples nonchalantly took a glance at Jian Wushuang without hiding their feeling of disdain at all.

Jian Wushuang did not care about how they perceived him at all, but he sensed that the mission was not as easy as they thought after listening to Xiao Heng’s briefing.

After all, if the mission was so easy that a few core disciples in the Divine Demon Realm could handle, why would the Mu Clan not send out their experts to do it?

Even with the clan’s internal issues taken out of consideration, as one of Wusha Wilderness’s overlords who was almost comparable to Narcissus Island, sending out a few Divine Demon Realm experts was nothing to them.

However, the Mu Clan refused to take matters in their own hands.

Perhaps, there was something fishy about it.

“Anyhow, let’s get to Luogu Territory and decide what to do when we see the so-called Second Miss.” Jian Wushuang smiled mildly.

The six of them traveled at full speed and only arrived at Luogu Territory after half a month.

Luogo Territory, though it was named a ‘territory’ its area was very small as it only consisted of nine cities. Together, they were the infamous ‘Nine Cities of Luogu’.

The Nine Cities of Luogu were each led by a top tier expert. According to rumors, the weakest among the governors was a Peak Stage Divine Demon who was leading an army of First and Second-Class Divine Demons. As for Third-Class Divine Demons, there were countless of them.

What it meant was that their city’s power was comparable to some third or second-tier sects in the Wusha Wilderness.

There were a total of nine such cities in the Luogu Territory. If they combined their forces, the total power of their experts in Divine Demon Realm could even defeat the biggest sect in Wusha Wilderness, Great Compassion Sect.

Furthermore, it was said there were quite a few super experts hiding in Luogu Territory with abilities that were above the Divine Demon Realm.

They were the actual players who were in-charge of the Luogu Territory.

It was because of the existence of those hidden super experts and the powerful Nine Cities that Luogu Territory was feared by many sects of Wusha Wilderness, they were the reason Luogu Territory never ceased to survive.

Without enough power, Luogu Territory would have been stampeded out of existence by all the big sects in Wusha Wilderness.
