“That’s all the experts from the ancient past have?” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself with an indifferent expression.

These experts from the ancient past had had incredible fighting power back in their prime. Jian Wushuang would think that they were weak because they were under the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth.

He could massacre them alone using only his blade.

“After settling these Divine Demons, what is next is...” Jian Wushuang shifted his gaze as he looked at a battlefield not too far away,

There, Emperor Bai was battling it out with Old Monster Jiao and Chen Qi furiously.

Old Monster Jiao and Chen Qi gave it their all by using the fighting power of a Half-Step Divine Demon Realm expert, yet they could barely match Emperor Bai.

Both of them were at a disadvantage even though they were fighting Emperor Bai with an advantage in terms of numbers. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

They had thought that if Emperor Bai was preoccupied, the remaining experts in the Divine Demon Realm should be able to sweep Sanctuary Alliance without any problems. But then...

Whoosh!

A figure appeared on this battlefield. Old Monster Jiao and Chen Qi stopped the fight and looked up.

They fixed their gazes on Jian Wushuang and they had a dark look on their faces.

While both of them were battling with Emperor Bai, they had taken note of what was happening on the other battlefield. They had seen how Jian Wushuang had massacred more than half of those experts in Divine Demons within moments, and how he had forced the survivors to flee in terror.

“This brat... I thought you said that only Emperor Bai was the only powerful man from this era?” Old Monster Jiao said as he fixed his gaze on Jian Wushuang.

“Who knows. From the fighting power he just displayed, he might be even more powerful than Emperor Bai,” Chen Qi exclaimed, surprised.

He had gone in depth to research about the experts in this era.

He knew much about Jian Wushuang.

He knew that Jian Wushuang only had the fighting power of an ordinary stage-three great emperor.

However, the fighting power Jian Wushuang had was far greater than he had imagination.

“Not bad, Jian Wushuang,” Emperor Bai looked at Jian Wushuang as he spoke with glee in his eyes.

Jian Wushuang had given him a big surprise.

He knew that Jian Wushuang had broken through in terms of his realm and reached the Ultimate Phase of the Seventh Step Inverse Cultivation. He had guessed that Jian Wushuang’s fighting power must have skyrocketed.

He had never thought that his improvement had been so extreme!!

He was enlightened to the Spacetime Rules of Order, possessed such powerful soul attacks and, most importantly, had that level of sword skills!

That sword skill was too stunning.

“Emperor Bai, what is their fighting power?” Jian Wushuang asked indifferently.

“They are very powerful. Even though I was at a slight advantage when I battled them both, there was nothing I could do with that advantage. Now that you are here, things will be different. Let’s work together and kill them both,” Emperor Bai said.

“Ok,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head as killing intent started to grow in his eyes.

“This is troublesome. Sir Jiao, the fighting power of the Sword Emperor is far greater than what we thought. Now that the experts in the Divine Demon Realm are defeated, there is no way both of us can win against them when we can’t even win against Emperor Bai. We should leave and think of other ways to take revenge.” Chen Qi had a gloomy expression as he spoke to Old Monster Jiao.

Old Monster Jiao squinted his eyes. He was extremely unwilling to back off just like that.

Emperor Bai had killed his ride, Scaly, who had been like a brother to him. He had sworn he would take revenge.

He had never thought that he could not do so even after paying a hefty price to gather so many experts from the Ancient Past in the Divine Demon Realm.

How could he be willing to back off just like this?

However, no matter how unwilling he was, he knew how bad the current situation was.

It would be a joke for him to face Emperor Bai and Sword Emperor together with Chen Qi.

“Let’s go then.”

Old Monster Jiao signalled to Chen Qi secretly.

Then... Whoosh! Whoosh!

Both of them dashed back without hesitation.

“You want to escape?” Emperor Bai’s eyes turned cold.

“It would be far too easy if you could come and go as you like,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

The moment they finished speaking, a surging wave of divine power swept out from Emperor Bai.

“Punisher’s Hell!!!”

Boom~~~

The ninety-nine thousand foot tall golden figure shuddered as the Heaven and Earth threatened to collapse.

Almost instantly, an ocean of golden divine power formed a wave tens of thousands of feet tall. The wave filled the entire battlefield as it crashed towards Old Monster Jiao and Chen Qi.

The terrifying power that even stage three great emperor would have feared burst forth from that golden wave.

Old Monster Jiao and Chen Qi’s faces turned pale.

They could feel the rippling power of that wave.

There was an incredible pressure from the wave that slowed their escape.

At the same time Emperor Bai attacked, divine power and the Ancient God Bloodline Power surged on Jian Wushuang.

“Ancient God secret skills, Moon Picking Skill!!”

Hum!

It was as though Heaven and Earth froze for a moment.

The spacetime was completely sealed off.

A giant, warm palm appeared from thin air. It was as though it belonged to a mother as it “picked” towards the space where the spacetime was sealed off.

“Bastard!”

Old Monster Jiao went into a rage when he felt that the spacetime around him had been sealed off.

His body enlarged into a ten-foot-tall giant as a black shadow hovered behind him. Within moments, he turned into a terrifying black god.

The black god roared in anger as both of his arms swung about in a frenzy, smashing the spacetime around him.

The spacetime started to break open layers at a time.

As for Chen Qi, he too used an incredible technique.

“These two have mastered incredible techniques, unlike those I killed a few moments ago,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself. A glint of emotion flashed across his eyes as Jian Wushuang said to Emperor Bai, “Emperor Bai. We might not be able to kill them both here. Hence, both of us should use all our power to focus on killing one of them.”

“Okay,” Emperor Bai nodded his head.

Both of them came to a consensus instantly.

Both the golden wave and the Moon Picking Skill started to contract and head towards Old Monster Jiao.

The two great emperors ignored Chen Qi.

They knew that Old Monster Jiao was the mastermind behind this attack as he wanted to take revenge for his ride. As for Chen Qi, he was just an expert that Old Monster Jiao had hired to help him take revenge.

Hence, they would not allow Old Monster Jiao to escape no matter what. They would use their full power to kill him.
