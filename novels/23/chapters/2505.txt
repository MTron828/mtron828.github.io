Chapter 2506: Xuan Shen’s Advice (2)

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate. As he concentrated his mind, the terrifying life rating pressure began to push forward.

Under that pressure, even an Undying Saint would have to directly kneel down without the slightest bit of capability to endure it.

However, Daoist Xuan Shen seemed calm and composed when facing the pressure without showing a trace of discomfort.

“That’s good enough,” said Daoist Xuan Shen.

Jian Wushuang immediately retracted the pressure.

“Not bad, it’s exactly the same as your master Xuan Yi’s pressure since both came from an extremely strong life rating pressure. This kind of pressure is oblivious of one’s abilities or cultivation level and only depends on the organic structure. Unfortunately, you have only very recently become a Perfect Chaotic Creature. The pressure you emitted isn’t considered too overpowering yet. When you get to your master’s level, you can oppress billions of lives as soon as you concentrate your mind and make countless gods and demons to worship you,” said Daoist Xuan Shen.

A trace of desire and longing was shining through Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

He truly wished to become an earth-shattering super expert like his master who could directly cause the Heavenly Way to shiver and as soon as he focused his mind, the Will of Heavenly Way would immediately fall apart!

However, he was still way too far from that level.

“Jian Wushuang, you’ll have to stop using life rating pressure from now on. You can use it during desperate life-threatening situations, but you have to leave the territory as swiftly as possible once you do that,” advised Daoist Xuan Shen.

“Would this move startle the Will of Heavenly Way?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Mmhm, the Will of Heavenly Way is weaker beyond the Third Heaven. If you merely unleash it once or twice, perhaps the Will of Heavenly Way won’t be able to find you. However, if you use it many times, the Will of Heavenly Way will definitely be able to track down your location. When that time comes, it’ll wipe you out right away.” Daoist Xuan Shen nodded.

“Then, what I just did...” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“What you just did won’t cause issues as I’m right beside you and the Will of Heavenly Way has faded,” said Daoist Xuan Shen.

Jian Wushuang sighed in relief.

“Sir, I’ve made up my mind to use Life Rating Pressure as my last resort. I’ll never use it unless I’m in desperate situations,” said Jian Wushuang.

Daoist Xuan Shen smiled. “Very well. Other than the Will of Heavenly Way, the Three Great Sacred Realm Lords have probably realized your existence at this point. They will do whatever they can to track you down and kill you, hence there are a lot more things you need to be careful about. You have to be extra mindful every step of the way after three days’ time. As long as you take a wrong step, not only you but also Seven Stars Black Sect including their sealed part of Heaven and Earth would fall into an unredeemable state!”

“I understand,” said Jian Wushuang.

Daoist Xuan Shen spoke again, “Finally, third is being respectful! A Perfect Chaotic Creature is perfect in every way and has an extremely strong ability to keep himself alive. It’s totally impossible for regular cultivators to kill a Perfect Chaotic Creature, but that doesn’t mean a Perfect Chaotic Creature won’t die!”

The world is huge, hence you need to have a respectful heart towards Heavens, Earth, and the Ancient God Domain by continuing your path carefully at every step of the way since even at your master Xuan Yi’s level, he still died in the end. Whatever you plan to do, you must make sure you can survive.”

As long as you’re alive, you can take your time to fight for opportunities, so don’t be hasty and don’t worry about what happens in the sealed Heaven and Earth. I’ve been waiting for so many years and I don’t mind waiting a little longer.”

Jian Wushuang nodded firmly and kept every single advice and warning given by Daoist Xuan Shen in his heart and mind.

He truly had too much burden.

Furthermore, he had way too many enemies. Other than Will of Heavenly Way, there were still the Lords of the Three Divine Realms and Three Sacred Realms. In addition to that were the Four God Tribes, Eight Heavenly Sects...

In such situations, he could not afford to take even a single wrong step.

As Daoist Xuan Shen said, he would lose the whole chess game from being careless. If he took just one wrong move, it would send himself, Eternal Chaotic World, and Seven Stars Black Sect to eternal damnation.

“Ah, yes. I also bring this small thing that I refined for you,” said Daoist Xuan Shen. He flipped his hand and presented a piece of black stone.

The black stone looked very normal just like any regular stone.

“Senior, this black stone is...” Jian Wushuang perplexedly stared at the black stone.

“This is just a normal black-colored stone which I randomly picked up from the ground. However, I’ve refined it such that I’ve imposed a layer of magic matrix on it which will change your divine power aura,” said Daoist Xuan Shen.

“Changing my divine power aura? How?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“After absorbing this black stone, as long as you’re below the Undying Saint realm, your divine power aura would be raised by two levels under the magic matrix influence. For example, you’re currently at the level of the Second-Class Divine Demon realm. After absorbing the black stone, the divine power aura which you project would be two levels higher than your actual, showing that of a Peak Divine Demon. Of course, only the divine power aura will change but your actual ability will not.” Daoist Xuan Shen smiled.

The way Daoist Xuan Shen explained was very casual, However, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining with excitement.

Raising the divine power aura that he projected was incredibly useful to Jian Wushuang.

The reason being that he was only a Second-Class Divine Demon but his battle strength was close to a High-Level Ultimate God. It was quite extraordinary with such terrifying level skipping capability.

If he was battling in front of many people, displaying this terrifying ability to skip levels would shock everyone as that was beyond their understanding. They would not even be able to describe him with words like ‘demon’ or ‘monster’. Such a situation would be too obvious and defying nature, hence it would end up catching too much attention.

In short, it was too obvious.

Now that he had the black stone, his divine power aura could reach the level of Peak Divine Demon. If he defeated a Primary Level Ultimate God in public, he would still cause a stir, but at least it was somewhat an acceptable phenomenon.

Even though it was extremely rare to find a Divine Demon who could defeat an Ultimate God, it was still possible to find one from the huge number of talented people in the Ancient God Domain. It could be considered as a coincidental discovery.

However, a Second-Class Divine Demon defeating a Primary Level Ultimate God was a non-existent occurrence in the Ancient God Domain. Naturally, nobody would comprehend it. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

If that were to occur in Wusha Wilderness where the various sects had not seen much of the world, they would only feel incredibly stunned.

However, if true experts witnessed something of that sort, they would immediately realize Jian Wushuang held a big secret and that would bring him endless troubles.

Hence, the black stone was of utmost importance to him.
