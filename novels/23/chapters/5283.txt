Chapter 5282 - 5282: Golden Patterns

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The patterns on his body became increasingly distinct, golden lines resembling the giant he had encountered in the starry sky.

These lines adorned his back, chest, legs, and arms after almost half an hour of cleansing. Jian Wushuang left the upstream area and returned to his dwelling downstream.

The cave had undergone significant changes over the past year, now a rather comfortable place. He had cut and arranged some animal hides to fashion a makeshift bed.

Since entering this place, his daily routine had become similar to that of an ordinary person. Even though his physical strength had grown immensely, he still experienced hunger and fatigue.

Puff!

Jian Wushuang took a piece of charcoal from the pile, blew on it forcefully, and a flame erupted. Crackling sounds filled the air.

After setting up the bonfire, he retrieved a hind leg of a water buffalo and began roasting it over the flames.

After a while, he took out a sharp stone knife and started cutting slices from the roasted meat, devouring each piece.

Every bite increased his strength.

Now, he was no longer afraid of wolf packs. The animals in this valley posed little threat to him, except for the tiger king that lived in the woods.

The boost from ten wild boars was comparable to that of a water buffalo, and ten sheep equaled a wild boar in terms of enhancement.

This was his current estimation. The tiger kings enhancement was likely the most significant. As for the wolf packs, he didn’t have plans to deal with them at the moment.

He had already eaten several sheep. Since he no longer needed to hide behind the flock, he would occasionally hunt solitary mountain goats.

There were nine years left, and he had to plan for what came next.

He intended to finish off the remaining wild boars within this month, then move on to hunting water buffaloes.

The sheep flock would be his final target.

The tiger king would come last.

The initial rule was to consume all the livestock, which might not have included the tiger king and the wolf packs. However, he didn’t dare to take chances; it was best to eat them all.

He had consumed most of the several hundred pounds of beef by the afternoon.

Now, he could eat a thousand pounds of meat in a day; under normal circumstances, he could consume four to five hundred pounds.

The greater his strength, the greater his demands.

In addition to hand-to-hand combat, he had also learned to set traps now.

He had set many traps on the mountain, specifically designed to catch wild boars; if he was lucky, he wouldn’t need to get his hands dirty.

“Hmm!” Jian Wushuang raised an eyebrow, slowly walking out of the cave.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

A sound of brutal struggle came from upstream.

From the sound of it, it should be a wild boar.

He moved swiftly, following the riverbank, heading upstream.

“Lucky again, it’s probably another wild boar falling into the trap.” A smile appeared on Jian Wushuangs face.

It was better not to get involved if he didn’t have to!

He didn’t come here to practice fighting with livestock; he came for his physical body.

He would spare no effort to devour all the animals in this valley, leaving nothing behind.

Time was running out, and he didn’t have time to hunt them one by one. In addition to traps, he now targeted herds of sheep every day.

Now those herds of sheep had become hostile towards him; it was hard to find any that were alone, so he had to deal with the water buffalo instead.

The strength of one buffalo was worth tens of thousands of pounds. Fortunately, they weren’t as agile as wild boars, so dealing with them was relatively easy.

He ran along the riverbank for about fifteen minutes, reaching the outskirts of the forest upstream.

In the forest, aside from occasional distant howls, there was nothing to be seen, not even a trace of the usual wolf packs.

“There’s something strange here!” Jian Wushuang slowed his steps, surveying the surroundings before cautiously approaching the source of the howls in the woods.

This time, he carried four or five short spears and a sword crafted from a cow’s thigh bone. Although he lacked his original source and divine body, he hadn’t forgotten the swordsmanship he had learned as a mortal. Confronting a pack of wolves, with his exceptional sword skills, he had nothing to fear.

He gradually neared the depths of the forest.

He found the wild boar that had been howling; it had indeed fallen into the trap he set. The boar’s entire body had dropped into a narrow hole, with sharp bones piercing its flesh.

Jian Wushuang secretly breathed a sigh of relief; for now, it seemed there weren’t any problems.

However, the disappearance of the wolf pack still made him uneasy. He decided to take the boar and leave immediately. The upper reaches of the forest had always been the territory of the wolves. If he didn’t see any wolves now, there were only two possibilities: either they were all dead, or they had been driven away by some other creature.

Jian Wushuang became more convinced that the wolves had been driven away by something. In the entire valley, the strongest creature must be that tiger king.

It couldn’t possibly be the wild boar that had scared away the wolves, could it?

Jian Wushuang cautiously approached the wild boar, a short spear in his hand. With a single strike, he pierced the boar’s vital points, causing it to close its eyes in an instant.

After hunting down so many beasts, he had long understood their weaknesses. Over a year’s time, he had grown accustomed to it all.

With one hand grasping the wild boar’s ear, he pulled it out of the trap with explosive force, causing the ground to sink beneath its weight.

At the next moment, Jian Wushuang suddenly stopped what he was doing and slowly released the boar. His gaze turned sharp.

A deep, guttural roar resonated from the depths of his throat, shaking loose the dry leaves from the treetops, some of which struck Jian Wushuangs brow.

“Wolves! ”

Jian Wushuang drew a short spear and turned slightly. Seven or eight wild wolves appeared behind him.

In the front, there were several more. He didn’t need to look; the menacing eyes of the wolves on both sides were exposed.

What had to happen finally happened. He dared to enter the valley, and the wolves didn’t care as long as he was alone. But now his hunting had threatened the wolf pack.

Wolves!

These animals had an acute sense of danger. Jian Wushuang, as a hunter, had seriously threatened them. The wolves used all their cunning, just like the mantis preying on the cicada while the oriole lurked behind.

The low growls sent shivers down one’s spine.

At this moment, armed only with his physical strength, Jian Wushuang found it somewhat challenging to deal with the wolf pack. He wasn’t very familiar with their strength.

He moved his feet lightly, holding a short spear in each hand, ready to strike at any moment.

Move!

In an instant, the surrounding wolf pack rushed toward him like a swift wind. With one leap, they covered several yards, forcing Jian Wushuang to retreat.

But there was no way to retreat now; he only had to choose the path that seemed easier to traverse and prepare to fight his way out!

Stepping forward, Jian Wushuang aimed at a lone wolf that had fallen behind. His spear struck out, instantly killing it, then he swiftly turned and left his previous position.

In just the time it took to turn, several wild wolves attacked his previous spot. Their speed was incredibly fast.

Ambushes, traps, and ambushes again.

These wolves had come prepared; it seemed they were determined to keep him here.

In the span of only an incense stick burning, Jian Wushuangs short spears were all used up, killing several wild wolves. Now, he had no spears left, only a bone sword.

The bone sword was made from a cow’s bone, three feet long, with an unblemished edge.

Swish!

With the swordsmanship he had mastered, Jian Wushuang effortlessly wielded the sword, its tip spinning around, keeping the wild wolves at bay..
