Chapter 3601: Escape

“Little guy, are you okay?” Temporal Temple Master looked at Jian Wushuang.

“I’m fine, but I’ve already used the life-saving command talisman you gave me,” Jian Wushuang said.

“That’s good. As for the life-saving command talisman...I only gave it to you in the Divine Beginning Realm, but in the Universe Battlefield, it can’t completely protect you from death. Moreover, you’re facing a Ruler who specializes in space-time techniques.” Temporal Temple Master smiled slightly, then, he looked at the two people in front of him.

“The two of you should be from Devil Cloud Star, right? I wonder if that Devil Cloud Star Master is doing well?” The Temporal Temple Master asked.

“My Star Master has great strength. Naturally, he’s doing very well. You’re the Temporal Temple Master from the Divine Beginning Realm? It seems that you’re just a low-level Ruler.” The tall man stared at the Temporal Temple Master, there was a hint of disdain between his brows.

Rulers had different levels of power.

A low-grade Ruler was at the bottom of the Rulers. Even though the tall man and the devilish young man were only at the low-grade Ruler Realm, the two of them had great backgrounds and had seen many things. They were also extremely powerful, an ordinary low-grade Ruler would naturally not take them to heart.

“I know that I’m not strong enough. However, this place is no longer the territory of the Devil Cloud Star. Can the two of you give me some face and call it a day?” The Temporal Temple Master said.

“Call it a day? Temporal Temple Master, you really know how to joke.” The tall man’s voice was cold. “Although you didn’t participate in the battle in the Divine Beginning Realm, you already know the reason behind it. Since that’s the case, you should know the purpose of our trip. If you know what’s good for you, you should just get lost. Otherwise...you should know the consequences.”

“Of course, I know the consequences. However, this little guy is still a member of our Temporal Temple. Right now, he’s right under my nose. As the Temple Master, I can’t just ignore this little guy,” said the Temporal Temple Master.

“If that’s the case, then you should die together with him.” The tall man’s aura was cold, and a shocking killing intent had already burst out from his body.

“Temporal Temple Master, in that battle back then, you were able to keep your life because you hid far away. However, since you want to intervene today, then there’s no need for your Temporal Temple to exist anymore.” The demonic youth said in a low voice.

“Haha!” The Temporal Temple Master suddenly laughed, “The two of you are overestimating yourselves. Although this old man is only a primary Ruler and doesn’t have the confidence to win against any of you one-on-one, if this old man wants to leave, I’m afraid the two of you won’t be able to stop this old man.”

“Really?”

The young man’s eyes turned cold, and the surrounding void instantly froze.

The entire space-time had completely stopped flowing, and everything had stopped moving.

Standing in the void, Jian Wushuang could clearly sense the changes in the surrounding space-time, and he was immediately shocked.

“What a terrifying space-time technique. This man didn’t even use his full strength before,” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

He knew that if the evil-looking young man had used this technique from the beginning, he would not have been able to crush the life-saving talisman.

However, in the face of such a space-time technique, the Temporal Temple Master just smiled and waved his hand. Like a spring breeze, the space-time around him began to revolve again, and the speed was increasing, the area was also growing larger and larger.

In just an instant, the space-time power of this world was completely under the control of Temporal Temple Master.

“How is this possible?” The demonic youth looked at Temporal Temple Master in shock.

“Haha, I’ve already said that if I want to leave, the two of you won’t be able to stop me. Goodbye.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he saw Temporal Temple Master grab Jian Wushuang with one hand. With a flash, he disappeared into the void.

After Temporal Temple Master disappeared, the fast-moving void regained its calm.

The evil-looking young man and the tall man both stood in the void with unsightly expressions, especially the evil-looking young man. He glanced at the void where Temporal Temple Master had disappeared and found that the traces of space-time remained for a brief moment, but suddenly they were completely wiped out, and even he could not continue to chase after them.

“It seems that we have underestimated this Temporal Temple Master.” The demonic youth said in a low voice, “Although this Temporal Temple Master is only a primary Ruler, his usage of spacetime energy is indeed extraordinary. In fact, he is much stronger than me!”

Just now, this demonic youth had actually fought head-on against the Temporal Temple Master.

But the result of this battle was that the Temporal Temple Master had won!

“With a Ruler Realm expert who uses spacetime energy in such a profound way as a helper, it won’t be so easy for us to continue attacking Heavenly Sword Marquis,” the demonic youth said.

“That’s true, but it’s not as if we don’t have a chance. After all, this time, it’s just the two of us. Both of us are only elementary Rulers, and the high Ruler who came with us this time is still on Sacred Island. That treasure is also with him,” the tall man said.

“That’s true.” The evil-looking young man nodded slightly.

“Let’s go back.”

The two Rulers felt a little regretful that they could not kill Jian Wushuang, but they did not give up. Instead, they returned to the Sacred Island and began to think again.

...

In the void, Temporal Temple Master also appeared quietly.

After he appeared, Jian Wushuang immediately looked around, but he did not see the two Rulers again.

“Don’t worry. I’ve erased the traces of space while I’m moving. They won’t be able to catch up,” Temporal Temple Master said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh of relief and then bowed respectfully to Temporal Temple Master. “Thank you for saving me, Temple Master.”

“You’re welcome. You’re a subordinate of the Temporal Temple. It’s my duty to save you.” Temporal Temple Master waved his hand.

Jian Wushuang also smiled, but then he asked, “Temple Master, why are you here?”

Jian Wushuang was indeed puzzled.

“Haha, it’s very simple. I arrived at the Wuxin Lake a few days ago. I originally planned to wait for you at the lake, but on the way, I sensed a strong energy fluctuation in the surrounding void. It must have been an expert at the Ruler Realm, so I went there to take a look. However, before I arrived, I sensed that you used my life-saving talisman...”

Temporal Temple Master paused for a moment and then said, “I immediately understood that the Ruler might be targeting you, so I used spacetime to come here.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and then said in surprise, “Wuxin Lake? You are the Temple Master’s good friend?”
