Chapter 1107: Blood Coldwind

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Boom!”

In an instant, a fearsome gale with huge twisting force struck Jian Wushuang.

He immediately grunted in pain and started burning the Spiritual Power in his body as fuel to utilize the second level of his Dragon Blood Secret Skill.

His speed immediately increased to a hundred times faster, and he tried his best to withstand the impact from the blast. In the end, he managed to force his way out of the Void which the sinkhole was at as well as the impact radius of the gale.

He was deathly pale as he stood on the Void away from the sinkhole. He spat out a large mouthful of blood, and he could feel that his aura had been diminished to pitiful levels.

“Luckily, I’m still alive, even though I was seriously wounded.”

Jian Wushuang wiped away the blood stains on the corner of his mouth and raised his head again, turning his gaze back to the Void surrounding the sinkhole.

The fearsome gale was still sweeping around, smashing anything in its path to bits.

The scene caused the corners of Jian Wushuang’s mouth to twitch; he still had a lingering fear of the gale.

“It’s too dangerous!”?Jian Wushuang thought.

He was in grave danger moments ago, and if his reaction had been only a fraction slower, or if his speed was slightly slower, his figure would definitely have been smashed to smithereens by the impact from the gale; he doubted there would even be any remains of himself left.

“The epicenter of the gale should be the center of the sinkhole. I was only standing at the side of the sinkhole, which was far from its core. Even so, I was seriously wounded even with the protection of the Blood-killing Plate Armor and the Golden Image Secret Skill. Furthermore, the blast only lasted for a while…” Jian Wushuang muttered in awe, his eyes still full of shock.

“Jian Wushuang, if I didn’t see wrongly, this gale should be the Blood Coldwind, something which is seen rarely even in the Eternal Chaotic World. Not only does it contain a terrible twisting power, but the chilling effect it causes is also even more alarming. Most of your wounds were caused by this chilling effect,” Gu King explained.

“Blood Coldwind?” Jian Wushuang asked.

When he briefly made contact with the gale earlier, he had indeed felt an extremely chilly energy rush into his body. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Normally, it’s very hard for the Blood Coldwind to form, but the sinkhole before you just now managed to create such a huge amount of it. If I didn’t guess wrongly, there must be some treasure hidden deep within it. It must be something that’s very chilly and contains an extreme amount of Yin energy. Also, it must be extremely valuable,” said Gu King.

“So what if there’s treasure inside the sinkhole? I can’t get to it, even if it’s a Chaos Divine Treasure,” said Jian Wushuang bitterly.

“That’s true,” said Gu King as he nodded in agreement. He then remained silent.

Both of them knew that there definitely was some sort of treasure at the bottom of the sinkhole, and it was of the extremely rare variety.

Even so, they had no way of obtaining it. After all, Jian Wushuang had barely survived a blast of the gale. Who knew what dangers would be waiting for them at the bottom of the sinkhole?

As such, Jian Wushuang could only stand by anxiously.

He stood silently at the edge of the sinkhole as Gu King slowly began to patch him up.

Before long, the terrible Blood Coldwind had also abated.

Even the Void that had been damaged by the gale had been restored. It was peaceful once again, as if nothing had ever happened before.

Even so, Jian Wushuang, who had just escaped with his life, did not dare to step close to the sinkhole again.

He did not leave, however. He just stood nearby in silence, quietly waiting.

After about one hour, a booming sound rose from the bottom of the sinkhole again.

“Is it starting again?”

Jian Wushuang fled to a safe distance far away from the sinkhole, his gaze remaining fixed on it.

Indeed, with a loud sound, the Blood Coldwind rose out from the sinkhole again.

It destroyed everything in its path like the previous gale did.

This time, Jian Wushuang was far away and unaffected by the gale. He only quietly observed the entire proceedings.

The Blood Coldwind lasted for about the same time that one needed to take 10 breaths, before it abated again.

“10 breaths?”?Jian Wushuang thought as he squinted.

The previous gale also lasted for around the same duration.

Jian Wushuang remained at the same spot, constantly observing gale after gale.

10 days passed by in a jiffy.

Within these 10 days, the Blood Coldwind kept rising out of the sinkhole, and Jian Wushuang kept a close watch on it. He had already spotted the pattern of the gale’s occurrence.

“The Blood Coldwind only gets activated once every hour, and it lasts for the same duration I take 10 breaths every time.

“Apart from that, each time it comes, it’ll carry some Ancient God Power along with it. When it dies down, some of that power remains behind,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

He remained in observation at the same spot for 10 days, witnessing countless gusts of Blood Coldwind rising out from the sinkhole. He noticed a droplet of Ancient God Power left behind after one such gale abated, leading him to realize that not only was there a treasure of extreme Yin energy in the sinkhole, there was also plenty of Ancient God Power in it as well.

The Ancient God Power was extremely pure and condensed by at least Six-star Ancient God. Naturally, even the Blood Coldwind could not easily destroy such power, and as a result, it must have remained intact at the bottom of the sinkhole.

Jian Wushuang now understood why he managed to see four droplets of Ancient God Power at the sinkhole earlier on.

After coming to a complete understanding of the regularity of the gales, he took out his animal hide map.

“The location I’m currently at is…”

After identifying his location on the map, he left a mark which contained a message.

The message was about the uniqueness of the sinkhole, as well as the regularity of the gales. Aside, Jian Wushuang also named the sinkhole Chillywind Valley.

“This vast battlefield is fraught with dangers. Who knows how many places like Chillywind Valley can be found in it? Now that I’ve found and marked one, the chances of survival of Green Fire Palace experts who choose to wander in it will increase slightly,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

The other experts from the Green Fire Palace would also mark their maps in a similar fashion when they came to new places or danger zones in previously uncharted territory.

After returning to the Green Fire Palace, they would hand over their maps to the respective Palace Masters, who would reorganize them and pass on information about the newly discovered danger zones to every expert still wandering in the battlefield, so that they could avoid going into these areas and remain safe.

As a member of the Green Fire Palace, Jian Wushuang had to play his part.

He still remained standing in the Void at the edge of Chillywind Valley; he was in no hurry to leave. Just at this moment… a message was transmitted to him via the token in his Interspatial Ring.
