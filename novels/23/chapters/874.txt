Chapter 875: Star Jade Wall

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“It’s nearly impossible to pass the Dao Master level test. Therefore, even though strong enough to break through to Dao Master, some Eternal Realms on the Star Island keep suppressing their realm to maintain in the Eternal Realm,” Qian Yu said. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Suppressing their realm?” Jian Wushuang was shocked to hear that.

He knew about that.

However, who would suppress their realm on purpose?

Everyone wanted to be the best. The stronger, the better.

“As far as I estimate, there are at least ten among the Twelve Kings who are able to break through to Dao Master. They just keep suppressing it and taking the Eternal Realm level test,” Qian Yu continued.

“As regards to the five Dao Masters, they couldn’t pass the first level test when they were an Eternal Realm. Actually, they were way too far from passing that. Therefore, they chose to break through to Dao Master so that they could at least learn the Top Nine Secret Skills earlier.”

“I see,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Since it was impossible to pass the Eternal Realm level test, they turned to break through to Dao Master instead for a bold try by cultivating the strongest Secret Skills.

“Never mind. There’s no need to talk about this. I will show you the two opportunity lands so you can see by yourself,” Qian Yu said, leading Jian Wushuang towards another direction.

They arrived in a group of pavilions soon.

There were more than ten pavilions jamming together. Each of them was very vast but not tall.

“Here is where the Star Jade Wall located, one of the two Opportunity Lands of Star Island.” Qian Yu pointed at the pavilions and introduced, “the Star Jade Walls were in those pavilions and differentiated.”

“There are jade walls focusing on Sword Principle, Saber Principle, Spear Principle, Axe?Principle and so on.”

“You are good at Sword Principle so you might need the Sword Principle jade walls.”

JIan Wushuang nodded.

“They are over there. Let me show you.” Qian Yu took Jian Wushuang to one pavilion.

It was an open broad hall with some people in it. They were all sitting cross-legged on the ground and looking at the jade walls on both sides of the hall. It seemed that they were completely enchanted in that.

Jian Wushuang looked over too.

The walls on both sides of the hall were paved with jades, forming two giant jade walls.

There were some lifelike patterns carved on them.

Each pattern showed a person wielding a longsword. They just looked identical, nothing different.

However, there were 16 of them on the jade walls.

“Blood Mountain, here is the Star Jade Wall. The patterns on the jade walls contains profound opportunities. It seems like they are identical at the first glance but if you look closely, you will find out each on them is unique.” Qian Yu introduced.

Jian Wushuang nodded. He found a spot and sat down cross-legged as everybody else, looking up at the patterns.

He looked at the first one.

The pattern was ordinary just watching by eyes. Nothing special.

However, Jian Wushuang concentrated his Sword Heart. It changed immediately when watching by heart.

The man with a longsword started moving.

Hum...The pattern flipped.

It was a vast world. The weather was nice and everything was calm.

In the middle of the world, there was a middle-aged man wearing a rain cape and a bamboo hat. He was holding a cyan longsword. There was an immaterial air flow around him.

Then he moved.

Quick and neat.

Lifting his cyan longsword, he hacked the giant lake below him.

All at a sudden, the world was tore apart. An intense immaterial flow spread around crazily.

The huge cyan sword shadow hacked downwards to the center of the lake.

A huge straight gully appeared instantly in the middle of the lake, splitting it into two parts. The water from the lake started running into the gully.

It was weird that such powerful hack only caused the gully. There was no ripple, no spray. Let alone pounding wave.

Incredible skill.

After that, the man withdrew slowly and stood there. The pattern was then gone.

Jian Wushuang was totally shocked.

He had witnessed the whole process.

It was incredible to him.

“How come? It was strong enough to split the lake apart but didn’t cause any waves?”

“Even a little stone dropping into a still lake will cause a circle of ripples. It’s impossible for causing nothing. But...”

Jian Wushuang couldn’t figure it out.

Since he was good at Sword Principle, it was easy for him to hack a huge gully in the lake by one strike.

However, it was impossible for him to hack such huge gully without causing any waves.

Incredible!

It was really incredible to him.

Taking a deep breath, he then looked at the second pattern.

The pattern flipped too.

Boom Boom Pow... Jian Wushuang saw an endless sea of fire.

With extraordinarily high temperature, the sea of fire was burning the air, burning the whole world.

There was also a man wearing a rain cape and a bamboo hat standing in the middle of the fire.

The destructive fire didn’t burn him to death. Even his clothes was intact.

Holding a longsword, he was standing quietly in the sea of fire, like the master of it.

Right at the moment, he draw his sword.
