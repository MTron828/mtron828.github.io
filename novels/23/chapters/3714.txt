Chapter 3715: Was Easily Obtained

“Do you know your current location?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I should be on the fourth continent,” Temporal Temple Master said.

“I’m on the Sixth Continent. What about you, Heavenly Sword Marquis?” Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master asked.

“I was teleported to a wasteland. There’s nothing within a radius of 100,000 kilometers that I can identify. So I don’t know which continent I’m on,” Jian Wushuang said.

There were seven continents in the First Heaven of the Red Cloud World.

Except for the Seventh Continent, which was in the center, the other six continents were scattered around and close to each other. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Before entering the Red Cloud World, Jian Wushuang had obtained a star map of the seven continents in the Red Cloud World. On the star map, there were many marked places on the continents, including mountains, bloody rocks, and so on, there were also some abandoned buildings and even some battlefields.

These things were easy to identify. However, there were no such things within a radius of 100,000 miles in the wilderness where Jian Wushuang was now.

“My young friend, you should find out which continent you are on as soon as possible,” Temporal Temple Master said.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Suddenly...buzz!

A majestic aura suddenly came from the void not far away, causing the heaven and earth to tremble.

“What’s this?” Jian Wushuang’s expression could not help but change.

“What’s wrong?” Temporal Temple Master asked.

“It seems that my luck is good. As soon as I came to the Red Cloud World, I encountered the birth of a true treasure. Judging from the aura of the true treasure, its level is not low,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“In that case, go and fight for it. Try to get as many supreme treasures as you can,” Temporal Temple Master said.

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang smiled with a hint of excitement in his eyes, “Judging from its aura, I’m afraid that the place where the Supreme Treasure was born is about 500,000 miles away from me. With my speed, I can reach it in a moment.”

Jian Wushuang immediately rushed toward the place where the Supreme Treasure was born at his fastest speed.

Soon, Jian Wushuang arrived at the place where the Supreme Treasure was born.

He saw a dark golden long stick floating in the void, surrounded by a layer of dark golden light. The aura of the supreme treasure was emitted from the long stick.

“A top-tier Universe Supreme Treasure?” Jian Wushuang could not help but smile.

When he arrived in the void, the dark golden long staff had completely appeared.

For a moment…

“Snatch!”

“Hurry up and snatch the Supreme Treasure!”

“This long staff is mine!”

There were 17 Principles Masters who had arrived in the void earlier than Jian Wushuang. Among them, there were seven at the peak of the Void Fifth Realm and ten at the sixth realm, one of them was an expert at the peak of the sixth realm!

The 17 Principles Masters rushed out at the same time after the dark golden long staff was completely born.

The fight began in an instant.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

A series of violent explosions could be heard.

At this moment, these Principles Masters unleashed their strongest strength. Some of them held magic weapons and rushed forward to fight. Some of them used their true treasures or secret skills to help their experts fight for the true treasures, some of them used escape techniques to sneak toward the long staff.

Those Principles Masters who could reach the peak of the fifth level of the Void Space Realm or the sixth level of the Void Space Realm were all powerful and had extraordinary techniques. At this moment, in order to fight for the true treasures, they were displaying their power and techniques to the fullest.

However, among the 17 Principles Masters present, the most dazzling one was still the peak of the sixth level. He was the most powerful, and he was also very good at protecting his body. He directly relied on his tyrannical power and protective ability to charge at the front, he even easily pushed back the two senior great beings of the sixth level who were fighting with him.

In the blink of an eye, he had already arrived in front of the dark golden long staff. He was less than 100 meters away from the dark golden long staff.

“Haha, this top-tier universe true treasure is mine.” The wild man who looked like a savage laughed loudly.

Suddenly, a phantom-like figure appeared in the void space in front of him. It was also beside the dark golden long staff.

As soon as this figure appeared, he waved his hand and kept the dark golden long staff into his interspatial ring.

This scene caused the savage-like man’s face to instantly turn ferocious.

“Escape art?”

“You dare to steal my treasure? You’re courting death!”

The savage-like man’s eyes were burning with rage. He didn’t even look at the other party’s appearance. He only saw that after the other party kept the dark golden long staff into his interspatial ring, he immediately attacked. A huge axe was swung out like lightning…the huge axe was surrounded by layers of flames, which burned the void crazily. In the blink of an eye, it had appeared in front of his opponent.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold.

“Swish!”

A sword essence instantly gathered in front of him.

This sword essence seemed weak, but when it flew out and hit your huge axe, it instantly sent the huge axe flying. The sword essence did not lose its momentum and swept past the savage-looking man’s neck.

The savage-like man widened his eyes. It was not until he was about to die that he was able to truly see the other party’s appearance.

At the same time, he also understood why he, a powerful expert at the peak of the sixth level, did not even have the slightest chance to struggle before he was instantly killed by the other party.

“So it’s him?”

The savage-like man was filled with unwillingness and fear, but his voice had already been completely cut off.

In the surrounding void, the other 16 Principles Masters who wanted to fight for the dark-gold long staff were terrified when they saw this scene.

They did not recognize Jian Wushuang at first, but after the savage-looking man died, they immediately recognized him.

“It’s Heavenly Sword Marquis!”

“Blood Sword Master?”

“Go, hurry up and leave!”

None of the 16 Principles Masters present hesitated. They no longer had any greed for the dark golden long staff. They immediately turned around and left this place at the fastest speed possible.

No one dared to stay even half a step, let alone fight for it.

What a joke. This starfield acknowledged that the strongest Principles Master, Blood Sword Master, was there. How could they fight for it?

Even if all of them joined hands, Blood Sword Master could easily kill them all.

In the blink of an eye, all the Principles Masters in the area had left, and the fight was over.

“A top-tier universe true treasure, so easy to get?” Jian Wushuang stood there with both hands, a strange smile on his face.

What he did not know was that there were too many universe true treasures in the Red Cloud World.

If he were to wander in the three battlefields, even in the deepest part of the battlefield, he would usually need to spend some time in the drill ground to encounter a higher-tier true treasure, however, in the Red Cloud World...there were countless high-tier and top-tier universe true treasures. With his battle strength, it was easy for him to get a top-tier universe true treasure.
