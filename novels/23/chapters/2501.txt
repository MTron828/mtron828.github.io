Chapter 2502: Golden Glaze Life Armor

“This Life Armor is able to reach the Heavenly Treasure level with just two drops of blood essence. What kind of blood essence is that?” Master Kun was astonished.

Jian Wushuang, who was standing beside had also felt the aura emanating from the Life Armor. A wide smile appeared on his face.

“Judging from the aura, this must be really powerful. Master Kun, should I continue dripping blood essence into it?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Master Kun was startled. He took a serious look at the battle armor and then shook his head. “No, Master Jian. Your blood essences are extraordinary. Merely two drops of your blood essence have pushed this Life Armor to its endurance limit. Another drop of blood essence might immediately destroy it.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and stopped putting in more of his blood essence.

Master Kun’s eyes flashed as he waved his big hand and sent several palm prints in the direction of the Life Armor.

“It’s done!”

After he solemnly announced the end of the cultivation, the golden light finally dissipated. The Life Armor which was enveloped by the golden light descended from floating in the void. Without any guidance, it floated towards Jian Wushuang.

It was Jian Wushuang who fed it his own blood essence after all. It had become a Heavenly Treasure with unlimited potential. The Life Armor certainly knew who its owner was.

After Jian Wushuang tried the Life Armor on, the armor immediately bonded with him.

“Oh, this little guy is still acting like a baby to me.” Jian Wushuang smiled at it with great interest after he had established a connection with the spirit of the armor.

“Master Jian, the armor is done but it hasn’t got a name. Why don’t you think of a name?” Master Kun suggested.

“Name...” Jian Wushuang gently stroked the armor in front of him. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The armor was golden in color with its extremely smooth surface which exuded a faint metallic luster, like a shimmering phantom.

“Let’s call it Golden Glazed Life Armor.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The armor responded happily to its name with a slight quiver.

Using his mind to control, the Golden Glazed Life Armor immediately turned into golden light which covered Jian Wushuang’s body. In an instant, Jian Wushuang’s whole body was completely covered by the armor. It was very delicate, beautiful, and fitted seamlessly on Jian Wushuang’s perfect figure. Jian Wushuang stood majestically like a golden God of War.

Jian Wushuang then started moving around and the golden battle armor covering his body immediately transformed into an exquisite golden robe.

“Haha, not bad.”

Jian Wushuang laughed, obviously very satisfied with the Golden Glazed Life Armor.

Not only was he satisfied, but he could also feel the armor’s power.

The Golden Glazed Life Armor at the Heavenly Treasure level had terrifying physical protection capability. Jian Wushuang did not have time to cultivate the Nine Sparkle Star Armor, hence his overall strength would increase significantly after he did so and the Golden Glazed Life Armor’s prowess would then be fully displayed.

“Oh yes...” Jian Wushuang was reminded of something, “Master Kun, I have a Life Divine Weapon with me...”

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and took out his Blood Mountain Sword.

“This weapon has been with me for many years, but it didn’t absorb my blood essence when it was being cultivated. I have also not been able to feed it with my own blood essence. I wonder if you can temper it again and figure out a way for it to absorb my blood essence?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Jian Wushuang could feel the Blood Mountain Sword’s excitement in his hand as he spoke.

Blood Mountain Sword was his closest comrade.

It had been with him since his last life till the current. In his last life, Jian Wushuang’s life rating was only average. He was able to occasionally feed the sword with his blood essence.

In his current life, the Blood Mountain Sword was no longer able to absorb his blood essence after he became a Perfect Chaotic Creature.

Master Kun was quite surprised. “This is your Life Weapon but it hasn’t absorbed your blood essence before? Show me the sword.”

Jian Wushuang handed the Blood Mountain Sword to Master Kun.

Master Kun cautiously took over and brushed his fingers along the blade. He went wide-eyed. “Good sword, t-this... It’s perfect. This sword, regardless it’s the external look or internal structure was done perfectly in every cultivation step without any flaws.”

“This is my first time seeing such a perfect weapon!”

Master Kun’s heart skipped a beat.

In the cultivation process of a weapon, subtle errors such as heat, the quantity of materials used, and so on were inevitable no matter how careful the craftmaster was.

However, those minute errors gave no impact on Jian Wushuang.

There were craftmasters with extraordinary abilities that enabled them to cultivate divine weapons without a single error. Those types of craftmasters only existed in legends and were at least seventh-grade or even eighth-grade craftmasters.

For a Fourth-Grade Craftmaster such as Master Kun, this perfect weapon was a myth.

“Who’s that? Master Jian Wushuang, who’s the craftmaster who cultivated this weapon?” Master Kun asked in an electrified tone.

“Master Kun, you don’t have to know who made it. You only have to tell me whether you are able to help me,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“Mmm...” Master Kun pondered for a moment before answering seriously, “I’ve never seen the materials used to make this sword but there might be a possibility to recultivate it and feed your blood essence to it. The bad news is that a Fourth-Grade Craftmaster like myself is unable to do so.

Master Kun helplessly smiled.

A Fourth-Grade Craftmaster was the top craftmaster in the Wusha Wilderness, but in the entire Ancient God Domain, fourth-grade meant nothing. There were craftmasters who were much stronger.

Master Kun was unable to fulfill Jian Wushuang’s request.

“Is that so? Which grades of craftmasters are needed to meet my requirements?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“At least a Seventh-Grade Craftmaster but the craftmaster at the peak of seventh-grade might still fail, hence an Eighth-Grade Craftmaster might stand a much better chance of success,” said Master Kun.

“Peak of seventh-grade or an Eighth-Grade Craftmaster?” Jian Wushuang was shocked to find out.

In a small place like Wusha Wilderness, it was difficult to even find a Fourth-Grade Craftmaster. Jian Wushuang found Master Kun after much effort.

Someone at the peak of seventh-grade and the eighth-grade was still too far fetched for Jian Wushuang.

“You heard that, little guy. You’ll have to wait for a little while longer to absorb my blood essence.” Jian Wushuang helplessly stroked the Blood Mountain Sword.
