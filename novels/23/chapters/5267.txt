Within the scope of the One Thought Universe, Jian Wushuang keenly sensed and identified the breach.

7,200 swords soared into the air in an instant.

Jian Wushuang roared in anger. The Transcendent Immortal Formation traversed the void, heading toward the city wall.

Right from the beginning, he hadn‚Äôt expected these people to hold their ground.

Even a million would be difficult for them to defend against.

Now, he had to rely on himself. If the city wall broke, all his previous efforts would be in vain. He had to at least break through the eleventh wave and merge the Candle Dragon Wings with the Eye of the Candle Dragon.

He was only one water crystal origin source away from this goal. This was his top priority. So, for this ninth wave, he had already considered it. If necessary, he would use the sword formation to guard the city wall. Alone, he would employ brute force to block the remaining Devouring Demons.

Once he lost the sword formation, he could only rely on the power of his origin source and divine body to stop those Devouring Demons.

At that point, he would have no greater means of attack. Killing those Devouring Demons would become exceedingly slow, and he would find himself in a desperate situation.

‚ÄúEnlarge!

Hum!

Jian Wushuangs figure expanded from ten thousand to tens of millions of feet in size. Despite his massive size, his speed remained undiminished, blocking the millions of Devouring Demons in front of Qjuhuang City.

Currently, there were only around two million attackers left. With the

Transcendent Immortal Formation, he only needed to hold out for an hour. An hour was enough time to slaughter all the attacking Devouring Demons!

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs really seeking death!‚Äù Si Tian noticed Jian Wushuangs actions, especially when he saw the sword formation descending onto the city wall, helping others defend it.

Losing this means of defense would put Jian Wushuang in the midst of the enemy army, extremely dangerous. Once he lost too much Yan power, weakening his strength, there was a risk of falling.

‚ÄúBurn all your origin source! Hold them off for me, or we‚Äôll all die!‚Äù

Si Tian roared, pulling a few frightened individuals into the mass of Devouring Demons behind him. Their figures instantly turned into blood mist, ultimately consumed by those Devouring Demons.

He also took the initiative to burn his origin source, sparing no loss to his divine body, crazily killing the Devouring Demons climbing up the city wall.

Jian Wushuang had to hold on; otherwise, they would be finished.

Dao Lord Si Tian clearly understood the current situation. If the city walls were breached, even if they survived, they wouldn‚Äôt be able to participate in the subsequent battles or the second phase of the trial. They would be doomed.

Boom!

Another defensive line shattered.

Fortunately, the sword formation continued to slaughter the Devouring Demons attempting to break the barrier. Without it, the walls would have been breached long ago.

Jian Wushuang stood tall, his arms extending for miles. In the One Thought Universe, his strength multiplied several times. Although he didn‚Äôt have the sword formation, his divine body had reached 8,000 times its normal power.

His Extreme origin source was incredibly profound. Even if he burned his origin source power for an hour, he wouldn‚Äôt suffer the slightest damage.

The situation was dire for the other three city walls as well.

Outside the city walls where Leng Shuang and Xue Yue were at, a snowy world overlapped and descended. Their methods were similar, allowing them to barely hold their ground.

Moreover, aside from these two, there was another individual displaying Dao Lord-level power. Wielding a chilling spear, they traversed the battlefield, causing chaos in the heavens and earth.

The Grand Yan Immortals on the city walls were better equipped than those in the eastern city, with a significant numerical advantage. After fighting for so long, there were still 50,000 of them, including ten half-step Dao Lords.

For a moment, they managed to block millions of Devouring Demons.

If Jian Wushuang knew, he would surely be astounded; the difference was too vast.

On Wan Xings side, the situation was even better. He single-handedly controlled all directions, and his grand seal instantly obliterated tens of thousands of Devouring Demons. The Grand Yan Immortals on the city walls suffered almost no losses.

Such formidable power left the onlookers in awe.

As for Hu Qing and Ji Chaoyangs situation, it seemed to be reversing.

Now, even the city walls were on the brink of collapse.

Hu Qing alone held back five million Devouring Demons, while Ji Chaoyang on the city walls managed to stop nearly three million of them.

But it was of no use; the city walls would inevitably be breached sooner or later, especially with the fall of the Grand Yan Immortals. Initially, their strength had been preserved most intact, with nearly 70,000 people during the ninth wave. However, in less than an hour of fighting, 50,000 had fallen.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over!‚Äù Ji Chaoyangs attempts to rescue were futile. He had made breakthroughs in the spatial origin source, but the added power was not enough to turn the tide. Even with his desperate efforts, he was just a top-tier Dao Lord among tne Dao Lords.

In such a battle, it was hard to reverse the situation without the power of a half-step Emperor.

‚ÄúHu Qing!‚Äù Ji Chaoyang murmured softly. Seeing Hu Qing single-handedly stopping five million Devouring Demons, he was left speechless.

He glanced at the other Grand Yan Immortals, who were hesitant and fearful. ‚ÄúThey are all useless!‚Äù he shouted in anger.

Had they fought with such desperation from the beginning, their situation might not have been so dire. The real problem lay in their overprotective nature toward those they shielded. Now, in the true heat of battle, some were too afraid to burn their origin source and fight with their full strength. Consequently, they fell before they could unleash their power.

‚ÄúBreak!‚Äù Ji Chaoyang shouted, his spear like a dragon, dispersing tens of thousands of Devouring Demons.

He moved on to other breached defenses. The scene here was even more gruesome than Jian Wushuangs side. However, his strength was on par with Dao Lord Si Tian, making it hard for him to make a significant impact.

Deep within the horde of Devouring Demons, Hu Qing was bathing in a divine light, illuminating the heavens and the earth. The power of Samsara seemed boundless; he was invincible.

With one strike, he stirred the winds and clouds, killing tens of thousands of Devouring Demons. Looking back, the city walls were now in shambles.

Hu Oing sighed softly. He had witnessed this scene before! It was the skeletal battlefield in the Great Desolate Wilderness!

In just over a decade, he had transformed from a young novice monk into an unparalleled genius, even prompting the Qishen Temple to bestow their inheritance upon him.

However, only he knew the trials of his previous life, the price he paid for his current unparalleled bravery.

The last time, several masters had fallen, and it was only through Jian Wushuangs desperate efforts that he had survived.

At that time, he had been even more desperate, but he had ultimately made it out alive.

Even in those desperate circumstances, Jian Wushuang had managed to save him. That determination was awe-inspiring. Now, with their positions reversed, he hesitated to save others.

He remembered the last scene of the inheritance, a bearded old man saying, ‚ÄúChild, fate is cyclical; we each have our destinies. This tribulation, you cannot escape it!‚Äù

After those words, the old man left him with a golden hoop in his heart.

‚ÄúSuppress the Demons!‚Äù

Banish all the demons, let no demons dwell within.

Buzz!

‚ÄúFor a greater good!‚Äù

Hu Qing roared. The golden hoop instantly rose, flying out from his heart and appearing on his forehead. At this moment, his eyes glowed golden, and the Devouring Demons appeared as filthy creatures in his eyes.

‚ÄúThey all deserve to die!‚Äù

His staff struck down again, annihilating a million Devouring Demons.

This immense aura dispersed the battlefield..
