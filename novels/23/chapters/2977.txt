Chapter 2978: Concealing One’s Aura?

——

That slash was too bright and dazzling.

However, at the same time, it appeared too dark. It was as if there was no end to the darkness and the sky was boundless.

Wherever the slash went, everything seemed like a piece of paper.

“Not good!”

The Barbarian King turned pale with fright. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Although Jian Wushuang could tell that the Barbarian King was not weak, so he had tried his best from the beginning, he was still shocked when his opponent attacked him.

This saber attack carried an earth-shaking power that even he could not help but feel suffocated.

Without any hesitation, he immediately used his strongest axe, using all of his power to block this saber attack.

Clang!

The sound of metal colliding was heard.

At the same time, the Barbarian King’s body started to shake crazily. He spat out a mouthful of blood and his divine body almost collapsed.

The Barbarian king did not say anything and immediately retreated.

Prince Qian Chen glanced at the Barbarian King in surprise. “You could take my attack head-on, but your divine body didn’t collapse. You’re not bad.”

“Die!”

A stern shout suddenly sounded, and two figures appeared behind Prince Qian Chen at some point in time.

These two figures were none other than Puyu and Xue Dong King.

Both of them had the battle power of a True Saint. When they saw that Prince Qian Chen’s strength was extraordinary, they immediately launched a sneak attack to kill him.

However, Prince Qian Chen had already noticed it.

“Ridiculous.”

His Highness Qianchen smiled faintly and casually waved the battle saber in his hand.

It was like a black moon that directly covered both Puyu and Xue Dong King.

The black moon contained a shocking blade intent.

Puyu’s divine body immediately collapsed from that.

As for Xue Dong King, he only possessed the combat strength of a True Saint. He was not a True Saint and had yet to control his undying body. Once his divine body collapsed, he would definitely die.

Fortunately, Xue Dong King had obtained 50 million sacred elixirs in one go. He had used them to exchange for many treasures from Lord Tianshou, including a powerful protective treasure. Because of this protective treasure, he survived the attack and did not die immediately.

However, he also spat out three mouthfuls of blood in a row. He could not be more miserable.

“Xue Dong King.”

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed, and he immediately stepped forward.

He did not care who died in the Barbarian King Team, but Xue Dong King had a good relationship with him.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis.” Xue Dong King’s face was pale. He was so weak that he could barely stand. He glanced at Jian Wushuang and said in a deep voice, “This man is too strong. We can’t fight him. It’s up to you!”

“Okay.” Jian wushuang nodded and then looked at Prince Qian Chen.

Prince Qian Chen’s target was the corpse of the Dragon Flame Beast. After destroying the divine body of Puyu and severely injuring Xue Dong King, he had already charged toward the Barbarian King again.

He could see that the Barbarian King was the strongest in the Barbarian King Team. 80% of the corpse of the Dragon Flame Beast was beaten up by the Barbarian King.

Boom! Boom!

Facing the terrifying power of Prince Qian Chen, the Barbarian King could not resist at all. In just a moment, his body collapsed and began to reassemble for the first time.

Prince Qian Chen stood at the place where the Barbarian King’s body reassembled. He waited for his body to finish reassembling before he attacked again and caused the Barbarian King’s body to collapse for the second time.

But at this moment…whoosh!

A figure suddenly came from the void next to him.

“Eh?”

His Highness Qian Chen glanced at the void next to him and found that the aura coming from the person who came to kill him was only that of a Divine Master.

“A Divine Master?” His Highness Qian Chen had a strange look on his face.

However, at the same time that this Divine Master moved, the god power aura on his body suddenly soared. At the same time, a large amount of golden god power condensed behind him, forming a 30,000 feet tall Golden Emperor Phantom.

The Golden Eyes of the Golden Emperor Phantom looked down on everything, causing Prince Qianchen to be a little surprised.

The seven-star secret technique, the Heaven Punisher, and the nine luminaries star armor had all been used.

Hua!

An ice-cold sword light flew over like an arc of lightning.

Prince Qianchen did not care at first. He just waved his right hand, and the battle saber in his hand mercilessly descended.

This saber also contained great power, enough to easily kill a Peak False Saint. Even an ordinary first-level True Saint’s divine body would probably collapse under this saber. Using such a saber to kill a supreme god…was simply overkill.

But in the end…

Clang!

The sound of metal colliding rang out.

His Highness Qian Chen actually felt his right hand sink. This was because it was affected by a huge force.

“This…” Prince Qian Chen raised his head in surprise and saw a cold gray mask.

“Humph!”

With a low shout, Prince Qian Chen swept his saber essence and moved his body instantly.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

As if teleporting, Prince Qian Chen moved through the void.

The strange and dark saber light appeared behind Jian Wushuang and slashed toward his head.

However, the saber light did not touch anything solid.

“Afterimage!” Prince Qian Chen was shocked. He had already noticed that a large number of sword shadows were attacking him.

Prince Qian Chen also drew his saber instantly.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

In the blink of an eye, dozens of metal-like sounds were heard in the void.

Every time they collided, a surge of divine power burst out.

In the surrounding void, the Barbarian King Team members, including the Barbarian King and Puyu, whose divine bodies had been reconstructed, were also shocked.

“This, this speed…”

“Fast, too fast!”

“What a terrifying speed. Previously, the captain also burst out his full speed, but now, the speed burst out by the black-robed young man and Heavenly Sword Marquis is at least ten times faster than the captain’s full speed. Moreover, the power unleashed by the two of them…”

The members of the Barbarian King Team could clearly sense the terrifying power contained in the sword light and saber shadow.

The power of any saber move was ridiculously strong.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

In the void, the two figures who had exchanged more than a hundred head-on blows finally pulled away.

A strange light flashed in Prince Qian Chen’s eyes as he stared at Jian Wushuang with bright eyes, “It seems that I was wrong. I thought you were just a Divine Master, but now it seems that you are the most powerful expert on this team. Your battle strength is probably at the peak of a rank one True Saint. However, your ability to hide your aura is really amazing. I can’t see through it at all.”

“Hide your aura?” Jian Wushuang smiled wickedly.

He did not hide his aura at all. His true realm was only that of a Divine Master.

However, His Highness Qian Chen thought that he was too strong and was beyond the realm of a Divine Master, so he thought that he was just hiding his aura.
