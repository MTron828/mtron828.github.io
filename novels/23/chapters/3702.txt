Chapter 3703: Probing

“You’re right. If they hadn’t fused the universe essence of Sword Dao into it, they wouldn’t have been able to instantly unleash such terrifying speed with the power of an ordinary Principles Master.” Xuan Yan nodded as well.

“The two of them are only at the beginning. Right now, they are just testing the waters, but even so, this scene is still quite shocking.” The Temporal Temple Master laughed.

These Rulers were powerful and had high standards, so they were able to see many things.

They knew that Jian Wushuang and Di Shisan were just testing the waters and had not really done anything yet.

Even so, the flashing figures and the sword shadows that burst out in an instant still shocked the surrounding spectators.

Both of them only used the power of ordinary Principles Masters, but after activating the universe origin of sword principle, their terrifying swordsmanship was still beyond the power of ordinary Principles Masters.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

Dozens of clashing sounds rang out, and Jian Wushuang and Di Shisan finally separated.

“Jian Wushuang, it seems that I have underestimated you. I thought that you had just reached the fourth level of sword principle, so you should not have a deep understanding of the universe origin of sword principle. You should only have a little understanding. I didn’t expect that your understanding of the universe origin of Sword Principle has reached a certain level. You are not inferior to me at all.”

Di Shisan stood there with a rare look of excitement on his cold face, this kind of excitement was only possible when one met a real opponent.

“The same goes for you. You are indeed the first person in the Divine Beginning Realm to step into the fourth level and master the origin of the universe of sword principle. Your understanding of the origin of the universe of sword principle was already so amazing when the Seven Star Mysterious Sect was destroyed. If it weren’t for the fact that you were in a deep sleep later on, with your talent in sword principle, your comprehension of the origin of the universe of sword principle would have already reached a new level that I can only look up to.” Jian Wushuang also praised.

Both of them had tested each other’s comprehension level of the universe origin of sword principle.

Obviously, their comprehension level of the universe origin of sword principle was about the same.

Because of this, the two of them were evenly matched in the test fight, and there was no difference in the speed of their swordsmanship.

In fact, only Jian Wushuang knew that the reason why he could be evenly matched with Di Shisan was mainly because he had been comprehending the secret inscriptions in the Heaven Suppression Tablet for the past 30 years, it was extremely helpful to his sword principle, which deepened his comprehension of the universe origin of sword principle.

However, if he had not made progress in the past 30 years and fought with Di Shisan at his peak 30 years ago, his comprehension of the universe origin of sword principle would definitely be inferior to Di Shisan’s.

“Jian Wushuang, I already know the level of your comprehension of the universe origin of sword principle. What I want to know next is your attainments in swordsmanship,” Di Shisan said.

“I’m looking forward to it too,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“In that case, I’ll draw my sword.” Di Shisan’s face was cold, but the sword in his hand suddenly burst out with a bright light.

The light was like a huge sun. It was vast and majestic. Countless powerful sword essences were completely condensed in the sun.

Di Shisan drew his sword.

He did not move. He just pointed the sword in his hand in the direction of Jian Wushuang.

In an instant, the huge sword essence ‘sun’ swept out. When it appeared in the Void where Jian Wushuang was, it directly exploded.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!

Countless solemn and cold sword shadows formed a huge sea of sword essence in an instant.

The Sea of sword essence covered the sky and covered the earth. For a moment, it crazily pressed down on Jian Wushuang from all directions.

It was like an extremely powerful sword principle domain. In this sea of sword essence, Di Shisan was like the master of sword principle.

“The two of them are finally getting serious,” Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master, who was watching the battle, said.

“Watch carefully.” Temporal Temple Master also revealed an expectant look.

Jian Wushuang, who was completely covered by the sword principle domain, was surprised when he saw the scene around him.

“This move...is so familiar.”

He knew this move.

In his previous life, he had encountered a crisis in the Eternal Chaotic World. When he faced the blood emperor from the blood clan, Di Shisan had fought with him and used the same move.

However, because he was in the Eternal Chaotic World and was restricted by the Heavenly Dao, Di Shisan only had the strength of a half-step divine devil. The power of this move was probably less than one-millionth of its original power.

Until now, Di Shisan’s strength had recovered to its peak. Without any restrictions, the true power of this move had been fully displayed in his hands.

The sword essence ocean that was rampantly charging toward Jian Wushuang was like a tidal wave. Even Jian Wushuang could not help but exclaim in surprise.

“It’s just the impact of the Sword Essence Ocean?” Jian Wushuang frowned. “No, it shouldn’t be so simple.”

Although the sword essence impact in front of him was terrifying and would affect his strength to a great extent, judging from the power of the sword essence ocean, this sword was not so simple.

And it was true.

“Jian Wushuang, take my sword.”

“Emperor Sword!”

Di Shisan glanced at Jian Wushuang and slashed out with the divine sword in his hand. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It seemed to be an ordinary sword, but the moment it was slashed out, a dazzling sword light swept out.

The sword light was so dazzling that it could cause damage to the eyes of ordinary cultivators. The dazzling light instantly made it the focus of the world.

It was as if this sword was the only thing left in everyone’s eyes.

“An absolute art at the Ruler Realm?” Jian Wushuang’s expression was calm.

He saw that this sword was extraordinary, but he was not afraid. His body swayed, and a violent force was released instantly.

“Peerless Sword Manual, Xi Xiang!”

The cold sword light suddenly slashed down with endless violent intent.

In the blink of an eye, it collided with the dazzling sword light.

Both were ultimate skills at the Ruler Realm, and the power they used was exactly the same. Even their comprehension of the universe origin of sword principle was almost the same.

The two sword lights disappeared almost at the same time.

“Di Shisan, is your swordsmanship only at this level?” Jian Wushuang looked at Di Shisan.

Di Shisan merely glanced at Jian Wushuang and did not say anything. However, he struck out with his divine sword again.
