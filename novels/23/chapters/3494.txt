“Scum of the Fantasy Alliance, die!”

Life Fall King’s voice was cold and murderous as he pointed out with a finger.

This finger carried a strange power. The moment he pointed out, the void in front of him shattered.

A huge and dark vortex appeared out of thin air. This vortex was vast and boundless, like a prehistoric giant beast that was crazily devouring everything around it.

Following that, from within the Vortex, a huge dark finger that seemed to extend from boundless hell charged toward the Underworld Emperor with destructive power.

The Underworld Emperor stood there and looked at the huge dark finger that extended in front of him. His expression changed greatly in fear.

“This power...the pinnacle of the six states of the void, it is at least at the pinnacle of the six states of the void. It is even stronger than the blade light of Elder Dark Bone!”

“How is this possible?”

“How can there be an existence stronger than Elder Dark Bone among the experts present today?”

Pluto growled. He frantically tried to use his illusory heaven technique, but it was useless. He wanted to dodge the giant finger, but he was horrified to find that the giant dark finger had completely locked him down, preventing him from moving at all.

He could only watch as the giant finger of darkness continued to enlarge in front of him. In the end, the giant finger of darkness was not affected at all and directly struck Pluto.

Bang!

A low rumble sounded, and the void shook.

After the giant finger of darkness displayed its full power, it slowly dissipated in the world.

At this moment, Pluto’s body had already been pushed to the ground by the giant finger. Even the ground had a huge hole. Pluto was at the bottom of the hole. He struggled to stand up slowly, however, his expression was no longer as relaxed as before. There was a miserable and pathetic look on his face.

The black robe on his body was formed from a protective treasure. However, it was in tatters now. There was still blood on his body and the corner of his mouth.

Especially the aura on his body. Compared to before, it was weakened by more than 40%!

“Too powerful. One attack has consumed more than 40% of my divine power. If I use this attack twice more, I will definitely die!” Pluto raised his head and looked at Life Fall King with fear.

Life Fall King frowned, he murmured, “The restriction of this world is too great for me. I can’t even use 10% of my strength. I can’t even kill an ant at the peak of the sixth void realm with one attack.”

Life Fall King was not satisfied with the result of his attack.

However, the surrounding people, such as Jian Wushuang and the others, had long been amazed.

“As expected of a ruler-level expert. Even an outsider, whose strength is limited by the power of the will of heaven, can not exert more than 10% of his strength. However, even with less than 10% of his strength, he can still easily crush Pluto and cause him to lose more than 40% of his divine power in one attack. I’m afraid that even Elder Dark Bone can not match his strength.” Jian Wushuang sighed in his heart.

Previously, Life Fall King said that he was too restricted and that the strength he could display in the Divine Beginning Realm was not that great, so he could not count on him for this move.

But now, it seemed that Life Fall King was too modest.

Or it could be said that previously, Life Fall King did not have anything to do with him, so he did not want to personally make a move, so he deliberately said this. But now, because it involved the Fantasy Alliance, he had to personally make a move. The strength he displayed...immediately frightened everyone.

“Life Fall King, your opponent is just a little guy at the peak of the sixth level of the void. Don’t lose face in front of so many people.” Elder Dark Bone laughed weirdly.

“Humph, do I still need you to say it?” Life Fall King’s eyes turned cold, and a suffocating pressure suddenly erupted from his body.

“Die!”

Life Fall King pointed his finger out again.

This finger crushed the time and space in the world. In an instant, a Dark Demon God that was over 30,000 feet tall appeared in the void.

This Dark Demon God had three eyes. The third eye shot out a strange purple beam of light. With a violent swing of its huge arm, a huge fist that was like a huge, boundless dark star appeared, it carried an incomparable impact force and attacked Pluto ferociously.

This dark star was even more powerful than the dark finger that Life Fall King had just used.

Clearly, Life Fall King was serious. He had pushed the power that he could use in the Divine Beginning Realm to the extreme.

The dark star formed by this punch made Pluto’s expression change drastically.

One had to know that Life Fall King’s finger had used up more than 40% of his divine power. And now, this even stronger punch was likely enough to destroy all of his remaining divine power.

“Save me!”

“Master, save me!”

Pluto knew that he could not block that punch. He would most likely die in that punch. Thus, he did not have the slightest intention to block it. Instead, he directly crushed a dark green token in his hand, moreover, he let out a series of explosive roars.

The moment that command talisman shattered, a majestic aura instantly rose up and filled the void.

When that Dark Demon God’s fist smashed over, circles of dark air currents also blocked it.

When that Dark Demon God’s fist smashed against the dark air currents, it was as though it had smashed into cotton. It did not cause too much of a commotion, but its power was completely neutralized.

“Oh?” Life Fall King frowned and raised his head to look ahead.

“Haha, Life Fall King, with your status and strength, you actually attacked one of my subordinates. Isn’t that a little too much?” Within the Dark Qi flow, a hearty laughter rang out, following that, a hazy figure slowly appeared in front of everyone.

This hazy figure was quite tall, and the aura it emitted was extremely unique. As for its appearance, no one could see it clearly.

However, even if no one could see his face clearly, they could still guess his identity.

“Sorcerer God!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold.

The Sorcerer God’s Sect had always stood together with the three Saint Realms.

Back on the Saha Island, the Sorcerer God had appeared and killed him together with the three masters of the Saint Realm, but he had been repelled by him.

Now, Jian Wushuang saw the Sorcerer God again. However, judging from his appearance, the Sorcerer God should be just a consciousness avatar, not the real body.

“Sorcerer God, are you going to stop me?” Life Fall King stared at the Sorcerer God coldly.

“No matter what, Yama is my subordinate. If you want to kill him, I can’t pretend that I didn’t see it,” the Sorcerer God said with a faint smile.

“So, you want to make an enemy of me and the Cang Heaven World?” Life Fall King said coldly.
