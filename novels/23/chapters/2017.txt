2018 Escaped

“Emperor Bai was perfectly fine,” Leng Ruxue said.

“How could it be?” The savage man looked in disbelief.

Lord Fen from Holocaust Sect was also from ancient times. In terms of power, they were compatible.

But Lord Fen was severely injured by Emperor Bai and he had to recover in seclusion for so many years. Emperor Bai’s power…

“Before Lord Fen went into seclusion, he once said that Emperor Bai was unrivaled in this era where the universe was restrained greatly. Unless there was any superb existence in the top ten from the ancient war back then who woke up, they might stand a chance to beat Emperor Bai,” Leng Ruxue said.

The savage man’s eyes dilated in shock when he heard that.

The top ten superb existence from the ancient war?

He himself would have to look up to such existence.

For instance, Emperor Thirteen who appeared before… He didn’t even have the courage to compete against him back in ancient times. Due to the restriction in the second era, he wasn’t as fearful of Emperor Thirteen as before.

“The reason why Emperor Bai is powerful is because he is an inverse cultivator. Sword Emperor is an inverse cultivator as well. He is naturally extraordinary,” Leng Ruxue said.

“Humph, no matter how impressive Sword Emperor is, we definitely can’t let him leave alive as he barged into Three-Emperor World. Although it’s a pity that we didn’t kill him this time, it’s okay. In no time, they’ll reappear again soon. By then, we will have another chance to kill them again,” the blood man said coldly.

The savage man nodded heavily.

Leng Ruxue seemed to be quiet and she didn’t comment much but her eyes were glistening.

“Jian Wushuang…” Leng Ruxue chanted his name in her heart.

In a spacious void in Three-Emperor World.

Vroom!

The void was distorted and a spacetime tunnel appeared out of nowhere. Then, there were four figures that leapt out of the spacetime tunnel.

The four figures were naturally Jian Wushuang and the other three Great Emperors.

The four of them finally let out a breath of relief when they arrived in the void.

“Jian Wushuang!”

Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zhi Luo and Emperor Jiu Qiao looked at Jian Wushuang simultaneously.

There was astonishment, admiration and gratitude across their eyes. Even Abysmal Saint Master, who harbored deep-seated resentment against Jian Wushuang, looked at him as such too.

They knew clearly that it was uncertain if they could flee if it wasn’t because of Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, are you really okay?” Great Emperor Zhi Luo couldn’t help but ask.

One should know that Jian Wushuang had been hemmed in by six Great Emperors for eight breaths’ time!

They would have been killed long ago if they were to fight for such a long period, but Jian Wushuang…

“Don’t worry. I’m okay,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He was telling the truth. His divine body was fine but he used up some divine power.

The six Great Emperors’ attacks were extremely ferocious, especially the beast-like bald man. The power of his axe was powerful. When it hit Jian Wushuang, his divine body was severely injured, even after the Five Gem weakened it tremendously.

However, with the perfect Chaotic divine body, he could instantly recover his divine body. Hence, he looked perfectly fine all the time.

But in actual fact, the earlier pitch battle wasn’t easy for him either. Because he had spent almost thirty percent of his divine power, which equalled the amount of divine power for him to reorganize his divine body. Fortunately, the besiegement only lasted for eight breaths of time. If it were to have been dragged on longer…

His divine power would be completely used up in at most twenty breaths’ time. Without divine power, his divine body couldn’t be recovered in an instant.

“My defensive power is a little weak. Although I already have Five Gem Armor, I didn’t have any defensive secret skills. The Immemorial Celestial Body…” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were glowing.

Immemorial Celestial Body was the strongest defense secret skill of the ancient tribe.

Once he cultivated the first volume successfully, my divine body would improve tremendously. By then, the damage that he would have when he underwent a similar besiegement would be much smaller. In other words, the divine power spent would naturally be less and the rate of survival would increase!

It was a pity that he was slightly behind for the secret skill.

“Jian Wushuang!”

There was a low voice. The one who spoke was Abysmal Saint Master.

Jian Wushuang looked at Abysmal Saint Master and he could see Abysmal Saint Master’s expression looked rather complicated.

He shared great resentment with Abysmal Saint Master. But then, it could be said that Jian Wushuang had saved Abysmal Saint Master.

“I, Abysmal, have never owed anyone any favor. Today, you did a favor for me. From today, no matter what happens in Eternal Chaotic World in the future, I will never make trouble with you,” Abysmal Saint Master claimed.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and then he nodded faintly.

He had never really liked Abysmal Saint Master and they had been feuding. However, the grudges they had held against one another weren’t serious. After all, Abysmal Saint Master had never really hurt him.

Then, they were assigned to be in the same troop. It could be said that their lives were tied on the same string. Hence, they naturally had to lend a helping hand to one another.

“We just went through a ferocious battle. Let’s find a place to rest up first,” Jian Wushuang said.

The other three Great Emperors nodded.

During the earlier battle, Abysmal Saint Master and Great Emperor had been fine but Emperor Jiu Qiao was severely injured.

Then, the four of them had immediately found a place to rest up.

Emperor Jiu Qiao shared what had happened with Emperor Bai and the other higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance via his doppelg?nger.

When the Great Emperors heard that the four of them had been attacked by six Great Emperors, they were terrified. They only relaxed when they found out that they had fled successfully.

At the same time, they were astonished at the ability that Jian Wushuang had displayed.

He hadn’t died even though he had been hemmed in by six Great Emperors. Besides Emperor Bai, there was no one else among the Great Emperors from Sanctuary Alliance who were capable of doing the same.

Then, they had finally understood why Emperor Bai would pick Jian Wushuang to join the expert troop. It was not only because he was in a lower realm and easier to carry out tasks, but it was also because his unique ability to take attacks and being unkillable were extremely useful to the expert troop.

For instance, it was because of Jian Wushuang’s capability that the expert troop had headed off a disaster.

“Jiu Qiao, tell Abysmal Saint Master and Jian Wushuang to take the time to visit Imperial Cabinet after you recover. The Imperial Cabinet should be where the deepest secret of the dark millstone is. It is highly likely that it is where the ways to control the dark millstone and the surrounding great formation are stored.”

“Yes,” Emperor Jiu Qiao nodded solemnly.
