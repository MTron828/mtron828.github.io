2059 Irrefutable Evidence

Vientiane Tower was too great of a power in Eternal Chaotic World and they were greatly involved.

Although they didn’t scramble for supremacy, every single one of their movements was enough to affect the entire Eternal Chaotic World.

Just like back when Wu Bei’s cave came into creation, all forces and geniuses fought over it. It was Vientiane Tower’s work.

For example, news about the Star Palace Master’s death spread from Vientiane Tower too. Hence, it had stirred up the three alliances that rushed to Lineage of Star.

There were many fights and massacres that seemed to be instigated by Vientiane Tower.

On the surface, Vientiane Tower looked like they did it for their own benefit. Then, it seemed like Vientiane Tower purposely sowed discord among the people and the experts in Eternal Chaotic World killed each other. It had indirectly diminished the overall power of Eternal Chaotic World.

“Let me ask you, the mysterious expert that I met back when I returned from Emperor Sword Sect, was he sent by Zi Xu?” Jian Wushuang asked in a low voice.

“Yes,” the beautiful lady in purple robe nodded. Then, her figure turned illusory and her appearance and temperament immediately changed.

The beautiful lady in the purple robe suddenly turned into a brawny elder in black with tan skin.

Jian Wushuang recognized at first glance that the scrawny elder was the boatman in black who had wanted to kill him back then.

“As expected,” Jian Wushuang’s gaze turned cold.

“Temperament and appearance can be changed. This secret skill is extraordinary,” Emperor Bai stared at the boatman in black in front of him. Then he waved and the boatman in black vanished into thin air without a chance to struggle.

Then, Emperor Bai looked at Ancestor Tian Chen, “There is irrefutable evidence. Let’s take action. Not only Zi Xu, but also Vientiane Tower. They must be uprooted!”

“Mister Emperor Bai, don’t worry. Although Vientiane Tower has been careful in their actions, Sanctuary Alliance found out where their old lair is long ago. We should either stay put or we’ll destroy it the moment we attack,” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

“That’s great. Immediately gather all Great Emperors for discussion. On top of that, keep watch of Zi Xu!”

Emperor Bai commanded and the four of them left.

…

Sanctuary Alliance was in Presbytery Pavilion where they usually held the highest meeting on Thunderbolt Island.

Many Great Emperors arrived either personally or in their consciousness embodiments.

Including Jian Wushuang, Sanctuary Alliance had fourteen Great Emperors then and there were thirteen of them there. The only one who never came was naturally Great Emperor Zi Xu.

The Great Emperors were confused as to why Emperor Bai would gather everyone to discuss.

Could it be that Three-Emperors World was planning anything major again?

“Everyone is here. Let’s begin,” Emperor Bai beckoned to Ancestor Tian Chen.

Ancestor Tian Chen stood up and looked around. Then, he spoke in a bright and clear voice, “Everyone, I believe that many of you noticed something fishy during the mission to Three-Emperors World. That’s right, there is a double agent amongst the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance!”

The Great Emperors’ eyes dilated in shock when they heard that.

But most of them weren’t surprised.

Previously, when the four-members experts’ troops were in Three-Emperors World, there had been too many coincidences. On top of that, there was the incident at Bronze Heart Region.

There was no doubt that there was a spy amongst the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance. Everyone knew it but no one spoke about it.

Ancestor Tian Chen paused and said, “After I investigated with Mister Emperor Bai for the past twenty years, we are sure of the spy’s identity. Everyone, please take a look…”

Ancestor Tian Chen immediately took out all the evidence that he gathered, including the mirror image of when they had questioned the beautiful lady in purple at the estate, so that everyone could go through them.

The Great Emperors looked through them and his face grew grave.

“Zi Xu, Great Emperor Zi Xu was the spy?”

“It’s him?”

“Great Emperor Zi Xu is so laid back and he doesn’t concern himself about worldly affairs. Who would have expected him to be Acheron Palace’s spy and to have removed so many top geniuses in Eternal Chaotic World?!?!”

The Great Emperors were angry.

Although some of them were friends with Great Emperor Zi Xu, their friendship vanished when they found out Great Emperor Zi Xu’s identity. It was replaced with billowing hatred.

“D*mn. My disciple, he was the one who killed him?” There was an angry roar that reverberated in Presbytery Pavilion.

Everyone looked at East Royal Emperor, who was raging with anger, but everyone was very understanding.

The top genius back then, Lord Hatred, had been East Royal Disciple’s lineal disciple and he was his proudest disciple. However, he had died in the end. East Royal Disciple was in extreme grief. Now, having found out the true murderer of his disciple, he was of course furious.

“Besides Zi Xu, there is Vientiane Tower!”

“They are the enemy’s spies! There is irrefutable evidence!!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Emperor Bai’s gaze was cold as it swept over them. “I gathered everyone here so that everyone can take action together and uproot Vientiane Tower in the shortest time together!!”

The Great Emperors looked solemn and raging with murderous intention.

“Tian Chen, go ahead and make arrangements. Destroy every single branch of Vientiane Tower within Eternal Chaotic World,” Emperor Bai commanded.

“Yes,” Ancestor Tian Chen nodded heavily.

“Jian Wushuang, Red Dragon, Abysmal, East Royal…” Emperor Bai called out the Great Emperors’ names and said, “The few of you follow me to take a trip to the old lair of Vientiane Tower!”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang and the other few Great Emperors accepted his command.

All Great Emperors quickly took action.

The huge robot in Sanctuary Alliance started running. In the ten cultivation sanctuaries, the sanctuary masters commanded and the sanctuaries started attacking the Vientiane Tower branch.

On the other hand, Emperor Bai and the other few Great Emperors rushed to Vientiane Tower’s old lair.

Vientiane Tower’s old lair was not located within the ten cultivation sanctuaries but in a remote, dark void that was further away from the ten cultivation sanctuaries.

When they arrived in the dark void, the Vientiane Tower’s old lair was operating as usual.

Then, Emperor Bai found irrefutable evidence and decided to take action against Vientiane Tower. He rushed to Vientiane Tower at the first moment, and even Vientiane Tower with the greatest intelligence agency couldn’t respond in time. Plus, they had yet to find out that Sanctuary Alliance had already prepared to take action against them.

“Vientiane Tower, as the number one chamber of commerce in Eternal Chaotic World, possesses an extraordinary foundation. In terms of Almighties, they have more than thirty of them. In Vientiane Tower, there is also a Great Emperor,” Emperor Bai’s face looked cold.

In Eternal Chaotic World, not including Jian Wushuang, there were fifteen Great Emperors. Thirteen of them were in Sanctuary Alliance while the other two weren’t.

But in the dark, there were many hidden experts. However, the experts hardly showed up. Hence, they were unknown.

The hidden experts in Vientiane Tower should be quite numerous.
