4662 Suppressing the Ancient Era, Ascending to Become Cosmos God (1)

Lu Ding was startled. At this moment, he almost gave up all his thoughts and stretched out his arm to block the clay idol.

Swish…

The sound of the blade cutting into flesh rang out. Under the Tarot Divine Sword’s blade, which could even cut off the Laws of the Great Dao, Lu Ding’s entire arm was cut off from the root. Divine blood with Ancestor realm aura scattered in the void.

Groaning in pain, Lu Ding summoned the giant Qilin and forced Jian Wushuang to retreat.

His body trembled, and his severed left arm grew out again. Lu Ding looked at him with eyes full of hatred.

“Fine, fine. Since you want to die so badly, I’ll send you to reincarnation realm today!”

In the next moment, the sky-covering Qilin transformed into flowing fire stars and scattered.

Lu Ding stood where he was, absorbing the divine light of the Qilin form. At the same time, the countless fire stars were like a curtain of rain, enveloping him within.

Every tiny stream of fire turned into a scale, adorning Lu Ding’s body.

Melting stones into armor, turning flames into robes.

With the Great Dao supporting his body, he was like the first Qilin King Ancestor, shaking the world.

With a raise of his hand, the power of yang burned deep marks in the void.

Lu Ding’s body was wrapped in flowing flames. He condensed a ball of fire that was like the sun in his hand and smashed it at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes focused, and he was not afraid at all. With the Tarot Divine Sword in his hand, he stepped forward to meet the attack.

A light green invisible barrier surged around Jian Wushuang. The two of them collided and a brilliant and terrifying divine power fire burst out!

It was as if a vast rain of fire had descended. All the Supremes of the Divine Life Palace unleashed their divine abilities to protect the 150,000 Supremes realm experts who had been weakened to a certain extent.

“Thank you, Divine Life Palace, for your timely assistance. Otherwise, I’m afraid we would have all died here today,” Feng Qi said with lingering fear as she looked at Supreme Xue Bo and the others.

Supreme Xue Bo nodded and smiled. “You should thank Palace Master Wushuang. If he hadn’t decided to set off immediately, I’m afraid we would have needed dozens of days to hear the news.”

Feng Qi’s face blushed. She did not know if it was because of her injuries or some other reason. Then, she said in a low voice that only she could hear, “I naturally have to thank him alone.”

Above the shattered Void, three Ancestor realm experts were fighting, and even the distant starry sky was torn apart.

Jian Wushuang was not at a disadvantage at all even though he was fighting against two people. Every time he struck, he could create a deep gully on Lu Ding’s flame melting armor.

As for the clay idol that looked exactly like Lu Ding, its body was like a ghost. Every time it attacked, it would bring with it countless sorrowful wails, which sounded extremely strange and terrifying.

The Transcendence Heavenly Gate floated in the void, and its brilliant divine power illuminated the world.

This was the first time Jian Wushuang had performed an Ancestral Skill since he became an Ancestor realm expert. A giant finger that reached the sky came down.

The attack that was far beyond what he had comprehended earlier caused Lu Ding’s eyes to narrow. He retreated quickly almost subconsciously.

However, the clay idol did not react at all. Instead, it raised its palm and prepared to meet the blow.

“Don’t!”

Lu Ding, who was retreating rapidly, rushed back almost madly when he saw this. He did not care that the heavenly finger had already descended, and he immediately pushed the clay idol out.

Boom boom boom!

With one finger, even the void was easily destroyed. Lu Ding, who had transformed into a giant Qilin, roared angrily. His two arms wrapped around the tip of his finger and engaged in a crazy contest of strength.

All the cultivators were watching the shocking battle between the Ancestor realm experts.

Above the broken void, it was as if thousands of suns had risen, and extremely bright light swallowed and covered everything.

Under the radiance of light, even Half Ancestors could not look at it directly.

Time seemed to have stopped, and only the light was eternal.

In the bright sun, the Tarot Divine Sword slowly returned to its sheath. Jian Wushuang stood in the same place, his face calm, as if everything that happened next was within his expectations.

The extreme light produced by the explosion dissipated, and the void shattered even more.

In the center of the most broken area, a miserable figure knelt down.

The power of yang in his body dissipated, and that huge figure that was like a demonic god had already returned to its original state.

The fire melting armor was also completely shattered. In the process of blocking, the Ancestor realm divine body also injured its origin.

Divine blood gushed out from every pore of Lu Ding’s body, making him look like a blood man.

Jian Wushuang walked slowly to him, not worried that he would attack.

He coughed out a large mouthful of divine blood and stared at Jian Wushuang with undying unwillingness in his eyes. “I really didn’t expect that you would grow to such a terrifying level in less than three hundred years. Even if I shed my body, I can’t compare to you?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were as calm as water. He suppressed his anger and said, “You have already advanced to the Ancestor realm and are Cosmos God of the entire Divine Power Universe. Why did you kill nearly ten million cultivators so cruelly?”

“Those guys?” Lu Ding chuckled. “They’re just a bunch of ants. It’s a kind of sublimation for them to integrate into my body.”

“Jian Wushuang, your growth is far beyond my imagination. As long as you let me go, I will tell you a big secret. Are you only willing to waste your time guarding this place?” Lu Ding struggled to get up, his eyes full of the desire to live.

Jian Wushuang did not speak anymore. Instead, he stretched out a finger and pointed at him.

In an instant, the rules of the Great Dao were shattered, and the divine power was forcibly extracted from Lu Ding’s body. The Ancestor realm fate energy was completely returned to the universe.

The Ancestor realm origin that contained countless Great Dao comprehensions was also removed by Jian Wushuang.

Lu Ding stood up shakily, and his crazed eyes became clear, which was a rare sight.

“Jian Wushuang, if you want to find the ethereal realm one day, you will definitely repeat my mistake.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“When the time comes, I’ll be looking forward to seeing your decision.”

After saying this, Lu Ding’s divine body shattered and turned into countless ancient stars, scattering all over the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

Lu Ding, who had become the Cosmos God of the Divine Power Universe 300 years ago, and killed tens of millions of cultivators in the Divine Power Universe, had been destroyed by Jian Wushuang.

What Lu Ding had done was even worse than what the Void Universe had done.

The Last Flames of the universe, over ten million of them were all killed by Lu Ding.

The Divine Power Universe was on the verge of collapse.

Even if he had killed Lu Ding, it would not be enough to offset the consequences of his actions.

Jian Wushuang found it hard to understand how the easy-going and generous Lu Ding had become like this.

At that moment, Lu Ding’s clay idol, who had also been seriously injured by the finger, stood up slowly. After taking a deep look at Jian Wushuang, it turned into a black light and scattered among the stars.

As it was too fast, it had completely disappeared before anyone could react.
