Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“My divine body, divine power, soul power, recovery ability, immortal body, and even comprehension ability have reached their most perfect states. Besides, I have full control over my life rating pressure now...”

Perfect Chaotic Creature. The peerless Perfect Chaotic Creature in Heaven and Earth!”

Jian Wushuang clasped his hands tightly with eyes gleaming with intense excitement.

Only when he truly became a Perfect Chaotic Creature had he realized what a freak he was!

“Jian Wushuang!”

A low roar sounded abruptly from the void ahead which actually came from Crimson Stone Saint who was still in a kneeling position. Rage and humiliation could be seen swirling in his eyes while his stare locked onto Jian Wushuang.

“Oh, I’ve almost forgotten about him.”

Jian Wushuang uncontrollably smiled and lifted the life rating pressure off Crimson Stone Saint with the powers of his mind. Crimson Stone Saint then exhaled heavily and slowly pulled himself up.

“The life rating pressure directly suppresses a cultivator without differentiating their realm or strength. Even an Undying Saint was unable to resist and was forced to surrender. This can be my ace in the hole,” muttered Jian Wushuang.

The life rating pressure was indeed a killer move.

Jian Wushuang would keep it hidden and only reveal it under critical moments.

After all, it would be too ostentatious if he easily displayed this power as it would raise suspicions and expose those secrets that he would like to keep about himself. Especially when people noticed a mere Divine Demon like him could exert such intensive pressures which even an Undying Saint could not parry off.

“Jian Wushuang, who the hell are you! Where are you from?” Crimson Stone Saint screamed in frustration.

He began to address Jian Wushuang differently.

Previously, he called Jian Wushuang ‘young man’ as a friendly gesture towards a junior.

After he saw Jian Wushuang in a different light, he naturally changed the way he addressed Jian Wushuang. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“It doesn’t matter who I am or where I am from. What’s important is that I’ve told you before you aren’t qualified to take me as your personal disciple even at your peak. You should understand why I dare say that now. “Jian Wushuang stood up tall with his extremely calm expression.

Crimson Stone Saint fell silent.

He wanted to take Jian Wushuang as his personal disciple before but had abandoned such ideas now.

Jian Wushuang had instilled fear and awe in him. How could an ordinary Undying Saint like him take Jian Wushuang as his disciple?

“Crimson Stone Saint.”

Jian Wushuang looked at him in the eye. “You’ve set me up to fight against those various sects’ genius disciples and landed me in hot soup after provoking so many sects. I should’ve hated you very much. You also ought to know that if I wanted to, I could easily destroy your tomb as well as your consciousness.”

His words sent shivers up Crimson Stone Saint’s spine.

He admitted there was some truth in Jian Wushuang’s words. He had lost control of his limbs under the life rating pressure exerted by Jian Wushuang. If Jian Wushuang had intended to kill him at that time, there was nothing he could do to save himself.

“Having said that, I’ve also benefited a lot from the opportunities in Saint’s Tomb. I made a breakthrough in my sword principles understanding of the eighth trial bridge. I was given the Purple Blood Saint’s inheritance. The enlightenment through Fengtian Scroll and spending time in Divine Power Ocean had also tremendously helped me. Therefore, I’ll call it even and will no longer blame you for what had happened.”

Jian Wushuang paused momentarily before continuing, “Let’s talk about your personal affairs now. As an Undying Saint, you came forward and forced me to become your personal disciple. You must have some special intentions. Otherwise, you would not have disregarded your identity or pride.”

“Go on, tell me what’s going on.”

Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently while maintaining eye contact with Crimson Stone Saint as though he could read Crimson Stone Saint like a book.

“Jian Wushuang...” Crimson Stone Saint was startled. ‘Not only is he very talented with a strong background, but he’s also a man of sound judgment. Hence, he found out I’ve intentions behind my moves.”

Crimson Stone Saint was amazed and finally came clean after taking a deep breath. “Jian Wushuang, you guessed it. I do have a motive behind wanting you as my disciple.”

In fact, my intentions are very simple. I see that you are extremely talented and have great potential in making a breakthrough and become an Ultimate God or even Realm Lord in the future, so I wanted you to do something for me in the future.”

“What thing?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Go and help someone called Yin Su’er. She’s my daughter,” said Crimson Stone Saint.

“Your daughter?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Jian Wushuang did not expect Crimson Stone Saint, who had been dead for more than a hundred thousand years, to have a daughter that was still alive.

“Back then, I was one of the experts among the peak experts of the nine realms of Golden Crow. I was one of the nine realm masters of the Golden Crow, controlling 381 stellar regions and created the Crimson Stone Fort. There were around ten thousand Ultimate Gods, millions of Divine Demons, and countless experts under me, but I was unfortunately killed in a conspiracy.”

My daughter, Su’er was also very talented and reached Peak Ultimate God Realm before my death. I’ve also made her my successor as the Fort Master before my death to rule the realm. However, apart from a few loyal followers, most of the Ultimate Gods and Divine Demons began acting recklessly without my command and the Crimson Stone Fort soon became a huge mess.”

We are relying solely on Su’er alone to handle both internal and external conflicts. Not long ago, Su’er visited me in this tomb and I’ve learned of her tough situation so I want to get someone capable and reliable to assist her!”

Crimson Stone Saint looked disheartened at this point in time.

“I was initially looking for a suitable successor so that I can hand over my complete inheritance to that successor. With that, I hope my successor can go forward and help my daughter. To my disappointment, I found none over the years until the day I saw you.”

You are extremely talented with huge future potentials. If you can sincerely help Su’er, it’s likely for her to tide over those difficulties.”

“Unfortunately, you are good with the sword and are unable to inherit my mantle. Moreover, you may not be willing to be my disciple, so I had no choice but to set you up.”
