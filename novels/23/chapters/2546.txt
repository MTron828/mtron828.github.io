Chapter 2547: Daylight Robbery

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Mr. Jian Yi is a well-known Blood Gladiator. The Ye Clan would’ve of course heard of you. May I ask how my son offended you?”

“He turns out to be your son I see. He ordered his servants to maim my apprentice’s limbs and abolish his cultivation base in the tavern. That isn’t all, Ye Ming even threatened to do the same to me when my apprentice mentioned me as his master. Well, well, I’m interested in finding out how the Ye Clan is going to make that happen.” Jian Wushuang pulled a stern face with sparks of anger radiating from his eyes.

His words shocked everyone.

‘Abolish his cultivation base?’

‘Abolish the cultivation base of Blood Gladiator Jian Yi?’

‘Did Ye Ming say that?’

“Bastard!!!”

“What ignorance!”

The purple-haired old man was fuming and gave his son, Ye Ming an unforgivable glare.

He did not expect Ye Ming to mess with Jian Yi.

Jian Yi was a Blood Gladiator!

He must be a genius for Jian Yi to be a Blood Gladiator. There were also rumors of him defeating a super genius from Dragon Phoenix Pavilion in the final round challenge and demonstrated great talent. Most people would love to recruit such a genius and be in his good books.

The purple-haired old man was shocked that his very own son had provoked Jian Yi and even threatened to abolish his cultivation base. That was outrageous!

It was fortunate that Jian Yi merely demanded an explanation and did not attack Ye Ming.

Were it any other man, he would have attacked Ye Ming without further ado.

After taking a deep breath to calm his nerves, the purple-haired old man looked into Jian Wushuang’s eyes. “Your Excellency, it’s indeed my son’s fault. I regret to say that I’ve failed as a Father. I’m the Ye Clan’s Second Elder and also Ye Ming’s father. I sincerely would like to apologize and thank you for your mercy.”

The purple-haired old man was subservient to Jian Wushuang.

He desperately wanted to appease Jian Wushuang.

“Humph, do you think an apology could make up for your son’s mistakes?” Jian Wushuang snorted.

“How would you like to settle it?” The purple-haired old man frowned.

“It’s simple. We can settle with one hundred thousand Primordial Stones and I’ll put the matter at rest.” Jian Wushuang cut to the chase.

“A hundred thousand Primordial Stones?” All of the Ye Clan members present were taken aback and angered.

The Ye Clan was a mid-tier clan in the Northern Darkstar Continent and was rather wealthy but 100,000 Primordial Stones were still a large sum.

Jian Wushaung demanded the Ye Clan to pay an exorbitant price for a mistake which was no different from daylight robbery!

“You’re asking for a lot.” The purple-haired old man’s gaze turned cold.

“Am I? It’s just one hundred thousand Primordial Stones. Fortunately, my disciple is fine. Otherwise, I don’t think that will be enough. You’re Ye Clan’s Second Elder, right? I suggest you weigh the consequences of your decisions. Would you rather hand over a hundred thousand Primordial Stones or battle with me?” Jian Wushuang gave a sardonic laugh with his confidently puffed-up chest.

On the other hand, the purple-haired old man looked gloomy.

The Ye Clan’s Elders then leaned in for an ad-hoc discussion.

“What should we do?”

“One hundred thousand Primordial Stones are just too much. We can’t afford to give him.”

“Yes, he’s just looting us.”

The Elders were furious.

The purple-haired old man waved his hand. “Jian Yi is no pushover. He’s showing a much stronger strength than an average High-Level Ultimate God’s two months ago when he challenged the Blood Gladiators. After he was declared as a new Blood Gladiator, he took away one hundred sixty thousand Primordial Stones from the Shi Clan’s arena. I heard the Shi Clan wasn’t about to let the matter slip so they sent their Third Elder and four High-Level Ultimate Gods to hunt him down but failed to capture him on top of being unable to retrieve those Primordial Stones.”

“There’s also news that not long ago Jian Yi wiped out three of the eighteen prefectures in the Dark Thunder Territory. The Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor was forced to personally take matters into his hand and launched an attack. However, Jian Yi left unscathed. It’s obvious he’s very difficult to deal with so if he made another breakthrough and reached the High-Level Ultimate God realm, his strength will naturally become even stronger.”

“It’s to our disadvantage when battling against an extremely powerful person like him.”

An elder scowled, “So what should we do? Are we giving in to his demand of a hundred thousand Primordial Stones?”

“Don’t worry. I’ve reported this matter to the Clan Leader and let him come forth to solve this issue. I’m sure he’s the only person who can subdue Jian Yi,” said the purple-haired old man.

Everyone else nodded in unison.

The Ye Clan Leader was the Ye Clan’s top-tier Peak Ultimate God expert.

He had chosen to lie low quite some time ago but would step up and help the Ye Clan out of tight spots.

“Have you decided?”

Although Jian Wushuang stood alone in front of the Ye Clan Mansion, he remained calm while facing many of Ye Clan’s experts.

All of a sudden...

“Who’s here to cause a scene in front of my Ye Clan’s Mansion,” an angry shout thunderously resounded from the void above.

An extremely powerful aura emerged shortly after from the deepest part of the Ye Clan’s Mansion. His breath of divine power was much stronger than the many High-Level Ultimate Gods present.

A figure slowly came out from the Ye Clan’s Mansion and positioned himself before Jian Wushuang.

It was an old man with white hair and a goatee. Although the old man looked weak and infirm, his eyes were dazzling bright like flashes of light.

Everyone was in awe.

“It’s the Clan Leader!”

“You’re finally out!”

The Ye Clan members were overjoyed when they saw his arrival.

The old man with a goatee was the Leader of Ye Clan and the clan’s only Peak Ultimate God, Ye Dingshan.

“A pleasure to meet you. Let me reintroduce myself. I’m Jian Yi, a recently appointed Blood Gladiator,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“Blood Gladiator?” Ye Dingshan frowned and continued in a loud voice, “So what if you’re a Blood Gladiator. You have no position to chuck a tantrum here. Leave! Otherwise, I’ll no longer be courteous.”

“Haha, I’m curious what will happen if you’re no longer courteous.” Jian Wushuang coldly grinned.
