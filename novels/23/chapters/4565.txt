“How did this happen?”

Thank you readers!

Cosmos God gasped in disbelief.

Just now, when he was about to use his divine power, he found that the terrifying divine power in his body that could make the universe explode and restart chaos had become extremely slow.

It was as if countless vengeful spirits were tearing at his divine body, which caused his strength to drop by at least half.

“Void God!”

!!

Cosmos God took a deep breath and looked at Void God. His expression turned grave for the first time.

Although he did not know why his body would have such a change, he was sure that it was Void God’s doing.

This battle was most likely dangerous.

“Cosmos God, don’t look at me like that. I hate using such methods to deal with you.”

Void God shrugged and said with a faint smile, “You only have yourself to blame for all of this. Even the people closest to you can’t stand what you’re doing and can see the trend.”

Upon hearing this, Cosmos God’s expression did not change. However, his heart sank.

Then, as if he had thought of something, he turned around and slowly said, “It’s you?”

Lan Su and Lan Lan were standing side by side in the void behind Cosmos God.

Among them, the gaze of Cosmos God landed on Lan Su.

“Master…” Seeing the gaze of Cosmos God, Lan Su subconsciously felt fear in his heart and took a step back.

“I… I didn’t.”

Lan Su did not dare to meet the gaze of Cosmos God and said in a flustered manner.

“Master, what’s wrong?” Lan Lan was stunned and asked in confusion.

Cosmos God did not reply to Lan Lan. Instead, he took in a deep breath and looked straight into Lan Su’s eyes, which were constantly avoiding eye contact. He said in a low voice, “Little Su, you have had a habit since you were young. When you lie, your eyes will look everywhere.”

“So, please don’t lie to Master.”

“Come, tell me. Were you bewitched by Void God and betrayed the Divine Power Universe? Tell me and take responsibility. I won’t blame you.”

Before Lan Su could reply, Void God laughed sarcastically as if he had heard something funny. “Hahaha, Cosmos God, I didn’t bewitch him. It was your disciple who came to the Void Universe to find me and asked me to give him a drop of my Seed of Origin.”

As soon as he said that, Lan Lan, who was standing at the side, understood what had happened.

As for the heart of Cosmos God, it had completely sunk.

The Seed of Origin!

The Seed of Origin required the accumulation of thousands of Life Blood Essence in order to integrate with a life seed. It was extremely powerful. Once someone was planted with the Seed of Origin, it was equivalent to their life and death being controlled by the other person.

This disciple of his was so ruthless!

“Junior Sister! I’m doing this for everyone’s good!”

Lan Su seemed to be overwhelmed by the gazes of Cosmos God and Lan Lan. He gritted his teeth and stepped out. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

He forced himself to raise his head and look straight at Cosmos God.

“Master! Don’t blame disciple for doing this, if you want to blame someone, blame yourself for being too stubborn!”

“Why can’t you see that our Divine Power Universe is no longer a match for the Void Universe? The Void Universe has already unified the two universes!”

“Rather than leaving corpses strewn all over the ground and wasting the lives of innocent people, why not make a wise decision and choose to surrender?”

“Honored Master, your disciple will put it bluntly. Isn’t the reason why you’ve organized everyone to resist the Void Universe all for the sake of your position as Cosmos God? For your own fate energy? You know that once the Divine Power Universe surrenders, you won’t be able to fight alone. You won’t be a match for Void God!”

“But Master, your life is valuable, but aren’t our lives valuable too? Why did you let everyone die with you for your own selfish desires? Master, you’re too selfish!”

A series of words came out of Lan Su’s mouth like a string of bullets.

It was as if he had been suppressing these words for a long time, just to burst out at this moment!

After saying these words, Lan Su seemed to have used up all of his energy. He placed his hands on his knees and panted slightly, but there was a hint of ferocity between his brows.

Cosmos God looked at Lan Su in a daze.

The Seed of Origin from Void God had already taken effect in his body. It was as if countless bugs were gnawing at his body.

However, this heart-piercing pain could not overcome Lan Su’s words.

Lan Su’s words were like a knife that stabbed into his heart, cutting it apart.

Lan Lan covered her mouth and looked at Lan Su in disbelief.

Was this still his humble, gentle, and modest Senior Brother?

At this moment, in Lan Lan’s eyes, Lan Su had turned into a deformed and twisted demon that was about to devour people!

As for Lan Su, after resting for a moment, he took a deep breath and looked at Cosmos God again. His gaze became sincere as he said, “Master, Lord Void God has already promised me that as long as you’re willing to cut off your cultivation and disperse all your fate energy, he’s willing to stop this battle and return peace to the two universes.”

“Master, don’t worry. I’ll never forget the kindness of your upbringing. As long as you’re willing to do so, I’ll definitely let you take care of your old age and live in peace.”

After saying that, Lan Su looked at Cosmos God with a face full of anticipation.

When Void God heard this, the mockery on his face became even more apparent. He turned his gaze slightly and looked at the cosmic God with a faint smile.

“Your disciple is right. Cosmos God, as long as you are willing to do so, I will immediately stop this battle. How about it?”

Cosmos God did not reply. Instead, he looked at Lan Su in disappointment and shook his head, “Lan Su, you are too naive.”

“Do you really think that the war will stop just because I’m dead? I’m telling you, the billions of creatures in the entire Divine Power Universe will become the slaves of the Void Universe and be slaughtered. It will also cut off the cultivation path of the entire Divine Power Universe. When that happens, it will be a real disaster.”

“And you, do you really think you can still live? You won’t be able to live.”

This time, Cosmos God called out Lan Su’s name, and no longer addressed himself as his Master.

His meaning was obvious.

Lan Su’s body trembled when he heard this. He pursed his lips and said, “No! It wouldn’t be like that! Lord Void God promised me that he wouldn’t do this!”

However, this time around, Cosmos God did not bother about him. Instead, he turned around and looked at Void God expressionlessly. A look of determination flashed in his eyes.

“Void God, you can’t win.”

“Oh? Is that so?” Void God stood in the air, and the corners of his mouth slowly curled up. “You’re still so stubborn even at this point?”

Cosmos God did not reply. Instead, he took in a deep breath and said slowly, “Ancestral Technique, Chaos Awakening!!”
