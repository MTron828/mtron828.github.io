Chapter 3127: Rank Six!

——

“Deacon Long, save me, save me quickly!”

Chu Yixiao’s shrill cry reverberated throughout the entire battlefield, and Deacon Long naturally heard it.

When he saw that Chu Yixiao was already in a life and death situation, his expression immediately changed drastically.

“Damn it!”

The dark aura on Deacon Long’s body suddenly surged up.

“Get lost!”

With an explosive shout, the pitch-black long staff in Deacon Long’s hand suddenly turned into a huge black snake. He swung it out angrily, and its power suddenly soared.

Elder Zi Xing, who was fighting Deacon Long, was one level weaker than Deacon Long. Previously, he had barely managed to hold off Deacon Long.

Now that Deacon Long had suddenly erupted, Elder Zi Xing was shocked and quickly waved his spear to block.

However, the power contained in the pitch-black spear was beyond Elder Zi Xing’s expectation. Elder Zi Xing was sent flying by the strike.

Seeing Elder Zi Xing being sent flying, Deacon Long did not chase after him. Instead, he immediately turned around and rushed toward Chu Yixiao.

However, when he turned around, Jian Wushuang had already struck again, and the sword light passed through Chu Yixiao’s divine body again.

Chu Yixiao only had less than 10% of his divine power left.

One more strike and he would die completely!

“No, no!”

Chu Yixiao had gone completely mad, and his voice was hysterical. He stared at Deacon Long, who was his last hope.

In front of him, Jian Wushuang had attacked again.

“Young man, how dare you!”

Deacon Long shouted, and the mighty divine power of a rank six True Saint pressed toward Jian Wushuang.

However, Jian Wushuang was calm under the divine power, as if he was not affected at all. He snorted and moved again.

Whoosh!

The last sword attack was launched.

Chu Yixiao could not block this sword attack, and Deacon Long was still a distance away, so he could not catch up.

“No!”

Chu Yixiao’s eyes were wide open as he watched the sword light pass by him. Then, the three drops of the evil god poison in the sword instantly eroded less than 10% of his divine power, there was not even a trace left.

All the divine power was completely eroded away. Chu Yixiao’s divine body immediately collapsed. His life force was also instantly cut off. He could not be any more dead.

“Junior, you’re courting death!”

Deacon Long was completely enraged when he saw that Chu Yixiao was killed.

Although he did not have any friendship with Chu Yixiao, he would not feel sorry for Chu Yixiao’s death.

But no matter what, Chu Yixiao was still one of the genius disciples of the Purple Cloud Pavilion. This time, he came out with Chu Yixiao, but Chu Yixiao died. As a Deacon, it was naturally difficult for him to escape responsibility. When he returned to the Purple Cloud Pavilion, he would definitely be severely punished.

Especially since Chu Yixiao had an extremely protective master behind him. That master was famous for his ruthlessness and evilness. If that master knew that Chu Yixiao died right under his nose, it was very likely that he would tear him apart alive.

There was only one possibility for him to survive.

“Kill him! Kill this junior and avenge Chu Yixiao so that he won’t die with me!”

Thinking of this, Deacon Long’s eyes immediately turned scarlet.

Boom!

A rank six True Saint appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. Before he could attack, his earth-shaking power had already completely covered Jian Wushuang.

“Oh no!”

“Mr. Heavenly Marquis!”

“Retreat!”

Evil Master, Mirage Water, and Green Prince, who were outside the battlefield, saw this scene and turned pale with fright. They repeatedly cried out for Jian Wushuang to retreat.

Evil Master even asked Elder Zi Xing to rush over to help Jian Wushuang.

Elder Zi Xing had rushed over as fast as he could. However, he had been sent flying by Deacon Long. When he stood firm and rushed over, he was naturally slower. At this time, Deacon Long had already made his move.

“Die!”

Deacon Long’s entire body turned into the boundless darkness.

The surrounding world had also turned completely dark, as if it had completely sunk into darkness.

And in this boundless darkness, the black long staff in Deacon Long’s hand was like a huge black thunderbolt as it swung down fiercely.

Bang!

The long staff smashed down fiercely, and in an instant, it seemed to have brought along the power of the entire surrounding world of darkness.

The world was attracted by the staff.

The power of the roll was shocking!

“Rank six True Saint!”

Jian Wushuang raised his head and stared at the fierce long staff in front of him, but his eyes flashed with a glimmer that had never been seen before.

Rank six True Saint, he…had been longing for it for a long time!

“Come on!”

Jian Wushuang was not afraid at all. His divine power surged, and he exerted his strength to the maximum.

In front of him, the reincarnation sword formation formed by 18 purple demon swords instantly turned into a purple light and shot out first.

The purple light was equally powerful. It first collided with the black long staff.

This collision…bang!

With a loud sound, the purple light directly collapsed and turned into purple demon swords again.

The seventh reincarnation sword formation that Jian Wushuang controlled at this stage was instantly destroyed by the black long staff.

After the reincarnation sword formation was destroyed, the black staff continued to attack Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang held the Blood Mountain Sword with both hands at the same time.

Whoosh!

A blood-red sword light instantly slashed out.

Wushuang sword manual, Xi Xiang!

Clang!

The black staff and the Blood Mountain Sword collided. At the moment of collision, Jian Wushuang felt an amazing power from the black staff.

This power completely crushed him.

In an instant…boom!

Jian Wushuang fell from the sky like a meteorite, and then directly smashed into the ground, creating a huge hole on the ground.

This scene caused the entire battlefield to fall into a short period of silence.

Almost everyone on the battlefield had their eyes focused on him.

“Mr. Heavenly Marquis!”

Evil Master and Mirage Water were both shocked.

“Long Lu, you are a rank six True Saint and one of the top among the Immortal Saints. How could you attack a rank three True Saint yourself? You must be ashamed of yourself!” Elder Zi Xing finally rushed over, his face was full of anger.

“He dared to kill a genius disciple of our Purple Cloud Pavilion. He must die!” Deacon Long shouted in a low voice, his face extremely cold.

But at this moment… Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Boom!

The ground was suddenly lifted up, and then a figure rushed out again. It was Jian Wushuang, who had just been smashed down.

He returned to the void and stood in front of deacon long. His aura was still very strong. At this moment, his eyes were shining with an unprecedented light as he stared at Deacon Long with bright eyes.

“A rank six True Saint is indeed powerful!”

“I’ve already received your strike. In response, you should receive my strike as well!”
