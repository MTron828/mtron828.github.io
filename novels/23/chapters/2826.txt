Chapter 2827: Drunken Samsara

——

Although there were many black divine swords, the Marquis of Three Yin did not think much of their power.

But now, as these black divine swords formed a sword formation and the two giant black trees charged at them, even the Marquis of Three Yin did not dare to underestimate their power.

Boom! Boom!

The two huge black trees were charging at them from both sides.

The blood-colored fog on the Marquis of Three Yin’s body surged, but his right hand was swung out like lightning.

Two claws appeared one after another, and each claw was blood-colored.

In the void, two blood-colored lights seemed to flash out explosively.

These two blood-colored lights truly tore apart the heaven and earth, and in the blink of an eye, they struck the two huge black trees.

Bang! Bang!

The two giant black trees were sent flying again.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang was not angry at all. Instead, he smiled.

Under his control, the two giant black trees immediately disintegrated and turned back into black magic swords.

“Condense!”

Jian Wushuang spoke again and uttered a word.

The 18 black magic swords condensed again, but this time, 18 of them condensed at the same time.

Buzz!

A faint humming sound, like the sound of a sword, rang out slowly.

A brand new, five-meter-long, extremely thin black divine sword appeared between heaven and earth.

The eighteen black divine swords gathered together!

This brand new black divine sword was filled with a frightening amount of power of the law of reincarnation. The sword intent and power it contained were even more... shocking!

“This sword formation!” The Marquis of Three Yin’s pupils shrank as he looked at the newly formed sword formation.

If the two sword formations that Jian Wushuang had formed at the same time only made him take them seriously, then the newly formed sword formation was so powerful that even he changed his expression.

The power contained in this sword formation had definitely reached the level of an Invincible Divine Master.

“Sword One has never displayed such a powerful sword formation when he fought with me last time. But now, it has only been more than a year...” The Marquis of Three Yin frowned and could not believe it.

However, no matter how much he did not believe it, the truth was right in front of him.

“Kill!”

Jian Wushuang shouted, and the five-meter-long black magic sword, which was emitting a shocking power, instantly shot out through the void.

The black magic sword left a perfect arc in the void, giving people the feeling that it was a beautiful black sword light.

The sword light was absolutely beautiful and intoxicating.

It was the third level of the Samsara sword formation, samsara intoxication!

“Humph!”

The Marquis of Three Yin snorted and suddenly rushed forward, gathering vast divine power in his hand.

Chi!

The blood-red claw was slightly clenched, and it brought with it the blood-red power that filled the sky as it slashed out like lightning.

“Heart-ripping divine claw!”

The Marquis of Three Yin’s gaze was cold, and he had already used one of his two ultimate moves, the heart-ripping divine claw.

The beautiful black divine sword was incomparably swift and fierce, and in the blink of an eye, it collided head-on with the blood-red claw.

This collision immediately caused the sound of metal colliding to ring out.

There was not much divine power fluctuation, because the two divine powers had almost worn each other out when they collided.

The black divine sword shook slightly and then moved to the side.

The Marquis of Three Yin’s eyes narrowed. The tremendous impact force contained in the black divine sword forced him to take a few steps back.

After a few steps, the Marquis of Three Yin regained his balance, but his face had become extremely ugly.

“Marquis of Three Yin, how do you feel?” Jian Wushuang stood in the distance and looked at the Marquis of Three Yin with a sneer on his face.

“Sword One, don’t be so proud. Don’t think that I can’t do anything to you with this sword formation,” The Marquis of Three Yin said coldly.

“You’re still stubborn?” Jian Wushuang smiled disdainfully. “Since the sword formation can’t do anything to you, what about this sword formation and my swordsmanship?”

As soon as Jian Wushuang’s voice fell, a huge domain rushed toward the Marquis of Three Yin.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Jian Wushuang also moved.

In terms of speed, Jian Wushuang was also extremely fast, like a ghost.

The Marquis of Three Yin’s eyes were like lightning. He wanted to capture Jian Wushuang’s figure, but suddenly, a slight sword hum sounded in the void around him, and the black magic sword with endless reincarnation power shot toward him again.

“Damn it!”

The Marquis of Three Yin did not dare to underestimate the power of the black magic sword, so he had to immediately block it.

However, as soon as he blocked the black magic sword, Jian Wushuang’s figure appeared beside him. Then, a series of strange sword techniques containing the majestic space-time rule attacked him.

The reincarnation sword formation exerted the reincarnation rule to the extreme, while Jian Wushuang’s sword technique exerted the space-time rule to the extreme.

The two rules complemented each other. One used close combat, while the other formed a sword formation to attack continuously. It was a perfect combination.

For a time, Jian Wushuang’s battle strength had soared to the limit.

Under such circumstances, the Marquis of Three Yin’s advantage in speed and strength had been greatly limited. The blood-colored fog on his body surged, and he had also maximized his strength. However, even so... he could only fight with Jian Wushuang to a draw. As for the scene where he easily suppressed Jian Wushuang more than a year ago, it had never happened again.

“This kid, the last time I fought with him was just more than a year ago. At that time, I could easily suppress him. But now... when I fight with him head-on, I can’t even gain the slightest advantage?” Marquis of Three Yin was extremely shocked, but he was more unwilling.

He wanted to find an opportunity to use his strongest skill.

However, with the combination of Jian Wushuang’s sword formation and swordsmanship, he could not find an opportunity to use his strongest skill.

Indeed, he did not have the slightest advantage in the fight with Jian Wushuang.

On both sides of the battlefield, the experts from both sides of the Pill Sun Sacred World and the Heavenly Void World were shocked to see the battlefield.

“Who is this person? How can he be on par with the Marquis of Three Yin?”

“The Marquis of Three Yin has tried his best, but he still can’t gain any advantage. This Sword One... is so powerful!”

“The Marquis of Three Yin has fought with this sword one not long ago. Last time, he definitely suppressed sword one. But now, it has only been a year. This sword one hasn’t made any breakthroughs. How can he improve so much?”

Many experts of the Heavenly Void World could not believe what they were seeing.

The Marquis of Three Yin was a supreme existence in the Heavenly Void World, second only to the Heavenly Void Temple Master. They all knew how powerful the Invincible Divine Master was.

And Sword One was able to fight him to a draw. This was enough to show Sword One’s battle strength.

As for the experts of the Pill Sun Sacred World, they were also shocked.
