Chapter 1854: Jian Wushuang’s Strength

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Then, Emperor God Zhu Long could only feel his internal organs burning and his aura instantly grew dispirited.

At the same time, his heart was shivering with fright, “He’s too strong, just as stated on the information. Jian Wushuang’s three Hong Jun Golden Swords are as powerful as a hit of a Peak Emperor God each. The combination of the three could simply suppress an ordinary Peak Emperor God!”

Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!

The three golden lights floated in the void and floated in front of Emperor God Zhu Long. With Jian Wushuang’s willpower, the three Hong Jun Golden Swords would attack again and kill Emperor God Zhu Long.

“Sword Emperor, spare my life!” Emperor God Zhu Long quickly begged for mercy. “I do not have bad intentions. I do not harbor malice.”

“You do not harbor malice? Right, you do not. However, the purpose of your visit and what you are thinking in your head, you and I know clearly. There’s no need for bullshit. Listen up, go back and tell the people behind you that they’d better send some powerful experts if they intend to probe Lineage of Star and find out if our Palace Master passed away. If they have the power to force Lineage of Star into a desperate situation, into a corner. Then, they will find out.”

“What’s the purpose of sending rubbish like you?” Jian Wushuang sneered.

Emperor God Zhu Long heard and felt angry.

One should know that he was an Emperor God and his ranking on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list wasn’t low, but in the end, Jian Wushuang had referred to him as rubbish?

“Emperor God Zhu Long, I will give you two options now. Either you stay here, or you… f*ck off!” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

Emperor God Zhu Long looked furious but he couldn’t let loose. He could only hold back his anger and turn to leave.

Watching Emperor God Zhu Long leave, the surrounding Hall Masters let out breaths of relief.

Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold. He looked at the deacon elders and disciples that had gathered around him. The elders and disciples looked on in distress. They were obviously affected by what Emperor God Zhu Long said.

“What you all of you doing standing here? Go ahead and do what you must,” Jian Wushuang bellowed.

The elders and disciples look at Jian Wushuang in reverence and then turned to leave.

Although they left, their emotions would be hard to calm down.

Jian Wushuang could do nothing about it.

“I never thought that Emperor God Zhu Long would make that move,” Jian Wushuang’s voice was low.

Emperor God Zhu Long tried to probe verbally and Jian Wushuang was mentally prepared. Even when he intentionally became angry, it was within Jian Wushuang’s expectations as well.

However, Jian Wushuang had never expected that Emperor God Zhu Long would intentionally spread the news about the Master of Star Palace’s death within Lineage of Star so that the elders and disciples would hear of it.

One should know that the founder of Lineage of Star, the Master of Star Palace, was truly the mainstay.

As long as he was alive, Lineage of Star would be in safe hands.

However, even though the news about the Master of Star Palace’s death had yet to be verified, the elders and disciples in Lineage of Star would inevitably be suspicious.

Especially when the news spread to the other elders and disciples, everyone would panic and Lineage of Star would lose its order.

At such a crucial moment, unless the Master of Star Palace revealed himself again, the situation would be hard to deal with.

“I really want to kill Emperor God Zhu Long earlier,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Emperor God Zhu Long came to visit after all and he never provoked Lineage of Star in public. If we were to kill him in Lineage of Star, it would be unreasonable,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“I know, that’s why I held back,” Jian Wushuang said, “However, they didn’t give ourselves away when Emperor God Zhu Long probed. The forces and experts in Sanctuary Alliance still couldn’t be sure if the Master of Star Palace passed away. It’s alright, but we have to comfort our elders and disciples. Hall Master Yuan, please take care of this.”

“No problem. I know what to do,” Hall Master Yuan replied. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Mm.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and then returned to Sword Star to begin cultivation.

He had to grasp every minute and second to increase his power.

On the other hand, not long after Emperor God Zhu Long had left Lineage of Star, he appeared in a unique void.

There were four thrones floating in the void and there were four figures seated on the throne. Of course, the four figures were merely consciousness incarnation. They represented the four major forces in Eternal Chaotic World. For instance, Emperor God Tian Xiao from Soaring Heaven King Palace, his consciousness embodiment was among the four.

“Emperor God Long Zhu, how did it go?” Emperor God Tian Xiao looked at him.

“Needless to say, judging by his look, he definitely got rejected,” an evil-looking elderly teased.

Emperor God Zhu Long humphed coldly then he took out a token, “This is the mirror image after I entered Lineage of Star. I recorded it with the token. I have probed whatever I can. As for the result, you can determine it on your own.”

Then, Emperor God Zhu Long left.

He had gone to probe Lineage of Star personally because of the benefits that the four major forces had offered.

He had already acted according to the four major forces’ requirements. He didn’t care about the final result.

After Emperor God Zhu Long had left, the four consciousness’ embodiment on the throne immediately watched the mirror image. The four of them were quiet after they saw the scene within Lineage of Star.

“Did you notice anything?” Emperor God Tian Xiao looked at the other three figures.

“No,” the evil-looking elderly shook his head, “From the beginning until the end, the experts from Lineage of Star were calm and composed. As for Sword Emperor, he was as overbearing as ever. Besides, the elders and disciples in Lineage of Star looked like they didn’t know the news about the Master of Star Palace’s death

“Calmness can be forged. As for the elders and disciples, it’s normal that they wouldn’t know about the death of the Master of Star Palace. It is such a major news. The moment it spread, the entire Lineage of Star would be in chaos. If I were to be Sword Emperor, I definitely wouldn’t announce it either. The one that I truly care is Sword Emperor. His strength is shocking,” a brawny, middle-aged man said.

“Before the news about the Master of Star Palace’s death spread, it was normal that he is so overbearing. But now… one should know that Emperor God Zhu Long is an Emperor God and there is a strong force backing him up. However, Sword Emperor got furious because of his one line and Sword Emperor injured him directly. If they weren’t in Lineage of Star’s lair, I reckon he might have killed Emperor God Zhu Long directly!”
