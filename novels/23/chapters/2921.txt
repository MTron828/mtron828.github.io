Chapter 2922: Go!

——

“Who is this kid? What’s his background?” The shadowy figure stared at Jian Wushuang, full of shock and curiosity.

Rumble~

In the endless thunderclouds, a destructive power had already spread out.

But this destructive power had completely locked onto Jian Wushuang.

“Is it coming?”

Jian Wushuang was directly below the thunderclouds. His face was cold, and his body was slightly trembling, but he still retained a trace of unyielding in his heart.

At the same time, a dark gray jade slip appeared in Jian Wushuang’s hand.

The dark gray jade slip was his ultimate life-saving move.

But he did not want to pass it now.

His eyes looked through the void in front of him. Leng Rushuang was still in a deep sleep, and the shadowy figure was standing next to her.

If Jian Wushuang wanted to go up and snatch Leng Rushuang, he had to pass through this shadowy figure.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang’s heart was trembling crazily. He was roaring crazily, and there was endless unwillingness in his heart!

However, no matter how unwilling he was, he had to be clear about the situation in front of him.

Boom!

With a violent boom, the destructive power in the void above and deep in the thunderclouds finally exploded.

Countless dark purple thunderbolts that could easily shatter the void and kill the Immortal Saint gathered together at an astonishing speed. Under the gathering of these thunderbolts, a huge face was formed in the blink of an eye.

That’s right. It was a human face.

This human face was icy. It slowly descended from the void above. The further down it went, the more the destructive power multiplied.

In the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, countless cultivators sensed the power contained within this human face. Everyone was stunned.

Even the shadowy figure, who was a dignified master of laws, felt a slight tremble in her heart when she saw this human face that was completely formed from thunderbolts. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“The will of heaven! This is the power of the will of heaven!”

“Even in the third heaven, where the will of heaven is weak, the power of the will of heaven is still strong enough to kill rule masters. If it reaches the third heaven, the power of the will of heaven is said to be able to suppress even saint realm masters!”

“No one can resist such power.”

The hazy figure shook her head secretly, but she looked at Jian Wushuang with a hint of pity.

In her opinion, Jian Wushuang was dead for sure if the will of heaven attacked him personally. Then, he would not have any room to struggle.

It was true.

When the human face swooped down and kept approaching Jian Wushuang, the pressure Jian Wushuang felt multiplied. It made him despair. He could not move his hand, which was holding the jade slip. He could not crush the jade slip directly.

But at this time… crash!

The surrounding void suddenly broke.

Without any warning, a huge black hole directly appeared.

And in this space black hole, a huge hand directly extended out.

This huge hand contained the power to rip the sky. As soon as it appeared, it struck the human face like lightning, and it happened to hit the face of the human face.

With a crisp sound, the human face directly collapsed and turned into a sky full of dark purple Thunderbolts, which swept wildly in all directions.

Each of these dark purple thunderbolts had the power to destroy the world. As they swept through the surrounding void, the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion immediately suffered.

The earth rumbled crazily, and the thunderbolts shattered countless mountain buildings. Some unlucky people were even struck by the dark purple thunderbolts and died on the spot.

“Jian Wushuang, run!”

A deep voice suddenly sounded in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

This voice made Jian Wushuang’s body and mind tremble. He stared at Leng Rushuang in front of him, and his fingertips had already pierced into his flesh.

“If Shuang Er loses hair or suffers any injustice, I will destroy your whole family from now on!”

Jian Wushuang’s cold voice resounded across the entire sky.

After his voice fell, Jian Wushuang finally crushed the dark-gray jade slip in his hand.

The dark-gray jade slip contained a skill, which was… teleportation!

As the jade slip was crushed, a wave of space-time power was activated, and Jian Wushuang’s figure instantly disappeared from the spot.

Jian Wushuang had already left.

The giant hand that stretched out from the void was retracted, and the void was restored without leaving a trace.

Only the top of the sky was left. Countless deep purple thunderbolts were still dancing crazily, and the destructive power was getting stronger and more violent.

Terrifying booms were heard continuously.

It was obvious that the power of the will of heaven was angry.

“Someone saved the Divine Master under the power of the will of heaven?” The shadowy figure still existed in this world. She had seen everything that had just happened, and now she was shocked.

The power of the will of heaven just now, even if her original body came, would be destroyed on the spot.

However, someone, who was hundreds of millions of miles away, used a great method to destroy the destructive power of the will of heaven and save Jian Wushuang.

How terrifying was the person who had just saved Jian Wushuang?

“Eh? What happened to the power of the will of heaven?”

The hazy figure raised her head again and looked over in surprise.

She could see that the power of the will of heaven was obviously still in a rage. However, in her opinion, since Jian Wushuang had been rescued, the power of the will of heaven should have dissipated very soon. However, looking at the traces now… the power of the will of heaven did not have any intention of dissipating.

And at this moment… in the vast thunder sea above, a space passage slowly appeared.

That’s right, it was a spatial tunnel.

There was not the slightest spatial factor in the void previously. However, a tunnel had been forcefully opened up by someone.

A human figure slowly appeared at the end of the spatial tunnel.

The human figure slowly walked out of the spatial tunnel and quickly appeared in everyone’s sight.

This was a bald man wearing a white robe. He was smiling. This bald man was barefoot and his entire body was bathed in sunlight. White light flickered on his body, giving off a gentle feeling of a cool breeze.

He stood there in the air and did not speak. However, everyone in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion seemed to have completely calmed down.

Everyone became calm and peaceful.

At the same time, everyone’s gaze, including that of the blurry figure, could not help but look at the white-robed bald man.

The blurry figure’s eyes were already wide open.

“Sage Lord!”
