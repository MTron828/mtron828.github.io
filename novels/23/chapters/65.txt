After drinks, Wang Yuan was hanging out with Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan.

“You two have just arrived at Dragon Palace. Let me show you around. I’ll take you to the treasure troves of Dragon Palace,” Wang Yuan said.

“All right.” Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan nodded.

Dragon Palace covered a large area and was famous for three treasure troves: Four Temples of Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind, Secret Land of Heaven and Earth, and Secret Pavilion. The first place Wang Yuan brought them to was Four Temples of Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind.

“Look, this is Four Temples of Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind.” Wang Yuan pointed to the four pavilions which covered a wide area. Each pavilion had a gilded character engraved on the lintel, Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind respectively. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“The Four Temples of Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind are where the Disciples of Dragon Palace visit the most. Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind represent the four kinds of Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth, which are, Earth Essence Realm, Raging Fire Realm, Waterdrop Essence Realm, and Gale Essence Realm.”

“There’re six Temple Masters in each temple. They’re the top experts in the world and have reached the highest level of comprehending Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth. The reason why Disciples of Dragon Palace often visit Four Temples is that the Temple Masters usually give lessons in the temples, displaying some Martial Arts Techniques and giving disciples some advice.”

“If you have any problem in comprehending Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth, you can consult these Temple Masters. After receiving their guidance, you might be enlightened.”

On hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s and Yang Zaixuan’s eyes lit up.

“If I have any problem in comprehending Essence Realm, I can consult these Temple Masters? What’s more, there are six Temple Masters dealing with each Essence Realm?”

“The six Temple Masters in each temple should be good at different aspects?”

It would be superior to following a top expert.

Although a top expert would try his best to teach someone, he was alone and studied only one aspect. If he encountered unfamiliar fields, he would not know how to instruct them.

In Dragon Palace, Four Temples covered four kinds of Essence Realms of Heaven and Earth. Each temple had six powerful Temple Masters, who studied various fields. Therefore, the disciples did not worry that they would encounter an unsolvable problem.

“Now we come to the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth.”

Wang Yuan led the way. Then they stood in front of a majestic palace, two Golden-armored Sergeants kept guard at the palace entrance.

Wang Yuan said, “Secret Land of Heaven and Earth is special and helpful at comprehending the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth, if you want to enter Secret Land of Heaven and Earth, you need to pay 1,000 points to access the palace, and you can only stay inside for two hours each time.”

“Though it is only two hours, I’m sure you’ll benefit greatly from each visit. Moreover, you’re newcomers in Dragon Palace, so each of you can enter the palace for free three times.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang said, raising his eyebrows.

He had just been surprised at the Four Temples of Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind. The Secret Land of Heaven and Earth was as famous as the Four Temples. Jian Wushuang was somewhat curious about it, as the palace, with the harsh requirements to access it, must be extraordinary.

“How about it? Do you want to have a try?” Wang Yuan smiled mysteriously.

“Sure.” Jian Wushuang gave a little smile and then glanced at Yang Zaixuan. “Second elder brother, you go first.”

Yang Zaixuan nodded and directly walked toward the palace. The two Golden-armored Sergeant stepped forwards, but immediately allowed Yang Zaixuan to enter Secret Land of Heaven and Earth.

Two hours later, Yang Zaixuan came out of it with a blank look.

“Second elder brother?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Don’t disturb him. He’s in the state of comprehension.” Wang Yuan was not surprised at all and spoke to Jian Wushuang. “Third younger brother, it’s your turn.”

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly, and then he stepped towards the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth.

The two Golden-armored Sergeants walked forward again, and let Jian Wushuang enter after realizing that he was a newcomer.

“What on earth is stored in the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth?”

Jian Wushuang stepped into the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth with a flicker of curiosity.

As soon as he entered, Jian Wushuang immediately felt himself surrounded by darkness. There was only a glimmer of light ahead in the endless darkness.

Jian Wushuang could not help but look at the light.

He was totally absorbed in it. The glimmer of light suddenly changed into a sword, which contained Sword Essence of Gale, Earth Sword Essence, Sword Essence of Raging Fire, and Sword Essence of the Waterdrop. He knew the four kinds of sword essence were unfathomable, although he had not comprehended the last two.

Jian Wushuang drew out Triple-kill Sword behind him, the sword light starting to move…

One after another, the ethereal sword light moved flexibly.

Jian Wushuang then started to perform the Anonymous Swordsmanship.

He easily showed the First Move of Anonymous Swordsmanship, Blood Shadow.

He did not encounter any problem either in performing the Second Move of Anonymous Swordsmanship, Sword-killing Movement.

The Third Move of Anonymous Swordsmanship, named Expeditious Maneuver, was a terrifying Killing Move, emphasizing absolute speed.

Jian Wushuang had not comprehended this move. He thought it was because his speed at unleashing the sword was not fast enough. In fact, it was related to his inferior comprehension of Sword Essence of Gale.

However, Jian Wushuang could not help wielding his Long Sword and slowly performed this move in this special situation.

Hoo!

The sword light flashed and then disappeared with the wind.

He naturally performed the Third Move of Anonymous Swordsmanship, Expeditious Maneuver.

Nevertheless, it was not over.

As Jian Wushuang continued to wield Long Sword, the sword light became grander and more massive.

Every beam of the sword light contained Sword Essence of Earth.

One strike after another…

Suddenly, the glimmer of light disappeared. Jian Wushuang was slightly surprised and blankly stared into space.

” Two hours, I’ve run out of time? ” Jian Wushuang looked into the darkness, sighing. Then he turned to leave.

Jian Wushuang walked out of Secret Land of Heaven and Earth and saw his three sworn brothers waiting outside, but he ignored them and directly sat on the ground, with eyes closed.

Wang Yuan, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou were not angry at Jian Wushuang. They knew Jian Wushuang’s state and did not want to disturb him. After a while, Jian Wushuang finally breathed a sigh of relief and immediately stood up.

“How about it?” Wang Yuan asked with a smile.

“Good, very good.” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily. “The benefits from practicing in Secret Land of Heaven and Earth for two hours can be comparable to that from earnest cultivation in a month.”
