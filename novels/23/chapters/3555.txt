Chapter 3556: Shi Yan and Red Eye

After obtaining the axe, which was a top-tier universe supreme treasure, from the monster, Jian Wushuang continued to explore the Nine Twists Demon Cave alone.

Thirty years passed in a flash.

In the Nine Twists Demon Cave, there was an endless pile of black stones.

Bang! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

A loud bang shook the sky, and a powerful force swept across, shattering the rocks into pieces.

Sou!

An extremely wretched figure appeared from within that powerful force. This person was dressed in a black robe, and his face was thin. He had a pair of mustaches.

His body trembled as he looked at the two people in front of him, and he roared angrily, “Shi Yan Master, Red Eye Master, your Northern Sea Palace is really going too far!”

“Going too far?” Said a middle-aged man wearing a fiery red armor. His body was also surging with raging flames, and he looked like a flame war god. There was a sneer on the corner of the middle-aged man’s mouth. “Heng Yi, to think that you are a great being who has been adventuring in this Universe Battlefield for so many years. Why are you still so nave when you speak? In this world, the strong prey on the weak. Whoever has the biggest fist is the truth.”

“Hand over your senior universe true treasure armor honestly. This way, Red Eye and I can let you live. Otherwise...”

The middle-aged man who looked like flame war god, Shi Yan Master, had not finished his words, but the killing intent in his eyes had already revealed his intentions.

“Heng Yi, hand it over. If I join hands with stone hatred, you won’t even be able to escape,” Red Eye Master, a beautiful woman wearing a purplish-red robe and with a pair of strange red eyes, said.

Under the combined threat of the two, even though Heng Yi Master was extremely unwilling, he still took out his high-level universe armor and threw it at Shi Yan Master, then he immediately turned and fled.

Seeing Heng Yi Master hand over his true treasure armor, Shi Yan Master and Red Eye Master had no intention of chasing after him.

“At least he is tactful. Otherwise, he would have died here.” Red Eye Master smiled coldly.

“If it is possible not to kill him, then it is better not to kill him,” Shi Yan Master said with a serious expression. “Even though with our powers, it would be easy for us to kill him, but by doing so, we can be considered to have offended the faction behind him. If it was just this one time, then it would have been fine. North Sea Palace, where we are, is definitely one of the top three great factions in this territory. There is no need to care at all.”

“But the most important thing is that we will continue to do so. If we kill them all, we will make too many enemies and bring trouble to the North Sea Palace. After all, we are not those lone wolves who can kill at will. They are not afraid of wearing shoes and can do whatever they want, but we can’t.”

In the three great cosmic battlefields of this territory, although there were many experts who liked to kill, killing everyone they saw just to plunder the treasures of the other party, but such experts…almost all of them were independent experts who did not have anything to worry about. Only such experts did not need to worry about anything.

However, some experts who came from different astral worlds and different forces would not recklessly slaughter experts when they were roaming in the three great battlefields, because they would crazily slaughter others…the Great Beings from the forces behind others would also slaughter their own people crazily. In this way, both sides could only fight to the death, which was what no force wanted to see.

Therefore, those great beings from different astral worlds and different forces would obey some restrictions when adventuring in the three great Universe Battlefields. Except for fighting for the chance of a true treasure, there was no definite reason, it was not easy for them to kill each other.

For example, right now, Shi Yan Master and Red Eye Master had the power to kill Heng Yi Master, but they did not choose to kill him. They only forced him to hand over his senior true treasure armor.

“Although we can’t kill him directly and take away all the treasures on his body, we can force him to hand over his most precious treasures on his own accord. That will be enough for us to make quite a fortune,” said Shi Yan Master.

“That’s true. With our strength, we might not dare to say anything else, but in this Nine Twists Demon Cave, we should be able to do whatever we want. Other than those experts at the pinnacle of the six realm that we can’t do anything to, the other Principles Masters below the sixth realm can only obediently hand over their strongest treasures when they encounter the two of us.” Red Eye Master smiled strangely.

“Don’t be happy too early. The two of us are working together to explore this place and force the experts we meet to hand over their strongest treasures. Although we won’t encounter any obstacles in the beginning, as time passes, when this news spreads out and causes the experts of the Nine Twists Demon Cave to be on guard, our chances of succeeding will be greatly reduced. Therefore, we must make the most of our time. Before this news spreads out completely, we must find more experts and force them to hand over their most precious treasures.” Shi Yan Master said.

In this territory, although the news of the various astral worlds and various powers were extremely well-informed, after all, there were simply too many powers in this territory’s astral world. Moreover, most of these astral worlds and powers had their own thoughts, even if they obtained some news, they would not easily share it. Hence, the speed of the news flow was not too fast.

For example, the Shi Yan Master and the Red Eye Master were wantonly searching for prey in the Nine Twists Demon Cave. Even though they had already succeeded a few times, this news was still not widely known. Among the experts who were adventuring in the Nine Twists Demon Cave…most of them did not know about this matter and were not on guard. This period of time was the best time for them to hunt.

If the news spread and the experts in the Nine Twists Demon Cave became wary of the two of them, their chances of success would be greatly reduced.

As the two of them were talking.

Red Eye Master’s expression suddenly changed.

“There’s a new prey,” Red Eye Master said.

“Oh, who is it?” Shi Yan Master immediately looked over.

Of the two of them, Shi Yan Master specialized in direct combat, and his strength was extremely tyrannical. He had already reached the pinnacle of the six realm. As for Red Eye Master, although her combat strength was not strong, she had only barely reached the high level of the sixth realm, however, what Red Eye Master specialized in the most was her soul power!

Her soul attack technique was incomparably tyrannical. Even experts at the pinnacle of the six realm would not dare to underestimate her soul attack. Her attainments in the soul aspect were so high that her soul perception ability was naturally terrifyingly strong, at the very least, she was stronger than the Shi Yan Master.

Just like now, the Shi Yan Master did not sense the existence of other experts in the surroundings, but the Red Eye Master did.
