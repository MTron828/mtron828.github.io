Chapter 5397 Stellar Pavilion

His strength was average, just a regular tier 2 Emperor, but his father was extraordinary, the strongest tier 4 Emperor within the Stellar Pavilion.

The Holy Maiden of the Stellar Pavilion, Miaoyi, had slightly red eyes. Faced with the person she had despised the most before, she could only force a smile and nod.

Despite her appearance as a weak woman, ever since her mother, Gong Yun, fell, she began plotting her retreat.

The main trading house of the Stellar Pavilion held numerous treasures, equivalent to the entire net worth of a tier 5 Emperor, worth billions of godstones. These treasures were a juicy piece of meat; not only the internal experts but even external powerhouses coveted a share.

She couldn't afford to sit idly by.

Among the three elders, the only female elder, who had a sisterly bond with her mother, naturally followed her. In secret, she recruited three top-level tier 4 Emperors from the southern regions and even colluded with people from the Mo Luo Nation.

The Western Sea had recently been restless, with frequent appearances of Mo Luo Nation's powerhouses.

Of course, the powerhouses from Mo Luo Nation didn't care much about her possessions. The only thing in the Stellar Pavilion that could catch the eye of Mo Luo's powerhouses was the Holy Maiden. The beauty of the Holy Maiden Gong Miaoyi was renowned throughout the West Sea, and her mother was not lacking in looks either, attracting the desires of many tier 5 Emperors.

Of course, in secret, nobody knew that she had a romantic affair with that tier 5 Emperor. Anyway, in the West Sea, those tier 5 independent old monsters wouldn't dare to provoke the Master of the Stellar Pavilion.

However, times changed, and now those eyeing the Stellar Pavilion were either after Miaoyi or the wealth of the Stellar Pavilion.

The funeral ceremonies continued for three days, attracting many so-called big shots, including over a hundred tier 4 Emperors. It certainly broadened the horizons of many.

This all took place in the cave mansion on Redwood Island where the Stellar Pavilion was located.

In the cave abode of the Stellar Pavilion on Redwood Island.

Gong Miaoyi was dressed in a long black dress. There were no outsiders around, so there was no need for her to disguise herself. She took off her veil, revealing her misty face.

Her face was indeed like her mother's, so beautiful that it made one's hair stand on end. Even in Tiannan, her beauty would be a disaster.

"Brother Yan, you will help me, right?" Gong Miaoyi's eyes were slightly red as she looked at the dispirited man in front of her.

Yan Changqing was a famous expert in the Western Region, a peak tier 4 expert.Visjt nùíêvelbin(.)cùíêm for new updates

Out of the three Emperors she had summoned in Tiannan, only two had arrived. They had probably seen the battle over the past few days and did not want to get involved in the dispute.

"Don't worry!" Yan Changqing was moved. "With me around, that old man won't dare to do anything to you!"

He was naturally talking about the Grand Elder of the Stellar Tower.

That Grand Elder was very ambitious. Back then, her mother had fallen too quickly. She had fallen before she could make any arrangements, leaving behind this mess.

"With your words, I can rest assured!" Tears streamed down Gong Miaoyi's face, making Yan Changqing's heart ache.

Yan Changqing swallowed his saliva and said with a trembling voice, "Miaoyi, why don't you come with me? Let's leave the West Sea and go to Tiannan!"

Gong Miaoyi put on her veil again and her heart skipped a beat. "Can you let go of Sister-in-law?"

Yan Changqing was stunned. He shifted his gaze away from Gong Miaoyi's face. "Her?"

Thinking of this, he felt somewhat guilty.

But the one he truly liked was Gong Miaoyi. Ever since he met her, he became infatuated. If it weren't for the powerful force behind his wife, he would have divorced his current wife a long time ago.

"Alright, Brother Yan, don't think too much. The most crucial thing now is that jade slip. It's the most important thing for our Stellar Pavilion." Gong Miaoyi revealed a faint smile.

Now there were three tier 4 Emperors, plus an elder from the Stellar Pavilion.

Over the years, she had recruited many tier 3 Emperors, many of whom were drawn by her appearance.

"Deng Bo, how are the candidates?" Gong Miaoyi saw the newcomer and her eyes flickered.

The old man who had been overseeing the Redwood Island Trading Company walked out slowly, nodding without saying a word.

Gong Miaoyi sighed and her tone became more serious. "Delay may lead to changes. Today, we set out."

The group left the cave and flew towards the sea area, with Gong Miaoyi's destination being the Swirling Sea.

There, a cave awaited her to unlock-a significant asset left by her mother.

Swirling Sea.

Jian Wushuang fought tirelessly, and 100 years had passed.

He hadn't rested a day in a hundred years, constantly hunting sea monsters.

Now, in the depths of the Swirling Sea, half of the sea monsters in the vortex had been sharply reduced. Jian Wushuang had too many methods; under the amplification of the Beast God Domain, the sea monsters he killed could be described as countless.

There were already tens of thousands of sea monster origin source stored in the bracelet.

"Not enough?"

Jian Wushuang felt a bit exhausted.

On the sacrificial platform, Bai Junwang sat in meditation, his eyes sharp, and his voice deep, "It's enough!"

The colorful origin source had completely condensed into form.

Under Jian Wushuang's refinement of the power of all things, it had become thoroughly stable.¬†

Exhaling deeply, Jian Wushuang smiled proudly, "You've drained half of my origin source. If it weren't for the strength of my origin source, I'm afraid even giving my life wouldn't be enough for you."

His origin source was immensely profound, yet it still took

considerable effort to assist Bai Junwang in condensing the current origin source.

"Haha, don't worry. What I have, you will have in the future, and what I don't have, you will still obtain!"

Seeing his strength about to reach its peak again, Bai Junwang was excited.

With the successful condensation of the origin source, he no longer needed to rely on Jian Wushuang's sea of origin source.

Feeling the origin source that belonged to him within his body, Bai Junwang laughed wildly.

This was a complete path of the origin source.

Although he had witnessed Jian Wushuang's path of the origin source and felt that his own was just average, having something was still better than having nothing!

When he had chosen the path of the divine body back then, his

origin source had withered, and before it withered, it was already a crippled origin source. Climbing to the top was something he could never dream of.bender

Now, with renewed hope, Jian Wushuang was like his reborn parents. Although all of this also had the help of the divine spirits, they were also stumbling blocks for him.

However, bound by the oath, he couldn't break free.

But as long as his strength could become stronger, he had no regrets!

"Now, only the physical body and divine body are left. I wonder what the Lord Shen Ling has prepared for me."

Jian Wushuang casually waved his hand, and the physical body of a middle-aged man appeared before him. Soon, a trace of boundless meaning emanated from his fingertips.

The physical body was ordinary, but it was sufficient.

As the divine body entered, it instantly increased to a level of 10,000-fold.

Bai Junwang was not reserved either. He had been waiting for this day. After the origin source took residence, his entire being radiated a new spiritual countenance.

He was the once white-haired Emperor, standing proudly in the world.

With a slight clench of his fist, a domineering aura was unmistakably revealed.

"This divine body is too weak. Even with a 10,000-fold divine body, it's only enough for you to unleash the peak power of the tier 4. If it's too strong, this divine body will collapse," Jian Wushuang reminded from the side, then took out a treasure he hadn't used before.

Bai Junwang nodded, grinning wickedly. "Haha, just for some fun. I'm still waiting for the body and divine body that Lord Shen Ling is preparing for me. But being able to feel my own existence is enough. I've been holding back for countless years, and finally, I can let loose a bit. Let's go, we're heading to Redwood Island, hehe!"
