Chapter 2111 Heaven Repairing Palace

“Red Dragon King, what is the Heaven Repairing Palace?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Jian Wushuang had just reached the top ranks of the Sanctuary Alliance. He did not know much.

He had never heard of the Heaven Repairing Palace.

“That palace is a site of opportunity discovered long ago at the Ancient Mystery Land, taken by the Sanctuary Alliance immediately, till now,” Red Dragon King explained. “In the Heaven Repairing Palace lies the opportunity of passage towards the Heavens, but at a dear price which even the Alliance cannot bear to pay. Since its discovery, the Palace has only been used once.”

“There are twelve seats in the Palace, meaning every time it opens only a dozen people are allowed to enter. The last time we opened it those chosen experts received great benefits. Great Emperor Coloured Glaze and Emperor Jiu Qiao themselves attained Great Emperor levels upon entering,” the Red Dragon King continued.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

From one occasion two Great Emperors had emerged?

This site of opportunity…

“We did not know much about the Palace before we activated it. But after we did, we realised it was not only a site of opportunity, but a land of miracles! Any potential pinnacle Emperor God stuck at an ability plateau could easily attain Great Emperor levels with this Palace!”

“Unfortunately, the price to pay for opening the Palace is too great. We have not opened it since the first attempt. But with the Eternal Chaotic World barely hanging on, the Sanctuary Alliance must not get stingy with these affairs. That is why Emperor Bai and I have agreed to activate it once again at a later time, to help our Great Emperors improve their powers before the battle.”

“Since that decision, the twelve experts entering must be chosen deliberately and carefully. We have made a list of certain Emperor Gods we want to enter, and the Emperor God Jue Xian certainly did not make the list,” the Red Dragon King said.

Jian Wushuang understood. The Heaven Repairing Palace had great potential for pinnacle Emperor Gods to emerge as Great Emperor levels.

But there were only twelve spots, and all twelve were extremely important. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Now, Emperor God Jue Xian’s condition was for the Alliance to give him one seat.

“Jue Xian, you should know, with your abilities, even if you did enter the Palace, the chances of you becoming Great Emperor are slim to none,” Red Dragon King roared.

“I know, but slim as they are, there is still a chance! If you save a seat for me… not just the Soul Attack secret skill, I’ll give everything I have for the both of you!” Emperor God Jue Xian clenched his fists, his body trembling slightly.

He knew his conditions were a bit much.

But that was his only way of becoming a Great Emperor. It was worth him risking his life for, no matter how slim the chances were.

Jian Wushuang and Red Dragon King fell quiet.

After a period of time, Jian Wushuang finally spoke. “The decision of who gets to enter the Palace is too big a decision for me alone to decide. I will take this up to Emperor Bai and discuss it with him. I’ll keep you updated.”

“Thank you Sword Emperor!” Emperor God Jue Xian was elated.

Jian Wushuang did not accept his offer, but nor did he reject it. Meaning to say, there was still hope.

“Red Dragon King, don’t mind if you wait here for a while,” Jian Wushuang glanced at him.

“Not an issue,” the Red Dragon King Replied.

Jian Wushuang’s consciousness incarnation instantly dispersed.

…

On Thunderbolt Island.

“The Emperor God Jue Xian is willing to hand over the secret skill, but he wants a seat in the Heaven Repairing Palace,” Jian Wushuang said.

“A seat in the Heaven Repairing Palace? What a funny guy,” Ancestor Tian Chen sneered.

“But it’s unexpected. With his own abilities, unless he encountered a miracle, he would never make it to Great Emperor level. The Heaven Repairing Palace is his only chance at that, and he will hold on to it tightly,” Emperor Bai laughed.

“A seat in the Palace is no small matter. Maybe it will be possible during other times, but during this period of chaos within the Eternal Chaotic World, we need the seats for our potential Emperor Gods to elevate to Great Emperors. His name is not even in our list. It would be a waste if we handed it to him,” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

“The seats are important, but so is the secret skill. Since this lad has given his conditions, we cannot ignore or pressure him otherwise. Tell him that the seat is his, but he will be sent to the most dangerous frontline against the Three Emperors World when the battle breaks out, whether he makes it to Great Emperor levels or not.”

“If he wishes to gamble, he must also dedicate himself to the Sanctuary Alliance,” Emperor Bai said.

“Agreed,” both Jian Wushuang and Ancestor Tian Chen nodded in agreement.

“So that’s that. Since we are on the topic of lists, Wushuang, I would like you to take a look at it as well,” Emperor Bai said. With a wave of his hand, a list appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

The list had a couple names, all of which were known Emperor Gods within the Eternal Chaotic World. Not only the pinnacle Emperor Gods had made the list, even those who had not but had enough potential would find their names on it as well.

“Over thirty names?” Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows twitched.

“These are the unconfirmed ones. We have confirmed a few already, like Underworld God, Emperor God Tian Ling, Purple Moon’s Qian Mingzi. Those are the few most likely to reach Great Emperor levels,” Emperor Bai laughed.

Jian Wushuang nodded, and began to take a close look at the list.

As he scrolled through the names, he recognised many of them, some of which he had even fought against in the past. But there were other names he had never heard of before.

“Hmm?” Jian Wushuang’s gaze locked onto one name.
