Chapter 5457 ¬†A Suitable Treasure Land

It was possible that Zhen Ling probably had the same idea. If he really wanted to find a few peak-level tier 6 Emperors to take him to the Grave God Mountain, that would be truly embarrassing. Even if he went, he wouldn't receive the best cultivation.

He had to rely on himself.

Next, he had to stay in this place for some time.

The current Elder Palace had undergone significant changes, and he needed to consult with Qiuhuang.

Returning to the teleportation hall, Gong Miaoyi was still waiting there for him.

"You wait here for a while; I'm going to visit a senior!" Jian Wushuang said as he entered the hall.

Gong Miaoyi's plan was simple: establish a foothold in the Heavenly Realm with Jian Wushuang's help and then search for her father.

With her current strength as a peak-level tier 5 Emperor, activating the power of her bloodline to search in the Heavenly Realm was not like finding a needle in a haystack. The causal connection between bloodlines was rich, and finding it was only a matter of time.

The condition was that she had to be in the Heavenly Realm.

In the Earth Realm, even if she were stronger, she couldn't sense the causal connection of bloodlines.

Jian Wushuang understood her thoughts and didn't object. Since she was following him, he couldn't let her be idle.

The breakthrough in the Sword Dao might just be on Gong Miaoyi.

Upon entering the teleportation hall, Qiuhuang's law body was sitting on the throne, eyes closed.

"Senior Qiuhuang!" Jian Wushuang respectfully greeted.

Qiuhuang slightly opened his eyes and calmly said, "Have you met Lord Lu Hua?"

"How did you know it was Lord Lu Hua?" Jian Wushuang was puzzled. He knew there were several Palace Masters in the Elder Palace, so how did Qiuhuang know who he had met?

After a moment of thought, Jian Wushuang understood. Findd new ùíîtories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Qiuhuang also grasped his guess and didn't avoid it, saying, "There are only a few people in the Elder Palace. Even a fart reveals its scent. What's there to hide?"

In the Four Great Secret Realms, one of the top two super forces dismissed by Qiuhuang as worthless, Jian Wushuang couldn't help but feel that Qiuhuang was being arrogant.

If the old man with goat horns had been arrogant, Jian Wushuang could understand.

He was a rare talent even in ancient times, and now he had reached tier 6. It would be normal for him to be a bit arrogant.

But Qiuhuang was still a tier 5 Emperor, holding a position in the Elder Palace.

To put it bluntly, he was just a gatekeeper. How could he be so arrogant?

Seemingly sensing Jian Wushuang's thoughts, Qiuhuang chuckled, "Hehe, little guy, don't underestimate me. Do you know that I control all the teleportation arrays in the entire Northern Territory?"

The entire Northern Territory?

Jian Wushuang was startled. It seemed that Qiuhuang's position was more special and powerful than he had imagined.

Being in charge of all the teleportation arrays in the Northern Territory meant a considerable amount of influence. Many would covet such a position, and Qiuhuang's ability to hold this position indicated significant backing.

"Junior is ignorant!" Jian Wushuang said.

Qiuhuang gave him a disdainful look but continued, "Your ignorance is forgivable. We old guys are nearing the end of our journey. We only contend for resources; otherwise, life becomes meaningless!"

This statement made sense. An Emperor without desires or pursuits was likely on the brink of death. Mental breakdown was inevitable.

"Anyway, let's not talk about this. What plans do you have coming to the Heavenly Realm this time?" Qiuhuang changed the topic, curious about why Jian Wushuang had appeared in the Heavenly Realm as many inheritors were currently exploring the Earth Realm for opportunities.

The Heavenly Realm remained unchanged, with rebellions in various places handled by strong figures from the Elder Palace and the White Tiger Temple.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand, placing a list of items in front of Qiuhuang. Then, he sat down opposite him and said without reservation, "Let's drink and talk. This wine was brought specifically for you from the Earth Realm."

In truth, he didn't know where the alcohol on the list came from, having confiscated it from an unfortunate Emperor. But its value was high, at least in the hundreds of millions, something an ordinary tier 5 Emperor wouldn't dare to spend.

Qiuhuang rolled up his sleeves, accepted the drink poured by Jian Wushuang, and frowned after sniffing it, "Kid, it seems like you've been doing just okay these years!"

With that, he took out an ordinary jug from his mustard seed, then uncorked it, and a fierce flame of Origin Source gushed out.

The pressure from that aura even made Jian Wushuang feel uneasy.

A flame-infused liquor was something Jian Wushuang had never encountered before.

"Try this Fire Fruit Wine!" Qiuhuang pointed.

Jian Wushuang didn't hesitate, poured a cup, took a small sip, and felt a tingling sensation in his mouth.

Just one sip made him feel a bit dizzy.

Seeing this, Qiuhuang grinned and said, "Haha, this Fire Fruit Wine has quite a kick, doesn't it?"

"How is this brewed?" Jian Wushuang wiped his mouth.

"Tsk tsk, it was refined by that guy with three eyes on the sheep. He distributed it to several Hall Masters back then. This was a gift from one of them. Its value can rival an Eternal Treasure!" Qiuhuang seemed proud. Despite his low position, his unique role allowed him to gain favor even from Hall Masters.

Jian Wushuang was completely dumbfounded.

A jug of wine comparable to an Eternal Treasure ‚Äì was this even reasonable?

Now, he fully understood Wu Zuo.

Was this the privilege of big shots?

A jug of wine could be equivalent to an Eternal Treasure.

During the conversation, he began to sense that after just that small sip, the flame of Origin Source slowly rose and then erupted. With just that sip, his Flame Origin had increased significantly, faster than when he was imitating on the Transformation Dao steps.

Transformation Dao, 7,462 steps. The arrival was the flame Origin Source. After his imitation, the flame Origin Source had increased quite a bit. But even then, it was not as much as the sip of wine he just had.

If the Transformation Dao King among the Three Kings knew, he would probably curse Qiuhuang as a prodigal son.

No! The entire upper echelon of the Elder Palace were prodigals.

Too extravagant.

No wonder they were disdainful of the wine he presented. It made him feel a bit embarrassed to have Qiuhuang spend so much while seeking guidance.

"Come on, stop staring, drink and chat!" Qiuhuang waved off any concerns.

Although the wine was exceptional, it hadn't reached the point where it made him regretful.

Jian Wushuang quickly poured a cup for Qiuhuang.

After the two clinked glasses, they began to speak slowly. "This time in the Heavenly Realm, we may have to stay for a long time. Prepare for the Dao Merge!"

"Dao Merge?" Qiuhuang paused, surprised. "For matters like the integration of the Dao, shouldn't you go to the Grave God Mountain?"

This statement hit Jian Wushuang's sore spot. He also wanted to go to Grave God Mountain, but he couldn't return!

After downing another cup of wine, Jian Wushuang vaguely replied, "Not going back. I'll return after the integration of the Dao."

Qiuhuang's eyes turned, as if he understood something, and he didn't inquire further.

"Then you should stay at the Elder Palace for cultivation. It's not bad here, and with your current strength, the Dao Merge shouldn't be difficult!" Qiuhuang changed the subject and comforted him.

Seizing the opportunity, Jian Wushuang asked, "The Elder Palace has indeed undergone many changes since the last time I came. I just don't know where the changes occurred. Are there any places suitable for a Dao Lord like me to cultivate?"
