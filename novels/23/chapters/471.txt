Chapter 472: Blood Sword Lord

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Gentlemen.”

Misty Heart Lord looked at the generals and spoke. “This is your new lord, Swordsman!”

On hearing this, the generals all had an odd expression.

“He is really the new lord.”

“You let a Saint Realm expert be our lord?”

“Swordsman? I have just come back from the Flaming Battlefield. I’ve heard of him. He killed a Heaven-defying Level expert, Deng Huo. Though he is powerful with amazing skills, he is just a Saint Realm expert.”

“I heard that several days ago, two camps lost numerous lords in the exploration of the cave mansion. Doesn’t our camp have any other lords? So they perfunctorily sent a Saint Realm expert here?”

The generals were discontented with the new lord.

They only knew about their new lord’s previous battle results of killing Deng Huo, so they were surely dissatisfied with him. If they had witnessed their new lord’s performance in the Puppet Master Cave Mansion, they would have changed their opinions.

However, now they all thought that a Heaven-defying Level expert was not qualified to be a lord.

Jian Wushuang and Misty Heart Lord knew what they were thinking from their facial expressions.

Misty Heart Lord smiled while looking at Jian Wushuang. The young man remained silent, but emanated overwhelming killing intent. Then a Blood River directly swept out.

Road to the Underworld, Hundredfold Realm, and Blood Fire Domain were pulled together and surged forward.

Suppressed by his powerful realm, those generals instantly fell down one by one. They tried to resist, but they could not stand up.

They were all terrified.

“Swordsman, this is your Realm Technique? It’s amazing!” Misty Heart Lord acclaimed.

Jian Wushuang gave a faint smile.

If he exerted his full strength, his Realm Technique could suppress 30 percent of the strength of an advanced lord. It was no wonder that these experts at Stage Two or Three were not even able to struggle for a second under his attack.

Jian Wushuang slowly stretched out his hand and pointed to the generals who were kneeling in the Blood River.

Just then, an immaterial wave spread out around them. Suddenly, those generals turned pale and felt as if they were suffering from Qi Deviation.

“I pay my respects to my lord!”

“I pay my respects to my lord!”

All the generals shouted out in terror.

The suppression was terrifying indeed!

Facing such realm suppression, the generals were unable to resist, which meant their new lord’s strength was far superior to a Saint Realm expert’s. Even their previous lord did not have such strength.

They immediately realized that the young man’s battle strength might be superior to an ordinary lord.

Therefore, they submitted to him.

Jian Wushuang nodded and waved his hand. Then the mighty Blood River dissipated and the generals all became relieved.

“Stand up,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

All the generals stood up and looked in awe at Jian Wushuang.

His methods had thoroughly subdued them.

“Fools!”

Misty Heart Lord, who had been watching all of this, said with a smile, “Because our camp has appointed Swordsman as your lord, we must have acknowledged his strength. Our camp has affirmed that he is qualified to be a lord, so why did you have any doubts?”

On hearing this, all the generals could not help lowering their heads.

“Fine.” Misty Heart Lord shook her head and looked at Jian Wushuang. “Swordsman... uh, no... I should call you Blood Sword Lord. From now on, you’re in charge of the Blood Sword Territory. Since I’ve finished my job, I shall leave now.”

“Thanks, Misty Heart Lord,” Jian Wushuang said while cupping his fist.

Soon afterward, Misty Heart Lord left.

Jian Wushuang looked at the group of generals, pointed to the most powerful one, and asked, “What’s your name?”

“Lord, I’m Bing Huo,” the man replied immediately.

“OK, aside from you, the rest of the people can go.” Jian Wushuang waved his hands. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The other generals bowed and left.

“I’ve just arrived here, so I am not clear about the business of the Blood Sword Territory. Tell me about it,” Jian Wushuang said while staring at Bing Huo.

“OK.” Bing Huo nodded.

The whole setup in the Blood Sword Territory was similar to that in the Iron Saber Territory, and there were many families there.

Usually, nothing special happened there.

Therefore, Blood Sword Lord and the Blood Sword Army had a lot of free time.

“Lord, only the Dragon Blood Gem Mine needs your attention in our territory,” Bing Huo said.

“The Dragon Blood Gem Mine?” Jian Wushuang was a bit surprised.

He knew that the Dragon Blood Gem was a high-level gem, which was used for refining magic weapons. A complete Dragon Blood Gem Mine was valuable enough to attract the attention?of ordinary lords.

Bing Huo began to explain the reason why.

“Lord, a year ago, we found a Dragon Blood Gem Mine in our territory and took it, but Magic Flame Lord heard about it.

“Magic Flame Lord is an intermediate lord, who acts in a tyrannical manner. He thought he was powerful, so he wanted to step in. Our previous lord was a novice and unable to fight against him, so he could only compromise.

“During this year, our Blood Sword Territory and the Magic Flame Territory have shared the Dragon Blood Gems 50/50.”

On hearing this, Jian Wushuang wore an odd expression.

“We found a Blood Gem Mine in our territory and instantly took it, but the Magic Flame Territory suddenly stepped in and grabbed 50 percent of the gems. This is...” Jian Wushuang shook his head, but he understood.

In this world, those who had power were respected.

If he had not shown his strength to shock the generals, they would not have submitted to him.
