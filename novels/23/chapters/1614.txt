Chapter 1615: Nine Great King Cities

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Amidst the sky of endless darkness, an airship from the outside world was moving at an amazing speed.

Jian Wushuang was within the airship, closed off from the outside world.

What he needed to do was to get into the wormhole at the Sorrowful Region. As for the other matters… he believed that Hall Master Yuan had made preparations for him already.

Tens of years later, he passed by a region known as the Heaven Moon Milky Way. The region was the only way for him to get to the Sorrowful Region.

However, at that very moment, there were a few blood-robed men gathered in the void somewhere in the Heaven Moon Milky Way.

“Target locked on. We can strike at any moment,” one of the blood-robed men said softly.

“There is no need to rush,” a dark old man with almond-shaped eyes in the crowd shook his head, “Give me some time.”

After that, the dark old man with almond-shaped eyes closed his eyes. The remaining blood-robed men waited quietly and no one was suspicious of the dark old man in the slightest.

After some time, the dark old man opened his eyes fiercely and his eyes were filled with coldness, “Retreat immediately!”

As soon as the words left his mouth, the dark old man and the blood-robed men beside him changed into crimson light and flew in all directions. In the blink of an eye, all of them disappeared completely.

Not long after those people left, swoosh!

A black-armored, big man, who was carrying a thick, heavy and huge saber had appeared at the void. Moreover, his icy-cold eyes were scanning the surroundings.

“Hmph, this group of rascals is really fast at running!”

The big man gave a cold hum. After that, with a change of his body, he disappeared from his location.

Jian Wushuang was clueless about what had transpired at that location. He merely continued to head toward the Sorrowful Region and his trip was a smooth one with no hindrances.

After ninety years, he arrived at the Sorrowful Region. With the aid of the wormhole within the Sorrowful Region, he set off toward the Ancient God Sanctuary.

…

The Ancient God Sanctuary was one of the four Sanctuaries that were occupied by special clans.

Similarly, the Ancient God Sanctuary was a vast piece of land. However, it was still different from the human cultivators’ ten Sanctuaries as the Ancient God Sanctuary was not split into different lands.

“This is the Ancient God Sanctuary?”

Jian Wushuang set foot on the ground of the Ancient God Sanctuary. His eyes were observing the surroundings so that he could feel the environment around him.

He could feel that the training environment in the Ancient God Sanctuary was not any different from the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries.

“There are two people within the detecting range of my Soul Power as of the very moment. However, I am unable to feel the aura of the Bloodline of the Ancient God from them. Could it be that they are people from other clans?” Jian Wushuang said surprisingly.

“In the Ancient God Sanctuary, even though the Ancient Gods are the Masters, there are also many other special clans present. Among the special clans, some of them have formed tribes, while some of them have survived by affiliating themselves with the Ancient Gods. Comparing numbers, there are a lot more of the special clans compared to the Ancient Gods,” the King of Venomous Worms’ voice echoed in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood.

“In the Ancient God Sanctuary, some of the Ancient Gods will also survive in a tribe of their own. However, there are even more Ancient Gods that are gathered in the Nine Great King Cities. The Nine Great King Cities can be said to the nine strongest powerhouses of the Ancient God Sanctuary,” the King of Venomous Worms said.

“The nine strongest powerhouses? In other words, the Ancient God Clan is not a completely unified clan?” Jian Wushuang asked with astonishment.

“That’s right,” the King of Venomous Worms said, “A long time ago, that is, an unknown number of years ago, during the most ancient period of time, there was an Ancient God Emperor within the Ancient God Clan and he possessed the supreme Bloodline of Emperors, as well as extremely powerful abilities. That time, the Ancient God Clan had him as their leader and it was indeed a complete clan. However, ever since the Ancient God Emperor disappeared or after he died, the Ancient God clan divided and became the Nine Great King Cities.”

“The Nine Great King Cities has always been ruled by the Royal Ancient God Clan, which stood at the top of the Ancient God Clan. For example, my previous Master King Luo Zhen was an Eight-star Royal Ancient God and he definitely stood at the top of the pyramid of the Ancient God Clan. As such, he occupied a Great King City. Moreover, he also had a few Seven-star Ancient Gods and many Six-star Gods under him.”

“However, after King Luo Zhen fell, his King City was naturally occupied by other Royal Ancient Gods.”

“King of Venomous Worms, the Seven-star Ancient God of the Ancient God Clan is already at the level of an Almighty, right?” Jian Wushuang questioned abruptly.

“Yes, he’s an Almighty. However, when compared to the human being’s Sanctuary, he is just a normal Almighty who is at a level similar to that of the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain. As for Eight-star Ancient Gods, they are of the same level as the founder of the Lineage of Star,” the King of Venomous Worms said.

“In other words, a Great King City of the Ancient God Sanctuary has a few normal Almighties as well as an Eight-star Ancient God who is comparable to the Star Palace Master?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

“That’s right,” the King of Venomous Worms nodded its head.

“Gosh. One King City is already like this. If it were Nine Great King Cities and the Ancient God Clan becomes unified and comes together, how powerful would they be?” Jian Wushuang could not help but think about it.

“At the very least, they would be more powerful than a Sanctuary of the human beings,” the King of Venomous Worms said bluntly.

“That’s highly possible,” Jian Wushuang was speechless, “Oh right. If the Eight-star Ancient Gods within the Ancient God Clan is at the level of the Star Palace Master, then how about… Nine-star Ancient Gods? Is the Ancient God Emperor who unified the Ancient God Clan as one a Nine-star Ancient God?”

“Nine-star Ancient Gods…” the King of Venomous Worms remained silent for some time. He then said, “Nine-star Ancients Gods are of the Emperor-level in human beings’ terms. However, Ancient Gods of such a level are extremely rare. From what I know, in the history of the Ancient God Clan, only two Nine-star Ancient Gods have appeared before. One of them perished during a great battle. As for the remaining one, I am also not very sure if he is still in the Ancient God Clan.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“As for the Ancient God Emperor, it is said that… he is a Ten-star Ancient God!”

“Ten-star?” Jian Wushuang opened his eyes wide.

Nine-star Ancient Gods were equivalent to that of Emperor-level human cultivators. As for Emperors, they were the Masters of the Sanctuaries, as well as the greatest existences of the Sanctuary Alliance.

Hence, Ten-stars must definitely be above Emperors. What kind of level was that?

“Of course, Ten-stars are merely a legend and I myself have no idea whether it was really achieved. In the whole Ancient God Clan, there are probably very few people who know about this. After all, the Ancient God Emperor’s generation was from an extremely long time ago,” the King of Venomous Worms said.

Jian Wushuang shrugged his shoulders.

“Jian Wushuang, you should first ask the two people who belong to a special clan to find out where we are now,” the King of Venomous Worms said.

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head. After that, he headed in the direction of the two auras which were within the detecting range of his Soul Power.

In the vast sky, two shadows were flying toward the front slowly.

The two people had huge physiques and they were over two meters hall. Moreover, their skins were dark red in color and there was also a horn on their foreheads. As such, it was obvious that they were from the same clan.

Swoosh!

All of a sudden, Jian Wushuang appeared in front of the two of them.

“Eh?”

The two dark red-skinned, horned men became vigilant at once.

“No need to panic. I only wish to ask both of you for directions,” Jian Wushuang laughed indifferently.
