2043 Double Agent?

Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao became quiet when they heard Jian Wushuang’s reply, but they weren’t surprised.

Jian Wushuang had survived because of his unique ability as an inverse cultivator. On the other hand, Great Emperor Zhi Luo didn’t have the ability.

“Regardless, it is great news that you survived. I have to report to Sanctuary Alliance about this,” Emperor Jiu Qiao said.

“Don’t be in a hurry,” Jian Wushuang cut him off.

“Why?” Emperor Jiu Qiao was confused.

“Don’t spread the news about me being alive. Only you and Abysmal Saint Master know about this,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Sword Emperor, you mean…” Emperor Jiu Qiao was initially stunned but he quickly responded.

Abysmal Saint Master squinted his eyes and said, “Jian Wushuang, you mean that there is a double agent from Holocaust Sect or Acheron Palace in Sanctuary Alliance?”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded, “Didn’t you suspect this?”

Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao looked distressed.

As Great Emperors, they had to be intelligent. Before Jian Wushuang had pointed it out, they had had the suspicion.

One should know that they were well prepared thirty years ago. They had found the correct time to take action and Jian Wushuang’s disguise had been perfect all the time.

In a normal situation, it would have been impossible for the Great Emperors in Three-Emperor World to know that Jian Wushuang had been into Imperial Peak. Let alone the fact that they’d set up a trap for Jian Wushuang to be in.

In actual fact, not only had the Great Emperors from Three-Emperors World known that they were in Imperial Peak long ago, but they had also been certain that they would take action during the Doctrine Propagation Ceremony.

Not long after they’d arrived in Three-Emperors World, there had been six Great Emperors that found and besieged them.

They were almost certain that they had been tracked by the experts in Three Emperors World all the time.

How were they tracked? Naturally, there was people who had shared their information.

“Our mission isn’t publicized in Sanctuary Alliance, only the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance know. In other words, could there be a double agent among the Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance?” Abysmal Saint Master creased his eyebrows.

Any Great Emperor expert would be one of the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance.

If there was a double agent among the Great Emperors, the person was well hidden. He was very skilled.

“We still can’t determine if there was a double agent among the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance. But to be safe, we will not share our action plan. Emperor Jiu Qiao, if you do?report in, you can only tell Emperor Bai that I am alive,” Jian Wushuang exhorted.

“I understand,” Emperor Jiu Qiao nodded.

Among the Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance, Emperor Bai definitely couldn’t be a double agent. There was no doubt about it.

Because if Emperor Bai was a double agent, Eternal Chaotic World didn’t stand a chance to survive.

As for the others, anyone was possible.

Including Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao… Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao gave their all after they entered Three-Emperors World and Jian Wushuang had witnessed their effort with his own eyes. Although the possibility of one of them being a double agent was extremely low, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t send them any message immediately after he reorganized his divine body, just to be safe.

After all, if either Emperor Jiu Qiao or Abysmal Saint Master was a double agent, they would immediately inform the Great Emperors in Three-Emperors World. By then, Jian Wushuang would definitely be doomed.

After his power increased tremendously and he was confident enough to deal with all possible outcomes, he would then send a message to Emperor Jiu Qiao.

In the lofty palace in the void near the dark millstone in Eternal Chaotic World.

“As expected, he didn’t die.”

Emperor Bai sat there when he received a message from Emperor Jiu Qiao’s doppelg?nger. His eyes beamed with joy but he wasn’t too surprised.

He had already been wondering if Jian Wushuang had really died thirty years ago. Now, it seemed that he really hadn’t.

“Mister Emperor Bai, Sword Emperor requested me to share a message with you. He wants you to not share the news that he is alive with the others. Besides, he is preparing to take action against the Emperor Supreme Rock again and he has already drawn up a plan. However, he would need Emperor Bai to give full cooperation,” Emperor Jiu Qiao’s doppelg?nger sent a message and shared Jian Wushuang’s plan briefly.

Emperor Bai heard and nodded, “The plan is great. Not only could he escape, but he could also certify whether there is any double agent among the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance. However, there is a prerequisite for the plan, which is for him to walk out of Imperial Peak alive.”

“Jiu Qiao, you tell him that I will fully collaborate with him but he has to be extremely careful.”

“Yes,” Emperor Jiu Qiao nodded.

In the huge golden whirlpool in Imperial Peak, Jian Wushuang received Emperor Bai’s reply through Emperor Jiu Qiao. Then, he prepared to take action.

He let out a breath, then his gaze fixed upon the golden prohibition in front of him.

The golden prohibition was a great opportunity for him.

In only thirty years’ time, he had broken through and reached the second stage via the golden prohibition.

If he continued to stay in the golden prohibition, his divine body could continue to improve and he could reach the peak of the second stage. He might even reach the third stage, which was the ultimate stage in the seventh step of inverse cultivation.

However, the time required for him to reach the third stage would be too long.

He had spent thirty years to get from the first stage to the second stage. However, it would take at least three hundred years to get from the second stage to the third stage, or even longer than that.

Although a few hundred years or even a few thousand years didn’t mean much to him.

He could afford to wait, but Eternal Chaotic World couldn’t.

One should know that the dark millstone swept over and crushed everything over the years. Holy Kingdoms vanished one after another.

If the dark millstone continued to revolve for another three hundred years, it would definitely reach a terrifying level. By then, when Jian Wushuang would destroy the Emperor Supreme Rock, and Eternal Chaotic World would be about to be destroyed then as well.

Hence, he couldn’t wait any longer. He had to take action immediately to stop the dark millstone.

“The golden prohibition was the pivotal role to obtain the pure energy from the Emperor Supreme Rock. Destroy it first,” Jian Wushuang muttered and Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand.

There was a bolt of sword intention that soared up from Jian Wushuang’s body.

At the same time, his divine power, which was a few times stronger than thirty years ago, soared too.

Jian Wushuang strengthened his grip and swung with his Blood Mountain Sword.

A move like strong wind, with the momentum of rainstorm.

It was the move that focused on power the most from Sword Principle Xuan Luo, Blast Rainstorm!

Hong!

A terrifying sword light suddenly appeared in the middle of the golden whirlpool. Then, it instantly slashed at the golden whirlpool brutally.

The power of the golden prohibition was extraordinary. The golden prohibition could resist any ordinary Great Emperor attack. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

But then, just as Jian Wushuang struck…

Crash.

The golden prohibition was broken into two from the middle.
