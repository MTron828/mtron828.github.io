Chapter 4079: No Injuries?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“So powerful!”

The hearts of many experts from Thunder God Palace, including the First Elder of Thunder God Palace and Blood Thunder General, twitched when they saw that Jian Wushuang was instantly cut into the ground below.

He was indeed terrifyingly powerful.

After all, the First Elder of Thunder God Palace and Blood Thunder General could not do anything to Jian Wushuang when they joined hands just now.

However, the Thunder God Palace Master had completely crushed Jian Wushuang with only one blow.

!!

At the same time, the supreme Ruler, the Thunder God Palace Master, was more powerful than the First Elder of the Thunder God Palace and the Blood Thunder General.

“Is the Ruler called Blood Sword dead?”

“Such a terrible blow directly hit his divine body. He is only a third-level Ruler. Even if he doesn’t die, I’m afraid he won’t have a good ending.”

“Tell him to come to my Thunder God Palace to provoke us. In my opinion, he’s dead for sure.”

Many cultivators of the Thunder God Palace began to discuss among themselves. They all looked down at the pit in the ground.

Suddenly…whoosh!

A bolt of lightning shot out from the pit and appeared in the void in the blink of an eye.

“Haha, as expected of Thunder God Palace Master. His strength is much stronger than that of other Ultimate Rulers.” A hearty laughter echoed in the world.

Seeing Jian Wushuang reappear in the void, and sensing that his aura was not weakened at all, the experts of Thunder God Palace were stunned.

“How could it be?”

“It’s fine that he’s not dead, but why is he still alive and kicking?”

“His aura is not weakened at all? Could it be that the axe just now did not hurt him?”

The experts of Thunder God Palace widened their eyes in disbelief.

“This is impossible!” The First Elder of Thunder God Palace and the Blood Thunder General shouted at the same time.

They were both Ultimate Rulers with the protection of lower-grade principle true treasure armors. However, even they would be injured by the axe of Thunder God Palace Master.

As for Jian Wushuang, although his battle strength was not much weaker than theirs, he was only a third-level Ruler?

A third-level Ruler should not be able to protect his body as well as theirs, right?

How could he take the blow and still be unharmed?

“This kid…” Palace Master Thor narrowed his eyes slightly.

In fact, he was as shocked as the First Elder of Thunder God Palace and the Chief of Blood Thunder Army. However, Jian Wushuang did not seem to be injured when he reappeared in front of him.

“Could it be that this kid has some special treasures, such as some powerful and heaven-defying elixirs, that can heal his injuries in an instant?” Thunder God Palace Master could not help but think, but his expression soon recovered, “I’d like to see if you really have such a great ability.”

Thunder God Palace Master attacked again and raised the giant axe in his hand. However, the moment he raised the giant axe this time, the momentum was even greater.

The destructive aura condensed in the giant axe was even stronger.

“Humph!”

As Thunder God Palace Master snorted, the giant axe in his hand hacked down again.

The same axe, which used force to suppress people, was not fancy, but more powerful and powerful.

The mighty shadow of the axe once again arrived in front of Jian Wushuang.

However, this time, Jian Wushuang did not intend to use the sword skill of the first move of heaven to fight head-on. Instead, he directly activated the sword formation.

Buzz! A special energy fluctuation spread out.

Streams of special sword essence surged crazily, forming layers of tough sword domains.

In a short while, Jian Wushuang had condensed nearly 100 earth sword domains in front of him. Moreover, these earth sword domains were perfectly combined in a special way, forming a huge and complete sword formation of earth protection! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

It was Jian Wushuang’s most powerful protective move, the Earth Guardian Sword Formation!

As Jian Wushuang’s use of the universal principles continued to improve, and with the perfect combination of sword principle, the power of this sword formation was much stronger than before.

This sword formation was definitely Jian Wushuang’s most powerful protective move.

Boom!

The Axe Shadow with astonishing power finally arrived in front of Jian Wushuang and directly hit the Earth Guardian Sword Formation.

The entire Earth Guardian Sword Formation began to tremble crazily at this moment. Layer after layer of the Emperor Sword realm was destroyed one after another.

In the blink of an eye, more than half of the Earth Guardian Sword Formation was destroyed, but the giant axe was still extremely powerful and continued to attack.

Finally, all the Earth Sword Realms in the Earth Guardian Sword Formation were destroyed. The Earth Guardian Sword Formation was split open by the Axe Shadow.

“My Earth Guardian Sword Formation was defeated?” Jian Wushuang secretly clicked his tongue, but he was not surprised.

After all, he was an ultimate dominator at the top level, and he had used his ultimate move. It was normal for him to break through the Earth Guardian Sword Formation.

However, after the axe shadow destroyed the Earth Guardian Sword Formation, more than half of its power had been consumed. Although the remaining power continued to pass through, it was weakened by the armor of the principle-type supreme treasure on Jian Wushuang’s body, not much of it had actually passed through Jian Wushuang’s divine body.

Jian Wushuang’s divine body was also comparable to an inferior-grade principle supreme treasure, so it was not a big deal for him to take the attack head-on.

On the surface, after taking the attack, Jian Wushuang was only knocked back a relatively long distance before he regained his balance.

Jian Wushuang still had a smile on his face, “Thunder God Palace Master, was that your strongest attack?

“If that’s all you’ve got, I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed today. With such little strength, you won’t even be able to hurt me, let alone kill me.”

Although Jian Wushuang’s words sounded arrogant, he was telling the truth.

Thunder God Palace Master’s attack could not hurt him.

The experts of Thunder God Palace were completely stunned.

“He, he is really not injured?”

“He took Palace Master’s axe head-on like nothing happened? His aura did not weaken at all!”

“Where did this Blood Sword come from?!”

Not only the experts of Thunder God Palace, but also the three Ultimate Rulers of Thunder God Palace.

Thunder God Palace Master, the First Elder of Thunder God Palace, and Blood Thunder General Ruler all looked extremely gloomy.

Especially Thunder God Palace Master.

If it was the first axe, Thunder God Palace Master suspected that Jian Wushuang was just putting on an act, or that he had been seriously injured and only recovered the instant elixir or special treasure.

However, he had clearly seen the whole process of the second axe. There was no such thing as putting on an act or swallowing a treasure to recover divine power.

Jian Wushuang took his axe head-on, but he was not injured at all!
