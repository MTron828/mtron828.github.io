Chapter 1309: Defense Secret Skills!

“Snow dojo?” Jian Wushuang was quite interested.

He had heard of this place, knowing that it was a camp for the geniuses of Snow Kingdom in which there were far more geniuses than Dayu Universe.

“The Snow Kingdom is quite large, and Snow Dojo is also a good place for you now, though it isn’t as good as the Lineage of Stars.” The King of Venomous Worms said in Jian Wushuang’s heart.

“I know, but I should consider it after I finish my Inverse Cultivation Test.” Jian Wushuang said solemnly.

And soon he left.

And the people also left.

And the battle came to an end.

Jian Wushuang defeated and killed Qingyang Universe God, which was unexpected by the crowd at the beginning.

However, the topic that people talked about after the battle was not that Qingyang Universe God was killed by Jian Wushuang, but that Jian Wushuang would go through his God test in one hundred and twenty years.

Everyone was very curious about how powerful the God test could be with such an astonishing Omen.

Could Jian Wushuang pass his God test in one hundred and twenty years?

…

Jian Wushuang sat alone in the secret room, with the Little Scattered Stars Game in his front.

The King of Venomous Worms, within the body of Jian Wushuang, said to him, “The Inverse Cultivation Test is the same as God test, in which defense abilities and life-saving skills are even more important than the swordsmanship itself. So in the next one hundred and twenty years you should seek to improve different abilities rather than only polishing your swordsmanship.”

“I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded, “Before focusing on the Little Scattered Stars Game, I will first improve my defense ability and life-saving skills! And the first step to develop defense ability is to cultivate defense secret skills.”

Actually, Jian Wushuang had cultivated a kind of defense secret skill.

That was the Golden Secret Skill from Green Fire Palace.

Green Fire Palace, serving as a huge battlefield and a large treasure deposit, owned many secret skills with high levels, including the Gold Secret Skill, which was enough for universe gods in the First Heaven and the Second Heaven.

The Gold Secret Skill was divided into three parts.

Only cultivating practitioners above Tianzun were qualified to practice the first part.

As for the second part, only universe gods in the First Heaven were qualified.

Jian Wushuang had only finished the first part.

Now, in order to improve his defense ability of the body, it was imperative for him to practice the second part.

“Actually I have tried to cultivate the second part for several times but failed. Now, although I have developed my overall strength a lot, my magical power hasn’t improved enough. I think it would be quite difficult for me to achieve that goal.”

“Yep, quite difficult for you currently, but if you can get some natural treasures and a Sacred Bone Elixir, and then combine them with your magic power, you can probably finish the second part.” said the King of Venomous Worms.

“Sacred Bone Elixir?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“That is a kind of elixir that forcibly enhances the magic power in a short time. If used properly, it can help you cultivate the second part of the Gold Secret Skills.” the King of Venomous Worms smiled, “As the guest of Dayu Palace, why not use the resources here? You can ask members of the palace for Sacred Bone Elixirs or ask them to find some for you if there aren’t here.”

“Precious as it is, the elixir isn’t difficult to find in such a big and powerful Dayu Palace.”

“Well, let me ask them right now.” Jian Wushuang immediately sent a message to White Sector God.

And White Sector God replied soon.

There were more than one Sacred Bone Elixirs right here in the palace.

White Sector God immediately asked his subordinates to send two Sacred Bone Elixirs to Jian Wushuang, who also paid numerous Chaotic Crystals.

With Sacred Bone Elixirs in hand, Jian Wushuang started to cultivate the Gold Secret Skill under the guidance of the King of Venomous Worms.

The cultivation took three years.

After three years, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes in the secret room, with his body shaking and producing a cracking sound.

“Done!”

Jian Wushuang was extremely excited.

With the help of Sacred Bone Elixirs and the guidance of the King of Venomous Worms, Jian Wushaung spent three years completing the second part of the Gold Secret Skill.

Thanks to the cultivation, Jian Wushuang’s already incomparable magic power soared again and reached a new level.

“I feel that my current magic power is at least ten times stronger than before!” Jian Wushuang said.

His former power was equal to a ordinary Universe God in the First Heaven, and now, he was powerful enough to easily match a Peak Universe God in the First Heaven!

It was incredible for a Universe God to make such achievements.

What’s more, the most powerful skills that Jian Wushuang had was not magic power but the Blood-killing Plate Armor!

The Blood-killing Plate Armor shared a great reputation in the Eternal Chaotic World, because it could weaken the power of a Universe God by 90%.

With the Blood-killing Plate Armor, plus his soaring magic power as well as his defense ability, Jian Wushuang was definitely able to compete with average Universe Gods in the Second Heaven!

However, what Jian Wushuang was facing was the Inverse Cultivation Test.

The most terrible God test in the Eternal Chaotic World Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Jian Wushuang believed that his current defense ability was not yet enough for him to get through the test.

So he went to the treasure deposit of Dayu Palace.

He wanted to pick a suitable defense treasure, just like the black turtle shell that Dong Men Universe God had used in his God test.

The black turtle shell was a very powerful defense treasure, which Dong Men Universe God relied on to resist the second Sacred Thunder. Unfortunately, that thunder also carried a trace of Fire Test, which resulted in his death.

To avoid the same situation and get through the Inverse Cultivation Test, Jian Wushuang should make full preparation. And a suitable defense treasure could help him improve the success possibility.

Finally, Jian Wushuang decided to choose a treasure called Green Bell.

Ordinary as it was, the Green Bell was more powerful than the black turtle. In order to get the bell, Jian Wushuang paid a lot.
