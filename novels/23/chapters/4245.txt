4246 Fei Hong (Part One)

Bang!

“Bang! Bang!”

In the void and chaos of the sixth level, Divine General Fei Hong and Jian Wushuang turned into two shocking sword radiances, one silver and one black. They flew around and collided with each other continuously.

The silver-winged divine sword in Divine General Fei Hong’s hand and the Wuqi Divine Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand exchanged thousands of blows in a short period of time. the vast and vigorous divine power exploded in the void.

“Split open the sky!”

“Sundering Stars!”

Jian Wushuang swiped his right hand and the Wuqi Divine Sword in his hand trembled thousands of times in an instant. The two moves of sky-opening and star slashing were executed from the Wuqi Divine Sword one after another and blasted toward Divine General Fei Hong!

“Divine might!”

“God’s wrath!”

The flying swan divine sword also shouted coldly. The divine light in the eyes that were only exposed under the silver mask suddenly increased by three inches!

A pair of silver wings appeared behind him, and the silver-winged sword in his hand was instantly covered in a thick blood-red color. A destructive power shot out from the sword in his hand, carrying a terrifying aura.

“Slash!”

At once, Divine General Fei Hong leaped high into the air. The silver-winged divine sword in his hand turned into a monstrous blood dragon that slashed down at Jian Wushuang!

Peng peng peng!

The two of them retreated at the same time, their god bodies shaking.

Jian Wushuang lowered his head and looked at his right hand. The area between his thumb and forefinger felt numb.

In the next moment, he raised his head and looked at Divine General Fei Hong with a grave look in his eyes.

This was the only person who did not lose to him in sword Dao after he came to the depths of the universe.

“Mortal, I have to admit that you have the ability to compete with gods. If you were in my era, you would be a True God of sword Dao that wasn’t weaker than me.” Divine General Fei Hong said indifferently with a solemn expression. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“You’re noisy.”

Jian Wushuang was expressionless and then he took a deep breath.

Innate divine ability, life intimidation!!

Boom!

An intimidating power from the deepest part of the soul suddenly descended on the scene. Under this power, it was as if time had fallen into a swamp and all living things had to submit to it. They knelt in front of Jian Wushuang and bowed their heads.

“This?”

Divine General Fei Hong’s expression changed instantly. Just as he was about to flare up, he felt as if millions of mountains were pressing down on him. He could not move at all and could not help but want to kneel down in front of Jian Wushuang.

“You dare to make a God submit to you?” He spat out these words with difficulty.

Jian Wushuang did not answer. Instead, his eyes flashed and he immediately charged at Divine General Fei Hong.

Whoosh!

Without any hindrance, Jian Wushuang’s Wuqi Divine Sword directly stabbed into Divine General Fei Hong’s chest. Then, a sharp sword essence burst out.

“Mortal, enjoy my Slaughter Sword Dao.”

Divine General Fei Hong looked at Jian Wushuang deeply before his divine body crumbled and he was ground into dust by the sharp sword essence.

Black lines appeared where the flying swan divine sword had disappeared and shot toward the space between Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows.

Jian Wushuang did not resist. He sat down cross-legged and slowly closed his eyes.

A loud voice resounded in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“I, Divine General Fei Hong, the divine sword in my hand was born for slaughter!”

BOOM!

In an instant, a large amount of Divine General Fei Hong’s comprehension of sword principle, mixed with his memories, was poured into Jian Wushuang’s mind.

The world in front of Jian Wushuang started to change.

It was as if he had traveled through space and time to 500 chaos cycles ago. Jian Wushuang saw a young man of seven or eight years old with delicate features. He was holding a wooden sword and dancing around at the foot of a hill.

This was the young Divine General Fei Hong.

“Memory inheritance?”

Jian Wushuang muttered to himself and then slowly closed his eyes, immersing himself in the memories that belonged to Fei Hong.

…

The sun was high in the sky, and the young man’s sweat was pouring down like rain. His white clothes were completely drenched in sweat.

However, he did not give up. His eyes were filled with determination. He gritted his teeth and kept waving the wooden sword in his hand.

Again and again, the overlapping sword shadows intertwined with each other, accompanied by the heavy breathing of the youth and the chirping of cicadas in the summer.

“I, Fei Hong, will definitely become the most powerful swordsman in the world!”

The sun gradually set, and under the afterglow of the setting sun, a young man’s childish and ambitious words could be heard.

“Xiao Fei, it’s almost time to come back and eat. Your father specially bought a big black carp from the town.”

At the bottom of the hill, smoke rose in spirals as a peasant woman carried a hoe and wiped the sweat off her forehead.

“Mother, I’m coming!”

Fei Hong quickly hid the wooden sword in his hand, grabbed the black yak, and ran down the hill.

This year, Fei Hong was eight years old.

…

Time passed quickly.

This year, Fei Hong was 19 years old.

That year, the only sect in the nearby town, the Green Mountain Sword Sect, was recruiting disciples.

Fei Hong refused his parents’ wish to send him to the capital to take the imperial examination. He asked Blacksmith Wang in the village to forge a rough and ugly iron sword for him, and then sneaked out of the village and came to the gate of the Green Mountain Sword Sect.

He was mixed in with a group of young people who had also come to learn from him, and he was a little nervous.

It was said that the people living on the Green Mountain Sword Sect were all legendary Immortals, who could ride their flying swords and ride the wind for thousands of miles. They were very powerful.

As for him, he was just a cowherd boy from a farmer’s village. He had only learned a few sword moves in a daze and was really not worthy of being on the stage.

After a long wait, it was finally the Fei Hong test’s turn!

He gathered his courage and slowly walked up under the serious gaze of the old man in charge of the assessment.

“Sword soul awakening! The body of the sword spirit!”

However, the whole Green Mountain Sect was shocked when the results of the examination were announced.

Fei Hong, who had been a cowherd boy in a farmer’s house, had become the most dazzling new star in the entire Green Mountain Sect! There was no other!

He had joined the Green Mountain Sect as a disciple of the most powerful Grand Elder, and countless resources had been poured into him.

…

Time passed by, and time was merciless.

Spring, summer, autumn, and winter kept on moving.

In the blink of an eye, ten years had passed.

The young and nervous cowherd boy had become the big brother of the Green Mountain Sect, and the most dazzling star in the entire Green Mountain Sect!

At the moment, Fei Hong was twenty-nine years old. He was high-spirited, confident, and handsome. Many pretty young girls of the Green Mountain Sect had fallen head over heels for him.

Just as he was immersed in the harmonious and peaceful life of the sect…

A change suddenly occurred!

Once, when he was out on a sect mission, he had offended the young sect master of the strongest sect in this region, the purgatory sword sect. he had been killed in anger!

In an instant, a great disaster was imminent!

The Green Mountain Sect, where he had been a disciple, had been wiped out. The kind and gentle elders of the sect, as well as the lively and playful junior sisters and brothers, had all died in front of him.

He could only watch helplessly as this happened, unable to put up any resistance.

For the first time, he realized how weak he was. He realized that he was just an insignificant ant in this world.

At last, with the help of the sect master of the Green Mountain Sect, Fei Hong managed to escape and was sent out of the Green Mountain Sect.
