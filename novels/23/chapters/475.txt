Chapter 476: A Trip to Sword-suppression Valley

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Su Ming is one of the Nine Sovereigns and a personal disciple of the Sword Ancestor?

“After the Sword Ancestor died, the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor collapsed. Countless experts, including the Sword Ancestor’s personal disciples and seven Sword Emperors, were killed.

“If Su Ming really is the Sword Ancestor’s personal disciple, how can it be impossible that he has survived?

“Unless...”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and thought of one possibility,

When he was in the Ancestor’s Land, Mu Shan mentioned a traitor of the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor.

Mu Shan said the traitor memorized all the nine moves of the Heart-killing Sword Technique. Although Mu Shan casually talked about it, Jian Wushuang still kept that in mind. Now the young man started wondering if Su Ming was the traitor.

Spirit Lord did not know what Jian Wushuang was thinking about and continued speaking.

“As the first magic weapon of the Sword Principle, the Heart-killing Sword is extremely powerful. Except for the Sword Ancestor, no one is able to control it. What’s more, the Heart-killing Sword is a Sword of Killing with a mighty killing intent. Master Su Ming could only suppress it in Sword-suppression Valley. By the way, that’s why the valley has such a name.

“The Heart-killing Sword usually remains quiet, but it shakes violently every 100 years. Even Sir Su Ming is unable to suppress it. However, when its Sword Essence sweeps out and thousands of swords salute, it will be a precious opportunity for any Sword Principle Warrior.”

“Thousands of swords salute?” Jian Wushuang asked in surprised.

“Sir Su Ming is broad-minded. He will invite many Sword Principle experts to Sword-suppression Valley before the Heart-killing Sword shakes violently. This time, Sir Su Ming also invites Sword Principle experts to this meeting,” Spirit Lord said. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Our marquis is not a Sword Principle warrior, but as a marquis, he has also received the invitation. Master Su Ming asked our marquis to recommend three Sword Principle experts. Hunjian Lord and Tanming Lord are on the list.

“And as for the last one, I recommended you to our marquis.”

Jian Wushuang finally understood why Spirit Lord had come here.

“Swordsman, would you like to go to Sword-suppression Valley?” Spirit Lord asked with a smile.

“Of course I’d like to.” Jian Wushuang nodded without hesitation.

Spirit Lord was not surprised by his reply.

It would be a great opportunity for any Sword Principle warrior to watch the Heart-killing Sword shake and see thousand of swords salute. No one would refuse it.

However, Spirit Lord did not know that the main reason Jian Wushuang accepted the invitation was that the Heart-killing Sword was the Sword Ancestor’s magic weapon and that he was a descendant of the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor.

“In that case, you can make some preparations and then go with me,” Spirit Lord said.

Jian Wushuang nodded, called Bing Huo to come in, and gave him some orders. Then, he left with Spirit Lord.

After traveling for a short while, they found themselves in front of a magnificent palace.

The moment Jian Wushuang stepped into it, he saw a young man in a long silver robe, whose eyes sparkled with magic.

“Marquis.” Both Spirit Lord and Jian Wushuang simultaneously addressed the young man.

The silver-robed young man looked at Jian Wushuang and asked, “Are you Swordsman? Spirit Lord often talks about you. Our camp has many lords, but a Saint Realm expert can actually become a lord, and you’re the only one.”

“Spirit Lord has overestimated me,” Jian Wushuang replied with modesty.

Marquis Piaoxue did not respond to this but simply waved his hands while saying, “Sit down please.”

Jian Wushuang sat by a long narrow table and immediately greeted the two lords beside him. “Hunjian Lord. Tianming Lord.”

In a polite manner, Hujian Lord and Tianming Lord, who had been awaiting his arrival, looked over at him and replied in succession, “Blood Sword Lord.”

Then, Marquis Piaoxue spoke again.

“You should have heard about this already. Master Su Ming sent me the invitation personally, so I don’t dare to take it lightly. The three of you are the strongest Sword Principle experts in our camp, so don’t make me lose face.”

“We’ll do our best,” Jian Wushuang and the other two lords responded.

“Alright.”

Marquis Piaoxue nodded, took out a token, and gave it to Hunjian Lord. “In half a month, Sword-suppression Valley will open. You should set out as soon as possible.”

Jian Wushuang and the other two lords looked at each other, bowed, and left.

After they left the palace, the three lords got together.

“Hunjian Lord, you have been there before. Tell us more about Sword-suppression Valley,” Tianming Lord said.

Hunjian Lord had visited Sword-suppression Valley the last time it opened.

“It will take us several days to get there. Let’s talk about it on the road,” Hunjian Lord replied with a smile.

Then, the three of them headed for Sword-suppression Valley.

The re-opening of Sword-suppression Valley provided a great opportunity for numerous Sword Principle experts in the Divine Land.

Therefore, it also attracted the attention of other Sword Principle experts.

72 Marquises all received the invitations from Master Su Ming, who was one of the Nine Sovereigns. No one dared to refuse him, so each of the marquises recommended their three most-excellent Sword Principle experts.

Besides them, many solitary Sword Principle experts who were not under the control of the marquises but were famous for Sword Principle also received invitations.

At that moment, a figure stood on an unknown mountain, which was outside of the territories that the 72 Marquises controlled.

He had a longsword on his back. Having silver-white hair and a mustache, he looked as if he had experienced many vicissitudes of life.

His deep eyes seemed to contain an endless void. He sat with his legs crossed as he drank.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

The sound of wind breaking resounded. Instantly, a dozen figures appeared around the white-haired man.

Those figures all were lords with mighty auras.

They were led by a muscular elder—a superior lord!

The leader looked at the white-haired man with a flicker of killing intent in his eyes.

“Jian Nantian, you won’t escape this time!”
