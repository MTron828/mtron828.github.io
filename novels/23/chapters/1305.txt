Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Scary crimson moon!

A brilliant light that symbolized eternity!

The two rank one Strongest Unique Skills collided directly before countless surprised gazes.

Bang!

The earth shook.

The sky lost its color in front of the two unique skills.

The entire boundless training field was covered by the crimson moon and beautiful eternal light.

Rumble. Another deafening rumble was heard.

Everyone surrounding the border of the training field was left dumbfounded.

Even though there was quite a distance between them and the core of the training field, they could still feel the terrifying power of the two unique skills.

The two people in the pitched battle were a Peak Universe God in the First Heaven while the other one was a Universe Master. But the power that was given out from the collision between the two was enough to astonish all the Universe Gods in the First Heaven. Even Universe Gods in the Second Heaven didn’t dare to belittle them.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

The void continuously cracked as the terrifying crimson moon and the brilliant eternal light clashed ferociously together at the core of the training field.

“The two of them gave full play to their Strongest Unique Skill and they are so well-matched!”

“They are well-matched. The power of the unique skills that they created are very similar!”

“Cool. This is a competition of endurance!”

The surrounding spectators marveled at the sight.

They saw that although the direct collision of two unique skills caused an earth shattering effect, they couldn’t determine a win or loss but they were in a stalemate situation.

Yes!

It’s a stalemate.

Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold while the surging power raged towards the sword continuously. His Blood Mountain Sword was trembling vigorously as it gave out terrifying power.

As for Universe God Qing Yang, he was clenching his teeth, his face was distorted and divine power all over his body was pouring down.

The two of them were giving their all to pull off their strongest stroke but no one could crush the other person directly. Then, the two of them were playing an endurance game!

They were competing who could resist longer, who was more extensive.

A Universe Master and a Universe God in the First Heaven to compete on their strength and resistance, it was obviously not going to work.

However, Jian Wushuang was no ordinary Universe Master, he had done inverse cultivation!

The strength of inverse cultivation was fundamentally stronger. The most important part was that King of Venomous Worms existed in Jian Wushuang’s body. King of Venomous Worms had been recovering his Soul Power quickly.

He was not afraid of competing for endurance!

Rumble! Rumble! Rumble! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The two strong forces charged forward again and again. The longer they pushed, the bigger the expense of power. Universe God Qing Yang had blood at the corner of his lips but his face revealed insanity.

“How is it possible?”

“I am a Peak Universe God in the First Heaven. How could I not win against a Universe Master?”

“Impossible, I won’t believe this!”

Universe God Qing Yang looked ferocious, just like a raging beast. His eyes were flashing with anger too.

He wasn’t willing to believe but the truth was before him. He lost an enormous amount of divine power after such a mad collusion. He already couldn’t continue. On the other hand, Jian Wushuang, who was opposite him, was still fierce and strong and obviously hadn’t reached his limit yet.

If the situation were to persist, he would definitely lose the battle!

“I fight this battle to show Lord Wu Cang!”

“I want to receive Lord Wu Cang’s recognition. I want to go to Snow Dojo. Jian Wushuang should be just a stepping stone for me to prove my ability!”

“I, Qing Yang, how could I be defeated by a stepping stone?”

“I can’t lose!”

“I can’t lose!”

Universe God Qing Yang was twinkling with an unprecedented madness and he was roaring from the bottom of his heart. The next moment he thought of an idea, flipped his hand and there was a cinnabar elixir that appeared.

Looking at the cinnabar elixir, there was a flash of coldness in Universe God Qing Yang’s eyes. He didn’t hesitate to take the elixir straightaway.

All the spectator was shocked at the sight.

“He, ate the elixir?”

“In a one-to-one battle, he had an elixir?”

“The elixir just now seems to be Blood Coagulating Elixir!”

Blood Coagulating Elixir?

The moment the elixir’s name was exclaimed, everyone was taken by surprise.

Blood Coagulating Elixir was an elixir that took on one’s blood as an expense in order to increase their power tremendously in a short period of time.

If a Universe God in the First Heaven were to consume Blood Coagulating Elixir, he could normally increase his power by thirty percent.

If the price wasn’t huge, the increased power wouldn’t be vast as well.

If it were to be a war, it’s natural for Universe God Qing Yang to take a Blood Coagulating Elixir. However, it was a one-to-one battle that was happening before everyone’s eyes. Even if he won the battle, it was because his power increased with the aid of elixir but not his own power!

“He had a Blood Coagulate Elixir? Such a low trick!”

“Universe God Qing Yang is so shameless!”

Everyone was raging.

The Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang who were in the void above too creased their eyebrows.

Universe God Qing Yang who had Blood Coagulate Elixir suddenly increased in divine power and the huge crimson moon that originally couldn’t hold on suddenly became stronger too.

“Jian Wushuang, die!”

Universe God Qing Yang bellowed and his hysterical voice reverberated in the universe.

The huge crimson moon rumbled and there was a tremendous power and surged over. Suddenly, Jian Wushuang’s brilliant Eternal Light retreated.

Jian Wushuang felt the pressing power and his face grew grave.

“Universe God Qing Yang, you asked for it!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were washed with murderous intention. The moment he let out a bellow, the power of Star that was hidden in his body suddenly surged.

The Secret Skills of Star Palace suddenly erupted!

The Secret Skills of Star Palace had always been Jian Wushuang’s trump card. Plus, due to the first volume of the Secret Skills of Star Palace, his power of Star could be accumulated again.

The previous time he played the Secret Skills of Star Palace was to kill the Jin Kingdom Monarch, Jin Feng. It had been many years. His Secret Skills of Star Palace could have been used again long ago. However, if it wasn’t necessary, he didn’t use the technique easily.

Then, Universe God Qing Yang took a Blood Coagulating Elixir and wanted to kill him with the aid of the elixir. That triggered his anger.

He carried out the Secret Skills of Star Palace and integrated the power of Stars into his sword Principle. Then, the power of the retreating Eternal Light suddenly increased by ten-fold!

One must know that Jian Wushuang and Universe God Qing Yang were evenly matched.

Universe God Qing Yang only increased his power of crimson moon by thirty percent with the aid of the elixir.

While Jian Wushuang increased his power by ten-fold after he carried out the Secret Skills of Star Palace!

Thirty percent versus ten-fold?

That was a vast difference.

Rumble!

The huge, resplendent crimson moon collapsed directly.

There was no space for a struggle but it shattered easily like dead wood.

While the brilliant eternal light continued to expand and drowned the entire body of Universe God Qing Yang!

“No!!!”

Universe God Qing Yang bellowed tragically and vanished into thin air the very next second.
