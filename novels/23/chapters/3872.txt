Chapter 3876: Swordsmanship Improvement

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The more powerful a race or life was, the greater the universe’s restrictions would be.

Jian Wushuang was a special life form at the perfect level. The universe’s restrictions were incomparable to those of few living beings in the vast universe.

This was the case when he broke through from the Immortal Saint to the Principles Master level.

An ordinary Immortal Saint could break through to the Principles Masters as long as he comprehended one principle. However, he did not break through until he comprehended two principles at the same time and fused them together!

Now, he had comprehended and fused four principles and met the minimum requirement for an ordinary cultivator to break through to the Principles Masters. However, he was still far from breaking through.

“When I broke through from the Immortal Saint to the Principles Master, I guessed that it would be much more difficult for me to break through from the Principles Master to the Ruler. However, I couldn’t be sure. I also thought that I was lucky, but now it seems…” Jian Wushuang sighed secretly.

He had been prepared for the Immortal Saint to break through to the Principles Master.

After all, his master Xuan Yi had led the way. Xuan Yi had fused two principles to become a Principles Master, so it was the same for him.

However, no one had led him from a Principles Master to a Ruler.

After all, his master Xuan Yi had only been a Principles Master when he was at his peak. He had not been able to break through to the Ruler level. Moreover, Xuan Yi had not fused four principles at that time.

This made Jian Wushuang feel a little lucky. Maybe he could also break through to the level of a Ruler after fusing four principles.

It was a good idea, but the reality was cruel.

“If I can break through to the level of a Ruler, I can immediately refine the Divine Beginning Realm again. I can guarantee that the Divine Beginning Realm will be safe, but unfortunately…” Jian Wushuang could only shake his head secretly. “But on the bright side, after fusing the four principles, my strength has also improved a lot. It can be considered a great harvest.”

After fusing the four principles, Jian Wushuang received more than just the power of his will.

Just the divine power of fusing the four principles was enough to increase the power of Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship by a large margin. He also had a higher level of application of the principles, which also increased his strength to a certain extent.

In addition, there was swordsmanship.

“My comprehension of the universe origin of sword principle is very high, but I have merged too few principles, so my swordsmanship is more or less affected. Now that the four principles have been merged, the swordsmanship I created should be able to be improved to a certain extent. Of course, the most important move is the earth guardian,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

The earth protection sword technique was to condense the Earth Sword Realm. When this Earth Sword Realm was used, it mainly relied on two aspects.

The first was his comprehension of the universe origin of Sword Dao, and the second was the principles of the Earth.

Previously, although he had comprehended the principles of the Earth, he did not fuse it with the other three principles, which resulted in him only being able to add the principle of the earth into this sword domain.

But now, he could use the earth principle as the main principle and perfectly integrate the other three principles into it, making the Earth Sword Realm more powerful.

“Let’s begin.”

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and calmed down the restlessness in his heart. Then he continued to enhance the power of his swordsmanship in the cave mansion.

The three most powerful swordsmanship he created, Hazy, wave light, and Earth Guard, would definitely have the greatest impact after he fused the four principles, however, the power of the other two sword skills could also be greatly improved.

Next, Jian Wushuang stayed in the cave mansion and continued to spend time improving his sword skills.

The process of improving his sword skills was more complicated and took a longer time than the merging of the four principles.

In the blink of an eye, another three years had passed.

The ninth dark zone was thousands of miles away from the cave mansion where Jian Wushuang was hiding.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Two figures suddenly condensed in the void. They were Thousand-edge Demon Monarch, who was attracted by the principle-treasure Divine Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand, and Blood Rain Demon Monarch, whom he had invited. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Blood Rain Demon Monarch was the only woman among the five strongest experts in the ninth dark zone. She was beautiful, graceful, and charming.

At this moment, a burly man stood in front of them. If Jian Wushuang were here, he would have recognized him immediately. This burly man was Ancient Chaos Star Master, who had fought with him and was influenced by his saber skills, he had integrated four principles.

“Ancient Chaos Star Master gives his greetings, Thousand-edge Demon Monarch and Blood Rain Demon Monarch.” Ancient Chaos Star Master was shocked.

He was merely a peak-stage second-level Ruler. Although his life-saving abilities were quite good, he could only deal with ordinary third-level Rulers. As for Thousand-edge Demon Monarch and Blood Rain Demon Monarch, any one of these two…would be enough to easily kill him. He was naturally shocked.

“Ancient Chaos Star Master, let me ask you. Have you seen that newly risen Blood Sword Master?” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch looked down.

“Blood Sword Master?” Ancient Chaos Star Master’s expression changed. He sensed the anxiety in Thousand-edge Demon Monarch’s eyes and guessed why he was so anxious.

“Thousand-edge Demon Monarch, I did meet Blood Sword Master four years ago. We had a fierce battle, but he was not weak. I couldn’t do anything to him, so I left. I haven’t seen him for the next four years, and I don’t think I’ve heard that Blood Sword Master is still active in this area,” Ancient Chaos Star Master said truthfully.

“Did you see him again four years ago?” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch’s face darkened.

After he learned of Jian Wushuang’s existence, he immediately invited demon master Blood Rain to come here. When he arrived, Jian Wushuang happened to be hiding in the cave mansion.

For the past four years, Jian Wushuang had been hiding in the cave mansion and had not come out.

Thousand-edge Demon Monarch had come to this area to look for many prisoners who had been wandering around. Most of them did not know about Jian Wushuang, and even if they did, they had heard or met him four years ago.

In other words, Jian Wushuang had not appeared in this area in the past four years.

“Has Blood Sword Master left?” Thousand-blade demon master asked in a low voice.

“It’s possible.” Blood Rain Demon Monarch nodded slightly, he said softly, “Blood Sword Master is only a Principles Master and has a principle true treasure, but he was able to survive in the Eternal Dark Prison for so long. He is definitely not an idiot. He knows that there has been a disturbance in the ninth dark region, so it’s normal for him to leave immediately and go to another dark region.”

“No, I don’t believe that he left just like that. Keep looking. No matter what price I have to pay, I must find him.” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch’s face was twisted, his eyes were filled with unprecedented fervor and madness.
