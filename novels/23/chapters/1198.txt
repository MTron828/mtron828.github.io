Chapter 1199: The Trump Cards of Green Fire Palace!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“The nine of them are just Dao Masters, but put them together and their strength equals that of a Celestial Master.”

The Ancient God Battle Formation had left a lasting impression on Jian Wushuang.

Samsara Temple Master laughed. “The Ancient God Battle Formation is a kind of tactical formations. It’s not a particularly strong one.”

“Do you mean that there’s an even better formation in Green Fire Palace?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes.” Samsara Temple Master nodded. “The huge battlefield is the product of an earthshaking battle. Both the number of experts participating in that battle and their strength are all far beyond my imagination. In that battle, experts from both sides used tactical formations. Since many died, their tactical formations were also left there.”

“We’ve obtained several tactical formations over the past 400 million years but they’re all extraordinary, so they’re put to use in the Green Fire World. Thus, they’re not available at the Fire Points Exchange Office.”

“But it’s now time to use them here with the decisive battle with the Jin Kingdom looming.”

“Void and I have already informed all experts residing in the Green Fire World about the upcoming battle as well as the strong enemies that they should watch out for. We also ordered all experts over the Dao Master level to join the battle!”

“Experts over the Dao Master level to join the battle?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

There were two continents in the Green Fire World. In Samsara Continent alone, there were billions of people, countless factions, and innumerable Dao Masters.

The vast Void Continent was also home to a lot of Dao Masters.

It was difficult to even imagine just how many experts over the Dao Master level would there be in the entire Green Fire World. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Moreover, they were now all ordered to go to war.

“The Jin Kingdom will be going all out in this war but they’ll likely just send Universe and Celestial Masters here. Since we don’t have as many Universe and Celestial Masters on our side, all we can do is make up for the power imbalance with the numbers of our Dao Masters!” Samsara Temple Master added.

“Great power in numbers?” Jian Wushuang blurted out.

“Yes! Great power in numbers,” Samsara Temple Master said. “It was our huge population, especially our huge number of Dao Masters, that narrowed the gap in experts of high realms between two sides five million years ago. That was how we withstood the attack of the Jin Kingdom!”

“So will we this time!”

“Normally, these Dao Masters could only be cannon fodder in the battlefield. But it’s a completely different situation if they team up to form a tactical formation!” Samsara Temple Master’s eyes turned cold.

“We’ve gained various tactical formations. The simples ones need only 10 Dao Masters to unleash a strength that rivals a Celestial Master.”

“When hundreds of Dao Masters work together to form even larger formations, their power could equal that of the tactical formation of an advanced Celestial Master and even one in the Exceptional Realm!”

“For higher level… If thousands of Dao Masters work together, their battle strength equals that of a Universe Master!”

Jian Wushuang could not help secretly exclaiming to himself as he listened.

Usually, a normal Dao Master would be no more than cannon fodder if he fought alone in a battle of such level.

Even the small sliver of power in the aftermath could kill a Dao Master, never mind trying to make a difference in the battlefield. If they worked together, however, it was a whole other story.

“Of course, there’s a limit to how much these formations can help us. It’s our two remaining trump cards that we’re counting on,”Samsara Temple Master said.

“What are they?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“One of them is the land we stand upon,” Samsara Temple Master answered.

“Land?” Jian Wushuang was startled. “You mean the land where Green Fire Palace lies? Our base?”

“Correct.” Samsara Temple Master smiled. “You’ve been here for quite some time. Surely, you must be aware of the uniqueness of this land.”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang solemnly nodded. “Cultivation is much more effective here. Besides, the palaces, attics, flowers, and trees could never be destroyed. That’s quite unique.”

“Of course. Why else would we choose to build our base here?” Samsara Temple Master replied, smiling.

“Follow me.”

Samsara Temple Master and Void Temple Master led Jian Wushuang to the most secret chamber of Green Fire Palace.

The chamber lied deep underground in the center of the palace.

It was covered with Restrictions that prevented even Celestial and Universe Masters from forcing their way in.

Jian Wushuang entered the secret chamber under Samsara Temple Master’s guidance.

The floating luminous pearls immediately caught his eye when he entered. The pearls of varying colors were distinctive.

“Void Temple Master! Samsara Temple Master! Palace Master Jian Wushuang!” a white-haired elder in front of the luminous pearls exclaimed.

“Celestial Master Yun?” Jian Wushuang’s expression betrayed his surprise.

“Celestial Master Yun is the oldest Celestial Master in Green Fire Palace. His position is no lower than us Palace Masters. He’s in charge of the formation cast over the battlefield as well the land where our palace sits,” said Samsara Temple Master.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He knew that Celestial Master Dao Yun enjoyed an esteemed position and commanded a deep respect from the Palace Masters but did not expect Dao Yun to be in charge of such important things.

“Celestial Master Yun, let Jian Wushuang look at the land we’re on.” Samsara Temple Master smiled.

“Alright.” Yun nodded and showed Jian Wushuang a luminous pearl.

“You’ll be able to get the complete overview of the land through this pearl, even the deepest corners of it,” he said.

Jian Wushuang immediately poured his Soul Power into the pearl.

A short moment later, he retrieved his Soul Power. His face was now pale with shock and horror.

“Is this place a Battle Fortress?” Jian Wushuang cried.

Samsara Temple Master laughed. “Yes, it’s a Battle Fortress.”

“This land is a mobile Battle Fortress. It’s formidable because we can both attack and defend here. Unfortunately, when we found and occupied this fortress, 90 percent of it was damaged. The only things left were only some basic defense or attack skills. Even so, it’s still our killing weapon!”

“To a great extent, we owe our victory 500 million years ago to this Battle Fortress!”
