Chapter 1443: They’re Here!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the boundless void, the spaceship was still traveling forward.

On the deck, the people in Hong Ri Mercenary Group were very free.

“It has been rather peaceful. There are not even any bandits that come and look for trouble.”

“Humph, which ordinary bandit groups dare to ask for trouble with us, Hong Ri Mercenary Group? Even if we were to encounter the extremely strong bandit groups like Hei Longshan, we have Mister Jian Ke with us. There’s nothing to be afraid of.”

“When would we be as powerful as Mister Jian Ke?”

They chatted leisurely as they gathered in groups.

In one of the corners, there were two Universe Gods together. The two Universe Gods were just ordinary Universe Gods in the Third Heaven and they were recruited by Hong Ri Mercenary Group when they were at Floating City.

“Mister Pang Bo already sent a message. They’ll be here in another half a day. By then, we carry out the plan accordingly,” an elderly with triangle eyes said in a very low voice. Besides the person before him, no one else could hear.

“On this spaceship, there’s Jian Ke who swept Hei Longshan alone. Mister Pang Bo, would they succeed?” The other blonde-haired maiden ceased her eyebrows and asked.

“Don’t worry. Not only is Mister Pang Bo coming, there’s also Mister Zhao Han,” the elderly with triangle eyes replied.

“Mister Zhao Han? The expert on Universe God ranking list?” The blonde-haired girl was shocked and immediately beamed with joy, “Then, it should be fine. No matter how great Jian Ke is, he definitely is far behind when he is compared with an expert on the Universe God ranking list.

“Let’s get ready. There’s about half a day left,” the elderly with triangle eyes said.

Half a day flew past really quickly.

In the spaceship cabin, Jian Wushuang, who had been closing his eyes, suddenly opened his eyes. His Soul Power sensed the other spaceship in the void in front of them approaching them.

“Su Hong, the person who wants to kill you is here,” Jian Wushuang spoke.

“He’s here?” Su Hong’s face grew solemn instantly.

Immediately, Jian Wushuang and Su Hong came out from the cabin.

“Mister Jian Ke, Su Hong, why are both of you out?” Group leader of Hong Ri Mercenary Group smiled and he looked over.

Jian Wushuang didn’t reply but fixed his gaze in the void before him.

“Yu Gang, tell your people to be prepared. There’s a strong enemy approaching,” Su Hong said in a deep voice.

“A strong enemy again?” Yu Gang creased his eyebrows.

“The strong enemy this time is much scarier than Hei Longshan,” Su Hong said.

“What?” Yu Gang got a shock and gave out a command in a roar, “Hurry up. Get up and be prepared to fight your enemy!”

The people in Hong Ri Mercenary Group who were on the deck were frightened. They stood up and divine weapons appeared in their hands.

Everyone was looking into the dark void before them. There was a crimson light appearing gradually and it continued to magnify.

“It’s a spaceship!”

“Such a beautiful spaceship.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The people in Hong Ri Mercenary Group fixed their gazes on the beautiful crimson spaceship.

Just then, on the corner of the deck, the elderly with triangle eyes and the blonde-haired maiden who were well prepared exchanged a glance.

“Action!” The elderly with triangle eyes roared.

Suddenly, there was an eruption of two bolts of aura on the spaceship.

The elderly with triangle eyes and the blonde-haired maiden took action simultaneously. They launched their strongest attacks at the structure of the side of the spaceship.

The structure of the spaceship was heavy-duty. When a strong attack was launched from the outside, it would require time and effort to break. However, if the attack was launched from the inside, it would be much easier.

The elderly with triangular eyes and the blond-haired maiden stayed on the spaceship for a while and they knew clearly about the weakness of the structure. Then, they attacked the two weakest points directly and did so at the same time. Instantly, the structure on the side of the spaceship shattered.

“Sh*t!” Yu Gang’s face grew grave, “You two b*stards!”

“There’s two of them?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes. He knew long ago that there was an expert sent by Chu Sect among Hong Ri Mercenary Group, but he had never expected there to be two.

The two of them suddenly launched an attack at the structure and he couldn’t stop them in time.

“Hurry up and run!”

The elderly with triangle eyes and the blonde-haired maiden removed the structure and left the spaceship without hesitation. They wanted to run to the crimson spaceship and meet up with Zhao Han, Pang Bo and the rest of the troop.

But just as they dashed out from the spaceship, there were two shapeless soul attacks that hit them.

“What?”

The elderly with triangle eyes and the blonde-haired maiden looked terrified. Then, their figures fell down the very next moment.

“Although I can’t stop you breaking the structure in time, it’s fairly easy to kill you,” Jian Wushuang looked cold.

“Awesome!” Yu Gang and the Universe Gods in Hong Ri Mercenary Group at the surrounding felt great.

“Be prepared, the massacre is going to start,” Jian Wushuang said.

The Universe Gods in Hong Ri Mercenary Group suddenly lifted their heads. Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! They saw figures with fierce auras turning into flowing light and plunging towards their spaceship. Without the hindrance of the structure, the flowing light descended onto the deck directly.

There was a total of thirty figures descending simultaneously.

Luckily, the spaceship was extremely huge. The deck was like a mini battlefield and it could fit these people.

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and stared at the people before him.

Yu Gang by his side and the Universe Gods in Hong Ri Mercenary Group looked on in distress.

They had already noticed the people who came were all Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven. There was a total of thirty of them. Among them, the one leading was the brawny man carrying a green saber. His aura was much stronger compared to the others.

“You, you are…” Yu Gang stared at the brawny man carrying a green saber and there was terror in his eyes, “Pang Bo, it’s you!”

“You know him?” Jian Wushuang glanced at Yu Gang.

“Yes,” Yu Gang nodded, “Pang Bo was originally a group leader of a huge mercenary group. But in the end, because he offended an expert on Universe God ranking list by accident and the mercenary group under his lead was massacred. The expert on the Universe God ranking list originally wanted to kill him too, but Pang Bo was too strong. His defense power is terrifyingly strong. Although the expert on the Universe God ranking list could suppress him, he couldn’t kill him and he gained fame in that battle. He is an expert who is extremely close to the standard of the Universe God ranking list.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“You… are you Jian Ke?” Pang Bo’s gaze was cold as he looked at Jian Wushuang.

“It’s me,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly.

“If you were to leave here now, you might save your own life,” Pang Bo said coldly.

“Hehe, you might not be qualified to say this,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“Is it?” There was a flash of coldness in Pang Bo’s eyes and he plunged forward like a fierce tiger in the very next moment.
