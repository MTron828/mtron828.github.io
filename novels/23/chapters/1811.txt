Chapter 1812: Bloodline Inheritance

“Mm.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Jian Wushuang nodded and immediately started inheriting under Wu Hun’s guidance.

The pearl that was concentrated with blood essence was absorbed into Jian Wushuang’s body directly.

Bloodline inheritance, Jian Wushuang had done it once.

It was many years ago. He had received King of Venomous Worm’s owner, King Luo Zhen’s bloodline inheritance.

However, the bloodline inheritance back then had required Jian Wushuang to spend a large amount of time and effort to absorb and refine King Luo Zhen’s blood essence. In the end, not only had he received King Luo Zhen’s bloodline, he had even received part of King Luo Zhen’s power.

It was a pity that Jian Wushuang had forcefully absorbed the rest of the drop of blood essence during a fierce fight, which had led to the interruption of inheritance. In the end, Jian Wushuang had only managed to get a complete Royal Ancient God bloodline.

Wu Hun’s method was obviously much superior to King Luo Zhen.

The bloodline inheritance that Wu Hun had left behind had only contained a complete ancient tribe bloodline but didn’t carry any power. As such, it wouldn’t affect Jian Wushuang at all.

Besides, the speed of inheritance was really quick. It did not take a long time.

It only took ten years until the bloodline inheritance was completed.

On the huge dead body, Jian Wushuang sat quietly and his body was covered with a layer of faint black jade lustre.

His body was obviously one size more muscular than before as his muscles bulged. There were originally six Ancient God stars that were hanging upside down in between his eyebrows but then it had become seven stars.

Yes, there were seven stars!

The seven Ancient God stars weren’t dark gold but had become black jade.

“Black jade Ancient God stars?” Jian Wushuang muttered, then he quickly shook his head, “No, it shouldn’t be referred to as an Ancient God star…”

His bloodline had already transformed.

He wasn’t an Ancient God but a complete ancient tribe then!

He possessed the ancient tribe bloodline.

As for the Quadrangular Star in-between his eyebrows, they were a fountain of ancient tribe strength. Every single Quadrangular Star contained boundless power of ancient tribe bloodline.

The power of the bloodline was very strong!

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and there was an explosion in the void. He felt that his random punch without divine power but with only power of ancient tribe bloodline could easily break a hole in the void that was tens of thousands of miles in circumference.

“My power has improved.”

Jian Wushuang was sure about it. There was no doubt about it.

Even if his bloodline didn’t transform completely, as he accumulated seven stars and became a seven-star royal Ancient God, his power of Ancient God should be at the level of an Almighty. Then, his bloodline transformed completely and became a seven-star ancient tribe expert, Jian Wushuang’s power of bloodline already surpassed the standard of ordinary Sir God.

“If not mistaken, my power of bloodline alone shouldn’t be weaker than an ordinary Sir God’s, if not stronger. In addition to my divine power of third stage Ultimate Real God, the combination of the two… in terms of power, I should be stronger than an Emperor God by double or more!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shimmering with excitement.

One’s power at the level of Sir God or Emperor God would be vastly different even if it was only ten to twenty percent of increment.

Double?

In terms of power itself, it doubled?

What was that?

“Now, I don’t need to perform any secret skills but a casual hit will explore with ferocious power and it should easily hit an ordinary Sir God to death. If I were to perform various skills and secret skills with my all, especially Ancient God secret skills…”

Ancient God belonged to ancient clan. Hence, an expert with ancient tribe bloodline naturally could perform Ancient God unique skill and secret skill, and it would be even more powerful.

His power had increased tremendously!

Jian Wushuang’s overall power had increased tremendously after the bloodline inheritance ended.

There might still be a slight distance between his current power and the top of Emperor God but he was definitely very close.

“At first, not only did I prepare bloodline inheritance, I also prepared to pass down ancient tribe unique skill and secret skill. However, I have been on the battlefield for too long and my remaining consciousness has reached my weakest point. I can’t complete those. Hence, you could only slowly look for other ancient tribe inheritance when your power grows stronger in the future,” Wu Hun sighed.

Jian Wushuang shrugged but he didn’t mind.

To him, it was great that he had received an ancient tribe bloodline. As for ancient tribe secret skill and unique skill, he wouldn’t consider them just yet.

“Oh yeah, senior Wu Hun, could you give me the stone stele that recorded Immemorial Celestial Body? Or can I stay back to comprehend the secret skill completely?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Just bring the stone stele with you,” Wu Hun smiled. “On top of that, I have another thing for you.”

As Wu Hun spoke, he waved and there was a crimson flowing light that soared up from the huge dead body and plunged over.

When the flowing light got closer, Jian Wushuang saw that the flowing light was actually a crimson armor.

The armor looked rusty and it was dim.

“This armor is called Five Gem Armor. I paid a great price to get an expert to make this back then. It is really powerful. There were a few times when I was in danger that I survived because of this armor. However, when the terrifying war descended, the armor was severely damaged in the ferocious fight. Ninety percent of this armor is damaged, which was the reason that I lost my life. However, although the armor is left with only ten percent of its power, it should be more than sufficient for you,” Wu Hun said and threw the crimson armor at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang immediately caught the crimson armor and he looked at it with his eyes shimmering with joy.

Although the armor was broken, Jian Wushuang could still feel that it was remarkable.

To a cultivator, armor was too useful.

Since Jian Wushuang had started cultivation, he had received two suitable armors in total.

One was Blood-killing Plate Armor and it was from Dao Yuanzi’s Blood Devil clone.

Quoting Dao Yuanzi, he had said that Blood-killing Plate Armor and Holocaust Sect’s vicious secret skills were obtained from the hands of an expert who had passed away in the ancient battlefield. Jian Wushuang wasn’t sure if it was true or false but he was certain than Holocaust Sect that was in the dark side of Eternal Chaotic World might have existed since ancient times!

As for the second armor, it was Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor from Lineage of Star. Although it was powerful, it was just something of little value to Jian Wushuang then, but he was reluctant to give it up.

But then, he had received a Five Gem Armor. The armor was one of Wu Hun’s reliances back when he had marched in ancient times.
