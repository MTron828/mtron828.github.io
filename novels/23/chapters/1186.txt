Chapter 1187: Restriction Removing Pearl!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Countless rays of sword light shot forth from Jian Wushuang’s hands. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Each of them was as quick as lightning and all of them were extremely powerful. They came bursting toward the Samsara Temple Master one after the other with great momentum.

He used both hands this time. The black flames covering him increased once more, and even though he managed to block all of the strikes, he was scrambling to do so.

“That’s about it. Stop now,” said the Tang Emperor.

Jian Wushuang stopped striking with his sword and his figure retreated to the side.

It was only now that the Samsara Temple Master managed to catch his breath, but a smile appeared on his face.

“Haha.” He laughed in an extremely carefree manner.

The other four Palace Masters also began laughing.

“Samsara, this time, you’ve been humiliated this time.” Red Lotus teased.

“Wasn’t I? Before, I was still worried that Jian Wushuang was being a little egotistical and held back. Now, it’s obvious that I was the egotistical one,” laughed the Samsara Temple Master.

“Since Jian Wushuang managed to force you into such a state, it’s without a doubt that he’s already at peak Universe Master level and much stronger than any of the four of us,” said the Void Temple Master. He gave the Sunrise Sword Emperor a weird look and said, “Sunrise, I’m afraid that you won’t be able to keep your title of Number One Sword Cultivator in the Green Fire World.”

The Sunrise Sword Emperor laughed bitterly. “I knew long ago that Jian Wushuang had incredibly great talent in swordsmanship. In the past, I wished to have a friendly duel with him when he reached Celestial Master level, but who would have expected him to surpass me in terms of strength when he’s just at Dao Master level?” he said.

“That said, the stronger he is, and the more he defies the natural order, the greater the help he can give to the Green Fire Palace,” he continued, clenching his fists.

“Indeed,” the other Palace Masters nodded seriously.

“Jian Wushuang,” the Samsara Temple Master said as he looked toward him. “You’re only second to me in terms of strength now in the Green Fire Palace. I’m afraid even I won’t be your match for long.”

Jian Wushuang felt emotional.

From the Samsara Temple Master’s voice, Jian Wushuang knew that he was still confident that he was stronger for now.

“The Samsara Temple Master is the eldest Palace Master in the Green Fire Palace and his strength had always been unfathomable. Even though I had the slight upper hand just now, it was because he had held back. Furthermore, I believe that as a Palace Master, he must have many treasures, but during our duel, he only used a Chaos Magic Treasure level glove.

“He must still have many tricks up his sleeve,”?thought Jian Wushuang secretly.

Of course, Jian Wushuang had also not used his entire repertoire of skills.

He had not displayed the entire range of his swordsmanship; he did not use his most powerful move, that which was created by himself.

“To think that you would have such incredible progress during such a short span of 1,800 years. I’m now 100 percent sure that you can become the leader of the Green Fire Palace. It’s a pity that the Green Fire World can’t afford to wait for you to mature gradually,” said the Samsara Temple Master with a light sigh.

The other Palace Masters also felt a chill.

Indeed, judging from the current situation, there was already no room for Jian Wushuang to cultivate his skills alone and slowly improve like before.

The main body of the Gold Kingdom’s army was arriving, and war would soon break out. If the Green Fire Palace lost, the entire Green Fire World would continue to exist only in history books.

“No matter what, the Green Fire Palace must win this battle!” said Jian Wushuang as he clenched both fists tightly.

“Yes, we must!” agreed the other five Palace Masters as they nodded readily.

“Alright. All preparations have been made. Let’s set off now,” the Samsara Temple Master said.

Immediately, all six Palace Masters, Jian Wushuang included, set forth for the base of the Gold Kingdom within the battlefield.

They arrived at the Void there a few days later.

“Is that where their base is?” asked Jian Wushuang as he squinted.

Before him was a district shrouded in purple haze. It was huge, and Jian Wushuang’s Soul Power could not penetrate the thick haze. Evidently, the Gold Kingdom had planted some formidable restrictive wards in the area.

“How could we hope to break into an area with such Restrictions?” asked Jian Wushuang with a frown.

“Of course there’s a way to do that. You just watch,” said the Void Temple Master with a slight grin. He then took out a transparent pearl.

The pearl contained a mysterious grey energy, and one could vaguely notice a faint thunderbolt dancing within it. It gave off an aura of destruction.

“What’s this?” asked Jian Wushuang doubtfully.

“This is a Restriction Removing Pearl. It’s especially used to break Formations or remove Restrictions. Many years ago, experts from our Green Fire Palace chanced upon a few of them when wandering about the battlefield. This is the first time that we’re using them, though,” said the Void Temple Master with a laugh.

Upon hearing about the pearls, the Gu King also spoke up. “This Restriction Removing Pearl is a real gem. In the Eternal Chaotic World, it could directly breakthrough normal Formations or restrictions. Even though the Formation surrounding the base of the Gold Kingdom is formidable, I doubt that it could withstand the onslaught of these pearls. If I didn’t guess wrong, I believe the Void Temple Master has a few of them with him.”

“There are plenty of good things in this battlefield,” Jian Wushuang pondered secretly.

“We shall all move according to plan,” said the Samsara Temple Master in a chilling tone. “When the Restriction Removal Pearl is thrown out and breaks through all the restrictive Formations, I along with Void, the Tang and Sunrise Sword Emperors will bring the five Puppet Fighters and charge directly into their nest to begin the slaughter.”

“Red Lotus, you’ll remain here and unleash your Skill of the Jiu You Realms, thereby suppressing the enemy experts in sync with our attack. At the same time, you’ll prevent our enemies from escaping.”

“Right,” replied Red Lotus with a solemn nod. She then subconsciously touched the blood red bracelet she was wearing.

It was an extremely valuable piece of treasure.

“Jian Wushuang,” the Samsara Temple Master continued, as he turned his gaze toward him.

“You’re extremely strong, and only second to me. Furthermore, you’re skilled in swordcraft and possess extremely great speed. You’ll hide amongst the darkness and deliver the final blow. Strike once you’ve found the perfect opportunity and deal the most damage you can to the Gold Kingdom. It would be great if you can kill one or two of their Universe Masters in one blow!”

“Understood,” replied Jian Wushuang. His gaze had turned cold, and the killing intent was raging within himself.

“Everyone, today’s battle concers the survival of our Green Fire World. If we wipe out the Gold Kingdom’s foundations today, when its main body arrives, we still stand a chance. If we fail, the Green Fire World will be doomed!”

“We can’t afford to lose this battle and let that chance of survival slip from our hands!” the Samsara Temple Master said in a low tone.

“We have to win this battle!”

“Victory!”

Jian Wushuang and the others roared.

“Let’s strike!”

The Samsara Temple Master growled, and the Void Temple Master, who was beside him, tossed the Restriction Removing Pearl in his hand toward the district shrouded in purple haze.

The pearl shot into the haze and instantly, a piercing glow emerged, like a sun emerging.

An earth-shattering, terrible explosion soon followed.

Boom!

It was as though Heaven and Earth had split apart.

After the explosion, the purple haze covering the perimeter of the Gold Kingdom’s base began dispersing to the surrounding area.
