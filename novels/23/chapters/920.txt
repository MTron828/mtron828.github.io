Chapter 921: Crush at Wedding Gifts!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

It was silent in the Drill Ground.

The huge sacred Magic Weapon Pavilion was quietly suspended in the Void. Aura from the magic weapons within emanated from it.

The horrible number, 138,000, echoed in everyone’s mind.

The experts in the stand had a wealth of experience and soon recovered from their shock.

After coming back to themselves, those in the stand were in a frenzy.

“How is it even possible?”

“Oh God! 138,000 magic weapons?”

“If I didn’t see it with my own eyes, I would never believe it. It’s incredible that someone can collect such a vast number of magic weapons for a wedding gift.”

“Haha, 138,000 Emperor Weapons! I really doubt that he brought all the Emperor Weapons in the Eternal World here. It’s too incredible.”

There were gasps of horror.

As experienced as the experts were, they had never witnessed such a shocking scene.

Even Emperor Leng found it hard to restrain his shock.

“How is it possible? So many Emperor Weapons! If Tang of the East spared no effort, we probably won’t be able to obtain one or two tenths of these weapons. How did he achieve this?” Emperor Leng muttered as he speculated on a possible reason.

“Is it from Stellar Fog Sea?”

“The Stellar Fog Sea is so mysterious that no one has emerged from it alive for a long time. No one knows what is inside. Jian Wushuang managed to survive the Stellar Fog Sea. It is probable that he gained a great opportunity there and obtained an incredible number of Emperor Weapons. As for that Bodhi Dan, it is probably from the Stellar Fog Sea too.”

“Yes, definitely from Stellar Fog Sea.”

Emperor Leng confirmed his guess inwardly.

Jian Wushuang had indeed gained a great opportunity in the Stellar Fog Sea. The Bodhi Fruit to refine the Bodhi Dan was from Stellar Fog Sea.

But the Magic Weapon Pavilion had nothing to do with Stellar Fog Sea.

This Magic Weapon Pavilion had been given by his mysterious Master Xuan Yi.

And the 138,000 Emperor Weapons were also from from Xuan Yi.

This was a big gift from his Master.

…

Seated at the long table, Xue Lingtian smiled slightly and looked around, “You guys, what do you think of the third wedding gift prepared by my junior brother ?”

“Incredible.”

The Master from Dongyan Clan said, “138,000 Emperor Weapons! Even if Dongyan Clan sells all it owns, it cannot compare to one percent of this Magic Weapon Pavilion. Master Blood Saber, how did your junior brother get all these Emperor Weapons?”

All eyes turned to Xue Lingtian.

They were curious about how Jian Wushuang had managed to obtain such a huge number of Emperor Weapons. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Was this opportunity in defiance of the natural order?

“Don’t bother with how my junior brother got these Emperor Weapons. I just wanna know how this gift compares with that offered by Xia Mang from Xia Clan?” Xue Lingtian asked with a slight smile on his face.

The experts in the stand were in a daze for a second and exchanged glances. They were too embarrassed to respond in Xia Yu’s presence but the answer was obvious.

Jian Wushuang and Xia Mang had each prepared three wedding gifts. Xia Mang’s gifts were indeed extremely precious, especially the third Magic Cloud Valley relic which had surpassed all others in the convention. However, compared to Jian Wushuang’s gifts, Xia Mang’s gifts were inferior.

The disparity was immense.

For the first wedding gift, Xia Mang had offered Youth-retaining Elixir. Jian Wushuang had provided Crape Myrtle Elixir.

Youth-retaining Elixir and Crape Myrtle Elixir were of equal rarity and value. Youth-retaining Elixir stopped aging for female cultivators. This was an attractive feature but it had no truly useful functions.

On the other hand, Crape Myrtle Elixir could inhibit the toxin in Leng Rushuang’s body. Besides, Jian Wushuang had overcome great obstacles and retrieved it at great risk to himself.

This love alone was something that Xia Mang could not compare with.

The disparity between the second wedding gifts was more obvious.

The two Blood Emperor Puppets given by Xia Mang owned Dao Master Level strength but they were merely Puppet Fighters. Bodhi Dan offered by Jian Wushuang could produce human Dao Master experts. There were also five Bodhi Dan, and therefore potentially five human Dao Masters.

And as for the third wedding gift..

Xia Mang had provided four tokens that granted access to the Magic Cloud Valley relics. To obtain the treasures from Magic Cloud Valley, effort, cost and time would need to be spent by the bearer of the tokens.

Furthermore, only fifty or sixty percent of treasures may be retrieved.

The Magic Weapon Pavilion offered by Jian Wushuang required no further cost or effort by the recipient of the gift.

Most importantly, while the Magic Cloud Valley relics held a large number of treasure opportunities, their combined value did not even come close to the value of the Magic Weapon Pavilion.

A total of 138,000 Emperor Weapons!?This number was really incredible.

It was estimated that there was nothing in the entire Eternal World which could match the value of these magic weapons. Naturally, the Magic Cloud Valley relics paled in comparison to them.

So the three wedding gifts from Jian Wushuang and Xia Mang were compared.

None of the wedding gifts from Xia Mang were comparable to those presented by Jian Wushuang.

In the stand, Xia Yu’s face flushed.

He, Xia Clan, had spent millions of years searching for the Magic Cloud Valley relics. He had intended for the gift to shock the Selection Ceremony. He had not expected that Jian Wushuang’s wedding gifts that would be much more precious than the Magic Cloud Valley relics.

This was completely beyond his and everyone’s expectations.

A small boy from a remote domain and an ordinary Sect had presented wedding gifts that far surpassed their Xia’s!

If news of this spread, their first overlord clan, Xia Clan in the Tang of the East would inevitably become a laughingstock.

“Hum, so what if he has better wedding gifts than Xia Clan? The Selection Ceremony doesn’t just look at wedding gifts. It considers talents and strengths too!”

“We’ll see who has the last laugh!”

Xia Yu snorted coldly.
