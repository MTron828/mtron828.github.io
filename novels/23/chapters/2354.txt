Chapter 2355: Clean Sweep

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

They had been intimidated by the strength Jian Wushuang had displayed.

Four of them had teamed up previously. However, in a single strike, Jian Wushuang had killed two of them while also severely injuring the remaining two.

Under these circumstances, clashing with Jian Wushuang again would be no different from courting death.

The two Divine Demon Realm experts from the Golden Cauldron Sect retreated in a frenzy to open up distance from Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, stop!” Qian Yuan and Xiang Yi, who were behind Jian Wushuang, berated him.

However, Jian Wushuang wasn’t going to entertain them.

His speed was much faster than that of the two Divine Demons that were trying to escape.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang appeared before a Golden Cauldron Sect’s expert. He swung out his sword casually and it was still Snow Cleave.

“No!!” After a tragic cry, the expert from the Golden Cauldron Sect soon left the world and became a corpse.

As for the other, he managed to escape in time and met up with Qian Yuan and Xiang Yi. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The sky above Lin Mansion turned completely silent.

Deadly silent.

Numerous shocked people were staring at the young man holding a long sword with a God Statue shadow behind him that was a thousand feet tall.

Qian Yuan, Xiang Yi, and the only one left from the Divine Demon Realm quartet from Golden Cauldron Sect, were looking extremely wretched.

They had formed the team to complete the mission issued by their sect at the perilous land. Through the impeccable coordination, they had survived several hidden dangers lurking in the perilous land. In the end, theyhad even completed the mission issued by their sect.

And now, they had only come to take a look because something had happened to Xiang Yi’s family.

Who would have expected that the three of them would fall to an Early Stage Chaotic Realm after they survived in that perilous land?

Moreover, the other party still wasn’t dead?

In other words, the line-up of two Second Grade Divine Demons and four Third Grade Divine Demons had been swept by a Chaotic Realm!!

Jian Wushuang smiled and looked at the three surviving people. “What a shame! I let one get away.” Jian Wushuang was feeling a little regretful.

With his current strength, killing Third Grade Divine Demon would only really be easy once he cast Secret Skill of Seven Star and Punisher God.

However, it might still not be possible to kill a Second Grade Divine Demon.

Therefore, his objective from the beginning was not to kill Qian Yuan or Xiang Yi. Instead, his targets were the four Third Grade Divine Demons.

He killed three of them consecutively. Although Qian Yuan and Xiang Yi were still around, they could no longer threaten him.

“Didn’t you guys say you were going to kill me? Let’s continue!” Jian Wushuang said mockingly.

“Jian Wushuang, we admit that we underestimated you!” Xiang Yi stared daggers at Jian Wushuang. “However, don’t get too cocky. Do you think our Golden Cauldron Sect will let you off after you killed three Divine Demon Realm experts from our Golden Cauldron Sect?”

The Golden Cauldron Sect could be considered to be an extremely powerful sect with a long history.

Three Divine Demon Realm experts dying wouldn’t have meant much to the entire Golden Cauldron Sect. However, the Golden Cauldron Sect still couldn’t pretend it was fine.

Previously, Jian Wushuang had killed an expert from the Xiang Family who was the sister of Xiang Yi. This had no direct connection to the Golden Cauldron Sect and therefore the Golden Cauldron Sect wouldn’t step in.

This time, the Divine Demon Realm experts from Golden Cauldron Sect had come because they had been on a mission with Xiang Yi and happened to be on the way there.

Now, Jian Wushuang had killed three Divine Demon Realm experts from Golden Cauldron Sect. This was completely different in nature from before.

“Brat. You dared to even kill the experts from our Golden Cauldron Sect! Just wait for your death!” Qian Yuan also stared coldly at Jian Wushuang.

Now it was impossible for them to kill Jian Wushuang on their own.

However, the sect behind them could easily do so.

“Golden Cauldron Sect?” Jian Wushuang chuckled nonchalantly. What can a meagre Golden Cauldron Sect do to me?” Jian Wushuang was confident.

In his previous life, he had lived for close to a hundred thousand years. Moreover, he was the second Perfect Chaotic Lifeform in this world. His knowledge and foresight weren’t something comparable to an ordinary man.

The Golden Cauldron Sect could be considered a large sect in the Wusha Barren Region. However, a sect like this wouldn’t even enter the eyes of Jian Wushuang.

Previously, he hadn’t wanted to cause trouble or attract others’ attention. Therefore, he had been keeping a low profile all along.

Now, the trouble had come to him. As such, he wouldn’t be fearful of it.

If it was just a Golden Cauldron Sect, Jian Wushuang would just need around ten years for him to recover to his peak. At that time, he wouldn’t have to fear anything at all.

Even now, even if he couldn’t win and he reached a critical juncture, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t be silly. He could just choose to join a sect that was even stronger than the Golden Cauldron Sect.

He believed once he showed his talents that there wouldn’t be a lack of sects coming to recruit him.

Now, it was just that he wasn’t willing to join these sects.

However, if he was forced into a corner and was left with no other option, he wouldn’t hesitate to join.

“Alright! Alright! Alright!”

Qian Yuan chuckled out of pure anger as he repeated himself. “Jian Wushuang, just wait and see. In no time, experts from our Golden Cauldron Sect will find you. At that time, I’d like to see if you will still have the same confidence as today!”

“Let’s go!”

Qian Yuan growled, turned around, and left in a hurry.

Although Xiang Yi and the two Divine Demon Realm experts from the Xiang Family were indignant, they were clearly aware of the current circumstances.

Therefore, they could only leave helplessly.

However, just as they turned around and were about to leave the Lin Mansion, they saw three figures approaching them directly.

Seeing the three people, those from the Golden Cauldron Sect and the experts from the Xiang Family came to an abrupt halt.

Qian Yuan and Xiang Yi focused their attention on the approaching trio.

“Their outfits and auras... They are from the Water Fairy Island!!” Qian Yuan was the first to recognize them.

“Why are the people from Water Fairy Island here?” Xiang Yi was also confused.

The Water Fairy Island was one of the ten largest sects in the Wusha Barren Region. It was also a lot stronger than their Golden Cauldron Sect.

Only Xiang Zong was overjoyed when he learnt the approaching trio was from the Water Fairy Island.

“Haha! The experts from the Water Fairy Island are finally here!” Xiang Zong’s eyes lit up with excitement.

Previously, Xiang Family had teamed up with the Zhuge Family to eliminate the Lin Family.

They were also aware of the arrangement between Zhuge Family and Xiang Family, including inviting an expert from Water Fairy Island to ambush Jian Wushuang. In the end, that expert had died.

Zhuge Family had long used different channels to inform Water Fairy Island of the matter. It was just that the Water Fairy Island had not taken action, but now their experts were here!

Judging from their expressions, they were probably there to avenge the death of the expert from the Water Fairy Island.
