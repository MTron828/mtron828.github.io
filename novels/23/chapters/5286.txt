Chapter 5285 - 5285: Rebuilding the Body

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the end, after a hundred thousand fractures, his physical body was completely transformed into a mass of flesh and blood.

Now, sitting cross-legged there was only a divine body shadow!

The mass of flesh and blood and the treasures swirling around him slowly merged.

Countless golden liquid refined from treasures, thoroughly mixed with the flesh, turned into a golden sphere.

Then, following his divine body shadow, the process of reshaping his physical body began.

The first refinement arrived, the most critical moment.

If he withstands it, he completes the first perfect refinement of ‘reshaping the physical body’.

If he can’t withstand it, all the expenses would go down the drain. At this moment, Jian Wushuang dared not be negligent. He cooperated fully with the

Universe Bronze Furnace to complete the final step.

Starting from the bones.

The colorful and magnificent skeleton was very familiar to Jian Wushuang. It was a fragment of an ancient beast god’s bone that he had exchanged for millions of treasure points.

Now it had been refined into liquid, impurities removed, surpassing its former

state, becoming his bones entirely.

The massive skeleton stood over nine feet tall.

Compared to the previous Jian Wushuang, there wasn’t much difference. After all, it was crafted according to his divine body shadow. After completing the skeleton, they began to irrigate the flesh.

Starting from the head, a majestic face emerged.

Sharp sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes, between his brows, it seemed like there was a vast starry sky, unparalleled throughout eternity!

Then came the upper body, revealing a robust physique, every inch of muscle sharply defined, wrists broad and thick.

The golden patterns on his chest and back became even more prominent.

Until the entire physical body was completely reshaped, Jian Wushuang finally breathed a sigh of relief.

His breath was like a rainbow, although it evaporated instantly as he exhaled due to the flames, Jian Wushuang could still distinctly feel that his physical body now was countless times stronger than before.

With one punch, he could shatter a star without even using Yan power.

If he completed the Ninth Refinement, he dared not imagine how powerful he would become.

Although enhancing the physical body seemed somewhat foolish, Jian Wushuang was absolutely certain that this decision was wise.

Origin source, divine body, realm, soul—all these aspects were at the edge of breakthrough. Instead of blindly persisting in one path, he chose to explore other avenues.

As long as his strength underwent a qualitative change, everything was possible.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Rumble!

The Universe Bronze Furnace slowly opened.

Jian Wushuang casually walked out, clad in a new set of black robes after stepping out of the bronze furnace.

“Congratulations, Jian Wushuang!’

“It’s luck,” he replied modestly.

His entire demeanor had undergone a noticeable transformation. Now he truly understood what a superior physique represented.

No wonder, after the Seventh Refinement, it signified the peak, let alone the

Ninth Refinement.

Even if he hadn’t reached the Seventh Refinement, his physical strength far surpassed those with high-level perfected bodies.

“This isn’t just luck; it’s your strength,” said the man in black armor, pausing tor a moment before continuing, “By the way, you can call me Mountain Lord from now on, no need to address me as senior.’

“Mountain Lord?” Jian Wushuang was astonished!

Wasn’t that the Demon Lord bound to the Demon-Sealing Pillar?

The first time he saw the man, he wasn’t this affable. He had a fierce and malevolent appearance.

“Why, are you surprised?” Mountain Lord smiled faintly. “Right, you youngsters are now in the second phase of the trial. You should encounter those Demon Lords.’

“Senior, you seem different from those Devouring Demons!” Jian Wushuang asked curiously.

The Devouring Demons he had seen were all frenzied, lacking much consciousness.

Unlike them, Mountain Lord, whether in his original form on the Demon- sealing Pillar or this current ethereal image, possessed consciousness, especially this ethereal image—it was nothing like the Devouring Demons.

“Haha!” Mountain Lord couldn’t help but laugh heartily. “Naturally. The

Devouring Demons you see are just projections of the Ten Thousand Demons.” Jian Wushuang looked puzzled and muttered, “Ten Thousand Demons?”

“Yes! You haven’t become a core inheritor yet, no need to know so much!” Mountain Lord’s ethereal figure floated above the Universe Bronze Furnace, wearing a reminiscing expression beneath the faint glow.

When the true master fell, it split into countless parts, creating the several individuals like them, now all suppressed within this Qishen Temple.

In the outside world, another true god, who also mastered the complete Dao, was suppressed.

The Devouring Dao… He once lost all hope, but he now encountered Jian Wushuang, a practitioner who reignited his hope.

A Grand Yan Immortal who cultivated the power of devouring, he didn’t exude the aura of the Great Dao of Devouring, but the malicious vibe of devouring power was identical to theirs.

He was a host!

True Lords, Demon Lords, and Devouring Demons.

The True Lord was the one suppressed in the Original Universe, comparable to the Universe Master. The several Demon Lords possessed top tier 6 strength.

As for the Devouring Demons, they were just splits from the Lord of Ten Thousand Demons.

Each of them held secrets of the universe!

They once shone brilliantly, but eventually, the True Lord fell, and they were all captured by the Qishen Temple,

Qishen!

The great Qishen, who stripped away his own Devouring Dao.

Such a heroic act, cutting off one’s own path, was simply awe-inspiring throughout history.

Initially, they merged into one, embodying the essence of myriad Daos. But it condensed three True Lord-level experts and one who remained missing, their fate unknown.

Now, seeing another practitioner possessing the power of devouring, how could Mountain Lord, also known as ‘Shan Jun’, not feel delighted?

Jian Wushuang noticed the pain in Shan Jun’s eyes and changed the subject, inquiring about the trial tower.

Originally, the first floor of the trial tower was constructed by the Ten Thousand Executioners.

Once inside, the body would split into ten thousand parts.

His body in the valley was just one in ten thousand.

No wonder he was so weak.

At first, he thought he was suppressed, but in the end, his strength was divided.

Even in terms of physical strength, Jian Wushuang had supreme power. Being split into ten thousand parts, and he turned into an ordinary person… it made sense.

Now, back to one!

Refined further, his physical body could already rival ordinary treasures. Even if he stood still and allowed a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal to attack madly, he wouldn’t be harmed in the slightest.

And this was without using his divine body and origin source.

If he added his divine body and origin source, even a Dao Lord wouldn’t be able to harm him.

Now, with his physical body magnified 1,000-fold by the divine body, he had reached the pinnacle among Grand Yan Immortals.

But this was far from enough; he wanted to become the strongest.

Even surpass those ancient gods and demons.

In the end, even with the divine body magnified 1,000-fold, he still relied on the Candle Dragon Eye; they were all external things.

The fundamental divine body, coupled with a perfected physical body, was the real foundation.

If the basic divine body was magnified 1,000-fold, he would truly be invincible, Relying solely on the divine body would be comparable to Grand Yan Immortals who had mastered the Ultimate Dao.

“Alright, I’ve said what needs to be said. You can enter the trial tower now. Although you have deep foundations, the second floor is very special; you mustn’t be careless!” Shan Jun advised with a gentle gaze!

As if!

A nine-level trial tower; Jian Wushuang never underestimated any floor.

Millions of treasure points were still invested in it; how could he afford to be careless? He gave his all every time..
