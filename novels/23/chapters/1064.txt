The formidable attack left the crowd in shock.

To them, perhaps the legendary Sword Cultivator, Sunrise Sword Emperor, was the only one in the entire Green Fire World capable of surpassing the swordsmanship demonstrated earlier.

Shocked as they were, they were even more confused by the outcome of the events.

Yes, they were confused.

It was Jian Wushuang who made the first attack. He ought to be the one who offended the Supervisor.

However, the Supervisor killed Celestial Master Lei Yi instead of punishing Jian Wushuang.

Just what was going on?

Everyone was deeply bewildered.

“L-Lord…” Celestial Master Dong Ming from the Ancient Demon Clan trembled with fear.

There were only three Celestial Masters out of the entire Ancient Demon Clan, yet this new Supervisor had now killed one of them.

He would have let it go if Lei Yi truly displeased or offended the new Supervisor but the Supervisor had clearly acted unjustly.

Dong Ming was furious but didn’t show it on his face.

Infuriated as he was, he dared not voice it out at the thought of the Supervisor’s status and power.

Under everyone’s shocked gazes, the indigo-robed man on the throne waved his hand and another throne appeared. The throne lined up exactly with his. He turned to look at Jian Wushuang.

“Come here, boy!” the man said gently, his voice carrying a hint of amicableness and familiarity.

“Yes, Father,” Jian Wushuang answered, walking up to the Supervisor.

Silence fell over the drill ground when everyone heard Jian Wushuang’s reply.

“Father?”

“Jian Wushuang called the Supervisor… Father?”

“Is this new Supervisor Jian Wushuang’s father? Are you kidding me?”

They were stunned.

They were totally at a loss.

Experts present had just received some information about the new Supervisor.

The information had been confidential but since he was now the new Supervisor, the Samsara Temple decided to reveal it.

They now knew that the new Supervisor was a talent who had cultivated at an unprecedented speed in the history of the Samsara Temple.

It took him a mere 2,000 years to enter the ninth phase of Reincarnator. He was also said to be the Samsara Temple Master’s personal disciple.

He was an eye-catching and unimaginably talented person!

Jian Wushuang was even more incredible for he was an Eternal Realm expert who defeated a Celestial Master. In terms of talent, he was definitely the best in the entire Green Fire World. He surpassed even the Supervisor.

It was rare to find even a single genius like them, yet there was now two of them in this world and they happened to be father and son. How could this be possible?

Both father and son were outstanding men who had demonstrated their mighty strength.

The scenario made them felt like they were dreaming.

“No wonder Third Brother failed to find his father no matter how hard he tried. It turns out that his father is such an extraordinary figure.”?Su Rou thought to herself in awe.

“That brat is the Supervisor’s son?”?Patriarch of Empyrean Glory was wide-eyed with shock. Compared to his anger, he was more relieved at the thought of escaping from death.

“Thank God. Thank God, our issue has been resolved and I kept my word not to trouble him. Even though I’ve indeed hunted him down before, there should be no reason for the terrifying Supervisor to take revenge on me. I’ll just apologize to him after the ceremony,” Patriarch of Empyrean Glory muttered.

Untamed and unruly as he was, he wasn’t self-conceited.

In fact, few could take his life in the whole Green Fire World.

He didn’t take four peak clans seriously, for no one among them stood a chance of killing him. The Supervisor was a whole other story.

Having witnessed that formidable strike, Patriarch of Empyrean Glory was sure that the Supervisor could take him out.

Ignoring other’s amazement, Jian Wushuang walked toward the Supervisor and took the seat beside him.

“You’ve improved a lot, boy. In such a short time, you can even defeat a Celestial Master.” Jian Nantian complimented his son with a smile.

“I’m still lacking in many ways compared to you, Father,” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

“Don’t compare yourself with me for we have different experiences. Technically, you’re much more excellent than me,” Jian Nantian said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised an eyebrow. Now he was full of doubts.

“Father’s strength is far more powerful and his cultivation rate faster too. Why did he say that?”

“Jian Wushuang, is this really your father?” Gu King asked.

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

How could he mistake someone else as his father?

Whether in terms of appearance, temperament, or the sense of familiarity, Jian Wushuang was 100 percent sure that the one in front of him was his father.

“If he’s your father, then things are going to be interesting,” Gu King added.

“What do you mean?” Jian Wushuang looked confused.

“You said that your father was born in the Ancient World 2,000 years ago, where he became the Reincarnator, before coming to the Samsara Continent. That means he’s only a little over 2,000 years old. However, from what I see, the Supervisor is at least 100,000 years old!” Gu King replied.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was startled.

His father was more than 10,000 years old?

How was this possible?

“Believe me. We Plenilune clansmen are known for our self-recovery capabilities and we’re exceptionally sensitive to vitality. I’m certain that your father has lived over 100,000 years,” Gu King said.

“How is that possible?” Jian Wushuang was still in disbelief. “My father is just decades older than me, a little more than 2,000 years old. How could he suddenly live over 100,000 years? It’s impossible.”

“Nothing is impossible. The world is full of surprises.”

Gu King laughed. “If I’m not mistaken, your father must have entered a magic Secret Land where time moves faster than the outside world. For example, one year in the outside world is equivalent to 100 or even 1,000 years in the Secret Land. It’s possible.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes brightened.

“A Secret Land where the time flows differently from ours?”
