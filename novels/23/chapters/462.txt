Chapter 463: Kill!

Translator:?Transn?Editor:?Transn

As Jian Wushuang dictated the order, the Blood Puppet transformed into a flash of blood-colored Flowing Light and flew away.

He popped up in front of the Demon Soul Lord.

“A Puppet Fighter?”

The Demon Soul Lord noticed that the Blood Puppet had rushed to attack her. She frowned but was not really bothered.

She had already encountered hundreds of Puppet Fighters in this cave mansion, including a large number of Gold-armored Puppets and four Golden Purple Puppets. These Puppet Fighters had not really threatened her. Moreover, Jian Wushuang was only in the Saint Realm, so the Puppet Fighter that he owned wouldn’t be that strong.

“Get the hell out of my way!”

The Demon Soul Lord chopped with her saber.

Although it was a quick chop, it still caused a blood moon to emerge and provided tremendous power.

In contrast, the Blood Puppet had only launched a punch that did not seem special.

When the two strikes collided, the power from the Blood Puppet’s punch erupted.

“What?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Her expression changed dramatically. The Demon Soul Lord could sense the power from her opponent’s fist, but she was unable to defend herself against it. Her scarlet saber curved slightly from the punch. The tremendous power was transmitted from her arm to the insides of her body.

“Puff!”

The Demon Soul Lord spat out a mouthful of blood. Her aura was weakened and she sank to the ground.

There had only been one collision and the Demon Soul Lord, who was regarded as an excellent superior lord, had already received a serious injury.

“This, This is... the marquis battle strength!”

When the Demon Soul Lord was able to stand firmly, she looked up and howled violently.

The howl echoed through the palace and made the lords of both camps stare.

The marquis battle strength?

A Puppet Fighter in the marquis Level?

Everyone looked at the Blood Puppet and nodded to themselves.

One punch had seriously hurt the Demon Soul Lord. Obviously, the Blood Puppet must be at the level of marquis battle strength.

They wondered how someone in the Saint Realm could have a Puppet Fighter in the marquis Level.

Even in the two camps, no one had ever owned a Marquis Puppet!

The battle strength of a Marquis Puppet was equal to marquis Level. In both camps, only the Snow marquis and the Marquis Cangyue had such battle strength.

They didn’t know that this Blood Puppet was created by the Sword Ancestor and that it was also the strongest one that he had ever made.

“This Puppet Fighter is worthy of Sword Ancestor’s name. Before, the Blood Puppet had consumed only three Blood Gems, so it couldn’t really exploit its power. Still, it had easily outclassed a Heaven-defying Level expert. So, if it consumes four Blood Gems, its battle strength will be on par with the regular level of a lord!”

“If it consumes six Blood Gems, it should be comparable to an advanced lord!”

“By consuming ten Blood Gems, the Blood Puppet will reach the peak of its battle strength, equivalent to that of a marquis!”

Moreover, it was the strongest Puppet Fighter made by the Sword Ancestor, it definitely wouldn’t disappoint Jian Wushuang, would it?

“Demon Soul Lord, you must die today.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were full of killing intent. The Blood Puppet turned into a flash of Flowing Light once again and rushed toward the Demon Soul Lord.

At the same time, the blood river which had filled the palace flowed towards the Demon Soul Lord. The powerful pressure from the blood river limited her movement.

“Damn it!”

The Demon Soul Lord looked ferocious but her expression betrayed doubt as she looked at the Blood Puppet.

She knew that even at her optimum state, she could only flee from the Blood Puppet. Now, she had already suffered a serious injury and was also suffering the effects from Jian Wushuang’s Realm. She could barely defend herself now.

“Run, Run!”

The Demon Soul Lord turned around and ran.

“Do you think you can escape?”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fist and successively launched several punches through the air. As he did so, the vast Spiritual Power that had gathered in his body exploded as well.

“Asura Secret Skill, Eighteen Levels of Hell!”

His voice echoed coldly through the palace.

Abruptly, the environment changed. A huge scarlet pavilion slowly emerged. In it, a few ghostly shadows could be seen faintly and they were howling.

When the scarlet pavilion had completely emerged, an immaterial power instantly spread out.

The Demon Soul Lord, who stood below the scarlet pavilion, felt the effects of its power immediately.

She had been making her escape, but she suddenly paused in the void. It was only a short pause, as short as the blink of an eye.

That was the extent of Jian Wushuang’s power.

After all, the Demon Soul Lord was a superior lord. Jian Wushuang’s Realm was still lower than hers. Even if Jian WuShuang exploited the Eighteen Levels of Hell to its fullest extent, it only could stop the consciousness of the Demon Soul Lord for a short moment.

Even so, Jian Wushuang had already consumed 70 percent of his Spiritual Power.

It was only the blink of an eye that was too short even for the lords of the two camps to do anything. However, it was different from the Blood Puppet.

By consuming ten Blood Gems, its battle strength was already on par with an ordinary marquis.

At marquis Level, its speed picked up as well. In just a short moment, the Blood Puppet had already caught up with the Demon Soul Lord.

The Demon Soul Lord recovered her senses in a couple of minutes, but the Blood Puppet had already arrived and punched at her head.

“Damn it!”

The Demon Soul Lord panicked and she hurriedly waved the scarlet saber to parry the punch.

Unfortunately, the serious injury she had already sustained was aggravated. Her scarlet saber was thrown off and she spat mouthfuls of blood. She involuntarily retreated. Before she was able to stand firmly, a huge scarlet palm suddenly appeared behind her.

The scarlet palm had been formed by Jian Wushuang who was driving the Road to the Underworld. The scarlet palm punched her, stopping her retreat and pushing her back toward the Blood Puppet.

“No!”

The Demon Soul Lord howled desperately. She saw the Blood Puppet clench a fist and punch toward her head.

This time, she didn’t have any chance to escape.

Peng!

The Demon Soul Lord’s skull was crushed by the punch.

Witnessing this, the lords from both camps were dumbfounded.

Even the Black Yuan Lord was frightened.

The Demon Soul Lord, the superior lord in the Six-cloud Realm, was very powerful. Even the Black Yuan Lord who was better than the Demon Soul Lord didn’t have enough confidence to kill her.

But now, the Demon Soul Lord was dead!
