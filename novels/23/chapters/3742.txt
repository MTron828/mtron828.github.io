Chapter 3745: Acknowledgment

Three thousand years ago, when he first came to the Red Cloud World, the Earth Guard technique he created was still very young. It could only form one great Earth Sword Domain.

And the Earth at that time was still very pure.

But in these three thousand years, he had studied and studied under the Sword Stone. By now, he could form a total of twelve great Earth Sword Domains, most importantly, the 12 levels of the Earth Sword Domain contained an endless essence, which combined perfectly to make the 12 levels of the Earth Sword Domain stronger and more resilient.

After reaching this stage, although Jian Wushuang knew that the protective ability of his sword should be extremely strong, at the very least, he should be able to completely block an attack at the Advanced Ruler level. As for an attack at the Superior Ruler level…whether it could be blocked or not, he was not confident.

Now that he was fighting with a Superior Ruler, and Master Qing had used her strongest spear, she was unable to break through all 12 levels of the Earth Sword Domain, this made Jian Wushuang almost overjoyed!

Master Qing’s strongest spear was unable to break through all 12 levels of the Earth Sword Domain, which meant that the defensive ability of the Earth Guard was much stronger than she had imagined.

His 3,000 years of comprehension had not been in vain.

Unlike Jian Wushuang’s excitement, the people around him had long been shocked.

“Blood Sword Master.”

Master Qing looked at Jian Wushuang again, and her expression slowly disappeared, returning to her usual cold expression. “You are a Principles Master, so your battle strength is not weaker than an Advanced Ruler. I didn’t expect your defensive ability to be even more terrifying!

“Not only do you have an extremely powerful divine body, which can withstand thirty percent of my attack head-on without being damaged, but you also know such a terrifying defensive sword technique. With this defensive sword technique, I’m afraid that even among the top Rulers, only a handful of them have the ability to kill you. At the very least, among the top Rulers in this star area, no one should have this kind of power.”

Master Qing had spoken based on her own feelings. At least, that was what she thought. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

However, as soon as her words left her mouth, the surrounding void immediately erupted into an intense commotion.

“Heavens, Master Qing actually said that no one in this Star Field can kill the Blood Sword Master?”

“That’s normal. Didn’t you see how Master Qing unleashed her strongest spear, only to be completely blocked by the protective sword-art of the Blood Sword Master?”

“With that body-protecting sword-art and his extremely powerful divine body, none of the top Rulers in this Star Field would be able to do anything to him if they didn’t work together.”

“This Blood Sword Master is just a mere Principles Master. It’s one thing for him to be as powerful as a Senior Ruler, but I didn’t expect his life-saving ability to be so incredible. He’s really a monster.”

“We wanted to kill such a monster to fight for his wings? It’s just a pipe dream.”

Exclamations sounded one after another.

Master Qing spoke again, “Blood Sword Master, although you’re just a Principles Master, you have such powerful strength and life-saving means. It’s only right that the Supreme Flight Type True Treasure fell into your hands. You’re qualified to possess such a True Treasure.”

After saying that, Master Qing looked at Jian Wushuang seriously, then turned around, apparently intending to leave.

However, before she left, she glanced at Ruler Tyrant Axe, who was beside her. “Ruler Tyrant Axe, your Suppression-type True Treasure has been suppressing this place. Don’t tell me you want to keep me here as well?”

Ruler Tyrant Axe’s face changed.

Previously, he had used his Suppression-type True Treasure to suppress the void just to prevent Jian Wushuang from escaping. He had no intention of stopping Master Qing.

But now, Master Qing was going to leave because of his Suppression-type True Treasure.

Ruler Tyrant Axe gritted his teeth and looked at Master Qing, then at Jian Wushuang. He sighed in his heart.

“I thought Blood Sword Master was only a Principles Master. Although he’s strong, his ability to protect his body shouldn’t be that strong. As long as a few more Rulers join hands, I’m sure I can kill him. I didn’t expect Blood Sword Master’s ability to protect his body to be so strong that even Master Qing couldn’t do anything to him. I’m just an Advanced Ruler.”

Tyrant Axe shook his head. He did not persist any longer. With a wave of his hand, he withdrew the suppression formation in the surrounding void.

After the suppression formation was withdrawn, Master Qing left immediately.

“Master Qing has already left. Why? Do you two intend to stay and continue to be trampled by me?” Jian Wushuang looked at Tyrant Axe and Pupil Master with interest.

The Ruler Tyrant Axe and Pupil Master looked at each other in dismay.

“Master Blood Sword, you’re good.” The Ruler Tyrant Axe said and then turned to leave.

Pupil Master’s eyes flashed with a fierce light.

He had a grudge with Jian Wushuang. If he had the chance, he would not hesitate to deal with Jian Wushuang. However, now that Master Qing and the Ruler Tyrant Axe had left, he alone…he would be completely crushed by Jian Wushuang. Naturally, he did not dare to stay any longer.

Soon, the three Rulers left one after another.

Even the Rulers left. The Principles Masters around them did not have the slightest intention of fighting over it. Soon, they dispersed and left.

The fight for the strongest Flight Type True Treasure had finally come to an end.

…

Jian Wushuang was slowly moving forward in the void of the Third Continent in the Red Cloud World.

He was holding two messaging tokens in his hands. One belonged to the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master, and the other belonged to the Temporal Temple Master.

“My young friend, I admire you. You were able to defeat the Ruler Tyrant Axe and Pupil Master by yourself in the realm of Principles Master. You were even able to take three strikes from Master Qing head-on without any damage. Moreover, Master Qing paid a certain price to use his most powerful strike, but he was unable to break your protective sword skill. This really makes us Rulers feel ashamed,” The Temporal Temple Master exclaimed.

Temporal Temple Master knew that Jian Wushuang had obtained the lightest Flight Type Supreme Treasure, so he had rushed here as fast as he could.

However, on the way, he received news that Jian Wushuang’s crisis had been resolved, and he knew the process of the previous battle.

Even Temporal Temple Master, who had a certain understanding of Jian Wushuang, could not help but exclaim in admiration.

“Indeed. Master Qing is a genuine Superior Ruler. Her strongest spear attack could not even break your protective swordsmanship. Heavenly Sword Marquis, when did your protective swordsmanship become so powerful?” Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master could not help asking.
