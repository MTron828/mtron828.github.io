Chapter 2880: Waiting

——

In a secret room in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

Jian Wushuang took out a silver armor.

“This is…”

One of the Pavilion Masters stared at the silver armor with his eyes wide open.

He stared at the silver armor and felt its power.

“Sir, if I’m not mistaken, this should be a holy treasure level protective armor, right?” Although the Tower Master was only a Peak Great Divine Master, he was very knowledgeable and could tell the level of the armor at a glance.

“Cloud pattern armor is an ordinary third-grade holy treasure protective armor, but it’s not a natal armor,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Indeed.” The tower Master nodded slightly and then asked, “What do you want to exchange for it, sir?”

“A million sacred elixirs,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“A million sacred elixirs?” The Tower Master remained calm on the surface, but he was secretly delighted.

Even if it was not a natal armor, it was still very rare in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. Many Immortal Saints did not have such armor. The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion had several such armors, but who would complain about having too many treasures?

One million holy elixirs were nothing to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

It was worth it to exchange one million saint elixirs for a holy treasure-level armor.

“Please wait for a moment. I’ll send someone to deliver the saint elixirs immediately,” the Tower Master said.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

One million saint elixirs was not a small amount. The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion alone certainly did not have them. Naturally, they had to be delivered from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

Jian Wushuang waited quietly in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. It did not take long for the Tower Master to deliver an interspatial ring to him.

Jian Wushuang checked it carefully and left without making any mistakes.

Jian Wushuang walked on the street of the market, looking around from time to time.

“I didn’t put on any disguise when I entered the market, even when I just entered the Dragon-phoenix Tower. If the Realm Lord Tian Qu used an intelligence organization, he could easily find me. He should know that I’m in the market now, and he might even have rushed out of the market. However, the market is controlled by the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion has a clear rule that no killing is allowed in the market. No matter what, I’m afraid that Realm Lord Tian Qu has to give face to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.”

“No matter how much he wants to kill me, he can only do it after I leave the market. I shouldn’t be in any trouble now,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Now that I’ve got the saint elixirs, I’ll find a place to refine them first. I’ll leave the market after I’ve broken through to Senior Divine Master and have the confidence to face sector Lord Jiu Qu head-on.”

Having made up his mind, Jian Wushuang immediately found a secret room in the market and began to cultivate in seclusion.

As Jian Wushuang had expected, the Realm Lord had already known about his presence in the market.

At this moment, four figures stood in the void outside the market.

They were the Realm Lord, Chi Ming, the Young Master of the Star Point Pavilion, and Elder Su, the black-robed Elder. The last one was a middle-aged man in a purple robe, who looked extremely warm and kind, with an intoxicating smile on his face.

However, it was precisely this kind of middle-aged man who had a fearsome reputation in the Golden Crow Nine Realms.

He was the Heavenly Void Palace Master, an extremely tyrannical and cruel Immortal Saint. He was also a Realm Lord.

In terms of strength, he might not be comparable to Realm Lord Tian Qu, but in terms of ferocity, he was a level higher than Realm Lord Tian Qu.

“I’ve already received the exact news. After Jian Yi came out of the Dragon-Phoenix Tower, he immediately found a secret room and began his closed-door cultivation.” Elder Su said.

“Cultivate?” Realm Master Tian Qu and Temple Master Tianxu’s faces darkened.

After reaching the level of Great Divine Master, many Great Divine Masters lost track of time when they cultivated in seclusion. Many Great Divine Masters spent hundreds, thousands, or even longer in seclusion.

Jian Wushuang was staying in the market. Because of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, they did not dare to kill him in the market. They could only wait outside. What if they waited for hundreds, thousands of years?

“We have no choice. After all, this is the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City, the territory of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. Even if we are one of the four pavilions, we have to give a face to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. We can not easily violate the rules set by the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion in the market. Otherwise, we will offend the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion will definitely attack. Even if they can’t kill us, they can teach us a lesson,” Elder Su said.

No one dared to look down on one of the four most ancient pavilions in the Golden Crow Nine Realms.

The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s foundation was very solid. Although on the surface, the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion only had a few Immortal Saints, Elder Su was very clear that if the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion really got close to their territory… the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion had the ability to keep all three of them here.

The Heavenly Void Palace Lord and Realm Lord were very clear about this. Hence, they did not dare to go against the rules of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

In the entire Golden Crow Nine Realms, there was only one person who dared to go against the rules of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. That person was Lord Bone Emperor. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

That Lord Bone Emperor was extremely powerful. He could do whatever he wanted in the Golden Crow Nine Realms and did not need to worry about the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. However, that Lord Bone Emperor would not do so easily.

“In other words, we can only wait here for Jian Yi to come out of his closed-door cultivation?” Realm Lord Tian Qu asked in a low voice.

“This is the only way.” Elder Su nodded slightly. “Not according to what I know, Jian Yi is an out-and-out super genius. In the entire Golden Crow Nine Realms, other than the Young Phoenix of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, I’m afraid that no one can compare to him. In addition, his rise speed is extremely fast. In just a short 100 years, a super genius whose strength has risen so quickly wouldn’t be able to stay in closed-door cultivation for too long. I estimate that he would be able to come out of closed-door cultivation in at most a few decades or even a few years.”

“Realm Lord Tian Qu, Heavenly Void Palace Lord, the two of you shouldn’t care about this little bit of time, right?”

“I’m not in a rush. In any case, there’s nothing much to do in my Heavenly Void World.” The Great Void Palace Lord smiled.

“Hmph, the moment this sword killed my son, I can’t wait to kill him right now. The longer he lives, the angrier I feel. However, for the sake of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, I’ll let him live for a little longer.” The Heavenly Void Palace Lord clenched his hands tightly, he coldly spoke.

“Since that’s the case, let’s wait here. I’ve already sent people to keep an eye on him. As long as he comes out of the secret chamber, my people will immediately send a message to me.” Elder Su said.
