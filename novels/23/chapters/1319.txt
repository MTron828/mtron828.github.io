Chapter 1320: Alive or Dead?

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Outside the Tribunal Passing Pinnacle, countless experts held their breath as they watched everything that was happening on the Tribunal Passing Pinnacle.

They could feel Jian Wushuang’s rage clearly, and they could tell how tough the test was that Jian Wushuang was going through.

But at that very moment, Jian Wushuang, who was mad, suddenly lifted his head and stared into the void before him with his bloodshot eyes.

In those bloodshot eyes, they were covered in a murderous aura and madness. However, there was a stronger sense of determination!

“I, Jian Wushuang, cultivated till today. I have been following my conscience whenever I do anything. Although I have killed many, those who are killed deserved it!”

“I never fail my conscience!”

“I never fail anyone!”

“Nor have I failed the Way of Heaven!”

“Now, you are trying to influence me with just the devil? Dream on!!”

Jian Wushuang’s shrill scream was heard across the universe. The very moment he shouted, he hammered his chest with his fist.

“Poof!”

Jian Wushuang spat a mouthful of blood but it stimulated his consciousness with the sharp pain. In turn, it suppressed the devil in him that was growing. Followed by Jian Wushuang’s will power, the Star power that had regathered in his body for the past century suddenly erupted!

The Secret Skill of Star Palace was suddenly carried out.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang waved his hand and a scroll appeared from nowhere. It was the Chaos Divine Treasure, Mountain River Map.

“Up!”

Jian Wushuang bellowed and the power of Star suddenly erupted along with the remaining Soul Power in his body. Then, it flowed towards the Mountain River Map without holding back.

Under the drive of the Soul Power, the Mountain River Map opened directly.

The very next moment… Vroom!

The extreme power of the dark and light combined together flawlessly, and a swirling vortex of black and white appeared from nowhere.

The swirling vortex immediately covered a range of hundreds of thousand miles the moment it appeared and it ceaselessly grew larger in lightning speed while Jian Wushuang was positioned right in the middle of the whirlpool.

The Grand Formation of the Enduring Samsara!

It was the most impressive technique of Master Xuan Yi, Jian Wushuang’s master. He forcefully refined the Grand Formation of the Enduring Samsara within the Mountain River Map!

The formation refined and suddenly became a technique that the Mountain River Map that could use!

Different from the Nine-province Seal, the Grand Formation of the Enduring Samsara could both attack and defend. Jian Wushuang could only put the technique to play when he disregarded the cost. In collaboration with the eruption of the Secret Skill of Star Palace, it became Jian Wushuang’s strongest trump card.

Then, he used the trump card to resist the thunder test and fire test that descended from the sky!

“Come on!”

Jian Wushuang was persistent. His entire body and mind were drowning in the struggle of the mind test.

In the outer world, the two lightning rods and the huge swirling vortex of black and white clashed before every cultivator’s eyes.

Boom!!!

The explosion was heard across the universe.

The scary whistle spread and the experts surrounding Tribunal Passing Pinnacle felt a sharp pain in their eyes.

Boundless dark lighting and emerald flame filled every corner of Tribunal Passing Pinnacle.

Poof poof poof!!

The spine-chilling sight took place.

The peak of Tribunal Passing Pinnacle which was specially designated for undergoing God’s Test started disappearing at a speed which one could see with naked eyes.

Yes, disappear.

From the top to the bottom, the entire peak was eaten up by the emerald flames mercilessly.

While Jian Wushuang who was on the peak was naturally within the scope of the disaster.

It only took a brief moment until everything slowed down. Everyone saw that the peak of Tribunal Passing Pinnacle had disappeared entirely. Not only the peak, but even half of the hillsides were also taken down. The only part remaining was the bottom half of the Tribunal Passing Pinnacle.

Silence!

The entire universe was in dead silence!

Everyone was shocked and was left speechless.

The terrifying God’s Test, an unprecedented God’s Test, shocked everyone.

Every expert from all over the world only came back to reality after a long pause.

The moment they came back to reality, they immediately looked towards the Tribunal Passing Pinnacle that was beyond recognition.

“Jian Wushuang? Where’s Jian Wushuang?”

Everyone stared at the huge pit on Tribunal Passing Pinnacle. The pit was so deep that they couldn’t see the bottom. With their naked eyes, they couldn’t see the bottom clearly.

They could only rely on their own consciousness to feel.

They tried to feel…

“No sound!”

“No sound at all,”

“Is he dead?”

Everyone became silent.

They couldn’t feel any movement on Tribunal Passing Pinnacle. It meant that Jian Wushuang… passed away.

“Sigh!”

The Master of Scarlet Island sighed but his emotion was extremely complicated.

Those behind the Master of Scarlet Island were Universe Gods from the Scarlet Island. They exchanged glances and shook their head.

God’s Test was a situation which, out of ten, one would survives and nine would be dead. Hence, they were mentally prepared beforehand.

However, when Jian Wushuang revealed his impressive ability during the process of undergoing God’s Test, they were looking forward to Jian Wushuang passing through it.

Because once he passed through, it represented the birth of a true expert.

But in the end… He failed.

“Sigh!”

Universe God Jiu Hai from Holy Prefecture let out a heavy breath.

“Luckily he failed in the end. Otherwise…” Universe God Jiu Hai exclaimed. He recalled the process of the God’s Test and he who was a Universe God in the Second Heaven was shocked too.

He couldn’t imagine what he would do if Jian Wushuang passes through the God’s Test?

By then, would he still have the guts to look for Jian Wushuang to take revenge?

Luckily, Jian Wushuang failed. Hence, whatever it was, it naturally wouldn’t happen.

The Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang stood side by side in the void above.

“It’s such a pity,” the Master of Dayu Palace let out a sigh.

“It’s really a pity,” Wu Cang nodded solemnly, “A true prodigy. There might not be anyone from Snow Dojo who could be compared favorably with him. If he were to pass through the Inverse Cultivation Test, he was destined to become a real Peak expert. He is definitely far beyond me, but he failed in the end!”

“Of course, we can’t blame him. The Inverse Cultivation Test was really too scary!”

Thinking of the Inverse Cultivation Test that Jian Wushuang had been through, Wu Cang still felt astonished.

The Inverse Cultivation Test was a definite nightmare.

Everyone sighed!

Everyone sighed with respect. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

More so that everyone thought it was regrettable for Jian Wushuang.

At the depth of the pit, King of Venomous Worms stared at Tribunal Passing Pinnacle.

“Jian Wushuang!!!”

“No way, it’s impossible!”

“If you were to really be dead, I, as your parasite, should definitely feel something. But I don’t feel anything!”

“We still maintain a string of connection. It means that you aren’t dead!”

King of Venomous King was emotional and his mind and body were trembling. He let out his sensing power and tried his best to look for Jian Wushuang’s whereabouts.

In a brief moment, the King of Venomous Worms felt an extremely weak aura that might vanish into thin air at any time in the deepest part of the huge pit on Tribunal Passing Pinnacle.
