4750 A Brief Confrontation

Ding Beichun grinned, his eyes never leaving the Tarot Divine Sword. “Don’t worry. There’s no True Sword that I, Ding Beichun, can’t handle.”

“Speaking of which, to be able to use such a True Sword, Brother Jian must have already comprehended his own Sword Dao.”

The Young Emperor smiled and then raised his eyebrows. “Beichun, if I say that his Sword Dao and Sword Intent will definitely not be inferior to your Master’s in the future, would you believe me?”

Ding Beichun raised his head and looked at Jian Wushuang in disbelief. “Surpass my Master? Brother Yan, don’t joke with me. So far, I’ve never seen anyone who can surpass my Master in the Sword Dao.”

“Then you’ve seen it now,” the Young Emperor said.

The light in Ding Beichun’s eyes grew brighter. “Brother Jian, you’re a Sword Immortal?”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang shook his head and smiled bitterly. “I can’t be considered a Sword Immortal. At most, I have my own comprehension of Sword Dao.”

“That’s great! I’ve been cultivating swordsmanship with my Master for a long time. I only started forging swords when my swordsmanship came to a standstill,” Ding Beichun said excitedly. “Brother Jian, why don’t we have a spar? It’s been a long time since I’ve sparred with someone else.”

“Nonsense, we’re here,” the Young Emperor was stopped by Jian Wushuang before he could finish.

He said, “We have nothing to do anyway. Why don’t Brother Beichun and I have a spar here?”

“I’ll go and prepare now.” After Ding Beichun said this, he hurriedly leaped toward the cauldron that was tens of thousands of feet tall.

Ding Beichun used a huge force to turn the lid of the cauldron. He threw the Tarot Divine Sword into the cauldron in a hurry, then flew back to the two of them.

“I say, you just threw the sword in like this. Is it going to be fine?” The Young Emperor was puzzled.

“Don’t worry. If you want to reforge a sword, the first step is to melt the Sword Embryo. I know what to do.” Ding Beichun could not wait any longer. “Brother Jian, shall we start?”

Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile. He took a step back and moved a thousand feet away. He had already formed a battle formation.

Ding Beichun did not say anything else. He raised his hand, and a True Sword broke through the sky and fell into his palm.

As he held the True Sword, the aura of his entire person condensed. It was as if he had taken out an ultimate sword from his box and pressed forward with an indomitable will.

The iron chips fell off, slowly revealing a handsome face. His bare upper body seemed to have sword principle and flowing clouds and water patterns.

Jian Wushuang held his breath and concentrated. The Invisible Longsword formed by the Wushuang sword principle appeared in his hand.

Ding Beichun’s eyes glowed even more brightly when he saw this. Even though he had observed countless Sword Dao, he had only seen someone who could materialize the Sword Dao a few times.

And to be able to do this, they were all great swordsmen.

The Young Emperor retreated helplessly when he saw this scene.

When sword fanatics faced each other, no one could dissuade them.

In the next moment, Ding Beichun took the lead, bringing with him a vast Sword Intent.

In just an instant, the two swords faced each other, and the blades collided.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

It looked like one sword clash, but in reality, they had exchanged tens of thousands of moves!

The sharp longsword swung wildly. At that moment, Ding Beichun seemed to be immersed in the forging of the sword. He slashed down rapidly without any fancy moves.

If it was any other Yan immortal, they would have died under this attack.

Even Jian Wushuang felt great pressure. This guy could not only swing the hammer, but also swing the sword without any hesitation.

Although Jian Wushuang did not retreat from the attack, the ground under his feet had cracked.

However, in the next exchange, Ding Beichun’s True Sword could no longer adapt to such a high-intensity confrontation and was directly cut in half by Jian Wushuang.

“Exhilarating.” Ding Beichun, who had been forced back a thousand feet by the sword strike, laughed out loud. He casually threw away the broken sword and retrieved a True Sword from the sky.

“Brother Jian, it’s my Sword Intent next,” He said in a deep voice, and the flowing clouds and water ripples on his body began to surge.

Yan power in the entire heavenly chasm seemed to have been awakened by him. He brought along a huge amount of purple-red lava and conjured a precious image behind him.

An indescribable heavy pressure hit his face. Jian Wushuang took half a step back with his right foot and held the Invisible Longsword in front of him.

He was extremely calm as he looked at the 30,000-meter-tall treasure form in front of him, as if he was used to it.

After Ding Beichun had formed the Sword Intent image form, he raised the True Sword in his hand and slashed at Jian Wushuang.

Rumble! Boom boom!

The space was torn apart, and the purple-red lava was surging. The image form was not holding a long sword in its hand, but a blunt weapon.

The blunt weapon that was as heavy as a ten-thousand-ton hammer smashed down heavily. At this moment, Jian Wushuang also summoned a move of the Sword River Lake Sea Sword Intent.

The Star-style Sword Intent was fully unleashed, and an unparalleled image form that was also 10,000-feet in size descended, clasping its palms together to meet the attack.

When the Young Emperor saw this, he immediately flew away.

Boom!!!

An unparalleled explosion occurred. The two image forms were destroyed at the same time, causing the heavens and earth to shake. Endless squalls violently tore open the space.

Almost at the same time as the two forms collided, a black-clothed Ranger broke through the explosion and slashed at Ding Beichun.

Clang!

Ding Beichun hurriedly raised his sword to resist, but he did not expect the True Sword in his hand to be directly cut into two.

The tip of a sword that seemed to be condensed from flowing clouds was then pressed against his neck.

Everything happened too quickly. From the first confrontation to the first collision of the sword principles, only 100 breaths had passed.

However, it was in these 100 breaths of time that the current situation was formed.

Even if Jian Wushuang’s sword strike could not kill him directly, it could at least severely injure him. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

In a collision of this level, if one was seriously injured, the only outcome was death.

However, Ding Beichun could not believe that he had been defeated just like that. He had lost so smoothly and easily.

He was a little aggrieved. He had only used the first move of his Sword Dao, but it had ended up like this.

Jian Wushuang left a deep impression on him.

His moves were ruthless, and he did not drag things out at all. He was a very strong opponent.

Jian Wushuang seemed to have seen the frustration in Ding Beichun’s eyes. He smiled and retreated a thousand feet away with his longsword on his back.

“Again.”

Ding Beichun’s eyes brightened. Although he knew the gap between him and Jian Wushuang, he was not willing to give up such an opportunity. He chose to fight again.

This time, he did not draw the True Sword from the sky. Instead, like Jian Wushuang, he slowly formed an Invisible Longsword.

It was a blade that was formed from one’s own comprehension of the sword Dao, and it was the most suitable for the Master. The Invisible Sword was essentially a formless sword that a swordsman could condense and fight with.

However, since there was no sword blade that could be materialized, the power that was unleashed was extremely unstable.

For example, although Ding Beichun had also condensed an Invisible Sword, his Sword Intent was fluctuating so violently that it seemed like it could dissipate at any moment.

However, Jian Wushuang’s Invisible Longsword had never been unstable.

This was the impasse Sword Intent that he had comprehended in the desolate Land of Sorrows, and it had long been tempered to its peak.
