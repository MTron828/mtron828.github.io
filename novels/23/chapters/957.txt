Chapter 958: Mountain and Rivers as the Palm; Nine Continents as the Seal

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The earth-shattering roar lingered in the world, dissipating only after a long time had passed.

The countless martial artists present felt a jolt down their spirits after hearing the roar. They were shaking from the bottom of their hearts.

A mere roar from him had vanquished the top Dao Masters of the Xia clan, including the Holy Master Xia Yong!

What kind of absurd strength was this?

“Six-star Supreme Ancient God? Even approaching the Seven-star level?”

Even Gu Tong, who was a Seven-star Imperial Ancient God, could not help feeling startled after seeing this scene.

“I understand now. This youngster was likely harboring a drop of Blood Essence that one of the Ancient Gods left behind and that Ancient God must be particularly strong, perhaps much stronger than me at my peak!”

“What a pity. With such a drop of Blood Essence, he would’ve become a Six-star Imperial Ancient God in the future at the very least. But now that he has forcefully engulfed it, he has completely wasted it. Not only that, it’s hard to say if he’ll even survive it.”

Gu Tong quietly muttered to himself. Yet he also understood that Jian Wushuang had no other choice under the current circumstances.

His only option was to forcefully engulf the Ancient God Power in the drop of Blood Essence and fight for a chance of survival.

“Unfortunately, only one person can refine the imparted drop of Blood Essence. Otherwise… such a powerful drop is enough to help me recover at least half of my strength. It would be so much easier to break out of this Life-devouring Formation then. But we can only depend on this youngster now,” Gu Tong said to himself.

All eyes were on Jian Wushuang.

Earlier, they had harbored only a small hope and wished only for Jian Wushuang to create another miracle. Now that they detected his terrifying aura and powerful strength, their hope became more and more intense.

Perhaps, just perhaps, Jian Wushuang might be able to create another miracle.

Jian Wushuang continued to hover in the Void after letting out the roar, feeling the explosive Ancient God Power within him easing a little. He abruptly raised his head and glared at Dao Yuanzi with a pair of eyes that harbored an intense killing intent.

Then, in the next second, he made his move.

Jian Wushuang stepped forward, his every step so heavy that it crushed the Void. His every step easily spanned a thousand miles.

In just a few steps, he found himself in front of the defensive cover that enveloped Dao Yuanzi. He then threw a punch with his large hand, sending a flowing light flying at Dao Yuanzi.

“What did he sent out?”

Since everyone was staring fixedly at Jian Wushuang, they had obviously noticed his actions. They wanted to find out what that flying light was.

Soon, they saw what it was.

The flying light was actually a peerlessly beautiful picture scroll. The picture scroll unveiled itself along with Jian Wushuang’s tossing motion and vanished into the world shortly after.

Just as everyone was puzzled over Jian Wushuang’s actions…

“Buzz!” The strange radiance suddenly flared. The endless blue dome of heaven above them began to undergo changes.

“What’s wrong?”

“W-What is this?”

Everyone stared wide-eyed at what was unfolding in the sky, stupefied.

Even Dao Yuanzi, who was still under the defensive cover, looked up.

They watched as the large and splendid World Scroll thoroughly took over the vast sky.

The World Scroll that covered the entire blue dome of heaven slowly flowed like running water. Everyone stared fixedly at it and for a moment, they saw a vast and inconceivable world in it.

The mountains and rivers in the world made for a breathtaking vista.

The most attention-grabbing detail was the nine continents that stood in nine different nooks of this immense world.

Any of the continents was far larger than the Tang Kingdom of the East, even exceeding that of the entire Ancient World. Inside those continents were countless cities and people. The people that lived there were like real living beings, their aura as strong as that of the martial artists of the Ancient World.

Everyone could not help immersing themselves in the World Scroll.

Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang was already standing next to Dao Yuanzi.

He lifted his right hand and his enhanced Ancient God Power flowed frantically into his palm. The terrifying power had completely condensed in the hollow of his palm.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes abruptly focused on Dao Yuanzi. Pale golden light flitted across his pupils.

“Mountain River Map?”

“Mountains and rivers as the palm, nine continents as the seal!”

Jian Wushuang paused between each word, which contained a special kind of magical power. One of the nine continents that were larger than the entire Ancient World within the World Scroll appeared to have come to life. It even felt as if the continent was slowly emerging out of the scroll as a real entity.

“Boom!”

The continent was emerging out of the scroll.

It was something unreal, something that existed only in the scroll. Yet it had truly stepped out of the World Scroll.

The scroll emerged out of the scroll countless times smaller but it was still large enough to cast a shadow over the imperial palace.

The scroll’s might was so terrifying that everyone could feel goosebumps.

“Oh God!”

“W-What kind of skill is this?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“He created an entire continent? Or is this a world? It’s actually real!”

“Unbelievable! This skill is unbelievable!”

Voices layered with disbelief and shock reverberated in the air like explosions.

Jian Wushuang’s terrifying skill had exceeded everyone’s imagination.

Even experienced and knowledgeable ones like Emperor Xiao, Emperor Yun, and the rest had never seen such an unbelievable skill.

How did a continent emerge out of a scroll like it was real?

Even Dao Yuanzi was startled when he saw the towering continent that had appeared above his head.

This sort of skill had shocked even him.

Right at this moment, Jian Wushuang was shrouded in a killing intent so intense that it made others tremble.

“Dao Yuanzi!”

The ear-splitting roar burst out of Jian Wushuang’s mouth, once again causing a destructive storm in the air.

“You shouldn’t come to this world!”

“You shouldn’t lay down this Life-devouring Formation at the cost of millions of innocent lives just to forge your so-called Blood-cessation Demon Body!”

“For the sake of the Tang of the East and the millions of people here, you must die!”

“The Qing Province of the Nine Provinces act as the seal that split open the heavens!”

“Boom!”

The continent that originated from the scroll had completely descended on this world!
