Chapter 1015: You Again!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“So it’s true?” God Hong said in astonishment. Those experts who followed him here also looked stunned.

When first hearing the news from Qing Bin, they seriously doubted it. But now they had to believe what they saw.

Indeed, Jian Wushuang killed the eight Dao Masters of the Black Python Clan with just a move.

“How did he do that?” God Hong couldn’t help thinking.

Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang who had been the focus between heaven and earth suddenly raised his head. In the distance, he saw several figures fly towards him and appeared in front of him instantly.

Certainly, they were the Clan Leader and the remaining Dao Masters of the Black Python Clan.

The overall strength of the Black Python Clan was much better than that of the Rock Demon Clan. Certainly, the Black Python Clan included more Dao Masters. Except the eight killed by Jian Wushuang, there were still six left. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Damn it!”

The Leader of the Black Python Clan was the insidious man with a small black snake on his shoulder. Watching the eight bodies on the ground, he looked extremely sullen, shaking violently.

There were eight Dao Masters. Their Black Python Clan had only fourteen Dao Masters in total. Now more than half of them had been killed by Jian Wushuang.

Naturally, the insidious man felt so distressed.

Nevertheless, regardless of his distress, he witnessed Jian Wushuang’s great strength.

He had watched the fight in the Void not far away. His original plan was that the eight Dao Masters led numerous experts of the Black Python Clan to fight their way to the city of the Rock Demon Clan. Then, he and other Dao Masters awaited the badly hurt God Hong. Finally, they would immediately kill him the moment he showed up.

However, no one had expected that a Sword Principle expert just at Eternal Realm level showed up and killed all the eight Dao Masters before God Hong showed up.

Jian Wushuang’s move also shocked him tremendously.

It was so fast.

It was so fast that there was not enough time for him to rescue them.

“Where does the brat come from? When did the Rock Demon Clan have such an incredible expert at Eternal Realm level?” The insidious man fixed his eyes on Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang glanced up at him as well, but soon his eyes rested on a black-robed elder.

“Well, I didn’t expect that I would meet an acquaintance. We are really enemies on a narrow road!” Jian Wushuang said in a cold voice.

“Kid, you again?” The black-robed elder also raised his head. He glanced at Jian Wushuang in astonishment.

Jian Wushuang immediately recognized the black-robed elder was the expert from the Sky-devouring Clan. The elder and Jin Yu joined forced to ambush Dragon Wing Governor and him.

Likewise, the black-robed elder Di Yan also recognized Jian Wushuang.

“So you are the expert who helps the Black Python Clan?” Jian Wushuang asked with a faint smile.

“That’s right.” Di Yan nodded and said in a cold voice, “Brat, you stopped me from killing Dragon Wing Governor before. Today I’m going to help the Black Python Clan exterminate the Rock Demon Clan, and you are going to spoil my plan again? You seem to have a problem with me, right?”

“I was indebted to the Rock Demon Clan. If you are going to kill them, I have no choice but to fight with you.” Jian Wushuang said coolly.

Di Yan’s face suddenly darkened.

“Master Di Yan, that’s enough. Just kill him!” The insidious man beside him urged in a cold voice.

“Shut up!” Glancing at the insidious man, Di Yan snapped in a deep voice. “You think it’s so easy to kill this brat?”

Di Yan had gone through Jian Wushuang’s horrible defensive ability. These days, he could still feel a dull pain inside his broken teeth.

To kill Jian Wushuang?

It was impossible for him.

“If he’s helping the Rock Demon Clan, it’ll be quite difficult for you to exterminate them.” Di Yan said in a deep voice.

“How come? No matter how powerful the brat is, he’s just at Eternal Realm level. Can’t you killed him with all your full strength?” The insidious man refused to yield. He ground his teeth with rage, while his eyes turned red.

“Master Di Yan, if you can kill him with all your strength, I can pay you thirty percent more of the reward I’ve promised!” The insidious man encouraged coldly.

“Oh?” Di Yan said, raising his eyebrows.

He was not familiar with the Black Python Clan. The reason why he decided to help the Black Python Clan was that the insidious man promised him a lovely reward.

Now he could get paid thirty percent more… It was rather tempting for Di Yan.

“I can promise you to kill him with all my strength, but I can’t make any guarantee.” Di Yan said.

“As long as you help us, I’ll pay you thirty percent more regardless of the result!” The insidious man said, clenching his hands, “I don’t believe that our preparations during the past years will be ruined by a nobody who is just at Eternal Realm level.”

“Well, I will do my best.” Di Yan said and moved at the next moment.

But on his way toward Jian Wushuang, Di Yan sneered secretly, “He’s so dumb as to trust me. He knows nothing about the brat’s horrifying defensive ability. I can’t kill him even with my full strength. But since he’s willing to pay thirty percent more more, I’ll put on a good show for him.”

Di Yan didn’t think about killing Jian Wushuang at all. He just wanted to pretend to go all out and then be defeated by Jian Wushuang. In the end, he could get the extra thirty percent reward.

Watching Di Yan coming towards him, Jian Wushuang had a weird smile on his face.

Jian Wushuang thought, “At that time, outside of Jin Yu’s castle, I was still at a disadvantage when I engaged the old fellow. I could only make him leave using my defensive ability. Back then I didn’t create any Sword Principle nor incredible swordsmanship, but now…

“I’ve created two Sword Principles and been able to unleash their power at the same time. Besides, I’ve created two matching unique swordsmanships to greatly promote their battle strength.

“I’m wondering what will happen if I fight with the old fellow again today.”

Jian Wushuang wore a cold look and was eager to fight.

“Kill!”

With tremendous battle intent, Jian Wushuang shouted in a deep voice. As he moved, he had a face-to-face collision with Di Yan who came towards him.

A burst of overwhelming Sword Essence immediately exploded at the moment they collided.

Jian Wushuang held Blood Mountain Sword tightly with one hand, while Blood Mountain Sword was trembling and emitting bursts of overwhelming power. As fierce lights flashed in his eyes, he shot Blood Mountain Sword directly toward Di Yan.

This move was extremely cold and emotionless.

This move was created by Jian Wushuang based on his first Sword Principle, the Coalescence Sword Principle.

This move was named Ruthlessness!
