Chapter 5251: Why Bother?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Now there were only a few thousand Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals, and a thousand 2-Star Devouring Demons; they could still bear the burden.

But when there were millions of 2-Star Devouring Demons, how much could other strong beings share the load?

When there were a million Devouring Demons, it caused the Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals to lose half of their number. This time, they might face extinction.

Such a pity! Jian Wushuang sighed softly. When the horns sounded again, he instantly moved to the sky outside the city.

In the third wave, there were tens of millions of I-Star Devouring Demons, worth 100 thousand treasure points each.

Now, in the sixth wave, there were a million treasure points, although he couldnt monopolize them. Still, he could manage to seize half of them.

He had accumulated nearly 100,000 points again. If he could seize half this time, with the generals bonus included, he would have enough to exchange for the Candle Dragon Wings.T/his chapter is updatùìÆd by nùíêv(√™(l)biin.co/m

This treasure was immensely helpful to him. Apart from the increase in speed and defense, the enhancement in the Beast God Domain alone could make him much stronger. Probably, he would possess the combat power of a half-step Emperor.

With the amplification of his divine body and the formidable defense of the Candle Dragon Wings, if he were to face Heavenly Emperor Wan Xing, he was confident he could fight.

At that time, on this Original Planet, he could truly stride across with unparalleled arrogance.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang even had an evil thought: if he devoured all the Grand Yan Immortals on this Original Planet, he might take another step forward.

As soon as this idea crossed his mind, he quickly dismissed it. Leaving aside the feasibility of this method, considering the trial on the Original Planet now, it was probably going to be challenging later on, unlike the first stage, with chaotic battles everywhere.

The Qishen Temple had opened its treasure vaults. With such a massive investment in treasures, there was no way they would let things go back to how they were in the past. They wouldnt allow him to run amok either.

Jian Wushuang had always believed that within the Qishen Temple, there were still ancient powerhouses alive. Otherwise, the internal world wouldnt operate so smoothly. There were too many hidden secrets. Perhaps they would only understand the true nature of the Qishen Temple once they left the Original

Planet.

The sound of horns buzzed, echoing in everyones ears.

The sixth wave of Devouring Demons.

This was a barrier, a hurdle for Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals, and also a threshold for some top-level Grand Yan Immortals.

Because after passing this hurdle, the days of top-level Grand Yan Immortals wouldnt be easy. Even peak-level Grand Yan Immortals would find it hard to endure the waves that followed.

The seventh wave began, featuring 3-Star Devouring Demons, possessing the combat power of a top-level Grand Yan Immortal. It started with a mere 100,000, escalating to millions later on.

What did millions of top-level Grand Yan Immortal points represent? Even Dao Lord-level experts might fall.

But that was also the time when treasure points were earned the most crazily.

Tens of millions of treasure points!

Items like imitation Eternal Treasures could be exchanged casually. Precious treasures could all be exchanged. One could exchange half of the treasures in the treasure vault.

There were too many treasures for immortal bodies, divine body enhancements, and origin source comprehension. It was possible to ascend in a single step.

Such temptation was irresistible. How could it not drive people insane?

In the midst of countless Devouring Demons, towering and menacing, their presence dominated the skies, casting a shadow over the land. The air was thick with their malevolent aura, unsettling the breath of those below.

Jian Wushuang stood tall in the void, his form akin to a dancing shadow, a solitary figure in this vast expanse of heaven and earth.

Looking back, a hundred thousand cultivators, regardless of their strength, wore grave expressions. Though they numbered in the millions, the gleam in their eyes revealed a profound determination; a determination that Jian Wushuang understood intimately the resolute spirit of never regretting, fighting to the death.

To fight with all ones might, and never regret even unto death.

Kill a murmured word, its origin unknown, spread among them. Gradually, every voice joined the chorus.

Kill!

The ferocity in the air matched that of the myriad Devouring Demons. Even Jian Wushuang found himself swept up in the battle cry, his spirit aflame with the same murderous intent.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Jian Wushuang, a force to be reckoned with, his divine sword unsheathed with a resounding clang, charged into the midst of the countless Devouring Demons.

He was not alone; others like him, such as Si Tian, accompanied by half-step Dao Lords and extreme-level Grand Yan Immortals, surged into the ranks of the Devouring Demon Army.

Meanwhile, the hundred thousand Grand Yan Immortals formed orderly formations, confronting the Devouring Demon Army head-on in a massive array. Life and death were long forgotten; all that remained in their eyes was madness.

Hiss!

In the moment of their clash, numerous Devouring Demons perished, their forms dissolving into a pitch-black mist that dispersed into the vast expanse of the heavens and earth.

In the initial exchanges, the courage of the fighters held strong, and the losses were minimal. However, as they faced the unending tide of Devouring Demons, they gradually found themselves unable to withstand the onslaught.

These were 2-Star Devouring Demons, comparable to Perfected Nine Revolutions, much stronger than their I-Star counterparts.

The Grand Yan Immortals formation quickly began to crumble. The first to succumb were the 6,000 Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals. Though they formed a battle formation, their Yan power operated in a frenzy, consuming too much, rendering them unable to endure. In the end, the grand formation collapsed, breached by over ten thousand Devouring Demons, each with two stars.

The 6,000 Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals, facing the onslaught of over 10,000 2-Star Devouring Demons, were merely a brief obstacle. Blood claws slashed through the air, instantly claiming half of their numbers.

Many Grand Yan Immortals with weaker divine bodies and physical forms were torn apart with a single swipe, their corpses ripped asunder.

The Devouring Demons recklessly grabbed the shattered bodies, tearing into them with wide jaws.

You all, shall die! An expert in golden armor blocked a breach with a swipe of his claws. Unlike the other Devouring Demons, his sharp claws transformed into golden dragons, majestic and powerful. Single-handedly, he defeated tens of thousands of 2-Star Devouring Demons.

However, his arrival was a bit too late. In just a few breaths, these Devouring Demons had killed all the Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals, leaving none alive.

Destroy them!

In a short span, the golden-armored powerhouse tore apart thousands of Devouring Demons.

But he was not unscathed!

His golden armor was now covered in black blood; his disheveled hair was stained with blood, and his face was marred by filth.

Although he looked down upon the weaker Grand Yan Immortals, considering them mere cannon fodder, witnessing these Devouring Demons tearing apart their own kind and devouring them, he couldnt help but charge into battle.

In the previous waves, he had killed numerous Devouring Demons, and with the added benefits from his general position, he had gained quite a few treasure points. After exchanging them for a set of Innate Treasures, he had returned to his peak. With his strong foundation, he was no weaker than those half-step Dao Lords.

Why do you even bother! MO Long, gazing at the fragmented bodies all around him, held pity and regret in his eyes.

Yet, in this battlefield, countless battles raged on.bender

Top-level Grand Yan Immortals were falling, and peak-level Grand Yan Immortals were having their physical forms damaged, their divine bodies collapsing, and their origin sources on the verge of extinguishing.

The ones truly able to hold their ground on the battlefield were the extreme-level Grand Yan Immortals and the half-step Dao Lords.

Jian Wushuang and Dao Lord Si Tian were like two suns, shining deep within the ranks of millions of Devouring Demons.

These 2-Star Devouring Demons couldnt even scratch Jian Wushuang. Even now, surrounded by millions of Devouring Demons, he remained as composed as ever..
