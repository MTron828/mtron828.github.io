Chapter 5227: Karmic Lines

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

On this side, Hu Qing was different. His strength was genuine, an absolute

Dao Lord power, and he stood at the pinnacle of Dao Lords.

His formidable combat abilities, combined with the suffocating staff techniques, exerted immense pressure on the Dao Lord.

The onlookers marveled at the elegant moves of Jian Wushuang and Dao Lord Leng Shuang‚Äîthe shifting between the Heartsword World and Frost Snow Realm, and the ice crystal phoenix at the level of Dao Lords.

Although these techniques were splendid, what truly impressed the Dao Lord was always individual strength. It was the mighty personal prowess that commanded respect.

Just like Hu Qing now‚Äîa person with a staff, devoid of any flashy or glamorous moves. Yet, each strike he made could injure a Dao Lord. His staff techniques were unique, seemingly ordinary in each attempt, but packed with immense power.

This was the might of the Samsara legacy!

By overcoming the tribulations of the heart and severing ties with his past life, Hu Qing reached a state of perfect tranquility. His power surged dramatically.

But all of this paled in comparison to the might of the Samsara inheritance.

True Spirit of the Qishen Temple lived up to his reputation. The Samsara legacy suited Hu Qing perfectly!

With just the power of Nine Revolutions, he was able to suppress a Dao Lord. Jian Wushuang stood in his place, also astonished by Hu Qings strength. If he were to give his all, he believed he would be almost evenly matched with Hu Qing.

He would probably be slightly weaker.

Even with his most powerful techniques, Jian Wushuang would find it incredibly challenging to consume the Yan power and transform it into the power of Samsara possessed by Hu Qing.

As for the devouring origin source, Hu Qing had an innate treasure and a secret ability within the innate treasure set ‚ÄòSuppressing Jade Pavilion‚Äô.

On this Original Planet, no one could threaten Hu Qing anymore.

Jian Wushuang harbored no jealousy. Even though he had lost in terms of heritage, he didn‚Äôt feel discouraged at all. Who knows who might end up stronger or weaker in the future?

Although he could sense Hu Qings aura had changed drastically, it seemed he had overcome his tribulation. It appeared he had made it through.

However, as he observed through his Eye of the Beast God, he could still see two thick karmic threads on Hu Qings body, although one of them was rather vague to him.

‚ÄúIs it related to an Emperor?‚Äù Jian Wushuang raised an eyebrow and then sneered.

This was the Qishen Temple, There was no certainty about leaving here anytime soon. Even if it had something to do with the Emperor, it was a matter for the Qishen Temple to handle later.

An Emperor who could threaten Hu Qing!

Jian Wushuang pondered, but he couldn‚Äôt figure out who it might be. Could it be that there was an Emperor who was jealous of Hu Qings opportunity in the Qishen Temple and had come to silence him?

It wouldn‚Äôt be surprising. Looking at PO Jun now, it was clear. Some Emperors remained stuck at the second level throughout their lives, unable to break through.

They were undoubtedly filled with jealousy when they saw those outstanding geniuses who, after becoming Emperors, could advance to tier 4 or even 5.

But they dared not show their true colors in front of those powerful beings; they could only take out their frustrations on Grand Yan Immortals like them.

Hu Qing was from the Tongtian Buddhist Realm and a disciple on the Wuliang Mountain. Although not a direct disciple of the Emperor, he practiced in the Emperor‚Äôs Dao Arena. In a sense, he was also affiliated with the Emperor. Logically, the Emperor wouldn‚Äôt trouble Hu Qing. But logic didn‚Äôt always apply in the world of the powerful.

Jian Wushuang couldn‚Äôt fathom it, so he stopped trying. As for the second thread of karma, it was beyond his understanding.

These were all side effects brought upon themselves by these monstrous beings. No powerful being led a plain, uneventful life; the path of the strong was far from easy.

In the Great Si Region, Zhen Wuyang had trodden upon the corpses of countless emperors to reach this point. Although the Tongtian Buddha had inherited a shattered celestial realm, was it truly because of a broken higher world that he possessed such formidable strength?

Jian Wushuang might not have a clear understanding of the power within the Emperors, but he knew this much: the Great Si Region was merely a middle-grade world. Yet, Zhen Wuyang, who controlled this middle-grade world, was no weaker than the Rulers of those higher-grade worlds. The disparity lay not only in the essence and treasures but more so in the paths they had chosen.

‚ÄúThe path of the strong!‚Äù Jian Wushuang clenched his fists. He still didn‚Äôt know where his own path of strength lay.

The pressure from the Extreme Dao constantly left him breathless. The Extreme Dao had only reached the fourth level so far, progress was excruciatingly slow. Exppl√¥re ùíñptodùíÇte stories at no/ùíóel//bin(.)cùíêm

Although he had successively broken through the Ultimate Daoo, he had barely reached the sixth level.

His Heart power was also only at the fourth level, and he had no grasp of it whatsoever. He had no idea when he would be able to break through it.

In the world of the second-grade Dao, the pinnacle of cultivation during the Grand Yan Immortal stage was reaching the Perfected Nine Revolutions. This was the most orthodox path for the strongest beings in the Original Universe.

Many tier 4 Emperors followed this path, including Dao Lord Leng Shuang, PO

Jun, and several other Dao Lords. However, in the vast expanse of the Original Universe, there were only a few thousand Grand Yan Immortals who embarked on this path, and the possibility of anyone reaching the end was almost non-existent.

The existence of the Qishen Temple in this era was considered their greatest fortune. Perhaps it would nurture a few seeds of tier 4 Emperors.

Currently, they hadn‚Äôt seen a shortcut for Grand Yan Immortals to become Emperors. The secrets of ancient times, which the Great Si Region was trying to unravel, still eluded them. The lone survivor, Liu Ya, never mentioned it, and the Emperors didn‚Äôt bother to ask. Their concern was not about whether Grand Yan Immortals like Jian Wushuang could rival them.

The path to the Ultimate Dao was the most unique. It couldn‚Äôt be called a path for the strong; instead, it was a pitch-black road. If the tier 4 Emperors who reached the shore were like dazzling suns on the path of the strong, then the path of the Ultimate Dao had only a dim oil lamp. It offered a faint light, unable to illuminate the path ahead. Countless ages had passed, and that faint light still existed, yet the travelers of yesteryears were nowhere to be seen.

Loneliness, darkness, helplessness!

This was the path of the Ultimate Dao.

Jian Wushuang‚Äôs breath trembled slightly. He exclaimed, ‚ÄúWhat about the Extreme Dao?‚Äù

‚ÄúIs there a path to follow?‚Äù There was none!

The more he thought about it, the more frightened he became. Initially, he didn‚Äôt want to come to the Qishen Temple, but now, he felt fortunate that he had entered.

He had to thank Zhen Wuyang. If he wasn‚Äôt banished to the border, he wouldn‚Äôt have entered the Qishen Temple. Moreover, he had a premonition; he felt that he might have triggered something in the Qishen Temple.

Although it was a somewhat mysterious self-confidence, it might indeed be possible.

The Qishen Temple, as a legacy left by ancient powerhouses, might contain information about the Extreme Dao. This way, he wouldn‚Äôt have to blindly grope forward. He feared getting halfway only to find out he had deviated from the path and couldn‚Äôt turn back.

Jian Wushuangs goal of becoming strong had never wavered. Regardless of who he once fought for, now he only wanted to live for himself.

For himself, for strength, for an eternal brilliance in the boundless expanse of the stars.

Swish!

In the distance, Dao Lord Xue Yue‚Äôs figure was subtly shifting, though Jian Wushuangs thoughts were occupied elsewhere, this movement couldn‚Äôt escape the keen perception of Jian Wushuangs formidable Thought power. The moment Xue Yue made a move, Jian Wushuang intercepted him, appearing instantly in front of the Dao Lord.

‚ÄúXue Yue, you better not make a move!‚Äù Jian Wushuangs voice was cold.

It wasn‚Äôt a threat; he spoke with tremendous confidence. His recent battle with Leng Shuang had given him a better understanding of his own strength. Now, even a Dao Lord like Xue Yue was nothing to fear..
