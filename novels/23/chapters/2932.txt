Chapter 2933: Secret Lair

——

Jian Wushuang had indeed promised Bone Emperor to make him a referral.

However, Bone Emperor had not given him a Heaven-cleaving token, but a scroll of Heaven-sealing Map.

“Is that so? That’s a pity.” Xue Dong King sighed.

He had fought with Jian Wushuang before, so he knew how terrifying Jian Wushuang was.

If his battle strength was so terrifying at the Divine Master level, how powerful would he be when he broke through to become an Immortal Saint?

According to Xue Dong King’s estimation, Jian Wushuang was almost certain to become an official member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, and it was a certainty that he would become an earth-level member.

Once Jian Wushuang broke through to become an Immortal Saint, the possibility of becoming a heaven-level member was very high.

In the future, he might even become an emperor-grade member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance or even a legendary ‘original grade’ member.

The person who introduced Jian Wushuang to the Heaven-cleaving Alliance would also receive a large reward.

Of course, Xue Dong King coveted this reward.

Unfortunately, Jian Wushuang had already promised others, so he could not force him.

While they were talking, they had already passed through many territories through the space tunnel. Soon, they arrived at a hidden dark void.

There was no light in this dark void, nor was there any material existence.

“We’re here.” Xue Dong King stopped.

“We’re here? Right here?” Jian Wushuang was a little surprised.

He looked carefully ahead, but he did not see anything strange in front of him, either with his naked eyes or with his soul power.

In his eyes, it was just an ordinary void.

“Haha, just watch.”

Xue Dong King gave a strange smile, but he reached out his hand and pointed at the void in front of him.

Immediately, a trace of divine power spread out, which spread to the void. What surprised Jian Wushuang was that the dark void, which Jian Wushuang did not feel strange at all, began to ripple.

These ripples spread out in all directions.

Soon, an exquisite attic appeared in the void in front of him.

“This space-time is so strange.” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“When I first came here, I was just like you. Later, I found out that each nest of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance was connected to each other by a special treasure. That treasure is extremely strange. No matter where it is, it can perfectly hide and protect the nest of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Don’t underestimate this nest of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance in the endless territories. However, because it is connected to that treasure, even if a rule master came, he would not be able to break into this nest by force,” said Xue Dong King.

“So powerful?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

The Heaven-cleaving Alliance was very powerful in the Divine Beginning World. It was spread across all the territories of the Divine Beginning World.

The secret lairs of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance were numerous in the Divine Beginning World. However, none of the lairs were connected to a unique treasure of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Each of the lairs was perfectly hidden, and even Rule Masters could not touch them.

Such a method was indeed impressive!

“Only official members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance or those who have the Heaven-cleaving token can enter the secret lairs of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Brother Jian, let’s go in,” said Xue Dong King.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King immediately entered the attic side by side.

The attic did not look big from the outside, but it actually had a universe inside.

As soon as he entered the pavilion, Jian Wushuang appeared in a large hall. The hall was very vast and there were all kinds of chairs and tables around it. However, there were only two or three people in such a large hall, which made it very quiet.

The two or three people were wearing the same gray robes and gray masks.

“Why is it so quiet?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“It’s normal. After all, this is the endless territory, not the boundless third heaven, where experts are as numerous as clouds. Not to mention the Immortal Saint, even the Invincible Divine Master is pitifully few here. Naturally, not many people become members of Heaven-cleaving Alliance. In the territory surrounding this secret lair, there are no more than 20 members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance,” said Xue Dong King.

“Less than 20? So few?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Less? Brother Jian, you must know how high the threshold of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance is. For example, even the Invincible Divine Master needs a certain level of strength and luck before he can truly join. There are only dozens of realms around this nest. It’s already very good to have nearly 20 members,” said Xue Dong King.

“That’s true.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “Although there aren’t many of them, they are of high quality. Even the weakest one should be an Invincible Divine Master, and most of them are Immortal Saints. It’s no wonder that the Heaven-cleaving Alliance can gather more than three Immortal Saints in any corner of the Beginning Divine Realm in such a short period of time.”

“By the way, why are they all wearing the same gray robes and gray masks?” Jian Wushuang asked again.

“Gray robes and gray masks. These are the attire of ordinary members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance,” Xue Dong King explained. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“After all, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance is an extremely loose and unconstrained union. There are countless experts who have joined the Alliance, and many of them have a certain status. Most of them can not look at others with their real faces. Therefore, after becoming a member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, they will be given such gray robes and masks.

“The gray robe and the mask can not only represent his position in the Heaven-slaying Alliance but also conceal his aura. For example, your aura is as hot as fire, but through the mask, your aura can become very gentle and calm, and outsiders can not see it.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood.

“Of course, although the gray robe and mask are the attire of an ordinary member, whether you wear it in this secret lair, on the way to the mission, and whether you hide your real identity is up to you. Like me, I usually don’t bother to disguise myself, so I passed the Heaven-cleaving Alliance test as Xue Dong King,” he said.

“You are so free and easy.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He had heard from Saint Crimson Rock that members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance could hide their identity and make it easier for them to do things.

Many people who were high and powerful on the surface had to pay attention to their identity. Many things were not easy for them to do in person, but after going through the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, they had no scruples. They could plunder and kill at will. Now it seemed that… they relied on this special outfit.

“My identity is the most sensitive, so I definitely can’t show my true face. I have to wear this gray robe and mask in the future.” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.
