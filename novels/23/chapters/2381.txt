Chapter 2382: Got It

After Jian Wushuang left, Master Kun and the purple-robed middle-aged man in the hall had a strange look on their faces.

“Master Kun, do you think the young man was teasing you?” asked the purple-robed middle-aged man curiously.

Any single item on the long list of precious treasures mentioned by Master Kun was enough to cause an uproar within the Wusha Wilderness, but when Jian Wushuang heard about them, he remained a straight face as if they were nothing special.

Master Kun shook his head. “No. Someone from the Middle Stage Chaotic Realm wouldn’t have the courage to tease me like that. Even if he dared to do so, I would be able to discover his flaws. I’ve lived for so many years and dare say that I’m rather accurate in judging someone. Despite his young age, the man gave me an ambiguous feeling when he stood before me just now, it was impossible for me to read him.”

“Moreover, he was too calm just now or I should say he was overconfident. That kind of confidence made me believe that it’s possible for him to bring me those precious treasures within three years.”

“Then again, those items are extremely rare. It might be possible to gather one or two of them. However, to collect all of them in such huge quantities...” The purple-robed middle-aged man frowned.

“I don’t have to worry about that. If he could bring me all those precious treasures, I’ll help him make his Life Armour. I’ve nothing to lose if he fails.” Master Kun smiled.

“That’s true.” The purple-robed middle-aged man understood it.

...

Jian Wushuang’s heart was heavy after leaving Master Kun’s mansion.

“Red Sun Secret Essence, Red Blood Fruit, Purple Shimmer, Spectacular Beast’s Scales, and Celestial Iron Ore. Among all these items, I’ve only heard of the Celestial Iron Ore which is something extremely valuable. I can see from the expressions of the purple-robed middle-aged man that the other four items are also a rare find. I am afraid that it will not be easy for me to get all these items.” Jian Wushuang mumbled under his breath.

He knew very well that the Life Armour was not something easy to make.

In his Eternal Chaotic World’s previous life, Emperor Bai was able to make a Life Armour because the Eternal Chaotic World had many valuables that were left behind since the ancient times. Many precious treasures could be found from the ancient battlefields, so it was possible for Emperor Bai to gather those treasures.

As for the craft master... Jian Wushuang was guessing that Emperor Bai might have asked Master Xuanyi to do it.

Nonetheless, it was really difficult to find those treasures in Wusha Wilderness.

“Not to worry. I might not be able to find them now but as long as my power is restored to its peak, I could do as I wish in Wusha Wilderness. It should be a lot easier to find those treasures at that time,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

The reason he told Master Kun that he would bring those treasures in three years’ time was that he knew that his power would be restored to its peak after three years.

Once his power was restored and if he could not get his hands on those treasures, he would leave Wusha Wilderness, never having to deal with Master Kun ever again.

“Once I have the Life Armour, I can cultivate the Nine Sparkle Star Armour. At that time, my power will level up. Unfortunately, I’ll have to wait.”

After that day, Jian Wushuang spent his time in the inn where he lived.

Ten days passed in the blink of an eye.

Soon, it was the day when the large auction in Qingxiao City was held.

Countless experts in Qingxiao City had made their ways to the auction. As for the Hundred Flower Tower, it was a little deserted as compared to its merry atmosphere on usual days.

Xiao Heng and his people were ready to carry out their plan.

Suspended in the void outside Hundred Flower Tower, Xiao Heng and his people, including Jian Wushuang, carefully converged their auras.

“According to what is expected, the Hundred Flowers Tower is weakly guarded today. The Second-Class Divine Demons who usually guard Hundred Flowers Tower have gone to the auction. Miss Xiao had lured the First-class Divine Demon that was hidden in Hundred Flowers Tower away. In other words, Hundred Flowers Tower was left with only some ordinary Third-Class Divine Demons and Chaotic Realms.” Xiao Heng stared at the Hundred Flowers Tower in the distance and his eyes could not contain his excitement.

“I suppose Miss Xiao is ready for us now. Let’s do this.”

Xiao Heng reached an agreement with the four core disciples.

Xiao Heng turned to look at Jian Wushuang. “Jian Wushuang, your task is to stay here and be on the lookout for us. If something happens or some experts come our way, you will have to alert me immediately.”

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Xiao Heng and the disciples thought very little of him, hence only made him a watchman which so happened that he was not keen to participate in their activities.

“Let’s go!”

Xiao Heng waved his hand and the five core disciples from Narcissus Island advanced towards Hundred Flowers Tower whereas Jian Wushuang stood in the void quietly watching.

He shook his head when he saw that Xiao Heng and others cautiously snuck into Hundred Flowers Tower. “These core disciples of Narcissus Island are still too young after all. How can this task be as simple as they thought?”

Although he was cognizant, he chose not to say much and just do what he was told.

It did not take long for Hundred Flowers Tower to be in a ruckus and at the same time a surge of divine power effluxed from within.

“It seems like the fight has begun.” Jian Wushuang was watching with interest.

There were constant roars and tumultuous coming from the Hundred Flowers Tower.

Although the tower was left with no First-Class and Second-Class Divine Demons, it never lacked ordinary Third-Class Divine Demons which were enough to bring great resistance against Xiao Heng and his people.

Besides that, experts that scattered all over Qingxiao City would soon be aware of the scuffle in Hundred Flowers Tower and made their way back to the tower, hence Xiao Heng and the other disciples were left with a short window of time to act.

However simple-minded Xiao Heng and the other disciples were, they were competent core disciples of Narcissus Island and were skillful in combat despite being only in Third-Class Divine Demons. They were top tier Third-Class Divine Demons, especially Xiao Heng. When Xiao Heng went all out with his powers, he was comparable to an ordinary Second-Class Divine Demons. Not long after the five of them work hand in hand...

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The five figures came dashing out from Hundred Flowers Tower and frantically headed towards the outer city.

“Jian Wushuang, hurry up!”

Xiao Heng sent a message to Jian Wushuang.

‘Looks like they’ve made it. Not too bad after all.’ 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Jian Wushuang grinned while his figure floated away to the outer city.

Shortly after Xiao Heng and others left Hundred Flowers Tower, a large group of figures emerged behind them from the tower.

“How dare these people abduct someone from my Hundred Flowers Tower!”

“Go after and kill them all!”

“Be careful! Miss Xiao is still in their hands!”

A swarm of figures frantically went after Xiao Heng and the others.
