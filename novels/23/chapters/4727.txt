4729 Chen Qing’s Mischief

The Young Emperor’s lips curled into a sinister smile. “I think I’d better not. I’m in the Six Heavens Realm, and some Yan Immortals are eager for me to die. If I stay with Imperial Father, I’m afraid it will be even more chaotic.”

Hearing this, Zhen Wuyang frowned. Then, he looked around the hall with an oppressive and majestic gaze. Eventually, he stopped in front of the six Princes.

“Yan’er, do you have any evidence?”

“Evidence? Most of them are dead,” the Young Emperor said. Then, he held the jade pot and drank directly from the mouth of the pot.

A trace of gloominess flashed across Prince Jiu’s eyes as he looked at the Young Emperor who was sitting on the side of the head in such a frivolous manner. However, he concealed it immediately.

He could not understand why his Imperial Father had chosen such a useless person who could not cultivate to be the Crown Prince and was so biased towards him.

A large amount of resources had pushed him from a good-for-nothing to a Yan Immortal. Almost every drop of blood in his meridians was made from the best resources in the Heavenly Domain! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Since his Imperial Father was unwilling to do it, he would do it on his behalf. The death of a piece of trash was ten thousand times better than the death of the entire Great Si Region!

At that time, even the Imperial Father would understand him.

A cruel sneer unconsciously appeared on his face, but he was met with the Young Emperor’s gaze. Shocked, Prince Jiu quickly put away his expression and pretended to drink.

The Young Emperor retracted his disdainful gaze and unconsciously looked at the only person who was acting alone.

In the Heavenly Court, where Fairy music was heard and goddesses were dancing, this guy actually closed his eyes and meditated. He was really unique.

“What a strange guy. Is he not interested at all?”

With this in mind, the Young Emperor flicked a touch of Yan power on Cheng Qing’s body, then pouted slightly.

Chen Qing understood and elbowed Jian Wushuang, “Brother Jian, please wake up. I have something good to show you.”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and looked at Chen Qing helplessly.

Cheng Qing laughed in a low voice. He then opened his mouth and breathed out a mouthful of Yan power towards the Fairies who were close at hand.

Yan power turned into a strange wind and rose from the ground without any warning. It directly blew the skirts of the Fairies up.

For a time, a beautiful scene lit up.

“Ah!”

The Fairy maidens cried out in alarm and were already in a mess, each of them hurriedly holding onto the hem of their skirts that had been blown up by the strange wind.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang was speechless. He shook his head and said, “Brother Chen, stop joking.”

Chen Qing scratched his head. Before he could speak again, Prince Jiu, who had already sensed it, suddenly slammed the table and shouted in anger, “Chen Qing, How dare you!”

The Heavenly Court was dead silent. After Prince Jiu finished shouting, he immediately turned to Emperor Zhen Wuyang and said solemnly, “Imperial Father, Chen Qing has openly wreaked havoc in the Heavenly Court. He has no respect for the law and clearly does not respect you. He deserves to be executed for his crime!”

“It’s not me, I didn’t. No one saw where this evil wind came from, so how can you be so sure that it was me? It’s clearly a trap!” Cheng Qing stood up and said angrily.

Zhen Wuyang shook his head helplessly. Then, he waved his hand and said, “Cheng Qing, get out. Without my summons, you are not allowed to return to the Heavenly Court.”

“Yes,” Chen Qing agreed dejectedly. However, when he turned around, he raised his brows and glanced at Prince Jiu.

After this little episode, the Fairies who were forced to reveal their true colors no longer had the face to dance. They all covered their faces and ran out of the Heavenly Court.

The first half of the banquet ended hastily.

Then, Zhen Wuyang’s lengthy speech was heard.

Since he could not meditate again, Jian Wushuang decided to observe each of the Yan Immortals.

The Elders with light wheels of various colors, who were the Elders who had followed Emperor Zhen Wuyang in battle, were the first echelon. They had an extremely deep Yan power and an unfathomable realm that even Chen Qing could not compare to.

Jian Wushuang could vaguely guess that they might have already taken that step and reached another unknown and mysterious realm.

As for the second group, it was a group of Yan Immortals, with Chen Qing being the best. They were at the peak of the Yan Immortal stage, but they were unable to break through.

Jian Wushuang was in the middle of the second and third group. After all, ordinary Yan Immortals, even four or five Yan Immortals, could not cause him any effective damage.

Even if he were to fight with Chen Qing, Jian Wushuang was confident that he would be able to retreat safely even if he was no match for him.

What would be above the peak of the Yan Immortal stage?

Old Master, what kind of existence was he?

And what role did his Master play?

No one could give him an answer. He could only get closer and closer to everything.

As Emperor Zhen Wuyang’s emotional speech came to an end, a piece of news was transmitted to every Yan Immortal’s ears along with Yan power.

“Snatch the Peach?” Jian Wushuang murmured softly and then looked at Emperor Zhen Wuyang in confusion.

A green jade immortal Peach enshrouded in a myriad of beauty appeared in the Emperor’s hand.

“Everyone, just like before, this Peach contains the opportunity of the Great Dao. It is the most indispensable part to break through to the Yan Immortal cultivation realm. If you can get it, it will be of great benefit.”

At this moment, all the Yan Immortals could not suppress their joy.

The most important part of the feast, the fight for the Peach, had finally begun.

Those who were able to attend this banquet were all the most powerful Yan Immortals in the Heavenly Domain. Ordinary Supreme Treasures started to pale in terms of utility.

Only things related to breaking through Wang Mi could he attract them.

This Peach contained a great opportunity for a breakthrough. Once obtained, it was basically one step out of the cultivation realm of Yan immortal!

However, there was only one Immortal Peach, and there were more than 300 Yan Immortals participating. The competition would be intense.

And the Yan Immortals who were likely to be the runners were still eager to try. After all, even if they failed, the Emperor would still reward them handsomely.

The hot topic of fighting for the Peaches had always been the sixth son of Emperor Zhen Wuyang. Just Prince Jiu alone had won two immortal Peaches.

This time, he was also sure to win.

As for the Young Emperor, he had never participated in the battle for the Peaches.

“The Immortal Peach will land in one year. The person who can last ten days will be the final winner,” Zhen Wuyang stated the rules, and with a flip of his palm, the fruit that was enshrouded in the brilliance of the Great Dao fell through the palace of the Heavenly Court and landed on the entire land of the Heavenly Court.

“Everyone, please begin,” Emperor Zhen Wuyang said with a smile.

Due to the rules, other than the few Elders, all Yan Immortals can participate. However, the six Princes can only bring one Yan Immortal into the arena.

Prince Jiu took the lead to ask for the order. Behind him stood a white-robed Yan Immortal, who was also his companion who had taken care of him since he was young.

Following Prince Jiu’s request, Prince Yu, Prince Qian, and the others also joined in the battle for the Peach.
