Chapter 367: Fighting Jiu Xiu

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Even just calmly standing there, the golden-robed young man attracted everyone’s attention.

“Who is he?”

All the experts, including the warriors from Holy Emperor Palace, were puzzled.

Obviously, the golden-robed young man came from Holy Emperor Palace, but his existence was unknown, even to the Palace Master and those Elders. Only the First and Second Holy Masters were pleasantly surprised by his arrival.

“Master Jiu Xiu!”

First Holy Master and Second Holy Master hurriedly saluted the young man.

The way they addressed him left everyone stunned.

Master Jiu Xiu?

They addressed this golden-robed young man as Master?

“How could that be?” A horrified expert exclaimed immediately, “The Holy Masters and Holy Emperor Palace have such a high status! Especially First Holy Master. He has always been the second highest figure on the Nanyang Continent. Throughout the entire Nanyang Continent, who is qualified to be called Master by him?”

Master was the address for a stronger expert. Being called that by First Holy Master carried a lot of meaning. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Master Jiu Xiu?”

“Is there such a person in Holy Emperor Palace?”

“First Holy Master called him Master. How strong is this Jiu Xiu?”

Everyone who heard it was amazed.

The experts from the Holy Emperor Palace, who had become as pale as the dead, had rekindled their hope at this moment.

They did not know who this Master Jiu Xiu was, and they had never seen him before, but Master Jiu Xiu was obviously on their side.

While everyone was staring at the golden-robed young man, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were also fixed on this Jiu Xiu.

“A young man with a sword scar between his eyebrows.”?Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

Previously, when his father told him how Blood Feather Tower annihilated the Ji Clan, he mentioned that it was not just the experts from Blood Feather Tower, but also a young man with a sword scar between his eyebrows that had killed their people. It was this young man who took away his mother as well as his father’s Sword Soul.

Obviously, the man who had taken away his mother and father was the golden-robed young man standing in front of him at this moment.

With a slight smile on his lips, the golden-robed young man looked up at the two giant Sword Soul Phantoms behind Jian Wushuang and smiled coldly.

“Even though the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor has declined to such a level, you still managed to awaken double Sword Souls. Your talent is really good. I guess you are even better than your father. If I can take away all your Sword Souls, then my harvest should be impressive.”

“You want to take away my Sword Soul? That will depend on whether you have the ability.” Jian Wushuang’s voice was also extremely cold. Meanwhile, his strength suddenly soared. Behind him, the Sword Essence gathered by the two Sword Soul Phantoms was also increasing.

The dialogue between the two did not conceal anything. It resounded throughout the area, but the experts who heard it were all puzzled.

“Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor?”

“Sword Soul?”

“What’s that?”

Even though there were many experts present, the number of Saint Realm experts didn’t amount to more than 50 people. Some of them were even well informed, but no one had ever heard of the Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline or Sword Soul.

“Master Jiu Xiu, this Jian Wushuang possesses a monstrous strength, which is beyond what our Holy Emperor Palace could cope with. Master Jiu Xiu, please kill him for us!” First Holy Master said respectfully.

“Even if you didn’t say that, I would deal with him.” The golden-robed young man said indifferently. A purple longsword, with a weak aura, appeared in his hand. It was an ordinary third-grade magic weapon.

Jiu Xiu’s figure suddenly disappeared. When he reappeared, he had already arrived next to Jian Wushuang. At the same time, the purple longsword lightly slashed toward Jian Wushuang.

“How fast!”

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Jiu Xiu was so fast that even Jian Wushuang was horrified, and the sword that Jiu Xiu wielded was incomparably mysterious.

When the sword slashed out, Jian Wushuang felt as if he was being suppressed from every direction.

He wanted to escape, but his body couldn’t seem to move. It was like this sword had completely locked him in place.

“His Origin comprehension is much better than mine!”?Jian Wushuang was secretly surprised.

As soon as Jiu Xiu displayed his skill, Jian Wushuang immediately understood that Jiu Xiu’s Cultivation was still within the Saint Realm. On top of that, his level of power was far worse than Jian Wushuang’s, but the young man’s Origin comprehension was far above him.

As the sword light drew near, Jian Wushuang realized he was unable to dodge. Hence, he gave up escaping and faced it directly, brandishing his Tripple-kill Sword, which radiated a monstrous rage.

Clang!

Although the sound was very light, a low and heavy crash was heard when the two collided–Boom! Boom! Two shocking sword lights immediately appeared and shot down towards the ground.

Boom~Clang!

There was a violent rumbling on the ground as a huge crack, spreading hundreds of meters, appeared, seeming to split the ground in half.

At the same time, the other sword crack swept towards the gate of Holy Emperor Palace, even reaching some buildings inside the palace. Boom ~ ~ ~ A loud roar was heard and a large number of buildings were directly smashed, mercilessly killing many disciples of Holy Emperor Palace who were near or still inside the buildings.

Up in the air, both Jian Wushuang and Jiu Xiu retreated at the same time.

“He is only in the Staint Realm, yet his strength is so powerful?”??Jiu Xiu looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise, then grinned and said, “This is interesting.”

At this point,?Jiu Xiu stepped forward again. Jiu Xiu immediately closed the distance, appearing in front of Jian Wushuang once again.

With the purple longsword still in his hand, he casually attacked again. But this time, he struck three times in quick succession. Hua! Hua! Hua!

The three sword lights were surprisingly fast and extremely subtle.

Jian Wushuang’s face turned solemn as he immediately swung the Triple-kill Sword.

Bang! Bang!

Two consecutive clashes were heard. Among the three sword lights, two were parried by Jian Wushuang, while the other one struck his body, leaving a clear bloody mark on his chest, forcing Jian Wushuang to retreat in an explosive and disgraceful manner.

Once he regained his balance, Jian Wushuang looked at the blood mark on his chest, which was actually bleeding.

He was injured.

This was the first time that he has been injured since he became a Venerable Master and improved his body.

Previously, during the hand-to-hand fight against First Holy Master, when tens of attacks landed directly on his body, It only left behind some marks, which quickly dissipated without leaving a single injury. Now, even though the sword light displayed by Jiu Xiu barely broke his skin, it was still true that he had been injured.
