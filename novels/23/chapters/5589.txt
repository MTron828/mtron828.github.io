Chapter 5590: The Meaning of the Dao Merge

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation  Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

When the ultimate experts of the Myriad Daos reached the supreme-peak, they elevated their understanding of space to the cosmic realm to grasp the power of All Things.

Therefore, to master the power of All Things at the level of Dao Lord, apart from cultivating the Extreme Dao, one had to practice the Myriad Daos, perfecting each path and then mastering the cosmic space to truly control the power of All Things.

However, at that level, gaining mastery over the power of All Things seemed somewhat redundant.

For a Dao Lord who had mastered the cosmic space, an unprecedented ability allowed them to directly overpower supreme-peak experts without the need for the power of All Things. This made the power of All Things in their hands pale in comparison to the profound mastery held by an Emperor.

This speculation was valid, but achieving it was probably far-fetched.

Since understanding the significance of the Dao Merge, Jian Wushuang had also contemplated what it would be like to master two or even three Ultimate Daos.

In reality, it was just wishful thinking. Even if one could comprehend multiple Ultimate Daos, it would be challenging to successfully integrate them.

The Myriad Daos were passed down and pursued by many cultivators due to the exploration of predecessors, making it achievable.

Not to mention perfecting all Daos, merely cultivating multiple secondary Origin Sources and gaining insights into some common Origin Source Daos, as long as the integration was successful, could cause a significant surge in the spatial realm.

Space harbored Myriad Daos, and the Myriad Daos, in turn, nourished space.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang’s Extreme Dao was, in itself, a more perfect manifestation of the Myriad Daos.

While the Extreme Dao perfected the Myriad Daos, among these Myriad Daos, only the Sword Dao was considered an Ultimate Dao.

This further emphasized the unparalleled supremacy of his Sword Dao.

The power of that one sword move surpassed his imagination but met his expectations.

It should be like this, with the Extreme Dao as the supplement and the Sword Dao as the mainstay.

Dominating the universe, traversing various major time and space realms!

At this moment, he was in a good mood, singing all the way towards the Qishen Temple in the Human Realm.

After their departure, the supreme-peak experts of the Human Realm once again gathered and began studying the space that had been suppressed into a painting by his sword move.

In a square and pitch-black void, the entire space of nine layers was sliced away, leaving only a chaotic flow of pitch-black emptiness.

Everything turned into nothingness.

Several supreme-peak experts swallowed nervously as they turned to look at Grand Venerable from the Human Realm.

“Everyone, we need to keep a low profile recently; our Human Realm may be facing a great tribulation!” Grand Venerable of the Human Realm’s face darkened, leaving a warning before departing.

Indeed, there was a looming tribulation for the Human Realm, and it was a tribulation left personally by Jian Wushuang.

A young man named Xin Jiu, once he matured, would become the tribulation for the Human Realm!

At the headquarters of the Human Realm’s Divine Temple.

Jian Wushuang and Moluo arrived ostentatiously, without any concealment.

As they arrived, Jian Wushuang’s aura was now at the peak of tier 6, displaying a demeanor of a powerhouse with a supreme sword technique capable of beheading peak experts.

Moluo followed suit, straightening his posture, and respectfully said, “Young Master’s strength is probably among the top even among Inheritors. If the Dao is successfully merged, it will be unparalleled!”

“Tsk tsk, I haven’t successfully merged the Dao yet!” Jian Wushuang answered with a smile.

He indeed had confidence now.

Mie Sheng had just appeared and then left. Although the reason was unknown, it didn’t matter.

Any major threat in the future should be the concern of the Zhen Ling. It had nothing to do with him. At this point, the longer he dragged out the time, the stronger he would become. By then, any enemy before him would be no more than a sword’s move to settle!

“Haha, I have you to thank, Young Master. Normally, when I use such cross-border teleportation formations, the Divine Temple gives me a hard time. I guess this time…” Moluo’s words weren’t finished when a group of Emperors from below the temple had already arrived.

Seeing Jian Wushuang and Moluo making such a grand entrance, displaying unfamiliar and arrogant faces, some were surprised.

In the Grave God Mountain, there were direct Inheritors who couldn’t possibly appear in the Human Realm unless they were returning to the Grave God Mountain and had to pass through this place.

If they were to return, they wouldn’t come to this place directly from the Human Secret Realm.

Feeling the inherent deficiency in Moluo’s Origin Source, the leading tier 6 Emperor sneered.

“This is the Divine Temple, who allowed you to fly here?!”

Jian Wushuang was momentarily stunned; these people actually didn’t recognize him.

His name had only just recently been removed from the wanted order; they were truly blind.

“What are you looking at? Can’t accept it?” The tier 6 Emperor’s expression darkened, staring at Jian Wushuang.

He could sense a powerful aura from Jian Wushuang, an aura of the Extreme Dao, only at the peak of tier 6.

Although this strength was considerable in the impoverished Human Realm, it wasn’t quite enough here.

Those who served in the Divine Temple had long been accustomed to arrogance. Even though they were native Emperors, they looked down on other native Emperors like themselves.

Moluo couldn’t help but want to act, but the fear instilled by the Divine Temple was deeply ingrained. He didn’t dare to make a move, even though they were already a group.

“Are you blind? Take a good look at who I am!” A coldness flickered in Jian Wushuang’s eyes, and a violent aura instantly surged, shaking the temple.

Although the Human Realm was impoverished, this place was connected to the God’s Tomb. There must be powerful beings from the White Tiger Temple here, likely more than just a simple tier 6 Emperor.

The violent aura directly pushed back the tier 6 Emperor and several tier 5 Emperors for thousands of miles. Fortunately, they were all wearing the temple’s equipped battle armor, high-grade Eternal Treasures, so they were not injured.

However, the divine bodies were already somewhat cracked, and their strength was continuously declining.

“You actually dare to make a move?” The tier 6 Emperor laughed angrily.

He had been presiding over the Human Realm for many years. Even if the Inheritors passed through this place, they had to address him as a brother. Today, he unexpectedly encountered someone who wasn’t afraid of death.

In that moment, he directly crushed the highest order token and reported the situation in the Human Realm.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but want to laugh. He suspected that the other party truly didn’t recognize him.

If they knew it was him, they wouldn’t have foolishly come to trouble him like this!

He even doubted if the other party was truly blind, unable to see that he was an Inheritor, with a complete Origin Source?

So much so that he turned to Moluo, pointing at his face, and said, “Do I look very special?”

Moluo was initially stunned, then when he tried to say something, he too was left in shock.

In the Divine Temple, powerful figures were gathered, including a supreme-peak expert, though their strength was just average, probably not a match for Moluo.

Moluo’s surprise wasn’t directed at these experts, but at the sight of Jian Wushuang.

In the past, when seeing Jian Wushuang, one could immediately recognize the completeness of his Origin Source. Even though Jian Wushuang’s strength had now become more formidable, allowing him to conceal his aura, the two of them had arrived without any concealment.

Moreover, just now, Jian Wushuang had even released his aura. Wasn’t that enough to make the other party realize that Jian Wushuang was an Inheritor?
