2027 Supreme Emperor Stone

“Humph, we are different. Although I am entering Imperial Peak for the first time, I already know the ins and outs of Imperial Peak,” Lin Tianhao humphed coldly.

“Oh yeah? So what? What does it have to do with me?” Jian Wushuang sneered.

Lin Tianhao was stunned.

“Alright, stop your nonsense,” the elder with white hair and a white beard reprimanded, “All of you, listen up. Imperial Peak is different from Imperial City. The rules in Imperial Peak are much stricter. In Imperial Peak, regardless of your background and identity, whoever goes against the rules in Imperial Peak will be punished. No one is an exception. So, all of you had better do things according to the rules.”

“Yes,” Lin Tianhao nodded.

“Of course, of course. I never get into trouble,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Under the lead of the elder, Jian Wushuang soon arrived in Imperial Peak.

The moment they entered Imperial Peak, even Jian Wushuang who was experienced gasped in admiration at the sight.

In his view, there was a lofty pinnacle that was beyond his imagination. The pinnacle was at least ten thousand zhang tall. It was broad and boundless, which made one reverent.

In the pinnacle, there were lofty palaces and pavilions towering in every corner. On top of the huge pinnacle, there was one exquisite black pavilion.

The black pavilion was pathetically small compared to the entire pinnacle. However, the black pavilion was where the Imperial Cabinet, the supreme power of Three-Emperors World located.

Imperial Cabinet?” Jian Wushuang muttered. But suddenly, his gaze was caught by the void around the lofty pinnacle.

There were three huge statues there.

The three statues were about ten thousand zhang tall. They were human in shape but they looked extremely strange.

On top of that, the three statues gave people a mysterious feeling. Every single stone on the statue contained a boundless, abstruse vibe.

Hence, Jian Wushuang saw a large number of cultivators seated before the three statues. They were obviously comprehending there.

However, the one that truly caught Jian Wushuang’s attention wasn’t the three statues but a huge golden whirlpool in the middle of the three statues, also where the three statues fixed their gazes. The golden whirlpool was spinning madly and giving out a boundless aura.

At the core of the golden whirlpool, there was a resplendent golden light.

The golden light seemed to be showing off to the universe. It was as though it was the brightest light in the universe.

Even from a distance, Jian Wushuang could feel the tremendous power contained in the golden light.

“What is that?” Jian Wushuang exclaimed in surprise.

Not only him, but also the other four around him were looking at the golden whirlpool.

There was a tinge of anticipation in their eyes. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The elder that brought them in said, “It is the Holy Crystal that we Three-Emperors World hold the prestige of. It is said that the Three-Emperors left it behind. Because of the Holy Crystal, Three-Emperors World is living in peace.”

The elder took fancy at the Holy Crystal too but he didn’t explain much.

“Holy Crystal?” Jian?Wushuang focused. He could that that the Holy Crystal in the golden whirlpool was extraordinary.

“Jian Wushuang, although I am in your sword, I can feel the boundless power that the Holy Crystal in the golden whirlpool carries. The Holy Crystal is extraordinary. You have to check on it later,” Abysmal Saint Master in Blood Mountain Sword said.

“I know,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Then, the elder took the five of them around Imperial Peak and briefed them through the cultivations places and rules. Then, he arranged places for them to reside in before he left.

Then, Jian Wushuang and the other four naturally parted ways to do what they wanted to do.

Jian Wushuang came before the golden whirlpool at the first instant.

The golden whirlpool was huge and Jian Wushuang felt that it was like a huge, great formation. However, it was vastly different from great formation too. It was mysterious.

Because of distance, Jian Wushuang had finally gotten to see the Holy Crystal in the golden whirlpool clearly.

It was a piece of translucent crystal that was shimmering in gold. The golden crystal was unique. Not only did it contain extremely pure power, Jian Wushuang could also sense the vibe of an Emperor from the golden crystal.

Huh? A crystal carried the vibe of an Emperor that strikes fear?

“What kind of a crystal is this? I have never seen it in Eternal Chaotic World,” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows as he asked, “Abysmal Saint Master, do any of you know this crystal?”

The three Great Emperors in Blood Mountain Sword could see the scene outside clearly. They naturally could see the golden crystal in the whirlpool.

The three of them looked confused. They obviously couldn’t recognize the golden crystal either.

“Let me ask Emperor Bai and the other Great Emperors from Sanctuary Alliance. Let’s see if any of them can recognize the golden crystal,” Emperor Jiu Qiao said.

Jian Wushuang nodded faintly.

He knew that it was extraordinary and it was most likely extremely important to Three-Emperor World. Hence, he had to find out the actual function.

There were many Great Emperors from Sanctuary Alliance who wandered in the ancient battlefield. They might know some things in ancient times and could recognize the golden crystal.

As expected, not long after Emperor Jiu Qiao enquired, East Royal Emperor recognized the golden crystal.

“Everyone, there’s an answer.”

Emperor God Jiu Qiao said, “According to East Royal Emperor, the golden crystal is named Supreme Emperor Stone. It is a rare and precious gemstone from ancient times. It is extremely difficult to form the gemstone. A nail-sized Supreme Emperor Stone would need a long time to take form. On top of that, the pure power contained in a nail-sized Supreme Emperor Stone would be more than the total divine power of a Sir God expert.

“That is why the top sects who had powerful foundations in ancient times would use Supreme Emperor Stone in their powerful formation as a source of strength, in order to maintain the revolving formation.

“Besides, the Supreme Emperor Stone is born with the vibe of an Emperor. Hence, it is best to use it to refine treasure with the Emperor vibe. East Royal Emperor once obtained a Supreme Emperor Stone by sheer luck. He showed the Supreme Emperor Stone to my doppelg?nger earlier. It was really exactly the same as the golden crystal in the whirlpool.”

“However, East Royal Emperor only got himself a little fist-sized Supreme Emperor Stone. The one we see right now…”
