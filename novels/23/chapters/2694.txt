Chapter 2695: True Intentions Unveiled

“The two of them...are experts from Star Fort!” The faces of Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master darkened when they saw the Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods behind Shi Mo.

They had heard Corpse Palace had a certain relationship with Star Fort. It could even be said that Star Fort was secretly supporting the Corpse Palace. However, those were only rumors with nothing concrete. However, the doubt regarding Corpse Palace and Star Fort’s relationship had been cleared the moment those two Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods appeared before them.

“Palace Master Shi Mo, what’s the meaning of this?” The Purple House Master stared at Shi Mo in front of her.

“Haha... Our Corpse Palace sincerely invites both of you to attend this meeting. However, you want to leave when the dinner has just started. Won’t that mean you’re not giving the Corpse Palace any face? Therefore, it’ll be best for the two of you to return to your seats,” said Shi Mo coldly.

Both Sheng Long and the Purple House Master were secretly anxious. However, the two of them suppressed their anger at the bottom of their hearts and returned to their seats upon seeing the two experts from Star Fort standing behind Shi Mo.

At that moment, all of them realized what the Corpse Palace had been planning from the beginning.

Based on the situation before them, they could see it was not a day or two since the Corpse Palace had made such plans.

Even though the Corpse Palace did not previously show much arrogance and had never proactively attacked the third-rated forces around them, it was because those third-rated forces were too large such that once the Corpse Palace wiped even one of them out, the remaining third-rated forces would immediately unite and deal with the Corpse Palace which they would then be out of solutions.

Therefore, the Corpse Palace could only wait for a chance to gather all the forces’ leaders and capture all of them in one move.

The Corpse Palace finally managed to invite the various forces’ leaders due to the incident with the Sword Alliance. At that moment, leaders of all three forces—the Sword Alliance, Divine Dragon Pavilion, and Purple Dress House—had gathered in the Corpse Palace and the Corpse Palace finally revealed their hidden intentions. They bared their fangs toward the various forces’ leaders who were like sitting ducks.

The beautiful dancers in the hall had already excused themselves.

The ambiance in the hall turned extremely quiet.

Sheng Long and the Purple House Master quietly sat by the tables with ashen expressions on their faces.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang still had an extremely indifferent expression.

“Alliance Master Su Han.” Gu Mo slowly looked over at Jian Wushuang while being seated at the highest position. “What do Alliance Master Su Han think about my suggestion?”

Gu Mo stared at Jian Wushuang as Shi Mo also looked over at him.

They were already too lazy to care about Sheng Long and Purple Dress House Master.

The Corpse Palace did not place much attention on Sheng Long and Purple Dress House Master as those two representing the Divine Dragon Pavilion and Purple Dress House were like sitting ducks to them. They had to agree even if they did not want to. However, both palace masters still had to pay attention to the Sword Alliance Master.

The Sword Alliance was formed around one year ago but had already taken over four cities. Together with the fact that they had many experts in their alliance, they had already surpassed the Corpse Palace with the only difference of the Sword Alliance not having any real Peak Heaven Ultimate God until that point in time.

Although Alliance Master Su Han was only a High-level Heaven Ultimate God, it was fortunate for them that his combat power was not weaker than Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods.

“I think what Palace Master Gu Mo said makes sense. A third-rated force is really not eye-catching in the Danyang Continent and can disappear just like that. However, if all four forces can be integrated and form a singular force, our overall power will skyrocket. We won’t be considered weak even amongst second-rated forces. At that time, we will have stronger powers in the Danyang Continent with the possibility of getting more profits,” said Jian Wushuang slowly.

“Oh, it looks like Alliance Master Su Han agrees.” Gu Mo looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“Alliance Master Su Han!” Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master also looked at Jian Wushuang in astonishment.

They originally wanted to work together with the Corpse Palace and take action against the Sword Alliance. At that moment, they had planned to unite with the Sword Alliance and fight off Corpse Palace together upon observing the Corpse Palace’s ambitions.

Who knew that Su Han would agree with the union mentioned by Gu Mo?

“It’s true that Sword Alliance Su Han has the cardinal principles in his mind. It’s no wonder the Sword Alliance can grow to such an extent in such a short time with an alliance master like yourself.” Gu Mo laughed heartily.

“I’m not done speaking yet.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand. “I agree with the union and even the integration of all four forces. However, I wonder who’ll be the leader of this new force?”

“Can’t Alliance Master Su Han see who’ll be the leader? In this world, the strongest earns the most respect and our Corpse Alliance is the strongest amongst our four forces,” said Gu Mo with a smile.

Jian Wushuang slowly stood up with a slight smile at the corners of his mouth as he spoke, “Really? I don’t think so. In my opinion, your Corpse Palace is also a third-rated force that’s unpresentable. You’re no different from the Seven Absolute Palace and Blood Water Gang that I previously wiped out.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The eyes of Gu Mo and Shi Mo suddenly narrowed when they heard that.

“Alliance Master Su Han, are you challenging the Corpse Palace’s authority?” Shi Mo coldly asked.

“Authority? A mere third-rated force dares talk about authority? You’re just two old dogs together with two Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods from Star Fort. Do you plan to swallow up my Sword Alliance with such a lineup? You guys are really dreaming here.” Jian Wushuang smiled in disdain.

The moment he finished speaking, a wave of majestic divine power suddenly surged out of his body like an awakened god.

This wave of overwhelming golden divine power concentrated speedily behind him. A humongous Golden God Shadow formed in the blink of an eye. The extremely tall 50,000 feet Golden God Shadow was not something the hall could contain. Therefore, the hall’s upper part immediately blasted open upon its appearance.

“Do you want to fight?” Shi Mo’s eyes grew cold as the aura of a Peak Heaven Ultimate God burst outward in an instant.

Although they were all Peak Heaven Ultimate God, Shi Mo’s divine power was much stronger than the Purple Beast Alliance Master and Seven Absolute Palace Master whom Jian Wushuang killed.

Shi Mo’s combat power was much stronger than ordinary Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods.

Meanwhile, Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master’s eyes suddenly lit up.

The Corpse Palace had invited two helpers from the Star Fort, added to a total of four Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods. The two of them dared not fight against Corpse Palace as Shi Mo was also incredibly strong.

However, everything was different at that moment when ‘Su Han’ took action.

Although ‘Su Han’ was just a High-level Heaven Ultimate God, he was someone who previously killed several Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods.

He might even win in that fight against Shi Mo.
