4443 Supreme Tarot’s Death

The Divine Life Palace. The sixth mountain range.

Jian Wushuang’s manor.

There was a faint mist on the cloud lake. Wisps of white mist rose from the surface of the lake and then dispersed. The water and the sky were the same color, giving off a profound feeling. It was as if one could comprehend the universe’s grand meaning just by staring at it’.

Jian Wushuang, Supreme Blood Wave, and the others were sitting on the bow of a black boat. The boat swayed on the surface of the lake without any wind, leaving two long and calm ripples, as if leaving scars on the surface of the lake.

Jian Wushuang, Supreme Blood Wave, and Supreme Jun Fu brewed tea and burned incense. It was a rather elegant scene.

“Jian Wushuang, Supreme Tarot was extremely powerful back then, and his name was well-known. It is not a big secret that he died in the universe, but it is rarely spread in the universe. Firstly, it is because they are afraid of distorting the truth. Secondly, they are afraid of causing panic and putting people themselves in danger.”

Supreme Blood Wave lifted his wide sleeves and picked up a ceramic teapot. He then poured a cup of tea for Jian Wushuang and Supreme Jun Fu.

The water was green in color, and waves of spiritual Qi mixed with the light fragrance of tea spread out. This cup of tea was very valuable. If an ordinary mortal drank from this cup, he would immediately shed his mortal body and become an Immortal.

Even Supreme martial artists like them would feel comfortable and their divine power would be nourished after drinking it.

“People are in a state of panic?”

Jian Wushuang picked up the teacup and took a sip. He then frowned and asked, “Supreme Blood Wave, what is the meaning of this?”

“Supreme Tarot wasn’t killed by someone from our universe,” Blood Wave replied.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and there was a flash of fierceness in them.

“Supreme Blood Wave, you’re saying that Supreme Tarot died at the hands of someone from the ‘Void Universe’?”

Supreme Blood Wave nodded his head, and his expression gradually turned serious. “That’s right. Three hundred chaos cycles ago, a group of experts called themselves ‘Devourers’. For some reason, they broke through the Offworld Battlefields and descended upon our universe. The leader of this group was known as the Devouring Emperor!”

“At that time, Supreme Tarot, who was on duty to suppress the Offworld Battlefield, happened to bump into them in the universe.”

As a result, the battle had entered a stalemate the moment it started!

No one knew the exact details of that battle. They only knew that the Supreme Tarot, who had been at the peak of the universe and had been undefeated through tens of thousands of battles, had suddenly died!

After that, Devourers came to the Tarot Divine Kingdom and killed billions of people. The Supreme Tarot could only send the Tarot Divine Sword into the depths of the universe before he died, forming the Tarot Ruins.

“After that, Lord Cosmos God arrived and exterminated the Devourers group. However, what’s worth mentioning about that battle is that the Devouring Emperor actually exchanged three blows with Lord Cosmos God and was not defeated. In the end, he even brought the Devourers group and retreated safely.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang frowned and his eyes flickered.

Others might not know how powerful Supreme Tarot was, but Jian Wushuang had fought with him in the Trial Space for 10,000 years, so he was very clear about it.

Supreme Tarot was an unparalleled mighty person whose Sword Dao illuminated the night. There were very few people in the entire universe who could defeat him, let alone kill him. There was no chance of escape.

“Jian Wushuang, it seems that the Devourers organization was the one who caused the disaster in Nine Luminaries Great Star Field,” Blood Wave continued.

“Eh? It’s them?” Jian Wushuang was shocked and his eyes lit up.

He naturally remembered the world-ending catastrophe in Nine Luminaries Great Star Field. If it were not for Heart Slayer and the others, he would have died in there.

However, from what those mysterious black-robed men had said, they were there for his master, Xuan Yi.

Jian Wushuang’s thoughts flashed like lightning and he instantly grasped a few key points.

Devouring Emperor… Void Universe… Offworld Battlefield… Cosmos God… And his own master, Xuan Yi!

These seemingly unrelated people were connected by an invisible thread.

Back then, during the Universe Great Clan Gathering, Cosmos God had told him that his master, Xuan Yi, was an old friend of his.

Then, what was the purpose of this situation?

What role did his Master, Xuan Yi, play in the overall situation?

And himself, Jian Wushuang… What was his identity?

Jian Wushuang fell into silence, his eyes flashing with thoughts.

He started to recall everything that had happened between him and Xuan Yi, from the beginning until now.

After a long time, Jian Wushuang heaved a long sigh and his eyes were filled with confusion. He looked up at the boundless starry sky and shook his head, “Master, Master, what do you want to do?”

Supreme Blood Wave and Supreme Jun Fu noticed this and exchanged a glance. “Jian Wushuang, what’s wrong?”

“It’s nothing,” Jian Wushuang turned around and smiled at them.

A moment later, Blood Wave and Jun Fu left.

Jian Wushuang sat at the bow of the boat alone, frowning and deep in thought.

“My Husband.” Leng Rushuang appeared behind Jian Wushuang. She stretched out her slender hand and gently smoothed out the frown between Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows.

“What’s wrong? Is there something bothering you? You can talk to me, perhaps I will have an idea.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath, shook his head, and said with a smile, “Shuang’er, I’m fine. Don’t worry about me.”

After saying that, Jian Wushuang stretched out his finger and gently scratched the bridge of Leng Rushuang’s nose. He then stood up and headed into the manor.

He had a premonition that the universe would be in chaos again soon.

Before that, the only thing he could do was to increase his strength.

As long as he was strong enough, he would be able to deal with the Void Universe, Devourers, or his master Xuan Yi’s plans.

Only strength was the foundation to stand tall in this world.

Bang!

Jian Wushuang stepped into the cultivation room and started a long seclusion.

For him, it was not difficult to break through to the Intermediate Supreme realm. He just needed to go with the flow and continuously condense his divine power.

After he broke through to the Intermediate Supreme realm, his strength would make another qualitative leap.

…

...

In the blink of an eye, 3,000 years had passed.

In the past 3,000 years, Jian Wushuang had been constantly condensing his strength and stabilizing his cultivation. Finally, he had pushed to the peak of the Primary Supreme realm!

For a Perfect Chaotic Lifeform like Jian Wushuang, breaking through the barrier of a major cultivation realm would be tens of millions of times more difficult than for ordinary people.

However, breaking through such a small cultivation realm was much easier.

Just as Jian Wushuang was about to take the step to break through to the Intermediate Supreme realm…

A Cosmic God decree suddenly arrived at the Divine Life Palace.

“Jian Wushuang, the Cosmos God has ordered you to come to the Supreme Temple!”

Supreme Blood Wave’s voice rang in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“What?”

Jian Wushuang slowly opened his eyes, and a sharp light flashed in his eyes.
