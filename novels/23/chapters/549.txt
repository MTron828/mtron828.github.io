Chapter 550: The Duel Begins!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In all, nine out of the League’s 33 temple masters were present. The others apparently did not have enough free time to come spectate.

“There have been countless life-death duels held since the establishment of the Monster-exterminating League. However, this is probably the first between a Divine Emperor and a Saint Realm expert, right?” The absolute beauty, Temple Master Pure Moon, said while bathing in the sunlight and radiating her incomparable warmth.

“A duel between a Divine Emperor and a Saint Realm expert does seem a little too much.”

A burly man who carried a giant axe on his back stood with his arms crossed and his crimson brows slightly furrowed. Although 17 temple masters had approved of Emperor Golden Snake’s proposal for a life-death duel, there was a small number of temple masters, including this burly man, who disapproved.

“Temple Master Iceberg, this life-death duel is all thanks to you. I’m really curious as to what price Golden Snake paid you such that you willingly got off your high horse to plead with each and every temple master. From what I know, the relationship between you two isn’t close enough that you would naturally put in so much effort for him.” Temple Master Pure Moon glanced at Temple Master Iceberg with a strange expression.

“Golden Snake regards me as his Master and has always paid me great respect. Why can’t I lend him a hand? Besides, although Jian Wushuang has unparalleled talent, he’s after all just an outsider, and it’s a matter of time before he leaves Monster Continent. Should I have helped him over someone who has dutifully served the League?”

“That does make sense.” Temple Master Pure Moon nodded and said no more.

Nothing could be done. Given Jian Wushuang’s outsider status, the League’s temple masters naturally had to side with Emperor Golden Snake even if to varying extents.

“Look, Jian Wushuang has arrived.” Temple Master Pure Moon suddenly raised her head.

Together with the numerous Divine Emperors and Divine Generals outside the restriction, the present Temple Masters raised their heads one after another and looked toward the valley.

On the vast void in the Bloodshed Valley, a beam of black Flowing Light whizzed past and quickly revealed a figure not too far in front of Emperor Golden Snake.

Carrying the Triple-kill Sword on his back, Jian Wushuang wore a slight smile on his face and crossed his arms.

“Jian Wushuang appears to be quite the confident sort, no?” Temple Master Pure Moon was taken by surprise.

Once he appeared in the Bloodshed Valley, the Saint Realm aura on his body began to spread without the slightest conceit.

“He’s indeed only a Saint Realm expert.”

“Although he’s only a Saint Realm expert, there’s a Second-grade Divine General’s token aura on his body. How’s that possible?”

“Hmph, what’s so impossible about that? Don’t you know that a month ago, there was a mass slaughter of demonic beasts in the East Camp, during which Master Jian revealed his strength to be much greater than that of Second-grade Divine Generals?”

“Yes, I just returned from East Camp and did hear about that. Jian Wushuang is indeed an incredible super genius.”

“What a pity that such a super genius is about to die!”

Sobbing and sighing noises filled the area around the Bloodshed Valley. However, the restriction completely sealed them off from reaching the battlefield. This allowed the two men in the battlefield, Jian Wushuang and Emperor Golden Snake, to focus completely on the duel.

However, noises from within the battlefield did transmit outward.

It was quiet within the valley. The only noise was that of a gentle passing breeze.

Jian Wushuang and Emperor Golden Snake stood facing each other at a distance of a hundred zhang (1094 feet).

Jian Wushuang’s expression was indifferent and his eyes carried no emotion. Conversely, Emperor Golden Snake stared at him with glacial eyes that conveyed a heinous resentment.

“You’re pretty brave, ” Emperor Golden Snake spoke in the frostiest of tones. “I’d thought you would flee to the territory occupied by demonic beasts and never return to the human world.”

“You’re not good enough to scare me away,” Jian Wushuang quipped nonchalantly.

“Hehe, those are some confident words, or should I say, self-flattery!” A smile formed on the corner of Emperor Golden Snake’s mouth. “If that’s the case, I shall take your life away today. It’ll count as revenge for my son even though it’s a month late.”

“Revenge? Or maybe I’ll send you to reunite with your son in the netherworld?” Jian Wushuang sneered.

“You can try.” A grim-faced Emperor Golden Snake opened his mouth and extended his tongue to lick his lips, resembling a venomous snake. An upsurging aura gradually diffused from his body.

“Come.” With scorching eyes and an eager heart, Jian Wushuang clenched his fists tightly.

He had previously exchanged blows with Su Ming, a Divine Emperor-level expert who possessed Dao enlightenment. At that time, he summoned all of his skill and effort but was nevertheless completely outclassed by the latter, for the gulf between them was too big.

However, having gone through several months of cultivation in the Monster Continent, he was no longer the same as his former self.

The current him longed for a life-death duel with a genuine Divine Emperor.

“Others may think that it’s far-fetched for a Saint Realm expert to duel a Divine Emperor. But in my case, that isn’t necessarily impossible.”

“Let’s fight!”

As Jian Wushuang involuntarily growled, an upsurging battle intent poured out of his body and shook the whole world.

Emperor Golden Snake exhaled a breath and made eye contact with Jian Wushuang, producing a tangible flame.

The next moment, swish!

The figures of both men vanished simultaneously.

They went missing at the same time.

“Huh?”

Outside the restriction, the spectating Divine Generals frantically looked over.?Before they could discern the figures of Jian Wushuang and Emperor Golden Snake, two figures had already convened in the centermost of the void in the Bloodshed Valley,

The Triple-kill Sword was already in Jian Wushuang’s hand. It promptly struck forth with irresistible force.

Similarly, the pitch-black machete in Emperor Golden Snake’s tight grip struck out.

A sword shadow and a blade light instantly collided.

The spectators were still frenziedly searching for the two figures when a violent boom erupted.

Boom!

The sound reverberated throughout the universe like a thunderclap that abruptly sounded from a fine and cloudless sky. Subsequently, the earth and mountains of the Bloodshed Valley began to quake violently.

At the point where the collision took place, an almighty power formed into a huge wave which swept unbridled in all directions at an astonishing speed.

Buzz!

The wave spread downward and instantly sank into the ground beneath the duel.

A huge pit with a diameter of nearly a hundred zhang?(1094 feet) appeared in front of everyone.
