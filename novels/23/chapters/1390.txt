“Ah!”

The man in a crimson robe, who was struck by Inextinguishable Light, immediately shouted and his face distorted in agony. He held his head and his body shivered while the huge consciousness giant collapsed.

“Go!”

Jian Wushuang roared and his Soul Power surged. There were four demonic dragons that swept out immediately. They entangled the two consciousness giants and suppressed them.

“Rubbish!”

“You are all Peak three-starred Soul Masters. Two against one, and the two of you are seized?”

Bei Xiu stood there as he watched the battle before him. He couldn’t help but curse. He flipped his palm and a black, mysterious longspear appeared in his hand.

“Huh?”

Jian Wushuang noticed Bei Xiu take out a longspear and his pupils contracted. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He could tell that the longspear wasn’t ordinary.

“It should be a treasure used for a consciousness attack. Jian Wushuang, you must be careful,” King of Venomous Worms reminded.

“Mm.” Jian Wushuang nodded and his face grew solemn.

“Go.”

Bei Xiu moved his wrist and the longspear shot forward. Whoop! The black longspear let out a terrifying force and broke through the void before it with ease.

Jian Wushuang saw that there was suddenly a huge black hole that had appeared from nowhere while there was a faint light in the core of the black hole.

Vroom!

Vast Soul Power soared into the air and Jian Wushuang formed a black tortoise shell on his body. The black tortoise let out a low bellow and blocked the black longspear.

Bang!

A loud bang and the black tortoise that had just formed shattered into pieces.

“So powerful?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

A powerful force erupted. Even though the force was resisted and weakened by the black tortoise, it could be compared favorably with an attack of an advanced Universe God in the Third Heaven in Eternal Chaotic World.

Even with Jian Wushuang’s divine body, dealing with such an impact immediately made him spit out a mouthful of blood and fly backwards like a bullet.

He only managed to stand on his feet again after a while. His face had grown very pale.

“So strong!” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He could tell that the power during the black longspear’s peak could be compared favorably with a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven’s. It was formed by consciousness entirely, a solid attack

“Luckily, the black tortoise shell has weakened by more than half and I have the Blood-killing Plate Armor to protect my body. Otherwise, against the longspear, I definitely would die,” Jian Wushuang was glad.

“Jian Wushuang, Bei Xiu is very strong. Stop concealing your power. Otherwise, you’ll die,” King of Venomous Worms said in Jian Wushuang’s head.

“I understand.”

Jian Wushuang nodded. He saw that the two Peak three-starred Soul Masters that Bei Xiu brought had recovered and they could totally join forces with Bei Xiu to fight against him altogether.

“Secret Skill of Star Palace!”

Jian Wushuang didn’t dare to hold back but performed the secret skill of Star Palace and the power spread across his whole body.

“I only have ten breaths time!”

“I can’t delay!”

“Make it quick!”

Jian Wushuang’s face turned cold and the very next moment, he rampaged towards where Bei Xiu was at.

“Asking for death!”

Looking at Jian Wushuang’s surprise attack, Bei Xiu smirked cooly. The black longspear in his hand had a layer of light and it flew out again.

Rumble!

There was a huge black hole in the void again.

There was madness in Jian Wushuang’s eyes and there was an enormous amount of Soul Power soaring out from his sea of consciousness.

“Inextinguishable Light!”

Swoosh!

The silent light attacked again.

The only difference was that Jian Wushuang performed the trick with the secret skill of Star Palace!

With the support of the power of star, the lights’ power suddenly increased ten-fold!

“The power that Bei Xiu’s longspear gave out was equal to an attack of a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven, while the Inextinguishable Light that I performed with my all, along with the support of the power of Star shouldn’t be any weaker than an attack of a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven. If they were to collide, they could definitely fight against one another!”

Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold and Blood Mountain Sword appeared from nowhere.

Blood Mountain Sword… Ever since he entered Soul Master Temple, he kept the sword in Qian Kun Ring. During the years in Soul Island, he always battles with his Soul attack but never once took out Blood Mountain Sword or used any Sword Technique.

Naturally, no one knew that he was also a powerful warrior besides his identity of a Soul Master!

Then, he was going to show his warrior power.

Bang!

A low, soft noise was heard. It wasn’t loud but the sound of large forces colliding came through. The entire battlefield drowned in a huge consciousness storm. It was a chaotic situation.

Just then, there was a swoosh in the consciousness storm!

A figure flew out.

“Huh?”

Bei Xiu stiffened, “He took my spear attack directly?”

Then, Bei Xiu resumed normalcy, “If so, let’s see how you handle this!”

Bei Xiu smirked, “This is the first time I have performed this trick after mastering it. You should feel honored.”

Then, there was a bright crimson light that shot out from Bei Xiu’s eyes. The crimson light was just like a scarlet sun, extremely eye-catching. Jian Wushuang, who was charging towards him, couldn’t help but lift his head to watch.

The moment he lifted his head, there was a strange strength.

“Dreamland?”

Jian Wushuang immediately came to a realization, then he smiled, “It’s such a joke that you’re trying to pull me into dreamland!”

Jian Wushuang wasn’t affected at all but continued to speed towards him.

“What?” Bei Xiu was surprised.

It was his biggest trump card. He had only mastered it after a long time. However, it didn’t have any effect on Jian Wushuang when he put it to play?

How is this possible?

He didn’t know that Jian Wushuang had already lit his Soul Fire. Plus, his Soul Power was extremely strong and very close to a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven’s. At times like this, dreamland and similar techniques like consciousness attacks, had to be performed by a Real God to have an effect on him.

He wasn’t afraid of dreamland at all. He was afraid of a solid attack that was consolidated through consciousness.

Just like the longspear that Bei Xiu used earlier. Although it was played via consciousness, it was solid. Its power equaled an attack of a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven that would be able to harm Jian Wushuang.

Bei Xiu’s strongest technique didn’t have any effect on Jian Wushuang, and then he saw Jian Wushuang holding a sword.

“Sword?”

“Warrior?”

Bei Xiu stared.
