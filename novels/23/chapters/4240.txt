4241 God Refining Tower

In front of the fortress, two guards in dark Blue iron armor were guarding the gate.

Flags with the word ‘Blue’ on them were planted high in the fortress, fluttering in the wind.

“Who are you?” The two guards crossed their long poles and blocked Jian Wushuang’s way. One of them asked expressionlessly.

“Blood Sword, I’m here to visit the pass guard.” Jian Wushuang cupped his hands and said with a smile.

“Blood Sword?”

The two guards narrowed their eyes.

Jian Wushuang’s reputation was quite well-known recently, so the two dark-Blue armored guards naturally knew him.

“Alright, Lord Blood Sword, please wait a moment. I’ll go see Lord Blue now.” The two guards cupped their hands at Jian Wushuang and then walked into the fortress.

A moment later, the armored guard walked out of the fortress and bowed. “Lord Blood Sword, Lord Blue has invited you in.”

“Many thanks.”

Jian Wushuang nodded at him and immediately strode into the fortress.

As soon as he entered the fortress, a huge spiral stone ladder appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Come on up.”

Then, Jian Wushuang heard a faint voice.

The voice was so clear that it was hard to tell if it was male or female.

“Alright,” he said.

Jian Wushuang nodded and replied. The owner of the voice must be Lord Blue, one of the nine overlords on the ancient road of stars.

Jian Wushuang was quite curious about this Lord Blue. He wanted to see what level the so-called ‘big shot’ level of battle strength on the ancient road of stars had reached.

Jian Wushuang walked up the stone stairs while thinking.

A moment later, a red wooden door appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Bang!

The next moment, the wooden door automatically opened.

A slender figure in Blue, sitting cross-legged on the ground, appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. Her face was covered with a veil, and only her beautiful eyes were exposed.

“Lord Blue?” Jian Wushuang shouted tentatively.

“Blood Sword, come in and sit.” Lord Blue pointed at the futon opposite him.

Jian Wushuang nodded and strode into the room. He sat cross-legged in front of Lord Blue.

“Lord Blue, I’ve come to visit this time for the sake of clearing the document.”

Lord Blue hummed in acknowledgment and replied, “Blood Sword, you can just call me ‘Blue’, but I can’t give you the official document.”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

Lord Blue glanced at Jian Wushuang, paused, and continued, “Blood Sword, the density of the laws in the first ten cities and the last eight cities are completely different. It can be said that they are two completely different worlds. If you want to pass the official document, that is not something that I can decide. That Lord has already set the rules. You have to clear the first three levels of the God Refining Tower before you can obtain the official document and enter the last eight cities.”

As he spoke, Lord Blue stretched out his hand and pointed upwards.

“Is that the Lord’s intention?”

Jian Wushuang thought for a moment and then replied in a deep voice, “Blue, then T’ll have to trouble you to bring me to the God Refining Tower.”

“It’s a small matter, not a big deal.” Blue nodded and then led Jian Wushuang out of the fortress.

Outside the fortress, Ruler Hao Jin saw Jian Wushuang coming out and asked hurriedly, “Lord Blood Sword, did you get the clearance document?”

“Not yet, wait for me here.”

Jian Wushuang replied and then followed ‘Blue’ toward a huge black tower in the Tenth City.

“Lord Blue!”

“We pay our respects to Lord Blue!”

On the way, the Ultimate Rulers of the tenth city all greeted ‘Blue’ respectfully.

‘Blue’ nodded slightly in response.

It could be seen that ‘Blue’ had a high prestige in the tenth city.

A moment later, the two of them arrived in front of the huge black tower.

This black tower had a total of nine floors, and was shaped like a L character. The higher it went, the sharper it became.

On the body of the tower, there were two words, ‘God-refining’, carved with sharp edges!

“Blood Sword, this is the God Refining Tower. The higher you go, the more difficult it will be. On the Ancient Path of Stars, no one has reached the top of the ninth level. The highest record is the one with the undying tyrant body, who reached the seventh level.” Blue introduced.

“If you want to get the clearance voucher for the Blood Sword, you only need to pass the first three levels. Do you understand my explanation?”

“Understood.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and no longer hesitated. after taking a deep breath, he strode toward the God Refining Tower.

“Blood Sword, let me remind you not to force yourself in this God Refining Tower. Try to reach as many levels as you can and don’t make things difficult for yourself. Over the years, quite a few Ultimate Rulers have died in the God Refining Tower.

“Finally, let me remind you that while it is dangerous inside the God Refining Tower, it is also a good fortune. Blue looked at Jian Wushuang’s back and said meaningfully.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang stopped in his tracks and fell into deep thought.

“Many thanks!”

Jian Wushuang thanked him and in the next moment, he walked into the God Refining Tower. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

…

The first level of the God Refining Tower was a huge black space. It was surrounded by darkness.

Roarrrr!

The roars of beasts came from the void.

Then, many monsters with sharp horns on their heads and four legs on the ground walked out of the void.

Their eyes were bloodshot as they bared their teeth at Jian Wushuang, with stinky saliva dripping from the corners of their mouths.

“Yuan siphoning beast?”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes. He was familiar with the monster. He had seen many of them when he had left the Divine Beginning Realm and traveled the universe.

The soul-devouring beasts were also known as the universe’s scavengers. Wherever a Ruler died in the universe, they would appear. They lived by absorbing the divine power and aura of a Ruler that had yet to dissipate after their death.

In terms of individual strength, these Yuan siphoning beasts were not even comparable to ordinary first-stage Rulers. However, when they grouped together, even ordinary Ultimate Rulers would have to retreat.

Every 100,000 years, there would be news of Yuan siphoning beasts killing Ruler-level cultivators. They were notorious.

“Roar!”

Accompanied by a series of roars, countless energy-devouring beasts surged out of the void and filled the space.

They stared at Jian Wushuang with their hind legs rubbing against the ground as if they were impatient to tear Jian Wushuang apart!

Bang!

Finally, when the first soul-devouring beast leaped and bit at Jian Wushuang, countless soul-devouring beasts also moved!

“Clay chickens and pottery dogs.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes glinted coldly and the Wuqi Divine Sword appeared in his right hand. Then, he slashed out a sword light and instantly, hundreds of soul-devouring beasts were crushed into powder!

In an instant, a feast of killing began, like a flower blooming at dawn.
