Chapter 2481: The Three Supreme Elders

Hum...

Two figures slowly stepped out of the spatial passage when it appeared.

One of them was a two meters tall, brawny elder with long purple hair. His towering figure stood there like a mountain.

The brawny elder had black thunderbolts flashing around his body which made him look exceptionally sturdy and formidable.

The other person was a slender young woman completely shrouded in a black robe. The pretty young woman stood there without making a sound as if she had turned into darkness.

The people on the glade turned tumultuous when they saw those two arrived.

“Ultimate Gods! Two Ultimate Gods!”

“These two are the other two Supreme Elders of the Great Compassion Sect. The black-robed woman was An Junzhu. I heard she’s a killer and the top assassin in the Wusha Wilderness. However, after she became a Supreme Elder a long time ago, she had stopped doing that. Otherwise, anyone could hardly survive after being targeted by her.”

“The purple long-haired elder is the tyrannical Lei Chong, who was also a reputable Ultimate God super expert in the Wusha Wilderness!”

“Lei Chong, An Junzhu, and Fan Jianxian. All the three Supreme Elders of Great Compassion Sect are here?”

A series of exclamations broke out from the crowd.

The various sects’ Divine Demons experts shuddered.

Ultimate Gods were highly exalted in Wusha Wilderness.

It was usually extremely difficult to even see an Ultimate God. No wonder everyone was in a stupor when they saw three Ultimate Gods appearing together.

Those three Ultimate Gods were there for Jian Wushuang alone!

“You are here? That’s quick.”

Jian Wushuang stood there watching the arrival of An Junzhu and Lei Chong with a hint of excitement in his eyes. “Along with Fan Jianxian, I hope these three will not let me down.”

Jian Wushuang’s fighting spirit had explosively risen in his heart.

The three Supreme Elders of the Great Compassion Sect had soon gathered together.

“Brother Jianxian, are you injured? What’s the matter?” Lei Chong asked. The Supreme Elders had addressed each other as brothers and sisters.

“It’s Jian Wushuang. Not only did he possess the power of an Ultimate God, but his combat skills are also at the peak of the Ultimate God realm. I was careless and got accidentally injured when I fought against him.”

“It’s him?” Lei Chong glanced over at Jian Wushuang.

“He’s only a Divine Demon, a Second-Class Divine Demon to be precise. Could he possibly have the combat prowess of an Ultimate God?” An Juzhu was surprised.

“Don’t underestimate him. His strength and capabilities are not confined to his cultivation level. Besides, he has an extremely high understanding of laws. Not only can he appear in two hologram images using the Space-time Law, but he has also mastered the First Stage of Transmigration Law. His sword skills are comparable to mine,” Fan Jianxian explained solemnly.

“It’s strange that he did not try to escape even after knowing I’ve sent a message to both of you. I believe he must have some strong backing which he hasn’t revealed yet.”

Lei Chong’s expression was cold. “Strong backing? No matter who or what that is, he will have to die for hurting you and killing so many Great Compassion Sect’s genius disciples. Let’s act together and kill him!”

Following Lei Chong’s stern orders, the three Supreme Elders of the Great Compassion Sect concurrently took action.

Hum!

A majestic sword intent rose as Fan Jianxian displayed his Sword World once again.

Although the Sword World was only a shell, it had a repression effect on Jian Wushuang.

While the Sword World rolled out...

“Junior Brother Fan, I’ll help you,” said An Junzhu, who waved while being shrouded in a black robe.

A stream of dark air current instantly welling up from her body before shot out in all directions at an astonishing speed.

The dark air currents soon enveloped the entire battlefield and formed a huge dark domain before combining with the Sword World and crashing down on Jian Wushuang.

“This move...” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered.

He recognized the technique performed by An Junzhu.

When the few Great Compassion Sect’s genius disciples besieged him in Saint’s Tomb, Yu Aoqing, one of the Twelve Minor Kings had performed the exact same move.

However, Yu Aoqing’s move was obviously not at the same power level as An Junzhu’s.

An Junzhu was Yu Aoqing’s master after all and had taught Yu Aoqing that technique.

The combination of the Sword World and the dark domain had greatly oppressed Jian Wushuang.

The three Supreme Elders made their moves and attacked Jian Wushuang with Lei Chong leading the attack!

It was three against one!

The various sects’ experts who acted as spectators had a strange expression on their faces.

In their opinion, Jian Wushuang’s strength was incredible nonetheless, but his age and cultivation level were still rather young. However, those three Great Compassion Sect’s Supreme Elders had joined forces against Jian Wushuang despite having lived for such a long time.

Such bullying behavior was rather embarrassing.

Then again, the world was never fair in the first place. Only strength and power were acknowledged!

The Great Compassion Sect’s background and strength were acknowledged, so no one present dared to say anything even if they thought those three Supreme Elders were bullying the younger generation.

“Thunder Exterminate!”

Majestic black thunderbolts pervaded Lei Chong. Under the guidance of his finger, the black thunderbolts in the void formed nine black dragons. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Each of those nine dragons contained terrifying world destruction powers. On the command of Lei Chong, those nine dragons roared and attacked Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang remained calm and advanced forward as the nine dragons headed for him.

Swash! Swash! Swash!

Nine horrifying sword-lights appeared at the same time and each of them decapitated one of those nine dragons’ heads.

Those nine dragons could barely even put up a struggle before collapsing instantly.

“I must say, that was rather powerful but my moves aren’t as simple as it seems either.” Lei Chong’s eyes were cold as he stared ahead. A large number of black thunderbolts rolled out and instantly formed a black hell after the nine dragons’ collapse, trapping Jian Wushuang within it.

Following that, a large number of black thunderbolts blasted upon Jian Wushuang.
