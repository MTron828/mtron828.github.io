“Dao Yuanzi, you must have entered the Crimson Lightning Region before. So in the process, what did you encounter?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“No, I was unimpeded all the way, Bloody Thunder couldn’t hurt me at all,” Dao Yuanzi said.

“Oh, is that so?” Jian Wushuang asked doubtfully.

At that moment, Dao Yuanzi appeared innocent but actually didn’t tell the truth.

“Idiot, I will not tell you even if it is dangerous.” Dao Yuanzi thought.

When Dao Yuanzi accidentally came to the Crimson Lightning Region and the Thunder Sea, he knew that besides Bloody Thunder, there were also Sacred Thunders of Extermination, which appeared occasionally.

Dao Yuanzi had encountered a Sacred Thunder of Extermination once, but he was immune.

“But Jian Wushuang will have no time to respond, so he will be doomed to die. Once he dies, I can survive and escape,” Dao Yuanzi murmured. “Please come, Sacred Thunder of Extermination!”

But Dao Yuanzi was unaware that Jian Wushuang was vigilant. Once Jian Wushuang was threatened by a crisis, he would not hesitate to kill Dao Yuanzi first.

Fortunately, Jian Wushuang did not encounter the destruction of the gods and the journey to the bloody thunder sea was alright.

After crossing the thunder sea, Jian Wushuang saw a vast open space, in the middle of which lay a huge corpse.

This corpse was as tall as tens of thousands of feet. Even though it had collapsed many years ago, it still had an incomparable power.

Seeing this corpse, Jian Wushuang got excited.

“You were not lying. There is indeed a corpse of a strong man from the Ancient Clan here.” Jian Wushuang smiled as he noticed that at the forefront of the huge corpse, there was a gray light in-between the eyebrows.

The light was very weak, and Jian Wushuang couldn’t see what it was.

“My lord, the gray light should be the blood lineage left by that strong talent, but it is very difficult to get it,” said Dao Yuanzi.

“Oh? What do you mean?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“On the way to the corpse, there are hidden Dao Soldiers, which may have been left by the dead strongman when he collapsed. Those Dao Soldiers will prevent incomers from reaching the corpse. I also wanted to approach the corpses but at that moment I hadn’t recovered yet so I was defeated by the soldiers.”

“So how could you know that the strong man left his blood lineage when you haven’t approached it at all?” Jian Wushuang questioned Dao Yuanzi.

“Well…” Dao Yuanzi paused for a long time and said, “I guessed it.”

Jian Wushuang knew Dao Yuanzi didn’t always tell the truth.

But one thing was for sure. There was indeed a gray light in between the eyebrows. Even though it was not lineage blood, it would be very important.

“How powerful are those soldiers?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“They are weaker than human cultivators, equivalent to the early stage of Chaos Gems, but on the journey you will meet a lot of them,” said Dao Yuanzi.

Jian Wushuang was worried. The early stage of Chaos Gem had the same power as Sir Gods. And there might be many soldiers.

It would not be so easy to get to the corpse.

“Anyway, I will try.”

Jian Wushuang murmured, and then approached the corpse.

But soon, many Dao Soldiers with bronze armor appeared.

There was a sudden sound as the ground cracked, followed by the appearance of burly figures.

These soldiers were all the same in their appearance and size and they all had a bronze-colored axe in their hands.

Six Dao soldiers in total.

Jian Wushuang started to generate his power.

At that moment, the six soldiers all rushed toward him.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

He saw six bright bronze lights shimmering, and six axes went to Jian Wushuang.

“Go to hell!”

Jian Wushuang waved his swords, the power of which forced six soldiers back.

“These Daoist Soldiers have only reached the level of the general Sir Gods and their swordsmanship is just mediocre. They can’t stop me.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

He was only tens of thousands of miles away from the corpse. Usually he could easily pass through the distance, but this time, because of the numerous soldiers, the journey would take longer.

The ground split, and many soldiers rushed out one by one.

In the instant, Jian Wushuang was surrounded by one hundred soldiers.

Most of the soldiers were bronze-armored soldiers, but at the forefront there were four Dao Soldiers wearing silver armor. They were obviously stronger than those in bronze. Jian Wushuang guessed that they would be of the level of an Emperor God.

At that moment, they all rushed to Jian Wushuang like wasps.
