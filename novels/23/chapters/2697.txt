Chapter 2698: Sweep Everything With One Move!

“You’re undoubtedly the strongest Heaven Ultimate God I’ve seen since stepping foot in the Danyang Continent. Unfortunately, you’re still unqualified to kill me. Not only that, but you also need to leave behind your life here today.” Jian Wushuang’s loud noise reverberated across the entire void.

The experts looking at the battle from the surrounding area were completely amazed.

“This Su Han...” Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master also stared at Jian Wushuang with a hint of expectation in their eyes.

On the other hand, Fo Wu had a cold gaze in his eyes.

“How can you shamelessly brag!!” Fo Wu once again carried out his attack with the battle saber at hand after shouting.

Although he still had a humongous red sun behind him, the saber skill he just used felt like the setting sun. It had a sense of beauty under the autumn breeze.

Jian Wushuang glanced at Fo Wu and the Nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords around him once again integrated into a huge black divine sword.

This black divine sword once again came rushing outward with shocking power.

“This is useless. Although your sword formation is very strong, it’s only a joke to me,” yelled Fo Wu coldly.

“Really?” Jian Wushuang only lightly smiled before raising his palm and pointed toward the void Fo Wu was located.

Unlimited powers of Space-time Law came sweeping over with his finger-pointing.

Space-time Divine Technique—A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique!!

Hum!!

Fo Wu’s figure paused in the middle of the void without any warnings.

He remained in his attacking position with his saber with the humongous red sun still behind him. However, his actions had completely paused.

The Space-time paused!

It was the ‘A Finger Pointing Heavenly’ technique.

If Jian Wushuang performed that skill at his full capacity, nobody under the Grand Ultimate God realm could withstand his current strength, unless that person was an expert with an extremely high understanding of Space-time Law.

Even Fo Wu could not do it.

He was completely caught in the stagnation of Space-time. The Space-time stagnation only lasted for a short moment in less than the time for a person to blink. However, that amount of time was very crucial to experts.

It could be seen that the black divine sword Jian Wushuang controlled was like a huge mountain-sized drill directly attacking Fo Wu’s divine body without any obstructions.

Fo Wu’s space-time had just recovered to normal before he was immediately hit by that horrible attack.

Even though his body managed to endure the attack, he immediately vomited a mouthful of blood at that moment as the front section of his divine body had sunken in.

His figure was immediately thrown backward like a kite with broken strings.

“You haven’t died from that attack? It looks like your physical protective abilities aren’t weak.” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently.

Fear was written all over Fo Wu’s face as he finally stabilized himself. He could feel the wounds he had suffered were quite serious.

However, what truly frightened him was the technique Jian Wushuang unleashed just moments ago.

He had no idea what happened as the sword formation was some distance away from him before it suddenly knocked onto his divine body.

He could not respond nor had the time to block the attack.

He was instantaneously wounded badly which greatly damaged his true strength.

“What had happened? What skills did Su Han use?” Fo Wu was in shock.

The unknown was always the most horrifying.

He was horrified because he had no idea what Jian Wushuang did moments ago.

After all, that attack had managed to wound him badly and he would die if that happened one or two more times.

However, the black divine sword once again came toward him under Jian Wushuang’s control.

“Escape, I have to escape!

“I’ll die if I don’t escape!”

Those thoughts immediately appeared in Fo Wu’s heart and quickly took over his mind.

It was his intuition that he achieved after experiencing many extreme battles and near-death escapades before achieving Peak Heaven Ultimate God realm.

He also deeply believed in his intuition.

Therefore, he did not hesitate at that moment and immediately turned around before running backward at his fastest speed.

He opted to escape!

The last time he ran away was in a one-on-one battle due to coming across a Grand Ultimate God.

However, he could only escape at that moment despite facing someone who was a realm lower than him.

The people around them were stunned by that scene as they were observing the battle.

However, Jian Wushuang was unwilling when he saw that Fo Wu wanted to escape.

Jian Wushuang could be seen raising his hand once again and pointed to the void where Fo Wu with his finger. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique!

That technique required an extremely huge amount of divine power to activate it.

An ordinary Peak Heaven Ultimate God would not be able to use that technique for a second time after forcefully doing it the first time even if they had quite a huge solid of divine power.

However, Jian Wushuang was different as his divine power was as vast as an ocean. The divine power he used was not even a tenth of his total powers even when using that technique, enabling him to activate that technique several times in a battle.

It was his second time activating the technique at that moment

The same scene unfolded once again.

Fo Wu was once again paused in the middle of the void.

He remained in his escaping posture with no changes to his terrified facial expression.

He had completely paused there while the black divine sword that kept following behind him was not affected at all. It once again attacked Fo Wu like a flash of black lightning. At that moment, Fo Wu’s divine body could not persist any longer and started falling apart.

“How... How’s this possible?” His space-time had already returned to normal before Fo Wu died. He saw that he was once again attacked and also noticed he was losing his vitality at a crazed speed.

He had a horrifying expression on his face and a heart filled with disbelief.

However, his life had been completely cut off in the end.

Fo Wu—the famous top ten Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods in the Danyang Continent and second only to the Star Fort Master was killed on the spot!

“A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique. This technique is really strong!” Jian Wushuang exclaimed uncontrollably when he saw Fo Wu was killed.

Regardless of having a Heaven Ultimate God’s strength—even if that person could enter the top ten, top five, or even top three positions in the Danyang Continent—they would not be able to withstand that attack as long as that person was not good at the Space-time Law. He could wipe out 99% of those Heaven Ultimate Gods with just that technique alone.

Although Fo Wu was very strong, he was not proficient at the Space-time Law and was therefore also included in the 99% range.

Fo Wu was killed within two moves without any chance of struggling.

Jian Wushuang did not have time to use his many skills as a result.

Jian Wushuang also exhaled softly after killing Fo Wu before slowly looking over at the Corpse Palace and Star Fort’s experts. “Fo Wu is dead. The rest of you are next.”
