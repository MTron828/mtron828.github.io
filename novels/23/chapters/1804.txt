Chapter 1805: The Secrets of the Ancient Times

Eyebrows were the concentration point of the practitioners’ soul and power.

For the Ancient God Clan, for example, their Ancient God Stars were gathered in the eyebrows.

And Jian Wushuang thought it was absolutely not a coincidence that the Green Fire World was just in between.

“Maybe the Green Fire World was not born from this ancient battlefield, but from this head?” Jian Wushuang thought.

Jian Wushang shook his head, considering his own speculation to be crazy.

After a more detailed understanding of the surrounding array, Jian Wushuang turned and left.

In a secret room, Jian Wushuang sat alone, flanked by Qin Yue and He Xin.

Jian Wushuang took the Blood Mountain Sword out.

“Dao Yuanzi.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice spread into the sword. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In the sword, two people were suppressed.

The two men were Dao Yuanzi and the First Sir God. What about other people who had been suppressed by the sword before? They had been killed by Jian Wushuang after being tortured.

“My Devil, please figure out some ways to let us escape from this!” The First Sir God cried and screamed.

He thought Dao Yuanzi would save him when he was stuck in the sword.

Unexpectedly, in the end, even Dao Yuanzi had been suppressed.

“Shut up, or I will kill you!” Dao Yuanzi glanced at the First Sir God indifferently.

Actually Dao Yuanzi didn’t care whether his subordinate would survive or not.

But Dao Yuanzi did want to escape from here, but he didn’t have that capability. Now, his own life was at the mercy of Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang was so vigilant. He left a Soul Stamp on my body and I couldn’t escape his control anyway. He still keeps me here and won’t allow me to go out.” Yuan Daozi complained.

As Jian Wushuang had guessed, Dao Yuanzi could not really surrender to him.

The reason why Dao Yuanzi had allowed Jian Wushuang to leave the stamp was that there was no other way for him to survive.

Dao Yuanzi was an ancient expert with many resources. As long as his strength was restored, he could easily revoke Jian Wushuang’s Soul Stamp so that he could get rid of Jian Wushuang’s control and do whatever he wanted.

Unfortunately, his tricks didn’t work. Jian Wushuang knew his plan and didn’t let him go.

“Dao Yuanzi!”

Hearing Jian Wushuang’s voice, Dao Yuanzi was surprised but immediately responded with a humble and respectful attitude. “Is there anything I can do to serve you, my lord?”

“I have something to ask you. You are a strong talent of ancient times so you must know a lot about the battles of the ancient time.”

“I will answer with everything I know.” Dao Yuanzi responded.

Jian Wushuang sneered and thought, “Dao Yuanzi is really good at flattering.”

Before he had been suppressed, he had been arrogant without even noticing Jian Wushuang.

But now, he had bent down to Jian Wushuang.

“Don’t expect me to release you.” Jian Wushuang thought in private, but he didn’t show it to Dao Yuanzi. He asked Dao Yuanzi, “Tell me, what was the cause of the war?”

This is the question that had haunted Jian Wushuang for a long time.

That was a war so destructible that all things, including the most powerful era, had collapsed.

What was the reason for that?

And Jian Wushuang wanted to know whether it had something to do with his master.

However, Dao Yuanzi shook his head and said, “Sorry, my Lord. The war broke out suddenly and so quickly that many people, including the strong talents, had no idea of what happened, and I only had a tiny role in that battle. So I really don’t know the answer?”

Jian Wushuang was not surprised about the answer.

He had also heard from Long Qi that the war had broken out suddenly and many things were still unknown for many people.

Dao Yuanzi said, “But I know that in the war, many powerful sects united and attacked the terrain of the Seven Star Black Sect, which mobilized all their power to fight the enemies.”

“Though the enemies were so powerful, the Seven Star Black Sect still managed to contain them.”

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Now Jian Wushuang could imagine how powerful the Seven Star Black Sect was.

“So what was the final result of this battle?” Jian Wushuang continued to ask.

But Dao Yuanzi shook his head. “Master, the battle was terribly fierce. I am just a nobody. At that time I was so scared that I hid from the war.”

Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Dao Yuanzi had been very powerful in his prime, equivalent to an Emperor of the Eternal Chaotic World.

But with that power he was not capable of fighting in the war and had even had to hide!

“It seems that the ancient time was much stronger than I thought.” Jian Wushuang murmured.

But suddenly, something occurred to Jian Wushuang. He changed his tone and asked, “You mention that you didn’t participate in the war. But how can you explain your wound? You could only recover after so many years, so it must have been caused by a great power.”
