Chapter 2437: Massacre

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

There were a hundred genius disciples and among them were ten First-Class Divine Demons. With such a huge lineup, even a Peak Divine Demons would admit defeat and flee.

Due to that, those genius disciples were extremely confident in facing Jian Wushuang.

“Huh, so what if you’re powerful?”

“I don’t believe alone you can face off a hundred of us?” The strong man had a wide grin.

Jian Wushuang, who was standing in the void in front of him transformed into several shadows.

The strong man curled his lips. “Do you still want to run away from the fight? I’ll hunt down the Ice Queen if you run away!”

As soon as that strong man finished his sentence...

Slash!

Jian Wushuang’s figure appeared in the crowd without a warning.

Hum—the void filled with a sense of bone-chilling atmosphere that they even spotted snow falling.

At the same time as the falling snow, a dreamy sword-light lit up.

The sword-light completely integrated with the void’s snowflakes.

The first style of Purple Blood Swords Skill—Falling Snow!

Slash!

A sword-light swept across and 13 heads instantly flew out at the same time. All 13 heads still had that crazed ferocious look when they were being decapitated from their necks.

“What?”

The people around him were shocked.

There was no way that 13 heads could be thrown out at the same time, such a scene was rare.

The sword-light fell along with falling snowflakes and Jian Wushuang’s figure disappeared once again.

Slash!

When he appeared again, Jian Wushuang was still in the crowd and in front of him stood more than a dozen genius disciples including a First-Class Divine Demon.

Jian Wushuang wielded his sword.

It was just a simple front stab across with his sword and there was an instant rumbling—the void was filled with blood and the whole world seemed to have completely plunged into a Shura’s Hell with blood everywhere.

Jian Wushuang, the sword in his hand, and even the sword technique that he used were completely turned into blood.

That was the fourth style of Purple Blood Sword Technique—Blood Demon!

The First-Class Divine Demon was the first to react to Jian Wushuang’s sword.

“Hurry up, let’s act together and block his sword.”

The First-Class Divine Demon was terrified. If he was alone, he would not have dared to parry off Jian Wushuang’s sword, but it was different when there were more than a dozen of them together.

Hearing his shouts, more than a dozen genius disciples around immediately took action.

A series of brutal attacks superimposed on top of each other and bombarded Jian Wushuang’s bloody sword.

Boom!

There was a loud noise when the two forces of attacks collided. The area was completely reduced to a sea of ​​blood.

In the center of the blood sea, a defense formed by more than a dozen genius disciples collapsed. The blood-red sword-light crushed everything and penetrated into the group. Numerous smaller blood-colored sword-lights came out from the larger sword-light and formed a huge blood-colored sword net.

The net had more than a dozen genius disciples within it.

“Damn it!”

The expressions of those genius disciples drastically changed.

Swoosh!

The sound of those small sword-lights entering their body came repeatedly and more than a dozen genius disciples, except for the First-Class Divine Demon who crushed the Safety Token and escaped at the nick of time, had their divine bodies cut into several pieces or even dozens of pieces by the sword net.

Blood and flesh scattered everywhere.

Those genius disciples were ruthlessly killed in a blink of an eye.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s figure disappeared again.

When he appeared again, he was in front of the strong man who shouted fiercely before.

There was another First-Class Divine Demon who stood beside that strong man.

For Jian Wushuang, there was no difference between First-Class Divine Demons and Second-Class Divine Demons.

Jian Wushuang drew out his sword.

In that second when his sword was swung across, ripples appeared in the void.

Time seemed to be completely frozen.

That was Jian Wushuang’s self-invented space-time sword technique—The First Style, Cutting Snow!

That strong man had a feeling like never before. He knew that death was near.

His eyes were filled with terror and without any hesitation, he grabbed his Safety Token.

Just when he was about to crush his Safety Token. Boom!

A huge blow of soul power penetrated into his ​​consciousness and bombarded his soul.

It was a soul attack secret technique—Three Golden Divine Light!

Jian Wushuang’s soul attack skill was not strong. After all, he had yet to recover his power to the level of a Divine Demon Realm. His soul attack skill was just detrimental to ordinary Second-Class or Third-Class Divine Demons.

Luckily, although that strong man was a First-Class Divine Demon, his soul power was not strong and probably only at the level of a Second-Class Divine Demon. In addition, he was defenseless as he was not prepared for an attack on his soul.

That made him miss the opportunity to crush his Safety Token.

Swoosh!

The blurry sword-light swept across and cut that strong man’s head off.

Before breathing his last, the strong man was in a state of stupor. “He’s not only skillful with a sword but also good at launching soul attacks?”

The strong man died. The First-Class Divine Demon who was beside him saw that the situation was no good, hence he crushed his Safety Token and fled.

Jian Wushuang took away the strong man’s Interspatial Ring before his body disappeared again.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s figure repeatedly disappeared and reappeared among the crowd.

He was too fast, making it almost impossible for those genius disciples to catch hold of him.

Every time he appeared, he was accompanied by a terrifying sword-light.

The sword-light was invincible.

No one could resist it.

Regardless of First-Class or Second-Class Divine Demons, those who had a Safety Token instantly crushed it to save their own lives. Those without one would be dead in no time.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

His repeated appearances sent heads flying.

Those headless bodies fell down like raindrops.

In an instant, Jian Wushuang had disappeared and appeared about seven times, back and forth which was enough to scare the remaining genius disciples witless. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Run!”

“Run now!”

The genius disciples who were still alive screamed and frantically fled into the surrounding void at top speeds.

Everyone was running for their lives.

They did not stop until they were in the void, which was further away from the battlefield.

After that, with horrified eyes, they turned and looked towards the battlefield ahead.
