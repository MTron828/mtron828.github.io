Chapter 2483: Destroyed

“He’s not dead?” Lei Chong had lightning in his eyes.

“Not only is he not dead, but the breath of his divine power also has not weakened. It seems he was unfazed,” said An Junzhu coldly.

“This brat...” Fan Jianxian’s expression was extremely ugly.

On the ground, Jian Wushuang raised his head to look at the three Ultimate Gods above and slowly receded his smile.

“Among the three Ultimate God experts, Lei Chong’s attack was brutal and is the strongest among the three. An Junzhu is good with the Law of Darkness and domain control. She is able to derive a clone of herself and she also has perfect assassination skills. She is indeed someone extraordinary. Fan Jianxian appeared to be the weakest of them,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

“These three Ultimate Gods have joined forces and it’s indeed difficult for me to contend with them single-handedly. If that is the case...”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with a sharp glint.

The Stellar Strength which had integrated into his divine body’s blood and essence instantly surged and spread from within his body. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Seven Stars Secret Technique...Activate!

The Seven Stars Secret Technique was one of the five most powerful secret techniques of the Seven Stars Black Sect. It was much more advanced than the Stellar Star Secret Technique practiced by Jian Wushuang in his previous life.

The Stellar Star Secret Technique he performed in his past life was heaven-defying. However, without the will of Heaven Way’s influence, he would require a long recovery period before performing it again.

On the other hand, the Seven Stars Secret Technique was different. Once the Seven Stars Secret Technique was refined and fully integrated with divine powers—as long as the cultivator had sufficient divine power—one could perform and repeat the technique over and over again without the need to take a break, hence the reason it was considered one of the strongest secret technique of the Seven Stars Black Sect.

Jian Wushuang began to execute the secret technique with nothing holding him back. With the power of Stellar Strength, Jian Wushuang’s divine power breath spread out at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Initially, he had just crossed into the Second-Class Divine Demon realm. However, he soon progressed to Peak of the Second-Class Divine Demon realm in a short time. He was only a small step away from becoming a First-Class Divine Demon. Having made that achievement, he relaxed his pace a little.

“The peak of the Second-Class Divine Demon... Unfortunately, the first volume of the Seven Stars Secret Technique could merely help me improve by half a realm at most. If I can refine the second volume of the Seven Stars Secret Technique, I would be able to cross into First-Class Divine Demon.”

“Well, it’s good enough.”

Jian Wushuang balled up his fists to examine his powers and felt his divine powers improved quite a fair bit.

At the same time, his majestic divine power burst out wildly from behind him, and in the blink of an eye, a huge Golden God Shadow was formed.

The Golden God Shadow had then increased in volume and risen to 900 feet from Jian Wushuang’s realm improvement!

The 900 feet of Golden God Shadow was very close to the Divine God of Punishment second stage and could assist Jian Wushuang in his strength improvement.

Using two major secret techniques simultaneously, Jian Wushuang’s overall strength instantly rose to a whole new level.

“Now, I can have a good fight with all of you.”

Jian Wushuang raised his head. His sharp eyes met the three Ultimate Gods above.

Under his gaze, the three Ultimate Gods felt a tremendous pressure on them.

“This brat’s divine power breath seems to have improved?” Fan Jianxian commented.

“I felt it too. The Golden God Shadow of his seems to be powerful as well.” An Junzhu looked solemn.

“No matter what trump card he has, we have three Ultimate Gods join forces. It should be enough to put up a fight. How can we be afraid of him?” Lei Chong said coldly.

Both Fan Jianxian and An Junzhu nodded in agreement. At the very next moment, hum... The Sword World and dark domain once again oppressed Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently. “It’s that domain again? Do you think I don’t have one? Now, I want to see whose domain is stronger.”

Jian Wushuang waved his large hands and several palm prints were sent directly towards the void ahead.

“The Prison of Punishment!”

Rumbling... The golden divine power suddenly erupted from the Golden God Shadow and gushed from all directions at a terrifying speed.

The surrounding world was originally covered in the dark air current domain of An Junzhu. However, under the crazy impact of the golden divine powers, the dark air currents were retreating. In just an instant, the dark air current domain was shattered by the impact and had completely collapsed.

“Did he just crush my domain?”

Even An Junzhu was shocked to see what happened.

After her domain collapsed, the golden divine power was still steady going forward, forming a huge golden divine power ocean that engulfed the entire battlefield in the blink of an eye. Thereafter, the golden divine power ocean transformed into a huge golden prison.

“This is...”

“The Golden Prison?”

Many various sects’ genius disciples were shocked to see the scene.

Most of them had seen the Golden Prison in Saint’s Tomb.

None of the nearly 50 First-Class Divine Demons who tried to kill Jian Wushuang had a chance to escape due to this infamous Golden Prison. They were either mercilessly slaughtered by Jian Wushuang, or they had to crush their Safety Token to escape from the tomb.

The Golden Prison had reappeared once again.

What was different from before was that the Golden Prison currently had three Great Compassionate Sect’s Supreme Elders within it. Three Ultimate Gods!

They were trapped inside the Golden Prison.

Lei Chong, An Junzhu, and Fan Jianxian looked solemn. They did not take it lightly just because their opponent was a Divine Demon.

Suddenly... Boom!

Following the control of Jian Wushuang’s mind, the golden divine power swept across and acted on the bodies of those three Ultimate Gods.

They instantly felt a huge mountain weighing billions of pounds was on top of them. The oppression had greatly reduced the power they could exert.

“This domain is much stronger than what I’ve displayed!” An Junzhu said coldly.

“Be careful!” Lei Chong added.

Jian Wushuang, who was under their close observation, made a move!

Swoosh!

His figure flickered and left two apparitions in the void.

The infinite sword intent discharged by Jian Wushuang was like a hungry and ferocious beast as it lurched frantically towards its prey.

“Look what I’ve got,” screamed Lei Chong.

Black thunderbolts surged out of his body that had soared to a height of five meters and formed a black thunderbolt prison of a hundred meters diameter from him.

He stamped his sole hard and the void under his feet immediately cracked open as he held a large hammer in both palms and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Following that, his two large hammers were flung out.
