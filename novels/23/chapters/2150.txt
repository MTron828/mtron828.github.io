Kaiser Blood!

One of three leaders in the Three Emperors World, and the strongest expert amongst them!

Even the other two leaders looked to him for leadership. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

But Kaiser Blood barely showed up.

The previous time the Supreme Emperor Stone had been destroyed by Jian Wushuang and others in the Imperial City, it had been Lord Fen and Demon King Chen Yu that had moved out. He hid in the shadows.

But now, Kaiser Blood could no longer sit still.

The Void above the Imperial City was Kaiser Blood’s fuzzy figure. His bloodshot eyes got a good look of the entire battlefield.

His heart sunk upon the sight.

At this moment, boom!

A terrifying aura billowed over him.

Kaiser Blood looked up, and realised Emperor Bai had appeared in front of him.

Emperor Bai’s giant golden shadow remained standing, its desire for battle rising tremendously.

“Kaiser Blood, I finally get to meet you.”

Emperor Bai’s voice was clear, with vast golden Divine Power coming out from him everytime he spoke.

It became a huge ocean of golden Divine Power.

Emperor Bai was at the centre of the wave of golden Divine Power. He clenched his fists and threw a punch.

The punch stirred the entire golden Divine Power Sea, and arrived at Kaiser Blood within the blink of an eye.

“Emperor Bai?”

Kaiser Blood squinted. He had heard of many stories regarding Emperor Bai, so he dared not let his guard down.

Immediately, he took a single step, releasing a horrifyingly bloody aura throughout the entire battlefield.

Kaiser Blood’s hazy right fist was covered by a crimson glow. He pointed his finger towards the Void in front of him.

With a finger, boundless crimson light burst forth, and a huge sculpture was formed in the Void.

The sculpture was taller than Emperor Bai’s ninety-nine thousand foot tall golden shadow, at a sitting position to top it up.

It was a crimson Divine Demon. Its three eyes were all fixated on Emperor Bai.

An ancient aura was dispersed.

At the same time, dong!

Dong!

Dong!

Dong!

Ancient bell sounds meandered across the heavens.

The bell sound contained a special charisma, stopping many Cultivators below Great Emperor level, leaving them dazed.

The crimson Divine Demon made its move.

The gigantic palms of his clapped.

With one clap, heavens and earth fell silent. The palm was increasing in size.

Finally, the palm came into contact with Emperor Bai’s golden shadow’s fist.

Peng!

Emperor Bai was slightly taken aback. The golden shadow behind him dimmed down quite a bit as well.

The crimson Divine Demon statue in front of him on the other hand collapsed immediately, as the crimson light scattered out.

Within moments, the crimson Divine Demon was destroyed, blowing Kaiser Blood away. Kaiser Blood took a moment to compose himself.

“Indeed, the strongest expert in the world,” Kaiser Blood said, his bloodshot eyes still fixed on Emperor Bai.

“You’re not too bad yourself, much stronger than Lord Fen and Demon King Chen Yu,” Emperor Bai said, but there was doubt in his eyes.

He could sense that Kaiser Blood’s situation was peculiar.

“It’s a shame I do not have the time today. If I did, I would really like to witness your Inverse Cultivation for myself,” Kaiser Blood said.

“Trying to escape?” Emperor Bai asked.

Kaiser Blood simply smiled back.

As he smiled, countless crimson light rays shone on him.

Kaiser Blood at that moment had become a huge dazzling crimson sun.

The crimson sun shone its bloodshot rays all over, forming a continuous sea of blood, sweeping in from all directions.

The sea of blood was so vast, and the power it contained was extremely unique.

Even Emperor Bai’s golden Divine Power Sea could not stop it.

In an instant, the sea of blood covered every corner of the Imperial City’s battlefields. Space Tunnels started to appear from that very sea.

Those Space Tunnels were formed haphazardly by the sea of blood, numerous and all located near the Three Emperors World experts.

The Space Tunnels released a terrifying suction immediately. Many Three Emperors World experts, like the average Emperor Gods, Sir Gods, were all drawn in involuntarily, and eventually disappeared into the Space Tunnel along with other Great Emperors.

In an instant, the Three Emperors World experts that had flooded the battlefields all disappeared.

That included the Great Emperors, including Lord Fen, Demon King Chen Yu, and Ba Su.

The Eternal Chaotic World experts were simply unable to stop them.

When Jian Wushuang realised Ba Su was gravitating towards the Space Tunnel, he immediately performed the Moon Picking Skill in an attempt to seal the surrounding spacetime.

But he realised, as he was about the perform the Moon Picking Skill, he was blown away by the sea of blood’s impact. He could not force Ba Su to stay.

Only one person from the Three Emperors World forces remained in the Imperial City.

It was Kaiser Blood!

“Impressive, this Kaiser Blood,” Jian Wushuang was fixated on him, slightly shocked by what he had done.

The Three Emperors World was already on the verge of defeat, so all they had to do was carry on hunting them down, and the enemy would have been left defeated.

They could have kept at least half of the enemy forces.

But with one move from Kaiser Blood, he directed all the experts to safety immediately.

The method was heart-wrenching.

“Emperor Bai!”

The blood lord located at the centre of the sea of blood spoke. “Our Three Emperors World’s forces were caught off-guard this time. You will not be so lucky next time.”

Kaiser Blood then looked towards Jian Wushuang.
