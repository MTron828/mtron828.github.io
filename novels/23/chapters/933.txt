Chapter 934: Instant Extermination in a One-versus-three Battle

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“I-It’s too terrifying!”

“What inhuman feats! Are they gods?”

“A full-fledged war with more than 60 Dao Masters? How many Dao Masters can there be in the entire Eternal World?”

Innumerable figures retreated far from the imperial palace to watch the unprecedented war unfolding in the center of the palace.

Though they were far away, they could still feel the terrible fluctuations coming from the battlefield.

There were unprecedented astonishment and awe in their eyes.

Dao Master in the Eternal World was tantamount to overlords in other worlds.

They all possessed frightening power that was capable of destroying everything.

It was rare enough to find two Dao Masters battling in the Eternal World, never mind a war with more than 60 of them.

This was a war that could frighten heaven and move earth.

Meanwhile, over on the battlefield…

“Bitch, I’ll kill you today!” Emperor Xiao said coldly, his body filled with unprecedented killing intent.

“You’re not qualified to do so!” Emperor Leng was also filled with killing intent.

“Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!”

There were dozens of impacts between the two in an instant. Suddenly, the impact pushed Emperor Leng backward.

“Your strength hasn’t improved even after so many years.” Emperor Xiao sneered.

“Damn it!”?Emperor Leng was sullen. “If Jian Wushuang hasn’t cut off my arm, did you think you’d have an advantage over me?”

It was indeed unfortunate for Emperor Leng to have her arm cut off by Jian Wushuang.

Her ability to self-repair was amazing and under ordinary circumstances, her recovery would have been almost instantaneous. However, the Sword Essence from Sunrise Sword Emperor contained the Destruction Sword Principle. It was so powerful that it halted her recovery process.

Thus, Emperor Leng’s one arm remained missing.

She was disadvantaged with only one arm left, making her an easy target for Emperor Xiao.

In another battle…

“Xia Tao, show me how you’re going to keep me here forever.” Lord of Cercis Island’s voice was ethereal as if it came from far away.

“Humph! You’ll see it right away.” Following Xia Tao’s snort, a huge axe appeared in his hand. He found himself standing next to Lord of Cercis Island after taking a single step.

Since the beginning of the Selection Ceremony, Jian Wushuang’s Senior Brother, Xue Lingtian, had picked Xia Yu, the Great Elder of the Xia Clan, as his opponent.

Xia Yu’s strength was not as good as Xia Tao’s but he had also reached the level of Rank Three Dao Master. His strength was similar to Xue Lingtian’s. They had been at odds since the fight between Jian Wushuang and Xia Mang. With the outbreak of the war, they immediately targeted each other.

Both sides sent out six of their best Dao Masters to battle each other.

The remaining Dao Masters also found their respective opponents.

Jian Wushuang had been eyeing one person since the beginning of the war.

It was none other than Xia Mang.

Xia Mang had been hurt badly in the contest earlier, but his jade had saved his life.

Jian Wushuang didn’t believe that he would have another life-saving jade with him.

“Go to hell!”

The killing intent surged from Jian Wushuang’s eyes as he charged at his opponent.

“Jian Wushuang!”

Xia Mang was terrified when he saw Jian Wushuang rushing toward him.

He had mocked Jian Wushuang when Emperor Leng announced him to be Leng Rushuang’s husband but he knew very well that he was much weaker than Jian Wushuang.

He knew he was no match for Jian Wushuang in a one-on-one battle. The latter’s sword formation would just kill him outright.

Therefore he called another two Dao Masters next to him, saying, “Xia Qi, Elder Dong, let’s kill Jian Wushuang together.”

Xia Qi and Elder Dong joined Xia Mang without hesitation and rushed toward Jian Wushuang.

“Three Dao Masters?” Jian Wushuang’s expression shifted ever so slightly.

“Don’t worry. Xia Mang is the only one out of them who have reached the top of Rank One; the other two are just at the medium-level of Rank One. You’ll be able to fight them.” Gu King’s voice resounded inside him.

Being in a lower realm, Jian Wushuang could not see the specific strength of these Dao Masters.

But Gu King could see it.

“They’re all Rank One Dao Masters?” Jian Wushuang felt reassured. “Then let’s fight!”

The Blood Mountain Sword appeared in Jian Wushuang’s hand following a roar, carrying astonishing power. Next to him, the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation formed by 36 One-meter Swords let out strong power.

Jian Wushuang’s killing intent surged and in a flash, he clashed with the three Dao Masters.

“Scram.”

Jian Wushuang bellowed and the strong power of the Blood Mountain Sword skyrocketed. Boosted by the forces of the 24 levels of the Secret Skills, which was 72 times stronger, he swung his sword. However, before using the sword, Jian Wushuang had also sent out an unearthly energy.

That energy was from the Mind-controlling Secret Skill, one of the three Secret Skills of the Ancient God Clan.

The Mind-controlling Secret Skill was used to attack a person’s consciousness. After Jian Wushuang reached the Eternal Realm and his strength skyrocketed, the power of this skill improved too. Furthermore, his consciousness was also much stronger than typical Dao Masters.

In addition, the Divergent Blood Stone had also increased the power of this skill.

The attack almost hit the three Dao Masters at the same time. They were all impacted to a certain extent. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Thus, when Jian Wushuang’s sword arrived, the three Dao Masters could barely put up a resistance.

“Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The three figures were forced backward nearly at the same time, but just as they were retreating…

“Whoosh!”

Sharp, harsh wind-breaking sounds and fitful explosion noises filled the Void. The Ninth-heaven Sword Formation transformed into numerous meteors that aimed for Elder Dong at an amazing speed.

Elder Dong was subsequently beheaded with his eyes were still wide open as if he could not believe what had just happened.

The three of them, three Dao Masters, had teamed up to fight a solo Jian Wushuang.

However, Jian Wushuang ended up killing killed one of them with just one move.
