Chapter 2590: Zhong Hun

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Boom!

A terrifying soul attack penetrated Jian Wushuang’s soul like an awl.

Jian Wushuang’s soul was surrounded by a small transparent tower.

The small tower was the Exquisite Pagoda.

As one of the Seven Stars Black Sect’s five secret techniques, the Exquisite Pagoda was great at defending against soul attacks. In addition, Jian Wushuang had also managed to cultivate the Exquisite Pagoda secret technique’s second level, hence its power was naturally even greater.

The awl-like soul attack that frontally bombarded the Exquisite Pagoda made the transparent Exquisite Pagoda shake violently for a while before quickly stopping.

On the outside, Jian Wushuang’s figure was only slightly shaken before he calmed down almost instantly.

Jian Wushuang turned around and looked at a void next to him. He sensed the tyrannical soul attack was coming from that direction.

A High-level Ultimate God who lacked a good soul attack defense method would be unable to resist such a horrifying soul attack. The person who performed the soul attack was undoubtedly the Demon.

A cold-looking thin old man who was dressed in a black robe slowly appeared in Jian Wushuang’s line of sight as expected.

“Hehe, I must say the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord is quite capable for you to survive the sudden soul attack just now.” The cold-looking old man smiled strangely.

“Your soul power attack is extremely powerful. If I’m not mistaken, your main soul power has reached the limits of a High-level Earth Ultimate God or even the Peak Earth Ultimate God level. My Northern Darkstar Territory is just a small Stellar Region with no one as powerful as you in soul attacks. Who are you?” Jian Wushuang asked coldly.

“I’m Zhong Hun! You don’t have to know who I am and where I’m from.” The cold-looking old man smiled evilly and stared at Jian Wushuang. “Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord, you shouldn’t have come in fact. My original intention is to absorb some cultivators’ soul power to restore my strength. I’ll leave as soon as my strength is restored. I’ve no interest in your small and ordinary Northern Darkstar Territory.

“If you have turned a blind eye on this, you’ll at most lose some Official Army soldiers which won’t be too serious. Why do you have to come and dig your own grave now?”

“Dig my own grave? I don’t think so,” chided Jian Wushuang coldly.

“Hehe, you don’t think so? You’ll know it soon.” The evil spirited Zhong Hun had a faint trace of cold fire burning in his eyes. He flipped his palm and a black spear appeared in his hand.

The black spear exuded an incomparably evil and very terrifying cold aura. It was a genuine Heavenly Treasure.

As Zhong Hun’s figure moved, his phantom-like figure floated and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang in the blink of an eye. The spear in his hand drew out a layer of black power before forming a black whirlpool in the void’s edge which went straight toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang could feel an extremely amazing power coming from the spear.

The power was even stronger than when San Shouwang exhausted his strength.

“Not only is his soul attacks extremely good, but his weapon offenses aren’t weak either.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed slightly and immediately withdrew the Blood Mountain Sword behind him.

Clang!

A tyrannical force exploded when the sword-light clashed with the black spear frontally and caused the black whirlpool around the black spear to disappear immediately before the spear sank downward.

A terrifying soul attack attacked Jian Wushuang fiercely once again upon the two weapons collision.

The impact was much stronger than his previous soul attack.

The Exquisite Pagoda shook violently in Jian Wushuang’s sea of consciousness.

“Hehe, is it uncomfortable?” Zhong Hun smiled ominously.

“Hmph!” Jian Wushuang snorted coldly as the sword-light in his hand was divided into three and instantly shot out.

Zhong Hun was unafraid. Although he was best at soul attacks, his weapon offenses and face-to-face combat ability were not weak either.

Even though his strength had yet to recover to its peak, his face-to-face combat abilities were top among the High-level Earth Ultimate God.

Zhong Hun fought head-on with Jian Wushuang with his black spear constantly colliding with the Blood Mountain Sword as the two were equally matched. During the heated fight, Zhong Hun’s spear along with his terrifying soul attack repeatedly bombarded Jian Wushuang. The Exquisite Pagoda in Jian Wushuang’s sea of consciousness continued to endure the repeated soul attacks.

The incessant soul attacks caused the Exquisite Pagoda to shake violently but there were still no signs of damage. Jian Wushuang’s soul did not suffer any substantial damage.

That was the Exquisite Pagoda’s power!

The powerful soul defensive ability completely blocked Zhong Hun’s soul attacks.

Zhong Hun was quite casual at first as he fought Jian Wushuang without much effort. However, he noticed Jian Wushuang kept a straight face which made his eyes slightly sink as they repeatedly fought head-on.

“My soul power has been restored to the level of Peak Earth Ultimate God not to mention I’m using my full strength in the soul attacks. Even if the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord’s soul power has reached the level of a Peak Earth Ultimate God, it shouldn’t still be as good after so many attacks. How come there doesn’t seem to be any damage at all? Perhaps he has a soul defensive treasure on his body or practiced some sort of soul defensive secret technique?” Zhong Hun murmured.

Suddenly, his face turned extremely cold.

Buzz... A majestic soul power erupted.

The soul power was not only huge and vast but also formed a tangible substance that enshrouded the world. In an instant, it had completely covered the surrounding void and Jian Wushuang before forming a huge Soul World.

“This is...Soul World?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Cultivators who had practiced sword principle, saber principle, and other principles could form a Principle World after reaching a certain level of enlightenment.

A cultivator who was good at soul attacks and purely studied the soul principle could also build his Soul World.

The Soul World’s power was not weaker than a Principle World but seemed a little strange and weird.

Zhong Hun displayed a complete Soul World.

Jian Wushuang kept a straight face and he also displayed a huge Sword World.

“Sword World?”

Zhong Hun looked at the crazy sword intent and sneered coldly. “It’s useless. You’re just an Earth Ultimate God no matter what and your understanding of principles can’t be that high either with your Sword World probably reached the level of merit. How can you compete with my Soul World at the Profound Achievement? Break for me!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Zhong Hun controlled his vast Soul World and madly crashed it on Jian Wushuang’s Sword World.
