Chapter 700: Child

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“The fifth level of Occult.”

Standing on a treetop, Jian Wushuang clenched his fists, a radiance shining in his eyes.

Having comprehended the fifth level of Occult of the World Dao, his strength had reached a whole new level.

Right at this moment…

Swish!

A violent sound was suddenly heard from the forest ahead.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang immediately raised his head and looked toward the forest ahead.

From the forest ahead suddenly appeared a huge monster. Its giant soles trampled on the trunk of a towering old tree and thrust forcibly, causing the trunk to snap. Within a few strides, it appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Is this… a Demon God?”

Jian Wushuang gazed at the figure that had just popped up in front of him.

More than three meters in height, its body was covered with bronze-colored skin and emitted an incomparably thick and overbearing aura.

“So this is a Demon God? I feel that, aside from its size and skin, it’s not that much different from humans.”

Frowning slightly, he was a little cautious, and his palm subconsciously felt for the longsword behind his back.

Demon Gods were divided into Copper-armored Demon Gods, Silver-armored Demon Gods, and Gold-armored Demon Gods.

The one in front of him was evidently the lowest grade Copper-armored Demon God, but nevertheless, it was also extremely powerful.

Jian Wushuang had never fought with a Demon God and did not understand their battle strength, and so naturally did not dare to be careless in the slightest.

It stood in front of Jian Wushuang and stared at him with its arms crossed.

Suddenly, it began to gradually relax its crossing of arms. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The sight of this caused Jian Wushuang’s pupils to constrict slightly. He subconsciously believed that the Demon God was ready to attack.

But then…

“Child, why are you still here?” A sincere voice was uttered from the Demon God’s mouth.

Jian Wushuang winced and looked at the Demon God in surprise.

He was not shocked by the fact that the Demon God actually spoke, but rather by its attitude toward him.

“Child?”

“What sort of address is this?”

“Isn’t this usually what a senior would call a junior?”

Jian Wushuang also discovered that there was goodwill in the Demon God’s eyes as it spoke.

Yes, goodwill.

Every 100 years, human warriors from the Firmament Territory would invade the Eternal Zone and massacre these Demon Gods. The Demon God Clan had long abhorred the human invasions and would typically seek to kill any human they spotted.

But this time, the Copper-armored Demon God not only did not attack Jian Wushuang, but even addressed him as “child” in a friendly manner.

“What’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang furrowed his brows tightly.

“Child, I’m asking you a question!” Staring at Jian Wushuang, the Demon God continued, “A hundred years have passed, and humans from the outside world are coming. Didn’t your parents tell you that this place is no longer safe?”

Jian Wushuang felt even weirder deep down upon hearing this.

He understood from the Demon God’s words that it had obviously mistaken him for a clansman.

“How can he possibly mistake me for a clansman?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled. “Could it be because I’m only a Skyscraping Realm expert?”

According to Vice Palace Master Ling Yu, the Demon God clansmen were similar to humans before they underwent metamorphosis during the baptism process. And each time the Eternal Zone had opened in the past, the invading human warriors were at least of the Divine Realm, which meant that he was the first Skyscraping Realm expert to ever invade. There was hence a slim possibility that the Demon God had mistaken him for a clansman upon seeing that he was only a Skyscraping Realm expert.

But Jian Wushuang swiftly denied this possibility.

He had heard from Vice Palace Master Ling Yu that the Demon God clansmen had a special method to instantly identify their fellow clansmen.

This method was apparently based on the person’s aura or some other aspect. In any case, the Demon Gods typically only needed one look to identify humans.

Since this was what Vice Palace Master Ling Yu said, it was definitely true.

But… what was happening right now?

Although Jian Wushuang continued to be baffled, he opened his mouth and replied, “I got separated from my elders.”

“You got separated? No wonder.” The Copper-armored Demon God nodded slightly and laughed. “Your family members are too careless. This would usually not be a problem, but humans are coming and will be roaming these parts over the next couple of days. You’ll be sorry if they spot you.”

The Demon God approached Jian Wushuang as it spoke.

Jian Wushuang remained vigilant at heart as he observed each and every of the Demon God’s movements.

Conversely, the Demon God showed no precaution toward him. It walked up beside him and extended a palm toward him.

“I’m called Gu Qiong, and come from the Seventh Tribe. I’ve never seen you there before. As the only tribes in this region are the Seventh and the Eighth Tribe, I guess you should be a clansman of the Eighth, right?” The Demon God asked.

“Correct.” Jian Wushuang nodded profusely. “I’m called Jian Wushuang and am from the Eighth Tribe.”

“Jian Wushuang?” Gu Qiong frowned. “What an unusual name. It’s similar to that of humans from the outside world.”

Jian Wushuang felt a jolt in his heart.

Gu Qiong continued, “Jian Wushuang, you were lucky that you ran into me. Had it instead been those evil outsiders that you ran into, they would surely have killed you without mercy.”

Though he could not help laughing, Jian Wushuang felt even more confused.

“Alright then, follow me. This territory is too dangerous. Our clansmen are fighting against those outsiders as we speak. There’s no chance of survival for a child like you who hasn’t even undergone the Demon God baptism if you remain here. Follow me and I’ll bring you back to your tribe,” Gu Qiong said, laughing.

“Okay, thank you so much.” Jian Wushuang acknowledged.

“Follow me.” Gu Qiong began to head deep into the forest.

Jian Wushuang followed quietly behind at only a few meters’ distance.

“It has its back to me? How could it be this unguarded?” Jian Wushuang furrowed his brows.

He had imagined the scene of encountering these Demon Gods prior to entering the Eternal Zone.

He had felt somewhat disgusted when he found out that the experts from the various sects in the Firmament Territory would invade the home of the Demon Gods and kill them for their Essence Blood, and had even considered not killing these Demon Gods himself.

His verdict at that time was that he would not mind killing these Demon Gods if they were of an evil and cruel nature.

However, he never imagined that the first Demon God he encountered would mistake him for a clansman and be this friendly and unguarded toward him, such that it would even send him back to what it thought was his tribe.

“What exactly is going on?”

Jian Wushuang was in utter disbelief.
