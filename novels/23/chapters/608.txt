Chapter 609: Heaven-defying Four Steps

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Having not killed Su Ming, Jian Wushuang felt regret. Yet, except for Su Ming, the experts who had sought to kill the Sword Ancestor had all been killed. In the Ancient World, Jian Wushuang had no other enemies.

Jian Wushuang went back to the Monster Continent following Bone Dragon Emperor. They went back to the huge black castle where Emperor Xiao was living.

In the garden, Emperor Xiao was sitting on a stone stool, while Di Jing stood by his side respectfully.

“You have finished dealing with your affairs?” Emperor Xiao looked over at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes, I have finished. There was a little accident, but luckily Master Di Jing helped me out.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Aha, it was a small thing and I just drove a little kid of the Divine Realm away.” Di Jing smiled in a strange way.

“Divine Realm?” Jian Wushuang was stunned. Naturally, he knew that Di Jing was talking about Xue Yang from the Universal Thunder Sect. However, Jian Wushuang only knew that Xue Yang was a super expert far beyond the Skyscraping Realm, and he did not know his specific realm. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Now, Jian Wushuang knew that Xue Yang’s level was called the Divine Realm.

“The little guy of the Divine Realm was nothing, but the Universal Thunder Sect behind him in the Firmament Territory is indeed not a weak sect. There are several experts of the Eternal Realm. When you go to the Firmament Territory and deal with the Universal Thunder SEct, you have to be careful.” Di Jing said.

“Eternal Realm?” Jian Wushuang was more confused.

“Little guy, aren’t you yearning for the second gray stone bead? Now, I will give it to you. When you understand the realms after the Heavenly Creation Skill, you will naturally get to know the concept of the Divine Realm and the Eternal Realm.” Saying that, Emperor Xiao threw the second gray stone bead to Jian Wushuang.

As if it had its own consciousness, the gray stone bead immediately went into Jian Wushuang’s body as soon as it got near him.

As soon as the second gray stone bead entered his body, it began to crazily whirl. Then, a torrent of information directly entered Jian Wushuang’s mind.

This information was naturally the cultivation technique of the realms following the Heavenly Creation Skill.

“This, this is...”

Accepting the cultivation techniques of the several realms after the Heavenly Creation Skill, Jian Wushuang could not help but feel astonished.

The message said that there were two volumes of the Heavenly Creation Skill, with the first volume ending at Flying to the Ninth Heaven.

Flying to the Ninth Heaven meant that, the warrior should lay foundation step by step from entering the Martial Arts. When he reached the last level of the Cloud Realm, Jian Wushuang would feel perfect in all aspects. This was just laying the perfect foundation.

That was to say that, the purpose of the first volume of the Heavenly Creation Skill was only to lay?a perfect foundation, just like what Jian Wushuang had now.

After having the prefect foundation, Jian Wushuang would cultivate the Heavenly-defying Four Steps!

The Heaven-defying Four Steps were really the core and essence of the Heavenly Creation Skill.

The Heaven-defying Four Steps were Step One Heaven-treading Realm, Step Two Deification Realm, Step Three Everlasting Realm, and Step Four Eternal Supremo!

As for normal warriors, there were also four realms above the Cloud Realm, and those were respectively the Skyscraping Realm, the Divine Realm, the Eternal Realm, and the Dao Master Realm!

The Skyscraping Realm of normal warriors corresponded to the first step of the Heavenly Creation Skill, the Heaven-treading Realm!

Jian Wushuang was at the Nine-cloud Realm now. Hence, if he could break through, he would reach the Heaven-treading Realm.

“The first volume of the Heavenly Creation Skill was only for laying a perfect foundation? Then, the following Heaven-defying Four Steps would be the most important?” Jian Wushuang widened his eyes.

To him, the first volume of the Heavenly Creation Skill, which he had been cultivating, had several levels and was incomparably powerful. It could be described as overpowered.

But now, he knew that, the real essence and core of the Heavenly Creation Skill was its second volume, i.e. the Heaven-defying Four Steps!

As for the first volume, it was only for laying a perfect foundation to make him perfect in all aspects.

“It seems that I have looked down upon the Heavenly Creation Skill.” Jian Wushuang exclaimed secretly.

It was a Heaven defying cultivation method that utterly changed his destiny, and it was absolutely far beyond a normal warriors’ cultivation system.

Jian Wushuang did not know how magical it was and how much power it had on earth.

Yet, as long as Jian Wushuang had set out on the road of Inverse Cultivation, he would not be afraid. He would continue along it without any hesitation.

“I don’t know the differences between my Heaven-defying Four Steps and a normal warriors’ Four Realms.” Jian Wushuang was secretly musing.

But now he knew that he was still too weak. He had just broken through and reached the Nine-cloud Realm. It was not easy to make the first heaven-defying step.

“There are Four Realms in the Eternal World. Xue Yang was of the Divine Realm, but in the Universal Thunder Sect, there are several experts of the Eternal Realm.” Jian Wushuang thought.

“In the Four Realms of the Skyscraping Realm, the Divine Realm, the Eternal Realm, and the Dao Master Realm, the Skyscraping Realm is the most ordinary.” Emperor Xiao explained, “In the Eternal World, most of the ordinary disciples of the sects are of the Skyscraping Realm, and it is at the bottom in the Eternal World.”

“Take the Firmament Territory Feast as an example, although countless experts of the Ancient World would come, these experts had to reach the Skyscraping Realm at least to be qualified.”

“Divine Realm... In the sects of the Eternal Realm, someone at this level could obtain some prestige. Some Divine Realm experts with extreme strength could be the local tyrant in some isolated places in the Eternal World.”

“As for the Eternal Realm, it means eternal and everlasting life. Anyone reaching this level could be called experts even in the Eternal Realm. There are many sects in the Eternal World, and the most powerful is the Eternal Realm expert. Experts at this level will be valued highly no matter which sect they go.”

“As for the last Dao Master Realm...Dao Master is the peak expert in the Eternal World. They are the top beings, and the real overlords of the Eternal World!”

“Of course, the Four Realms are only normal warriors’ levels. You are cultivating the Heavenly Creation Skill. As an Inverse Cultivation, it has unlimited potential.”

Jian Wushuang quietly nodded. He was listening very carefully, and put everything that Emperor Xiao said into his mind.

At this time, Emperor Xiao looked over at him again. “There are three years before the commencement of the Firmament Territory Feast. In these three years, I’ll do my best to help you raise your strength, and let you have the chance to take the first heaven-defying step within three years.”

“At your level, if you want to raise your strength, there are only two ways, and the first way is raising your comprehension of Dao!”

“The second way is Secret Skills!”

Jian Wushuang was intrigued.

Needless to say, the comprehension of Dao was very important. As for the Skyscraping Realm experts, their?strength level was based on their comprehension of Dao.

Although he had not understood the Secret Skill before. Having fought against the Dark Emperor, Jian Wushuang was very clear about the overwhelming and terrifying power of the Secret Skill.
