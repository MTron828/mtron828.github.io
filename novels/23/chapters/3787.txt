Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“With your talent, you might be able to pass the test of the Second Heaven if you spend some time with these opportunities,” Lord Wu said.

Although Lord Wu said it casually, Jian Wushuang still felt immense pressure.

“No matter what, I must get the heart of the Astral World and the Principles Treasure,” Jian Wushuang said with a fierce look in his eyes.

“Little guy, let’s not talk about the Second Heaven test for now. You can choose any of the 36 secret skills,” Lord Wu said.

Jian Wushuang nodded and then began to explore the 36 secret skills.

The 36 secret skills were recorded in the 36 tokens, so Jian Wushuang could only explore them one by one.

The 36 secret skills were all powerful secret skills accumulated by the Red Cloud Branch. Any one of them was powerful enough to drive a fourth-level or even fifth-level Ruler crazy.

Jian Wushuang browsed through them and found that they were indeed very impressive.

Some secret skills were not much weaker than his supreme immortal celestial body.

There were a total of 36 secret skills of various kinds, including powerful offensive secret skills, domain or suppression secret skills, protective secret skills, and so on.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

After all, there were many secret skills that he could use.

For example, there was a unique sword principle secret skill among these secret skills. Although Jian Wushuang did not cultivate it, he knew from the information that it was enough to make his swordsmanship more powerful.

Unfortunately, the threshold of this sword principle secret skill was very high, and he had to spend a lot of money to condense a Natal Divine Sword. The Natal Divine Sword was not an ordinary Natal Divine Sword, it had to reach the level of a Principles Supreme Treasure.

Jian Wushuang did not have a Principles Supreme Treasure, so naturally, he could only be envious of this secret skill.

There was also an extremely powerful secret skill in the area of consciousness. This secret skill could not only greatly increase the strength of one’s consciousness, but it could also release a terrifying consciousness attack.

That consciousness attack could ignore the obstruction of the soul. It was the same as the Three-Eyed Demon Woman’s consciousness attack on the peak of Heaven-Treading Mountain.

Jian Wushuang had experienced the Three-Eyed Demon Woman’s consciousness attack. Not only was it extremely powerful, but it was also unstoppable.

Of course, Jian Wushuang also yearned for such a secret skill.

If he suddenly used this consciousness attack while fighting with an expert, the other party would not be able to detect it in time and might be hit.

However, although this consciousness secret skill was good, the minimum cultivation threshold was the Ruler level. Moreover, it was not an ordinary Ruler. At the very least, it had to be at least a second-level Ruler.

He was still far from being a first-level Ruler, let alone a second-level one. Of course, he could not cultivate this secret skill of consciousness.

“These secret skills are worthy of the long accumulation of the Red Cloud bloodline. Any one of them is very impressive. However, the requirement to cultivate these secret skills is too high. Although I have 36 secret skills, there are only a few that I can cultivate now. I can’t cultivate any of the secret skills that I like that are of great use to me.” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Little guy, you’re worried. You don’t know which secret skill to choose, do you?” Lord Wu looked at him.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “Among the 36 secret skills, I can only cultivate about 10 at most. However, I don’t really desire these 10 secret skills. I don’t know which one to choose.”

“Haha, I can’t help it. You’re just a Principles Master and your realm is too low. If you’ve reached the Ruler level, even if you’re a first-level Ruler, you’ll be able to cultivate many more secret skills.” Lord Wu laughed, suddenly, his expression changed. “Little guy, if you can’t make up your mind, how about I recommend one to you?”

“Hmm?” Jian Wushuang looked at Lord Wu immediately. “Lord Wu, which secret skill do you think I should cultivate now?”

“Take a look at this one.” Lord Wu waved his hand, and one of the 36 tokens appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang immediately checked the secret skill information in the token.

“Secret skill, dragon extermination, divine power burning secret skill!”

Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted.

As the name implied, the divine power burning secret skill was a secret skill that burned one’s own divine power by force, greatly increasing the consumption of one’s own divine power, so that one’s strength could reach a new level in a short period of time.

Jian Wushuang had briefly seen this secret skill before, but he did not pay much attention to it.

After all, each of the 36 secret skills was very impressive, and most of them were used to directly improve one’s strength or various means. As for this divine power burning secret skill…it required a large amount of divine power as a price to be used. Compared to other secret skills that were used directly, this divine power burning secret skill was obviously inferior.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang did not really care about this secret skill. He did not expect that Lord Wu would recommend this secret skill to him.

“Lord Wu, is this dragon-killing secret skill very powerful?” Jian Wushuang looked at Lord Wu.

“Of course it’s powerful.” Lord Wu smiled. “Little guy, you haven’t really explored the vast universe, so you don’t know much. In the vast universe, the divine power burning secret skill is relatively rare. At least it’s much rarer than other offensive or protective secret skills.”

“And godly power burning technique needs a huge amount of godly power as the foundation, and the consumption of godly power is too huge. Usually, a cultivator’s godly power will be completely exhausted not long after he uses the godly power burning technique. Therefore, almost all the cultivators in the universe use the godly power burning technique as their trump card. It’s the kind of technique that can only be used to fight for their lives.”

“However, it is undeniable that the divine power burning secret skill is very powerful. For example, a master of the first level, once he uses the divine power burning secret skill, his strength will increase by a hundredfold. In a short period of time, he will have the battle strength of a Master of the second level. Even a master of the fourth level, after using the divine power burning secret skill, will be able to barely reach the threshold of a master of the fifth level.”

“The burning of divine power can indeed reach this stage.” Jian Wushuang was not surprised.

“If it were anyone else, I would not recommend the dragon-killing secret skill, but you are different.” Lord Wu looked at Jian Wushuang calmly. “Little guy, you are a perfect life-level cultivator. Your divine power is hundreds or even thousands of times more powerful than that of other cultivators of the same level. In other words, if an ordinary Principles Master can only maintain the burning of divine power for one breath, you can maintain it for hundreds or even thousands of breaths.”
