Chapter 2386: Kill Them All

The Second-Class Divine Demon, who held a large hammer, immediately counter-attacked with a backhand.

Seeing the hammer almost hitting the sword shadow, the Second-Class Divine Demon’s expression suddenly froze.

“How is that possible? I clearly blocked him!”

With a face full of puzzlement, his eyes grew dimmer.

A Second-Class Divine Demon was killed with one strike as well!

“Continue!”

Jian Wushuang smiled plainly and continued attacking the Mu Clan experts around him.

His frightening swords skills and speed were in full bloom.

“No!”

“Watch out!”

“Watch his sword!”

The Mu Clan experts all looked fearful, even for Second-Class Divine Demons.

Jian Wushuang’s sword skills were too terrifying.

The white-haired old man who was standing nearby could no longer stay still.

“Stop, kid!”

He roared as his energy expanded and white hair was blown mid-air.

The white-haired old man was also a Second-Class Divine Demon, but the energy projected from his body was more powerful than the rest. He was probably at the Peak of Second-Class Divine Demon, only a short step away from First-Class Divine Demon.

Under the explosion of his energy, he dashed at Jian Wushuang like a giant prehistoric creature.

“This guy’s pretty strong.”

Jian Wushuang took one glance at the white-haired old man. A surging divine power started to concentrate behind his body in the next moment.

In the blink of an eye, a 300-meter Divine God’s shadow formed out of thin air.

The first of Seven Star Black Sect’s Five Secret Skills, Divine God of Punishment had been displayed.

The Seven Star Secret Skill Divine God of Punishment had been fully activated and Jian Wushuang attacked using his maximum strength.

“Die, kid!”

Like an infuriated lion, the white-haired old man looked absolutely ferocious with his pair of fiery red fighting gloves appearing as if his hands were burning.

“I’m afraid you would be the one to die.” Jian Wushuang sneered and with a few dashes, suddenly appeared in front of the old man.

They immediately made their moves at the same time.

Jian Wushuang was holding the Blood Mountain Sword engulfed in Formless Sword Intent while using the Xuan Luo Sword Principle.

The white-haired old man was extremely vicious with his pair of huge fists smashing down.

Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!

Continuous collision sounds bursting out with divine power sweeping outwards with every hit.

Both of them had used their maximum strength.

In the blink of an eye, they had already clashed head-to-head more than ten times.

Finally...there was a snapping noise. Unable to withstand the impacts, the white-haired old man’s fiery red fighting gloves exploded after clashing with Blood Mountain Sword over and over again.

“What?!” The old man was stunned.

However, Jian Wushuang did not give him any room to breathe.

A blurry sword shadow swept outwards, forming ripples within the void wherever it passed by.

The whole environment froze.

The white-haired old man seemed lost, while the blurry sword shadow had already sliced through his throat.

A large head flew off.

“F-first-Class Divine Demon strength?”

The white-haired old man still could not believe it before he died.

It was true that a few months before when he was in Anjiu Commandery, Jian Wushuang was still merely at the Early Stage Chaotic Realm. However, when he gave his all, his battle strength had already reached the level of Second-Class Divine Demon and even the top among its kind.

At that time, he confronted Xiang Yi and Qian Yuan, two powerful Second-Class Divine Demon, and came to a tie. He even had a slight advantage.

Now that a few months had passed, he had been promoted from Early Stage to Middle Stage Chaotic Realm. His law insights and understanding of the sword had also improved a bit.

His battle strength was much stronger than before.

He truly possessed the battle strength of a First-Class Divine Demon.

Hence, he was able to slaughter those Third-Class Divine Demons and killed a Second-Class Divine Demon with one strike using his own sword form.

Even when fighting the white-haired old man, as soon as they fought head-to-head, Jian Wushuang could still cut him down with his sword form.

When the old man died, the rest of the Mu Clan experts were shaken to the core.

“Run!”

“Let’s get out of here!!!”

“Even Elder Mu Qiu was so easily killed by him and looks like none of us are capable of confronting him. Let’s run!”

The experts from Mu Clan started to disperse in a frenzy.

However, although they wanted to escape, Jian Wushuang did not let them.

“All of these people should just die!” Jian Wushuang’s intention to kill was surging.

He had not much enmity towards Mu Clan, hence from a personal standpoint, there was no need to kill all the Mu Clan experts.

However, the situation did not allow him to have mercy because Miss Xiao wanted these Mu Clan men to die.

Swoop!

Jian Wushuang’s insight on Space-Time Law had completely exploded. Space-Time Shadows kept flashing in the void as his speed had gone up to an extreme as well.

Xiao Heng and the four core disciples from Narcissus Island were at a lost standing there. They could see Jian Wushuang’s figure in the void flashing, shifting, and appearing nonstop. Every time he appeared, he was at a different place followed by his sword striking down.

Every strike guaranteed the death of a Mu Clan expert.

There were two Second-Class and eight Third-Class Divine Demons from Mu Clan left.

However, they were no different from ants in Jian Wushuang’s hands.

After a stream of continuous flashes, within two breaths’ time, Jian Wushuang finally stopped.

At that moment, what Xiao Heng and the rest could see were corpses all over the ground with blood splattered everywhere. Mu Clan’s experts had all turned into lifeless bodies, laying on the ground, while Jian Wushuang was standing tall without a scratch.

“Dead!”

“Mu Clan’s experts are all dead!”

Xiao Heng and the core disciples exclaimed before become completely speechless.

Their eyes were locked on Jian Wushuang with an indescribable shock in it.

It was like looking at Death himself, who slaughtered Second-Class and Third-Class Divine Demons like farm animals. They wondered if he was really the same person who came to carry out the mission with them. The one that they did not particularly care for and was merely an outer disciple on Narcissus Island—Jian Wushuang? FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Was he really only at Chaotic Realm?

“J-Jian Wushuang...”

Xiao Heng trembled. He wanted to say something but paused when the words were on the tip of his tongue.

He simply did not know what he should be saying.

However, Jian Wushuang did not pay attention to him either. After slaughtering the Mu Clan experts, he shifted his figure and went back to Miss Xiao.

“Miss Xiao, I’m wondering if you’re satisfied with the sight before you?” Jian Wushuang smiles.

“Not too shabby.” Miss Xiao nodded slightly while looking at Jian Wushuang strangely.

“I’ve cleaned up those people from Mu Clan, but I can’t do anything about the few left,” said Jian Wushuang.
