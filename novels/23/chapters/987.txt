Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Under the eves of the great hall in the palace, the Tang Emperor was deep in discussion with Emperor Xiao and Emperor Yun on grave matters of state. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Jian Wushuang walked straight into the hall.

Noticing his arrival, the Tang Emperor and the rest of the other people present looked at him strangely.

“Seniors Tang Emperor, Emperor Xiao, and Emperor Yun.” Jian Wushuang greeted them.

“Jian Wushuang…” Tang Emperor began to speak with a pained expression, but his voice trailed off as he knew not of what to say.

“I have been told everything. I don’t blame you, and I know what should I be doing next.” Jian Wushuang said gravely.

He did not blame the Tang Emperor and others for keeping the truth about Leng Rushuang from him, knowing full well that they had been trying to spare him the agony of grief.

Hearing his words, the brows of the Tang Emperor rose with a jot of admiration towards Jian Wushuang, liking him even more.

“And here I was, thinking that the young fledgling will be thrown into a fit of madness or despair. It seems that my concern is misplaced… He is more mature and wise beyond my expectations…”?The Tang Emperor thought quietly. He waved his hands and a token appeared in his hand.

“I have left a mark in Shuang’er when she passed. This token allows one to perceive the existence of the mark if it is close by. But the token has lost its hold of the mark for now, since she had left this world and had gone far from us.”

Jian Wushuang received the token and clasped tightly it in his hand. “My deepest thanks, Senior.”

“I am afraid that is all that I can do.” The Tang Emperor muttered with exasperation.

Jian Wushuang nodded gently and turned to Emperor Xiao.

“I have something that requires your counsel, Senior Xiao.” Jian Wushuang said solemnly, “It’s about my father.”

“Your father?” Emperor Xiao first looked surprised as he then nodded slightly. “Very well. I do know about your father’s whereabouts, but it’s a long story. Sit down. I’ll tell you everything.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and found a place, sitting down immediately.

“Surely you know that this Eternal World we reside in, is but only one of the many domains of the entire Eternal Chaotic World?” Emperor Xiao asked.

“I know that.” Jian Wushuang answered.

“But you may not know that they are actually two continents in this world.” Emperor Xiao revealed suddenly.

“What?”Jian Wushuang was taken aback by the sudden revelation. “Two continents?”

“Yes, this is the Green Fire World; a domain which is made up of two continents: the Void Continent and the Samsara Continent.” Emperor Xiao explained.

“Although the two continents are of the same domain, the continents are not directly connected. One can only travel between the two continents through an anomalous spatial wormhole.”

“The continent we now reside in is the Void Continent!”

Gripped by shock and surprise, Jian Wushuang had not heard of such tales before.

It was only on this day that he finally knew that the Green Fire World was made up of two continents.

“The Void Continent is actually named after the Void Temple which reigned supreme across this lands. I assume you are familiar with the geography of the continent. But the Samsara Continent is hardly the same.” Emperor Xiao continued.

“Twice as large as the Void Continent, the Samsara Continent has more warriors learned in the skills of combat and martial techniques, their number overshadows us many times over. Moreover, the civilizations of the Samsara Continent are not divided by various factions or sovereign boundaries, having only one exclusive kind!”

“One exclusive kind?” Jian Wushuang asked in surprise.

“These people bear the lineage of an ancient bloodline; a bloodline which is very strange and unusual, just like yours,” said Emperor Xiao.

“Young one.” The Tang Emperor craned down at him. “I believe the bloodline of the fabled Ancient God Clan runs in your veins; one which is especially high atop their hierarchy. And yet I know, there is one such tribe amongst the many different clans and lineages of the Samsara Continent which could be closely related to the Ancient God Clan.”

“Oh?” This piqued Jian Wushuang’s interest as he asked, “Do you have the name of the tribe?”

“Nay… I have only once heard the mention of this matter in the Green Fire Palace. I had not asked about it and hence I know naught of their name.” The Gu King shook his head and smiled.

Jian Wushuang could only frown with disappointment.

He had surmised that it was through his mother that he had received the bloodline of the Ancient God Clan. Hence, the tribe could also be related to his mother, since they might be sharing a common origin with the Ancient God Clan.

“Pray continue, Senior.” Jian Wushuang said.

Emperor Xiao paused briefly before he spoke again. “Despite the existence of many tribes and races in the Samsara Continent, the lands have been ravaged by their constant strife and conflict fueled by the difference in strength and power. Then again, only one faction reigned supreme across the planes of the Samsara Continent: the Samsara Temple!”

“The Samsara Temple of the Samsara Continent enjoyed a similar dominance to that of the Void Temple here, remaining feared and respected by all while they kept themselves from the struggles and clashes of the land. None in the Samsara Continent dare challenge the authority and power of the Samsara Temple.”

“The Samsara Temple?” Jian Wushuang repeated, his brows rising curiously.

It was hardly a secret that the great Void Temple commanded absolute dominance across the Void Continent, shying away from the squabbles and skirmishes of the various factions of the land.

But the Samsara Temple was their equivalent upon the Samsara Continent?

Two powerful factions that were almost mirror images of each other?

“The Samsara Temple shares a lot of common ground with the Void Temple. But the Void Temple is less stringent in its restrictions and selections of prospective members. The Void Temple Master ordinarily selects the greatest warriors of the Void Continent directly, just like how the former Temple Master had once invited you to join them.” Emperor Xiao said.

Jian Wushuang nodded lightly in agreement.

He knew that his Senior Brother had first achieved the title of Dao Master before being offered a place as a master of the Void Temple.

“But the Samsara Temple functions differently, for most of their own warriors are trained and nurtured by the Samsara Temple themselves.” Emperor Xiao continued, “and they are most commonly known as the Reincarnators!”

“The Reincarnators are divided into nine different castes, each commanding varying authority and strength.”

“Everyone of them hailed from different origins.”

“Some are prodigies in the skills of combat native to the Samsara Continent, while there are also others recruited from the Void Continent. Yet, most of them are from the innumerable strata of the domain of the Ancient World.”

“The Ancient World?” Jian Wushuang felt another jolt of surprise.

“In short, the Samsara Temple will offer you a place amongst them if you display a certain level of talent and potential, promising you great benefits and resources. Then again, the risks are proportionate. Reincarnators have to endure deadly perils in order to enjoy the limitless resources and rewards!”
