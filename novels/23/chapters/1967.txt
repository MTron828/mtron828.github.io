Just as all experts from various forces in Eternal Chaotic World were shaken by the news about Green Fire World.

On the ancient battlefield, in an underground ruin not too far away from Green Fire World.

In the underground ruin, there was an underground palace.

The underground palace was huge and the interior was mysterious and unfathomable.

An elder in a gold robe shuttled through the underground palace. The elder was an ordinary Sir God from Emperor Sword Sect.

He had found the existence of underground palace by sheer luck. After he found it, he had immediately started to explore to find the opportunities within.

However, over the path, he didn’t see any opportunity at all until he reached the depths of the underground palace.

“Huh?”

The elder in the gold robe was surprised. He saw that there was a figure seated on the empty land in front of him.

“No wonder there isn’t an opportunity. It turns out that someone found the underground palace before I did,” the elder in the gold robe glanced at the figure on the empty land with envy in his eyes.

There were opportunities on the ancient battleground. But as there were more people started to wander around, it was normal that many of the opportunities were taken.

The elder in the gold robe flashed a bitter smile then he turned to leave.

But suddenly... The figure that was seated on the empty land suddenly opened her eyes.

Her pair of eyes were extremely brilliant, just like gemstones. At the same time, she slowly stood up.

Her face was beautiful and her body was enchanting. She was in a tight red robe which appeared to be extremely captivating.

No doubt, she was a beautiful woman, a beautiful woman by which any man would be captivated and tempted.

However, as the enchanting woman in the red robe stood up, there was a terrifying aura.

The terrifying aura covered the elder in the gold robe.

The elder in the gold robe was a Sir God. However, under such an aura, he revealed an unprecedentedly horrified expression and he was shivering in fear.

The elder in the gold robe took a deep breath and he bowed politely, “I am Jian Luo from Emperor Sword Sect.

“Emperor Sword Sect?” The enchanting woman in the red robe was surprised but she never spoke. However, she took a huge stride as she walked to the elder in the gold robe.

As she walked over, the brilliance in the enchanting woman’s eyes became stronger.

“I’ll ask you some questions. Answer me honestly,” the enchanting woman in the red robe finally walked next to the elder in the gold robe.

“Yes,” the elder in the gold robe had an absent look. No one could tell if he was in phantasmagoria or in a special state.

In a short while, the enchanting woman in the red robe found out about things that she’d like to know from the elder in the gold robe.

“The ancient battlefield was found by the cultivators from this era?”

The enchanting woman in the red robe squinted her eyes, “As the ancient battlefield is found, Green Fire World was definitely found as well. I wonder how Jian Wushuang is going to deal with it?”

With a playful smile, the enchanting woman in the red robe moved and flew towards Green Fire World.

Not long after she had left, the elder in the gold robe came back to reality.

“What happened?”

“What happened to me earlier?”

“Where’s the mister just now?”

The elder in the gold robe looked lost and he had no idea what had happened earlier.

...

Outside Green Fire World, Great Emperor Colored Glaze, Abysmal Saint Master and Great Emperor Zi Xu, the three Great Emperors had arrived.

Looking at the big world in front of them, Abysmal Saint Master and Great Emperor Zi Xu couldn’t help but sigh.

Jian Wushuang in Green Fire World had naturally noticed the three Great Emperors.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were two loud air-piercing sounds. Jian Wushuang and Jian Yi came out from Green Fire World and came before the three Great Emperors.

“Jian Wushuang, I said earlier that I would return in no time,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze looked cold as she glared at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang only glanced at Great Emperor Colored Glaze but didn’t bother talking to her at all.

As for Abysmal Saint Master... He had originally shared great resentment with Abysmal Saint Master. During the war in Lineage of Star back then, Abysmal Saint Master had been determined to kill him. Fortunately, Emperor Thirteen had taken action. Otherwise, most likely, he would have died back then. It was normal that Abysmal Saint Master came to look for him again.

Then, Jian Wushuang’s gaze was fixed upon the last Great Emperor, Great Emperor Zi Xu.

He also knew that Great Emperor Colored Glaze would get some help. It was within his expectations that he would invite one or two other Great Emperors but he had never guessed that she would invite Great Emperor Zi Xu.

Jian Wushuang knew about Great Emperor Zi Xu. He was a cold man.

As long as the others didn’t find trouble in him, he hardly took action against anyone. He was considered mild-tempered.

Although he had never met Great Emperor Zi Xu before, they were connected.

Back then, Jian Wushuang wanted to carry out his promise with Real God Wu Bei and kill King Demon Heart. King Demon Heart had once sent a message to Great Emperor Zi Xu to ask for help. But then, Great Emperor Zi Xu hadn’t appeared or stopped Jian Wushuang. It could be considered a favor to Jian Wushuang.

But then...

“Great Emperor Zi Xu, can you do me a favor again? I would be extremely grateful,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Sword Emperor, I’m sorry. Green Fire World has associated greatly with everything else. So...” Great Emperor Zi Xu had yet to finish his sentence.

“Hehe, Jian Wushuang, don’t have any unrealistic thoughts. I advise you to hand over Green Fire World directly. Then, we won’t attack,” Abysmal Saint Master said coldly.

Jian Wushuang stole a glance at Abysmal Saint Master, then scoffed, “I thought who was it. It is Abysmal Saint Master. Why? Have you recovered completely?”

Abysmal Saint Master’s face stunned.

Twelve thousand years ago, in the war in Lineage of Star, he had been at the brink of death because of Emperor Thirteen. The reason why Emperor Thirteen hadn’t killed him was merely that he wasn’t powerful enough to.

That was absolutely humiliating to Abysmal Saint Master.

“Humph, you were nearly killed by Emperor Thirteen back in Lineage of Star. Now, you have the guts to come here again. Abysmal Saint Master, you really have guts. Aren’t you worried that Emperor Thirteen will take action against you again?” Jian Wushuang humphed coldly. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Abysmal Saint Master quivered then he clenched his teeth and said, “Jian Wushuang, don’t think bringing up Emperor Thirteen can scare me. Back then when we were in Lineage of Star, I could tell that although Emperor Thirteen saved you, I reckon you don’t even know why he would do that yourself. In other words, you and he aren’t that close. It is because of a certain reason he didn’t wish for you to die, that’s why he saved you.”

“In order words, as long as I don’t kill you, Emperor Thirteen won’t reveal himself.”

“I only want Green Fire World. As for if you are going to die, it doesn’t matter. As long as I don’t kill you.”
