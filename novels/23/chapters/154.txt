Chapter 155: Battle!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Run!”

A large number of Warriors were crazily escaping in all directions at this moment, chased by the horrible Destructive Storm that was mercilessly rushing towards them.

Shaking heaven and earth!

They did not notice the two figures that were fiercely fighting in the center of the platform until the Destructive Storm calmed.

“It’s them!”

“One is Xue Yun; the other one is... Jian Wushuang.”

“It’s them!”

“The storm was created by them!”

At that moment, nearly 100,000 Warriors were gathered in the field, looking towards the center in terror.

The sword shadow and the black light were still in contact, and a terrifying Spiritual Power was constantly being released, spurting sparks occasionally.

“Not bad,” Xue Yun said, revealing an evil smile and retreating in an instant.

“You want to escape? Not that easy!” Jian Wushuang said coldly. The moment when Xue Yun retreated, Jian Wushuang thrust toward him with his Triple-kill Sword.

Instantly releasing Fiery Wind Sword Essence.

The Eighth Move of the Formless Sword Art!

With the help of Gale, the sword light glided through the air like a fiery dragon, appearing in front of Xue Yun in a flash.

With a calm look, Xue Yun used his blood-red blade to ward off the attack, instantly covering the area in darkness.

Clang!

With another fierce strike, the area began twisting due to failure to bear the strength. A strong gale rushed out, blowing away all the debris in the area. There was a horrid sound of thunder and the ground trembled.

The constant gale and the horrible roar released by the terrifying blast shocked most of the Warriors in the area.

At that moment...

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Two figures appeared next to Xue Yun at the same time, one left and one right.

They were Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou. They joined the fight with no hesitation.

A saber split through the air, and glided directly towards Xue Yun.

At the same time, Su Rou waved her long sword. A vast Sword Essence of Waterdrop was released, and the spiritual power rushed towards Xue Yun’s head.

“Huh?” Xue Yun’s face turned dark. Swaying his body, he suddenly disappeared from the area.

When he reappeared, he was in the center of the platform.

However, as soon as he appeared there...

“Hum!”

A cold hum sound blew into Xue Yun’s ear. Following the sound, a sword shadow which was cold and formidably powerful was fiercely moving towards him.

With his pupils contracting, Xue Yun had to retreat again.

Crack!

The cold sword shadow glided directly over the several meters tall platform. In an instant, the platform was split into two pieces.

Shock!

The entire crowd was shocked.

Seeing the two halves of the platform, many warriors could not help taking a deep breath.

“You guys, what are you doing?” with a roar, a bunch of Golden-armored Sergeants approached Jian and Xue.

Needless to say, these Golden-armored Sergent were the Royal Guards who were in charge of the maintaining order here. They appeared in the center and stopped Jian Wushuang and Xue Yun.

Although the Royal Guards appeared, they actually felt quite helpless.

Normally, they would instantly suppress any battles when people messed around and made so much trouble, regardless of whether they were ordinary warriors or experts on Earthly Dragon List. However, this time they were...

My god, are they really only in the Gold Core Realm?

Judging by the horrendous noise just now, they would not be weaker than some top experts in the Yin-Yang Void Realm.

They were not people who could be easily suppressed by the Royal Guards, who were only in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm.

A random blade flash or sword essence from either of them was powerful enough to kill a whole group of them.

“Both of them are ranked in the top ten on the Earthly Dragon List. One is obviously not just ranked 10th according to his true strength, and the other one is the indisputable 1st on the Earthly Dragon List. What are they fighting for?”?the sergeants were roaring in their hearts.

At the same time, a large number of the surrounding warriors were scared as well.

“Powerful!”

“They are too powerful. We are also experts on the Earthly Dragon List, but the strength disparity between them and us is too great!”

“Too powerful, too terrifying!”

“It’s not a big deal for Xue Yun. After all, he is recognized as the strongest on the Earthly Dragon List, so his strength was never doubted. But why is Jian Wushuang’s strength so powerful as well?”

Those warriors all felt it was inconceivable.

Especially since many of them were still questioning why Jian Wushuang was ranked 10th just minutes ago.

They believed that he was not qualified to hold that rank.

But now?

Even though the fight with Xue Yun ended quickly, the strength Jian Wushuang released was powerful enough to shock the experts who ranked in top ten on the Earthly Dragon List.

“Jian Wushuang”?

“His strength is really powerful.”

A beautiful and smart girl was staring at Jian Wushuang with a stiffened face at that moment as well.

She was Mu Yingying, who ranked 4th on the Earthly Dragon List. After watching this short fight, she could not look down on Jian Wushuang’s strength at all.

“Xue Yun is a monster. I don’t even have the courage to fight with him. However, Jian Wushuang actually fought with him to that extent. Even though Xue Yun did not display his utmost strength, Jian Wushuang was already very powerful.”

A cold-faced man carrying a saber on his waist stood in the crowd, with his eyes sparkling slightly. He was the top genius of the Gladiator Arena, Feng Yutian, who was ranked 5th on the Earthly Dragon List.

“Big Brother,” Ouyang Haoyue said, looking toward his brother.

Frowning slightly, Ouyang Haotian said, “Jian Wushuang’s strength is indeed very good. I might only be a little bit stronger than him. But if we fight formally, I have confidence in defeating him.”

Other than the experts in the top ten ranks, Even those who ranked lower were discussing this as well.

“Too powerful, they are too strong!” Ling Feng’s body was shaking with his hand clenched.

The short fight between Jian Wushuang and Xue Yun completely scared him. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

However, he did not notice that Shui Hanxin and Jian Meng’er who stood beside him were completely baffled as well.

“Him, it’s him?” Shui Hanxin was looking at Jian Wushuang incredulously, the same as everyone else who was present at this moment.

She had met him before!

One of her disciples was defeated by him three years ago. She was very shocked and pissed at that time. She even threatened him, saying that she would cultivate her disciple vigorously in the next three years, and they would get revenge three years later.

However, three years had passed, she did not expect this...

“Jian Wushuang, he is Jian Wushuang!”

Jian Menger’s body was shaking as well. She looked at Jian Wushuang in shock and panic.

“Even Senior Brother Ling Feng is not Xue Yun’s match, how could Jian Wushuang fight with him so equally and not appear weaker than him?”?Jian Meng’er could not say a word at that moment.

Meanwhile, Shui Hanxin looked towards her.

After staring at each other for a few minutes, the expressions on their faces became slightly self-deprecating.
