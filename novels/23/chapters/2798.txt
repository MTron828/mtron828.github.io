Chapter 2799: The Thousand Square-shaped Ray

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Although Palace Master Nan Wu was seriously injured and her strength was greatly reduced, her battle strength was still at the peak of the great divine master level, and her methods were extremely formidable.

Under the cover of a large amount of black thunderbolt power, a huge thunderbolt beast appeared once again. This Thunderbolt Beast Covered Palace Master Nan Wu’s entire body. It roared and appeared in front of Jian wushuang. Its bloody mouth had already opened, it was ready to swallow Jian Wushuang’s entire body.

But at this moment..

Jian wushuang, who had narrowed his eyes, suddenly opened them.

A fierce light flashed in his eyes.

Then Jian Wushuang attacked.

He just attacked casually, looking like an ordinary person swinging a wooden sword.

But when he swung his long sword, a sword light immediately lit up.

This sword light was extremely weak, extremely dim, and incomplete.

It was a broken light, a remnant light!

However, when this remnant light appeared, in the blink of an eye, there were at least hundreds and thousands of scattered lights in the world.

Under the gaze of Palace Master Nan Wu, the original Jian Wushuang suddenly became hundreds and thousands of people!

Palace master Nan Wu was shocked. The Black Thunder Beast covering his body suddenly swallowed, but it had already lost its target. The swallowing did not even touch jian Wushuang’s clothes.

“Chi!”!

The sound of the sword tip entering his body suddenly sounded.

Palace master Nan Wu felt a sharp pain in his waist, and then his eyes widened.

“This, this is...”

Palace Master Nan Wu turned his head with great difficulty and saw Jian wushuang, who was still holding a longsword, standing behind him. Blood was flowing slowly on the body of Jian Wushuang’s longsword.

“Ultimate, ultimate ultimate skill!”

Palace Master Nan Wu murmured a few words, but his body had been divided into two parts, starting from his waist.

In that moment, Jian Wushuang’s blood mountain sword had cut through his body armor, which was already damaged.

Palace Master Nan Wu’s eyes dimmed, and his consciousness completely disappeared.

In the blink of an eye, he was dead!

..

Silence! !

In such a huge battlefield, if the experts from both sides were fighting crazily, it would be shocking and noisy. However, at this moment, the entire battlefield was completely silent, and everyone subconsciously stopped what they were doing.

One by one, they looked in the direction of the center with shock and disbelief.

In their sight, Jian wushuang stood there calmly with a sword in one hand, and there was a cold corpse that had been cut into two pieces under his feet.

That corpse was actually palace master Nan Wu’s.

“Dead? Palace Master Nan Wu is dead?”

“How is it possible?”

“Impossible! ! !”

“This, this...”

An unprecedented clamor exploded in the void.

The great divine masters from both sides were all shocked by the scene.

It was Palace Master Nan Wu!

The publicly acknowledged number one expert of the Pill Sun Sacred World!

Before the battle began, none of them thought that Jian wushuang could fight palace master Nan Wu head-on. Even if they could stop her, it was unlikely. But now, the result was right in front of them, not only did Jian wushuang completely stop palace master Nan Wu, but he also fought her head-on. They were evenly matched, and he used all kinds of killer moves to force Palace Master Nan Wu into a miserable state.

Now, Jian Wushuang killed Palace Master Nan Wu out of everyone’s expectations?

How did he do it?

Everyone was a little confused.

Jian wushuang, who was standing quietly beside Palace Master Nan Wu’s corpse, had a strange smile on his face.

“The eighth move of space-time swordsmanship... I’ve been trapped for so long, and I’ve been studying it carefully for so long, but I’ve never been able to create it. I didn’t expect to fight with Palace Master Nan Wu head-on today. With the support of the sword principle world, I used all my strength to fight with Palace Master Nan Wu. I found a special state and finally created the eighth move!”! “!”

“Sure enough, only real combat is the fastest way to improve my strength.”

Jian wushuang was also very happy.

He had been stuck in the seventh move of the space-time swordsmanship for a long time.

Before he came to the Danyang continent, he had already created the seventh move. However, after such a long time, he still could not create the eighth move. This move had been stuck for too long, but he had already begun to study and ponder it, he just could not really create it.

However, today’s battle had given him a rare opportunity.

And he had perfectly grasped this opportunity.

“This sword move of mine seems to have thousands of rays of remnant light. Therefore, its name should be thousand rays of remnant light,”Jian wushuang muttered.

From then on, the eighth move of the spacetime sword art, thousand rays of remnant light, created by Jian wushuang, was finally completed!

Once the sword art was completed, he used it to kill Palace Master Nan Wu, who was seriously injured!

It could only be blamed on palace master Nan Wu’s bad luck to encounter Jian wushuang, who was extremely talented in sword principle.

If it were anyone else, even in the same situation, they would not be able to seize this opportunity to create a new unique move. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

After the unique move was completed, Palace Master Nan Wu was also killed. Jian wushuang was overjoyed, but he knew the current situation. He quickly suppressed his joy and slowly looked at the other battlefields around him, his face darkened.

Although he had won the battle, the other battlefields... except for Yin Su’er, were all at a disadvantage. It had been a long time since the battle began, most of the great divine masters Yin Su’er had brought with her had used up their divine power. The others were almost exhausted and could not hold on much longer.

The Sword Union was also at an absolute disadvantage. In this battle... Both Dark Eagle and the junior great divine master who had joined the Sword Union had died!

More great divine masters under Yin Su’er had died.

On the other hand, not many great divine masters from the Alliance of the four forces had died so far.

Fortunately, Jian Wushuang had dealt with Palace Master Nan Wu in time, so there was still room for improvement. If he had delayed any longer, yin su’er, the experts from the Cloud Mountain sect, and the sword union would have died in less than 15 minutes! Except for the few peak divine masters, all of them were probably dead!

“Watch me!”

Seeing the situation around him, Jian Wushuang’s eyes suddenly turned cold.

Boom! ! !

A majestic divine power suddenly erupted from Jian Wushuang’s body like a volcano that had been silent for hundreds of millions of years.
