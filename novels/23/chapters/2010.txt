2011 Interrogation

Silver-Winged God Mansion Master, one of the eighty-four God Mansion Masters in Three-Emperors World, ruled a large territory.

“This is where Silver-Winged God Mansion Master stay?”

In the boundless void above, Jian Wushuang and the other three members stood side by side. At the end of their sights, there were buildings on the mountain peak.

There was a large number of palaces and pavilions towering there. There was a huge and magnificent estate above them all.

According to the information they got from the Master of Double Dragon Region, Silver-Winged God Mansion Master stayed in the estate.

Jian Wushuang spread his soul power and sensed the existence of Silver-Winged God Mansion Master.

“Zhi Luo, I shall leave the surrounding spacetime to you,” Abysmal Saint Master took a look at Great Emperor Zhi Luo.

“Don’t worry, I will seal off the surrounding spacetime entirely to ensure Silver-Winged God Mansion Master couldn’t send out any information,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo said.

She was best at controlling spacetime. When she performs Spacetime Seal, even an ordinary Great Emperor couldn’t send out a message in a short time, let alone Silver-Winged God Mansion Master, who was only an Emperor God.

“Hehe. Silver-Winged God Mansion Master is raging in anger,” Jian Wushuang looked at the faraway estate with interest.

“If so, let us meet Silver-Winged God Mansion Master then,” Abysmal Saint Master sounded cold.

The four of them immediately moved.

In the estate before them, there was a malicious-looking man in silver armor. His eyes were shimmering with silver light as he overlooked a bunch of people standing below him. His rage was spread across ruthlessly.

“Humph, Region Master Tian Xin has guts! Didn’t he know about the relationship between Mu Yong Family and me? How could he just watch as Mu Yong Family got bullied by Su Family?” The malicious-looking man in silver armor, Silver-Winged God Mansion Master, roared like a raging lion.

There was a fragile maiden lying in Silver-Winged God Mansion Master’s arms. The maiden was beautiful and her body was charming. She was absolutely a seductress. Then, she was speaking with a captivating voice, “God Mansion Master, not only did Region Master Tian Xin watch as Mu Yong Family was bullied by Su Family, I also heard that he received benefits from Su Family. The reason why Su Family could be doing better than my Mu Yong Family is because of Region Master Tian Xin.”

“There’s such a thing?” Silver-Winged God Mansion Master was angry. He roared, “Send Region Master Tian Xin a message. Tell him I give him a month’s time for him to send over the head of the family head of Su Family personally. If he can’t do it, I will take his head personally!!”

“Yes,” The people standing below nodded in horror and they quickly left.

“Beauty, don’t worry. I am here. In Silver-Winged God Mansion, no one would dare to bully your Mu Yong Family,” Silver-Winged God Mansion Master smiled maliciously as his eyes burned with lust when he looked at the seductress.

“Thank you, God Mansion Master,” the charming maiden replied with her captivating voice again then she chuckled. She just started chuckling and she suddenly stopped.

There was a flash of terror in the charming maiden’s eyes. Then, her body instantly slouched.

It was obvious that her consciousness had been exterminated.

“Who?”

Silver-Winged God Mansion Master was angry. He was then soaring with rage and immediately spread his boundless murderous intention.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were four figures that substantiated before Silver-Winged God Mansion Master from nowhere.

Silver-Winged God Mansion Master, who was originally soaring with murderous intention, was dumbfounded when he saw the four of them.

As they stood face-to-face, he could see the aura that the four of them spread.

Among the four of them, besides the young man carrying a sword on his back was in Early Stage Chaotic Realm, the other three’s auras had already reached a level that made him quiver in fear.

“Peak Chaotic Realm, experts in Peak Chaotic Realm!!”

“And there are three of them?”

Silver-Winged God Mansion Master was shocked too. He immediately bowed at the people before him and said politely, “Yin Yi greets three Misters!”

He only bowed at the three of them, Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zhi Luo and Emperor Jiu Qiao. As for Jian Wushuang, he didn’t bother.

“Silver-Winged God Mansion Master, you are living a great life, huh,” Abysmal Saint Master smiled maliciously. He stole a glance at the cold dead body on the floor.

The dead body naturally belonged to the charming beauty.

The charming beauty was Silver-Winged God Mansion Master’s favorite woman. The moment the charming beauty died, the rage burning in his eyes showed.

However, Silver-Winged God Mansion Master wasn’t angry at all. Murderous intention and anger were nowhere to be seen. He looked in reverence as though the person who just died had nothing to do with him.

“I wonder how can I help you?” Silver-Winged God Mansion Master asked politely.

“Let me ask you. Reply to me honestly,” Abysmal Saint Master said coldly.

“Mister, go ahead and ask,” Silver-Winged God Mansion Master was so passionate.

Abysmal Saint Master asked and it was naturally about Three-Emperors World.

Such as the layout of Three-Emperor World and the secret that some experts and ordinary cultivators didn’t know.

After some questioning, Silver-Winged God Mansion Master’s reply was about the same as the Master of Double Dragon Region, Tian Xingzi.

“Silver-Winged God Mansion Master, you are a God Mansion Master. It’s impossible that you only know all these, right? For instance, don’t you know any secret about Three-Emperor World?” Abysmal Saint Master asked coldly. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Silver-Winged God Mansion Master felt a tug at his heartstrings.

He saw the few of them earlier and subconsciously thought that the three of them were in Peak Chaotic Realm and should be the leaders of the twelve states. However, from Abysmal Saint Master’s interrogation, he could tell that the four of them seemed to be rather unfamiliar with Three-Emperors World.

How could a state leader be so unfamiliar with Three Emperors World?

Why would they come to ask him such questions?

There was no doubt that the few people in front of him were from an unusual origin.

Although Silver-Winged God Mansion Master was shocked, he remained composed when he said, “You must be joking. I am merely one of the God Mansion Masters, how am I qualified to know any core secrets of Three Emperors World. Besides, even if I did know, how much more would I know compared to you three Misters?”

The four of them exchanged a look and smiled.

“Silver-Winged God Mansion Master is really good at talking. I think I will need to pull some tricks, then you will be willing to tell me the truth,” Abysmal Saint Master said coldly.

“Tricks?” Silver-Winged God Mansion Master looked surprised.

Then, Abysmal Saint Master’s gaze became cold and the dark light in his body poured out and covered the entire estate.

The entire estate was engulfed in boundless darkness. In the boundless darkness, Abysmal Saint Master was the ruler.
