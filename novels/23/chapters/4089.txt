Chapter 4093: Someone Came

Hearing Devil Flame’s words, Jian Wushuang could not help but fall silent.

Indeed, although this encounter was extremely dangerous for him, he still survived in the end. But what about the other cultivators in the Nine Luminaries Galaxy?

Previously, when Supervisor Feixue sent him a message, she told him that these people had started a massacre in the Nine Luminaries Galaxy to completely destroy it.

With their strength, would it not be easy for them to destroy a great Star Field?

Although the Nine Luminaries Galaxy had many Star Worlds and countless living beings, after this battle, how many Star Worlds could be preserved and how many living beings could survive?

Compared to the countless living beings and cultivators killed in this disaster, he was indeed extremely lucky.

“This is the universe!” Jian Wushuang sighed.

Although he had been wandering in the universe for more than 100,000 years, it was not until today that he truly understood the cruelty of the universe.

Compared to the Divine Beginning Realm, the universe boat’s slaughter was crazier, more sudden, and more bottomless.

For some experts in the universe, destroying a large Star Field and killing billions of creatures was like crushing an ant. It was very common.

However, Jian Wushuang had never seen these things with his own eyes.

“Hu!”

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang took out a communication token.

“Supervisor Feixue.” Jian Wushuang sent a message to Supervisor Feixue.

“My friend Blood Sword, you survived?” Supervisor Feixue replied quickly.

“Thank you for sending the message in time so that I can be prepared. Otherwise…” Jian Wushuang thanked Supervisor Feixue.

Indeed, if Supervisor Feixue had sent him a message in advance, he would have been alert. Otherwise, he might not have been able to escape from that Ruler.

And even if he could escape, his wife and Devil Flame might not have been so lucky.

After all, it was precisely because he had received a message from Supervisor Feixue that he had immediately sent his wife, Devil Flame, and that Eighth into the universe boat so that he could carry them with him.

If they had not entered the universe boat earlier and that Ruler had attacked, the Dusty Rain Star World would have instantly collapsed. He might not have had the time to protect Leng Rushuang.

“Little friend, you are too polite. You are a friend of my Nine Emperor Pavilion. As the supervisor of the Nine Emperor Pavilion in the nine effulgent great star region, it is only right for me to give you a warning beforehand.” Supervisor Feixue laughed, then he asked, “Blood Sword, have you left the Nine Luminaries Galaxy?”

“Not yet, but I’m at the edge of it,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Then there’s no need for you to run now, my friend. The experts sent by some big forces in the depths of the universe have arrived. Those who killed in the Nine Luminaries Galaxy can only run for their lives now,” Supervisor Feixue said.

“Have the experts from the depths of the universe arrived?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes, but he was not surprised.

Although the Nine Luminaries Galaxy was not located in the depths of the universe, it was very close. Moreover, the Nine Luminaries Galaxy had existed for a very long time. It was an extremely ancient Star Field, and there were many experts born in history, there were probably many Supreme experts.

Such a great galaxy must have many connections in the depths of the universe. How could some of the top experts or forces in the universe allow the Nine Luminaries Galaxy to be destroyed so easily?

It was certain that some experts would arrive.

However, Jian Wushuang did not expect that these experts would be so fast.

It would take tens of thousands of years, or even hundreds of thousands of years, or even longer, to travel from the depths of the universe to the Nine Luminaries Galaxy slowly with the help of the universe boat.

However, not long after that group of people had rampaged in the Nine Luminaries Galaxy, the experts from the depths of the universe had arrived. It was obvious that they had used some of the universe passages that led directly to the Nine Luminaries Galaxy.

The cost of opening such passages was extremely shocking.

“Supervisor Feixue, can you tell me which forces have sent experts from the depths of the universe this time?” Jian Wushuang asked casually.

“It’s not a secret, so it’s okay to tell you.” Supervisor Feixue smiled. “This time, the Nine Luminaries Galaxy has encountered a great disaster, and five forces in the depths of the universe have been alarmed. Among the five forces, three of them are under the command of experts. Some of them are related to the Nine Luminaries Galaxy, and another one belongs to a special camp which contains a mission. And the last one is the Nine Emperor Pavilion!

“The reason why the experts of the Nine Emperor Pavilion came here is because the branch of the Nine Emperor Pavilion was destroyed by those people.”

Jian Wushuang nodded secretly.

“Blood Sword, since the experts from the depths of the universe have arrived, there will be no more trouble in the Nine Luminaries Great Star Field. You Don’t have to leave in a hurry. You can come to the Nine Emperor Pavilion again when you have time. The position of the Lord sent by the Nine Emperor Pavilion is extraordinary. If you come to the Nine Emperor Pavilion, maybe I can introduce you,” said Supervisor Feixue.

“Thank you, Supervisor Feixue.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Soon, he cut off the communication with Supervisor Feixue.

At this moment, in the dark void in the center of the Nine Luminaries Great Star Field.

Rumble! A terrifying pressure gathered and formed a huge storm.

In this storm, towering figures stood there casually. No matter how strong the storm was, it could not move these figures at all.

There were a total of six people standing in the storm.

These six people were all Supreme-beings.

And one of them was a white-haired elder with a child’s face. He was the Supreme-being who had been hiding in the Nine Luminaries Great Star Field.

However, this white-haired elder was clearly inferior when facing the other five people.

“Five people, this is all I know. As for the origins of those people, I don’t know anything about their goals,” said the white-haired elder with a child’s face.

After hearing the white-haired elder’s explanation, the five people in the storm frowned.

“You’re saying that there’s a Supreme-being amongst them?” An arrogant man with eagle-like eyes asked. His voice was filled with a metallic pressure.

“That’s right. Although he didn’t really make a move and merely glanced at me, I could sense the pressure he was giving me. The pressure he was giving me was definitely on the level of a Supreme-being,” the white-haired elder said.

“This is going to be interesting.” The wild man grinned. “How many Supreme Ruler-level experts are there in the entire universe? It’s fine if you can’t recognize them, but when you saw us rush over, you immediately left without saying a word…” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
