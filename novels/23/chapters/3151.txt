“It’s just a reminder, there’s no problem. In addition, the reason why Heavenly Sword Marquis allowed the three Palace Masters to allow him to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm must be some special reason. The three Palace Masters should also take him seriously. You can also report this to the three Palace Masters.” The green-haired woman said.

“Yes, I will go and look for the three Palace Masters now.” Mo Shan immediately stood up and went to seek an audience with the three Palace Masters.

...

The manor was as beautiful as a fairyland. All kinds of rare and precious beasts were scattered all over the manor.

In the middle of the manor, a barefooted bald man in a white robe was sitting on a throne in a grand hall. He was laughing as he looked at the three people kneeling below him.

The auras of these three people were extremely powerful, and they had all reached the peak of rank seven.

However, these three rank seven Peak True Saints had their heads buried in the ground, not daring to raise their heads to look at the bald man above them. Even though the white-robed bald man had always been laughing, and had an extremely gentle and understanding appearance...the bodies of the three kneeling people were trembling crazily.

This trembling was because they were terrified!

“Go.”

The white-robed bald man smiled and waved his hand. The three rank seven Peak True Saints kneeling in the main hall started to turn into nothingness without any warning.

This nothingness was because the three of them were gradually disappearing.

Even if they disappeared, the three rank seven Peak True Saints could see their situation. Their eyes were wide open, but they could only watch helplessly as they disappeared.

Soon, the three rank seven Peak True Saints disappeared completely, as if they had never come into this world.

After casually killing the three people in front of him, the white-robed bald man still had a warm smile on his face.

At this time...sou!

A black-robed figure suddenly appeared in the main hall. After appearing, he immediately knelt down in front of the white-robed bald man.

“Master, there’s news about the person you ordered to find,” the black-robed figure said respectfully.

“Hmm?” The white-robed bald man’s expression changed and he looked down. “Speak.”

“This is a mirror image that I just obtained from the first heaven. Master, take a look.” The black-robed figure waved his hand and a mirror image immediately appeared in the void of the hall, it was the scene of Jian Wushuang and Bai Yuan fighting head-on.

The white-robed bald man kept looking at the mirror image. From the beginning to the end of the fierce battle, he was smiling, and his expression did not change at all.

Until the mirror image disappeared.

“Master, the rank four True Saint in the image is called Heavenly Sword Marquis. He is now a heaven-level member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, and the one he killed was a rank seven True Saint of the Purple Cloud Pavilion. During this process, the secret skill that Heavenly Sword Marquis used...” the black-robed figure had not finished speaking.

The white-robed bald man waved his hand. “Heaven punisher, nine luminaries star armor. If I’m not mistaken, he also used the Seven Stars Secret Technique. Out of the five secret techniques of the Seven Stars Mysterious Sect, he used three of them at the same time.”

“Not only that, but he is also good at Sword Dao, and his combat power is shocking. A rank four True Saint actually killed a rank seven True Saint, which is three ranks higher than him. Ordinary cultivators can’t do it at all. Even those special life forms with huge innate advantages probably don’t have the ability to do it. Only perfect chaotic creatures with the most perfect life level have the chance to do it!”

The smile on the white-robed bald man’s face became even more dazzling and intoxicating.

He possessed the secret arts of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect, and he even had three of them.

He was also good at sword arts.

The key was that his ability to jump levels was ridiculously strong. When the three of them were combined, his identity was obvious.

“Although his appearance has changed a little, he is after all reincarnated. It is normal for him to change. Moreover, it is possible that he has been deliberately disguising himself to change his appearance.” The white-robed bald man muttered softly, “In any case, there is a 99% chance that Heavenly Sword Marquis is the person we are looking for.”

“Jian Wushuang!”

After confirming Jian Wushuang’s identity, the white-robed bald man immediately sent a message to the other two masters of the Saint Realm.

The three began to discuss.

“We can confirm that Jian Wushuang is Heavenly?Sword Marquis. He is now in the First Heaven, and he is fighting with a sect called the Purple Cloud Pavilion.”

“He has only lived for a few years, but he has already reached the rank four True Saint Realm and can surpass the rank seven True Saint Realm. If we continue to let him grow, it won’t be long before he is on par with us.”

“Kill him! Since we know his location, we must kill him as soon as possible!”

“Unfortunately, this kid is very cautious. He didn’t reveal his life level. Otherwise, the will of heaven would have locked onto his existence and killed him instantly.”

The Third Heaven was the core of the Divine Beginning World, where the will of heaven was the most powerful. There was no doubt about that.

However, although the will of heaven was strong, it was still impossible to find Jian Wushuang in the Third Heaven without Jian Wushuang revealing his life aura.

“I’m afraid it’s not realistic to kill him with the will of Heavenly Dao. We have to find him ourselves and kill him at all costs!”

“In addition, let the Witch God Sect take action. The Witch God Sect’s people are very strange and powerful. In the Divine Beginning World, no one can find a person faster than the Witch God Sect!”

The three Great Saint Realm Masters quickly came to a unanimous conclusion.

...

This area was at the bottom of a huge abyss.

There was no sunlight here. Everything was pitch-black and pitch-black.

In the center of the vast and boundless dark hall, a hazy dark figure suddenly condensed on the throne.

“Pass down the order. Find this person called Heavenly Sword Marquis in the picture as fast as possible. Then, capture him at all costs. Remember, you must capture him alive!” A hoarse voice came out of the dark figure’s mouth, it reverberated throughout the entire dark hall.

There were at least hundreds of people kneeling in the dark hall. These hundreds of people all had extremely powerful auras and wore black robes.

When they heard the dark figure’s words, everyone spoke in unison, “We obey the Sorcerer God’s order!”

Their voices shook the sky and reverberated throughout the entire hall.

The Sorcerer God... The real ruler of the Sorcerer God Sect was a terrifying existence whose strength was no less than that of the three masters of the Saint Realm.

No one in the Sorcerer God Sect dared to disobey the order given by the Sorcerer God himself.

However, there was something strange. When the three masters of the Saint Realm sent a message to the Sorcerer God, they said that they would kill Jian Wushuang at all costs.

But now, the Witch God said they would capture him alive!
