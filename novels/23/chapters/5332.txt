Chapter 5331 - 5331: Entering Beishan City

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Thinking about facing the extraordinary Dao Lord Jian Wushuang, Zhu Bachi showed courage and meticulousness. After accepting the pill, he began preparing for the upcoming major battle.

If everything went as expected, Jian Wushuang wouldn‚Äôt stop, which was ideal. The one behind him would catch up soon. Although Zhu Bachi might not capture Jian Wushuang alive, guiding and marking the way would be sufficient to gain a substantial amount of treasures.

If Jian Wushuang had any reliance and dared to set foot in this city, Zhu Bachi would make sure to detain him.

As for the rumors about Guangmu Tianzun, Zhu Bachi was aware of them but hoped they wouldn‚Äôt turn out to be true.

Calculating in his mind, Zhu Bachi knew the pursuer behind him would arrive in about a quarter of an hour.

The distance from here to Beishan City was also approximately a quarter of an hour, leaving a gap of less than ten breaths.

He only needed to stop Jian Wushuang for ten breaths to consider the mission accomplished. In his origin source, a golden token engraved with the character ‚ÄòShadow‚Äô trembled.

Faster!

Jian Wushuang was also closing in quickly.

They were about to reach Beishen City, entering a critical moment.

Zhu Bachi wasn‚Äôt sure about the fisherman‚Äôs strength, but being able to withstand Daoist Liuyang for ten breaths indicated at least a standard power level of a tier 5 Emperor.

A puppet at this level, fighting desperately for ten breaths, had a good chance of success.

The rest depended on his luck.

In the distant southern region of Zhangzhou, beyond the countless spaces, a group of peak experts from the Elder Palace passed by Jian Wushuang and the others without detection.

If Jian Wushuang had gone to Hanzhou, there might have been a chance encounter, but it seemed unlikely now.

Zhu Bachi could only silently pray for Guangmu Tianzun to intervene.

Rubbing the jade tablet on his thumb, he could only rely on it now.

As long as they had followed the Qishen. the peak experts should recognize

this tablet. Seeing it would prompt them to lend a helping hand.

Boom!

Without waiting for him to contemplate, a black dazzling light struck again, interrupting his thoughts and causing the ancient boat to pause once more.

Jian Wushuang stabilized his figure, turned to look behind, his gaze becoming unusually sharp.

‚ÄúHmph!t

A tier 5 Emperor was nothing; as long as he succeeded in merging with the Dao, his combat power could probably reach the tier 4 Emperor.

With the strength of his formidable spatial origin source, it wouldn‚Äôt take long for him to advance to tier 5.

With his origin source , after reaching tier 5 Emperor, dealing with a mere tier 5 Emperor like Liuyang would be as easy as flipping his hand.

As long as he could leave alive, he vowed to avenge this grievance in the future. If he managed to survive and reported this assassination attempt, this Daoist Liuyang would not escape death.

Beishan City.

A ancient city nestled in the mountains, though it lacked the imposing aura of Sharuo City.

Despite having a tier 5 Emperor in the city, the defensive array was much weaker compared to Sharuo City. This area belonged to the borderlands, devoid of ordinary people, with only some refugee Emperors and few Dao Lords daring to venture here.

Since the strong from the Elder Palace left this place, the powerful figures within Beishan City, upon hearing about the events in Liuzhou, had also started fleeing.

Most of these individuals were Emperors wanted by the Divine Temple, afraid to venture into other large states, so they could only escape deep into Zhangzhou with their heads down.

The Divine Temple‚Äôs control here was limited to a teleportation array, ignoring everything else.

This was a face-saving measure for Guangmu Tianzun.

The Emperors and Dao Lords still daring to stay in the city were mostly those who thought themselves invincible or were clinging to a thread of hope. Liuzhou State was in a state of shock. Those who had escaped all went to Hanzhou.

With the upheaval in Liuzhou, those who escaped went to Hanzhou. The origin of the turmoil in Liuzhou was unknown, only rumors of a terrifying presence emerging and annihilating Venerable Lie Huo.

Subsequently, there was rampant destruction in Sharuo City, obliterating all teleportation arrays within Liuzhou‚Äôs borders.

This was obviously a purposeful visit. As long as they avoid Flow State, would the other party dare to cause trouble in North Mu Zhangzhou?

Although North Mu Zhangzhou was somewhat desolate and lacked formidable experts, the title of Guangmu Tianzun resounded throughout the Northern Region, ranking among the top superpowers in the region.

Even if the other party were to be reckless, they wouldn‚Äôt come here to seek trouble, right?

The current situation, however, contradicted the expectations of these individuals.

In the murky sky, a black ancient boat traversed through.

The Emperor within the city, upon seeing the ancient boat, hadn‚Äôt reacted in time. In the next moment, the ancient boat was right in front of him.

This speed exceeded the limits of space, almost reaching a touch-and-go existence.

As the ancient boat entered Beishan City, Daoist Liuyang followed closely.

‚ÄúHe actually stopped here; it seems this kid does have some reliance!‚Äù Liuyang swept a cold glance over the city with icy eyes.

The City Lord was just an ordinary tier 5 Emperor and didn‚Äôt dare to act rashly in front of him.

The Emperors stationed by the temple in this city were only tier 4. Even if he killed them, he would at most escape for a few hundred epochs, spend some treasures, and settle things to absolve himself of guilt.

When they were still a million miles away from the teleportation array, Jian

Wushuang roared, ‚ÄúNow is the time, stop him!‚Äù

After leaving this sentence behind, he flashed down from the ancient boat, his tenth refined physique erupting completely, transforming into countless pitch-black lines, flying towards the teleportation array.

A transformation into myriad forms‚Äîthis was the supreme physique.

In extreme situations, both his origin source and divine body could be severed and transformed into countless entities.

Even if the Emperor wanted to kill him, it wouldn‚Äôt be so simple.

As his figure just left the ancient boat, the fisherman‚Äôs form changed, pulling out a long knife from behind.

Facing the pursuit of Daoist Liuyang, he faced death without fear.

Say ten breaths, then it‚Äôs ten breaths.

The ancient boat was forged in ancient times, obtained from the Wind Demon by the fisherman, with strength comparable to a tier 5 Emperor, and fearless in the face of death.

When Yang Sanmu brought him here, it was originally intended tor the protection of the younger generation. Later, in a great crisis, the fisherman was placed on the ancient boat and became a permanent member.

Daoist Liuyang saw the fisherman blocking his way and jumped down from the damaged hall.

‚ÄúYou go and stop Jian Wushuang, hold him off for three breaths for me!‚Äù

His voice was very confident.

Just three breaths, and he would kill the puppet in front of him.

Hum!

From the damaged hall, black mist leaked out, breaking through the air.

The fisherman tried to intercept, but was smashed aside by the Six-Armed Heavenly Demon formed by Daoist Liuyang.

‚ÄúExplode for me! ‚Äù

The demon formed by Daoist Liuyang was vast and mighty, shattering the void with a punch. Six arms unleashed tens of thousands of punches in an instant.

The fisherman‚Äôs violent sword technique struggled to resist, but still took several punches, and the protective treasures on his body shattered.

Daoist Liuyang sneered, saying that three breaths were too long; two breaths were more than enough.

A puppet without even an eternal treasure, weak and pitiful in strength, how could it withstand him?

swish!

In the next moment, six unyielding demon thorns appeared in his hand, shining brightly with infinite radiance.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that Daoist Liuyang!‚Äô

The City Lord of Beishan City, who dared not come out of the City Lord‚Äôs Mansion, saw the battle in the sky and revealed a look of astonishment.

Daoist Liuyangs strength was terrifying. Although they were of the same rank, there was a vast difference in their abilities. He couldn‚Äôt stop him if he went out, so he could only report and wait for the people from the Divine Temple to come..Fiind updùíÇted ùíèovels on nùíê/v/elbin(.)co/m
