2061 Great Emperor Zi Xu

‘Jian Wushuang, your power has improved significantly while you were in the Three-Emperors World. Aside from me, you are the strongest in the Sanctuary Alliance.?I shall leave Zi Xu to you,’ said Emperor Bai.

‘Sure. I am very keen to fight Great Emperor Zi Xu,’ Jian Wushuang pursed his lips as his eyes lit up with excitement.

‘Follow him, Red Dragon King,’ Emperor Bai commanded.

‘Yes,’ replied the Red Dragon King, as he rushed inside the manor together with Jian Wushuang.

The manor looked like a heavenly paradise. On the inside. A lone boat drifted aimlessly in the river. Great Emperor Zi Xu sat on the boat lazily and was fishing in a laid-back manner.

Woosh! Woosh!

Jian Wushuang and the Red Dragon King appeared in front of the lone boat.

‘How can you, Great Emperor Zi Xu, still fish after all that happened?’

Great Emperor Zi Xu rolled his eyes as he looked at Jian Wushuang and smiled. ‘What else do you want me to do?’ he replied.

He guessed that the Sanctuary Alliance had found out that he was the spy the moment his follower had died, and would definitely kill him.

Sadly, he knew that he could not escape even if he wanted to.

Hence, he might as well sit there quietly and wait for the arrival of the experts from the Sanctuary Alliance.

‘Why is it only two of you? Where is Emperor Bai?’ Great Emperor Zi Xu asked indifferently.

‘You do not deserve the personally attention of Emperor Bai. He sent us to deal with you. He has no time,’ Jian Wushuang said coldly.

‘Is that the case? Do you really think that the two of you can kill me?’ Great Emperor Zi Xu scoffed.

‘How will we know if we don’t try?’ Jian Wushuang replied abruptly.

Boom!

A wave of monstrous divine might radiated from Jian Wushuang and spread out in all directions.

The surrounding river waters exploded and instantly rose to heights so great that the silt beneath the river water could be seen. The boat under the feet of Great Emperor Zi Xu exploded to pieces instantly.

Jian Wushuang attacked.

Whew! Whew! Whew! Whew! Whew!

Five beams of sparkling golden light lit up and burst forth at high speed.

These five beams of light originated from the Hong Jun Golden Sword that Jian Wushuang wielded.

There were only five swords, and Jian Wushuang’s understanding of the Power of Spacetime was limited to a peak of eight stories in Doctrine Palace. Despite this, the power generated was greatly different from before as the Hong Jun Golden Sword that Jian Wushuang had used employed the Power of Spacetime.

Jian Wushuang, who was on the second stage, had divine power far greater than that of a normal Great Emperor. Each of the Hong Jun Golden Sword would force any Great Emperor to go all out, much less when five of these swords were used together.

As the Great Emperor Zi Xu saw the five beams of light strike towards him, he smiled indifferently as he drew a purple spear that radiated death.Even though each stab of the spear looked casual, the speed of the stabs ware incredible.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

The five Hong Jun Golden Sword was deflected and flew back.

Just then, Jian Wushuang dashed up to Great Emperor Zi Xu and slashed out using his Blood Mountain Sword.

Sword slashes that radiated death burst forth. At the edge of the sword, a faded drop of blood was condensing.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo, Extreme Blood Style.

‘Humph!’

Great Emperor Zi Xu snorted lightly. His body seemed to turn into nothing as he thrust his spear out lightly.

Clang!

The collision produced a strong shockwave that would push them back.?A hint of ferocity flashed across his eyes as Jian Wushuang changed his Sword Momentum instantly.

Beams of gloomy swordlight formed a special arc in the void.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo, Turn Monstrous With One Thought!

“Scram!”

The aura of Great Emperor Zi Xu skyrocketed, as his purple spear radiated an aura of great power. In an instant, it turned into a bolt of purple lighting and struck out.

The power was so terrifying that it forced Jian Wushuang to take a step back.

‘Oh?’

Jian Wushuang balanced himself. He looked at Great Emperor Zi Xu in disbelief and said, ‘Looks like Lord Spirit Sound was right. You concealed your true power, and to such a great extent!!’

Jian Wushuang was well aware that even though he had not gone all out with his swordsmanship in the last attack, he had used about seventy percent of his divine power.

Even if it was just seventy percent, the power was far greater than that of most Great Emperors. Great Emperor Zi Xu not only deflected his attack with ease, he also had the ability to force him back.

His power was far greater than even that of the Abysmal Saint Master.

Jian Wushuang had gauged that Great Emperor Zi Xu was not weaker than the brutish bald man Ling Zong, whom he’d met in Three-Emperors World.

‘Humph. Do you really think that the Red Dragon King deserved to be ranked second on the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list? I was just too afraid that people would grow suspicious of me having power that is too strong.’

On Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, Great Emperor Zi Xu was ranked fifth on the list for Great Emperors.

Higher up in the list included people like Emperor Bai, Red Dragon King, Abysmal Saint Master and Ancestor Tian Chen.

In reality, only Emperor Bai posed a threat to him. The other three were not strong enough for him to care.

‘I want to know how strong you really are,’ Jian Wushuang eyes lit up, as his sword essence rose. His divine power erupted as he attacked Great Emperor Zi Xu.

Jian Wushuang battled Great Emperor Zi Xu fiercely. He continued to put crazy amounts of pressure on Great Emperor Zi Xu by fully utilizing his swordsmanship. Furthermore, he had the aid of the five Hong Jun Golden Swords.

Great Emperor Zi Xu had a layer of purple shiny purple crystals around himself and looked as though he was a ghost. His fighting power was also astonishing. He was only at a slight disadvantage even though he was taking Jian Wushuang head on.

It’s important to note that in the Three-Emperors World, Jian Wushuang could take on thirteen Great Emperors at once.

‘The power of Zi Xu is stronger than what I imagined. He is slightly stronger than Ling Zong,’ Jian Wushuang thought. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang could completely dominate Ling Zong in a head-on battle.

However, against Great Emperor Zi Xu, he only had a slight advantage.

‘Haha. Since you could destroy the Supreme Emperor Stone and walk out of Three-Emperors World alive, your fighting power is much more powerful than before. Many of the Great Emperors in the Sanctuary Alliance believe that your fighting power is the closest to Emperor Bai’s. It seems like this is indeed true.’

‘It’s a pity that even though your fighting power is strong, it is only slightly above mine. You can barely oppress me, so don’t even think of killing me!’

Great Emperor Zi Xu laughed hysterically.

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

However, the Red Dragon King, who was not involved in the fight, moved.

An overbearing aura, which was mixed with an unbelievable amount of?Bloodline Power, erupted.

This aura was so strong that even Jian Wushuang looked over.
