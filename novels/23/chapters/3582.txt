Chapter 3583: Jian Wushuang’s Terrifying Strength

It had to be said that the Gray Python Master and the Death Slayer Master had a certain amount of strength to rely on when they dared to target Jian Wushuang.

Both of them were barely comparable to experts at the pinnacle of the six realm. Both of them attacked at the same time with their full strength.

Boom! Boom!

Two shocking auras attacked Jian Wushuang at the same time, one from the left and the other from the right. Among them, Gray Python Master held a strange dark-green long whip. The long whip swept like a flood dragon and directly covered Jian Wushuang, Jian Wushuang did not have any intention of resisting or dodging. He just let the long whip bind his body.

“It’s bound.” Gray Python Master’s eyes lit up.

He did not know why Jian Wushuang did not dodge or block. Perhaps it was because he was too fast and Jian Wushuang did not have time to react, but no matter what, Jian Wushuang was now completely bound by him, there was no chance for him to make a move in a short period of time. On the other side, Death Slayer Master rushed over with a giant axe in both hands. Endless power surged into the giant axe.

Boom!

The giant axe cut through the air and chopped down at Jian Wushuang in a mighty manner.

This axe was Death Slayer Master’s most powerful axe. It was also an absolute art at the peak of stage six, and its power was extremely powerful.

Death Slayer Master’s eyes shone brightly when the axe fell.

“I got it.” Gray Python Master also smiled.

The two of them were best friends. They often roamed the three battlefields together, so they had a good understanding of each other. For example, this time, the two of them cooperated very well, Gray Python Master immediately tied Jian Wushuang up, while Death Slayer Master used his most powerful move to attack Jian Wushuang. He did not give Jian Wushuang any chance to struggle.

Sure enough, the giant axe hit Jian Wushuang’s divine body without any obstruction.

Clang!

A sound like metal colliding rang out. The blood-red robe Jian Wushuang was wearing had a faint blood-red luster, and the power of the axe was reduced by 99% at once, only 1% of the power was transmitted to Jian Wushuang’s body, and he could easily withstand the power.

“You two work well together.”

Jian Wushuang stood there quietly with a smile on his face. While speaking, he deliberately blinked at Gray Python Master and Death Slayer Master.

“How is this possible?”

Gray Python Master and Death Slayer Master were both shocked.

Death Slayer Master’s Strongest Axe had clearly struck Jian Wushuang’s divine body. Even if those experts at the peak of stage six, who had powerful defensive skills, were to rely on their divine bodies to withstand such an axe…they would at least suffer some damage.

But what about Jian Wushuang?

He took the blow head-on, but his face remained calm and his divine body did not move at all.

“He...he completely ignored my attack?” Death Slayer Master’s eyes widened.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang smiled again. “You’ve used your tricks. Now, it’s my turn.”

As soon as he finished his words, he saw a burst of blood-red light surging on the blood-red robe, instantly giving Jian Wushuang a shocking power. Jian Wushuang’s body trembled slightly, the dark-green whip that was originally bound to his body was directly pushed back. Jian Wushuang easily broke free from the restraint and then pulled out the Blood Mountain Sword behind him.

Yes, he only used the Blood Mountain Sword, which was not even an elementary universe supreme treasure.

But on the other side, he had already activated the first level of power of the Blood Demon Cave Armor. In an instant, 10 times the power of an expert at the pinnacle of the six realm gathered in his hands, and then he directly slashed down with his sword!

This strike immediately triggered the universe origin of the sword principle.

The unparalleled sword manual, Xi Xiang!

Boom!

This extremely violent strike triggered the universe origin and instantly formed a shocking blood-red sword rainbow. Its power was even more earth-shattering!

It must be known that during the 97,000 years that Jian Wushuang was trapped in the 18-ultimate formation, his swordsmanship had received an incredible improvement. In the unparalleled sword manual, these moves of his, Jian Wushuang…had All reached the level of a level-seven absolute art.

The Xi Xiang move was a level-seven absolute art, which was an absolute art at the Ruler Realm. In addition, it was performed by Jian Wushuang with the power of 10 times that of an expert at the pinnacle of the six realm.

The sword instantly slashed toward the Gray Python Master in front of him.

The Gray Python Master also waved the long whip in his hand in an attempt to block it. However, the moment the long whip came into contact with the blood-red sword rainbow, it was sent flying. The sword light did not hinder it at all, and it struck the divine body of the Gray Python Master.

Gray Python Master was, after all, a great being who was barely comparable to a pinnacle of six levels, and his protective ability was not weak. He also had an advanced universe true treasure armor protecting his body. However, when faced with this sword, the result was...bang!

Gray Python Master’s eyes were still wide open. The armor protecting his body was not damaged, but his godly body had been instantly exploded, and all the godly power in his body had been completely annihilated, not a single bit of it was left.

In just a moment, Gray Python Master had died!

“He’s an expert at the pinnacle of the six realm. How could he be so weak?” Jian Wushuang looked at Gray Python Master, who was already dead, and could not help twitching his lips, he casually took the whip, the true treasure armor, and his interspatial ring that Gray Python Master had left behind.

In fact, it was not because the Gray Python Master was weak, but because Jian Wushuang was too strong!

The power of an expert at the pinnacle of the six realm was ten times stronger than that of most experts at the pinnacle of the six realm. In terms of power, Jian Wushuang was no weaker than the three masters of the Saint Realm in the Divine Beginning Realm.

This was only his own power. However, the swordsmanship that Jian Wushuang had just displayed was a seventh-level absolute art at the Ruler Realm. The three masters of the Saint Realm had never mastered such an absolute art. In other words…the strength that Jian Wushuang had just displayed was enough to crush the three masters of the Saint Realm in the Divine Beginning Realm. On the other hand, the Gray Python Master was barely comparable to an expert at the pinnacle of the six realm. How could he withstand his attack?

Naturally, he was killed in one strike.

“The Gray Python Master is dead, but the Death Slayer Master is fast enough.” Jian Wushuang glanced at the surrounding void. When the Death Slayer Master, who had attacked him together with the Gray Python Master, sensed that something was wrong, he immediately retreated, he immediately retreated. When he saw that Death Slayer Master was killed by Jian Wushuang, he was scared out of his wits. Therefore, he chose to escape without hesitation. Now, he was out of Jian Wushuang’s sight, Jian Wushuang could not chase after him.

“I said you would regret it, but you didn’t believe me.”

Jian Wushuang curled his lips and left immediately!
