Chapter 2916: Kill Him!

——

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The Blood Mountain Sword and the Demonic Purple Spear clashed three more times before Jian Wushuang managed to block the attack head-on.

“You’re the first Divine Master to block my attack head-on.” Zi Yi glanced at Jian Wushuang with a strange look in her eyes, and then boom!

Endless Spear essence burst out, and his divine power surged crazily, attacking Jian Wushuang again.

“Go!”

Jian Wushuang pointed from afar, and the reincarnation sword formation formed by 18 Netherblood Divine Swords burst out instantly.

Whoosh! The surroundings instantly turned into a white world of ice and snow.

Jian Wushuang also rushed out, and the reincarnation sword formation reached its peak in close combat with him.

While Jian Wushuang and Zi Yi were engaged in a fierce battle, the remaining eight people of the Supreme Emotion Valley had already arrived in front of Leng Rushuang.

“Junior Sister Leng, come with us.” Although the cold and arrogant woman’s voice was cold, her gaze toward Leng Rushuang was different from the others.

After all, they all knew how important Leng Rushuang was to the Supreme Emotion Valley. She had the hope of cultivating the supreme divine skill.

Leng Rushuang was also a disciple of the Supreme Emotion Valley, but once she entered the valley, she was favored by thousands of people. Her status was much higher than ordinary disciples like them.

Leng Rushuang glanced at Jian Wushuang, who was engaged in a bitter fight. Finally, she gritted her teeth and said, “I can go with you, but you can’t make things difficult for him anymore.”

“Huh?” The cold-arrogant woman’s face darkened. She looked at Leng Rushuang seriously. She said in a low voice, “You should forget all love in the world after entering our Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley. You are cold and emotionless. You are the best candidate to cultivate the divine skill of our Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley. But now, you are pleading for a man?”

“It’s fine if you don’t plead for mercy. But now that you are pleading for mercy, this Divine Master named Jian Yi is doomed to die!”

“Only when he’s completely dead and no longer appears in front of you will it not affect you in any way!”

“What?” Leng Rushuang was immediately shocked.

“Junior Sister Qiu.” The cold prideful woman glanced at the blue-haired woman behind her.

The blue-haired woman nodded slightly, and then she took a step forward. A blue light suddenly burst out from her pair of pitch-black eyes.

The blue light was beautiful and immediately attracted Leng Rushuang’s attention.

Leng Rushuang’s eyes immediately became misty.

Although she was talented and as easy as eating and drinking when she comprehended the rules, she had only cultivated for a short time and was only at the peak divine master level. She could not resist the illusion of an Immortal Saint. In the blink of an eye, Leng Rushuang fell into a deep sleep.

After Leng Rushuang fell into a deep sleep, the cold-arrogant woman once again looked in the direction where Jian Wushuang and Zi Yi were fighting.

“A mere Divine Master can fight with junior brother Zi Yi head-on, and his battle strength has reached the level of a rank one True Saint. But, unfortunately, he is deeply in love with his junior sister Leng, and the person who impressed him deeply is her. Such a person can not be allowed to enter our Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, so he can only be killed.”

“Junior brother Zi Yi, don’t dawdle with him. Just kill him!” The cold-arrogant woman shouted in a low voice.

“Yes.” Zi Yi nodded slightly. Then, a burst of bright purple light suddenly burst out from his body, and a purple exotic beast phantom appeared behind him.

A terrifying aura burst out from the purple exotic beast phantom, and Zi Yi’s eyes turned purple, becoming extremely demonic.

“Kill!”

Zi Yi attacked again. His momentum was several times stronger than when he fought with Jian Wushuang.

After all, Jian Wushuang had just fought with Zi Yi. Even if he exerted his killing ability and the reincarnation sword formation to the extreme, he was still at an absolute disadvantage.

Now, Zi Yi’s strength had increased by several times, and he was crushing Jian Wushuang.

Boom!

With a loud boom, Zi Yi held the purple long spear in both hands, and the size of the spear in his hands suddenly increased.

It was clearly a long spear, but at this moment, it was like a huge stick being held by Zi Yi, and then it was violently smashed out.

In an instant, the world fell silent.

Numerous mighty purple phantoms rushed toward Jian Wushuang at lightning speed.

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened. He held the Blood Mountain Sword with both hands and tried his best to defend himself.

However, as soon as the Blood Mountain Sword came into contact with the purple phantoms, a terrifying force immediately came into effect.

This force was much stronger than Jian Wushuang’s own power. It was completely overwhelming.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s body was affected by the power and he fell down. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

However, before he really appeared on the ground, Zi Yi suddenly appeared beside him. His eyes were like lightning, and a dazzling light shot out.

“God-severing demonic spear!” Zi Yi shouted.

The dazzling purple light was not hindered at all and directly hit Jian Wushuang’s divine body.

Although Jian Wushuang had the nine luminaries star armor and his golden armor, the nine luminaries star armor immediately collapsed under the dazzling purple light. As for the golden armor, although it was not of a high level, it had become extremely tough because it had fused with his perfect blood essence.

The spear did not directly pierce through his golden armor, but the terrifying power contained in the spear directly crushed his divine body through the golden armor.

Rumble…

Jian Wushuang’s divine body immediately collapsed.

“Is he dead?”

Zi Yi stood in the void beside him and watched Jian Wushuang’s divine body collapse with an extremely cold expression.

Jian Wushuang’s strength had indeed surprised him, but he was still surprised. His battle strength was so great that a rank one True Saint was no match for him.

But at this moment…

“Huh?”

Zi Yi suddenly frowned because he had already seen Jian Wushuang’s broken divine body begin to reassemble under the gathering of a large amount of divine power.

In the blink of an eye, an intact Jian Wushuang appeared in front of him again.

“Immortal body?” Zi Yi was surprised.

Even the cold-arrogant woman and the others behind him looked strange.

“He’s just a Divine Master, and his battle strength is comparable to a rank one True Saint. How could he have an immortal body that only a True Saint can control? This kid is strange,” the cold-arrogant woman muttered, however, her eyes turned slightly cold. “No matter how strange he is, since he has something to do with junior sister Leng, he must die!”
