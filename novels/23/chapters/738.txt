Chapter 739: Secret

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

There was a towering mountain outside the Ancient God Palace.

It existed for a long, long time in the Eternal Zone. The clansmen from the Ancient God Clan occasionally passed by this mountain when they went hunting.

At this moment…

“Imperial Bloodline?”

The resonant sound echoed through the mountain, causing it to convulse. “Crack!” A huge crack suddenly appeared on the mountain wall, followed by the mountain splitting in two as if it had been parted by someone.

In the blink of an eye, a 1,000-foot-tall Gold-armored Ancient God stepped out of the mountain.

…

At the same time, a giant figure flew out of the lake in the Eternal Zone.

A stone-faced young man walked out of a mansion.

In the depths of the Boundless Wasteland, a Gold-armored Ancient God dashed forward at amazing speed while ignoring the beasts on his way.

The weathered elder, Elder Yi, had sent out the messages in a special way. Those old monsters who had been living in seclusion all came out.

Shortly after, they all appeared in front of a black pavilion in the Ancient God Palace and fixed their eyes on Jian Wushuang, who was also looking at these Ancient Gods in shock.

Along with Elder Yi, the other eight Ancient Gods all had human appearances.

Regardless of their gender or age, they all had one thing in common—they were all Three-star Ancient Gods!

“Nine Three-star Ancient Gods!” Jian Wushuang gasped.

A Two-star Ancient God was comparable to a Dao Master.

There were four Dao Masters in the entire Firmament Territory—the masters of the three magnates and the Sect Master of the Ancient Sect.

Although the Ancient Sect had another three Dao Masters, they had already left the Firmament Territory.

The nine Ancient Gods were looking at Jian Wushuang in admiration.

“Imperial Bloodline. He really has the Imperial Bloodline!”

“Although it’s just a small part of the Imperial Bloodline, that’s enough.”

“Haha, many years have passed. We finally have an Imperial Bloodline clansman, but he is not strong.”

“He has just awakened his bloodline, so it’s natural that he is still weak. It won’t take long for him to meet the requirement.”

“Things are getting better.”

The nine Three-star Ancient Gods were in a heated discussion, looking surprised and delighted.

“Everyone…” The other Three-star Ancient Gods stopped talking and nodded slightly after hearing Elder Yi’s voice.

“OK, since you don’t have any questions, then I’ll explain it to the young boy,” Elder Yi said.

“OK, then we’ll all go to make some preparations.”

The other eight Three-star Ancient Gods could not help casting a fervent glance at Jian Wushuang before they left.

Jian Wushuang felt that it was very strange.

“Boy, your name is Jian Wushuang, right?”

Elder Yi looked over at the boy with a kind expression, then said, “I guess you’re very confused now, right?”

“Right.” Jian Wushuang nodded unconsciously.

What had happened just now puzzled him, as well as Granny Ying. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

They had no idea about the Imperial Bloodline, so it was not clear to them why the Three-star Ancient Gods were over the moon after receiving the news that Jian Wushuang had a part of the Imperial Bloodline.

“It’s normal that you’re confused about it. After all, in the entire clan, only we old guys know the secret.” Elder Yi sighed and started to explain.

“As we all know, our ancestor was an Ancient God who was strong enough to destroy the world.

“And actually, it’s inappropriate to call him the Ancient God. He is our king!”

“King?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Right, he was a Dark Gold Ancient God, the highest level, while the other Ancient Gods were his subordinates, who served him and followed his orders.”

Elder Yi continued, “We’re not his descendants, but his subordinates’ descendants.

“Many years ago, the king suddenly disappeared and the Holy Place closed, so many of his subordinates there became isolated from us.

“Over the past years, we’ve tried to enter the Holy Place.

“As long as we’re able to enter the Holy Place, we can find out the reason why the king was missing and why the Holy Place was closed. But the Formation there was too powerful, and even though all the Three-star Ancient Gods worked together, we were still unable to break it.

“It’s impossible to enter it with strength alone, so we have to turn to people who possess the Imperial Bloodline.

“It’s a pity that our king had no lineal descendants!

“We’ve lived in this world for a long, long time. Our bloodline has become weaker and weaker, let alone have we fostered the Imperial Bloodline, so we’ve all felt hopeless… But now, you’ve given us a glimmer of hope.

“Because… you have part of the Imperial Bloodline!”

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang finally understood.

The Imperial Bloodline could help them unseal the Holy Place so that they could solve the riddles, which was of the greatest importance to the Ancient God Clan.

“Elder Yi, you want me to break the Seal of the Holy Place?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Right.” Elder Yi nodded. “But you’ve just awakened your bloodline, so you’re too weak to break the seal. You need some time to grow up. When you become a Two-star Ancient God, you might be able to succeed.”
