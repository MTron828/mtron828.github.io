Chapter 670: Jian Wushuang’s Swordsmanship

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The masters in the hall all knew very well about the Puppet Fighters’ power. Therefore, based on their disciple’s strength, they knew how far they could go.

In their eyes, Luo Yong and Dong’er could definitely break through the 24th floor.

As for the others, they also had their judgments on them.

“Palace Master Destruction, your personal disciple Feng is brilliant. It seemed easy for him to make it to the 18th floor, so I reckon he will get to the 21st floor.”

The voice came from a black-clothed lady. She was Palace Master Ming Xin, one of the 13 Palace Masters in the sect and an expert in the Light Dao.

“Haha, this boy really surprised me with his progress. As things stand, he should be able to challenge those top disciples now. However, I still don’t think he can break through to the 21st floor. The 20th floor sounds more realistic.”

“Even so, he will still be able to keep his place among inner disciples,” Someone chimed in.

They could tell most of the 19 disciples would not even make it to the 20th floor, so for Feng to make it that far was already quite excellent.

“Hey, has anyone been paying attention to Jian Wushuang?” An icy voice suddenly echoed out. It came from Palace Master Mo Tao, who was good at Slaughter Dao and had once wanted to take Jian Wushuang as his personal disciple.

“Jian Wushuang?”

On hearing his words, the others immediately looked toward Jian Wushuang and narrowed their eyes.

Jian Wushuang was busy fighting the 10 Puppet Fighters on the 17th floor. One moment he moved like a shadow, but in the next moment he was like a sharp sword. Even under the attacks from his 10 opponents, he was still able to move easily dodge them all.

“Brilliant!”

“What great swordsmanship!”

“His skill is simple and pure. Every time he strikes, he defuses the Puppet Fighters attacks. With swordsmanship, it’s always the simpler, the better. Good boy, he’s quite talented to have such brilliant skills at such a young age and he is very close?to condensing his Sword Heart.”

“He deserves to be Xuan Yi’s nominal disciple.”

The masters all looked toward Xuan Yi unconsciously.

They all thought it was because of Xuan Yi’s guidance that Jian Wushuang was able to make such huge progress.

Xuan Yi revealed a causal smile to their way of praising his disciple. He knew very well that it was Jian Wushuang’s gift in Sword Principle, not him, that had benefited Jian Wushuang the most.

“This boy…”??Palace Master Ming Xin could not help frowning as she watched Jian Wushuang.

Back when Jian Wushuang refused to be a disciple of Palace Masters Baiyu and Mo Tao, his behavior had displeased many of the masters. Ming Xin was one of them.

In her eyes, Jian Wushuang was too proud and arrogant. She even had disparaged him while chatting with other masters. However, soon after that, to her surprise, Jian Wushuang comprehended the second sword scar left by Xuan Yi and became his nominal disciple, which had been a big blow to her.

After that, she began to dislike Jian Wushuang even more.

“Hump, he is only good at Sword Principle. However, there are so many other things that matter in Ninth Heaven Road other than Sword Principle. Judging by his current power, he might not be able to break through the 18th floor, and he has to make it to the 19th floor to keep his position as Xuan Yi’s nominal disciple,” Ming Xin said in a mocking tone.

The others in the hall smiled at her words but remained silent.

Xuan Yi, who was standing beside her, kept quiet regarding the discussion and just stared at Jian Wushuang with a smile.?“He is trying to find his limits in Sword Principle and take this chance to condense his Sword Heart. So, up til now, he has only used his cultivation in Sword Principle without applying World Dao and Slaughter Dao.

“However, condensing a Sword Heart is not easy.?

“After the 17th floor, he will have to use all of his power.”

On the 17th floor of the Ninth Heaven Road, when Jian Wushuang brandished his sword there was a flurry of blows, both smooth and elaborate. It seemed like he was battling the Puppet Fighters effortlessly and even trying to make fun of them, but only he knew that he was at his limit.

“Indeed, it’s quite difficult to condense my Sword Heart. I will have to wait until there is a better opportunity.”?Jian Wushuang smiled while looking around at all the Puppet Fighters, then his eyes became sharp.

“Master told me that the better I perform in this competition, the more resources he can obtain for me. From this moment on, I’ll stop restraining my power. I really want to see how far I can make it.”? Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The next moment, a sliver of light flashed in his eyes and he released a burst of killing intent.

Whoosh!

He moved forward like a ghost while striking out with his sword.

This move caused a dazzlingly stunning sword light to flash across the sky, which then swept past all the Puppet Fighters’ throats.

The 10 Puppet Fighters were defeated in an instant.

When he arrived on the 18th floor, he struck at his targets like lighting. This time, he used his World Energy.

The moment he struck out, everything seemed to freeze. The 10 Puppet Fighters on this floor were defeated without struggling.

The Puppet Fighters on the 19th floor suffered the same result.

In just a short amount of time, Jian Wushuang had made it to the 20th floor.
