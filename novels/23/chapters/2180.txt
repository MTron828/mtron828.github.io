Chapter 2181 Unstoppable!

Emperor Bai used his Nine Star Armour and reached the fighting power of a stage four great emperor.A stage four great emperor was equivalent to Chaotic Divine Demon Realm.

Emperor Bai cast Secret Skills of Star Palace and allowed his overall power level to increase tenfold. This meant that he was one of the stronger ones?among the Chaotic Divine Demon Realm.

This was the strongest that Emperor Bai could ever get.

The results… Emperor Bai was still suppressed in every way possible.

The battle powers of the two were not of the same level.

The Secret Skills of Star Palace could only last for ten seconds.

Emperor Bai could barely stop Blood Emperor within the then seconds. What would happen after ten seconds?

Many of the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World looked desperate and had no hope left.

Under the crazy suppression by Blood Emperor, the ten seconds were up!

Whoosh!

Once the time was up, the star power dissipated as his fighting power dropped significantly. The Blood Emperor used his spear and thrusted towards Emperor Bai. Emperor Bai could not stop the spear and was penetrated by it. A wave of divine power burst forth from the spear and strangled the divine body of Emperor Bai.

Within seconds, the divine body of Emperor Bai reformed almost instantly.

“I see. Both of you have the same techniques.” Blood Emperor laughed coldly, unsurprised.

Emperor Bai pulled away from Blood Emperor as he fell silent.

Jian Wushuang and the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World all fell silent.

Even after using the Secret Skills of Star Palace, Emperor Bai could not stop Blood Emperor.

Who else from the Eternal Chaotic World could stop him?

“Will the Eternal Chaotic World really be destroyed in the hands of the Blood Emperor?” Ancestor Tian Chen was shaking uncontrollably as he stared at Blood Emperor.

“Is there no other way?” Abysmal Saint Master laughed bitterly.

“We tried our best. Even the Sword Emperor and Emperor Bai used all they have. It is too bad that the Blood Emperor is far too strong.” The Underworld God shook his head.

All the experts were overcome with grief and desperation.

Jian Wushuang turned around and took a deep breath before he siad. “Everyone, let us use everything we have before we die.”

“Everything we have?” Ancestor Tian Chen and everyone else turned to look at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang said firmly, “Soul ignition, self-explosion, everything we have!”

Ancestor Tian Chen and the remaining experts were stunned.

Soul Ignition?

Self-explosion?

They would be sacrificing life for life.

“It does not matter if we die. At least the Eternal Chaotic World is still around and can continue to exist. If Blood Emperor does not die, then the Eternal Chaotic World will turn into the next Three Emperors World where everyone will die!”

Jian Wushuang continued word by word, “For the living things on the Eternal Chaotic World, for our home, we must kill Blood Emperor, no matter what it takes!”

Jian Wushuang turned crazy.

The experts from the Eternal Chaotic World clenched their fists upon hearing what Jian Wushuang said.

They were ready to give everything they had.

They had no choice and they could not back off!

Once they backed off, the Eternal Chaotic World would be destroyed and they would still eventually die.

“What, are all of you going to sacrifice everything you have and try to kill me?” Blood Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang and his friends with interest and smirked.

He could see what Jian Wushuang and his army planned on doing.

They would cast soul ignition and self-explosion to try and kill him as well.

The question was, would he care?

He was in the Chaotic Divine Demon Realm, and experts at this realm were?not as simple as Jian Wushuang thought.

No matter how many ordinary Chaotic Realms there were, it was almost impossible for them to threaten him.

“Haha. Come. Let me see all of you struggle even though there is no hope left.” The Blood Emperor smiled. He held his blood-red spear and took a step.

He walked forwards slowly.

Each of his steps placed pressure on the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World.

He liked to see the look of desperation on the faces of his enemies.

Blood Emperor got closer to Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang with each step.

Under the huge pressure, the look on the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World turned even crazier.

“Be prepared.” Jian Wushuang said coldly as his voice reverberated in the ears of every expert from the Eternal Chaotic World.

The experts from the Eternal Chaotic World were prepared to die.

They were prepared to sacrifice themselves by casting self-explosion and causing the most damage to Blood Emperor.

Right before the Blood Emperor was about to attack, he stopped in his tracks.

He halted and turned his head in other directions.

“Looks like an interesting guy is here.” Blood Emperor squinted his eyes as a glimpse or seriousness replaced the playfulness in his eyes.

Jian Wushuang and the others realised as they too looked in that direction.

A figure in the distance.

He was the size of an ordinary human.

He wore a clean, snow-white cloak. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

He had a cold and arrogant vibe as his tall figure stood tall in space.

He radiated no aura, just like a cloud of air. It did not feel like he belonged to this place at all.

However, this man had eyes that showed he could disregard everything to stand up to even heaven and earth.

He stood there motionless and quiet. However, it was like he was the focus of the universe.

Even after reaching the Chaotic Divine Demon Realm, Blood Emperor could not cover this man’s presence.

“He is…” The experts from the Eternal Chaotic World all stared at this figure who had just appeared.

“It’s him!” Abysmal Saint Master exclaimed as his eyes widened.

It was as though he was looking at the scariest man in the world.

Abysmal Saint Master felt fear like never before.

He could never forget this man, his eyes and his sword.

That man was his nightmare.

When Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang saw the man, they were excited.

This man who had just appeared, was Emperor Thirteen!
