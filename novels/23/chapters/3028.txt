——

The Magic Note King and the others left directly. Jian Wushuang also left immediately and went to the place where the remaining four people on the kill list were.

This was an ancient sect, which had existed for a long time. It had existed since the Magic Note Divine Kingdom was founded.

There were many experts in the sect, including more than ten Immortal Saints.

Buzz!

Jian Wushuang appeared in the void above the sect and looked down.

“According to the information given by the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, one of the four remaining experts is staying in the sect all year round.” Jian Wushuang moved and directly entered the sect, at the same time, his soul power unscrupulously swept out.

“Huh?”

Jian Wushuang frowned when he checked with his soul power. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

There were more than ten Immortal Saints in the sect. Normally, there should be at least seven or eight of them staying in the sect. However, in fact, Jian Wushuang only sensed the existence of five Immortal Saints, only one of them was a True Saint and had just made the breakthrough. The other four were only False Saints.

As for the person Jian Wushuang was looking for, he was not in the sect at all.

“Gone?”

Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Humph!”

A cold snort, like the wrath of the nine heavens, suddenly exploded in the sect. Many of the experts and disciples in the sect were instantly shocked.

Before long, the few Immortal Saints appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Who are you? May I know why you are here?” A white-haired elder asked with a humble expression.

“Let me ask you, where is the three-winged elder of the Dark God Sect?” Jian Wushuang asked directly.

“Three-winged elder?” The white-haired elder’s expression changed, and then he said, “Your Excellency, three-winged elder left the Dark God Sect not long ago. As for where he went, we don’t know.”

“He left?” Jian Wushuang’s expression was cold. He glanced at the experts of the sect, but he did not get angry. Instead, he turned around and left.

Soon, he was going to another territory. According to the information provided by the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, he was going to find the second person on the kill list.

When he arrived at the residence of the True Saint, the True Saint had also left.

“It’s okay for one person to suddenly leave his residence, but both of them left not long ago...” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold. He already understood why this had happened.

“Magic Note king, it seems that you want to force me!”

Jian Wushuang thought quickly and made a decision in his heart.

...

In a towering temple.

“Lord Wu, we just got the news that Heavenly Sword Marquis went to Heaven Lake Forest after leaving the Dark God Sect. However, the Heaven Lake Saint had already received our orders and left, so Heavenly Sword Marquis still failed,” an enchanting woman said with a wicked smile.

“Good.” Lord Wu also revealed a cold smile. “Heavenly Sword Marquis thinks he can do whatever he wants in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom just because he has some strength that the king can’t do anything to him. What a joke!”

“The Magic Note Divine Kingdom is our territory. Here, the king is the god. Even if the king can’t kill him, as long as the king doesn’t agree, he can’t kill the remaining four people on the kill list.”

Lord Wu was very confident.

The Magic Note Divine Kingdom was a great divine kingdom in endless territories. Not only was it powerful, but its influence was also extraordinary.

After knowing that he could not do anything to Jian Wushuang and that Jian Wushuang would continue to kill the other four True Saints, the Magic Note King activated his influence to investigate the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and easily found out the contents of Jian Wushuang’s mission, at the same time, he also knew the people on Jian Wushuang’s kill list.

Therefore, the Magic Note King immediately ordered the remaining four to leave their residence and find a place to hide.

If these four True Saints really wanted to hide, Jian Wushuang would not be able to find them.

“Let’s find them. Let Heavenly Sword Marquis find them by himself. We don’t need to care about him.” Lord Wu sneered.

However, just as Lord Wu was feeling proud...

“Palace Master, something bad has happened!” A message suddenly came.

The person who had sent this message was a rank two True Saint under his command.

“What’s wrong?” Lord Wu immediately asked.

“It’s Heavenly Sword Marquis. He’s killed his way to the Heaven Magus Palace,” the rank two True Saint said anxiously.

“What did you say?” Lord Wu’s expression changed drastically.

The Heaven Magus Palace was a large-scale sect under the Magic Note Divine Kingdom.

And most importantly, the Palace Master of the Heaven Magus Palace was Lord Wu himself.

“How could it be? There is no one on his kill list in the Heaven Magus Palace. How could he kill his way to the Heaven Magus Palace?” Lord Wu shouted with a trace of fear in his eyes.

There were many experts in the Heaven Magus Palace.

But these experts would not have any room to fight against Jian Wushuang.

If Jian Wushuang wanted to, he could kill all the experts in the Heaven Magus Palace alone.

“Palace Master, Heavenly Sword Marquis did come and kill us three True Saints. He also left a message. This is just a lesson. In three months, he will kill the last four people on the list. If one of them escapes, he will kill ten more True Saints in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom!”

“If all four escape, he will kill all the Immortal Saints in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom!” The rank two True Saint said with fear.

Hearing this, Lord Wu was immediately shocked and angry.

However, besides being shocked and angry, there was more fear!

He thought that as long as the four people hid and Jian Wushuang could not find them, everything would be fine.

But now...it was obvious that Jian Wushuang was not a good person.

He was decisive in the killing. He did not need any reason and did not give you any chance.

As long as one of the last four people on the list escaped, he would have to use the lives of the ten True Saints of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom to make up for it.

If all four of them escaped, he would go on a killing spree!

“Madman, this fellow is a complete madman!” Lord Wu growled.

“Lord, Heavenly Sword Marquis is clearly forcing us to hand over those four people. If we hand them over, the majesty of the king will probably be instantly swept away. But if we don’t hand them over... Heavenly Sword Marquis doesn’t seem to be joking. Furthermore, he does indeed have the strength to slaughter many Immortal Saints.” The enchanting woman said solemnly.

“I know.” Lord Wu nodded slightly, and his expression was extremely unsightly. After a while, he stood up. “There’s no rush. I’ll go see the king and let him make the decision.”
