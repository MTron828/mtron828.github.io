4114 The Divine Body Expanded Rapidly

After the second volume, the third and the fourth volume…

In the Life Nirvana Pool, everyone was immersed in the transformation of their bodies and the development of their innate advantages.

Under normal circumstances, only by Rulering all six volumes of the life divine ability could their innate advantages be developed to more than 60%. However, when the life divine ability was combined with the green seawater in the Life Nirvana Pool…it was very easy to develop one’s innate advantage to 60% or even 70%.

After Jian Wushuang mastered the fourth volume of the Life Divine Power, his Divine Body finally underwent a greater transformation.

Rumble! Jian Wushuang’s Divine Body trembled crazily. At this moment, he was like a huge black hole that was devouring the endless green seawater around him with an incredible devouring power.

“Has my Divine Body finally begun to expand?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes had long opened, and his hands were tightly clenched. His eyes were emitting an unprecedented fierce light.

After staying in the Life Palace for 20 years, he had long learned that special life forms, especially those above the creation level, had a high chance of expanding their divine bodies as long as they developed more than 70 percent of their innate advantages.

Such an increase in Divine Body could make his Divine Body grow many times larger. With such a huge Divine Body, the divine power he could store would become even more vast and boundless.

For example, Flame Mountain, the Guardian Jian Wushuang had met when he first entered the Life Palace, had a huge and boundless Divine Body. It was 60,000 feet tall and 8,000 miles long. It was incredible.

Because of his enormous Divine Body, Flame Mountain was not afraid of Supreme-beings at all. Even Supreme-beings who stood at the peak of the universe and were invincible among Supreme-beings could not do anything to him, there was nothing they could do to him.

Such a vast and majestic Divine Body was the envy of countless cultivators.

However, Flame Mountain was only at the peak of the creation level, while Jian Wushuang was at the perfect life level.

In terms of potential, he was much greater than Flame Mountain. Even though he was a human cultivator in terms of size, it was not necessarily impossible for him to surpass Flame Mountain.

Now, Jian Wushuang had the opportunity to expand his Divine Body.

“The opportunity is right in front of me. Let’s see how much I can expand my Divine Body.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and crazily swallowed the endless green seawater around him.

The cyan sea water contained a unique power. After being swallowed by him, most of it was directly refined into his divine power. As he refined it, his Divine Body grew rapidly.

In the blink of an eye, it had grown to a height of 300 meters, but this was just the beginning.

Rumble! Jian Wushuang’s Divine Body shook violently. As the endless cyan sea water entered his body, his Divine Body grew rapidly like a giant standing up.

300 meters tall, 30,000 meters tall, and 30,000 meters tall!

It was still expanding crazily.

In the Life Nirvana Pool, there were 437 other special life forms besides Jian Wushuang.

They were also cultivating life divine power and trying to exploit their innate advantages.

However, at this moment, they could feel the vibration of the Life Nirvana Pool. Immediately, they all looked toward the source of the vibration.

“What’s that?”

“It’s so big. It must be hundreds of thousands of feet tall.”

“It’s a Divine Body. It’s said that it has developed 70% of its innate advantage and has a chance to expand its Divine Body. However, this Divine Body is too big.”

“The appearance of this Divine Body is Jian Wushuang!”

“It’s him? He’s a perfect life form. How could he develop 70% of his innate advantage so quickly?”

The Life Nirvana Pool was in a state of shock.

Many special life-forms who had also developed their innate advantages in the Life Nirvana Pool thought that Jian Wushuang was a perfect life-form when they entered the Life Nirvana Pool, it should be extremely difficult to develop their innate advantages.

However, it had only been a short time since they entered the Life Nirvana Pool, and Jian Wushuang had already developed 70% of his innate advantages. Moreover, his Divine Body had begun to grow rapidly.

“His Divine Body is still growing. It seems that he is already more than a hundred miles tall.”

The many special creatures in the pool of life were shocked.

Indeed, Jian Wushuang’s Divine Body was still growing rapidly, and now it was more than a hundred miles tall.

At this point, Jian Wushuang gradually felt the pain coming from his Divine Body. As his Divine Body continued to grow rapidly, the pain gradually increased.

“Sure enough, when my Divine Body expands to a certain extent, there is a risk of collapse. The pain I’m feeling has just begun, which means that I haven’t reached the limit of collapse yet. I can still continue to improve.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

It was like eating too much, and one’s stomach would burst.

Jian Wushuang was a perfect life. He had developed his innate advantage to more than 70%. He could indeed increase his Divine Body to a whole new level by devouring divine power, but the increase was not endless, there was still a limit. What Jian Wushuang needed to do now was to find that limit, but he had to hold on for as long as possible so that his Divine Body could expand to the maximum.

The pain from his Divine Body alone could be ignored by him. Obviously, he was still far from reaching the limit of his Divine Body.

Jian Wushuang continued to crazily devour the endless green seawater around him. As his Divine Body grew larger, the devouring power became more and more terrifying. Before long, his Divine Body was more than 3,000 miles tall.

At this moment, he stood in the middle of the Life Nirvana Pool. He was like a giant, and his every move was enough to cause the entire Life Nirvana Pool to move.

As his Divine Body grew to such an extent, the speed at which he absorbed the green seawater around him became faster and more astonishing.

The entire Life Nirvana Pool was crazily swirling under his devouring. Endless seawater surged toward him from all directions. He had completely become the absolute core of the Life Nirvana Pool.

As for the other special creatures in the pool, they could only protect the green seawater around them and use it to transform their bodies.

“He’s over 3,000 miles tall, but he’s still growing!”

“A Divine Body that’s 3,000 miles tall, my God!”

“I remember that protector Flame Mountain, whom we met when we first entered the Life Palace, is only 6,000 miles long. Is it possible that Jian Wushuang’s size can surpass Flame Mountain’s?”
