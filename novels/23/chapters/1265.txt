Chapter 1266: A New Mission!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“I killed a Universe God?” Jian Wushuang shook his head and continued with a smile, “No, that elder has just passed the God Test and has yet to transform all his powers; His skills are very common, so he is not much stronger than the Invincible Universe Masters.”

“But still, he is more powerful than us and yet you managed to kill him!” Lin Dong’s eyes were wide open, staring at him in amazement.

“I had some chances to gain a stronger power than the ordinary Universe Masters, so my skills are better than his. With a bit of luck, I managed to kill him.” Jian Wushuang answered.

After hearing that, Lin Dong and Mo You began looking at Jian Wushuang in a different way.

Especially Lin Dong.

He had taken Jian Wushuang to be a weakling, since he knew that Jian Wushuang had just left his hometown and was a new arrival to this region.

Even when Jian Wushuang managed to kill Universe Master Bei, who was a powerful Invincible Universe Master, he still thought that Jian Wushuang’s power was only average. He regarded himself as more powerful than Jian Wushuang, who, however, had now killed a Universe God!

Despite that the elder was weaker than other Universe Gods, he was still a Universe God.

“We have flushed out all the enemies in the last city and killed Young Master Gu Nan; Our mission is complete. It’s time to go back.” Jian Wushuang changed the topic with a smile.

“Yes, it’s time to go back.”

“We finally finished this boring task.”

Both Lin Dong and Mo You had smiles on their faces.

After wiping out all the remaining experts of Red Water Alliance in the city, the three Divine Generals led the Seventh Army back to their camp.

After their return, the three went to meet their commander.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Lin Dong suddenly called Jian Wushuang’s name and said, “Many sergeants have witnessed our performance during the mission, therefore, I have to report everything that has happened to the commander, including your killing of Universe Master Bei and that elder. You’d better be prepared in case the commander will question you about that.”

“Understood, thanks.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He also knew that it was impossible for him to keep the happenings during the mission, a secret from Commander Man Yi.

Soon, the three entered the palace and met with Commander Man Yi. Lin Dong simply reported everything that had happened during the mission to him.

When he heard the report, the commander, who was sitting on a throne, looked toward Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, you killed a Universe God by yourself?”

The commander ignored the fact that Jian Wushuang had also killed Universe Master Bei.

“Yes, I did.” Jian Wushuang gave a slight nod.

“You two can leave now.” The commander waved his hand at Lin Dong and Mo You while giving the order.

“Yes.” Lin Dong and Mo You nodded respectfully at the commander. When they left, they could not help glancing at Jian Wushuang.

Soon, there were only Jian Wushuang and the commander in the palace.

The commander sat on the throne, towering above him like a brown bear, his eyes fixed intently on Jian Wushuang.

“As a Universe God, even though that elder had not completely transformed his power into Divine Power, a Universe Master would still not be his match. However, you managed to kill him. You really surprised me, Jian Wushuang.” The commander praised him.

“Commander, I am…” Jian Wushuang could barely finish his speech when the commander interrupted him.

“Don’t tell me you were just lucky.” the commander said while waving his hand, If with a bit of luck, a Universe Master can kill a Universe God, all the Universe Gods in the Dayu Region whould have been killed a time long ago. There must be some reasons behind your killing him, but, don’t worry, everyone has their secrets. I won’t dig deeper into this matter. After all, the more powerful you are, the more it will benefit us.”

Jian Wushuang was speechless.

“For my next question, you must answer me truthfully,” the commander suddenly continued.

“Of course, I will,” Jian Wushuang replied humbly.

“Since you have killed a Universe God who has just passed the God Test, you should be as powerful as the normal Universe Gods in the First Heaven. If I tell you to go and battle a real Universe God in that realm, are you confident enough to defeat him?” the commander asked.

“Battle a Universe God in the First Heaven?”?Jian Wushuang frowned and asked, “There are several kinds of Universe Gods. What kind of Universe Gods are you referring to, commander?”

“An elementary one in the First Heaven.” the commander answered casually.

“Yes, I am” Jian Wushuang replied.

“You’re so confident.” The commander shot an amazed glance at Jian Wushuang before he continued,” “What if it is an advanced Universe God in the First Heaven?”

“I can give it a try.” Jian Wushuang answered.

“Haha, that’s great.” The commander laughed and said, “Jian Wushuang, I asked you this because I need a Universe God to deal with an urgent matter for me now.”

“Are you referring to that matter, commander?” Jian Wushuang furrowed his eyebrows.

“Yes,” The commander nodded and started to explain. “The thing is that on the vast Nine Star Sea, our frontier area, there are always battles between us and the Golden-sun Sect, Holy Prefecture and other forces. You know, for benefits.

“Not long ago, we, together with the Xiu kingdom, found an island on the Nine Star Sea, where the Leopard-print Gem Mine was buried in it. We fought fiercely for it. At last, we won the battle and took over the island.

“Although the island is under our control now, Xiu kingdom will not give up trying to seize it back. Therefore, Universe God Qian Luan sent me a message to place another person to guard the island with her, until all the gems are extracted.”

“So, is that what the matter is all about?” Jian Wushuang finally confirmed what the matter was about.

He knew that the Xiu kingdom was as powerful as what Red Water Alliance used to be.

With Holy Prefecture’s support, the kingdom was not afraid of offending Scarlet Island. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Universe God Qian Luan wants someone there to help her, but the other Universe Gods on the Nine Star Sea have their own affairs to attend to and it will be too late if I dispatch a Universe God there from our headquarters.

“Before considering sending you there, I had planned to send the first Divine General there. Although he would not be a match for a Universe God, he can defeat some of the weaker ones. Now, it seems that you are obviously more suited for this mission than he!” the commander stated.
