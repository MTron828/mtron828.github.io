2069 Invitation!

“That is King Zhan Cang, leader of the Zhan Clan!”

Blood drained from King Gu You and King Gu Tong’s face.

Gu Tong King wanted to slap himself hard.

He had just asked whether Jian Wushuang could go head to head with a Nine-star Ancient God, and one had appeared.

“Zhan Clan?” Jian Wushuang thought as he frowned. He asked, “Within the Ancient God Clan, isn’t there only King Luo Yu and King Chen Xing who are Nine-star Ancient Gods?”

“There was indeed only two Nine-star Ancient Gods. However, not too long ago, a new ancient battlefield appeared near your home town. Many of the Ancient Gods went there to search for opportunities. They managed to gain some rewards.”

“King Zhan Cang reaped the greatest benefits. He managed to use the opportunities within the ancient battlefield and became a Nine-star Ancient God,” King Gu You said.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“King Zhan Cang and the Zhan Clan were always obeying King Chen Xing and listening to his orders. The Ancient God Clan sides with King Luo Yu while we support you. On the other hand, King Chen Xing opposes this idea firmly.”

“King Zhan Cang probably got news that Sword Emperor came to Ancient God Sanctuary and came especially for you. His intentions are bad.”

“He has bad intentions?” Jian Wushuang smiled lightly.

What could a Nine-star Ancient God that was just promoted due to opportunity do even if his intentions were bad?

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Ten Ancient God experts, together with their leader King Zhan Cang, appeared in front of the trio.

King Zhan Cang, who was the size of a gorilla, first scanned King Gu You and King Gu Tong before looking at Jian Wushuang.

“Are you the Sword Emperor?” King Zhan Cang asked coldly.

“Yes I am.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“I am Zhan Cang. If you want to inherit the place of the Ancient God Emperor, follow me so that we can discuss this matter.” King Zhan Cang said.

King Gu You and King Gu Tong panicked.

“King Zhan Cang! If King Chen Xing really wanted King Zhan Cang to inherit the throne of the Ancient God Emperor, he wouldn’t be fighting so fiercely against King Luo Yu, nor would he send you here to invite Sword Emperor. He would have come personally!” King Gu Tong shouted.

“Keep quiet!” King Zhan Cang scolded as he glanced at King Gu Tong. “You are just a mere Eight-star Ancient Emperor. You have no place to speak.”

King Gu Tong was stunned. He had no choice but to tolerate it even though he was upset.

An Eight-star Ancient God should always respect a Nine-star Ancient God.

“Sword Emperor, follow me,” King Zhan Cang said once again.

“What if I refuse?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Refuse? Haha. Do you think you have the right to refuse when I invite you personally? Be logical, or I will take action,” King Zhan Cang threatened.

“Take action? I really want to know what you will do.”Jian Wushuang grinned as he took a step.

Even though his step looked casual, it closed the distance between him and King Zhan Cang instantly as he appeared in front of King Zhan Cang.

A wave of strong diving power and bloodline power which was many times purer than that of a royal Ancient God swept out in all directions at that instant.

Jian Wushuang raised his right hand and pointed his index finger towards King Zhan Cang!

Once the finger was extended, heaven and earth turned silent. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Boom!

Emerging in the void behind Jian Wushuang was a black, shiny mirage of an Ancient god that was tens of thousands of feet tall.

This gargantuan mirage also pointed out its finger.

This finger was the Ancient God’s Ninth Finger!

This was the last move under the Ancient God’s Finger.

The name: Ultimate Finger!

“You are asking for it!”

King Zhan Cang was enraged when Jian Wushuang attacked him without saying a word.

His Ancient God body, which was as large as an orangutan, expanded in size rapidly. Endless waves of Ancient God power gushed out furiously.

Hum~~~ A humongous mirage of an Ancient God appeared behind him. It also attacked with the same technique.

Ancient God’s ninth finger.

The only difference was that his Ancient God mirage was dark gold, which was a telltale sign that he was a member of royalty.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang’s mirage was dark green.

Bang!

The two fingers collided head-on.

Two waves of shocking power erupted and burst forth in all directions.

King Zhan Cang was confident in his own power. He was a Nine-star Ancient God, one of only three within the Ancient God Clan.

However, Jian Wushuang was just an Eight-star Ancient God.

The difference in power level was still evident even if Jian Wushuang had bloodline power, which was purer, that could suppress his fighting power.

Since the move was the same, he was absolutely confident in destroying Jian Wushuang’s Ultimate Finger.

However, his confidence shook the moment the two fingers collided.

The air howled as the endless Ancient God power dispersed in all directions. His dark gold Ultimate Finger fell apart and exploded.

It couldn’t even put up a fight to stop Jian Wushuang’s ultimate finger. The moment it collided, it disappeared.

Even though the difference in power level was evident, the ending was unexpected.

“How is this possible?”

King Zhan Cang widened his eyes. Jian Wushuang’s ultimate finger came upon him. He had no time to react as he was still stunned.

Boom!

The enormous ultimate finger smashed into King Zhan Cang. It shoved King Zhan Cang towards the ground ruthlessly and effortlessly. It was as though he was a mere fly.

Crash!

The entire earth shook. A crater so deep that on one could see what was at the bottom formed.

King Zhan Cang was completely buried at the bottom of the crater. There was no movement even after a while, so no one knew what his condition was.

After doing all of this, Jian Wushuang patted his own sleeves as the huge mirage of the Ancient God disintegrated into nothingness. However, the aura of his bloodline, which was purer than that of a royal Ancient Emperor, still swept out in all directions.

He looked down on the crater that King Zhan Cang was in and smiled in disdain.

“He was simply a Nine-star Ancient God who got promoted recently. How dare he tell me that he will take action if I refuse his offer. What an idiot.”

A Nine-star Ancient Emperor was just equivalent to a normal great emperor back in the Human Territory.

A Nine-star Ancient Emperor who had just been promoted was equivalent to the most normal stage-one great emperor.

He could fight thirteen of such great emperors alone back when he was in Three-Emperors World!!
