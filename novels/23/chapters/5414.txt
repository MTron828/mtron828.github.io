5414 ¬†Battling a Tier 5 Emperor

Suppress!

Kill?

No, Jian Wushuang shook his head. Suppression was even less viable. Swordsmanship required sharpness, and suppression seemed too subtle. Why suppress when you could annihilate? Suppress!!!

Jian Wushuang emerged directly from the earth, standing beside Bai Junwang, staring at the tier 4 peak-level Emperor in the sky, revealing a hint of a smile.

Before he could speak, a group of people appeared in the sea behind him, led by an ordinary tier 5 Emperor.

Much weaker than Kun Tai, it seemed like a pauper without even an Eternal Treasure.

Among the same tier, this kind of tier 5 Emperor was quite embarrassing.

The Four Great Secret Realms were rich in resources, and ending up like this either meant just breaking through or being unwilling to take risks.

Even if unwilling to take risks, like Kun Tai, serving others could earn you an eternal treasure in a few years!

Unwilling to take risks and unwilling to serve others.

Still wanting to become stronger, then only miracles could help.

Don't say it, today really turned out to be a miracle.

Mo Qian!

When he heard the rumors, he was overjoyed and rushed over with people, an unstoppable momentum.

But when he saw Jian Wushuang and Bai Junwang, he froze.

Wasn't it said that there were only a few tier 4 peaks?

Why couldn't he gauge the strength of these two?

For a moment, countless thoughts raced through his mind, comparing appearances, and the conclusion was certain.

The first to notice Bai Junwang, that young Emperor pointed at the two below and shouted madly, "Senior Mo, I told you there would be people here!"

He looked disdainfully at the others.

This time, he'd take credit for it.

But before he could be happy, Mo Qian slapped him directly, leaving the young Emperor dumbfounded.

Mo Qian wore a face of feigned regret, flicked his sleeves, and then revealed a smile. He looked at Bai Junwang and apologized, "My own nephew lacks manners. I hope Dao Friend can forgive this."

His expression changed faster than flipping a book, and though the onlookers were surprised, they understood.

If even Mo Qian couldn't discern the opponent's strength, these people certainly couldn't either. Not to mention capturing the opponent, they might not even be a match.

The most prudent approach now was to transmit the entire situation. Mo Qian had a communication godstone on him, and the moment he discovered it, the information was transmitted to the lord of Gui Ling Island.

A trillion was secured, but the crucial part was apprehending the opponent. It seemed there was no chance now; the opponent's strength was beyond their understanding, far surpassing Mo Qian.

The youth who had been struck was a bit dazed. When he tried to speak, the Emperor behind him swiftly and deftly slapped him on the head, instantly rendering him unconscious.

Jian Wushuang turned to look at Bai Junwang, and both of them were puzzled. These people were clearly hiding something, and it seemed related to them.

"Move!"

Boom!

Jian Wushuang burst forth, his sword slashing through the dense dark clouds in the sky.

In an instant, he killed a tier 4 Emperor. His Sword Dao had grown stronger.

Bai Junwang had recovered his strength well; with a casual press of his hand, he froze everyone in mid-air, watching as Jian Wushuang slaughtered these people.

The youth who had been knocked out was thrown by Jian Wushuang next to Bai Junwang. "We'll keep this ugy alive!"

These tier 4 Emperors were too weak, and Jian Wushuang couldn't be bothered to engage them.

He killed them all, leaving only Mo Qian, the tier 5 Emperor, who now seemed on the verge of kneeling down.

Reluctance to take risks stems from cherishing one's life, unwillingness to be a dog reflects the refusal to abandon dignity.

Compared to dignity, the weight of life is heavier, or else one wouldn't hesitate to take risks.

"Forgive me, Fellow Daoist! I'll tell you everything I know!" Mo Qian knelt down, his eyes filled with fear as he looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang frowned as he observed, unsure how this person had cultivated into a tier 5 Emperor.

Upon further contemplation, perhaps the individual had once been a passionate and fervent cultivator, but after reaching Emperor rank, they struggled to break through and gradually fell into decadence.

Being too attached to life is not good.

For cultivators aspiring for strength, the first thing to relinquish is one's own life.

Jian Wushuang also values his life greatly, but in critical moments, he dares to fight.

All of this is not obtained without a struggle.

In the past, with the Extreme Dao, he almost couldn't return.

Even after successfully refining his physical body nine times through the Nine Refinements, when he condensed it for the tenth time, he nearly perished.

Without risking everything, there is no strength; without strength, there is no dignity. ƒêiscover nùíÜw chaptùíÜrs ùíên n0ùíóe(l)biùíè(.)com

The order must be understood correctly.

Clearly, this tier 5 Emperor has forgotten his past pursuits.

"Stand up!" Jian Wushuang angrily ordered, unable to tolerate others wasting their lives.

Especially cultivators who fear death and cling to life are particularly detestable.

After being scolded, Mo Qian glanced at Bai Junwang.

With just one look, he recognized that Bai Junwang was the true powerhouse in his eyes, the only one deserving of such a title.

Although Jian Wushuang now threatened his life, everything felt contingent on Bai Junwang.

As long as Bai Junwang nodded, Mo Qian believed he could survive.

"You don't get up, I'll kill you right now. Stand up, face me in battle. Win, and you can leave. Lose, and leave your life behind!"

Jian Wushuang held a simple and ancient longsword, staring deeply at the opponent.

A tier 5 Emperor, an ordinary one at that.

Nothing too powerful in terms of treasures; this was a good whetstone to test his Sword Dao.

However, Mo Qian was overly cautious and still unwilling to get up.

Jian Wushuang coldly said, "Don't make a move!"

Prompting Bai Junwang to rein in his methods.

Upon hearing this, Mo Qian was momentarily stunned. A tier 4 Emperor could actually command someone who seemed to be a tier 6 Emperor.

A tier 6 Emperor, in his eyes, was already at the peak, untouchable and not threatened by anyone.

There was no need to serve anyone; he himself was a major force and didn't need to care about anyone's opinions.

Shakily getting to his feet, Mo Qian's voice was hoarse as he asked, "How can you guarantee sparing my life?"

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang couldn't help but laugh.

"Do you have such confidence in defeating me?" Jian Wushuang stared at the opponent.

Mo Qian moved his body slightly, and when he looked at Jian Wushuang, there was not much fear in his eyes.

Based on Jian Wushuang's recent display, Mo Qian guessed that he was only a tier 4 powerhouse, not even a tier 5 Emperor.

How could he lose?

Indeed, Jian Wushuang didn't have the power of a tier 5 Emperor, but at the moment, he was not much inferior to a tier 5 Emperor. He had even tricked the tier 5 Emperor Kun Tai.

Dealing with a cowardly tier 5 ordinary Emperor wasn't challenging at all.

Mo Qian didn't harbor hatred towards Bai Junwang, only awe.

However, he harbored resentment towards Jian Wushuang. A tier 4 Emperor dared to act like this, not because of his own strength but because there was a powerhouse supporting him from behind.

Yet, he dared not voice these thoughts.

"Well... you must make an oath!"

Jian Wushuang directly slashed with his sword and angrily scolded, "You think you're worthy of asking to make an oath? Today, regardless of your victory or defeat, you must die!"

This person was beyond redemption, and Jian Wushuang didn't consider him human anymore. He acted directly.

Upon hearing this, despair filled Mo Qian's eyes.

"You shameless brat! If it weren't for the protection of my family, I could easily kill you with a wave of my hand!"

However, when Mo Qian made a move, he realized that killing Jian Wushuang was indeed somewhat difficult.

Boom!
