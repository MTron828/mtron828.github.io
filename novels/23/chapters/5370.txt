Chapter 5369 - 5369: The Price of the Boundless Ice Corpse

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The divine body, though surpassing the ice corpse, had a method to extract the Boundless Divine Body essence from within that corpse, elevating it and aligning it with itself before merging the two.

The cost was steep, a minimum investment in the billions, but spending such a sum guaranteed the dual cultivation of the divine essence at the core, a lucrative deal that was foolproof.

As a tier 5 Emperor, traversing any ancient relic within the earthly domains was routine, each venture yielding hundreds of millions. Over countless epochs, fortunes accumulated, and even for the ancient beings who had lived countless years with significant daily expenses, their net worth was substantial.

Take Xuanyuan Dapan, for instance, who casually destroyed treasures worth billions of divine stones, lost another 8 billion, totaling a staggering 10 billion, yet remained unfazed, the only regret being the inability to find the assailant. For these individuals, godstones were inconsequential; bolstering strength was paramount.

“3 billion!” declared the mysterious Emperor, uninterested in playful banter with the unmatched swordsman, instantly elevating the bid by a billion.

“5 billion!”

“6 billion!”

“Hmph!’

A muffled sound echoed from above, followed by a surge of formidable momentum. Then, a domineering voice resonated, “10 billion!”

The imposing aura barely dispersed when it was effortlessly dissipated by Nalan Ci.

This was an auction house, and many lesser Emperors were present, unable to withstand the fury of a tier 6 Emperor. It served as a warning, a reminder to those with discernment not to bid when a tier 6 Emperor intervened.

It wasn’t about overpowering others but making it clear to everyone that the financial prowess of a tier 6 Emperor was beyond their comparison.

A tier 6 Emperor could venture into the most perilous relics.

In the heart of the Forest of Eternal Secrets, even the Spirit of Grass and Wood could fetch several billions. The abundance of these spirits in the forest was beyond imagination.

If it weren’t sealed off, entering it would be a piece of cake for a tier 6 Emperor, and they could effortlessly obtain treasures worth tens billions of

godstones in just one visit.

“10.8 billion!” The mysterious Emperor in the hall persisted, unwilling to give up.

One final attempt.

Jian Wushuangs eyes narrowed, his heart pounding.

This time, he truly let go.

Surprisingly, it sold for 10 billion.

And there were still people willing to bid higher.

Originally estimated to sell for at most several tens of billions, Jian Wushuang never expected it to reach hundreds of billions.

Nonchalantly, Bai Junwang reminded, “Don’t be too surprised. When you possess wealth beyond measure, encountering something you like, be it a 1 billion or 10 billion, it doesn’t matter.’

“Beyond measure?” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

He had once reached that level in the mundane world of his hometown. When wealth became limitless, the things one liked became scarce, and the person underwent a transformation. Pursuits faded away, and cultivators had to be endlessly ambitious. Once they stopped, they would fall into neglect.

Only constant breakthroughs, continuous strengthening, embodied the true path.

The outcome was inconsequential; the journey was what truly shook the soul.

In the VIP hall, the ancestor of the sect shook his head, choosing not to instruct his attendants to continue bidding.

Now, only the tier 6 Emperor remained.

“20 billion!” The domineering voice echoed once more.

The mysterious Emperor in the hall gave up entirely.

Jian Wushuang was eager to bid again, perhaps that tier 6 Emperor might have shouted up to 100 billion.

He was the seller, unable to call out prices – that was the rule. Once an item was listed, there was no redemption.

In the end, the Boundless Ice Corpse fell into the hands of the tier 6 Emperor, and the auction continued.

In less than 15 minutes, someone brought over a mustard seed containing 20 billion god stones.

After a brief exploration, a trace of telekinesis penetrated the mustard seed, revealing two massive jet-black godstones, their eyes gleaming.

“Remarkably, they’re conjoined!” Jian Wushuang was somewhat surprised.

The godstones he had seen before were all less than three inches in length and width.

Bai Junwang explained, “That tier 6 Emperor must have used a treasure to mortgage 20 billion godstones. Except for some tier 6 Emperors from family sects, they generally won’t carry too many divine stones. For them, godstones are insignificant; even if they obtain a massive amount, they’ll quickly spend it on treasures like Emperor- grade pills or treasures that restore their origin source. Those are the real hard currencies. As for these godstones, they are condensed by powerful beings, and they can’t be bothered to divide them. I estimate that the Heavenly Court has stored quite a few.”

Jian Wushuang saw godstones as a whole for the first time, and the power they contained was quite terrifying.

About 100 godstones made up roughly one side, and this godstone worth 10-billion had countless sides.

His value soared once again, giving Jian Wushuang the confidence to seek a treasure suitable for him among the upcoming finale items.

Especially the Eternal Treasure.

The most ordinary Eternal Treasure should have a base price of around 10 billion.

With luck, it might actually be attainable.

After the exorbitant price of the Boundless Ice Corpse, the subsequent auctions surpassed 10 billion at times.

Especially a set of mature special life bones, already at the level of an Emperor, approximately 30,000-fold divine body.

It belonged to a powerhouse of tier 5 strength.

Its price even exceeded 50 billion.

Jian Wushuang looked at it with great envy. If he could devour this Special Life Form, breaking through 30,000-fold wouldn’t be an issue.

The key lies in the technique of grafting. As long as one obtains the body of this Special Life Form, they can transform themselves into a Special Life Form of Emperor-level strength.

This is even more powerful than the Ten Ancient Divine Bodies.

After all, it is an inherently Special Life Form.

Jian Wushuang had once, during his time in the Great Si Region, transformed himself. His divine body was equivalent to an ordinary Special Life Forms in the outside world.

It was still far from this cosmic-level special life.

Special Life Forms like Wanderer Chishui, born with a 10,000-fold divine body, are the truly formidable ones.

At birth, they possessd a 10,000-fold divine body. Subsequently, it will increase again based on their realm. After breaking through to the Emperor

level, there may be 30,000-told divine bodies.

Such Special Life Forms were born with the universe, and the strongest Special Life Forms in the Qishen Temple, probably don’t differ much.

The origin of the Qishen Temple is stronger than the universe, but it has flaws. Overall, it is similar to the Original Universe.

There are flaws in the origin source, but the Special Life Forms born from it are not much inferior.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

As the prices of treasures continue to soar, the auction is coming to an end.

“Dear friends, the highlight of this auction includes 100 treasures. The first 90 are not ranked in any particular order, but the strength of the last 10 treasures determines their ranking.” Nalan Ci casually explained. Most of the powerful individuals present had participated in many auctions and were familiar with the rules.

Many strong individuals remained calm. After all, they had lived through countless eras and had participated in many auctions like this.

Although Jian Wushuang had a broad understanding, he also felt that it was somewhat exaggerated.

The prices for the items earlier had already exceeded 50 billion. Now, with the 100 treasures being the highlight, the prices would undoubtedly be astronomical.

Especially for the last 10 treasures, they might even exceed 100 billion. It’s worth noting that the current cash that the Xuanyuan family can bring to participate in the auction is only 100 billion.

One shouldn’t exhaust the family’s resources just for one auction!
