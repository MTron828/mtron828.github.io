4618 Phoenix Clan

Jian Wushuang replied, “You don’t have to listen to my orders. We have the same enemy. The Dragon clan and the Divine Life Palace can be allies, and we will resist the Void Universe together.”

“An army without a general is like a dragon without a head.” Dragon Emperor Linhe shook his head and handed him a crystal-clear Heart-Protecting Scale. “This is my token. Keep it well. With this token, you can command the entire Dragon clan.”

Jian Wushuang no longer declined. After putting the token into his Interspatial Ring, he said, “Now that the Dragon clan has returned, it’s time for me to go back to the Offworld Battlefield and deploy my forces.”

Dragon Emperor Linhe nodded and said, “My young friend, as far as I know, the Phoenix clan has completely surrendered to the Void Universe. You must be on your guard.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang frowned and said, “The Phoenix clan surrendered. What about the Qilin clan?”

“The Qilin clan has been struggling ever since the Great Catastrophe War started. I’ve once sent descendants of the Dragon clan to help them, but they were all rejected,” Dragon Emperor Linhe said.

He took a deep breath and said in a deep voice, “It seems like I have to go to the Phoenix clan to meet them again.”

Linhe wanted to say something but hesitated. In the end, he spoke to Jian Wushuang with all his heart.

After walking out of the Dragon clan’s Forbidden Land, Jian Wushuang looked back from high up in the sky. In the end, he left the Wan Ye Star Field with Old Master.

Jian Wushuang heaved a long sigh of relief after learning about the ancient secret and the return of the Dragon clan.

With the Dragon clan’s full participation, the high-end battlefields could be pulled back almost instantly.

The Divine Power Universe was not the universe of the Divine Life Palace, but the universe of all the people and cultivators. Without the help of other forces, it would be difficult to support the universe alone.

After leaving Wan Ye Star Field, Jian Wushuang immediately headed to the Star Field where the Phoenix clan was.

Since the fall of the Divine Power Universe, the forces of the Void Universe had almost infiltrated more than half of it. From the Star-level to the Void Warriors, they had begun to seize it crazily. Countless Star Fields and Divine Countries had been destroyed, and at the same time, there were many Star Fields that had fought to the death or surrendered.

Two out of three ancient clans had surrendered. How could Jian Wushuang not be angry?

Crimson Sky Star Field.

It was one of the oldest super Star Fields in the Divine Power Universe. It was under the jurisdiction of the Phoenix clan. Rumors said that the Crimson Sky Star Field had tens of thousands of suns. Under the scorching sun, the Phoenix clan would undergo the Nirvana Inferno and reach the Supreme realm.

After traveling for more than half a year, Jian Wushuang finally arrived at the Crimson Sky Star Field.

Along the way, all the Star Fields were more or less occupied by the forces of the Void Universe, except for the Phoenix clan. It was similar to the Dragon clan, where not even a single Void Master was in sight.

As the main sect in the Crimson Sky Star Field, ten suns were hanging above the Star Field, emitting scorching flames.

Jian Wushuang did not feel uncomfortable at all. He pulled out the Tarot Divine Sword and destroyed the mountains and rivers within a million miles of the Crimson Sky just like he had destroyed the Dragon clan’s Wan Ye Star Field!

Several Phoenixes who had rushed over were all killed by the sword.

After taking care of the disciples of the Phoenix clan, Jian Wushuang strode into the Crimson Sky Star Field.

“Who dares to break into the Crimson Sky Forbidden Land?”

In the red sky illuminated by nearly a hundred suns, a Fire Phoenix with a wingspan of nearly a thousand feet covered the sky and the sun.

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and his hand on the hilt of the Tarot sword started to tighten.

However, the scene that he had imagined did not happen. The huge Fire Phoenix, carrying the power of the sun, circled above Jian Wushuang’s head for a while before transforming into a handsome young man and landing in front of him.

“Are you people from the Divine Life Palace?” the handsome young man looked at Jian Wushuang and said with uncertainty.

Jian Wushuang was slightly surprised, but he still nodded.

Hearing this, the handsome young man did not say much. He tilted his head and said, “Then come with me. Our Patriarch has been waiting for your Divine Life Palace for a long time.”

With that, the handsome young man turned back into a Fire Phoenix. The divine power of a Top Supreme expert soared into the sky and turned into a fiery red ribbon that swept into the distance.

Although the Divine Life Palace had always been a top force in the Divine Power Universe, it had not had much contact with the Dragon, Phoenix, and Qilin clans.

The Phoenix clan, which had surrendered to the Void Universe, did not mind that Jian Wushuang, the Palace Master of the Divine Life Palace, had destroyed the Star Field. Instead, it seemed that they had been waiting for the arrival of the Divine Life Palace, which made Jian Wushuang confused.

Without much speculation, Jian Wushuang and Old Master followed the traces left by the Fire Phoenix and plunged into the depths.

The further they went, the more suns there were in the sky. When they reached the depths, the entire sky was almost occupied by the suns. There were at least ten thousand of them.

Even with Jian Wushuang’s divine power, he felt that his throat was dry.

When they arrived at the deepest part of the Crimson Sky Star Field, a giant palace that was no smaller than the Dragon clan’s Forbidden Land appeared. At the same time, nearly 1,000 Phoenixes were standing on both sides of the palace, as if they were waiting for something.

When Jian Wushuang’s feet landed on the ground, he felt the scorching heat that could almost evaporate an ordinary Supreme. Jian Wushuang naturally looked at the figure of a Fire Phoenix, which was a thousand feet long, hovering in front of the giant hall.

Swish–

A long cry that pierced the clouds resounded, and the thousand-foot Fire Phoenix soared into the sky. A total of ten magnificent tail feathers left behind flowing lights and flames in the sky, which was extremely shocking.

With just one flap of its wings, the Phoenix was already in front of Jian Wushuang, and the flames flowing on its feathers almost sprayed on him.

However, Jian Wushuang did not panic at all. He just looked at it calmly.

Swish-

The magnificent flame feathers with flowing flames retreated, and an extremely pretty face appeared in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“I say, are you spacing out? Why didn’t you dodge? With your strength of a Half Invincible Supreme realm, aren’t you afraid that I’ll burn you to ashes?”

Although it was a gentle voice, it was full of heroic spirit.

Under that pretty face, the most fascinating thing was the extremely hot body half-covered by the flame feather coat.

“Wear your clothes properly, in case you catch a cold,” Jian Wushuang reminded her kindly. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The pretty girl was stunned, and then the divine power of fire suddenly rose. “Good, you fellow. I thought you were a fool, but I didn’t expect you to actually dare to tease me!”

Jian Wushuang did not want to waste time talking to her. He said directly, “Go find your Patriarch. I have something important to ask him.”

“What? Are you so shallow to think that I’m not the Ancestral Matriarch of the Phoenix clan?” the beautiful woman sneered and said.

Jian Wushuang was slightly stunned. He had never expected that the Patriarch of the Phoenix clan, one of the top ancient clans in the Divine Power Universe, would be such a young and beautiful woman.

“Another stupid guy who has been bewitched by beauty. Are all outsiders so shallow these days?” The beautiful woman sighed.

“Are you really the ancestral Matriarch of the Phoenix clan?”

“Naturally.”

Jian Wushuang sneered, “That’s good. I’ve been looking for you!”
