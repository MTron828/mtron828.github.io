This secret technique not only caused his divine body to increase 1,000-fold, but also transformed his Yan power into the power of reincarnation due to practicing the profound art of cycles.

This aura was tens of thousands of times stronger than Yan power.

Boom!

The silver staff clashed sharply against the solid defense, producing a deafening sound that was even more shocking than their previous battle.

This roar destabilized the world of frost and snow; even the ice crystal phoenix screamed to the heavens!

Jian Wushuang took advantage of the opportunity to create some distance. A slender phantom sword appeared in his palm, which he swung fiercely, aiming directly at the ice crystal phoenix.

Dao Lord Leng Shuangs brows furrowed. Indeed, although the ice crystal phoenix possessed the battle power of a Dao Lord, its intelligence was too low. Although she controlled it secretly, she couldn‚Äôt achieve complete mastery.

If she could control the ice crystal phoenix completely, that would be extraordinary. In the midst of the chaos, a Dao Lord suddenly became two Dao Lords, a double transformation in both quality and quantity.

The slender phantom sword made Dao Lord Leng Shuang feel uneasy. She sensed a terrifying aura from it and hurriedly recalled the ice crystal phoenix, but it was too late.Exppl√¥re ùíñptodùíÇte stories at no/ùíóel//bin(.)cùíêm

On the other side, Hu Qing became fiercer as the battle progressed, gradually overpowering PO Jun. PO Jun, who was originally focused on aggressive attacks, was forced into a defensive stance. His defenses proved ineffective against Hu Qings relentless assaults. When he finally took a blow, he staggered backward.

The blow landed on his waist and instantly reached his chest, causing his blood to surge. He sucked in a cold breath, suppressing the hot blood in his chest, but his divine body began to deteriorate due to the impact. He had no choice but to revert to his normal size to mitigate the damage.

Just one strike shattered his defenses, causing significant damage to his divine body.

A chill ran down his spine, and he broke out in a cold sweat.

‚ÄúHow can he be this strong?‚Äù

But before he could contemplate further, the long staff came at him again, just as fierce and ruthless as before. He had no choice but to go on the defensive once more.

One strike with the staff.

Two strikes, ten strikes, hundred strikes, thousand strikes, ten thousand strikes, a million strikes.

Each blow fiercer and mightier than the last.

PO Jun was on the brink of collapse, unable to parry anymore; he could only retreat!

On Jian Wushuangs side, the situation had also changed. As the illusory phantom sword struck, it ambushed the ice crystal phoenix, not only giving him a chance to catch his breath but also gaining the upper hand. Although he lacked the empowerment of the One Thought Universe, the Illusory Sword Technique was now incomparable to its past self.

With just one stroke, it severed the ice crystal phoenix, injuring it severely.

Despite the Dao Lord‚Äôs strength, the ice crystal phoenix‚Äôs defense was fragile. The sword shattered its icy defenses and pierced directly into its body.

Initially, Dao Lord Leng Shuang didn‚Äôt mind; the ice crystal phoenix was just a summoned creature. Even if it got ambushed and suffered some damage, it wouldn‚Äôt matter much.

But what she didn‚Äôt expect was that, after that single strike, the ice crystal phoenix began to lose the origin source contained within it.

This was the first time she encountered such a situation, and for a moment, she didn‚Äôt know how to respond. All she could do was desperately attack Jian Wushuang.

The Dao contained within the ice crystal phoenix was her Dao; they were originally one entity.

‚ÄúHaha, feeling the pain now, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù Jian Wushuangs figure moved like a ghost. As for the Dao Lords present, he didn‚Äôt even consider them when it came to escaping.

Sensing something amiss in the aura, Jian Wushuang instantly changed his tactics. He knew Dao Lord Leng Shuang was about to go all out. That was her origin source; years of effort were being devoured by him. Anyone in her position would fight desperately.

Jian Wushuang sensed the situation turning unfavorable. He twisted his aura and swiftly withdrew from the entire icy world, no longer engaging in a direct confrontation with Dao Lord Leng Shuang.

‚ÄúJian Wushuang!‚Äù Dao Lord Leng Shuang roared in frustration.

In the end, she had no choice but to forcibly retract the ice crystal phoenix, despite the risk of backlash. Yet, she had also incurred substantial damage to her origin source. The losses she suffered were comparable to the complete origin source of some peak-level Grand Yan Immortals.

Having succeeded, Jian Wushuang stood in the distance, his demeanor unwavering.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter? Want to continue the fight?‚Äù he taunted.

Facing Jian Wushuangs mockery, Dao Lord Leng Shuangs face turned deathly pale.

In a direct battle, Jian Wushuang was definitely not her match. However, that Illusory Sword Technique was too insidious. The evil aura it contained made her tremble.

But without the ice crystal phoenix, one on one, she truly had no way to deal with Jian Wushuang.

When the onlookers witnessed this, they were deeply shocked.

Simultaneously, they took mental notes of Jian Wushuang. Although his direct strength did not reach the level of a Dao Lord, his level of threat surpassed even that of a Dao Lord.

The fact that he could drive Dao Lord Leng Shuang to madness and even injure Dao Lords showed that he was not someone they could provoke.

‚ÄúIn the future, pay attention to Jian Wushuang. His true strength may not have reached the level of a Dao Lord yet, but his methods are extremely mysterious, posing a greater threat than a Dao Lord!‚Äù A half-step Dao Lord‚Äôs eyes revealed a sense of fear. This battle had given him a new understanding of Dao Lords.

If he were the one facing Dao Lord Leng Shuang and the ice crystal phoenix within the Frost Snow World, he would undoubtedly perish. Forget about breaking their formation; he wouldn‚Äôt even be able to resist.

Those were two Dao Lords‚Äô strengths!

He was not a match for either of them, let alone both attacking together.

‚ÄúLook, PO Jun can‚Äôt hold on much longer!‚Äô

Just as the crowd caught their breath after watching Jian Wushuang, they anxiously turned their attention back to Hu Qing and PO Jun.

Jian Wushuang played with the phantom sword in his hand from a distance, ignoring the injured Dao Lord Leng Shuang. He knew she was intelligent too. Neither of them could do anything to each other; continuing the fight was meaningless.

Although he could threaten Dao Lord Leng Shuang, it was only in a situation where he had the upper hand. If he were to initiate an attack, his Illusory Sword Technique would definitely clash with Dao Lord Leng Shuang, and she would also mobilize her full power.

Moreover, there was no real need for the two of them to fight to the death. Around them, two other Dao Lords watched attentively: Dao Lord Wan Xing, the most powerful among them, and Xue Yue, whose methods were the most ruthless. Neither of them had made a move yet.

If they fought to the death, it would benefit others.

However, if it came to a fight to the death, Jian Wushuang was confident. Once the One Thought Universe was formed, his strength would double. Combined with the Beast God‚Äôs Eye, his combat power would reach the level of a Dao Lord. With the aid of the Transcendent Immortal Formation, he could indeed hold Dao Lord Leng Shuang back.

Of course, all of this was under the assumption that there were no external interruptions. If Dao Lord Leng Shuang had more hidden cards or if other Dao Lords intervened, he wouldn‚Äôt have much confidence.

Now retracting the power of the Beast God‚Äôs Eye, his aura condensed as he began to observe the battle between Hu Qing and PO Jun.

Dao Lord Leng Shuang adjusted her aura to recover the Yan power she had consumed. As for the lost origin source, she couldn‚Äôt replenish it for a while. Fortunately, the loss was not too significant, so it didn‚Äôt greatly affect her strength.

In this battle, she gained no benefits; instead, Jian Wushuang trampled on her reputation, an affront she swore to settle with him sooner or later.

But thinking back to that devouring power, her pupils contracted. If it weren‚Äôt in the Qishen Temple, she would have definitely sought an Emperor for an explanation. That technique was too mysterious.

On the other side, even more mysterious than Jian Wushuang was Hu Qing!

The formidable power of Samsara made Dao Lord Wan Xing deeply moved.

Jian Wushuangs battle with Dao Lord Leng Shuang didn‚Äôt concern him at all; they were just some side characters. If he faced Dao Lord Leng Shuang and the ice crystal phoenix, they wouldn‚Äôt pose a threat to him at all. He was even confident that he could shatter the ice crystal phoenix with a single punch..
