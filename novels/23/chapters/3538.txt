Chapter 3539: Adventuring Alone

This time, Heavy Master and Purple Sound Master had come out to explore together. They had come out to find a way to get enough contribution points, and then they would exchange Heavy Master’s true treasure armor back. But now…the 10% share of this Poluo God component had almost all been returned.

As for the Saber Python Master, he was even happier.

He had received 20% of the share, which was 70 contribution points, which was a huge fortune for the Saber Python Master.

Of course, they could not compare with Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang alone could receive 70% of the share, which was 245 contribution points, which was more than two advanced universe supreme treasures.

“The Poluo God part is in my hands now, but I don’t have any contribution points. I can only give you the contribution points when I return to the Star Palace and go to the Supreme Treasure Vault to exchange for it. But the problem is that I just came out of the Star Palace and don’t want to go back immediately,” Jian Wushuang suddenly said.

“That’s okay. Purple Sound Master and I just came out of the Star Palace and didn’t expect to go back so soon. You can give us the contribution points later when you return to the Star Palace. What about you, Saber Python Master?” Heavy Master looked at Saber Python Master.

“I’ll return to Star Palace soon, but I’m not in a hurry for the contribution points. I can wait in Star Palace for a while, but how long do you plan to stay in Devil Smoke Valley?” Saber Python Master asked.

“I think I’ll stay in the outer area of Devil Smoke Valley for now. After a while, I’ll go to the core area of Devil Smoke Valley. I’ll definitely go back to Star Palace before entering the core area,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Blood Sword Master, are you going to explore the core area of Devil Smoke Valley?” Heavy Master looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise, but he immediately understood. “That’s right. With your strength, you can go there. However, there are many experts in the core area of Devil Smoke Valley, which is much more dangerous than the outer area. You have to be careful.”

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“In that case, I’ll go back to Star Palace and wait for one or two hundred years. When you return to Star Palace, you can send me a message, Blood Sword Master,” Saber Python Master said.

“No problem.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Since it’s a deal, let’s part ways again. Goodbye, both of you,” Heavy Master said and then left with Purple Sound Master.

Saber Python Master cupped his hands at Jian Wushuang and turned to leave.

Jian Wushuang stood in the void and looked around calmly.

“Devil Smoke Valley, one of the three battlefields, not only contains countless opportunities and precious treasures like the Poluo God parts, but also countless experts from the surrounding star worlds. Although the experts in the outer area are not as good as those in the core area, they are enough to practice swordsmanship.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“My goal in Devil Smoke Valley is to reach a very deep area, the special place that the Xue Bei Master discovered. However, there are too many unknowns and it’s too dangerous. Therefore, before venturing into that special place, ‘’I must improve my strength to the peak that I can temporarily reach. Naturally, I must improve my swordsmanship first.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands.

He already had a detailed plan in his heart.

He would stay in the outer area of Devil Smoke Valley first, not only to familiarize himself with the illusion in the battlefield, but also to hone his swordsmanship.

After he had completely improved his swordsmanship and reached a new level of strength, he would set off for the core area of Devil Smoke Valley until he went to the special land discovered by Xue Bei.

“Let’s begin.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and immediately flew to the side.

Half a day later, two figures were flying side by side in the void outside Devil Smoke Valley.

One of them was a white-haired skinny elder, and the other was a chubby bald youth. They walked together with a relaxed expression.

It was normal. After all, they were both Principles Masters in the fifth realm of the void and had extraordinary life-saving skills. If they worked together and did not encounter a madman like God Fei Master in the outer area of Devil Smoke Valley, or they were seeking death by intruding into dangerous places. Otherwise, no one would be able to threaten them.

However, halfway through, a figure suddenly blocked their way.

The person who stood in their way was Jian Wushuang.

“Who are you?” The white-haired skinny elder stared at Jian Wushuang coldly.

“Blood Sword,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“Blood Sword?” The white-haired skinny elder and the fat bald youth immediately recalled the information they had read about the experts, but they found that there was no Blood Sword Master.

“Blood Sword, you must be an expert who has just appeared, right?” The chubby bald young man smiled. “Do you know who we are?”

“Of course I do. Master Yun and the Chubby Master are from the ancient Yuan Star World. You two have always been famous in the Universe Battlefield,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“You know our names, but you still dare to stand in front of us. Boy, you have guts.” The chubby bald young master flipped his hand, took out a fruit, and took a bite, he looked at Jian Wushuang with interest.

“It’s because I know your names that I came here. If it were a weaker Principles Master, I wouldn’t be interested.” Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Let’s cut the crap. Let’s fight.”

“Tsk, tsk, it seems that you really don’t care about us.” The Chubby Master praised. He had casually thrown away the fruit in his hand.

“He knows their strength, but he still dares to come to us. He must have something to rely on. Fifth brother, don’t be careless. Let’s attack together.” Master Yun said.

“Okay.” The Chubby Master nodded.

The next moment, the two attacked at the same time.

Jian Wushuang immediately drew his Blood Mountain Sword and went up to meet them.

In an instant, a great battle broke out.

Jian Wushuang fought against two masters at the same time, relying on his swordsmanship to fight against Master Yun and the Chubby Master.

The battle was extremely fierce, but it did not last long.

Soon, Jian Wushuang chose to retreat.

“Thank you for your guidance. Goodbye.”

Jian Wushuang said goodbye and turned to leave. Master Yun and the Chubby Master had no intention of keeping Jian Wushuang.
