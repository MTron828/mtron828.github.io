Chapter 2545: Peak Divine Demon

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“One hundred sixty thousand Primordial Stones!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes instantly lit up.

He was only a step away from Peak Divine Demon and twenty to thirty thousand Primordial Stones should be sufficient for his breakthrough.

Not only was he able to make a breakthrough into Peak Divine Demon Realm with those 160,000 Primordial Stones but could also accumulate sufficient divine powers for his breakthrough into the Ultimate God Realm.

Jian Wushuang soon found a secret chamber and began refining those Primordial Stones.

His refinement speed may be terrifying, but refining all 160,000 Primordial Stones would still require quite some time.

It took him one month to refine the 90,000 Primordial Stones he received from the three prefectures in the Dark Thunder Territory.

He needed nearly two months to refine the 160,000 Primordial Stones.

In two months, Jian Wushuang had completely refined those 160,000 Primordial Stones and transformed them into his divine powers.

It was well within expectation for his breakthrough into the Peak Divine Demon realm on top of also gaining a lot of divine powers.

“I can almost fight with any average Peak Ultimate Gods before my breakthrough into Peak Divine Demon Realm, but now....”

Jian Wushuang tightly clasped his hands together and felt his elevated strength. “My strength isn’t much different from an average Peak Ultimate God once I completely unleash my divine powers. Combining my Space-time Law understanding and sword skills that aren’t any weaker than a Peak Ultimate God’s with several of my secret techniques, I can fight against the average Peak Ultimate Gods. I might even gain an easy win if I encounter weaker Peak Ultimate Gods!”

His strength had once again greatly increased with his progress from First-Class Divine Demon to Peak Divine Demon.

This was only from being a small cultivation realm advancement. His strength would drastically be uplifted if he made another breakthrough to the Ultimate God Realm.

He needed more Primordial Stones for that to happen.

“I have one hundred sixty thousand Primordial Stones, but only used nearly thirty thousand Primordial Stones for my Peak Divine Demon breakthrough before refining the remaining stones. However, I feel that my current divine power is far from a top-tier Peak Divine Demon. I’ll at least need four hundred thousand Primordial Stones to advance into the Ultimate God Realm. For contingency purposes, I’m afraid I’ll need more than five hundred thousand Primordial Stones!” Jian Wushuang smacked his tongue while calculating.

500,000 Primordial Stones was a lot.

He previously looted around 90,000 Primordial Stones when wiping out three of Dark Thunder Territory’s prefectures on top of bagging resources and treasures worth about 170,000 Primordial Stones, but that number was still a far cry from 500,000 Primordial Stones. He was halfway from his Primordial Stone target.

It would not be easy for him to acquire 500,000 Primordial Stones with many experts in the Northern Darkstar Continent.

“There are many clans in the Northern Darkstar Continent with each being extremely wealthy. I’m afraid they’re the only ones I could go after for such huge amounts of Primordial Stones.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

...

“Mr. Jian Yi, are you going after those clans?” Xiao Tiexin looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“Why not?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. He was more than qualified to find fault with those clans based on his current strength.

“It’s not impossible, but didn’t you mention you won’t do anything to those clans unless they come after you?” Xiao Tiexin asked suspiciously.

“I’m not going to kill anyone or go against them. I’m just finding ways to receive some Primordial Stones from them. I only needed a few ten thousand Primordial Stones from each clan. I’m sure that amount won’t even hurt them and they’ll probably accept it,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“Is that so?” Xiao Tiexin nodded slightly. “Don’t you need some sort of reasons or excuses when finding fault with those clans?”

“That’s true, but I think it’s rather easy to find an excuse.” Jian Wushuang smiled mischievously.

Inside a very large and seemingly higher-end tavern three days later...

Those who were able to enter and exit the tavern were not weaklings with many of them coming from decent backgrounds.

At the tavern’s entrance, a handsome young man in a white robe slowly walked into the tavern while being surrounded by many servants.

Several waiters in the tavern immediately greeted him upon his appearance while many people in the tavern concurrently stood up and greeted him.

“I haven’t seen you for a while, Master Ye Ming. How have you been?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Master Ye Ming, you manage to come over here amidst your busy schedule!”

“Can I have a drink with you, Master Ye Ming?”

The handsome white-robed young man showed a wicked smile upon listening to everyone’s voices greeting him before saying, “I’ve to go today, so I won’t be here with all of you. Put everything you order in the tavern on my tab.”

“Master Ye Ming is so generous.”

“He’s indeed a son of the Ye Clan.”

Sounds of compliments came from every corner of the tavern.

The handsome white-robed young man did not continue chatting with those people but walked straight to the tavern’s second floor instead.

In a corner of the tavern, a thin man stood respectfully beside where Jian Wushuang and Xiao Tiexin were seated.

“There’re many clans in the Northern Darkstar Continent with each of them being extremely wealthy and cultured. There’ll inevitably be a few dead ducks and troublemakers within such huge clans. Ye Ming is famous within the Ye Clan for acting on his whim and fancies because of his strong familial background. His father—a High-Level Ultimate God—is an Elder of the Ye Clan. Many people who are bullied by him choose to keep quiet,” said Xiao Tiexin.

“Let’s go for him then.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly before glancing at the thin man standing next to him. “I’ll leave it to you.”

“Sure, Master.”

The thin man knew what Jian Wushuang was going to do and immediately went toward the second floor of the tavern after Ye Ming.

Jian Wushuang and Xiao Tiexin remained seated and quietly drank their wine.

After a short while, a sudden crisp sound came from the tavern’s second floor with Ye Ming’s low voice echoed throughout the tavern.

“Idiot, where are your eyes? How dare you bump into me! Take him down and break his limbs and abolish his cultivation base.” Ye Ming was furious.

“No, stop! My master is mighty and just downstairs,” yelled the thin man.

“Your master? You’re a Third-Class Divine Demon. What kind of a master do you have? Your master should stay out of this. Otherwise, I’ll break his limbs too.

Ye Ming’s raging roar resounded throughout the tavern.
