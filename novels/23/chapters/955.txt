Chapter 956: Ten Percent Chance of Success

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“I’ve long heard of how wicked and cruel the members of the Blood Killing Sect can be but today I finally see it with my own eyes. I wonder if my current strength is enough to completely dismantle the Life-devouring Formation.”

Power burst forth from within Gu Tong’s pupils. The Ancient God Power began to frantically condense in his thick arm, giving rise to a frightening might. Even if the power had yet to break out entirely, it was enough to draw attention to him. Everyone looked at him in shock.

“Gu King Tong.” Dao Yuanzi who stood under the defensive cover also looked over at him, a cold glint in his eyes.

Gu Tong was the only one out of everyone here that he was truly concerned about, for the former was a Seven-star Imperial God at his peak. He was an existence that Dao Yuanzi must look up to. Even if Gu Tong had yet to recover 90 percent of his strength, he was not one to be underestimated.

Gu Tong had already made his move.

“Ancient God Secret Skill, one-finger extermination!”

He made a pointing motion with his dark golden arm, the terrifying Ancient God Power entirely condensed on the index finger on his right hand.

His index finger contained the ultimate power that Gu King Tong could currently summon.

It was also the strongest secret skill that Gu King Tong could currently unleash.

The world would instantly perish once he pointed with his index finger.

His terrifying power soon enveloped the defensive cover that shielded Dao Yuanzi.

“Come on! Come at me!” Dao Yuanzi also wore a crazed smile on his face but showed not even the slightest hint of fear.

“Bang!”

The entire sky collapsed and the vast empty space in its place filled itself with the battlefield. Gu Tong’s might was devastating.

Even so, Dao Yuanzi remained still in the center of this might. The defensive cover that enveloped him remained intact.

“It’s still intact?” Gu Tong frowned with a dark golden lightning flashing in his pupils.

“Haha! It’s useless!” Dao Yuanzai’s manic laughter echoed all around. “Gu King Tong, this Life-devouring Formation certainly won’t pose much of a problem had you been at your peak. However, you don’t even have 10 percent of your strength back then and you might not even be able to win the Master of Void Temple. You wish to shatter my defensive cover with your current power? What a joke!”

Gu Tong looked coldly at him before shaking his head secretly. “I can’t do anything about this formation.”

Despite trying his best, he was still helpless against Dao Yuanzai’s defensive cover. Naturally, there was nothing he could do about the formation as well.

Everyone around him paled after seeing this scene.

If even the strongest of them all, Gu Tong, could not do anything about Dao Yuanzi’s defensive cover and formation, what could they even do?

“Are we going to just die within this defensive cover?”

It was uncertain who was the first to speak but in the next moment, a commotion swept the crowd.

The many martial artists present looked frightened.

To them, death was not a terrifying outcome. However, it would be a total nightmare if they were to be refined while still alive and forced to watch helplessly as their life energy was drained out of them.

“You bitch! This is all your fault!” Emperor Xiao’s eyes flashed dangerously as he glared fixedly at Emperor Leng.

While Emperor Leng felt intense anger and hatred, she was mostly at a loss.

She felt helpless!

Surely, no one would not be able to do anything about this if even the strongest of them all, Gu Tong, was helpless.

They could only watch as Dao Yuanzi drained their life energy out of them.

“We’re just waiting to die!”

The same thought surfaced on everyone’s minds.

The only thing that they could do now was to wait for death to arrive.

They could only wait for the Life-devouring Formation to refine their life energy while they were still alive and for Dao Yuanzai to use the energy to forge his so-called Blood-cessation Demon Body.

Most of them had completely given up hope.

“Gu King, is it true that I can dismantle the Life-devouring Formation as long as I shatter Dao Yuanzi’s defensive cover?” Jian Wushuang was holding Leng Rushuang in his embrace but in his head, he was having a conversation with Gu King’s consciousness.

“What are you planning to do?” Gu King asked.

“I remember you once said that I can forcefully swallow the drop of Blood Essence in the event of certain death and try to fight for a chance of survival from there.” Jin Wushuang said calmly. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression shifted.

“If you do as I say, I can guarantee that you can take your little girlfriend and storm out of this formation alive,” Gu King said.

“Just us both? What about the rest?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“You still have the mood to think about others under such circumstances? You’re better off worrying about yourself,” Gu King scolded.

“How good are my chances if I gain strength from absorbing the Blood Essence and shatter Dao Yuanzi’s defensive cover?” Jian Wushuang once again asked.

“Dao Yuanzi’s defensive cover can’t be underestimated for it’s carved out of the Life-devouring Formation. Even Gu King Tong was unable to cause any damage to it after using all of his strength. That’s how strong it is… If you gain a short-term explosive growth in strength after absorbing the Blood Essence, you might be stronger than Gu King Tong. But you stand at most a 10 percent chance of shattering Dao Yuanzi’s defensive cover!” Gu King said solemnly.

“10 percent?” Jian Wushuang muttered. However, he appeared to have made up his mind. “That’s enough!”

Gu King was stunned. “What are you saying, Jian Wushuang?”

“If you tell me there’s not even the slightest chance of success, maybe I would listen to you and escape with Leng Rushuang. But my Senior Brother; Emperor Xiao and Di Jing who I’m indebted to; and my two brothers-for-life are all trapped in this defensive cover. There are also still countless innocent people still here.”

“For them… Never mind a 10 percent chance, even a one percent chance is enough for me to go all out and fight for our survival!” Jian Wushuang’s voice was icy-cold and carried an unprecedented sense of determination.

Relationships had always mattered to him the most!

Be it brotherhood!

Or those he was indebted to!

He also cared for those who once watched over him or even saved his life back then!

He had burned these memories deep into his mind.

Now that he knew he still had a shred of chance, he could still give it his all and try to fight for everyone’s survival.

He did not care if he would have to pay a steep price for his attempt or that there was a mere 10 percent chance of success. He would make good use of the chance anyway.

He could not bring himself to ignore his two brothers, his Senior Brother, Emperor Xiao, and the others and escape with Leng Rushuang!

“Have you already made up your mind?” Gu King asked solemnly. Considering the current situation, he did not try to persuade Jian Wushuang.

He respected Jian Wushuang’s choice.

“Gu King, should I fail, please find a way to leave this place with Leng Rushuang…”
