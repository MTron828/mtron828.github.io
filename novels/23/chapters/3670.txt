Chapter 3672: Discussion

“Little guy, did you see what I just did?” Jian Wushuang looked at Ye Chen. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Ye Chen shook his head subconsciously.

It was normal. Jian Wushuang was the top existence in the Divine Beginning Realm. As for sword principle, it was at the level of the origin of the sword universe. The swordsmanship he displayed, even if it was just a casual display…it was not something that a little guy like Ye Chen could see clearly.

“I have completely imprinted that sword in your mind. In addition, I will give you ten years. Within ten years, if you can comprehend one-thousandth of that sword skill, I will take you as an in-name disciple and teach you sword principle. In the future, I will also take you to explore the wider world.”

“But if you can’t comprehend one-thousandth of the swordsmanship in ten years, then your achievements in this life will be limited to this Eternal Chaotic World,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Ten years, just one-thousandth of the swordsmanship?” Ye Chen was immediately delighted.

Although he knew that Jian Wushuang’s sword was unfathomable, it was only one-thousandth of the swordsmanship, and he still had ten years.

Ten years was a long time for him, who was only 20 years old.

He was confident that he would be able to comprehend some of the swordsmanship within ten years, or even more than one-ten-thousandth.

“Little guy, I advise you not to be so confident. The swordsmanship I just displayed, even if I only comprehended one-ten-thousandth of it, is not something an ordinary person can do,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

What he said was the truth. His sword just now contained the universe origin of sword principle. That level of power was unattainable even for Jian Nantian, let alone Ye Chen. In ten years’ time…comprehending one-tenth of a profound mystery was definitely a huge and extremely difficult test for Ye Chen.

“No matter how difficult it is, I will definitely achieve it.” Ye Chen clenched his hands.

“Alright, then work hard. When you feel that you have comprehended some profound mysteries, you can look for me. If you haven’t comprehended any profound mysteries within ten years, there’s no need to look for me again.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, at this moment, he suddenly received a message from Wang Yuan.

“Father, mother, boss Wang Yuan has sent me a message. Many top experts from the Green Fire World and the Eternal Chaotic World have gathered in Wushuang City. I’m going to go over now and announce some things to the public. You guys should come too.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay.”

Jian Nantian and Ji Wumeng nodded.

“Ye Chen, you should come with us,” Jian Nantian said.

“Yes.” Ye Chen also nodded.

Then the four of them left the small town and went to the Wushuang Saint Realm.

The Wushuang Saint Realm was originally a Saint Realm for cultivators from the Green Fire World. There were many cultivators who stayed there all year round, but most of them were not at the top yet. They were cultivating with the help of the cultivation resources of the Wushuang Saint Realm, as for the top experts in the Green Fire World and the Eternal Chaotic World, not many people stayed there.

However, today, the Wushuang Saint Realm was filled with experts.

Not only were there many top experts in the Green Fire World, but there were also many Ruler existences in the Eternal Chaotic World who had rushed here.

Among them were some people who had interacted with Jian Wushuang before, as well as some people who were close to him.

For example, his good friend Duan Ling Feng, who had gone through life and death together when he was adventuring in the Eternal Chaotic World.

His senior brother was also Xue Lingtian, a disciple of Xuan Yi.

His disciple was Lin Lan.

There was also the full moon Gu King, who had once lived in his body for a long time!

In addition, the ancient god Clan’s Gu Tong King and the others had also come here.

Buzz!

In the towering and Majestic Divine Hall, throne after throne stood on both sides. At a glance, there were at least several hundred thrones.

These several hundred thrones sat the top experts of the Green Fire World and the Eternal Chaotic World.

As for the front of the Divine Hall, there were only two thrones lined up side by side. On one of the thrones, there was a white-skinned man with a graceful figure. This man was none other than the White Emperor!

After tens of millions of years, the White Emperor was still recognized as the number one expert in the Eternal Chaotic World. He was also the most exalted existence in the Eternal Chaotic World.

As for the other throne, it was originally empty until Jian Wushuang’s figure slowly appeared and finally landed on the throne, standing side by side with the White Emperor.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re finally back.” The White Emperor glanced at Jian Wushuang.

“White Emperor, how have you been?” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently.

He had a good relationship with the White Emperor. Later, he learned that the White Emperor was an experimental figure of his master, Xuan Yi. Like him, he had been striving for the perfect life level. Unfortunately, due to some special reasons, the White Emperor had long lost the potential to become a perfect Ruler.

However, since they were both valued by Xuan Yi, they were naturally closer to each other.

The seemingly leisurely conversation between Jian Wushuang and the White Emperor was heard by the hundreds of top experts from the Green Fire World and the Eternal Chaotic World on the throne below. They immediately began to discuss.

“That person is Jian Wushuang?”

“It’s rumored that Jian Wushuang saved the Eternal Chaotic World from fire and water tens of millions of years ago. Many people said that he was the savior of the Eternal Chaotic World. It’s also said that his strength was recognized at that time and he was not weaker than the White Emperor. Now that he has disappeared for tens of millions of years, I wonder what level his strength has reached.”

“I don’t think he’s weaker than the White Emperor, but I don’t know if he’s stronger than the White Emperor.”

Most of the people were talking about Jian Wushuang’s strength, and most of them compared the White Emperor to Jian Wushuang.

Many people thought that Jian Wushuang was once a super genius who was not much weaker than the White Emperor before he disappeared. Now that he had returned after tens of millions of years, he must be stronger and should be able to completely rival the White Emperor, he might even be stronger than the White Emperor.

Of course, this was only because he knew more about Jian Wushuang, or because he had lived from tens of millions of years ago until now.

However, there were still many people on the field who had only grown up during these tens of millions of years.

Because of the improvement of the cultivation environment in the Green Fire World during these tens of millions of years, many geniuses were born in the Eternal Chaotic World, which naturally created many experts.

Nearly half of the hundreds of experts present had only grown up in the past tens of millions of years. They did not live in the era where Jian Wushuang was from. Even if they had grown up, they had only heard some legends about Jian Wushuang.

After all, they had not seen the legends with their own eyes, so there would be some doubts about them.

For example, many people now had doubts about Jian Wushuang.
