Chapter 5095 Guardian of the Secret Text

In this realm, all disciples watched Jian Wushuang with intense anticipation.

Unbeknownst to them, they had already placed all their hopes on this young Yan Immortal.

As they watched Jian Wushuang stabilize the barrier with his Yan power, Prince Jiu's gaze grew cold and resentful.

He cold not understand why the most powerful individuals were all friendly with Jian Wushuang.

If it were just Yan Immortal, it would be one thing, but even Six and Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals seemed to flock to him.

"Damn it, how did this guy manage to do it?!" Prince Jiu was consumed by jealousy.

"Jian Wushuang, don't get too cocky. One day, I'll crush you beneath my feet!"

...

This time, the all-encompassing palm that descended from the black-robed elder failed to have the same effect. With shattered light and shattered shadows, the palm was directly dispersed.

A strange, dark-purple radiance aggressively consumed the Yan Immortal power and even defied the heavens, withstanding the black-robed elder's attack.

"Hmm?"

As the sky-breaking palm shattered into countless streams of light in the void, the black-robed elder looked puzzled. The previously weakened black-robed figure now seemed even more formidable.

Their first confrontation hadn't inflicted any significant damage on the black-robed figure, causing the elder to grow wary.

The black-robed elder, who had experienced countless battles since the Ancient Era, now sensed something entirely different about the black-robed figure.

He could not sense any flow of Yan Immortal power from the black-robed figure, not even the slightest ripple of it.

This left the black-robed elder extremely perplexed.

Yan power was the fundamental force of the entire Great Si Region, even the ultimate force of the Grand Yan Immortal Realm. No cultivator, not even Emperors, could escape the influence of Yan power, let alone Yan Immortals.

But now, this black-robed figure appeared to have completely and utterly avoided using Yan power. The strange dark-purple radiance he emitted was unique and fundamentally distinct from Yan Immortal power.

For a moment, the black-robed elder entertained many thoughts, but he quickly pushed them aside.

There was only value in contemplating when one was in danger of losing their life, and there was no danger in death.

The void trembled, and the order of the heavens shattered once more.

The black-robed elder moved through the air, extending his right palm with finger-like blades, striking toward the black-robed figure.

The seemingly indestructible black-robed figure appeared even more agile than before. Faced with the supremely powerful black-robed elder, he somehow managed to avoid the full force of the attack.

The fierce battle raged on!

At the same time, Jian Wushuang, who stood atop the divine mountain, gazed intently at the figure in the black-robed figure.

He could sense that the black-robed figure was adapting to the surroundings and growing even stronger than before.

"Could it be that without touching the source, each death makes one stronger?"

Jian Wushuang pondered out loud, all the while harboring concerns for the old man in the black-robed figure.

The old man's constant mention of 'seeking death' may very well have indicated that the condition of his Immortal body had truly reached its last stand. In this situation, even if the black-robed elder was a Peak Grand Yan Immortal, he might find himself at a disadvantage.

A more intense battle erupted within the eternal void, becoming a relentless clash.

The black-robed elder, who had been a Peak Grand Yan Immortal since ancient times, possessed an unfathomable foundation. He could casually conjure thousands of Chains of Heavenly Dao with a mere wave of his hand.

Countless Chains of Heavenly Dao, resembling ancient colossal dragons, emerged from the void and entwined around the black-robed figure.

There were simply too many of these Chains of Heavenly Dao for him to avoid, and in an instant, he found himself ensnared by them.

Buzz!!!

A resounding roar echoed through the ancient heavens, and in that moment, each chain of celestial order trembled, giving rise to intricate ink-blue patterns.

At this moment, with the black-robed figure at its center, 999 Chains of Heavenly Dao simultaneously erupted with unparalleled force!

The destiny contained within each chain of celestial order was equivalent to the black-robed elder's full-powered strike.

999 Chains of Heavenly Dao meant 999 full-powered strikes!

Even the eternal void of endless annihilation was perturbed by this.

The unparalleled fate energy of a Peak Grand Yan Immortal erupted completely, and the black-robed figure, bound and unable to escape, began to shatter under the crushing force of this fate energy.

It was quite evident that the body beneath the black-robed figure couldn't withstand the relentless lashings of the heavenly order chains, rapidly developing fine cracks.

At this moment, the old man in the black-robed figure arrived in front of the black-robed figure.

His expression grew solemn, as if he had sensed something. He spoke directly, "You don't belong to the Great Si Region; who are you really, and what is your origin? A remnant of the ancient Heavenly Court?"

The black-robed figure remained silent, and it seemed that their body under the wide black-robed figure was on the verge of breaking apart at any moment.

The old man in the black-robed figure narrowed his eyes; he could not even see the face beneath the hood, not even when it was himself attempting to do so. Throughout, this figure remained enigmatic to the extreme.

"Who are you, really?" the old man repeated.

This time, the black-robed figure slowly raised their head to gaze at him.

Even at such close proximity, their face beneath the hood remained hidden. All that could be seen was layer upon layer of dark purple mist, which was rather peculiar.

Finally, the black-robed figure, who emerged from the Heaven-Patterned Bone Armor and whose identity was shrouded in mystery, spoke.

Their hoarse voice seemed to have traversed countless ages and eras.

"One who gazes upon the Secret Text shall perish!"

The black-robed elder furrowed his brow. "What Secret Text? Speak!"

"One who gazes upon the Secret Text shall perish!" n√äw stùíêries at nùíê/vel/b/i/n(.)coùíé

The phrase was repeated once more, and the figure suddenly raised their head, locking eyes with the old man in the black-robed figure.

Two jet-black rays shot out from beneath the hood like elongated swords.

Caught off guard, the old man momentarily lost focus as they stared back. In that very moment, a sword-like purple radiance burst forth from beneath the black-robed figure and pierced the old man's chest.

In an instant, the 999 Heavenly Dao Chains shattered, and the fate energy vanished rapidly.

"Senior!"

Jian Wushuang shouted, without any hesitation, as he lunged toward the old man in the black-robed figure.

Even the chest of a Peak Grand Yan Immortal like the old man was shattered by the purple radiance.

"You seek death!"

The Invisible Sword, enveloped in blazing golden divine patterns, had already materialized, and Jian Wushuang, with his feet suspended in the void, hurled the Invisible Sword towards the black-robed figure.

At this moment, even the overwhelming dark purple mist retreated.

Boom!

The incandescent, burning Invisible Sword also pierced through the black-robed figure's chest, and the purest form of the Wushuang Sword Dao erupted within.

The already heavily cracked black-robed figure couldn't withstand such an impact, and it shattered into fragments.

Jian Wushuang did not look at where the black-robed figure had fallen. He raised his hand and caught the falling old man.

"Senior, are you alright?"

The black-robed elder's face turned pale, and the supreme fate energy quickly dissipated from his shattered chest.

In a hoarse voice, he said, "The situation seems a bit dire. My chest is hurting quite badly now..."
