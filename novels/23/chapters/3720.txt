Chapter 3721: Baby-Like

With the sound of the collision, Jian Wushuang blocked all the saber lights that Blood Saber Emperor used.

“Amazing! I used my most powerful secret skill, and the divine power that burst out at this moment is no less than that of an ordinary Ruler. But he can still block my saber lights so easily?” Blood Saber Emperor’s eyes were full of excitement.

In the next moment, he no longer held back.

“Blood Sword Master, take my strongest saber.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Blood Saber Emperor’s figure suddenly retreated. As he retreated, the blood-colored bewitching charm battle saber in his hand suddenly slashed out.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Endless blood-colored saber lights suddenly burst out.

Each of these blood-colored saber lights was like a blood-colored moon. There were hundreds and thousands of these blood-colored saber lights. They were like an enormous ocean of saber lights, blotting out the sky and covering the sun.

For a moment, the entire world was covered by this ocean of blood-colored blade lights.

At the center of this ocean of blood-colored blade lights, an aura that could make countless Principles Masters tremble suddenly rose.

At the end of the horizon, a cold blood-colored light rushed straight over.

This blood-colored light was incomparably dazzling. At the moment it lit up, the entire ocean of blood-colored blade lights around it seemed to have lost its color.

The entire world seemed to have turned completely dark. In this boundless darkness, there was only this blood light left.

It was the focus of the world and the only color in the world.

“This saber move is not bad.”

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly. He still did not draw his sword. He still used his finger as a sword.

When the blood light approached him, his right finger also stretched out straight like a sharp sword, stabbing toward the void in front of him.

Jian Wushuang still did not use his sword skill. Instead, he simply stabbed forward. However, there was an extremely dense sword principle universe origin in his hand.

In an instant, everything around him disappeared.

The sea of blood-red saber light had completely disappeared. The blood light, which had previously been the only color in the world, immediately dimmed and almost disappeared.

Jian Wushuang’s finger, which did not contain any power, had already touched the Blood Saber Emperor’s chest.

“You lost,” Jian Wushuang said lightly.

“How, how is this possible?”

The Blood Saber Emperor still stood there, staring at the finger on his chest. His eyes were wide open, and his mind was blank.

He was completely dumbfounded.

He did not expect that his most powerful saber move, which he was proud of, was already an ultimate skill at the Ruler Realm. In addition, after he used the secret skill, he temporarily had divine power comparable to that of a Ruler, at this moment, his battle strength should be infinitely close to that of a Ruler.

However, such a saber move was still easily defeated by Jian Wushuang.

He did not even draw his sword. He just used his fingers to defeat his swordsmanship and then pressed it on his chest. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

It felt like a giant was bullying a weak baby.

He could see that Jian Wushuang did not use his full strength. He had always been casual and easy, but even so, he still easily defeated him.

He was completely crushed by Jian Wushuang, and he was bullied by Jian Wushuang.

In the Void, the Divine Master, who had been watching the battle, was also stunned.

“How could it be? How could the Blood Saber Emperor be defeated so miserably?”

“Even if the Blood Sword Master is more powerful than the Blood Saber Emperor, he didn’t know that the gap is so big. Could it be...”

The Divine Master immediately thought of a possibility.

At this moment, the Blood Saber Emperor had barely calmed down. He raised his head and looked deeply at Jian Wushuang, asking, “Blood Sword Master, have you become a Ruler?”

“A Ruler?” Jian Wushuang was stunned, but then he laughed, “I haven’t become a Ruler, but my strength has long surpassed that of an ordinary primary Ruler.”

“You haven’t broken through to the Ruler Realm, but your battle strength has surpassed that of an ordinary Ruler?” Blood Saber Emperor was stunned. After a long while, he let out a helpless sigh, “It seems that I’ve entered the Heaven-viewing Realm. I thought that I should be the strongest among the Principles Masters. Even if you were stronger than me, you wouldn’t be much stronger. But in the end...you’re much stronger than me. You’re on a completely different level.”

“Blood Saber Emperor, don’t be discouraged. I’m able to reach this stage not only because I have many special reasons, but also because I’ve had some special encounters. As for you, you’re indeed very terrifying among the Principles Masters,” Jian Wushuang said.

He did not say this to comfort Blood Saber Emperor, but because the latter’s strength was indeed very impressive.

At least among the Principles Masters, the Blood Saber Emperor’s strength was definitely recognized by Jian Wushuang.

He was a special life form and had a powerful divine power secret skill. He could release divine power that was not inferior to that of an ordinary primary Ruler in a short period of time. In addition, he had created an absolute art at the level of a Ruler. Such strength…to a certain extent, he was not much weaker than a primary Ruler.

“No matter how powerful I am, I am no match for you. This battle with you has made me realize that there is always someone stronger than me. In this starfield alone, there are many Principles Masters who are far stronger than me, not to mention the entire vast universe. There must be many more terrifying geniuses and great beings like you, or even stronger than you. I can not wait any longer.”

“After the competition in the Red Cloud World is over, I’ll set off to the depths of the universe!” Blood Saber Emperor said.

“You’re going to explore the depths of the Universe?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Blood Saber Emperor, who was watching the battle in the void, was also shocked.

He did not expect that Blood Saber Emperor would have such a thought after the battle with Jian Wushuang.

“Blood Sword Master, thank you for this battle,” Blood Saber Emperor said.

“You’re welcome.” Jian Wushuang was calm.

“By the way, there’s something you don’t know yet, right?” Blood Saber Emperor suddenly asked.

“What is it?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Not long ago, a Sword Stone was born around the 17th ruins on the Third Continent,” Blood Saber Emperor said.

“Sword Stone?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He was on the Third Continent, and Daoist Xuan God had been collecting information about the Red Cloud World through various channels, but he had never heard of any Sword Stone.

“What’s so special about this Sword Stone? Who got it in the end?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I don’t know its specific use, but I’m sure it’s very useful for cultivators who are comprehending sword principle. When it was born, it was connected to the Red Cloud World, so no one could take it away. Therefore, it should still be there. If you have time, you can go and take a look yourself,” Blood Saber Emperor said.
