Chapter 494: Blind Emperor

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“How is that possible?”

“The Dragon King Arrow obviously pierced his body.”

Jian Wushuang turned pale. He thought his Killing Move worked. Normally, Su Ming should not?have been able to dodge it, but Su Ming had actually succeeded in escaping.

“It must be because of his Illusory Sword Principle,”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

The Dao was mysterious, so it was normal that Su Ming had some remarkable abilities.

“Boy, you’re just a Saint Realm expert, but your skills are amazing. What a pity! It’s meaningless in front of real strength.” Su Ming wore a faint smile while his dreamlike longsword became dazzling.

“Go to hell!” Su Ming said.

He lifted his dreamlike longsword up and was about to attack again.

Jian Wushuang was frightened at this moment.

He had experienced Illusory Sword Principle. The illusion was so real that he did not have the confidence to deal with it.

Buzz... A flow of immaterial Sword Essence suddenly rose nearby.

It looked somewhat bleak and sad, but it aroused Su Ming’s attention. This sovereign stopped and looked over toward the source of the Sword Essence.

An old figure slowly walked over.

He was a scruffy elder with white hair and black skin. On his skinny face, there were many black freckles. He opened his eyes, but his pupils were white.

Obviously, he was blind.

All the Sword Principle experts could not help but look at him.

Jian Nantian was fighting fiercely with Marquis Xuefeng, and it was hard to tell who would be the winner. However, when the scruffy elder appeared, Jian Nantian smiled faintly.

“He finally came?”

The blind, scruffy elder was the person Jian Nantian had asked for help.

The scruffy elder took stout steps and stopped by Jian Wushuang’s side.

Su Ming, who had been arrogant, looked at the scruffy elder with a cold look.

“Blind man, you are still alive!” Su Ming said coldly.

“You, a traitor, are still alive. Why should I die so easily?” the scruffy elder said indifferently.

“Traitor?” Jian Wushuang was intrigued by this information.

Judging from the way the elder spoke, Jian Wushuang knew he also belonged to the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor.

“This...” Marquis Zizhong curiously stared at the scruffy elder. Then his expression changed as he became shocked and terrified.

“Blind Emperor, it’s you!” Marquis Zizhong cried in an unbelievable tone.

His voice reverberated through the whole area.

Numerous Sword Principle experts heard those two words.

Exclamations rang out in succession.

“Blind Emperor? Which one?”

“He is Blind Emperor, one of the seven Sword Emperors from the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor?”

“Right, that’s him. Except for him, who else would dare to call himself Blind Emperor in the Divine Land?”

“He didn’t die?”

Numerous Sword Principle experts were shocked.

Many of them were knowledgeable, so they knew that the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor was the overlord of the Divine Land thousands of years ago and that apart from Sword Ancestor the seven Sword Emperors were the strongest.

Each one of the Sword Emperors was a supreme expert. It was said that the top three had reached the Dao and had the battle strength of a sovereign.

For thousands of years, Sword Ancestor and the seven Sword Emperor were the backbones of the Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline. No force could stand up to them.

Even the Three Ancestors could not fight against the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor.

Blind Emperor was one of the seven.

No one in the area had expected that Blind Emperor was still alive.

Thousands of years ago, the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor suffered some dramatic changes. Sword Ancestor died and his Bloodline collapsed. Numerous experts and disciples were killed and only a few escaped to the Nanyang Continent.

It was said that the seven Sword Emperors were killed.

Now, Blind Emperor had reappeared in front of everyone.

“Blind man, you actually survived that fight thousands of years ago. You’re quite lucky.” Su Ming stared at Blind Emperor and sneered. “Now you want to save this boy?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Since I’m here, I won’t let you be so unbridled,” Blind Emperor said in a low voice.

“Only you? How could you block me?” Su Ming smiled with scorn.

“Have a try. You’ll understand.” Blind Emperor snorted and a sword appeared in his hand.

“That is...” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

The sword was similar to his Triple-kill Sword in form, size, and color, but this sword was more powerful. It had reached the Dao Weapon Level.

Blind Emperor swung the longsword and stabbed forward.

Shua!

The spectators who comprehended Sword Principle were dumbfounded because they saw Blind Emperor stab at nothing.

“Blind Emperor has not only lost his sight, but also his senses as well?”?Many experts thought.

They did not understand why Blind Emperor launched such an attack, but they were shocked by what happened next.

A figure suddenly appeared in the empty space where Blind Emperor stabbed. It was Su Ming.

“What?”

The spectators were stunned.

They did not know what on earth had happened.

Only Jian Wushuang realized the reason.

“No wonder I missed him with my Dragon King Arrow. I actually fell into his illusion from the beginning. He let his phantom appear in one spot while his real body stayed in another!”?Jian Wushuang thought in private.
