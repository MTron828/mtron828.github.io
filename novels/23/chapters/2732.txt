Chapter 2733: The Search!

The five exchanged looks at the enlarging spatial passage before skimming into the spatial passage.

The corner of Old Gu’s mouth curled up, revealing a playful smile after the five entered the spatial passage. “It’s been a long time since I saw a cultivator and finally you came. I hope you’ll let me have some fun.”

The other end of the spatial passage was indeed a vast expanse of darkness.

Jian Wushuang and the rest emerged one after another from the spatial passage that remained in place.

“I guess this void must be huge. Otherwise, Master Gu won’t have given us three hours,” said Saber Master.

“Master Gu is the spirit of this secret realm and has full control over it. He seems to have casually thrown the Interspatial Ring, but the ring was thrown quite far away. It could be somewhere deep in the darkness and emptiness either in the center or the end of this dark void,” said Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen.

“We only have three hours, so we can’t delay too much. All five of us better spread out and look for it. Whoever is lucky will get it,” said Devilish Wind King.

“Yes,” agreed Long Xianzi.

“I agree too.” Jian Wushuang also nodded.

“We’d better get going if that’s the case.”

Saber Master suggested and the five of them immediately went off in different directions and began their search alone in the dark void.

The five of them firmly believed the Interspatial Ring was in the dark void as not only did they see Old Gu throw the Interspatial Ring into the dark void with their own eyes, but also felt that Old Gu would not deceive them.

Even if Old Gu wanted to fool or make fun of them, he had to throw some bait.

The Interspatial Ring was the bait and the treasures within must be something highly sought after.

Jian Wushuang was extremely fast in the boundless dark void while his soul power was at work sweeping and scanning his surroundings.

“Fortunately, this dark void has no restrictions on soul power and I can still use it to investigate my surroundings,” mumbled Jian Wushuang.

As a Perfect Chaotic Creature, he had the most perfect soul power despite being only a High-level Heaven Ultimate God. His soul power was extremely powerful and had a wide coverage area. It was even considered stronger when compared to those other Grand Ultimate Gods who went along with him into the dark void.

With his powerful and wide sensing ability on top of his astonishing speed, it seemed very advantageous for him to locate the Interspatial Ring.

He kept walking toward the depths of the dark void but was disappointed to have no sight of the Interspatial Ring after searching for more than an hour and scanning almost the entire dark void.

He had no choice but to return to the starting point and pick another route. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang met Devilish Wind King along the way.

“Alliance Master Su Han.” Devilish Wind King came right next to Jian Wushuang. “Have you found it?”

“No.” Jian Wushuang shook his head. “I’ve gotten right to the end of this void, yet still haven’t found it. I guess it’s normal as this dark void is huge after all. Have you found it?”

“Of course not.” Devilish Wind King shrugged.

“Neither you nor I found it. I wonder if the other three luck out,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Hmph, I’m afraid they’ll pretend not to have found it even if they did. I guess no one will be willing to split the treasures in the Interspatial Ring with the rest.” Devilish Wind King coldly snorted.

Jian Wushuang understood.

People were selfish in such circumstances and he was no exception.

He would also deny that he found it if he happened to chance across the Interspatial Ring when the five of them gathered.

“Alliance Master Su Han, why do you think Old Gu chucked the Interspatial Ring in here and told the five of us to look for it?” Devilish Wind King squinted his eyes skeptically.

Jian Wushuang shook his head. “I don’t know, but it’s not that simple.”

“Of course it’s not simple. He could’ve just given it to us directly if he wanted to give us an opportunity instead of having us searching for it based on our luck. I think he wants us to fight against each other to test our abilities,” said Devilish Wind King.

“That could be the case.” Jian Wushuang did not deny it.

“Alliance Master Su Han, you and I are the only two Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods after Yi Shen’s death in the first cemetery. Both of us are at an absolute disadvantage, so we should really gang up if anything happens. Saber Master, Hong Chen, or Long Xianzi—either one of them could easily crush us,” said Devilish Wind King solemnly.

“I know, don’t worry. The two of us will be on the same side if something happens,” said Jian Wushuang reassuringly.

Devilish Wind King smiled. “That will do. Okay, there’s still some time so let’s go and find it,” said Devilish Wind King before he left.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed as he watched Devilish Wind King leave.

“From the very beginning, Devilish Wind King has been really good to me and told me many things in this secret realm. He had also given me a Corpse Poison Pill that he prepared and also repeatedly told me that we should join forces, but I’ve always felt something is wrong with him,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

He could not pinpoint the fault in Devilish Wind King at that moment.

Jian Wushuang had instinctively thought that Devilish Wind King was behaving strangely.

The Primary-level Grand Ultimate God Devilish Wind King was the weakest among the six adventurers. However, he had miraculously survived being chased by a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet. Jian Wushuang thought it was weird.

“All these people who came to the secret realm seem cooperative, but all of them have their agendas. Each of them wants to get the most out of this trip, so I can’t be foolish and believe any of them—especially Devilish Wind King.” Jian Wushuang smiled before continuing his search in the dark void.

Jian Wushuang did not find the Interspatial Ring even after searching around for a long time, so he had no choice but to return to the spatial passage’s location.

Three hours were almost up and the other four had also returned to the starting point one after another.

Devilish Wind King was the last to return.

“Devilish Wind King, have you found the Interspatial Ring?” Saber Master looked over his shoulder.

Devilish Wind King asked, “No, how about you all?”

Saber Master, Hong Chen, Long Xianzi, and Jian Wushuang shook their heads.

None of them admitted to finding the Interspatial Ring.
