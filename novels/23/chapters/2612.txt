“They... They’re from the Divine Demon Sect, Life and Death Tower, and Dongfang Clan!” The purple-robed supervisor’s heart shook.

“Danyang Holy Domain has been a mess since Crimson Stone Saint’s death. The top cultivation sects have always been competing covertly against each other and very few of them would fight overtly. However, a Huangji Golden Pill was all it took to make them fight,” Senior Meng sneered and continued, “No matter how fierce they might be fighting it has nothing to do with the Star Picking Pavilion of course. What caught my interest is The Stately Painting.”

“I don’t know if The Stately Painting’s owner will appear in this battle.”

The battle had reached a feverish stage.

Although the strong lineup of experts from Nanwu Palace caused a commotion, they were not the only ones who came well-prepared.

The Divine Demon Sect, Life and Death Tower, and Dongfeng Clan had also come prepared. The three top cultivation sects took action at the same time and it was worth mentioning that they were working tacitly.

Nanwu Palace fell into a disadvantage under the pressure of those three top sects.

In the void outside the battlefield, Jian Wushuang was closely watching the battle.

“There are dozens of Heaven Ultimate Gods and five Grand Ultimate Gods in this battle. There’s nothing I can do to disturb the battle, not even a chance for me to fish in troubled waters.” Jian Wushuang frowned. “It’s almost impossible for me to sneak into the battlefield with so many pairs of eyes watching and kill the Young Palace Master of Nanwu Palace for his Interspatial Ring unless...

“Unless I use that trick!”

Jian Wushuang groaned secretly.

He still had a trump card which was something extremely terrifying and unusual.

It was very risky for him to play that card because of its extraordinary and shocking nature.

He might fall into a dead-end should anything go very wrong.

Therefore, he hesitated and struggled to make a decision.

However, he did not take long to make his decision.

“I finally found The Stately Painting and it’s now with the Nanwu Palace’s Young Palace Master. Even if any of those on the battlefield managed to get it today, they will not be able to claim ownership, hence there will be a possibility it might be transferred to another person. It’ll be extremely difficult for me to locate it again if it goes to a high-ranking and powerful expert!

“I can’t miss it since the opportunity is right in front of me now!

“Let’s do it!”

A hint of madness was driving Jian Wushuang to make the decision but he was also quite determined.

Thereafter, his figure slowly receded into the void behind.

He retreated to an extremely quiet and empty place before changing his outfit.

Initially, he was wearing a golden robe while carrying a longsword without masking his appearance and looking very young.

However, he soon had turned into a mysterious expert completely shrouded in a black robe with a black ferocious-looking mask over his face. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He had completely kept his breath of power concealed while leaving no traces that could reveal his identity.

He then slowly walked towards the battlefield.

...

The war was still going on fiercely on the battlefield.

The brawny red-bearded man from Nanwu Palace furiously said, “Divine Demon Sect, Life and Death Tower, and Dongfang Clan. Well, well. You’d better make sure I leave my body behind on this battlefield today. Otherwise, I’ll make the three of you pay the price.”

The Grand Ultimate God from Divine Demon Sect coldly exclaimed, “Haha, are you threatening us? Do you think Nanwu Palace is the Crimson Stone Fort? Even if it’s the Crimson Stone Fort, it’s now in a mess and can no longer threaten us. What can a small Nanwu Palace do?”

“Don’t talk nonsense with him anymore and just kill him. The Nanwu Palace won’t hand over the Huangji Golden Pill obediently if we don’t teach him a lesson,” said the Grand Ultimate God from Dongfang Clan.

“Yes, although we probably can’t kill both Grand Ultimate Gods of Nanwu Palace, we can still find ways to kill the Heaven Ultimate Gods and their Young Palace Master. I bet the Palace Master will go crazy if the Young Palace Master died,” said a cold old man with a sneer. He was the Life and Death Tower’s Grand Ultimate God.

“Haha, let’s kill them!”

The experts from the three top sects were no longer holding back and began fighting without reservation.

Countless experts watched the battle but none dared to intervene.

It was at that moment... a black-robed man with a black ferocious-looking mask emerged slowly from the surrounding void and walked towards the battlefield.

They could not sense the black-robed man’s aura and no one even noticed him when he first appeared in the void.

The people around him finally noticed his presence when he appeared at the battlefield’s peripheral.

“Who’s that person? Is he fighting for the Huangji Golden Pill as well?”

“Black robe? Black mask? He’s probably worried that these top sects will one day seek revenge with him so he deliberately covers up his appearance.”

“Huh, maybe he’s not that strong after all.”

Although many experts had noticed the black-robed man, they did not pay much attention to him.

The Huangji Golden Pill was of great use to Heaven Ultimate Gods and even Grand Ultimate Gods. It had attracted the attention of the many experts on the battlefield, hence it did not raise caution that someone else was also interested.

The people who were watching the battle and the experts who were madly slaying away on the battlefield both felt the same with no one taking the black-robed man seriously.

The black-robed man walked to the edge of the battlefield and slowly stopped.

Next...

Boom!

A unique but supreme pressure came from the black-robed man without warning.

The pressure was not from the breath of divine power, nor was it the divine aura. Instead, it was coming from his life rating, the type of pressure from a supreme being.

The black-robed man discharged the pressure and it instantly spread into the Nine Skies and Ten Earths before completely enshrouding the world.

Heaven and Earth were instantly shaken up as the huge world and space-time were disrupted and violently shook.

The violent wind was so strong that it was driving the world and everything else within the world to worship that black-robed man.

The battle that was going on seemed to have instantly died down due to the emergence of his life rating pressure.

All the experts from Nanwu Palace, Divine Demon Sect, Life and Death Tower, and Dongfang Clan were staring at Jian Wushuang along with those Heavenly Ultimate Gods and five Grand Ultimate Gods.

Their eyes showed an inconceivable horror and terror.

Their bodies were trembling.

Thump... Thump...

Everyone started kneeling!
