Chapter 2480: Defeated!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Surging divine powers were charging the Blood Mountain Sword and causing it to begin trembling violently and became extremely blood-red.

Jian Wushuang stared intensely at the green sword shadow wall coming toward him while he was raising the Blood Mountain Sword.

A terrifying hatred was gathering in his sword.

“I just created this strike not long ago and hasn’t shown it to anyone. You’ll be its test subject today.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold as ice as the energies in Blood Mountain Sword were charged to its limit.

In the blink of an eye, the wide-spanning Transmigration Law power began to burst out.

“Transmigration Sword Technique, Hateful Path Toward Heaven!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Boom!

The Blood Mountain Sword swung downwards.

The swing had sliced the void into two halves.

Hate! Hate! Hate!

The sword-light that was filled with an infinite hatred willfully swept across the void. Sword essences filled everywhere it passed by as if it had paved the entire way to Heaven.

Hateful Path Toward Heaven was a move Jian Wushuang created while studying Fengtian Scroll, it was also the third move in his Transmigration Sword Technique after Endless Cycle and Samsara Empty Strike.

It was also the debut of that move.

A sword-light that was filled with hatred stunned everyone as soon as it appeared!

Under the watching eyes of countless experts around, the magnificent hatred-filled sword-light clashed head-on with the wave-like green sword shadow that was pressing in.

For a moment, it looked like two entire worlds had collided.

What came with it was an earth-shattering boom.

The infinite sword essences and divine powers expanded violently towards every direction.

The Heavens were screaming while the Earth was shaking.

A divine power wind storm suddenly swept up which reached far and wide.

It shrouded the entire battlefield in a force that could destroy Heaven and Earth.

“Retreat. Let’s retreat, quickly!”

“Back off as far as we can, hurry!”

The expert’s disciples from various sects who were standing around the battlefield retreated in fear.

Many pairs of fearful eyes stared at the divine power wind storm on the battlefield and were gasping in awe.

It was way too powerful.

For those First-Class and Peak Divine Demons, an Ultimate God’s ability was way too strong—such that it was horrifying and suffocating.

“Fan Jianxian’s ability was to be expected, but I didn’t expect Jian Wushuang could be this strong as well!” Someone exclaimed.

A while ago, all of them had the idea of killing Jian Wushuang. However, at that point, many sects have given up on that notion.

Obviously, none of the Wusha Wilderness sects would take experts with an Ultimate God’s battle strength lightly.

Even Narcissus Island, one of the top ten sects, only had one known Ultimate God was the Lord of Narcissus.

In the other sects, many did not even have an Ultimate God in residence. Therefore, however much they hated Jian Wushuang, they would not pick a fight with an expert possessing an Ultimate God’s battle strength.

Ring ring ring~ The Heaven and Earth finally calmed down.

The overbearing divine power wind storm had also died down gradually, revealing what was supposed to be the battlefield.

However, the previously flat battlefield grounds had disappeared and was replaced with what appeared to be huge craters left behind by the sweeping divine power.

A figure stood on each end of the battlefield.

Naturally, they were Jian Wushuang and Fan Jianxian.

They stared at each other from either end of the battlefield with extremely cold expressions.

“Has a conclusion been determined yet?”

“Who won and lost exactly?”

Those sects’ experts stood around the battlefield and stared at both of them.

If it was in the past, they would assume Fan Jianxian was the winner without a doubt. He was a widely recognized true Ultimate God and the top-ranking sword cultivator with an incredible reputation after all.

Regardless of how strong Jian Wushuang could be, he was probably only in the Divine Demon realm in the end.

However, as the battle carried on to that point, nobody could be certain about Fan Jianxian being the victor anymore.

The battle strength that Jian Wushuang displayed was truly not below that of Fan Jianxian.

Everyone stared at both of them as the battlefield quieted down.

Right at that moment, there were some slight changes to Jian Wushuang’s expression. The corner of his lips curved slightly upwards as he wore a mysterious smile.

“The number one sword cultivator of Wusha Wilderness is only so so!”

Right when his voice faded...

“Ughh!”

A big gulp of blood shot out of Fan Jianxian’s mouth and spilled all over the ground.

Fan Jianxian was pale to begin, but his face had turned deadly white now. The breath of his divine power had also sharply decreased.

The sight of that shuddered everyone on the scene.

“He lost! Fan Jianxian has been defeated!!”

“The number one sword cultivator actually lost to Jian Wushuang who was still merely a Divine Demon?”

“Oh, heavens!”

“From today onwards, the title of Wusha Wilderness’s number one sword cultivator would have to change its owner!”

The experts were wearing all kinds of expressions on their faces with many of them feeling agitated.

Fan Jianxian had become a legend very early on.

However, someone had stepped violently on the legend that day. By stepping on the legend himself, he became the new number one sword cultivator.

It was none other than Jian Wushuang!

“How’s that possible?”

Long Zishan, Yu Aoqing, and many people from Narcissus Island were all shocked beyond words.

They almost could not believe what they had just witnessed.

Especially Narcissus Island’s Elder Linghe and the Seventh Elder.

They secretly felt regretful for agreeing with the Lord’s decision to abandon Jian Wushuang now.

However, it was too late.

On the edge of the battlefield, although Fan Jianxian was badly injured, he was not dead yet. He stuffed two elixirs into his mouth and as those elixirs went down, the paleness on his face slightly faded away.

Afterward, he once again looked at Jian Wushuang with mixed feelings. “Unexpectedly, you don’t only have an incredibly deep understanding of Space-time Law. Your understanding of Transmigration Law was not bad either and had reached the First Stage. In addition, that strike which you created by combining Transmigration Law and your own sword skill...was truly powerful!”

Fan Jianxian was extraordinarily skillful with the sword, but even he had to admit the strike Jian Wushuang last shown was truly remarkable and strong.

Judging purely from the power of that final strike, it was even slightly stronger than his own most powerful strike.

“I have nothing to say about losing to you. From now on, the number one sword cultivator of Wusha Wilderness is you.” Fan Jianxian seemed to have lost all his pride as an Ultimate God expert before Jian Wushuang.

“The number one sword cultivator of Wusha Wilderness, haha. I have no interest whatsoever in this title. By the way, aren’t you sending messages for reinforcement? There’s no need to hide, just take out the message token and do it.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly with an air of jest.

Fan Jianxian’s face changed right away.

As it was exactly what he was doing, secretly sending messages for other Supreme Elders to come.

As for what he said, that was just to distract Jian Wushuang. Unexpectedly, Jian Wushuang had read his mind.

What surprised Fan Jianxian was, Jian Wushuang remained calm as usual without any thoughts of escaping even after knowing he was summoning reinforcement.

Where did his self-confidence come from?
