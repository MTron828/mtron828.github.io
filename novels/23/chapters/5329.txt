Chapter 5328 - 5328: Guangmu Tianzun

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the heavenly realm, things were relatively calm. However, in the Earth Secret Realm, the savage ancient lands were engulfed in chaotic bloodshed, making it impossible to suppress the disorder with fewer people.

Within the Earthly Realm, they established grand earth temples, even recruiting ordinary humans, yet they still couldn’t effectively control the chaos. Every day was filled with battles and slaughter.

Any surplus powerful beings in the heavenly realm would be sent to the earthly realm. However, over time, these individuals developed opinions; they were not puppets.

He could manipulate them as he pleased.

The powerful beings in the Earthly Realm were not fewer than those in the heavenly realm. The chances of those sent to the earthly realm falling were high, and gradually, fewer dared to venture.

It was challenging to recruit enough powerful beings in the Earthly Realm.

He even recruited many Special Life Forms from the Divine Tomb, sending them to the Earthly Realm. Though these creatures were ferocious, at least they obeyed him, aiding in suppressing the powerful beings in the earthly realm.

Within the Earthly Realm, enormous secrets were hidden. His true self sat in the earthly realm at all times, with only two avatars in the heavenly realm. The rest of his forces were deployed to the earthly realm and the Divine Tomb.

True tranquility lay in the mortal secret realms.

There was no need for suppression; only a few local powerful beings were necessary, and establishing the White Tiger Temple was sufficient.

Through the teleportation array, Bai Yi’s avatar directly arrived in North Mu Zhangzhou.

This time, he wouldn’t easily reveal himself. If push came to shove, he would step in. If the Elderly Palace could handle the situation on its own, that would be even better.

However, in the Northern Region over the years, the astronomical number of teleportation arrays and treasures supplied was immense.

Even if he wanted to let go of such a juicy piece of meat, his subordinates would not retreat so easily.

The enormous expenses in the Earthly Realm required treasures from the Heavenly Realm. The cost of recruiting powerful beings was too high.

Moreover, among the indigenous Emperors, it was challenging to find those with extraordinary strength, and those with average strength couldn’t control the situation.

The strength of Venerable Lie Huo, in fact, was quite impressive, ranking among the top in Liuzhou. However, he was instantly killed, revealing the vast gap in power.

Now, he needed to summon an immensely powerful Emperor, not leaving the matter to the Elder Palace.

This time, he specifically teleported to North Mu Zhangzhou for this purpose.

Guangmu!

A figure known as Tianzun in ancient times, the true top-tier Emperor. Being listed as one of the 108 Divine Envoys represented a figure of the Qishen Temple.

Among the tier 6 Emperors, they were truly extraordinary existences.

North Mu Zhangzhou.

When it was relocated to the Qishen Temple, there was a vast mountain range, spanning a hundred thousand mountains continuously. Within these mountains, there were murky air currents, causing ordinary people to quickly lose their way when entering.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Only strong cultivators who had achieved immortality could live there.

Therefore, there were very few strong cultivators living in Zhangzhou, with only a handful of sects, not even a decently powerful cultivator among them.

All of this was due to the presence of Guangmu Tianzun. The threshold of the chaotic air currents he left behind in Zhangzhou was too high for ordinary folks. Most of the strong cultivators living here were outsiders seeking refuge.

Surviving here was nearly impossible.

His residence was deep within the air currents of Zhangzhou.

Deep within Zhangzhou, on a towering divine mountain, there was an ancient grand hall.

This was the Dao Arena of Guangmu Tianzun.

Here, the air was extremely thin, and the hall was clear, devoid of any turbid air.

Bai Yi descended, this body not geared for battle, clad in a simple white robe. The robust figure did not appear delicate but rather strong.

“Brother Guangmu, are you so unwelcoming?” Bai Yi revealed a faint smile, gazing at the tightly closed grand hall.

Crack!

The grand hall slowly opened, and from within emerged a burly man with a dark golden robe. His eyes were deep-set, his nose high and prominent, and his jaw wide and sturdy.

“Bai Yi! ‘t

After exchanging a glance, both of them exuded a formidable aura.

Guangmu, slightly surprised, spoke, “Do you really think that you can defeat me with just a clone?”

“Haha, Brother Guangmu, you’re giving me too much credit, and I didn’t come to spar with you either,” Bai Yi said with an awkward smile.

Indeed, his divine body was not a match for Guangmu Tianzun. After all, the latter was one of the 108 Divine Envoys.

If Bai Yi’s divine body proved inadequate, it would be a disgrace to his master.

Before the fall of Qishen, their master had specifically instructed them regarding the treatment of those subordinates who hadn’t fallen. They were to be treated kindly, not oppressed, not coerced, and allowed to leave at any time.

Some individuals had managed to escape death, such as Wu Zuo.

However, Guangmu Tianzun was different. After being injured, he had slept in Zhangzhou and hadn’t participated in the events that followed. When he woke up, Qishen had already fallen.

He was unwilling to leave and refused to follow the arrangements of the Four

Halls, choosing to stay hidden in this grand hall.

Many years had passed since then.

“Come in!” Guangmu extended his hand, gesturing in invitation.

After all, it was a relic left by Qishen, and Jian Wushuang wouldn’t be too disrespectful, despite retaining some of his former pride.

The two entered the grand hall and took their seats.

Bai went straight to the point, outlining the current situation.

The Zhen Ling revived, the highest trial commenced, and the Elder Palace was established.

As for the upheaval in Liuzhou, it was a trivial matter not worth mentioning. Guangmu Tianzun, hearing about the revival of Zhen Ling and inheriting many memories from Qishen, had a somewhat moist look in his eyes.

As the messenger of Qishen, he felt guilty for not being by Qishen’s side when he fell. Over the years, he had lived with this guilt, to the extent that he didn’t venture out of Zhangzhou.

He feared running into acquaintances and being ridiculed.

Back then, the direct line of Qishen, all three godheads, and even the 18 Divine Generals, had fallen. Some were completely gone, and others, severely injured, remained in a dormant state, yet to recover.

Among the Divine Envoys, he was the sole survivor. When Qishen fell, the Divine Envoys, unwilling to live on, followed Qishen into the God’s Tomb, creating graves for themselves.

And here he was now, living well, with no place to die even if he wanted to.

Bai Yi, getting to the crucial point, immediately brought up the request to leave seclusion.

“Brother Guangmu, the highest trial is meant to find an heir for the master. It’s a rule set by the master himself. Now that the trial is starting and we are about to enter the Four Great Secret Realms, it’s not suitable to conduct the trial when there is unrest in the realms!”

Although Bai Yi was usually impulsive, the Seven Orifices Linglong Heart within him was genuine.

Xuan One also possessed the wisdom required for such matters.

Hearing about Qishen’s last wish, Guangmu Tianzun couldn’t help but be moved.

Surprised, Guangmu asked, “Unrest in the Four Great Secret Realms?”

“Yes!” Seeing an opportunity, Bai Yi continued, “The celestial realm had just stabilized not long ago, and in Liuzhou, a major change occurred. The teleportation array was destroyed, and the representative of Qishen’s sect in the branch hall was killed on the spot. In addition, in the Earthly Realm, the Forest of Eternal Secrets recently experienced turmoil that almost destroyed the entire realm. It took Lord Zhen Lings personal intervention to resolve the situation. However, not long after, problems emerged in the Heaven Realm again. ”

As he spoke, Bai Yi couldn’t help but bow his head, cursing himself for being useless and not completing the task entrusted to him by the master years ago..
