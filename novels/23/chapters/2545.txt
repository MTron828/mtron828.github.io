Chapter 2546: Demanding An Explanation

Jian Wushuang smiled coldly on the tavern’s first floor while sipping his drink when he heard Ye Ming’s voice. “How arrogant!”

“Of course he is!” Xiao Tiexin smiled.

Jian Wushuang made a move.

He appeared on the tavern’s second floor in the blink of an eye with Ye Ming’s servants had already beaten up the thin man.

Jian Yi was unimpressed and emanated a sweep of High-Level Ultimate God’s aura from his body.

“I heard someone say that he wants to wipe me off? Who’s that?” Jian Wushuang asked in a cold tone with his displeased face seemingly covered in frost.

“Master, you’re here! I would’ve been killed have you not arrived in time.” The thin man wailed miserably the moment he saw Jian Wushuang.

“Are you guys those who want to abolish my disciple’s cultivation base and even threaten to do the same to me?” Jian Wushuang’s cold gaze scanned those people from the Ye Clan.

“Errr...” Ye Ming was a little confused and disconcerted.

He could sense Jian Wushuang’s divine power breath which was almost similar to his father’s and knew he was facing a High-Level Ultimate God.

Who would have thought the thin man lying on the ground crying miserably had a High-Level Ultimate God master?

The hopeless disciple called a High-Level Ultimate God his master?

That was unbelievable!

The servants who were with Ye Ming came back to their senses as one of them reverently said, “Master, we are from the Ye Clan and this is Young Master Ye Ming. What just happened is just a misunderstanding.”

“Misunderstanding? I heard you were going to maim my disciple and abolish my cultivation base. Are you sure that’s just a misunderstanding?” Jian Wushuang waved his hand and grabbed Ye Ming while the winds knocked those servants down to the ground. “Young Master Ye Ming. Well, well, I’m going to demand an explanation from the Ye Clan. I want to know just how they’re educating their youngsters. Come with me.”

After that, Jian Wushuang grabbed Ye Ming and dashed out of the tavern.

Ye Ming’s servants of Ye Ming as well as those people in the tavern, could not stop Jian Wushuang and merely watched him leave with Ye Ming.

The crowd in the tavern became tumultuous after both of them were completely out of sight.

“Young Master Ye Ming has been arrested!”

“Shit!”

“Quick! Report this to the Second Elder!”

...

Ye Clan was a mid-tier clan with a good background among the clans in the Northern Darkstar Continent.

Although they were only a mid-tier clan, they never lacked experts and even had a Peak Ultimate God.

In a magnificent looking hall, an old man with purple hair was scanning through a piece of information.

Suddenly...

“What?!” The purple-haired old man was shocked as he sprang up to his feet.

“Ming’er is arrested by a High-Level Ultimate God and he’s on his way here to demand an explanation? How daring!” The purple-haired old man was fuming.

At that very moment, a powerful High-Level Ultimate God aura came through the Ye Clan Mansion’s gates.

“Come out Ye Clan fellows!” A violent roar rang within the Ye Clan’s Mansion.

“He’s here?” The purple-haired old man looked up with his eyes blazing within the fire of fury.

The entire Ye Clan was in a commotion as a group of experts almost instantly started gathering around the mansion’s gates.

Most of those experts were Ultimate Gods with more than thirty who appeared before Jian Wushuang.

The purple-haired old man was among them making a total of five High-Level Ultimate Gods present.

However, the Ye Clan Leader—a Peak Ultimate God—had yet to come forward.

“So, this is just a mid-tier clan.” Jian Wushuang sighed before waving his hand and throwing Ye Ming toward the Ye Clan’s people.

The purple-haired old man immediately stepped up to help Ye Ming.

Ye Ming started yelling upon being freed, “Father, that’s him! He caught me and almost killed me. Quick! Kill him and avenge me!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The purple-haired old man ordered, “Shut up!” After a thorough check-up, he noticed the uninjured Ye Ming and was relieved.

After that, Jian Wushuang spoke up with his loud and thick voice which echoed throughout the mansion.

“Ye Clan, I need you to give me an explanation!”

He was so loud that not only all of Ye Clan’s people heard him but also alerted the many cultivators who were not far away.

The annoyed Ye Clan members wore an ugly expression on their faces.

“Explanation?”

The purple-haired old man put Ye Ming aside and looked straight into Jian Wushuang’s eyes before coldly shouted, “You caught my son and yet arrogantly came running over here and demanded an explanation! How disrespectful you are!”

“Elders, fight alongside me and take him down. Kill him if he dares resist!”

“Yes.”

Three High-Level Ultimate Gods immediately stood up and charged toward Jian Wushuang.

They did not see Jian Wushuang as a threat since all of them were at a similar realm level on top of being a three against one battle.

A playful grin lit up Jian Wushuang’s features as he moved and drew out 11 apparitions.

A majestic sword-light cut through the void.

The sword-light was not only splendid but also incredibly fast.

Before the three High-Level Ultimate Gods who stepped up had time to react, the sword-light landed on their divine bodies.

“Hum! Hum! Hum!”

The three High-Level Ultimate Gods snorted and were prepared to retaliate.

“This is just a warning. I won’t hesitate to kill if you insist on attacking me,” announced Jian Wushuang coldly.

“Oh...” Many Ye Clan’s experts were surprised to hear his threat.

‘Did he just defeated three High-Level Ultimate Gods with a flick of his sword?’

They could see his previous move was purely a warning given to his opponents. Otherwise, those three High-Level Ultimate Gods would have been severely wound or even worse—dead.

A High-Level Ultimate God who was repelled in the first attack solemnly said, “Second Elder, he’s very powerful.”

The purple-haired old man squinted his eyes while studying Jian Wushuang before his face suddenly changed as though being reminded of something. “Golden robe, good with the sword and a high Space-time Law understanding... Your Excellency, are you the newly promoted Blood Gladiator two months ago, Mr. Jian Yi?”

“Jian Yi?” Everyone in the Ye Clan’s jaws slacked as they had heard of his name.

Jian Wushuang’s name spread throughout the Northern Darkstar Continent after succeeding in the Blood Gladiators Challenge. The Ye Clan was of course well-informed of such news.

“Do you know me?” Jian Wushuang wore a half-smile.

The old man with purple hair gasped, “It’s you.”
