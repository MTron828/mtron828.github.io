Chapter 5504 ¬†Beiwang Tower

Mahayana Spirit Mountain, located at the extreme west of the Heavenly Realm.

There, at the base of the temple, Mahayana Spirit Mountain stood aligned with the Divine Temple, ready to intercept any attempts to seize the temple.

After all, meddling in temple affairs was beyond the purview of the Elder Palace.

If Jian Wushuang were to attempt a seizure, he could succeed based on his strength, but if the Elder Palace intervened, the temple would also take action.

Of course, if he were to align himself with the temple, he could employ certain methods to make them willingly offer their support.

However, Jian Wushuang was now entangled with the Elder Palace and Wu Zuoshuan, making it impossible for him to seek refuge in the temple. ALL new ùíÑhapters ùíên nùíêv(ùíÜ)lbin(.)com

After discussing the subsequent plans, Jian Wushuang understood that Zhen Ling would personally take action this time, and he could rely on Zhen Ling with confidence. If he encountered Fuego, Zhen Ling would intervene.

Jian Wushuang's main concern was Fuego. In the Northern Territory's Shadow Sect, they had almost been eradicated, and the strongest remaining might be a tier 6 Emperor.

Facing such strong opponents, even if Jian Wushuang couldn't defeat them, escaping wouldn't pose a significant problem.

Once the plan was roughly settled, Jian Wushuang took his leave.

With still a millennium before the appointed time, he could visit the Beiwang Tower and consider closing himself off again before taking action, devouring the Universe Origin Source.

Currently, he possessed three-tenths of the Universal Origin Source, aside from the one-tenth set to self-destruct. Though somewhat chaotic, containing various Origin Sources, it happened to be suitable for enhancing his Extreme Dao.

At present, his Extreme Dao had just reached the ninth level. With these origin sources, he could bring his Extreme Dao to its fullest level.

Having the essence of all things, he could also prevent them from deviating.

He was not afraid that the strengthening of his Extreme Dao would lead to the complete deviation of his power of All Things.

What he feared was that, after the deviation, it would become uncontrollable, and he would be unable to fully integrate the Dao.

After Wu Zuoshuan escorted Jian Wushuang outside the gate, watching his departing figure, he felt a complex mix of emotions. This time, he didn't know if Jian Wushuang would succeed.

Even if he succeeded, having involved himself, he had now joined Jian Wushuang on the same boat.

He had great expectations for Jian Wushuang. With the Dao Lord's formidable strength and charisma, it was only a matter of course for him to eventually take control of the Qishen Temple.

While others were skeptical, he was optimistic. The present support was a timely boost, and the future seemed even more promising.

Swoosh!

After seeing off Jian Wushuang, he turned and headed to the Origin Source Sea within the Qishen Temple to report to Zhen Ling.

"Master, the plan has been set in motion. We'll take action in a millennium!" Wu Zuo respectfully reported.

Zhen Ling disrupted the chessboard and turned to face Wu Zuo.

"This time, no matter what happens, you must ensure the safety of Jian Wushuang. If anything goes wrong, you'll be held accountable first!"

Wu Zuo felt somewhat awkward. Why did he always have to bear the blame every time there was a failure?

However, he didn't dare to contradict Zhen Ling's words and proceeded to outline the plan that Jian Wushuang had presented.

Stroking his beard, Zhen Ling burst into laughter. "Not bad. This plan suits my taste. Inform me in advance on the day of the abduction. I haven't witnessed such a lively scene in a long time!"

"Absolutely!" Wu Zuo was also quite excited.

On Yuanyang Island.

Jian Wushuang first visited a treasure pavilion, where he sold a piece of cosmic crystal, exchanged it for some necessary treasures, and then converted 100 billion godstones.

After buying many essential items and exchanging a large amount of godstones, he spent less than 100 cubic universe crystals.

In real terms, 1 universe crystal was worth 1 billion cubic godstones.

The purchased treasures weren't particularly rare, but due to the uniqueness of universe crystals, only a few people exchanged godstones for universe crystals, and no one had yet thought of exchanging universe crystals for godstones.

So, the other party was generous and directly gave Jian Wushuang some needed treasures.

With the godstones in hand, Jian Wushuang went to a tavern and settled all the previously owed godstones directly.

The other party was extremely deferential, fearing to offend Wu Zuo.

Jian Wushuang took the opportunity to scold Wu Zuo, making it seem like the two were not getting along!

This was also part of the plan.

Leaving the tavern, he didn't waste any time and went straight to the Beiwang Tower!

Taking advantage of the available time, he naturally wanted to break through here again, not willing to waste a single moment.

Arriving in front of the Beiwang Tower, Jian Wushuang looked up. The Beiwang Tower soared billions of miles high, reaching into the clouds, more majestic than the Demon Sound Mountain.

Originally, this tower was a pinnacle treasure of the primal universe, but it was tricked over by Zhen Ling.

It was said that the inheritors of the fourth round of trials were selected and tested here.

Of course, those trial participants could only reach the fourteenth floor at most.

It was already impressive for Dao Lords to reach the 10th floor.

Reaching the 14th floor was extraordinary, comparable to a tier 2 Emperor.

Back in the Original Planet, Jian Wushuang was only at the strength of around tier 2.

It seemed that the Dao Lord here had potential not inferior to his own.

The Ultimate Dao with such tremendous potential generally wouldn't descend to the Grave God Mountain; Hu Qing was quite exceptional.

Originally, Zhen Ling had high hopes for Hu Qing. Now, the tables had turned, and he was the one set to inherit the Qishen Temple.

This Beiwang Tower would be his in the future, and everything would be his.

Jian Wushuang stepped into Beiwang Tower.

On the negative first floor's main hall.

There were many rows of seats here, and quite a few people were already seated.

As soon as he entered, he heard someone calling his name.

"Brother Wushuang!"

It was Wanyan!

Jian Wushuang revealed a smile and walked over.

"Brother Wanyan!"

He was somewhat surprised. These two shouldn't have been here for long! Shouldn't they be exploring the area?

Wanyan pulled Jian Wushuang over and first introduced a tier 4 peak-level Emperor standing nearby.

"Brother Wushuang, this friend, Daoist Tianxi, is an Inheritor who came down from the Grave God Mountain. Don't be fooled by his tier 4 Emperor status; he has reached the 41st level!" Wanyan exclaimed!

Tianxi sat in place, unmoved, just nodding at Jian Wushuang.

No wonder, beings of this level all had their pride.

Ignoring this, Jian Wushuang asked, "Why haven't I seen Brother Dongsheng?"

"Ah, don't mention it. As soon as that guy arrived here, he hasn't come out. He's already on the 57th level now, probably won't come out before reaching the 60th level!" Wanyan said helplessly!

Originally, the two of them thought that this place would be similar to the Demon Sound Mountain, but upon arriving, they discovered that it was completely different from the Demon Sound Mountain.

That complete Universe Origin Source was not something one could casually comprehend.

Moreover, it was said that this Origin Source belonged to a Divine Master.

Jian Wushuang was surprised to hear this!

Back then, he had only vaguely sensed the Origin Source of that primordial Divine Master. The powerful aura had made him tremble, although he was weak at the time and couldn't comprehend any mysteries.

But now it was different. Even if the Origin Source of the Qishen was in front of him, he could explain its mysteries.

"Brother Wushuang, you're going to strike it rich this time!" Wanyan approached Jian Wushuang and whispered.

Jian Wushuang asked in surprise, "Why do you say that?"

"Haha, you'll know when you try it!" Wanyan teased, leaving a sense of anticipation.¬†
