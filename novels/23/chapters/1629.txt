Chapter 1630: King Gu Tong

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang had stayed in Ancient God Palace for a hundred and twenty years.

In a lofty hall in Ancient God Palace.

Ling Shan stood politely before King Gu Yi.

“King Gu Yi, I have just received news that Gu Jian defeated Gu Jinyu,” Ling Shan reported.

“Gu Jinyu isn’t too strong among second stage six-star Ancient Gods. He could be considered intermediate. Gu Jian passed the sixth level of Star Moon Tower, isn’t it normal that he defeated Gu Jinyu?” King Gu Yi didn’t care.

“If Gu Jian were to defeat Gu Jinyu when he went all out, it naturally wouldn’t be much. But most importantly, he didn’t use any human attack skills at all, he used the four Ancient God unique skills to defeat Gu Jinyu,” Ling Shan explained.

“Oh?” King Gu Yi then looked shocked, “He never used any human attack skills? Are you sure about this?”

“Yes,” Ling Shan nodded,” I am certain that he never once used his comprehension of the power of Heaven Way, nor did he use any sword principles. At most, he used his divine power.”

“In other words, his control of the four unique skills has surpassed Gu Jinyu?” King Gu Yi looked surprised.

The Gu Jinyu that they were talking about was a six-star Ancient God who stayed in Ancient God Palace for many years. The purity of his bloodline was high but he was only a silver-armored Ancient God. His control of the four Ancient God unique skills was extremely high. However, he was defeated by Jian Wushuang…

“Although I am reluctant to admit this, I have to say that Gu Jian is a really terrifying genius. No matter if its a human or as an Ancient God, he is one in a million. His improvement speed is terrifyingly fast. If this continues, I cannot imagine to what stage he will improve,” Ling Shan said.

King Gu Yi smiled faintly.

He couldn’t predict Jian Wushuang’s potential either.

“Oh yeah, the thing that I assigned you to look into. Did you find anything?” King Gu Yi asked.

“Yeah,” Ling Shan nodded, “I investigated twice and I got the same results. Gu Jian isn’t from King Gu Tong bloodline. There isn’t such an impressive five-star Ancient God from King Gu Tong’s bloodline.”

“I knew it,” King Gu Yi looked calm. He didn’t seem to be surprised at the results. “He carries a human bloodline. If I’m not mistaken, he should have been living in the human territory previously. He only came to Ancient God Sanctuary to partake in the Ancient God Palace examination. Hence, he registered using King Gu Tong’s name.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Is that so? Should we…” Ling Shan had yet to finish his sentence.

King Gu Yi waved, “Don’t need to do anything. Regardless of the young man’s origin, he does have an Ancient God bloodline, that’s the truth. Also, he passed the sixth level of Star Moon Tower, that’s the truth as well. We only need to follow the rules that our ancestors left behind.”

“I understand,” Ling Shan nodded and then he left.

Ancient God tribe was different from humans.

Ancient God tribe purely relied on power and strength. As for fighting and scheming against one another went, it hardly happened.

…

Gu King City, there were people shuttling to and fro on the street.

That very moment, there was a troop made up of over ten people marching into Gu King City.

The troop was made up of Ancient Gods but they were all weak. They were either three or four-star Ancient Gods. As for five-star Ancient Gods, there were only two of them,

“We are in King City now, you can walk around. Remember, don’t get into any fights. Go ahead,” a brawny elder exhorted.

Then, the troop walked in all directions in excitement.

The brawny elder and the other five-star Ancient God came to a shop.

They had come to King City to get some necessities for their tribe after all.

As they were purchasing some items, there were three figures gathered at a corner of the shop as they casually chatted.

Among the three, one of them was a bald, brawny man. As for the other two, both of their figures and appearances were ridiculously alike. They should be twins.

“You brothers just arrived in Gu King City?” The bald brawny man asked. His voice was loud as though he was afraid that anyone could hear him.

“Yeah, the two of us have been staying in the tribe. We came to Gu King City this time with the intention to enter Ancient God Palace,” one of the twin brothers said.

“Tsk tsk. It’s a pity that you came too late. If you were to arrive earlier, you might have been in time to witness the miracle of Ancient God bloodline,” the bald brawny man said.

“Miracle? What miracle? Tell me,” the brothers were curious.

“What happened was that there was a mister, a mix of human and Ancient God bloodline. He was like you, wanted to join Ancient God Palace and he passed through the pre-examination of Ancient God Palace, but because he was of mixed blood, he couldn’t enter Ancient God Palace. Then, the mister made a shocking decision, which was to challenge Star Moon Tower!”

“Star Moon Tower?”

“The legendary place of definite death?”

“This person has guts!”

The brothers were surprised.

“Humph, what place of definite death? To us, it might be a place of definite death, but to the mister, he survived before everyone in Star Moon Tower. Not only did he pass the first four levels of Star Moon Tower, he also passed the fifth and sixth levels. He is only one step away from the final seventh level!” The bald, brawny man said with a loud and bright voice.

“What?” The brothers were shocked.

The brawny elder and the five-star Ancient God, who were picking the items that they wanted to purchase, were shocked too.

“He passed the sixth level of Star Moon Tower?”

There was astonishment in their eyes.

“This is true. Many people saw it too. Hence, it is said to be a miracle,” the bald brawny mad complimented.

“What’s the Mister’s name. Which King is he under?” One of the brothers asked closely.

“I know his name, Gu Jian. As for his King, it seems to be King Gu Tong!” The bald brawny man said.

The moment he said that, the brothers didn’t react differently. However, the brawny elder and the five-star Ancient God next to him was stunned.

“Elder Yi, did you hear that? Did they say King Gu Tong? That’s our King!” The five-star Ancient God said in excitement.

“I heard that. Don’t be so excited just yet,” The brawny elder looked solemn. He lowered his voice as he said, “Our King is in trouble and he isn’t like how he was before. Among the people in our tribe, although they were a few gifted young men, it is impossible for them to pass the sixth level in Star Moon Tower.”

“Gu Jian… I have never heard of the name. He might not be with us.”

“Not with us?” The five-star Ancient God creased his eyebrows.

“We can’t determine it now. Don’t rush. We have time, let’s try to ask around,” the brawny elder squinted his eyes.
