Chapter 1456: Misfortune

Translator:?Larbre Studio?Editor:?Larbre Studio

One of the three hall masters in Lineage of Star, Hall Master Yuan, who possessed extremely strong power in Lineage of Star, behaved rather humbly at that very moment before the middle-aged man.

“Mister Tian Jian, sorry to trouble you,” Hall Master Yuan smiled.

“It’s nothing. Don’t mention it.”

The middle-aged man was the owner of Sky Sword Mountain. His voice was cold as he spoke, “As you have requested, I imprisoned the young man in Sky Sword Prison following a matter of course. However, Sky Sword Prison is extremely dangerous and it’s impossible for me to keep an eye on him all the time. Hence, if the young man were to run into an accident in Sky Sword Prison, I would not be responsible.”

“Of course,” Hall Master Yuan smiled.

“You look like you are very confident in the young man,” the owner of Sky Sword Mountain looked at Hall Master Yuan.

“If I were not confident, why would I dare to ask Mister Tian Jian to send him into Sky Sword Prison?” Hall Master Yuan smiled as he replied.

The others didn’t know Jian Wushuang’s direct line of descendance but Hall Master Yuan did.

He knew Jian Wushuang had cultivated Xuan Mie Golden Body and completed the first fraction. His divine body could be compared favorably with a Real God’s. Plus, he had defense treasure with him.

In Sky Sword Prison, everyone’s divine power was restrained. Hence, it wouldn’t be easy to kill Jian Wushuang, whose defense power was so strong.

Plus, he also knew that Jian Wushuang possessed Soul Power. It was one of the biggest advantages he had.

With the two, as long as Jian Wushuang was careful and didn’t catch the eye of the few top experts in Sky Sword Prison, he shouldn’t be in too much danger.

“How long do you want me to imprison him for?” The owner of Sky Sword Mountain asked.

“Ten thousand years,” Hall Master answered, “Ten thousand years should give the young man enough experience in Sky Sword Prison. If he were to be lucky, he might already reach the criteria to leave Sky Sword Prison before ten thousand years.”

“Achieve the criteria on his own? To kill a hundred Universe Gods in the Third Heaven in Sky Sword Prison?” The owner of Sky Sword Prison raised his eyebrows, “If so, I will be rubbing my eyes in anticipation.”

Hall Master Yuan smiled faintly and then his blurry figure vanished into the cave dwelling.

“Ten thousand years to achieve the criteria to leave Sky Sword Prison? Hehe, I’d love to see if the young man from Lineage of Star has the ability.”

The owner of Sky Sword Mountain sneered and closed his eyes.

…

Jian Wushuang thought he was just unlucky that he had got imprisoned in Sky Sword Prison. He happened to be caught by the owner of Sky Sword Mountain right when he had killed Universe God Mo Yan.

He didn’t know that it wasn’t because he was unlucky that he got imprisoned in Sky Sword Prison but because Hall Master Yuan had intentionally arranged it for him.

From Hall Master Yuan’s point of view, although Sky Sword Prison was dangerous, it was also a great place for training.

In the prison, not only were there Universe Gods who possessed fighting power of one on Universe God ranking list, but there was also a large number of Real Gods. Especially as the Real Gods were restrained and could only carry out divine powers like a Universe God in the Third Heaven, it was extremely valuable

In the outside world, Jian Wushuang, who was Universe God, wouldn’t have the chance to fight against a Real God after all. However, there would be many chances in the Sky Sword Prison.

Such a place was, of course, suitable for training.

However, Jian Wushuang had no idea at all. He thought Hall Master Yuan was negotiating with the owner of Sky Sword Mountain to get him out.

However, Jian Wushuang never placed hope on other people.

In Sky Sword Prison, in the vast crimson land, Jian Wushuang was plunging forward in the void.

His Soul Power had spread around long ago and filled the surrounding region. He could see everything in the region.

“Huh?”

Jian Wushuang suddenly paused and looked towards a direction to one side. There was a bare mountain in the direction. It didn’t look strange but Jian Wushuang could see clearly with the coverage of his Soul Power, at the bottom of the mountain, there was an expert hiding.

“Purple-haired, carrying a saber and there is a faint scar in between his eyebrows.”

Jian Wushuang could even see the characteristic of the expert’s appearance clearly with his Soul Power without the other person knowing.

With his appearance and characteristics, Jian Wushuang immediately recognized the person.

“Wu Cang, of the third level, an expert close to the top. He’s good with a sword and created a Real God unique skill. He’s good in close combat and possesses a secret skill of defense. His divine body is extremely strong too,” Jian Wushuang recalled the information about the expert.

The experts from four different levels in Sky Sword Prison, putting aside the four Kings from the strongest first level, although the other three levels of cultivators were of the same level, there was a difference in strength. Hence, there were top, intermediate, and low players at every level.

Wu Cang was of an intermediate standard of the third level, close to the top.

“I just came to Sky Sword Prison and I only fought for a short while with Luo Meng, but Luo Meng is only an expert from the fourth level who had yet to create Real God unique skill. He isn’t my match but Wu Cang… I can give him a try.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and went forward towards the bare mountain.

Just as Jian Wushuang appeared in the void surrounding the bare mountain, the expert who was hiding in the cave dwelling at the bottom of the mountain, Wu Cang, immediately lifted his head.

“This person… Looks very unfamiliar, I’ve never seen him before.”

“A newcomer!”

Wu Cang immediately understood and he was beaming with joy.

In Sky Sword Prison, newcomers were the easiest to kill normally.

The experts who stayed in Sky Sword Prison for years had their measures to defend and they knew one another’s ability clearly. Hence, it was extremely difficult to kill one another.

Wu Cang saw Jian Wushuang and he immediately had the intention to kill.

“Mm, he stopped? He’s right above me. Did he notice me?” Wu Cang creased his eyebrows, “Shouldn’t be. My hiding skills are brilliant. Even when Real Gods pass by, they don’t notice me if they don’t probe carefully.”

Wu Cang thought Jian Wushuang had happened to stop in the void above the mountain.

But in actual fact, Jian Wushuang had locked him down via Soul Power long ago.

“Come out.”

In the void, Jian Wushuang’s voice traveled through the mountain, layers of ground, into the cave dwelling and into Wu Cang’s ears.

“He really found me?”

Wu Cang creased his eyebrows but he didn’t hesitate and exited the ground directly. He appeared in the void above, before Jian Wushuang.

“Newbie, your consciousness senses are not too shabby. You can even notice my existence.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Wu Cang carried his saber behind his back and he crossed his arms. He looked at Jian Wushuang with a malicious smile.
