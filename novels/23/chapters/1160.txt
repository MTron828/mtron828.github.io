Chapter 1161: Returning to the Ancient World

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang talked with Xuan Yi for quite a long while.

They talked about the changes in the Ancient Sect over the two thousand years and other trivial things.

Their meeting lasted almost half a day, but during this period of time, Jian Wushuang had never inquired about Xuan Yi’s real identity or background. Nor had Xuan Yi unveiled them to him.

Jian Wushuang did not want others to know that he was still alive. Therefore, he only visited his master and then left the Ancient Sect.

“Jian Wushuang, your master has a big secret!” Gu King said in a serious tone.

“I know,” Jian Wushuang nodded. In fact, he had discovered that a long time ago.

“If my assumption is correct, your master does not belong to this Green Fire World. He must be from the Eternal Chaotic World and is probably a big shot, a top-notch existence in the Eternal Chaotic World,” Gu King continued.

“Are you sure?”Jian Wushuang asked, furrowing his brows.

“Are you sure that my master Xuan Yi is a top-notch expert in the Eternal Chaotic World?”

“It’s just my guess. I’m not certain about this.”

Gu King went on, “During my journey in the Eternal Chaotic World along with King Luo Zhen, I met a great many top experts, and some of them were full of mystery. However, your master is more unfathomable, mysterious than any expert I’ve met before!

“How come such an incredible expert was willing to stay within the Green Fire World? He even has kept a low profile, served as a Palace Master of a Sect and accepted several disciples. Why?

“What’s his intention?”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang wrinkled his forehead into a frown.

“Xuan Yi’s real purpose?”

Jian Wushuang wondered cluelessly.

In his eyes, Xuan Yi had always been a mysterious, easygoing and casual elder.

Most importantly, Xuan Yi had treated his disciples very well.

He had patiently instructed his several disciples including Jian Wushuang in cultivation and gifted them plenty of treasures. Although he had done so much for them, he had never asked them to pay back.

“Is he really selfless? Or does he think that my three Senior Brothers and I are still too weak to help him?”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself and then shook his head.

“Anyway, Master is my savior and I am willing to return his favor even if I need to sacrifice my life. I do not care what his aim is. As long as it does not infringe my principle or it is not evil, I will do my best to help him.”

Jian Wushuang said, a determined look in his eyes.

Gu King stayed silent for a while, and then said, “Take it easy. I can feel that your Master treats you sincerely and he’s unlikely to have the intention of utilizing you. If you’re really determined to return his kindness, you should try your best to enhance your strength. Now you’re not strong enough to pay him back.”

Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly.

He was well aware of that. Although he had stood at the summit of Green Fire World, he still had a long way to go if he wanted to catch up with the top experts in the Eternal Chaotic World. If he wanted to be of some help to Xuan Yi, he had to cultivate harder to improve his battle strength.

“Jian Wushuang, what’s your plan? Are you going to head for Star Island?” Gu King asked.

“Star Island?” Jian Wushuang repeated to himself.

That was where Lineage of Stars chose their disciples.

Jian Wushuang had once been a disciple of Lineage of Stars. After passing the trials in the black tower on the Star Island, he had been freed from Star Island.

However, plenty of people were still trapped there, and some of them were Jian Wushuang’s good friends. Besides, Jian Wushuang had made a deal with Dao Master Kong Ming on Star Island. Kong Ming had given him a Dragon-phoenix Fruit in exchange that he must return to Star Island in 100,000 years and try to pass the ultimate trial to set him free.

Being a Dao Master now, Jian Wushuang was qualified to accept the ultimate trial on Star Island.

“I’ll go to Star Island one day, but it can be postponed. Now that I’ve come back to Firmament Territory, I plan to have a look at my hometown,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“You hometown? Do you refer to the Ancient World?” Gu King was stunned.

“Yeah,” Jian Wushuang replied, with a bright smile appearing on his face.

He was from the Ancient World.

He was born and bred in the Ancient World.

He had been in his hometown for just dozens of years, while spending more than 2,000 years staying in Green Fire World. Despite that, Jian Wushuang still loved his hometown more.

“The Ancient World is my root. I left there 2,000 years ago. I want to know what it looks like now.”

“Is Sword Marquis Mansion… still there?”

Jian Wushuang was eager to come back, clasping his hands.

He took leave immediately.

As a plane world, the Ancient World was just a small part of the Green Fire World.

To enter the Green Fire World, the Warriors in the Ancient World needed to break through a series of barriers and overcome lots of hardships.

However, experts in Green Fire World could easily step into the Ancient World.

Jian Wushuang quickly found the way leading to the Ancient World. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

There were countless Ancient Worlds and Jian Wushuang’s homeland was one of them. It was called the Divine Land.

The waves rolled up on and off above the sea, with the clear, blue sky reflecting in it.

A Void above the sea began to crack, and the cracks quickly extended and covered hundreds of miles, looking like a huge spider web. All of a sudden, it shattered and a huge space Black Hole emerged out of nothing.

A red-robe figure slowly walked out of the Black Hole after its appearance.

With the arrival of the figure, the Black Hole releasing terrifying devouring power began to shrink. Within a few seconds, it disappeared. The world fell silent again.

“Here I am… my Ancient World.”

Jian Wushuang was floating on the surface of the sea. He closed his eyes and breathed the air around.

He opened his eyes again after a long time, with a joyful smile on his face.

“I’m back! I come back!” Jian Wushuang cried out with a delightful smile.

He raised his hand and swished it gently. The surrounding void immediately broke into fragments, and then a crack which extended several thousands of kilometers turned up.

“The space of the Ancient World is indeed delicate. Even one or two Eternal Realms can easily smash such a world,”?Jian Wushuang sighed secretly while shaking his head.

Soon Jian Wushuang’s Strength of Soul began to spread around the world.

His Strength of Soul covered this world instantly without meeting any obstruction.

“Nanyang Continent is over there!”
