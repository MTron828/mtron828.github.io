Chapter 471: The New Lord Arrives

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang would not tell them that he met Di Jing at the bottom of the cave mansion.

If the news was spread that Great Demon Di Jing was still alive, it would cause a sensation in the entire Flaming Battlefield or even the entire Divine Land.

“That’s it?” Black Yuan Lord frowned. Although he doubted it a little, he did not ask anything further.

Then they left the cave mansion.

Since the powerful Marquis Puppet had prevented them from searching for treasures, they had to leave.

The exploration of the cave mansion had to stop for now.

As for the other secrets in the cave mansion, they would have to wait for the two camps’ marquises to explore personally.

In the huge campsite outside of the cave mansion, the lords from the Marquis Piaoxue Camp did not rush to leave.

Even though their camp had lost many lords in this action, they had still gained a lot—a Dao Weapon and four Interspatial Rings.

The surviving lords could receive corresponding battle achievements according to their contributions.

With the help of Jian Wushuang’s Realm Technique, Loftiness Lord had been able to resist until Black Yuan Lord came and then gave the Dao Weapon to him.

In the fight for the four Interspatial Rings, as Jian Wushuang killed Demon Soul Lord and Myriad Islands Lord, the Marquis Piaoxue Camp had been able to obtain the four rings.

Jian Wushuang had contributed the most, so he would receive amazing battle achievements.

“120,000 battle achievements.” A flicker of excitement flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

It was known that the price for entering Beimo Cave Mansion was 100,000 battle achievements. And he had now obtained an abundance of battle achievements, which could be exchanged for a large number of treasures.

Spirit Lord stood in front of Jian Wushuang and said politely, “Swordsman, those battle achievements can also be used outside the Treasure Vault. If you need a treasure that isn’t in our vault, our camp will try to help you get it, as long as you pay enough battle achievements.”

He had heard about Jian Wushuang’s amazing battle results in Puppet Master Cave Mansion.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang nodded inwardly.

“That’s right. And there is another thing I need to discuss with you.”

Spirit Lord looked at Jian Wushuang and said seriously, “You know, we’ve lost many lords in this action, and many of them were in charge of territories. Now they are dead, so those territories, of course, need new lords.”

“Spirit Lord, you want me to take charge of a territory?” Jian Wushuang asked in an odd tone.

“Yes.” Spirit Lord nodded with a smile.

“Normally, if you have the strength of a novice lord, you’re qualified to take charge of a territory. Now you have proved that you’re strong enough to handle a territory. What’s more, with such strength, you won’t want to continue traveling in the Flaming Battlefield, will you?”

Jian Wushuang did not know how to react.

Generally, Saint Realm experts would travel in the Flaming Battlefield, aside from any special cases—for example, if a new cave mansion emerged, the lords would turn up. Although Jian Wushuang was a Saint Realm expert, he was a bit stronger than an ordinary intermediate lord.

It would be inappropriate for him to travel around the Flaming Battlefield.

Moreover, he had lost interest in fighting in the Flaming Battlefield.

“In that case, I’d like to accept your suggestion,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“I have a list of territories for you. Take a look and choose one as you like.” Spirit Lord gave the list to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang started reading it. After a while, he made his decision.

“This one,” Jian Wushuang said while pointing at the name of a territory.

“Blood Sword Territory?” Spirit Lord said with a smile, “Then I’ll arrange it for you.”

Three days later, Jian Wushuang went to Blood Sword Territory with a lord.

Blood Sword Territory was larger than Iron Saber Territory and its previous owner was a novice lord. During this trip to Puppet Master Cave Mansion, that lord had no opportunity to enter the palace and was killed while fighting for treasures in the inner layer.

Blood Sword Territory needed a new lord, so Jian Wushuang had come.

“Swordsman, that is Lord Mansion of Blood Sword Territory,” a purple-clothed lady, Misty Heart Lord, said with a faint smile. “I have sent a message and had those generals wait for you.”

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. “Let’s go down.”

Jian Wushuang and Misty Heart Lord flew toward Lord Mansion.

Like Iron Saber Territory, Blood Sword Territory had an army called the Blood Sword Army, which had 20 generals in it.

Those generals held the same ranks as commanders of Iron Saber Territory. Normally, Saint Realm experts at Stage Two held the post, and a few of the generals were experts at Stage Three.

Now, those generals were quietly waiting there.

“The new lord will arrive today, right?”

“I wonder which lord will come.”

“No matter who comes, he has to be an expert at the Cloud Realm, far superior to us.”

The generals were discussing it in secret.

They had received the news that their lord had died and the Marquis Piaoxue Camp sent a new lord to take charge of their territory.

At this moment, two figures slowly descended from the sky and appeared in Lord Mansion.

The generals raised their heads and looked at the two figures.

“That’s Misty Heart Lord. But who is the other guy?”

“Misty Heart Lord has her own territory and can’t take charge of our territory, so is our lord the one beside her?”

“He is the new lord?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Those generals immediately frowned.

Lords were almost always Cloud Realm experts, who were more powerful than those generals.

Therefore, as long as their new lord was a Cloud Realm expert or even just a novice lord, they would be obedient to him.

However, the black-robed young man with a longsword on his back was just a Saint Realm expert.
