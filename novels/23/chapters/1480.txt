Chapter 1481: Leaving

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the dark red sky, cold wind was swirling.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

Two shadows, one in front and one behind, swept past the void.

“Real God Kong Ling, it is impossible for you to escape!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with murderous intent. He was staring at the shadow in front of him which was escaping, and he had already used the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood.

“Jian Wushuang, I am not one of the Blood Emperor’s men and I have never depended on the Heartless King. Moreover, I have never had any dealings with you before. Why must you be so ruthless?”

Real God Kong Ling’s furious voice could be heard from the front.

“Ruthless?” Jian Wushuang laughed coldly, “Everyone, including you and I, have been thrown into the Sky Sword Prison involuntarily. I need to kill ten Real Gods so that I can leave. As such, I’m sorry!”

As soon as his words left his mouth, the Divine Power that was already burning in a frenzy in Jian Wushuang’s body intensified even further.

With the second stage of the Secret Skill of Dragon Skill, Jian Wushuang’s speed increased by a hundredfold immediately and he caught up with Real God Kong Ling instantly.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate due to pity in the slightest bit and he attacked straight away.

After some time, Real God Kong Ling, who belonged to the third stage of Real Gods, was killed by Jian Wushuang.

“The tenth Real God!”

Atop the void, Jian Wushuang looked down at Real God Kong Ling’s body with his eyes glowing brilliantly.

From the time he had started his massacre in the Darkness Mountain up to the current moment, it had been two years.

And finally, he had killed the tenth Real God.

Initially, Jian Wushuang had planned to release his power against the Blood Emperor and the Heartless King. Hence, the ten Real Gods who had died at his hand should have been experts under the two Kings.

However, it was a pity that the experts under the command of the two Kings were not idiots. Since it was only him executing the massacre, the experts had already left the territory of the two Kings and found themselves a hiding place in the Sky Sword Prison. As such, Jian Wushuang had no choice but to kill those Real Gods who had never offended him.

Buzz! Buzz!

In the void, a peculiar power gathered all of a sudden.

“They have come?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were glowing with delight.

At the moment that the peculiar power gathered, all the experts in each and every corner of the whole Sky Sword Prison felt it.

Within the purple, exquisite attic, Universe God Tian Feng and Universe God Gu Tong raised their heads.

“This power! Someone is about to leave the Sky Sword Prison.”

“If I’m not wrong, the person who is leaving is Jian Wushuang, right?”

“Apart from him, the Sky Sword Prison does not have anyone else who has fulfilled the conditions to leave.”

“Hehe, he left the Sky Sword Prison after less than five thousand years. I am envious of him.”

…

Within the crimson fortress in the Darkness Mountain.

“That little kid Jian Wushuang has finally left,” the Blood Emperor clenched both his fists. However, his eyes were filled with mixed feelings.

Initially, he had planned to kill Jian Wushuang and acquire the Blood-killing Plate Armor. With this, he would have a chance to leave the Sky Sword Prison.

However, in the end… Jian Wushuang’s speed of growth had completely stunned him.

Hence, he had given up hope of acquiring the Blood-killing Plate Armor a long time ago.

When he saw Jian Wushuang leaving at that moment, he heaved a sigh of relief.

…

The Fiery King sat within a sea of fire at the bottom of a lofty volcano in the Fiery Prison. At that moment, he could not help but raise his head.

“This little kid has met the conditions?”

The Fiery King murmured and his face wore a smile.

“Fiery King,” a message was delivered.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re about to leave?” the Fiery King questioned.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang chuckled: “I am bidding my farewell to you before I leave. Thank you for taking care of me for the past few years. After I get out, I will definitely find a way to get you out.”

“Haha. Don’t think of trying to get me out. The chances are slim. You should continue training outside. For my Lineage of Scarlet to have a junior like you, I can die without any regrets,” the Fiery King laughed heartily.

“No matter what, I will do my best.”

After Jian Wushuang repeated himself, the peculiar power in front of him took the form of a giant hand and grabbed Jian Wushuang with lightning speed.

Jian Wushuang had no way of defending himself against it and had also never even thought of defending himself against it. He was caught by the giant hand and sent into a wormhole that had opened temporarily.

As the wormhole disappeared, the Sky Sword Prison settled down quickly.

…

Within a dim cave.

The space opened up and with a glowing light, Jian Wushuang’s body appeared in the cave.

“This place is…”

As soon as he appeared, Jian Wushuang’s eyes surveyed the area. In no time, his attention was focused on a shadow sitting with its legs crossed in the area in front of him.

He was a middle-aged man who carried three longswords and he looked like a unique, fierce sword.

This middle-aged man caught Jian Wushuang’s attention due to the cruel sword essence that he was releasing.

This sword essence had caused even Jian Wushuang to be terrified.

Suddenly, the middle-aged man opened his eyes. In a split second, a vast amount of sword essence burst forth and his cold eyes locked on to Jian Wushuang immediately.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang only felt as if his neck had been strangled with great force by someone. He could neither speak nor breathe.

This caused him to experience fear that he had never experienced before.

The good thing was that this condition only lasted for a moment before it was undone.

Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh of relief and he greeted the middle-aged man respectfully at once, “I am Jian Wushuang. Greetings to the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain.”

What a frightening sword essence. Just a simple gaze was enough to deter Jian Wushuang from having any ideas of resisting him. This middle-aged man must be an Almighty.

This caused the identity of the middle-aged man in front of him to surface immediately.

“Little kid, how was your experience in the Sky Sword Prison?” the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain asked casually.

“Not bad,” Jian Wushuang replied indifferently.

“Oh?” the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain shot a glance at Jian Wushuang, “That’s right. You have been in the Sky Sword prison for more than four thousand years. Moreover, you have also continued to improve yourself during the four thousand years. Hence, you will not find it uninteresting. To you, this prison has become a good training place.”

After hearing what was said, Jian Wushuang laughed within himself.

Most of the cultivators in the Sky Sword Prison had been imprisoned for many years. During these years, their abilities had risen to their maximum a long time ago. Hence, there was not much hope for them to raise their abilities any further even if they wanted to. Moreover, they were unable to leave the prison. Naturally, this was a form of suffering to them.

However, Jian Wushuang was completely different.

“In the past, you killed one of the white deacons in my Sky Sword Mountain. Moreover, you killed him within the Sky Sword Mountain, ignoring the rules of my Sky Sword Mountain!” the voice of the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain turned cold. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Jian Wushuang became stupefied.

“However, I have already imprisoned you in the Sky Sword Prison as it is a rule of the Sky Sword Mountain. Since you were able to leave the Sky Sword Prison by yourself, no matter what feuds you had with my Sky Sword Mountain in the past, all of them are written off. You… can leave!”
