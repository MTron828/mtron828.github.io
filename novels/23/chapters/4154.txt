“An origin mark?” The Lord Zhennan, Qing Xuzi, and the others were all surprised.

“Because the Ninth Kalpa King was in a hurry to escape, he could not completely remove the poison in the first place. I can find him based on this origin mark. However, if you continue to dawdle, I won’t be able to find him again after the Ninth Kalpa King has removed all the poison and my origin mark.” Ruler Silver Roc said.

Duke Zhennan, Qing Xuzi, and the five blood messengers’ eyes lit up when they heard the Ruler Silver Roc’s words.

“Very good, then let’s kill our way up now! This time, with the combined strength of the four of us, I don’t believe that the Ninth Kalpa King won’t die!” Duke Zhennan’s mouth curled into a sneer as he spoke with hatred.

The five Blood Nether Emissaries looked at each other, nodded, and said in unison, “The Supreme divine medicine is mine, and the Ninth Kalpa King is yours!

“I don’t want the Supreme divine medicine or the Ninth Kalpa King,” Qing Xuzi said, his face livid. “But I want Jian Wushuang dead!”

Qing Xuzi’s original target was the divine medicine. However, the battle with Jian Wushuang had become the shame of his life.

He could not allow this disgrace to continue living in this world. Therefore, compared to the divine medicine, he wanted to kill Jian Wushuang more.

When Ruler Silver Roc saw this, a sinister look of delight appeared in his eyes.

These forces came to an agreement in an instant. Under the lead of the Ruler Silver Roc, they immediately set off to the place where Ninth Kalpa King, Jian Wushuang, and Divine Marquis Qingfeng had disappeared.

As for the Rulers around Fengyang Canyon, seeing that the protagonists of this battle had left, they also left one after another.

Of course, they all knew that the fight for the godly medicine was not over yet. After all, Lord Zhennan and the others had already caught up. As for the final result, no one knew.

However, just the battle that had just erupted in Fengyang Canyon was enough for them to talk about with great relish.

First of all, it was naturally the Ninth Kalpa King’s supreme strength.

The fact that the Ninth Kalpa King had such a great reputation in the universe and was considered the number one Ruler by many people had been completely confirmed by this battle.

Lord Zhennan was an invincible master among the Ultimate Rulers, and he had a few divine armor guards with him. They were all top-tier Ultimate Rulers, but they had been defeated by the Ninth Kalpa King alone. This kind of strength had completely exceeded the scope of a Ruler.

The rumors outside that the Ninth Kalpa King had the battle strength of a Supreme martial artist were true.

Moreover, the battle between Qing Xuzi and Jian Wushuang had shocked everyone.

No one had expected that Qing Xuzi, who could be said to be invincible among Rulers, would be able to fight evenly with a fourth-stage great Ruler.

Even though they did not know the name of this fourth stage great Ruler, he had been deeply remembered by everyone present.

…

On a mountain, Jian Wushuang and the other two temporarily stopped.

Among the three of them, Jian Wushuang was the most relaxed. Although he had burned a lot of divine power when he performed the Dragon-destroying secret skill in the battle with Qing Xuzi, he had a divine body that was 68000 miles tall. The amount of divine power he had burned was unbelievable. The amount of divine power he had burned was nothing to him.

It could be said that he had not suffered any losses in the battle with Qing Xuzi.

Divine Marquis Qingfeng, on the other hand, was in a miserable state. He had to face the attacks of the five blood underworld messengers at the same time, But he could only barely hold on. In the end, he used up a lot of divine power and had less than 30% of it left.

As for the Ninth Kalpa King, he had suffered a sneak attack from the Ruler Silver Roc.

“Silver Roc!”

The Ninth Kalpa King gritted his teeth and clenched his fists. His face was extremely gloomy.

In fact, he had tried to find the Ruler Silver Roc before, but the Ruler Silver Roc was very clever and had approached him without a sound. At that time, he had just obtained the godly medicine and was in a hurry to leave. He had not noticed it for a while, so the Silver Roc had gotten it.

The Silver Roc’s move had indeed caused him quite a bit of damage.

“What a terrifying poison!”

The Ninth Kalpa King’s entire body was already drenched in sweat. He had been fleeing all this while and had only relied on his divine power to forcibly resist the corrosion of the poison.

However, now that he had stopped and wanted to figure out the poison, he realized that it was far more terrifying than he had imagined.

“This definitely isn’t Ruler-level poison. If I’m not mistaken, this should have been concocted by an Supreme-level poison master.” The Ninth Kalpa King said in a low voice.

“Supreme-level poison?” Jian Wushuang was also shocked.

He had once relied on that special venom to kill his enemies, so he was well aware of how terrifying it was.

Under normal circumstances, if a Ruler had reached the peak of the art of poison, the poison they concocted would be able to threaten the top and even the invincible Ultimate Rulers.

If it was a poison concocted by a Supreme-being poison master, it would also be able to threaten a Supreme-being of the same rank.

What the Ninth Kalpa King was suffering from now was a poison of this level.

“It’s too terrifying. I’ve used up almost 40% of my divine power, but the poison hasn’t been completely removed.” The Ninth Kalpa King exclaimed.

Jian Wushuang also gasped.

The Ninth Kalpa King was a perfect life form. Although his divine body was not as shocking as his, which was 68000 miles tall, the divine power he possessed was definitely 1000 or even 10000 times more than that of an ordinary ultimate Dominator. Even so, in order to resist the corrosion of the poison, he had used up nearly 40% of his divine power.

And the poison was not completely removed?

It could be seen how powerful the poison was.

“Ninth Kalpa King, is that a problem?” Jian Wushuang looked at Ninth Kalpa King.

“Fortunately, it’s me. My divine power is comparable to a Supreme’s and can resist this venom head-on. Moreover, my divine power is thousands or even tens of thousands of times more vast than ordinary cultivators. Otherwise…” Ninth Kalpa King shook his head gently.

Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh of relief.

It was obvious that the Ninth Kalpa King was still able to completely remove the poison.

“This time, I’ve really lost half my life.”

Divine Marquis Qingfeng said with a bitter smile. His divine body was on the verge of collapse, but his face was a little rosier. It would take him at least 1000 years to fully recover. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. Ninth Kalpa King and Divine Marquis Qingfeng were more miserable, so they did not suffer much losses.

Moreover, in the battle just now, not only had he fought with Qing Xuzi, a supreme Ultimate Ruler, and tested his strength, but he had also obtained a Nine-Leaf Sword Grass. It was a huge gain.
