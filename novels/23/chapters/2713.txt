Chapter 2714: A Visit

Star Fort had been completely taken over by the Sword Alliance.

There was some trouble during the annexation process as the Star Fort had such a big territory which attracted the interest of many forces. However, those who coveted the territories were some second-rated forces with none from first-rate.

Therefore, there was no need for Jian Wushuang to take action toward those second-rated forces. The Divine Sword Army under Old Snake’s leadership was sufficient to easily get rid of them.

Most second-rated forces did not have a Grand Ultimate God who personally attended to them after all.

Jian Wushuang gradually calmed down after taking over Star Fort.

He needed some time to slowly digest and increase his strength.

Dragon City was still the Sword Alliance’s liar.

A thin elder had already appeared in the void above the Dragon City.

“The Sword Alliance Master is in that city?” The thin elder looked at the huge black-colored fort from above the void as he slowly descended downward with an indifferent smile on his face.

The thin elder was stopped by several guards at the fort’s entrance as soon as he arrived.

“Please send somebody to announce that the Devilish Wind King is here to pay Alliance Master Su Han a visit.” The thin elder smiled while exposing his divine power.

The guards at the entrance were shocked when they felt his wave of divine power. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Mister, please hold on as we immediately go in and make the announcement.” One of the guards immediately entered to make the report.

In the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang had been sitting there with both Fengtian Scrolls opened in front of him.

His meditating speed was much faster compared to previously as he borrowed both Fengtian Scrolls during his meditation.

“My understanding towards the first stage Transmigration Law has reached an exceptional state since long ago and I’m only one step away from the second stage. However, after meditating with both Fengtian Scrolls during this period, I feel I’ll be able to achieve the second level Transmigration Law soon,” mumbled Jian Wushuang as he was secretly happy about this.

At this moment...

“Master, master!” Xiao Tiexin’s voice could be heard from outside the secret chamber and interrupted Jian Wushuang’s meditation.

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and looked towards the door. “Xin’er, what is it?”

“Master, somebody who addresses himself as Devilish Wind King is asking to meet you. Apart from that, he seems to be a Grand Ultimate God from the divine power he revealed,” said Xiao Tiexin.

Jian Wushuang’s facial expression changed as he realized Xiao Tiexin’s reason for interrupting him while he was meditating in retreat.

It turns out a Grand Ultimate God was there to personally visit him.

“Devilish Wind King?” Jian Wushuang squinted slightly as he had never heard of that name. However, Old Snake should know who that was.

Jian Wushuang immediately sent a message to Old Snake.

Jian Wushuang had previously ordered Old Snake to lead the Divine Sword Army and take over Star Fort. Although Star Fort had been taken over at that moment, their territories were not completely under the Sword Alliance’s control yet, hence Old Snake had remained there.

Old Snake quickly responded after receiving Jian Wushuang’s message, “Devilish Wind King? I know about him and had once interacted with him. He’s also a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God whose power can only be considered common among Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods. However, he’s very cunning and good at preserving his own life. The Devilish Wind King can be considered one of the hardest to deal with among the lone experts that travel in the Danyang Continent.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang’s facial expression changed.

He realized from Old Snake’s words that the Devilish Wind King could be considered a representative character.

However, he had no idea why the Devilish Wind King visited him.

Jian Wushuang definitely could not turn away the Grand Ultimate King who personally visited him, so he immediately asked Xiao Tiexin to invite the Devilish Wind King into the fort.

Jian Wushuang finally met the Devilish Wind King in the Grand Hall.

“Haha... Greetings Alliance Master Su Han, nice to meet you.” The Devilish Wind King was very humble when he met Jian Wushuang and even lowered his stance.

“Devilish Wind King, you’re being too courteous. Please take a seat.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand to gesture for Xiao Tiexin and the others to leave.

Soon, only both Jian Wushuang and Devilish Wind King were left in the hall.

“I wonder why you’re personally here?” Jian Wushuang went straight to the point and asked.

“I’m here for a reason. It has something to do with Fo Yi,” said the Devilish Wind King.

“Fo Yi?” Jian Wushuang slightly squinted.

“Don’t worry, Alliance Master Su Han. I don’t have any relationship with Fo Yi so I won’t cause any trouble to the Sword Alliance due to his death. Apart from that, I won’t be able to either while you’re here even if I wanted.” The Devilish Wind King had a gentle smile on his face. “Frankly speaking, I’m here for a special item in Fo Yi’s Interspatial Ring.”

“Special item?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He subconsciously thought about the Fengtian Scroll.

However, the Devilish Wind King continued, “Alliance Master Su Han, you’ll naturally take over Fo Yi’s Interspatial Ring since you’ve killed him. I’m sure you’ve checked the ring in detail but I’m afraid you’ve missed something extremely special in the Interspatial Ring.”

“What is it?” Jian Wushuang asked without reacting much.

“It’s a common-looking small-sized broken black sword,” said the Devilish Wind King.

“A broken black sword?” Jian Wushuang relaxed slightly. He originally thought the Devilish Wind King was there because of the Fengtian Scroll. However, it looked like it was not the case.

Jian Wushuang immediately started looking for the broken black sword mentioned by the Devilish Wind King in Fo Yi’s Interspatial Ring and found it within minutes.

A broken black sword the size of his palm appeared in his palm with a flip of his hand.

“Devilish Wind King, is this the broken sword you mentioned?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, this is it!” The Devilish Wind King’s eyes burned with passion while being fixated on the broken black sword.

Jian Wushuang also noticed his burning interest in the sword.

However, he was puzzled at the bottom of his heart.

He also noticed that broken black sword when he took a look in Fo Yi’s Interspatial Ring but did not care much about it because there was nothing special about that broken sword. He even felt it was just a common item. He might not have taken that broken sword as something precious if the Devilish Wind King had not come to visit him and might have gotten rid of the broken sword together with the huge amount of supplies he had.

“Devilish Wind King, what’s so special about this broken black sword?” Jian Wushuang asked.

The Devilish Wind King took a deep inhale and said with a smile, “Alliance Master Su Han, this broken sword is not a precious item as it’s only made of common materials. Those who don’t know its true profound mystery will take it as a common item and dispose of it. However, this broken sword has a significant meaning!

“The reason is that it’s an entry token to a secret realm!!”
