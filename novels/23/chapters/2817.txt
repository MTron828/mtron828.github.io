Chapter 2818: The Anomaly!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

Elder Gu was completely stunned.

This was normal because he had indeed seen something ‘impossible’.

This was completely against the common sense of the heavenly axiom and was unreasonable.

But it had indeed happened.

After Jian Wushuang’s real soul recovered in the boundless dark void, he continued to resist the soul attack.

At this moment, a faint smile appeared on Jian Wushuang’s face.

“I heard from Elder Gu that this test is aimed at the soul. So I knew that I could pass this test. Now, it seems that it’s not very likely, but I can definitely pass it,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

The test aimed at the soul... to put it bluntly, he had to find a way to resist the soul attack that had always existed.

The soul attack was indeed potent and was getting stronger. It was almost impossible for a divine master, even an invincible divine master, to pass the test. However, it was not difficult for Jian Wushuang.

Yes, he could not resist the soul attack forever.

But he did not need to resist it. Even if the soul attack destroyed his physical soul, he could rely on his divine power to recover it completely in the next moment. Then... he could continue to rely on his physical soul to block it.

After repeating this process, to him, it was nothing more than the consumption of divine power. However, his divine power was vast and boundless. The divine power used to recover his physical soul was nothing compared to his vast divine power. Let alone recovering once or twice... even if he recovered dozens of times, it was nothing to him.

He only needed to stay in this space for six hours, and he could easily survive it.

“Although the soul impact can’t do anything to me, it does suppress my soul. So it’s just right to temper my soul strength.” Jian Wushuang smiled and began to use the soul impact. He continued to temper his soul strength.

Time continued to pass.

Jian Wushuang’s real soul was destroyed for the second time, but he immediately recovered and resisted the soul impact.

“Recovered again?”

Elder Gu, outside the void, saw this scene, and his expression was exciting.

“Monster, this kid is definitely a monster!”

“No, he can’t be called a monster. No matter how powerful a monster is, it is still within the common sense of the heavenly axiom. However, this kid has completely defied the common sense of the heavenly axiom. Therefore, he can’t be described as a monster. He should be called an outlier!”

“Yes, it’s an outlier, an outlier of the heavenly axiom. It’s filled with the heavenly axiom. Therefore, it shouldn’t exist!”

Elder Gu roared, his voice hoarse.

In the dark void, Jian Wushuang’s real soul was destroyed twice, thrice, and then restored. After six hours, Jian Wushuang’s soul had been destroyed seven times. He also recovered seven times.

Finally, after six hours, the continuous soul impact in the surroundings completely dissipated.

“Is it over?”

Jian Wushuang stood in the dark void and felt the retreat of the surrounding space-time impact, but he felt a little regretful.

He actually wanted to stay under the soul impact for a while longer. Anyway, the soul impact could not do anything to him. Instead, it gave him soul power, which had a great tempering effect. In these six hours, he clearly felt that his soul strength had increased a lot.

Unfortunately, now that the test was over, the soul impact was gone.

Buzz!

The void slightly twisted, and a space passage appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Along the space passage, Jian Wushuang appeared in the cemetery again, in front of Elder Gu.

Seeing Elder Gu again, Jian Wushuang found that Elder Gu’s expression was quite interesting.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang was not surprised.

He knew that Elder Gu should have seen his performance in the dark void just now. Although, naturally, he also saw his physical soul being destroyed again and again, which was against the common sense of heaven. It would be strange if Elder Gu were not surprised.

“Su Han, I’m more and more curious about what kind of big secret you have.” Elder Gu stared at Jian Wushuang with a bright light in his eyes.

“I do have a secret, but even if you know it, it won’t be of any use to you or even your master. On the contrary, it might even bring disaster. Believe me. I’m not lying,” Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice.

Elder Gu looked at Jian Wushuang deeply, but he did not deny it.

He knew that if Jian Wushuang could do such a thing that went against the laws of nature, he must have a world-shaking secret. Even if his master were still alive, let alone the spirit of the secret realm... even a rule master would not be able to come into contact with such a secret.

Such a big secret must have involved the highest level of the divine beginning world.

Those who were qualified to participate must be super experts at the level of Saint Realm Masters!

“No wonder you dared to take this test before. It turns out that you have a lot of confidence in yourself,” Elder Gu said.

Jian Wushuang smiled and did not comment.

If it were anyone else, they would have given up when they heard Elder Gu’s kind advice and knew that the test was so difficult and that there was a high chance of them dying.

However, Jian Wushuang was different. He was too confident in his ability.

As a perfect chaotic creature with a perfect immortal body, it was not easy to kill him? Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Not to mention that it was only a test left by a rule master, even if the rule master who created this secret realm were still alive and standing in front of Jian Wushuang, he would not be able to kill Jian Wushuang, at most, he could suppress him while he was still alive.

Because of this, Jian Wushuang was not afraid at all.

Because he knew that he would not die in this test.

“Forget it. Let’s not talk about this.”

Elder Gu waved his hand. “You survived for six hours in that space. Although you used an unusual method, you did pass the test. Therefore, according to the agreement, I can give you some of the corpse puppets in this secret realm.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up immediately. “Thank you, Elder Gu.”

“Wait here for a while. Then, I’ll go and prepare them for you,” Elder Gu said, but his figure disappeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was not in a hurry. He just waited here quietly.
