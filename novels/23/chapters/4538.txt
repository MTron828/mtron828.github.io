4543 The Almighty Awakens

Jian Wushuang’s eyes glowed.

He could see the countless Qi activities and fate energy of the Void Universe all surging toward the Void Forbidden Land.

“This… could it be that the Great Catastrophe War has begun?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

!!

Following that, a transmission from Cosmos God connected with Jian Wushuang.

“Lord Cosmos God, has the Great Catastrophe War started?” Jian Wushuang asked after taking a deep breath.

“That’s right. Void God has completely awakened and led the army of the Void Universe to attack the Divine Power Universe!”

Cosmos God’s tone had never been so heavy before.

“Then, what should I do?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Cosmos God pondered for a moment before saying, “Jian Wushuang, don’t do anything for now. When the people in the Void Universe completely let down their guard and enter the Divine Power Universe, I’ll contact you and you’ll plant the Fengtian Flag in the Void Forbidden Land to block their escape!”

“At that time, your mission will be completed, and this old man will do his best to kill them all!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Jian Wushuang could feel the killing intent in Cosmos God’s voice even though it was just a message!

After a moment of silence, Jian Wushuang nodded heavily and said, “Alright!”

Although what Jian Wushuang wanted to do most now was to return to the foreign battlefield and kill everyone to vent his anger, he knew that he had more important things to do.

In the battlefield, Jian Wushuang’s absence would not affect the situation.

However, what he was going to do next would, to a large extent, completely determine the life and death of the two universes!

“Well, Jian Wushuang, the situation is urgent, so I won’t talk to you anymore. I’ll contact you when I need you to set up the Fengtian Flag.”

After saying that, Cosmos God hurriedly hung up the transmission.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Not long after the message was hung up, the five great Grand Elders, including Grand Elder Mi Feng, Grand Elder Chen Gu, and Grand Elder Ban Shan, all soared into the sky and stood beside Jian Wushuang.

They squinted and looked up into the sky, and they all caught the invisible Qi that kept surging toward the Void Forbidden Land.

Only Elder Mi Feng let out a soft sigh.

“The Great Catastrophe War is about to start. No matter if we win or lose, we will all pay a painful price. Why bother?”

After saying this, Elder Mi Feng let out a soft sigh.

He was a rare non-warmonger in the Void Universe.

Jian Wushuang and Elder Ban Shan did not speak. They just looked at each other.

The two of them knew that the battle that would change the fate of their two universes had arrived!

…

At the same time.

In the Offworld Battlefield, Cosmos God had borrowed Jian Wushuang’s name list and had already made various plans to deal with the 34 Void Masters.

The Divine Power Universe was the main battlefield because of the Great Catastrophe. Therefore, the Divine Power Universe was several times more powerful than the Void Universe!

On this day, the entire Divine Power Universe rumbled and the Great Dao wailed. The sky was gray and heavy rain fell.

The heavy rain covered the entire divine power universe. Countless thunderbolts exploded, and silver snakes danced like lightning.

The entire Divine Power Universe seemed to have fallen into an apocalyptic world.

Countless cultivators looked up at the sky in horror. They sent out their divine power and sensed that something was wrong. However, no matter how hard they tried, they could not figure out anything.

As for the top sects in the Divine Power Universe, such as the Nine Emperor Pavilion, Cosmos Temple, and the Divine Life Palace, they all received the message from Cosmos God.

As a result, the ancient mighty figures who had fallen into deep sleep woke up one after another.

…

Divine Life Palace.

After tens of thousands of years of recuperation, the Divine Life Palace had finally recuperated.

Not only that, but Supreme Xue Bo had also broken through to the Half Invincible Supreme realm. He was now the strongest person in the Divine Life Palace.

As for Supreme Jun Fu, he had completely recovered from his previous injuries. Furthermore, his divine body seemed to have been reconstructed, and he was even more powerful than before. If he was allowed to grow, it wouldn’t be long before he broke through to become a Half Invincible Supreme.

In addition, many ordinary Supremes had died in the Divine Life Palace. For example, the Ruler Demonic Wind, who had once had a conflict with Jian Wushuang, had broken through to the Primary Supreme realm.

Moreover, perhaps because the Cosmos Palace had also suffered great losses and was busy recuperating, a large amount of new blood had entered the Divine Life Palace.

Although there were no Perfect Life Forms like Jian Wushuang and Ninth Kalpa King, there were only a handful of Special Life Forms at the Creation Stage.

It could be predicted that the Divine Life Palace would be full of vitality in the future, and all kinds of new talents would spring up like bamboo shoots after the rain.

At that time, the Divine Life Palace would reach a new peak!

Just as the second Great Catastrophe War broke out, Xue Bo, Jun Fu, and the other Supremes, who had been in the middle of a discussion in the Supreme Temple, changed their expressions. Their figures suddenly swept out and came to the empty hall.

Above the Nine Heavens, the Qi dynamic was in chaos as violent thunderbolts exploded continuously with crackling sounds. Electric snakes shuttled and danced in the gray clouds, emitting white lightning. The strong wind roared like a giant beast, as if it was roaring in one’s ears.

The faces of Supreme Xue Bo and the others immediately changed.

They were all powerhouses who had participated in the Great Catastrophe. Although they were still weak at that time and only played the role of flag-waving and cheering, they were all too familiar with this scene.

This was the result of the collision of the laws between the two universes, resulting in the fluctuations of the universe!

“Jun Fu, Tian Yi, you two are in charge of guarding the Divine Life Palace. I’ll go to the Offworld Battlefield to take a look,” Supreme Xue Bo said in a deep voice after taking a deep breath.

Supreme Jun Fu and Supreme Tian Yi exchanged a glance upon hearing this, before nodding solemnly.

...

The Great Catastrophe War was related to the survival of the universe. If it was not for the fact that the Divine Life Palace had to send people to guard it, they would have wanted to go to the Offworld Battlefield.

“Alright, I’ll take my leave then.”

Supreme Xue Bo’s expression was grave. He took a step forward and transformed into a streak of light that shot into the sky.

Before he could rush out, an ancient, vast, and gentle force gently dragged him down.

The next moment.

An aged voice rang in their ears.

“Xue Bo, you stay in the Divine Life Palace. I’ll go.”

Supreme Xue Bo, Supreme Jun Fu, and Supreme Tian Yi were momentarily stunned when they heard this voice. However, they were soon overjoyed and turned around to look.

“Lord Gai Fu?!”
