Chapter 2476: Fan Jianxian

Jian Wushuang sat down waiting with his leg crossed and the surroundings quieted down once again.

“Senior Brother Qiancheng, Elder Hanyun, and the other elders... They’re all dead?” Long Zishan stood on one side, still puzzled over what just happened.

“Senior Brother Zishan, what should we do now?” Yu Aoqing next to him looked over.

Long Zishan calmed himself down and looked at Jian Wushuang, who was sitting down cross-legged. He said with a grim face, “Wait!! I’ve already informed the sect elders. Very soon, our Great Compassion Sect experts will rush over, maybe even be the Supreme Elder! Since Jian Wushuang is staying here to wait for his doom, let’s fulfill his wish!!”

Yu Aoqing’s eyes were stern, she nodded.

However, deep inside, Yu Aoqing had doubts.

The experts from various sects around them could not kill Jian Wushuang. Jian Wushuang could clearly leave. However, he did not and chose to stay there instead, waiting for various sects to bring higher-level experts. That probably meant he wanted to fight an Ultimate God expert.

If the Great Compassion Sect only sent the Supreme Elder over, he probably could not touch Jian Wushuang.

...

Hidden in the centermost area of Wusha Wilderness—deep in the prehistoric jungle—was a gigantic sect gate.

That sect gate was the gate of the Great Compassion Sect. A person walked out slowly from the dark cave.

He looked up and gazed at the sky. The sun shone down directly on him and it was pleasantly warm.

“It’s been a long time since I looked at the sun outside,” the person exclaimed, then he disappeared in a flash.

In a split second, that person had already appeared on the high platform of the Great Compassion Sect.

“It’s the Supreme Elder!”

“We pay our respect to the Supreme Elder.”

A few First-class Divine Demons on the high platform identified him right away and bowed down to him.

“Open the spatial passage to Saint’s Tomb,” the man said in a frozen voice.

“Aye,” the First-class Divine Demons answered.

The spatial passage was opened soon after, the man did not wait another second before he stepped into the passage and disappeared.

The Divine Demons on the high platform started discussing...

“Why is Supreme Elder going to Saint’s Tomb by himself, what exactly happened over there?”

“Don’t know, but it seems to be something big. A lot of sects’ disciples were killed by a person at Saint’s Tomb, even Great Compassion Sect lost some disciples.”

“Who has the gall to kill our people from the Great Compassion Sect?”

“Whoever he is—now that Supreme Elder is taking matters into his own hands—this guy is doomed.”

The people from the Great Compassion Sect all had near fanatical admiration and confidence toward their Supreme Elders.

...

On the wide glade outside of Saint’s Tomb.

Jian Wushuang did not wait too long.

Ring!!

A spatial passage appeared in mid-air. Then, a figure slowly stepped out of it.

The experts on the glade looked at the figure, even Jian Wushuang opened his eyes to look at the newcomer.

The person was extremely thin and his face was pale as paper, but at the same time looked extremely young and rather handsome.

However, what came into sight was a head full of silver hair.

His pupils were deep as if no light could shine through. He carried a green-colored long sword on his back. He only stood there quietly after he stepped out of the spatial passage. There was no energy projecting out of him and his face was as expressionless as an ancient well.

However, it was the appearance of a man like this that made all the experts gasp.

“Fan Jianxian! It’s Fan Jianxian!!”

“The indisputable number-one sword cultivator of Wusha Wilderness, the Supreme Elder of the Great Compassion Sect!!”

“An Ultimate God has finally arrived in person. On top of that, it’s the extremely-terrifying ‘Fan Jianxian’!”

The experts trembled from the inside, admiring him with incredibly respectful eyes.

Fan Jianxian was a legend in Wusha Wilderness.

He was one who started off weak and gradually worked his way up to become an expert. When he was only a disciple of the Great Compassion Sect in his Divine Demon stage, he was already widely regarded as the number one genius of the Wusha Wilderness. When it came to natural gifts, he was absolutely on par with Tu Qiancheng. He might even be stronger and shone brighter.

His reputation resonates in every corner of Wusha Wilderness.

As he broke through different realms and finally reached the Ultimate God Realm, he disappeared from the scene. According to rumors, he went to other domains to explore and seek adventure for a while. Then, he soon returned to the Great Compassion Sect and became their Supreme Elder, stationing in the sect all year long.

Even though he had not done any fighting for years, his ability was not to be doubted!!

“Supreme Elder!!”

Long Zishan and Yu Aoqing came next to Fan Jianxian and bowed to him.

Fan Jianxian only gave them a slight glance, then in an instant, he locked his eyes on Jian Wushuang.

“Did my disciple die in his hands?” Fan Jianxian spoke, his voice was extremely aloof.

“Yes. Not only Junior Brother Pang Tao, but also Senior Brother Qiancheng, Elder Hanyun, and the other elders.” Long Zishan’s face was bloodshot, he said urgently, “Supreme Elder, you must avenge their deaths and break him into countless pieces!”

“I know what to do, you can all stand back,” said Fan Jianxian. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Long Zishan shot Jian Wushuang with a cold glance, then stepped back with Yu Aoqing.

The other experts around got the cue as well and stood far away. They were worried about becoming collateral damage in the upcoming battle.

Under the scrutiny of all the experts, Fan Jianxian walked over, step by step, until he was not more than a hundred meters from Jian Wushuang.

“So, you’re Jian Wushuang?” Fan Jianxian’s voice remained cold.

“Number-one sword cultivator of Wusha Wilderness, Fan Jianxian?” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly and stood up slowly. “I’ve heard about you for a long time and I finally have the pleasure.”

“Just recently in Anjiu Commandery, somebody recommended you to me. At that time, I gave you a chance to become my personal disciple even without knowing your actual gift in sword principles. What a pity that you declined it.” Fan Jianxian stared at Jian Wushuang calmly.

Only by hearing that, all the experts from various sects recalled that Jian Wushuang did reject Fan Jianxian.

He declined the opportunity to become Fan Jianxian’s personal disciple and went to Narcissus Island to become a regular outer disciple instead.

To a lot of people, that was an incredibly foolish move.

However, as Jian Wushuang gradually unveiled his true gift, they could finally understand why he made that choice—it was simply because he did not want to be tied up by the sect.

If Jian Wushuang did accept the invitation from the Great Compassion Sect, then Fan Jianxian and he would have been teacher and disciple instead.

Fan Jianxian and Jian Wushuang finally met each other, while the people around began to wear a strange expression on their faces.
