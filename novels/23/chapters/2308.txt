2309 Guidance

Jian Wushuang noticed that Lin Qingqing was questioning his ability.

Jian Wushuang did not mind and said, “Which sword skill does she have problems with?”

“Hazy Sword Principle,” Lin Yan said.

“Do you have a copy of the Hazy Sword Principle?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes.” Lin Yan brought out a jade bamboo strip.

Jian Wushuang took the jade bamboo strip and started reading it.

Lin Yan and Lin Qingqing stood to the side and waited.

“Brother Yan, he is the person you talked about that can solve the problem I face in my sword skills?” Lin Qingqing asked softly. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Yes, it’s him. Do not underestimate him. Even though he is young, his understanding of the Sword Doctrine is incredible. If anyone in the Lin Mansion can solve this problem, it will be him.” Lin Yan smiled.

“Really?” Lin Qingqing was still suspicious.

Lin Yan smiled and did not continue to explain himself.

The people of the Lin Mansion knew who Jian Wushuang was, but only Lin Tiefeng, Lin Yi and Lin Yan knew what he was capable of.

Lin Yan knew that there shouldn’t be anyone in the Anjiu Prefecture who could compete with Jian Wushuang in their understanding of the Sword Doctrine, much less someone from the Lin Mansion.

If even Jian Wushuang could not solve the problem Lin Qingqing had, there shouldn’t be anyone in the Lin Mansion who could solve it.

After half an hour, Jian Wushuang finally put down the jade bamboo strip.

“Show me your sword skills,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Go, Qingqing,” Lin Yan said.

Even though Lin Qingqing was suspicious of Jian Wushuang, she still listened to Lin Yan and started doing a drill of the Hazy Sword Principle.

Jian Wushuang smiled as he saw each style of the sword skill being performed by Lin Qingqing.

Before long, Lin Qingqing finished the drill. She seemed more pale than ever and even started coughing slightly.

“Brother Wushuang, do you know what is wrong?” Lin Yan asked.

“Yes. It is simple. She is not fit to cultivate this sword skill,” Jian Wushuang said upfront.

“Uncle Lin Yi told me this before. Looks like I have to give up on this sword skill and learn other sword skills.” Lin Qingqing looked at Jian Wushuang and shook her head.

It was obvious that she was trembling.

She had been practicing the Hazy Sword Principle for two years and had put in hard work to reach where she was today. Of course she would be greatly affected when she had to give it up.

Jian Wushuang then smiled again, “Actually, there is a way for you to not give up on this sword skill.”

“Huh?” Lin Qingqing looked over at Jian Wushuang, surprised.

“Brother Wushuang, stop keeping us in suspense. What is the solution?” Lin Yan asked.

“The reason why the Hazy Sword Principle is not suitable for her is because three of the styles in this sword skills are too overbearing and deadly, which causes waves of violent aura. Your cousin is a delicate young girl. She has yet to toughen up and hone herself in the outside world. After she grows up and ventures out, she will be able to control the violent aura when she becomes a more resolute lady. Then she will be able to use this sword skill without any repercussions.”

“Of course, she cannot do that now. All she needs to do is to stop practicing those three styles within the sword skil, then she will be alright.”

“That is it?” Lin Yan understood Jian Wushuang’s explanation.

Lin Qingqing was still suspicious of Jian Wushuang.

“Brother Wushuang, which three styles contain the violent auras?” Lin Yan then asked.

“The fourth, ninth and thirteenth style,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Qingqing, follow what Brother Wushuang said. Do a drill of the Hazy Sword Principle but leave out those three styles,” Lin Yan said.

Ling Qingqing followed her cousin’s instructions.

But this time, she skipped the three styles Jian Wushuang talked about.

Soon, she finished the drill and stood there, shocked.

She realised she was not hurt after leaving out those three styles.

“Were my problems really caused by those three styles?” Ling Qingqing stared at Jian Wushuang and asked.

Jian Wushuang then smiled and said, “Now the problem is solved.”

“Haha. Thanks a lot, Brother Wushuang.” Lin Yan was overjoyed.

“Thank you Older Bro...” Lin Qingqing also thanked Jian Wushuang but she did not finish her sentence.

She wanted to call Jian Wushuang her older brother, but then she realised Jian Wushuang was younger than her.

“No problem. Just call him Older Brother. If he doesn’t mind, even I will call him Older Brother.” Lin Yan laughed.

Jian Wushuang smiled and waved at both of them.

The two of them left.

Jian Wushuang dove right back into studying the sword skill he was holding.

News of this incident soon spread among the higher ups in the Lin Mansion.

The experts in the Sword Doctrine were stunned.

Many of them had known of the problem Lin Qingqing had, but none of them had had any way to solve it. All they could do was to tell her to change to another sword skill.

However, a twelve year old kid had solved it?

After they asked around, they were even more shocked when they knew that the twelve year old kid was the famous Jian Wushuang.

Many of these experts went to find Jian Wushuang for a duel.

The results were even more shocking.

Even though Jian Wushuang was young, his understanding of the sword doctrine was beyond their wildest expectations.

Li Yi had the deepest understanding of the Sword Doctrine, and he was nowhere near Jian Wushuang’s level.

After these experts who cultivated the sword doctrine found out how incredible Jian Wushuang was, many of them put down their pride and asked Jian Wushuang for guidance.

Jian Wushuang did not reject them.

He was a guest in the Lin Mansion. The Lin Mansion treated him well by allowing him to browse any secret skills or martial art skills that could be found within their library. These skills were very beneficial for Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang guiding these experts in the sword doctrine was his way of repaying the Lin Family.
