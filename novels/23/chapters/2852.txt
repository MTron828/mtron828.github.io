Chapter 2853: Dragon-Phoenix List

——

“No wonder he is known as the number one genius of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. His comprehension of the rules is so high that no one can compare to him,” Jian Wushuang thought.

Although he was a perfect chaotic creature with infinite possibilities and great potential, no one could compare to him.

However, his comprehension of the rules was obviously slower than the Young Phoenix.

“What about the Dragon-phoenix list?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The Dragon-phoenix list has been passed down by the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion for a long time. It’s an extremely special list for experts who have made great contributions to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion has been established for countless years, but only eight people have been listed on the list.”

“Each of these eight people is very important to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. They are the top eight contributors to the Dragon-phoenix list. They are recorded on the list and will always be respected by the younger disciples of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion,” Bi Yan said.

“So, the Dragon-phoenix list is the list of contributors to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

“Yes, as far as I know, the eight experts on the Dragon-phoenix list seem to be Immortal Saints who have made great contributions to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. The founder of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and the current leader of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion are also on the list. Many genius disciples of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion also take pride in being on the list in the future. Therefore, every time the Dragon-phoenix list is opened, it is a great event for the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.”

“On the way to the launch of the Dragon-phoenix list, the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion would invite many experts to watch it. It would be a very big event,” Bi Yan said. “But this time, it’s a little strange.”

“Why is it strange?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Mr. Sword One, I just said that the Dragon-phoenix list is specially opened for the Young Phoenix. Although the Young Phoenix is extremely talented and is known as the number one person in the history of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and the entire Golden Crow Nine Realms, she is too young and not very strong. Moreover, she stays in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and hardly goes out. Under such circumstances, how can she contribute to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion?

“How could she be qualified to be on the Dragon-phoenix list?” Bi Yan said.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

Indeed, in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, only those who had made great contributions to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion were qualified to be on the Dragon-phoenix list. The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion had been established for so many years, but only eight people were on it, and they were all Immortal Saints. As for this Young Phoenix… how was she qualified?

“So it’s a bit strange, but the rules of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion won’t change because of this Young Phoenix. So this Young Phoenix must have made great contributions to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, but I don’t know what the great contribution is. The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion hasn’t announced it to the public.” Bi Yan smiled.

“Maybe so.” Jian Wushuang also nodded.

“Mr. Sword One, you should be interested in that Young Phoenix, right?” Bi Yan suddenly looked over.

“What do you mean?” Jian Wushuang asked in surprise.

“Haha, Mr. Sword One, don’t pretend to be confused.” Bi Yan smiled.

“It is said that Young Phoenix is not only talented but also beautiful. In the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, not many people have seen her face, but all the cultivators of the opposite sex are impressed by her.”

“As the Young Master Qu mentioned before, he is a young master of a realm master. But because he was lucky enough to see the Young Phoenix, he has been longing for her ever since. This time, he came to my Fire Cloud Castle to ask master to refine treasures for him to win the Young Phoenix’s smile!”

“Mr. Sword One, don’t you have any interest in such a peerless beauty?”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang was stunned. “I’ve only heard that this Young Phoenix is extremely talented and no one in the Golden Crow Nine Realms can match her. As for her beauty, I’ve never heard of her. But now that you’ve mentioned it, I’m really interested in her. When the Dragon-phoenix list is opened, if I have time, I can go and take a look.”

Jian Wushuang was indeed a little interested.

But his interest was not because of the Young Phoenix’s beauty.

He had been through endless trials and tribulations in two lifetimes. His heart was like a stone, and he was completely immune to beauty.

In terms of feelings, the only person in the entire divine beginning world and the entire world who could be moved was his wife, Leng Rushuang.

He was not interested in anyone else except Leng Rushuang.

Jian Wushuang and Bi Yan chatted as they walked. They walked into the underground palace for nearly an hour before they finally arrived at the exit.

“Mr. Sword One, I’ll send you here. You’ll be in a barren mountain when you leave from this exit. It’s quite a distance from Fire Cloud Castle. No one will notice you leaving from here. As for the rest of the matter, leave it to me and master. Fire Cloud Castle will do its best to ensure that no one knows that you came to our Fire Cloud Castle to ask master to refine a treasure personally,” Bi Yan said.

“In that case, thank you.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and immediately walked toward the exit.

Bi Yan went back the way he came.

Not long after, Bi Yan returned to the main hall of Fire Cloud Castle.

In the main hall, Master Qu was still waiting.

However, although Master Qu was waiting, he could not calm down for a long time.

After all, when Mo Tao used the sacred heavenly furnace to refine the treasure, he had stayed in the Fire Cloud Castle and personally felt that terrifying sword intent.

Right now, the entire Dragon-phoenix Sacred City and even the top experts of the Golden Crow Nine Realms all knew that Mo Tao had refined an extremely powerful sword dao divine weapon.

They were all guessing who had asked Mo Tao to refine it and what kind of divine weapon it was.

Young Master Qu’s father, the world overlord Tian Qu, also directly sent a message over to ask him about it. Young Master Qu naturally wanted to find out more.

“The Fire Cloud Castle is the residence of that Lord Mo. Usually, there are too many experts who come here to visit. In addition, these experts are all received separately. Outsiders have no way to guess. However, there’s one point. Whenever those with higher statuses come to visit, they would definitely be received by Bi Yan. In fact, Lord Mo would even personally come out to welcome them. But according to the information I received, in these past hundred years, that Lord Mo has never personally appeared…”

“In other words, that person must have met Bi Yan first before Bi Yan brought him to meet Lord Mo. I didn’t know the person who let Bi Yan receive him personally before me, but there was only one person after me, and that person was Sword One.”

Young Master Qu narrowed his eyes as he muttered to himself.
