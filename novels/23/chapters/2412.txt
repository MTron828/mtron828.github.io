Chapter 2413: Crimson Stone Saint

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

On the fifth trial bridge, Su Tong’s eyes were wide open.

“Did you fail?”

There was a trace of regret in Su Tong’s eyes with a little bit of loss.

She was mentally prepared for the outcome and had also gained a lot from the trial bridge’s test, which was a good experience.

In that hidden independent space.

“29 sergeants...”

“It’s not bad to be able to get to this point, at least much better than the young men who have arrived in previous sessions.”

The vague figure slightly sighed and fell silent once again.

He made a decision after some time.

“Although you can get to this point, you are still unable to become my disciple, but I will not let you go empty-handed.”

The vague figure thought of something and a token was thrown out the very next second.

On the fifth trial bridge, Su Tong, who was about to turn around and leave suddenly stopped as a shot of light was aimed directly towards her from the end of the trial bridge.

Su Tong reached out and caught it.

“It’s a token?” Su Tong was startled and consciously glanced around with a surprised look on her face.

“It’s spear skills!”

“Two sets of spear skills!”

Su Tong was overjoyed.

The token she received had two sets of spear skills.

The two sets of skills were the first two sets of the strongest spear skills handed down by the Crimson Stone Saint.

Su Tong was extremely stoked even when there were only two of them. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Thank you, senior.”

Su Tong bowed at the light source and respectfully gave her gratitude. Su Tong bowed again seeing that there was no response before suppressing the excitement in her heart and turned around to leave.

In the hidden independent space.

“These two sets of spear skills are simple, but they should be of great use to this young lady. At least before she becomes an Ultimate God, both sets of skills will be of great use to her. Even when she becomes an Ultimate God in the future, it would still be useful to her for some time.” The vague figure smiled faintly.

He was the Crimson Stone Saint!

Of course, it was just his consciousness.

He had been staying in Saint’s Tomb for so many years. He watched a large number of talented disciples in the Wusha Wilderness enter the tomb and show their strength and talent in front of him.

His ultimate goal was to find a suitable successor for himself.

Even if the disciples failed his test and were not able to receive his inheritance, he would give away some opportunities to them as long as he appreciated their skills and talents. Just like what he did to Su Tong.

Although Su Tong failed the fifth trial bridge’s test, he still gave Su Tong two sets of his spear skills.

“I hope this young lady can grow up well in the future.”

The Crimson Stone Saint smiled faintly and his eyes finally moved away from Su Tong.

In fact, when Su Tong began her tests on the fifth trial bridge, the consciousness of the Crimson Stone Saint had been paying attention to her and did not care much about the others.

It was only after Su Tong left the fifth trial bridge that he started to look around at the others. Especially those who were wandering on the nine trial bridges.

“What?”

The Crimson Stone Saint that hid in the independent space was shocked and instantly locked on his consciousness to another trial bridge.

That was the eighth trial bridge where Jian Wushuang was.

He did not pay the slightest attention to that bridge or Jian Wushuang before, but at that moment he could clearly see what was happening on the eighth trial bridge.

“40th floor?”

“This young man who is only a Chaotic Realm has reached the 40th floor? And that was all in just one day?”

Though he was the Crimson Red Saint, it still took him by surprise to see Jian Wushuang still standing firmly on the eighth trial bridge.

Jian Wushuang was fighting against his 40th opponent within the dark space where the battle was.

On the 40th floor, his opponent’s swordsmanship had become extremely sharp and intimidating, while his understanding of sword principles was just at the Profound Sword Principle Realm.

Jian Wushuang remained calm before the formidable opponent.

His figure moved quickly along with his long sword which swept, stabbed, or charged forward under his will and command. Each movement was performed effortlessly, yet it was smooth and sleek.

He did not use any extraordinary swords skills nor did he used any of his own great technique inventions like the Time-Space Sword Technique and Reincarnation Sword Technique.

He had completely suppressed the opponent in front of him with just a couple of arm swinging movements.

Hence, he did not take long to go through the 40th floor.

Jian Wushuang entered the 41st floor.

“He is on the 41st floor and has passed half of the eight trial bridge’s tests while still being relaxed and casual. He doesn’t even use a lot of sword techniques. If I’m not wrong, he can easily pass through the first 60 floors and may even hit the 70th floor. He really is a genius in swordsmanship.” Crimson Stone Saint was amazed.

He was just admiring Jian Wushuang’s fast progress but had little hope that Jian Wushuang could completely pass the eighth bridge’s trial.

After all, the eighth trial bridge’s test would only become harder as he progressed further. Furthermore, the eight trial bridge was also the hardest challenge among all bridges.

It was much more difficult compared to the fifth trial bridge’s test that was accompanied by Crimson Stone Saint’s inheritance. A fact the Saint himself admitted.

The test on the eighth trial bridge was not set by Crimson Stone Saint himself, but by the Purple Blood Saint!

Purple Blood Saint was an extremely terrifying Undying Saint. He was much stronger than the Crimson Stone Saint at his peak in terms of strength.

He was exceptionally strong in sword principles cultivation and the Purple Blood Sword Technique that he had created when he was at his peak was a nightmare to many cultivators when he utilized its full strength.

Although the Crimson Stone Saint previously had never fought head-on with Purple Blood Saint in his life, he witnessed the scenes when Purple Blood Saint used his self-invented swords techniques to kill his enemies. Each of his direct sword thrusts sent toward his enemies had instantly killed them, causing nine powerful saints to be killed in a short time!

That terrifying strength sent Crimson Stone Saint in awe.

The tests set by such a strong expert was naturally much more demanding than the Crimson Stone Saint’s.

“It’s a pity that many tests in my old tomb area, including those set personally by the Purple Blood Saint himself, were made for the Divine Demon Realm. This young guy is just a Chaotic Realm. Had he broken through the Divine Demons Realm and got a higher understanding of sword principle, it may be possible for him to completely pass the eighth trial bridge.” Crimson Stone Saint sighed as he kept staring at Jian Wushuang from then on. He was watching Jian Wushuang’s performance on the eighth trial bridge.
