4145 The Elixir is Born

To cut off other dominators and plunder their treasures.

This is not easy to see in the universe. After all, although there are many great beings in the universe, it is very difficult to gather so many powerful Ultimate Rulers under normal circumstances.

Only now, when the Tarot Ruins appeared and restricted the entry of supreme experts, countless Ultimate Rulers swarmed over.

Because there were too many Rulers gathered, the killing became more frequent, so it became common to kill them halfway.

The reason why Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and Ruler Violet Eye chose to part ways with Ninth Kalpa King and Jian Wushuang was because of the restrictions of Ninth Kalpa King.

Ninth Kalpa King was arrogant and disdained to kill the weaker Ruler squads. He was mainly investigating the cause of the destruction of Zhufeng King’s squads, but monarch thousand leaf and the others could not help it.

Now, as soon as the four of them were freed from the restriction of Ninth Kalpa King, they immediately began to kill other Ruler squads in the Tarot Ruins.

Moreover, they gained a lot from this attack.

“Hmph, the Demonic Rain Divine Kingdom is considered an ordinary one among the many divine kingdoms in the vast universe. The expert squads they sent over only have six Ultimate Rulers. Furthermore, there are only two pinnacle-level Ultimate Rulers. With such strength, they still dare to wander around the Tarot Ruins,” sneered Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves.

“They were lucky in the past and did not encounter those powerful Ruler squads. Unfortunately, now that they have encountered the four of us, they will immediately be defeated,” said Violet Eye with a laugh.

“Unfortunately, we were unable to keep eight cloud fiend master. He is the leader of the six-man squad of the Fiendrain Divine Kingdom, a Pinnacle Omega Ruler. Over the past ten thousand years, many of the benefits they have gained in the Tarot Ruins have probably been focused on him,” said Ruler Nine Yang.

“There’s nothing we can do. Although Eight Cloud Fiend Master is only a Pinnacle Omega Ruler and his strength is far inferior to Violet Eye and me, his ability to survive is not too weak. Even if I were to join forces with Violet Eye, it would be very difficult to kill him,” said Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves.

“Unfortunately, Divine Marquis Qingfeng is not with us. Otherwise, with his entanglement techniques, there is a chance of keeping Eight Cloud Demon Master here,” said Violet Eye.

“Qingfeng? Hmph!” Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves snorted coldly.

Divine Marquis Qingfeng was only at the pinnacle Ultimate Ruler level, but he was best at entanglement techniques. In terms of entanglement, neither Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves nor Violet Eye was a match for Divine Marquis Qingfeng.

If Divine Marquis Qingfeng was with them, they were very confident that they could keep Eight Cloud Demon Master.

“Qingfeng is an idiot. If he is willing to follow Ninth Kalpa King, then let him continue. Jian Wushuang is just a fourth-level Ruler. He is not even a cannon fodder in the Tarot Ruins. If he follows us, we might be able to give him some benefits, but he wants to follow Ninth Kalpa King… Humph, with Ninth Kalpa King’s arrogant and overbearing character, even if he really gets an opportunity, how could he be part of it?” Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves said with a sneer.

The violet-eyed Ruler and the other two looked at each other and nodded.

Indeed, there was a reason why they had chosen to leave. The reason was because the Ninth Kalpa King was extremely overbearing. If they followed the Ninth Kalpa King, even if they were to obtain some great fortune, they might not be able to reap any benefits, thus, it was better for them to part ways with the Ninth Kalpa King. It would be better for them to go their own ways.

“Ignore them. Let’s continue exploring the Tarot Ruins. With our strength, there’s nothing to be afraid of if we join forces as long as we do not encounter a Ruler team from a top faction in the universe. Furthermore, even if we do encounter such a powerhouse team, the four of us will be able to protect ourselves if we join forces,” said Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves.

Immediately, the four of them continued exploring the Tarot Ruins.

In a flash, 50 years had passed.

During these 50 years, Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and Company had been raiding other Ruler squads in the ruins. With the four of them working together, many weaker Ruler squads had suffered.

Of course, although the four of them were raiding everywhere, they were also raiding targets. For example, Rulers from large cosmic factions or powerful and famous Ultimate Rulers, they would not easily provoke them.

With the four of them working together, there were few teams of experts in the Tarot Ruins who could really do anything to them. Therefore, the four of them did well in the past 50 years and gained a lot of benefits.

Interestingly, in the past 50 years, Jian Wushuang and the other two had met Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and the others once.

Of course, this encounter did not cause much of a stir. After a few words of sarcasm, they went on their own.

…

In a remote corner of the Tarot Ruins.

Ninth Kalpa King, Jian Wushuang, and Divine Marquis Qingfeng were inspecting the enchantment point that led to the second floor inch by inch.

Suddenly…

“Huh?”

Jian Wushuang, Qingfeng, and Jian Wushuang looked up at the same time.

They saw streaks of powerful long arcs rushing toward them at an astonishing speed in the surrounding void.

Ninth Kalpa King narrowed his eyes. In the next moment, his figure flashed and he was already in front of the Ruler’s team. The five people of the Ruler’s team immediately stopped.

“Who is it?”

The five people of the Ruler’s team were a little shocked and angry when they were stopped midway.

As the Ninth Kalpa King’s figure gradually condensed in front of the five, the hearts of the originally furious five suddenly trembled.

“Ninth Kalpa King!”

“Ninth Kalpa King of the Life Palace!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The teeth of the five members of the group were trembling.

This time, the Tarot Ruins had appeared, and it was a large group of powerful Ultimate Rulers in the vast universe. Naturally, some of the more famous and powerful ones were well-known.

As for the Ninth Kalpa King, he was undoubtedly one of the most famous of the many Ultimate Rulers in the universe. The five members of this squad of Rulers were naturally able to recognize him.

At the same time, they all knew the strength of the Ninth Kalpa King.

Without a doubt, just the Ninth Kalpa King alone was enough to wipe out their squad of five. They had no room to struggle at all.

Seeing Ninth Kalpa King standing in front of them, they were naturally terrified.

“Five of you, looking at how anxious you are, where are you going?” Ninth Kalpa King looked over.

Jian Wushuang and Divine Marquis Qingfeng also appeared next to Ninth Kalpa King.

Jian Wushuang also noticed that the five-man team of Rulers was moving very fast. They were very anxious, as if they were in a hurry to go somewhere.

The five Rulers looked at each other in dismay when they heard the Ninth Kalpa King’s question, the superior Ultimate Ruler in the lead said seriously, “Ninth Kalpa King, since you’ve met me, I Won’t hide it from you. We’ve just received news that a supreme-grade divine herb has appeared in Fengyang Valley!”
