“Devil Flame, what should I do now?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Master, you should be able to sense the special power contained in this life core fragment, right?” Devil Flame said.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “This power contains very rich universe principles.”

“Of course, it’s the power of the universe, and it’s a unique symbol of the Immortal Ghost. As long as the Immortal Ghost grows to the peak, he can reach the supreme-being level because his life core contains the power of the universe. By relying on the power of the universe, he can easily comprehend the universe principles.” Devil Flame smiled.

“However, the Immortal Ghost has already died and his life core has already been shattered. The life core fragment you have now should contain very little power of the universe, but it’s still very useful to you. You can choose to directly absorb the power of the universe from the life core fragment.”

“Directly absorb?” Jian Wushuang was stunned and immediately said, “That’s the power of the universe. I’m just a Principles Master. If I absorb the power of the universe, wouldn’t I be courting death?”

“Don’t worry, master. The power of the universe is indeed incredible. Even an expert at the supreme-level can’t withstand it. Perhaps those universe overlords who are already invincible among the supreme-level are qualified to think about the power of the universe. Of course, you can’t withstand the power of the universe, but you won’t,” Devil Flame said.

“What do you mean?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“In fact, it’s very simple. The cycle of the universe has its own principles. It’s impossible for people to easily master such incredible power as the power of the universe. So, master, you absorb the power of the universe in the life core. As a result, although the power of the universe is absorbed, it will immediately dissipate in your body.”

“However, the dissipation process of the power of the universe is completed in your body. Although most of the universe principles contained in it will also gradually dissipate, you can completely grasp a trace of the universe principles during this process. Master, do you understand what I mean?” Devil Flame said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. He already understood what Devil Flame meant.

It was true that the power of the universe was the ultimate power of the vast universe. It was even more sublime than the universe principles, and even supreme experts could not touch it.

But what he wanted to master was not the power of the universe, but the trace of the universe principles contained in the power of the universe.

Just like an ordinary person, it would be impossible for him to fight against an invincible army.

However, if he was asked to fight against an ordinary soldier in the army, he would have a great chance.

That was the reason.

“Yes, what I want to comprehend is just a trace of the universe principles. As for the power of the universe, it has nothing to do with me.” Jian Wushuang smiled and felt relieved.

“Master, you try it first,” Devil Flame said.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He could not completely trust Devil Flame.

Although Devil Flame said that there would be no danger in absorbing the power of the universe, Jian Wushuang felt that it made sense and was willing to try. However, he was very careful in the process of trying. If there was even the slightest error...he would immediately stop.

However, it was obvious that Jian Wushuang was overthinking.

The process of absorbing the power of the universe was very smooth and did not encounter any danger.

Moreover, after the power of the universe entered his body, as Devil Flame had said, it immediately began to dissipate. The process of dissipating did not cause him any harm.

This made Jian Wushuang slowly let down his guard, and then he began to carefully meditate.

The universe was vast and unpredictable.

The power of the universe was even more supreme. It could not even be compared to the universe principles.

The Immortal Ghost possessed some universal power in his life core because he was blessed. Jian Wushuang had only obtained a small fragment of his life core, which contained only a trace of universal power, however, this trace contained a lot of universe principles.

During the process of the universal power dissipating, a large number of universe principles contained in the universal power gradually dissipated.

Jian Wushuang could feel this process very clearly.

At this moment, he was the closest to the universe principles.

Although the level of the universe principles had descended, it was only on the surface of his body. Moreover, when the universe principles descended, he could only sense the power of the universe principles. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, this time, the universe principles dissipated from his body. Although it was said to be dissipating, it was actually breaking down and transforming into something else.

This process and the feeling at such a close distance helped him a lot.

“The universe principles, this is the universe principles?”

At this moment, Jian Wushuang directly saw the essence of the universe principles and knew how the universe principles were formed.

His understanding and understanding of the universe principles became higher and higher, and he was getting closer and closer to comprehending it.

“Soon, I will be able to comprehend it.”

Jian Wushuang was overjoyed. He could feel that he had made great progress in the universe principles.

But suddenly...buzz!

The life core fragment, which was emitting a dazzling light, shook slightly, and the light immediately dimmed. Then, with a bang, the fragment completely exploded.

The power of the universe absorbed by Jian Wushuang was immediately cut off.

Without the power of the universe, naturally, there would be no dissipation of the universe principles.

Jian Wushuang’s body completely calmed down.

“No!”

Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes and let out a roar. There was a deep sense of unwillingness in his eyes.

However, Jian Wushuang was extremely unwilling.

He clearly felt that he was about to comprehend the universe principles. It could even be said that he had already stepped into the threshold of the universe principles.

But in the end, at the most critical moment, the power of the universe in the life core fragment was exhausted.

His comprehension immediately stopped.

He was stuck there. He was infinitely close to comprehending the universe principles, but in the end, he was still a little bit off.

Yes, just a little bit away, a very, very small distance.

But without the power of the universe, this little bit was also a heaven and earth slave.

“How could this be? I’m about to comprehend it, but I’m just a little bit away.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and roared crazily. He was also extremely shocked and angry.

It was as if the heavens were playing a joke on him. He was about to comprehend the universe principles, but once he did, he would be able to reach the sky in one step. Not only would his strength increase dramatically, but he would also be able to pass the test of the second heaven of the Red Cloud World, he would also be able to grasp the Heaven Suppressing Tablet.

However, at the last moment, he suddenly stopped.
