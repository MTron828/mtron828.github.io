Chapter 5324: Shocking Change!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Qiuhuangs heart stirred, suddenly thinking that Jian Wushuang and Yang Sanmu had just gone to Liuzhou, and now Wu Zuo had also left. Could there be a problem over there?

After seeing off Wu Zuo, he quickly used his identity token to contact Jian

Wushuang.

Little guy

On Wu Zuos side!

The world spun, and once again, he found himself in Sharuo City.

However, the moment he entered Sharlow City, his entire being trembled. A powerful sense of threat furrowed his brows.

Boom!

The entire Sharuo City shook, and the Emperors outside the teleportation array rose into the air, ignoring the teleportation array and charging towards the north.

As Wu Zuo just stepped out of the teleportation array, the three teleportation arrays behind him began to collapse.

People in the city also started to flee, all heading north.

North!

In the direction of the Heaven Palace.

Where Venerable Lie Huo was stationed.

Daring to destroy even the teleportation array, it seemed that the other party had come prepared.

Arrogance!

Wu Zuo roared, soaring into the sky, looking towards the distant black mist.

This was the Qishen Temple, the base of his master Qishen. These natives actually dared to rebel.

When he was opening up territories, he slaughtered many tier 6 Emperors. Although he only sent a Law Avatar, ordinary tier 6 Emperors could hardly escape his grasp.

Hum!

In the black mist, a figure flew out, with white hair and a cold face.

It was the Bai Junwang!

After arriving in Liuzhou, he first killed the Heaven Halls Lord, Lie Huo.

Then, along the way, he destroyed all the teleportation arrays in Liuzhou.

Sharuo City was the last one.

Its you! Emperor Bai Junwangs expression changed drastically as he recognized the newcomer. However, after sensing it a bit, he realized it was just a divine body and burst into laughter.

The heavens are helping me!

If you were here in your original body, you might be able to stop me, but you cant stop me with a mere avatar!

Wu Zuos gaze changed. The other party was right.

At the pinnacle of strength, you, a dog of a fallen family, how could you enter the ranks of the pinnacle!

Bai Junwangs eyes were cold. When he heard the term dog of a fallen family, he laughed sarcastically, Arent you a dog of a fallen family too? Even the true gods have fallen. As a disciple, youre willing to accompany the old man; Ill lend you a hand!

This statement dealt a severe blow to Wu Zuo. Regardless of the equality of their strengths, he attacked directly.

Youre seeking death!

At this moment, not only did the divine body utter these words, but the true self also broke through and appeared, with a pale yellow Daoist robe fluttering in the wind.

The Elder Palace trembled.

Inform the White Tiger Temple immediately; theres a disturbance in Liuzhou! After leaving these words behind, Wu Zuos true self vanished into thin air.

Elemental Yang Lake was too far from the Northern Region in the Central State. Even if he wanted to fly there, it would take hundreds of years. However, with the teleportation array destroyed, he could only teleport to the vicinity of Liuzhou.

Crossing the entire Liuzhou was not difficult, as one day was sufficient.

It was not difficult to cross the entire Flow State. One day was enough.

This rebellion was too powerful, with pinnacle-level experts!

Besides him, there was another Elder at the pinnacle level. However, he was currently discussing matters related to the Northern Region in the White Tiger Temple and was not in the Elder Palace.

They were nowhere near the Elder Palace.

They had to notify the White Tiger Temple, only by joining forces could they suppress the Bai Junwang.

The transcendent peak strength was beyond what an ordinary tier 6 Emperor could contend with.

The avatar wouldnt last much longer.

More importantly, he didnt know what Bai Junwangs goal was.

Liuzhou!

Currently, the most peaceful place was the Shangqing Palace.

The people on the Tideviewing Pavilion looked down at the ongoing battle, drinking and tasting the unique fruits of the Shangqing Palace.

Little did they know that a terrifying existence would soon descend upon this place.

Jian Wushuang received a message from Qiuhuang.

The message was brief, only mentioning something about Wuzuo going to Liu Zhou, asking if anything had happened there.

While dealing with the Sword Leader, Jian Wushuang also sent messages to Qiuhuang.

Yongen clearly felt that Jian Wushuang was not taking it seriously. At once, his momentum erupted again.

Respected Friend, today Ill let you see what the Taia Sword truly is! Yongen extended his hands, and two long blades appeared in his grasp. When he attacked again, the power was boundless.

Even Jian Wushuang felt the pressure. After casually responding to Qiuhuang, he focused on facing the challenge.

The Sword Leaders strength was indeed extraordinary.

Heavens Punishment!

Since respect was demanded, he would give it.

He intended to defeat the opponent with the purest swordsmanship, considering it a form of respect.

Throughout the battle, he hadnt even used the Extreme Dao.

The seventh layer of the Ultimate Sword Dao, even if it was pure, it couldnt match the practicality of the Extreme Dao. The power of all things was no joke; it could even kill Emperors.

Even though only a portion of the power of all things resided within him, it was sufficient to slay those native, weak Emperors.

Rumble!

The sky roared, and the Heavens Punishment triggered the power of spatial thunder, descending from the heavens.

Yongen also sensed that aura; when he attempted to retreat, it was already too late. He could only grit his teeth and confront Jian Wushuang head-on.

He knew that Jian Wushuangs origin source was extremely powerful.

Engaging in a direct confrontation in swordsmanship disadvantaged him, but relying on his unique skills, he still had a chance.

After exchanging blows for such a long time, he had discerned quite a lot.

Jian Wushuang had always been using the purest essence of swordsmanship, while Yongen employed unique skills. The disparity between the two was significant, making him feel embarrassed.

However, this time, he had to take this sword no matter what, whether for himself or for the sect.

This one sword might be the opponents strongest move, with hopes of a comeback in the subsequent clashes.DiiSc√¥ver ùíèùíÜw storiùíÜs on no/ùíó/e()/lbin(.)com

Indeed, this sword was Jian Wushuangs most profound realization in swordsmanshipthe ultimate path, the seventh layer, crafted precisely for this purpose.

Talent and imprisonment!

In one breath, with no sword in hand, yet as if wielding a sword, there was a vast difference.

Clang!

A heavy impact erupted.

Yongens figure swept past, and both of his hands trembled. He managed to receive the sword, even breaking through in the urgency of the moment, delivering a counterstrike to Jian Wushuang.bender

Interesting! Jian Wushuang stood tall in the air, slowly turning around.

The Heavens Punishment sword strike unexpectedly failed to sever his opponent; instead, Jian Wushuang received a counterstrike.

Seeing the trembling hands of the opponent, he found it somewhat amusing.

A perfect transcendent physique isnt something easily shattered. The rebound from his physical body alone could dislocate and maim the opponents arms.

In terms of martial skills, he lost, but in terms of the origin source, he hadnt secured victory.

This piqued Jian Wushuangs interest in this person.

The Heavens Punishment sword strike was his most potent weapon, but he hadnt claimed that it was his only one.

Buzz!!!!

Around his body, a massive sword formation suddenly rose.

The Transcendent Immortal Formation!

72 of the strongest swords appeared directly around his body.

Although not entirely pure, utilizing thought power and the power of devouring, it wasnt overly unfair to the opponent.

If he used the Heavens Punishment sword strike a few more times, he could defeat Yongen, but doing so would be too uninteresting. This was a friendly match, and there was no need to be so decisive, leaving the opponent with no desire for a comeback..
