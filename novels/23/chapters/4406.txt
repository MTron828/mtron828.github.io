4408 Finally Becoming a Supreme Martial Artist

“How is it? Did Jian Wushuang survive?”

“Hurry up! Let’s see how Jian Wushuang is doing!”

“Lord Alliance leader!”

Everyone looked at each other, then flew up and rushed toward the thunderclouds that had yet to completely dissipate.

!!

Before they could reach the thunderclouds, a beam of bright light suddenly shot out from the thick dark clouds.

Just like the first ray of sunlight in the morning, it pierced through the imprisonment of darkness and brought light back to the earth.

Chi chi chi.

Immediately, more and more beams of light appeared!

In the end, the bright light tore all the dark clouds apart!

The entire sky was dyed gold by the glow of the setting sun, just like the sunset by the sea, magnificent to the extreme.

Above the ninth heaven, Jian Wushuang was wrapped in a golden light ball. His broken divine body began to recover at a speed that could be seen by the naked eye.

He closed his eyes slightly and spread his arms, as if he was hugging heaven and earth.

The bright light also dyed every strand of his skin and hair golden.

His originally delicate and ordinary appearance, under the multicolored light, also appeared as handsome as a God.

The next moment!

The stars trembled, and the world changed!

Endless celestial light sprinkled down from the sky, as if the chaos had broken at dawn at the beginning of the world, and the Qi activity surged!

Above the sky, the great path played music for him, and the earth trembled. It was as if they were all congratulating him on his breakthrough to the Supreme level.

“Today, I, Jian Wushuang, have achieved the Supreme Dao!”

An indifferent voice was heard and Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes!

In his purple-gold eyes, countless divine patterns derived from the great path flowed, and his entire person exuded a sacred aura.

All the divine power in his body was mobilized and transformed into the divine power of the Supreme great Dao!

His indestructible chaotic domineering body also began to grow stronger inch by inch!

His head of black hair became as black as ink!

Boom, boom, boom!

With Jian Wushuang as the center, waves of powerful aura burst out continuously! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

This aura was mixed with the charm of his perfect chaotic lifeform. In an instant, a feeling that made all races submit spontaneously arose!

So, so powerful!!

“It’s too terrifying! I have a feeling that Jian Wushuang can crush me to death easily!”

Countless disciples of the Sword Union were shocked to the extreme when they saw this scene. They were even more shocked when they felt the aura on Jian Wushuang.

However, the more they thought about it, the more they looked at Jian Wushuang with fanatical admiration!

In their dazzled eyes, Jian Wushuang was like a god who controlled the life and death of the world. He had walked out of the ancient chaos and once again ruled the world!

This included the Blood Wave Supreme, the nine-tribulation Lord, the Supreme Giant Axe, and the others. Their eyes were also filled with deep shock.

“The aura of Jian Wushuang…Even I feel like there’s a dagger on my back. I feel a sense of danger.”

Supreme Giant Axe took a deep breath and said in shock.

Supreme Blood Wave stood beside him and looked at Jian Wushuang. He laughed and said, “Giant Axe, he’s no longer the little fellow who needs our protection.”

After a pause, the Ruler Blood Wave smiled and continued, “He’s grown up now. He’s a giant arm that can truly take charge of everything on his own.”

Supreme Giant Axe couldn’t help but be startled when he heard this. He then laughed and sighed, “Yeah, time really flies.”

In the past, Jian Wushuang was only a Ruler of the third level and needed their protection.

But now, Jian Wushuang had unknowingly become a behemoth that could shake the universe and save the Divine Life Palace from its imminent collapse.

The Ninth Kalpa King’s face, which had always been cold, also showed a smile that he himself did not notice.

“You…how do you expect me to fight you?”

There were not many people in his life that he, the Ninth Kalpa King, could look up to. Jian Wushuang was one of them, and the only one who made him feel inferior for the first time was Jian Wushuang.

Above the Nine Heavens, among the clouds.

Jian Wushuang stood in the void, his black hair flying.

Wisps of golden light gushed into his body.

The Divine Ruler Realm had been formed!

Jian Wushuang could not help but smile as he felt the power in his body that was completely different from before.

“Is this the power of a Ruler God?”

He clenched his fist. He was more than a thousand times stronger than before.

A terrifying power that he had never felt before flowed in his body. It was a vast power that transcended all life and set foot on the peak of the universe!

Knowing that there were still people waiting for him, Jian Wushuang did not waste any time. After familiarizing himself with the power in his body, he took a step forward and walked toward the crowd.

His body didn’t seem to move at all, and he appeared in front of the Ruler Blood Wave and the others.

It wasn’t until several breaths later that the afterimages formed by the high speed of the sky slowly dissipated.

...

“Supreme Blood Wave, Supreme Giant Axe, Supreme Heavenly Dipper…”

Jian Wushuang greeted them with a nod.

The Blood Wave Supreme looked at Jian Wushuang and opened his mouth to say something. However, in the end, all the words that he had already prepared were condensed into one word.

“Alright,” he said.

He patted Jian Wushuang’s shoulder and his eyes were full of gratification and admiration.

Jian Wushuang did not say much either. The relationship between the two of them was that of a teacher and a friend. It could no longer be explained by warm words.

After that, Jian Wushuang led Supreme Blood Wave and the others toward the tyrants’ patriarch.

“Many thanks for senior White Ape’s rescue.”

Jian Wushuang first saluted the tyrants’ patriarch respectfully. He had been greatly indebted to the tyrants’ patriarch. Not only had the latter saved his life, but he had also saved the entire Divine Life Palace.

The Ruler Blood Wave and the others also wore solemn expressions. They cupped their hands and said, “We are extremely grateful to senior White Ape!”

Logically speaking, the old master of the tyrants had saved them. In terms of strength, the old master of the tyrants was an existence whose cultivation base far exceeded theirs, so they naturally had to be respectful.

...

“No need for formalities.”

The tyrants’ old ancestor clasped his hands behind his back and shook his head. He muttered, “Speaking of which, I’m an old friend of the palace Master of the Divine Life Palace. He helped me once, and I’m just returning the favor this time.”

When the Ruler Blood Wave and the others heard this, their eyes narrowed. They exchanged a glance and asked respectfully, “Senior White Ape, do you know our Palace Master?”

“We’re all from the same era, of course I know him.” The tyrant patriarch nodded.

Hearing this, the Ruler Blood Wave and the others became excited. They suppressed their emotions and asked, “Then…Senior White Ape, do you know where our Palace Master is now? How’s the situation?”

When the tyrants’ old ancestor heard this, he first narrowed his eyes and muttered to himself for a moment. Then, he sighed softly and said, “Your Palace Master is trapped in that place. I’m afraid the situation is not good. He won’t be able to come back in a short time.”
