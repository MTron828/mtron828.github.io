Chapter 1371: Luo Quan challenged Jian Wushuang

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“It is all a matter of luck!”

“Jian Wushuang just joined the Star Palace by luck!”

Why did Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao allow Jian Wushuang in?”

Many disciples felt wronged and got angry.

“Stop!”

Qu Yang reminded the arguing people, “The long-time reputation of our Lineage of Star depends on our value for real ability rather than luck. I think Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao admitted Jian Wushuang in for certain reasons.”

“Jian Wushuang must have something unusual.”

“Aha, let’s see whether he can withstand the test.” A man called Luo Quan said.

“What do you intend to do?” Qu Yang looked at Luo Quan.

Luo Quan asked people around him, “Do you guys know where Jian Wushuang lives?”

A disciple said, “In a star called Sword Star.”

“Ok, let’s go there and meet him.” Luo Quan said.

Then seven disciples went to the Sword Star.

Jian Wushuang was still in the Star River.

He had been in the Star River for four days, during which he had met many beasts, but some were difficult for him to conquer. He had caught only four, each of which was less than two meters tall and relatively weak. Jian Wushuang caught and kept them.

“They are enough for me to cultivate in the Reset Palace for a while.”

So he planned to go back.

After absorbing the power of four Meta Beasts, he went back to the Sword Star.

Qiu Yue went to him when he arrived.

“Finally you have come back, master.”

“What happened?”

“Several guests have been waiting for you for a long time.” Qiu Yue said.

Jian Wushuang frowned.

Luo Quan and other disciples now appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Hello, Brother Jian Wushuang. I am Luo Quan.”

“Hello.”

Those ordinary disciples all bowed to Jian Wushuang.

After all, Jian Wushuang was a disciple from the Star Palace.

Jian Wushuang smiled to them, “What are you coming for?”

“I have competed with the most of the Universe Gods in the Second Heaven and I like competing. May I invite you to compete with me?”

Jian Wushuang said, “OK!”

Luo Quan frowned and was a little bit worried.

He thought Jian Wushuang had accepted the invitation because he was confident of winning.

But in fact, Jian Wushuang only cared about whether he could learn and improve his abilities.

He was eager to fight with geniuses from the Lineage of Star.

“Anyone who is qualified to be a disciple from the Lineage of Star must be a genius.” Jian Wushuang felt excited to have the opportunity to battle with them.

“Come on.” Luo Quan wore a pair of blood-red gloves and was staring at Jian Wushuang, ready to fight.

Jian Wushuang also took out his Blood Mountain Sword and started to fight.

Bang!

An extraordinary power was generated by Jian Wushuang.

“Divine Shadow!”

The power of Jian Wushuang’s sword exploded. A flash of light soon multiplied into thousands of flashes.

Those flashes all rushed to Luo Quan.

The Divine Shadow was one of the three Peak Rank Two Unique Skills that Jian Wushuang had created.

“Rank Two Unique Skills”

In response, Luo Quan fought with his palms with red gloves.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Luo Quan’s power collided with Jian Wushuang’s sword, pushing back the Blood Mountain Sword.

Luo Quan generated more power.

His palms became more strong and powerful, forcing Jian Wushuang to step back.

“Show me all of your power.” Luo Quan murmured.

“Come on!”

“Blood Night!”

Blood Night was the most powerful skill that Jian Wushuang had. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He tried his best.

And Luo Quan rushed toward Jian Wushuang and generated even more power.

Boom!

A strong Soul Power directly hit Luo Quan, but didn’t affect him too much.

Bang!

Luo Quan stretched out his sharp claws, as if to tear the whole universe apart.

The claw reached Jian Wushuang. Though Luo Quan didn’t use all of his power, Jian Wushuang was hit hard. He became pale and started bleeding.

The battle ended.

“Is your power really limited to this level?”

“Any Universe God in the Second Heaven in a small sect would be better than you, let alone disciples from the Lineage of Star.”

“How could you be a disciple from Star Palace?”

“You don’t deserve it!”

Now Luo Quan showed little respect to Jian Wushuang.

The others were also indifferent.

After all, they only recognized capability.

They would respect Jian Wushuang only if he was powerful enough.

But it turned out that Jian Wushuang was weak.

“You still have eight hundred years before the Selection Battle for the Star Palace. If you are still weak by then, give your position in the Star Palace to me.” Luo Quan said indifferently as he walked away.
