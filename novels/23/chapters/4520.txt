4523 Single-Handedly Defeating the Saint

Boom!

The divine corpse of Tarot punched out with two fists. Instantly, endless power burst forth. Dao patterns circulated in his hands, turning into violent and surging Sword Qi that smashed into the chests of the two old slaves.

These two servants of the Sky Glory Holy Son had only just entered the Scar level. How could they be the opponents of the Tarot divine corpse?

This was Supreme Tarot! Even if the current Supreme Tarot corpse was only at the Piramy Supreme stage, how could they be able to contend against it?

Pfft!

In an instant, it was as if the two old slaves had been hit by two Cosmic Warships. Their bodies immediately crashed through the door of the Divine Wine Pavilion and flew out.

Whoosh.

Two black dots flickered in the sky. The two old slaves were punched by Tarot divine corpse, and they were sent flying so violently that they not only left the Dark Yin Palace, they even flew out of the entire Dark Yin Star Field!

“This!”

Instantly, the head disciple of Dark Yin, Yin Shan, who had been paralyzed with fear and was sitting on the ground, could not help but be dumbfounded as he watched this scene. His entire body trembled.

What did he see?

The Sky Glory Holy Son’s head was pressed down by Wushuang’s palm, and he was forced to kneel!

The two old servants of the Sky Glory Holy Son were sent flying out of the Dark Yin Star Field by Wushuang’s divine corpse!

This was too violent!

Then, the head disciple of Dark Yin shivered.

Something big happened!

Something big was about to happen!

“Wushuang, you’re looking for death!” The Sky Glory Holy Son’s handsome face was twisted to the extreme. He roared and activated all the void power in his body.

Suddenly, the Sky Glory Holy Son’s void power was like a high-speed Whirlpool, spinning with a loud bang. Waves of power that could destroy stars burst out from his body like a tide, rolling and surging, trying to push away Jian Wushuang’s right hand that was pressing on his head.

“Oh?”

Jian Wushuang could not help but raise his eyebrows when he felt the impact force.

As the number one heavenly pride of the Void Universe, the Sky Glory Holy Son was indeed quite capable. In terms of power, the force of the collision was not weaker than that of a Four Scar Void Warrior.

If Jian Wushuang had not broken through to the Intermediate Supreme level, he might have been in a predicament as well.

“But it’s a pity that the current you is far from enough.”

Jian Wushuang snorted and the veins on his right hand bulged. He grabbed the Sky Glory Holy Son’s head and threw him out of the Divine Wine Pavilion, smashing his body through the window.

Seeing this scene, Jiu Sha could not help but feel a little worried. “Wushuang, this person is the Sky Glory Holy Land’s Holy Son after all. We won’t bring you any trouble by doing this, right?”

“It’s fine.” Jian Wushuang shook his head and took a step forward. He appeared outside the Divine Wine Pavilion and looked down at the Sky Glory Holy Son, who had been thrown to the ground.

The commotion between the two immediately attracted the attention of all the Dark Yin Palace disciples inside and outside the Divine Wine Pavilion.

“What? The Sky Glory Holy Son was actually thrown out?”

“Who is so bold? You dare to attack the Sky Glory Holy Son?”

For a moment, everyone was shocked.

Then, they saw Jian Wushuang step out of the Divine Wine Pavilion. He was walking in the void with an expressionless face.

“It’s him?”

“The new Sect Master of the God Refining Sect?”

“Didn’t this person just break through to the Scar level not long ago? How did he manage to throw the Sky Glory Holy Son out?”

“Who knows? It’s probably a sneak attack. After all, the Sky Glory Holy Son is the number one Heaven’s Favorite expert in our universe. He’s invincible in the same realm. No matter what, Wushuang shouldn’t be the Sky Glory Holy son’s opponent.”

Everyone started whispering to each other.

“Wushuang, you lowly worm! You deserve to die!!!”

In the Divine Wine Pavilion, the Sky Glory Holy Son’s expression was twisted.

The surging killing intent almost materialized and circulated in his eyes.

He was born with pride. Whether it was his extraordinary family background or his own invincible luck, or his unprecedented talent, all of them made him develop a high and mighty attitude, and he never respected anyone.

When had he ever suffered such humiliation?

Wave after wave of hatred washed through his body. In a short moment, the Sky Glory Holy Son’s eyes turned red and he wanted to tear Jian Wushuang into pieces!

With a low growl, the Sky Glory Holy Son’s body glowed brightly and he charged toward Jian Wushuang.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang looked indifferent and said, “I’ve already said that all I need is one hand to deal with you!”

The next moment!

With his left hand behind his back, Jian Wushuang formed a fist with his right hand and punched the Sky Glory Holy Son!

This punch could shatter stars and destroy the sun, and overturn mountains and rivers!

Countless rays of golden light emitted from Jian Wushuang’s right fist. It was as if he was pushing a rolling sun or a golden carriage that was driving out of the sun and crashing toward the Sky Glory Holy Son!

Crash!

The sound of a mirror shattering could be heard in the air as ripples spread out. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Quickly retreat!”

Instantly, the many disciples of the Dark Yin Palace who were watching the show retreated and flew into the universe.

Boom!!!

...

This punch finally landed on the Sky Glory Holy Son’s body.

In an instant!

The Sky Glory Holy Son was sent flying at a speed faster than when he had charged forward. The entire ground started to shake.

However, very quickly, a dark yellow barrier of light faintly appeared in the sky above the palace. It released a restrictive power that suppressed the shockwaves of the battle as much as possible.

Otherwise, Jian Wushuang’s punch alone would have been enough to blow up the sun. The aftershock that spread out would have been enough to cause the entire Dark Yin Palace to collapse.

“Ah!”

“Wushuang, you should be killed!”

The Sky Glory Holy Son crawled up from the ground. His handsome face was twisted with madness, and his eyes were bloodshot.

He charged at Jian Wushuang again.

“You’re so stubborn.”

Jian Wushuang shook his head. He took a step forward and instantly appeared in front of the Sky Glory Saint Son as if he had teleported. His right fist struck out like a mad dragon, turning the surrounding area into a raging sea of tornadoes.

...

Bang!

The Dao patterns on Jian Wushuang’s right fist circulated and gave off a trembling sound. Like a giant axe that split the sky and earth, he smashed the Sky Glory Holy Son’s head.

“You’re the Sky Glory Holy Son, right? Today, I’ll teach you how to behave.”

…

In the Palace Master’s main hall of the Dark Yin Palace.

The eyelids of the cross-legged Dark Yin Palace Master twitched.

“Eh? What’s happening?”

He slowly opened his eyes and looked up.

Thud, thud, thud, thud!

At this moment, a disciple of the Dark Yin Palace ran in with a panicked expression.

“Palace Master! It’s bad! The next Sect Master of the God Refining Sect, Wushuang, is fighting with the Sky Glory Holy Son outside the Divine Wine Pavilion!”

“What?” Dark Yin Palace Master’s eyes narrowed slightly. Then, divine light flashed in his eyes. His gaze pierced through the netherworld void and saw the scene of Jian Wushuang beating the Sky Glory Holy Son.

“Bastard!”

Instantly, the Palace Master’s face turned ashen. With a slight movement of his shoulder, he disappeared from the main hall.
