“Run them over?”

Thank you readers!

The disciples of the Divine Life Palace behind Jian Wushuang were all shocked.

“P-Palace Master, at most, we can just stop them from boarding the ship. It’s not very good to just run them over, right?” a disciple of the Divine Life Palace stuttered.

Jian Wushuang ignored him and stared at the old man, who was the leader of the refugees, with a cold expression.

“Hehe.” The mournful-looking old man suddenly laughed.

!!

“Little Kid, tell me, how did you see through it?”

The old man slowly stood up. The grief on his face had disappeared. Instead, he stuck out his tongue and licked the corner of his mouth. His eyes revealed a touch of greed.

As the old man laid his cards on the table, the refugees behind him also stood up, their faces filled with ferocity.

“Chief, don’t waste your breath on this little kid. Just kill them all and take their Cosmic Boats!”

One of the refugees stood behind the old man and laughed sinisterly.

Jian Wushuang looked at the old man with contempt and said, “If I’m not wrong, you just robbed someone, right? The divine blood in his body belongs to someone else, so it’s hard not to be seen through.”

“Is that so?” The old man narrowed his eyes and looked down at the blood on his body. He seemed to have thought of something and said, “Just now, there was a couple who didn’t know what was good for them. All they needed to do was join us. I had no choice but to kill the man’s cultivation partner in front of him, and then I crushed the man’s divine body inch by inch. In the end, the man couldn’t bear it and self-destructed.”

The old man raised his head and looked at Jian Wushuang and Leng Rushuang, who was next to him. With a lecherous look, he said, “Little Kid, you must be a smart person. You won’t be so insensible, right?”

Before Jian Wushuang could do anything, Leng Rushuang flew into a rage. The long whip in her hand appeared out of thin air and cracked the void. It extended for thousands of miles and struck at the Elder.

“Hahaha, you little girl, you’re quite feisty.” The old man laughed and rose into the sky, revealing his cultivation.

The aura of a Half Invincible Supreme being spread out.

He flicked his finger and Leng Rushuang’s long whip was knocked away.

“A Half Invincible Supreme!”

The hearts of the Xue Bo and the others sank.

After all, with the death of Supreme Gai Fu, the person with the highest cultivation in the entire Divine Life Palace was Supreme Xue Bo, who had just broken through not long ago.

However, Supreme Xue Bo had only just stepped into the Half Invincible Supreme realm not long ago, while this old man’s aura was as deep as the abyss. Clearly, he was already an experienced Half Invincible Supreme.

Xue Bo took a deep breath with a grave expression.

“There’s no need.” Jian Wushuang shook his head, squinted at the old man, and said indifferently, “He’s just an animal.”

Then, Jian Wushuang took a step forward, turned into a sword light, and rushed toward the Elder.

The clouds within 10,000 miles were all cut open!

There was only a thin line left between heaven and earth!

“Oh?”

Feeling the bone-piercing Sword Qi, the old man was first shocked, but then he said in disdain, “You’re just an Intermediate Supreme martial artist. How dare you be so presumptuous in front of me?”

“Be careful, Palace Master!”

Supreme Xue Bo was also shocked when he saw Jian Wushuang rush over.

Jian Wushuang had been away from the Divine Power Universe for more than 10,000 years, but Xue Bo’s impression of Jian Wushuang was that he was still a Primary Supreme, and his strength was at most at the Top Supreme level.

Although Jian Wushuang had broken through to Intermediate Supreme, he was still a ways off to fight against a Half Invincible Supreme expert.

Even Leng Rushuang’s heart clenched.

Jian Wushuang had left the Divine Power Universe for far too long.

It had been so long that many people had already forgotten his combat strength.

In the entire scene, only Ninth Kalpa King had an indifferent expression. He was not worried about Jian Wushuang at all.

He knew about Jian Wushuang’s battle strength. Jian Wushuang might not be able to match an Invincible Supreme, because he had never tried it before. However, in the world, there was no existence below the Invincible Supreme that could withstand ten moves from Jian Wushuang.

Even Hell King, the most powerful Five Scar Void Master in the Void Universe, had been killed by Jian Wushuang within ten moves.

What was this old man?

“Hahaha, Junior, since you don’t know what’s good for you, don’t blame this old man for…”

The old man laughed wildly, but before he could finish his sentence, his laughter stopped abruptly.

A head was instantly separated from his neck and flew high into the air.

Then, his body shattered like a mirror that had been smashed to the ground.

“You… how did you…”

The old man’s face was filled with extreme shock as he looked at Jian Wushuang in horror.

“My Lord, I failed to recognize your might… I didn’t know that you’re extraordinary. Please be magnanimous and forgive me…”

He frantically begged for mercy.

“You’re noisy.”

Jian Wushuang stood proudly in the void and flicked his finger. Instantly, a sword light shot out from his fingertip and pierced through the man.

Swish!

In the next moment, the old man’s head exploded like a watermelon. He could not be more dead.

Supreme Xue Bo, who had been about to charge out, suddenly stopped in his tracks, and a look of shock appeared in his eyes.

“A… a Half Invincible Supreme was killed by Jian Wushuang in one move?”

As for the refugees who followed the old man, when they saw the situation, they were deathly silent.

Immediately.

“Mother of God!”

The refugees shrieked in fear and fled.

Jian Wushuang patted his waist with his right hand and the Tarot Divine Sword was instantly unsheathed. Like a white dragon, it rushed forward and killed them one by one.

A moment later, the Tarot Divine Sword returned to its scabbard.

In a flash, Jian Wushuang returned to the deck of the Cosmic Boat from the boundless void. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Supreme Xue Bo finally came to his senses. He grabbed Jian Wushuang’s arm and asked, “Palace Master, is your current battle prowess comparable to an Invincible Supreme’s?”

“I don’t know, but I think I can put up a fight.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

This was not because he was arrogant, but because he was confident.

Jian Wushuang had not only broken through to the Intermediate Supreme realm and improved his cultivation greatly, but he had also obtained all the cultivation comprehensions given by Supreme Dao Yan, the Palace Master of the Divine Life Palace.

He refined this comprehension every day, and his strength seemed to double with each day, like a boat rising with the tide.

The only reason he was not sure was that he had not had the chance to truly fight an Invincible Supreme yet.

For the time being, Jian Wushuang was far inferior to the Supreme experts like the Overlord Patriarch and Supreme Gai Fu. However, Jian Wushuang was confident that he could fight against the weaker Invincible Supremes like the Temple Master of Cosmos Temple, Supreme Hei Yu.

“Alright, let’s go.”

After a while, Jian Wushuang returned to the cabin.

The entire fleet of the Divine Life Palace continued to sail and left this place in a flash.

In the boundless starry sky, they were getting closer and closer to the extreme north where the Nine Forbidden Zones were located.
