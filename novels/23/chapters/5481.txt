Walking along, they arrived at Thirteen Niang's residence.

Seeing the teaching materials on the snowy ground in front of the door about to be buried by the heavy snow, Jian Wushuang knew she must have returned here.

He gently knocked on the door latch and saw that the light in the room was on through the crack in the door.

Sure enough, not long after, Thirteen Niang opened the door for the two of them.

Seeing that it was Jian Wushuang, Thirteen Niang was not surprised, because no one knew this courtyard belonged to her.

"What are you here for?" Thirteen Niang showed half of her face.

Jian Wushuang smiled and said, "To repay the favor!"

Then the two entered the courtyard.

It was still the somewhat dilapidated small house.

The two were silent.

But Liu San'er spoke with enthusiasm.

"Big brother, I didn't expect you to have this ability. There's a saying, how does it go? Keeping a beautiful woman in a golden house?"

Smack!

Jian Wushuang slapped him on the head and laughed, scolding, "Shut up, aren't you afraid now?"

Thirteen Niang, sitting on the edge of the bed, was stunned for a moment and asked, "Afraid? Afraid of what?"

Taking advantage of the opportunity, Jian Wushuang changed the topic and talked about their experiences after she left.

Thirteen Niang burst into laughter when she heard that Liu San'er had hit Li Si on the forehead.

"Good hit! I never liked that jerk. If I had known, I would have stayed and given him another blow!"

Liu San'er, seeing the situation, completely lost his fear. He nodded in agreement and said, "Heroes think alike. The next time I beat him, I'll make sure to call you!"

Jian Wushuang smiled without saying much.

However, the uneasy feeling in his heart became stronger.

Liu San'er and Thirteen Niang chatted amiably, but Jian Wushuang, though seemingly indifferent, was pondering how long these days would last.

Currently, he hadn't figured out the purpose of coming to this realm, and he didn't know how to escape.

Perhaps the answer was approaching; his instincts were usually accurate.

Unintentionally, a thread of Thought power emanated from the depths of his mind, a powerful force of will.

Since coming here, he had completely detached from such sensations.

Unexpectedly, today he accidentally accumulated a thread of Thought power.

Jian Wushuang felt a burst of joy in his heart and a greater sense of security.

Don't underestimate this thread of Thought power; it was enough to wreak havoc in the mortal world.

Jian Wushuang firmly suppressed this Thought power in his mind.

Now was not the time to break free; he could use this power to explore the other party's intentions.

He wanted to see what kind of purgatory this mortal world was.

They chatted throughout the night; all of them were night owls, and no one felt tired.

The next morning, Jian Wushuang instructed Thirteen Niang to inquire about the affairs of the City Lord's Mansion while he and Liu San'er waited for news.

It didn't take long before Thirteen Niang hurried back, holding a notice in her hand.

"Something's wrong, someone is dead!"

Liu San'er, sober now, became anxious again. He quickly took the notice, but he couldn't understand its contents.

Thirteen Niang pointed upward and said, "I heard from others that last night, several waiters from various taverns were killed. The blood flowed down the entire street. Also, that person you offended, Li Si, is dead too, and his death was just like those people from the tavern!"

Well, well!

Jian Wushuang now understood the origin of that unease.

Everyone related to him had died.

The waiters from the tavern were probably the ones sent to find him. Findd new ùíîtories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Jian Wushuang couldn't be bothered to listen to the ignorant remarks and took the notice from Thirteen Niang to read it.

This notice appeared too quickly!

He was the one being wanted, and he wouldn't believe it if there wasn't someone who had arranged this beforehand.

Two patches on the chest!

Jian Wushuang glanced at his own chest. Even such details were included!

Killing six people.

One steward from the City Lord's Mansion, five waiters from the tavern.

But he hadn't done anything like that. Last night, he did kill someone, but it was just a scum who sold his wife.

"What does this mean?" Jian Wushuang crumpled the notice and looked up at the sky, saying coldly, "This method is too crude!"

His words were full of disdain.

If this was all the mundane world's purgatory had to offer, then they were underestimating him.

He might as well hang himself on the crooked-necked tree on Coal Mountain.

"Big brother, are you okay?" Liu San'er and Thirteen Niang looked at Jian Wushuang strangely, feeling like he was scared silly and talking nonsense!

Jian Wushuang looked at the two and said, "You guys don't understand!"

He wanted to see how the planner behind this would react next. Now that he had a clue, he could always turn the tables when the time came.

...

Above the clouds.

The old man looked towards the mundane world, a smile on his face.

"Hmph, becoming a mortal but still can't wash away the arrogance. Let's see how long you can stay proud!"

When the mortal world was severed from the mundane, it had already been cut off.

But at that time, having ascended to Immortality, they naturally didn't care about the hardships of the mortal world.

If all these enlightened individuals were turned into mortals, experiencing the purgatory of the human realm, their arrogance would diminish.

It was precisely this thought that led the old man to arrange this test.

He wanted those cultivators to have a sense of awe in their hearts.

This would bring great benefits in the future.

Inside Qingshan City.

The constables of the City Lord's Mansion were searching the streets for the murderer.

The appearance of Jian Wushuang was known to everyone in the entire city.

This time, the City Lord's Mansion had offered a sky-high reward.

Anyone who could personally capture Jian Wushuang would receive 1,000 taels of gold, while informants would get 1,000 taels of silver.

Not only were the constables searching, but even some idle street thugs were now looking for Jian Wushuang.

For a moment, Jian Wushuang became the target of everyone.

After all, just reporting useful information could earn 1,000 taels of silver, and it was worth noting that it took a year of mining coal on Coal Mountain to earn 3 taels of silver.

In the courtyard, Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged along the edge of the room, his breath steady.

The thread of Thought power exerted on him remained suppressed deep within. For now, he wasn't in a hurry, and it hadn't reached the point of flipping the table.

If that schemer truly provoked him, he would destroy the entire mundane world.

The thread of Thought power transformed into a small sword, capable of piercing through the void. Although it couldn't destroy the space, reducing this place to ruins was well within its capability.

Liu San'er and Thirteen Niang went out to continue gathering information. When they returned at noon, their faces showed signs of distress.

"Big brother, did you really kill those people?" Liu San'er asked curiously.

Jian Wushuang neither denied nor answered. At this moment, there was no need for explanations; it was as complicated as trying to explain mud stuffed in one's trousers.

Thirteen Niang stood near the doorpost, sighing. "Stinky beggar, I never thought you'd become so valuable one day... 1,000 taels of gold!"

"How can you say that? If it weren't for you, big brother wouldn't have killed Li Si!" Liu San'er exclaimed angrily.

Jian Wushuang now harbored suspicions about these two individuals intentionally getting close to him.

When he survived the suicide attempt and was saved by Thirteen Niang, he had harbored doubts.

If not for the trace of Thought power within him, he would have silenced these two a long time ago.

Of course, armed with this hidden advantage, he preferred to let things unfold naturally and see what tricks the schemer had up their sleeve!
