Chapter 578: Jian Wushuang’s Reply

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang received lots of messages from Qing Huo and Emperor Fengxiao, who both had a close relationship with him, as well as Emperor Daofeng and Temple Master Pure Moon.

However, most of the messages came from Temple Master Black Spirit.

Jian Wushuang immediately understood the situation after reading the messages.

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, one of the three Monster Emperors, led a Monster Army here to steal my compass?”?Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He knew the compass was of extraordinary value, but he did not expect it to be so valuable that even Crystal-armored Monster Emperor would be fanatical about it and want to obtain it even at the price of starting a war with the entire human population.

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor and the experts of the entire human camp are waiting for my reply? Gee, I’m so honored,”?Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and smiled. He then headed directly towards the North Camp.

In the North camp, the human camp and the Demonic Beasts stood facing each other.

Suddenly, a man slowly appeared on the horizon.

Jian Wushuang, who wore a black robe and carried a longsword on his back, seemed to be slowly moving in their direction. Slow as he seemed to be, each step of his was hundreds of meters wide. Though he had been far away, he arrived in front of everyone in the blink of an eye.

“Is he coming?”

The crowd of experts from human camp looked toward him.

They immediately realized something. The Temple Masters especially looked at him with a little surprise.

Jian Wushuang seemed to be completely different from before.

“That boy...” Temple Master Iceberg observed Jian Wushuang, with a hint of killing intent flashing in his eyes.

Jian Wushuang, with a confident smile on his face, appeared beside Temple Master Black Spirit a moment later.

“Temple Master Black Spirit,” Jian Wushuang greeted her with a hint of humility.

Temple Master Black Spirit glanced at Jian Wushuang as her eyes slightly narrowed. Then she asked, “Did you have a breakthrough?”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Since he made a breakthrough, his Spiritual Power naturally changed, so Temple Master Black Spirit sensed it.

“Were you the cause of the confusion at the Holy Place just now?” Temple Master Black Spirit asked again.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded again.

“Good.”

Temple Master Black Spirit sighed in praise and said, “I’ve explained the situation in the message. It’s up to you now. I have to remind you that the compass is extremely valuable. You can give it to Crystal-armored Monster Emperor if you like. If you don’t want to, no one will force you.”

“I understand. Thank you, Temple Master Black Spirit,” Jian Wushuang said.

Jian Wushuang then turned to Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, who was sitting on his throne.

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor.”

Jian Wushuang stared at Crystal-armored Monster Emperor. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

As one of the three Monster Emperors, Crystal-armored Monster Emperor almost looked like a human being except for the two horns on both sides of his forehead.

“Are you Sword Emperor?” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor sat there with his hand on the armrest. He turned to Jian Wushuang with a dignified look and asked in a deep voice, “Emperor Golden Snake stole that compass from me. Is it in your hands now?”

“Yes, it is,” Jian Wushuang nodded to admit it and even took the compass out with a wave of his hand.

The compass was as large as a palm, but it was also rusty and ordinary at first glance.

Nevertheless, it aroused a fanatical look in the eyes of Crystal-armored Monster Emperor as well as Temple Master Iceberg.

This compass really wasn’t treasure, but it was a very important token. Only by virtue of this compass could they get the Ancient World Token.

“Give me the compass and I guarantee you that you and the Human Territory will remain safe and sound,” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor said eagerly.

“What if I refuse?” Jian Wushuang replied casually.

“If you refuse? Then you’ll die and the Human Territory will be at war. I hope you won’t make such a stupid decision,” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor lowered his voice.

The experts of human camp listened seriously.

Naturally, they all hoped that Jian Wushuang would make the sacrifice and hand over the compass to Crystal-armored Monster Emperor so as to avoid a war.

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, I can give you this compass, but I have a condition,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Just say it out. As long as I can do it, I won’t refuse,” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor said.

He could do anything to get the compass. A condition or two meant nothing to him.

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor had expected that Jian Wushuang would ask for some treasures or Monster Cores. Nevertheless, Jian Wushuang said casually, “Fight me. If you win, the compass is yours.”

The whole area became quiet.

Everyone present, including those gatekeepers, was stunned.

The Temple Masters, the Divine Emperors, and the thousands of Divine Generals in human camp were completely stunned.

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor was also astonished.

Even Temple Master Black Spirit turned to Jian Wushuang in surprise.

No one had guessed that Jian Wushuang would ask to have a battle with Crystal-armored Monster Emperor.

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, as one of the three Monster Emperors, was far stronger than the Monster Kings. Among the 33 Temple Masters in the human camp, only Temple Master Black Spirit was able to compete with him by virtue of some special means.

All the other Temple Masters were scared of him.

For example, Temple Master Iceberg knew very well that he was no match for Crystal-armored Monster Emperor even though he was ranked in the top three in the Monster-exterminating League.

Now, Jian Wushuang was declaring that he wanted to battle with Crystal-armored Monster Emperor who was a horrifying existence in the eyes of the Temple Masters?

“Has he gone crazy?”

“How dare he battle with Crystal-armored Monster Emperor?”

“He’s so presumptuous.”

The Temple Masters yelled in shock.

They could see that Jian Wushuang had broken through from the Saint Realm to the Cloud Realm and improved a lot, but so what?

Strong as he was, he could at most compete with ordinary Temple Masters.

As a Cloud Realm expert, Jian Wushuang would already be regarded as a monster for doing that. Was he really able to completely defy the heavens and compete with Crystal-armored Monster Emperor?

That was unrealistic.

It was natural for the Temple Masters to think like that. Under normal circumstances, it was not realistic for a Cloud Realm expert to compete with top experts like Crystal-armored Monster Emperor. Nevertheless, the Heavenly Creation Skill which Jian Wushuang had cultivated was an Inverse Cultivation method!
