Chapter 3121: Attack

——

On the battlefield, the two camps were still engaged in a fierce battle.

However, it was clear that the situation was completely under the control of the Third Prince’s camp.

At this time, Jian Wushuang, who was standing outside the battlefield, appeared in the middle of the battlefield with a sword in one hand.

“Another one is courting death. Kill him!”

As soon as Jian Wushuang appeared, two people immediately attacked him.

The two people who attacked him were very strong. One was a peak rank three True Saint, and the other was a rank four True Saint.

The two people appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, one on his left and one on his right.

“Die!”

With a shout, the two people attacked him at the same time.

But suddenly, Jian Wushuang, who was standing in the void, disappeared.

Of course, he did not really disappear. It was just that he moved so fast that he seemed to have disappeared in the eyes of the two rank three and rank four True Saints.

Buzz!

A hazy but beautiful sword shadow suddenly lit up.

The sword shadow silently appeared beside the two people. Then, without any hindrance, it directly passed through their necks.

The protective armor on the two of them was sliced apart like a piece of paper, and their two huge heads were sent flying.

The peerless sword technique…Star Dream!

Chi! Chi!

The heads were sent flying, and the Blood Mountain Sword’s evil god poison instantly entered their bodies and killed them.

“Terrifying!”

“Too powerful! A rank three Peak True Saint and a rank four True Saint were instantly killed!”

The evil master and Mirage Water, who were standing outside the battlefield, could not help but exclaim when they saw this scene.

“This…”

The Sixth Prince and the Green Prince were also shocked.

However, the scene in front of them was just the beginning. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After killing a peak rank three and a rank four True Saint, Jian Wushuang moved again.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

One after another, silver lights flashed in the battlefield like silver ghosts at an incredible speed. At the same time, blurry but beautiful sword shadows lit up one after another.

Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!

Heads were mercilessly thrown away. In just a moment, six people from the Third Prince’s camp were beheaded by Jian Wushuang’s Star Dream.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s figure flashed again. This time, he appeared behind a rank four Peak True Saint.

This rank four Peak True Saint had extraordinary strength. Even if he encountered a rank five True Saint, he could barely hold on. However, when Jian Wushuang suddenly appeared, he was shocked, especially when Jian Wushuang’s sword shadow lit up, the rank four Peak True Saint widened his eyes.

“This, this is too fast!”

“I can’t block it, I can’t block this sword!”

The rank four Peak True Saint tried his best to block this sword, but he still could not block it.

Chi!

The sword shadow still mercilessly brushed past the neck of the rank four Peak True Saint, and the rank four True Saint’s head flew out.

But in the next moment, the divine body of the rank four Peak True Saint was reassembled again.

After the divine body was reassembled, the rank four Peak True Saint looked at Jian Wushuang in horror. “It’s too terrifying. Not only did his sword destroy my divine body, but the venom contained in it also destroyed nearly 80% of my divine power in an instant. I only have 20% of my divine power left. I can’t withstand his next attack. Run!”

Without hesitation, the peak rank four True Saint turned and fled.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang frowned slightly and did not chase after him.

“Sure enough, three drops of the evil god poison can easily kill an ordinary rank four True Saint, but it’s still not enough to kill a peak rank four True Saint.” Jian Wushuang sighed.

He could only merge three drops of the evil god poison into the Blood Mountain Sword at one time, but the corrosive power of three drops of the evil god poison was not enough to completely kill a peak rank four True Saint. This was something he had experienced outside the Jade Dragon Mystic Realm, he had already experienced it when he, Xiong Tao, and the others were assassinated.

Jian Wushuang felt that it was a pity that he could not kill a peak rank four True Saint with one strike. However, the evil master, Mirage Water, and the others outside the battlefield were extremely shocked.

“Even a peak rank four True Saint could not block a strike from the Heaven Marquis!”

“It’s a pity that the level of the evil god poison used by the Heaven Marquis is still a little low. If he had used a higher level of venom, this peak rank four True Saint would have definitely died with one strike.”

The evil master and Mirage Water were mumbling.

“A rank three True Saint almost killed a peak-stage rank four True Saint?” The Sixth Prince and the Green Prince looked at each other in dismay, as if they could not accept the result.

On the battlefield, the slaughter continued.

Jian Wushuang rushed into the battlefield and instantly killed nearly ten rank three and rank four True Saint experts from the Third Prince’s camp.

Of course, the experts of the Third Prince’s camp had also caught this scene. The people of the Third Prince’s camp naturally would not allow him to continue his unbridled slaughter.

“Junior, don’t be so arrogant!”

A low shout suddenly exploded on the battlefield. A mountain-sized black-haired muscular man waved a huge ax and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

The aura emitted by the burly man was extremely powerful. He had reached the level of a rank five True Saint, and the aura was extremely violent.

“A rank five True Saint?” Jian Wushuang smiled, and a hint of fighting spirit flashed in his eyes.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang dashed out abruptly. The moment he dashed out, the star power in his body had already been activated.

When the star power was activated, his divine power aura suddenly soared.

Boom!

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were like lightning, and his momentum was overwhelming. He had already appeared in front of the black-haired muscular man.

The black-haired muscular man also burst out in an instant.

“Junior, die!”

The black-haired muscular man held the huge ax in both hands at the same time. The power of the huge ax was so strong that it seemed to be able to split heaven and earth.

Whoosh!

The ax shadow descended in a mighty and earth-shaking manner!

“Xi Xiang!”

Jian Wushuang’s body was also filled with a violent aura. He pushed his divine power to the limit and a blood-red sword light was instantly slashed out.

Bang!

A loud sound shook the heaven and earth.

The black-haired man was indeed very strong. Not only was he a rank five True Saint, but he had also created a rank five secret skill. Moreover, he was good at strength. The power of this ax was extremely powerful, let alone a rank three True Saint, even a rank five True Saint of the same level could be crushed by his ax.

Unfortunately, he met Jian Wushuang instead.

It was true that Jian Wushuang was a rank three True Saint, but his divine power had also reached the rank five True Saint level. He had also used the Xi Xiang first move, which was also a move that was good at strength, most importantly…Jian Wushuang had used the seven-star secret skill!

The seven-star secret skill had raised Jian Wushuang’s realm by half a level. He had instantly reached the limit of a rank three True Saint, or even close to the level of a rank four True Saint, and his strength had soared!
