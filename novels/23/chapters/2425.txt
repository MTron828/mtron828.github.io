Chapter 2426: The Big Fight

“Ling Dan, do you mean you want to bear the brunt of the attack? Do you think you can stop me?” Pang Tao coldly challenged.

“Well, let’s find out.” Ling Dan was not too afraid.

“If that’s the case, I’ll first maim you then kill the kid.”

Pang Tao aimed his first shot as soon as he finished speaking.

Swoosh!

A phantom-like figure swept around violently and dived down along with the emergence of a remarkable sword essence.

The sword essence dissipated far and wide as it instantly covered the entire area, just as though a huge ocean of sword essences filled the area between the heavens and earth.

Everyone was immersed within that sword essence ocean.

“This sword essence is not bad.” Jian Wushuang secretly nodded.

Just from his sword essence alone, he could see that Pang Tao’s sword principle understanding had already reached the Profound Sword Principle Realm. In fact, he had been at that level for some time and was not far from achieving Complete Sword Principle Realm.

Pang Tao’s figure suddenly appeared from the sword essence.

The moment he appeared—Slash! Slash! Slash!

Three beams of sword lights gleamed.

Those three sword light beams were dazzling. Each of them obscuring the heavens and the sun, attracting the attention of everyone present.

“So glaringly bright!”

“Are these sword lights? Why do I feel like there are three suns!”

“It’s so dazzling and very powerful!”

Many had to close their eyes as the sword light flashed and blinded their sights.

“Senior Brother Ling Dan...” Zhuo Bing’s complexion slightly changed. Pang Tao’s strength had exceeded her expectations and she was worried about Ling Dan.

“Don’t worry, leave it to me.” Ling Dan smiled confidently and stepped forward.

He flipped his palm and a rather unusual weapon appeared in his hand.

It was nearly a two meters long trident. The trident’s three prongs were extremely sharp. It exuded a faint cold light as the sword lights’ glitters reflected on its surface.

As Ling Dan’s divine power exploded out, his trident stabbed ahead and beams of divine power shot out at the speed of lighting from all three trident tips, which happened to collide with the three sword lights from Pang Tao.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Three loud noises crackled almost at the same time. As divine powers came sweeping down, Ling Dan and Pang Tao’s figures clashed into each other again.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Clang! Clang!

The sounds of wind-breaking and collisions between weapons continuously reverberated.

Both Pang Tao and Ling Dan were swiftly moving around. Those people around could only notice two ghostly figures colliding but were unable to discern their moves. Judging from appearances, those two seemed to be evenly matched.

“So powerful. Is this the strength of the Twelve Minor Kings?” The people around were awe-stricken.

Both Pang Tao and Ling Dan were First-Class Divine Demons, but being one of the Twelve Minor Kings, their combat powers were far better than an ordinary First-Class Divine Demons.

Even Jian Wushuang was secretly nodding in approval.

“Although Pang Tao is not a righteous person, he is indeed powerful. His combat powers should’ve reached the level of Peak Divine Demon Realm. He might stand a chance to win if he fights against a true Peak Divine Demon. As for Ling Dan, his strength is still a far cry from Pang Tao,” mumbled Jian Wushuang to himself.

It may seem that those two were evenly matched, but Jian Wushuang had sharp observational skills. He noticed that Ling Dan had tried his best, but Pang Tao was still going easy on him and had not even displayed his full force.

True to his observations, a scornful smile appeared on Pang Tao’s face after a while. “Ling Dan, is this just what you are capable of?”

Ling Dan’s face changed.

“You think about stopping me with this level of power? It’s ridiculous.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Pang Tao sneered. His figure that was already moving at high speeds instantly doubled upon being engulfed by the power of laws!

Pang Tao was already moving at a terrifying speed before when fighting against Ling Dan and it was already hard for everyone around to see his silhouette.

In spite of that, he still doubled up his speed!

What was going on?

In terms of speed, Pang Tao had completely surpassed Ling Dan.

Swoosh!

Pang Tao’s figure instantly burst out and was too fast for Ling Dan to react. A sword shadow quietly appeared beside Ling Dan.

“No good!”

Ling Dan’s face drastically changed. He quickly withdrew his trident to resist only to find that not only had Pang Tao sped up in his movements, but his sword moves were also much faster than before. It was too late for Ling Dan’s trident to parry off the attack.

Chuck!

A beam of sword light pierced through Ling Dan’s body. It went into his body with a huge impactful blow, which was transmitted to Ling Dan’s divine body through his battle armor.

“Puff!”

Ling Dan directly spouted a big mouthful of blood and fell into an embarrassing state.

Pang Tao smiled coldly at the sight. He wasted no time and turned towards Jian Wushuang.

Swoosh!

The terrifying speed erupted again, but it was aimed directly at Jian Wushuang this time. Ling Dan could not stop him as he had not even recovered from the last attack.

Pang Tao was aiming to kill Jian Wushuang.

Zhuo Bing was tremendously shocked by the scene, yet she immediately looked at Zhong Yi and Su Tong next to her. “Let’s join forces and stop him.”

“Okay.” Zhong Yi and Su Tong exchanged looks and both nodded solemnly.

They came from Narcissus Island and were in the same sect as Jian Wushuang. It was only natural for them to protect Jian Wushuang from Pang Tao’s attack.

Zhuo Bing, Zhong Yi, and Su Tong attacked at the same time.

All three of them were First-Class Divine Demons and were powerful in combat. Together, they were confident that they could manage Pang Tao for a while.

When Pang Tao saw the three of them taking action, he contemptuously smiled. “Such confidence.”

Boom!

Pang Tao increased his speed again by nearly 30 percent!

One should not take the 30 percent lightly as it had completely caught Zhuo Bing, Zhong Yi, and Su Tong by surprise.

Zoom!

A fierce and swift sword light cut away all obstacles in front of him.

Zhuo Bing, Zhong Yi, and Su Tong—The three First-Class Divine Demons were completely thrown aside. Though all three of them were already giving their best shot, they were still crushed ruthlessly by the sword light.

Pang Tao maintained his speed and charged towards Jian Wushuang. Nothing was in his way this time.

“I was going to spare your life initially as long as you obediently hand over those two jade slips, but now... You can’t blame me! Even if you’re a genius, you would be no different from a useless piece of log after you die!”[1] Pang Tao’s eyes were chilly.

[1] 天才(genius) and 废材 (a useless piece of log) both have the same pronunciation on the second word in Chinese, a kind of wordplay by the author. Hence, it’s a common saying to call someone gifted genius, which is 天才 and refer to someone weak as 废材.
