“Jian Wushuang, don’t waste your time with them. Just rush over,” King of Venomous Worms said in Jian Wushuang’s head.

“I share the same idea,” Jian Wushuang concentrated his gaze. As the Dao soldiers charged at him, the billowing Ancient God power flowed out. His figure grew tremendously to three meters tall. At the same time, there were heads and arms that extended from his body.

Ancient God unique skill, six heads, and twelve arms!

Each and every one of his twelve arms was holding a sword.

Besides, there were two resplendent golden lights that swept out. They were two Hong Jung Golden Swords.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang rushed forward and instantly fought with the Dao soldiers.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

There were deafening noises resonating continuously and there were Dao soldiers flying off from the impact. On the other hand, Jian Wushuang relied on the advantage of his power and strength, and also his close-combat skills to move forward in the besiegement.

In a short while… Hong!

Jian Wushuang then landed on the ancient tribe expert’s dead body.

Then, the Dao soldiers that were chasing after him stopped simultaneously and returned underground.

Jian Wushuang smiled at the sight.

“It seems that the Dao soldiers’ order is only to hinder people from getting close to the dead body. As long as the person arrives at the dead body, they will immediately stop,” Jian Wushuang said.

After barging through the obstruction of the Dao soldiers, Jian Wushuang turned to look to the highest part of the dead body, which was where the dim light was.

Jian Wushuang moved and he appeared before the dim light very quickly.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang finally saw the appearance of the dim light clearly. It was actually a human figure.

Yes, it was a human figure, but the method of existence was extremely unique.

When Jian Wushuang came before it, the human figure that looked like nothing suddenly opened its eyes and looked at Jian Wushuang with a strange gaze.

Jian Wushuang was stunned. “This feeling, is it consciousness?”

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and bowed politely, “Greetings Senior, I am Jian Wushuang.”

“Jian Wushuang?” A loud and bright voice was heard from the figure. “My name is Wu Hun, I am an ancient tribe.”

“Senior Wu Hun,” Jian Wushuang greeted again.

“I have been in the battlefield for a very, very long time. It has been so many years and you are the first to appear before me. Not too long ago, although there was someone who barged in, it’s a pity that he wasn’t capable enough to come before me,” Wu Hun smiled faintly.

Jian Wushuang understood that the person that Wu Hun was talking about should be Dao Yuan Zi.

The battlefield that he was in was sealed off from the world. Only the people in Green Fire World would wander around the battlefield. However, Green Fire World was still too weak, there wasn’t anyone who could explore places like Crimson Lightning Region. As a result, Jian Wushuang was the first person that appeared before Wu Hun after all these years.

“I passed away many years ago but only a slight bit of my consciousness remained. I wonder how the outside world is now. Jian Wushuang, tell me,” Wu Hun said.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded. He briefly told him about everything he knew that had happened after the ancient war, including the new pattern of the world.

“Ancient times? First era? Second era?” Wu Hun laughed when he heard, “That’s interesting. I never expected the world to become like this, especially the strongest expert is only Peak Chaotic Realm? The war back then seems to have had a major influence.”

“Senior Wu Hun, you should know a lot about the war in ancient times, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Wu Hun’s power in ancient times seemed to be much stronger than Dao Yuanzi’s. He definitely knew more secrets than him too.

Wu Hun shook his head slowly when he heard Jian Wushuang’s assumption, “I do know some about the ancient war but I can’t tell you. Sometimes, it isn’t a good thing to know more.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows but he didn’t force Wu Hun.

“Jian Wushuang, you have an ancient tribe bloodline in you but it isn’t complete. The purpose of your visit today should be about my bloodline inheritance, right?” Wu Hun asked.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Bloodline inheritance, mm, I do have bloodline inheritance here.”

Wu Hun said as he flipped his jade-like palm. Then, a pearl that was concentrated with blood essence appeared in his hands.

The moment the pearl appeared, Jian Wushuang could feel the Ancient God blood in him suddenly boil and shake vigorously.

There was an unprecedented desire that soared up.

Such desire was the desire for a bloodline!

“Bloodline inheritance is here. As for if you can get it, it depends on you,” Wu Hun said.

“Senior’s advice and comments are appreciated,” Jian Wushuang was extremely humble.

Wu Hun smiled and he waved his other hand. On the chest of the dead body under them, there was suddenly a resplendent light. The light was a blurry stone stele. The stone stele gave out an ancient yet magnificent aura and it was covered with a secret pattern that was complicated and unique.

“I have been in the battlefield for too long. At first, I really wanted to look for a suitable genius that was outstanding to inherit my bloodline. But as time passed, I dismissed this intention of mine. Now, I am happy enough to just pass the bloodline inheritance to someone. There’s no need for a strong, gifted talent, as long as you reach the fundamental requirements, that will do.”

“The fundamental requirement is very simple. The stone stele in front of you contains a secret skill. The secret skill is exclusive to ancient tribe, its name is Immemorial Celestial Body. It is a secret skill of body refinery. As long as you have complete ancient tribe blood, you can cultivate this. There are seven volumes in the secret skill. What you need to do now is to comprehend the first volume from the stele. Your time limit is one thousand years!”

“In a thousand years, if you are able to comprehend the first volume of Immemorial Celestial Body, I will pass my blood inheritance to you. I have already reduced the threshold to the lowest. If it was when I first passed away, the rule that I had set was for one to comprehend the first three volumes in a thousand years. If you can’t even fulfill the lowest criteria, I’d rather my bloodline disappear entirely than pass it to trash,” Wu Hun said.

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

Then, he turned around and looked at the grey stone stele that was covered in the secret pattern. He took a deep breath and sat down in front of the stele.
