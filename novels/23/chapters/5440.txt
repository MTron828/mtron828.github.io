Chapter 5439 ¬†Predicting the Future

In the years on the Grave God Mountain, Jian Wushuang had encountered many Dao Lords stronger than him.

Even in the non-Ultimate Dao, he couldn't rank in the top ten.

In comparison to the Ultimate Dao, he couldn't even enter the top 500.

Even the weakest Ultimate Dao, when the Dao merged at the seventh level, would bring about a strength comparable to his.

Facing Wan Xing's desolation, Jian Wushuang patted his shoulder and said firmly, "It's not that simple. The more uncertain things are, the less likely strong individuals will entrust them to others!"

This statement held truth.

Who would pass on their inheritance to someone who saw through everything?

Jian Wushuang felt that the most likely to receive the inheritance was Broly.

In the mural, Broly appeared savage, like a wild beast.

He resembled the King of Transformation Dao in many ways.

The King of Transformation Dao was depicted as a mountain with numerous tentacles wriggling above, sitting on the throne at the summit. He looked similar to Broly, especially the eyes, both resembling white wax.

Turning his gaze to Broly sitting cross-legged in the corner, Jian Wushuang revealed a wary look.

The power emanating from him seemed ancient and inviolable.

Having not chatted with Wan Xing for long, although they were acquaintances, they didn't have much connection.

They merely discussed a bit.

Jian Wushuang observed that Wan Xing, the once formidable Heavenly Emperor, now seemed somewhat worldly, lacking the ruthless decisiveness of the past, and even exuding a sense of twilight.

This was not good. Displaying such behavior at the peak-level tier 4 was not promising for the difficult road ahead.

If this was his performance at the peak-level tier 4, reaching tier 5 would likely be even more challenging.

However, everyone's journey was different. Take Hu Qing, for instance‚Äîadvancing to the Grand Yan Immortal in one step, then achieving the Perfected Nine Revolutions in the Original Planet. Now, Hu Qing became an Emperor after five steps, reaching the peak-level of tier 5, directly rivaling tier 6 peak-level Emperors.

This was equivalent to matching tier 6 Emperors with intact Origin Sources. DiisCoover ùíñpdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)coùíé

It seemed that Hu Qing's current cultivation realm could almost compare to Situ Nan, and their combat strength was not far apart.

Among the experts on the Dao of Transformation, besides him and Broly, the others were driven out halfway.

As for those in the Soul Dao, most were still progressing, making many regret their choice.

Nevertheless, the ability to increase real combat power was far superior to the mysteries of the Soul Dao.

Emperor Tianchan, originally just a top-level tier 6, could now reach the peak-level tier 6 with the display of the Eternal Transformation Pavilion, putting him on par with the Turtle Spirit Island Lord.

This was a qualitative change.

Island Lord Gui Ling, who chose the Soul Dao, had no change in strength after coming out but had improved in realm.

¬†One relied on transformation to compensate for the flawed Origin Source, while the other repaired the Origin Source with soul power.

In Jian Wushuang's view, their choices were not wrong.

Emperor Tianchan's strength was limited in the Soul Dao; not only did he fail to advance far, but he also couldn't repair his Origin Source, risking ultimate failure.

It was more secure to follow the Transformation Dao.

As for Gui Ling, originally a peak-level tier 6, walking the Transformation Dao would lead to the peak of the Minor Mahayana realm. His strength would, at most, reach the level of Situ Nan.

However, if he chose the Soul Dao, there was hope for him to repair his Origin Source and ascend to the supreme-peak level, even if that hope was slight; it was not something to be abandoned.

This was the tenacity of cultivators.

Never give up, never abandon.

Jian Wushuang was no different.

In the Soul Dao, several individuals were still advancing.

Leading the way was still Tongtian Buddha; Jian Wushuang was catching up to Hu Qing but couldn't yet see Tongtian Buddha's figure.

They had now ascended 60,000 steps.

The estimate was 100,000 steps.

Jian Wushuang could now see 30,000 steps ahead.

In the rear 30,000 steps, Zhen Wuyang, Situ Nan, Island Lord Gui Ling, and even Gong Miaoyi were still persisting.

Now, only eight of them remained.

Zhen Wuyang, originally in the top two, was surpassed by Hu Qing and Jiang Shang, then later surpassed them, currently ranking fourth.

For some reason, Hu Qing and Jiang Shang were counted as one person, a mystery to Jian Wushuang.

Hu Qing was only about 100 steps ahead.

Walking at the forefront, Hu Qing could turn around and see Jian Wushuang.

Although they couldn't speak in this space above, they nodded at each other from a distance.

Ding!

Powerful beings on the Soul Dao began disappearing in succession, from Gong Miaoyi to Gui Ling and Situ Nan.

In the forefront, Tongtian Buddha had reached the peak.

The Soul Dao staircase began shattering from the first step.

Zhen Wuyang was now the last, and the people behind him had all been teleported away.

Everyone began striving forward.

Entering the hall after teleportation, Jian Wushuang saw Tongtian Buddha being teleported in, indicating that he had completed the entire journey.

He also saw Gong Miaoyi.

"Jian Wushuang!" Gong Miaoyi murmured, bowing her head. She had never expected Jian Wushuang to be an Inheritor.

Watching Jian Wushuang converse with Tongtian Buddha clarified his true identity.

However, why Jian Wushuang was associating with the people from the Kui Organization was unknown to everyone.

Still, being intelligent, no one took the initiative to expose it.

"No need to be polite. I heard from Lord Wu Zuo that you were in trouble, and it was the negligence of our Elder Palace. There's no need to dwell on it." Situ Nan did not shun Jian Wushuang just because of his association with the Kui Organization.

Zhen Ling didn't care. Did he really need to speculate on it?

Then, Situ Nan's tone changed, and he handed a jade slip to Jian Wushuang, speaking gently, "This is given to you by Lord Zhen Ling!"

Jian Wushuang was delighted and quickly took the jade slip.

However, upon reading its contents, he felt a bit bitter. It was a brief message: if he wanted to go to the Grave God Mountain, he had to find his own way.

Was this a form of redemption?

Jian Wushuang sighed.

Despite the somewhat disappointing message, knowing the other party's stance eased his mind. Being able to be sheltered here was already good enough.

However, going to the Grave God Mountain without the strength of the supreme-peak was practically impossible.

Even as an Inheritor, the Guardian wouldn't let him pass, let alone the powerful Special Life Forms there.

Without merging with the Dao, he had no chance of reaching the Grave God Mountain.

In the jade slip, there was also a simple inheritance. Upon seeing it, Jian Wushuang breathed a sigh of relief. The record above detailed the experience of merging with the Ultimate Dao ‚Äì a lifeline given to him.

It was a kind of care, considering his situation.

But he should have gone to the Grave God Mountain originally!

Being captured by Bai Junwang was something he was forced into.

Alas!

Thinking about it now was futile!

Lord Zhen Ling had spoken, and he could only obediently follow.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

About ten years passed, and everyone was transported to this place.
