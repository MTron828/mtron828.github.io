Chapter 912: Before the Storm

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the secret chamber, the two Original Bodies of Jian Wushuang appeared at the same time.

After, his World Body remained in the secret chamber, meditating the Nine-province Seal on the Mountain River Map, while the Slaughter Body left the royal palace for a remote forest.

Jian Wushuang stood on the Void of the forest, staring at the sword magic weapons with mauve gleaming in them.

Organic magic weapon — One-meter Sword, 72 in total!

Jian Wushuang displayed the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation with Blood-sky Sword. He shapeshifted it into One-meter Sword, the more powerful one.

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang endless Spiritual Power seeped from his pores.

“Ninth-heaven Sword Formation, combine!”

Crash! The 72 One-meter Swords merged rapidly and combined into a mauve sword.

Although this sword was not large and a mere three meters long, its razor-sharp edge shined blindingly bright.

“Kill!”

Fueled by the killing intent in Jian Wushuang’s eyes, the sword rushed forward quickly.

The mauve glint flashed across the Void.

BOOM!

An enormous hole penetrated the center of a mountain three-thousand meters away from Jian Wushuang. The spiral hole drilled with outrageous force.

“The power is not sufficient enough, besides it consumes too much Spiritual Power. I need to improve upon it.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Jian Wushang brandished the sword formation again.

In the forest, the Slaughter Body of Jian Wushuang absorbed and practiced the Second Sword Formation.

Jian Wushuang meditated the Second Sword Formation, but it took too long to display skillfully.

The two Original Bodies of Jian Wushuang endeavored to improve their strength, making prepartions for the Selection Ceremony.

Time flied.

Three years passed.

Two days remained until the Selection Ceremony.

Deep in the royal place, in a garden covered by the restriction.

White-robed Leng Rushuang looked up at the sky and whispered, “Is the day coming?”

“Sooner or later.”

Leng Rushuang outstretched her hands. A cold breeze blew past.

“It’s so windy…”

Many profound clans resided in Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land, among them, the Xia Clan reigned the strongest along with their first overlord clan.

Except Xia Clan, only a few top clan still existed.

One of them, the Beiming Clan, ranked on par with the Xia Clan.

A grey-robed middle-aged man sat in the splendid palace of the Beiming Clan. He narrowed his eyes and rocked his chair, the man’s handsome face and delicate, short dark hair wooing the servants around him.

In front of him stood a number of black-robed men. They looked ordinary without any breath of cultivation power, but that was exactly why they looked dreadful.

All the black-robed men, radiating a particularly powerful presence, were obviously supreme experts at the level of Dao Master.

“Everything is finished, my lord.” A skinny elder from the group said.

If Jian Wushuang were present, he would recognize that the elder was Di Jing.

The only person who commanded Di Jing in Eternal World was Emperor Xiao!

The grey-robed middle-aged man!

“What about you?” Emperor Xiao asked, glancing at the purple-robed man beside him.

The man, Beiming Hao, was the leader of Beiming Clan. Although a rebellious person, he behaved in front of Emperor Xiao.

“We are at your command, Your Majesty,” Beiming Hao said humbly.

“Good,” Emperor Xiao said, nodding slightly with sparkling dark eyes like the night sky. “My power and the experts I invited, as well as Beiming Clan, is more than sufficient to wage war with Emperor Leng. Most importantly,?that?man agreed to join us.”

“That?man?”

The black-robed men including Di Jing, and Bei Minghao, faces reddened in frustration when Emperor Xiao mentioned that man.

They just dared to fight with Emperor Leng before that man agreed to join. Now they had a 30-percent chance of winning.

“A 30-percent chance is enough for us,” Emperor Xiao said, crossing his hands. “But if Jian Wushuang wins and that bitch keeps her words, we may need not intervene.”

“Just wait for the Selection Ceremony.”

Firmament Territory was only a little territory in the Eternal World.

Among all the sects and powers in Firmament Territory, the three magnates controlled the lead. Ancient Sect was merely one of the top sects.

In the palace of Ancient Sect atop a mountain, white-robed Palace Master Xuan Yi gazed up at the sky with hands behind his back.

He stood straighter than a pine.

That is, before a figure suddenly appeared behind him.

“Your Majesty, Palace Master Xuan Yi.”

He was Palace Master Destruction, one of the 12 Palace Masters of the Ancient Sect.

“According to your command, I’ve allowed our disciples to gather at Heavenly Peak Valley. Tomorrow we can begin the hunting competition.” Palace Master Destruction said.

“Oh?” Xuan Yi furrowed his brow and smiled. “The Heavenly Peak Valley must be noisy with so many people. Go and maintain order.”

“Ok.” Palace Master Destruction said, nodding in bewilderment.

To improve the strength of the disciples, the Ancient Sect hosted an unprecedented hunting competition.

It was normal to hold a competition, but strangely, all the disciples participated.

The outer disciples and inner disciples, as well as experts from the Ancient Sect, have all gone to help maintain order.

Only Xuan Yi remained.

Was it necessary for all the disciples to participate in such a hunting competition?

Despite his doubts, Palace Master Destruction asked nothing.

After Palace Master Destruction left, Xuan Yi stood alone at the peak again. He reached out and covered the heaven.

“The storm gathers…”

“Wushuang, I have already sent you the wedding gift, but you should win at the Selection Seremony by yourself. Come now, don’t disappoint me.”

Xuanyi muttered to himself in a soft voice and smiled.
