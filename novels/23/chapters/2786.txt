Chapter 2787: Unite Against Foreign Forces

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Different from the experts in the coalition force formed by the four pinnacle forces, the experts from Yin Su’er’s faction and Sword Alliance had extremely darkened expressions.

The situation right now was obviously unfavorable for them.

“For master.” Jian Wushuang appeared beside Yin Su’er and asked softly. “This is an important battle and there are quite a lot of unforeseen events. You should have predicted this so you must have reserved some backhands?”

“I prepared some but it’s still not enough for us to go up against the coalition force formed by the four pinnacle forces. After all, not only do they have lots of experts, they did not go through a huge battle just now and are still in peak condition. Our people on the other hand had gone through two continuous battles and suffered some serious wounds. Apart from that, the consumption of their divine power are quite great.” Yin Su’er said.

“I know that. However, it’s good enough that you’ve prepared some back up as I’ve also prepared some backhands.” Jain Wushuang said.

“What?” Yin Su’er looked at Jina Wushuang in surprise.

At this moment...

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Four figures came skimming over from a nearby void and appeared at the edge of the battlefield.

The expressions of the experts from both parties slightly changed when they saw these four figures.

“Yun Shan!!” Yin Su’er’s facial expression also slightly darkened.

Yun Shan’s faction had been directly defeated previously and only four out of their many experts were alive. Yun Shan was one of those four.

Following the altercation between Yin Su’er and Blood Thunder King’s factions, Yun Shan grabbed the opportunity to leave. However, Yun Shan had appeared once again at this crucial moment. After observing the divine power of those three people behind him, it was obvious that the four of them had taken the opportunity just now to heal themselves as their condition and divine power had obviously recovered quite a bit.

However, what Yin Su’er did not understand was what Yun Shan planned to do by appearing again at this moment? FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yun Shan had a darkened look on his face when he was stared at by so many experts. He glanced at Yin Su’er and a complicated look flashed past his eyes. His eyes turned incredibly cold as he turned to look towards the coalition force formed by the four pinnacle forces.

“Tian Mu, come out!!” A loud yell could be heard blasting through the sky and earth,

This blasting yell consisted of unprecedented anger and horrendous will to kill, causing many experts there to tremble uncontrollably.

“Tian Mu?” Yin Su’er frowned and immediately looked towards the coalition force formed by the four pinnacle forces. Surely, a thin elder in black robes slowly raised his head, showing a cold and weird smile on his face.

“Tian Mu!!” Yin Su’er immediately yelled with both anger and surprise.

“It’s Grand Ultimate God Tian Mu and he’s under Yun Shan’s lead. Yun Shan had always trusted him throughout the years.” Palace Keeper Si Zhen’s facial expression also changed. “What’s going on? Why is Grand Ultimate God Tian Mu among the coalition force formed by the four pinnacle forces. From the looks of Yun Shan’s action, could it be that...”

Yin Su’er and Palace Keeper Si Zhen immediately thought of a possibility.

“Haha... Yun Shan, I’ve followed you for so many years. Do you need to act like this the moment we meet?” The cold elder covered under black robes, Grand Ultimate God Tian Mu, laughed weirdly as his eyes were filled with a mocking look.

“How dare you mention that you’ve followed me for many years?” Yun Shan said coldly. “Have I treated you badly throughout the years?! How dare you betray me and the Crimson Stone Fort?! How dare you scheme against me!!!”

“Betray? That would be a wrong word to use. Yun Shan, you had always acted out with consideration of the Crimson Stone Fort even though Yin Su’er had already had the upper hand. You knew that Yin Su’er was much stronger than you yet you were still dumb enough that you wanted to rely on your own power. You deserve to be wiped out by Yin Su’er, I was only helping you.” Grand Ultimate God Tian Mu laughed mockingly.

After that, Grand Ultimate God Tian Mu glanced at Nanwu Palace Master and said with ridicule. “Palace Master, I was right. If I purposely give the game away and let Yin Su’er’s people know that I’m in contact with Nanwu Palace, Yin Su’er would definitely take action the next second.”

“It is true that we have to thank you this time or we would not know how long we need to wait for Yin Su’er to take action against Yun Shan and the coalition of our four pinnacle forces would not have obtained such an upper hand so easily. After this is over and we wipe out the Crimson Stone Fort, you will definitely receive benefits from us.” Nanwu Palace Master said with a smile.

“Thank you, Palace Master.” Grand Ultimate God Tian Mu was delighted.

After listening to the conversation among those two, not only Yin Su’er and Palace Keeper Si Zhen, even Jian Wushuang and the Grand Ultimate Gods under his lead also understood what was happening.

“D*mn it! Turns out, everything was made up by Tian Mu!” Palace Keeper Si Zhen had a darkened look on his face. “Although Great Elder Yun Shan had always been fighting with fort master, he had never borrowed the power of outer forces and had always been snatching the control of Crimson Stone Fort from fort master with his own power. I had been wondering why he would suddenly compromise with Nanwu Palace and ask them for help.”

“Turns out that Great Elder Yun Shan had never contacted Nanwu Palace and everything was made up by Grand Ultimate God Tian Mu!!” Palace Keeper Si Zhen was Yin Su’er’s right hand man and he had the clearest information about things in the Crimson Stone Palace.

Yin Su’er decided to directly take action against Yun Shan’s faction because she received news that Yun Shan’s faction was already in contact with Nanwu Palace.

Leaving her with no choice, Yin Su’er was forced to immediately take action.

The reason they received news that Yun Shan’s faction was in contact with Nanwu Palace was because of Grand Ultimate God Tian Mu.

All this time, Grand Ultimate God Tian Mu had been the one contacting Nanwu Palace and he even led the experts from Nanwu Palace to meet Yun Shan. As Grand Ultimate God Tian Mu was one of the people Yun Shan trusted the most, such actions had caused Palace Keeper Si Zhen to have misunderstood that Yun Shan was the one in contact with Nanwu Palace.

However, he only learned right now that everything was just made up by Grand Ultimate God Tian Mu.

He purposely put up an act to cause a misunderstanding on their side so that Yin Su’er would decide to immediately take action against Yun Shan.

It could be said that Grand Ultimate God Tian Mu had schemed against both Yin Su’er and Yun Shan’s factions.

“B*stard!!” Yin Su’er had a cold look in her eyes as she said the word.

“Yin Su’er!” Yun Shan spoke in a powerful voice and he had already looked towards Yin Su’er. He had a complicated look in his eyes but he still spoke up. “As we’re facing some powerful enemies, shall we put aside our differences and think of a way to work together and solve the issues in front of us? What do you think?”

“Sure.” Yin Su’er nodded without hesitation.

She also hoped to form an alliance with Yun Shan.

After all, no matter how big the hatred or how bad the fight between her and Yun Shan was, they were internal issues of the Crimson Stone Fort. No matter who won in the end, the Crimson Stone Fort was still there and only the leader was different. However, if the alliance of these four pinnacle forces had their way, the long-time basis of the Crimson Stone Fort would completely disappear.
