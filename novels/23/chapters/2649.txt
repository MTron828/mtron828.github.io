Chapter 2650: One Hundred Million Bounty on His Head

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Scorpion King happily handed him the 15 Divine Elixir Pill as promised by Crimson Stone Fort when Jian Wushuang first met him.

The Scorpion King had also extended an invitation for Jian Wushuang to join the Sacred Palace after noticing Jian Wushuang’s great talents. He tried his best to help Jian Wushuang after learning that Jian Wushuang was the person chosen by the Crimson Stone Saint and even gave Jian Wushuang 50 Divine Elixir Pill before also showing Jian Wushuang his masterstroke.

Those 50 Divine Elixir Pill and his masterstroke close-up demonstration were helpful to Jian Wushuang and he was grateful.

Unfortunately, he was helpless at that moment.

He could perhaps save the Scorpion King’s life if he unscrupulously used his life rating pressure on those opponents. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

However, Jian Wushuang knew he could not perform the life rating pressure again.

He knew the Scorpion King would be killed after he escaped, so he could only lament the Scorpion King’s death. The least he could do was to hand over the Interspatial Ring with Blood Gems to the Crimson Stone Fort Master, Yin Su’er.

“Now that everyone knows the Interspatial Ring is in my hands, the Life and Death Tower and Divine Demons Sect will come after me. Nanwu Palace and Dongfang Clan may have also gotten the news and started looking for me. As for the Crimson Stone Fort, I bet they won’t be as indifferent and also began looking for me...”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed slightly.

The Crimson Stone Fort had too many factions which were constantly in fierce battles against each other.

He had no idea how many factions there were altogether and which of them supported Yin Su’er.

Under such circumstances, he would not hand over the Interspatial Ring to the expert or go with that person even if a Crimson Stone Fort’s expert found him.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang could only think of a way to arrive at the Crimson Stone Fort’s lair by himself and meet Yin Su’er in person to hand over the Interspatial Ring.

“It seems I’ll need an escape master plan,” murmured Jian Wushuang before he soon left.

Half a month later at Longyu City!

Longyu City was an extremely unique giant city in the Northern Darkstar Territory which did not belong to any wilderness or in other words, the city that was equivalent to a wilderness itself.

In the Northern Darkstar Territory, many spatial passages could be used for spatial transmission, but most of those spatial passages were only good for short-distance transmissions between the wildernesses. There were only two larger spatial passages that could handle transmissions between stellar regions.

One of those two larger spatial passages was in the Northern Darkstar Continent which Jian Wushuang used to set off to the Narcissus Territory.

The other one was located in Longyu City.

Many cultivators were gathered in a lively tavern inside of Longyu City. Longyu City was a popular city to cultivators with some being powerful experts due to its special geographical location and the existence of a spatial passage.

“Guys, have you heard about the bounty announced not long ago?”

Several Ultimate God realm cultivators had gathered and were discussing recent events.

“I’ve heard it of course. The reward was personally issued by several top forces within the Danyang Holy Domain with the bounty being the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord. The reward amount is a hundred million Primordial Stones!”

“In addition, this reward isn’t for us to kill the Territorial Lord, but just merely provide information. In other words, all we need to do is to report his whereabouts to those top forces who offered the reward if we luckily happen to see the Territorial Lord. We’ll be paid a hundred million Primordial Stones once the information has been verified to be correct!”

“Just bumped into him, report his whereabouts...and we’ll get a hundred million Primordial Stones? My Goodness!”

“Haha! One million Primordial Stones is an astronomical number to ordinary Ultimate Gods like us. We’re talking about one hundred million Primordial Stones. It’s crazy!”

“Those top forces are so generous! I wonder how the Territorial Lord offended them.”

“I don’t know how but the Territorial Lord is in trouble now. I can’t imagine the number of people eyeing for the one hundred million Primordial Stones bounty on his head. His whereabouts will be reported to the top forces immediately as long as he dares show himself. I’m sure they’ll send someone over to kill him as soon as possible.”

Everyone in the tavern could hear them clearly as those Ultimate Gods were very loud. Some people reacted to the news with sighs while others were of course delighted.

No one noticed a chilly and aloof young man in a black robe was sitting in a corner.

This cold and aloof black-robed young man with dark skin had a trace of hostility between his eyebrows.

He seemed normal at first glance, but if some powerful expert carefully studied him using the soul power, they would soon discover that his facial muscles were a bit strange.

His facial muscles had been deliberately stretched and distorted to change his appearances.

In other words, his current appearance was a disguise.

The disguise technique was well-known but could still probably trick some weaker cultivators. The truth could only be discovered easily by powerful experts using soul power.

Would anyone deliberately activate their soul power to investigate someone without any reason in a tavern?

The true identity of the cold aloof black-robed young man was none other than the Territorial Lord everyone was talking about! It was Jian Wushuang!

“One hundred million Primordial Stones just for a piece of information. Haha, the Life and Death Tower and Divine Demon Sect think very highly of me.” Jian Wushuang was leisurely sipping a bowl of wine with a smile on his face.

His mood was unaffected by the reward.

Not counting the amount of time he had a bounty on his head in his past life, it had also happened quite a few times in his current life as well.

It happened once when he was in the Saint’s Tomb located at Wusha wilderness where many sects had jointly offered a reward for his head.

The bounty was offered with everyone being aware of his specific location and had to kill him. Meanwhile, the recent bounty announcement had caused an uproar and attracted more powerful experts.

In the end, the big world made it too difficult to locate him if he decided to go into hiding.

In fact, he was currently seated in a tavern where he was the topic of discussion but no one even recognized him.

They had his portrait and information on his cultivation level which specifically indicated he was a Peak Earth Ultimate God.

The Life and Death Tower and Divine Demon Sect would be surprised to find out that Jian Wushuang’s cultivation realm was nowhere near what they thought. He was only a Primary-level Earth Ultimate God!
