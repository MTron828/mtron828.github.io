Chapter 1287: Eighty Years!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Jian Wushuang then resided in Dayu Palace.

Whatever happened after was just like how Su Dan said.

When those inner disciples in Dayu Palace knew that Jian Wushuang resided there, they immediately came to challenge him.

“Jian Wushuang, let’s battle!”

“Jian Wushuang, I heard that your swordsmanship was extremely great, even the advanced Universe God in the First Heaven, Zhuge Qiu was killed by you with one hit. I happened to be good at sword too. Let’s fight a battle.”

“Jian Wushuang, I don’t believe that you can kill the advanced Universe God in the First Heaven with your status as a Universe Master, unless you win against my saber!”

There were too many challengers.

There were almost two to three inner disciples that visited him everyday.

While Jian Wushuang kept an open house!

Regardless who his opponent was, as long as his capability was of Universe God in the First Heaven, he would even accept the challenge of a Peak Universe God from the First Heaven.

His capability then was almost out of the running if he fought a pitch battle against the Peak Universe God in the First Heaven but he didn’t mind much.

In the countless fierce battles, whenever he come across inner disciple whose power died down, he would suppress his strength to compete against their unique skills and their techniques.

If his opponents were to be relatively on par with him, or a Peak Universe God in the First Heaven who were stronger than him, he would exert himself to the utmost during the battle!

They were merely trying to see what they can learn from each other anyway. They wouldn’t really take each other’s lives. Even if he were to be defeated by his opponents, the inner disciples who won against him would only tease him and that wouldn’t affect him much. On the contrary, he could accumulate more experience through the battles he went through!

He just got to Eternal Chaotic World and he was really lacking the experience to fight against the Universe Gods.

Besides, he was also training his swordsmanship simultaneously during the vigorous battles.

With the cultivation resource in Dayu Palace, Jian Wushuang found a way to enhance his capability.

During his time in Dayu Palace, he was never once held up. He was either fighting with the inner disciples in Dayu Palace or constantly learning using the cultivation resource there.

The time passed slowly.

In Holy Prefecture, the Universe God Jiu Hai already found out that Jian Wushuang was living in Dayu Palace.

“B*stard, that boy possesses treasures that reach the requirement of the Master of Dayu Palace?” The eyes of the Universe God Jiu Hai were gleaming with chill.

The Master of Dayu Palace passed on a message three hundred years ago. As presents to the Master of Dayu Palace, the Holy Prefecture sent many realm treasure and secret skills. It was a pity that it didn’t reach the requirement of the Master of Dayu Palace. But then, the treasure that Jian Wushuang handed in did.

“Mansion Master, Jian Wushuang earned the present of the Master of Dayu Palace and he has been residing in Dayu Palace. We have no way to deal with him.” A purple-haired Universe God in the Holy Prefecture said.

“Then, what did he exchange for with his present? Is he asking the Master of Dayu Palace to come forward to settle the resentment between him and the Holy Prefecture?” The Universe God Jiu Hai asked.

“He didn’t,” the purple-haired Universe God replied, “According to the information we obtained from Dayu Palace, Jian Wushuang used the present in exchange for an opportunity to attend a class.”

“Attend a class?” The Universe God Jiu Hai was surprised, “A class taught by the Master of Dayu Palace personally?”

“Yes,” the purple-haired Universe God nodded.

“Humph. He didn’t ask for the Master of Dayu Palace to settle the resentment between us but used it in exchange for a chance to attend a class. This Jian Wushuang is so arrogant!” The Universe God in the Nine Ocean smirked, “Luckily, he is arrogant. Then, we have the chance to kill him!”

“Go, tell Qing Yang to come here.” The Universe God in the Nine Ocean commanded.

…

Time flies. It had been eighty years.

In Dayu Palace, in the courtyard where Jian Wushuang resided, there was two figures that flew past swiftly. One wouldn’t be able to see their movement with naked eyes.

Hua! Hua!

Two shadows of swords surged in a flash and clashed against each other in no time.

At the very moment it clashed, a ray of the sword light dispersed into dozen of fine sword lights and struck like lightning.

Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!

Then, continuous clashing sounds could be heard.

Swoosh! Swoosh! The two figures appeared on both ends of the courtyard.

“Jian Wushuang, your swordsmanship is getting more and more aggressive.” A fair skinned handsome youth with thin face kept his long sword into its scabbard as he spoke with a bright and clear voice. His voice reverberated within the courtyard.

Jian Wushuang retrieved his Blood Mountain Sword swiftly and flashed a smile when he heard what the handsome youth said. He replied, “Thanks to you, Dong Men, for the lesson that you gave me previously. With the pressure that you gave me, if my swordsmanship were to remain stagnant, wouldn’t I come to a bad end?”

Jian Wushuang was joking.

The handsome youth was one of the inner disciples in Dayu Palace, Universe God Dong Men!

Universe God Dong Men was a Peak Universe God in the First Heaven and his swordsmanship was extremely high. Among the disciples in Dayu Palace, he would be in top three. He was much stronger than Jian Wushuang in terms of capability.

In the past eighty years, there were a large amount of inner disciples that challenged him in the beginning. But as time passed, there were less and less people who came to challenge him. On the contrary, he took an active role in challenging the inner disciples. Among the inner disciples that he challenged, Universe God Dong Men was the strongest of them all.

Back when Jian Wushuang had his first battle with Universe God Dong Men, he was defeated miserably. However, after they fought for many times, the time that Jian Wushuang could defend himself against Universe God Dong Men’s attack gradually grew longer. Then, although Jian Wushuang was still at disadvantage when he fought with Universe God Dong Men, the discrepancy between their capability wasn’t as vast as before.

Plus, Universe God Dong Men was good at swordsmanship too. In the process when he fought with Universe God Dong Men, Jian Wushuang was enlightened greatly.

During his eighty years of practice, his swordsmanship improved significantly too. Among, the biggest improvement was his self invented unique skills, Nirvana and Chant of Disturbance. They have been constantly improvised in the eighty years. Then, they were already peak rank one unique skill.

It was a pity that the two unique skills couldn’t be merged with his Blood Mountain Sword.

“Jin Wushuang, your capability now can almost compare favorably with Peak Universe God in the First Heaven. With such capability, theoretically, you should breakthrough and enter Universe God. Why is your God Test yet to come?” Universe God Dong Men asked.

“God Test?” Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded, “It’s not long since I made a breakthrough to Universe Master. It’d take some time before I undergo the God Test.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Is it so?” Universe God Dong Men nodded and said, “You still have a while till your God Test but my God Test is coming soon.”

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang looked at Universe God Dong Men in shock.

“Three days!”

“Three days later, my God Test will arrive!” Universe God Dong Men announced.
