“Lan’er, I’ll be leaving the Divine Land soon and may even leave the Ancient World as well. It will be quite a long time before I come back,” Jian Wushuang said to Lin Lan.

“Master, you plan to leave here?” Lin Lan was surprised to hear that.

“I can’t guide you anymore, so you’ll be on your own. This is an Interspatial Ring that contains some Sword Skills and experiences shared by some experts. It might be helpful.” Jian Wushuang handed the ring to Lin Lan.

After a moment of hesitating, Lin Lan accepted it.

“You lack experience, so, you must be careful when dealing with others in the future. Maybe someday I’ll come back. At that time, I’ll come to see you.” After saying this, Jian Wushuang smiled at her and turned away.

“Master!”

Lin Lan trembled while watching Jian Wushuang’s back.

“She has followed me for so long, but I’ve never taught her anything valuable. I’m not a conscientious master.”?Jian Wushuang sighed. When he was no longer in Lin Lan’s sight, he stopped walking forward.

“Among all the people who participated in the murder of Sword Ancestor, I’ve only killed a small number of them. I have to hurry up, find the?

rest,?and take revenge. After that, I’ll need to prepare for the Firmament Territory Feast in three years,”?Jian Wushuang pondered.

Including Blood Bladesman, he had killed seven of them so far, but it would take him some time to find the rest.

“Senior Di Jing.” Jian Wushuang took out a Messaging Slip and sent a message.

Di Jing had given him this Messaging Slip before he left Monster Continent.

“Boy, are you in trouble?” Di Jing’s laughing voice echoed.

“Yes, I’ve got some trouble.” Jian Wushuang told him his plan.

“Senior, you know, it will take me a rather long time to find all the people who helped the murder Sword Ancestor by myself and take revenge. I’m afraid I’ll miss the Firmament Territory Feast while I’m busy looking for them. So, can you help me with this?”

“That’s easy. Wait there and someone will be along to help you.” After saying this, Di Jing cut the connection.

Jian Wushuang waited patiently for a half day until an old figure appeared in front of him. The figure was a bald elder, skinny but serious looking, with purple sigils on top of his head.

“Jian Wushuang,” The elder spoke in an icy voice.

“You are...?” Jian Wushuang looked confused while staring at the elder. He was sure that he had never seen him before, but he sensed a familiar feeling from him.

“You don’t recognize me?” The elder looked at Jian Wushuang and asked. “Oh, right. I look like a human being right now. Here, look at this.”

The elder took our a bell.

“A Bell?” Jian Wushuang paused for a moment, but quickly realized who the elder was. “You’re Senior Di Jing’s mount!”

He recognized the bell. In fact, the bell was the top expert Bagu Cave Master, who had been transformed by Di Jing and been given to the mount as a toy back then.

Jian Wushuang remembered that mount as a dragon-headed Demonic Beast.

That’s why he had failed to recognize the elder until he saw the bell.

With no more words, the elder threw the bell into the air and the bell immediately transformed into a man. Naturally, it was Bagu Cave Master.

“Bone... Bone Dragon Emperor.”

The bad-tempered Bagu Cave Master stood in horror after returning to his human body and greeted the elder.

“Bone Dragon Emperor?” Jian Wushuang looked toward the elder in surprise.

He finally knew that the elder was also one of the three great Monster Emperors from the Monster Continent and was even the strongest one among them. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He had never thought Di Jing could make such a powerful monster his mount.

“No wonder that Yang Zaixuan was able to come to me with a dozen Bone Dragons before.”

“Jian Wushuang, Bagu Cave Master is one of the people who helped murder Sword Ancestor, so he knows every one of them. Just ask him what you want to know. He won’t dare lie to us,” The elder said to Jian Wushuang.

“Good.” Jian Wushuang nodded and turned to Bagu Cave Master. “So, just tell me who all the murderers are.”

“Ok.” Bagu Cave Master nodded heavily and started to speak. “There are a total of 28 people from different plane worlds that participated in killing Sword Ancestor. Apart from me and Jiujie King from Tian Yu World, who are at Level Three, the rest of them are only Level One or Two.

“They are Holy Ancestor and Stone Ancestor, from the Divine Land; Dong Ming King, from Luoyang World; Qian Xingzi from the Boundless Continent...”

Without pausing, Bagu Cave Master told Jian Wushuang the names of all the murderers.

“Among the 28, I’ve killed seven.?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

“Jian Wushuang.” Bone Dragon Emperor looked toward him and chimed in, “I’ll find the remaining 20 people for you as soon as possible, but I hope you can leave Bagu Cave Master to me. I need him as a servant.”

“No problem.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

For the sake of Bone Dragon Emperor, he would definitely spare Bagu Cave Master’s life. Besides, he didn’t think there was much of a difference between being a bell or being dead.

“I’ve issued an order to track them, so there will be a response in two days. Just wait,” Bone Dragon Emperor continued.

“OK, thank you, senior.” Jian Wushuang nodded. He could afford to wait for two more days.

As someone at the peak of Level Three, Bone Dragon Emperor was one of the supreme experts in the Ancient Worlds and the master of one of the top forces, so his men started tracking the other 20 people as soon as he gave out the order.

The response really did arrive two days later.
