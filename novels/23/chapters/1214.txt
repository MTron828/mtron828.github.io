“Run? Can you?” shouted Samsara Temple Master.

“Let no one leave! Go and kill all of them!” screamed the Red Snow King.

Red Snow King went into hysterics.

Other experts of the Gold Kingdom growled and hunted enemies down with scarlet faces.

They realized that the Green Fire World was now retreating. They could catch them with a blow, like hitting a drowning dog.

In the camp of the Gold Kingdom, the experts were in a serious rage, filled with killing intent.

The experts of the Green Fire World were fleeing. Samsara Temple Master looked cold, but he remained calm.

He glanced at the enemies frantically hunting his experts, and his eyes gleamed in amazement.

“Your Highness, they’re now inside the attack range of Divine Rays of the North,” Palace Master Yun reported. “The Palace Masters and the Masters in the Battle Fortress have been fully prepared,” he continued.

“Good. Stay for my order,” Samsara Temple Master said.

“Yes,” Palace Master Yun replied.

“Red Lotus, are you ready?” Samsara Temple Master asked through a message.

“Yes. With the help of three Seven-star Soul-seizing Cores, I will unleash the greatest power freely,” Red Lotus replied.

“Great,” Samsara Temple Master praised, his eyes gleaming.

Having hesitated for a while, he took out the Message Token for Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, can you do the old trick again?” he asked.

“The old trick?” Jian Wushuang asked. Obviously, he knew what Samsara Temple Master meant.

“Jian Wushuang, tell him yes. You can do it again,” Gu King said to him.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang immediately replied to Samsara Temple Master.

“Yes?” Samsara Temple Master was amazed. “Great! Do it at my command,” he said.

“Okay,” Jian Wushuang replied and nodded.

“Everything is ready. Now we’re just waiting for the enemies,” Samsara Temple Master said excitedly.

In the Battle Fortress, the remaining dozen Palace Masters and thousands of Holy Masters gathered under the Restriction.

Among them were Emperor Xiao, Emperor Yun and his Senior Brother Xue Lingtian — all acquaintances of Jian Wushuang.

They waited quietly, but they could not help roaring on the inside.

This was where they had been staying since the war had begun. They watched everything, but none of them made a move.

They kept waiting, saving up their strength for the final stroke.

On the battlefield, experts of the Green Fire World were fleeing in chaos, chased by those of the Gold Kingdom. As they ran, they came closer to the Battle Fortress.

30,000 miles!

24,000 miles!

15,000 miles!

Soon, the experts of the Gold Kingdom were less than 3,000 miles away from the Battle Fortress. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Even an ordinary Dao Master could cover 3,000 miles in a second. The experts inside the Battle Fortress could easily dash out in a flash when the enemies had almost no time to resist.

It was perfect timing.

“Go!” Samsara Temple Master ordered.

As Samsara Temple Master shouted, he gave the order to Palace Master Yun as well as the Palace Masters and the Holy Masters who were waiting in the Battle Fortress. This order also went to Palace Master Red Lotus and Jian Wushuang.

When the order arrived on the battlefield, Red Lotus swallowed an aquamarine elixir. Her robe and hair floated, giving out a horrible aura. The scarlet bracelet she had been wearing also glowed brightly. A giant blood river raged out from it.

Splash!

The blood river rose in a tide surging directly towards the battlefield and covered thousands of miles.

Everyone on the battlefield was covered by the blood river.

“Jiu You Realm, press!” shouted Red Lotus.

The horrible pressure, like from a bomb, burst out immediately.

Experts of the Gold Kingdom, who had been on the chase, suddenly stopped, as if stuck in a quagmire. Both their speed and power were suddenly hindered.

“What?” they cried out.

It was so shocking that they were stuck in the realm pressure before they realized what was happening.

Meanwhile, the Restriction inside the Battle Fortress was started suddenly. A golden brilliancy roared up. Impressively, it was a golden mirror, giving off an ancient aura. Inside the mirror, rays of golden light were encapsulated.

Followed by…

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

Dozens of golden beams burst out.

They were Divine Rays of the North equipped for the Battle Fortress. Eighteen Divine Rays of the North, in total, moved faster than anyone could imagine. In a flash, they arrived at the camp of the Gold Kingdom and covered eighteen of their experts at the forefront.

There were eight Universe Masters among them, and all of them were immediately pierced as soon as Divine Rays of the North reached them.?Passing through them, the rays continued to attack the experts behind them.

The Divine Rays of the North were so overwhelming that all of the experts of the Gold Kingdom were killed as soon as they were targeted. They did not even have a chance to fight back.

The eighteen Divine Rays of the North dissipated in an instant, having smashed the eight Universe Masters and dozens of Holy Masters behind them.

On top of that, dozens of Palace Masters and Holy Masters, who had been ready to go inside the Battle Fortress, rushed out with the Divine Rays of the North.

“Kill!” they shouted.

“Kill!” they shouted again.

The roar of killing reverberated throughout the area. Several figures with bursting auras appeared before the experts from the Gold Kingdom.

Their faces were distorted with astonishment.

The Red Snow King especially looked scared, as if he had seen a ghost.

“Dozens of Universe Masters and thousands of Holy Masters?” he said in shock.

“How is this possible?” he asked.

“Since when did the Green Fire Palace have so many experts?” he continued.

Red Snow King looked incredulous.

On the other side of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang suddenly turned around as the Palace Masters and the Holy Masters rushed out!

“Gu King!” Jian Wushuang said.

“I’m ready!” Gu King replied in a loud voice.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with sharpness and instantly…

“Ancient God Secret Skill… Mind-controlling!” shouted Gu King.

“Plenilune Secret Skills… Roaring!” said Jian Wushuang.

The roar of Plenilune and wrath of the Ancient God fell again!

What an earthshaking moment!
