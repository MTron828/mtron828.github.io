Chapter 3589: Five People

The Universe Origin of Sword Principle was too high-level. Even if Jian Wushuang did not use any powerful sword skill, as long as he activated the Universe Origin of Sword Principle in his sword skill, his sword would instantly become extremely terrifying.

Clang!

The two collided again. This time, Jian Wushuang was still pushed back, but Blood Saber Emperor also staggered back a few steps.

After these steps, Blood Saber Emperor’s face was a little ugly.

“Haha, as expected of Blood Saber Emperor. His strength is indeed impressive.” Jian Wushuang’s hearty laughter had already sounded. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Blood Saber Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang with a complicated gaze.

He could see that Jian Wushuang did not suffer any injury after the collision with his strongest saber, let alone serious injury.

In other words, he could not hurt Jian Wushuang even if he tried his best, so he could not threaten him.

“Blood Sword Master, you are able to take three of my saber strikes head-on without any damage. You are definitely a powerful warrior among the six states, and I can’t do anything to you alone,” Blood Saber Emperor said seriously.

“Blood Saber Emperor, are you planning to leave?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“No. Although I can’t do anything to you alone, there are too many experts targeting you this time. It’s still very difficult for you to escape unscathed. I’d better wait and see,” Blood Saber Emperor said with a faint smile, then he flew toward the nearby void.

He did not choose to leave. Instead, he stayed in the void around Jian Wushuang like the other cultivators.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang shrugged, but he was not surprised.

He knew that Blood Saber Emperor would not give up so easily. He would definitely wait for another opportunity to join hands with other experts when they arrived...

He had already guessed this, so he did not reveal any of his strength in the fight with Blood Saber Emperor. He just casually withstood the attack of Blood Saber Emperor, it made people think that he was just an ordinary expert at the peak of the six realms, so he had the upper hand.

“If I’m not mistaken, Blood Saber Emperor will have to wait for other experts at the peak of the six realms to arrive. When three or four of them arrive, they will choose to join forces to deal with me. At that time, I, Thunder Blaze Master, will make a move and start a massacre.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold, he had already had his own thoughts.

He knew that there were too many people targeting him this time. Since so many people were targeting him at the same time, it would be best for him to use the bloody massacre to intimidate all the experts and forces in this territory! It would make all the experts and forces tremble in fear!

Of course, such a massacre was not something that could be done by killing just one person.

If Jian Wushuang went all out, he could kill Blood Saber Emperor, but killing one person was not enough to intimidate him. The experts of the pinnacle of the six realm would not attack him easily.

Therefore, he had to wait for the other experts of the pinnacle of the six realm to come and join hands with him!

At that time, it would be the time for him to make his move.

There was nothing more shocking than being able to defeat several experts of the pinnacle of the six realm with lightning speed and even kill a few of them on the spot.

“Let’s wait slowly.”

Jian Wushuang was not in a hurry at all. He slowly headed toward Wuxin Lake.

Naturally, more and more experts came, and soon, a second expert of the pinnacle of the six realm arrived.

This expert of the pinnacle of the six realm was Thunder Blaze Master, whose strength was weaker than that of Blood Saber Emperor. He first fought with Jian Wushuang, but when he found that he could not defeat Jian Wushuang, he chose to do the same as Blood Saber Emperor, he first retreated to the side and continued to wait for other experts to arrive.

Then, the third expert of the pinnacle of the six realm, Nine Sword Demon Master, also arrived…

Time passed. It had been a year since Jian Wushuang was first targeted by Dragon Swan Master.

During this year, more and more experts rushed over. There were now more than 100 Principles Masters around Jian Wushuang, and five Principles Masters who had reached the ultimate six-realm.

These five ultimate experts were Blood Saber Emperor, Thunder Blaze Master, Nine Sword Demon Master, Kun Master, and Blood Spirit King!

Among the five Principles Masters, Blood Saber Emperor and Blood Spirit King were the strongest, and Blood Spirit King was very close to a Ruler. Among the many ultimate experts of the six realms in this territory, she was definitely one of the top ten ultimate experts of the six realms.

However, although Blood Spirit King was very powerful, she could not defeat Jian Wushuang in a one-on-one fight when she first arrived.

Now, the five experts had gathered together.

“Blood Spirit King, I can’t believe that even you can’t defeat Blood Sword Master.” Blood Saber Emperor looked at Blood Spirit King in surprise.

The cold and arrogant woman in red armor looked extremely cold. “I didn’t expect Blood Sword Master to be so powerful, especially his swordsmanship. I just fought with him. Although I didn’t use my strongest skill, I guess I can’t kill him even if I use my strongest skill. I can’t even severely injure him.”

“Even you can’t kill him. It seems that it’s impossible to kill him alone. If that’s the case, then we can only join forces. Four of you, what do you think?” Thunder Blaze Master said.

“Join forces? Of course we will join forces. The reason why we have been waiting here and are unwilling to leave is to wait for more experts to arrive before joining forces,” Nine Sword Demon Master said.

“That Blood Sword Master’s methods are indeed not weak. Even if two or three experts at the pinnacle of the sixth realm joined hands, I’m afraid they wouldn’t have absolute confidence in killing him. However, if the five of us can join hands, then the chances of killing him would be very high.” Blood Blade Emperor said seriously, “Thunder Blaze Master, Nine Sword Demon Master, Kun Master, and me, the four of us have already reached an agreement. Blood Spirit King, you are the strongest and the last to arrive. What do you say?”

“Joining forces is not a problem. The key is to kill Blood Sword Master. After we obtain the opportunity from him, how should we split it?” Blood Spirit King said.

“This, we will talk about it after we kill Blood Sword Master.” Blood Blade Emperor said, “Furthermore, we can not kill him directly in the beginning. Instead, we have to think of a way to force him to tell us what happened to him over the years and the secrets of the Life and Death Realm. Actually, as long as we know these, it will be a great harvest for us. As for the other opportunities, we will wait for him to tell us more before we kill him and snatch his interspatial ring.”

“Sure.” Thunder Blaze Master nodded.

Nine Sword Demon Master and Kun Master did not object.

“In that case, let’s fight.” Blood Spirit King smiled.

Immediately, the five experts flew toward Jian Wushuang.
