Chapter 1245: Trump Card of the Monarch

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Kill him!”

“Wushuang Palace Master, strike him down!”

“He must die!”

As yellings full of resentment and killing intent kept reaching his ears, Jian Wushuang’s face turned grave.

“The Jin Kingdom was against us for all the past five million years, and the Green Fire Palace suffered heavy losses during this period of time. Especially in those two consecutive battles, many of our high-level experts lost their lives. The monarch of the Jin Kingdom is the one who caused all of this.

“To completely end this, I must kill the monarch of the Jin Kingdom!

“However, why is he still alive? I thrust my sword into his chest, and his heart should be smashed now.”?Jian Wushuang thought in surprise.

He meant to kill the monarch with the blow.

Nevertheless, the King was just badly hurt after receiving the blow.

“Jian Wushuang, the monarch of the Jin Kingdom is a Universe God. His divine power and Divine Body have already reached the perfect realm, and so has his Life Core. Besides, he’s capable of using some skills to protect his Life Core. Although you crushed his heart, you failed to destroy his Life Core. That’s why he’s still alive,” said Gu King.

“This monarch’s Life Core is hidden inside his head. If you want to take his life, you must smash his head to pieces!”

“Can I really end his life by breaking his head?”?Jian Wushuang thought, his eyes filled with a strong killing intent.

The monarch of the Jin Kingdom was now several thousand kilometers away from Jian Wushuang. He was trembling with fear, looking surprised.

He had never expected himself to be defeated by Jian Wushuang, a Universe Master.

“Monarch of the Jin Kingdom!”

Jian Wushuang suddenly roared to the monarch.

The monarch raised his head immediately and caught sight of the murderous look in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Today, you must die!” Jian Wushuang said in a cold voice as he came at the monarch.

The monarch’s face turned ferocious as he responded with a snort, “Jian Wushuang, I admit that your cultivation levels are above mine, but do you really believe that you can take my life? I do not think you can do that.”

As soon as the monarch finished his sentence, he waved his hand to summon a flowing silver light.

The silver light was moving at a shocking speed. In the blink of an eye, it had come close to Jian Wushuang.

Suddenly, it transformed into a streak of lightning and dashed toward Jian Wushuang with amazing speed and ferocity.

“What’s this?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows in surprise and immediately brandished his sword to fend off the attack.

“Clang!”

A deafening sound rang out. Jian Wushuang could not help stepping backward.

The experts of the Green Fire World, who were watching the fight around the battlefield, were shocked.

They found it hard to believe that the silver thing could easily knock Jian Wushuang away. After all, Jian Wushuang had demonstrated his strength not long ago. His strength was obviously stronger than that of the monarch. Even when the monarch had performed at his highest level, Jian Wushuang had been able to ward off his attacks.

When Jian Wushuang managed to stand on his feet again, he narrowed his eyes and gazed at the silver-armored burly man.

His countenance turned grim, as he said through gritted his teeth, “Fire Puppet!”

The flowing silver light which had forced Jian Wushuang to step backward instantly was a Fire Puppet.

It used to belong to the Green Fire World.

To break a Formation, the Green Fire Palace had sent it out to stop the monarch of the Jin Kingdom during a previous battle, but instead of removing the Formation, it had been taken away by the monarch.

Now the monarch used it against Jian Wushuang.

“Damn it! He’s Fire Gems. That’s why he’s able to manipulate the Fire Puppet,” said Jian Wushuang.

One had to use Fire Gems to manipulate a Fire Puppet.

After countless years of search on the battlefield, the Green Fire Palace had only collected a small amount of Fire Gems and during the previous battle, they had run out of them.

Jian Wushuang had once thought that the monarch would have never been unable to control the puppet even after getting some Fire Gems, but now it turned out that he had underestimated this monarch.

“Fire Gems are rare indeed, but if a Universe God is interested in them, he can always manage to get some. The monarch of the Jin Kingdom probably happens to have some Fire Gems in his hands,” Gu King’s voice sounded in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

Jian Wushuang agreed with Gu King.

All the bases of the Jin Kingdom on this battlefield had been destroyed by the Green Fire Palace. Give this, it was impossible for the monarch to get any Fire Gem from this battlefield. Therefore, there was only one explanation for this: he had attained some Fire Gems from somewhere else.

In fact, the monarch had indeed possessed some Fire Gems before he came to this world, but his gems were not enough to activate the Fire Puppet. He was able to manipulate the Fire Puppet now since he had bought plenty of Fire Gems from Jiu Xi.

Jiu Xi was a master in Formation, and many Formations required gems. That was why Jiu Xi owned lots of different rare gems, including Fire Gems. She had sold all of her Fire Gems to the monarch of the Jin Kingdom at a costly price.

With the help of those fire gems, the monarch finally succeeded in manipulating the Fire Puppet.

“I have many Fire Gems. Although they’re not enough to make this Fire Puppet exert its full strength, they can make the puppet release more power and fight longer than it did when it was under your manipulation,” the monarch said with a snort.

“Now I have this Fire Puppet. I’ll wait and see who’ll be killed in the end.”

The monarch ordered Fire Puppet with a hideous look, “Strike him down!”

Now the Fire Puppet was under the control of the monarch of the Jin Kingdom. Hearing his order, it dashed towards Jian Wushuang without hesitation.

A flash of silver light streaked across the Void. Even Jian Wushuang could only barely capture its movement.

“It’s moving so fast!”?Jian Wushuang exclaimed inside.

“I can perceive that this Fire Puppet owns an overwhelming battle strength. I guess that it has almost entered the Peak Realm of a Universe God. This puppet is much stronger than the monarch. Jian Wushuang, be careful!” Gu King warned.

Jian Wushuang nodded seriously.

When the silver-armored Fire Puppet came at him with its silver long spear, Jian Wushuang immediately dashed forward to confront it with a determined look in his eyes.

In the center of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang and the Fire Puppet had gotten into a fierce battle again.

However, this battle only lasted seconds.

“Bang!”

A creepy explosion of energy rang out. Suddenly, a shadow above the Void was falling down into the sinkhole in the ground. It was Jian Wushuang.

The next moment, he flew up again, looking a little bit haggard.
