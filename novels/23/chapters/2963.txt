Chapter 2964: Strength Skyrocketed

——

This gray magic sword was called the Star-Luo Sword. It was a third-grade superior holy treasure-grade magic weapon that Jian Wushuang had exchanged for 1.5 million sacred elixirs from Lord Tianshou.

A total of 18 Star-Luo Swords floated in front of Jian Wushuang.

In order to control 18 superior holy treasures at the same time, one had to have a very strong soul. Secondly, controlling 18 third-grade superior holy treasures and controlling 18 superior holy treasures were two completely different things in terms of strength consumption.

Even if an ordinary Immortal Saint wanted to control 18 superior third-grade holy treasures at the same time, his divine power would be exhausted in two or three moves. Although Jian Wushuang was only a Divine Master, his divine power was too vast, it was far beyond what the Immortal Saint could compare with.

Controlling 18 superior third-grade holy treasures at the same time did not pose too much pressure to him.

“It’s also the fourth sword formation of the Samsara Sword Formation. I’d like to see the difference between using 18 third-grade superior holy treasures and 18 superior heavenly treasures.”

With a hint of curiosity, Jian Wushuang immediately controlled the 18 Star Luo Swords in front of him and combined them at the fastest speed.

The 18 Star Luo Swords combined to form a cyan divine sword that was less than two meters long.

The cyan divine sword was filled with the power of the law of reincarnation. Even before it flew out, its terrifying aura alone was enough to make an ordinary Immortal Saint despair.

“Go!”

Jian Wushuang pointed at it from afar.

The cyan divine sword turned into a cyan arc light and instantly rushed out.

Whoosh!

The arc light traveled over 10,000 meters and mercilessly lifted up two huge waves wherever it passed. However, the cyan arc light was unstoppable and destroyed everything in front of it.

The ear-piercing sound of the void-piercing explosion was even louder.

In the end, the green arc light did not directly hit the material body. It only penetrated the void. The specific power had not been fully displayed, but Jian Wushuang already had a vague idea of what it was.

“If my senses are correct, using 18 superior third-grade holy treasures to perform a move of the Samsara Sword Formation, ice and snow world, is about ten times more powerful than using superior heavenly treasures previously.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a strange luster.

More than 10 times…

Just because he changed his magic weapon…

“The power is too strong!”

Jian Wushuang was extremely excited. “When I fought with the Star Sea Saint, I used all my trump cards and fully performed the Samsara Sword Formation. However, the Samsara Sword Formation must be a sword formation, and it must be performed by my own standard magic weapon. I guided the supreme sword essence of the Blood Mountain Sword, but I couldn’t increase the power of the Samsara Sword Formation, so the power of the Samsara Sword Formation couldn’t threaten the Star Sea Saint.”

“But it’s different now!”

“With these 18 Star Luo Swords, the power of the fourth level of the reincarnation sword formation will increase by more than 10 times. It Won’t be weaker than the strongest swordsmanship I use when I fully guide the sword essence. In other words, I should be able to fight Star Sea Saint head-on with this reincarnation sword formation alone. Once I guide the sword essence to fight Star Sea Saint head-on, Star Sea Saint will definitely be no match for me!”

“And this is before my breakthrough…”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists tightly.

Before his breakthrough, he was confident that he could defeat the Star Sea Saint with the help of the sword formation formed by the 18 Star Luo Swords combined with his swordsmanship.

However, now that he had reached the Peak Great Divine Master level and his overall strength had improved a lot, his battle strength should have far surpassed the Star Sea Saint.

“I’ve made a breakthrough in my realm and tested the power of the Star Luo Sword. My next target is the fifth sword formation of the Samsara Sword Formation. To get this heavy sword formation, I must first become an earth-level member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance!” Jian Wushuang muttered.

The authority of an earth-level member was much higher than that of an ordinary member.

But to become an earth-level member, one must first have a certain level of strength. Secondly, one must complete three ordinary-level three-star missions alone.

Jian Wushuang knew this, so he immediately went to the secret nest no. 385.

The secret nest was still quite deserted, and few people came here on weekdays.

As for Xue Dong King, who had been staying with Jian Wushuang all this time…after he exchanged the sacred elixir for treasures from Lord Tianshou, he went into seclusion and never came out, so Jian Wushuang naturally would not disturb him.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang was doing a promotion mission, which required him to complete alone. It was useless even with Xue Dong King.

Jian Wushuang went directly to the counter.

“Elder Qiu, give me a list of tasks,” Jian Wushuang said.

Elder Qiu raised his head and glanced at Jian Wushuang, then threw him a token.

After taking the token, Jian Wushuang glanced at it briefly, then slowly shook his head.

There were not many missions recorded in the token. There were only two three-star missions. Although they were three-star missions, they did not put any pressure on Jian Wushuang at the moment. Moreover, the rewards for these two missions were average, it did not interest Jian Wushuang at all.

“Elder Qiu, can you give me a more detailed list of missions, preferably three-star missions or above? It doesn’t matter if they are not from this territory,” Jian Wushuang said.

“There are indeed only two three-star missions around this nest. However, there are many three-star missions outside this territory. You can see for yourself.” Elder Qiu took out a brand-new token and handed it to Jian Wushuang, there were many missions recorded on this token. There were more than 200 ordinary three-star missions.

There were enough missions for Jian Wushuang to select.

The only regret was that these three-star missions were far away from the nest. Jian Wushuang had to go through the wormhole inside the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to get there. Moreover, the wormhole was not open for free, he had to pay a big price for it.

“These missions…” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang carefully browsed through the missions in the token and soon locked onto three of them.

“Just these three missions,”Jian Wushuang said and returned the token to Elder Qiu. At the same time, he explained the three three-star missions he had taken.

“One person taking three missions at the same time, and they are all three-star missions? Marquis Jian, what do you want to do?” Elder Qiu asked in a deep voice.

“Nothing. I just think it’s troublesome, so I want to complete all three promotion missions at the same time,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Promotion mission? You mean, you want to complete all three missions alone?” Elder Qiu immediately looked over.
