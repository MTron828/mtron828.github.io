Chapter 1709: Kill!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Damn it!”

Upon seeing that more than half of the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning had disappeared due to the attack from the God Destroying Pearl and that most of the prohibitions and formations had been destroyed as well, Jian Wushuang’s expression turned unusually ugly.

“You deserve to die!” Jian Wushuang was filled with murderous intent. All of a sudden, his body became ten meters tall and the aura on his body became more than twice as strong. In the space between his eyebrows, there were six stars and he had impressive god power.

“Ancient God Secret Skill, Thunder Attracting Skill!”

Boom!

All of a sudden, a giant crack appeared in the quiet sky and a total of nine giant Sacred Thunders descended from it.

At the same time, the two Hong Jun Golden Swords which were floating in the void trembled crazily and headed toward His Highness Mu Hong, one from the left and the other one from the right.

“Not good. This Jian Wushuang is actually not dead!” His Highness Mu Hong’s face was filled with fear. In particular, when he saw the two Hong Jun Golden Swords which were heading toward him at the same time, he shook with terror.

“Run!”

Without any hesitation, His Highness Mu Hong did his best to escape straight away. As for the Sir God-level black battle puppet, he left it behind to block Jian Wushuang.

The nine Sacred Thunders that descended from the heavens were unable to be aimed at His Highness Mu Hong in time. As such, it could only attack the black battle puppet together with the two Hong Jun Golden Swords. In just a short amount of time, the Sir God-level battle puppet was defeated. With a wave of Jian Wushuang’s big hands, the damaged battle puppet was put into his Qian Kun Ring.

“It’s impossible for you to run away!”

Jian Wushuang had an overwhelming amount of murderous intent. As he looked at His Highness Mu Hong who was still within his line of vision, his body turned vague and a great number of shadows appeared at the same time. With that, his speed achieved his peak instantly.

Other than being struck with terror, His Highness Mu Hong was running away with all his might. After just an instant, he had already escaped to the other battlefield.

“Save me, please save me quickly!”

Even though His Highness Mu Hong had just arrived at that battlefield, his mad cry for help had already spread.

“What?”

The three Sir Gods, the gloomy old man, God Qi and God Ba were currently fighting an intense battle with Sir God Luo Sha and Sir God Mad Dog. Moreover, they were in a very advantageous position. However, after hearing the cries for help, the expressions of the three of them changed greatly at the same time.

The gloomy old man gave up on dealing with Sir God Mad Dog immediately and headed for His Highness Mu Hong right away.

“Your Highness Mu Hong, what’s wrong?” the gloomy old man appeared beside His Highness Mu Hong.

“It’s Jian Wushuang. He’s hunting me down!” His Highness Mu Hong roared repeatedly.

The gloomy old man turned his head at once and just happened to see Jian Wushuang whose face was filled with murderous intent coming over.

“Jian Wushuang is actually here as well?” The gloomy old man’s expression turned grave and he asked straight away: “Your Highness, what about the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning?”

“It has been destroyed,” His Highness Mu Hong said.

“That’s good,” the gloomy old man heaved a sigh of relief.

Although they did not manage to snatch the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning away, their mission was considered complete since the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning had been destroyed.

“We have completed our mission. Stop dealing with them and let’s leave quickly,” the gloomy old man gave a shrill cry. After that, the two Sir Gods, God Qi and God Ba, who were still in combat, retreated immediately.

“It’s not that easy to escape,” Sir God Luo Sha’s face was filled with madness. At that time, her whole person was within the dense fog and the dense fog covered a great area of the universe. Moreover, the Sword Principles which contained a tremendous amount of extreme hatred burst forth repeatedly with the intention of keeping the Sir Gods in front back.

“All of you shall stay here.” Similarly, Sir God Mad Dog unleashed an enormous amount of evil aura and he had already changed into an Exotic Beast. Moreover, the Exotic Beast was extremely gigantic. It was more than a hundred feet tall and it had a total of six claws. Its frightening murderous intent also covered a humongous area and it was earth-shaking.

“Retreat quickly!”

The gloomy old man and the three remaining people absolutely did not have the intention of staying behind and dealing with him. After all, they were Sir God experts and there was a total of four of them. If they really wanted to escape, it would be difficult for Sir God Luo Sha and Sir God Mad Dog to keep them back.

However, at that moment…

“All of you, don’t think that any of you can escape!”

All of a sudden, a voice which was filled with shocking murderous intent and anger resounded across the universe. It was Jian Wushuang who had arrived at the battlefield. His eyes were evil like an enraged ferocious beast and he was staring at the four Sir Gods in front who were preparing to leave persistently. To be more exact, he was staring at His Highness Mu Hong.

Anyone could leave. However, His Highness Mu Hong alone had to remain!

Even if he could not be captured alive, he had to be killed.

It was not just because of the fact that His Highness Mu Hong had destroyed the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning. It was also not because of the fact that His Highness Mu Hong had trampled on him back then in the Blood Demon Church. Instead, it was because… His Highness Mu Hong had actually called Leng Ruxue Leng’er!

What an intimate way of calling her!

Perhaps the person who he had called was Leng Ruxue and it was unrelated to Leng Rushuang who was Jian Wushuang’s wife. Or perhaps Leng Ruxue had never paid any attention to His Highness Mu Hong at all.

However, His Highness Mu Hong obviously had the intention to get close to Leng Ruxue. And the body that Leng Ruxue possessed was the body of Leng Rushuang!

Anyone who touched the forbidden lamella of a dragon had to die! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Leng Ruxue was his forbidden lamella!

“Ancient God Secret Skill… Moon Picking Skill!”

Buzz!

The void shook.

All of a sudden, a peculiar power took effect on the void and in a split second, rustle, the void collapsed into pieces at a speed that naked eyes could not perceive.

At the same time, the power spread toward the four Sir Gods, His Highness Mu Hong, the gloomy old man, God Qi and God Ba. With that, the bodies of the four Sir Gods shook and their eyes revealed a bit of fear at the same time.

At that moment, the whole universe, heaven, space and time headed toward the four of them with the intention of crushing them completely into fine powder.

It was as if they were being repelled by the universe, space and time. It was as if they should not have existed in the world.

It was too strange.

Moreover, the most important thing was that it was impossible to block the attack.

The frightening crushing power unleashed its effects straight away.

Out of the four Sir Gods, His Highness Mu Hong was actually the weakest. After withstanding the repelling power for not long, he spit out a mouthful of blood right away.

As for the remaining three of them, under the suppression of space and time, their expressions became a lot paler.

However, just as the repelling power of space and time was about to dissipate, two brilliant rays of golden light lit up abruptly. The places that they lit up were beside His Highness Mu Hong. One was in front while the other one was behind him.

“Your Highness, please be careful.”

Upon realizing that, the gloomy old man warned him immediately.

However, at such a close distance, even with a warning, it was already too late.

His Highness Mu Hong had opened his eyes wide and he was looking at the rays of golden light in front of him which were expanding in size continuously. He was totally unable to react and his mind was completely empty.

That was the result of him growing up in a greenhouse.

If it were a Sir God who had grown up in the face of terror, he might still be able to react upon seeing the two rays of golden light. At the very least, he would be able to unleash some defensive moves.

However, His Highness Mu Hong was just a dimwit. At that moment, he was completely stunned and he did not resist at all.
