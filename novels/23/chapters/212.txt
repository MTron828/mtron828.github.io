Chapter 213: Shameless

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

An expert of the Primordial Golden Pill Realm able to contend with an expert of the Yang Void Realm, was indeed unbelievable.

If Jian Wushuang was an expert of the Initial Yin Void Realm, it would be acceptable that he could fight against the experts of Yin Void Realm.

Jian Wushuang was an ostensible expert of the Primordial Gold Core Realm already, but his strength was not weaker than that of the expert of the Initial Yin Void Realm on every aspect.

At that moment, the Grayrobe’s face was totally distorted.

He definitely hadn’t thought that despite the fact that he spared no effort to attack Jian Wushuang, he failed to achieve anything. That the end result made him end up on the losing side.

“What should I do next?” Grayrobe’s eyes became bleak.

He led a great number of elites from Blood Feather Tower to attack Jian Wushuang but those elite purple-masked killers were all killed by Jian Wushuang.

Such a huge loss. If Jian Wushuang was not killed now...

It should be known that he had already tried assassinating Jian Wushuang twice but both of those times failed.

A third failure was always not allowed in Blood Feather Tower. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Therefore, he had to kill Jian in the third assassination. If it failed, as the leader, he surely would be killed according to the Blood Feather Tower’s rules.

But he didn’t want to die.

“This guy now is strong enough to fight with me openly. I can’t kill him alone, unless...” Grayrobe slightly squinted his eyes and then looked toward the experts of the 12 Dynasties as well as the old sects.

“Gentlemen, is there anyone who would like to help me kill him? Blood Feather Tower promises to repay the favor,” Grayrobe said in a resonant voice sounding around the whole Void.

Hearing this, every expert above the Void showed strange expressions.

“Oh. Since he is incapable of killing Jian Wushuang, should he expect us to help him?”

“Grayrobe is cunning.”

“Hum. I’m not willing to deal with the little guy since we don’t have any hatred between us.”

“Jian Wushuang has marvelous talent, which makes me admire him even more so. For that, I won’t attack him.”

The experts from the 12 Dynasties and the old sects didn’t take action as Grayrobe had hoped.

Meanwhile, those experts all looked at Grayrobe with sarcastic eyes.

Who was Jian Wushuang? He was the peerless genius joining the Easternmost Hunting.

In the Easternmost Hunting, what Jian Wushuang performed was very stunning.

It shocked everyone.

When Blood Feather Tower directly tried to assassinate Jian Wushuang in the Easternmost Hunting, all 12 Dynasties felt guilty for that they couldn’t help Jian Wushuang because they feared the force behind Blood Feather Tower.

At that moment, how should Grayrobe expect them to kill Jian Wushuang?

The face is as important to a man as the bark is to a tree!

Those experts from the 12 Dynasties were all monarchs, and how could they have no sense of shame?

“Jian Wushuang...” the Monarch of the Cosmos Empire, that weathered elder, said it in a low voice at this moment.

Monarchs from other dynasties all looked over at the weathered elder.

Among those 12 Dynasties, he was the only one that had a reason to deal with Jian Wushuang.

At that time, the weathered elder slightly raised up his head and solemnly looked at Jian Wushuang, firmly saying, “Although, in the Easternmost Hunting, this guy has killed many talents from my empire, which humiliates me greatly.

“But... the Easternmost Hunting is originally a fierce competition between talents from the 12 Dynasties. Talents from my Cosmos Empire are only to blame themselves for their death because of their weak abilities.

“So, I have to bear their fault alone. But now, there is a chance to fight with this guy, why not have a try?”

The weathered elder glimpsed Grayrobe with disdain.

None of the monarchs from the 12 Dynasties were willing to take any action and neither did the experts from the old sects.

All of them disregarded what Grayrobe said.

The Grayrobe’s face turned pale and yelled immediately, “Gentlemen, you should know that it is ‘that force’ that wants Jian Wushuang to be dead, not the Blood Feather Tower. Who helps me kill him will be repaid by ‘that force’. It is the best chance to get in touch with ‘that force’. Don’t you want to get their favor?”

Now, what he said did intrigue the experts present that they would perhaps even consider the offer.

However, the 12 Dynasties and the experts from the old sects still kept calm.

The only one who was considerably swayed at the moment was Mo Lingtian, who came from the Wilderness Sword Sect.

Mo Lingtian originally disliked Jian Wushuang.

Seeing Jian Wushuang being at the center of an assassination even brought him pleasure.

But now...

What Grayrobe said indeed motivated him.

It should be known that ‘the force’ was Holy Emperor Palace.

He clearly knew that Holy Emperor Palace’s power should never be underestimated.

“In recent years, the integral status of our Wilderness Sword Sect has been in a decline. There are less talented disciples and experts in the sect. They gradually fell in rank and now are the last in the top eight Sects and some smaller sects even want to remove us from their current position.”

“If I can have something connected with Holy Emperor Palace, the Wilderness Sword Sect would undoubtedly have a much higher status due to the influence that Holy Emperor Palace wields.”

“And personally, I would have made an immeasurable contribution to the Sect!”

“The contribution would be immeasurably unique and influential. Making me, the Law-enforcing Elder, one of the top leaders of the sect. In decades, perhaps my name also will appear on the election of a new Sect Master.”

When Mo Lingtian thought about it, his eyes became soldering-hot. Gleaming with the future he had envisioned.

Whereafter, he directly he rushed towards Grayrobe.

“Haha. Mr. Grayrobe, right? I’m Mo Lingtian from the Wilderness Sword Sect. I’m willing to help you!”

Chipper laughter spread. Then Mo Lingtian appeared beside Grayrobe.

Seeing Mo Lingtian, Jian Wushuang’s face changed.

On the nearby Void, 12 Dynasties and those experts from the old sects couldn’t help being stunned and angry.

“Mr. Ling Tian, don’t you think this is overdoing it to deal with a guy in the Golden Core Level.”

“Mr. Ling Tian, please behave yourself!”

“Mo Lingtian, you are the Law-enforcing Elder of the Wilderness Sword Sect, one of the Eight Sects of Nanyang. Should you do such dishonor to yourself and your Sect, bullying someone lesser than you?”

Many experts stood up to rebuke him. Although they called him Mr. Ling Tian to show a hint of respect to him, they actually despised him from the bottom.

“Shameless!”

“Too shameless!”

Di Xi couldn’t help scolding him angrily.
