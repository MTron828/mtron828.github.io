Chapter 1364: The Second Heaven

“Only an ordinary disciple?” Jian Wushuang felt overwhelmed.

Only an ordinary disciple would already be that strong. Just how strong are the disciples of Star Palace?

“What is the disciple going to do with the Meta Beast?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Meta Beast is a strange existence derived from the Milky Way. It is extremely intelligent and it contains an enormous amount of meta strength. The usage of meta strength is extensive. It could be used to make pills, make a weapon, aid cultivation of secret skill. Besides, meta strength is extremely nourishing for one’s consciousness,” Lei Chao said.

“As such, the disciples from Lineage of Star often capture the Meta Beast in the Milky Way to extract the Meta strength from their bodies for cultivation. After extracting their Meta strength, they would release the Meta beast. The Meta strength in the Meta Beasts’ bodies would recover over a period of time.”

“I see,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Let’s go. Lineage of Star’s old lair is right ahead.”

Lei Chao continued to move forwards with Jian Wushuang and they soon arrived before Lineage of Star’s old lair.

Looking at the majestic palace that stood before him, along with the large amount of buildings above the stars, Jian Wushuang was astonished.

Lofty! Magnificent!

It was definitely one of the loftiest sects Jian Wushuang had ever seen.

How many forces could place their old lair within the Milky Way in the entire Eternal Chaotic World after all?

“Jian Wushuang, follow me.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Lei Chao led Jian Wushuang towards one of the stars. He intentionally detoured from the buildings on the way. It seemed that he didn’t want anyone to see Jian Wushuang and himself.

In the Stars, there was a huge cave dwelling which was formed entirely with special crystals.

Lei Chao and Jian Wushuang walked into the cave dwelling.

The moment they entered the cave dwelling, Jian Wushuang immediately saw the long-haired middle-aged man who sat on the stone bed like a statue before him.

The long-haired middle-aged man had a natural manner.

“Yuan!” Lei Chao spoke softly.

The long-haired middle-aged man, who was like a statue, slowly opened his eyes and a ray of purple light flashed like a purple gemstone.

“You have returned.”

The long-haired middle-aged man looked at Lei Chao then at Jian Wushuang, “This is the young man, Jian Wushuang who passed the test that the Palace Master set up personally and became the disciple of Star Palace?”

“Mm,” Lei Chao nodded and introduced, “Jian Wushuang, the person before you is one of the three Hall Masters in Lineage of Star. You can call him Hall Master Yuan. In the Lineage of Star, the Palace Master and the other two Hall Masters are mostly cultivating in seclusion. Any matters will be decided by Hall Master Yuan.”

“Greetings, Hall Master Yuan,” Jian Wushuang bowed politely.

“Young man, there’s no need to stand on ceremony,” the long-haired middle-aged Hall Master Yuan smiled and said, “Lei Chao sent me a message earlier and I already reported it to the Palace Master. The Palace Master told me to bring you to see him directly when you arrive in Lineage of Star. Follow me.”

“See the Palace Master?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

The Palace Master of the Lineage of Star was the founder of the Lineage of Star. He was the superior existence in the peak of the Eternal Chaotic World.

The superior existence wanted to see him?

“Jian Wushuang, well done. You have been summoned by the founder of Lineage of Star. The other experts, including many real Gods, didn’t even stand a chance to meet him, but you get to see him the moment you step foot in the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. Tsk tsk…” King of Venomous Worms teased.

Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly but he followed Hall Master Yuan.

As for Lei Chao, he stayed back in the cave dwelling instead of following them.

In the depth of the boundless Milky Way, there was a cave dwelling. The cave dwelling merged into one with the Milky Way. If it didn’t reveal itself actively, no one would notice the existence of the cave dwelling. Then, Hall Palace Yuan brought Jian Wushuang before the cave dwelling.

The two of them didn’t enter the cave dwelling but stood outside. Hall Master Yuan bowed slightly at the cave dwelling and said, “Palace Master, I brought the young man with me.”

“Mm.”

An ancient yet thick voice broke the silence. The voice traveled lightly as though it was from far far away.

“Young man, you’re the one who passed through the test that I left in the Star Foggy Sea?” The founder of the Lineage of Star asked.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang replied politely.

“As expected…” The founder of the Lineage of Star sounded melancholy, “Star Foggy Sea, it has been so many years!”

“Not long after I created Star Foggy Sea, I lost it at that place. I thought no one would ever find it nor would there be anyone who could pass the test there. Who knew you would pass through it successfully in the end, and you even found Lineage of Star on your own. Very good.”

“Hearing what the founder of Lineage of Star said, Jian Wushuang was shaken, “Which place?”

“Star Foggy Sea. You kept it with you or you left it in your hometown?” The founder of Lineage of Star asked.

“I left it at my hometown,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Mm. That’s good too.” The founder of Lineage of Star kept quiet for a while before he spoke again, “Your identity as an Inverse Cultivator, I already know. Inverse Cultivator… It is really rare. Ever since I started Lineage of Star, I have never gotten any disciple that did inverse cultivation. You’re the very first!”

“Inverse cultivation, great potential. Once you pass the Inverse Cultivation Test in the Third Heaven, you’re destined to go right to the top, and the possibility of becoming an Almighty is very high.”

“However, the route for inverse cultivation isn’t an easy journey!”

“I already made some arrangement for you after I received Yuan’s message. Your identity as an inverse cultivator shouldn’t be exposed or publicized before you become an Almighty or before you stand on the peak of the Eternal Chaotic World.”

Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Can’t expose my identity as an inverse cultivator before I become an Almighty?

“I refined a treasure for you in the past few days. Take it.”

In the cave dwelling, a ray of black light spurted out and Jian Wushuang extended his hand to take it. He spread his palm and saw that it was a black bead that gave out a mysterious aura.

“This bead has just been refined. I have yet to name it, you can name it yourself. After you refine it, it will blend into your divine body. After that, there will be a tremendous change in your aura. You are just a Universe God in the First Heaven now. However, after you refine the bead, your aura will improve to the level of a Universe God in the Second Heaven. You will then look pretty much like an ordinary Universe God in the Second Heaven!”

“Besides, the bead will cover your Soul Power. When you are fighting with the others, you can still use Soul Attacks. With the bead, even an Almighty who hasn’t reached my level, or an Almighty who purely studies the Soul won’t be able to understand your actual situation!”

“From today onwards, you must remember, you are not a Universe God in the First Heaven but… the Second Heaven!”
