Chapter 1095: Golden Image

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Ji Wumeng encountered Jian Nantian in her last reincarnation and showed that she was ultimately unable to discard her emotions. Moreover, she even gave birth to Jian Wushuang. Therefore, the efforts made over her last eight reincarnations were completely ruined.

Green Fire Palace was furious when they heard of it. They immediately brought Ji Wumeng back and imprisoned her on the Heaven Ceasing Peak so that she could forget about Jian Nantian and her son. They sought to send her back to Samsara and start all over again.

Now, Jin Nantian had rescued Ji Wumeng, once again foiling their plans.

Their efforts and the sacrifices of over 20 Celestial Masters were all vain.

Naturally, the Green Fire Palace experts despised Jian Nantian and Jian Wushuang.

Understanding this, Jian Wushuang tolerated the reproaches of Celestial Master Chen and the rest.

He would be the one to complete the tasks that his mother had not fulfilled.

“Don’t overthink it. Let’s head to Green Fire Palace,” Celestial Master Yu Ding said.

“Alright.” Jian Wushuang nodded and returned to the palace with Yu Ding through the wormhole.

“I’ve told you about Green Fire Palace and taken you to where you should’ve been. If there isn’t anything else I can do for you, I’ll be taking my leave,” Yu Ding said, bidding Jian Wushuang farewell.

“Thank you for your help,” Jian Wushuang said gratefully.

“One more thing,” Yu Ding said. “If you wish to adventure on this battlefield one day, inform one of the Palace Masters first. He’ll give you some necessary objects. Everyone is eligible to receive some objects from the Palace Master before setting off.”

“Necessary objects?” Jian Wushuang asked curiously.

“Tang Emperor used to be one of the Palace Masters. I heard that you’re close to him. Maybe you’ll receive his Message Token. You just need to give it to him then.” Yu Ding smiled and then left.

Jian Wushuang’s face twitched. He was very interested in the objects.

There were numerous opportunities and secrets hiding in the huge battlefield around the Green Fire World. Jian Wushuang wished to have an adventure there but now was not the right time.

He was still not strong enough.

“Strength!”

With his eyes glinting, he clenched his fists tightly. Soon, he arrived at the Fire Points Exchange Office.

He hadn’t exchanged for the two treasures that might be of use for him.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ve put aside the treasures Dao Yuanzi left behind that could be useful to you. Exchange the rest for Fire Points and see how much you can get,” Gu King said.

“Alright.” Jian Wushuang nodded and handed his Interspatial Ring to the spirit to appreciate its value.

He got the result in just seconds.

“13,800 Fire Points?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Dao Yuanzi was an expert from the Blood Killing Sect of the Eternal Chaotic World. How could all of his treasures be worth only 13,800 Fire Points?”

The sum was smaller than he expected.

Gu King tittered. “You think too highly of Dao Yuanzi. Sure, he came from the Eternal Chaotic World but he was just an ordinary expert. He possessed some good treasures because he belonged to the Blood Killing Sect. The ones with great value—Blood-killing Plate Armor, Chaos Gold Bead, and Spaceship, are all things you might need in the future.”

“The other treasures aren’t that valuable. We’re already in luck to exchange them for that many Fire Points.”

Jian Wushuang agreed.

13,800 Fire Points was a small sum but he was satisfied that they were enough to exchange for two treasures that he wanted.

Jian Wushuang paid 10,100 Fire Points for the Golden Image Secret Skill and Killing Bead and then left.

Green Fire Palace, along with its many palaces and mansions, was located on a huge floating land. Many of its buildings were empty.

Jian Wushuang entered one of the unoccupied mansions, set a Restriction around it, and began cultivating without the interruption of the outside world.

He started with the Golden Image Secret Skill.

The skill was divided into three steps, with the last step being the strongest. It was purely defensive Secret Skill.

Usually, only those of or above the Celestial Master level were eligible to cultivate the first step of the Secret Skill, let alone the two other steps.

He was eligible to cultivate it because of his exceptional physical strength as a Three-star Imperial Kinsmen Ancient God.

The cultivation of the skill was a complicated process. It took him a year andgreat efforts to complete the first step of the skill.

He immediately noticed changes in his body after completing the first step of the Secret Skill. His skin would emit a faint golden light whenever he used his Spiritual Power. He looked extremely powerful. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Jian Wushuang, being a Three-star Imperial Kinsmen Ancient God, you’re stronger than ordinary Celestial Masters. Now that you’ve learned the Golden Image Secret Skill, your defense capability should exceed that of all Celestial Masters. More importantly, you still have the Blood-killing Plate Armor!”

“The armor could cut down 90 or even 99 percent of the force of the attacks targeting you. The remaining force could hardly hurt you!”

“Few Celestial Masters are now stronger than you in terms of defense. Of course, when you become a Dao Master or a Celestial Master combined with a Dharma Body, your defense will be even more exceptional,” Gu King said.

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists and felt delighted from the bottom of his heart.

He was aware of how strong his defense had become.

It might not be enough for him to ignore the attacks of Celestial Masters but coupled that with Gu King’s healing ability, it was good enough for him to last a long time in a battle against a Celestial Master of the Exceptional Realm.

Next, he began studying the Killing Bead.

“Gu King, you said that this bead is useful to me. What’s its purpose? I don’t even know how I should begin to refine it.” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He had tried refining the bead after obtaining it but failed each time.

What was the use of having a treasure that could not be tamed and recognize its master?

“Who said it’s necessary for the bead to recognize its master?” Gu King asked with a mysterious smile.
