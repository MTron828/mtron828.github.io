Chapter 158: Cloud Mountain Range

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“It is currently noon. Give me the cores at this time in seven days, then you will be counted as having passed the selection battle. Only then can you participate in the Easternmost Hunt in two months. Now, everybody enters the Cloud Mountain range!” After saying that, the Golden-armored General was finished.

Several dozen figures in the field immediately glided towards the nearby mountain range without any hesitation.

Jian Wushuang, Yang Zaixuan, Su Rou, and the other seven disciples of Dragon Palace suddenly moved forward as well.

Xue Yun directly floated towards the Cloud Mountain range too. On the way, he couldn’t help glancing at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang also glanced at Xue Yun.

Xue Yun opened his mouth, slowly mouthed a few words. Although he did not speak it out, Jian Wushuang could understand the words. It was, “You are a dead man!”

“Hum, who dies first is still uncertain!”

Jian Wushuang’s face was cold. In just an instant, the 68 Gold Core Realm experts participating in the selection battle had already entered the Cloud Mountain range.

It was a remote mountain range and normally few people entered it. But now, a fierce and bloody fight would be held there.

...

“Jian Wushuang, good luck to you guys,” said Baili Chen.

“Good luck.” Jian Wushuang also nodded.

Soon after, Baili Chen and several other disciples of Dragon Palace scattered.

The number of spirit beasts was just fifteen, with the same number of cores. That was to say, only a few people could get the cores. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

If the disciples of Dragon Palace Dragon stayed together, their overall strength was enough to get some cores. However, the distribution of the cores would be a big problem. So, they chose to fight separately.

“Second Brother, Fourth Sister, how about you guys?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I can get a core on my own,” Yang Zaixuan said coldly.

“I also want to use my own strength to make it through the selection battle,” Su Rou said.

“Alright, then we three will separate as well. We all must be careful. Even If it’s not possible to get a core, don’t worry about it. Staying alive is more important,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Hum, Su Rou and I only have to face the ordinary experts of the Earthly Dragon List. You, on the other hand, have to face Xue Yun. You need to be very careful. Don’t put yourself in a dangerous situation.” With his lip curled, Yang Zaixuan instantly left by himself.

“Wushuang, you have to be careful,” Su Rou said seriously.

“Don’t worry.” Jian Wushuang smiled. But soon he took back the smile and asked, ” Su Rou, let me ask you...”

After talking with Jian Wushuang for a moment, Su Rou left alone as well.

Jian Wushuang touched his nose. Soon after, he raised his head and looked toward the giant mountain in front of him.

“I’ll just choose this one.”?With a smile, Jian Wushuang stepped forward and glided toward the mountain.

The mountain was very huge. It took some time to find a spirit beast even when the mountain was very quiet.

But right at that moment...

“Howl~~~”

A fierce roar sounded from another nearby mountain, followed by an extremely violent aura.

Noticing the aura, the Gold Core Realm experts in the Cloud Mountain range all became startled.

“Yin-Yang Void Realm!”

“As expected, it’s a spirit beast in the Yin-Yang Void Realm!”

“Judging from the aura, it should be an ordinary spirit beast in the Yin-Yang Void Realm.”

These Gold Core Realm experts already understood.

When they were informed by the Golden-armored General that there were fifteen spirit beasts in the Cloud Mountain range, most of them already figured out that those beasts should be in the Yin-Yang Void Realm.

After all, the participants in the selection battle were all the most talented geniuses in Tianzong Dynasty. The weakest among them was strong enough to defeat the experts in the Initial Yin Void Realm, while the strongest, in the top ten on the Earthly Dragon List, could kill experts in the Initial Yin Void Realm.

In such a high-level selection battle, it was impossible for them to just face spirit beasts in the Gold Core Realm.

So when they noticed the aura of this spirit beast, none of them were surprised.

“The first beast has already been discovered, not sure who will get it though,”?Jian Wushuang thought. But he quickly put the thought at the back of his mind. Instead, he paid full attention to this mountain, which also contained a spirit beast.

Fifteen mountains, each with a spirit beast.

Boom!

A blazing energy suddenly roared from the top of the mountain. After immediately raising his head, Jian Wushuang saw a fierce Spiritual Power fluctuation. At the same time, he sensed a very violent aura.

“Ha-ha, the spirit beast is over there!” With his eyes glistening, Jian Wushuang glided towards the top of the mountain.

At the same time, there were three other Gold Core Realm experts who noticed. They also eyed this mountain.

In just a few moments, Jian Wushuang and the other three appeared on the mountain top. Together, with the Gold Core Realm warrior who was already fighting that spirit beast, there were five people on this mountain.

When Jian Wushuang appeared, the other four simultaneously looked towards him.

It’s understandable. Before the selection battle, Jian Wushuang had a fierce fight with Xue Yun and the fight ended in a draw. His strength was already recognized by everyone. He was certainly one of the most terrifying experts in this selection battle. So naturally, he would draw attention.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang looked at the spirit beast in the center instead of the four experts.

It was a leopard spirit beast with a purple pattern all over its body, like a purple cloud. The spirit beast was not big, but an astonishing and violent aura radiated from it.

“Demonic Cloud Leopard!”

Jian Wushuang smiled because he had already identified it. Soon after, he looked at the four and muttered, “It should be easy for them to kill the Demonic Cloud Leopard with their strength. However, they are waiting around. Apparently they are worried about something.”

Jian Wushuang was right. All of them were worried about a few things, and he was their biggest worry.

“Jian Wushuang, we four found this Demonic Cloud Leopard before you. It should be a contest among us four. You go somewhere else,” a red-robed woman among the four said.

This red-robed woman was the strongest among the four, she was also ranked 8th on the Earthly Dragon List.

Demon Girl Ling Xue’er, ranked 8th on Earthly Dragon List.

As per the ranking, Ling Xue’er was higher than him. But having experienced the fierce fight between Jian Wushuang and Xue Yun before the selection battle, Ling Xue’er felt some apprehension upon seeing him.

“Hum, this is a selection battle. Even if you guys get the core, I can still take it from you. Not to mention that you have not killed the Demonic Cloud Leopard yet. You don’t have the power to make me leave,” Jian Wushuang said and smiled coldly. While withdrawing the Triple-kill Sword from its sheath, a fierce sword essence suddenly rushed out.

“If you are not willing to leave, then I will have to drive you out,” Ling Xue’er said coldly, with an aquamarine Long Whip in her hand.
