Before Jian Wushuang could reach out to support Supreme Master Gai Fu, he saw Supreme Master Gai Fu wave his hand at Jian Wushuang, indicating that he was fine.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang could only stop what he was doing, but his heart sank.

Supreme Gai Fu’s body… won’t last much longer.

!!

When Supreme Master Gai Fu saw Jian Wushuang’s expression, he forced a smile on his face and comforted him, “Jian Wushuang, you don’t have to worry. Life and death are normal. I’m relieved to see your achievements today. Even if I really leave this time, I think that with you taking care of the Divine Life Palace in the future, the Divine Life Palace will definitely be better than under my leadership.”

The situation was not optimistic for the Divine Power Universe.

Although Jian Wushuang’s participation had basically secured the victory in the war between ordinary Supremes and Scar level Void Masters, the real deciding factor between the victory and defeat of the two universes still depended on the battle between the Invincible Supremes and the others, as well as… it was a battle between Void God and Cosmos God.

Thanks to the reinforcements from all directions, the number of Invincible Supremes in the Divine Power Universe was not much less than that of the 34 Void Masters. However, in terms of battle strength, they were still inferior.

White Ape, the Overlord Patriarch, was fierce and overbearing. Every punch had the power to explode stars. It attacked from the left and right. Under a series of indiscriminate attacks, it immediately suppressed the Right Void Emissary and forced him to retreat.

However, aside from him, the other Invincible Supremes were all at a disadvantage.

Wu Jianxian, who was originally invincible with her sword, immediately fell into a disadvantage after fighting the Void Master Gu Heng.

Void Master Gu Heng, an ancient figure who had once dominated an era in the Void Universe. In terms of cultivation time, he was several times longer than Wu Jianxian. All kinds of killing magical powers emerged from his hands, forcing Wu Jianxian to helplessly block without the power to fight back.

The most important thing was that the Void Master Gu Heng had a pair of copper rings. This pair of copper rings was hard and indestructible. They were unusually firm and had the ability to enlarge and shrink. The two copper rings were each other’s horns and could be pulled from left to right. It was extremely difficult to deal with.

“Absorb!”

Void Master Gu Heng put his hands together and shouted.

In an instant, a yellow light surged from the copper rings and extended out like a rope. One of the copper rings first wrapped around Wu Jianxian’s divine sword, causing the other copper ring to hang around Wu Jianxian’s body. Then, it suddenly tightened and bound Wu Jianxian.

Wu Jianxian’s expression changed. She wanted to break free, but this copper ring was like the five elements mountain that suppressed her. It grew as big as Wu Jianxian and shrank as she shrank. It did not give her the slightest chance to escape.

“Hahahaha, little girl, just surrender obediently. I see that you’re a good girl, so as long as you’re willing to be my servant, I’ll spare your life. If you’re more obedient, I can even ask the Void God Lord for a reward when I conquer this universe. It’s not impossible for you to be the master of a Star Field.”

Void Master Gu Heng laughed, but he did not show any mercy. A short blade the size of a finger suddenly appeared from the copper ring that bound Wu Jianxian, trying to kill her.

“You’re looking for death!” When Wu Jianxian heard this, a cold glint flickered in her beautiful eyes. Her killing intent had reached an extreme.

“Divine power, Shapeshifting.”

Wu Jianxian coldly spat out these words. As soon as she finished speaking, there was a flash of light from her body. Not far from her, a figure that looked exactly like her appeared out of thin air.

Bang!

Wu Jianxian, who was bound by the copper rings, was instantly ground to death by the copper rings, turning into a pile of shadows.

“Kill!”

Wu Jianxian’s face turned pale for a moment. Then, she took a deep breath and once again raised her sword to attack the Void Master Gu Heng.

On the other side of the battlefield.

A Six Scar Void Master with a pair of wings on his back and a hunched waist had his hands hanging down to his knees.

Then, his hands twisted and turned into two long and narrow sharp knives.

“Dragon clan? Hehe, I’ll eat you!”

The Six Scar Void Master stepped forward and leaped like a flying mantis toward one of the Third Generation Dragons.

His hands, which had turned into sharp knives, flickered with a fierce cold light in the air, enough to split the stars and cut the moon.

“Roar!”

Seeing this, the Third Generation Dragon’s eyes flashed with panic, and he spat out a planet-sized ball of purple poison.

…

The battle between the Invincible Supremes and the Six Scar Void Masters had become more and more intense and had entered a state of white heat.

Although no one had died yet, it was only a matter of time before the Invincible Supremes of the Divine Power Universe died.

At that time, once an Invincible Supreme died, the balance between the top fighting forces of the two universes would be broken, and the Void Universe would have free hands, creating a situation of two against one.

At that time, the defeat of the Divine Power Universe would be decided.

…

Turning back to the scene of Jian Wushuang and Supreme Master Gai Fu.

“A single spark can start a prairie fire.”

Supreme Gai Fu took a deep breath, and a determined look flashed across his eyes.

“Then I’ll use my old body to turn into the fire that will set the prairie on fire!”

Just as he was about to jump up and burn himself to become the first fire to burn the Void Universe, Jian Wushuang suddenly patted his shoulder.

“What?” Supreme Gai Fu turned his head, puzzled.

“Senior Gai Fu, I won’t stop you if you want to do something. However, before that, I want you to see something,” Jian Wushuang said softly.

Then, he flipped his right hand and an iron token appeared.

The token was given to Jian Wushuang by Supreme Dao Yan, the Palace Master of the Divine Life Palace, in the Land of Gods.

Supreme Gai Fu was stunned when he saw the rusty token. Then, his turbid eyes suddenly turned red.

It had been 100,000 void eras!

It was unknown whether the Palace Master of the Divine Life Palace was alive or dead, but Supreme Master Gai Fu was the one who carried the flag.

The world only knew that the Divine Life Palace had been established by Supreme Dao Yan, who was then guarded by Supreme Gai Fu.

No one knew that…

...

Back then, Supreme Master Gai Fu had been the shadow behind Supreme Dao Yan and the most loyal old servant.

“Young Master… he’s still alive?”

Supreme Gai Fu said.

He did not address him as Palace Master, but as Young Master. Perhaps it had been a long time since he had called him ‘Young Master’, so when he said it, it sounded a little stiff and obscure.

“Yes.”

Jian Wushuang nodded.

Supreme Master Gai Fu laughed when he received Jian Wushuang’s confirmation.

For the first time, he laughed freely, as if he had been relieved of a heavy burden, and as if he had nothing to worry about.

“Jian Wushuang, since the Young Master has given you the Palace Master Token, you are now the second Palace Master of the Divine Life Palace.”

“I… I have no regrets!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Supreme Gai Fu raised his head and looked at the battlefield between the Invincible Supremes and the Six Scar Void Masters.

An unprecedented powerful aura gushed out of his body!
