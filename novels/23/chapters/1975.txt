The experts fixed their gazes upon the ancient battlefield but they had never bothered with the surrounding void on the ancient battlefield.

When they heard Jian Wushuang’s comment, they looked at the surrounding void on the ancient battlefield through the light. Then, they noticed the difference in the void.

“Spacetime, spacetime storm?”

“Such a huge spacetime storm and this spacetime storm covered the entire battlefield?”

“My goodness, such a huge spacetime storm! I have lived for over a million of years but it is my first time seeing this!”

Many experts at the scene exclaimed in surprise.

The ancient battlefield was huge but the spacetime storm could engulf the entire battlefield. Its size could be well imagined.

Of course, with such a huge spacetime storm, the energy contained was definitely shocking too.

“Just a spacetime storm?” Jian Wushuang scoffed.

Among the experts, there were people who immediately found the unique point of the spacetime storm.

“No. Not just a spacetime storm, there is also a grand formation. In the surrounding void on the ancient battlefield, there is a grand formation. The formation merged into one with the surrounding spacetime storm, that’s why it is hardly noticeable,” an Emperor God explained. The Emperor God was an accomplished one in formations.

He said and the other experts had found the trace of the grand formation.

“There is really a formation and the formation is profound!”

“A huge formation merged flawlessly with the spacetime storm? This... who set up this grand formation?”

“Unbelievable, the grand formation is simply unbelievable.”

There were experts exclaiming in surprise again.

The exclamations were mostly from those who were accomplished in formations.

Because they had a better understanding of formations, they knew how difficult it was to set up such a huge formation. To be able to merge the formation with the surrounding boundless spacetime storm flawlessly, it was shocking.

“Impossible. This is impossible!”

“How could such a terrifying spacetime storm merge with the formation flawlessly?”

“Forget about us from the second era, even in the first era, there was absolutely no one who could set up such great formation. Even in the ancient era, he would definitely be a top Almighty in formations to be able to set up such a great formation!!”

Everyone was astonished.

All their gazes were surprised.

Regardless of if they understood formation or not, as long as one was experienced, they should be able to tell how unbelievable the grand formation was.

At least to all experts in Eternal Chaotic World, it was simply a dream to merge a grand formation to spacetime storm.

But then, someone had done it.

Jian Wushuang looked at the experts’ response in front of him with a faint smile. His voice slowly reverberated in the universe, “Can you all see clearly? Are you astonished? Are you excited? Do you find it unbelievable?”

His voice had a tinge of disdain.

All experts became quiet. All the gazes were fixed upon Jian Wushuang again.

They didn’t know what Jian Wushuang’s purpose was when he took out the pearl and showed them the true appearance of the ancient battlefield, the surrounding spacetime storm and the grand formation.

At that very moment, Jian Wushuang waved and his will power moved.

Rumble. Heaven and earth quivered.

There was a life-destroying aura that suddenly spread from the void above.

The experts at the scene were stunned and looked towards the light. In the end, they saw a scene that they would never forget for the rest of their lives.

They saw in the surrounding void on the ancient battlefield, the huge space spacetime storm that was originally stable all this while suddenly became extremely violent.

Hualala. Boundless spacetime storm started churning in madness to destroy the earth.

The extermination aura that filled the universe and the entire ancient battlefield was from the spacetime storm.

At that very moment, everyone could feel the aura that the spacetime storm gave out, an aura that could destroy heaven and earth.

At the same time, they could faintly feel the power contained in spacetime storm.

Plus, the power had already started brewing and becoming very aggressive and it continued to accumulate. It was as though the entire spacetime storm would rain down on the ancient battlefield the very next moment.

The scene shocked everyone.

“What, what is going on?”

“Such terrifying power. If it were to rain down at the ancient battlefield, I wonder if the ancient battlefield could still survive.”

“Gone. It’d be gone. If the power were to explode, the ancient battlefield would absolutely turn into a flatland. There wouldn’t be anything left!”

Many experts answered.

Then, all the gazes turned to look at one person.

“Jian Wushuang! Jian Wushuang!!”

“It was him who made the spacetime storm violent!!”

“What is he trying to do?”

The experts at the scene were staring with anger as they questioned him.

Then, there was unprecedented madness in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. His face grew red and his burst of malicious laughter suddenly filled the air, “Haha, you finally knew to be anxious? Knew to be worried? All of you seem pretty aggressive earlier!!!”

“Jian Wushuang, what did you do?” Colored Glaze Great Emperor roared.

“What did I do? Colored Glaze Great Emperor still can’t tell? Actually, it’s nothing. It’s very simple. I merely manipulated the formation around the ancient battlefield so that the formation could shake off the spacetime storm. But the spacetime storm is so powerful that it is inevitable that there is going to be power that overspills,” Jian Wushuang chuckled and spoke casually as though it was just a petty matter.

However, many experts who studied formation at the scene stared as they heard Jian Wushuang’s reply.

“No, no!!!”

The Emperor God who noticed the formation roared, “This formation was merged with the spacetime storm using an immeasurable method. The grand formation has become one with the spacetime storm, how could they be separated? Once they are separated, the grand formation will collapse instantly, then the spacetime storm will lose its balance and stir up a great commotion that will destroy the universe, destroying everything within the spacetime storm!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“The ancient battlefield has no space to struggle but will instantly be squashed into dust by the spacetime storm!!”

“All opportunities and treasures on this ancient battlefield, even all of us will vanish in an instant!”

“Stop it, Sword Emperor! Hurry up and stop it!!!”
