“Jian Wushuang.”

Master of Silence Gloriette said, “I have heard from Lord Wu Cang about your plan to go to the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. I have the map. But you had better not to go there.”

“Why?” Jian Wushuang raised his head to look at Master of Silence Gloriette.

“The Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries are extremely far from the Snow Kingdom, through a route of which is full of obstacles and danger. It is difficult to handle even for a Universe God in the Third Heaven.”

“I nearly died on the way to one of the sanctuaries.” Master of Silence Gloriette added.

Jian Wushuang frowned.

Even Master of Silence Gloriette, who was much more powerful than him, had almost died on the way to the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries?

“Jian Wushuang, the Eternal Chaotic World is full of danger. Even King Luo Zhen and the creators of the Lineage of Star could meet a deadly situation. But it doesn’t mean that you should step back.” King of Venomous Worms said.

“You are right.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“I recommend that you delay your plan and cultivate in my Snow Dojo for tens of thousands of years. It won’t be too late for you to go there when you become a Universe God of the Third Heaven.” Master of Silence Gloriette smiled.

Jian Wushuang said, “Thank you for your kindness. I know how dangerous the journey will be. But I am quite determined to go there.”

“Emm...”Master of Silence Gloriette thought for a while and said, “If you stay here, I could ask Master Luo, who is very good at swordsmanship, to teach you how to improve your swordsmanship.”

“Emmmm...” Jian Wushuang paused for a while.

He was surprised that Master of Silence Gloriette was trying whatever he could to convince Jian Wushuang to stay in the Snow Dojo.

“But in fact, the reason why I want to go to the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries is that I am going to meet my master there and learn from him.” Jian Wushuang said.

Master of Silence Gloriette finally gave up his efforts to persuade Jian Wushuang, “OK, since you already have a master, it is better for you to leave here and go there.”

He took out a token, saying, “Here is the map to one of the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. I only have one.”

King of Venomous Worms said to Jian Wushuang, the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries are close to each other. If you can find one, it is easy to find the rest of them.”

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang was very happy.

After Jian Wushuang left the palace, he took out the token immediately and started to read.

“My guess is confirmed. The Snow Kingdom was just a tiny place located at the margin of the Eternal Chaotic World, so many Gods – including me – didn’t know of the Snow Kingdom.” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Jian Wushuang, Master of Silence Gloriette is right. Going to the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries is really a daunting task.” King of Venomous Worms added.

“Why do you say so?” Jian Wushuang asked.

As we have already known the location of the Snow Kingdom, we now don’t have to follow Master of Silence Gloriette’s advice about the route. I will spend some time figuring out a solution and tell you after you come back from the Tian Yuan Mystery Land.

Jian Wushuang nodded.

He came back to his room and started to cultivate as usual.

Ten days passed. Thirty talents, including Tian Yuan Mystery Land, had gathered to go to the Tian Yuan Mystery Land.

They followed Deacon Green, the Chief Deacon, to the entrance of the Tian Yuan Mystery Land.

After a moment, the gate of the Tian Yuan Mystery Land opened.

Jian Wushuang entered into the land and saw a vast white space.

All the corners of the space were full of white smog.

And he felt an invisible power coming to him.

“The power is...” Jian Wushuang tried to figure out what it was.

“Do you also feel the power?” Long Hao asked Jian Wushuang.

Ten days ago, Jian Wushuang reversed the situation of the game and helped the Snow Dojo win the Ranked Battle. The rest of the twenty-nine members all showed their respect to Jian Wushuang.

They were very grateful to him.

Without Jian Wushuang, they would have had no chance at all to come to the Tian Yuan Mystery Land.

Long Hao also respected him a lot. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Yes, it is a consciousness attack.” Jian Wushuang answered Long Hao.

“Yes. You are the best at consciousness attacks amongst us. So you must know more about the power.” Long Hao said, “Consciousness is fundamental to us, no less important than our lives.”

“If our rivals from the Universe God Palace had a stronger consciousness, they wouldn’t be defeated in a short time.” He added.

“And Tian Yuan Mystery Land is a good place for us to cultivate consciousness.”

“Cultivate consciousness?” Jian Wushuang was interested.

Long Hao continued, “There has always been a powerful natural force in consciousness attacks. The deeper one is in the land, the stronger the attack is. We are now just at the margin of the Tian Yuan Mystery Land and the power is relatively weak. But if we go deeper or go to the second level, the consciousness attack’s power will soar!”
