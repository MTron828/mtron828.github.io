4914 Reappearance of the Lake-Style Sword Intent

That was a reaction that would only appear when a trace of life appeared in a desperate situation.

Chun Qiu clenched his fists tightly, unable to suppress the excitement in his heart.

“Big Brother Jian, Big Brother Jian is back!” Cui Jing waved his arms and shouted excitedly.

Wei Liujia let out a long breath. He felt that the hideous wounds on his body no longer hurt.

Prince Qian, who had been waiting for an opportunity to escape, felt relieved when he saw this.

However, he was still prepared to escape, because he didn’t think that a mere Yan Immortal would be able to turn this situation around.

The disdain and coldness in the eyes of the young man holding the True Sword in front of the Six Heavens Realm disappeared and were replaced by respect and anticipation.

Upon seeing this scene, the old Grand Yan Immortal who was originally somewhat bewildered immediately snorted.

Such a puny little Yan Immortal was just someone that could be easily crushed.

Now that he had killed the Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal protecting the Six Heavens, he was confident that no other Grand Yan Immortal on the battlefield could resist him!

Thinking of this, he lazily extended a finger and ordered, “Crush them!”

However, this time, a considerable portion of the Yan Immortals did not move, they all looked at each other.

This was because they noticed that their Great Heavenly Official was actually standing behind that mysterious figure.

“Why haven’t you attacked yet?” The elderly Grand Yan Immortal roared angrily. His voice seemed to want to tear the void apart again.

But next, among the 800 plus Yan Immortals, 300 of them looked ahead and nodded solemnly.

Behind Jian Wushuang, Shu Yang, who was wearing Flowing Cloud Silver Armor and holding a silver spear, took a step forward and said in a serious voice, “Anyone who listens to me, Shu Yang, will leave the battlefield immediately!”

His voice shook the void and caused ripples.

When the 300-plus Yan Immortals heard this order, they all rushed toward Shu Yang without any hesitation.

Immediately, the mighty army of Yan Immortals was left with only 400 or so, nearly half of the numbers before.

“Shu Yang! How dare you!” The old Grand Yan Immortal was extremely furious. In his eyes, Shu Yang was still just an ant.

Since he was an ant, he had to listen to him on the battlefield.

However, at this critical juncture, Shu Yang actually retreated at the last minute. How could he not be furious?

Shu Yang looked at him calmly and said in a clear voice, “I have an urgent order. I have no choice but to leave. We will not accompany you in this battle.”

When the old Grand Yan Immortal heard this, he was furious beyond words. “I’ll see if you dare to leave!”

After he finished speaking, he waved his arms. Immediately, a chain-like light shot out from his palms and went straight for those Yan Immortals.

In the next moment, something unexpected happened. Jian Wushuang’s figure quietly blocked behind the retreating Yan Immortals and then he pointed his finger.

In an instant, millions of rays of light burst out and collided with each other.

The two collided, and the shattered void was torn apart again, creating a thousand-foot-deep abyss.

The extremely beautiful light illuminated the entire void, and even the nearby Yan Immortals retreated tens of thousands of feet!

The aged Grand Yan Immortal’s turbid eyes widened to the maximum at this moment.

He could not believe that a mere Yan Immortal could block his furious attack.

After the light faded, Jian Wushuang, whose clothes were still intact, looked at him calmly and then turned to Shu Yang.

Shu Yang took a deep breath and cupped his hands solemnly. “Brother Wu, take care!”

After he finished speaking, he brought the 300-plus Nan Immortals and headed straight for the Immortal formation, disappearing very quickly.

At this point, there were only 400-plus Yan Immortals and a rank three Grand Yan Immortal left in the Void Battleground.

On the battlefield, a large space was suddenly cleared. The remaining Yan Immortals and top cultivators of the Six Heavens Realm heaved a sigh of relief.

Prince Qian calmed down and looked at Jian Wushuang in confusion.

He did not quite understand. With the appearance of that guy, this war seemed to be reversed?

No, impossible, a mere Yan Immortal wanted to turn the tables? It was simply nonsense.

Prince Qian shook his head in denial. Then, he seemed to remember something. His eyes widened in shock.

Then, he hurriedly went to Chen Qing, who was the closest to him, and asked nervously, “Is that Heavenly Official Jian of yours the one who killed Chang Duoling alone?”

Chen Qing glanced at him and unconsciously tugged at the jade belt around his waist. He said arrogantly, “That’s right. Chang Duoling is nothing. Watch how Heavenly Official Jian will turn the tide!”

Prince Qian slowly let out a breath of turbid air. He was also beginning to look forward to what kind of monster the Heavenly Official Jian was. This was the man who was able to fight against the Grand Yan Immortal with the power of the Yan Immortal.

The void returned to silence as all the Yan Immortals stared at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang looked past them and fixed his eyes on the old Grand Yan Immortal.

The familiar scene seemed to be happening again.

The battle with Chang Duoling was also the same. The only change was that this old Grand Yan Immortal seemed to have been a Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal for a long time.

The old man seemed to be even more unfathomable than Chang Duoling.

The battle with him was inevitable and Jian Wushuang felt that it was a tricky situation.

“Another guy who wants to die. Forget it, I’ll completely destroy the Six Heavens Realm today to prevent future trouble.”

The old Grand Yan Immortal said in a deep voice. At the same time, a scepter condensed in his palm and he slammed the void. “All Yan Immortals, listen up! Destroy the Six Heavens with all your might, don’t leave a single Yan Immortal alive!”

The Yan Immortal army seemed to be impatient, after receiving the order, they rushed towards the Six Heavens Realm.

Just then, Jian Wushuang’s cold voice rang out, “If you don’t want to die, go back the way you came.”

After he finished speaking, several Sword Intents shot out from his hand and flew forward.

A few of the fastest Yan Immortals had their Immortal Sources shattered, turning into dust. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

However, this was not enough to stop the army. Nearly 400 of them descended from the sky like dark clouds.

Looking back at Di Qing and the others who were heavily injured and could no longer fight, Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows slightly and then took a step forward resolutely.

He was facing the army of Yan Immortals alone. Every single Yan Immortal in the Six Heavens Realm, every single peak cultivator, all clenched their fists.

With his own strength, could he really withstand this attack? It was as if the mountains and seas were about to collapse onto him.

In the next moment, Jian Wushuang, who was all alone, suddenly had divine patterns all over his body. His entire body seemed to be made of billion Sword Intents, which was extremely dazzling and magnificent.

The entire void began to tremble violently.

The Yan Immortal who participated in that battle, when they saw this scene, were all shocked and excited to the extreme.
