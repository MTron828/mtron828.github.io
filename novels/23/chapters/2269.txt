Chapter 2270 Chaotic Warfare

In a dark Void some distance away from the battlefield.“Haha, the show has begun!” A cheerful laugh resonated as more than a dozen figures stood around.

They all had impressive auras and the One-Star Man was their leader.

They had been at the Void for some time already but had not yet decided to reveal themselves.

They were shocked when they witnessed the fight between Jian Wushuang and Bing Shan.

Now, they saw the war happening in front of their eyes as well.

“A hundred-odd experts, the weakest one a Chaotic Divine Demon. They really embarrassed themselves using so many people against two Chaotic Realms.”

“They have no choice. They can only demonstrate Chaotic Realm level powers anyway under the restrictions. If they go one-on-one, they will certainly die.”

“One-Star Man, the war has begun, should we just watch?”

The dozen people looked towards One-Star Man.

“No rush,” the One-Star Man waved his hand and said, “It’s not time yet.”

“The boy’s going against a hundred-odd Chaotic Divine Demon experts. You’re not worried?” a grey-clothed old lady asked.

“Relax, the boy is tougher than he looks and he learnt Inverse Cultivation. It won’t be that easy to kill him.” The One-Star Man smiled. He was confident in Jian Wushuang.

The grey-clothed old lady raised an eyebrow. “Seems like you know quite a bit about this boy, but what is the plan between you and that guy?”

“Seems like the plan relies mostly upon the boy.” The others all looked towards One-Star Man.

They had known for the longest time that the One-Star Man had a plan, but only a few people really knew what it was about.

Although they were Seven Star Black Sect experts, they didn’t have enough clearance.

They simply followed orders.

“No rush, soon you will know,” One-Star Man replied.

The grey-clothed old lady and the others looked at each other but did not question further.

The black Void at Heaven’s Horizon had already been immersed in the heat of war.

Bing Shan did not attack again and retreated back to Leng Ruxue’s side.

“Lord Bing Shan, how did it feel?” Leng Ruxue looked at Bing Shan.

“A bit aggrieving.”

Bing Shan looked at the place where Jian Wushuang had stabbed him. The wounds had recovered, but he could still feel the sting.

Before going against Jian Wushuang, he had never expected Jian Wushuang to harm him.

“My sabre essence armour was mainly Divine Power, supplemented with sabre essence. But the restrictions reduced my Divine Power to Chaotic Realm levels. If I had even Half Step Divine Demon Divine Powers, the armour would have never been penetrated by the Sword Emperor,” Bing Shan said.

Jian Wushuang’s Samsara was unique with its reincarnation techniques, but in the eyes of Bing Shan, it was no more than a parlour trick.

Unfortunately under the restrictions, parlour tricks were enough to injure him.

That was why Bing Shan felt aggrieved.

“I underestimated him, but it’s okay, it’ll all end the same. The Divine Demons would block him all the way, maybe even kill him. With them blocking, Sword Emperor would have no way to reach to you,” Bing Shan said.

“May not be that way,” Leng Ruxue shook her head.

“May not?” Bing Shan looked over astonished. “You think Sword Emperor could survive the Divine Demons’ attack?”

“More than just survive. He’s an Inverse Cultivation after all.” Leng Ruxue laughed. “Watch.”

Bing Shan was astonished but did not ask anything further and spectated the fight.

There were 138 Ancient Era experts making their moves on Jian Wushuang at the same time from all sides.

And they all demonstrated their abilities.

They did everything they could.

Some sealed spacetime to restrict his movements.

Some formed great Divine Powers to press against Jian Wushuang.

Some used long-range divine weapons like the Hong Jun Golden Swords against Jian Wushuang, and some directly charged against him.

Some used Soul Attacks... the widespread attack went for Jian Wushuang at immense speeds.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were gleaming.

The Blood Mountain Sword in his hand let out a loud scream as the sword essence pierced him.

“Scram!” A loud sound followed by endless Divine Power swept from the Blood Mountain Sword.

The sweep was like a multi-coloured Sword River in the sky.

And the Sword River was fierce and roared upon impact.

Several attacks directly bounced out, Spacetime Seals were destroyed and billowing Divine Powers retreated in an instant.

Endless Divine Power came bursting from Jian Wushuang’s body and formed a huge region around him.

He had filled the region with Chaotic Divine Demon level Divine Power. With that around, the Divine Demons could not use any Spacetime or Divine Power suppression methods against him.

Hualala~~

A sword appeared from the heavens.

It was a crimson sword, the person wielding it was a man beyond Chaotic Divine Demon.

The crimson light blocked the sun and went straight for Jian Wushuang. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Jian Wushuang lifted his head but did not pull out his sword. Instead, a huge sword essence concentrated in mid-air to form a sword shadow and slice it.

Dang!

A metallic collision could be heard, and the crimson sword bounced out.

Hong!

A ghost, billowed by nether light, appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, holding a battle sword.

Shua!

Shua!

Shua!

Three times the man swayed his battle sword.

The first sword went for his throat.

The second went for his heart.

The third went straight for his skull.
