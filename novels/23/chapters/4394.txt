4398 If the Heavens Go Against Me, It Will Die

“Kill!”

Supreme Green Dog flipped his right hand, and a Black God slaying spear appeared in his hand.

He knew that it was not the time to delay. He had to kill Jian Wushuang before he went through the Lightning Tribulation. Otherwise, once Jian Wushuang made a breakthrough, it would be unknown who would win.

Bang!

!!

Supreme Green Dog took a step forward and suddenly turned into a shooting star, rushing toward the Ninth Kalpa King!

Before he even arrived, a cold light arrived!

Thousands of lightning bolts exploded!

On the other side, Long Qing also cast a secret skill and spat out a Crimson Cannonball that had been compressed to the limit!

The two of them attacked at the same time!

The Ninth Kalpa King stood in front of Jian Wushuang, his white hair fluttering in the wind.

Facing the two experts who were charging at him at the same time, his expression was neither happy nor sad. His hands instantly formed a seal!

“The first tribulation, great destruction seal!”

Rumble!

A terrifying aura instantly condensed in the void.

This power directly formed a huge heaven handprint and pressed down ruthlessly.

The giant handprint was covered in palm prints, and each palm print was full of Dao intent. Not only was there monstrous divine power, but there was also an extremely brutal and destructive aura brewing. It slammed ruthlessly onto the Green Dog’s body.

Bang!

As the two attacks collided, a star in the surroundings was shattered!

“Break!”

Supreme Green Dog roared in anger, and a surge of majestic supreme divine power condensed on the God slaying spear, ruthlessly stabbing into the center of the palm imprint that covered the sky!

A hole appeared in the palm print, and Supreme Green Dog was instantly sent flying!

After doing all this, the Ninth Kalpa King didn’t even look at Supreme Green Dog. He turned his head again and faced Long Qing!

The second tribulation, the great suppression seal!

“The third tribulation, great. Yellow Springs seal!”

After two consecutive palm strikes, the scene in front of them suddenly changed.

In the sky, five towering mountains materialized and pressed down with billions of gravitational forces!

On the ground, a yellow spring that seemed to have been taken from the nine Serenities gushed toward Long Qing with a destructive aura!

The sound of water surging could be heard. The yellow spring was like a giant python, coiling up and coiling around Long Qing!

The red cannonball shot out from Long Qing’s mouth shot into the yellow spring. It only created a spray of water before it disappeared.

For a moment, the Ninth Kalpa King was fighting one against two, and he was not at a disadvantage at all!

Ka-chak. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The yellow spring river spiraled up and wrapped around Long Qing. The extremely corrosive water of the yellow spring River instantly corroded Long Qing’s golden robe.

“Ninth Kalpa King!”

Long Qing’s pupils contracted as he growled.

He had never expected that the Ninth Kalpa King, who was only a middle-grade Supreme martial artist, would be so powerful that he could compete with him!

In the distance, Supreme Green Dog’s face was gloomy, and his eyes flickered with killing intent.

One was Jian Wushuang, the other was a Ninth Kalpa King. The Divine Life Palace contained the two most powerful heaven’s favorites of this era!

“If we don’t kill these two today, Cosmos Temple will not even be qualified to compete with the Divine Life Palace in the future!”

Supreme Green Dog’s mind quickly flashed with thoughts. Jian Wushuang and Ninth Kalpa King were like two bright Twin Stars, too dazzling.

A Ninth Kalpa King was already so difficult for them to deal with. If Jian Wushuang broke through to the Supreme-being realm, wouldn’t they be able to sweep the entire universe if they joined forces?

Great universe secret skill, God-killing!!

After taking a deep breath, Supreme Green Dog suddenly used his killing move!

Rumble!

Heaven and earth suddenly began to boil. Countless cracks appeared in the void, causing a void storm and space fragments!

Behind Supreme Green Dog, a huge phantom of a ghost God condensed.

The apparition had a dog’s head and a human’s face, like a Soul Reaper who had walked out of hell. It slowly opened its eyes.

A pair of scarlet eyes shot out like laser beams. The next moment, The Phantom of the ghost God raised his black arm and a 10000-feet-long God-killing spear was raised by him, shooting toward the Ninth Kalpa King!

Rumble!

Countless voids crumbled and were annihilated. A river of stars was directly cut into two pieces by the God-killing spear, creating a violent sonic boom in the air!

This spear was destructive and overbearing to the extreme!

When the Ninth Kalpa King saw this, even he could not help but change his expression.

“Innate divine ability, Demon God evolution!”

The Ninth Kalpa King let out a low groan and directly used his innate magical power as a perfect chaotic lifeform!

In an instant, the Ninth Kalpa King’s already strong and powerful aura skyrocketed again!

...

A terrifying aura swept out, creating a void storm. Countless gusts of wind whistled and exploded.

In the center of the storm, the Ninth Kalpa King’s skin turned dark, and a crisscrossing divine pattern appeared on his body. It was extremely strange, as if a demon from the nine nethers had descended.

Bang!

This spear finally came and ruthlessly hit the Ninth Kalpa King!

This spear attack was simply too powerful!

If it were in the past, the Ninth Kalpa King would naturally choose to retreat and avoid the sharp edge.

But now, he couldn’t retreat. He could only take it head-on!

It was because Jian Wushuang was behind him!

Bang!

In an instant, this spear directly exploded Ninth Kalpa King’s hands that were blocking. It exploded dozens of times in Ninth Kalpa King’s body!

Pfft!

...

The Ninth Kalpa King opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of divine blood. His face instantly lost its color and became extremely pale.

Before he could recover…

“Roar!”

On the other side, Long Qing, who was entangled by the yellow spring River, finally revealed his true form after letting out a low roar. He transformed into a six-clawed Golden Dragon that was a hundred thousand feet long!

His eyes seemed to be spewing fire. With a casual pull of his claws, the yellow spring River water was directly torn into pieces.

“Ninth Kalpa King, you dare to attempt to defy the heavens? Go to hell!”

The next moment, Long Qing’s figure shuttled back and forth, directly crashing toward the Ninth Kalpa King!

“Going against the heavens?”

The Ninth Kalpa King wiped away the traces of divine blood at the corner of his mouth as if he had heard a funny joke. He said coldly, “Yinian…Divine Kingdom!”

Kacha!

In an instant, the power of a realm descended. The Ninth Kalpa King’s pitch-black hands tore, as if a scroll had been set off in the universe!

This was Ninth Kalpa King’s strongest unique skill. When he fought with Jian Wushuang, it was only a framework.

But now, this One Thought Divine Kingdom technique had completely matured!

Jian Wushuang’s improvement over the past tens of thousands of years was huge. How could his improvement as the Ninth Kalpa King be small?

Countless resplendent immortal radiance descended as mountains rose and stars flickered. In this divine kingdom, flowers, birds, beasts, insects, and rivers flowed, forming a world of its own!

The Ninth Kalpa King was like a god who controlled the world!

From the beginning to the end, his back was facing Jian Wushuang.

Even though his white clothes were stained with blood, even when he was facing two top Supreme martial artists, he did not retreat even half a step!

He didn’t speak much, but he exuded a boundless domineering aura!

Huala!

Then, the Ninth Kalpa King pulled hard, directly dragging Supreme Green Dog and Long Qing into the world of One Thought Divine Kingdom!

After taking a deep breath, the Ninth Kalpa King looked back at Jian Wushuang, who was breaking through to the Supreme level. A smile slowly appeared on his pale face, as if he was talking to himself, “Jian Wushuang, there aren’t many people that I, nine tribulations Wang pingsheng, think highly of. You count me in.”

“If I die, you take care of the Divine Life Palace for me. If I don’t die, let’s fight again!”

After saying that, the Ninth Kalpa King turned around and plunged into the One Thought Divine Kingdom with a resolute and decisive posture!

Even if he died ten thousand times, he would not regret it!

This was the Dao of the Ninth Kalpa King!

“In this vast universe, besides me, the Ninth Kalpa King, who would dare to hurt Jian Wushuang?”

“If Jian Wushuang can’t defeat them, I’ll defeat them. If Jian Wushuang can’t kill them, I’ll kill them!”

“If the heavens obey me, I’ll live. If the heavens defy me, I’ll kill them!!”

The Ninth Kalpa King’s cold voice came from the divine Kingdom.
