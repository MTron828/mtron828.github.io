Chapter 1351: Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng left

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

His head was cut off by Jian Wushuang!

The black-robed man stopped breathing. He died with his eyes still wide open and a shocked look.

When he died, he was still in shock from the fact that he was killed by a Universe God in the First Heaven.

And one who he would have been his prey.

But now the black-robed man was dead.

Boom!

He fell downward.

Finally, Jian Wushuang was relieved.

“Now I don’t have to escape any more,” Jian Wushuang thought, “thanks to the Secret Skill of Tian Yuan I got from the Tian Yuan Mystery Land.”

“This secret skill is much more powerful than I had imagined.” Jian Wushuang was excited after practicing the secret skill for the first time.

But King of Venomous Worms said, “The deeper cause is that the man from the Sky-devouring Clan has a consciousness at the same level as a Universe God in the Third Heaven. You already have the same soul power as a Universe God in the Third Heaven. So combing the Secret Skill of Tian Yuan and the Secret Skills of Star Palace, you can pose a threat to a high-level Universe God in the Third Heaven.”

“Also, he was not very well prepared.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Jian Wushuang had risked injuries and exercised the Secret Skill of Tian Yuan.

And he had succeeded.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Duan Lingfeng came to him and said, “Are you OK?”

“Fine.” Jian Wushuang smiled, “Thank you for your help just now.”

He was grateful.

Duan Lingfeng had indeed played an important role in the battle with the black-robed man.

Without Duan Lingfeng distracting the black-robed man, Jian Wushuang could exercise any skill to kill him.

“Did you use a consciousness attack just now?” Duan Lingfeng asked Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“You killed a Universe God in the Third Heaven with only the consciousness attack?”

“No, I combined other skills. And by the way, the black-robe man didn’t have a strong consciousness.” Jian Wushuang answered.

Duan Lingfeng felt that Jian Wushuang was avoiding telling the whole truth. He looked at him but didn’t mention anything else.

At that time, the spaceship was moving toward Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng.

“Master Duan and Brother Jian.”

Yu Shan smiled to them.

Yu Shan witnessed the whole battle.

He knew how powerful Duan Lingfeng was.

So he had to show his respect by calling Duan Lingfeng ‘Master’.

Jian Wushuang didn’t show his full power, but he cooperated well with Duan Lingfeng and created good opportunities for killing the black-robed man.

Humph! Duan Ling showed his hatred towards those who chose to hide in the spaceship.

Yu Shan and other Universe Gods in the spaceship felt embarrassed.

Jian Wushuang said, “Forgive them. They have no choice as they are not powerful enough.”

Yu Shan said, “Yes, Master. No one could contain that black-robed man except you. So we had to…”

Jian Wushuang interrupted him at that moment and spoke to Duan Lingfeng.

“I also have a spaceship not far from here. How about leaving the team and going together with me?”

“OK.” Duan Lingfeng didn’t hesitate and he asked Luo Yu and Luo Hai to come with him.

Luo Yu and Luo Hai followed Duan Lingfeng with hesitation.

Other Universe Gods in the spaceship were surprised, but they didn’t stop Jian Wushuang.

If they had been at the center of the Ancient Star Sea, they would beg Duan Lingfeng to stay because they needed his help to fight against danger.

But now, they didn’t have to do so as they would leave the Ancient Star Sea within one month.

Jian Wushuang waved his hands and summoned his spaceship.

He got on board the spaceship with Duan Lingfeng, Luo Yu and Luo Hai.

Then, they left.

“Humph, can’t we survive without them?” Someone from Yu Shan’s team said.

“How arrogant they are!”

“They believed that we would beg? Ridiculous!”

The Universe Gods had a heated discussion after Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng left.

They didn’t worry about their safety without them.

“Let’s go by ourselves.” Yu Shan said, leading the team to depart again.

But at that moment…

Boom!

With a resounding noise, a herd of Exotic Beasts flooded onto Yu Shan’s spaceship.

They were giant, colorful bats with sharp claws. They flew very fast, soon surrounding the whole spaceship.

“Damn it!”

Everyone was scared. And in an instant, the barrier of the spaceship was broken.

A ferocious slaughter began. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Oh no!”

“Oh my God!”

“Damn it!”

The Universe Gods screamed, asking Duan Lingfeng to give them a hand.

However, Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng had already gone far away.
