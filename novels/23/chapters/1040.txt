Chapter 1041: Bash My Way Through!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“The Ancient Monster Clan is already exerting enormous pressure on me by itself, now even Empyrean Patriarch is here!

“Things are turning bad really quickly.”

“Jian Wushuang! I’ve finally found you!”

Empyrean Patriarch fixed his gaze on Jian Wushuang before making his move.

Even though there was a considerable distance between them, Empyrean Patriarch’s huge hand came stretching toward Jian Wushuang, continuously expanding as it passed through the Void.

It came smashing toward Jian Wushuang, finally growing to the height of a huge mountain.

Jian Wushuang steeled himself and decided to meet the attack head-on with his sword.

“Heaven’s Bane!”

Immense Ancient God Power gushed into his arms in an instant, allowing Jian Wushuang to completely unleash the power of the three Sword Principles he created.

“Break through the attack!”

His move was extremely powerful and strong, and it smashed directly into the ‘huge mountain’.

Bang!

There was a huge sound and large amounts of power began to disperse into the surrounding at an insane speed, as if a lot of rocks were rolling off from the ‘huge mountain’.

Jian Wushuang grunted softly before stumbling a few steps back.

“He’s too strong!”

Jian Wushuang looked a little dumbstruck.

Empyrean Patriarch had just casually struck at him, and the power of his blow was already buffered by the great distance between them, but yet, Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship had been completely outclassed and he was even knocked back.

“Such power…”

“You really deserve your fearsome reputation, Empyrean Patriarch; your strength is indeed formidable!” Jian Wushuang gushed.

“Humph, yours is not too bad as well; you managed to withstand my attack. It’s no wonder that you managed to kill my son. Today, however, I will have my revenge!” roared Empyrean Patriarch.

“Revenge? Let’s see if you have the capability to do that,” growled Jian Wushuang. The next instant, however, he turned abruptly and dashed toward the Void at his side.

Evidently, he wanted to escape.

“Are you trying to escape?” Empyrean Patriarch sneered. “Do you think you’ll be able to do that?”

The look on Jian Wushuang’s face changed as he saw 10 figures suddenly appearing at the Void before him. “What?” he exclaimed.

The figures stood side by side, all of them giving off an aura of dominance. There was exactly three Peak Rank Three Dao Masters amongst them, while the other seven were close to achieving that status.

They were the 10 Protectors of Empyrean Patriarch.

At this moment, they stood before Jian Wushuang, blocking his retreat.

“Empyrean Patriarch is before me, while the expert of the Ancient Monster Clan is close behind. Furthermore, my only escape route is blocked by these 10 people,” said Jian Wushuang as his expression turned grim. Very quickly, however, there was a look of craziness in his eyes.

“The only remaining option left is for me to bash my way through. I don’t have a choice.”

The killing intent in Jian Wushuang multiplied quickly, as did the might of the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand. He easily navigated his way through the Void in a phantom-like manner, and he did not slow down in the least bit even though he knew that 10 powerful Dao Masters were in his way.

“He’s got guts. He’s trying to force his way through us!”

“Humph, he’s overconfident!”

“Since he’s courting death, let’s fulfil his wish!”

Each of the 10 Dao Masters wore a chilling look.

“Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!”

All of them struck simultaneously, just as Jian Wushuang was drawing near.

They had joined forces to take Jian Wushuang down. All of them were extremely powerful Dao Masters, and there were even three that possessed Peak Rank Three strength.

All of the attacks made were either quick and violent, berserk in nature or lightning fast.

Jian Wushuang looked unhinged himself as he rapidly struck out with the Blood Mountain Sword.

“Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!”

Ray after ray of sword light flew toward the Protectors; Jian Wushuang had unleashed the entire might of the Aurora Sword Principle as well as his own swordsmanship.

Sounds of weapons clashing rang out, and even though Jian Wushuang had used his full repertoire of skills, he only managed to block six of them. The other four hit him without any buffer, but luckily his defensive capabilities were so strong that they defied the natural order. As a result, not much damage was done and he only felt his blood churning.

“The kid’s defense is indeed strong!”

“So what? If the 10 of us join forces, he’ll still be dead by the end of the day.”

“Kill him!”

The killing intent of the 10 Dao Masters multiplied and in an instant, wave after wave of fearsome attacks came raining down upon Jian Wushuang again.

“Wait, my swordsmanship is still too slow!”

“I have to be quicker so that I can block all of their attacks at the same time.”

Jian Wushuang was looking pale, but at this moment, he was feeling completely calm.

He was in a state of unprecedented calmness and concentration.

It was what made Jian Wushuang unique. The tougher the situation, the clearer his thoughts became.

His eyes suddenly gleamed as he saw the attacks coming.

“Get lost, all of you!”

“Buzz…”

He unleashed his fearsome swordsmanship.

It looked as if he had just made one blow with his sword, but in reality, 10 sword lights had been released in an instant.

Not only were they traveling at amazing speed, but each of them were also terribly powerful. They seemed to smash right into the Dao Masters’ attacks simultaneously, and their power was completely unleashed.

Suddenly, the 10 Dao Masters were knocked back.

Jian Wushuang took the opportunity to sneak his way through their ranks. Just like this, he managed to slip out easily from their encirclement.

He immediately began to flee at an astounding speed the moment he shook free of their attacks.

The 10 Dao Masters, who took a while to steady themselves, were all feeling surprisingly excitable at having witnessed his escape.

“How was that possible?”

“How could his swordsmanship be so quick?”

“It happened so fast that even though he made 10 moves in one shot, it gave one the feeling that he only made one.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Three of us are at Peak Rank Three while the rest are advanced Rank Three Dao Masters. We couldn’t stop him even after joining forces?”

The Dao Masters were dumbstruck.

Empyrean Patriarch, who had not taken part in the attack and was standing on the mountain, felt extremely surprised too.

He thought that there was no way Jian Wushuang could have escaped the combined might of his 10 Protectors, and he did not expect his hated enemy to bash his way through their barricade.

He started to feel restless.

“A bunch of trash!” he shouted at the Dao Masters.

In the next instant, his figure had turned into a pitch black Flowing Light as it chased after Jian Wushuang with terrifying speed.

He was the swiftest member of the Sky-devouring Clan and he was known as the ‘Sky-devouring Bat’. As such, he was most confident about his speed.

He was so much faster than Jian Wushuang that he soon appeared close behind his enemy, even though Jian Wushuang had a huge head start.

“Empyrean Patriarch is extremely fast. I’ve achieved a breakthrough in my EAurora Sword Principle and made it reach the Universe Level, so my speed has increased greatly. Even so, the disparity between his speed and mine is very obvious,”?Jian Wushuang thought. He had also noticed Empyrean Patriarch’s appearance.
