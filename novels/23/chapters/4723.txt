4724 Entering the Heavenly Court

The sword strike was hundreds of millions of miles long, and its brilliant power poured out.

It was impossible for anyone to cause damage to any part of the world in the Great Yan Domain unless they were Yan Immortals.

Even Jian Wushuang had to borrow the power of the three Emperor Lords to destroy the river. The difficulty was obvious.

What kind of existence was this sword that had the power to destroy millions of miles of space?

“A bunch of ignorant people. Do you know that you have to protect the environment?” An extremely impatient voice resounded in the void.

Jian Wushuang looked at the source of the voice and saw a figure emitting a hazy brilliance standing in the distance. Even from such a distance, he could feel a supreme pressure that was beyond his knowledge.

However, the figure only appeared for a moment before it disappeared.

“This is just a warning. If you dare to cause any more destruction and treat all living things as nothing, you can all disappear.”

The majestic voice resounded through the void and only disappeared after a long time.

Such a terrifying sword move and such a mysterious figure had only appeared for a brief moment before disappearing.

Looking at the sword mark that tore apart the void, all the Yan Immortals’ mouths twitched. It was too overbearing.

The indiscriminate attack had killed nearly 20 Yan Immortals. If Jian Wushuang had not delayed the Young Emperor at the critical moment, the two of them would have died.

After recovering from the shock, Jian Wushuang looked at the remaining Yan Immortals and sneered.

The originally one-sided suppression situation was directly reversed by the mysterious man’s sword strike.

Including Jian Wushuang, there were 6 Yan Immortals and 1 Ancestor-level expert left on the Young Emperor’s side. On the other hand, there were only 12 Yan Immortals left from the enemies they had killed.

Just he and Chen Qing alone could fight against 12 Yan Immortals, not to mention the Young Emperor and the skinny purple-robed man.

The feminine Yan Immortal no longer had the heart to fight. After shouting out to retreat, he prepared to escape without a care.

An extremely dark vine seemed to grow out of nothingness and attached itself to his body with a strong aura of death.

The surrounding void seemed to stagnate, and even the Yan power in his body was stiff.

The great terror of life and death made this feminine Yan Immortal extremely terrified. “Quick, save me!”

However, the other Yan Immortals who fled in a panic did not even look at him. They all scattered in the void and disappeared.

What was waiting for him was an extremely terrifying experience.

Yan Immortal turned around with difficulty, unable to even speak clearly.

“Open your mouth and stick out your tongue.” The Young Emperor’s face was gloomy and he held a True Sword.

When he heard this, he was overjoyed in his heart. Even if his tongue was cut off, it would grow back in at most 1,000 years. At least, he could still keep his life.

Immediately, this effeminate Yan Immortal stuck out his tongue and mumbled, “M-many thanks, Young Emperor.”

The blade of the sword slashed across, and a section of the tongue was directly cut off.

He grunted and divine blood spurted out of his mouth. Before he could close his mouth, another sword pierced through his face. A terrifying Yan power came out of the blade and blew his entire head and Immortal Source into pieces.

Jian Wushuang took half a step back and frowned.

This Young Emperor’s killing intent was too strong, which was evident.

Without his head and Immortal Source, the Yan Immortal fell into the void without a sound.

In the entire void, only the remains of many Yan Immortals were left floating silently.

The Young Emperor slowly turned around and looked at Jian Wushuang with raised eyebrows. A stream of divine blood gushed out of his nose without warning

Then, he passed out.

The skinny purple-robed man seemed to have expected this. He grabbed the Young Emperor and ran straight into the Imperial carriage that had not broken yet.

Cheng Qing smiled bitterly and said, “His old issue is acting up again.”

Jian Wushuang did not ask any meaningless questions. He took Chun Qiu to the other Imperial carriages.

In this fierce battle, only three out of the ten Imperial chariots were left. On the other hand, there were almost no casualties for the thin-eared beasts that were like dragons and sheep.

Chen Qing waved his hand and grabbed the reins on the Imperial carriage before leaving and continuing forward.

They were intercepted halfway and only six of them were left. It was a tragic situation. If the mysterious man did not interfere, they would probably be in a situation where they had a 90 percent chance of annihilation.

At this moment, even Jian Wushuang was a little puzzled. How did he survive until now under layers of attacks? Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The carriage moved forward, and the only person sitting with Jian Wushuang was Chun Qiu.

“Brother Jian, does Prince Yan have any hidden injuries? Did you see that? This is the second time,” Chun Qiu said in a low voice.

Jian Wushuang thought for a while and then said, “I can’t rule out this possibility. According to the repeated attacks, it’s a miracle that he survived.”

When Chun Qiu heard this, he facepalmed and said, “It’s hard to believe that I, who wanted him dead the most, am actually standing on the same side as him.”

Jian Wushuang laughed and said, “When the time is right, we can leave.”

“I guess that’s the only way.” Chun Qiu nodded helplessly and then said in a low voice, “However, it’s easier now that we know he has an underlying injury. If we really have to fall out with him one day, we can also deal him a heavy blow.”

He shook his head and stopped talking.

There was only the faint howling of the strong wind left in his ears.

After another 20 days of travel, there were no more accidents.

The emptiness in the surroundings is about to reach the end, and is gradually replaced by a Heavenly Realm filled with vast Yan power.

The Yan power was so dense that it seemed to have substance. There was also the aura of living beings spread in the void.

The seven-colored rainbow stretched across the heavens and set up above the Heavenly Realm.

Walking through this place, it was as if one had entered a dream. It was relaxing and pleasant.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and pulled open the curtain in front of the window. After seeing this scene, even Jian Wushuang sighed.

The Nine-Side Super Heavenly Realm was like a gateway, like the stars surrounding the moon, setting off the vast Heavenly Court in the center.

There were thousands of waterfalls flowing down from the edge of the Heavenly Court like jade belts, which were indescribably magnificent and mysterious.

“Brother Jian, this should be the Heavenly Court of that Zhen Wuyang.” Chun Qiu’s expression was solemn.

Then, a restless movement came from the Boyang Bottle, and the cork was slightly opened. Then, the voices of the three Emperors rang out.

“Little Friend, what’s going on? Why do I feel like something’s wrong here?”

“Why does this aura feel so familiar? It makes me feel inexplicably irritated.”

Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly and said in a low voice, “Seniors, we should be entering the Heavenly Court of Zhen Wuyang now.”

“…”

“What? Little Friend, are you going straight to the lair of Zhen Wuyang? My True Shadow has yet to recover!”
