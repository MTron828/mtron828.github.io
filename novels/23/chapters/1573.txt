Chapter 1574: Jian Wushuang Is Here

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“It’s here. Even Lineage of Star didn’t know that there was a secret trap here. No wonder the experts couldn’t find him after so long.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and instantly sent Duan Lingfeng a message, “Just you wait. I’ll rush over to meet up with you really quickly.”

“Mm,” Duan Lingfeng nodded faintly.

Jian Wushuang immediately entered the Burning Demon Region and flew in the direction where Duan Lingfeng was swiftly. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

On his way there, he met a lot of experts who were searching for Duan Lingfeng in Burning Demon Region.

These experts were also Universe Gods, but there was quite a number of Real Gods too.

They saw Jian Wushuang too.

“Isn’t that Jian Wushuang?”

“It’s really him!”

“How could it be? Didn’t the rumor say that he lost all his power and became a disabled person? But from the looks of it, he has recovered all his power?”

The experts were astonished.

Many years ago, Jian Wushuang’s name had spread across Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. Even though most of the experts in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries never saw him in person, they at least watched the video or image of him launching an attack. Hence, they could recognize Jian Wushuang at first glance.

Very soon, the news about Jian Wushuang arriving in Burning Demon Region spread. The experts in Burning Demon Region who were searching for Duan Lingfeng were shocked.

After all, everyone knew that Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng were best friends.

The experts who had seen Jian Wushuang said that he had plunged over and there was a fluctuation of divine power. Hence, he most likely had already recovered his power.

That’s why he came to Burning Demon Region – to help Duan Lingfeng to get out of the difficult situation.

Four Symbol Mansion received the update and instantly asked about it with Hall Master Yuan in Lineage of Star.

Hall Master Yuan’s reply was simple, “Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng were best friends and he definitely would lend a helping hand to his friend. There’s nothing we, Lineage of Star, can do to stop him.”

“If so, I hope Lineage of Star doesn’t get involved. As for Jian Wushuang, we Four Symbol Mansion will try to ensure his life. Of course, if he were to kill our experts in Four Symbol Mansion, we Four Symbol Mansion will kill him without hesitation,” one of the higher-ups in charge in Four Symbol Mansion said.

“No problem,” Hall Master Yuan agreed straightforwardly but wasn’t worried about it.

…

In Burning Demon Region, it was covered with countless volcanoes and the territory covered a vast expanse.

Jian Wushuang, who carried his sword on his back, was plunging forward at full speed. On the way, although he met experts in Four Symbol Mansion, the experts in Four Symbol Mansion didn’t make it difficult for him.

However, some tailed behind Jian Wushuang and wanted to find Duan Lingfeng through Jian Wushuang. Unfortunately, Jian Wushuang was too fast, any ordinary Universe God, or even a Void Real God, couldn’t keep up with his speed.

Very soon, Jian Wushuang flew through the vast expanse and he was close to where Duan Lingfeng was.

Just then…

“Huh?”

Jian Wushuang suddenly lifted his head and saw at the end of his sight that two figures were charging over.

He knew one of them.

“Haha, Jian Wushuang, we meet again!”

There was a burst of malicious laughter from the void ahead and the two figures stopped before Jian Wushuang.

One was a middle-aged man in red armor. The middle-aged man was carrying an axe on his back and he was obviously a Void Real God and he was quite powerful.

As for the other person, he was a cold-looking, purple-haired man. It was Zi Dongwang, who had fought against Jian Wushuang in Wu Bei’s cave previously. The malicious laughter belonged to him.

Zi Dongwang was originally in the second place on Universe God ranking list, second to God Destroying King.

However, after the fight in Wu Bei’s cave, he had fallen to the fourth place, behind Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng.

However, as Jian Wushuang had lost his power entirely before, his ranking on the Universe God ranking list had vanished. Hence, Zi Dongwang had returned to third place.

Zi Dongwang stood in the void as he glared at Jian Wushuang. He felt Jian Wushuang’s aura and the fluctuation of divine power in him. There was a glimpse of coolness in his eyes, “It seems that your power has really recovered?”

Zi Dongwang was arrogant and unwilling to admit defeat. Back when he had found out that Jian Wushuang had lost all his power and become a disabled person, Zi Dongwang had been gratified by his misfortunes.

He was thrilled by the fact that he had returned to the third place on Universe God ranking list.

Then, Duan Lingfeng was facing life and death danger, and he immediately rushed over. Not only for the one billion Chaos Gem bounty that Four Symbol Mansion offered, but he also wanted to see Duan Lingfeng be killed with his own eyes.

He harbored deep hatred against Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng.

He wanted them to be dead.

“Zi Dongwang, I have other matters to attend to. I have no time to spare to talk nonsense with you. Move away,” Jian Wushuang glared at Zi Dongwang before him with his pair of cold eyes.

“Hehe, go ahead if you want to leave. I will not stop you,” Zi Dongwang sneered.

Jian Wushuang moved without hesitation and detoured around Zi Dongwang to continue to plunge forward in the void.

Zi Dongwang didn’t stop him, but just as Jian Wushuang passed by him…

“Jian Wushuang definitely knows the location of Duan Lingfeng. Let’s go, let’s follow behind him. We can definitely find Duan Lingfeng if we tail him,” Zi Dongwang looked at the Void Real God who carried an axe on his back next to him.

Then, they followed behind Jian Wushuang.

The two of them were extraordinarily powerful and rather good at traveling speed. They could totally keep up to Jian Wushuang’s speed.

Looking at the two followers behind him, Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

“Zi Dongwang, I have no time for you. Go away!” Jian Wushuang bellowed.

“Haha, Jian Wushuang, I didn’t stop you. You can go wherever you like. As for if I want to follow you, that’s my own business. Who are you to interfere?” Zi Dongwang scoffed.

Jian Wushuang immediately stopped and turned around to look at Zi Dongwang.

Zi Dongwang immediately stopped too and looked at Jian Wushuang as they maintained a distance of more than a thousand miles.

“Zi Dongwang, let me ask you one last time. Are you leaving or not?” Jian Wushuang asked in a low voice.

“I’m not leaving. What can you do about me?” Zi Dongwang teased.

Forget about the fact that Jian Wushuang’s power had recovered to his peak, even so… Jian Wushuang at his peak was much stronger than him, but not that much stronger.

Plus, there was a void Real God who was extremely strong next to him. If they were to team up, they could totally fight evenly with Jian Wushuang, or even suppress Jian Wushuang.

If so, what was there to be afraid of?

That was what Zi Dongwang thought.

However, what he didn’t know was that Jian Wushuang’s peak condition that he thought of had remained at the level twenty-thousand years ago when they were in Wu Bei’s cave.

But then, twenty-thousand years later, Jian Wushuang already passed the third inverse cultivation test!
