“Humph, no wonder you dared to fight against me. It turns out that besides Emperor Thirteen, you have another Great Emperor expert with you.”

Great Emperor Colored Glaze was cold, “However, even though he was a Great Emperor, there is a difference in power. With him alone, can he hold me back?”

Great Emperor Colored Glaze had terrifying chilliness and it soared up again.

Hualala. Everything in the universe seemed to freeze.

There was suddenly a green spear in Great Emperor Colored Glaze. The spear was three meters long and gave out a cold aura.

Great Emperor Colored Glaze moved and was already in action.

Hong!

There was suddenly a huge ice hole in the spacetime. Then, the cracks extended.

From the huge ice holes, “Roar!!!”

There was a terrifying roar and a primeval beast substantiated from the ice.

Along with billowing power, the primeval beast was already before Jian Yi.

Jian Yi looked cold as he was engulfed in the core of the crimson ocean, just like a Blood God. He stole a glance at the primeval beast and he immediately pointed.

He pointed and heaven and earth became quiet!

The primeval beast that was substantiated from ice suddenly had a hole in its chest. There was boundless divine power and it instantly shattered the primeval beast into pieces.

The primeval beast just broke apart and there was a tall, cold figure that broke the air. Great Emperor Colored Glaze carried no emotions and the gloomy spear in her hands burst out mercilessly.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

It burst out continuously for a total of nine times.

Every time it burst out, there was a brilliant white light in the void.

The speed couldn’t be described even with thunder or lightning.

Most importantly, the nine bursts sealed the space time and locked Jian Yi so he had no chance to dodge. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Humph!”

Jian Yi’s face grew dim but both his hands moved.

“Blood Demon Hand!”

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

There were continuous crimson palm prints that appeared. Similarly, he did it nine times.

With every clap, the crimson palm print would turn into a huge mountain. The huge mountain had a churning crimson cloud, just like a volcano.

Great Emperor Colored Glaze stabbed with her long spear and there was boundless chilliness.

The volcano and ice finally collided.

Hong!

There was a ferocious bang.

The entire universe was covered in boundless ice and crimson cloud. It became glorious scenery.

Jian Wushuang stood in the nearby void and could clearly feel the clashing of two bolts of power. There was a spark in his eyes at the sight.

A Great Emperor’s power was much stronger than an Emperor God’s.

In terms of power, it wasn’t comparable.

Just then... Swoosh!

There was a figure that burst out of the core of the battlefield. It was Jian Yi.

As for Great Emperor Colored Glaze, she was still standing at the core in the universe. The shocking chilliness filled more than half of the universe.

It was obvious that Great Emperor Colored Glaze had the upper hand in the fight.

“Humph, merely the level of a Great Emperor and you want to stop me with such a standard of fighting power?” Great Emperor Colored Glaze roared coldly.

Then, Jian Wushuang’s eyes dilated in shock.

Jian Yi had only recovered to Peak Chaotic Realm but had yet to reach his most powerful status. In terms of power and strength, he was weaker than Great Emperor Colored Glaze in the sixth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

However, Jian Yi was an expert from ancient times after all. He had many skills.

As expected, after Jian Yi was defeated by Great Emperor Colored Glaze, his figure suddenly became ghostly. Then, there were crimson shadows that suddenly appeared from nowhere.

The densely dotted crimson shadows clustered in the surrounding void.

With naked eyes or even with Soul Power, no one could determine which one among the crimson shadows was Jian Yi’s original body.

Until Jian Yi attacked...

Wow!

There was a palm that appeared behind Great Emperor Colored Glaze silently. The palm extended its finger and the tip of the finger was covered from crimson light as it pointed at Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s head.

Behind Great Emperor Colored Glaze, there were ice cones that were two meters long that appeared from nowhere. There were a total of a dozen cones that flew out at the same time.

The ice cones were extremely fast and he wasn’t affected. It pierced Jian Yi’s body but didn’t touch his original body at all.

Swoosh!

Jian Yi’s body was ghostly and he appeared next to Great Emperor Colored Glaze again.

“This person is so fast? The manipulation method of his spacetime power is impressive too,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze creased her eyebrows.

But suddenly... Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s five meters tall body extended two heads and four arms. In addition to Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s own head and arms...

Three heads and six arms!

It also contained a unique power superposition method. Both heads and arms could flawlessly collaborate.

Her six arms held the cold spear and stabbed Jian Yi mercilessly. Besides, on her three heads, one of her eyes was shimmering in a strange light which was captivating.

The second head roared with her mouth open and her roar shook the spacetime.

The last head had the third eye opened in between her eyebrows. Then, there was a resplendent light that contained boundless destroying aura that burst out at Jian Yi.

Jian Yi creased his eyebrows. He was forced to retreat once again by Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s skills.

His speed and his manipulation of power of spacetime were far ahead of Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s.

With his speed and manipulation of power of spacetime, Great Emperor Colored Glaze performed three heads and six arms and also many other skills during their fierce battle but couldn’t do anything about Jian Yi. Both parties were matched evenly and Great Emperor Colored Glaze barely had the upper hand.

“Great Emperor Colored Glaze lives up to being in sixth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. She is very powerful and she has many skills hidden up her sleeve,” Jian Wushuang muttered. “It’s a pity that Jian Yi’s power only recovered to Peak Middle Stage Chaotic Realm not too long ago and he is still a little far off his prosperous peak. Otherwise...”

However, Jian Yi could fight with Great Emperor Colored Glaze to this state, it was already good enough.

On the battlefield, Great Emperor Colored Glaze looked extremely cold.

“This person’s manipulation of power of spacetime is so strange. Luckily, he isn’t as powerful as I am, otherwise... I’m afraid I might not be his match,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze knew her limitations. When she had been fighting with Jian Yi, Great Emperor Colored Glaze had constantly looked at Jian Wushuang.

“However, I can do nothing about this person. There’s no point in continuing to fight with him. He obviously is only listening to Jian Wushuang’s command. As long as I capture Jian Wushuang, I can control him!”
