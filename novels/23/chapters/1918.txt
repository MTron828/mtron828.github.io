Chapter 1919: Another Incident

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Almighties Alliance was gone.

The large amount of experts vanished into thin air under Jian Wushuang’s one stroke.

Only Emperor God Xiu Luo barely survived under the sweep of sword light due to his strong power and strong defense. However, it was pushing his limits.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were four resplendent golden lights that burst out simultaneously. Emperor God Xiu Lui’s eyes were wide open but he couldn’t counterattack at all.

The golden light pierced his head directly. Emperor God Xiu Luo was killed on the spot.

Then, all experts from Almighties Alliance were all dead.

The scene struck fear in all experts from Star Extermination Alliance and Supreme Ten Alliance.

“Almighties Alliance is gone and you’re next,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold and he glanced at the experts from the other two alliances.

They understood Jian Wushuang’s cold gaze and the experts from the other two alliances lost all will to withstand him.

“Run!”

“Hurry up and run!”

“The demons are coming for us!”

The experts from the two alliances were terrified by Jian Wushuang’s terrifying stroke.

Their pride as Almighties was then non-existent.

At that very moment, they weren’t experts who were high and mighty. They were merely commoners, or not even commoners, but a nonentities.

What they wanted to do then was survive.

They only wanted to survive.

As for their resentment or the Secret Skill of Star Palace, they couldn’t be bothered about it then.

They didn’t dare to even think about it. They were dumbstruck by Jian Wushuang’s stroke.

Although there were still people who were rational in the two alliances, they knew that Jian Wushuang had performed the Secret Skill of Star Palace earlier that heightened the power of the stroke to that level.

In a short period of time, he definitely couldn’t perform another stroke.

They themselves knew that but they couldn’t stop the other experts who were terrified.

“Come back, hurry up and come back!!!” Palace Master Wu Luo roared.

“Calm down. We still have fighting power!” The Master of Emperor Sword Sect roared too.

Emperor God Wu Yao and Number One Divine King also wanted to turn the situation around.

But it was useless. The experts who were terrified already couldn’t hear what they were saying.

They felt devastated and they were defeated.

Then, if there were to be an only option to turn the situation around, it’d be someone’s arrival to kill Jian Wushuang on the spot.

As long as Jian Wushuang died, the experts could calm down and continue to fight.

But the crucial question was who could kill Jian Wushuang among the two alliances.

Emperor God Tian Ling?

He was occupied by Jian Yi. On top of that, since the beginning of the fight, Jian Yi had performed countless techniques and skills. In terms of power, Jian Yi was finally stronger than him.

With Jian Yi around, he didn’t have any chance to attack.

As for the others, it was impossible for them to kill Jian Wushuang.

“Lost, we’ve lost!!!” Palace Master Wu Luo muttered.

Although he wasn’t willing to admit it, he knew that they’d lost.

With three alliances, the fighting power of a total of over two hundred Almighties suffered a crushing defeat by Lineage of Star.

Under Jian Wushuang’s shocking stroke, they were terrified.

They were heavily defeated in the war!

They were in a fix.

“Let’s leave too. If we don’t go now, our lives will be threatened.”

Emperor God Wu Yao and the Master of Emperor Sword Sect stood side by side as they sighed.

Without hesitation, the few Peak Emperor Gods started running too.

The two alliances were defeated!

“Haha, everyone, kill them!”

The guest elders from Lineage of Star started chasing after them under the lead of Emperor God Jiu Yin.

Although they found it hard to calm themselves down, they knew that Jian Wushuang was on their side.

With such an amazing existence, they felt even more confident.

“Kill! Die!!!”

The guest elders roared madly.

Before the war started, they never thought that Lineage of Star could defeat all three alliances alone.

They had never expected it, nor had they imagined it.

But then, it became reality.

The experts from the other two alliances were fleeing while Lineage of Star chased them out. As both parties shuttled to and fro in the galaxy, they arrived at the border of the galaxy very soon.

The galaxy formation collapsed when Jian Wushuang gave full play to his Emperor Sword Principle. It couldn’t recover in a short period of time. Hence, the experts from the two alliances had a chance to escape.

If that weren’t so, Hall Master Yuan could totally take control of the galaxy formation and make all the experts from the two alliances stay back.

But then, he could only watch as the experts from the two alliances ran outside the galaxy.

However, just as Lineage of Star intended to continue to chase after them…

In an ordinary void outside the galaxy, there was a figure in a black robe standing there in silence.

He was covered by the black robe and his appearance was unclear. The surrounding void was also filled with boundless darkness.

“Jian Wushuang is really capable. He could kill all one hundred of experts from Almighties Alliance with one stroke…” The black-robed figure muttered. “The sword principle he performed just now was Emperor Sword Principle. However, when he performed Emperor Sword Principle, he also played the Secret Skill of Star Palace. Looking at the power exploded from the sword principle, he should have successfully cultivated the third volume of the Secret Skill of Star Palace!”

“The third volume increases power by a thousand times!

The black-robed figure couldn’t help but clench his fist.

The Secret Skill of Star Palace was very scary.

Because it was scary, the experts in Eternal Chaotic World, including some Great Emperors, were tempted by the secret skill.

Then, Jian Wushuang gave full play to the true scariness of the Secret Skill of Star Palace through the terrifying stroke earlier.

“That earlier stroke already reached the limit of a Great Emperor. Among the Great Emperors in Eternal Chaotic World, besides Emperor Bai, there shouldn’t be anyone else who could give play to the similar power. Even I can’t do it,” the figure in a black robe muttered to himself. Through his remark, he affirmed the Secret Skill of Star Palace.

“Such a powerful secret skill fell into Lineage of Star’s hands. It is too wasteful. Let me carry on and promote this secret skill!”

Just as he spoke, the black-robed figure had already moved forward in the void.

In the void outside the galaxy, the chase continued. The two alliances had already paid an extremely heavy price during the chase. However, Lineage of Star did not intend to let them go.

But suddenly… Rumble.

There was boundless darkness that suddenly flowed out. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The entire universe instantly drowned in boundless darkness, like Abysmal Acheron!

At the very core of the boundless darkness, a black-robed figure slowly stepped out.

Looking at the newcomer, everyone was shocked and there was fear in their eyes.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes also dilated in shock.

“Abysmal Saint Master!!!”
