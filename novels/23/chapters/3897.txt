Chapter 3901: The Lord Invites You

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Emperor Sha was well-known as one of the top five experts in the Magic Dragon Field. In the Magic Dragon Field, who would dare to cause trouble for him except for the Magic Dragon Lord?

Jian Wushuang was different.

He was only a Principles Master, and he had just become famous. Moreover, he had the principle Supreme Treasure Divine Sword, so it was not surprising that he was targeted.

“It’s the four of them.”

Emperor Sha had recognized the four approaching people through his soul power. He immediately frowned and said, “Master, I’m afraid we’re in trouble.”

“Trouble? Do you think I’m afraid of trouble in the Eternal Dark Prison?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Emperor Sha was stunned. He immediately thought of Jian Wushuang’s identity and felt relieved.

Soon, the four people appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and Emperor Sha.

They were two men and two women. Their auras were extremely powerful. The leader was an enchanting woman in a red robe.

“Master, these four are experts around Demon Dragon Lord. Each of them is extremely powerful. They can be called the strongest experts in the dark zones. The leader, Red One, is no weaker than me in terms of strength,” Emperor Sha said softly.

“Yes, I know all of them.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. He had already obtained information about some of the top experts in the Demon Dragon Realm.

The four people in front of him were all around Demon Dragon Lord. The red-robed woman, Red One, was the most famous and powerful one. The rest of them, including the Dark Fire Ruler, Demon King Myriad Bones, and Marquis Suxin…all of them had the battle strength of the strongest experts in the dark zones. They were no weaker than Thousand-edge Demon Monarch and Blood Rain Demon Monarch.

“They must have come to find me on the order of Demon Dragon Lord.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. “It seems that my presence has attracted the attention of Demon Dragon Lord. However, he didn’t come in person. He only sent four experts under his command…”

Jian Wushuang hoped that Demon Dragon Lord would come in person, but apparently, he did not.

“Emperor Sha, don’t expose the fact that you’ve become my slave,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Understood.” Emperor Sha nodded.

At this moment, the eyes of the four experts were fixed on Jian Wushuang and Emperor Sha.

“The aura of the Principles Master’s divine power and his appearance are the same. He should be Blood Sword Master.” The red-robed charming woman, Red One, glanced at Jian Wushuang with a strange light in her eyes, then she looked at Emperor Sha, who was beside her.

“Emperor Sha? He’s with the Blood Sword Master?” Red One frowned slightly.

Emperor Sha was famous in the Magic Dragon Field, and his strength was no weaker than hers. In the entire magic dragon field, even if the Magic Dragon Lord attacked him personally, he might not be able to kill him.

If Emperor Sha was standing beside the Blood Sword Master, it would be a big trouble for her.

“Red One, the other three, why aren’t you following Demon Dragon Overlord’s side? Why are you here?” Ruler Emperor Sha crossed his hands behind his back as he calmly stared at the four people before him.

“Emperor Sha, we’re not here for you. We’re here for Blood Sword Master,” Ruler Red One said.

“Are you here for Blood Sword?” Ruler Emperor Sha pretended to be deep in thought. “Why are you looking for him?”

“My lord heard that an incredible genius has appeared in Demon Dragon Region. He has comprehended a thread of universe principle at the level of a Principles Master, and his combat power is no weaker than that of a third-level Ruler. My lord is extremely curious about such a genius, which is why he has ordered the four of us to invite Blood Sword Master to Demon Dragon Castle as a guest,” Ruler Red One said.

“A guest? Haha, I’m afraid that being a guest is a lie. Snatching the principle true treasure sword from Blood Sword is the real deal, right?” Ruler Emperor Sha snickered.

“Emperor Sha.” Ruler Red One’s eyes turned cold. “This is an order from his lordship. My lordship wishes to invite Blood Sword Master to Demon Dragon Castle as a guest. This has nothing to do with you. You should hurry up and move aside.”

“Hmph. My apologies. I regret meeting Blood Sword too late. I’ve already decided that he is one of my best friends in this Eternal Prison. You want me to move aside? impossible. Even if the Demon Dragon Ruler personally comes, I won’t give him face.” Ruler Emperor Sha snorted coldly.

“It seems that Emperor Sha wishes to offend my liege for the sake of the bloodsword Ruler.” Ruler Red One’s gaze turned cold as they glanced at the three Rulers, they whispered, “If Emperor Sha wants to interfere in this matter, it won’t be so easy. However, my lord wants us to bring Blood Sword Master back. His orders must be obeyed.”

“How about this? Later on, we’ll make a move. I’ll be responsible for entangling that Ruler Emperor Sha while the three of you work together to take Blood Sword Master down as quickly as possible. If we can’t capture him alive, we’ll kill him and seize his principle true treasure Divine Sword.”

“Yes.”

“Understood.”

Dark Fire Ruler, Demon King Myriad Bones, and Marquis Suxin all nodded in unison.

Boom!

A surge of aura suddenly swept up from Ruler Red One’s body. Her red robes also blew up, creating endless air waves.

“Emperor Sha, you don’t even care about my lord. I’d like to see what you’re capable of!” Ruler Red One shouted, and in an instant, endless red clouds surged, an overwhelming wave of red clouds swept toward Ruler Emperor Sha.

“Master.” Ruler Emperor Sha Glanced at Jian Wushuang.

“It’s okay. Just fight with Ruler Red One. As for the other three, let them join hands to deal with me.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Ruler Emperor Sha nodded and immediately charged forward. In the blink of an eye, he and Ruler Red One had engaged in a frenzied battle.

Each of the two top experts had the battle strength of the top five experts in the Magic Dragon Field. When they fought each other, their movements and power were astonishing.

While the two were fighting, the Dark Fire Ruler, Demon King Myriad Bones, and Marquis Suxin also moved. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Blood Sword Master, surrender obediently. We can spare your life. Otherwise…” Dark Fire Ruler was surrounded by layers of black flames, and his eyes were filled with killing intent.

“The three of you are not qualified to make me surrender.” Jian Wushuang smiled, but his heart was moved. “The three experts are the strongest in the dark zone. Since I improved the two sword formations, I have been wandering in the dark zones of the Magic Dragon Field for 110 years. Although I have fought with many experts, I have only fought with one person. So far, I have not used the two sword formations to fight two or three people at the same time.”

“With the three of them working together, I might be able to find some principles in the sword formation.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with fighting spirit. Seeing the three experts charging at him, he took out the Wu Qi Divine Sword and waved it. The endless essence immediately swept out.
