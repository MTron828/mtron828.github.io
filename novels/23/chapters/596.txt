“Hehe, since you’re here, why are you in a hurry to leave?”

Marquis Zizhong immediately perceived a surge of unprecedented killing intent sweeping toward him.

Marquis Zizhong came to a halt as his eyes bulging wide with fear and he found himself wet with sweat.

At this point, he felt like he would fall into the abyss if he took another step forward.

“Hum!” Jian Wushuang snorted.

His voice smashed into Marquis Zizhong like a hammer, causing the latter to spit out a mouthful blood as he started to fall.

Marquis Zizhong fell on the ground and knelt with an extremely pale look. Then he raised his head while staring at Jian Wushuang in terror.

He knew Jian Wushuang had reached the Cloud Realm and that he was unable to match him, but he did not expect that his strength had improved to such an unbelievable level. The young man’s killing intent was strong enough to make an Eight-cloud Realm marquis unable to resist.

He did not know that Jian Wushuang had used his aura to suppress and defeat Fire Ghost who ranked first among the 72 Marquises, let alone him.

“Sir, please have mercy!” Marquis Zizhong implored him, ignoring his own face.

Upon seeing this, Marquis Guyang and Lin Lan were petrified.

What did they just witness?

Marquis Zizhong begged for mercy?

“Master, he...” Lin Lan looked over at Jian Wushuang in excitement.

“Your master, he, he...” Marquis Guyang was struck dumb.

He had thought Jian Wushuang paid a visit to them because Lin Lan had become a marquis, but now...

Jian Wushuang paid no attention to this couple. He threw an icy stare at Marquis Zizhong. “Zizhong, honestly answer my questions. If I’m in a good mood, I might let you go.”

“OK, OK, I’ll tell you what I know.” Marquis Zizhong was as obsequious as a dog.

He was clear that his life was in Jian Wushuang’s hands.

“You’ve followed Su Ming. Do you know where he is?” Jian Wushuang asked.

The intelligence documents he received did not mention where Su Ming had gone after he became the Demon Ancestor.

“Master Su Ming left for other plane worlds. As for his destination, I don’t know that either,” Marquis Zizhong replied.

“Left?” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

The reason why he returned to the Divine Land was to take revenge.

There was no doubt that Su Ming was the enemy he hated the most.

He did not expect that Su Ming had left the Divine Land.

”?I’ve got a problem.?” Jian Wushuang was deep in thought.?“There are countless plane worlds in the Ancient World. Who knows where he is? I’m afraid that I will have to spend more time and energy to find him if I want to have my revenge.”

He shook his head, saying, “You just mentioned the Holy Ancestor Feast. What is that?”

“The Holy Ancestor Feast is an ordinary party the Holy Ancestor hosts,” Marquis Zizhong answered, “It’s being held to celebrate the Holy Ancestor’s 2,000th birthday. Many experts from the Divine Land will attend it and it’s said that even a few supreme experts from the outside worlds will come.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was intrigued. “It that case, I won’t have to look for those supreme experts one by one. This will save me some time.”

Jian Wushuang looked over at Marquis Zizhong while asking, “Can I go to the Holy Ancestor Feast?”

“Yes, of course.” Marquis Zizhong shook his head. “Sir, I’ll arrange it for you if you’d like to go there.”

“OK, if you do that for me, then we will have a clean slate. However, if you try to play some tricks, you’ll die without a doubt. You know that no one in the entire Divine Land is able to prevent me from killing you,” Jian Wushuang warned.

“I won’t dare to.” Marquis Zizhong, who had already been terrified by the young man’s strength, immediately left to deal with it.

“Lan’er.” Jian Wushuang addressed Lin Lan.

“Master.” Lin Lan responded excitedly while her husband stood respectfully beside her.

“I need you to prepare something...” Jian Wushuang whispered in her ear.

After she was clear about her task, Lin Lan was stupefied.

“Go ahead!” Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

Lin Lan took a deep breath and then left to carry out the order.

Jian Wushuang stood alone with his hands behind his back as he looked up at the sky, a blade-like smile growing on his face.

“2,000th birthday?”

“Hum, he has lived so long. I guess it’s about time for him to die!”

The Holy Ancestor Feast would begin in three days, so Jian Wushuang had remained in the Lin Lan’s mansion during this period of time.

Marquis Guyang had treated Jian Wushuang with respect ever since he discovered the real strength of the young man.

During those days, Jian Wushuang had been trying his best to improve himself. aside from he occasionally giving some guidance to his disciple.

He had just made a breakthrough, so there was plenty of room for improvement. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

He had reached Level 10 of the Bone Fusion Technique before the breakthrough.

Now, as he had made it to the Nine-cloud Realm, it was possible for him to reach Level 11 and12 with his superb body.

It went smoothly. He had mastered the last two levels within three days.

No one had reached Level 12 in the history of the Monster Continent, but Jian Wushuang easily succeeded.

“What a pity! My body has reached its limit. Although I’ve master Level 11 and 12, it only helped me enhance body’s strength, so my body hasn’t become any stronger.”
