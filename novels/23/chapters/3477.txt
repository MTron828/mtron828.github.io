Chapter 3481 Tricky

After Xiao’er regained control of the Nine-tailed Clan, Jian Wushuang stayed in the clan.

During this period, Marquis Duan Yu, Axe One Master, Star Saint Master, Master Xu, and Master Shadow Fox, the Master of the rules of the six void realms, had been practicing the five-killing formation of the nether jade, since the formation was prepared to deal with Da Ying, and it was difficult to guarantee that there were still loyal Da Ying members in the Nine-tailed Clan, the place where they practiced the formation was completely isolated, except for a few people, no one could enter.

Naturally, no one knew what they were doing inside.

During this time, Jian Wushuang was very relaxed. Occasionally, he would drink tea and chat with Demon Master Chenhuo.

“It’s been half a year. If I’m not mistaken, Marquis Duan Yu and the others should have practiced their magic formation by now,” Jian Wushuang said.

“I’ve personally seen the magic formation they practiced. The power of the magic formation is indeed amazing. After the five of them joined hands to cast the magic formation, even if I was trapped inside, it would be difficult for me to break it. However, at that time, they were not very familiar with the magic formation. Now, they should be able to break it,” Demon Master Chenhuo said.

The level of the Netherjade Five Kill formation was extremely high. Originally, it would be extremely difficult for even a sixth level void martial artist to master it, and the time required would be very long.

But fortunately, there was Marquis Duan Yu, who had extremely high attainments in the formation, and he was also one of the five people who controlled the formation. Thus, although this formation was used by five people at the same time, the main person who controlled it was Marquis Duan Yu, therefore, in about half a year, they should be able to master the magic formation.

“Once the magic formation is completed, Xiao’er will find an opportunity to kill Da Ying, but…” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. “Chenhuo, if Da Ying is really trapped in the Netherjade Five Kill magic formation and you kill her yourself, are you sure you can kill her?”

Although Jian Wushuang was very confident in the strength of Demon Master Chenhuo, Da Ying was, after all, an expert at the peak of the sixth realm of the void.

“I can’t say for sure.” Demon Master Chenhuo shook his head. “However, after I take this step, my strength is much stronger than before. It’s definitely not difficult for me to crush Da Ying. As for killing her, it’s very likely that she can’t escape.”

“How confident are you?” Jian Wushuang looked at Demon Master Chenhuo.

“50%. After all, this Da Ying will definitely go crazy and do whatever it takes. She has been the clan leader of the Nine-tailed Clan for so many years, so she must have many trump cards. The Soul Devouring Pearl she used on the battlefield may only be one of them.”

“If I really push her to the limit, I don’t know whether I can kill her or not. Or I can’t guarantee that I will be able to withstand her desperate use of her trump card,” said Demon Master Chenhuo.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.

Indeed, to kill an expert at the peak of the six void realms, not only did she have to be unable to escape, but she also had to be careful of her counterattack.

Anyone would be desperate before they died, let alone this Da Ying.

And a Da Ying at the peak of the six void realms, who was also the clan leader of the Nine-tailed Clan, would be quite terrifying if she was desperate.

Under such circumstances, it was not easy to continue to kill her. Even if she was killed in the end, there was no guarantee that they would not pay a price.

At this moment…Xiao’er flew over from the distance and appeared directly in front of Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chenhuo.

“Jian Wushuang, Demon Master Chenhuo,” Xiao’er said with a solemn expression.

“Miss Xiao’er, judging from your solemn expression, have you found the whereabouts of Da Ying?” Jian Wushuang asked.

During the past six months, Xiao’er had ordered the intelligence agencies of Divine Moon Palace and the Nine-tailed Clan to do their best to find the existence of Da Ying. As Xiao’er had expected, Da Ying did not keep a low profile, she was often found.

However, since three months ago, Da Ying seemed to have suddenly disappeared. The intelligence agencies of Divine Moon Palace and the Nine-tailed Clan could not find her again.

“Yes, I found her, but it’s because of this that I’m in a tricky situation,” Xiao’er said.

“Tricky?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. “Da Ying has already been driven out of the Nine-tailed Clan. is she going to cause any trouble?”

“If it was just her alone, it wouldn’t be a big deal. We could have set off to kill her at any time after Marquis Duan Yu had completely mastered the five killing formation of the dark jade. However, we didn’t expect her to go to the Blood Clan during the three months when she disappeared!” said Xiao-er in a low voice.

“Blood Clan?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and stood up immediately. “Why did she go to the Blood Clan?”

“If I’m not mistaken, she wants to join hands with the Blood Clan to fight against the Nine-tailed Clan,” Xiao’er said.

“So, the Blood Clan agreed?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

In her opinion, the Blood Clan and the Nine-tailed Clan were one of the four great divine clans. They should not really fight against the Nine-tailed Clan for the sake of a Da Ying. After all, the Nine-tailed Clan and Divine Moon Palace had now joined hands, their overall strength had long surpassed that of before.

Now, in the Demon Realm, all the clans believed that the Nine-tailed Clan was the strongest among the four great divine clans.

At this juncture, the Blood Clan should not be so blind as to provoke the Nine-tailed Clan.

“Jian Wushuang, you don’t know that the four great divine clans in the demon realm are not as calm as they appear on the surface, especially the Nine-tailed Clan and the Blood Clan,” Xiao’er said in a deep voice.

“The Blood Clan and the Nine-tailed Clan have been fighting for a long time because of the proximity of their territories. Sometimes, the Nine-tailed Clan is superior to the Blood Clan, and sometimes, the Blood Clan is superior to the Nine-tailed Clan. In short, the two divine races have been fighting for an unknown number of years and have accumulated a huge amount of hatred toward each other. No matter who we are, as long as there is an opportunity, we will definitely attack each other without hesitation!”

“And this time, because of me, the Nine-tailed Clan and the Divine Moon Palace have joined hands, and their strength has increased to an unprecedented level. This naturally made the Blood Clan wary and even fearful. As for Da Ying, she also knows that it is already very difficult for her to regain control of the Nine-tailed Clan by herself, so she naturally has to find helpers!”

“The first person she thought of should be the dark clan. However, although the Dark clan is on good terms with the Nine-tailed Clan and owes the Nine-tailed Clan a favor, this favor is owed to the Nine-tailed Clan, not her, Da Ying. Therefore, when the Dark clan knows that the war between the Divine Moon Palace and the Nine-tailed Clan is merely an internal conflict between the Nine-tailed Clan, the Dark clan will not pay any attention to it!”

“At this time, even if Da Ying finds the Dark Clan, she won’t get any help from the dark clan, so she can only go to the Blood Clan!”
