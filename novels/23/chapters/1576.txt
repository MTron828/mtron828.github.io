Chapter 1577: Narrowing Down The Search Area

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Right after Jian Wushuang had cleared the Inverse Cultivation Test for the Third Heaven and became a Universe God of the Third Heaven, he went to the Burning Demon Region immediately.

During his journey, he did not seclude himself in mediation or do any training.

However, it must be known that for his abilities, most of them would become a lot more powerful as soon as he achieved the Universe God of the Third Heaven.

For example, his Sword Principles…

His Sword Principles had reached the maximum level for a Universe God of the Second Heaven a long time ago. Moreover, he already possessed higher levels of understanding of Sword Principles and comprehension. In particular, the accumulated understanding of Sword Principles from solving the one thousand moves of the Scattered Stars Game in Wu Bei’s cave had allowed him to possess the ability to create stronger Unique Skills. However, he was still unable to create them.

At the very moment, his realm finally made a breakthrough to the next level. As such, his Sword Principles would naturally skyrocket and he would be able to create Unique Skills that were many levels stronger than before.

However, the problem was that he had not studied his Sword Principles or tried to create new Unique Skills yet.

It wasn’t until that very moment when he was inside the seal. For the next period of time before the experts found them, he could let his mind settle down and enhance his own Sword Principles.

“Let’s begin.”

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes and started his first training after clearing the Inverse Cultivation Test of the Third Heaven.

Time passed slowly.

In the blink of an eye, fifteen years had passed by.

During the fifteen years, within the Burning Demon Region, the experts of the Four Symbol Mansion and the experts who came for the reward of one thousand million Chaos Gems still had not given up on the search for Duan Lingfeng.

Moreover, after searching for the past few years, the search area had become smaller and smaller.

Up till the very day.

Swoosh!

A middle-aged man wearing green armor flew past the volcanos.

The middle-aged man was a Void Real God of the Four Symbol Mansion. At that very moment, he was moving and chatting with another Void Real God via the transmission token at the same time.

“That Duan Lingfeng really knows how to hide. Although the Four Symbol Mansion has so many experts and we have also searched the Burning Demon Region for tens of years, we are still unable to find him,” the middle-aged man curled his lips and said.

“Haha. There is no rush. Since we can confirm that Duan Lingfeng is still hiding within the Burning Demon Region, we will find him eventually. As soon as we find him, he will definitely be killed. Now, he is merely waiting for death,” laughter could be heard from the other party using the transmission token.

“That’s true.”

The middle-aged man nodded his head. However, at that very moment, his expression changed abruptly and he stopped moving.

“Eh?” the middle-aged man turned around and looked at the volcano that he had just passed through.

The volcano looked normal. If one were to look at it with his naked eyes, he would not be able to see anything unusual. However, since the middle-aged man flew past the skies of the volcano, he felt a special sensation.

The middle-aged man then headed toward the mountain slowly. When he reached the sky above the mountain, he started to investigate thoroughly.

After some time, he got his answer.

“There’s actually another seal hidden here?” the middle-aged man raised his eyebrows and sent a message to the party on the other side of the token: “I have discovered a hidden seal and I will go in and take a look first. We shall continue our conversation later.”

“Alright, please be careful. If you come across Duan Lingfeng, do not confront him. Instead, escape straight away and send a message to us,” the party on the other side of the token warned.

“Don’t worry, although Duan Lingfeng is strong, it will not be that easy to kill me.”

The middle-aged man giggled and he quickly charged into the seal that covered the volcano.

His abilities were not weak. Although he had not achieved the peak of a Void Real God, he was already very close to it. Moreover, even though the seal covering the volcano was considered powerful, it would still be very difficult to stop him. After just a short amount of time, he had bypassed many obstacles and was only left with the last obstacle.

After getting past the last obstacle, he would be able to observe the real view of the volcano clearly.

“Haha, break!” the middle-aged man swung the big hammer on his hands and was about to smash the final obstacle.

However, all of a sudden… an invisible strength headed toward him.

The middle-aged man’s body shook and his consciousness turned sleepy immediately. After that, an icy-cold sword light lit up and swept past the middle-aged man’s neck.

It was only when his life was about to come to an end that his consciousness woke up. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“I, I…”

As the middle-aged man murmured, his eyes were filled with fright. However, at the final moment, his consciousness still managed to send out a message.

“Duan Lingfeng is at…”

The middle-aged man was only able to send a four-word message out. After that, the light in his eyes faded away completely.

At the volcano covered by the seal, Jian Wushuang was still sitting down with his legs crossed and he was putting the Blood Mountain Sword in his hands back into the scabbard. After that, he raised his head and looked in the direction of the middle-aged man.

Due to the seal’s interference, Jian Wushuang could see what was happening in the outside world. However, the middle-aged man was unable to see him.

Jian Wushuang’s expression turned grave.

“Someone has found this place. Although he was killed by me straight away, there is no guarantee that he didn’t send a message out before he died. In other words, the location that Duan Lingfeng and I are in will most likely be exposed. Hence, the experts of the Four Symbol Mansion would hurry over in no time,” Jian Wushuang frowned and glanced at the cave behind him immediately.

For the past fifteen years, Duan Lingfeng had secluded himself in meditation all the while. Jian Wushuang had also stood guard outside the cave so that Duan Lingfeng would not be disturbed in the slightest.

However, it was not easy to make a breakthrough to Real God. Up till the very moment, Duan Lingfeng was still in the midst of making a breakthrough.

“I hope that he is able to make it in time. If not…” Jian Wushuang’s eyes glowed with coldness and he closed his eyes again immediately.

At the same time, when the middle-aged man was killed by Jian Wushuang, at a corner that was within the Burning Demon Region, a black-haired, bold old man’s body stopped moving abruptly.

There was a token on his hands and the four words of the middle-aged man were sent over.

“Duan Lingfeng is at…”

However, the message stopped there. The black-haired old man also sent a message with the intention to question him immediately. However, there was no reply at all.

“He’s dead. Real God Qing Ling is already dead!”

“He has definitely found the hiding spot of Duan Lingfeng. Thus, he was killed by Duan Lingfeng straight away.”

The black-haired old man thought that it was Duan Lingfeng who had killed Real God Qing Ling.

He then sent a message to the Real God experts of the Four Symbol Mansion at once to inform them of this matter.

Apart from being furious, the experts of the Four Symbol Mansion locked on to a particular area within the Burning Demon Region.

“Real God Qing Ling has been communicating with me all the while. I have also asked for his location and he said that he had just passed by the Earth Fire Demon Lair (a special area within the Burning Demon Region). After that, he continued to talk to me for a short while. Thus, in such a small amount of time, he will definitely still be somewhere close to the Earth Fire Demon Lair and that was where he died.

“As long as we conduct a search thoroughly within the range of a thousand million miles of the Earth Fire Demon Lair, we will definitely be able to find Duan Lingfeng!” the black-haired, bold old man was very sure.

Thus, the Four Symbol Mansion narrowed down the range of their search area at once.

Initially, it would be very difficult for the Four Symbol Mansion to find Duan Lingfeng as there were countless seals within the vast Burning Demon Region.

However, at that very moment, the search area had been narrowed down to only one thousand million miles. Thus, it would be much easier for them to find Duan Lingfeng.
