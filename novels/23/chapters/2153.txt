Chapter 2154 That Move

Even Lord Fen was surprised by how amazing this move by Emperor Bai was.Emperor Bai fully made use of the value of the Void Token.

Jian Wushuang also played a big part. He was probably the only person from the Eternal Chaotic World who could sneak into the Imperial Palace easily.

“This time, the Three Emperors World has suffered great losses. Our lineup is probably weaker than that of the Eternal Chaotic World,” Kaiser Blood muttered.

Hearing this, Lord Fen and Demon King Chen Yu fell silent.

Before the fight started, the Three Emperors World always have an advantage.

Even without the Dark Millstone, their advantage was still far bigger.

They not only had an advantage in the general power level, they had spies from the?Acheron Palace within the Special Tribes and the human territory. The chance of victory was about eighty percent.

After a series of battles, they had lost their edge and were now at an disadvantage.

They even had to give up territory within the Three Emperors World.

“After all these years of elaborate planning, we are going to fail just like this?” Demon King Chen Yu said, unwilling to accept the fact.

“Defeat? How can that be? Even though it is disadvantageous for us now, we still have a chance to turn the tide of battle, but we have to use that move.” Kaiser Blood smiled.

“That move?” Lord Fen, Demon King Chen Yu and Leng Ruxue looked over to Kaiser Blood.

They fell silent.

They clearly understood what Kaiser Blood had meant when he’d said that move.

It was exactly because they knew clearly what he meant, they were solemn. They dared not use it carelessly.

The cost of that move was so huge that it was not easy for even Lord Fen and Demon King Chen Yu to accept.

“I too do not want to use that move. However, given the situation at hand, the Three Emperors Word will stand no chance against the Eternal Chaotic World if we do not use it. Our defeat is just a matter of time. If that were the case, our effort all these years would be put to waste,” Kaiser Blood muttered.

“Wouldn’t that move be a little too cruel?” Demon King Chen Yu said as he knitted his eyebrows tightly.

Demon King Chen Yu was a leader of the Acheron Palace. He had come from the Ancient Past, and hence his heart had been hardened over and over again.

Even though he was decisive, he did not care when he knew that the Dark Millstone would destroy all life in the Eternal Chaotic World.

When Kaiser Blood mentioned that move, even he felt it was too cruel and evil.

We can only imagine how terrifying the move was.

“I fully agree with Kaiser Blood. Critical moments like this require a different way of doing things. Chen Yu, you have lived for so long, you should know clearly you will need to give some things when the time comes. Why are you so hesitant?”?Lord Fen said emotionlessly.

Demon King Chen Yu squinted his eyes as he nodded his head. “If that is the case, let us use that move. Everything is for our final objective.”

“Yes, everything for our final objective.” Kaiser Blood smiled coldly..

Kaiser Blood, Lord Fen and Demon King Chen Yu made up their minds.

As for Leng Ruxue, she simply sat there quietly at the side. She did not speak at all. However, you could see there was a glint of a different emotion in her beautiful eyes.

“Kaiser Blood, when will we use that move?” Demon King Chen Yu asked.

“Let us not hurry. I still need to make some preparations. Let us endure for a period of time.” Kaiser Blood smiled.

Hearing this, Demon King Chen Yu stopped asking questions.

…

Within the Three Emperors World, the army from Eternal Chaotic World swept the different territories.

Many of the top-tier experts, such as Sir Gods, Emperor Gods and the rare few great emperors had received the message from the higher-ups from the Three Emperors World and ran to hide at the new assembly point.

Even so, many of the experts who had not received the message in time died.

As the army swept across the territory, these remaining experts were exterminated.

Not just the almighty, but many of the Chaotic Real Gods had died when they were discovered by the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World.

Time flew. In the blink of an eye, three months had passed.

The army from Eternal Chaotic World swept the territories within the Three Emperors World for three months.

Within the three months, all of the territories were swept many times.

After the sweep, most of the experts had already died. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Emperor Bai then ordered the sweep to stop.

The Imperial Palace was originally the home base of the Three Emperors World.

Now it was under the control of the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World.

Jian Wushuang and many of the great emperors gathered in the grand palace.

“We have swept most of the territories within the Three Emperors World. The experts were all exterminated. All we are left with are the experts who escaped and the location of their assembly point,” Emperor Bai said.

The great emperors present were clueless.

In three months, these great emperors had followed the army to sweep the territories.

They had originally thought the experts from the Three Emperors World would put up a fight. In reality, the three months had gone smoothly.

No one had tried to fight?back, and the remaining experts had been killed.

The top-tier experts had abandoned their territory in this world and the cultivators were living inside.

“After the battle three months ago, the Three Emperors World suffered great losses. They know they could no longer go head to head with us. They must be hiding somewhere, waiting for a chance to strike back,” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

“I think so too. They might be preparing for some special means to turn the tide of this battle. The reason they are not attacking us right now is because they have yet to finish their preparations.”

Jian Wushuang agreed.

From what Kaiser Blood had said before they’d escaped, the Three Emperors World would not give up so easily and would strike back.

Like Emperor Bai had said, the Three Emperors World could really be preparing for some means to turn the tide of the battle.

“Hence, we cannot give them time to prepare. We need to find them and kill them all!” Jian Wushuang said coldly.
