Chapter 3637: Had Been Used

“The news from Star Palace is correct. I did get a piece of ice-heart glazed jade, but I used it a long time ago,” said Saint Star Master.

“Used it?” Jian Wushuang was stunned, but then his eyes turned cold. “Although this ice-heart glazed jade is an extremely rare treasure, its use is very limited. What can you do with it?”

“Well...if I tell you, Blood Sword Master, are you willing to leave?” Saint Star Master asked carefully.

“Are you bargaining with me?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold, and he tightened his grip on the Netherworld Divine Sword. The already terrifying killing intent in his body suddenly increased a little at this moment.

Saint Star Master was terrified. He gritted his teeth and said, “Blood Sword Master, I have indeed used the iceheart glazed jade. If you don’t believe me, just wait here for a while. I will naturally find a way to prove it.”

“Wait for a while?” Jian Wushuang pondered for a moment. “How long will it take?”

“It won’t take long. Just a few days,” Earth Saint Star Master said.

“A few days?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold. “Earth Saint Star Master, are you trying to play some tricks?”

“Blood Sword Master, my life is in your hands now. How can I dare to play any tricks? Besides, I have already sworn to the universe origin principles. Blood Sword Master, are you still unwilling to believe me?” Earth Saint Star Master said.

“Well, I’ll wait here for a few days.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

In fact, he could choose to kill Earth Saint Star Master directly and then investigate his interspatial ring.

However, there was a certain risk in doing so.

First of all, Earth Saint Star Master had been famous in this territory for a long time, and he had killed crazily and offended many experts. However, he was still alive and well, it was difficult to guarantee that he would not have any trump cards in his hands.

Although he could now pose a fatal threat to the Earth Saint Star Master, he was not completely confident that he could really kill the Earth Saint Star Master. Moreover, if he did not kill the Earth Saint Star Master, with his character, he would take revenge crazily afterwards, it would be enough to give the Star Palace a headache.

Secondly, he was also worried about what the Earth Saint Star Master had said. If the ice heart glazed jade was not in his hands but given to someone else or used in another place, he would at least have to know the exact whereabouts of it, once he killed the Saint Star Master and did not find the glazed ice jade in his interspatial ring, it would be too difficult for him to find out more information about it.

Therefore, he could only wait and find out what was going on before deciding whether to attack the Saint Star Master.

Moreover, he was not afraid of what the Saint Star Master would do in just a few days. After all, everyone knew the Saint Star Master’s character. Even if he wanted to call for help, no one would help him in this territory.

Naturally, Jian Wushuang did not have to worry about anything.

Soon, ten days passed.

“Earth Saint Star Master, it’s been ten days.” Jian Wushuang glanced at Earth Saint Star Master.

“Don’t worry, we’ll be there soon,” Earth Saint Star Master said.

Jian Wushuang frowned.

At this moment, a white-robed figure suddenly appeared in the void where Temporal Temple Master was outside the Earth Saint Star.

“Hello, Temporal Temple Master.”

The voice sounded and the person stared at Temporal Temple Master. A Ruler Realm aura suddenly rose.

“Huh?” Temporal Temple Master’s expression suddenly changed.

…

In the Saint Star, Jian Wushuang was still waiting, but Temporal Temple Master suddenly smiled and said, “Blood Sword Master, the person who can prove it has come.”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly. At this time, the Temporal Temple Master sent a message directly, “My young friend, a Ruler has arrived.”

“Who is it?” Jian Wushuang asked. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“It’s Ruler Wuqing,” the Temporal Temple Master said.

“It’s him?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

Jian Wushuang had also heard of Ruler Wuqing. He was a Ruler who had just risen not long ago. Before his rise, he was not famous at all. Even if he became a Ruler and roamed the three battlefields…after he became famous, no one knew his background. No one knew which astral world he came from, which forces he came from, or which friends he had.

Many cultivators in this territory had a simple understanding of the Ruler of bluish-green. They only knew his name and strength.

The Ruler of bluish-green was not very strong among the primary Rulers, but he had many means. He was also an extremely difficult Ruler. In the years since he rose to power, he had roamed the three battlefields.

But now, he was here?

“Earth Saint Star Master, did you invite him here?” Jian Wushuang glanced at him.

“Yes.” Earth Saint Star Master nodded slightly. “But I didn’t invite him here to help me escape. I asked him to prove that I don’t have the ice heart glazed jade anymore.”

“How do you prove it?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s simple. Blood Sword Master and Xuan God, you two, feel my soul origin aura carefully.” As Saint Star Master spoke, the purest soul aura immediately rose from his body, it rose directly from Saint Star Master’s body.

Soul origin...if a cultivator’s core was his soul, then this soul origin was the core of the core.

The soul origin represented a person’s own dominant consciousness. A cultivator was doomed from the moment he was born, and there was no way to change it. Regardless of whether the cultivator became stronger in the future, even if he became a Ruler…his soul origin would not change.

Under normal circumstances, a cultivator would never show such a core soul origin. But now, the Earth Saint Star Master had revealed his soul origin aura, Jian Wushuang and Daoist Xuan God were puzzled.

“Now, release your soul power and feel the soul origin aura of the Ruler of bluish-green outside the Earth Saint Star,” the Earth Saint Star Master said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang and Daoist Xuan God looked at each other. Although they were puzzled, they still released their soul aura according to the Earth Saint Star Master’s instructions, sure enough, outside the Earth Saint Star, they sensed the soul origin aura of the Ruler.

Jian Wushuang and Daoist Xuan God were shocked.

“It’s the same!”

“Two soul origin auras are exactly the same!”

“How is this possible?”

Jian Wushuang and Daoist Xuan God were shocked.

“Nothing is impossible. The Ruler is my clone, so his soul origin aura is exactly the same as mine,” Earth Saint Star Master said with a smile.

“Doppelganger?” Jian Wushuang and Daoist Xuan God were stunned.

Doppelganger?

The Ruler who had made a name for himself in this territory was the doppelganger of Earth Saint Star Master?
