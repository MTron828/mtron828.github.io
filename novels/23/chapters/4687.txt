4688 Slaying Yan Immortal (2)

It could shake the heavens and earth, but it was also like tearing cloth and silk, silent and unmoving.

100,000 swords pierced the chest of the black figure without missing a single one.

The unimaginable power directly blasted his entire figure into fine powder.

Chun Qiu was so shocked that he subconsciously took half a step back.

Jian Wushuang did not let his guard down at all and he looked at the center of the explosion vigilantly.

Then, the black figure that had been blown into pieces slowly condensed, and an unprecedented aura surged.

The entire black mountain’s hinterlands and abyss started to boil!

The pitch-black figure condensed, and a pair of green bean-like eyes flickered with rage.

He suddenly waved his hand, and hundreds of vines condensed by Yan Li swept over.

“Jian Wushuang, dodge!” Chun Qiu shouted in shock.

As soon as he finished speaking, hundreds of vines formed a cage and trapped the two of them.

At the same time, the vines began to quickly secrete mucus, ready to digest them.

With a flip of his hand, a dagger appeared in Chun Qiu’s palm. He then stabbed the vine below him.

However, the vine did not move at all. Instead, because he used too much force, the dagger cut a bone-deep wound in his palm.

Chun Qiu gasped and looked at Jian Wushuang nervously.

Due to the excessive casting of spells, the power of the chain iron plate on his neck almost crushed Jian Wushuang’s divine soul.

The Yan power in his body was being devoured by the chain metal token at an extremely fast speed.

Jian Wushuang wiped the divine blood from the corner of his mouth, his eyes still indifferent.

Then, the Invisible Sword in his hand trembled, and the trickling stream of Yan power turned into more than ten slashes, cutting toward the vines.

Swish…

As if a hot knife had been cut into butter, a faint stench rose up, and the vines under his feet were directly cut open.

Then, Jian Wushuang picked up Chun Qiu and escaped from the cage. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Arghh!” A furious roar resounded as the pitch-black figure glared at the two.

“Lowly prisoners, who gave you the courage to resist me? Now, obediently come over and let me cut you up alive. It’s better than refining you into vengeful souls later.”

Chun Qiu immediately spat and said disdainfully, “You? If you let us out now, I can spare your life.”

At that moment, Jian Wushuang suddenly put his hand on Chun Qiu’s shoulder and his body swayed.

Chun Qiu’s expression changed and he pulled Jian Wushuang back without thinking.

The pitch-black figure laughed gloomily. With a flip of his sleeve, a small black flag rose up in the wind. At the same time, countless souls of prisoners that had been devoured rushed out.

Every time the flag that looked like a soul beckoning banner was waved, a blood mist that was as deep as the abyss would surge out.

Jian Wushuang, who was like a god just a moment ago, was now weak. This shocked Chun Qiu, who had spoken arrogantly. He dragged him back and released Yan power to try to block it.

However, the Yan power that belonged to the Yan Immortal realm was simply too terrifying. It seemed to have devoured Chun Qiu’s attack in an instant.

Chun Qiu’s face was ashen. He was about to die here. Jian Wushuang, who was barely breathing, said, “What a clown.”

In the next moment, an indescribable and extremely pure Yan power rose up.

Jian Wushuang changed his previous fatigue and stood still in the void, looking at the dead souls that were as deep as hell without fear.

Then, he reached out his palm and clenched it!

The most brilliant light of Extreme Darkness Heavenly Gate appeared. It was like countless blazing suns shining, illuminating the entire abyss.

Under this extreme daylight, the dark dead soul that was living in the black light started to wail.

Countless divine weapons and divine shadows intertwined and formed a huge palm that covered the sky and pressed down heavily.

The stone walls of the black mountain could not withstand the power and began to crack.

An apocalyptic scene appeared. The mountain collapsed, and even the man-made plank road collapsed together. It was as if the mountains and rivers had fallen and shattered.

When the black figure holding the flag saw this, his small eyes rolled. He knew that he had encountered a tough opponent and immediately flashed, ready to escape.

However, wherever the extreme daylight shone, there seemed to be an invisible barrier that blocked all the aura.

The dark figure was shocked. This was a matter of life and death and he dared not hold back. He stretched out his arms and the surging derivation power turned into a vast black light and attacked Jian Wushuang.

However, Jian Wushuang only raised his hand, and the dark light was completely destroyed by his Heavenly Gate.

The energy of light and darkness surged, and the pitch-black figure could no longer remain calm. He crazily activated his unparalleled super ability and smashed it toward the monster-like fellow.

However, the various great super powers disintegrated on their own before they could touch Jian Wushuang.

Only Chun Qiu, who was watching from afar, could see clearly that all the attacks from the black figure were neutralized by the brilliance emitted by Jian Wushuang. He did not even need to use his hands!

This was too terrifying. Even an Emperor would find it difficult to keep this fellow!

The sky-covering palm formed a world of its own and finally pressed down on the pitch-black figure.

A miserable howl resounded, and endless black light scattered.

Jian Wushuang looked at the scene calmly from the beginning to the end.

When the extreme daylight and the black light dissipated together, he reached out his hand and clenched it in the air. As if he had expected what was about to happen, he grabbed a mass of dense black light.

“L-let me go!” The dense black light struggled violently in Jian Wushuang’s hand and soon condensed into an almost invisible figure.

The black figure, who was already scared out of his wits, had his Yan power destroyed, leaving behind a trace of his aura.

“Let me go, and all my treasures will be yours,” The dark figure wailed. At the same time, he took out a treasure that contained great power from his arms and presented it to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang glanced at the treasure bottle gourd, the octagonal talisman, the black copper mask, and so on. He knew that these true treasures were only slightly weaker than the Supreme Ancestral Weapons in the Divine Power Universe!

However, there were only seven Supreme Ancestral Weapons, yet this fellow had taken out more than ten Supreme treasures that were not much different from them.

Even with Jian Wushuang’s composure, he was already wavering a little.

“As long as you let me go, all of this will be yours,” the pitch-black figure said in a trembling voice.

However, Jian Wushuang just looked at him coldly. He exerted force in his palm and the black life source shattered in an instant.

The black figure did not even have the time to open his mouth and beg for mercy before he completely disappeared.

A Yan Immortal who had surpassed the Ancestor realm had been killed by Jian Wushuang.

This was also the first Yan Immortal to die in his hands.

As the pitch-black figure disappeared, the entire black mountain no longer had any mountain spirits. In the end, it completely collapsed, and countless rocks fell down.

“Let’s go!” Chun Qiu, who had just recovered from the shock, waved his hand and summoned up a space to block the falling rocks. “Let’s go! The entire mountain is about to collapse!”
