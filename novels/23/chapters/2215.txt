Chapter 2216 Abnormality

Just like Abysmal Palace...Jian Wu Shuang and Abysmal Saint Master settled their grudges and became good friends. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Lineage of Stars and Abysmal Palace would not have anymore disputes as both parties were already on good terms.

Like Soaring Heaven King Palace...

Soaring Heaven King Palace had offended Jian Wushuang the most back then. However, with Jian Wushuang’s current power level, he did not care about Soaring Heaven King Palace. Furthermore, the leader of the Soaring Heaven King Palace, Great Emperor Tian Ling, had fought together with Jian Wushuang during the battle at the Three Emperors World. Great Emperor Tian Ling had given his all during the battle, hence the hatred between Jian Wushuang and the Soaring Heaven King Palace was not as strong anymore.

After the battle, Great Emperor Tian Ling had apologized to Jian Wushuang personally. Even though on a personal level, their grudge was settled, their respective clans still hated each other.

The Lineage of Stars now was extremely powerful. Even though they had not eliminated their enemies, it was normal for the Lineage of Stars to make lives for their enemies difficult. Jian Wushuang knew about this.

Of course, Lineage of Stars would not cross certain boundaries and they knew their limits.

“Why? Are our enemies still trying something funny?” Jian Wushuang looked at Hall Master Yuan and asked.

“These enemies knew their place and did not try anything funny at all. When they saw people from the Lineage of Stars, they would hide and would not offend us at all. However, the Real Martial Arts Divine Church started behaving abnormally recently,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Real Martial Arts Divine Church?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Real Martial Arts Divine Church was one of five members of the Star Extermination Alliance.

However, after the battle back at the old location of Lineage of Stars, Real Martial Arts Divine Church had suffered heavy losses. Their leader was killed and their fighting power plummeted. On top of that, Lineage of Stars had continued to suppress them. This church was at the brink of annihilation.

Lineage of Stars had stopped suppressing them after the ancient battlefield had appeared around the Green Fire World. Then, the great war broke out and most of the other clans had been preoccupied fighting the war. They did not have excess manpower or strength to take note of the insignificant church. This had allowed them to barely survive till this day.

“If I am not wrong, the Real Martial Arts Divine Church did not participate in the battle against Three Emperors World. Am I right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes. When the battle broke out, experts from most clans within the Eternal Chaotic World joined the war. Some clans sent every single member they had, while there were some that did not participate at all. The clans that did not join used the reason that they were too weak not to reject the call of duty. The Real Martial Arts Divine Church was one of such clans,” Hall Master Yuan nodded his head and said.

“Of course,the Real Martial Arts Divine Church was at the brink of collapse and did not want to send any almighties to the frontline. The Sanctuary Alliance sympathised with them and did not force them to participate.”

“After the great war, the power of the other clans were greatly weakened, but not the Real Martial Arts Divine Church. They managed to survive their predicament and became one of the more powerful clans.”

“So the abnormality that you were talking about just now is that the Real Martial Arts Divine Church started to treat us like enemies again, right?” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“That is right. The Real Martial Arts Divine Church originally kept a low profile, even during the twenty four thousand years that you were in slumber. However, their attitudes changed in the last one thousand years. They were no longer afraid and acted high and mighty, then they dealt with us.”

“Under normal circumstances, the Lineage of Stars would not cause trouble for the Real Martial Arts Divine Church. However, during this period of time, the Real Martial Arts Divine Church started to cause trouble for us. They even started to fight us head on. It was like they were emboldened by something and no longer feared us.”

“Is that the case?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

From what Hall Master Yuan had said, Jian Wushuang had noticed that the Real Martial Arts Divine Church was acting abnormally.

Because of Jian Wushuang, the Lineage of Stars had the best resources and was one of the most dominant forces in the Eternal Chaotic World. Which clan dared to make Lineage of Stars their enemies? Even if they suffered losses due to the Lineage of Stars, they would not take it to heart or tolerate these losses quietly.

This was especially the case for the enemies of Lineage of Stars as they were extremely careful not to anger their enemy.

The Real Martial Arts Divine Church did not keep a low profile, but provoked the Lineage of Stars actively?

It might have been alright if they had provoked them while Jian Wushuang was in slumber. The reason could have been because they thought Jian Wushuang would not awaken, which would cause Lineage of Stars to lose their greatest asset.

However, they had been extremely respectful while Jian Wushuang was in slumber and became more aggressive when Jian Wushuang awakened, to the point they dared to fight LIneage of Stars head on.

“Hall Master Yuan is right. Where does the Real Martial Arts Divine Church get their courage from?” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

Within the Eternal Chaotic World, who dared to go against Jian Wushuang besides Emperor Bai?

Even the great emperors did not have the courage to do so.

“Hall Master Yuan, have you sent experts to investigate this matter?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes. After the most recent fight we had, I sent Emperor God Ling Qu to investigate the matter.”

Lineage of Stars had many almighties and emperor gods.

Emperor God Ling Qu was one of them.

“The leader of the Real Martial Arts Divine Church died and was a lot weaker compared to before. The number of almighties they have is limited and they only had one ordinary emperor god. However, after Emperor God Ling Qu reached the territory that the Real Martial Arts Divine Church controlled, we lost contact. If I am not wrong, Emperor God Ling Qu has already died,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Oh? Before he died, did he send any message back?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Nope. I only knew that he entered the territory controlled by the Real Martial Arts Divine Church. Before he could send me any more messages, he died,” Hall Master Yuan said as he shook his head.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and thought seriously.

Emperor Gods were one of the most powerful kinds of people within the Eternal Chaotic World.

It was not difficult to kill an emperor god as many peak emperor gods could do that. But it was not easy to kill one without giving him a chance to transmit a message.
