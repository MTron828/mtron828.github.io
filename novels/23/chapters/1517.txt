Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Jian Wushuang, you can’t escape!”

“Die!”

Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu had soaring murderous intentions and Zi Dongwang was constantly approaching Jian Wushuang.

“Big trouble!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows were tightly knitted but suddenly…

“Huh?” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed and there was delight in his eyes. He could clearly feel that in the void within ten thousand miles of him was a figure in a white robe flying over.

Through his Soul Power, he could see the features of the figure in white robe clearly.

“It’s him!”

Jian Wushuang was delighted and he immediately switched directions without hesitation. He plunged towards the figure in the white robe.

Very soon, he appeared before the figure in white robe.

“Haha, Duan Lingfeng, long time no see!” Jian Wushuang laughed heartily.

“Duan Wushuang, it’s really you,” the man in the white robe who carried a saber on his back lifted his head to look at Jian Wushuang. Then, the corners of his lips lifted into a smile too.

Duan Lingfeng… He was a genius that Jian Wushuang had met in the dangerous Ancient Star Sea on his way to the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries back then and they were quite close.

Back in Ancient Star Sea, Jian Wushuang had saved the two people that Duan Lingfeng was escorting while Duan Lingfeng joined had forces with Jian Wushuang to resolve Jian Wushuang’s crisis once.

They had given a favor from one to another and they were both geniuses. Hence, they appreciated one another.

After they passed through Ancient Star Sea, they parted ways as they had their own agendas. After a few thousand years, Jian Wushuang never thought that he would meet Duan Lingfeng again in Wu Bei’s cave, and they happened to meet at a time when he needed help.

“You need help?” Duan Lingfeng stood there with a faint smile. He had already noticed the existence of Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu from behind.

“Of course, I do,” Jian Wushuang broke into a smile and he stopped next to Duan Lingfeng.

“The second place on Universe God ranking list, Zi Dongwang and the sixth place on Universe God ranking list, Xin Zhu!” Duan Lingfeng fixed his gaze on the two people who were chasing them from afar. There was light glistening in his eyes and at the very next moment…

Rumble!

A terrifying Sword Intention suddenly erupted and soared up above Ninth Heaven.

The surrounding heaven and earth was drowned in a sea of Sword Intention.

Jian Wushuang stood next to Duan Lingfeng. He was clear about the feeling of the Sword Intention and his pupils contracted.

“This bolt of Sword Intention… I see,” Jian Wushuang understood then.

Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu who were chasing them suddenly stopped.

“Such strong Sword Intention! This bolt of Sword Intention seems to be able to tear everything down in heaven and earth. It struck fear into me,” Zi Dongwang creased his eyebrows as he looked over at Duan Lingfeng.

White-robed, carrying a saber on his back, a strong Sword Intention…

Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu immediately knew the person’s identity.

“You’re the White-robed Swordsman on the third place on Universe God ranking list?” Zi Dongwang sounded cold.

“You are the one who defeated Demon Girl Ling Luo?” Xin Zhou’s face grew unusually solemn.

The birth of Wu Bei’s cave had led to a fight and massacre among countless Universe Gods. There were also many unfamiliar experts who got listed on Universe God ranking list.

Among the unfamiliar experts, the mysterious White-robed Swordsman was the strongest.

He defeated Demon Girl Ling Luo head on and got listed on the third place on Universe God ranking list, right behind God Destroying King and Zi Dongwang.

However, it had been a while since the White-robed Swordsman had defeated Ling Luo and no one knew his real name. Even on Universe God ranking list, he was known as the White-robed Swordsman.

Then, the White-robed Swordsman appeared before them in person.

“The third place on Universe God ranking list, Duan Lingfeng. That’s really impressive,” Jian Wushuang teased. He knew that Duan Lingfeng was a true genius back when they were at Ancient Star Sea and even King of Venomous Worms admired him. After a few thousand years, Duan Lingfeng’s power had obviously improved a lot more.

“Aren’t you in the fifth place yourself?” Duan Lingfeng smiled faintly. One should know that when he first met Jian Wushuang at Ancient Star Sea, although Jian Wushuang had showed shocking talent, his wasn’t strong in power. Back then, Jian Wushuang was only a Universe God in the First Heaven.

But then… he was one of the top few among all Universe Gods in Eternal Chaotic World. In term of improvement speed, Jian Wushuang was slightly faster than he was.

“White-robed Swordsman, the one that we want to fight is Jian Wushuang. It has nothing to do with you. If you want the White Blaze Fruit, wait until we kill Jian Wushuang and we will share them with you. What do you think?” Zi Dongwang looked at Duan Lingfeng and said.

Duan Lingfeng looked at Zi Dongwang coldly, “Firstly, I am not interested in the White Blaze Fruit. I came to the cave simply to fight with other experts!”

“Secondly, Jian Wushuang is my friend!”

“Ever since cultivation, I have not had many friends but Jian Wushuang in one of them. If you want to kill him, it means that you want to kill me!”

The moment he said that, Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and he felt touched.

But Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu’s faces grew grave.

“It seems like a lost cause. We can only fight!” Zi Dongwang said in a low voice.

“You want to fight? Who’s afraid?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly while Blood Mountain Sword in his hands quivered vigorously.

Previously, it had been only him alone. He could only run away when he was fighting against Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu.

But then, he had Duan Lingfeng’s assistance. He wasn’t afraid of the two of them.

“I only came here with the intention to fight against experts. Xin Zhu is only in the sixth place on the Universe God ranking list, I am not interested in him. My opponent will be Zi Dongwang,” Duan Lingfeng said.

“If so, I shall leave Zi Dongwang to you and I shall take care of Xin Zhu,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Mm,” Duan Lingfeng nodded faintly.

After they came to a mutual understanding, swoosh! Duan Lingfeng took action first.

Rumble. A terrifying Sword Intention had flooded into the entire universe. Duan Lingfeng’s figure turned illusionary and appeared before Zi Dongwang while the saber behind his back was instantly out of the scabbard.

“The eleventh!”

Heaven and earth grew dim. In the boundless darkness, a brilliant crimson sword light suddenly descended.

Looking at the crimson sword light, even Zi Dongwang’s pupils shrunk. He immediately brought out his divine power and concentrated on his palms. He was wearing a pair of purple gloves and there was purple light soaring up into the sky.

“Purple Glory Sky Collapse!”

Hong!

A terrifying power suddenly exploded.

As Duan Lingfeng was fighting with Zi Dongwang, Jian Wushuang moved too.

“Xin Zhu, during the earlier fight, both you and I had scruples. Now, let’s fight again!” Jian Wushuang’s voice reverberated.

“Humph. Who is afraid? I happen to want to take back my ranking, fifth place on the Universe God ranking list. It’s mine!” Xin Zhu was raging in anger. A fierce consciousness swept out and suddenly became two tall headless warriors before him.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

The two headless warriors held long spears in their hands while they stepped in the void and charged towards Jian Wushuang.
