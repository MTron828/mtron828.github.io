Chapter 3571: Sword Principle, Narrow!

“Can’t you feel it?” Axe One Master frowned slightly and took a deep breath after a while. “In that case, we can only wait for another 20,000 years. If there is still no trace of the Heavenly Sword Marquis in the next 20,000 years, we can announce his death to the public.”

“20,000 years?” The people around were surprised.

After all, Jian Wushuang had been missing for 10,000 years.

If the other cultivators under Star Palace had been missing for thousands of years, Star Palace would have announced his death. However, Jian Wushuang had to wait for 30,000 years before announcing his death, it was obvious how important Jian Wushuang was to Star Palace.

Of course, Axe One Master and the others did not know the importance of Jian Wushuang, but they knew how much his Palace Master valued him.

The reason why they had waited so long to announce Jian Wushuang’s death was, to a large extent, because they wanted to wait until they were more certain before reporting the news to their Palace Master, in addition, they still had a glimmer of hope for Jian Wushuang.

Unfortunately, after another 20,000 years, there was still no news of Jian Wushuang.

This time, Axe One Master, Marquis Duan Yu, and the others no longer had any hope for Jian Wushuang. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Soon, the news of the Blood Sword Master’s death spread throughout the territory.

However, the three battlefields were extremely dangerous. There were countless experts from various forces in the Star Worlds. Although Jian Wushuang had a certain reputation, he was still a small fry compared to this territory, he was still a nobody.

Even if the news of his death spread, it would not cause any ripples in this territory. At most, he would only have contact with Jian Wushuang, Heavy Master, Saber Python Master, and Purple Sound Master, who had a certain friendship with him, sighed slightly in their hearts.

...

Time passed quickly, and the three battlefields were still bustling with activity.

In the depths of Devil Smoke Valley, Jian Wushuang had been trapped here for 50,000 years in the special space-time zone in the unknown region.

Being trapped for 50,000 years was a torture for Jian Wushuang. Fortunately, he could constantly fight with those human-shaped sculptures, and his swordsmanship and strength had been improving, therefore, he was not too lonely and boring.

In addition, after 50,000 years, he had become completely calm and even quiet.

Now, he was not worried about his predicament at all. Instead, he was looking forward to his future.

“50,000 years!”

“In these 50,000 years, I have fought with these six human-shaped sculptures many times. I have been pondering over the mysteries of their swordsmanship fusion. I didn’t understand how their swordsmanship could be perfectly fused together, and why their power would increase so much after the fusion. But now, I understand.”

Jian Wushuang stood there with a smile on his face as he looked at the six human-shaped sculptures in front of him.

That was right. For 50,000 years, he was still stuck in the six human-shaped sculptures. Even though his swordsmanship had improved greatly, he still could not break through the obstacles of the six human-shaped sculptures.

However, although he could not break through the obstacles of the six human-shaped sculptures, he understood the reason why the swordsmanship of the six human-shaped sculptures had suddenly skyrocketed.

“It’s the sword principle!”

“The reason why the sword techniques they displayed could be combined so perfectly is that the sword principle they have mastered is completely different from the sword principle I have mastered!”

“My sword principle is the solipsistic sword principle, with myself as the core. Even the power of the sword principle originates from the sword world condensed in my body. However, the sword principle of these human-shaped sculptures doesn’t have themselves as the core, but the entire heaven and earth as the core. The power of the sword principle they use also originates from the surrounding heaven and earth. To be exact, it originates from the vast universe!”

“Although my sword world is stable and powerful, it’s still just a small sword world. No matter how much my sword principle improves, its power will still be limited. However, the power of the sword principle from the universe is truly boundless!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, his eyes shining with a bright light.

He understood the shortcomings of his sword principle.

Just as he said, his sword principle was centered on himself. Although it was powerful, it was too narrow!

It was like a small stream. Although he could control it freely, how could the power of a small stream be compared to the mighty sea? Let alone the entire universe?

“Wrong, wrong!” Jian Wushuang laughed, “I’ve been using the Enlightenment system of the Divine Beginning Realm’s sword principle, with my own sword principle as the core. I’ve been improving step by step according to the level of the Divine Beginning Realm’s sword principle. However, I’ve never thought that the Divine Beginning Realm is just an unremarkable third-class world star in the vast universe. How could the cultivation system in this world star be complete? How can it all be right?”

“I couldn’t help it. I was born in the Divine Beginning Realm, so my horizons were too small. I didn’t see the true vastness of this universe, so I didn’t question some of the cultivation and comprehension systems in the Divine Beginning Realm. But now, I understand that the true Sword Dao isn’t based on oneself, but should be based on heaven and earth, with the vast universe as the core. That is the true vastness, the most powerful Sword Dao!”

“Ha ha ~ ~”

Jian Wushuang laughed crazily, and his laughter echoed in this special space and time.

The laughter lasted for a long time before it finally calmed down.

In the middle of the high platform, Jian Wushuang had already sat down with his legs crossed. His eyes were cold, and his body slightly shook. In an instant, a huge and complete sword world appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

This sword world was the sword principle world that Jian Wushuang had spent a great deal of money to condense. It represented Jian Wushuang’s achievements in sword principle. Now, this sword world spanned 100,000 years, the boundless sword tree in the center was also 100,000 feet tall. Its branches were lush and lush, covering the entire sword world. In this sword world, there were mountains, rivers, and everything that a normal world should have.

This was formed after Jian Wushuang reached the third level of sword principle and evolved everything.

But now...looking at the sword world in front of him, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were extremely cold.

“I have a hunch that my judgment is not wrong.”

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang made up his mind. In an instant...the entire sword world began to collapse at an astonishing speed.

Jian Wushuang had destroyed the sword world that he had painstakingly condensed!
