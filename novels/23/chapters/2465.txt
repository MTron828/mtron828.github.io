Chapter 2466: It Was Born!

There was an upheaval outside Saint’s Tomb!

The uncontestable Heaven’s Will encircled in the void above with its will power shockingly getting stronger and stronger.

The sects’ experts on the glade were speechless and horrified.

At the same time, the world went through some drastic changes.

In an ordinary city within Wusha Wilderness, a bearded white-haired old man dressed in plain green robes was slowly walking bare-footed on the streets.

That old man who went through the vicissitudes of life was holding a canvas in his hand. The canvas had characters written on it which said ‘Psychic’ and ‘Fortune Telling’.

As if the old man could sense the drastic changes in the Heavens above, he paused in his steps and looked up into Heaven.

“Finally a breakthrough?”

“Haha...”

The bare-footed white-haired old man heartily laughed with a hint of surprise in his insane laughter.

Fortunately, the city was quite deserted and there were only a few people on the streets. No one cared about that bare-footed white-haired old man.

The bare-footed white-haired old man restrained himself from laughing and his eyes displayed melancholy.

“Old friend, you really did it. It finally paid off to wait for you for so many years!”

“Go with a peace of mind and leave the rest to me.”

The bare-footed white-haired old man murmured with his slightly bloodshot iris.

The white-haired and bare-footed old man then slowly raised his head and old wrinkly palm, pointing to the direction where Saint’s Tomb was located!

His pointing finger seems lifeless. Only a vague golden light shot out from the tip of his finger.

The old man was clearly more than a hundred million miles away from the tomb, but the golden light appeared in the next moment between Heaven and Earth outside the tomb.

Over there, Heaven’s Will was bombarding the area in a frantic manner.

A golden light descended from afar right in the middle of the chaotic will of Heavenly Way.

The golden light formed a golden vortex before mercilessly swallowing the thunderclouds floating around the Heavens, the terrifying-looking dark purple thunderbolts, and the endless will of Heavenly Way.

In the blink of an eye, the will of Heavenly Way in the void was completely swallowed.

The golden light dissipated as Heaven and Earth were restored to its peace once again as if nothing had happened.

On the glade down below, the various sects’ experts were confused.

“It’s gone?”

“The will of Heavenly Way disappeared?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“What was that golden light just now?”

Those First-Class Divine Demons and Peak Divine Demons on the glade were in a state of stupor.

They had no idea what had happened. The only certainty was the terrifying will of Heavenly Way was gone!

However, the increasing life rating pressure coming out of the tomb was still going on at crazed speed and did not seem like it was going to end.

...

The Ancient God Domain was huge.

It’s incredibly huge!

For example, Wusha Wilderness was only a drop in the ocean compared to the huge Ancient God Domain. Totally inconspicuous.

In a wide territory far away from Wusha Wilderness, countless experts had gathered at the core of the Ancient God Domain!

That was the Three Divine Realms!

A dojo that stretched far and wide was suspended in the void above with more than ten million cultivators sitting cross-legged in the center.

Those cultivators were of myriad levels with a mixture of powerful and weak ones. Among them were those in the Chaotic Realm, Divine Demon Realm, Ultimate God, and Undying Saint. Some were even of the highest-ranking Undying Saints!

Regardless of their strength and status, all of them sat there with humility and held their breath as they watched the person on the high platform in front.

That man was a bald man clothed in white robes and he was smiling. The bald man was bare-footed as he stood there bathed under the sun. White lights were glowing from his body, giving off a relaxed impression like a gentle breeze blowing on one’s face.

He sat there and casually spoke, but each of his words contained a magical power that made those more than ten million Divine Demons gathered below intoxicated.

He was preaching to the more than ten million cultivators in front of him.

Everyone was listening attentively.

The white-robed bald man abruptly stopped halfway through.

The smile on his face slowly receded as his expression became solemn.

“All of you, go on and meditate upon what I’ve taught today.”

The white-robed bald man finished his sentence before slowly closed his eyes.

...

In a bloodied space.

Both Heaven and Earth were covered in bright red.

The pungent smell of blood filled the air.

Yet, a woman stood there calmly.

The woman with a beautiful face was like a fairy who came out of a painting and carried herself with a unique aura.

She was extremely cold and indifferent.

Besides her cold grandeur, the woman carried an absolute sense of pride.

Her arrogance was probably because she used to be at the peak of the world.

In the void before that cold and beautiful woman was another woman.

The other woman wore a veil so her appearance could not be clearly seen, but her body shape was no better than the cold woman. She was fighting with countless cultivators at that moment.

At the feet of the veiled woman laid plenty of bodies with blood flowing like streams.

No one knew how many cultivators died in the hands of that veiled woman.

Suddenly, the cold and beautiful woman who had been watching at the side stirred and slowly shut her eyes.

At the same time...

In the eternal burning flames, an intimidating devil wearing purple armor was awakened. He looked up at the Heaven above but closed his eyes again after a while.

A blood-clothed woman in a manor served by countless male servants also closed her eyes.

...

In the Chaotic Domain, there were no rules and orders nor were there laws of Heaven and Earth. There was nothing at all.

The only thing available was a dimly-lit light.

Wham! Wham! Wham! Wham!

Four figures appeared in the Chaotic Domain out of thin air. They were the preaching white-robed bald man, the cold and beautiful woman, the purple-armored devil, and the blood-clothed woman.

The four of them looked straight at the dimly-lit light ahead.

An emotionless voice emerged slowly intermittently from the dimly-lit light.

“It was born!”

Those simple words changed the faces of those four imposing figures.

The intermittent voice sounded again.

“Someone is trying to deceive the Heavens. I don’t know that person’s specific location.”

“Find and destroy it. Only then will the Heavenly Way...survive!”

“The Heavenly Way, the world, and all beings will die otherwise!”

After the voice died down, the gray light disappeared.

The four imposing figures looked solemn with their hearts shaken.
