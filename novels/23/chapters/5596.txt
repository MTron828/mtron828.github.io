Chapter 5595: Heart Blood

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation  Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Above the sea!

Broly, coming from the disadvantageous position, gradually reached a stalemate with the formidable beast. The eight tentacles of the powerful beast constantly entwined around Broly, but its aura had already been suppressed.

Buzz!

The tentacles erupted once again with a dark red power, forming a storm that instantly vaporized all the mountains and rocks along the coastline.

The explosive aura swept over, throwing many weaker Emperors into disarray.

Only Island Lord Gui Ling and a few tier 6 Emperors could still stand firm.

“This is the Beast God’s Secret Technique!”

“The bloodline of this Beast Emperor is surging!”

The powerful beings on the side of the demon race had fiery eyes.

That was the bloodline of the Beast God!

Jian Wushuang and Moluo, standing at the back, were also astonished.

Especially Jian Wushuang.

The Beast God was an indispensable part of his cultivation. The essence blood of the Beast God and the Beast God Weapon were crucial factors in enhancing his strength, especially the current Beast God Weapon.

Feeling the eruption of the Beast God’s bloodline, the crimson light emitted from his Beast God Weapon.

Lifting his left arm, the Candle Dragon Arm, the dark red skin revealed clear and visible blood vessels, emanating an extremely violent power.

Jian Wushuang slightly suppressed it, understanding it in his heart!

The fusion of the Beast God Weapon with him, coupled with the strong desire for the Beast God’s bloodline, was normal.

Moreover, with the influence of the Devouring power of his Origin Source within, the evil intention of Devouring all things surged once again.

However, now that he had mastered the complete power of All Things and even created a unique Life power, he could control it freely.

If it were in the past, he would have already rushed over, unable to control the surging power.

However, even though he could control it now, he would still go.

The bloodline power within the body of that desolate beast was formidable and exceptionally pure!

If refined, it would be of great assistance to him.

Although the Beast God Weapons had mostly been restored at this point, they were not in their complete form.

One piece was still missing!

The Heart of the Beast God.

When Shen Ling Frolasa assisted him in crafting the Beast God Weapon, he mentioned that even if he gathered all the necessary components and crafted the Origin Source of the Beast God, it wouldn’t be able to restore the earth-shattering power of ancient times.

To fully restore it, the crucial missing element was the blood from the heart.

That precise essence found on the Heart of the Beast God.

It was more precious than the blood of the Beast God itself.

But where could one find a Beast God now?

Only when the river of time settled and deposited again, reviving with the flow of ages, would a naturally born Beast God appear.

For the current Jian Wushuang, obtaining the essence of the Beast God’s blood was even more challenging than reaching the state of the Heavenly Dao.

However, a rare opportunity had presented itself.

The Beast Emperor!

Originally staying in the Earth Realm due to Broly, it seemed he was now changing his focus.

Or perhaps, resolve the Beast Emperor and Broly entirely.

For those who posed a threat to him, it was best to deal with them all.

Otherwise, they would become future troubles.

Broly was one such threat, and so was Jiang Shang.

Moreover, Jiang Shang had been taken away by Mie Sheng, already becoming an enemy of the Qishen Temple, which made things easier to handle.

When the time came, with Zhen Ling supporting, dealing with Jiang Shang would be manageable.

However, Broly was different. He was still associated with the Qishen Temple, and with his mastery of the Dao of Transformation, his strength had progressed terrifyingly.

Broly needed to be eliminated as soon as possible; otherwise, he would become a future calamity.

The opponent had flaws in his character, so even if a conflict arose and he was killed, Zhen Ling wouldn’t hold any grudges.

Currently, his importance far surpassed that of Broly.

Hu Qing was in a deep slumber, and Shang was in seclusion.

The only ones comparable to these two were him.

Although Shang was still the most powerful first Inheritor, he had not yet achieved a complete harmony with the Dao. There was still some gap between him and Hu Qing.

In the future of the Qishen Temple, he was needed.

Not Broly.

Jian Wushuang had also pinpointed this crucial aspect.

However, looking at it now, it seemed that he might not need to intervene; Broly was already in a dire situation.

Roar!

The Eight-Armed Beast Emperor roared, its eight tentacles coiling tightly around Broly, squeezing his physical body until it burst, leaving only his divine body and Origin Source.

“Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!!!!” Broly’s face contorted in agony as he howled to the sky.

The force pressed him so hard that he couldn’t even catch his breath.

Whew!

Jian Wushuang took a step forward, his figure appearing directly above the coast.

Moluo, standing on the ground, thought Jian Wushuang was going to help and ascended into the air.

“You don’t need to take action!” Jian Wushuang spoke up.

This matter could only be handled by him alone.

If he pulled Moluo into this, Zhen Ling would certainly not forgive him due to face-saving concerns.

Moluo, unaware of Jian Wushuang’s thoughts, hesitated for a moment and said, “Young Master, what are you planning with this Beast Emperor?”

He was still somewhat concerned about Jian Wushuang. Although Jian Wushuang’s sword mastery in the Human Realm had surpassed his understanding, he later discovered that the cost of using that sword move was very high. Even Jian Wushuang needed an hour to recover to his peak state.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

This sword move was a double-edged sword. If he could defeat the opponent, everyone would rejoice. If not, it would be a complete loss.

Jian Wushuang, weakened, had a significantly reduced strength. He probably wouldn’t be a match for a tier 5 Emperor.

However, since Jian Wushuang insisted, as a guard, Moluo couldn’t say much and could only be prepared to rescue at any time.

Jian Wushuang, hovering in the air, did not rush to take action. If the Beast Emperor could defeat Broly, that would be even better.

He didn’t need to take action himself.

In the struggle between the sandpiper and the clam, he gained an advantage!

Broly, without a physical body, faced the terrifying power directly against the divine body, and then the Origin Source.

Now, the danger was imminent!

Island Lord Gui Ling and others moved one after another, preparing to lend a helping hand.

When they saw Jian Wushuang, they thought he was going to assist as well. In their hearts, they praised Jian Wushuang’s unique vision. Helping Lord Broly at this time would undoubtedly bring benefits in the future.

After all, Broly is currently flourishing on the Grave God Mountain, and in the Earth Realm, there are even faint traces of an Imperial Emperor’s figure.

If Broly takes another step forward, it is not impossible for him to unify the entire Earth Realm in the future.

A super Inheritor with such a bright future is someone everyone is willing to invest in.

Whether it is the strong in the Earth Realm or the Inheritors, they would all do so.

But Jian Wushuang’s thoughts, how could they know?!

Seeing the gathering figures around him, Jian Wushuang slowly opened his crimson eyes at the center of his eyebrows, and then burst out a blood-red light.

With just one glance, several tier 6 Emperors were instantly heavily injured.

Even Gui Ling retreated thousands of miles, a surging force churning in his chest, followed by spitting out a mouthful of blood.

“You!” Gui Ling pointed angrily at Jian Wushuang, wanting to speak but unable to open his mouth.

Jian Wushuang stood with the support of the crowd, hands behind his back, and said calmly, “Moluo, kill them!”

These powerful members of the monster clan, dying is just dying, there’s no need to be merciful.

Back in the Three Kings Court, after the fall of Bai Junwang, he hadn’t forgotten the taste of barely surviving.

Although Moluo was somewhat surprised at Jian Wushuang’s current stance, he didn’t hesitate and directly took action.

Several tier 6 Emperors were like chicks in Moluo’s hands, easily handled.
