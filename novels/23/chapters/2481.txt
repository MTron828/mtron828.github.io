Chapter 2482: Fighting Against Three Ultimate Gods

Each of those black thunderbolts bombarded Jian Wushuang’s divine body.

If it was an ordinary Divine Demon, those black thunderbolts would have instantly pulverized his body.

However, Jian Wushuang’s divine body was the most perfect divine body that only a Perfect Chaotic Creature could possess.

The black thunderbolts did no harm to his body.

“Humph!”

Letting out a cold and derisive snort, he discharged his majestic divine power and crushed those black thunderbolts into debris.

Jian Wushuang was suddenly alarmed.

He had similar feelings before in the Saint’s Tomb when Yu Aoqing planned her attack during the siege.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang disappeared and an apparition took the place where his previously physical body was.

Chug!

The void was torn apart as a sharp dagger directly passed through Jian Wushuang’s apparition.

A shrouded black-robed An Junzhu unexpectedly appeared in the void. She was the one who stabbed the dagger.

‘An apparition?’ An Junzhu squinted her beautiful eyes.

“Indeed, it’s you. Your skills are much more sophisticated than Yu Aoqing, but it’s a pity I won’t fall for the same trick twice.” Jian Wushuang’s figure appeared in a void not far away with a grin on his face.

Earlier at Saint’s Tomb, Jian Wushuang was not able to escape from Yu Aoqing’s perfect sudden attack.

If it were not because of his invincible divine body, he would have perished.

Even though An Junzhu had the perfect timing and technique, Jian Wushuang was no longer the same as before.

His ability to perceive danger had improved by multiple folds, allowing him to detect An Junzhu’s assassination move far in advance.

“Huh, don’t be too happy.”

An Junzhu glanced at Jian Wushuang coldly. In a flash, the dark air current circulating around produced identical figures. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Two figures stood side by side, each holding a dagger and aimed violently at Jian Wushuang.

“This is...the Dark Clone?” Jian Wushuang was amazed.

The Dark Clone was an ability acquired when the one reached a rather high level in understanding the Law of Darkness.

An Junzhu had obviously attained that ability with her high understanding of the law.

“Exterminate!”

Jian Wushuang raised his sword with a backhand motion. The sword technique impelled space-time and caused ripples to form in the surrounding void.

That was his Space-time Sword Technique—first form, Cutting Snow.

Two dark clones were immediately smashed by Jian Wushuang’s sword.

“Jian Wushuang!”

A loud roar sounded abruptly and Fan Jianxian appeared next to Jian Wushuang. His face was stern as the green long sword in his hand turned into a steel whirlwind.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

A series of sword shadows were attacking Jian Wushuang from multiple tricky angles.

Jian Wushuang had just defeated the two dark clones and was recovering from the suppression of both Sword World and Dark Air Currents. The sudden attack from Fan Jianxian had caught him off guard. However, he was able to regain his composure very quickly.

“Piss off, my defeated opponent!”

Jian Wushuang’s long sword thrust forward with the strength of samsara as he performed Transmigration Sword Technique—second form, Samsara Empty Strike.

Interchanging between the palpable and imperceptible moments, it was hard to see which sword moves were real and which were just an illusion. Fan Jianxian contracted his iris to stay focused.

He was wounded by Jian Wushuang before. Although he recovered a fair bit after swallowing the elixir pills, his combat power was nowhere at his peak. He dared not let down his guard and exhausted his strength to resist that attack when faced with Jian Wushuang’s sword, causing his body to be expelled to some distance away.

Right then, an extremely terrifying and violent aura came from above Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang raised his head, only to find Lei Chong had somehow appeared above him in the void. Lei Chong’s body soared to a height of five meters with two large hammers in his hands. The two large hammers looked like two hills and impelled the unabating power of black thunderbolts when being waved around.

“Go to hell, brat!”

Lei Chong descended like the God of Thunder while yelling. The two large hammers in his hand were swinging around frantically, ready to slam down hard on Jian Wushuang.

Rumbling...

The Heaven and Earth growled fiercely under those two large hammers.

Jian Wushuang knew it was too late for him to dodge, so he could only raise the sword in his hand and discharge an astonishing gush of divine powers to parry off the attack.

However...

With a loud bang, the Heaven seemed to crack open, releasing waves of violent black world-destroying thunderbolts.

After the loud noise, a stream of light slammed into the ground below like a meteorite.

That stream of light was surprisingly Jian Wushuang.

He was smashed into the ground by Lei Chong’s two large hammers and the ground suddenly shook as a huge pothole appeared.

Before Jian Wushuang could stand up from the pothole, a surging amount of black thunderbolts formed around Lei Chong’s body.

“Black thunderbolts explode!”

Kaboom!

Along with the collision of two large hammers, huge black thunderbolts as thick as buckets descended.

The huge black thunderbolt was aimed directly towards the pothole where Jian Wushuang was located.

Kaboom!

The pothole and the entire surface of the ground were destroyed.

The black thunderbolts covered the entire ground and destroyed everything.

After a while, the black thunderbolts gradually dispersed.

Somewhere above in the void, the trio—Lei Chong, An Junzhu, and Fan Jianxian stood side by side as they looked down below.

“Is Jian Wushuang dead?” Fan Jianxian murmured.

“Humph, if just based on attack power, I’m rather powerful and violent among many Ultimate Gods. This brat has been hit twice in succession. The last black thunderbolts explosion move was extremely powerful. Even an Ultimate God who suffered its frontal attack would be severely wounded if not killed. It would be hard for Jian Wushuang who is just a Divine Demon to resist that kind of impact,” explained Lei Kun scornfully.

“No, we can’t pass judgment based on common sense for Jian Wushuang. His divine body is invincible. Senior Brother Lei, your two moves might not be able to kill him, but perhaps it’s not a far cry to seriously injure him,” said Fan Jianxian.

“Let’s see.” An Junzhu seemed extremely cold.

From around the battlefield, the various sects’ experts were also staring at the seemingly lifeless scorched earth that had been previously covered by those black thunderbolts.

Jian Wushuang was in the hole.

Everyone was curious if Jian Wushuang survived those brutal attacks.

Suddenly... Boom!

Large rubbles were lifted up from the pit as a young figure stepped out of the debris and appeared in front of everyone.

“Your thunderbolts were good enough to scratch my itch.”

Jian Wushuang looked up at the trio in the void while grinning from ear to ear.
