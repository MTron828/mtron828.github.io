Chapter 820: Hatred

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Since a large number of experts had witnessed the fight between Jian Wushuang and Xia Yan in the Blood Battle Arena, it was impossible to hide the results.

The news spread like wildfire.

In less than a day, the result of their fight had spread throughout Cercis Island and become the favorite topic of countless warriors on Cercis Island.

No one had expected the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World, Xia Yan, to be miserably defeated by an expert in the same realm.

Jian Wushuang even defeated him with only three strikes. He was seriously injured by the first strike, had his weapon knocked out of his hand by the second strike, and would have been killed by the third strike if Jian Wushuang had not held back.

After that battle, everyone knew that the title of the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World had changed hands.

At the same time, Swordsman, a name seldom heard before, suddenly became well known to the public.

As the news that Swordsman beat Xia Yan spread, some of his battle results on Cercis Island had been dug up.

Like how, during the fights between Divine Realm experts in the Blood Battle Arena, he won 10 times in a row and each of his opponents were defeated with a single blow.

And, when he fought with Lei Xin of the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion head-on on Cercis Island, he was only at a disadvantage.

When those battle results became known, people accepted the fact that Swordsman had defeated Xia Yan.

After all, Lei Xin was an expert at the peak of Step Five of the Eternal Realm. If Swordsman could compete with him, it was normal for Swordsman to defeat Xia Yan.

But Xia Yan, who had been easily defeated by Jian Wushuang, was furious.

“Kill him, I’ll kill him!”

In a grand palace, Xia Yan, who still looked pale, was roaring wildly, shattering the tables, chairs, and even some of the decorations.

At this moment, his ferocious face was full of venom, which made him look like a hungry beast.

“I want to kill him, Elder He. I want to kill both of them, Swordsman and that bitch, Lin Wan!”

“I want them dead!”

His roar could almost shake the house.

Fortunately, Elder He had placed a Restriction around the palace to prevent the sound from spreading, or else his roar would surely have attracted attention from plenty of experts.

“Second master, calm down.”

The glum elder frowned at Xia Yan.

“Calm down? I’m the second master of the Xia Clan, the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World, but I was defeated by an unknown Divine Realm expert with three strikes and he even publicly mocked and humiliated me. How could I calm down when I feel so humiliated?” Xia Yan shouted while glaring at Elder He.

Elder He gave a slight sigh after listening to his words.

The Xia Clan was a big clan who possessed a profound history and great power within the Eternal World.

Therefore, most forces would not dare to offend them, but it also led to some core disciples of the Xia Clan not being able to receive the proper training.

Their second master, Xia Yan, was one of them. He had been arrogant since he was a child. Since the Xia Clan and his elder brother had been protecting him and clearing all the obstacles in his path, everything had always gone the way he wanted, so he grew more and more arrogant.

And this arrogance would always burst out when he was faced with a real setback.

If he were not so arrogant, then he would have at least been able to remain rational and calm on the surface. He would not have lost his cool when he was defeated by Jian Wushuang with three strikes.

“Elder He, I’ve said that I want them dead!” Xia Yan said gloomily.

Elder He squinted at him, and then shook his head, “Lin Wan is the daughter of the Lord of Cercis Island and he is not a common expert. He governs such a vast island near the Tang of the East,”

“Apart from other things, in terms of personal strength alone, the only person in our clan, besides the Ancestor, who could compete with him is probably the Master.”

“Plus, he has various friends. Of the four great Rulers in the Tang of the East, three of them are good friends of his, with the exception of Empress Qing. If it’s not necessary, our Xia Clan will never make enemies with such a man.”

“This time, we came here in hopes that you could marry Lin Wan and bring the Lord of Cercis Island over to our camp. But, no one expected this result.”

“Elder He, do you mean that I can’t deal with that bitch, Lin Wan?” Xia Yan asked with a somber look on his face.

“Yes,” Elder He nodded seriously, “You must never hurt Lin Wan. As for Swordsman, the man who defeated you… He’s not a common expert either.”

“He’s not a common expert? He was a nobody. What’s so special about him?” Xia Yan hastened to ask.

“Humph, you’re a Divine Realm expert, but so is he. You’re a genius that I spent countless resources to cultivate, but he defeated you with three strikes. You still think he’s a common expert?” Elder He cast a brief glance at Xia Yan and added, “I’m sure his background must be unusual.”

“He’s also not common. Does that mean I have to suffer this disgrace without doing anything?” Xia Yan yelled in a low voice.

“To suffer this disgrace without doing anything? No,” Elder He denied, “You’re the second master of our Xia Clan, and he humiliated you in front of so many people. If we have no action at all, our Xia Clan will lose face.”

“We will definitely deal with him, but we have to be careful about how we do it.”

Then he added, “Hold it in for a few days. I’ll have someone keep an eye on him and investigate his background immediately. If he has no backer, or his background is not powerful, we will just kill him. However, if he has an unusual background, we’ll have to find a way to kill him that can’t be traced back to us.”

“The Xia Clan is currently in their most critical period. All the years of planning that our clan and the Ancestor have made is finally coming to fruition. During this period, we need to try not to provoke others!”

“After this period, our clan will reach a whole new level. By then, no matter what background a person like Swordsman has, the person would be directly crushed to death by the mountain that is our Xia Clan!”

Once Xia Yan heard these words, his anger temporarily subsided.

“I get it. Then let him live a few days longer!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Xia Yan’s eyes were full of poison as he said, “As for that bitch Lin Wan. You’ll see! Wait until the Xia Clan finishes passing through this critical period and reaches a new level. At that point, I’ll make you regret what you’ve done to me!”

“If their plan comes true, our clan won’t care about the Lord of Cercis Island. At that time, you’ll be able to do whatever you want,” Elder He sneered.

For the next few days, Xia Yan really did stay in his mansion, not even leaving it once.

In the meantime, Elder He had sent someone to investigate Jian Wushuang’s background.

Along with their profound history, the Xia Clan also had a very good intelligence network. Within only a few days, they found out all about his background.
