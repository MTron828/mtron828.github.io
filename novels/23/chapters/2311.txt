Chapter 2312 Sounding Ou

“By the time Qingqing came back with help, that disciple was already dead. This left Qingqing extremely remorseful and she blamed herself for the incident. We had a hard time helping Qingqing get back on her feet. However, Zhuge Hong brought up the incident today again. He even humiliated Qingqing directly and accused her of abandoning her comrade. In the end, Qingqing cried,” Lin Yan said coldly.Jian Wushuang took a glance at Lin Qingqing.

His impression of her had always been of a gentle and adorable girl. However, he could now see signs of crying. From her eyes, he could tell she was still carrying strong guilt and self-hatred.

“It isn’t just that. For Qingqing, those who know about the incident have never told others about it. There weren’t any other people around then either. Logically speaking, no one should know about it. Yet, Zhuge Hong knew. Coupled with the fact that I heard Zhuge Hong happened to be in the vicinity then... If I’m right, they were probably aware Qingqing was in danger then. Furthermore, there’s a high chance that this was the doing of Zhuge Hong!” As he spoke, killing intent oozed from Lin Yan.

“Brother Wushuang, although Qingqing isn’t my biological sister, she’s even closer to me than a real one. I only blame myself for being incapable and unable to teach Zhuge Hong a lesson for Qingqing. I could only come to seek help from you.”

Jian Wushuang was also moved.

“Regardless of the taunts thrown out in a quarrel between the younger generation, they could be explained as a fit of anger. However, exposing one’s wound in the public and piling on insults, and even resorting to unscrupulous means would be a little much,” Jian Wushuang remarked.

“Alright, I’ll go take a look with you.”

“Great! He’s at the drill ground in our Lin Mansion. Let’s hurry there.” Lin Yan perked up with joy.

Soon, with Lin Yan taking the lead, Jian Wushuang arrived at the drill ground.

The drill ground was congested with a large number of younger generation disciples. Also, many Lin Mansion experts had gathered there.

In front of these experts, an unruly young man in a black robe was standing there. He had a mocking smile across his face while looking at the crowd from Lin Mansion disdainfully.

Although there were numerous Lin Mansion disciples and experts, they didn’t amount to anything in his eyes.

Jian Wushuang could tell that the young man in the black robe was Zhuge Hong.

However, he wasn’t paying attention to Zhuge Hong. Instead, he was staring at an old man in a grey robe behind Zhuge Hong. The old man in the grey robe was squinting his eyes and had hidden his aura perfectly. Nonetheless, Jian Wushuang could tell with a single glance that this was a true Chaotic Divine Demon.

Chaotic Divine Demon would definitely be experts at the top of the pyramid in Anjiu Prefecture. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“The Divine Demon expert is following Zhuge Hong personally and yet he has showed no intention of stopping Zhuge Hong. Rather, he appears to be doing so on purpose...” Jian Wushuang smiled gently. “Lin Yan, if I got it right, Zhuge Hong’s purpose isn’t simply taunting the younger generation disciples. He is most likely trying to sound you guys out.”

“Sound us out? What do you mean?” Lin Yan was puzzled.

“Lin Family has always been in conflict with the Zhuge Family. The hatred between both sides runs deep and both parties will want to annihilate the other completely. The only shame is that none of the parties have the absolute strength needed to crush the other. but now Zhuge Family is probably thinking of taking action against your Lin Family. Therefore, they sent Zhuge Hong over. He looks like he was just provoking you guys but, in fact, he’s trying to sound out the strength of your Lin Family,” explained Jian Wushuang.

“Even so, how is he going to do that?” Lin Yan was still confused.

“He definitely couldn’t do so alone. However, did you notice the old man in grey robe behind him? That grey-robed old man is a Chaotic Divine Demon. It is just that he is great at hiding his aura and did not attract the attention of others. Zhuge Hong is acting so arrogantly now. If the younger generation disciples can’t stop him, the experts will then be needed. Once an expert shows himself, the grey-robed old man will make a move instantly. His ultimate objective is to force the Chaotic Divine Demon in the Lin Mansion to step in,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Divine Demon? That old man is a Chaotic Divine Demon?” Lin Yan was astounded.

“Damn it. My father suffered serious injuries when he fought another Chaotic Divine Demon more than a decade ago. He hasn’t recovered fully from it yet. As for the other Chaotic Divine Demon of our Lin Family, he has been roaming the outside world for a long time and has yet to return. If the Zhuge Family take actions now...”

“That must be it. Zhuge Family definitely knows about your family’s predicament. His trip this time was definitely to force your father into stepping out so they could assess how much strength your father still possesses. Or perhaps they are trying to find out if the Chaotic Divine Demon that is out has returned. Once they get an answer, the Zhuge Family will definitely make a move,” said Jian Wushuang.

He had lived closed to 100,000 years in his previous lifetime and had seen countless situations. He could see through Zhuge Family’s plot with a single glance.

“This won’t do. I have to inform my father immediately,” Lin Yan said.

“That’s not necessary. Your father had probably seen through the motives of the Zhuge Family.” Jian Wushuang chuckled. Through his soul power, he could sense that Lin Tiefeng and the three Half Step Divine Demons of Lin Family had hidden together.

It seems like the family head of Lin Family has no intention of revealing his current fighting powers. Instead, he probably intends for the three Half Step Divine Demons to intercept the other party. However, with just three Half Step Divine Demons, they will likely not be able to stop that grey-robed old man. Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

Divine Demon and Half Step Divine Demon might seem really close, but the difference was enormous.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang could tell that the grey-robed old man wasn’t an ordinary Chaotic Divine Demon. He was definitely powerful.

It wouldn’t have been realistic to expect just three Half Step Divine Demons to hold up against the grey-robed old man.

In the end, Lin Tiefeng would likely have to step in to knock him back.

If that were the case, the other party would be able to tell how much strength Lin Tiefeng had left.

“Brother Wu Shuang, what should we do?” asked Lin Yan.

“Simple. I just have to step in and dispatch Zhuge Hong. As long as a younger generation disciple can defeat Zhuge Hong directly, that grey-robed old man won’t have an excuse to make a move. Their attempt this time won’t achieve their objectives. However, if this is the case, I will probably be implicated in the conflicts of the two families,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Brother Wushuang, this...” Lin Yan furrowed his brows.

“It’s alright.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand and chuckled. “Your father and mine are brothers of life and death. If Lin Family is in danger, my father will definitely not sit back and do nothing. He would definitely step in and I too would be implicated. Since the outcome is the same, there’s nothing to worry about. Let’s go.”

“Alright.” Lin Yan nodded his head heavily before walking forward with Jian Wushuang.
