Chapter 2828: Hidden Loss

——

“How could Alliance Master Sword One be on par with the Marquis of Three Yin? This...”

Elder Tong, Great Divine Master Jue Xin, and other experts from the Sword Alliance were all shocked.

After all, they had witnessed the battle between Jian Wushuang and the Marquis of Three Yin more than a year ago.

Although the Marquis of three Yin could not defeat Jian Wushuang in the end, it was obvious that the Marquis of Three Yin was much stronger than Jian Wushuang in terms of strength. Jian Wushuang had only relied on his body-protection ability to survive, the Marquis of Three Yin.

But now, Jian Wushuang was on par with the Marquis of Three Yin in just over a year?

How could he have improved so much in just over a year?

“No wonder Mr. Sword One dared to accept the challenge. It turns out that he was already confident.”

Yin Su’er, Yun Shan, and the others stood there, looking at the scene on the battlefield with a pleasant surprise.

Jian Wushuang, who was fighting wildly with the Marquis of Three Yin in the middle of the battlefield, was not very satisfied with the situation in front of him.

“The Marquis of Three Yin is indeed an invincible divine master. I controlled the reincarnation sword formation and fought him with spacetime swordsmanship. He was still suppressed by my domain, but in the end, I was only on par with him...”

“A draw is not what I want.”

Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He agreed to fight the Marquis of Three Yin in front of the two armies because he had absolute confidence in his strength and knew that he was strong enough to fight the Marquis of Three Yin now.

Secondly, he had the same idea as the Marquis of Three Yin. He also wanted to defeat the Marquis of Three Yin in front of the experts of the Heavenly Void Palace, which would bring a certain blow to the experts of the Heavenly Void Palace.

It was obviously not enough for them to fight to a draw.

“Let’s not talk about defeating the Marquis of Three Yin first. At least I have to let him suffer some losses.” Jian Wushuang made up his mind, and his eyes immediately flashed with a fierce light.

He was just relying on his swordsmanship to compete with the Marquis of Three Yin in speed, but suddenly, Jian Wushuang’s sword momentum changed.

An invisible sword essence burst out.

He just casually swung his sword, looking like an ordinary person slashing a wooden sword.

However, when he swung his long sword, a sword light immediately lit up.

This sword light was extremely weak, extremely dim, and incomplete.

It was an incomplete light, a remnant light!

However, when this remnant light appeared, in the blink of an eye, there were hundreds and thousands of scattered lights in the world.

Under the eyes of many experts on the battlefield, the original Jian Wushuang suddenly became hundreds and thousands of people!

It was the eighth move of space-time swordsmanship, thousand-sided residual light!

“Ultimate skill?”

Seeing the residual light coming toward him, the Marquis of Three Yin’s eyes turned cold.

He suddenly stretched out his right hand.

It was still the divine claw, but this claw was also faster.

Bang!

A crisp sound rang out. The ray of light that Jian Wushuang used was caught by the Marquis of Three Yin’s right claw.

After catching it, Jian Wushuang’s expression did not change. Not far from him, the black divine sword formed by 18 underworld blood swords pierced through again.

Their speed and power were extremely powerful.

“Annoying thing, get away from me!” The Marquis of Three Yin growled, trying to push back the sword formation.

However, at this moment, Jian Wushuang pointed his index finger at a distance.

Buzz, buzz, a majestic power of space-time rule swept out immediately.

Space-time divine skill, one point divine skill!

Jian Wushuang had not used this move when he was fighting the Marquis of Three Yin before, but now he had suddenly used it.

This time, there was no sign of it, and the Marquis of Three Yin was not vigilant, but he sensed that the power of space-time rule had already taken effect.

In an instant, the space-time around the Marquis of Three Yin froze.

The Marquis of Three Yin himself immediately froze and lost the ability to resist.

However, the Marquis of Three Yin was, after all, a powerful invincible divine master. Although Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of the space-time rule was extremely high, his divine power was still inferior. The heaven-designated skill he was using now... it was indeed very useful for a Peak Great Divine Master, but it was not very effective for an Invincible Divine Master like the Marquis of Three Yin.

The Marquis of Three Yin was frozen for only a moment, which was very short.

When he came back to his senses, the black divine sword had only just appeared in front of him.

Although he was caught off guard, the Marquis of Three Yin was still able to block it.

“Get lost!”

With a loud shout, the Marquis of Three Yin swung his claw.

Clang!

The blood-red claw collided with the black divine sword.

After all, the Marquis of Three Yin was caught off guard. He did not exert his full strength, but he was at an absolute disadvantage in this collision.

“Humph!”

The Marquis of Three Yin even let out a muffled groan and his body was forced back.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang could not help but smile.

Although the collision did not cause much damage to the Marquis of Three Yin, he still made the Marquis of Three Yin suffer a hidden loss and made him a little embarrassed.

This little embarrassment was enough for Jian Wushuang.

On the side of the battlefield, the experts of the Heavenly Void Palace had been watching the battle attentively. When they saw that Jian Wushuang could fight with the Marquis of Three Yin, they were already very surprised, but now they saw Jian Wushuang force the Marquis of Three Yin to retreat.

And judging from the Marquis of Three Yin’s expression, it was obvious that he had suffered a hidden loss.

This made the experts of the Heavenly Void Temple look very strange.

At the front of the experts, the commander of the Heavenly Void Army was also a little pale.

He had asked the Marquis of Three Yin to fight because he wanted the Marquis of Three Yin to defeat Sword One directly, which would cause a certain blow to the morale of the experts of the Pill Sun Sacred World. But now, after the battle, the morale of the experts of the Pill Sun Sacred World did not suffer a blow, on the contrary, it had increased quite a lot.

On the other hand, the experts from their heavenly void palace camp were more or less unhappy when they saw that the Marquis of three Yin had suffered a hidden loss.

It could be said that he had stolen the chicken but failed.

“There is no need to waste time. Let’s directly act.” The expression of the commander of the Heavenly Void Army sank. His majestic voice sounded across the entire ice plains.

“Heavenly Void Army, move out!”

Following the command of the Heavenly Void Army’s commander, the Heavenly Void Army, whose expression was filled with solemness and killing intent, immediately moved out.

It was not just the Heavenly Void Army. The Great Divine Masters from the Heavenly Void Palace also rushed out at the same time.

On the Heavenly Void Realm’s side, there were nearly 160 Great Divine Masters. In addition to the many Heavenly Divine Masters within the Heavenly Void Army, they were like wasps as they directly rushed over.

Seeing this scene, the gazes of the experts from the Pill Sun Sacred Realm also turned cold.
