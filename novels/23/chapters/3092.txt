Chapter 3093: A Strand of Black Hair

Shua!

A purple phantom, like a purple ghost, suddenly flashed out, flashing out two dazzling purple demonic lights in the air.

“It’s appeared, Han’s purple evil weapon!”

“This is the purple evil weapon? It’s so fast, and it feels so terrifying!”

“Haha, Purple Evil Weapon, this is Han’s method of becoming famous. Previously, Han relied on this purple evil weapon to win nine battles in a row in this arena!”

Numerous exclamations sounded out one after another in the spectating area.

When he saw the ghost-like purple evil weapon shooting over explosively, the Mo Axe let out a cold cry, and then he took a swift step forward, and the huge black axe in his hand followed the momentum to descend.

The Mo Axe did not look fast, but it struck the purple evil weapon.

Clang!

With a loud sound, the terrifying power sent the purple evil weapon flying.

“Die!”

With a roar, the demon axe appeared in front of Jian Wushuang in two steps. Then he swung the black giant axe in his hand.

He knew very well that an expert like Han, who controlled the sword formation, would be easily killed by him once he lost the sword formation and got close to him.

However, Jian Wushuang had already retreated rapidly when he saw Mo Axe approaching him.

Streaks of silver light flashed. When Mo Axe’s giant axe fell, Jian Wushuang had already dodged to the side.

Mo Axe was not impatient. Han’s purple evil weapon and his movement technique were famous in the arena.

Only the purple evil weapon and its extremely fast movement technique were qualified to win nine matches in a row in the arena.

Swish!

The purple evil weapon flashed and shot toward Mo Axe again.

Mo Axe immediately waved his huge axe to block it.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

The sound of metal colliding echoed throughout the battlefield.

The battle between the two was unusually intense.

Jian Wushuang had come to the gladiator arena as a rank one True Saint, so his divine power had remained at the peak of rank one True Saint from the first battle until now. His divine power had not increased at all, with the divine power of a rank one True Saint, he tried his best to control the reincarnation sword formation.

He was now using the sixth level of the reincarnation sword formation, which was called Yin Luo. It was an extremely demonic and powerful sword formation.

He had already used the power of the sword formation to its maximum. If he took one more step, he would be at the seventh level of the reincarnation sword formation.

“This devil axe is indeed worthy of being able to win 21 matches in a row in the gladiator arena. His strength is indeed not bad.” Jian Wushuang was secretly amazed.

In terms of strength, this Mo Axe was probably slightly stronger than Jiu Luo.

If Jian Wushuang had used his swordsmanship or the space-time principles, he could have easily defeated this Mo Axe. But now, he just wanted to temper his samsara principles and the Samsara Sword Formation. With the sixth level of the Samsara Sword Formation alone, he could not defeat his opponent.

Now, the reincarnation sword formation was at an absolute disadvantage in the face of the magic axe. The Mo Axe kept closing in on him, trying to bring him pressure.

“But this is the only way to make it interesting,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

He had won nine matches in a row. The nine opponents did not pose any threat to him, nor did they have any effect on his reincarnation sword formation.

But now, Mo Axe was an excellent opponent for him to train.

“Kill!”

Jian Wushuang’s killing intent soared to the sky, and he exerted his comprehension of the reincarnation rule to the maximum. Although the purple evil weapon was knocked back by Mo Axe time and time again, it rushed forward again and again.

“Ah, ah, ah!”

Mo Axe was also very irritable. While crazily repelling the purple evil weapon, he also wanted to keep getting close to Jian Wushuang.

Unfortunately, Jian Wushuang’s movement skills were compatible with the space-time principles. It was impossible for Mo Axe to get close to him.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The sounds of collisions kept ringing out.

In just a moment, the purple evil weapon controlled by Jian Wushuang had collided with Mo Axe’s black axe more than hundreds of times.

Under such intense collision and pressure, it greatly promoted Jian Wushuang’s reincarnation principles.

Finally…buzz!

Jian Wushuang felt a flash of inspiration in his mind, and the part that had puzzled him about the reincarnation rule suddenly became clear.

His comprehension of the reincarnation rule immediately reached a new level!

“I’ve made a breakthrough!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a trace of surprise. He raised his head and glanced at the extremely violent Mo Axe in front of him, but his eyes turned cold.

“Buzz!” The purple evil weapon that was flying at high speed suddenly disintegrated. After disintegrating, it reassembled again at an extremely fast speed.

However, this time, the purple longswords were no longer purple evil weapons, but formed a cross-shaped purple sword.

“Go!”

Jian Wushuang flashed a sharp light, and the cross-shaped purple sword suddenly shot out.

Swish!

The audience only saw a flash of purple light.

The purple light was very weak and small, like a needle or, more accurately, a hair.

The seventh level of the Samsara Sword Formation was called a black hair!

However, the purple light, which was as small as a hair, was dozens of times faster and more powerful than the purple evil weapon!

Each level of the Samsara Sword Formation was more powerful than the last!

The seventh level of the sword formation was naturally much stronger than the sixth level.

Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of the Samsara principles had reached a new level, and his power had soared again!

“Get lost!”

Seeing the purple light shooting toward him, the Mo Axe, which had been in a berserk state, wanted to swing the giant axe in his hand to split the purple light.

But in the end… Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Clang!

The purple light and the black giant axe collided head-on, and the terrifying power instantly changed the direction of the black giant axe’s attack. Then, the purple light continued to attack the Mo Axe’s divine body.

Boom!

The center of the divine body of the Mo Axe caved in, and his body instantly retreated to the edge of the battlefield. It took him a long time to stop again.

After he stopped, he raised his head again and looked at Jian Wushuang with a hint of shock.

As for the surrounding audience, there was a brief silence, followed by an unprecedented uproar.

“Cold!”

“Cold!”

“Cold!”

The entire arena was cheering Jian Wushuang’s name.

It was obvious that Jian Wushuang had won this duel!

At this moment, Jian Wushuang’s face was also filled with joy. Of course, he was not happy because he had defeated his opponent, but because he had made a breakthrough in the reincarnation principle.

“The reincarnation rule has reached the third stage. The reincarnation sword formation can also be used at the seventh stage. You can leave now.” Jian Wushuang smiled.
