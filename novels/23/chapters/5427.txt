Chapter 5426 ¬†Abandoned Chess Pieces

Shang stood on the black lotus, eyes glinting with determination. "Regardless of who you are, in today's battle, I will give it my all."

"Good!"

...

No one knew what happened in this battle, only the image of a lotus forever imprinted in this space.

Visible from a great distance.

The power of destruction obliterated everything.

In the time and space river outside the Qishen Temple.

Shang, having dealt with a supreme-peak level ancient beast, obtained a massive fruit, a treasure guarded by the beast for countless epochs.

He crushed the fruit, letting the power of destruction envelop him, gaining even more strength.

"Frolasa, ancient creature, interesting!"

Then, he took out a jade slip and transmitted a message, "Zhen Ling, I'm returning to the Four Great Secret Realms!"

His true self wanted to personally test it out.

The battle just now wasn't satisfying enough for his avatar.

Having traversed this time and space river for thousands of years, it held no interest for him.

The ancient beast he just killed was already the strongest being in this time and space river, yet it felt weaker than the Azure Dragon Temple Master.

He had clashed with the Masters of the Four Temples.

Now, with Frolasa's appearance, it rekindled his vast power of Destruction, perhaps aiding him in breaking through.

In the Earth Realm, in the Western Sea, and within.

Jian Wushuang had led his people to the edge of the battlefield. Strangely, the area was spacious, yet the corpses dared not approach.

"What's going on?" Elder Zhi Shan looked at Jian Wushuang with confusion.

Clearly, he felt that Jian Wushuang knew.

Jian Wushuang shook his head and said, "We've been manipulated!"

"By Bai Junwang?"

Even at this moment, Elder Zhi Shan didn't dare to say they were manipulated by Shen Ling.

The brainwashing is too severe.

"Yes, it's him. He schemed against us!" Jian Wushuang mocked in his heart but nodded on the surface.

Only this way could he continue to have Elder Zhi Shan listen to him.

He dared not speak a single bad word about Shen Ling, otherwise, if the Universe Master didn't kill him, the Elder Zhi Shan would.

Elder Zhi Shan was full of anger, cursing Bai Junwang.

Whew!

Jian Wushuang turned to look at the battlefield, feeling uneasy. The feeling of being manipulated by someone was unpleasant.

He still remembered the gaze Bai Junwang pleaded with him, now completely fallen.

"Zhi Shan, since Bai Junwang has betrayed us, you should join me. The tasks assigned by Lord Shen Ling must be continued!" Jian Wushuang also started coaxing Elder Zhi Shan to become his pawn.

There was no choice; in this place, he needed every tier 6 Emperor as his backer, or he would be helpless.

The battlefield was in chaos, and it was impossible to leave.

Elder Zhi Shan contemplated for a moment and said, "Young Master, rest assured. Lord Shen Ling has instructed that, no matter what happens, we must obey Young Master and Bai Junwang's orders. Now that Bai Junwang has betrayed, I will naturally follow you, Young Master."

"Good!" Jian Wushuang's eyes lit up and continued, "You can rest assured. I came here seeking some treasures for Lord Shen Ling. Apart from those, all other treasures will be owned by you, Elder Zhi Shan."

After taking control of Zhi Shan, Jian Wushuang breathed a sigh of relief. Now, he had a top-notch tier 6 Emperor by his side. The few remaining tier 5 peak-level Emperors who were still alive were useless; they could only be used as human shields.

The most crucial thing now was how to leave or enter the depths of this ruin.

Boom!

A burst of light flashed and appeared ahead.

Jian Wushuang paused for a moment, hesitating.

The place was so quiet that even the corpses dared not invade. He couldn't decide whether to go in or not.

While he hesitated, Zhen Wuyang and the others had already escaped from the battlefield and rushed towards the depths of the light without any hesitation.

With determination, Jian Wushuang led his followers up.

At this point, he wasn't afraid of these people, just afraid of not having someone alive by his side.

Worst case scenario, he'd reveal his identity. With Bai Junwang fallen, he could completely clear his name.

Following Zhen Wuyang, he returned to Grave God Mountain openly and in the light.

"Let's go!"

With Elder Zhi Shan and several cloak-clad Emperors, they followed behind Zhen Wuyang.

Behind them were also Gui Ling and others.

Meanwhile, on the battlefield, an even more powerful force erupted. It seemed that Shang clashed with the Universe Master.

Considering Shang's strength, even using cosmic secret techniques, he was by no means a match, at most delaying for a while.

Although Jian Wushuang didn't know much, he understood the significance of the Universe Master.

It was a dazzling existence even in ancient times, something an Emperor couldn't contend with.

Now, almost all surviving cultivators had left the battlefield, rushing towards the silent mountain range.

Silent Ridge.

The source of the radiance.

Zhen Wuyang and others had long arrived at this place.

Seeing these people stand still without any movement, Jian Wushuang was puzzled. This wasn't Zhen Wuyang's style!

Normally, when these people encountered opportunities, they would have already rushed forward; they couldn't possibly be this calm!

Jian Wushuang didn't dare approach, fearing potential danger.

Gazing at the radiance, Jian Wushuang made out two figures.

A man and a woman!

It was Hu Qing and Jiang Shang.

"Why is he here?!" Jian Wushuang exclaimed, surprised. There were no signs of these two when he arrived!

How did they appear?

Could it be that Zhen Ling opened a back door and let them in?

It's not entirely impossible; there have been precedents in the Original Planet, where inheritances were bestowed in front of many trial-takers.

If they could open a small opening and let Hu Qing in, it shouldn't be difficult!

Indeed, the chosen ones were different.

If it weren't for Bai Junwang back then, he wouldn't have been inferior to Hu Qing.

He then looked at himself now... Such a sorry state.

He couldn't even claim to be an Inheritor; he was played by Shen Ling, first refining the Origin Source for Bai Junwang, then running here eagerly, and ultimately becoming someone else's stepping stone.

He resurrected an ancient being, and Bai Junwang also perished.

What a mess! F0lloww new ùíÑhapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Both supremely intelligent individuals, ultimately played by someone elusive.

If he hadn't run fast, he might have been taken as well.

The fact that the other party could quietly kill Bai Junwang and seize the Origin Source probably meant they also knew about him.

The limitless Power of All Things within him!

It was like a moving treasure trove.

"That bald monk inside seems to be Merging the Dao!" Elder Zhi Shan observed for a while, realizing that things were peculiar. He continued, "How could there be an insect like a Dao Lord in this place, and he's even integrating the Dao!"

Jian Wushuang felt uncomfortable hearing this, but he couldn't say much.

But the mention of Merging Dao was particularly grating; even Hu Qing had merged Dao.

That little novice who once clung to him also merged the Dao.

However, it wasn't too surprising. Back then, stepping into the Dao, and now reaching the perfection-stage, it was only natural to Merge Dao.

If successful, he would become the Ultimate Emperor. Moreover, a tier 5 Ultimate Emperor in one step.

His combat power was probably not weaker than a six-stage Emperor.
