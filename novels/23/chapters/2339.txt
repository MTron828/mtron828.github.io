Chapter 2340: Defeat!

Jian Wushuang’s improvement in the aspect of Spacetime had been rapid. However, his understanding of Reincarnation Rules of Order in his previous life was even greater.

Moreover, he had been through the reincarnation passage and been reincarnated. This had let him experience the mystery of Reincarnation and was of unbelievable great help in his understanding of the Reincarnation Rules of Order. As a result, his grasp of the Reincarnation Rules of Order was the greatest it had ever been!!! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

His application of Reincarnation Power was several times stronger than in his previous life.

In the aspect of Sword Principle, he had created the first move of Reincarnation Sword Principle, the Samsara.

At nineteen years old, he had created the second move.

The second move was none other than the False Reincarnation Cleave!

This was a Sword Principle that infused the Reincarnation Power.

This move wasn’t just strong. The more important thing was the illusion within the Sword Principle. The Sword Principle was the sword shadow that the blue-haired lady had seen previously. She had thought she could block that sword shadow with her long spear and she could have succeeded. However, unbeknownst to her, it was just an illusory shadow.

The real strike was hidden before the illusion. A completely invisible strike!

It was that strike that had killed the blue-haired lady.

This blue-haired lady was the second Chaotic Divine Demon that Jian Wushuang had killed in this battle.

This time, he had done so when he was going up against three Chaotic Divine Demons at the same time!

“How can this be possible?”

“This... This...”

Xiang Zong and the burly old man were shocked.

They had seen with their own eyes how Jian Wushuang had killed the blue-haired lady and yet there was nothing they could do.

Now, after killing the blue-haired lady, Jian Wushuang’s cold gaze locked down on them.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang struck once again. This time, his target was the burly old man.

Weng!

A brilliant sword light illuminated the area.

That brilliant sword light was mesmerizing and intoxicating.

When he swung out that strike, even the void space was affected as ripples reverberated through.

The surrounding space-time seemed to have come to a halt at that moment.

Spacetime Sword Principle, Snow Cleave!

Arghhhh!!!

The burly old man exploded with rage and punched relentlessly.

However, the sword light that Jian Wushuang had released was exceptionally strange. It flashed past his fist and landed on his holy body directly.

The burly old man was strong in offense and incredible with his holy body. However, after taking this strike, he spewed a large mouthful of blood and his complexion paled instantly. Fortunately, he wasn’t killed directly by Jian Wushuang.

“Retreat! Retreat now!!”

Xiang Zong shouted in a hurry.

The burly old man wasn’t silly. In the first instant, he retreated frantically and opened up a distance from Jian Wushuang.

Moreover, he quickly met up with Xiang Zong. Both of them had fixed their eyes on Jian Wushuang from a long distance away.

“He... He...” the burly old man was at a loss for words.

Moments ago, he had killed that blue-haired lady with a single swing. Now, he was injured in a single strike?

How strong was he?

“He’s too strong? Perhaps his battle prowess has not reached the level of a Second Grade Divine Demon. His Sword Principle is even more frightening than any Second Grade Divine Demon I’ve seen,” Xiang Zong commented.

Both of them were shocked and wouldn’t dare to make a move on Jian Wushuang again.

As for Jian Wushuang, he stared daggers at them. The next moment, he charged into the battle beside him.

The battle between the Half Step Divine Demons and Chaotic Realm experts was reaching a critical stage.

Lin Mansion was clearly at an absolute disadvantage. One could even say they were doomed for destruction.

Each Lin Mansion’s expert had to face two or three experts of similar level at the same time. For example, Jian Wushuang’s father had to face two Half Step Divine Demons.

Looking at the situation, defeat seemed to be set in stone.

However, Jian Wushuang had appeared now.

First, he appeared above Zhuo Yunfeng and a blinding sword light illuminated the area. The Half Step Divine Demons that were engaged in an intense battle with Zhuo Yunfeng couldn’t escape in time before the blinding light penetrated their bodies and killed them.

Immediately after, Jian Wushuang vanished.

Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu!

Sword lights were appearing across several battles in the Lin Mansion.

Jian Wushuang’s movement was extremely unique. Each time he vanished and reappeared, a sword light shot out.

No one could stop the sword light.

Regardless if it was Chaotic Realm experts or Half Step Divine Demons, no one could take a strike from Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was killing an expert with each swing.

After several dozen cycles of vanishing and reappearing, he swung out several dozen strikes and killed several dozen experts from Zhuge Family and Xiang Family.

All of this happened in several instances and took no longer than a single breath of time.

Within a single breath of time, he killed several dozen experts. If this carried on....

“Retreat!

“Everyone from the Xiang Family, retreat immediately!!!”

Xiang Zong gave his orders instantly. His face was flushed as he shouted to rush the experts from Xiang Family.

At the same time, he was filled with fear.

“Monster! This brat is definitely a monster!!!”

“He isn’t a simple monster and not just a God of Death. The speed he is killing at is too fast. In several moments, several dozens of experts have fallen. My Xiang Zong accounted for one-third of the casualties. If we allow him to carry on slaughtering, our Xiang Family will definitely be annihilated by them. Even we might not survive.” The burly old man was shocked.

If this was the case for the mighty Chaotic Divine Demon, the Half Step Divine Demons and Chaotic Realm experts were probably scared out of wits.

When they heard the orders from Xiang Zong, those in the Xiang Family chose to escape without hesitation.

All of them were retreating rapidly, fearing they would be targeted by the God of Death.

The Xiang Family retreated from the battle under the leadership of Xiang Zong and the burly old man. This left the remaining Zhuge Family completely flustered.

“Damn it! Damn it!!!”

Zhuge Yuanchong roared furiously and couldn’t vent the endless anger that was within him.

However, as the leader of a family and a Divine Demon Realm expert, he knew what the most important thing was at that time.

With Xiang Family evacuating, Zhuge Family could still have an advantage in the number of Half Step Divine Demons and Chaotic Realm experts. However, as Jian Wushuang continued his indiscriminate slaughtering, this advantage was being chipped away. If they continued like this, Zhuge Yuanchong was certain that the doomsday of the Zhuge Family would arrive soon.

“Evacuate! Evacuate now!!”

Zhuge Yuanchong swung his hand and retreated through the air outside of Lin Mansion.

The remaining experts from the Zhuge Family and those few from Dongzuo Sect didn’t hesitate.

In just moments, numerous experts that had fought their way into Lin Mansion had been erased cleanly, leaving just their corpses behind.
