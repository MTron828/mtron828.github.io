Chapter 719: Pure Soul Aura

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

While the outside world was being turned upside down because of Jian Wushuang’s “death,” there was also something happening at the inner layer of the Eternal Zone.

There were a total of ten tribes in the Demon God Clan and there were over 10 thousand people in each of the tribes. The tribes lived together in a friendly manner and almost never battled amongst themselves.

There were numerous houses, built completely out of stone, on the endless mountains in Eighth Tribe.

Even the gate was made of stone.

Gu Yang, who carried a longbow, stepped into Eighth Tribe with Jian Wushuang on his back.

“Brother Gu Yang, are you back from hunting?”

“Gu Yang, who is the man on your back?”

All the clansmen in the tribe were very curious.

“Father, who are you carrying?” A young man with a burly figure walked up to Gu Yang.

“This clansman is seriously injured. Go get Elder Ying,” said Gu Yang.

“OK.” The young man nodded and then immediately went to look for Elder Ying.

Gu Yang took Jian Wushuang to a stone house and placed him on the stone bed that was inside. A short while later, the young man came in with a woman who had a weathered face and a dragonhead crutch.

“Elder Ying,” Gu Yang spoke humbly.

“Mmm,” Elder Ying replied. Then she walked to the bed and looked at Jian Wushuang with a slightly cloudy gaze.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang’s consciousness had already slipped into a coma.

“This kid…” Elder Ying stared at Jian Wushuang, then her eyes slightly narrowed before suddenly opening wide as a bright light flashed through her eyes.

“Elder Ying, what’s wrong?” Gu Yang asked in confusion.

“The kid has very pure soul aura,” she said.

“His soul aura is very pure?” Gu Yang’s face changed as he stared at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“Soul aura is the essence of our clansmen. The purer the soul aura is, the stronger his bloodline is. Besides, with such a pure soul aura, his bloodline is definitely comparable to the tenth generation or maybe even higher.” Elder Ying was amazed, but there was also a look of pleasant surprise on her face.

“What? The tenth generation?” Gu Yang could not help being surprised.

Their population was the Ancient God Clan!

As for the ‘Demon God Clan,’ it was what the experts from the Firmament Territory called them.

Their ancestor was the Ancient God, someone with enough power to destroy a whole world. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

They all had the bloodline of the Ancient God, but after their ancestor disappeared, his bloodline became thinner and thinner as it passed down from generation to generation. They had lived in the Eternal Zone for numerous years, but the bloodline had been passed down for hundreds of generations and the number of clansmen had reached a million. However, the bloodline of the Ancient Gods continued to grow thinner.

As of now, in their Ancient God Clan, after baptism, nine out of ten clansmen could only become a copper-armored Ancient God, and some, even after the baptism, could not awaken their bloodline to become an Ancient God at all.

Only a very small number of people could awaken the Silver-armored Ancient God’s bloodline.

Gold-armored Ancient Gods were even rarer. There were only about twenty Gold-armored Ancient Gods among the 10 thousand people in the tribe.

This was because the bloodline of the Ancient Gods was getting thinner and thinner.

Just as Elder Ying said, the Ancient God bloodline that was possessed by the clansmen of the tenth generation was extremely thick. However, there were few people who were within ten generations among the Ancient God Clan in the Eternal Zone.

“With such a pure soul aura and such a thick bloodline, there’ll be no problem for this kid to become a Silver-armored Ancient God after baptism, he even has a good chance of becoming a Gold-armored Ancient God,” said Elder Ying.

“Gold-armored Ancient God?” Gu Yang was moved.

There were under twenty Gold-armored Ancient Gods in the whole tribe and each one of them was very old and highly respected.

The birth of every Gold-armored Ancient God was a source of great joy for the entire Ancient God Clan.

“Where did you meet this kid? Which tribe is he from?” asked Elder Ying.

“I don’t know which tribe he is from. I only know that he is called Jian Wushuang. When I was hunting outside, I happened to meet him while he was being chased by an outsider. I saved him and brought him back with me,” said Gu Yang.

“Jian Wushuang?” Elder Ying frowned. “Our Ancient God Clan mostly use the ancient surnames. Although some of us use other surnames, there are very few. Besides, I have never heard of anyone who once used Jian as their surname.”

“However, no matter which tribe he comes from, since he has such pure soul aura, he must be a clansman of our Ancient God Clan. It’s impossible for that to be wrong.”

“Gu Yang, go outside and leave this kid to me,” said Elder Ying.

“Aye.” Gu Yang nodded and gave Jian Wushuang one more glance before leaving.

Only Jian Wushuang and Elder Ying were left in the stone house now.

Elder Ying sat down beside the stone bed and stretched out her arm. Upon closer inspection, a bulge could be seen moving slowly. A moment later, an extremely ferocious-looking bug with countless tentacles climbed out of her arm.

“Jiu, heal the kid and give him a drop of the Essence Blood you’ve stored,” Elder Ying opened her mouth.

Hearing this, the ferocious bug on her arm stared up at Elder Ying with an obvious look of astonishment.

Essence Blood had great effects and it could only save one drop every 10,000 years, so it was very precious. Normally, it wouldn’t give it to anyone, but Elder Ying had asked it to give one drop to Jian Wushuang.

Although it was surprised, it obeyed Elder Ying. It quickly climbed onto Jian Wushuang’s arm and spat out a drop of Essence Blood.

The moment this drop of blood entered Jian Wushuang’s body, his body couldn’t help absorbing it.

After it was absorbed, the wounds in his body began to recover at an alarming speed. Even Jian Wushuang’s arm that had been cut by the black-robed elder, An Chao, began to repair itself at this moment.

It was very clear that this drop of Essence Blood was so effective that it might even be able to save someone who was at death’s door.

What’s more, Jian Wushuang’s vitality soared once he finished completely absorbing this drop of Essence Blood.

If the life of a Skyscraping Realm cultivator was 10,000 years, then the current Jian Wushuang could live for more than 50,000 years.

After another moment, Jian Wushuang’s broken arm had been completely restored, and the majority of the injuries to his body had also been cured, but the Essence Blood could not completely restore his exhausted Spiritual Power.

On the stone bed, Jian Wushuang’s consciousness began to come back and his eyes slowly opened.

The moment he opened his eyes, he saw Elder Ying next to the bed.

“Kid, are you awake?”

Elder Ying was looking at him softly.
