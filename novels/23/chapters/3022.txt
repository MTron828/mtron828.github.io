Chapter 3023: Magic Note King

——

The black-robed middle-aged man who suddenly appeared in the void looked at Jian Wushuang calmly with a cold expression.

Although he did not speak or show any signs of wanting to attack, just standing there still gave Jian Wushuang great pressure.

“Such great pressure. If I’m not mistaken, he must be the king of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

He knew very well that in the entire Magic Note Divine Kingdom, only the king of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom could give him such great pressure.

“I didn’t expect that the great king of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom would personally come here.” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly. In his opinion, although he had caused a great disturbance in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, the king of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom would personally ask about it.

However, he would only ask about it. He would not personally come out or make a move.

But now, the king of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom had come out personally.

Jian Wushuang did not know that the king of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom did not intend to make a move. However, although he did not make a move, he could see what had happened through the dragon-imprisoning compass. When he saw the battle between Jian Wushuang and Gold King…he was already shocked when he defeated Gold King.

Then, when he saw Jian Wushuang slaughter 16 True Saints in an instant while being surrounded by experts from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, the Magic note King could not sit still.

The dragon-trapping compass was a treasure he refined. He directly controlled the dragon-trapping compass to open a space passage so that his original body could arrive here as soon as possible.

After a long silence, the black-robed middle-aged man in the void, the Magic Note King, finally spoke, “Tell me your name!”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis?” The Magic Note King’s expression changed slightly, but he clearly did not remember this name, “You were able to defeat Gold King as a rank one True Saint and even left dozens of True Saint experts in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom helpless. You are definitely not an unknown person. If I’m not wrong, you must be from the Three Palaces of Heaven-cleaving Alliance, and not the Heaven and Earth Palace. You are most likely from the Primal Palace.”

“Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces?” Many experts from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom were stunned.

They were all experts above the Immortal Saint Realm and knew of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. At the same time, there were also people who had heard of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces.

They knew that it was where many geniuses of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces cultivated.

Now that they heard what the Magic Note King said, these experts immediately understood.

“That’s right, it must be the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. Only those genius monsters in the three palaces have such terrifying strength!”

“A rank one True Saint has the battle strength of a peak rank three True Saint. Only the Three Palaces of Heaven-cleaving have such a monster.”

“The level of the Heaven and Earth Palace is the lowest in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. The skills displayed by this person have indeed exceeded the level of the geniuses of the Heaven and Earth Palace.”

The experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom began to discuss.

They all thought that Jian Wushuang came from the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, and it was very likely that he came from the Primal Palace.

After all, there were strong and weak geniuses.

The geniuses of the Heaven and Earth Palace could also cross ranks to challenge others, but it was not too outrageous.

For example, Jian Wushuang had met three geniuses of the Heaven-and-Earth Palace, Qian Chen, Long Yun, and Xue Yu.

Among the three, Qian Chen had fought with him face to face.

Qian Chen was clearly a Peak False Saint, and he had just broken through, but his battle strength was enough to rival a rank two True Saint.

Although Long Yun had never fought with Xue Yu, he had heard from Long Yun that Xue Yu was only a rank one True Saint, but his battle strength was enough to rival a rank three True Saint.

It could be said that the geniuses of the Heaven and Earth Palace could challenge those of a higher rank.

A rank one True Saint like Xue Yu who could rival a rank three True Saint was considered a powerful figure in the Heaven and Earth Palace. Jian Wushuang was also only a rank one True Saint, but the strength he displayed now…was already comparable to a peak third-level True Saint. Obviously, he was much more powerful than Xue Yu.

Naturally, the experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom all thought that Jian Wushuang was at least a genius from the Primal Palace.

Hearing their words, Jian Wushuang felt a little amused.

“I’m not from the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“How is that possible? The Heaven-cleaving Alliance should have found out about such a peerless genius like you long ago, and they must have sent an invitation to you,” the Magic Note King said.

“Yes, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance did send me an invitation to join the three palaces. They invited me twice, but unfortunately, I rejected both times,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“Rejected?” The Magic Note King was stunned. “You rejected the invitation of the three palaces?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The Magic Note King was a little surprised.

He had heard about the authority of the genius disciples of the three palaces.

It was a place that countless geniuses in the Divine Beginning World yearned for. Many geniuses at the monster level would fight to enter the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, but this Heavenly Sword Marquis had received an invitation, but he had rejected it?

“Magic Note King, whether I am a disciple of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces has nothing to do with you, right?” Jian Wushuang asked in a clear voice.

“Of course it does.”

Magic Note King’s voice became cold again, “If you were a disciple of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, I might not dare to kill you because of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. I would at most give you a punishment. But now that I have asked you and you have denied that you are a disciple of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, and I have recorded all of this with the mirror token, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance will have nothing to say even if I kill you now.”

“Even if you really are a disciple of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, as long as you have denied it, I can kill you.”

“So that’s the reason?” Jian Wushuang understood, but then he smiled and said, “Magic Note King, aren’t you a little troublesome? As the king of the Divine Kingdom, if you want to kill me, just kill me. Do you have to worry so much?”

Jian Wushuang’s words were obviously sarcastic, but the Magic Note King was not angry at all.

What a joke. Heavenly Sword Marquis was obviously from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and was so talented. It was reasonable for him to have some misgivings. Even if it spread, no one would laugh at him. On the contrary, if he knew that Jian Wushuang was so talented…if he did not have any misgivings, people would laugh at him and say that he was stupid.

It had been many years since the founding of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, and he had experienced countless hardships. However, he was able to survive, and the Magic Note Divine Kingdom was able to survive, in addition to his own tyrannical strength, the most important thing was that he knew what to do and who not to provoke.

If Jian Wushuang was really a disciple of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, he would never dare to kill him. But now, he had nothing to worry about.
