1922 Fought And Never Regret!

Nowhere to run!

Yes, the darkness prison had formed and the entire spacetime was frozen. Jian Wushuang had nowhere to run.

“There’s no way to escape?” Jian Wushuang looked at the darkness prison in front of him. He could feel the power of the darkness prison.

With his power alone, it would have been impossible if he wanted to break the darkness prison to flee.

The surrounding experts from Lineage of Star and the other two alliances looked at Jian Wushuang.

“He is doomed!”

“A Great Emperor descended personally and it is really extraordinary. Jian Wushuang can’t escape!”

“Although Jian Wushuang’s power and talent is admirable, he is dealing with a Great Emperor after all. That’s it for him.”

“It’s a pity. He’s such a genius.”

The experts were sighing emotionally.

They could tell that Jian Wushuang was in a hopeless situation.

His outcome was definitely death.

There was almost no possibility that he could stay alive.

Even the experts from Lineage of Star, who were on the same side as Jian Wushuang, felt hopeless for his situation too.

But, just then… Hong!!!

There was a sudden war intention that suddenly soared.

Such war intention brought about boundless unyieldingness!!

“What?”

The experts on the spot turned to look at the source of the war intention in shock.

“It’s Jian Wushuang!!” Everyone stared.

Before their gaze, Jian Wushuang’s face was distorted and he looked ferocious.

In his eyes, there was unprecedented madness.

There was billowing war intention with boundless unyieldingness that swept out from his body.

“As I can’t run away, let’s fight a life-and-death battle!!!”

Jian Wushuang roared in anger and his roar reverberated in the air. Heaven and earth quivered.

“Fight!””Fight!””Fight!”

In every direction, including in all the experts’ heads, there were roars that resounded.

It never faded away.

Everyone at the spot, including heaven and earth could feel Jian Wushuang’s unyieldingness.

That’s Jian Wushuang!

He was unyielding in character, just like a huge rock. No matter how brutal the storm, he wouldn’t move an inch.

Even though he was cornered in a hopeless situation, he would never admit defeat, he would never lower his head, nor would he feel hopeless.

Since birth until then, over the years, he had never known the word ‘hopeless’.

“Even if the universe won’t tolerate it and the sky abandons me!”

“Even if my body were to be exterminated and vanish into thin air!”

“I, Jian Wushuang, swear to fight a life-and-death battle!”

“Fight and never regret!”

Hong!!

The universe moved.

His soaring war intention shot to the highest heaven. Jian Wushuang stood erect in the dark void while Blood Mountain Sword in his hands whistled and shrilled.

Such unyieldingness was enough to shock the world!

In the surrounding dark void, a large number of experts revealed shocked expressions. Everyone looked at Jian Wushuang with a complicated expression.

No one expected that Jian Wushuang, who had reached the end of the road, who had reached a hopeless situation, would want to fight against sky and earth, against all living things in the universe!

“Jian Wushuang, although Soaring Heaven King Palace and you shared deep-seated resentment, I, Tian Ling, am in awe of you,” Emperor God Tian Ling looked at Jian Wushuang with a tinge of admiration as he stood in the void.

Although the other experts viewed Jian Wushuang as their enemy and many wanted to eat his flesh and drink his blood, they couldn’t help but revere him.

From the bottom of their hearts, they determined that Jian Wushuang was a true expert.

He was a super expert with indomitable spirit who never lowered his head.

Then, the expert was going to fight the last battle of his life.

Bang!

There was a terrifying bang. Then, a flowing light burst out. It was Jian Yi.

The ten breaths had ended and Jian Yi had tried his best to hold back Abysmal Saint Master.

But then, he had reached his limit.

Abysmal Saint Master had finally freed himself.

“Jian Wushuang, you have great willpower. At such a moment, you are still unwilling to lower your head. One should know that if you were to kneel down and kowtow or beg for mercy, I might let you off the hook,”Abysmal Saint Master scoffed.

Jian Wushuang never speak but he slowly took steps forward in the void.

The first step he took, bang!

In-between his eyebrows, the first ancient tribe star broke.

Then, another step… Bang! Bang!

The second and the third ancient tribe stars broke at the same time.

The third step… Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Seven ancient tribe stars broke simultaneously.

Seven star broke altogether. Besides the Secret Skill of Star Palace, it was the last trump card that Jian Wushuang could use.

Boundless ancient tribe bloodline power concentrated all over his body. As Jian Wushuang suddenly lifted his head, his bloodshot eyes were like two crimson streaks of lightning that burst out at Abysmal Saint Master before him.

At the same time, in the dark void, there was a beautiful world of mountains and rivers that appeared from nowhere.

Mountain River Map then spread out again.

“Rolling mountains and rivers, segregated into nine-province!”

“Mountain river as palm and nine-province as seal, found the country with rivers and mountains!”

“Nine-province fourth seal, Yan Province as the seal… Turn up the Cloud!”

As Jian Wushuang broke seven stars and the power of ancient tribe bloodline was drawn into Mountain River Map.

From the world of mountains and rivers, a lofty continent descended from the air.

Nine-provice, the fourth seal!

It was the strongest move that Jian Wushuang could perform using his power of seven stars and all of the fighting power that he could bring to play.

It was also his last move.

After that move, either his opponent died or he would!!!

Rumble. A lofty continent pressed down.

In an instant, all living in the universe quivered in fear.

The experts from the universe couldn’t help but lifted their heads. Their eyes were filled with unprecedented fear.

They felt the power contained in the lofty continent from above.

The power also exceeded the range of an Emperor God and it had reached the level of a Great Emperor God.

It was absolutely evenly matched to the strongest hit by a Great Emperor.

But what they never expected was that, in such a hopeless situation, even Jian Wushuang, who had performed a stroke with the Secret Skill of Star Palace which had exterminated over a hundred Almighties from Almighties Alliance, should have played all his trump cards.

He was already at this state but he… He still could perform such a terrifying hit that could match with a Great Emperor.

He still had the power to go all-out!

“Just how many trump cards does Jian Wushuang have? He’s like a blackhole!”

“Earlier, he killed the entire Almighties Alliance with one stroke. Now, he can perform such a terrifying hit?”

“Monster, Jian Wushuang is really a monster!”

“It’d be best if Jian Wushuang died in this fight. If he doesn’t, I can’t imagine just how scary he will become in the future!” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Everyone was terrified. They were shocked!!!
