“By choosing to be a Reincarnator, one embarks on a perilous path where only the victors triumph and the defeated rot into oblivion; a terribly treacherous path from which there is no returning from.”.”

“Once selected by the Samsara Temple, the candidates will have to take part in a series of tests. After which, the ones qualified will become Rank One Reincarnators. They will then be entered into contests of life and death where only the fittest and strongest survive. And once in a certain period of time, the Samsara Temple will continually vet the competence of the Reincarnators with another series of grueling trials which participation is mandatory.”

“A Rank One Reincarnator, for instance, would be expected to have his or her competence re-examined once every decade. He or she will be promoted into Rank Two if he or she passes the test. In the case of failure during the test, but he or she manages to survive, the Reincarnator will be expected to undergo another test after another decade. Nevertheless, a Reincarnator will be mercilessly executed if he or she fails to qualify in three consecutive tries. There will be no quarter spared.” Emperor Xiao said.

“An execution if one fails to qualify in three consecutive tries?”?Jian Wushuang grimaced at the terrible tale of the Samsara Temple.

“It would have been very much pleasant if the Reincarnators were allowed to choose on whether they agree to a test. Yet, these tests are imperative to the Reincarnators every decade without being accorded the privilege of choice. By crook or by hook, a Rank One Reincarnator will have to qualify to become Rank Two in three attempts lest he or she will be ruthlessly executed.”

“Such is the cruel and torturous path of becoming a Reincarnator.”

“The tests may be easy and manageable for most Reincarnators to rise up to Rank Two, or even Three. Yet, the challenges of qualification increase many times over as one climbs up to higher Ranks. The very same conundrum remains: all Reincarnators have to pass within the stipulated time frame lest they have to pay with their own lives!”

“It is only after reaching Rank Six, that a Reincarnator is finally free of the being required to sit for examinations.” Emperor Xiao said.

“So everyone has to reach Rank Six within the specified time frame beside traversing the excruciating challenges of the tests… What a brutal way of life indeed….”?

Jian Wushuang thought quietly.

“It is more than that. In most cases, no even one candidate, from among ten thousand Reincarnators, would be able to achieve Rank Six in time.” Emperor Xiao said gravely.

“Almost none of the natives of the continent dare attempt the undertaking of becoming a Reincarnator henceforth, due to its bloody and violent history, save for a few who hailed from the Ancient World; a few ignorant and uninformed souls who knew nothing of the dangerous fates that await them.”

“The few souls indeed… like your father himself, who had also begun treading on this very same path as a Reincarnator!”

Jian Wushuang was shocked at this sudden revelation of his father.

He had begun to pick up the gist when Emperor Xiao began his tale of the grim fate of becoming a Reincarnator.

Years before, Di Jing was aghast by Jian Nantian’s decision to attempt such a risky endeavor. He had then revealed to Jian Wushuang about his father’s decision to set off on a journey so deadly and treacherous. With Emperor Xiao’s detailed elaboration, Jian Wushuang was now fully certain.

Indeed.

His father had chosen a most horrible path that only a handful in the entire Green Fire World would dare walk.

The life of a Reincarnator of the Samsara Temple was indeed a phylogenetic struggle where only the strongest survived.

“Most of the great warriors of the Green Fire World have heard of the tales of the Reincarnators of the Samsara Temple. I am sure that your father knew the risks that he undertook, Jian Wushuang. The Samsara Temple must have been forthcoming about these conditions when they offered a place to your father and he had willingly obliged.” Emperor Xiao muttered under a light breath.

Jian Wushuang could not help but grow tense and anxious as the words his father said to him before he left returned to him once more.

“No matter how dangerous this path may be,”

“No matter how this road may even by my last,”

“No doubt or fear may dissuade me from seeing her, even if it’s only for one moment.”

“Father chose this road although he knew that it was full of dangers which could even lead to his death.”?

Jian Wushuang clasped his hands tightly as his eyes glinted, mirroring the brimming emotions trying to pour out.

There was but only one reason behind his father’s decision for such an undertaking.

“It was all for Mother, is it not, Father?” Jian Wushuang murmured quietly.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath, the strong and violent undulations of his heart simmering down. He looked at Emperor Xiao once again and said, “Do you have any way that I can locate my father, Uncle Xiao?”

“Even amongst the members of the Samsara Temple, information about the Reincarnators is closely guarded with intense fervor and zeal. There is but only one way: you will have to travel to the Samsara Continent yourself. Seek out a Golden-clothed Deacon or other members of higher position within the Samsara Temple. With the help of one such individual, you should be able to locate your father’s whereabouts.” Emperor Xiao explained.

“A Golden-clothed Deacon?” Jian Wushuang repeated, his face flushed with hope.

“Gold-clothed Deacons of the Samsara Temple are commonly Rank Seven Reincarnators; ones who are equal to one of the strongest Rank Two Dao Masters or a Rank Three Master. Even upon the vast sward of the Samsara Continent, such powers are hard to come by. With superior authority and power, they are generally informed about the information of Reincarnators below Rank Seven.” Emperor Xiao said.

“Below Rank Seven? What about the information of Reincarnators above Rank Seven?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“It is least likely that your father is above Rank Seven. He has only been a Reincarnator for less than two millennia, being Rank Six at best if he had passed all tests with hardly any mishaps. Most Rank Six Reincarnators wield the destructive powers of a Dao Master, being a potent force in their own right…” Emperor Xiao shook his head.

By his calculations, Jian Nantian would, at most, have achieved Rank Six in the span of two millennia, which in itself was already a remarkable feat. It was simply implausible that he had reached Rank Seven.

Not everyone could hope to possess the extraordinary talents of Jian Wushuang after all.

Despite possessing ample talents of his own, Emperor Xiao felt that Jian Nantian was still far behind in potential than his own son, Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang nodded as he swallowed Emperor Xiao’s word with reluctance, keeping reservations on his own.

“It seems like you do indeed intend on going to the Samsara Continent yourself, Jian Wushuang?” Emperor Xiao looked inquisitively at him.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang replied heavily.

For two millennia, Jian Wushuang had been separated from his father, without any news from him as to whether he still lives.

It was a pity that his father had not been present to witness his marriage with Leng Rushuang.

But now that he has an inkling as to where he might be, Jian Wushuang was resolved to seek out his father.

“How can I go to the Samsara Continent, Uncle Xiao?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I know not myself the way there, but you can ask your Senior Brother for help. There is a spatial wormhole inside the Void Temple that leads to the Samsara Continent.” Emperor Xiao said.

“I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“When will you be leaving, Jian Wushuang?” Emperor Xiao then asked.

“Right away!” Jian Wushuang answered, his hand balled into a fist as a show of his resolution.
