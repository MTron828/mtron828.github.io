In the imperial palace in Tang of the East. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The newly constructed imperial palace wasn’t as majestic as the one before but it was still impressive and vast.

However, ever since the experts of the three big countries attacked the imperial palace 1,000 years ago, it was completely encapsulated in an enormous formation.

The experts from the three big countries chose to stay outside of the palace, making it impossible for anyone to leave the palace for 1,000 years. Those who wanted to leave was either killed or had escaped back to the palace after fighting.

For 1,000 years, experts from Tang of the East hid like tortoise inside their shells, afraid to leave the formation. They lost all of their pride alongside the luck of their country. Their country had fallen to its lowest point from its prime in the Green Fire World.

The experts in Green Fire World all agreed that the destruction of Tang of the East was only a matter of time.

Palaces and buildings stood and hovered above the vast earth in front of the imperial palace. That was where the experts and Dao Masters of the three big countries stayed in for the past 1,000 years to monitor the palace. No movement in and out of the palace would go unnoticed.

Inside an intricately-designed building, four Dao Masters were having a drink.

Three of them were showering praises on a red-robed man with a devil-like face.

“Dao Master Gu Ji, War God Di Jing of Tang of the East would’ve killed me if not for you. I’ll never forget that you saved my life.”

“Di Jing appears to be Emperor Xiao’s earliest follower amongst the 10 War Gods. He’s indeed Emperor Xiao’s top commander with his strength at Rank Two. Out of everyone here, only Dao Master Gu Ji can defeat him.”

“Come, come. Cheers to Dao Master Gu Ji!”

The three of them raised their cups.

The red-robed man laughed coldly upon hearing their words and extended his arm. “Di Jing is nothing to me. It was pure luck that he even escaped last time. If I meet him again, I’ll definitely end him.”

“Of course, Di Jing is no match for you!” the three of them said in agreement.

To be fair, they were sure that Gu Ji wasn’t much stronger than Di Jing. In a face-to-face battle, Di Jing might have a chance of defeating him. It would be near impossible for Gu Ji to actually kill Di Jing.

“Everyone in Tang of the East is now hiding in the imperial palace like cowards. Emperor Xiao and Emperor Yun were severely injured since a long time ago and couldn’t even use 20 percent of their original strength. Within the entire imperial palace, Leng Rushuang is probably the only one stronger than Dao Master Gu Ji,” one of the Dao Masters said.

“Leng Rushuang?” Gu Ji sneered. “I’ve seen her before. She’s indeed the top beauty of the Eternal World with an unrivaled elegance. No wonder Jian Wushuang is smitten with her.”

“Jian Wushuang himself is an outstanding individual. If not for the fact that he died assassinating Dao Yuanzi, his achievements today will also be impressive.”

Gu Ji sneered. “A man, however strong, is useless when dead. He’s an idiot. Though he committed such an outstanding feat for Leng Rushuang, he still ended up with nothing.”

He was jealous of Jian Wushuang.

That was because he was a prodigy too. When he was in the Eternal Realm, his power shocked the entire Green Fire World. Even today, many still applauded his immense talent.

However, ever since the battle at the imperial palace that ended 1,200 years ago, Jian Wushuang became known as the top talent in the history of the Green Fire World after his battle results were announced. His talent far suppressed Gu Ji’s. It made Gu Ji very uncomfortable.

Moreover, he was also interested in Leng Rushuang. However, she had her eyes fixed on Jian Wushuang, which made him even more jealous.

Gu Ji suddenly stood up. “Let’s go play in the imperial palace.”

Delighted, the other three Dao Masters immediately followed him.

Soon, they arrived in front of the imperial palace.

Looking beyond the transparent formation, they could see the happenings of the imperial palace and the disillusioned experts in it.

Those experts could only hide in the formation for 1,000 years. That naturally made many of them disillusioned and depressed.

Gu Ji sneered and ordered the Dao Master next to him. “Let’s start.”

The Dao Master laughed and turned around…

“Cowards of Tang of the East!” A deep voice penetrated the formation and resounded at the top of the imperial palace. “Ha! The people of Tang of the East, the greatest nation, now hide cowardly within the imperial palace, afraid to leave! Haha…”

Many inside the palace heard his laughter.

They were all enraged.

However, they were more disappointed and depressed than infuriated.

They had heard such mockery and scolding countless times in the past 1,000 years and had long gotten used to them.

“Emperor Xiao, Emperor Yun! Aren’t you two Top Emperors? Why don’t you dare show yourselves now?”

“You two really amaze me! You cowards act like two tortoises instead of emperors. Ridiculous! Incredibly ridiculous! How about we call you tortoise instead of emperors? Tortoise Xiao and Tortoise Yun?”

“Ha! Two giant tortoises that lost all the face of Tang of the East. If I were the founding emperor Emperor of Tang, I’d be so enraged that I’d climb out of my coffin!”

Waves of laughter entered the formation one after another, resounding like thunder on top of the imperial palace.

Within the palace, top-tier experts of Tang of the East were infuriated. If not for Emperor Xiao’s command, they would have charged out to battle those bastards outside.

“I’ve been scolding for so long but no one from Tang of the East even showed up! Such cowards!” The laughter continued.

“Bastard! I can’t endure any further!”

Following a loud resounding roar, a figure leaped out of the imperial palace with vast overarching aura and a pair of crazy eyes. It was none other than Di Jing!
