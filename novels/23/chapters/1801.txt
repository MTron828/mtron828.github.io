Chapter 1802: Legend

Dao Yuanzi saw that Jian Wushuang remained aloof and he felt terrified. He quickly thought in his head.

Very soon, he spoke again, “Jian Wushuang, I know that you carry the Ancient God bloodline but Ancient Gods actually only possesses a very thin bloodline of ancient tribe. I carry blood essence of a true ancient tribe expert. Besides, I know that there is an ancient tribe expert’s dead body in the battlefield nearby. It contains the bloodline inheritance of an ancient tribe. I can bring you there.”

“Ancient tribe? Bloodline inheritance?” Jian Wushuang was curious, “Humph. What ancient tribe? I have never heard of it before. I think you just made this up and your goal is most likely for me to die at an extremely dangerous place. Do you think I’m stupid enough to listen to you?”

Jian Wushuang let his murderous intention run wild as he raised Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

“No! No!”

“I’m telling you the truth.”

Dao Yuanzi screamed his lungs out but Jian Wushuang didn’t care and slashed with his sword.

In the split moment of life and death, Dao Yuanzi suddenly roared, “Jian Wushuang, do you want your brother to come back to life!?”

Vroom!

The sword that already had slashed down suddenly stopped in the mid-air.

The blade was less than half a meter away from Dao Yuanzi’s head.

Jian Wushuang looked solemn as he stared at Dao Yuanzi. “What did you say just now?”

“Come back to life!” Dao Yuanzi continued, “You are furious because one of your brothers and the other two close relatives died, right? Yes, they died but they could come back to life. There’s a legend that says that on the peak of the universe, there’s a super existence on equal footing with Heaven Way, they could reverse spacetime and bring the dead cultivators back to life.”

“Legend?” Jian Wushuang’s gaze turned cold. “Are you fooling me?”

“No, I’m not fooling you. Back in my time, there was really this legend. If there’s a legend, there must really be such a super existence. How could such a super existence pass away so easily? This super existence might be in one of the corners in the battlefield but in a deep sleep, or in a unique condition. Such as Seven Star Black Sect. They are an example of a super sect. Among the top experts in this sect, there might be one who has already reached such a level.”

“An existence of such level is far too ancient. Even if you were to run into them, you might not know them. However, I’m different. Although I was a nonentity back during the war, I was in charge of gathering information. I know many super experts that were involved in the war and I can recognize them for you. Then, when you wander on the battlefield, it could save you a lot of trouble.”

“I know a lot of information about the war back then,” Dao Yuanzi continued.

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes after listening to Dao Yuanzi.

“King of Venomous Worms, what do you think?” Jian Wushuang asked for King of Venomous Worms’ opinion.

“Reverse spacetime? Bring dead experts back to life? Hehe, I have never heard of such a technique, this is most likely a lie. Even if it was true, the chances are slim,” King of Venomous Worms said. “However, there’s something Dao Yuanzi said that is right. He is an ancient expert and he is knowledgeable. Hence, he must know quite a bit of secret about ancient times.”

“As for experts from ancient times, he isn’t wrong either. The surrounding ancient battlefield is a great treasure. Such a huge treasure, you can’t just let it sit in vain. You definitely must wander around. With Dao Yuanzi around, he could save you some unnecessary trouble and danger.”

“Of course, only with the prerequisite that you could control him. If you can’t control him, it would be a disaster to you and to the entire Green Fire World.”

Jian Wushuang was deep in thought.

After a short while, Jian Wushuang made up his mind.

“Dao Yuanzi, do not resist,” Jian Wushuang swept out his soul power over Dao Yuanzi.

Dao Yuanzi wasn’t angry but thrilled. He naturally didn’t resist. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Very soon, Jian Wushuang left a soul stamp on Dao Yuanzi’s soul fire.

With the soul stamp, Jian Wushuang controlled Dao Yuanzi’s life and death.

“Greetings, Master,” Dao Yuanzi bowed politely at Jian Wushuang.

“Master, huh?” Jian Wushuang smirked coldly. Then, Blood Mountain Sword turned into a lofty mountain.

“Master, what do you mean?” Dao Yuanzi was shocked but he couldn’t resist. He was suppressed by the lofty mountain.

Jian Wushuang smiled coldly, “Dao Yuanzi thought I was stupid? He is an expert from ancient times. He could at least be a Great Emperor’s match, or even beyond. Such an expert is powerful. He didn’t have a choice so he yields to me for now. But once he recovers his power gradually, he might be able to remove the soul stamp. By then, forget about controlling him, my life might be in danger too.”

Jian Wushuang wasn’t sure if Dao Yuanzi had the power to remove his soul stamp but he didn’t dare to take the risk.

Hence, even if Dao Yuanzi yielded to him, he would continue to suppress him. Unless there was a day when he could remove Dao Yuanzi’s consciousness and soul control him.

Just like Lei Chao back then.

Lei Chao had been soul controlled and he was pretty much dead. He listened to the instructions of the controller completely.

Only then, Jian Wushuang would be at ease. At the same time, he would consider himself to have taken revenge for Yang Zaixuan, Emperor Tang and Emperor Xiao.

However, Dao Yuanzi was an ancient expert after all. His soul was extremely strong. It would be impossible if Jian Wushuang wanted to soul control him in a short time.

“Before I am able to soul control you, you’d better stay in Blood Mountain Sword. As for your power, humph, don’t even think about it,” Jian Wushuang sneered.

He definitely wouldn’t give Dao Yuanzi any chance to recover his power. Even if one day he were to be in danger, he would activate the soul stamp at the critical moment to kill Dao Yuanzi.

Phew. A cold breeze howled.

The entire universe went quiet.

After Jian Wushuang had suppressed Dao Yuanzi, he turned and walked to people from Green Fire Palace.

Everyone from Green Fire Palace was extremely excited.

Their excitement was not only because Devil Church had been destroyed completely, but also because of Jian Wushuang’s power.

Too strong. From everyone’s view, Jian Wushuang was too powerful!

Jian Wushuang was Green Fire Palace’s man and he was truly a mainstay of Green Fire World.

With the existence of such a superb expert, Green Fire World was lucky.
