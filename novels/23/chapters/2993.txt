Chapter 2994: Destroy

——

When Jian Wushuang looked at the experts of the four overlords, the experts of the four overlords also stared at him.

“Is he the expert of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance?” The burly bald man narrowed his eyes.

“He doesn’t look very impressive.” The black-robed, cold-looking young man said.

“His aura is indeed at the Divine Master level. How strange,” the red-robed girl said.

“The three of you, don’t underestimate him. His combat strength is far stronger than any of us,” the Island Master of Blood Blade Island said seriously.

“Don’t worry. We’re not stupid,” the red-robed girl said with a smile.

“Cut the crap. Let’s attack directly,” the burly bald man said in a low voice.

“Okay.”

The four of them communicated with each other and made up their minds.

“Kill!”

As the Master of Blood Blade Island shouted, the experts of the four overlords, including the four peak rank one True Saints, all attacked at the same time.

For a moment, a terrifying aura burst out one after another, pressing down on them from all directions.

The moment they attacked, Jian Wushuang also moved.

His eyes were cold, and his body turned into a stream of light as he dashed out. His eyes were unusually cold as he stared at the people in front of him.

“There are many experts from the four overlords. There are more than 20 Immortal Saints and four True Saints at the peak of rank one. With so many experts, as long as these four peak of rank one True Saints can hold me back, the others can directly kill me. Qin Dong’s subordinates won’t be able to resist for long. Once Qin Dong is killed, my mission will fail.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“I can’t give them a chance to fight. I have to use all my strength to defeat them. Even if I can’t kill them, I have to intimidate them so that they won’t dare to continue fighting!” Jian Wushuang thought quickly and made up his mind.

Boom!

A vast golden divine power surged wildly.

Jian Wushuang had already used the seven-star secret skill, the divine punishment skill, and the nine luminaries star armor. His battle strength immediately rose to the peak.

Then, he waved his hand.

“Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!”

Streams of cyan streamers formed by the Star Luo Swords rushed out. These cyan streamers shuttled rapidly in the void and then floated in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Condense!”

Jian Wushuang uttered a word, and the 18 Star Luo Swords immediately condensed together at the fastest speed.

In an instant…rumble…

An earth-shaking rumble sounded, and a huge spiral tunnel with the power of endless reincarnation rules appeared between heaven and earth.

This spiral tunnel was like the reincarnation tunnel that led to reincarnation. It was mysterious, vast, and unfathomable!

However, in this reincarnation tunnel, a brilliant green light was faintly discernible.

“Go!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold, and the faintly discernible green light in the reincarnation passage suddenly burst out.

The green light was extremely long and carried a huge green tail. It was dozens of meters long, but it was not large in size, but it was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, it had already appeared in front of the burly bald man who was the fastest.

“This sword formation!”

The burly bald man’s pupils constricted.

He was a True Saint at the peak of stage one. He had extraordinary knowledge and sharp senses. The moment Jian Wushuang’s reincarnation sword formation burst out, he had already sensed that the power of this sword formation was extraordinary.

The burly bald man did not dare to be careless. His body was instantly filled with an evil aura, and a huge ax appeared in his hand.

As he held the huge ax with both hands.

Hua!

The ax, which seemed to be able to split mountains and break mountains, suddenly descended.

The ax shadow reached the sky and collided with the green light.

Dang!

A low sound of collision rang out. The moment the huge ax in his hand came into contact with the green light, it has already struck.

“What?”

The expression of the burly bald man suddenly changed, and his gaze became extremely shocked.

He could feel the terrifying power contained within the green light. This power completely surpassed his, completely crushing him.

But one had to know that he was a peak-stage rank one True Saint, and his forte was power, yet he was completely crushed?

“Rank two!”

“This is the power of a rank two True Saint!”

The burly bald man let out a cry of surprise, but the green light continued to charge toward his body.

Bang!

The green light hit the burly bald man’s body, and the burly bald man spat out a mouthful of blood. His entire body shot backward like a cannonball.

With just one attack, the burly bald man’s body was heavily injured.

However, before he could stabilize himself, the cyan light shook slightly and then came at him for the second time.

This time, the bald man did not even have the chance to wave his ax to defend himself.

Bang!

Under the terrifying power contained in the cyan light, the bald man’s divine body finally collapsed.

This scene stunned the Blood Blade Island Master, the red-robed girl, and the black-robed cold-looking young man who was about to rush to Jian Wushuang.

Their expressions were also very interesting.

“In just two moves, the divine body of the Lord of the Luo God Island, who has the strongest attack power among the four of us, actually collapsed?” The red-robed girl muttered.

Whoosh!

A large amount of divine power began to gather crazily. In just a moment, the body of the burly bald man has formed again.

However, after his divine body was formed, he did not stop for even a moment. Instead, he fled backward at his fastest speed.

As he fled, he hissed, “Blood Blade Island Master, you lied to me!”

“I, I…” The Blood Saber Island Master was also at a loss. He did not know how to answer.

He knew why the burly bald man would say that.

When the four of them met, he said that although Jian Wushuang’s battle strength was stronger than his, it was not too outrageous. With their combined battle strength, they could easily contend with Jian Wushuang and even completely crush him.

That was why the four of them joined hands to kill him.

But now, when they actually saw Jian Wushuang fight with him…in just two moves, the burly bald man’s divine body was severely damaged, in the second move, the bald man’s divine body directly collapsed.

The two moves were completed in a flash.

In such a short time, the bald man’s divine body had collapsed once.

What kind of strength was this?

A first rank True Saint, even an expert who had reached the peak of the first rank, could not do this.

Obviously, this expert from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance had the combat power of a second-level True Saint, and he was probably a strong existence among second-level True Saints!
