Chapter 87: The Observed Prey

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The purple-haired middle-aged man and the indigo-robed man swallowed their saliva. They trembled and experienced great fear, after they saw a death-like smile on Jian Wushuang’s lips.

“I will hand… I will hand over the golden horn.” The indigo-robed man trembled and tossed the golden horn to Jian Wushuang immediately.

“Me too.” The purple-haired middle-aged man also handed over his golden horn.

Taking the golden horn, Jian Wushuang smiled coldly, “You are not foolish men.”

After speaking, Jian Wushuang walked toward Ye Mei with a flicker. Jian Wushuang handed over a golden horn to her and said, “This is yours.”

“Me?” Ye Mei was still confused.

“You deserve it because of your contribution while killing the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns.” Jian Wushuang said.

After hesitating a while, Ye Mei ground her teeth and took the golden horn. She mumbled, “Thank you!”

After shrugging his shoulders, Jian Wushuang said quietly, “Ye Mei. For your father’s sake, I remind you that you’d better not trust anyone even if he is your partner because many have incomprehensible hearts. You will meet many as you travel the world.”

After being slightly startled, Ye Mei looked at the indigo-robed man beside her and the purple-haired middle-aged man and subsequently nodded.

“Is it already over?” While a loud booming voice, the black-robed man Ba Yan walked out from the forest.

“Captain Ba Yan.”

Jian Wushuang and others looked at the black-robed man.

Seeing the corpse of the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns, a satisfied smile emerged on Ba Yan’s face. Ba Yan waved his hands to put the corpse into the Interspatial Ring.

Ba Yan only knew that Jian Wushuang together with three people killed the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns, but did not know what happened here a moment ago nor the existence of the Herculean Demonic Monkey. Jian Wushuang had already put the corpse of the Herculean Demonic Monkey into his Interspatial Ring.

“Who got the two golden horns?” Ba Yan asked curiously.

After hearing that, the indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man’s expression were depressed. However, Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Ye Mei got one. So did I, with good luck.”

“Oh?” The countenance of Ba Yan grew odd.

He did not expect that Ye Mei obtained one golden horn. After all, Ye Mei was in the Initial Gold Core Realm of Jindan and her strength was not weak.

But Jian Wushuang…

Only in the Spiritual Sea Realm, Jian Wushuang could obtain one golden horn?

Ba Yan couldn’t help but look at the indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man. He found that they stood there with reticence and sporadically looked at Jian Wushuang with gazes filled with dense fear.

“These two men…” Ba Yan, an experienced person, understood the two men’s gazes. Based on this, Ba Yan was more curious.

What happened? I feel the fear from the two men towards Swordsman.

After all, Swordsman is only in the Spiritual Sea Realm, but they are all in the Primordial Gold Core!

Although Ba Yan was curious, he did not ask.

“Now that the two golden horns have been distributed, we should move to meet Tai Shan immediately. The strength of the three Blue-eyed Beasts with Golden Horns was high, so we expended more effect to kill them. Now, Tai Shan and the two others are recovering their Spiritual Power.” Ba Yan smiled and said.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile.

Several people walked toward another battlefield.

…

In the mountain forest.

“Swordsman, could you tell me what happened a moment ago? Why do I feel that the two men are afraid of you?” After glancing at the indigo-robed man and the purple-haired middle-aged man, Ba Yan asked discreetly.

“Captain Ba Yan, I have said that it was due to luck.” Jian Wushuang smiled and did not want to explain much.

“Forget it if you don’t want to say.” Ba Yan smirked. “My aim is the two corpses of the Blue-eyed Beasts with Golden Horns. As for who could succeed in the mission, it does not matter much to me.”

Jian Wushuang smiled silently. He found that the attitude from Ba Yan towards him had improved.

At this moment…

“Come out!”

“Son of a b*tch. Do you dare to battle me directly?”

“Ah!”

Hearing a salvo of hysterical and furious roars from up ahead, Jian Wushuang and other people were startled.

“Something has happened.” Jian Wushuang said.

“The voice belongs to Tai Shan!” Ba Yan frowned. “Hurry up! Hurry up!”

The five men accelerated their speed and dashed up ahead as quickly as possible. Soon after, they arrived at a desolate war-torn land.

In the center of this land, a bearded strong man was clasping a big bronze saber. He stared around appearing flushed, and roared furiously continuously.

Around the bearded strong man, there were two cold corpses.

“Wang Chong? Lin Yu?”

After seeing the two corpses, Jian Wushuang, and the others changed their expression.

The two corpses were their partners. They had worked together with Ba Yan and Tai Shan to kill the Blue-eyed Beast with Golden Horns ago. Subsequently, Wang Chong, Lin Yu, and Tai Shan had stayed there to recover their spiritual power. Meanwhile, Ba Yan had been looking for Jian Wushuang and his three companions.

However, it was beyond their expectation that the two people had actually died before Ba Yan could lead Jian Wushuang and his companions over.

“Tai Shan. What happened?” Ba Yan walked toward Tai Shan.

“Don’t ask me. I don’t know.” Tai Shan still flushed with his veins bulging on his forehead. Furthermore, a trace of fear was in his eyes.

“We are being observed by someone.” Jian Wushuang suddenly said.

“Ah?” Everyone looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Look at their wounds.” Jian Wushuang pointed to the two corpses of Wang Chong and Lin Yu.

There was only one scar on the whole corpse. The scar was located at their necks and the was an obvious sword scar.

“Death with a single blow. They had no chance to retaliate. It’s similar to the corpses on the road which we passed by earlier.” Jian Wushuang spoke softly.

“It’s him?” The countenance of everyone fell, after hearing what Jian Wushuang said.

In fact, they didn’t know who he was. However, they had seen numerous corpses by the road. Those people were killed by a single harsh blow.

“He might be close by.” Jian Wushuang only saw tall trees and could not identify where the man was hiding.

“Does he regard us as prey?” Ye Mei whispered.

“Very likely.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

In the Innumerable Huge Mountains, not only was it useful to hunt spirit beasts, but also hunting humans. Hunting humans was even more profitable.

A man in a silver robe stood in a treetop adjacent to the barren land. Cloaked by leaves, he could see what Jian Wushuang and his companions were doing, but his targets could not see him.

Two people in the Profound Gold Core Realm. Three people in the Initial Gold Core Realm. And a man at Spiritual Sea Realm. All of them are the Golden-dragon Guard!

This looks interesting. Let me play with you.

The man in the silver robe tilted his lips and smiled coldly after observing the worried expression on Ba Yan and others.Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com
