Chapter 3083: Special Life Form

(the first one is here!)

——

Buzz —— the world shook.

Xiong Tao had turned into a prehistoric beast and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang in a flash.

Whoosh!

The long staff came crashing down.

A golden staff shadow rapidly enlarged in the void, crushing the void in a mighty way, as if the void was about to be completely crushed.

The terrifying divine power swept out without restraint. Jian Wushuang immediately saw that the power burst out by Xiong Tao had definitely reached the level of a third rank True Saint!

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang smiled coldly, and then his divine power suddenly increased, and he directly slashed out with his Blood Mountain Sword.

Bang!

A crisp air explosion sounded, as if the world was about to explode completely.

At the place where Jian Wushuang and Xiong Tao were fighting, a terrifying shock wave swept out crazily in all directions, and a huge divine power storm suddenly formed.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

The two figures also retreated explosively once again.

This time, they were still evenly matched.

“How is this possible?” Xiong Tao’s face was full of shock.

If he was evenly matched with Jian Wushuang in the beginning because he had not shown his true strength, then now he had gone all out and unleashed the power of his divine power to the maximum.

The power of his divine power was comparable to that of a rank three True Saint, but he still could not gain an advantage in front of Jian Wushuang.

“It seems that I have underestimated you.” Xiong Tao’s body trembled slightly. He was excited, and his eyes shone with an unprecedented light. “Heavenly Sword Marquis, I didn’t expect that not only your swordsmanship is very strong, but your divine power is also so powerful. Although there are countless geniuses in the Dao Palace, none of them can compare to you.”

“Thank you for your compliment. You’re not bad either,”Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

He was telling the truth. Xiong Tao was definitely the strongest and most terrifying first rank True Saint he had ever seen.

Mountain King and the other two whom he had met in the White Bone Region were far inferior to Xiong Tao.

“If I’m not wrong, you haven’t fully displayed your strength yet.” Jian Wushuang looked at Xiong Tao.

“Smart.” Xiong Tao grinned. “Since I entered the Dao Palace, I haven’t used my full strength for a long, long time. But today, I met you…Heavenly Sword Marquis, you should be glad that you are the first cultivator of the same level to force me to reveal my true form.”

Xiong Tao’s words echoed between heaven and earth. As soon as he finished his words, his body began to change.

Originally, Xiong Tao looked like a strong man who was nearly three meters tall. However, at this moment, his divine body began to expand at an astonishing speed, from three meters tall to ten meters tall, at the same time, his body began to swell crazily, and his skin turned from dark to golden. The golden skin was like pieces of golden rocks, covering every corner of Xiong Tao’s divine body.

“This is…” Jian Wushuang frowned and looked at Xiong Tao.

“It’s not a human, but a beast? No, it’s not a beast!” Jian Wushuang shook his head violently. “Its aura and feeling are completely different from that of a beast. This feeling…is unique. It’s a special life form!”

A fierce light flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

The Divine Beginning World was vast and boundless.

In the Divine Beginning World, there were all kinds of creatures, such as humans, exotic beasts, dire beasts, and so on.

At the same time, there were also some races with unique bloodlines, such as the four great divine races, who stood at the top of the Divine Beginning World.

The four great divine races had very high bloodlines, and their innate advantages were much greater than that of humans and ordinary exotic beasts.

However, the four divine races were not the ones with the greatest innate advantage in the Divine Beginning World. The ones with the greatest innate advantage were the unique special life forms in the Divine Beginning World!

These special life forms were born special and different from the rest. There was basically only one type of life form in the entire Divine Beginning World.

Like Jian Wushuang, he was a perfect chaos creature. To put it bluntly, he was also a type of special life form. However, he was the most supreme among the special life forms. Even the will of the Heavenly Dao was extremely fearful of him.

Although other special life forms could not be compared to perfect chaotic gods, they were much stronger than those with special bloodlines and races.

However, such special life forms were too rare. They were rare in the Divine Beginning World. Although Jian Wushuang had heard of them before, he had never seen them before.

But now, he had seen them for real.

Xiong Tao was undoubtedly a special life form!

“No wonder his divine power is so powerful. Special life forms have a huge innate advantage. Although he is only a rank one True Saint, his divine power is no less than an ordinary rank three True Saint.” Jian Wushuang praised, however, it was normal when he thought about it.

Although there were not many special life forms in the Divine Beginning World, the Dao Palace was where all the geniuses of the Divine Beginning World gathered. It was normal to have one or two special life forms. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Bai Xiao and the others who were watching the battle in the void were excited when they saw the changes in Xiong Tao’s divine body.

“There was a rumor in the Dao Palace that senior brother Xiong Tao had an extremely unique bloodline. There was even a rumor that he was a unique special life form in the world. No one had seen it before, so everyone doubted the rumor. But now, it seems that the rumor is true!” Bai Xiao exclaimed in surprise.

“Special life forms, even the lowest level special life forms have an innate advantage that is much stronger than some powerful bloodline races. Although senior brother Xiong Tao is only a first level True Saint, because of the special life forms, his divine power is at least comparable to a peak second level True Saint, or even a third level True Saint!”

“If we combine this with some secret techniques that are unique to the Dao Palace to increase the power of his divine power, senior brother Xiong Tao’s divine power will definitely reach the peak of the third rank in a short period of time, even approaching the level of a fourth rank True Saint!

“And the staff technique that senior brother Xiong Tao created has already reached the peak of the fourth rank…”

The red-haired man, the black-robed youth, and the beautiful woman in golden armor widened their eyes.

They knew that Xiong Tao was very strong, but they did not know how strong he was because they were not qualified to fight with him. But now, they finally understood.

“Monster, Senior Brother Xiong Tao is definitely a real monster!”

The four people were growling in their hearts.

At this moment, as soon as Xiong Tao revealed his true form, his aura surged again. His eyes were cold as he stared at Jian Wushuang. “Next, I will use my strongest strength. In addition, I will also use my strongest staff skill. You can try your best to block it. If you can’t block it, just say the word and I will stop immediately.”
