Chapter 926: The Battle of the Dao Masters

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Dao Master!”

“Xia Mang is now a Dao Master!”

“How long has it been since he started cultivating?”

Surprised, everyone on the drill ground began discussing Xia Mang.

The top experts in the audience wore very colorful expressions after detecting Xia Mang’s aura.

“How could he be a Dao Master?”

“I heard that he’s only been cultivating for thousands of years but he’s become a Dao Master in such a short time. I think he’s the youngest Dao Master in the history of the Eternal World.”

“His doppelganger had deceived us all by only revealing part of his Dao earlier. Now that he has become a Daoist, he must have opened up a complete Dao at the Creation Level!”

“Even if he’s new to the rank, he’s probably at the top of Rank One with a Dao at the Creation Level.”

The experts looked at Xia Mang with respect.

Xia Mang had previously shown great potential, but to them, he had been just an insignificant youngster.

However, Xia Mang was now a Dao Master who had opened up a Dao at the Creation Level. This was enough for the experts to regard him as their equal.

There were three ranks for a Dao Master. Xia Mang had demonstrated the battle strength of someone at the top of Rank One!

“Elder Xia Yu, you have a great expert in your clan,” the experts said.

“He has become a Dao Master at such a young age with a Dao at the Creation Level. He’ll go on to achieve even greater things in the future.”

Xia Yu wore a smug look as the experts in the audience sang praises about Xia Mang.

“The old dog! No wonder he’s so confident in this battle. It turned out that it was Xia Mang’s doppelganger earlier while the real thing has long become a Dao Master.” Xue Lingtian clenched his hands, his face turning gloomy.

Xia Mang stood in the center of the drill ground. He had recalled his doppelganger, and there was powerful aura from his Original Body. He looked over at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was now reassessing Xia Mang as an opponent.

He would have nothing to fear if Xia Mang was only in the Eternal Realm, but things were different now that the latter had become a Dao Master.

After all, there was a huge difference between an Eternal Realm expert and a Dao Master.

“Be careful, Jian Wushuang! Xia Mang has opened up a Dao at the Creation Level and became a top Rank One Dao Master.” Gu King’s voice rang in Jian Wushuang’s mind, warning him.

“Maybe I shouldn’t have looked down on him before. Well, no. This makes things more interesting,” Jian Wushuang said, licking his lips as he felt his Bloodline Power surge. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Boom!” His Bloodline Power exploded and his body immediately turned golden. Two Quadrangular Stars appeared on his chest!

Two-star Gold-armored Ancient God!

However, unlike before, His body did not grow too much. He was only about two meters high after making his transformation.

It was because Jian Wushuang was able to control the size of his body after turning into the Two-star Ancient God.

“I’d like to see how powerful you are as a Dao Master,” Jian Wushuang said.

Jian Wushuang, the Gold-armored Ancient God, looked at Xia Mang with a pair of dark golden eyes. The desire to battle rose from his body.

“You’ll find out soon,” Xia Mang replied.

Following these words, Xia Mang flew high up in the Void. Then, he brought his palm, covered in a blood-colored glove, down to the spot where Jian Wushuang was standing in with force.

The slam turned into a bloody mountain, skyrocketing dozens of times more powerfully than before.

Jian Wushuang was no longer where he was by the time the bloody mountain descended.

“Boom!”

The bloody mountain crashed onto the ground, causing the entire drill ground to shake violently. Then, the center of the ground caved in to form a massive, hand-shaped pit. The pit was several miles wide and more than ten feet deep.

Countless gravel was sent flying.

Every blade of grass in the area withered.

“Swoosh!”

Jian Wushuang appeared next to Xia Mang in a strange and unpredictable manner.

The scarlet sword appeared in his hand at the same time, emitting a horrible killing intent. It was his Blood Mountain Sword.

His sword had become all that more powerful after he entered the Eternal Realm.

Jian Wushuang swiped Xia Mang with his sword in a casual manner and a Scarlet Thunderbolt burst forth from the tip of the sword, carrying a potent destructive aura.

The Scarlet Thunderbolt was none other than the Divine Yin Thunder that he had cultivated on the Star Island.

“Hum!”

The sword light smashed through the Void, destroying everything in its path.

Xia Mang sneered and hoisted himself higher up into the Void with a slight movement. The sword light swept past his feet.

The sword light ended up sweeping the perimeter of the drill ground after missing its target.

The countless spectators that stood on the fringe of the drill ground panicked when they saw the sword light charging at them.

The General of the Royal Guards, who was in charge of maintaining order in the assembly, intervened just then.

The General, a genuine Dao Master, rushed toward the edge of the drill ground as quick as lightning. As he raised his right hand and made a fist, a giant Demonic Ape Phantom appeared behind him.

He threw a punch, causing an explosion in the air.

“Crash!”

The sword lightcollided with the fist, sending horrible waves and air currents flying in all directions.

“What?” The General of the Royal Guards was surprised.

He was stunned that his punch had merely blocked the sword light, not entirely shattering it.

The horrible air currents formed a huge storm that swept over the spectators on the rear. There were more than one hundred thousand of them who stood close to the battlefield and they were all hurt by the storm that carried a small amount of Sword Essence.

It took a moment for the storm to be settled.

The scene stunned the crowd.

The horrible palm attack had destroyed everything within a few miles of its force.

The sword light had formed a storm and knocked down more than a hundred thousand people—and after the General of the Royal Guards intercepted it, to boot!

What kind of absurd strength was this?

“I-It’s a battle between Dao Masters!”

A sudden uproar swept everyone on the drill ground.
