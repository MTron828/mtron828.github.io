Chapter 5575 ¬†Escape

"This time, thanks to Brother Wushuang!" Frolasa's declaration of brotherhood brought their relationship with Jian Wushuang to the forefront.

Jian Wushuang felt a bit awkward about the address but knowing that the other party would soon leave, he couldn't help feeling a sense of relief.

His current status was partly due to Shen Ling Frolasa and the other half to Wu Zuo. What a combination of pitfalls and jinx!

Jian Wushuang didn't take Shen Ling's attentiveness seriously, nor did he dare to.

With Zhen Ling by his side, he couldn't be too enthusiastic or too humble. Since the other party wanted to treat him as an equal, he responded with a casual cough, saying, "It's nothing."

Simple and straightforward was best, and Zhen Ling was pleased with it.

"This is not a trivial matter. I owe you a favor privately. In the future, if you encounter any difficulties, don't hesitate to find me. You can use this token. Whenever you face a strong member of my Giant God Clan, just show this token, and there will be no danger!"

The words sounded domineering, but even Zhen Ling didn't doubt the exaggeration.

The Giant God Clan indeed had such strength!

Jian Wushuang also understood this and was momentarily tempted. However, there was a clear intention in the other's words to belittle the Qishen Temple. He hesitated for a moment on whether to accept or not.

"Since it's given, just take it!" Zhen Ling, seeing Jian Wushuang's dilemma, spoke decisively, helping him out.

Only then did Jian Wushuang dare to accept the token and express his gratitude to Zhen Ling with a respectful bow. With this, the matter had come to a complete conclusion.

The strongest hand shrouded in the Four Great Secret Realms was about to exit the history of the Qishen Temple.

Unfortunate Frolasa, stern Fuego, and the yet-to-hatch Fimisa walked into the passage.

The three powerful beings of the Giant God Clan entered the corridor.

Frolasa glanced back and then entered the passage directly.

Since his birth, most of his time had been spent in the Qishen Temple, making it his first home.

Jian Wushuang watched their backs, feeling a complete relief deep in his heart.

Zhen Ling, on the other hand, was quite relaxed. Finally, these people were sent away. In the future, the Four Great Secret Realms would return to calmness, becoming the exclusive garden of the Inheritors.

As for greater troubles, they were in the Purgatory. He had no choice but to take it step by step.

Splash!

After Zhen Ling closed the passage, he turned to look at the few people left by Frolasa.

Besides Jian Wushuang, there was the Elder of the Moluo Nation and several emperors.

They weren't much of a threat, but since they were dead soldiers, there was no need to keep them. With a wave, the Emperors turned into powder.

The body of the Moluo Elder shook. He wasn't a dead soldier; he had long known that this day would come. Without resistance, he closed his eyes.

"Wait!" Jian Wushuang stood up with a stiff expression and said, "Lord Zhen Ling, he is not a dead soldier. Can you spare him and let him go to the mines to make up for his great mistake?"

Seeing this, Wu Zuo quickly spoke up, "Lord Zhen Ling, this time we have won a great victory. Let my subordinates handle these petty thieves and troublemakers!"

Although the Elder Moluo Nation felt no fear, deep down, he wanted to stay alive!

At this moment, he felt gratitude towards Jian Wushuang and Wu Zuo.

Zhen Ling cast a sidelong glance at Wu Zuo, and with just one look, he silenced Wu Zuo, who stepped aside. FOlloow ùíèewest stories at nùíê(v)el/bi/n(.)com

However, being only a supreme-peak being, since the request was made, there was no need to add more slaughter.

Among the Inheritors now, whether it was Hu Qing, whom he had favored before, or Jian Wushuang, whom he had underestimated, he had offended each one of them.

Jian Wushuang was relatively easy; a few treasures could pacify him, and there was still some utility in keeping him around.

But Hu Qing was different‚Äîa stubborn one.

He had invested so much in nurturing him, only to produce a troublemaker.

Having someone by his side that even ghosts were unaware of!

When it came to Jiang Shang, Zhen Ling wouldn't hesitate; this threat surpassed even the Giant God Clan.

Facing the Giant God Clan, there was a chance of a direct confrontation, but the Origin Source True Spirit within Jiang Shang was of the same kind as him. What if one day, that True Spirit decided to take over?

However, now he was alert!

"Well then, spare his life. As for the mine, there's no need to go there. In the future, just follow Jian Wushuang and be a guardian. The incident from last time must not happen again!" Zhen Ling spoke with a sense of regret, as if lamenting the near loss of a valuable asset.

Wu Zuo listened with surprise, becoming more certain in his heart that Jian Wushuang would undoubtedly become the future controller of the Qishen Temple. Otherwise, Zhen Ling wouldn't have gone to such lengths to rescue him.

He silently decided to hold on to Jian Wushuang, this future noble.

He thought all of this was thanks to Zhen Ling. If he knew that in the First Prison, Zhen Ling had almost personally executed Jian Wushuang, he didn't know what he would think.

Jian Wushuang, who knew everything, didn't share the same thoughts. He wouldn't trust Zhen Ling's words again, even if he were beaten to death!

"Oh, by the way, escort all these Special Life Forms to the Demon Sound Mountain and give them to Moyin!" Zhen Ling suddenly remembered there was still a group of troublesome people to deal with‚Äîdozens of Special Life Forms with the power of the supreme-peak behind them.

Originally, they had planned to leave them in the First Prison, but upon discovering the situation inside the Purgatory, they dared not leave these people there. What if there were more problems!

As for the promises made earlier, he had no intention of fulfilling them.

Zhen Ling pointed to the formidable figure of Zhuang Zhong, a powerhouse in the Tribulation realm, and said, "You go too. Keep an eye on these guys. Release them only when they are willing to wear the Divine-Demonic Restraints!"

Upon hearing this, the faces of those Special Life Forms changed drastically!

They couldn't even muster the courage to curse.

Zhuang Zhong had now become the vanguard of Zhen Ling, without any complaints, he could only comply.

Just being able to get out was good enough.

When Wu Zuo heard the name Zhuang Zhong, he was somewhat surprised. He was familiar with the person and since they were going in the same direction, he approached for a conversation.

As a former disciple of the Qishen Temple, Zhuang Zhong naturally knew Wu Zuo, and since they shared the same master, they could be considered to get along.

On the ruins.

Now, there were only three people left.

Zhen Ling, Jian Wushuang, and the Elder of the Moluo Nation.

"Tsk tsk, you've really achieved great things this time. You can directly go to the Elder Palace and take the Origin Source. You can rest assured, no one will trouble you!" Zhen Ling said seriously.

This time, Jian Wushuang chose to believe him; there was no other choice.

Zhen Ling turned to signal the Moluo Elder to step back and then carefully set up a barrier. "I have one more thing here that I need to remind you about!"

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang approached, and as the two exchanged whispers, his expression darkened completely.
