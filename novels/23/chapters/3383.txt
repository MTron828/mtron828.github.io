Chapter 3384: Soul Peeling

Translator: EndlessFantasy TranslationEditor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“That’s it.” The old woman said seriously, “Soul peeling is to turn this girl’s soul into two pieces. One of them will carry her memories from her previous life, and you will take it with you. The other piece will carry her memories from this life, and she will continue to stay in my Supreme Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Emotion-forgetting Valley to cultivate that supreme divine art!”

“This way, the good thing is that you can have the best of both worlds. After all, you only want your wife from your previous life. As for the bad thing, once you peel off her soul, the two parts of her soul will not be complete. Thus, you will need some treasures related to the soul to completely restore her

soul. The requirements for such a soul treasure are extremely high. In the Divine Beginning Realm, the only thing that can fulfill this condition is the soul treasure, the star-moon Agarwood. Moreover, it must be a hundred million years old!”

“The star-moon Agarwood is an extremely rare treasure. In the Divine Beginning Realm, it can even be said to be extinct. This kind of treasure lives in an extremely harsh environment. It’s hard to even exist for a million years. Thus, it’s even harder to obtain a hundred million years old star-moon

agarwood.”

“However, my Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley once obtained a small piece of hundred million years old star-moon agarwood by chance. It can be used on the soul that was left in my Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley after it was peeled off, allowing it to completely recover. As for the part of the

soul that retained your wife’s memories, you’ll have to think of a way yourself.”

“Of course, since our Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley has a piece of hundred-million-year-old star-moon agarwood, and as the most ancient and mysterious Temporal Temple of the three Freedom Alliances in the Divine Beginning Realm, we should have it. Even if we don’t have it, we can definitely

find a way to get it.”

After saying that, the old woman looked at Jian Wushuang again.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang was silent.

Soul peeling…Jian Wushuang had some understanding of soul peeling and knew the advantages and disadvantages of soul peeling.

Most importantly, his wife, Leng Rushuang, had actually carried out soul peeling in her previous life.

Because of her special physique, her wife’s soul was divided into two parts. One part of her personality became Leng Rushuang, and the other part was the evil incarnation of her physique, Leng Ruxue, the two souls occupied the same body. At first, Leng Rushuang was in charge, but later, Leng Rushuang’s

soul consciousness was suppressed and led by Leng Ruxue.

In the end, their souls were completely separated. Leng Ruxue followed her master into the Divine Beginning Realm, while Leng Rushuang entered the reincarnation passage like Jian Wushuang.

In other words, Leng Rushuang had stripped her soul before, and she had already borne the price.

“Senior, if her soul is stripped in two, who will be in charge of her body now?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course, the soul left in the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, which is my disciple, will be in charge.” The old woman said seriously, “I can’t help it. The Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley has spent a lot of money to nurture this girl. Now that she has finally reached this level, she is very close to the

top of the supreme divine skill. At this moment, I won’t let her give up this body and start over!”

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

He knew that the soul stripping was actually tolerable for Leng Rushuang. The key question was who would control her current body once the soul was stripped.

Of course, Jian Wushuang hoped that his wife could control this body, but the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley obviously would not allow it.

Jian Wushuang could understand. After all, the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley had indeed paid too much for her to cultivate the supreme divine skill. If she let the soul with the memories of this life leave this body…then she would have to start all over again. It was absolutely unbearable for the

Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you may not know this, but I will soon die,” the old woman suddenly said.

“What?” Jian Wushuang looked at her in surprise.

The old Valley Master of the Supreme Emotion Valley, a task that even the three masters of the Saint Realm, including the Temporal Temple Master, were afraid of, would soon die? Was this a joke?

“Tm not lying to you,” the old woman said solemnly. “The supreme divine skill of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley is very special. Although it’s extremely powerful and can allow me, who was only at the sixth realm of the Void realm, to burst out with battle strength comparable to that of a master,

or even stronger than an ordinary master, it’s so powerful that I have to pay a price every time I use it.”

“What’s the price?” Jian Wushuang asked immediately.

Lifespan!” The old woman sighed, she continued, “Under normal circumstances, when a cultivator reaches the level of a Principles Master, their lifespan may not be endless, but it’s also very long. However, no matter who it is, as long as they cultivate the divine skill of our Supreme Emotion-forgetting

Valley, there’s no such thing as an endless lifespan.

“Thave personally experienced it. For example, when I cultivate the divine skill to this level, my lifespan can only last for one billion years at most.”

“One billion years is considered very long. Senior’s lifespan should be far from one billion years, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Although he did not know how long the old Valley Master of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley had lived, as far as he knew, the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley had existed in the Divine Beginning Realm for less than one billion years.

“Just based on the time I’ve lived, this old body is still far from one billion years. However, this old body has just said that these one billion years of life is just the threshold to cultivate that divine technique. After cultivating, every time I use it, it will consume my life. Under normal circumstances, every

time this old body uses that divine technique, it will consume one hundred million years of life!”

“Thave been staying in the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley ever since I started cultivating that divine skill. During that time, the valley had encountered many dangers, so I had to use all my strength. I have used that divine skill many times, and my lifespan has been continuously consumed. So far, I

have less than 100 million years left!”

“Less than 100 million years? Does that mean…” Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted.

“Yes, if I use that divine skill one more time, I will die immediately. So, even if you disrespect me today and threaten me in front of me, I have not completely shed all pretense of cordiality with you. Although this is also because of your strong life-saving skills, more importantly, I don’t want to give you

this last chance to use the divine skill,” the old woman said.

“I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and sighed in his heart.

He had thought that the old Valley Master was really helpless against him, so he had to step back. But now it seemed that was not the case..
