Chapter 1570: Turn Into A Stone Block For Twenty-One Thousand Years!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

It was windy at the peak of the mountain and it was quite chilly. The breeze blew against Jian Wushaung’s frail and hoary body and it was piercingly cold.

Jian Wushuang didn’t move but sat there like an old monk in deep meditation.

The time flew past.

Days, months, and years.

Constant exposure to the wind and sun caused a gradual change to Jian Wushuang’s body. In the end, he turned into a stone block.

Sometimes, there were birds that came to rest on the stone block. Sometimes, there were humans that reached the peak of the mountain. But no one worried about the stone block.

From what they saw, the stone block looked weird in shape but not much different from any other stone blocks.

During the years when Jian Wushuang became a stone block, Elder Ming Ba, the Real God from Green Feather Pavilion watched him in silence in the void.

“What is this Jian Wushuang trying to do?”

Ming Ba was confused.

Ever since Jian Wushuang had come to Qing Tian Mystery Land, he had been following Jian Wushuang. He watched Jian Wushuang’s experience with his own eyes in the mystery land.

At the beginning, he had thought that Jian Wushuang already blended into life as a commoner and he reckoned that he would stay in there for the rest of his life as a commoner.

However, he became a stone block and his aura had yet to disperse.

Ming Ba couldn’t understand at all.

But he didn’t know that Jian Wushuang was at the final stage of the third inverse cultivation test. Also the most crucial step: Change, Reborn!

At that very moment, Jian Wushuang finally understood that what he had experienced during the third inverse cultivation test was the life test!

Test of fate!

From the peak to the pit!

From a top genius in everyone’s eyes to a disabled person that had no soul power at all.

To a person that everyone respected and in awe to a poor man that no one pitied.

He was bullied and tortured.

Everything was in the test of fate.

The test was testing his mind.

The transformation at heart allowed one to detach from worldly views, become open-minded and accept everything. Then, one could see through the fog before his eyes and return to the peak.

Otherwise… they would be doomed forever!

Just like Real God Wu Bei, when he was going through the test, he once went mad. If it wasn’t because he had received a warm welcome at his last stage and barely maintained an open heart, he wouldn’t be able to go through his third inverse cultivation test. Even if he passed through it, he would be drastically different in disposition.

But Jian Wushuang was different.

From the change of mind during the three thousand years in Lineage of Star, to when he had first got to Qing Tian Mystery Land and saw Chen Village being massacred and turned into an ocean of blood. He nearly went mad too.

He might as well have stayed in Rising Sun Palace for a dozen years. He had lived his life of sweeping floor calmly for a dozen years and his heart was finally at peace.

It was truly peaceful, like an old well with no ripples.

Then, he turned into Wu Chen (no dust) and blended into a commoner’s life. He was open-hearted with everything.

Do what one finds satisfactory, do what one pleases. Everything went according to fate.

After thousands of years, even though he looked pathetic in many’s eyes, Jian Wushuang was calm and unaffected.

Maintaining his attitude, he turned into a stone block and reached the last step. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

He used a total of thirteen thousand years in the last step.

He turned into a stone block on the peak of the mountain and towered there for thirteen-thousand years.

Finally, he woke up.

“Jian Wushuang.”

King of Venomous Worms’ voice suddenly was heard in Jian Wushuang’s head, “Three-thousand years in Lineage of Star, five-thousand years of walking in Qing Tian Mystery Land and thirteen-thousand years as a stone block. In total, it was twenty-one thousand years!”

“This twenty-one thousand years, every year, every day, every hour, even every breath is a test but you didn’t disappoint me.”

“Congratulations!”

“From today onwards, you… Already possess the qualifications to stand at the top of Eternal Chaotic World!”

King of Venomous Worms said and his voice was obviously boiling with excitement.

Inverse Cultivation, competing with the universe.

Under the pressure of heaven and earth, resulting in peak.

The third inverse cultivation test, one step was more difficult than the other. Every step was a step through the gate of hell. Over the years, one hundred percent of inverse cultivators that had appeared before had died before the third inverse cultivation test. Previously, when King of Venomous Worms recognizes Jian Wushuang as an owner, he was also worried that Jian Wushuang would die during an inverse cultivation test.

But then… luck had turned in his favor or maybe it should be described as a trapped dragon soaring into the sky!

Jian Wushuang passed through all three inverse cultivation tests.

From that day onward, his journey of inverse cultivation would have no more tests.

He already possessed the qualification to enter the peak experts rank.

Hearing what King of Venomous Worms had said, Jian Wushuang was delighted but there wasn’t a surge of emotion.

Slowly, he opened his eyes. The moment he opened his eyes, the stone block that he had become slowly collapsed.

A large amount of stone started shattering and revealed Jian Wushuang’s scrawny and hoary body. However, the hoary body was undergoing a drastic change.

Transformation!

After passing the inverse cultivation test, the transformation from a Universe God in the Second Heaven to Universe God in the Third Heaven.

The transformation then was different from the previous two times. There wasn’t any divine light that descended, nor any force or movement.

Everything seemed rather calm.

In the void, Elder Ming Ba in Green Feather Pavilion continued to float there. He had been there for thirteen thousand years and he was already impatient long ago.

“I don’t know how long I need to wait for. This Jian Wushuang might as well die, but of all conditions, he was at the brink of death and I have to keep him company,” Ming Ba was shaking his head as he sighs. But, his face suddenly stiffened as he noticed the transformation of the stone block at the mountain below.

“Mm, this Jian Wushuang…”

Ming Ba saw Jian Wushuang’s stone block broke down and revealed his hoary body. Then his hoary body, like a piece of dead wood, suddenly recovered its vigor and became strong.

Jian Wushuang’s skin, which was dry and faintly tainted with yellow, gradually grew rosy. His face slowly became young again.

In an instant, Jian Wushuang who was originally grey-haired, like a man of old age, returned to his appearance of a young man who was once high and mighty that everyone respected.

“Divine power, a fluctuation of divine power?”

Ming Ba stared and he could feel that not only had Jian Wushuang resumed his original appearance, but his body was also giving out a fluctuation of divine power.

The fluctuation of divine power was faint but it pressured him.

“This Jian Wushuang, could it be… he has recovered?” Ming Ba was shocked at the thought.

Just then, on the peak of the mountain, Jian Wushuang, who had returned to his original appearance, his divine body had already completed the transformation. That very moment, he suddenly lifted his head and reined all the lights back in. His eyes, which were deep like vast stars, were looking at Ming Ba directly.

That instant, Ming Ba quivered in fear and his face instantly turned pale.
