Chapter 2091 Alliance Chief!

“Impressive, the new Ancient God Emperor, so impressive!”

“The best, the true expert amongst us Special Tribes!”

“Since he defeated Ba Su, the position of alliance chief goes to…”

The experts all looked at each other weirdly.

Most of them could not contain their excitement.

The Black Dragon Emperor of the Black Dragon Clan was the first to stand up. “As we have decided just now, the stronger expert that emerges will lead us. Since the Ancient Emperor has defeated Ba Su, the position of alliance chief of this Special Tribes Alliance belongs to him. The Black Dragon Clan fully supports this!”

The Black Dragon Emperor was the first.

Next was the God Eater Clan’s leader. “We God Eaters support him too.”

“So does my Clan!”

“The Ancient God Emperor has proved himself both in power and position, our Clan has no objections.”

One by one the clan leaders and experts spoke.

Amongst these people, most of them did not want Ba Su to win anyway.

Within moments, almost nine-tenths of the crowd approved Jian Wushuang.

The other smaller, more insignificant clans naturally joined in the crowd.

The Sky Swallowing Clan and the Black Bone Clan remained.

Ba Su of the Sky Swallowing Clan’s twisted face managed to squeeze a thin smile, as the crowd all looked towards him. He swallowed his indignity, and said, “The Ancient God Emperor is indeed strong, slightly stronger than me. I have no objections to him being chief.”

With Ba Su having no objections, the Black Bone Clan naturally followed.

Now, Jian Wushuang had received approval from all the clans. The position of chief fell naturally fell upon his shoulders.

“Since everyone here supports this decision, I will not go against it.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

After the position of chief was settled, the positions of deputy chief were discussed, along with the battle preparations.

The discussion with the other experts took half a day.

In total, five deputy chiefs emerged, with three of them coming from the other three Top Clans. The remaining positions were filled by other powerful and well respected Clans.

The Special Tribes Alliance was officially formed.

“Everyone, the discussion will end here. After you have returned, please make the preparations as soon as possible. Within a decade, we must be ready. From there I will link up with the human’s Sanctuary Alliance. Also, I will inform them to build Space Tunnels from each region and domain directly to the battlefield.”

“Dismissed.”

With a wave of Jian Wushuang’s hand, the many experts gradually left.

…

The Ancient God Clan remained in the great hall.

Jian Wushuang gathered King Chen Xing, King Luo Yu, and King Zhan Cang.

“King Chen Xing, have the experts left?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Some of them are in no rush, but most of them have left,” King Chen Xing replied.

“What about the Sky Swallowing Clan?” Jian Wushuang continued.

“The Sky Swallowing Clan left right after the ceremony. They were the first to leave,” King Chen Xing replied.

“What’s the rush?” Jian Wushuang laughed.

He would not have been surprised if other Clans had rushed back. But the Sky Swallowing Clan…

“This time, during the ceremony, the Sky Swallowing Clan obviously had plans for themselves. Ba Su seemed to have kept silent in the beginning, but he was simply getting Hei Qi from the Black Bone Clan to speak on his behalf instead. He didn’t want us Special Tribes to place any importance on the issue, but after he realised nothing could stop us from engaging in this battle, he did everything to form a Special Tribes Alliance with one main chief.”

“Obviously, this position of chief was meant for himself. He needed to be chief.”

“If I had not interfered and defeated Ba Su, with his strength and recognition amongst others he would have became chief instead. The consequences of this are unimaginable.” Jian Wushuang mumbled.

Jian Wushuang had only suspected the Sky Swallowing Clan in the beginning, but now he was almost sure that the Clan had ties with the Archelon Palace. Perhaps they had even pledged allegiance to the Archelon Palace.

Under these circumstances, letting Ba Su of the Sky Swallowing Clan become chief would mean losing the battle already.

“Even though their plans did not work out, the Sky Swallowing Clan will not rest here. They will make their next move.” Jian Wushuang squinted for a bit, and looked down towards King Chen Xing. “King Chen Xing, make preparations. I want eyes on that Clan from today onwards. Report any action, no matter how small it may seem.”

“Take note of the other Special Tribes as well.”

“Understood,” King Chen Xing obliged.

“King Luo Yu,” Jian Wushuang looked towards him. “Now that the Special Tribes have started making their preparations, we ourselves cannot fall behind. Gather the strongest experts we have. This will be my task for you.”

“No problem,” King Luo Yu nodded.

“You’re all dismissed.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

The three nine-star Ancient Emperors went away to make the necessary preparations.

Jian Wushuang continued to sit there and started transmitting something to Emperor Bai.

…

Sky Swallowing Sanctuary, deep in their lair, in the dusky Void.

“Clan Leader Ba Su, you really messed up this time. Because of you, all our well-thought plans have all been flushed down the drain,” the eerie black-robed man stood there, his voice seemingly depressed.

“Hngh, this was indeed partially my fault, but do you think the Archelon Palace had no responsibility either? The information you gave me was that Jian Wushuang was no more than a simple Second Stage Great Emperor. But what happened? His abilities are pinnacle Second Stage Great Emperor level!”

“If not for your inaccurate information, would I have fought face-to-face with him? I would never have just given the position of chief away to that brat.” Ba Su replied. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Hearing this, the black-robed man fell silent.
