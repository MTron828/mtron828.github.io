Chapter 2092 All In

Jian Wushuang’s abilities were indeed incredible.

Back at the Three Emperors World, the fighting power he demonstrated was indeed of a decent Second Stage Great Emperor level, but not the pinnacle.

From then till now, how long had it been?

Jian Wushuang had even defeated the pinnacle Second Stage Great Emperor Ba Su face-to-face.

Compare that to when Jian Wushuang had just arrived in Three Emperors World…

“Too fast, Jian Wushuang has improved too fast. At this rate, he won’t take long before he reaches Emperor Bai’s level. That would be a great disturbance to the Archelon Palace,” the black-robed man said solemnly.

“Why are you wasting time then? Have you came up with a plan to remove Jian Wushuang yet? Is that not what the Archelon Palace is known for?” Ba Su bawled.

“To kill Jian Wushuang…” the black-robed man thought for a while before shaking his head. “He is not the Jian Wushuang of yesterday. With such protection skills, it would prove too difficult to kill him. Maybe it would have been possible before he surpassed the seventh step of Inverse Cultivation, but it’s too late for that now…”

The black-robed man was helpless.

Indeed, they had missed the golden opportunity to kill Jian Wushuang.

Now that Jian Wushuang’s wings had spread, it was almost impossible to slay him.

“Hngh, what was the Archelon Palace doing in the beginning…” Ba Su questioned.

“Enough, there is nothing we can do to change the past. It has already happened, Jian Wushuang becoming chief of the Special Tribes Alliance and all,” the black-robed man said. “The window for you to become chief has long closed.”

“Now, we need to count on Plan B.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Plan B?” Ba Su’s pupils shrank. He knew what the black-robed man was referring to.

“We’re not prepared yet. Using Plan B, is that not a bit too hasty?” Ba Su frowned.

“We have no choice, if we wait for the Special Clans to unite their forces with the Sanctuary Alliance, it will be too late. We may not be well prepared, the plan may not be perfect, but it’s all or nothing now,” the black-robed man replied.

“All in, huh?” Ba Su found his well-needed determination. “Okay then, I’ll make the preparations.”

“Go then, the Archleon Palace will make its move now.”

With that, the black-robed man took out his token and gave the orders.

…

God Eater Sanctuary of the God Eater Clan.

Within the Sanctuary grounds, there were countless Special Tribes of different strengths besides the God Eater Clan.

At this moment, they had all gathered.

Two figures were pacing around.

“During the recent Ancient God Clan’s coronation, all clans unanimously agreed upon the creation of the Special Tribes Alliance, with the new Ancient God Emperor as chief. We, the Fire Edge Clan, as part of the Alliance, do not have enough Almighties. According to the chief, if a clan has more than ten Almighties, one or two may stay behind. But my clan only has three Almighties, so all of us have to fight,” the red-hair middle-aged man said.

“All three? With no Almighty to guard our Clan? What happens if our Clan finds itself in trouble?” a lad in black asked.

“As the chief mentioned, he will connect the clans and the Sanctuary Alliance with Space Tunnels. If anything happens within the Clan, we can come back immediately,” the red-haired man replied.

“That’s not too bad then,” the black-shirt lad nodded. But something was wrong. His eyes hinted at something sinister.

“Clan Leader, I’m afraid you won’t be able to join this battle,” the black-shirt lad said.

“Huh?” the red-haired middle-aged man turned around, only to see the black-shirt lad’s ferocious eyes staring at him.

Before he could say anything, a cold dagger plunged into the red-haired man’s chest at lightning speed.

“Crap!”

At this moment of life and death, the red-haired man immediately activated his armour and blocked the dagger.

But the dagger had already pierced the man’s skin. This was enough for the man’s face to completely change. He could feel a terrifying corrosive power seeping through his body from that bit of skin.

“Poison? You!”

The red-haired middle-aged man looked at the black-shirt lad, unable to believe what had happened.

The lad grinned hideously before making his departure.

…

In the Void above a clan’s lair, several black shadows stood in line.

These ten-odd men each let out a terrifying aura, for they were all Almighties above Sir God level. There was even one Emperor God.

These black-robed men stared at the massive clan in front of them, their eyes icy cold.

In moments, these ten-odd men floated towards the clan.

Hong!

A terrifying blow was heard, and thus began the massacre.

…

Within Ancient God Sanctuary grounds.

The Purple Snake Clan, a mid-tier Clan without experts of Emperor God levels, but which possessed five Sir Gods.

Now, these five Sir Gods and many more experts under them gathered. But they did not gather for the battle against the Three Emperors World, but for the other huge mid-tier clan in front of them. That clan had had great animosity against the Purple Snake Clan for a long period of time. Their hatred had grown to a point of no return.

“Purple Snake Clan Leader, the time is now. We can make our move,” a black-robed figure within the crowd smiled.

“What about your men?” The leader of the Purple Snake Clan asked.

“Relax, once you’ve made your move, the experts we inserted into the other clan will make their move too. You have our full support.”

“Good,” the leader smiled, and looked towards the masses behind him. “Clansmen, the time to cleanse our shame and take our revenge for our ancestors has arrived. Take your weapons, and kill them all!”

“Kill! Kill!”

The many experts from the Purple Snake Clan charged towards the other clan ferociously.

The two clans began their frenzy.

…

Slaughter after slaughter from all over the four Sanctuaries began almost simultaneously.

The entire Special Tribes domain was in a mess.
