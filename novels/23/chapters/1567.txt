The grey-haired elderly, Jian Wushuang who was drinking casually, looked at the surrounding and nodded in silence.

Zi Yi was really sweeping the floor attentively but didn’t intend to take a perfunctory attitude.

“Not bad. Put down the broom,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes,” Zi Yi immediately put the broom to the side.

“You said that you reached a bottleneck in martial arts,” Jian Wushuang glanced at Zi Yi, “perform your skill and see.”

“Yes,” Zi Yi immediately took out a long spear and performed before Jian Wushuang at the Martial Arts Tower.

Although the spear skills that she performed didn’t use too much force, it was powerful.

She had yet to perform one-fifth of her spear skill.

“You can stop now,” Jian Wushuang spoke.

“Senior,” Zi Yi stopped and looked at Jian Wushuang curiously.

“Hehe, your spear skills are ferocious. It’s like a mountain when it doesn’t move and it’s like thunder when it does. It’s considered a good spear skill but your are taking a wrong approach in this. You only focused on the movement but you forgot the most important thing in spear skill… momentum!” Jian Wushuang said calmly.

Zi Yi instantly stared with her eyes wide-open.

Her spear skill was exactly like Jian Wushuang had described. It lacked the core of spear skills, which was the existence of momentum.

One should know that she had enquired with many experts who were good with spears in Rising Sun Palace. The experts included Palace Master Chen Hu. They spent a long time observing her spear skill and asked her many questions in order to determine the imperfections of her spear skill.

But the ordinary elderly that looked extremely frail could already tell her flaws after he took a brief look and she had only performed one-fifth of her skill.

Just how experienced was he?

Zi Yi instantly understood that the person before him was a true superior. He might really be able to help her pass through the bottleneck in her martial arts journey.

“Senior, please teach me!” Zi Yi immediately bowed at Jian Wushuang politely.

“You are too stubborn when it comes to spear skill. You relied on continuous practice without putting any attention on your momentum but still reached the profound realm. You already shaped the spear skill and it would be impossible if you were to intend to master momentum from this spear skill. However, if you were to break one move in your spear skill down into two or three moves, make it from easy to difficult, slowly dissect and understand them step by step, you might be able to improvise your current situation. Then, your spear skill would be perfect, “Jian Wushuang said.

“Dissect the spear move? One move into two or even three moves? How is it possible?” It was as though Zi Yi had heard something unbelievable.

The good looking man with black hair who stood by the side was gawking too.

“What’s impossible?” Jian Wushuang smiled, “Pass me your long spear.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Zi Yi didn’t hesitate but immediately passed her long spear to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took over the long spear and started practicing in Martial Art Tower.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The spear shadows whistled but didn’t have too much force. It looked rather ordinary too.

However, Zi Yi and the black-haired man were gawking at the sight.

They saw that Jian Wushuang had performed nine moves at one goal. It was an entirely different set of moves but they could clearly feel that the nine moves were derived from the three moves from the earlier spear skill that Zi Yi performed.

The white-haired elderly really did dissect Zi Yi’s spear skill. He broke one move into three moves and every move was smooth, just like a one-spear skill.

“How, how is it possible?” There were billowing waves overwhelming Zi Yi.

After showing nine moves, Jian Wushuang stopped.

“Sigh, I’m old now. I just moved a little and I can’t take it,” Jian Wushuang patted his back and there was sweat on his face. He obviously wasn’t pretending, he really did feel weary.

“That’s it for today. You shall return,” Jian Wushuang passed the long spear back to Zi Yi.

Zi Yi held back her excitement as she bowed at Jian Wushuang politely, “Senior, I will come again tomorrow.”

“Sure, but before you see me, remember to sweep the floor in Martial Arts Tower. Although you swept the leaves downstairs today, it’ll be covered with leaves again tomorrow,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Don’t worry, Senior. I will definitely clean everything up for you,” Zi Yi was delighted.

Very soon, Zi Yi and the black-haired man left.

On the second day, the two of them came again. Just like Jian Wushuang had commanded, they cleaned up the leaves in Martial Arts Tower too.

Jian Wushuang then helped Zi Yi to dissect another three moves of her spear skill.

Then, ten days flew past. Jian Wushuang dissected Zi Yi’s spear skill entirely and Zi Yi memorized it carefully.

Then, she followed Jian Wushuang’s instructions to carefully study and comprehend them.

Half a month later, she broke through the bottleneck. She mastered the momentum and performed the spear skill flawlessly.

The news spread and the entire Rising Sun Palace was surprised.

One should know that the bottleneck that Zi Yi faced, many Palace Masters and elderlies in the palace had helped personally but they couldn’t resolve it.

But then…

Regarding her solution, the higher-ups in Rising Sun Palace asked Zi Yi personally.

When they found out that the person who helped Zi Yi resolved the problem was the ordinary elderly that had swept the floor in Martial Arts Tower, the higher-ups were astonished.

Especially when they found out Jian Wushuang’s solution was to dissect an amazing spear skill by breaking one move into three moves. They had never heard of such a solution, nor did they dare to think of it themselves. Even the Master of Rising Sun Palace found it unbelievable.

The only one who could understand would only be Chen Hu alone.

The higher-ups in Rising Sun Palace instantly realized that the elderly in Martial Arts Tower might not be an ordinary person.

Hence, the Master of Rising Sun Palace came to Martial Arts Tower personally to visit Jian Wushuang.

During his visit, there were many higher-ups of Rising Sun Palace waiting outside Martial Arts Tower. They watched the Master of Rising Sun Palace enter Martial Arts Tower and take out a broom. Then, he started sweeping the fallen leaves on the open ground below Martial Arts Tower.

It took almost an hour and he finally swept all of the fallen leaves. Then, the master of Rising Sun Palace returned to Martial Arts Tower.

Two hours later, the master of Rising Sun Palace finally walked out of Martial Arts Tower again.

But then, he couldn’t contain the joy in him.

“Superior, he is truly superior!”

“Merely a simple pointer and I suddenly see the light. My doubts have been instantly resolved.”

“In Rising Sun Palace, there is such an unbelievable superior? No wonder he could bring up an outstanding disciple like Chen Hu.”
