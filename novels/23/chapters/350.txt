Chapter 351: Venerable Master!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Breakthrough!

Jian Wushuang was making a breakthrough indeed!

When the gray waterdrop merged with his body, he started making a breakthrough.

He was different from ordinary warriors.

Ordinary warriors followed this cultivating path: the Seven Steps of the Spirit Path, Spiritual Sea Realm, Primordial Gold Core Realm, Yin-Yang Void Realm, and Divine Transcendence! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, Jian Wushuang had cultivated the Heavenly Creation Skill, so he followed a different path: the Nine Heavens of the Divine Path, Ultimate Spiritual Sea, Supreme Gold Core Realm, Yin and Yang Breaking, Venerable Master, and Flying to the Ninth Heaven.

Ordinary Warriors would reach Divine Transcendence after breaking through the Peak of the Yang Void Realm.

Jian Wushuang was an Inverse Cultivator, so he would reach Venerable Master after Yin and Yang Breaking.

The difference between a Venerable Master and Warriors of Divine Transcendence was their body.

The former had a more powerful body.

Jian Wushuang’s body was currently transforming. With every passing second it became stronger and tougher.

“I can not believe it!”

Second Holy Master’s thin face was distorted, with a flicker of coldness in his eyes. Then a stream of red power swept out. His Giant Hammer was covered by red flames, as if it were burning.

Second Holy Master suddenly stamped on the air.

The space around him shook, emitting a red wave. Then, Second Holy Master appeared in front of his opponent once again.

Boom!

The greenish black Giant Hammer smashed toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang still did not react, but his two Sword Soul Phantoms emanated a soaring killing intent, and their Sword Essence was powerful enough to destroy the mountain and river and make everything tremble. The Triple-kill Sword slashed out again, while the Sword Soul Phantoms swung their swords as well.

The moment the sword light appeared, the whole area completely turned dark.

The streak of sword light was like the king in this world of darkness.

With a hint of craziness in his eyes, Second Holy Master suddenly launched a scarlet Thunderbolt before his stroke collided with the sword light.

The Scarlet Thunderbolt moved so quickly that Jian Wushuang did not seem to have time to parry it. Boom! The Scarlet Thunderbolt lashed his chest.

His clothes split, but only a bloody mark was left on his chest.

“What?” Second Holy Master widened his eyes.

“How is that possible?”

All the spectators were stunned.

Second Holy Master’s strongest move, Scarlet Lightning, could easily smash an expert of the Saint Realm, but just now it only scratched Jian Wushuang’s skin.

The brilliant sword light continued flying forward and crashed against the Giant Hammer.

Peng!

Even though the Giant Hammer was a second-grade magic weapon, it was instantly split in half. Then the sword light continued moving toward Second Holy Master.

The collision with Giant Hammer caused the sword light to slightly change its trajectory.

Chi!

The sword light passed through Second Holy Master’s thighs. His legs were instantly cut off and then they slowly fell down.

“Hiss...” Second Holy Master suck in a breath of cold air and felt scalp tingle as if his head was about to explode.

All the spectators completely froze in shock.

Two successive strokes.

The first stroke only repelled Second Holy Master.

However, the second stroke was so powerful that it broke Second Holy Master’s magic weapon and cut off his legs.

More importantly, Jian Wushuang was still in the process of transforming.

The Spiritual Storm was still there. His aura still soared and his body was constantly being strengthened.

“Monster!”

“This boy is a monster!” Second Holy Master gritted his teeth.

Despite the pain of his severed legs, he rushed in the opposite direction under the gaze of the spectators.

He was escaping.

One of the four Holy Masters, Second Holy Master, was running away.

“This...” All the spectators were shocked, but they immediately understood.

Jian Wushuang’s battle strength was terrifying. He was much stronger than Second Holy Master. Furthermore, his strength was still improving greatly, so Second Holy Master could not kill Jian Wushuang at all. If he still stayed here, he would die after Jian Wushuang finished his breakthrough.

Second Holy Master left.

Jian Wushuang did not chase him.

His transformation continued.

Eventually, as Jian Wushuang absorbed the last hint of Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy, the whole area became quiet.

He gradually withdrew his aura.

Jian Wushuang quietly stood above the Void with two Sword Soul Phantoms behind him. No aura emanated from his body. Now he looked like an ordinary man. No one would be able to perceive his existence if they closed their eyes.

Divine Transcendence!

As for Jian Wushuang, it was Venerable Master.

He made it!

“This is Venerable Master?”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and looked serene. By now, he had completely recovered.

He had reached the peak.

When the gray stone bead emerged again and led him to make a breakthrough...

Far away from the battlefield, in a secluded canyon, in the Tang Dynasty, there was a hidden cave mansion.

A middle-aged man was sitting by a long narrow table while boiling tea in the mansion. The moment the gray stone bead emerged in Jian Wushuang’s body, the man seemed to perceive it and immediately stood up.

The next moment, his disappeared. When he reappeared, he had already arrived at the peak of a mountain in the center of the canyon. He was looking in the direction of the battlefield.

Regardless of the remoteness, the middle-aged man looked out as if he was able to see everything clearly.

He narrowed his deep eyes and mumbled without any emotion.

“Heavenly Creation Skill!”
