Chapter 100: Going Through the Dragon Gate Pass Again

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Bottleneck-breaking Elixirs offered Jian Wushuang the possibility of breaking through the bottleneck. But it might not work. Jian Wushuang thought it was normal that he could not break through if he only took one Bottleneck-breaking Elixir.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang swallowed another Bottleneck-breaking Elixir.

“I hope the second Bottleneck-breaking Elixir works.” Jian Wushuang expected.

At this moment…

“Haha. It’s so boring to drink alone.” With a bright laugh, a burly scarlet-robed man who carried a saber was walking here.

“Su Lie?” Jian Wushuang lifted his brow.

“Why are you so free to come here today?” Jian Wushuang invited Su Lie to sit down with a smile and then took out a pot of wine.

As for Su Lie, Jian Wushuang did not mind him and even had a favorable view of him.

Although Su Lie had vanquished him in front of many people, it was a fair defeat using Su Lie’s strength without any tricks or schemes. Jian Wushuang accepted it.

It was a good thing for him to be vanquished by Su Lie because he could have a deeper understanding of the Dragon Palace at least.

“Actually, it is Palace Master White that let me come here,” Su Lie took up the wine above the desk and directly said.

“Palace Master White?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“To be honest, Palace Master White has faith in you. After hearing about you comprehending the Sword Essence of Raging Fire, she immediately exhorted you not to do it. But you ignored it. She asked me to come here because she didn’t want to lower herself to exhort you again,” Su Lie said with a smile.

“Okay. I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded and said, “What Palace Master White said makes sense. However, I have my own reasons to insist on doing this.”

“I understand.” Su Lie laughed and said, “Therefore, I don’t want to remind you further. However, I have to let you know that was following the directive of Palace Master White when I competed with you last time.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was really surprised.

Was it Palace Master White that ordered Su Lie to violently compete with him last time?

“As a rookie, it might not be a good thing to be too outstanding. Therefore, Palace Master White asked me to dampen your pride. In fact, it was good for you,” Su Lie said.

“Ah?” Jian Wushuang immediately understood.

The birth of the expert was like iron tempering iron.

“So, Swordsman. Palace Master White is truly good to you. It doesn’t matter if you don’t follow her advice, but you must work hard. You should be sure not to let her down,” Su Lie said.

“I will keep that in mind.” Jian Wushuang nodded. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Haha. You should certainly do so. I have said what I came here to say. I have also drunk wine. Now, I have to leave.” Su Lie smiled and then left.

In front of the stone table, Jian Wushuang sat there alone, staring at the flagon with calm.

“What Su Lie said is right. Palace Master White is good to me. I can’t let her down.”

“Now … I should verify that the road I chose is right!”

The top rule of the world was that whoever possessed the strongest strength was the king.

Now, everyone looked down on him and regarded him as a man filled with hubris. Nobody would dare to doubt him if his strength improved to an unprecedented height.

This kind of strength needed proof.

In the Dragon Palace, the most suitable place to verify his strength was the Dragon Gate.

…

In front of the huge golden penthouse, after entering Dragon Palace, two disciples of Dragon Palace were casually chatting with each other.

“Very good. You even competed with the level keeper on the fifth floor for such a long time. You will complete the sixth floor soon.”

“Haha. Not too bad. It’s better than last time at least.”

The two disciples of Dragon Palace were on the fifth floor but their talents were just average in Dragon Palace.

Suddenly, the black-robed young man Jian Wushuang slowly walked over carrying a long sword.

“Look. Swordsman!”

“It’s him. Does he also want to enter the Dragon Gate Pass?”

The two disciples stopped and looked toward Jian Wushuang. Under their gazes, Jian Wushuang directly entered the Dragon Gate.

“He has entered the Dragon Gate! Which floor will he be able to reach?”

“At least the sixth floor. He has the strength to make it after he vanquished Nangong Jie. Now six months have passed, passing the seventh floor is not a surprise!”

The two disciples were talking. They did not hurry to leave, quietly waiting.

In the Dragon Gate, Jian Wushuang began at the fifth floor because he had gone through the fourth floor last time.

The level guardian of the fifth floor was a green-robed man who had comprehended the Earth Sword Essence.

Jian Wushuang was defeated by the green-robed man when he went through the Dragon Gate Pass first time. Now nine months had passed, Jian Wushuang competed with him again. However, the green-robed man was defeated by Jian Wushuang with just one move.

Jian Wushuang went through the fifth floor of the Dragon Gate.

Following the sixth floor…

In a magnificent palace, Palace Master White sat on a chair and flicked through a book.

The book recorded the comprehensions of a top expert. Palace Master White had been studying it closely over this period.

Although she was a master of the Dragon Palace, there were still powerhouses stronger than her in term of strength within Tianzong Dynasty. Thus, she had to continue to cultivate.

Suddenly, the gate of the palace was opened.

“Your Excellency. Palace Master.” A purple-robed servant rushed in front of Palace Master White.

“What happened?” Palace Master White put down the book and looked toward the purple-robed servant.

“It’s Swordsman. He is going through the Dragon Gate,” the purple-robed servant replied.

“Swordsman?” Palace Master White raised her eyebrows. In the past, she did think highly of Jian Wushuang. But now, the status of Jian Wushuang in her heart was lower than before. However, she still asked, “It’s not surprising for Jian Wushuang to go through the Dragon Gate because he is a disciple of the Dragon Palace.”

“He has gong through the eighth floor,” the purple-robed servant said.

“So what?” Palace Master White still did not care.

“But he went through the eighth floor merely by virtue of his Sword Essence of Raging Fire,” the purple-robed servant said again.

“What?” Palace Master White changed her expression.

If Jian Wushuang merely went through the eighth floor, Palace Master White would not be surprised. After all, Jian Wushuang could almost go through the seventh floor when he vanquished Nangong Jie. He would surely make a great progress with his talent after going outside to cultivate for six months.

Palace Master White expected Jian Wushuang to pass through the eighth floor.

However, it was totally different if he went through the eighth floor merely by virtue of his Sword Essence of Raging Fire.

It should be known that Jian Wushuang initially comprehended the sword essences of the Gale and the Earth. The Sword Essence of Raging Fire was comprehended later. She was angry about it. Jian Wushuang could go through the eighth floor merely by the Sword Essence of Raging Fire. Which floor would he go through if he also executes the sword essences of the Gale and the Earth?

“Are you sure?” Palace Master White stood and looked at the purple-robed servant solemnly.

“It’s true. The level keeper of the eighth floor told me that,” the purple-robed servant replied.

After obtaining verification from the purple-robed servant, the expression of Palace Master White grew more solemn.

“Go. Go to the Dragon Gate!”

Palace Master White forsook what she was doing and directly walked toward the Dragon Gate.

At the same time, it completely shocked the whole Dragon Gate.
