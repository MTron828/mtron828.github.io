Chapter 5336 - 5336: Domain of Extreme Cold

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The collision occurred!

It was as if a world had been flattened by a single palm, but even in this flattened world, there remained the same force of substance.

Boom!

Guangmu Tianzun‚Äôs figure was instantly forced back, and his divine body began to plummet at this moment, already reduced to thirty thousand times its original size.

His divine body, after undergoing modifications, had reached the limit of fifty thousand times, yet Bai Junwangs fist shattered his divine body in an instant, inflicting severe injuries.

Too powerful.

Comparable to the invincible gods of the past!

It‚Äôs worth noting that the gods of that era were considered invincible among Emperors, the strongest group of Emperors in their timeless river of time.

Those were Ultimate Emperors, and there weren‚Äôt many who reached that level of the Ultimate Dao.

How could Bai Junwang become so strong? If he remembered correctly, those who refused to join the Qishen Temple back then had their origin sources drained, leaving only their divine bodies thrown into the interlayer of the Four Great Secret Realms.

It wasn‚Äôt surprising that they could come out after so many years, given that the Four Great Secret Realms had been traversed. However, their formidable strength was somewhat unexpected.

After the effective strike, Bai Junwang swiftly changed his form, transforming into 3,000 streams of light that dispersed in all directions, seemingly intending to escape.

But just as he began to disperse, snowflakes started drifting down from the sky.

A few snowflakes scattered in the air!

‚ÄúThis is?‚Äù

This scene reminded him of the Lord of Extreme Cold.

A supremely powerful Universe Master.

This was the famed domain of the Lord of Extreme Cold.

Wherever he went, everything turned into frost!

The three thousand streams of light had just dispersed, frozen in mid-air. No matter how Bai Junwang moved, he couldn‚Äôt break free.

Bai Junwang revealed a relaxed expression, smiling faintly. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt escape.

In this domain of extreme cold, you are nothing more than a dead fish frozen stiff! ‚Äù

The methods of a Universe Master were beyond the calculation of an Emperor, no matter how strong.

If the gap between a Dao Lord and an Emperor was a chasm, then the gap between an Emperor and a Universe Master was like heaven and earth.

Crossing such a level was simply impossible.

If a Dao Lord defied the heavens, it was against the laws of the Dao, but if an Emperor wanted to defy the heavens, they would be challenging the celestial laws in the river of time and space.

It was simply not on the same level.

Defying the heavens as an Emperor was billions of times harder than a Dao Lord‚Äôs defiance.

In ancient times, throughout history, there was only one Emperor who could reverse the river of time and space.

That Emperor, with extraordinary talents, was thought by many to be the birth of another ruler of the starry sky. Unfortunately, in the final moments of a prematurely shortened life, her essence condensed onto the Emperor‚Äôs destiny.

She was none other than the ‚ÄòGreat Emperor Jueyun‚Äô, who had once shattered Qiuhuang City with a single sword strike, ignoring it completely.

Among Emperors, there was no one who could match her in a one-on-one battle. Even the eighteen divine generals had to stand aside.

The only one among Emperors who had obtained the title of a ‚ÄòGod‚Äô in the Qishen Temple.

The Emperor‚Äôs physique rivaled that of a Divine Master.

This formidable existence was a stroke of luck for the era, allowing countless people to witness this dazzling figure.

Characters like Bai Junwang couldn‚Äôt even make a move in the hands of such a being, let alone break through such domains.

‚ÄúBrother Guangmu, I have already informed Uzuo of the situation here. He will arrive shortly, and we just need to wait here!‚Äù Bai Yi smiled.

This treasure must not be wasted in vain.

When Uzuo arrives, he must humiliate him thoroughly, so much so that even his own people can‚Äôt look at him favorably.

There‚Äôs also Zhu Yi; she owes him a favor in the future.

Jian Wushuangs talent is outstanding. He has the potential to become an Emperor in the future, a figure with the hope of reaching the pinnacle. He cannot be easily abandoned.

Upon hearing that Uzuo is coming, Guangmu Tianzun‚Äôs face darkened.

But on second thought, he didn‚Äôt follow Qishen into the Divine Tomb. He had no right to mock Uzuo. Thinking of this, his expression eased, and he nodded in agreement.

Uzuo, who had already arrived in Liuzhou, roamed around, unable to detect Bai Junwangs aura, let alone figure out where to find him. The elders and strongmen who entered Liuzhou‚Äôs Old Palace were in the same situation, unable to find any leads.

‚ÄúIn Beishan City!‚Äù Uzuo‚Äôs gaze turned icy after receiving the message.

It was Bai Yi who relayed the information to him.

As long as Jian Wushuang is safe, everything is fine. But if something unexpected happens, Zhen Ling will not spare him.

He has now understood Zhen Lings temperament. If you go along with Zhen Ling, everything is fine; there will be no lack of status, identity, or treasures.

But if you defy even a little or fail to satisfy him, Zhen Ling will find ways to torment him.

After receiving Bai Yi‚Äôs message, he immediately informed the other strongmen from the Old Palace, and they all flew towards Beishan City in North Zhangzhou.

On the way, he also rescued Yang Sanmu from under a large mountain.

As these people headed to Beishan City together, deep beneath the surface of the celestial realm, in the roiling depths of a serene countenance, a colossal dragon surged and instantly arrived in Beishan City.

‚ÄúThe scent on this inheritor is similar to that person but not the foretold one, a practitioner of the primordial universe. What a pity.‚Äù The dragon had only one eye, which opened, spun around, and then closed again.

His true form couldn‚Äôt leave, so he could only reveal a trace of power, leaving this place and heading towards Beishan City above.

This trace of power was different from the origin of Qishen Temple or even the origin source of the Original Universe, it seemed like a force that didn‚Äôt belong here.

A force akin to a wandering dragon burst from the ground, entering the frigid domain.

Even the domain couldn‚Äôt stop it, and in an instant, it entered Bai Junwangs body.

Listen, this thread of power can only be sustained for 15 minutes. Follow the plan to head deep into Zhangzhou, then go north, cross the ancient city, and proceed to the frigid land. Someone will be there to meet you!‚Äô

Upon hearing these words, Bai Junwang was overjoyed!

He had initially thought that today would be the end, but unexpectedly, the divine beings granted him a trace of true divine power.

As the words fell, he felt that force surging into his body instantly.

‚ÄúThis power?‚Äù

The 3,000 rays that had been frozen in place instantly recondensed.

This scene astonished Bai Yi.

How is this possible?

This is the realm of extreme cold; even if those demon lords were to come, it wouldn‚Äôt be easy to escape.Finnd ùíèew chapters on nùíêve/lbiùíè(.)com

‚ÄúQuick, retreat!‚Äù Bai Yi shouted at Guangmu Tianzun once he realized what was happening.

The recondensed Bai Junwang exuded an aura that shook the heavens, a source not belonging to this world, causing even the celestial realm to tremble.

This aura surpassed that of the Emperor.

15 minutes!

It was enough. Seeing the two of them retreat, Bai Junwang had no time to engage with them; he chose to break through the void and leave,

This time, his speed exceeded the limits of space, more akin to teleportation than flight.

Teleportation within the Qishen Temple.

Teleportation wasn‚Äôt difficult; even Dao Lords could achieve it, but that was in the external world, in the original universe.

Inside the Qishen Temple, perhaps only Zhen Ling could teleport; even Zhu Yi‚Äôs casual traversing was due to possessing treasures.

Bai Junwang could teleport and easily break through the realm of extreme cold. This indicated a qualitative change in his strength, likely reaching a level comparable to a Universe Master..
