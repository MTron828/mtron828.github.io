Chapter 1204: A Big Surprise!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang waited in silence outside Dan Xin Palace but he did not have to wait long.

In just half an hour, a powerful aura burst forth from the palace. The entire palace started shaking violently.

“What?” The bald elder was startled.

“Did he succeed?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes gleamed with delight.

“Celestial Elixir! That young man is a Celestial Elixir!” The bald elder’s eyes widened in shock. In an instant, he flew into the palace.

Jian Wushuang continued to wait until Wang Yuan came out. Wang Yuan waved his hand and the grand Dan Xin Palace immediately began to shrink. He then put it away in his body.

Wang Yuan then walked over to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang smiled at him. “Congratulations, Brother Wang Yuan.”

“It’s all luck.” Wang Yuan returned his smile and then handed him an Interspatial Ring.

“What’s this?” Jian Wushuang looked at the Interspatial Ring in confusion.

“These are elixirs that I got after claiming Dan Xin Palace,” Wang Yuan replied. “The test was something that the former owner of the palace left behind. Though I’ve passed the test, I could only obtain the elixirs on the first floor of the palace.”

“The first floor?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

“There are four floors inside. The higher the floor, the more precious the elixirs are. These elixirs are the ones with the poorest quality but I think they’ll be a lot of help to Green Fire Palace,” Wang Yuan said.

Jian Wushuang immediately took the Interspatial Ring and scanned it with his Soul Power. He was surprised and happy.

He was utterly stunned. “Life Elixirs! There are so many of them!”

The Interspatial Ring was filled with elixirs and most of them were Life Elixirs! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

There were thousands of them inside!

Life Elixirs could help a Dao Master become a Celestial Master.

One pellet of Life Elixir could help foster a Celestial Master. Now, there were hundreds of them here.

“When Dan Xin Palace was born, the spirit of Dan Xin Palace intentionally threw out numerous Life Elixirs to attract experts. I knew then that there must be many more inside the palace but I didn’t expect there to be still so many.” Jian Wushuang’s body shook with excitement.

Besides Life Elixirs, there were Nirvana Elixirs of a higher level!

Nirvana Elixirs could help foster Universe Masters and there were dozens of them inside the Interspatial Ring.

Back then, Green Fire Palace and the Jin Kingdom had gone mad fighting over six Nirvana Elixirs. Many Celestial Masters had sacrificed their lives in that fight.

The number of other elixirs was also terrifying. The recovery elixirs were also particularly useful.

Together, all these elixirs were invaluable!

“This is great!”

Jian Wushuang tightly clenched his hands.”The main force of the Jin Kingdom is coming. The battle strength of our high-level experts is far weaker that of the Jin Kingdom. With these elixirs, we’ll be able to produce thousands of Celestial Masters and even dozens of Universe Masters. What a great surprise!”

Surprise!

It was undoubtedly a big surprise!

“Brother Wang Yuan, thanks a lot!” Jian Wushuang said in a solemn voice as he looked gratefully at Wang Yuan.

He expressed his thanks on behalf of Green Fire Palace and the entire Green Fire World.

“We’re brothers. There’s no need to say thanks. Besides, I’m also a member of the Green Fire World. It’s just that I’m too weak to fight with you, so this is all I can do,” Wang Yuan replied.

“No one in Green Fire Palace can match you in what you have done,” Jian Wushuang said. “Let’s return immediately.”

“Alright.” Wang Yuan nodded.

Having obtained numerous elixirs from his brother, Jian Wushuang immediately returned to Green Fire Palace.

Once he returned to Green Fire Palace, he immediately summoned the other five Palace Masters.

The original bodies of these five Palace Masters were now back in Green Fire Palace, including Tang Emperor, Sunrise Sword Emperor, and Red Lotus who had left to clean out the base of Jin Kingdom. They had destroyed as much of the foundation of the Jin Kingdom as possible.

Inside a magnificent temple.

“Jiang Wushuang, why did you summon us so urgently?” Void Temple Master asked in confusion.

“Of course, it’s something important! It’s also a great thing.” Jian Wushuang looked at the five Palace Masters in front of him with a smile before taking out the Interspatial Ring that Wang Yuan gave him. “Take a look.”

They promptly saw what was inside of the Interspatial Ring with their consciousness.

Their eyes widened.

“T-That many elixirs?” Samsara Temple Master could not help feeling shocked.

“More than thousands of Life Elixirs and dozens of Nirvana Elixirs!” Void Temple Master was equally as astonished.

“Jian Wushuang…” Tang Emperor stared at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang gave a slight smile. “This Interspatial Ring isn’t mine. Brother Wang Yuan obtained it from Dan Xin Palace.”

“Dan Xin Palace? You told us that you’d be escorting someone to take the rest. Was it your brother?” Samsara Temple Master asked.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “He’s not very strong but he’s highly talented in refining elixirs. He succeeded in claiming Dan Xin Palace even though so many failed. Unfortunately, the limitations placed by the original owner of the palace meant that he could only obtain the first-level elixirs. They’re all here.”

“This is such great news!” Samsara Temple Master was extremely delighted.

“Jian Wushuang, your brother has done a great service to our Green Fire World!” Void Temple Master added.

“Yes, a great service indeed! It’s so much greater than ours!” Tang Emperor, Sunrise Sword Emperor, and Red Lotus were also thrilled.

These elixirs would significantly promote the battle strength of high-level masters in the Green Fire World. This would give them so much more leverage in the war against the Jin Kingdom.

“We also got some Life Elixirs and several Nirvana Elixirs in the fight over Dan Xin Palace. I’ve been pondering about how to distribute them. After all, there are many who could use them to elevate their strength but the elixirs are limited. If we don’t distribute them well, it would inevitably result in grudges.”

“That problem is now solved.” Samsara Temple Master laughed. “With so many elixirs, almost every Dao Master who is certain to make breakthroughs can get one!”
