Chapter 664: Three Sword Movements

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

All the Sword Palace disciples here knew how enigmatic the three sword scars left by Palace Master Xuan Yi were.

In their view, it was not possible to fully understand the first sword scar in only half a year.

Even Ling Yu was a little surprised, but she still said, “Display it to us.”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head. As he turned over his palm, the Heart-killing Sword appeared in his hand.

The disciples surrounding Jian Wushuang immediately stepped backward.

Without much preparation, Jian Wushuang just took a deep breath and then started.

He waved his sword and began executing the three sword movements. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The first sword stroke was a straight stab and the blade possessed an unprecedented sharpness that seemed to tear through everything. As it swept through the space in front of him, the air began to hum softly.

The second sword stroke was a harsh chop. Endless power was accumulated at a point and then burst out in an instant, giving off the impression that it was invincible and could destroy anything.

Then he released a sword slash. This stroke was extremely dazzling and seemed to contain a special magic power. Even Vice Palace Master Ling Yu could not help being attracted when by the slashing movement of this longsword.

He displayed the three sword strokes, one after the other, without pause.

Then he stopped.

The whole Martial Arts Practice Field fell into complete silence. The Sword Principle disciples were endlessly shocked. Some were stunned while others were full of doubts and had a hint of ridicule written on their faces.

“Just three sword movements? As expected!”

“The first sword scar contains nine sword movements, but he only displays three. His sword movements looked strong, but he’s still far from fully mastering the nine sword movements,” a disciple who had a shallow comprehension of the first sword scar said sarcastically.

Just as he finished speaking...

“Shut up!”

Zhu Lie, who stood next to the disciple, scolded him in a low voice, “You idiot. Don’t speak nonsense when you don’t understand!”

“What do you mean?” The disciple was confused, but he quickly realized that other disciples, as well as Vice Palace Master Ling Yu, were staring at Jian Wushuang in astonishment.

The next moment, the audience burst out in an uproar.

“Three sword movements?”

“They, they’re the three sword movements from the second sword scar!”

“How... how is that possible?”

The disciples who had some knowledge of the three sword scars were stunned.

Even Vice Palace Master Ling Yu was full of unprecedented shock.

Just now they had doubted whether Jian Wushuang could display the nine sword movements contained in the first sword scar, but...

Jian Wushuang had only displayed three sword movements, but they originated from the integration of the nine sword movements.

That was to say, not only had Jian Wushuang fully comprehended the first sword scar, he had also comprehended the second one.

Just half a year.

He had comprehended the first and second sword scar in just half a year.

“God!”

Among the crowd, Zhu Lie opened his eyes wide and stared at Jian Wushuang, “I’ve been meditating on the three sword scars this whole time. It took me over ten years to fully comprehend the first one, but it’s too difficult to integrate the nine sword movements into three movements. It will take me at least dozens of years, or hundreds of years. Jian Wushuang, Senior Brother Wushuang...”

“Has he fully comprehended the first and second sword scar in just half a year?”

Zhu Lie was in a complete daze.

“Vice Palace Master Ling Yu, have I reached the requirements?” Jian Wushuang looked up at Ling Yu, who was standing on the high platform.

Ling Yu finally recovered from the shock. She glanced at Jian Wushuang in horror and immediately nodded, “Palace Master has said that those who comprehend the first sword scar are qualified to listen to his lecture in the Sword Tower. Those who comprehend the second one can be his nominal disciple. Since you’ve completely comprehended the second sword scar, you can be his disciple now. I’ll send a message to Palace Master Xuan Yi right now.”

“Thank you,” Jian Wushuang said.

Ling Yu took a deep breath and then took out a Messaging Slip.

“Palace Master Xuan Yi...” Ling Yu had just begun to talk...

“I already know. I’ll be lecturing in the Sword Tower tomorrow. Tell him to come,” Xuan Yi had already responded.

I see.” Ling Yu turned to Jian Wushuang and said, “Palace Master Xuan Yi has replied. He said for you to go to the Sword Tower and attend his lecture tomorrow. He’ll have some arrangements for you.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and then left the Sword Palace without paying any attention to the awe and admiration in the gazes of the disciples around him. He headed directly towards Enlightenment Mountain.

However, at the moment, in the sky above the Sword Palace, a man was standing quietly, his eyes gazing through the endless Void at Jian Wushuang who was walking slowly toward Enlightenment Mountain.

“In just half a year he has completely comprehended the second sword scar... He really is the owner of the Strongest Sword Soul!” The white-robed Xuan Yi stood there with his hands behind his back and a gentle smile on his face.

Sword Soul was determined by the person’s talent in Sword Principle.

The stronger the Sword Soul was, the higher their gift in Sword Principle was.

The Strongest Sword Soul meant that Jian Wushuang’s talent for Sword Principle was matchless in the world.

So it was only natural that it was not difficult for a genius with such an amazing talent in Sword Principle to fully comprehend his sword scars.

“This boy is good at Sword Principle, possesses the Strongest Sword Soul, and he has long since decided to choose me as his Master!

The moment he entered the Ancient Sect, he already understood himself and had chosen his path.

Even if many of the experts in the Ancient Sect think his choice is wrong, as long as he thinks it’s right, he’ll persist.

No matter how others think of him, he insists on his own choice.

He may look stupid and stubborn. However, such a person has real willpower!

What’s more, he has the Strongest Sword Soul, so he has a good reason to be so confident. Everyone thought that it would take him a long time to comprehend the three sword scars, but it only took him half a year to fully comprehend two of them.

He’s very confident and I like his confidence!

It seems like I’ll have another disciple soon.”

Xuan Yi murmured to himself, but the smile on his face showed that he was very satisfied with Jian Wushuang.

He brought Jian Wushuang, Feng, and Huo Ying back from the Firmament Territory Feast. He had watched their growth in the Ancient Sect during the past half year. Even though Jian Wushuang was thought to be wasting his talent in the eyes of the numerous experts in the Ancient Sect, Xuan Yi did not show up and try to persuade him to change his mind.

He wanted to see whether Jian Wushuang could persist with his own choice and not be affected by others.

It had been proven that the choice Jian Wushuang made was right.
