Chapter 238: Ku Ya

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

As soon as the weathered elder finished speaking, especially since he mentioned “Jian Wushuang”, all the people in the surrounding area broke out into heated debates.

“What did he say? Who was he referring to?”

“Jian Wushuang? That young warrior with the sword is Jian Wushuang? Jian Wushuang, the strongest person on the Earthly Dragon List?”

“The strongest genius, beyond dispute, since the Tianzong Dynasty was established!”

“A Myth! A legend!”

Everyone looked at Jian Wushuang, with eyes full of panic and shock, as well as blind worship.

Jian Wushuang was so famous in Tianzong Dynasty!

Before attending the Easternmost Hunt, he was the strongest on the Earthly Dragon List and the most talented Genius in the Tianzong Dynasty.

But after the Easternmost Hunt...

As soon as the Easternmost Hunt ended, everything that happened on the battlefield spread.

Naturally, news of his shocking battle results during the Easternmost Hunt spread.

He defeated two large empires alone.

One sword move killed 14 geniuses of the Cosmos Empire, each of which could be ranked top 5 on the Earthly Dragon List.

Finally, Jian Wushuang led the Tianzong Dynasty, a small empire, and trod over the other eleven northwestern dynasties. In the end, the top six ranks of the Easternmost Hunt were all taken by warriors from the Tianzong Dynasty.

The Tianzong Dynasty had really performed a miracle in this Easternmost Hunt.

And Jian Wushuang was the leading hero!

They heard that Jian Wushuang had also confronted and killed many assassins from Blood Feather Tower during the Easternmost Hunt, including an expert in the Yang Void Realm.

The news was spread, but it was not confirmed.

These battle records basically made him a legend.

The Millennium Chronicle, written by the Gladiator Arena, had long recorded a dozen pages about Jian Wushuang, identifying him as the most talented genius in the Tianzong Dynasty’s history.

Now, the legendary hero many warriors worshiped was standing in front of them.

“He, he is...”

On a high building nearby, Ouyang Xiu of the Ouyang clan was staring at Jian Wushuang wide-eyed.

He was unconvinced before and thought he was heavily hurt by Jian Wushuang two days ago because of his carelessness. But now, after learning about Jian Wushuang’s identity, he didn’t have anything to say.

The gentleman standing beside Ouyang Xiu seemed a little weird now.

“Is he Jian Wushuang?”

“Haha, interesting, that’s why he was able to defeat Ouyang Xiu so easily.”

“He is much stronger than half a year ago when he was in the Easternmost Hunt. I suspect he has reached the Yin Void Realm.”

The gentleman was curious about Jian Wushuang’s cultivation.

Everyone who was watching was curious as well.

At this moment the weathered elder spoke again, “Your strength has improved so much in just a year’s time?”

“I fought with you in person and still couldn’t easily defeat you. Your cultivation...” the weathered elder’s face was grim. Looking carefully, though Jian Wushuang had concealed his strength, the weathered elder was able to tell because of how close they were standing and because his own cultivation was higher.

“The Peak of the Yin Void Realm?” the weathered elder suddenly stared with his eyes wide open and said in a deep voice, “In half a year, you broke through from the Exceptional Gold Core Realm to the Peak of the Yin Void Realm. Jian Wushuang, I was contemptuous of the rumor that you were the most talented genius of the Tianzong Dynasty. But now, it seems that I have underestimated you.”

His words, husky and low, were heard by everyone in the area.

“Peak... Yin Void?”

“Can, can he really be at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm?”

“How can that be? ”

“God, it’s only been half a year. He was just in the Gold Core Realm when he attended the Easternmost Hunt half a year ago.”

“He improved from the Exceptional Gold Core Realm to the Initial Yin Void Realm, then the Profound Yin Void Realm, the Exceptional Yin Void Realm, and finally to the Yin Void Champion in half a year. My god!”

Amazing!

Everyone on the battlefield and in the surrounding area was shocked.

Everyone stared at Jian Wushuang with shocked expressions. They couldn’t help thinking that he was truly a monster.

Breaking through from the Exceptional Gold Core Realm to the Peak of the Yin Void Realm within just half a year?

No one could imagine that.

Even though everyone else was shocked, Jian Wushuang was calm. It was normal for the weathered elder to recognize him since he wasn’t wearing anything to hide his face.

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly, looked over at the weathered elder, and said, “You really are from Blood Feather Tower. May I know your name?”

“Ku Ya!” the weathered elder said.

“Ku Ya?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and said, “I’ve never heard of you.”

“Hum, warriors in Blood Feather Tower are as numerous as clouds in the sky. How could you know them all,” Ku Ya said with a snort.

That was true.

As an overlord of the Tianzong Dynasty, Blood Feather Tower did have a lot of warriors.

Grayrobe, who was in charge of the intelligence network in Blood Feather Tower, might be one of the top three influential figures, but his cultivation was only at the Initial Yang Void Realm, which was quite normal. There should be others in Blood Feather Tower who were much stronger than him.

Such as this man, Ku Ya. He was much stronger than Grayrobe.

“It doesn’t matter whether you know me or not. From today on, you will never be able to forget me, because you will die while filled with resentment towards me,” Ku Ya said while staring at Jian Wushuang with a cold expression.

“Die?” Jian Wushuang’s expression was cold as he said, “Grayrobe tried to assassinate me several times, but what was the result? It turned out that he died by my hand.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Hum, I’m not the same as that idiot. I will not underestimate a peerless genius like you, so I’ll use all my strength to kill you once I take action.”

Ku Ya slightly raised his palms and a surge of Spiritual Power gathered in them. The level of power was much greater than the Initial Yang Void Realm or even the Profound Yang Void Realm.

Ku Ya, he should be an expert in the Exceptional Yang Void Realm.

“The Exceptional Yang Void Realm?” Jian Wushuang squinted.

When he first saw Ku Ya in the Nine Emperors Sect two days ago, he knew that his strength was extraordinary.

And the quick fight he just had with Ku Ya was only for show. Neither one of them used their full strength.

Only now did Jian Wushuang realize what level Ku Ya’s cultivation was at.

While radiating a strong aura, Ku Ya tightly clenched his fists and slowly stepped forward. With each step, his aura became stronger, until it finally reached his limit.

Then Ku Ya immediately made his move.

“Jian Wushuang, prepare to die.”
