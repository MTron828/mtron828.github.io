Chapter 570: A Token

“Oh? It’s no wonder I saw Temple Master Iceberg behaving in an odd way. He was supposed to attack the monster spies, but he charged toward you instead. His real target was you,” Temple Master Black Spirit sneered.

She had noticed it when she arrived, but she did not ask any further since Temple Master Iceberg had not attacked this young man. Only now did she finally realize his true purpose.

“Temple Master Iceberg ranks within the top three in the League, so something he tried his best to get must be unusual. Those monster spies really could have come for this compass,” Temple Master Black Spirit said, then returned it to him.

“Keep it well. Don’t worry about Temple Master Iceberg. As long as I’m here, he can’t hurt you.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up immediately.

Temple Master Black Spirit might be the only one qualified to say those words.

Although Temple Master Iceberg was powerful, he was still nothing when compared to Temple Master Black Spirit.

“As for those Demonic Beasts, you don’t need to worry about them either.”

“After all, you’re still in the Human Territory. The monsters have a limited amount of strength here. This time they sent a Monster King and eight Rank Nine Monsters to kill you, but they ended up suffering a great loss, so it’s impossible for them to attack you again in the near future.”

“Right.” He laughed, but he did not feel relieved in his heart.

There is a saying: a fall in the pit, a gain in your wit.

He had learned a lesson from the previous assassination attempt, so he would not let it happen again.

“Of course, the powerful are always respected. As long as you’re strong enough, it doesn’t matter if you own heaven-defying treasure. Who’s going to covet it?

“Strength is the most important thing. Since you’re still in the Saint Realm, there’s plenty of room for you to improve, so you should aim for the Cloud Realm as soon as possible. If you do that, no one would be able to challenge you.”

Temple Master Black Spirit spoke like a senior teaching a junior how to behave.

“OK.” Jian Wushuang nodded respectfully while feeling more good will towards her.

He could tell that Temple Master Black Spirit was treating him as her junior.

“Here you are.” Temple Master Black Spirit waved her hand and threw a blue object towards the young man.

Jian Wushuang received it and found out that it was a blue token.

“Temple Master Black Spirit, what’s this?” Jian Wushuang looked over at her in surprise.

“This is my token. If you encounter any problems, you can use it to send messages to me,” Temple Master Black Spirit replied.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes shone with delight.

“If I encounter any problems, I can use it to send messages to Temple Master Black Spirit, the number one expert in the Monster-exterminating League?”

“I’m afraid few people receive such special treatment.”

“Apart from that, the token has another use.” Temple Master Black Spirit looked over at him and continued, “You can go to the fifth floor of the Earth Core Palace with this token.”

“The fifth floor of the Earth Core Palace?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

The Earth Core Palace had five floors in total.

The first four floors were designed for Origin meditation.

As for the fifth floor... it was said the relic which supported the Monster-exterminating League was on the fifth floor.

The miraculous events that happened inside the Earth Core Palace were related to this relic. Furthermore, the Bone Fusion Technique came from the fifth floor.

Levels 11 and 12 of the Bone Fusion Technique could only be found there.

The reason why Jian Wushuang yearned to go to the fifth floor was to have a look at the last two level manuals for the Bone Fusion Technique.

The requirement for accessing the fifth floor was obviously greater than that of the first four floors. No matter what realm an expert was in, he could enter any of the first four floors as long as he had enough cores. However, for the fifth floor... The Monster-exterminating League had a rule that only a Temple Master was qualified to enter the fifth floor.

But now, Temple Master Black Spirit told him that he could use this token to enter the fifth floor.

“Don’t worry. They all follow my orders because I’m in charge of the Earth Core Palace. If I say you can enter the fifth floor, then you can,” Temple Master Black Spirit responded in an absolutely confident tone. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Thank you, Temple Master Black Spirit,” Jian Wushuang said gratefully as he started to sigh in his heart.

He had underestimated Temple Master Black Spirit’s status in the Monster-exterminating League.

It was said that Temple Master Black Spirit always kept her promises and that no one dared to disobey her orders. Jian Wushuang thought it was exaggerated, but now he knew it was true.

“OK, if there is nothing else, you can leave.” Temple Master Black Spirit waved her hand.

Jian Wushuang respectfully bowed to the beautiful lady and then left.

He was tingling with excitement.

“I never would have expected Temple Master Black Spirit to have such a close relationship with Sword Ancestor. I should thank Sword Ancestor this time.”?Jian Wushuang smiled faintly while holding the token.

“The fifth floor of the Earth Core Palace... the core of the Holy Place, where the supreme relic is!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled with expectation.

Ever since he had arrived on the Monster Continent, he had heard people mention it many times. This relic was the only reason the humans could possess 10 percent of the territory while under the suppression of the monster population.

Jian Wushuang wanted to know what this relic was.

”?I’ll go to the fifth floor right now,?” Jian Wushuang thought.

At this point, he headed straight for the Earth Core Palace.

Shortly after, the other Temple Masters received the news that Temple Master Black Spirit gave Jian Wushuang a token and that the young man was qualified to enter the fifth floor with it. Most of them were calm, but a few Temple Masters were indignant about it.

Temple Master Iceberg was the angriest one.

“Temple Master Black Spirit gave Jian Wushuang a token? She allowed him to enter the fifth floor?

“How can it be?

“She severely restricted Temple Masters’ rights to go to the fifth floor. Under normal circumstances, we rarely have the opportunity to go there. However, Jian Wushuang is only a Saint Realm expert, so how is he qualified to enter?

“Unfair, it’s unfair!” Temple Master Iceberg snarled in his own palace.

He only complained about it in his own palace, not daring to say something outside.

After all, it was Temple Master Black Spirit’s decision.

Few people dared to disobey her order in the whole Monster-exterminating League.
