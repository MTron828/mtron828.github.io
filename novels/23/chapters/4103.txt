Chapter 4104: Receiving

“Senior Blood Wave.” Jian Wushuang quickly contacted Blood Wave.

“The Life Palace should have a universal passage that leads directly to the ice-snow divine kingdom. We’ll wait here for a while. The expert from the Life Palace who will receive you should be here soon,” said Ruler Heart Slayer.

Jian Wushuang and Ruler Heart Slayer were waiting quietly in the ice-snow divine kingdom.

In less than ten days…a handsome middle-aged man in a black robe appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and Ruler Heart Slayer.

!!

“Haha, Jian Wushuang, you’ve finally come to the depths of the universe.” The handsome middle-aged man in a black robe immediately let out a hearty laugh when he saw Jian Wushuang.

“You’re Senior Blood Wave?” Jian Wushuang sized up the newcomer.

The unique aura that made his heart tremble was naturally that of his Ruler. The person who could directly call his name must be Blood Wave himself.

However, although Jian Wushuang had met Blood Wave’s consciousness in the Blood Wave Realm of the Divine Beginning Realm, the Blood Wave in his consciousness at that time was only a dark figure, Jian Wushuang could not see his face clearly.

That was why Jian Wushuang tried to ask him this question.

“Haha, who else could it be?” The handsome middle-aged man in the black robe laughed. He naturally noticed the existence of Ruler Heart Slayer beside him. “Ruler Heart Slayer from the Nine Emperor Pavilion? Why are you here?”

“Supreme Blood Wave, I didn’t expect that you, the Chief Supreme of the Life Palace, would personally come to welcome this little guy.” Ruler Heart Slayer revealed a surprised look.

“Chief Supreme? Is he very strong?” Jian Wushuang could not help but ask.

“Nonsense. Although there are many Supreme-beings in the Life Palace, there are only five Chief Supremes. Those who can become Chief Supremes are all Supreme-beings. Do you think they are strong?” Ruler Heart Slayer rolled his eyes at Jian Wushuang.

“Supreme-beings?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

When he first came into contact with Blood Wave’s consciousness in the Divine Beginning Realm, he had heard from Blood Wave that he was the chief Supreme-being of the Life Palace. However, at that time, he did not have any concept of the identity of the chief Supreme-being, he thought that Blood Wave was just an ordinary Supreme-being.

He did not expect that Blood Wave was actually a Supreme-being!

A Supreme-being was someone who could establish a large divine kingdom alone. The king of the Ice and Snow Divine Kingdom and the Patriarch of the Red Cloud bloodline were both Supreme-beings.

Furthermore, Blood Wave came from the Life Palace. In other words, he was also a special life-form and had the innate advantage of a special life-form. In terms of strength, he was probably one of the strongest Supreme-beings.

“Heart Slayer, why are you with this little guy with my life divine ability?” Supreme Blood Wave asked casually.

“Not only is this little guy a member of Your Life Palace, he is also listed on the Nine Emperor List. He is a guest of the Nine Emperor Pavilion. Previously, a large Star Field suffered a devastating blow from a mysterious powerhouse. The Nine Emperor Pavilion sent me there and I met this little guy. I happened to see the people of the Cosmos Temple chasing after this little guy. I conveniently saved him and brought him to the depths of the universe.”

“Is that so?” Ruler Blood Wave raised an eyebrow, he smiled. “Heart Slayer, thank you for taking care of this little fellow. The Life Palace will remember this favor. The tree of life will bear fruit thirty million years from now. If you can pay the price, I’ll think of a way to save one for you.”

“The fruit of Life!” Ruler Heart Slayer trembled as a look of wild joy appeared in his eyes. “Ruler Blood Wave, are you for real?”

“Of course, but only if you can afford to pay the price,” Supreme Blood Wave said.

“Alright, I’ll remember it. I’ll try my best to gather enough money over the past 30 million years. Thank you, Supreme Blood Wave,” Ruler Heart Slayer said gratefully.

“You can be considered a friend of the Life Palace since you were able to save this little guy from the Cosmos Temple. The Life Palace will never be stingy with its friends,” Supreme Blood Wave said with a smile.

Supreme Heart Slayer’s was still pleasantly surprised. He glanced at Jian Wushuang, he said with a smile, “Little guy, since Supreme Blood Wave has come to pick you up personally, you don’t need me to escort you anymore. I’m leaving now. When your strength increases in the future, don’t forget what you said before.”

After finishing his words, Supreme Heart Slayer’s left in a flash.

After Supreme Heart Slayer left.

“Jian Wushuang, what did you say to Supreme Heart Slayer?” Supreme Blood Wave asked.

“It’s nothing. It’s just that Supreme Heart Slayer did save my life at a critical moment. This is a great favor. I said that if I grow up in the future, I’ll have a chance to return the favor,” Jian Wushuang said. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“It’s just a favor. It’s nothing.” Supreme Blood Wave smiled faintly.

“By the way, Senior Blood Wave, what was the divine fruit of life that you mentioned to Ruler Heart Slayer just now? Why was Ruler Heart Slayer so surprised when he heard it?” Jian Wushuang asked doubtfully.

He could tell that Ruler Heart Slayer was indeed very surprised just now.

It was just a divine fruit, and he did not give it to him for free. He also had to pay a sufficient price. was there a need for such a surprise?

“Haha, it’s normal for Heart Slayer to be pleasantly surprised. The Divine Fruit of life is unique to the Life Palace. Even in the entire vast universe, among the countless natural treasures, it is a super treasure that can be ranked in the top five. It can be said that a single divine fruit of life is enough to cause a large number of Rulers to go crazy over it. Even top-tier Rulers would go crazy over it.”

“As for Heart Slayer, he rose from slaughter. Although he’s not a Supreme-being, he’s very close to one. Once he eats the fruit, not only will he be able to reach the Supreme-being level easily, but he’ll also gain many unexpected benefits. In short, this fruit will definitely make a Supreme-being like Heart Slayer do whatever it takes,” Supreme Blood Wave said with a smile.

“This is precious?” Jian Wushuang stared at it.

He did not know what the so-called unexpected benefit was, but he could imagine how incredible this divine fruit of life was just to make it so easy for Ruler Heart Slayer to break through to the Supreme-level.

Blood Wave had agreed to leave such a precious treasure for Ruler Heart Slayer Just because he had saved his life.

“Senior Blood Wave, that divine fruit of life…” Jian Wushuang was about to speak, but was immediately interrupted by Blood Wave’s wave of his hand.

“I know what you want to say. Don’t worry. The reason why I agreed to give him a divine fruit of life is not only because he saved your life, but also because of other more important reasons. You Don’t have the right to know these reasons yet. You will know them when you become an Ruler in the future,” said Blood Wave with a smile.

“That’s good.” Jian Wushuang let out a sigh of relief.

If Blood Wave had taken out such a precious life fruit purely for his own reasons, Jian Wushuang would feel bad about it.
