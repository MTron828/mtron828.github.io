Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The time just flew by.

Nine years passed.

And there was just one year left.

Jian Wushuang finally opened his eyes after cultivating in the third layer for nine years.

“After cultivating the Universal Dao Scripture for nine years under the pressure of the consciousness attack, I have doubled my Soul Power.” Jian Wushuang was excited.

“Now your Soul Power and also your consciousness strength has reached the level of a Universe God in the Third Heaven.” King of Venomous Worms said to Jian Wushuang.

“Tian Yuan Mystery Land is indeed a good place to cultivate. No wonder everyone from the Snow Dojo was eager to come here.” Jian Wushuang thought, “There is one year left. Maybe I can go to the fourth layer.”

The fourth layer!

The most powerful and wonderful layer in the Tian Yuan Mystery Land.

Jian Wushuang was interested in what the fourth layer was about.

He stood up and moved slowly to the fourth layer.

As he stood up, the other nine Universe Gods in the Third Heaven were surprised by him.

“What does he want to do?”

They soon figured out the intention of Jian Wushuang.

“This guy wants to go the fourth layer!”

Few Universe Gods in the Third Heaven could go there except Chen Feng. Jian Wushuang, only a Universe God in the First Heaven, dared to go there?”

They couldn’t believe that.

But they saw Jian Wushuang walk determinedly to the juncture between the third layer and the fourth layer, which was only a thin barrier. Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and entered into the fourth layer.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang felt a much stronger consciousness attack soar!

Boom!

Jian Wushuang felt a roar inside his head which nearly drove him crazy, and his eyes turned blood-red. He bit his lips and resisted the astonishing consciousness attack. Finally, he crossed through the barrier.

“He crossed through the barrier?”

“He managed to do so?”

“Unbelievable…”

The other nine Universe Gods in the Third Heaven were astonished. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Though they were Universe Gods in the Third Heaven and elites in the Snow Dojo, they could only stay in the third layer. But Jian Wushuang, a Universe God in the First Heaven, got to the fourth one!

They felt ashamed.

The fourth layer of the Tian Yuan Mystery Land.

Though Jian Wushuang successfully crossed the barrier, he couldn’t move on anymore.

His face turned red. Under the effect of the consciousness attack, he felt the Soul Fire in his body was all burning, nearly exploding.

“Just hold on, Jian Wushuang. You are almost there.” King of Venomous Worms told Jian Wushang at this crucial moment.

Jian Wushuang also encouraged himself, “I have resist the Mind Test, only a consciousness attack is nothing to me!”

Under the unimaginable consciousness attack, Jian Wushuang improved his Soul Power slowly.

As he gradually improved, he felt the stress was released a little bit and he was now kept stable.

“Finally I resisted the most difficult part.”

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath.

“Keep cultivating here, Jian Wushuang and you could gain more benefits.” King of Venomous Worms said.

Jian Wushang nodded. Though he felt tired, he struggled to sit down and cultivate Universal Dao Scripture.

At the center of the Tian Yuan Mystery Land, there was a mountain made of white crystals, which looked mysterious and valuable.

Inside the mountain, a huge palace was located.

There was a lady in a robe inside the palace, keeping still for millions of years.

But at this moment, she opened her eyes and sent out a flash of purple light.

The light crossed through the mountain and the boundless heaven, helping the lady to see Jian Wushuang trillion miles away.

And the lady felt alarmed when she saw Jian Wushuang.

Amongst the thirty talents entering into the Tian Yuan Mystery Land, only Chen Feng entered into the fourth layer and walked for a long distance. His consciousness was much stronger than Jian Wushuang, who had just reached the margin of the fourth layer.

But Chen Feng didn’t draw the attention of the lady in a robe.

Only Jian Wushuang woke the lady and made her alarmed.

“The Soul Power?”

The lady in a robe said.

The lady’s words would have surprised Jian Wushuang and King of Venomous Worms if they had heard them.

After all, Soul Power was the supreme power of Jian Wushuang in the Inverse Cultivation. For many years, others often mistook the Soul Attack for the consciousness attack. Even Master of Silence Gloriette didn’t know the truth.

But now, the lady with a robe felt Jian Wushuang’s soul power without even seeing him exercising the Soul Attack.

“Only a Universe God of the First Heaven can ignite the Soul Fire?”

“It is Inverse Cultivation!”

“I could feel from his breath that he belongs to the lineage of Ancient Gods and is very prestigious!”

“A descendant of the Lineage of Ancient Gods who has passed through the First Inverse Cultivation is now in my land. Interesting!”

The lady knew immediately who Jian Wushuang was and started to ponder.
