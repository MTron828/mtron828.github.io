4898 Death Sentence Heavenly Dao

A puny little Yan Immortal wanted to fight against a Grand Yan Immortal, it was simply laughable, he was overestimating himself!

“I’ll count to three. If you retreat, I’ll let you live. If you insist on advancing, you can all stay here!” He shouted coldly, “One!”

Before he could finish his sentence, a sky-piercing sword light slashed down at him. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The sword light expanded a million feet in the wind and devoured it in an instant.

The black-robed Grand Yan Immortal’s expression changed, and he hurriedly extended his skinny palm to release his Yan energy to offset it.

Jian Wushuang, who had started this, arrived quietly at this moment. He raised the Invisible Sword in his hand and slashed down again.

“Junior, you overestimate yourself!” He was furious and waved his robe, trying to suppress Jian Wushuang with his pressure.

However, he had clearly underestimated Jian Wushuang’s strength. The black-robed Grand Evolution Immortal’s pressure did not deter him at all.

Jian Wushuang slashed his sword down and cut off his sleeve, exposing a large part of his arm that looked like a skeleton.

Seeing that the situation was not right, the black-robed Grand Yan Immortal retreated a thousand feet. He looked at his torn sleeve and then at Jian Wushuang, who had a cold expression.

He seemed to have remembered something, his dark red eyes suddenly focused, his voice raised, “You are the Yan Immortal that was rumored to have killed Chang Duoling?!”

“So what if I am? If you leave now, I can let you live,” Jian Wushuang said.

“What a joke! Let’s not talk about whether Chang Duoling died in your hands or not, just based on the current situation, is it something a puny Yan Immortal like you can stop?” the black-robed Grand Yan Immortal said coldly. “That Chang Duoling is an insignificant existence compared to me. Even if you really killed him, it doesn’t prove anything.”

“Listen to my advice. If you leave or submit to me, I can guarantee your survival.”

Jian Wushuang was getting impatient. He raised his palm and the Invisible Sword was aimed at him. Obviously, he did not want to talk nonsense with him anymore.

A Star Sword Intent slashed out, illuminating the entire shattered void.

The black-robed Grand Yan Immortal was even more shocked. Although he had doubts about Jian Wushuang killing Chang Duoling, it did not mean that he underestimated his enemy.

Therefore, he was going all out to deal with it.

Immediately, countless wisps of Death Qi that seemed to have come from the abyss surged up from under his black robe and turned into a skull that was thousands of feet in size. It opened its huge mouth and swallowed the sword strike.

Jian Wushuang stood rooted to the ground and frowned slightly. He could feel that the sword strike did not cause any substantial damage to him.

“You really have some skills, but these two skills are not enough to let you live. This seat will definitely not let you die a good death today!” The black-robed Grand Yan Immortal’s voice was gloomy.

After saying this, his body suddenly grew several feet, like a thin skeleton. Endless black Death Qi crazily seeped out.

The entire shattered void seemed to boil, turning even darker and more chaotic.

“Brother Jian, it seems like this fellow is going to use his trump card.” Chen Qing had a grave expression on his face.

Jian Wushuang did not say anything. Instead, he reached out and pushed Chen Qing thousands of feet behind him, away from this area.

“Brother Jian…”

He looked at the black-robed Grand Yan Immortal. At this moment, only the two of them were left in this area.

The void under his feet was already covered by the thick and solid Death Qi, and even the void around him was blocked.

Jian Wushuang stood in the Death Qi Formation. Although his eyes were solemn, he was not afraid!

The reason why he was not afraid was that after comprehending the Lake Style Sword Intent, it was actually a watershed.

After that, all of his Sword Intent, all of his Immortal Styles, and even his Ancestral Skills had sublimated to another level.

It could be said that the Wushuang Sword Dao and the Star River Lake Sea Sword Intent were a form of comprehension and sublimation.

Jian Wushuang was no longer the same as before. He had the strength to fight against the Grand Yan Immortal.

This was also why he had insisted on fighting Chang Duoling back then.

Only that battle could allow him to transform. Fortunately, he succeeded.

Facing the Grand Yan Immortal once again, he was somewhat calm, but he also knew his own shortcomings.

If he wanted to kill a Grand Yan Immortal again, he could only use the third move, the Lake Style Sword Intent.

However, the consumption of the Lake Style Sword Intent was too great. After using this Sword Intent, he would probably not have the strength to fight anymore.

Therefore, the Lake Style Sword Intent could only be used in the most urgent situation.

The black-robed Grand Yan Immortal seemed to have become the sole ruler of this deathly array. All the deathly energy had become his extended arms.

Two dark red lights shot out from his shriveled eyes. “Junior, become my nourishment today.”

With a cold snort, Jian Wushuang held his sword with one hand and looked at him disdainfully, “Come down and fight if you have the guts.”

Then, he raised his hands high. “A bloody battle is the most foolish method. I have never resorted to it. I control the Heavenly Dao and play with the Heavenly Dao laws, let alone a junior like you.”

“In this Immortal Death Array Formation, I am above the Heavenly Dao. I can kill you with just a thought. Now, you should obediently become my nourishment.”

Jian Wushuang felt a little unnatural when he heard the strange and excited voice.

“Next, as the Heavenly Dao, I will pass judgment on all of you!”

“Sentencing your Immortal bodies to age, from life to death. Such is irreversible!”

As the black-robed Grand Yan Immortal’s Death Sentence incantation was uttered, the entire Heaven Death Immortal Array and his domain began to distort and fluctuate.

Jian Wushuang felt an indescribable feeling from the bottom of his heart. At the same time, an even more mysterious and terrifying scene appeared.

His Undying and Imperishable Immortal Body was aging at an extremely fast pace. Fine and dense wrinkles appeared on his body. At the same time, his internal organs, which could not be seen, were weakening at the same speed!

How was this possible? At this moment, even the Undying and Imperishable Immortal Body was aging at an astonishing speed!
