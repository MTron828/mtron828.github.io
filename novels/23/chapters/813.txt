Chapter 814: Lin Wan’s Request

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Miss Wan’er, I’ve brought Swordsman here as you requested,” said the governor of the Cercis Army with respect.

“Okay, thank you, off you go,” Lin Wan said.

The middle-aged man turned and left at once, leaving Lin Wan and Jian Wushuang in the tent.

“Swordsman, do you remember me?” Lin Wan asked, smiling at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang slightly nodded.

When they were in the Blood Battle Arena, Jian Wushuang thought Lin Wan was just another ordinary Warrior like him.

As things stood, he was wrong.

The governor of the Cercis Army was an honored position on Cercis Island. No one could command him like this except for Dao Masters.

But Lin Wan had done just that.

“Good, I heard that you fought with Lei Xin of Heavenly Cloud Pavilion a few days ago. I also heard that the fight lasted for a long time and that you were not defeated. Is that true?” Lin Wan demanded.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded again.

A few days ago, the fight that had taken place between Jian Wushuang and Lei Xin on Cercis Island had caused a great stir and attracted many people’s attention.

Even though he had killed Lei Xin last night, the area they fought in was not on the island, so few people knew about it.

And, Lin Wan was clearly not among those who knew about it.

“Lei Xin is an expert at the peak of Step Five of the Eternal Realm, but you were actually able to compete with him. Although you were at a complete disadvantage, you still showed that you are quite formidable,” Lin Wan praised.

“If you have something to say, then say it.” Jian Wushuang didn’t want to talk nonsense with Lin Wan.

“Okay, I won’t keep you in suspense. I called you here because I want to ask you a favor,” Lin Wan said, then took a deep breath and put on a grave look before she continued, “Did you see the people that the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master personally met on your way here?”

“Yes, I saw them. They are the people of the Xia Clan, led by their second master, Xia Yan,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Yes, it’s about Xia Yan.”

Lin Wan’s voice suddenly turned frosty. “I have a personal, deep hatred of Xia Yan. I want you to help me beat him once.”

“That’s it?” Jian Wushuang cast Lin Wan a glance.

“Yes,” Lin Wan solemnly nodded, “Of course, you won’t do it for nothing. How about I pay you 100 million Divine Gems?”

“100 million Divine Gems?” Jian Wushuang said as his eyes narrowed.

100 million Divine Gems was not a small sum. Even a Dao Master might be tempted by it. But, Lin Wan casually put forward such a condition, and if the fact that she had commanded the governor of the Cercis Army at will was included, Jian Wushuang had a rough guess at her true identity.

Lin Wan looked at him expectantly.

100 million Divine Gems was enough to make most Eternal Realm experts act crazy or desperate.

She was sure that Jian Wushuang would be tempted by so many Divine Gems, too.

However…

“Sorry, I can’t help you,” Jian Wushuang answered in a cold and resolute tone.

He refused her offer without even considering it.

“What?” Confidence vanished from Lin Wan’s face. Evidently, Jian Wushuang’s reply startled her.

“Why? Is 100 million Divine Gems not enough? I can add more,” Lin Wan hurriedly said.

“Miss Wan’er.”

Jian Wushuang indifferently said, “We met only once before this meeting. Strictly speaking, we are practically strangers, and Xia Yan has no quarrel with me. Why should I provoke him?”

Then he continued, “Most importantly, he is the second master of the Xia Clan! I’m not foolish enough to make such a great enemy for nothing. If there is nothing else, I’ll take my leave, Miss Wan’er.”

He immediately turned and began to walk out of the tent without looking back.

“Swordsman!” Lin Wan called him from behind.

“If you think the pay is too low, just tell me you want. Whatever it is, I will satisfy you!” There was a palpable anxiety in her voice.

“How about 200 million Divine Gems, or 300 million Divine Gems?”

“If you want some treasures, just say it. What do you think of the Cercis Army? If you want, I can make you a commander, even a governor of them as long as you promise to help me!” She kept increasing the pay.

“Swordsman… ”

Now, her voice was full of entreaty.

But no matter how her attitude changed, Jian Wushuang showed no sign of stopping, still heading towards the outside of the tent.

He could see that there was definitely a deep hatred between Lin Wan and Xia Yan. Otherwise, with her identity, she would not stoop to ask him for help.

But it had nothing to do with him.

As he had said, he and Lin Wan were almost strangers and he had no quarrel with Xia Yan.

He would be a fool to offend Xia Yan and the mighty Xia Clan just to gain a large sum of Divine Gems or some other benefits.

Lin Wan clenched her hands hard and stared at Jian Wushuang. When he was about to step out of the tent, she could not help speaking again. This time she tried to goad him instead. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Swordsman, you turned out to be a coward. You really let me down!”

“I thought you were more powerful than Xia Yan and more suited to the title of the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World. Unexpectedly, you won’t even dare to have a fight with him!”

“You said you don’t want to make such a great enemy for nothing, but I think it’s just your excuse for being afraid of him and not being able to beat him!”

“You are not only afraid of him, but also afraid of the Xia Clan, and his exceptionally talented elder brother.”

“Well, it’s reasonable. After all, you are just a Divine Realm expert without any backing, while he is the second master of the Xia Clan, which is the most powerful overlord clan in the Tang of the East.”

“His elder brother is even more remarkable and is recognized as the greatest genius in the Eternal World, the youngest Eternal Realm expert in history, and may even become the youngest Dao Master in the Eternal World!”

“And his elder brother is the husband of the princess from the Tang of the East!”

“Such a big shot… ”

Lin Wan went on talking, but Jian Wushuang, who had just stepped out of the tent, stopped abruptly.

No matter what bait Lin Wan had tossed out, like the Divine Gems and the position of commander or governor in the Cercis Army, or how she tried to goad him, Jian Wushuang remained indifferent.

Even when Lin Wan said that Xia Yan’s elder brother was recognized as the greatest genius in the Eternal World, the youngest expert in the history of the Eternal Realm, and that he may even become the youngest Dao Master of the Eternal World, there was no pause in his steps.

But, when he heard Lin Wan say, “His elder brother is also the husband of the princess from the Tang of the East!” he instantly stopped.

“What did you say?”
