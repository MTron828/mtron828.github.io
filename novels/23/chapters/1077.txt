Chapter 1078: Trump card

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Celestial Master’s face darkened, then he slapped forward.

A towering red mountain blocked the way.

Swish!

However, the fierce and violent sword light sliced the mountain into two at once. Moreover, the sword light even penetrated the mountain to pound on the Celestial Master, pushing the latter several steps away.

Then, Jian Nantian brandished his longsword one more time.

This had been his third strike.

This time, he struck out quietly like a ghost. Although he had moved, no sword light or sword scar could be seen in the sky.

The Celestial Master’s countenance completely changed at the sight of Jian Nantian’s blow.

Having no time to think, he tried hard to dodge the blow at a ultra-fast speed. He had tried his best to move, however, he was only inches away from Jian Nantian’s sword.

Swish!

The sword light swooshed past his right shoulder. The Celestial Master could hear Sword Edge piercing into his body.

The strike not only pierced through him but also took down his entire right arm.

Though losing his arm, the Celestial Master did not pay much attention to it. He had been possessed by a lingering fear.

He knew that if he had been a little slower if he did not swing himself, his entire body would have been sliced into two.

“I was right. You did devise the strongest Sword Principle!”

Celestial Master Ku Xin covered his bleeding shoulder, energy floating around. Apparently, he was healing himself. At the same time, he looked at Jian Nantian solemnly.

The crowd became excited because of the Celestial Master Ku Xin’s words.

“The strongest Sword Principle?”

“… in the legend?”

“It’s no wonder Jian Nantian acted so effortless. He actually created the strongest Sword Principle.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Shock and terror seized the crowd.

“Father.” Even Jian Wushuang glanced at Jian Nantian.

Jian Wushuang had the strongest Sword Heart and did want to invent the strongest Sword Principle as well. However, until now, he had only created one Creation Level Dao and two Universe Level Daos. He was far from conjuring the strongest Sword Principle.

On the other hand, his father had succeeded.

“Having the body of the Sword Spirit, your father has been gifted in Sword Principle. Moreover, he’s been cultivating in the Secret Land for more than 100 thousand years. It’s natural that he’s succeeded in the strongest Sword Principle. If he hasn’t been suppressed when he’s weak, he would be more capable than now.” Gu King’s comments rang in Jian Wushuang’s head.

Jian Wushuang agreed.

He had only heard about the Strongest Sword Principle in tales. After all, compared to the Creation Level Dao, it was much more powerful.

Jian Nantian combined the strongest Sword Principle and other two Creation Level Daos. Three Daos were joined to create an Immortal Dharma Body, which was much more capable than an ordinary Celestial Master in Exceptional Realm.

“I didn’t see it coming.”

The Celestial Master exclaimed regretfully.

“The one who was cast out by our Ancient Demon Clan 2,000 years ago, who was deemed a shame of our bloodline, has actually invented the strongest Sword Principle!”

“Moreover, you actually pushed our clan to such a plight!”

“Since the establishment of our clan, it was only once when we’ve been injured like this. We have played our ultimate trump card to survive. Now, it looks like that we have to use it for the second time.”

The Celestial Master’s words made the present experts look astounded.

They had fought so violently, and yet he still held a trump card?

Moreover, an ultimate trump card?

What exactly was the ultimate trump card?

They knew it soon.

Then, Celestial Master Ku Xin sneered and thumped on the city of the Ancient Demon Clan several times. All his thumps had been eccentric, and his eyes turned scarlet.

“Let the Blood Spring rise!”

The Celestial Master shouted and immediately, deep in the ground, a blood-curling energy rose up.

It was the Bloodline Power!

A large number of overwhelming Bloodline Power from under the ground. And the next moment, they surged in the Celestial Master’s direction.

“What, what is that?”

The crowd froze at the scene.

The Bloodline Power was too much and too powerful.

Nevertheless, Celestial Master Ku Xin had actually managed to swallow all of them at once.

Base on the abundant power, his aura skyrocketed again to an unprecedented level.

His body expanded as well, with red clouds rolling around him. Terrifying Killing Intent swooshed past in all directions.

“His aura is so mighty.”

At present, Jian Wushuang put on a serious face as well because he could clearly sense the increase of the Celestial Master’s aura.

His aura even exceeded a Celestial Master’s level. Of course, he still failed to match Samsara Temple Master, Void Temple Master, and Dao Yuanzi.

He seemed to be ranked between Celestial Master and the Supreme Level.

However, Jian Wushuang was positive that Celestial Master Ku Xin had tremendously increased both his aura and his strength.

“They do have an ultimate trump card.” Gu King’s voice rang again.

“If I’m not mistaken, the immense Bloodline Power must have been extracted from dying experts.”

“The Ancient Demon Clan has lived for long on Samsara Continent. There have been numerous Dao Masters in their history; it was possible that they collected so much Bloodline Power with special methods to create a pure Blood Spring.”

“The immense Bloodline Power has been mixed in its creation and bears hazardous substance. The Celestial Master will consume the toxic substance as well if he just swallows like that. That being said, he will indeed be much more capable temporarily. Just like now.”

Hearing these words, Jian Wushuang nodded solemnly.

He had tried directly swallowing Bloodline Power as well. Thus, he knew too well of the result.

The hazardous attempt would immensely affect one’s body. The more he swallowed, the more vulnerable he would become.
