Chapter 1999: Trampled!

Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!

There were continuous sword lights that whistled out from Jian Wushuang’s eighteen arms.

Simultaneously, there were five Hong Jun Golden Swords that attacked at terrifyingly fast speed.

Besides some trump cards, Jian Wushuang gave full play to his fighting power.

One should know that Jian Wushuang was Master Wu’s match when he fought force with force back then. He had yet to perform nine head eighteen arms then as well.

In other words, the fighting power that he revealed was much stronger than when he had fought with Master Wu.

It was hard to call a victory or defeat when Master Wu, who was in the eighth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, fought with Jian Wushuang, who revealed such power. Let alone Yan Zun who was at the bottom of all Great Emperors…

Of course, it was unstoppable!

Hence, there was no suspense in the battle.

Yan Zun was suppressed entirely since the very beginning. In merely a short while, the situation had become a one-sided trampling.

Yes, he was ruthlessly trampled on.

Jian Wushuang put his full fighting power to play and ruthlessly trampled on Yan Zun.

Although Yan Zun was angry and aggrieved, he couldn’t find any opportunity to counter-attack under Jian Wushuang’s Hong Jun Golden Sword and close combat. The vast difference in terms of strength and power suppressed him completely and he was devastated.

Many people saw that battle.

The place where they fought was near to the buildings. There were many experts from Sanctuary Alliance who flew above the buildings to watch in the void.

Swoosh!

A chubby, bald young man stood at the border of the battlefield.

“These two… Sword Emperor and the other one is Yan Zun? What’s going on? Why are the two of them together?” The bald young man looked shocked.

“It seems that Sword Emperor came to visit and said that he wants to challenge Yan Zun. Then, this happened,” the Sir God next to him explained.

“Sword Emperor challenged Yan Zun? I have never heard of Yan Zun offending Sword Emperor though. Why did Sword Emperor come to challenge him? How is this a challenge? He is obviously trampling on him!” The bald young man exclaimed.

“Who knows. Anyway, Yan Zun is doomed,” the Sir God sighed.

The surrounding experts from Sanctuary Alliance were then complimenting and sighing.

They first complimented Jian Wushuang’s power.

They never expected that Jian Wushuang’s fighting power would be that strong after the breakthrough. He could suppress Yan Zun with thunderous measures.

On the other side, they pitied Yan Zun.

Yan Zun looked too pathetic then.

Jian Wushuang suppressed him and ruthlessly trampled on him. Even though he was angry, he couldn’t do anything about it.

At the same time, they were trying to guess what had happened between Yan Zun and Jian Wushuang as well.

From their viewpoints, the two of them definitely shared deep enmity and thought it must be that Yan Zun had offended Jian Wushuang somehow or other. Otherwise, Jian Wushuang absolutely wouldn’t ruthlessly trample on Yan Zun in front of so many people.

It was legit give him tight slaps in public.

“Sword Emperor, I lost this battle. Hurry up and stop,” Yan Zun had admitted defeat long ago.

However, Jian Wushuang pretended to not hear. He never stopped his actions but continued to trample on him mercilessly.

Yan Zun was furious.

At the border of the battlefield, Great Emperor Tian Yue was astonished too.

He was astonished because of the power that Jian Wushuang displayed.

“Although Yan Zun is at the bottom in all Great Emperors, there is no doubt about his power. However, in front of Sword Emperor, he couldn’t even counter attack but is suppressed entirely and trampled on mercilessly. Jian Wushuang’s power…” Great Emperor Tian Yue squinted his eyes and understood the power of Jian Wushuang.

There’s no doubt that Jian Wushuang had the fighting power of a Great Emperor.

Among all Great Emperors, he wasn’t at the bottom but at an average level, or even above average.

But he had just broken through?

The battle between Jian Wushuang and Yan Zun lasted for fifteen minutes. In other words, Yan Zun had been trampled on for fifteen minutes.

Jian Wushuang finally stopped.

Swoosh!

Yan Zun instantly became a flowing light and burst out. Then, he kept his distance from Jian Wushuang.

When he looked at Yan Zun, Yan Zun had already lost his composure. His hair was messy and the armor he wore had faint white dots that were left behind by Jian Wushuang. On top of that, he looked extremely pale and there was blood at the corner of his lips.

He looked like he was in a fix.

“B*stard!”

Yan Zun clenched his fists. His eyes were looking at Jian Wushuang and burning with fire.

When one’s power reached such a level, they would care most about their reputation.

Then, he was ruthlessly trampled on before everyone by Jian Wushuang and he was trampled on for so long. His reputation was all gone.

Then, there were suspicious gazes around him. There were even people smiling smugly at his failure. He was dying to find a place to hide.

He naturally clenched his teeth with hatred of Jian Wushuang, who had caused all of this to happen.

“Yan Zun, goodbye!”

Jian Wushuang let out a burst of hearty laughter and then left.

The surrounding experts were confused at the sight.

From the beginning until the end, Sword Emperor didn’t reveal the reason why he had challenged Yan Zun and trampled him so badly.

As for the reason he mentioned about verifying his power after his breakthrough, no one believed that.

As Jian Wushuang left, no one continued to ask but immediately spread the news.

Jian Wushuang had already broken through. He had become an Almighty from a Real God. After he broke through, he found Yan Zun, who was at the bottom among all Great Emperors, and challenged him. Then, he had ruthlessly trampled on Yan Zun with thunderous measures.

The moment the news spread, all experts in Eternal Chaotic World received the news in an instant.

Very soon, there was more news. It was about the fight between Jian Wushuang and Master Wu in Jiu Jue Sword Mansion.

Jian Wushuang and Master Wu had fought face to face. In the end, they were evenly matched. The news once again proved Jian Wushuang’s power.

In Eternal Chaotic World, there were many experts who were astonished.

They knew that Jian Wushuang would definitely improve greatly in power once he had a breakthrough and become an Almighty, but they had never expected him to improve so tremendously.

He had just broken through and he could be evenly matched with Master Wu and could trample on Yan Zun.

The others had already recognized his power. Jian Wushuang could be in the top ten on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list!!
