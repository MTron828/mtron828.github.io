2045 Anger

Shatter.

When the top experts from Three-Emperors World, who were rushing over, saw the scene where the Emperor Supreme Rock had shattered, their eyes were wide open.

Some of the Great Emperors even stood there dumbfounded.

Emperor Supreme Rock… That was the Holy Crystal that the Three-Emperors World worshipped.

Over the years, it had been towering within the golden whirlpool. It could be said that everything in Three-Emperors World relied on the Emperor Supreme Rock.

But then, the Emperor Supreme Rock had shattered?

“No!!!”

The beast-like bald man, Ling Zong, let out a hysterical roar.

His eyes were filled with boundless murderous intention and he looked at the figure located in the depths of the golden whirlpool.

Coincidently, the figure turned around to look at Ling Zong and the others who were there.

Their gazes met.

Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Everyone in Three-Emperors World, long time no see. How have you been?”

When the Great Emperors from Three-Emperors World saw Jian Wushuang, they were instantly stunned.

“Jian, Jian Wushuang?”

“It’s him? How could it be possible?!”

“Impossible!!! He died! We killed him. He died right in front of us. How could he be alive?”

There was one hysterical bellow after another.

The Great Emperors couldn’t believe what they were seeing.

They had seen Jian Wushuang’s divine body collapse with their own eyes and he was dead.

But then…

“Jian Wushuang didn’t die?”

“Not only did he not die, but he has been hiding in the golden whirlpool. Now, he has even destroyed the golden whirlpool and the Holy Crystal!!”

“D*mn it!!!”

After astonishment, everyone was raging with anger!!

Anger!!

The way the Great Emperors from Three-Emperors World looked at Jian Wushuang showed their murderous intention.

They wanted to tear Jian Wushuang apart!!

“D*mn it. Die!!”

After a loud scream, the three Great Emperors who were guarding the golden whirlpool plunged towards Jian Wushuang under the lead of the redheaded elder.

They were the closest to Jian Wushuang. Naturally, they were the first to take action. As for Ling Zong and the others, they had yet to reach the scene.

Looking at the three Great Emperors charging at him, Jian Wushuang lifted the corners of his lips and formed a cold smirk.

Blood Mountain Sword in his hand drew a unique arc in the void in front of him.

The shrill, cold sword light appeared in front of the three Great Emperors almost instantly.

The stroke that Jian Wushuang performed was the move that focused on speed the most in Xuan Luo Sword Principle, Turn Monstrous At One Thought.

As it was a move that focused on speed the most, it was traveling forward with a terrifying power then.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

There were three clangs and the three Great Emperors who were charging at Jian Wushuang suddenly stopped. Then, they even took a few steps back.

Yes.

With one stroke, the three Great Emperors were beaten off.

“How is this possible?”

The three of them looked up in astonishment.

Jian Wushuang continued to smile. Then, his figure went illusionary and he wielded his sword again.

Then, Jian Wushuang performed the most powerful move in Xuan Luo Sword Principle, Blast Rainstorm.

Hong!

It was a move like strong wind with the momentum of rainstorm.

As Jian Wushuang performed it with divine power, the power became even more ridiculously powerful.

“Let’s fight against him at the same time,” the redheaded elder immediately roared with a flash of terror in his eyes.

The three Great Emperors were experienced. They naturally could tell how powerful Jian Wushuang’s stroke was. Hence, they immediately took action together to block.

The three of them joined forces to resist Jian Wushuang’s stroke.

But in the end…”Humph!”

The three of them let out a muffled humph at the same time and they flew backward from the impact. Besides the redheaded elder, the other two had blood flowing out of the corners of their lips.

“He is so powerful?” The redheaded elder was astonished.

However, when Jian Wushuang performed the sword principle to attack the three of them, his other hand, which had been left idle, casually slapped in the direction in which the three of them had retreated.

The slap immediately brought about a terrifying handprint that seemed to contain boundless reincarnation.

It was the Reincarnation Palm that Jian Wushuang comprehended!

The palm covered the void where the three of them were. The three Great Emperors couldn’t dodge at all.

Hong!

The universe became silent and the entire void cracked.

The three Great Emperors that were engulfed by the Reincarnation Palm turned into flowing light and burst out. As they burst out, their faces grew pale and their auras were obviously much weaker than before.

In merely two breaths of time, the three Great Emperors who had besieged Jian Wushuang were severely injured.

Just then, Ling Zong and the others rushed over at their top speeds from Imperial Cabinet arrived.

“Jian Wushuang!!!”

Ling Zong stared and his face distorted. He was just like a raging lion.

He roared and charged to the front. He instantly turned into a huge beast and pounced at Jian Wushuang.

Just as he approached Jian Wushuang, he clenched his battle-axe with both his hands.

Vroom. The color of the universe changed.

There was a huge, dark terrifying axe shadow that appeared in the void above. It was slashing at Jian Wushuang.

When the axe shadow descended, it broke the universe apart and it became Yin and Yang.

Jian Wushuang was right below the terrifying axe shadow.

He lifted his head and took a look at the descending axe shadow. Then, he smiled faintly.

“We shall see if your axe skill is great or if my sword principle is stronger by a notch!!”

Jian Wushuang said and wielded his sword.

A resplendent sword shadow suddenly lit up.

Xuan Luo Sword Principle, the one that focused on power the most… Blast Rainstorm!!

The same Sword Principle performed by the same person. However, the difference was that Jian Wushuang had let his divine power and his ancient tribe bloodline power pour out to his limit.

His power and strength, which were above any ordinary Great Emperor’s, exploded.

Bang!

There was a loud bang.

Both parties collided in the void. Then, a huge spacetime black hole spread open mercilessly. In an instant, it swallowed the surrounding universe.

The surrounding void drowned within.

In the middle of the spacetime black hole, there was a figure that staggered and retreated. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He took more than a dozen steps back and every single step was ten thousand li apart. He finally stopped with great effort.

This person was the beast like a bald man, Ling Zong!!!

“This, this…”

Ling Zong looked at his quivering battle-axe after he steadied himself. He was greatly astonished.

He couldn’t believe everything that had happened.

He went all-out to compete for power against Jian Wushuang, and he’d lost?

He’d retreated from one stroke of Jian Wushuang’s attack.

How was this possible?

“This b*stard!”

Ling Zong stared at Jian Wushuang.

In his head, he recalled the two times when he’d came across Jian Wushuang.
