Chapter 1765: Flowers Bloom And Fade

“I will definitely die? From just the few of you?” Jian Wushuang laughed nonchalantly and disdain flashed in his eyes.

At that moment, although there was a total of four Almighties standing in front of him, among the four of them, only Sir God Qing Fu who stood in front had the right to catch his attention. As for the other three, they were merely normal Sir Gods. Hence, such a lineup was unable to make Jian Wushuang feel worried.

“The four of us are enough to kill you.”

Sir God Qing Fu had a great amount of aura. After giving a furious cry, his body was the first to move.

At the same time that he moved, a double-edged, giant axe appeared in his hands. While releasing Divine Power, Sir God Qing Fu held the giant axe with both his hands and raised it high in the air.

Rumble~~~ A towering axe shadow appeared out of thin air at the top of the void.

The axe shadow then swung out and it looked as though it could split heaven and earth apart.

When the axe shadow was swung, the whole universe became dead silent.

Everyone present was staring at the axe shadow persistently and their eyes were filled with shock.

As for Jian Wushuang, he wore an indifferent smile. After taking a glance at the giant axe shadow which was heading toward him, he swung the sword in his hands immediately.

He did not unleash a strong sword move. He merely swung his sword which was imbued with Reincarnation Power and most importantly… his Ultimate Divine Power.

Bam!

With a loud sound, the giant axe shadow shook violently and dissipated right away.

Within the sea of dispersed Divine Power, an ice-cold sword light was still moving heartlessly and it headed straight to Sir God Qing Fu.

Sir God Qing Fu’s expression changed greatly and he placed his giant axe in front of his chest immediately.

Clang!

Another loud sound could be heard and Sir God Qing Fu’s body was sent flying instantly. While he was flying, he rolled about continuously and it was only after a long time that his body stopped moving.

After stopping, Sir God Qing Fu’s body shook and he spit out a huge mouthful of blood with a “wa” sound. His expression turned pale at once.

When everyone from the Soaring Heaven King Palace saw such a scene, all of them turned pale with fright.

Among the many experts of the Soaring Heaven King Palace present, Sir God Qing Fu was one of the most powerful people and he was a top Sir God.

Even though the experts from the higher-ups of the Soaring Heaven King Palace knew that Jian Wushuang had unleashed shocking abilities to kill Sir God Chi Xing with one palm, they had still thought that Sir God Qing Fu could suppress Jian Wushuang. Moreover, no matter what, he would still be able to fight with Jian Wushuang head-on at the very least.

However, when the both of them fought for real… with one face-off, Sir God Qing Fu had sustained serious injuries!!

“Too strong. His power is too strong!” Sir God Qing Fu exclaimed with admiration.

He did not know that as soon as Jian Wushuang had achieved Stage Three Ultimate Real God, his abilities and body underwent a transformation and both of them had achieved the level of an Emperor God.

In order words, in terms of power alone, he was not inferior to an Emperor God at all.

Previously, in the Sea City, for him to be able to kill Sir God Chi Xing with a palm, apart from the fact that the Reincarnation Palm was already powerful to begin with, the most important thing was the suppression in terms of power.

Emperor Gods and Sir Gods were one step away from one another. However, the difference in terms of their powers was like heaven and earth!

“Jian Wushuang’s abilities are too frightening and they are definitely not inferior to that of a real Emperor God. In a one-to-one fight, no one among us is his opponent. Quick, use that move!” Sir God Qing Fu suppressed his blood and Qi with force and shouted furiously. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The three remaining Sir Gods of the Soaring Heaven King Palace reacted. Together with Sir God Qing Fu, they unleashed a special hand print toward the ground below them.

“Big formation, rise!”

Rumble~~~

The ground shook.

At that moment, the whole Soaring Heaven Mansion seemed to be alive.

Crack, crack!!!

Cracks appeared on the ground and green vines came out of them.

There were a huge number of vines and they were spreading with shocking speed. In an instant, they covered the ground of the whole Soaring Heaven Mansion completely and brilliant green light illuminated the area. At the same time, a great amount of life emerged and the whole universe became filled with life.

“A formation?” Jian Wushuang was looking at the scene below him as well as the infinite amount of murderous intent around him. He raised the corners of his mouth immediately, “Interesting.”

Jian Wushuang was not worried in the slightest bit.

It should be known that back then in the Buddhist Demon Sea, even though five Sir Gods had teamed up and unleashed the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts, they were unable to do anything against him in the end. Instead, they were defeated by him and he had even killed one person on the spot.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang’s abilities were greater than before.

The four Sir Gods of the Soaring Heaven King Palace were standing on the ground which was covered by the green wines and just like before, Sir God Qing Fu was standing in front. Moreover, their bodies were covered by the green vines and it looked as if they had fused with the big formation. With that, the only thing that was revealed were the eyes of the four of them.

These four pairs of eyes were currently staring at Jian Wushuang closely and they were filled with an infinite amount of murderous intent.

“Jian Wushuang, I admit that you are very powerful. However, it’s a pity that you are too arrogant!” an ice-cold voice could be heard from Sir God Qing Fu.

“By staying somewhere in the Sea Continent, even if you were to kill the experts of the Soaring Heaven King Palace wantonly, the Soaring Heaven Mansion will be unable to do anything against you with its power. However, it’s a pity that you have taken the initiative to come to us. In the Soaring Heaven Mansion, with the aid of the big formation, the four of us can even fight against a real Emperor God. And you… will die for sure!”

“Die!”

Sir God Qing Fu’s eyes glowed will a shrill light.

“Flowers, bloom!”

Buzz~~~ Amidst the uncountable number of vines, a brawny green vine appeared.

The speed of that vine was extremely fast. When it appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, it started to transform straight away.

An exceptionally beautiful, giant green lotus flower bloomed and it contained an unbelievable amount of aura of life. As soon as it bloomed, it covered the whole Soaring Heaven Mansion.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes squinted. When he looked at the green lotus flower below him, he did not feel that the green lotus flower was dangerous.

At that moment, Sir God Qing Fu shouted again.

“Flowers, fade!”

Boom!

The universe shook.

The Soaring Heaven Mansion, which was originally filled with life, was replaced by an infinite amount of dead energy in a split second.

The innumerous number of vines on the ground below him started to wither immediately. At the same time, the gigantic green lotus flower withered. However, as the green lotus flower withered, it drew everything to itself fiercely. Naturally, Jian Wushuang was drawn in as well and the green lotus flower became a flower bud.

The flower bud withered at an extremely fast speed and even its life was depleting madly.

“My life force is being depleted quickly?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed fiercely.

He finally understood the strange thing about the big formation. The formation possessed the ability to transform life into death.

“If I am unable to destroy this lotus flower completely and get out, even if it’s me, my life will be totally sucked dry and I will die here,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Although his body contained the King of Venomous Worms who could help him to recover, the King of Venomous Worms’ recovery ability was obviously incomparable to the speed that his life was being depleted at.
