Chapter 5310: Grave God Mountainbender

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The one-armed man with a broken sword was once a sword cultivator of Shangqing Palace, dominating the Dao Lord realm in the Northern Region with unmatched talent.

He was the top figure among the younger generation of Shangqing Palace, and after successfully merging with the Dao, he possessed the strength of a tier 3 peak Emperor. The tier 4 Emperor realm was just a step away.

Initially, everyone believed he was the future pillar of Shangqing Palace, destined to reach the fifth-tier Emperor, and even tier 6 was within his grasp.

His origin source was exceptionally powerful, capable of slaying Emperors even during his Dao Lord days.

At the tier 3 peak, he could suppress and defeat tier 4 Emperors effortlessly.Y√¥ur fùíÇvorite stories on ùíè/o/(v)ùíÜ/lbùíän(.)cùíêm

His mastery of the sword was the Myriad Swords Dao, a peerless technique where one sword could unleash a thousand killings, making him invincible among peers.

Such a formidable cultivator ultimately ended up in such a state.

Demoness? Holy Maiden? Bailuo Sect! All of this seemed to be related to that woman.

Nie Yuan!

Jian Wushuang had seen him in Sharuo City, where his conspicuous broken sword caught the attention of a fellow sword cultivator. At that time, Nie Yuan appeared somewhat desolate, devoid of the aura of a sword cultivator, so Jian Wushuang didnt pay much attention.

Little did he expect that Nie Yuan would face such tribulations.

It was a pity.

Swish!

As Jian Wushuang turned his head, the old man with goat horns sat to his right. To the right of the old man was supposedly the position of the current owner of Shangqing Palace. However, the seat on his left had remained vacant.

Now, a young man in a flowing sword robe smoothly took the seat.

Jian Wushuang recognized him as Elder Jiu Jian, the one who had received them upon their arrival.

Elder Jiu Jian was the youngest among the nine current Sword Elders of Shangqing Palace, possessing immense potential and standing as a peak expert among tier 5 Emperors.

Rumors had it that Elder Jiu Jian had the potential to become the Sword Sovereign in the future, inheriting the position of the Shangqing Palace Master.

If not for the unexpected visit of Jian Wushuang and the old man with goat horns, this person might have been next in line for the position of the Shangqing Palace owner.

Elder Jiu Jian! Jian Wushuang immediately clasped his hands in salute, expressing gratitude for the warm reception.

Friend Wushuang, theres no need for such courtesy. The fact that you and

Senior Yang could come to Shangqing Palace is our good fortune! Elder Jiu Jian was modest and humble, a demeanor not commonly seen, even with someone of Jian Wushuangs background.

Jian Wushuang didnt have much of a background; he was just an ordinary inheritor. His luck, however, shone brighter as he gained the favor of Shan Jun.

Through a series of fortunate events, he accidentally created the Tenth Refinement of his physical body and acquired the Qishen Jade Tablet bestowed upon him by Zhen Ling.

Later on, he earned the appreciation of Wu Zuo, and accompanying him was the formidable tier 5 peak Emperor, the old man with goat horns, whose strength was unfathomable, and his collection of treasures was beyond imagination.

Despite these reasons, Jian Wushuang never considered himself worthy of sitting alongside a tier 5 Emperor, let alone a tier 6 one. In the Original Universe, even a tier 4 Emperor like Zhen Wuyang was a towering figure, let alone individuals of this caliber.

I observe, Friend Wushuang, that you are also a swordsman, and your origin source is remarkably powerful. May I inquire about your lineage? Elder Jiu Jian asked.

In truth, he had always been puzzled. Jian Wushuangs origin source was elusive to him, but the emanating aura indicated Emperor-level strength, even though Jian Wushuangs cultivation level was only at Nine Revolutions. It was a perplexing situation.

Furthermore, the palace master had warned him to be cautious in hosting these two guests, not only because of the presence of the esteemed Lie Huo.

In Liuzhou, although Venerable Lie Huo was domineering, it hadnt reached the point of suppressing them.

The Patriarch of Shangqing, with strength comparable to the Venerable Lie Huo and even slightly stronger, had no reason to be so cautious just because of a word from Venerable Lie Huo!

He also took this opportunity to probe and explore Jian Wushuangs details.

When Jian Wushuang heard the inquiry from Elder Jiu Jian, for a moment, he didnt know how to respond. He couldnt just say that he came from another universe!

At the moment of his hesitation, the old man with sheep horns raised his eyebrows and transmitted to him, Tell him youre from the Grave God

Niountain.

Grave God Mountain?

Where is that?

He didnt have time to think about it in detail and answered, 1 1 come from the

Grave God Mountain in the Gods Tomb Secret Realm!

Jian Wushuangs voice wasnt too loud, but everyone present, each with keen senses, heard the three words Grave God Mountain.

Grave God Mountain!

Elder Jiu Jian suppressed the shocked expression on his face.

Among the Four Great Secret Realms, it was said that the Heaven Realm was the leader, but in terms of top-notch strength, the Gods Tomb Secret Realm was undoubtedly the strongest.

Legend has it that the Four Great Secret Realms were all built around Grave God Mountain Mountain, where a Divine Master sleptthe god of creation!

And the White Tiger Temple was the guard of that Divine Master.

There were also the legendary guardians, each of whom possessed immense strength, capable of killing even tier 6 Emperor in existence.

Many Emperors knew these legends, especially about Grave God Mountain, a place more formidable than the temple.

Countless people once rushed to the Gods Tomb Secret Realm, wanting to explore Grave God Mountain.

Unfortunately, to this day, no one has been able to reach Grave God Mountain. Most of them fell midway, whether they were tier 5 or tier 6 Emperors, not a single survivor emerged.

Jian Wushuang observed their shocked expressions and then turned to the old man with the goat horns.

So, thats how it is.

You, as inheritors, will eventually enter the Four Great Secret Realms and go to the Grave God Mountain. Afterwards, youll settle in the Elder Palace of the White Tiger Temple. However, in terms of status, you are considered to originate from the Grave God Mountain! explained the old man with goat horns.

Jian Wushuang communicated through telepathy, asking, Senior, what exactly is on the Grave God Mountain? Is it truly the place where Qishen attained enlightenment?

The old man with goat horns simply shook his head silently. He truly did not know.

Perhaps only the masters of the Four Temples would be aware of the hidden details. These individuals were the core of the Qishen Temple. Although Zhen Ling was in control, it was a later evolution.

In the past, many matters were entrusted to the Four Temples by the Qishen, and this was why the Four Temples dared to challenge Zhen Ling.

However, now the authority of the Four Temples had begun to decline, and Zhen Ling was the sole controller.

Elder Jiu Jian initially thought that Jian Wushuang might be a descendant of a senior figure within the White Tiger Temple. He never expected that he hailed from the mysterious Grave God Mountain.

For a moment, Elder Jiu Jian became more reserved and humble, not daring to display even a hint of arrogance.

Other Emperors, when looking at Jian Wushuang, showed a tinge of envy in their eyes.

No wonder that Dao Lord was so formidable, able to command such respect from Shangqing Palace; it turned out he came from the enigmatic Grave God

Mountain.

These people soon calmed down. Over the years, the information about the Grave God Mountain had become more widespread. Many powerful beings had emerged from the Gods Tomb and entered the secret realms of the

Heavenly Realm. However, those beings were all formidable, possessing Special Llfe Forces, and were among the most elite among the tier 6 Emperors.

People held a certain fear and concern for those from the Gods Tomb Secret Realm, especially those from the Grave God Mountain.

In the last row, Nie Yuan, upon hearing the three words Grave God Mountain, had a sudden change in his expression and immediately stood up.

Grave God Mountain!

He, too, had been a direct disciple of an ancient sect like Shangqing Palace and naturally knew about the Grave God Mountain..
