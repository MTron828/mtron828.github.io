“Little guy, you can take a closer look at this task. You have 10 years. In 10 years, before the opening of the Blood Wave Realm, if you can complete the task alone, you can compete with Duan Lang for the last slot. But if you can’t complete the task within 10 years, the last slot will be given to Duan Lang. Do you understand?” Temple Master Bai Xing stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

“Remember, do it alone. I’ll wait for your news.” After saying that, Temple Master Bai Xing turned around and left.

Jian Wushuang looked at the mission scroll in front of him and fell into deep thought.

“According to Temple Master Bai Xing, the Blood Wave Realm only opens once every 100,000 years. The opportunity contained in it is enough to make any Immortal Saint go crazy. In other words, this opportunity must be very useful to me!

“If I miss it, I have to wait another 100,000 years before I get a second chance.” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

100,000 years was too long.

He had only appeared in this life for about 1,000 years. Naturally, he could not wait another 100,000 years for nothing.

“I must seize this opportunity. I must complete this experiential mission.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands. “However, Temple Master Bai Xing has given me a ten-year time limit, so there’s no need to rush. I’ve just reached the fourth stage of comprehending the space-time principles and have just mastered teleportation. Before I complete the mission, I’ll go to the secret skill pavilion and comprehend the space-time teleportation first.”

Jian Wushuang made up his mind and immediately went to the secret skill pavilion.

On the third floor of the secret skill pavilion, Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged in front of the seven tall stone tablets.

Looking at the stone tablets in front of him, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were full of anticipation.

“Let’s begin!”

Soon, Jian Wushuang closed his eyes and began to comprehend.

Time passed. In the blink of an eye, one year and four months had passed.

For many people, one year was just a snap of the fingers. However, for Jian Wushuang, he had already comprehended the third move of the space-time divine skill, space-time teleportation!

This was also related to his talent in space-time.

After all, he could comprehend the space-time divine skill from the space-time gold stone. According to Temple Master Bai Xing, it was more difficult to comprehend it from the space-time gold stone than from the seven stone tablets in the secret skill pavilion.

“I’ve mastered spacetime teleportation. With this move, I can use it and escape quickly no matter what crisis I encounter. Even if the other party uses spacetime seal, it won’t be of much use to me.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, his eyes sparkled.

“I’m a perfect chaotic creature. My life-saving and survival abilities are already amazing. Now, with this move, there are only a handful of people in the Divine Beginning Realm who can kill me!”

“Even if it’s the three Saint Realms and the Sorceror God Sect, it won’t be easy for them to kill me again!”

Jian Wushuang growled with a hint of heroism in his heart.

After a while, he calmed down.

“I have comprehended space-time teleportation. Now, it’s time to complete the experiential learning task.”

Immediately, Jian Wushuang set off.

…

Ninth wolf mountain range in the first sky.

Although it was called a mountain range, the territory of the ninth wolf mountain range was vast, even larger than a country.

Such a large mountain range had been occupied by the thirteen axes for a long time.

The thirteen axes were the collective name for the thirteen experts in the ninth wolf mountain range.

These thirteen experts were all bandits, but because of their tyrannical strength, their deterrence was no longer comparable to that of ordinary bandits.

In the surrounding areas of the nine-wolf mountain range, and even in the entire First Heaven, the 13 axes were notorious!

“According to the mission given to me by Temple Master Bai Xing, the weakest of the 13 experts of the 13 axes are at the peak of rank seven True Saint. The eldest one, Blood Eagle, and the second one, Violent Bear, are both above rank seven and are infinitely close to the Invincible Saint Realm.” Jian Wushuang appeared alone in the nine-wolf mountain range, looking at the vast mountain range in front of him, he frowned slightly.

The mission Temple Master Bai Xing had given him was to prove his strength and that he was qualified to enter the Blood Wave Realm.

Therefore, this mission was not easy.

Thirteen axes, thirteen experts, and the weakest one was a rank seven Peak True Saint. In addition, there were two Immortal Saints who were infinitely close to the invincible level. This lineup could be said to be terrifying.

Even the overlords in the First Heaven, such as the twelve divine sects, did not have an Invincible Saint in most of the twelve divine sects. Without an Invincible Saint, with the combined strength of the top forces under their command, they would not be able to compete with the thirteen axes.

Even the nine courtyards, with the Invincible Saint in charge, did not dare to provoke the thirteen axes because the combined strength of the thirteen axes was indeed too strong.

Jian Wushuang’s task was to kill all the thirteen axes!

“The thirteen axes have occupied the nine-wolf mountain range for hundreds of thousands of years. Over the years, they have plundered and committed many evil deeds. Many countries and even some small sects in the nine-wolf mountain range have been oppressed by the thirteen axes. They deserve to die, but it’s not easy to kill all the thirteen axes.” Jian Wushuang frowned.

This task was indeed challenging for him, but it was not impossible for him to complete it.

“I have been cultivating in the Temporal Temple for 290 years, and my strength has changed a lot. These 13 axes are so powerful. They are really a good grindstone for me.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining, and then his body flashed, he directly rushed into the depths of the nine-wolf mountain range.

The 13 experts in the nine-wolf mountain range did not live together, but they were scattered and each occupied a mountain peak.

Normally, the 13 axes would only gather together occasionally, but they usually lived on their own mountain peaks.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang had arrived at a mountain peak of the 13 axes through the star map of the nine-wolf mountain range.

“According to the star map, this mountaintop has always been occupied by the Nether Cloud King, who is ranked eighth among the 13 axes. His strength is only average among the 13 axes. I’ll be the first to attack him,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile, then, he moved his consciousness.

Buzz!

A terrifying power instantly erupted from his body.

This power swept out in all directions, and in the blink of an eye, layers of enormous barriers appeared in the surrounding void.

This barrier was like an iron bucket, surrounding all directions, not leaving a single crack.

Sovereign seal, sovereign of spacetime!
