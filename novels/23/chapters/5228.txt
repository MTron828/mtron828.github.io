Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation     Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

This was just the second phase. There was still a third phase to come, and the Yan Immortals from the Black Tortoise Temple had already accelerated their appearance in the world. They had been cultivating for millions of years, guided correctly by the Qishen Temple. Soon, a large group of Grand Yan Immortals would emerge again, and history would repeat itself.

In this massive selection process, the treasures of the Qishen Temple were being rapidly depleted. Countless treasures piled up, but in the end, only a few formidable individuals who met the criteria would emerge.

Among the billions of Grand Yan Immortals, perhaps fewer than 10,000 would eventually meet the Qishen Temple’s standards!

Yan Immortals, Grand Yan Immortals, Emperors.

Every step was incredibly challenging—the difficulty of mastering the Dao for the Yan Immortals, the difficulty of merging the Dao for Grand Yan Immortals, and the difficulty for Emperors to reach the pinnacle.

These achievements couldn’t be simply attained through treasures. Besides treasures, the Qishen Temple aided them with its ruthless rules.

Original Planet Alpha Nine, the Feather Continent.

“Break!”

Hu Qing shouted angrily, sweeping his staff horizontally, directly shattering PO Jun’s divine body, and reducing his origin source to ashes.

“Stop!!” PO Jun couldn’t hold on any longer, and he had nowhere to retreat.

Numerous powerful beings watched in trembling fear!

They had originally thought that today, Hu Qing would surely perish. The Five Dao Lords had come in person, but they hadn’t anticipated such an outcome.

First, Jian Wushuang had emerged unexpectedly, unexpectedly defeating Dao Lord Leng Shuang. Then, Dao Lord Wan Xing had displayed the power of a half-step Emperor, intimidating everyone.

Now, Hu Qing, in a head-on confrontation, had reduced PO Jun to begging for mercy. This battle would alter the division of the Feather Continent.

At the very least, both Jian Wushuang and Hu Qing had already attained the status of Dao Lords, and they were among the top-ranking Dao Lords.

Dao Lord Wan Xing’s eyes glinted with determination. Hu Qing’s strength had indeed exceeded his expectations, but he welcomed this challenge.

On this Original Planet, the other four Dao Lords were never a concern for him from the start. Whether it was Leng Shuang or Xue Yue, the only one he found intriguing, PO Jun, had been ruthlessly crushed by Hu Qing.

As for Dao Lord Si Tian, his power had barely touched the level of a Dao Lord.

He had always relied on a precious artifact to maintain an illusion of strength. Among the five Dao Lords, he was the weakest, so much so that even Ji Chaoyang, ranked sixth, could stand his ground against him.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

With a swift strike, the staff pierced through PO Jun’s chest. Hu Qing stood proudly in the void and demanded, “Hand over the token, and I might spare your life!”

Despite his drastic change in demeanor, his kindness this lifetime remained unshaken.

He would spare lives whenever possible.

Jian Wushuang, however, watched impatiently from the sidelines. If not for Wan Xing’s vigilant presence, he would have rushed forward and slain PO Jun himself.

This second-ranked Dao Lord likely had accumulated billions of merits. If they could defeat him, they would share the merits, securing the first and second positions on this Original Planet.

Such opportunities were rare indeed!

Under ordinary circumstances, it would be incredibly challenging to kill a Dao Lord without Wan Xing’s overwhelming strength.

Since matters had progressed to this point and Wan Xing hadn’t issued an ultimatum, the other Dao Lords didn’t dare act recklessly.

Witnessing PO Jun’s pitiful state, they couldn’t help but feel a sense of foreboding.

Once lofty, now their thrones were shattered.

Especially Dao Lord Si Tian, who had an arrogant title. However, ever since witnessing Wan Xing’s true power, he had lost any trace of arrogance.

His strength allowed him to dominate those half-step Dao Lords, but among his peers, he was currently the weakest.

Relying on the mysterious treasure within him, he had reached the level of Dao Lord. In the outside world, he had always kept a low profile, just an ordinary Peak Grand Yan Immortal. It wasn’t until he arrived at the Qishen Temple that he unleashed the power of the treasure without reservation, elevating his combat strength to the level of Dao Lords.

The origins of this treasure were dubious; he dared not use it in the outside world. His eyes swept over the defeated PO Jun, finally resting on Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang felt the scrutiny and furrowed his brows, looking back at the Dao Lord Si Tian.

Such a blatant gaze was disrespectful to a stronger opponent. Even though they were peers, under unfamiliar circumstances, such scrutiny didn’t sit well with Jian Wushuang. His expression turned hostile.

Although he didn’t know much about these Dao Lords, from his observations, Dao Lord Si Tian seemed the least remarkable among the five Dao Lords. Either he was hiding his true strength, or he was all show and no substance, with average abilities.

He wasn’t afraid; among the Emperors present, only Dao Lord Wan Xing could pose a threat to him. Moreover, considering the terrifying strength of himself and Hu Qing, even Dao Lord Wan Xing wouldn’t intimidate them.

The heavily wounded PO Jun clutched his shattered chest, hunching over, and glanced at the Dao Lords who were spectators, a chill settling in his heart.

Smart decisions led to a lifetime of wisdom, but a moment of folly could ruin it all.

If he could severely injure Hu Qing, these people might stand by his side, perhaps even join forces to kill Hu Qing. Even if he couldn’t obtain the inheritance, gaining credit would be beneficial! But now, it was him who was injured, and these people had blocked his escape route.

Fate seemed to demand his demise!

Handing over his identity token was simply wishful thinking. He had fought hard for his current strength; he couldn’t abandon it so easily, especially when he could gain significant benefits in the Qishen Temple.

“You refuse!” Hu Qing swept his staff, his eyes narrowing, his uncontainable killing intent evident.

Although he didn’t enjoy killing, he wasn’t a saint either.

Jian Wushuang nodded beside him, thinking this was the right move. He didn’t want to get his hands dirty, so he let Hu Qing handle this Dao Lord, who ranked second on the ranking list.

“Haha!” PO Jun laughed manically, slowly straightening his body. He gave the observing Dao Lords a cold, mocking look. “You little brat, do you think I would bow to you?”

A powerhouse!

In this moment, PO Jun revealed the demeanor of a powerhouse.

Strength knew no ranks.

‘l’ne arrogance ot power was tne same wnetner It was a supreme-level powerhouse or an Emperor-level one.

At the same level, they displayed an invincible aura. They would never bow their heads reluctantly to peers, even if death was imminent!

“Go ahead! Let me see what you’re capable of,” PO Jun declared. In that moment, he ceased his desperate defense and instead gathered all his strength for one final stand, facing his adversary with his back against the wall.

If he could have escaped, he would have done so long ago. The other Dao Lords were not about to let a tiger return to the mountain without a fight.

“Very well. ”

Understanding his opponent’s intent, Hu Qing nodded slowly.

This time, he didn’t wield his silver staff. Instead, he raised his hand casually, pointing a finger with effortless ease. A palpable aura, capable of shaking the heavens and earth, surged forth.

This aura permeated the surrounding space, causing the once-silent Original Planet to tremble!

A dazzling radiance shot out from his fingertip, a beam of light capable of obliterating the heavens and earth.

The blinding brilliance forced PO Jun to squint, his eyes unable to withstand the intensity. He glared defiantly, only to realize he had no power left to resist.

With a muffled sound, the potent beam of light pierced through PO Jun’s body. His entire physical form was annihilated by the radiance, his divine essence utterly shattered. His origin source, akin to a withered flower, gradually faded away..
