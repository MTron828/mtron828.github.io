Chapter 449: An Encounter

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

When they saw Jian Wushuang approaching, Heaven Stone Castle Lord and Fire Demon both stopped where they were, but Long Xiang continued moving forward.

“Swordsman might have mastered a powerful Realm Technique and own a strong Puppet Fighter, but his personal strength is somewhat lacking.”?Long Xiang didn’t fear Jian Wushuang at all.

The news about Jian Wushuang killing Deng Huo caused an uproar.

He was also shocked when he first heard about it, but he quickly understood that Jian Wushuang had only been able to kill Deng Huo because of the Blood Puppet. As for his personal level of strength, he was only just barely at the Heaven-defying Level.

That was why Long Xiang turned up his nose at Jian Wushuang.

He wasn’t afraid of facing Jian Wushuang.

“Humph, I’m not as stupid as Deng Huo.”

Long Xiang glared at them with cold eyes as he rushed forward with his scarlet longspear in hand. He didn’t hesitate in charging towards Xue Yang and Meng You, not even when Jian Wushuang moved to block his path.

“Go to hell!”

At the same moment that Long Xiang shouted out, a tall spectral image instantly appeared behind him.

A scarlet ripple spread out from the longspear and formed a vortex that seemed to swallow everything in the area as if it was a black hole. Suddenly, a bloody light shot forward.

That light came from the scarlet longspear that was rushing towards Jian Wushuang’s head with strong and cruel killing power.

It was so terrifying that even Xue Yang and Meng You, who stood behind Jian Wushuang, began shaking fearfully.

“Swordsman, be careful!” Xue Yang couldn’t help shouting out.

“Oh?”

Seeing the bloody light, Jian Wushuang’s lips curled up, revealing a cold smile. The very next moment, he clenched his right hand and stepped forward while gathering a Purple Thunderbolt in his fist.

As he released his strength, his fist shot out like a falling star.

“Seeking death!” Long Xiang sneered at him.

Long Xiang had gone all out, but what about Jian Wushuang?

They all knew that Jian Wushuang focused on Sword Principle and had awakened a Double First-grade Sword Soul. However, Jian Wushuang hadn’t even unsheathed his sword. Instead, he was trying to counter the spear with his fist.

Was he trying to get himself killed?

However, the second Jian Wushuang’s fist collided with that scarlet longspear.

“What?” Long Xiang was shocked.

He felt an immense weight behind Jian Wushuang’s fist that easily deflected his scarlet longspear in a head-on collision.

But it wasn’t even enough to make Jian Wushuang slow down. His fist continued moving forward and struck Long Xiang’s head.

Bang!

Long Xiang’s head instantly burst open like a watermelon.

During this simple exchange, Long Xiang, an expert at the Heaven-defying Level who was stronger than Deng Huo, was instantly killed by Jian Wushuang.

“It, it…”

The other four people who had been watching, Xue Yang, Meng You, Heaven Stone Castle Lord, and Fire Demon, were speechless as they looked on in wide-eyed shock.

Did he just kill an expert of the Heaven-defying Level in a single blow?

And even worse than that, Jian Wushuang was an expert of Sword Principle, but he hadn’t even used his sword or his Sword Soul Phantom.

What did this mean?

It meant that Jian Wushuang had not even used his full strength.

He had killed Long Xiang with nothing but brute force.

“Run! Run!”

Heaven Stone Castle Lord shouted in panic, then he turned around and fled.

Fire Demon was also panic-stricken. He swallowed, glanced at Jian Wushuang, and then fled to another tunnel as well.

However, Jian Wushuang didn’t chase after them.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and took Long Xiang’s Interspatial Ring, then he turned and looked towards Xue Yang and Meng You.

“Xue Yang, I haven’t seen you in a long time, but you have improved a lot,” Jian Wushuang said and smiled. He noticed that Xue Yang had improved a lot since he last saw him two years ago. He was almost at the same level as Bone King and Heaven Stone Castle Lord. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

His improvements were probably due to the 10,000 battle achievements he received from that task.

After hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, Xue Yang came to himself and took a deep breath and said, with a bitter smile, “Yes, but my improvement was much less than yours.”

Jian Wushuang looked at him with an odd smile.

“By the way, why was Long Xiang, an expert at the Heaven-defying Level, trying to kill you? Did you find something special in the outer layer?” Jian Wushuang was curious.

“It...” Meng You hesitated.

But Xue Yang instantly replied, “The two of us found an Interspatial Ring in one of the secret chambers, and Long Xiang found out.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang nodded and said, “Well then, I’m going on ahead. You two take care.”

“Thank you for your help,” Xue Yang said gratefully.

“It was nothing.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand and left, continuing on his way towards the inner layer. It didn’t take long for him to disappear from their sight.

“Xue Yang, it seems you have a good relationship with Swordsman.” Meng You looked at Xue Yang.

“Two years ago, we attacked the Jiushe Cave Mansion together. At that time, he killed Deng Huo.” Xue Yang continued, “It’s only been two years since then. I didn’t expect his strength to improve so much after that battle.”

Meng You fell silent after hearing this.

It had only been slightly more than two years since Jian Wushuang killed Deng Huo. But, since he had relied on his Realm Technique and Puppet Fighter, his true strength had been questioned. No one thought that his strength had reached such an amazing level.

“It seems he is going to the inner layer.” Xue Yang gazed towards the direction in which Jian Wushuang had disappeared.

“The inner layer?” Meng You was surprised and said, “How could that be? Isn’t the inner layer a battlefield for lords?”

“Do you still think that his strength is only in the Saint Realm?” Xue Yang shot a questioning look at Meng You.

Meng You was stunned, but she quickly understood.

Jian Wushuang had killed an expert at the Heaven-defying Level in a single exchange.

Not even a normal lord could do that, so he was definitely capable of exploring the inner layer.

“There will be another supreme expert in Marquis Piaoxue’s camp.”
