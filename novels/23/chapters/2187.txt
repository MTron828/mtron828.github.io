Chapter 2188 Mountain River Map, Out!

It was silent on the battlefield.Blood Emperor stood there holding his spear as though he was the ruler of the sea of crimson red.

Jian Wushuang and Emperor Thirteen stood a distance away, staring intently at Blood Emperor.

“Haha. What a pity.”

Blood Emperor laughed and broke the silence.

Blood Emperor stared at Emperor Thirteen and smiled coldly, “Emperor Thirteen, what a pity. You could have killed me if the power this brat has now is in your control. It looks like fate is on my side today!”

“With the power you mastered at Half-Step Divine Demon Realm, all you can do is go even with me. You cannot kill me.”

“As for Jian Wushuang, he only has power. His own fighting is far too weak to pose a threat to me!” Blood Emperor mocked.

The effect of two different people using the exact same power could be vastly different.

For example, for the same amount of power of the weakest real god, an almighty or great emperor could use that power but have the fighting power of a peak real god.

If a weak universe god had the power of a peak real god, the battle power he could use would only be around that of an ordinary real god.

This was the difference.

Jian Wushuang and Emperor Thirteen was an obvious example.

Emperor Thirteen was simply in the Half-Step Divine Demon Realm, yet his battle power was on par with Blood Emperor, who was in the Chaotic Divine Demon Realm.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang was too weak for the top tier experts from the ancient past. Even if he had extraordinary power from casting Secret Skills of Star Palace, the fighting power he had was still weaker than that of Blood Emperor.

“Emperor Thirteen, I respect your fighting power. It is a pity that there is no way that both of you can kill me. Hence, all you can do is to stay there and watch me destroy this world.” Blood Emperor laughed delightfully.

He felt it was a pity that he was not able to kill Emperor Thirteen.

However, he felt elated that a superpower like Emperor Thirteen had suffered.

Hearing this, Emperor Thirteen had no reaction.

Jian Wushuang looked up and said, “Blood Emperor, it might be too early for you to be happy.”

“Oh?” Blood Emperor looked over at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang stopped talking as he whipped out a scroll.

This scroll looked ordinary. However, it radidated an ancient and unique aura.

After the scroll appeared, Jian Wushuang channelled his divine power and tossed this scroll high up into the sky. The scroll merged with heaven and earth instantly.

Hum~~ Hum~~ A special light was seen high up in the sky as something occurred.

“This is…?” Everyone looked up at the sky.

The sky was blood red had been empty. Now…

The space was filled.

It was filled by a gigantic and beautiful Picture Scroll World.

This Picture Scroll World occupied the entire sky as it turned into life.

An ancient and majestic aura came from within the picture scroll world. One could even hear soft chimes.

Every chime calmed people’s minds and made them forget the negative thoughts. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The experts standing below stared at this picture scroll world and they saw an endlessly large world.

This world had mountains and streams. The scenery was awesome as well.

Within this world, what attracted the most attention were the nine continents that were spread out at the different ends of the world.

Each of the nine continents had countless cities and humans. Every human on the continent was very realistic and radiated aura that belonged to cultivators.

It was as though the picture scroll had come to life!

The Picture Scroll World was alive.

If people did not see Jian Wushuang taking out this treasure with their own eyes, they would think the picture scroll was a real world.

“My power grew. The Mountain River Map seems even more realistic when I use it with full force.” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

Mountain River Map was one of his many trump cards.

It was also the strongest treasure he had.

This treasure came from his master, Xuan Yi.

He had used the Mountain River Map many times before. During those times, this Mountain River Map had not felt so realistic. The aura was also much stronger now.

“This is… The Mountain River Map belonging to the Seven Star Black Sect?”

Blood Emperor irises constricted in shock when he saw the Mountain River Map.

“This is the Mountain River Map. No matter the aura or the way to activate it, it it exactly the same as back then. The strongest treasure that the Seven Star Black Sect has is in the hands of this brat?” Blood Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang, indecisive of what he should do next.

The Mountain River Map had been very famous back in the ancient past.

Now, in the Second Era, a brat in the Chaotic Realm could wield it?

Was this possible?

Jian Wushuang ignored the Blood Emperor.

“With my current fighting power, how many seals can I cast? How powerful could they be?” Jian Wushuang thought to himself as he anticipated the results.

“Let’s try.” Jian Wushuang attacked without hesitation.

A continuous stream of divine power surged up towards the Picture Scroll World.

There was star power mincing with the divine power. Immediately, an overbearing aura radiated from the Picture Scroll World.

The Picture Scroll World had nine continents. One of the continents looked like it had come alive as it moved within the picture scroll world.

“Nine Province Seal, the fourth seal!”

“Seal of Clouds!”

The fourth seal, Seal of Clouds, descended under the control of Jian Wushuang.

The large province came down slowly.

The sky turned dark immediately.

Everyone looked up and stared at the majestic continent that was descending towards them.

No one spoke as everyone was tense. There was silence.

The only sound that could be heard was of heavy breathing.

No one from the Eternal Chaotic World could stop this seal!
