Chapter 4089: Collision

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the dark void of the universe, a barefoot old man stood there quietly. His eyes were like poisonous snakes, staring at the universe boat that was rapidly approaching at the end of the universe.

“Keke, it’s coming toward me. It seems that I’m really lucky.”

The barefoot old man was one of the Ultimate Rulers under the command of the cold man, Devour Nine. This time, there were Eighth Ultimate Rulers accompanying Devour Nine to capture Jian Wushuang.

These Eighth Ultimate Rulers were scattered in different directions around the Dusty Rain Star World. Thus, even if the Dusty Rain Star World collapsed and Jian Wushuang escaped from it, he would not be able to escape from their interception.

Now, the barefoot elder was in charge of blocking Jian Wushuang’s escape.

“I heard from Lord Devour Seven that this third-level Ruler named Blood Sword is extraordinary. Lord Devour Nine also ordered us to capture him alive. We must not kill him. It seems that this third-level Ruler named Blood Sword is indeed very important. If I can capture him directly, it will be a credit to me.” The barefoot elder sneered, he was ready to stop the universe boat and capture Jian Wushuang.

The universe boat was extremely fast. In just a moment, it had arrived in front of the barefooted old man, and they were getting closer and closer.

“Keke, stay.” The barefooted old man sneered and moved forward.

At the same time, a figure shot out from the universe boat.

“You still want to resist?” The barefoot old man’s smile grew wider.

Jian Wushuang, who rushed out from the universe boat, had an extremely cold expression, and his eyes were filled with shocking killing intent.

He rushed directly to the barefoot old man, and his strength burst out at this moment. “Swish!”

A cold sword light shot out directly.

The smile on the barefoot old man’s face instantly froze, and it was replaced by a look of horror. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“How could it be so fast?”

This was the thought that came to the barefooted old man’s mind the moment he saw Jian Wushuang’s sword.

It was too fast, indeed too fast.

After reaching the first level of the Purple Blood Secret Manual, Jian Wushuang’s application of the universal principles and swordsmanship had been perfectly combined. He had spent a long time to create the ‘Netherworld Mo Wen’ sword.

The speed of this sword was so fast that even the Ultimate Ruler would find it difficult to block it.

For example, the Blood Thunder General Ruler in the Thunder God Palace could not block Jian Wushuang’s sword.

As for the barefoot old man, his strength was almost the same as that of the Blood Thunder General Ruler. Even if he was slightly stronger, he was not much stronger.

But the key problem was that he could not block Jian Wushuang’s sword either.

The cold sword light directly cut through the barefoot old man’s body. The barefoot old man narrowed his eyes slightly.

The moment the sword light cut through his body, the power of the sword attack was almost completely blocked by the principle supreme treasure armor on his body. In other words, Jian Wushuang’s sword attack did not cause any damage to him.

“Is it just the speed?” Just as the barefooted old man thought of this, an unprecedented pain suddenly rose from the depths of his soul.

“No!”

The barefooted old man let out a shrill cry. In the next moment, the skin on his body turned black and gray at a speed visible to the naked eye. His vitality was fading at an alarming rate.

In just a moment, the barefooted old man’s divine body had turned into dust. Only a few treasures and his interspatial ring remained.

Jian Wushuang had used a drop of poison worth 5,000 origin stones. In just one move, the barefooted old man, who was an Ultimate Ruler, had died instantly.

After killing the barefoot old man, Jian Wushuang did not hesitate at all. He waved his hand and put the treasures left by the barefoot old man into his interspatial ring. Then he rushed onto the universe boat and continued to flee.

In the void not far behind, the cold man had been following the universe boat. He was not in a hurry. After all, he had already arranged for his Ultimate Ruler to intercept Jian Wushuang.

However, the cold man had never expected that the Ultimate Ruler he had sent to intercept Jian Wushuang would be killed by Jian Wushuang in one move.

This was completely beyond the cold man’s expectations.

“A third-level Ruler killed the Ultimate Ruler in one move? Although he used some special things, it’s still incredible. He deserves to be the disciple of that man.” The cold man’s eyes were cold.

The more heaven-defying Jian Wushuang was, the more murderous intent he felt.

Without the experts in front of him, it seemed difficult to stop Jian Wushuang’s universe boat.

“Humph, I wanted to save some energy, but now it seems that I can’t. In that case…” The cold man narrowed his eyes slightly. He waved his right hand, and a universe boat appeared in the void in front of him, a universe boat also appeared out of thin air.

This universe boat was not as big as the one Jian Wushuang was on, but it looked extremely delicate. Its body was like a flat surface, and the front part was extremely sharp, it was like a sharp spear.

It was worth mentioning that the universe boat that the cold man took out was much more powerful than Jian Wushuang’s universe boat.

“Let’s go after them.”

The cold man had already arrived on the universe boat. Under his control, the exquisite purple universe boat instantly burst out with a terrifying speed, piercing through the void and chasing after Jian Wushuang’s universe boat.

The purple universe boat was too fast. It was at least several times or even nearly ten times faster than the universe boat Jian Wushuang and the others were on.

With such a terrifying speed, the universe boat caught up with them in just a moment.

“Crash!”

Jian Wushuang’s universe boat was already in front of him, but the cold-looking man did not slow down at all. Instead, he fiercely crashed toward Jian Wushuang’s universe boat.

“Oh no!”

Inside the universe boat, Jian Wushuang’s expression changed drastically.

Bang!

A terrible crash suddenly sounded in the universe void.

The black universe boat that Jian Wushuang was riding on was directly smashed into pieces.

The moment the universe boat collapsed, Jian Wushuang directly waved his hand and put Leng Rushuang and the Devil Flame into the suppression-type principle true treasure. Then, the divine power in Jian Wushuang’s body began to burn crazily.

He immediately performed the dragon-killing secret skill.

“Huh? Divine Power Burning Secret Skill?”

On the purple universe boat, the cold man looked at Jian Wushuang who was still running crazily and smiled disdainfully. “Is it useful?”

As soon as he finished his words, the cold man slowly extended his right hand and pointed in the direction of Jian Wushuang.
