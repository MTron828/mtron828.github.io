5070 Entering the Dust

In the vast emptiness, within the boundless universe, even for a Yan Immortal cultivator traversing through the void, there were still dangers to be found.

“Young one, I must admit that your swordsmanship is exceptionally remarkable. But with your current cultivation level, it would be wiser to proceed more cautiously,” the slender figure remarked.

He kept saying that he was a Grand Yan Immortal, all while getting closer to Jian Wushaung.

Finally, Sword Wushuang could no longer endure it. “Don’t you think that, for me, you are the greatest threat right now?”

“…Young Friend, you’ve got it all wrong. I would never be that kind of Yan Immortal!”

The slender figure replied with utmost sincerity.

“…”

He could sense that this individual was nothing more than a pure chatterbox, perhaps having gone years without speaking a word, which explained his incessant rambling.

He only shut his mouth in satisfaction when Jian Wushuang had restrained his hostility.

However, before long, he sighed, “In this vast empty void, to have a like-minded companion is truly fortunate. I can’t remember how long it’s been since I last spoke.”

“Have you always been like this?” Jian Wushuang suddenly inquired, “Interfering in matters across the Super Heavenly Regions? Buting into the business of random Heavenly Realms?”

“…Not entirely, it’s mostly because I enjoy meddling in ordinary affairs,” the slender figure said with a twitch of his lips.

Jian Wushuang shook his head in response and remained silent.

“What happened earlier was indeed my… I mean, my fault. Young Friend, please don’t take offense. In truth, I’m quite easy to get along with,” he continued, “For the sake of making amends, I’ve decided to protect you throughout this journey.”

“That’s hardly necessary,” Jian Wushuang said calmly.

The slender figure found himself at a loss for how to handle this uncooperative individual. However, he soon felt a sense of satisfaction and continued to follow Jian Wushuang from a distance.

Jian Wushuang, on the other hand, couldn’t be bothered with such matters and continued soaring into the depths of the void.

Jian Wushuang didn’t care about this and continued to dive into the depths of the void.

The void was vast, and there was still a considerable distance to cover before reaching the Great Mi Heaven.

As they continued their journey through the void, Jian Wushuang gradually let down his guard, allowing the slender figure to keep pace closely.

Jian Wushuang glanced at him but did not respond.

“These six words are, ‘enter the dust, transcend the world.’”

As these words were uttered, Jian Wushuang’s figure momentarily froze, then returned to a calm demeanor.

Indeed, someone who could contend with their own Sword Principle against the Star River Lake Sea Sword Intent… How could they be an ordinary person?

The slender figure observed all of his reactions and couldn’t help but smile, saying, “So, Young Friend, shall I take you on a journey into the dust?”

This time, Jian Wu Shuang did not refuse, “Sure.”

“Then let us journey into the dust!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The slender figure laughed heartily and took the lead.

And Jian Wu Shuang, who was originally prepared to go to the Great Mi Heaven, was successfully led astray.

To ‘enter the dust’ meant to enter the mortal world and experience the most subtle forms of life.

For Yan Immortals like Jian Wushuang, the mortal realm was considered impure, and their formidable Yan power could easily dissipate.

As a result, very few Immortals would set foot in the mortal world.

But the slender figure was an exception. He did not care about his own fortune or the dispersion of his Yan power; he entered the mortal world.

Without the supreme Dao of heaven and earth, and even in a realm so devoid of Yan power that it could not support the existence of cultivators, two figures in plain white robes walked slowly.

These two figures were Jian Wushuang and the slender figure.

The market was bustling and prosperous, filled with ordinary people who could not control or sense Yan power.

As Jian Wu Shuang and the slender figure walked through the market, even though they suppressed their Yan power, their extraordinary aura still attracted many curious gazes.

Among the bustling crowd, the slender figure appeared quite relaxed. He somehow produced two melons from who-knows-where, offered one to Jian Wushuang, and when it was politely declined, he simply began munching on it himself.

“After I reached the heights I aspired to, I stopped and entered one mortal world after another, experiencing the subtle essence of ‘entering the dust’.”

“All Yan Immortals abandon the mundane world like an old shoe, but I have a different feeling.”

“They, these mortals, have such short lifespans, at most a century is one cycle for them. I once sat on a high mountain in the mortal realm, watching them cycle through a thousand lifetimes. The loneliness of life and death touched me.”

“You might not believe it, but the fact that I can ascend to the Grand Yan Immortal realm has a lot to do with the mortal world.”

He threw melon husk on the ground and looked at Jian Wushuang.

“But I always feel that something is missing.”

Listening quietly to the thoughts of a Grand Yan Immortal, Jian Wushuang said, “That day may never come, or it may only exist in a single thought.”

“I actually hope that day will never come,” the slender figure chuckled.

“By the way, we’ve known each other for so long, and I haven’t asked for your name.”

“Jian Wushuang.”

“I am Nan Xuan.”

After exchanging their names, the two of them did not speak anymore and walked forward leisurely.

The market was bustling, to say the least.

Although there weren’t many pedestrians, their gazes were intense and sincere as they looked at the two of them.

But soon, the pedestrians in the market began to rush forward as if they were joining in on the fun.

“Let’s go, let’s go. Have you guys heard? There’s a magician from another kingdom. It’s said that his magic arts are extremely powerful, and he can conjure anything he wants. Let’s all go and take a look.”

Accompanied by the noisy voices, almost half of the pedestrians gathered in the front.

Jian Wushuang and Nan Xuan were also carried forward by the crowd.

In the end, the pedestrians converged in the depths of the bustling market and stopped to watch in front of a stall covered with various masks.

In the center of this stall, a shabby old Daoist with white hair, wearing a Daoist robe, swayed left and right with a cheerful expression.

As his body swayed, the bells tied to his waist jingled.

“Welcome, dear spectators! This old Daoist has been waiting for you all here for quite some time.”

He said with a smile, then reached out and took a white monkey mask from the shelf, throwing it onto the table.

In an instant, the white monkey mask emitted a puff of smoke, and a long-armed, all-white monkey leaped out from it.

The crowd was in an uproar, all amazed by this sight.

The transformation of an inanimate object into a living creature was something unimaginable, but it was happening right before their eyes.
