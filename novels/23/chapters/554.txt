Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Go to hell!”

The eight figures were in a frenzy. The ice-cold black light slashed directly at Jian Wushuang’s head this time. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

At this very moment, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes.

A sharp light flashed in his eyes.

“This is the Original Body.” Jian Wushuang looked at one of the figures.

He had not been able to identify the Original Body before he entered Dao. Now, he could do it in one glance.

“I thought he was so fast, now, I think his speed is mediocre.” Jian Wushuang sneered, then made his move.

Nobody had expected this.

Whoosh! The ice-cold black light approached Jian Wushuang’s ear and tried to cut at his head.

Emperor Golden Snake narrowed his eyes and stared at Jian Wushuang. As he had expected, Jian Wushuang didn’t react to the light and could only watch it passively. The ice-cold black light passed through his head easily.

“Oh?” Emperor Golden Snake froze.

Experts outside the Restriction were stunned.

“That’s a residual shadow! When?” Emperor Golden Snake was stunned as he had not noticed Jian Wushuang moving.

Suddenly, an emotionless voice whispered in his ears, “Emperor Golden Snake, your speed is just so-so.”

As Jian Wushuang’s words died, Emperor Golden Snake turned and saw Jian Wushuang’s sword flying towards him.

Emperor Golden Snake raised his black scimitar to deflect the attack.

Bang!

A loud bang sounded. Spectators watched on as Emperor Golden Snake was thrown off by the impact to the edge of Bloodshed Valley.

“What happened?” Emperor Golden Snake’s face fell. He could now feel that Jian Wushuang was different.

As experts outside the Restriction looked at Jian Wushuang, they also realized that something in Jian Wushuang had changed.

On the battlefield, Jian Wushuang held his sword in one hand. The Golden Sword Soul Phantom behind him continued to spread Supreme Sword Essence. As Jian Wushuang looked at Emperor Golden Snake, his surging killing intent was palpable.

“Emperor Golden Snake, thank you!” Jian Wushuang said.

“Why are you thanking me?” Emperor Golden Snake’s look was confused.

“If not for you, I don’t know when I would have made a breakthrough.” Jian Wushuang smiled. “Thank you, I will kill you with my best move which I mastered just now.”

As Jian Wushuang spoke, he slowly raised the Heart-killing Sword.

There was dead silence. Everyone held their breaths as they stared at Jian Wushuang.

They now understood that Jian Wushuang had made a breakthrough.

But his aura had not changed, which meant that he was still a Saint Realm.

Jian Wushuang stared calmly at Emperor Golden Snake. The Heart-killing Sword shook as it gathered more power. Then, Jian Wushuang slashed his sword at Emperor Golden Snake.

The move was simple and appeared to be slow, as though there was no energy behind it.

But right at that moment, a Sword Essence Wave swept over rapidly...

It was the fifth move of Heart-killing Sword Technique!

Sword Ripple.

He had not mastered it until he entered Slaughter Dao.

The Sword Essence Wave moved much faster than Emperor Golden Snake’s strongest move.

At the edge of the battlefield, Emperor Golden Snake had again transformed into eight figures. At the approach of the Sword Essence Wave, the figures tried to resist but the wave swept through them like fallen leaves blown by the autumn wind.

The Sword Essence Wave cleaved the eight Emperor Golden Snakes and continued its sweep towards the Restriction.

There was a buzzing sound as the wave met against powerful resistance from the Restriction. However, the Sword Essence Wave still left in it a huge hole.

Experts who stood outside the Restriction watching the fight didn’t notice the wave’s approach.

They had thought that the Restriction was not easy to break as it had been built jointly by two Temple Masters. Even a superior emperor could barely break it.

Unexpectedly, Jian Wushuang’s sword had been able to do it as it continued its onslaught after killing Emperor Golden Snake.

The Sword Essence Wave continued along its path and onlookers in that direction naturally became targets.

“No!”

“Hurry and escape!”

Cries of panic filled the air. It was fortunate that Temple Master Pure Moon arrived in time to fend it off, so that no one got hurt.

Calm was restored after the Sword Essence Wave dissipated. But for many of those present, their emotions were in turmoil.

Everyone looked at Jian Wushuang in shock.

Jian Wushuang’s face was expressionless. Near where he stood, Emperor Golden Snake’s Original Body had been cut and he began to fall powerlessly on the ground.

“Am I going to die?”

Emperor Golden Snake appeared confused.

Things had changed so fast. He didn’t know what had happened during the time he closed his eyes.

He had increased his strength so much in such a short period.

A terrible sword move had killed him.

“I was supposed to avenge my son in this Life-death Duel. I didn’t expect to dig a grave for myself!”

“Jian Wushuang, I never thought I would be defeated by you. But don’ t get too complacent!”

“Even if I will die, I won’t make it easy on you.”

With his last breath, Emperor Golden Snake took out a Jade Slip and sent a message.

“Master, I have a compass, it’s a treasure!”

“If you want to get the Ancient World Token, the compass is the key!”
