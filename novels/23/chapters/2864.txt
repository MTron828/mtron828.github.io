Chapter 2865: Had Underestimated Him

——

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The four Peak Divine Masters attacked Jian Wushuang with all their strength.

However, Jian Wushuang only casually attacked the four Peak Divine Masters. Although he looked calm, he was able to withstand their attacks.

“My divine power has increased dramatically since I became an initial Great Divine Master. The power of the Blood Mountain Sword is dozens of times stronger than before. Now, my divine power is at least 100 times stronger than when I fought Marquis of Three Yin! ”

“Even though I haven’t used any secret skills, the power of my divine power and the Blood Mountain Sword is still much stronger than that of a Peak Great Divine Master. Even if I don’t use any sword skills, I can still fight against the four Great Divine Masters with my brute strength.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

He could fight with the four Peak Divine Masters with just a casual move of his sword.

If he used his sword skills seriously…

“I’ve already felt the power of Blood Mountain Sword. There’s no need to waste time with them.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and moved forward like a ghost, he appeared in front of the burly man who was as tall as a mountain.

The burly man looked extremely sturdy as if he was covered by a layer of rock. He immediately rushed toward Jian Wushuang when he saw him.

However, this time, Jian Wushuang did not use his sword. Instead, he swung his sword.

Whoosh!

A beautiful sword light swept out. The sword light was so beautiful that it was intoxicating.

This sword was the seventh move of the space-time swordsmanship created by Jian Wushuang, the intoxicated one.

The sword light flashed out, but it contained an extremely terrifying strangling power. This strangling power was formed by the hundreds of space-time blades that Jian Wushuang had comprehended the space-time rules.

Of course, the most important thing was that it was the Blood Mountain Sword that performed this move.

The sword light collided with the burly man’s mountain-like body without any hindrance.

The burly man thought that his secret skill was strong enough to fight against Jian Wushuang’s sword light. However, when the two collided, the burly man’s hair stood on end.

The towering mountain formed by the burly man was cut in half by the beautiful sword light. The sword light passed through the center of the mountain and cut it in half. Naturally, it divided the burly man’s divine body in half.

Even so, the beautiful sword light did not disappear. Instead, it rushed out at an amazing speed and swept toward the messy-haired old man who had been attacking Jian Wushuang with soul attacks.

“What?” The messy-haired old man was shocked. He did not expect the sword light to continue slashing at him.

The distance was too close, and the speed of the sword light was so fast that the messy-haired elder did not have time to block it. He could not even put up some defense on his body. He could only watch as the sword light struck his divine body, it passed through his divine body.

Chi! Chi!

The beautiful sword light finally disappeared completely. However, two of the four peak divine masters who had surrounded Jian Wushuang were killed in an instant.

“How is this possible?”

“This, this…”

The remaining two people, the green-clothed woman wielding the dark green whip, and the short and thin man wielding the sledgehammer, were all shocked.

They were both Peak Divine Masters, but Jian Wushuang had killed two of them with one strike. Did this mean that they could not withstand one strike?

“Run!”

Without hesitation, they turned around and tried to run away.

Jian Wushuang glanced at them and slowly raised his palm.

Buzz!

A tremendous force of space-time rules swept away in an instant.

The heaven-designated skill… with Jian Wushuang’s great improvement in the space-time rule and the power of his divine power, he could use this skill again. Even an Invincible Divine Master could not be underestimated, he had almost no ability to resist. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Without any warning, the void where the cyan-robed woman and the short and skinny man were standing completely froze.

The cyan-robed woman and the short and skinny man were also completely frozen, not moving at all.

Jian Wushuang’s figure flashed and appeared beside the two of them. Then he casually waved his Blood Mountain Sword and two heads were immediately thrown away.

In the blink of an eye, all the supreme divine masters who had surrounded Jian Wushuang were dead!

Too fast, too fast!

The four Supreme Divine Masters had been able to fight Jian Wushuang with equal strength, but in the blink of an eye, they were killed by Jian Wushuang in less than half a breath.

In the void beside the battlefield, Young Master Qu stood side by side with the Black Blood Emperor. When the Black Blood Emperor saw Jian Wushuang kill the two Peak Great Divine Masters with his sword, he realized that something was wrong and wanted to help, however, he was too slow.

He had just moved when the four Peak Great Divine Masters were all dead.

“Damn it!” The Black Blood Emperor’s expression changed.

“How could it be?” Young Master Qu was stunned.

They had long noticed that the divine power emitted by Jian Wushuang was only at the level of a Peak Great Divine Master.

Logically speaking, Jian Wushuang would have been completely defeated in a four-on-one fight. Therefore, he did not pay much attention to it at the beginning and only let the four Peak Great Divine Masters fight while the Black Blood Emperor watched from the side.

However, because of this slight underestimation, he lost four Peak Great Divine Masters for nothing.

This was a Peak Great Divine Master. Even though the heaven curve world was larger than the Pill Sun Sacred world, it did not have many Peak Great Divine Masters. It was a great loss to lose four at once.

“I underestimated him.”

Master Qu stared at Jian Wushuang with a cold face.

“He’s only a Peak Divine Master, but his battle strength is almost comparable to an ordinary Invincible Divine Master. No wonder Chi Ming couldn’t stop him in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. He seemed to be intimidated. I thought he used some special method, but now it seems that his strength is indeed above Chi Ming’s. Chi Ming must have realized this and chose to retreat.” The Black Blood Emperor’s voice was cold.

In the void ahead, Jian Wushuang, who had easily killed the four Great Divine Masters, looked at Young Master Qu and Young Master Qu with his cold eyes.

“Young Master Qu, didn’t you want to kill me? It seems that these four people are not enough.”
