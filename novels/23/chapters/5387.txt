The Luo Hou Battle Formation, combined with his mastery of space, could unleash a power equivalent to the pinnacle tier 4, even rivaling the strength of a tier 5 Emperor. This was a significant reliance.

“Ninth Prince, His Majesty has decreed that all those going to war must assemble at the imperial palace immediately!” A sharp voice echoed, and then departed directly.

Jian Wushuang withdrew his avatar clone, and his true self walked out from the room.

The leader of the guards stood by, ready for orders.

These people were absolutely loyal to Xia Mang Guanyu, but they were not eager to go to the battlefield.

“Prepare the chariots, we’re going to the imperial palace!”

For a moment, the entire imperial city was in turmoil.

“Suddenly, the MO Luo attacked the fourth city. General Gutong was severely injured and retreated. The fourth city has fallen!”

“The second city’s defense forces went out for patrol, and 30,000 were annihilated with no survivors!”

In just three days…

100,000 troops had fallen at the borders.

The fourth newly-built city was also breached, and General Gutong, one of the empire’s three great generals, was critically injured and urgently needed to return to the imperial city for recovery.

There were no available prominent generals on the front lines.

The subordinate generals were not weak in strength, but they lacked considerable skills in commanding battles.

Upon arriving at the Qianqing Palace, the important figures surprisingly didn’t procrastinate and were even faster than their arrival.

In the grand hall, the Imperial Emperor, Xia Mang Yunxing, presided.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The first to arrive was Xia Mang Yunzhan.

The Great Xia’s strongest war god.

At the top of tier 5, he possessed strength comparable to a tier 6.

“Now that everyone is here, follow us to the Northern City military camp. We will immediately break camp and set out for war!”

As the voice echoed, the atmosphere became incredibly majestic.

Everyone rose in respect, and at that moment, battle armor was donned.

Rumble!

Dark clouds covered the sky.

This time, the expeditionary force consisted of a staggering ten thousand warriors, all tier 4 Emperors.

Just the major clans in the imperial city mobilized 3,000 tier 4 Emperors, forming a grand army of 3,000 battalions.

Another 5,000 belonged to the direct lineages of the Great Xia vassal kings.

The remaining two thousand were the true elite of Great Xia, led by Xia Mang

Yunzhan.

The outcome of the war depended on these individuals.

The so-called “Five Army Camps” of the vassal kings and the 3,000 battalions formed by the major clans were all ragtag troops destined for doom on the battlefield.

Outside the imperial city, standing in the sky, military camps stretched endlessly as far as the eye could see.

Buzz!

With a wave of Xia Mang Yunxings hand, a colossal city descended from the heavens, spanning billions of miles in length and width, its end indiscernible.

The power it emanated above was awe-inspiring, intimidating countless onlookers.

“This is the pinnacle Eternal Treasure, the City of Suppression!” Many tier 5 Emperors recognized this grand city.

Xia Mang Yunxing looked down at the vast army below and declared with a commanding voice, “The MO Luo has repeatedly violated our borders. Today, I announce the expedition to vanquish the MO Luo!”

As his words fell, the Qi of heaven and earth condensed, flowing into the entire City of Suppression.

“Commander Xia Mang Yunzhan, receive the seal!” Xia Mang Guanyu star declared, handing over the great seal of the City of Suppression to Xia Mang Yunzhan.

He was the ruler of a nation, there was no need for him to personally go to war.

The two brothers, one in charge of military campaigns, the other responsible for stabilizing the realm, each had their own duties.

On the surface, there was a distinction of higher and lower positions, but in private, they addressed each other as equals. “l will not disappoint Your Majesty’s expectations!”

Xia Mang Yunzhan took the lead in responding.

Whether it was the generals above or the vast army below, they all shouted in unison, their voices shaking the heavens and the earth.

The united and resolute momentum had already emerged, and Xia Mang Yunxing nodded in approval.

With the encouragement of the two brothers in turn, the atmosphere truly became cohesive.

Then came the entry of the army into the city.

The eight city gates opened, welcoming in a myriad of soldiers.

In fact, flying directly in would have been faster, but rules were rules; hastily flying into the city would carry unfavorable implications.

The army entered the city in an orderly manner, and Xia Mang Yunxing quietly exited.

There was a hint of determination in Xia Mang Yunzhan’s eyes as he gestured for the troops to settle in the ‘City of Suppression’.

This super city was specifically crafted for military campaigns.

Apart from the magnificent central hall, the other four directions were flat grounds, and now the military camps were fully stationed.

Xia Mang Yunzhan personally organized the divisions.

For this campaign, Xia Mang Yunzhan was the supreme commander, and everyone obeyed his orders. Defying military orders was a grave crime, and no one dared to challenge it.

Even several Princes dared not.

The originally arrogant Second Prince, now standing behind Xia Mang Yunzhan, was extremely restrained. He didn’t even dare to call him ‘Imperial Uncle’ anymore. Like everyone else, he was addressed as ‘Grand Marshal l .

Crown Prince Xia Mang Guanjun served as the commander in chief for this campaign, sharing a status similar to Xia Mang Yunzhan’s, but with a stark contrast in power.

Commander in chief and Grand Marshal.

Apart from these two, there were two major generals on the left and right, the two of the three commanders of Great Xia, commanding the main forces of 2,000 regiments.

The rest were not distinguished in any particular order.

There were a total 60 tier 5 Emperors.

60 generals were appointed, and aside from their respective private armies, some families without tier 5 Emperors to lead were assigned to those who had them.

Jian Wushuang, due to his relationship with the Xuanyuan family, was assigned to them.

Xuanyuan Dapan’s strength was extraordinary. Under his command were 5 tier 4 Emperors from his direct line, and then there were additional 10 tier 4 Emperors from his subordinates and those assigned to him, along with hundreds of thousands of tier 3 Emperors.

Although it was officially arranged like this.

The Five Army Regiments and the 3,000 regiments still had their own leaders.

For example, the 3,000 regiments in the capital, where Xuanyuan Dapan was stationed, had already regarded him as their general.

Xia Mang Yunzhan naturally saw this.

The 3,000 regiments were responsible for the eastern city, merely guarding one side of the city wall. After all, they were nobles of the capital, and differences in treatment were normal.

The Five Army Regiments gathered from all corners of the realm varied significantly in strength. Though they stood atop hills, they lacked the power and background of Xuanyuan Dapan, and could only be responsible for the two southwestern city walls.

The remaining northern city wall was guarded by two armies from the left and right.

Not many powerful individuals were needed for guarding; 2 tier 5 Emperors with a group of people were sufficient, primarily tasked with combat outside the city.

Now, the north wall had been designated as the primary exit.

This meant telling them that no one should come out on the north city wall; they could pass through here.

They knew that this time they were here to weaken the influence of various families, to take a beating.

However, they really wanted to win. If they won the campaign, they would be the first to carve up the conquered territory.

“All right, that’s it. Everyone get into position now, and let’s set out!”

The crowd responded in unison and dispersed.

Jian Wushuang followed Xuanyuan Dapan out of the main hall and arrived at the camp assigned to them.

Here, millions of cultivators had gathered.

“Spread the word, all Emperors come to my tent for a discussion!” Xuanyuan Dapan’s face was stern.

When he turned to look at Jian Wushuang, a faint smile appeared. “Yu’er, this war is a great opportunity for you to earn outstanding merits. Keep this token; for every enemy you don’t kill, you’ll still gain merits.”

Jian Wushuang took the token respectfully and said, “Grandfather, I’ll go back first. It will take several days to reach the border, and I need to prepare.”

“Go ahead!” Xuanyuan Dapan waved his hand, a hint of amusement in his eyes.

Although this grandson had the surname Xia Mang, his temperament was very much like his own.

This time, in addition to protecting the family’s power, he also had to help this grandson gain some merits..
