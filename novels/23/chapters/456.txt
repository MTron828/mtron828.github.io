Chapter 457: An Exceptional Saint Realm Expert

Translator:?Transn?Editor:?Transn

Like a giant pair of pliers clamping down hard on something, the Blood River tumbled toward the lords of Pale Moon Marquis’ camp in no time.

When the lords first saw the Blood River appear, they felt somewhat astounded before the suppression took effect. Woosh! At this moment, their bodies forcibly sank down, and the weaker ones among them nearly fell off their feet.

“Gosh!”

“How is this possible?”

“This is...”

The lords of Pale Moon Marquis’s camp were stupefied. All they could feel at present was that an unfathomable strength was suppressing them, as if miring them deep. Their bodies were heavily locked down.

“What a frightening Realm.”

The lords of Drifting-blood Marquis’ camp were also shocked. Though the Blood River did not suppress them, they could perceive that its suppressive force was extremely strong. They thus cast bewildered looks toward Jian Wushuang.

It was very difficult for them to imagine that such a frightening Realm, which even advanced lords were being shackled by, could have been summoned by a Saint Realm expert whom they did not take seriously hitherto.

“Swordsman?” Iron Saber Lord and Silver Wing Lord were astonished like never before.

“My goodness. Even I, an advanced lord, have suffered a strength reduction of nearly 30 percent due to this Realm’s suppressive force.” Despite sinking into and being suppressed by the Realm like the other lords, Myriad Islands Lord revealed a face of outrage instead. He followed up by howling wildly, “Kill him, quick!”

Swish! Swish!

Two beams of Flowing Light shot explosively toward Jian Wushuang.

Pale Moon Marquis’ lords were mindful of how strong the Realms summoned by Jian Wushuang were, and how strong the Realms’ impact upon the battle situation was. If Jian Wushuang was not killed, the advantage which they had built up thanks to their two Formations would most certainly crumble, and they might even fall into an absolute disadvantage.

Therefore, as soon as they could, the two lords closest in distance to the swordsman went on him.

They were both intermediate lords!

“Seven Luminaries Lord, protect the swordsman quickly!” Iron Saber Lord shouted when he saw what was happening.

Seven Luminaries Lord was the person from Drifting-blood Marquis’ contingent who was closest in distance to Jian Wushuang. He was also an intermediate lord. As soon as he heard Iron Saber Lord’s shouting, he sped toward the swordsman, but because he was unaccompanied and acted later than the two enemies, he did not have absolute confidence that he could intercept them.

However, what he never imagined was that instead of retreating, Jian Wushuang would meet the two opposing lords head-on.

“Is he crazy?” Seven Luminaries Lord was completely stunned.

“Swordsman!” Iron Saber Lord was similarly taken aback.

In fact, every lord on the battlefield was in disbelief, regardless of which camp they were from.

A Saint Realm expert, being murderously charged at by two intermediate lords, would choose to meet them head-on instead of retreating?

“He has definitely gone mad.” Drifting-blood Marquis’ lords could not help shaking their heads as if they had already foreseen what the result would be.

Though everyone else believed that Jian Wushuang had gone completely mad, he remained extraordinarily calm.

“My battle strength is definitely no weaker than an intermediate lord’s, and in fact, would be among their best. And with the Realms’ support, just two intermediate lords aren’t enough to drive me back!” A sparkle flashed in his eyes, and the two giant Sword Soul Phantoms behind him rose. The Triple-kill Sword in his hand knowingly emitted a heavy amount of Sword Essence.

Streams of immense Spiritual Power gathered on his body, which was also packed with frightening muscular strength.

Fixing his attention on the two intermediate lords, Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and violently drew his sword.

“Second move of the Heart-killing Sword Technique!”

With a simple thrust of the Triple-kill Sword, he transformed it into a beam of lightning which pierced forth.

It carried a resolute and tireless essence!

The moment it appeared, Heaven and Earth seemed to move for it.

Through Jian Wushuang’s all-out exertion, the power of the technique all the more reached an unbelievable level.

The two lords in front of Jian Wushuang also began to display their Killing Moves.

One of them brandished a sledgehammer which struck ferociously like a giant mountain toward Jian Wushuang.

The other person held a scarlet longsword. He raised both arms and slashed forth with an earth-splitting vigor.

Both of them had also summoned their utmost strength.

In a twinkling, the three different offensives, which were incomparably powerful, collided with each other in the Void of the battlefield.

Boom!

A harsh roar was heard. Waves of residual energy swept in all directions from the spot where the offensives collided. After this exchange, Jian Wushuang retreated forcefully, and only came to a standstill a few dozen feet back.

As for the two lords, they remained within the Void and showed no signs of retreating.

But suddenly... Blargh! Blargh! The two lords spat blood from their mouths and their complexions turned ghastly pale at once.

The sight of this caused the lords from both camps to be dumbfounded.

It was already considered a miracle when Jian Wushuang killed a lord by using a skill of his Saint Realm level earlier on. However, that was achieved through a sneak attack and contained a measure of luck, and thus it was grudgingly acceptable to them.

This time, Jian Wushuang had once again summoned those terrifying Realms. It was normal for people of average strength to possess a few of such unique and powerful skills.

For instance, Myriad Islands Lord was highly proficient and terrifyingly accomplished in the use of Formations.

Jian Wushuang’s possession of such frightening Realm Techniques hence remained within the range of what they could accept.

But how about now?

This had been a head-on exchange.

Jian Wushuang had alone confronted two intermediate lords.

The result was that the two lords were beaten until they spat blood, whereas Jian Wushuang simply retreated unharmed.

“Psst...”

The lords from both camps gasped.

It was only at this moment that they understood that this Saint Realm expert was an exceptional one.

“That little fella...” Silver Wing Lord revealed a look of utter disbelief.

It should be known that, in the beginning, he had believed that Jian Wushuang was essentially seeking death by coming to the Inner Area.

He also remembered that Jian Wushuang once told him that if he ever ran into trouble, Jian Wushuang himself might be able to help. Neither Silver Wing Lord nor Iron Saber Lord took these words seriously back then, but now...
