If Jian Wushuang were notthere,the Monarch of Kingdom Jin could bring doom to the entire Green Fire world onhis own.

However, he had tried tomeasureJian Wushuang’sstrengthin atentative attack and realized the latter might not beany stronger than him now, but definitely would notbe much weaker.

Hedid not have absolute confidence he could defeat Jian Wushuang, even if theywere to fight, flat out.

He would not have the chance to eliminate the Green Fire World as long as Jian Wushuang was in theway.

“No need for any further nonsense, Monarch of Kingdom Jin.The infernobetween your country and Green Fire World has lasted for five millions years andcanonly be terminated with the death of either party. Now is the time to settle the accountsbetween us andbetween the two forces behind us,” said Jian Wushuang in a deep voice.

“To settleour accounts?” the Monarch of Kingdom Jin asked, slightly lifting his mouth. “You seem to be quite confident, huh? Okay, as you wish!” he said.

“Today’s fight will decide to whom this battlefield belongs, and also whichof thetwo forces shall survive,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Bring it!” said the Monarch of Kingdom Jin.

Upon finishing his words, the Monarch of Kingdom Jin waved his hands.?Immediately, his jade-black longspear dissappeared and was replaced with a golden one.

The golden longspear shone with brilliant gloss and exhibited mighty strength that spread all over the sky. It was, apparently, much more powerful than the jade-black one.

The perceived strength ofthe Monarch of Kingdom Jin started to risefiercelyand increased to a new, higher level. His entire bodywas enveloped by the thick glow of divine-like glory, emitting numerous strands of energy, as well as a terrifying sense of threat. Elites from the two forces on the battlefield all shivered with fear upon perceiving his strength.

“Retreat, retreat right away!”shouted the people on the battlefield.

Immediately, the surviving elites from both Kingdom Jin and Green Fire World stopped fighting in unison and retreated to the edge of the battlefield,afraid of being dragged involuntarily into the fierce battlebetweenthese peak powers.

Standing in the void sky, Jian Wushuang’s eyes froze when they perceived the mighty strength exhibited by the Monarch of Kingdom Jin.

“Just as I thought, the Monarch of Kingdom Jin didn’t revealed his full strength before,”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

“Jian Wushuang, be cautious. This guy has truly obtainedextraordinary strength,” said Gu King.

The King of Venomous Worms’ voice suddenly sounded: “When he attacked earilier,only afraction of his Divine Powercould beperceived, which led me to conclude that the Divine Powerinsidehimhadn’t been fully transformed. But now, he must havefinished the transformation and has become a genuineUniverse God!”

“Unverse God? The level beyond Universe Master?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“Definitely,” King of Venomous Worms said and nodded.”A Universe Master would undergo a second transformation from Immortal Dharma Body to Divine Body of Invincibility. Although the Divine Body of Invincibility is obtained, a Universe Master stillhas to extract powerfrom the Spiritual Powerwithinhis system. Thus, he would be half equivalentto a God and half to a human. The advancement from Holy Master to Universe Master is just half a step forward,” he continued.

“A full step forward can betaken only if onebecomes a Universe God, when all Spiritual Power within his system is tranformed into Divine Power.Only acombination of infinite Divine Powerand Divine Body of Invincibility cancreate a genuine immortal God,unparalleled in the Eternal Chaotic world,” he explained further.

“Really?” Jian Wushuang said, nodding to himself understandingly.

The Universe Master fits between the Holy Master and the Universe God.

Becoming a Universe Master was just half a step forward.

A full step forwardcould only be takenifhebecame a Universe God.

Yet, obviously, it would not be easy to take a full step forward.

“A genuine Universe God with complete Divine Power is extremely powerful,” the King of Venomous Worms said solemnly.

“Extreme power is my pursuit!” Jian Wushuang exclaimed, his expression still not changing.

He had absolute confidence in his strength now.

“Havingintergrated three of the most powerful principlesfor swordsmanship and built my Divine Body of Invincibility, how much more powerful can I become?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Let me find out with the Monarch of Kingdom Jin!” he shouted.

Jian Wushuang stuck out his tongue, licking his lips. The Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hands.

The Blood Mountain Sword was a gift from his master, Xuan Yi. The weapon contained the powerto suppress, but did notshow much mighty strength on its own.

But after having intergrated three of the most powerful principles for swordsmanship and advancing to higher levels, when he wielded the Blood Mountain Sword again, the weapon seemed to be much more powerful than he imagined. Its mighty strength had not been fully revealed until now.

The Blood Mountain Sword emitted a gentle, echoing sound while shaking madly. It seemed to be cheering because its mighty strength had finally beendiscovered and activated by Jian Wushuang. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Jian Wushuang could also sense that the Blood Mountain Sword was different now.

“An embryo sword!” he exclaimed.

“ITIS an embyo sword!” the King of Venomous Worms said.

The King of Venomous Worms spoke in shock to Jian Wushuang’s heart.

“I was wondering why a Master of Refining Weapons like yours had gifted you with anseemingly ordinarysword — aChaos Magic Treasure ofnormal level.It’s not until now that I’ve realized that your master has given you an embyo sword!” said the King of Venomous Worms.

“An embyo sword is capable of increasing its own strength continuouslythrough battling and killing. Besides that, if you are able to achieve success in terms of unique skills, the sword’s mighty strength can multiply when you incorporate them into it,” he continued.

“An embyo sword of this kind has always been precious and rare to find in the markets of the Eternal Chaotic world!” exclaimed the King of Venomous Worms.

Upon hearing the King of Venomous Worms’ words, Jian Wushuang smiled distractedly.

He did not care whether it or not it was an embyo sword. All he knew was that his Blood Mountain Sword was very eager to engage in a fierce battle and was thirsty for blood!

It was hungry for the blood of powerful elites!

“Monarch of Kingdom Jin!” Jian Wushuang said, fixing his eyes on the Monarch before him.

“Jian Wushuang!” The Monarch said, staring back at him.

Fire seemed to be burning where their eyes met.

No more exchange of words was needed when their eyes met each other!

Swoosh! Swoosh!

Both of them moved.

The two of them suddenly appeared at the centre of the battlefield.

“Swordsmanship, Skyfall!”shouted Jian Wushuang.

Killing intents were welling up and roaring in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. He wielded the Blood Mountain Sword with both hands and immediately struck downward, following an echoing stern cry.

Splat… The entire space was cut apart.

“Dragon Star!” shouted the Monarch of Kingdom Jin.

Divine Power was springing up from all over the body of the Monarch of Kingdom Jin. The golden longspear in his hands transformed into a flash of golden light, like a giant golden dragon, which roared and instantly broke out of a void in the sky. Fueled by Divine Power, the longspear emitted great and mighty power, enough to shake the whole world.

Bang!

Following a loud boom, the entire sky was torn apart and opened up a huge, boundless black hole.

Both Jian Wushuang and the Monarch of Kingdom Jin retreated into the black hole after the shock, but the Monarch of Kingdom Jin only backed up two steps before being able to stand firmly. Then, he darted out of the hole like a ghost.

“Die!” he shouted.

The Monarch of Kingdom Jin reached Jian Wushuang, piercing his head with the golden longspeart without any resistence.
