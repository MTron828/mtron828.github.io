Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

With the tremendous improvement of his overall power, Jian Wushuang naturally felt more confident.

After all, his power was now comparable with a Peak Universe God in the First Heaven, and he was confident that his unique skill and swordsmanship would not be any weaker than Universe God Qing Yang.

In other words, his current self could fight face-to-face with Universe God Qing Yang and the battle would be very close.

“No hurry. There’s still half a year time. In this half a year, I will continue to digest the accumulation like before, and I can continue to improve my swordsmanship.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and took a seat. He started digesting his previous accumulation.

The time flew and another half a year passed.

The final battle that Jian Wushuang and Universe God Qing Yang had agreed on finally arrived.

In Dayu Palace, there was a training field right in the middle of the sect.

The training field covered over a million miles. It was enough for two Universe Gods to fight as ferociously as they wish. The training field was where Jian Wushuang and Universe God Qing Yang would fight.

At the surrounding of the training field, many inner disciples of Dayu Palace had gathered long ago.

Not only them, but many experts from Scarlet Island, Holy Prefecture and also Golden-sun sect also rushed over too.

A year ago, the news about the final battle between Jian Wushuang and Universe God Qing Yang spread across the lands.

Regardless if it was Jian Wushuang or Universe God Qing Yang, both of them were famous in Dayu World and both of them were real geniuses.

A collision between geniuses naturally caught everyone’s attention.

In the void right before the training field, two thrones were towering side by side, which belonged to the Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang.

The two of them were Universe Gods in the Third Heaven. Hence, they were naturally above the others.

At that very moment, both of them were looking at the training field below. They could recognize the young figure who stood right in the middle of the training field.

“Universe God Qing Yang arrived long ago, where’s Jian Wushuang? It’s already this time and he still hasn’t shown up yet?” The Master of Dayu Palace found it strange.

The people surrounding the training field found it strange too.

“It’s already time, why hasn’t Jian Wushuang show up? Is he afraid?”

“Very likely. He only agreed to fight with Universe God Qing Yang out of an impulse decision. When he calmed down, he must have realized how foolish his decision was. That’s why he’s not showing up!”

“Hehe, not showing up is also a good choice. It’s better than losing his life in the battle.”

People started talking among themselves.

While on the other side, the experts from Scarlet Island saw that Jian Wushuang had yet to show up and they were surprised too. Then, the Master of Scarlet Island walked towards where Jian Wushuang was living personally.

The Master of Scarlet Island knew where Jian Wushuang was soon after he arrived at the huge courtyard where Jian Wushuang resided.

“They are going to fight now and he’s still in the secret room?” The Master of Scarlet Island shook his head and shouted, “Jian Wushuang!”

His voice went through regulations outside the secret room and traveled into Jian Wushuang’s ears, who was quietly cultivating in seclusion in the secret room.

Jian Wushuang was still sitting in the secret room with his eyes closed. He was still digesting the accumulated nature of swordsmanship with full attention. He suddenly heard the Master of Scarlet Island shouting for him and he couldn’t help but crease his eyebrows and finally open his eyes.

“Oh, it’s time?” Jian Wushuang let loose his tightly knitted eyebrows and exited the secret room.

“Island Master.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and greeted the Master of Scarlet Island outside the secret room.

“Jian Wushuang, today is the day you fight against Universe God Qing Yang. Everyone is waiting for you at the training field but you are happy here. You’re not even anxious, still cultivating leisurely in the secret room,” the Master of Scarlet Island teased.

“Haha,” Jian Wushuang laughed, “I’m just too caught up in cultivation and forgot about the time.”

“Everyone outside was saying that you’re not showing up for the battle as you are afraid to fight against the Universe God Qing Yang,” the Master of Scarlet Island said.

“Afraid?” Jian Wushuang smiled, “I, Jian Wushuang, have never been afraid of a battle ever since I was born. In fact, I am quite excited for it.”

Jian Wushuang said casually, but his eyes were beaming with excitement.

When he was in the Green Fire World, he had already heard about Universe God Qing Yang from Jiu Xi.

After he came to Dayu World, Universe God Qing Yang’s name had long resounded in his ears.

The countless cultivators in Dayu World said that he was the top genius in Dayu World, said that he was the number one among Universe God in the First Heaven. Jian Wushuang had heard those claims countless times.

Maybe due to his fame, Jian Wushuang was dying to fight a battle against him.

One year ago, before he achieved such a huge breakthrough in his power, he already accepted the challenge delightedly. Then, when his power increased tremendously, he was even more excited to fight against Universe God Qing Yang.

He also wanted to see how strong the number one Universe God in the First Heaven of Dayu World was.

“Jian Wushuang, when you arrive at the training field, look for the Master of Dayu Palace before you fight. Let him return to you your Blaze Quicksand Gourd. He shan’t reject your request. With Blaze Quicksand Gourd in your hand, your power could be a notch stronger and there’s a higher chance of winning against Universe God Qing Yang,” the Master of Scarlet Island said.

“Blaze Quicksand Gourd?” Jian Wushuang shook his head, “I don’t need Blaze Quicksand Gourd now.”

“Don’t need? You’re so confident?” The Master of Scarlet Island creased his eyebrows.

“Just watch me,” Jian Wushuang smiled. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

As they chatted, they arrived at the training field.

The moment he arrived at the training field, countless pairs of eyes looked at him.

“It’s Jian Wushuang!”

“He’s finally here!”

“He really dared to come here? I thought he ran away.”

The inner disciples from Dayu Palace immediately became noisy.

“Jian Wushuang!”

The Golden-sun Sect Master and a few Universe Gods from Golden-sun Sect gathered together. The Golden-sun Sect Master stared at Jian Wushuang coldly.

Although he couldn’t be certain that Jian Wushuang was the person who killed his son, Jin Feng, he was at least seventy percent sure that Jian Wushuang had something to do with Jin Feng’s death.

“At first, I wanted to find a chance to capture that kid and question him with regards to how Feng died. But from how it looks, I’m afraid I might not have that chance,” the Golden-sun Sect Master sighed.

On the other corner, the few Universe God from Holy Prefecture saw Jian Wushuang’s arrival and their gazes turned cold too, especially the Universe God Jiu Hai.

“This boy is Jian Wushuang?”

“How dare you kill my disciple? I’ll watch how you die today!”

The Universe God Jiu Hai intention to kill was soaring.

Universe God Qing Yang, who had been standing calmly in the middle of the training field, sent a cold gaze when he saw Jian Wushuang arrived.

“You’re finally here?”

Universe God Qing Yang held his fists tight and lifted his head to look at the void before him. He saw that the Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang suddenly appeared in the space.

“Jian Wushuang!”

“You’re lucky. Although you’re not that strong, you should feel honoured to be the stepping stone that allows me to enter the Snow Dojo

“In this battle, fully prepare yourself as my stepping stone…”
