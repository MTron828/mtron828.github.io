Jian Wushuang said in a cold voice.

Upon hearing this, the group of geniuses from the Immortals-killing Empire, who had hidden in the dark, became awfully frightened.

His words struck terror and shock into their hearts.

They had never thought that they would be afraid of a genius from a small empire to such an extent.

However, they had reasons to be terrified.

After all, having arrived here early and then hiding in the dark, they had witnessed what just happened.

They saw Jian Wushuang cut off Ling Xueyu’s two arms with a single stroke.

They also witnessed Jian Wushuang strike a blow that killed 14 top geniuses of the Cosmos Empire, without giving his opponents the opportunity to fight back.

The geniuses of the Cosmos Empire were as strong as those of the Immortals-killing Empire. Since he could kill the former with only one stroke, Jian Wushuang could definitely kill the latter.

They now regretted passing by this place.

“You.”

The scarlet-robed youth, who led the other geniuses of the Immortals-killing Empire, suddenly spoke.

The youth carried a blood-red saber on his back, with a faint killing intent between his eyebrows and a roaring aura around his body.

The youth was called Meng Wutian. He and Ling Xueyu were known as “the two exceptional geniuses” in the Easternmost Hunting.

Being ranked number one in the standings, he was stronger than Ling Xueyu.

“We’re just passing through here. There’s no conflict between our Immortals-killing Empire and your team, so you don’t have to kill all of us, right?” Meng Wutian stuck out his tongue to lick his lips, staring at Jian Wushuang.

He put nothing in his eyes.

He was number one on the standings of Easternmost Hunting.

None of the geniuses was his match in the Twelve Northwestern Dynasties.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang, who was standing in front of him, did not even move, yet he made him feel an unprecedented pressure with his cold stare.

The pressure was even greater than what Meng Wutian had felt when facing an expert at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm.

Jian Wushuang squinted at Meng Wutian but immediately nodded. “You’re right. I don’t have to kill all of you, so... all of you give me your armlets, and I’ll let you go.”

“Give our armlets?”?The expressions of the geniuses of the Immortals-killing Empire suddenly changed.

Armlets represented points.

The aim of this battle in Sky Valley was to earn points.

Now all of them would give their points to Jian Wushuang?

The geniuses of the Immortals-killing Empire were somewhat reluctant, but they acquiesced with a tight smile when thinking about how Jian Wushuang had killed 14 geniuses of the Cosmos Empire with one stroke.

“Jian Wushuang.” Meng Wutian looked serious.

He had seen the standings before, so he knew Jian Wushuang.

“I admit that you’re very strong, at least much stronger than me,” Meng Wutian said in a low voice. “But it’s not my style to give away my points without a fight. Anyway, I will be convinced as long as you fight with me and defeat me.”

Meng Wutian then ignored the surprised expressions of the onlookers from the Immortals-killing Empire. He drew out his blood-red saber and a powerful aura gushed out from his body.

“Let’s fight.”

With a loud cry, Meng Wutian directly lifted up his saber mixed with Raging Fire, Gale, and Destruction Essence Realm. The last realm seemed to be able to destroy everything.

Meng Wutian’s spiritual power reached its peak at this moment.

He launched an attack with his saber.

Boom!

In the blink of an eye, the air ahead of him was cleft in two. The heaven and the earth shook and everything shivered.

A huge flash of the saber shadow instantly swept out.

The stroke seemed to tear heaven and earth.

The onlookers of the Immortals-killing Empire looked frightened when seeing the saber shadow.

Meanwhile, they felt fortunate that they were not the target. Otherwise, they would have died under the streak of the blade light.

However, faced with the terrifying and dazzling blade light, Jian Wushuang was still calm.

While slowly raising his head and staring at the streak of light coming toward him, Jian Wushuang casually struck a blow with his sword.

The casual stroke did not display any swordsmanship, but there was a streak of sword light coming out.

The streak of sword light was a perfect combination of four kinds of sword essence: Earth, Raging Fire, Waterdrop, and Gale.

Shua!

With a sudden faint sound, in the brilliant streak of blade light appeared a crack. It was a cold streak of the sword shadow.

The streak of the sword shadow completely penetrated the blade light as soon as the two of them collided.

Then the sword shadow continued to move forward. In the blink of an eye, it arrived at Meng Wutian.

Chuu!

The cold sword shadow was suspended half of a centimeter away from Meng Wutian.

Jian Wushuang lifted the long sword up and pressed the sword shadow against Meng Wutian. Once he used more strength, the sword edge could easily pierce through Meng Wutian’s throat.

Grunt.

Meng Wutian swallowed his saliva with a blank look.

The other geniuses of the Immortals-killing Empire sucked in a breath of cold air momentarily.

With a stroke, Jian Wushuang had cut off Ling Xueyu’s two arms and killed 14 geniuses of the Cosmos Empire.

Now, it was also another single stroke—an ordinary stroke that Meng Wutian had executed his strongest unique move to fight against, with full power.

The stroke obviously displayed no swordsmanship.

But still, he was outclassed and defeated by Jian Wushuang with that stroke.

There was a huge gap between them.

“You lost.”

Jian Wushuang coldly stared at Meng Wutian.

He did not want to kill Meng Wutian directly because he thought Meng Wutian had a good character. Meng Wutian seemed to be somewhat arrogant, but he hid his conceit and was not as supercilious as Ling Xueyu.

“I lost,” Meng Wutian said with a rueful smile. Then he gave an Interspatial Ring to Jian Wushuang.

“All the armlets I’ve got are in this Interspatial Ring.” Meng Wutian spoke.

After he accepted it, Jian Wushuang glanced at the other geniuses of the Immortals-killing Empire. All of them were scared and took out all their armlets without hesitation.

“Here are all of our armlets.”

“Here you are.”

These geniuses were still quite frightened.

Jian Wushuang nodded and said, “Leave all your armlets and then you can go.”

All the geniuses of the Immortals-killing Empire, including Meng Wutian, had to leave helplessly despite their reluctance.
