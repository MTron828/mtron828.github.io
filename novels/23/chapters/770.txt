Chapter 771: Yun Fan Lost?

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“This is your strongest move?”

While the other spectators were shocked by the strike, Jian Wushuang still wore a frosty expression.

“The power is indeed not bad, but it’s a pity that it will not be enough.”

A cold voice came out of Jian Wushuang’s mouth. It sounded inquestionable and echoed in heaven and earth.

After he finished speaking, he immediately raised up his Emperor Sword. His Spiritual Power was at full blast and Jian Wushuang activated 10% of it.

“The second move of Boundless Heaven Sword Art, Demon-slaying Sword Move!”

Dark golden light was glistening in his eyes. As a Gold-armored Ancient God, he had used activated all of his Ancient God Strength.

Boundless Heaven Sword Art was comprised of seven moves and each move was stronger than the previous one.

The first move, Annihilation Sword Move, was very powerful, but it was far inferior to the second move.

The first and second moves were two whole different levels.

Before entering the Eternal Zone, Jian Wushuang could barely display the first move, Annihilation Sword Move.

But he had stayed in the Eternal Zone for a whole 100 years. 100 years was immensely long to him.

His swordsmanship was already not like before.

He had mastered the second move of Boundless Heaven Sword Art long ago.

A mighty huge crescent-shaped sword shadow lashed out and quickly collided into the Burning Dragon. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Chi! Chi! Chi! The overwhelming power collision caused continuous loud sounds.

Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold. He stared at Yun Fan and spoke in a flat toneless voice.

“Great Elder of Cloud Sea Asgard is just so-so.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice may be calm, but all the more it attracted people’s attention in such a fierce battle.

All the onlookers, including Yun Fan, all heard his words.

Everyone was stunned.

“Great Elder of Cloud Sea Asgard is just so-so?”

“How arrogant!”

However, what happened next made them all shut up.

The crescent-shaped sword shadow actually became even more terrifying.

The Burning Dragon started to fall.

The sword shadow breezed by and split the 10,000-feet-long Burning Dragon into two from its middle.

It did not lower its speed. Instead, it landed violently on Yun Fan.

“Pfft!”

Yun Fan spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, which spattered on the ground.

All the spectators were dumbfounded by the scene.

“Lost, lost?”

“Yun Fan actually lost the fight?”

“He was defeated by Jian Wushuang, a Divine Realm expert?”

“Am I dreaming?”

All of them could not believe what they saw.

After all, Yun Fan was ranked second among the Eternal Realm experts in the Firmament Territory.

It was known that Xuan Yi was the only one that was able to defeat him.

But now, another one could do the same, and he was only a Divine Realm expert.

“He won, he won!”

The nine Palace Masters from the Ancient Sect were over the moon.

They had never thought that Jian Wushaung could defeat Yun Fan. Even him earning the chance to fight with Yun Fan was shocking enough.

But now, Jian Wushuang actually won the fight?

There was once a most heaven-defying Divine Realm expert in the Firmament Territory, but he was only capable of killing ordinary experts at Step One of the Eternal Realm.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang set a record as he had defeated an expert at Step Four of the Eternal Realm.

“The Strongest Divine Realm expert!”

“He is definitely the strongest Divine Realm expert in our history!”

The other experts acclaimed in a low voice.

The whole Void was in chaos never seen before.

On the battlefield, Yun Fan regained his balance and stood up.

His lips and body were stained with blood and his aura became immensely weak. Obviously, he was seriously injured.

He clenched his fists and glared at his opponent deadly.

“I lost? A Divine Realm expert defeated me?”

“How is this possible? How did I lose?”

He snarled in his heart, his eyes full of grievances.

But no matter how he felt, he had lost the fight.

He could not find an excuse when there were so many people looking.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang landed his gaze on him.

“Yun Fan,” Jian Wushuang said plainly in a cold voice, “Now, do you still want me to visit your Cloud Sea Asgard?”

Yun Fan’s expression darkened and his face tingled with embarrassment under everyone’s scornful gaze.

He was simmering with rage.

But he quickly tamed his anger and looked at Jian Wushuang with a grim smile. “Jian Wushuang, you thought that once you defeated me, then we’re done?

“Hum, ridiculous!”

“You’ve come back alive after staying in the Eternal Zone for 100 years. There’s no doubt that you have a big secret.

“The Cloud Sea Asgard is very desperate about finding out the secret, and that is a fact. But did you think that we’re the only ones after it?”

“Hmm?” There was a tiny change in Jian Wushuang’s expression.

“Saber Master, Old Weirdo Dream, you guys have been hiding for so long. It’s time to show up!” Yun Fan suddenly growled.

After which, two figures appeared from a near distance and started dashing over towards them. At the same time, their voices echoed throughout the entire area one after another.

“Haha, Yun Fan, I’ve known you for almost 10,000 years. It’s my first time seeing you suffer terribly in a fight.”

“Humph, defeated by a Divine Realm junior, you don’t deserve your name as Great Elder.”

The two were obviously sneering at him.

The two figures quickly came into sight.

One of them had black short hair, bushy whiskers, and sword-shaped eyebrows. He carried a saber on his back. Standing there with a frosty look, he was like a peerless fierce beast.

The other was a skinny old lady, whose eyes were extremely cold.

Upon seeing the two, the other experts from all sects were greatly taken aback
