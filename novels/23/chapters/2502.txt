Blood Mountain Sword quivered slightly and seemed dissatisfied, but was nonetheless helpless.

“Master Jian, these are the remaining instrument cultivation materials from cultivating the Golden Glazed Life Armor. There is still a drop of Purple Shimmer, but a lot more Red Sun Secret Essence, Red Blood Fruit, Spectacular Beast’s scales, and Celestial Iron Ore. You’ll probably need these materials in the future.” Master Kun handed the remaining materials to Jian Wushuang.

In fact, was it someone else who asked for his favor to cultivate a weapon or an armor, he would have kept the remaining materials for himself.

However, he dared not do the same to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang nodded and accepted the remaining materials. He then took out another Interspatial Ring and said, “Master Kun, this is a small gift for you. Thank you for helping me with the cultivation of my Life Armor.”

There were a lot of resources and treasures in that Interspatial Ring. It was the ring that Jian Wushuang got after killing Strange Old Feng and after splitting the gains with Yun Zhen. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

It was definitely more than enough to pay Master Kun.

However, Master Kun shook his head and refused. “No, no, Master Jian. It’s an honor for me to be able to cultivate your Life Armor, especially when it’s such a rare piece at the ratings of a Heavenly Treasure right after being cultivated. How could I take any reward from you?”

Master Kun was telling the truth.

He never thought he would be able to personally cultivate a Life Armor which was as precious as a Heavenly Treasure.

It was his highest achievement throughout his life in the cultivation of weapons and armor. This achievement was worth much more than any reward in the world.

“Just take it. You have worked so hard for such a long time after all. You shouldn’t be kept busy for no reason. Besides, your furnace has broken in the process of cultivating my Life Armor,” said Jian Wushuang.

Master Kun refused a few times but finally accepted the ring.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining with seriousness. “Master Kun, there is one matter I have to make clear with you. I hope you can keep to yourself about my Heavenly Treasure Life Armor and the fact about my blood essence. Never mention it to anyone in the future. Otherwise, I won’t tolerate such behavior.”

Master Kun knew Jian Wushuang was serious. His face changed as he felt shivers up his spine.

Merely two drops of Jian Wushuang’s blood essence were capable of making the Life Armor to reach the Heavenly Treasure rank. It was simply incredible.

There was no doubt Jian Wushuang had a big secret.

Jian Wushuang would face countless troubles if this news spreads among public ears.

“You can rest assured, Master Jian. I promise to never say anything about cultivating this Life Armor. I can also take a Heavenly Oath today. If I break my promise, I shall immediately die from a demonic heart’s attack,” said Master Kun.

Jian Wushuang raised his brows and felt relieved.

“Master Kun, I want to stay in this chamber for a while to cultivate a secret technique. I wonder if it’s feasible?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course, I’ll personally stand guard to protect you and never allow anyone to disturb you,” said Master Kun.

“Thank you, Master Kun,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

Master Kun soon left and Jian Wushuang was the only one remaining in the chamber. He found a place and sat cross-legged.

“My Life Armor is ready. Next is for me to start cultivating the Nine Sparkle Stars Armor,” Jian Wushuang muttered as he slowly closed his eyes.

Nine Sparkle Stars Armor was one of the five most powerful secret techniques of the Seven Stars Black Sect at its peak. The secret technique was as famous as the Seven Stars Secret Technique and the Divine God of Punishment.

In his Eternal Chaotic World last life, Jian Wushuang saw the scenes where Emperor Bai used the Nine Sparkle Stars Armor.

As soon as the technique was executed, Emperor Bai’s strength instantly skyrocketed! Moreover, the environment of the Eternal Chaos World was bad. Emperor Bai had gone through a lot of erroneous variants and extremes before finally managed to cultivate the secret technique. However, he was unable to fully manifest the power of this secret technique.

During the Ancient God Domain period of time, Jian Wushuang had a chance to display the secret technique in its complete form.

It was a pity if one would like to cultivate such a secret technique, one must have a Life Armor connected to one’s body and blood. Jian Wushuang did not have the Golden Glazed Life Armor previously. Even if he had the cultivation method of the secret technique, he could only look at it but not use it.

There were a total of six chapters in Nine Sparkle Stars Armor Secret Technique, with each representing six different levels.

The chapters consisted of the Black Armor, Golden Armor, Precious Armor, Heavenly Armor, Stars Armor, and the highest level of all—Ultimate Armor!

Emperor Bai first cultivated Golden Armor, which was the secret technique’s second level.

Jian Wushuang had now begun looking into the first level which was the Black Armor chapter.

With his Life Armor and Jian Wushuang’s astuteness, he was able to easily cultivate the Black Armor chapter.

Inside the chamber, Jian Wushuang’s body quivered as a streamer of black light appeared outside of the armor he was wearing. The black light which completely covered Jian Wushuang’s body like battle armor was extremely adamant.

Jian Wushuang seriously murmured, “I have the Golden Glazed Life Armor on me. I now have an extra layer of physical protection ability with the Black Armor and golden Life Armor integration, but Nine Sparkle Stars Armor Secret Technique shouldn’t be so simple.”

Jian Wushuang summoned his Blood Mountain Sword and thrust it forward.

With that simple move, he clearly sensed the power of his sword-light was affected by the black surface on his body. The power of his sword-light had increased exponentially.

Hum!

The sword-light cut onto the void, causing the void in the chamber to quake.

“The power of my sword has doubled! Well, well!” Jian Wushuang was overjoyed.

Nine Sparkle Stars Armor was a secret technique that integrated both attack and defense.

The defense mechanism complemented the Life Armor by strengthening the Life Armor’s protective capabilities and formed an extra body protective barrier at the same time.

Whereas the attack mechanism was a result of the star guided attack mechanism derived from the secret technique. It amplified the powers of any attack performed by Jian Wushuang.

In the Black Armor chapter alone, he was able to double up the power of his various attacks!

The second level, which was the Gold Armor of the Nine Sparkle Stars Armor Secret Technique supposedly boosted his power by three folds.

The third level, Treasure Armor boosted it by six times stronger!

The fourth level was nine times stronger and it went on and on with the remaining levels!

If he was fortunate enough to cultivate the final sixth level—Ultimate Armor chapter, his power would then be increased by 15 times under the Ultimate Armor’s guidance!

That was the Nine Sparkle Stars Armor, one of the five most powerful secret techniques of the Seven Stars Black Sect!

“It’s terrifyingly powerful. The Nine Sparkle Stars Armor is terrifying indeed. No wonder it’s as famous as the Seven Stars Secret Technique and Divine God of Punishment.” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

He had also cultivated another secret technique that integrated both attack and defense mechanisms—the Primordial Void Celestial Body!

Not only does the Primordial Void Celestial Body increase one’s divine body’s strength, but also one’s divine power’s strength.

However, one that simply increased the divine power’s strength was incomparable with the other which greatly increased attacking power!
