Chapter 1640: Challenging The Seventh Level!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

When the abilities of a cultivator achieved a certain level, he would give off a certain amount of pressure.

For example, a Universe God would have the pressure at the level of a Universe God.

However, when someone made a breakthrough to Real God, he would possess the god power. A person’s god power was related to how strong his Divine Power was.

At that moment, the invisible pressure that Jian Wushuang gave off was able to make Gu Jinyu, a Stage Two Six-star Ancient God, frightened. How powerful was his god power?

“Gu Jian, you have made a breakthrough?” Gu Jinyu looked at Jian Wushuang, dumbfounded.

“Yes, I have just made a breakthrough,” Jian Wushuang chuckled.

“However, even if you have made a breakthrough to become a Six-star Ancient God, how can your god power be so powerful all of a sudden?” Gu Jinyu frowned as he murmured.

“I shall make a move first,” Jian Wushuang did not continue talking to Gu Jinyu and he left quickly.

Jian Wushuang continued to walk forward alone.

“As I have only just made a breakthrough, I am not too familiar with manipulating my god power and it will be released from me if I am not careful,” Jian Wushuang laughed. He was already doing his best to control his god power. However, if he wanted to control it perfectly, he would still require some time.

In a split second, Jian Wushuang went to the palace that King Gu Yi lived in and requested an audience with him.

Within the lofty hall.

“As expected, he has made a breakthrough.” King Gu Yu looked at Jian Wushuang in front of him, “Your god power is really very powerful.”

“King Gu Yi, I wish to challenge the seventh level of the Star Moon Tower,” Jian Wushuang said straight away.

“The seventh level?” King Gu Yi frowned, “You have only just made a breakthrough. Wouldn’t it be too early for you to challenge the seventh level now?”

King Gu Yi knew that Jian Wushuang would definitely want to challenge the seventh level of the Star Moon Tower in the future.

However, at that moment, Jian Wushuang had only just made a breakthrough and it was obvious that there was still room for his abilities to improve.

“Gu Jian, you should know that as your realm increases, the abilities of the opponents who you would come across in the Star Moon Tower will rise as well.” King Gu Yi looked over, “Back then, you were only at the level of a Five-star Ancient God. If you were to challenge the seventh level of the Star Moon Tower, you would come across a Stage Three Six-star Ancient God. Of course, it would be a Six-star Ancient God who had just entered Stage Three.”

“However, now, you have made a breakthrough to Six-star Ancient God. By challenging the seventh level of the Star Moon Tower as a Six-star Ancient God, the opponent who you come across will definitely possess the fighting capabilities of a top Stage Three Six-star Ancient God. If you really want a gauge of such a person’s abilities, in terms of the human beings’ Sanctuaries, he should be someone who is extremely close to an expert of the Real God ranking list.”

“Are you sure that you currently have the confidence to face a person with such fighting capabilities?”

“I am confident,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head immediately.

“So confident?” King Gu Yi was surprised.

He did not know about the great rise in abilities of Jian Wushuang when he made a breakthrough to Real God.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang absolutely had the confidence to have a head-on battle with a Chaotic Real God. Although he would be unable to clear the seventh level of the Star Moon Tower at such a level, not to forget, Jian Wushuang still had the Secret Skill of Star Palace.

After two thousand years, he could unleash his Secret Skill of Star Palace again. Moreover, the moment he unleashed it, his attack power would rise by a hundred times. As such, he had absolute confidence that he could defeat the opponent that he would face in the seventh level.

“I have just made a breakthrough and my abilities are in the eruption stage. Hence, what I need to do the most now is train under the aid of a great amount of resources so that I can raise my abilities. As for the resources… the Ancient God Sanctuary does not have them,” Jian Wushuang was very clear about that.

At that moment, what he wanted to raise was his level of comprehension of the Heaven Way, as well as his own Sword Principles.

However, the Lineage of Ancient Gods seemed to have never comprehended the Power of Heaven Way. As such, they naturally did not have the necessary resources. With that, Jian Wushuang decided to return to the human beings’ Sanctuaries.

However, before he left, he had to get his hands on the Moon Picking Skill, which was the last and most powerful Secret Skill of the Ancient God Clan.

“Gu Jian, you are an Inverse Cultivator who has also cleared the Inverse Cultivation Test for the Third Heaven. Hence, I believe that you are definitely not an idiot who always believes that he is in the right. Now, let me ask you one last time. Are you sure that you want to challenge the seventh level of the Star Moon Tower now?” King Gu Yi stared at Jian Wushuang with a grave expression.

“I am sure,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head again.

“Alright.” When King Gu Yi waved his hands, an ancient, pitch-black tower floated out of his hands immediately.

The tower floated out of the palace and appeared on the void above the Ancient God Palace. It then expanded quickly and in just a short amount of time, it had become a one hundred foot tall tower. After that, its great amount of aura spread across the area immediately. Other than the Ancient God Palace, the vigorous aura of the Star Moon Tower also spread across each and every corner of the Gu King City immediately.

Many Ancient Gods within the Gu King City were attracted over straight away.

“It’s the Star Moon Tower!”

“The Star Moon Tower has opened up again?”

“The previous time, the super genius named Gu Jian opened up the Star Moon Tower and he cleared the first six levels in one go. This time around, who has opened up the Star Moon Tower?”

Filled with doubts and excitement, countless Ancient Gods headed toward the Ancient God Palace.

Many top experts of the Ancient God Palace also asked King Gu Yi about the matter.

King Gu Yi replied straight away and said that Jian Wushuang wanted to challenge the seventh level!

With that, the experts in the Ancient God Palace were completely shocked.

In the vast void, a giant sacrificial altar floated up again and it was filled with towering, vigorous auras.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

All of a sudden, two figures appeared on the sacrificial altar.

Upon seeing the approaching people, everyone on the sacrificial altar stood up immediately and greeted them.

The approaching people were King Gu You, the current ruler of the Gu King City, as well as his brother, King Gu Tong.

At that moment, both of them were the people with the greatest authority in the Gu King City. When they received King Gu Yi’s message and got to know that Jian Wushuang was about to challenge the seventh level of the Star Moon Tower, both of them came personally.

On the ground, countless Ancient Gods were gathered together. All of them also knew that the person who wanted to challenge the Star Moon Tower was still ‘Gu Jian,’ the person who created a miracle two thousand years ago.

“I thought that someone else wanted to challenge the Star Moon Tower. However, I did not expect the person to actually be Lord Gu Jian and he actually wants to challenge the seventh level!”

“The seventh level. The highest level of the Star Moon Tower is the seventh level!”

“In just a short two thousand years, I wonder if Lord Gu Jian will really be able to clear the seventh level.”

Everyone was either filled with excitement and discussing the matter.

Everyone was looking forward to it.

When Jian Wushuang cleared the first six levels of the Star Moon Tower in one go previously, he had caused an uproar in the whole Ancient God Sanctuary.

At that moment, if he were able to clear the seventh level, he would definitely become a legend. From then on, no matter how many years passed, he would still be talked about by the experts of the Ancient God Clan enthusiastically.

However, the premise was that he must be able to clear the seventh level.

King Gu Tong, who was sitting on one of the two thrones at the center of the sacrificial altar, looked down with his proud eyes and asked, “Are you really confident? Please don’t send yourself to death.”

“I am confident,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“Alright then. Please go ahead,” King Gu Tong waved his hands.

Jian Wushuang drew a light breath. After that, under the observance of countless eyes around him, he moved toward the Star Moon Tower. In the blink of an eye, he entered the Star Moon Tower.
