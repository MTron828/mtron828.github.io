Chapter 1406: Eight Wins Out Of Eight!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Looking at the three demonic dragons, the surrounding disciples were shocked.

Jian Wushuang defeated Xiao Yue with the three demonic dragons.

But then, the opponent of the three demonic dragons was Xia Feng, who was much stronger than Xiao Yue.

“Humph!”

Xia Feng humped and then the gold maces in his hands gave out a resplendent golden light. The two gold maces went through the void like lightning and reappeared above the three demonic dragon’s skulls.

Thud! Thud! Thud!

The three continuous, low thuds were heard and a fierce divine power exploded. The three demonic dragons’ skull broke and an enormous amount of Soul Power dispersed.

Xia Feng moved and appeared before Jian Wushuang. He slammed down the two gold maces without pulling any funny business.

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes but didn’t dodge. The black tortoise shell on the surface of his body gave out a sharp brightness.

Dang! Dang!

The gold mace hit the shell and the huge black tortoise vibrated vigorously but it didn’t show any sign that it was going to collapse.

“This shell is quite sturdy, huh?”

Xia Feng complimented but suddenly, there was a surge of golden light from his body. There was originally just two arms but suddenly there were another two muscular arms that popped up. Now he had four arms in total and every arm held a gold mace.

“Break!”

Xia Feng roared and the four arms waved together. The four gold mace carried great power and slammed down on the tortoise shell like lightning.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

There was loud clashing sound that rang continuously. The gold mace hit the tortoise shell over and over again and every time the shell would vibrate vigorously.

As the number of times the gold mace hit the tortoise shell grew, the entire black tortoise started trembling in the balance.

“Xia Feng was obviously much stronger than Xiao Yue. He lives up to his identity as a disciple of Star Palace,” Jian Wushuang complimented. Then, he suddenly lifted his head.

“Xia Feng, didn’t you want to experience my dreamland technique? Let me fulfill your request!”

As Jian Wushuang spoke, there was a flash of crimson light that spurted from his eyes.

The crimson light was like a huge crimson sun. It was so eye-catching that everyone in the area couldn’t help but look over.

Xia Feng naturally looked towards the crimson sun as well. Suddenly, the surrounding image churned and he came to the first floor of the borderless hell.

“It’s dreamland!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Break. Break it!!!”

Xia Feng roared and his consciousness in the sea of consciousness surged in madness. He wanted to shake off the dreamland.

But at that very moment, Jian Wushuang who was protected by the black tortoise, suddenly charged forward and wielded Blood Mountain Sword.

“Break!!!”

Xia Feng’s entire body was straining with anger. With his fierce and determined consciousness, he finally came back to reality from the dreamland.

“I’m out!” Xia Feng just revealed his joyous expression and suddenly a chilly sword gleam continuously grew in his eyes.

Too close. The distance was too close.

When he realized, it was already too late for him to avoid any tricks.

Swoosh!

The sword light stopped one centimeter before his throat. Then, a cold voice was heard.

“Xia Feng, you lost!”

The voice was cold and expressionless, but it sounded like a heavy explosion to Xia Feng’s ears.

“How could it be?” Xia Feng shivered and he was dissatisfied.

After all, he had already freed himself from the dreamland but in the end, he still lost!

“Just a little, just that little!”

“If I were to shake the dreamland off slightly earlier, I would be able to block his sword in time!”

Xia Feng mumbled to himself but he had already seen the reason as to why he had lost to Jian Wushuang.

At the end of the day, it was because his consciousness was slightly weaker. Hence, he couldn’t shake off the dreamland earlier.

After all, Jian Wushuang could totally take action the moment he fell into dreamland. However, although he shook off the dreamland, he was slower in speed to the extent that he couldn’t block Jian Wushuang’s sword in time.

“Jian Wushuang,” Xia Feng lifted his head and looked at Jian Wushuang, “Your consciousness and the dreamland attack are really powerful. No wonder you could win against Luo Quan so easily. The other eight disciples in the second rotation battle wouldn’t be able to resist that, besides Ling Feibai. Even if they could free themselves from the dreamland, they wouldn’t be able to block your sword.”

“As for Ling Feibai, his strength of consciousness reached the level of a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven long ago. With your magic alone, it would be impossible for you to take him.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“Alright, let’s announce the results,” Xia Feng looked at the deacon elderly by his side.

The deacon elderly immediately announced the result. The one who had won the battle was Jian Wushuang.

However, even though Jian Wushuang had won, many disciples felt that it was a pity for Xia Feng because Xia Feng had freed himself from the dreamland. It was merely because he was slightly slower that he couldn’t block Jian Wushuang’s sword in time. Otherwise… No one would have been able to tell who would win the battle.

Above the boundless Milky Way.

“Even Xia Feng lost to Jian Wushuang. It seems that the only one who could defeat him in the rotation battle is Ling Feibai.”

“Tsk tsk.”

“It’s a pity but it’s not definite. I feel that Jian Wushuang still has my trump cards hidden in his pocket.”

“I think so too.”

“Haha, let’s continue to watch.”

The deacon elderlies chatted amongst themselves casually. They were in a good mood.

They were glad to see the disciples under them fight vigorously.

On Titanic Star, the rotation battle continued.

The rest of the battle was just as Xia Feng had said. There was no one from the rest of the disciples who could resist Jian Wushuang’s dreamland – besides Ling Baifei. Even if they resisted and shook it off, they couldn’t block Jian Wushuang’s sword in time. In the end, they could only be defeated by Jian Wushuang, one after another.

The time flew by. After half a day, the rotation battle came to an end.

By that time, Jian Wushuang had already been through eight out of nine battles.

In the eight battles, he had fought against eight disciples. The result was eight wins out of eight and there was only one left.

The opponent for his last battle was similarly a genius that had experienced eight wins out of eight. His name was Ling Feibai!

Lineage of Star, the battle among disciples who were Universe Gods in the Second Heaven, the last rotation battle would be between the strongest two!
