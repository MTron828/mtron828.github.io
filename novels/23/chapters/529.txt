Chapter 530: Absolute Advantage!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Hum...

As Jian Wushuang waved his hand, a vast blood river surged forward, superimposed by the Thousandfold Realm, and spread out while surrounding and suppressing Fang Han.

Then, Jian Wushuang drew his sword and infused it with his powerful physical strength before he silently swung it out.

A silent sword shadow flickered with a dazzling light and a level of force which seemed like it could decimate anything in the world.

The sword shadow flitted through the open area between them, leaving behind a Sword River that persisted for a short period of time.

It was the fourth move of the Heart-killing Sword Technique, Sheer Shadow!

“How dazzling!”

The sergeants around couldn’t help closing their eyes.

They had to. The sword move Jian Wushuang used was too bright and dazzling, causing their eyes to feel a burning sting.

“This sword stroke...” Fang Han, who had been underestimating this attack, suddenly became nervous when he saw Jian Wushuang’s sword sweeping toward him.

A faint sense of crisis arose in his heart.

He dared not be careless anymore.

He tightly gripped his Giant Axe and held it high while it simultaneously burst with raging flames. As Fang Han roared, he hacked out as if he was trying to split the world in half.

The Giant Axe sliced through the air with a great power that astonished everyone in the area.

Jian Wushuang’s silent but extremely bright sword shadow also slashed its way toward it.

“Bang!”

The two terrible forces collided like falling stars. A shattering sound reverberated out as the space where the collision happened began to compress. It seemed as if the surrounding area was going to crumble.

“That boy!”

Fang Han, who had looked down upon Jian Wushuang before, was deeply shocked now.

“How can his attack be so powerful?”?Fang Han stared at the area in front of him as the two forces were still going head-to-head in a fierce confrontation. Nevertheless, It was obvious to him that he was getting tired because the power of his Axe Shadow had been gradually weakening.

In contrast, Jian Wushuang’s sword was still bright and dazzling, and it was even growing in strength.

Apparently, Jian Wushuang had a huge advantage in this confrontation.

“How is it possible? He hasn’t even fought any Demonic Beast. How can a young man become so powerful without experiencing all sorts of challenges and danger?”Fang Han roared in his heart, but his face was full of shock.

Experts usually refined their skills and improved their strength through challenges and dangerous situations.

He heard that Jian Wushuang had come from a small tribe and had only just become a Divine General recently. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

That meant that he had not encountered many challenges. He should not have been this strong, however ...

Fang Han did not know that Jian Wushuang had not been born on the Monster Continent.

It was true that he had never fought with any Demonic Beasts and had no battle experience on the Monster Continent. Nevertheless, he had grown up while surviving through cruel battles and slaughter in the Divine Land.

When accepting the Divine General assessment, Jian Wushuang had not used his Sword Soul Power. With only his physical strength, seven Origin Marks, and the third move of the Heart-killing Sword Technique, he had managed to pass the fourth round, which was possible only for the strongest of Second-grade Divine Generals.

That was to say, Jian Wushuang had been comparable with Fang Han even without the use his Sword Soul.

In addition, after meditating for ten days inside the Earth Core Palace and condensing the eighth Origin Mark, Jian Wushuang had greatly improved his current level of strength.

During the two months he spent in the Sky Solitude Mountains, his comprehension of Sword Principle had been enhanced greatly. Not only had he mastered the Thousandfold Realm, which increase the power of his domain, he had also comprehended Sheer Shadow, the fourth move of the Heart-killing Sword Technique, which caused his strength skyrocket.

He was definitely much stronger now than he had been when he participated in the Divine General assessment.

While using his Sword Soul, he was confident that he could battle with an ordinary Divine Emperor.

Fang Han, who was merely a peak Second-grade Divine General, imposed no sense of threat on Jian Wushuang.

“Hmph!” Jian Wushuang snorted. The bright sword shadow that had forced Fang Han to step backwards began to shine even brighter.

“I can’t hold on any longer,” Fang Han cried out in shock.

Swoosh! The sword shadow slashed through the air towards Fang Han, with its violent power numbing Fang Han’s hands.

Whoosh! Fang Han’s Giant Axe had been directly knocked away.

Jian Wushuang strode toward Fang Han and then stretched out his hand at lightning speed.

“Kneel!”

Along with the yell, he directly used his incredible physical strength to push Fang Han’s head down.

Fang Han was immediately forced to the ground, then Jian Wushuang strode one step forward and stamped on him heavily.

A huge round hole, about a meter deep, appeared on the ground, with stones tumbling towards the bottom of the hole.

Boom!

Fang Han spurted a mouthful of blood and his face turned dreadfully pale.

Jian Wushuang bent down to pick up Fang Han as if lifting a chick.

“Get lost!”

He threw Fang Han towards a nearby camp, which immediately broke into pieces.

Everything became calm once again.

Although so many things took place, everything after Jian Wushuang attacked happened in the blink of an eye.

While the sergeants were still dazed and confused, the battle had already been settled.

Seeing Fang Han lying there, covered in blood and struggling to get up, the sergeants were astonished.

They were absolutely stunned!

Stupefied!

It was so incredible!

When Jian Wushuang first appeared, they had thought that he, as a squad leader, was crazy for daring to challenge a commander.

But now, the actual result was beyond everyone’s expectations.

Right then...

“What are you doing here?” They suddenly heard an imposing voice.

All the sergeants, including Jian Wushuang, turned to look at him. It was a thin black-clothed elder who released a powerful Dao aura, revealing his identity as a Divine Emperor.

“General.”

Everyone bowed to him.

In the East Camp, all experts at the Divine Emperor level were generals.

“General, please help me,” Fang Han immediately cried out in grief.

The black-clothed elder glanced at Fang Han with a serious look and asked, “What happened?”

“General, it was Jian Wushuang. He’s a squad leader under my command. He almost killed me just now. He is trying to rebel!” Fang Han shouted while pointing at Jian Wushuang.
