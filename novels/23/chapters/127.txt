Chapter 128: Two Years

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

At the moment, when Jian Wushuang combined the sword essences of Raging Fire and Gale, the robust man who had been silently watching from the void above the sword tomb immediately smiled and said, “It only took him one year and three months to combine two sword essences.”

“Heng, he is lucky,” The absolute beauty?coldly groaned.

After combining them, the sword moves Jian Wushuang executed were even more terrifying than before. Since his strength had increased again, his fight with the Sword Tomb guards became easier.

Winter came again.

The outside world was filled with drifting snowflakes, but in the Ancestor’s Land, beneath the abyss, it was still dark.

It had been two years since Jian Wushuang came to the Sword Tomb.

“It’s been two years. Let the boy leave,” said the absolute beauty. “In addition, give him this sword skill.”

“This is... Selfless Sword Technique?” The robust man had a puzzled expression.

“In the past two years, I have constantly increased the difficulty of the Sword Tomb guards. It was too harsh. This sword skill is a kind of compensation for him.” After finishing her words, the absolute beauty turned around and disappeared into the void.

The robust man smiled and immediately dropped down.

Down below, Jian Wushuang had just defeated the 24th Sword Tomb guard since entering the Sword Tomb.

“Not enough. Whether it’s the Sword Essence of Earth or Waterdrop, it is not enough.” Jian Wushuang frowned slowly.

Nine months ago, he combined the Sword Essences of Gale and Raging Fire to form the Fiery Wind Sword Essence. After combining them successfully, he naturally wanted to combine a third sword essence. However, the combination of three sword essences was more difficult than two sword essences.

After nine months of hard work, the Sword Essences of Earth and Waterdrop were close to combining with the Fiery Wind Sword Essence. But he was unsuccessful.

“It’s been two years.”

Jian Wushuang sighed in silence, looking at the numerous sword scars around him.

In these two years, he studied many of the sword scars, but it was still only a small section of the whole Sword Tomb. He still could not comprehend the most exceptional sword scars, like the sword scars engraved on the six stone tablets.

Even now, the Sword Tomb was still filled with endless opportunities.

However, when he came to the Sword Tomb, he heard the conversation while he was barely conscious, so he knew he could only stay in the Sword Tomb for two years.

Now that two years was up, he should be leaving if there were no accidents.

Sure enough, just when the idea of leaving occurred to him, he saw a robust man descend and appear in front of him.

Jian Wushuang had a strange feeling as he stared at this man. There was a sense of horror that made his heart tremble while looking at this man, even though he was standing here like a normal person, with no aura.

The most important point was that no life could be felt from the robust man.

He didn’t seem human, more like a puppet?

“Two years have passed. Follow me.” The robust man’s expression was cold.

Jian Wushuang nodded. Although he was extremely intrigued by the Sword Tomb, he had to leave. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Sir, I want to ask some questions about the Ancestor’s Land...”

On the way, Jian Wushuang also wanted to ask something. After all, he was still very confused and filled with countless questions, but he was rebuked by the robust man when he opened his mouth.

“Shut up!”

“Based on your current strength, you are not qualified to ask anything about the Ancestor’s Land. You must pass a test after reaching the Yin-Yang Void Realm if you want to know.”

Jian Wushuang was startled and did not dare to ask again.

“Here it is.”

Not long after, the robust man and Jian Wushuang came to an empty area.

There were many mysterious cracks on the surface of this empty area. As the man put a special gem into the mysterious crack, the mysterious crack immediately burst with dazzling light. The space in front of Jian Wushuang split, and a huge crack, which could accommodate a person, appeared.

“What is this?” Jian Wushuang stared at the huge rift in shock.

He had seen plenty of huge rifts on the ground. And, with his current strength, his sword strikes could easily leave a deep crack in the ground. However, this rift in front of him was not on the ground but in the void!

It’s a wormhole that can connect two different spaces,” the robust man said.

“Wormhole? Connect two different spaces? There is another space?” Jian Wushuang could not help but ask.

“You will know when you get there.” The robust man did not answer directly. “Since you have come to the Ancestor’s Land, we can’t let you go home empty handed. Now, this sword skill is yours. Though it is only the first half of the volume, it will be useful.”

Then the robust man gave Jian Wushuang the sword skill.

Jian Wushuang took it and said, “Selfless Sword Technique?”

“Okay, now you have to leave.” After saying this, the robust man directly grabbed Jian Wushuang by the collar and threw him straight into the rift. Jian Wushuang was thrown into the crack without resistance and disappeared.

...

In an extremely dark hidden cave.

The cave was quite old. No one had visited it in a long time, so the wall was covered with moss.

On the empty ground at the center of the cave, many mysterious cracks suddenly radiated a dazzling light. The void above the mysterious cracks was ripped apart, leaving a streak in the huge rift. Then, a figure dashed out.

BANG!

Jian Wushuang’s body slammed into one of the stone walls, making the walls shake so much that gravel fell from them.

“That really hurt.”

Jian Wushuang groaned because of the pain. After a while, he pulled himself together and began to look around.

“A cave?”?Jian Wushuang looked at his surroundings.?“Where is this? Am I still in the Endless mountain range?”

Jian Wushuang immediately stumbled along the cave path, toward the exit.

The exit of this cave was blocked by a pile of stones. Seeing this, Jian Wushuang brandished his sword and directly cleave a path through those stones, then he stepped outside of the cave.

“This is...”?

When Jian Wushuang walked out of the cave and saw the vibrant primordial forest blanketed in the floating black fog, his look immediately became bizarre.

“The Dark Forest!”

“It should be the Dark Forest!”

Three years ago, the first time he was hunted by Blood Feather Tower. When he escaped from the Sword Marquis Mansion, in order to evade Blood Feather Tower, Sima Bu and he eventually decided to cross the Dark Forest. Jian Wushuang was familiar with this area because he had stayed here for four months.

But what surprised him was that the other end of the wormhole was in the Dark Forest.

The Dark Forest was adjacent to Tianyan Province and next to Bashui Commandery!
