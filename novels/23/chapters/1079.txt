Chapter 1080: Hysterical

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Having devoured the Bloodline Power the Ancient Monster Clan, Celestial Master Ku Xin’s strength had reached an unprecedented high level.

He has the utmost confidence in the skillfulness of his craft.

However, Jian Nantian’s sword had snaked near him.

“What?”

A fearful expression escaped Celestial Master Ku Xin.

He could not have suppressed it because, at that moment, he feared instinctively.

When he saw the silent sword, the supreme expert Sunrise Sword Emperor crossed his mind.

He thought of Sunrise Sword Emperor when Jian Nantian performed the swordsmanship.

“How could it be?”

“It’s impossible!”

“No, I can’t believe it!”

Furious, Celestial Master Ku Xin screamed at the top of his lungs. His face twisted as his tremendous Bloodline Power surged, the heavenly monster spectral image roared behind him.

Boom! The immense Bloodline Power took on the shape of a red giant hand once more.

The hand clenched, like a falling meteor, and thumped.

All of the sudden, the meteor and the sword light clashed.

Swish!

A low voice echoed, accompanied by a dazzling light.

The seemingly quiet sword light had released its World-shattering power at this moment.

The giant “meteor” hand was sliced into two. Having penetrated the palm, the unstoppable sword light kept sailing toward Celestial Master Ku Xin, and finally, fell on him.

He had created a protection with the red clouds. Being a Celestial Master in Exceptional Realm, he had built himself well.

“Pfft!”

Celestial Master Ku Xin spat out a mouthful of blood. His face whitened. The Bloodline Power he had swallowed were all pressed against his body. As a result, they started eroding and even injured the Celestial Master more.

Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!

Thunderous sound burst out from the Celestial Master’s body. Blood gushed from his ears, nose, and eyes. He seemed to grow old in a second as he was pushed backward.

“Upper Elder!”

Seeing this, experts of Ancient Monster Clan all showed an expression of surprise. Then, Celestial Master Winter Whistle went out of his way to catch Celestial Master Ku Xin.

When Celestial Master Ku Xinr got back on his feet, he spat another mouthful of blood. At this moment, he was vulnerable than ever.

“He’s lost!”

Those experts all gasped.

Celestial Master Ku Xin had tried everything, all the trump cards, and skills, from opening the Energy-gathering Formation to swallowing the Bloodline Power they had collected. He had shown a capability that greatly exceeded that of a Celestial Master. But in the end, he lost.

“My father’s blow…” Jian Wushuang could not help but widened his eyes, reflecting on the formidable blow.

He knew it was called Dream-chasing.

“That strike, if I’m right, comes from an outstanding expert in the Eternal Chaotic World.” Gu King suddenly came to comment. “Though less formidable than the founder of Star Bloodline, King Luo Zhen, he really mastered the swordsmanship. He’s created a swordsmanship of 12 styles. Your father must have been copied the first style, more preciously, the half of the first one.

“However, your father is gifted and has devised a new set of swordsmanship via his own understanding. He’s performed seven-tenths power. Moreover, being in the Exceptional Realm, he invented the strongest Sword Principle. When he goes to extreme length to perform the style, his power has already surpassed the Celestial Master level.

“In terms of power, your father has crushed the jade token with the power of Samsara Temple Master. That strike is just as powerful as that.”

Hearing Gu King, Jian Wushunag gasped in admiration.

Although he had temporarily surpassed the Celestial Master level by the Bloodline Power, Celestial Master Ku Xin was still ranked below Samsara Temple Master. He did not actually possess the battle strength at a Supreme Level.”

But his father swordsmanship could totally compete with that of Samsara Temple Master.

It was no wonder he defeated the Celestial Master with just one strike.

“However, your father hasn’t fully reached the Supreme Level yet. He’s taken a lot of effort to perform the swordsmanship. In this fight, he might probably be able to do it just once.” Gu King added.

Jian Wushuang nodded.

With just one strike, his father had been really formidable.

Now, the fight had drawn into an end as Celestial Master Ku Xin lost the battle.

Retracting his longsword, Jian Nantian even did not bother looking at his opponent. Instead, he directly cast a look forward.

He was staring at a skyscraping mountain. On the peak of the mountain stood an ancient black tower.

That was the very Heaven-ceasing Mountain!

Jian Nantian clenched his fist and walked toward the towering Heaven-ceasing Mountain.

The Ancient Monster Clan’s Protective Array had broken.

Jian Wushuang had beaten Celestial Master Winter Whistle, and the Silver-armored Ancient God of the three great Celestial Masters.

Even the most capable Celestial Master Ku Xin had suffered a defeat. He was badly injured, unable to fight again.

No one in the Ancient Monster Clan was able to stop him anymore.

As the crowd watched, he walked toward the peak step by step. He was so close to it.

“Jian Nantian!”

The Celestial Master was roaring, almost hysterically. “Do you think you can take her?”

“You can’t, you can’t!”

“You have no idea how important she is. She’s treasured by us, and by the entire Green Fire World!” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“We won’t allow you, Green Fire Palace and Green Fire World won’t allow you either!”

“You can’t take her!”

He was roaring hysterically, everyone turned their head and frowned. None of them could make sense of his words.

On the other hand, Jian Nantian stopped, turned around, and faintly smiled.

“If I can be with her, so what if Green Fire World, even the Eternal Chaotic World turns against me?”
