Chapter 2596: Divine Elixir Pill

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“After Zhong Hun was hit hard by the two of us, he displayed a life-saving secret technique which drastically reduced his strength. Anyhow, he was a genuine Heaven Ultimate God after all. He had always been good at soul attacks and was not one to be trifled with. You must have something up your sleeves to be able to kill Zhong Hun.” Su Qin smiled.

“I was just lucky. If he was at his peak or had recovered his strength to about seventy or eighty percent, I will have to run when I see him,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Perhaps.” Su Qin smiled faintly and paused before continuing to say, “Territorial Lord, although you killed Zhong Hun, there’s something in his Interspatial Ring that is extremely important to me and my junior sister.”

“What is it?” Jian Wushuang’s expression remained unchanged but was quite wary.

He knew Su Qin must have a purpose for the visit. Jian Wushuang was leaning toward believing they were there for Zhong Hun’s treasures.

Jian Wushuang was surprised to hear that they were only after one thing.

“It’s a token. A very special token. You can have a look at Zhong Hun’s Interspatial Ring and should be able to find it in the ring,” said Su Qin.

“A special token?” Jian Wushuang raised his brows and was immediately reminded of the token related to the Witchcraft and Wizardry Sect.

That must be the token that Su Qin wanted but Jian Wushuang did not immediately take it out. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Territorial Lord, you rightfully own everything that Zhong Hun left behind since you’re the one who killed him. However, the token is essential to my sister and me. We have to bring it back to our sect to complete our mission. We earnestly hope you can give it to us. We won’t take it from you without compensation of course. We’ll give you something in return.”

After Su Qin finished speaking, he waved his hand, and three white elixir pills that exuded an alluring scent appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“What are these?” Jian Wushuang looked at those three elixir pills with his sharply constricted pupils.

Those three elixir pills contained a surging divine power that sparked Jian Wushuang’s excitement.

Their power was very pure—at least countless times purer than the Primordial Stones’ divine power which he used to improve his cultivation realm!

“These are Divine Elixir Pills. You should know about it.” Su Qin smiled.

Jian Wushuang was shaken up.

He knew about the Divine Elixir Pills of course!

It contained pure divine power and was especially used by cultivators above the Undying Saint Realm to restore their divine power!

Under normal circumstances, an ordinary Undying Saint who had exhausted his divine power needed approximately ten pills to completely recover his strength.

In short, these elixir pills were useful even to an Undying Saint.

The market price of a Divine Elixir Pill was worth 5,000,000 Primordial Stones!

It was the accepted exchange price. However, one was only able to exchange Divine Elixir Pills for Primordial Stones as not many would be willing to do it the other way round.

‘I’m only one step away from Peak Ultimate God realm. I wanted to rely on absorbing and refining Primordial Stones to make a breakthrough, but I’ve used up a huge amount of Primordial Stones and got the very minimal effect after spending a month in seclusion. If I want to make a breakthrough, I must find something with purer divine power than Primordial Stones. I’m sure the divine power contained in these elixir pills is countless times stronger than those contained in the Primordial Stones.

‘These Divine Elixir Pills came handy for me!’

Jian Wushuang was very excited upon looking at the three Divine Elixir Pills before him, but he kept a straight expression.

“Master Su Qin, do you mean that you want to use these three Divine Elixir Pills to exchange for that token?” Jian Wushuang asked flatly.

“Yes, these three Divine Elixir Pills will be yours as long as you are willing to give me the token.” Su Qin smiled.

“I wonder why it’s only worth three Divine Elixir Pills if the token is so important for both of you?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Su Qin glanced at the red-clothed girl, Liu Xian’er next to him before explaining, “Truthfully, the token is of no use to my junior sister or me, but it’s beneficial to our sect. As for what it’s used for, even Junior Sister and I don’t know anything about it as our mission is only to bring it back to our sect.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang raised his brows before asking, “May I know which sect both of you come from?”

“Where do I come from? What does it have to do with you?” Liu Xian’er who had been quiet finally let out a cold snort and glared coldly at Jian Wushuang.

“Junior Sister.” Su Qin reprimanded and switched to a gentle tone. “Sorry, my junior sister is a little impatient. We received an order from our sect Elders never to reveal the name of our sect unless we are in a critical life or death moment. We ask for your kind understanding, Territorial Lord.”

“That’s alright.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand a few times, feeling quite embarrassed. After pondering for a while, Jian Wushuang kept the three Divine Elixir Pills in front of him into the Interspatial Ring before taking out the special token.

“Masters, is this what you’re looking for?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Su Qin looked at the token and instantly discharged his soul power.

After a while, his face sank before cracking a smile. “Indeed, this is the token. Thank you, Territorial Lord.”

“I should be the one thanking both of you.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“My junior sister and I shall leave now since we’ve gotten the token.” Su Qin no longer lingered around.

“Have a safe trip.” Jian Wushuang got up to send them away.

After a while, Su Qin and Liu Xian’er left the Territorial Lord Mansion.

Jian Wushuang finally let out a sigh of relief after watching the two of them left and completely disappeared from his sight.

“These two people...are so weird!” Jian Wushuang murmured.

It was weird indeed!

They were two powerful Heaven Ultimate Gods, especially Su Qin. With their intimidating strength, those two people could easily force Jian Wushuang to hand over the token. Even if they chose not to be harsh, they should at least behave like a powerful expert.

However, Su Qin was very kind to Jian Wushuang apart from the desolated look shown by Liu Xian’er. Su Qin did not even have the air of a prideful person. Not only was he not harsh, but he also offered three Divine Elixir Pills in exchange for the token.

How easy going!

Su Qin seemed like an easygoing person with no temper at all.

Jian Wushuang who had experiences from his previous and present life would not be so naive as to believe Su Qin was a kind person.
