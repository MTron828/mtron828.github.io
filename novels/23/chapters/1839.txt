Chapter 1840: The Last Counterattack

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Bang!

The loud noise shook the earth. Jian Wushuang’s face grew dim. He could feel that the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand was extremely unyielding.

In the unyieldingness, Blood Mountain Sword was slashed to the side and the towering axe shadows containing some power hit Jian Wushuang’s body.

“Sh*t,” Emperor God Liu Guang was shocked.

“Sword Emperor?” Emperor God Jiu Yin stared.

Hong!

A terrifying power spread like a rising tide.

Jian Wushuang’s body quivered and then flew off like a bomb. He flew over ten of thousands of miles before he regained his stability.

When he steadied himself, Jian Wushuang’s face was slightly paler than it had been before.

Looking at the scene, Emperor God Liu Guang and Emperor Jiu Yin were astonished.

“Are… are you joking?” Emperor God Jiu Yin looked in disbelief. “Fortress Master Hong Tian burned his Soul Power, it is the strongest attack that he performed with his all. Even Emperor God Liu Guang would have been injured if she took the hit directly. But Sword Emperor, the huge axe hit his body and only his face turned pale slightly? That’s it?”

“How is it possible?” Emperor God Liu Guang was shocked too.

Such a terrifying hit, even though Jian Wushuang had blocked half of its power with his sword, the remaining power theoretically could kill an Emperor God too.

In the end, Jian Wushuang merely turned slightly paler from the axe hit. There was no bleeding, let alone spitting blood or being severely injured.

His defense power was this strong?

Jian Wushuang looked at the crimson armor surfacing on his body in surprise.

The crimson armor was originally blotted with rust. However, when it recognized Jian Wushuang’s as its owner, it resumed its original look and became extremely eye-catching, like magma from a volcano. The reason why Jian Wushuang wasn’t injured from the fierce hit by Fortress Master Hong Tian was because of the crimson armor.

“Five Gem Armor… Senior Wu Hun really gave me a great treasure,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

The crimson armor, which was Five Gem Armor, was something that had been relied upon by experts in ancient times.

Jian Wushuang had obtained only the damaged Five Gem Armor and it could only perform less than ten percent of its power. Even so, its defense power was far beyond Jian Wushuang’s imagination. Jian Wushuang had even thought that the defense power of?Five Gem Armor then was much stronger than the Chaotic Divine Treasure level armor that Emperor God Tian Xiao was wearing back then.

In addition to Jian Wushuang’s strong divine body, because of his possession of ancient tribe bloodline, he also had Five Gem Armor to protect his body. It would be a wild wish if Fortress Master Hong Tian burned his soul power with the intention of killing Jian Wushuang.

“Sword Emperor, Fortress Master Hong Tian burned his soul in order to explode such ferocious power, However, he who is a Peak Emperor God, his soul wouldn’t be that strong. The burning of his soul wouldn’t last long. We only have to drag him on for a little longer. By then, we can kill him easily,” Emperor God Liu Guang shared a message.

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang’s gaze fixed upon Fortress Master Hong Tian. He could tell that Fortress Master Hong Tian was totally fighting a desperate fight, like a cornered beast.

“Die!””Die!”

Jian Wushuang and Emperor God Liu Guang charged at him again.

Then, the two of them didn’t fight head-on with Fortress Master Hong Tian but indirectly entangled with Fortress Master Hong Tian.

As for Emperor God Jiu Yin… his power was weak and any single axe hit by Fortress Master Hong Tian then could severely injure him. He didn’t have the guts to bother Fortress Master Hong Tian and he hid far away.

“D*mn. I’m not happy!”

“I will not submit!!!”

Fortress Master Hong Tian roared. With the burning of his soul power, he wanted to hurt Jian Wushuang and Emperor God Liu Guang badly.

However, Emperor God Liu Guang was powerful and her speed was shockingly swift. Fortress Master Hong Tian couldn’t touch her at all.

As for Jian Wushuang, he was fearless. He was totally confident in fighting Fortress Master Hong Tian head-on. Even if he couldn’t match him evenly, it would be impossible for Fortress Master Hong Tian to hurt him.

“Ah!!!!”

Fortress Master Hong Tian roared as his consciousness became blurry.

It was the price to pay for burning his soul.

One should know that soul was an Almighty’s foundation, the core item.

When divine body was damaged, it could be recovered with the aid of treasure. But when the soul was damaged, it would be a few times more difficult to recover.

Fortress Master Hong Tian burned his soul in madness and he couldn’t stop when he ignited the burning. The final outcome would be the complete disappearance of soul. Hence, Fortress Master Hong Tian died.

Although his soul power had yet to burn to the end, his consciousness had dispersed due to too much burning.

Then, Jian Wushuang and Emperor God Liu Guang stopped. They looked at Fortress Master Hong Tian’s aura grew weaker in front of them. Then, in the end…

Psst!

A golden light burst out and Jian Wushuang’s Hong Jun Golden Sword pierced Fortress Master Hong Tian’s head then shattered his divine body.

An overlord, Fortress Master Hong Tian, who had reached the peak of Emperor God level, had died.

When they that saw Fortress Master Hong Tian had finally died, Jian Wushuang and Emperor God Liu Guang both let out a sigh of relief.

“Peak Emperor God is really not that easy to kill,” Jian Wushuang sighed.

Fortress Master Hong Tian among Peak Emperor Gods wasn’t considered the strongest and he was only on the thirty-sixth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. However, he had also brought about trouble for them, especially when Fortress Master Hong Tian had risked his all by burning his soul power. Luckily, Jian Wushuang had Five Gem Armor to protect his body. Otherwise, his counterattack before his death would pay the price.

“Soul Burn, only an expert whose soul strength has reached a certain level could perform. He at least has to be a Peak Emperor God to perform this move. And as Peak Emperor God, only under one circumstance would he perform this move, which was when he knew that he would definitely die. He would risk his life to make a final counterattack in order to try his best to kill his enemy. The moment he uses this move, death is his only outcome,” Emperor God Liu Guang said.

Jian Wushuang nodded in silence.

He also could tell that Fortress Master Hong Tian was already hopeless. He had no choice, that’s why he had performed that move.

“Emperor God Hong Tian was a Peak Emperor God. His soul power has reached the threshold of this move. However, he is too weak after all. Even when he performed this move, he couldn’t bring about damage to us. If it were to be another Peak Emperor God who was stronger, the outcome would be beyond our imagination. Or even if it were to be a Great Emperor who burned his soul in a desperate situation, that would truly be a horror.

Emperor God Liu Guang said and her eyes revealed a tinge of fear subconsciously.
