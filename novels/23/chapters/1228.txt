Chapter 1229: Desperate!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

A grim mood filled the Battle Fortress.

The battle was supposed to pave a way for the Green Fire World’s victory.

Instead, they not only failed to break the Enduring Samsara Formation but also lost the Sunrise Sword Emperor, who was the only Flame Deity Puppet that could hold his own against the Jin Kingdom’s monarch.

Fu Yi had also been felled by the enemy.

Jian Wushuang’s second Original Body was destroyed.

They had lost everything!

“It’s over!”

“The Green Fire World is done!”

“We have no hope, no hope at all.”

Cries echoed through the Battle Fortress.

Desperation reared its ugly head.

Hopelessness clung to every thought.

The morale of the Green Fire World was nonexistent.

If there was even an ounce of hope, the Green Fire World experts would continue to fight, regardless of the price. Even if they failed, it would have been worthwhile.

But there was no more hope!

The Green Fire World had no chance of survival; it was going to be swallowed by the big Formation.

In a magnificent temple, there were about 20 thrones arranged in a circle. Some were occupied, but the others were empty.

All the remaining Green Fire World Palace Masters had gathered, but silence filled the chamber and even Jian Wushuang had nothing to say.

Occasionally, a Palace Master would glance toward the empty throne near the Void Temple Master.

The throne originally belonged to the Sunrise Sword Emperor. But now that he was gone, the throne sat empty.

After nearly an hour, Jian Wushuang finally exclaimed,

“It’s my fault we were defeated!”

Jian Wushuang clenched both of his fists so tightly that his fingertips cut through his palm. He looked grim as he continued, “I underestimated the woman in the Formation. I thought she was just an ordinary Universe Master and that a Universe Master Peak Puppet Fighter was enough to stop her.

“But her clever tricks confused my Puppet Fighter, and she was able to kill the Sunrise Sword Emperor!

“I underestimated her! Everything that happened is my fault!”

Remorse wracked Jian Wushuang’s body.

He led the action to break the Formation, controlled the Flame Deity Puppet, and deployed the Sunrise Sword Emperor and Jian Nantian.

And instead of great victory, they suffered great casualties and lost the Flame Deity Puppet. Jian Wushuang was naturally the one to blame.

Hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, the Samsara Temple Master next him shook his head and said, “We discussed it together, and acted according to the plan. You just carried out the plan. You alone, cannot be blamed for the loss.”

“Yes.”

“If it wasn’t you, someone else would have done the same thing!”

“We can only blame ourselves for underestimating that woman. We thought she only knew about Formations and did not expect her to be that capable.”

The other Palace Masters echoed their agreement.

No one would blame Jian Wushuang.

He merely acted according to the plan and did not foresee the unexpected.

“Shuanger.” Jian Nantian looked at him. “We’re all responsible for this. Don’t blame yourself. Now is not the time to apologize or to point fingers. We need to think about what to do next!”

What to do next?

At the four simple words, the Palace Masters frowned in unison.

Jian Wushuang seemed skeptical as well.

Since the Sunrise Sword Emperor’s death, the Green Fire World didn’t have enough experts to form the Four-point Sword Formation. Even if they did, they needed time to familiarize him with the Formation, and by the time they were prepared, the Four-point Sword Formation would probably still fail to break the spinning vortex.

“Gu King, you’ve followed King Luo Zhen in the Eternal Chaotic World for such a long time; you must have learned a lot of things. Do you have a solution?” asked Jian Wushuang.

Despite his vast knowledge, Gu King also felt hopeless in the face of the crisis.

“I can’t.” Gu King shook his head, dejected.

Jian Wushuang trembled.

All the Palace Masters in the temple forced a smile.

They had relied completely on the Four-point Sword Formation breaking the Formation and considered it their only chance. Where would they find another strategy?

Desperation!

The Palace Masters, including the oldest Samsara Temple Master, the Void Temple Master, the Tang Emperor, The Red Lotus Palace Master, and Palace Master Yun were all distraught.

Suddenly, they all suggested the insane.

“We will fight to the death!”

“Even if the Green Fire World collapses, we’ll give the Jin Kingdom hell!” Palace Master Yun stood up and roared.

“Yes!” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Trapped beasts can still fight, so let’s fight to the end!”

“We’ll take them down with us!”

The Palace Masters shook their fists angrily and madness gleamed in their eyes.

“Are we really a trapped beast?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

Just then… a message came.

“Who is it?” Jian Wushuang was surprised but immediately responded, “Senior Brother, are you looking for me?”

The message was indeed from his Senior Brother Xue Lingtian.

“Junior brother, come out quickly!” Xue Lingtian’s excited voice beckoned.

“What is it?” skepticism filled Jian Wushuang’s voice.

“Our master is coming.” Xue Lingtian answered.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes widened in surprese, and he immediately jumped up.

“Jian Wushuang, has something happened?” The Palace Masters who just decided to sacrifice their lives were confused by his reaction.

“There’s something I have to attend to.” Jian Wushuang answered.

“What’s going on?” Samsara Temple Master was even more puzzled.

“It’s my master, he’s here!” Jian Wushuang answered solemnly.

“Your master?”

The Palace Masters were stunned.

The master who had deciphered the Enduring Samsara Formation and told them how to break it?

The master who even Palace Master Yun admired and respected?

“Your master told you how to break the Formation after receiving your message for help. He must also know that we have failed. If he has come in person, does it mean he has other ideas?” the Samsara Temple Master became hopeful.

The other Samsara Temple Masters looked at each other excitedly.

They had hit a dead end, but with Jian Wushuang’s master’s arrival, hope grew in their hearts once again.

Although the hope was infinitesimal, they would still try to catch it at all costs.

“Perhaps, the Master of Formation really does have other ways to break the Formation!” Palace Master Yun exclaimed.

“Let’s meet him together!”

“Right, we should!”

Following Jian Wushuang, the Palace Masters exited the temple.
