Nine Boundaries Tower, first floor.

Jian Wushuang looked at his opponent, a war puppet that was holding a saber. At the same time, Jian Wushuang could feel his divine power being restrained.

In the Nine Boundaries Tower, he could only rely on the unique skill that he created and a killing technique to win victory. He couldn’t take any other measure.

“To wander the dark void for a thousand and a hundred years. I have been studying my Sword Principle during those times. Now, I can finally test and see how much have I improved. Let’s get started,” Jian Wushuang beamed with joy and he suddenly charged forward.

The war puppet before him took a huge stride forward too. It wielded its saber and let out a comparable divine power to Jian Wushuang’s.

“Advanced rank one unique skill?”

Jian Wushuang lifted his eyebrows then he swung his sword and collapsed the war puppet with one stroke.

Then, Jian Wushuang appeared on the second level.

Nine Boundaries Tower had a total of seventeen floors. As long as he passed through the first ten floors, it was considered a pass.

Nine Boundaries Tower changes according to the level of the cultivator. Jian Wushuang was just a Universe God in the First Heaven, that’s why the war puppet from the first floor only performed an advanced rank one unique skill. However, when he arrived on the second floor, the war puppet used a peak rank one unique skill. But it didn’t affect Jian Wushuang at all.

Jian Wushuang passed through floor by floor rather easily.

Soon, Jian Wushuang passed through the tenth floor, which meat he had passed through the preliminary stage.

On the eleventh floor, it was still the same war puppet but its Sword Technique had leveled up to be an advanced rank two unique skill.

“The Wushuang earlier passed through the eleventh floor. He is also a Universe God in the First Heaven. In other words, he at least created an advanced rank two unique skill. Not too shabby, “Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

Among Universe God in the First Heaven from Snow Kingdom, those who had created an advanced rank two unique skill were only Long Hao from Snow Dojo and Lu Qing from Universe God Palace.

The two of them were the top geniuses acknowledged in Snow Dojo and Universe God Palace.

In East Royal Sanctuary, the top genius in an ordinary town was not weaker than Long Hao nor Lu Qing. He might even be stronger.

Wow!

A cold sword shadow swept past but didn’t leave any traces behind in the void.

Jian Wushuang broke down the war puppet on the eleventh floor directly.

On the twelfth floor, the war puppet still carried out an advanced rank two unique skill but it was considered the stronger kind.

“When one reaches the twelfth floor, he has to create a peak rank two unique skill,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and there was another flash of sword light.

The brutal sword light was unbelievably fast. It hit the war puppet directly.

He passed through the twelfth floor!

On the thirteenth floor, the war puppet was already performing a peak rank two unique skill. However, Jian Wushuang only fought against it for a short while before he felled it again.

On the fourteenth floor!

Wow! Wow! Wow!

The billowing saber light continuously slashed towards Jian Wushuang and he felt a tremendous increase of pressure.

“The fourteenth floor is the real barrier to testify to my improvement within the last thousand years!” Jian Wushuang held his fists as murderous intention filled his eyes.

The very next moment, Jian Wushuang erupted his swordsmanship.

“Dragon Roar!”

Roar!

A terrifying, low bellow swept out along with the soaring sword intention. Jian Wushuang put his Sword Principles that he created all these years to play entirely.

The fight was rather ferocious.

After a fierce battle, the war puppet on the fourteenth floor was defeated by Jian Wushuang.

“Phew!”

Jian Wushuang let out a breath of relief and came to the fifth floor of the Nine Boundaries Tower.

“I already gave my all to go through the fourteenth floor, I performed three peak rank two unique skills that I created. The fifteenth floor was stronger than the fourteenth floor. If I want to pass through it, I have to at least create a rank two strongest unique skill,” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

Rank two strongest unique skill…

As it was a strongest unique skill, it would be very difficult to create.

Back then, Jian Wushuang created a rank one strongest unique skill, Eternal Light. It was created via an enormous amount of accumulation plus a bit of luck.

As he wandered for the past thousand years, his swordsmanship did improve greatly. He even created three different peak rank two unique skills.

However, he had yet to create a rank two strongest unique skill.

He didn’t pass through the fifteenth floor in the end.

After going through Nine Boundaries Tower, Jian Wushuang immediately entered Inadvertent Dreamland.

Inadvertent Dreamland focused on testing one’s consciousness. There was a total of seven floors. He only had to pass through three floors to pass the preliminary stage.

Stepping foot in the first floor of Inadvertent Dreamland, Jian Wushuang wasn’t affected at all.

It was followed by the second, the third, the fourth…. Jian Wushuang passed through the four floors of dreamland rather leisurely. He didn’t feel pressured at all.

“My consciousness strength has reached the level of a Universe God in the Third Heaven. I’m definitely considered a monster among Universe Gods in the First Heaven and my consciousness has already transformed into a Soul Power that has became more firm and tenacious. The test of Inadvertent Dreamland would barely cause any harm to me,” Jian Wushuang shook his head in silence.

After going through the first four levels, he wasn’t affected at all.

Even the following fifth floor, sixth floor and even seventh floor wouldn’t have too huge of an effect.

However, even though he was confident to pass through the seventh floor, Jian Wushuang gave up the following tests after he passed through the fifth floor easily.

After all, his target was originally just Nine Boundaries Tower. It was unnecessary to put up too impressive of a show. The reason why he passed through the fifth floor was that he thought Cheng Wushuang was an eyesore, so he intentionally passed an extra floor than him. Otherwise, according to Jian Wushuang’s character, he would only pass through the third floor, which was sufficient to pass the preliminary threshold.

After going through Nine Boundaries Tower and Inadvertent Dreamland, Jian Wushuang returned to the training field.

The people under the training field looked at him subconsciously and Cheng Wushuang squinted his eyes as he watched him.

On the top of the training field, the Universe God in the Third Heaven who was the host of the preliminary stage received the outcome of Jian Wushuang going through Nine Boundaries Tower and Inadvertent Dreamland revealed a shocking expression.

The Universe God in the Third Heaven then announced the result.

“Jian Wushuang passed through fourteen floors in Nine Boundaries Tower and five floors in Inadvertent Dreamland. He passed the preliminary stage!”

When the Universe God in the Third Heaven announced the result, his voice became rather heated.

After the result was announced, the entire training field was in silence. There was shock in everyone’s eyes.

“How is this possible?”

The scholarly bearing youth, Cheng Wushuang looked at Jian Wushuang in awe. There was a surge of emotions in him.

He only passed through the eleventh floor in Nine Boundaries Tower and he was considered amazing. However, the other Wushuang went all the way to the fourteenth floor?

It was another three floors more than he did!

What’s going on?
