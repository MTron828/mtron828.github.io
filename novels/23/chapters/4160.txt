4161 The Second Level of the Tarot Ruins

“Run! I’m definitely not his match right now!” Jian Wushuang thought quickly. He was never an arrogant person. He did not think that he, who was only a fourth stage great Ruler, could compete with Qing Xuzi.

“Do you think you can escape?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Zi zi zi.

At this moment, a shadow condensed in front of Jian Wushuang. Then, Jian Wushuang saw that Qing Xuzi had already raised the divine sword Jingchan and was about to stab his head!

!!

It was too fast! The sword was so fast that Jian Wushuang couldn’t react in time to defend.

At this critical moment, Jian Wushuang finally used his trump card.

“Innate divine ability, life intimidation!”

In an instant, a Supreme pressure from the level of life descended.

This pressure that came from the difference in life’s natural order disregarded cultivation realms.

Even though Qing Xuzi could now rival a Ninth Kalpa King, he was still affected by the shock of life.

At that moment, it was as if time had frozen. Qing Xuzi’s body, which was charging forward, froze instantly.

Jian Wushuang took the opportunity to retreat. Without any hesitation, he turned around and plunged into the void crack.

Ka ka ka.

The domain of intimidation of life only lasted for less than half a breath’s time before it shattered.

Qing Xuzi’s eyes were cold. He looked at the void crack that Jian Wushuang had entered and said coldly, “Jian Wushuang, do you think I can’t do anything to you just because you escaped into the crack in the void?”

Bang!

Qing Xuzi took a step forward and shot into the crack in the void.

…

Jian Wushuang seemed to have passed through a dark and bottomless tunnel. When his eyes brightened, he was stunned.

A spire-shaped Black Palace appeared in front of him.

On the palace, one large word was carved in a flamboyant manner, ‘Tarot!’

This word seemed to have been drawn with a golden hook and a sharp brush. An extremely overbearing sword intent was emitted!

‘This is…!’ Jian Wushuang’s body trembled and his eyes revealed a look of surprise.

If his guess was correct, this was most likely the second level of the Tarot Ruins that King Zhufeng had mentioned, where the true Tarot treasures were hidden!

Just as Jian Wushuang was about to enter the palace, he suddenly turned his head back as if he had sensed something.

Zi zi zi.

The void twisted, and a white-robed figure fell from the sky.

“Qing Xuzi?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes. This person was really persistent.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ve said it. You can’t escape.” Qing Xuzi sneered.

“Die!” The next moment, when Qing Xuzi was about to use all his divine power to kill Jian Wushuang, his face suddenly turned ugly.

He found that all the divine power in his body seemed to be suppressed by an extremely strong power. He could not use even ten percent of it!

“What’s going on?” Qing Xuzi finally noticed the existence of the palace, and he was stunned.

“Qing Xuzi, if I’m not wrong, this is where the real treasures of the Tarot Ruins are. Why don’t we stop here and look for opportunities here? When we get out of here, we’ll settle our grudges and grievances together. What do you think?” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

“The real treasure of the Tarot Ruins?” Qing Xuzi’s expression changed. After a while, he snorted and said, “Jian Wushuang, I’ll let you live for a while. Then, I’ll take your life.”

In fact, he wanted to kill Jian Wushuang first. However, the problem was that his strength was greatly suppressed once he came here and he could not use ten percent of his strength. Under such circumstances, he could not kill Jian Wushuang at all.

Naturally, he could only stop temporarily.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and no longer said anything. He walked into the Black Palace, step by step.

The palace was huge and had a total of five floors. There was a long winding corridor that kept winding up.

Pa da, pa da.

Pa da, pa da.

The sound of Jian Wushuang’s footsteps reverberated in the quiet Palace, sounding a little dull.

“The universe origin stone! A huge amount of universe origin stones!”

At this moment, Qing Xuzi’s ecstatic voice was heard from the other side of the long corridor.

Jian Wushuang focused his eyes and looked over. In a corner of the first level, countless universe origin stones were piled together, forming ten magnificent mountains!

Each mountain had at least 10 million universe origin stones!

Even Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned red as he looked at the small mountain of ten universe origin stones.

Qing Xuzi immediately grabbed a universe source stone.

Jian Wushuang did not want to be outdone. He stretched out his hand and grabbed another universe origin stone.

Bang!

However, before they could touch the universe origin stone, a light blue halo suddenly spread out from the small mountain of universe origin stones and bounced off Jian Wushuang and Qing Xuzi’s huge hands.

“I can’t take it?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and his eyes flickered.

He pondered for a moment. This palace was filled with the power of restrictions. If he wanted to get the things in this palace, he would probably have to first control this palace and remove the power of the restrictions.

At the thought of this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes revealed a touch of enlightenment. He immediately quickened his pace and walked to a higher place in the palace.

Qing Xuzi, on the other hand, seemed to be in disbelief. He grabbed at the 10 universe source stones crazily, making loud banging sounds.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang shook his head. He did not stop and continued to walk along the winding corridor.

The second level…

The third level…

The fourth level…

Jian Wushuang walked faster and faster. On the second floor, there were a large number of Supreme treasures of principles. On the third floor, there were all kinds of divine herbs. The higher he went, the more items he found on the fourth floor. There was an ancient book floating quietly.

The Tarot sword manual!

A domineering and sharp aura was emitted from the ancient book. Jian Wushuang looked at the ancient book and could not help but feel a sense of worship.

This was the aura left behind by the Supreme Tarot!

After taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang reached out his hand and tried to take the Tarot sword manual.

Bang!

An even stronger restrictive force bounced back.

Jian Wushuang took a few steps back to suppress his boiling blood.

As expected, the items in this palace could only be seen, not taken. If he wanted to truly obtain these treasures, he had to first think of a way to gain control of this Palace.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and continued to walk up.

Half an hour later.

Jian Wushuang walked to the fifth floor.

It was a tightly shut door, and there were two huge statues holding swords standing in front of the door. One of them had a solemn look, while the other had a ferocious look.

Without any hesitation, Jian Wushuang reached out and pushed the door open.

Boom! Boom!

A cloud of dust rose up, and an ancient, foul air rushed out of the door.

The door that had been sealed for hundreds of chaos cycles had been pushed open by Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s expression was solemn. His right hand held the hilt of the Wuqi Divine Sword that was hanging diagonally from his waist and he strode in.
