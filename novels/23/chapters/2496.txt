Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Did you say ‘kill my disciple’?” Strange Old Feng smiled menacingly.

“Master, don’t worry about me, you...” Strange Old Feng’s disciple had just spoken, but his eyes popped out in surprise before he had finished speaking.

A dry old palm had penetrated his body with a terrifying force and completely crushed his internal organs.

The disciple’s expression was one of disbelief as he fell to the ground.

“You actually killed your own disciple?” Jian Wushuang’s face showed consternation.

“Strange Old Feng is cruel and vicious. He has been alone. How could he possibly want a disciple for real? He probably treats his disciple like a toy collected at will,” said Yun Zhen.

Strange Old Feng waved his palm and said with a wicked laugh. “Hehe, Yun Zhen sure knows me best. Now that no one’s in the way, let me see how powerful the most heaven-defying Divine Demon in the history of Wusha Wilderness.”

His body was surging with an aura that only Ultimate God experts could possess while speaking.

His breath of power carried a hint of malice that engulfed the entire place.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed slightly. Just considering the breath of power alone, Strange Old Feng’s aura was stronger than the three Supreme Elders of the Great Compassion Sect but was a far cry from a High-Level Ultimate God such as Yun Zhen.

“He has reached Peak Early-Stage Ultimate God realm.” Jian Wushuang concluded on Strange Old Feng’s strength.

Strange Old Feng made a move.

A blast of cold wind swept across the sky at a terrifying speed.

After Strange Old Feng went at full speed, he did not swoop in the direction where Jian Wushuang was to everyone’s surprise. Instead, he turned and ran away.

“Running away?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold and his figure immediately sprang out to chase after Strange Old Feng.

“Haha, I’m not stupid to contend with both of you at the same time.” There was a peal of loud unbridled laughter from Strange Old Feng.

“This old thing is very cunning.” Yun Zhen’s face sulked as he went after Jian Wushuang to kill Strange Old Feng.

The three of them were extremely fast. Not long after, they were outside the city.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ve dealt with Strange Old Feng before. His current speed is already amazingly fast, but he still has a life-saving secret technique. Once he uses it, his speed will rise to another level which enables him to shake both of us off from pursuing after him,” said Yun Zhen.

“It shouldn’t be easy for him to cast that technique, right?” Jian Wushuang asked in a low voice.

“Well, it’s not easy but if he has no choice, he’ll do it,” said Yun Zhen.

“We shall not give him the chance to perform it then.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold as he chased after Strange Old Feng alongside Yun Zhen. Suddenly, two holograms lurched forward at the same time and Jian Wushuang’s speed increased and surpassed Yun Zhen.

The distance between Jian Wushuang and Strange Old Feng was getting closer.

“Hmm?”

“Is Jian Wushuang that fast?”

Strange Old Feng noticed the movements behind him and was surprised.

“It’s... Space-time Apparition and there are two holograms. No wonder. However, he’s alone so even if he catches up to me, he can’t do anything.”

Strange Old Feng was not bothered.

He was also not in a rush to cast his life-saving secret technique.

The distance between Jian Wushuang and Strange Old Feng was getting closer with Jian Wushuang’s eyes also getting colder.

Finally, Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a severe glare.

“It’s the time!”

Majestic golden divine power condensed abruptly behind Jian Wushuang.

In a blink of an eye, it turned into a huge Golden God Shadow.

The Golden God Shadow was different from the one he cast four months ago.

Four months ago, Jian Wushuang used the Divine God of Punishment secret technique and formed a 900 feet tall Golden God Shadow. For the past four months, Jian Wushuang stayed in Blazing Moon City and worked hard to improve the powers of those secret techniques he had. The Golden God Shadow he formed now had exceeded a thousand feet!

A thousand feet Golden God Shadow!

It represented the second level of the Divine God of Punishment technique and should not be taken lightly!

The current golden shadow compared to four months ago was a whole new level with its power at completely different levels.

Under the amplification of Golden God Shadow, Jian Wushuang’s breath of divine power soared before his big hands shot forward and clapped.

“Prison of Punishment!”

Rumbling...

Golden divine power shot out madly from the Golden God Shadow in all directions as it spread across the entire space and blotted out the Heavens and covered the Sun.

Strange Old Feng was not far in front of Jian Wushuang as he rapidly fled. However, no matter how fast he was, he could not match up to the golden divine power’s speed.

In an instant, the vast golden divine power had surpassed him and condensed into a golden barrier at the void in front of him.

A huge Golden Prison took shape.

Both Jian Wushuang and Strange Old Feng were trapped within the Golden Prison.

“Prison?”

Strange Old Feng was nervous, but soon let out a cold snort. A dark red spear appeared in his hand.

The dark red spear carried an infinite amount of evil spirits. It turned into a swift and violent lighting from being enveloped by the tyrannical divine powers of Strange Old Feng as it thrust fiercely towards the golden barrier.

Bang! There was a loud noise.

A spiral pit the size of a water bucket appeared on the golden barrier, but the spear did not penetrate the golden barrier.

“This prison is so hard?” Strange Old Feng was surprised.

He did not know one of the five most powerful secret techniques of the Seven Stars Black Sects, the Divine God of Punishment was extremely powerful and famous.

Four months ago, Jian Wushuang condensed only a 900 feet high Golden God Shadow and the prison formed was not something an ordinary Ultimate God could break away. Outside Saint’s Tomb, the three Supreme Elders of the Great Compassion Sect were trapped in the Prison of Punishment and Lei Chong had to use the Thunderbolt Bead which he paid a great price to refine just for blasting a hole through the Golden Prison.

The Thunderbolt Bead exploded and the power it emanated alone was equivalent to a High-Level Ultimate God’s power.

When the Golden God Shadow had reached a height of a thousand feet. The Prison of Punishment’s powers had also increased by a huge amount. Even a High-Level Ultimate God as Yun Zhen had to use his strongest move just for attempting his luck to puncture a hole in the Golden Prison.

Strange Old Feng was only at the Peak Early-Stage Ultimate God. It was impossible for him to break the Golden Prison.
