Chapter 849: Lost!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The scarlet sword looked like as endless sea of blood. It was the Blood Mountain Sword.

His current opponent was actually a real expert who has mastered the peak of Step Six, so he did not dare to take him lightly and naturally used his full strength.

Seeing Jian Wushuang fighting Zi Diao, Commander Hong frowned but he did not stop them. The other Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard tacitly left a space for them.

“Die!”

Zi Diao was a hard and cruel man. As he gritted his teeth, his eyes burst out his hidden intent to kill. When he appeared in front of his opponent, Zi Diao swung his saber.

Hiss… The blade light easily tore the void and caused a huge rift of space.

The speed was even more incredible.

Faced with the strike, Jian Wushuang was composed as he moved his wrist to block the blade light with his Blood Mountain Sword.

Clang!

A loud boom was heard. Two powerful strikes crashed head-to-head.

“He actually blocked my attack?” Zi Diao showed a hint of surprise.

His Saber Technique was famous for its speed and fierceness. At that moment, he had used his full strength to unleash the blade light which moved so fast that an ordinary expert at Step Six of the Eternal Realm found it hard to deflect it, but Jian Wushuang had succeeded in blocking it.

Of course, Zi Diao did not take it seriously. With a snort, his fierce Saber Technique broke out directly.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

Streaks of blade light flashed like lightning. It moved so fast that people could not see it clearly.

In a short span of time, Zi Diao launched a frenzied saber attack, unleashing hundreds of fast and violent strikes

Jian Wushuang remained indifferent despite having faced an extremely offensive attack. He?naturally picked up his longsword and defended himself.

Zi Diao attacked furiously and Jian Wushuang defended itself

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

Within a short breath of time, the two guards had already fought hundreds of times. Each time they had caused a huge roar, which shattered the decorations in the palace. Fortunately, this palace was refined by Commander Hong, so they were unable to destroy it.

Amidst high speed collisions, the fierce battle continued.

Zi Diao had already tried his best, but all his attacks were easily resisted by Jian Wushuang.

“Boy, how is this possible?”

Zi Diao shot Jian Wushuang an astonished glance but soon, the rage in his eyes soared.

“Eagle Killing!”

A spiritual force gushed out.

Shua! A blade light suddenly appeared as if an eagle opened its wings and rushed to its prey. It ruthlessly lashed out, leaving a huge crack in the sky.

It was so fast that many of the other Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards in the surrounding area were surprised.

This strike was brilliant.

Seeing this blade light coming over, Jian Wushuang casually loosed his hand. Then his longsword streaked out and collided with the blade light.

Jian Wushuang still parried Zi Diao’s strongest move using his strongest sword with ease.

“It’s impossible!”

Zi Diao was finally shocked, but this shock quickly turned into madness.

“I don’t believe it!”

Zi Diao growled as his eyes became scarlet. He stepped forward and planned to attack again.

But at this time…

Jian Wushuang, who had not taken the initiative to strike a blow, suddenly raised his head to throw his opponent an icy glance.

The next moment, a weird force swept out.

The Ancient God Secret Skill, Magical God!

The Magical God skill that targeted at one’s consciousness.

After it was reinforced by the Divergent Blood Stone, the consciousness attack became more powerful.

This strike, like an immaterial sharp spike, thrust at Zi Diao.

Zi Diao, who still wanted to fight with Jian Wushuang, had not noticed it at all.

Whoosh!

The immaterial sharp spike hit Zi Diao’s consciousness as if someone knocked his head with a huge drumstick. Zi Diao shivered before his eyes immediately became hollow.

His consciousness was caught in chaos that was unprecedented, although it only lasted for a second.

But in such an instant, Jian Wushuang actually attacked.

He waved the longsword to unleash a strike.

Strike with the sword. Keep the sword.

It was done smoothly.

Zi Diao’s head had already been cut off.

His gaze was still empty. When his head landed on the ground, he finally regained his consciousness.

Buzz… A lot of spiritual power gathered wildly and Zi Diao’s body was combined with his head again.

Although Jian Wushuang cleft his head, Zi Diao’s Life Core had not been crushed. As an Eternal Realm expert, Zi Diao would not really die.

Come to this moment, this fierce battle had ended finally.

“How, how is this possible?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Zi Diao widened his eyes and stared at Jian Wushuang while he murmured.

The other Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard all looked at each other with an odd expression.

Zi Diao had obviously looked down on Jian Wushuang and thought that the new Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard was definitely not powerful.

As a result, Jian Wushuang chopped off Zi Diao’s head, which embarrassed the latter.

“Boy, you actually have the skill to directly attack people’s consciousness? You’re sinister.” Zi Diao’s voice echoed in the palace. “I can’t accept it. Without your insidious methods, you should have lost the fight.”

“You can’t accept it?” Jian Wushuang face became frosty.

He had shown his mercy, but Zi Diao remained somewhat unappreciative.

“Enough!”

A shout was heard before the entire hall immediately became quiet.

Zi Diao still wanted to say something and immediately stopped. He turned his head and looked at Commander Hong. “Commander, I am not convinced. Blood Mountain, he just relied on the insidious consciousness attack, but his strength cannot be compared to mine.”

“Oh?”

Commander Hong threw an icy stare at Zi Diao, saying, “If Blood Mountain had used his full strength, do you think that you will still be alive?”
