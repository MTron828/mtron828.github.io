Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Emperor Golden Snake!”

Fang Han’s words caused a stir on the battlefield. Everyone could not help looking at Jian Wushuang.

“Brother Wushuang,” Qing Huo looked at Jian Wushuang with concern.

They had clearly heard Jin Ling’s message before he died, so they knew why Emperor Golden Snake was here.

“Is he coming?”

Contrary to these sergeants, Jian Wushuang remained calm.

Whoosh!

Emperor Golden Snake was as fast as lightning. He appeared in the air above the battlefield in a moment, overlooking them with his scarlet-colored eyes.

Numerous bodies lay on the ground. Most were Demonic Beasts, but there were also many human bodies.

Emperor Golden Snake quickly discovered Jin Ling’s body, which was under a dead Demonic Beast.

He vanished and reappeared beside Jin Ling. With a wave of his hand, he crushed the Demonic Beast’s body into pieces. Then he bent down to lift Jin Ling’s body slowly.

“Ling’er!”

Emperor Golden Snake’s voice was cold, but his body was trembling slightly.

The sergeants frowned as they looked on.

In their opinion, Jin Ling deserved his death. However, they could understand Emperor Golden Snake’s pain as a father.

“Emperor Golden Snake,” Fang Han walked towards Emperor Golden Snake, trying to say something.

“Get out of my way!” Emperor Golden Snake yelled. His mighty killing intent swept over the area in an instant.

Fang Han, who had already been seriously injured, lost his balance and stepped backward as a mouthful of blood gushed from him.

Boom... The killing intent spread around Emperor Golden Snake like a tide.

With a wave of his hand, Emperor Golden Snake stored Jin Ling’s body in his Interspatial Ring.

He slowly stood up. His mighty and formidable killing intent soared again and was surged out like a landslide or a tsunami.

The entire area became still and the air started to freeze.

His eyes were full of overwhelming killing intent as he looked at the sergeants around him.

“Who is Jian Wushuang?” Emperor Golden Snake asked, word by word, in a freezing cold tone.

Being oppressed by his mighty killing intent, the sergeants could not help trembling. They looked at Jian Wushuang unconsciously.

Emperor Golden Snake turned to look at Jian Wushuang.

“Is it you?” Emperor Golden Snake stared at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang knew that he could not hide, and he did not want to either. He took a deep breath and stepped forward.

“I’m Jian Wushuang. May I ask what you want, Emperor Golden Snake?” Jian Wushuang, with the Triple-kill Sword sheathed on his back, stood straight like a vigorous pine and looked straight at Emperor Golden Snake without any fear.

The sergeants were full of respect towards him as they watched this scene.

In the face of a Divine Emperor who might kill him at any time, Jian Wushuang still remained calm. His boldness impressed the sergeants, as well as Fang Han.

“Ling’er died,” Emperor Golden Snake stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang slightly nodded. He did not dodge Emperor Golden Snake’s stare. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“He died. So why are you still alive?” Emperor Golden Snake said coldly as a freezing killing intent flashed in his eyes.

“Go to accompany Ling’er!”

As soon as he finished his words, he started to attack.

He turned his palm upside down, releasing a vast power.

A huge palm, which was big enough to cover the sky, instantly solidified in the air. Its power was so vast that all the sergeants in the area were stunned.

The palm quickly slapped toward Jian Wushuang at lightning speed.

“So arrogant!”

Jian Wushuang stood there coldly. The Triple-kill Sword behind him had already been drawn out and was stabbing towards the giant palm.

Chi!

The sharp sword shadow pierced the palm and began to twist violently. The palm was directly penetrated and dissipated in the air.

Considering Jian Wushuang’s strength, it was impossible for Emperor Golden Snake to kill him with a casual move.

Nevertheless, when the palm was crushed, Emperor Golden Snake also disappeared.

“Who did you say was arrogant?”

A voice without any emotion suddenly sounded from behind Jian Wushuang. Emperor Golden Snake stood behind him, less than three meters away.

“So fast,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed. He sensed that a freezing light was chopping toward his head.

It was a black scimitar. It was extremely fast and it was already so close to him, so it was too late for Jian Wushuang to turn around and resist it.

Buzz... A mighty killing intent surged out from Jian Wushuang and a vast blood river immediately spread out over the area.

The blood river, which superimposed with the Thousandfold Realm to form a Realm, oppressed Emperor Golden Snake, making him halt for a moment. The black scimitar also became slightly slower.

Jian Wushuang seized the opportunity and dodged.

Swoosh!

The freezing black light whizzed pass Jian Wushuang’s ear, making a shrill boom as it glided through the air.

“So close!”

The sergeants could not help exclaiming as they saw this breathtaking scene.

“Not bad,” Emperor Golden Snake was also surprised.

“Hum!” Jian Wushuang snorted. Behind him, the 60-meter-high Golden Sword Soul Phantom appeared once again.

Along with it came the matchless Supreme Sword Essence.

Jian Wushuang’s turbulent power burst forth and the eight Origin Marks on his arms also exploded, releasing power to their absolute limit.

Then, he swung his longsword.

The Golden Sword Soul Phantom behind him swung its longsword simultaneously.

In an instant, the sky darkened.

A bright and dazzling sword shadow emerged.

This sword shadow silently glided through the space between them.

However, it carried a terrible force with it that seemed as if it could exterminate everything.

It was the fourth move of Heart-killing Sword Technique, Sheer Shadow!

Through Jian Wushuang’s all-out exertion, the power of the sword had reached an earth-shaking level.

The bright but silent sword shadow immediately chopped toward Emperor Golden Snake.
