Chapter 2782: Fierce Battle!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Heavenly Modest Palace was completely different from the top forces in Danyang Continent.

They were a big power that truly controlled a domain and an Undying Saint was in charge.

Crimson Stone Fort who lost an Undying Saint was coveted by the Heavenly Modest Palace. That was not a good thing.

“You’re Yin Su’er, right?”

The black-robed old man, Chen Kong, looked at Yin Su’er. “I know you, you’re Crimson Stone Saint’s daughter. The Palace Master said that for the sake of Crimson Stone Saint, he wouldn’t be too mean to you. As long as you are willing to completely surrender to him, you can stay in the Crimson Stone Fort in the future, but if you are stubborn, then don’t blame him for being cruel.”

Yin Su’er’s eyes narrowed when she heard the threatening message.

Before Yin Su’er could say anything, Jian Wushuang who stood next to her spoke, “Your Palace Master sounds boastful to me. He made it sound like Crimson Stone Fort is already under his control and he can destroy it any time he wishes to. If it’s that simple, I’m afraid he’s here in person now, no?”

Chen Kong’s expression changed a little.

Indeed, because of some reasons, the Palace Master did not make the trip himself. Instead, he sent his twelve men.

If the Palace Master was around, the dignified Undying Saint could easily wipe out the entire Danyang Holy Domain and all the many forces in Danyang Holy Domain would ,no doubt, surrender to him.

Jian Wushuang also noticed the change in Chen Kong’s expression, he knew his guessing was correct. He smiled and said, “Since your Palace Master can’t make it here in person, don’t you think you sound way too arrogant to say what you said to the Fort Master?

Chen Kong’s eyes immediately turned cold. “Su Han from Sword Alliance... Before this, I thought you were from the Outer Realm like myself. I thought you probably also have the backing from an Undying Saint and a powerful force. At that time, I was rather cautious of you, but now, I’m sure that you have no background and your strength is only at the level of a High-level Grand Ultimate God. How dare a person like you speak to me like this! Do you have a death wish?”

When the word “death” was spoken, Chen Kong made a move already.

A tyrannical gush of Peak Grand Ultimate God’s aura swept across instantly.

Chen Kong was extremely fast. He moved like a black phantom, instantly appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

The moment Chen Kong left his spot, Jian Wushuang had already noticed it. Jian Wushuang remained in place but he had applied the four domain oppression methods on Chen Kong.

All the four domain oppression methods that were previously used to suppress the entire battlefield were then only on Chen Kong.

Under the huge pressure from Jian Wushuang, Chen Kong’s formidable strength was instantly suppressed by about 20 percent.

“These domain oppression methods are indeed good, but unfortunately, they are useless.”

Chen Kong’s cold voice came and his palm raised, the tip of his index finger gathered his majestic divine power and then he sent a shooting dark beam of light at Jian Wushuang’s head like a meteor.

When the dark beam of light was about to hit Jian Wushuang’s head, a golden light appeared out of nowhere and placed itself in front of Jian Wushuang.

This golden light was the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet controlled by Jian Wushuang.

The golden armor corpse puppet obeyed Jian Wushuang’s command. It stood in front of Jian Wushuang and then swung the big saber fiercely in his hand.

A mighty, magnificent saber, slashed toward the dark beam of light.

Bang!

A low crashing sound was produced and the dark beam soon collapsed and dissipated.

The Gold-armored Corpse Puppet received a great impact, its figure shot backward like a cannonball, retreated a long distance before it finally stopped in place.

” Chen Kong is powerful indeed. He’s only displaying 80 percent of his strength under my domain oppression. He still managed to resist the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet with only one finger. He’s a Peak Grand Ultimate God and his combat power is much stronger than Dong Shen from the Divine Demon Sect.

Chen Kong was a little surprised to see that he had just resisted an attack from a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet.

Yin Su’er, who was next to the void, made a command.

“Attack!”

Followed by the stern command, the Grand Ultimate Gods under Yin Su’er’s command fiercely attacked the opponents.

Several Sword Alliance Grand Ultimate Gods, including those corpse puppets, were attacking the opponents as well.

Jian Wushuang retreated. On his way back, he displayed the vast power of his various domain oppression methods once again, targeting to suppress the opponents on the battlefield.

The many Grand Ultimate Gods from Blood Thunder King’s faction, including the twelve Grand Ultimate Gods of Heavenly Modest Palace felt suppressed.

“Kill them!” Chen Kong yelled. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Many of the Grand Ultimate Gods from Heavenly Modest Palace, as well as the Blood Thunder King and the others made a move instantly.

Heavenly Modest Palace coupled with Blood Thunder King’s faction had a total of more than 20 Grand Ultimate Gods. Besides that, most of them were High-level Grand Ultimate Gods.

Yin Su’er and Jian Wushuang joined forces. In terms of the number of Grand Ultimate Gods, they were better off than their opponents. However, they fell short in terms of quality.

After all, most of the Grand Ultimate Gods under Yin Su’er’s command were just Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods.

However, Jian Wushuang’s domain oppression methods had managed to suppress the strength of many Grand Ultimate Gods from the Heavenly Modest Palace and Blood Thunder King’s faction by a lot. Those High-level Grand Ultimate Gods found their strength lowered and therefore, both sides were about the same in terms of the overall combat power.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

A series of violent attacking sounds resounded.

This battle between the two sides was obviously much more intense than the previous battle between Yin Su’er and Yun Shan. The combat level was also much higher.

The key was that both sides in the battle each have the combat power of two Peak Grand Ultimate Gods.

Yin Su’er faced Chen Kong, and the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet confronted the other Peak Grand Ultimate Gods from Heavenly Modest Palace.

The battle was fierce and tough.

Jian Wushuang retreated to the edge of the battlefield as soon as the battle began. He did not fire any attacking shots, but only used his four domain oppression methods on the opponents.

He could see clearly the situation on the battlefield from where he was.

“Although Heavenly Modest Palace has sent twelve Grand Ultimate Gods here and all of the twelve Grand Ultimate Gods are powerful. Of the ten High-level Grand Ultimate Gods, six are ranked at the top, and the other four are at the top. They are definitely not weak among the High-level Grand Ultimate Gods, and the two Peak Grand Ultimate Gods are also very powerful.” Jian Wushuang

Even though there was a gap in the number of Grand Ultimate Gods between the two sides, his domain oppression methods proved helpful. They fought fiercely, yet his camp did not gain any advantage. The two sides were equal. The Heavenly Modest Palace side barely had the upper hand in the battle.
