Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Leng Rushuang looked down from above. Her jade-like hand waved the light purple long whip, and she swept out like a swimming dragon.

In an instant, a violent power filled the air.

Standing below, Leng Rushuang felt that she had instantly fallen into an extremely violent ocean.

The waves in the sky rolled up crazily, forming a series of tsunamis that rushed toward Leng Rushuang.

“This move…” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Jian Wushuang, who had already appeared at the edge of the battlefield, could not help smiling when he saw Leng Rushuang’s whip skill.

This whip skill was taught to Leng Rushuang by supreme fog. The whip skill was created by supreme fog, so Leng Rushuang was only using the first move.

However, even the first move was extremely powerful, especially the violent and endless essence realm. It was not inferior to Jian Wushuang’s wave light sword formation and was even stronger in some aspects.

When Leng Rushuang first used this whip skill, Jian Wushuang was already amazed. At that time, Leng Rushuang had only Rulered less than 10% of this whip skill, but now, after so many years…the power of this skill could be perfectly displayed by Leng Rushuang.

The extremely violent waves crazily attacked Leng Ruxue. Leng Ruxue also continuously used her spear skills in an attempt to break free from the violent waves. However, the waves used the force to deflect the force, leaving Leng Ruxue helpless.

“What the hell is this skill?” Leng Ruxue’s face was a bit unsightly. In this vast ocean, she was really too passive.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

The violent waves continued to attack. It was fine for a while, but after a short while, Leng Ruxue could not hold on any longer.

“Humph, I won’t waste any more time with you.” Leng Ruxue snorted. In an instant, her pair of pitch-black eyes turned grayish-white.

Her grayish-white eyes were extremely strange.

Seeing these eyes, Jian Wushuang, who was outside the battlefield, instantly understood that Leng Ruxue was going to use her special physique.

He had fought with Leng Ruxue in the Eternal Chaotic World, and her eyes were grayish-white.

Buzz!

Suddenly, a dazzling golden light lit up in her grayish-white eyes. Then, a large amount of scarlet-golden flames spread crazily in the surroundings at a terrifying speed. In the blink of an eye, the entire battlefield fell into a sea of golden flames.

Not only that, there was also a large amount of hazy golden fog rising from the golden sea of flames.

“The golden fog and the golden sea of flames are not real flames, but…poisonous fog!” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

He could tell at a glance that the overwhelming golden sea of flames was actually formed by poisonous fog. Now, Leng Rushuang had completely fallen into the golden sea of flames.

The endless golden mist, including the sea of golden flames, completely covered Leng Rushuang.

“Is this the woeful poison body?” Leng Rushuang could see the real situation of the surrounding sea of flames.

The golden flames in the sky seemed to want to vaporize her entire divine body. and the rising golden mist was everywhere, trying to invade her divine body.

She could only urge her divine power and set up a simple defense to resist the erosion of the mist. However, the erosion of the mist was far beyond her expectation. Although she could resist it…the consumption of her divine power was huge and fast.

After the golden sea of flames swept over, Leng Rushuang could clearly sense that the aura from Leng Ruxue’s body had soared to a whole new level. After she urged her special constitution…her strength had already far surpassed what she had just experienced.

Other than that, behind Leng Ruxue, an enormous phantom of a strange beast had unexpectedly condensed. The body of that strange beast was not very big, but the key point was that the two pairs of enormous wings around its body…occupied a large amount of space, making it seem like a flying butterfly.

“The Ten Thousand Poison Scripture!”

“It’s the Ten Thousand Poison Scripture of the Universal Poison Demon Sect. This witch has indeed refined it. Moreover, her life-bound phantom beast is actually this kind of multicolored poisonous butterfly?”

A wave of exclamations sounded from the surrounding martial arts practice grounds.

The Ten Thousand Poison Scripture was not only extremely famous in the Thunder Star World, but also in the entire Purple Micro Galaxy. This secret technique was also extremely powerful.

At the same time, Leng Ruxue, who had activated her body of woeful poison and used the Ten Thousand Poison Scripture, had already reached a new level of strength at this moment.

“The golden sea of fire around me is too strong. I don’t have a perfect life-form like the soldiers. My divine power is boundless. With my divine power, I can only last for a few dozen breaths before my divine power is completely exhausted. If that’s the case, I’ll go all out and defeat her within these dozens of breaths.” Leng Rushuang instantly made up her mind.

Boom!

A terrifying aura suddenly rose from Leng Rushuang’s body, and a large amount of white light suddenly appeared behind her. The white light shone like the surrounding sky, making her look extremely holy at this moment, she was like a goddess from the nine heavens.

Her hair and robes were all blown up at this moment, and even her eyes were suffused with a faint white light.

“Shuang ‘er must have used her trump card.” Jian Wushuang looked at the scene with a solemn expression.

She had even received the true inheritance from supreme fog, who had not only taught her the whip skill, but also taught her some powerful secret skills and life-saving methods.

However, usually, Leng Rushuang would not use those methods, and this was the first time Jian Wushuang had seen Leng Rushuang use them.

The white light behind Leng Rushuang became more and more dazzling, and her aura became more and more powerful. When her aura reached a peak, whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Leng Rushuang’s figure was strangely divided into three!

Yes, she went from one person to three people. It was not an illusion or an illusion, but a real body.

The three Leng Rushuang each held a long whip in their hands. Except for Leng Rushuang, who was in the middle, who was holding a principle treasure, the other two were only holding supreme true treasures.

Sou!

The three Leng Rushuang attacked at the same time, and their speed reached its peak.

Three powerful whip shadows descended at the same time. Each whip shadow was much stronger than Leng Rushuang’s previous one, but there were three of them.

“What secret technique is this?”

“One person turned into three?”

“I can see that they are not phantoms, but real divine bodies. Is it a clone secret technique?”

“But even if it’s a clone secret technique, there must be a difference in strength. But these three human shadows, except for the supreme treasures in their hands, are all the same?”

The martial arts practice field was full of exclamations.
