Chapter 3785: Patriarch Red Cloud

“Little guy, I’ve told you so much, but you probably don’t even know who the master is.” Lord Wu stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Listen, master, his real name is host. Of course, almost no one in the universe knows this name. Most people only know the title of master, Patriarch Red Cloud.” Lord Wu’s face was filled with respect and admiration. “Master is a supreme expert, and a very powerful one at that. He personally founded the Red Cloud Branch and even opened a Divine Kingdom.”

“Is he really a supreme expert?” Jian Wushuang was not surprised.

As for opening a Divine Kingdom? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang had never been to the depths of the universe. He did not know what a Divine Kingdom was, but judging from what Lord Wu said, opening a Divine Kingdom should be a great thing.

“How strong is an extremely strong Supreme Being?” Jian Wushuang could not help but ask.

“Very strong. Among the Supreme Beings, master is considered to be at the top level, enough to dominate the universe. However, there were too many top experts who participated in that battle. There were many who were stronger than master, such as Supreme Being Ling Yun, Jade Throat King, and the Hundred-Battle Demon Ancestor, who were all super experts who were above master. Master died at the hands of the Hundred-Battle Demon Ancestor, and even the Divine Kingdom was completely destroyed. Sigh!” Lord Wu could not help sighing.

Upon hearing Lord Wu’s words, Jian Wushuang immediately had many thoughts.

Supreme Ling Yun, Jade Throat King, and the Hundred-Battle Demon Ancestor?

He might not know about Jade Throat King and the Hundred-Battle Demon Ancestor, but he knew about Supreme Ling Yun.

After all, he was now a disciple of the Ling Yun Star lineage.

“According to Lord Wu, many years ago, an extremely fierce battle broke out in the depths of the universe. Even supreme experts died in that battle. Supreme Ling Yun and Patriarch Red Cloud participated in that battle, and Patriarch Red Cloud died in that battle. As for Supreme Ling Yun, perhaps he was severely injured in that battle, which led to the disaster of the Ling Yun Star lineage,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

......

At the same time, he finally understood why there were three battlefields in this Star Field.

According to his estimation, it was very likely that the battle back then was too earth-shattering, causing many Divine Kingdoms to collapse. One of the Divine Kingdoms was swallowed by the broken cosmic turbulence and drifted into this Star Field. As for the Red Cloud World…the Secret Realm where Ling Yun Star was located was probably also a floating one.

“When master was alive, his strength was monstrous. He founded the Red Cloud lineage and had a complete disciple training system. This Red Cloud World was specially selected for master to choose suitable disciples. Back then, in the vast universe, who knows how many genius disciples came to the Red Cloud World, hoping to pass the test of the Red Cloud World and become a disciple of the Red Cloud lineage.”

“Even if it’s just an outer sect disciple, it’s enough for countless geniuses to go crazy fighting over it. At that time, our Red Cloud World would occasionally select outer sect disciples or even inner sect disciples for master. However, ever since that battle, the Red Cloud World has drifted here. Although I have always followed my duty and been selecting disciples for the Red Cloud World, up until now, the only person who has successfully passed the trial of Heaven-Treading Mountain is you!

“Little guy, you’re the first person to pass the trial of Heaven-Treading Mountain after master died. Although you won’t be treated as an outer disciple of the Red Cloud Branch, I won’t give you any less benefits in the Red Cloud World.”

As Lord Wu spoke, he waved his hand, and immediately, token after token appeared and floated in front of Jian Wushuang. There were 36 tokens.

“According to the rules set by master, whoever passes the trial of Heaven-Treading Mountain and comes to the Second Heaven can not only enjoy the great opportunities in the Second Heaven, but also choose one of the 36 secret skills to cultivate. Little Guy, you can choose one of these 36 tokens,” Lord Wu said.

Looking at the 36 tokens floating in front of him, it was obvious that each of them contained a secret skill.

This secret skill came from the Red Cloud Branch. Since Patriarch Red Cloud was so powerful, any one of the 36 secret skills must be extraordinary.

However, Jian Wushuang was not happy.

“Lord Wu, is this the reward for passing the trial of Heaven-Treading Mountain?” Jian Wushuang asked with a frown.

“Why? Are you still not satisfied?” Lord Wu immediately glared at him. “Boy, I’m afraid you don’t know that each of the 36 secret skills is an extremely precious treasure of the Red Cloud Branch. Some were created by the master himself, while others were plundered by other supreme experts. Each of these secret skills is enough to cause countless Rulers to fight for it. Even some weaker supreme experts would covet them. How could you not be satisfied?”

“No, no.” Jian Wushuang shook his head repeatedly. “That’s not what I meant, nor do I dislike the 36 secret skills. However, I came to Heaven-Treading Mountain because I Need a special treasure, which may be found in the Red Cloud World.”

“Oh, what treasure?” Lord Wu looked over.

“The iceheart glazed jade, a special treasure that can help people shape their glazed bodies,” Jian Wushuang said solemnly.

He really desired the iceheart glazed jade, which was a precious treasure for his wife to rebuild her divine body.

He had been so eager for the Red Cloud World not only because of the opportunities in the Red Cloud World, but also because there were countless treasures in the Red Cloud World, most likely including the iceheart glazed jade, that was why he had desperately wanted to pass the Heaven-Treading Mountain’s test.

He had thought that he would have a chance to get the iceheart glazed jades after passing the Heaven-Treading Mountain’s test, but he had not expected that the reward after passing the Heaven-Treading Mountain was only one of the thirty-six secret techniques.

Indeed, these thirty-six secret techniques were very powerful, and any one of them was far more valuable than the iceheart glazed jades. However, he had longed for the iceheart glazed jades even more.

“Iceheart glazed jade?” Lord Wu frowned slightly and said, “There is no such thing in the Red Cloud World.”

“What?” Jian Wushuang’s face changed immediately.

“No? The Red Cloud World has endless Supreme Treasures and countless opportunities and treasures. How can there be no iceheart glazed jade?” Jian Wushuang could not believe it.

“I am in charge of everything in the Red Cloud World. I can tell you with certainty that although there are many treasures left by master in the Red Cloud World, including all kinds of genius and earthly treasures, the iceheart glazed jade you mentioned is not among them.” Lord Wu was very sure.
