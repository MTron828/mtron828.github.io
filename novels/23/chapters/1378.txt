Chapter 1379: Xue Feng’s Team Got Into Trouble

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Hello, Soul Master.” The girl in black greeted Jian Wushuang with respect.

“This is my younger sister Xue Tong, also a Soul Master. Now she has the ability to be a level-one Soul Master, although she hasn’t been approved by the Soul Master Sect.” Xue Feng said by way of introduction.

Jian Wushuang looked at the girl and didn’t reply.

“Are you going back into the town, Master?” Xue Feng asked.

Jian Wushuang nodded.

“So are we. How about going together?”

Jian Wushuang couldn’t feel any kind of enthusiasm in the eyes of Xue Feng and Xue Tong.

Jian Wushuang knew why.

“They want me to teach Xue Tong soul power skills.” Jian Wushuang thought.

After all, the number of level-two Peak Soul Masters was limited in the whole Tian Ling Mystery Land. It was a valuable opportunity to learn from them.

“OK.”

Jian Wushuang accepted the invitation.

After all, he needed to learn more about the Tian Ling Mystery Land from Xue Feng.

So they set out.

Xue Tong sought any opportunity to ask Jian Wushuang about consciousness control.

When she found Jian Wushuang was patient and kind, she felt freer and asked questions more frequently.

But Jian Wushuang had mixed feelings.

What he could teach Xue Tong was only from Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack

He knew the theory but didn’t know how to exercise.

What’s more, Xue Yang was, in fact, even better at consciousness control than him.

Actually I should learn from Xue Tong, because Soul Masters like her learn from childhood. My advantage is just having the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack.

And in this process, the skills that Xue Tong had shown him had also benefited Jian Wushuang a lot.

Five days passed.

“Master Wushuang, we will be arriving at the town in one day.”

Jian Wushuang nodded.

He had told them his name.

But as Xue Feng was talking… something happened.

Jian Wushuang felt alarmed.

“What happened, Brother Wushuang?” Xue Tong asked.

“Some people were approaching us.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Are they also exploring the forest?”

“Not exactly, they are not coming for beasts.”

And that group of people soon appeared in front of them. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

They wore black robes and scary black masks, full of aggression.

Xue Feng was nervous, “They are from the Hungry Wolves Clan.”

Others were also frightened.

“Hungry Wolves Clan?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“They are a burglar clan killing cultivators. Over the past few hundred years, numerous people have died because of them!”

Now Xue Feng’s group was in great trouble.

They were not powerful enough to contain the clan.

“Sister, leave with Brother Wushuang. I will fight with them and buy you more time.” Xue Feng told Xue Tong.”

Xue Tong felt unwilling to leave Xue Feng alone.

As for the clan, among whom there was a man who wore a golden mask, they stood there looking at Xue Feng’s group.

“Have you investigated their levels, Mei Er?” The man in a golden mask asked.

“Nine people in total. Three level-two Divine Generals and another five are level-one. And the last one is not even a Divine General but it seems that she is a Soul Master. Her consciousness is not bad.” Mei Er said.

Obviously, the ranking setting in the Tian Ling Mystery Land was different from the Eternal Chaotic World.

There were Divine Soldiers, Divine Generals and Real Gods

But the ranking was similar. For example, level-one Divine Generals were equal to Universe Gods in the First Heaven.

As for Soul Masters, a level-one Soul Master had a consciousness as strong as a Universe Gods in the First Heaven’s.

“How weak they are.” The man in a golden mask grinned, “Kill them.”

So his subordinates started the attack.

Seeing this, Xue Feng and other members were scared to death.

“Leave here!”

Xue Feng shouted and asked his teammates to leave. He rushed to the clan alone.

“But he was just a level-two Divine General, much weaker than those level-two Peak Divine Generals in front of them, let alone the level-three Divine General in the golden mask.”

Xue Feng had little hope of being able to stop them.

“Xue Feng is in danger.”

Jian Wushuang frowned. Then he generated his unimaginable Soul Power.

The power transformed into a scarlet phoenix.

The giant phoenix rushed at the clan.
