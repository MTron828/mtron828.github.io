Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang had not encountered any enemies on his way to the Holy Place.

He immediately went to meet Temple Master Black Spirit after he arrived there.

In a grand palace, which was located in the highest position among many lines of palaces, a beautiful blue-haired lady in a blue robe sat on the throne.

She seemed as mysterious as the ocean. Filled with a faint blue light that contained some special magic, her eyes looked terrifying.

Temple Master Black Spirit was known as the topmost master among the 33 Temple Masters.

She was the most powerful, and therefore, had the highest status.

As for the other Temple Masters, some stayed in campsites; some were in closed-door meditation; and some traveled around, even going to the other plane worlds. Only Temple Master Black Spirit had guarded the Holy Place for a long period of time.

Even though she rarely made an appearance, no one was able to surpass her fame.

Although Temple Master Iceberg had a high status in the Monster-exterminating League, he was still inferior to Temple Master Black Spirit.

“Temple Master Black Spirit.”

Jian Wushuang stood in front of her with a hint of respect.

“Jian Wushuang.” Temple Master Black Spirit looked down with her magic eyes. “Do you know why I want to meet you?”

“No,” Jian Wushuang replied, shaking his head. He really did not know why she had summoned him. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Temple Master Black Spirit spoke with an indifferent look. “Do you know a man called Jian Chen?”

“Jian Chen?” Jian Wushuang was stunned for a second and then shook his head.

“You don’t know him?” Temple Master Black Spirit murmured, “If not, then why do you have his sword and how do you know how to perform the Sword Skill that he created?”

“I have his sword?” Jian Wushuang was surprised but he immediately understood. “Are you talking about the Sword Ancestor?”

Actually, he did not know the Sword Ancestor’s real name.

The Sword Ancestor had always only called himself that, so no one knew what his real name was.

“Sword Ancestor? I don’t know whether he is the Sword Ancestor or not. I just know that his name is Jian Chen, and the powerful Sword of Killing in your hand is his weapon. He created the swordsmanship you used when fighting Emperor Golden Snake. It’s called the Heart-killing Sword Technique, right?” Temple Master Black Spirit asked.

Jian Wushuang replied, “Right. Since my Heart-killing Sword and Heart-killing Sword Technique come from the Sword Ancestor, he must be the Jian Chen that you mentioned.”

“So you know him?” Temple Master Black Spirit asked while looking at Jian Wushuang.

“Yep, I not only know him but actually, the Sword Ancestor, Jian Chen, is my ancestor. He created the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor and I’m descended from him,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Oh?” Temple Master Black Spirit nodded and asked with some expectation, “How is he doing?”

“This...” Jian Wushuang glanced at Temple Master Black Spirit in astonishment. He knew that she had special feelings when she was talking about the Sword Ancestor. He guessed that it was about love, even though he had never had such feelings.

“Temple Master Black Spirit and Sword Ancestor were...?”?Jian Wushuang sighed inwardly.

Then he responded honestly, “Temple Master, the Sword Ancestor died thousands of years ago!”

“Died? As I expected!” Temple Master Black Spirit sighed. She was somewhat disappointed even though she had already guessed the result.

“Thousands of years ago, he said he would come back to find me, but he never returned. I guessed that he might have been killed. It’s a pity that I was unable to leave the Monster Continent to look for him because of my duty...” Temple Master Black Spirit mumbled with a complicated expression, but she quickly calmed down.

She then looked over at Jian Wushuang and said, “Two months ago, I saw you fighting with Emperor Golden Snake in the dark.”

“Hmm?” Jian Wushuang did not expect that Temple Master Black Spirit had been watching that Life-death Duel.

“The moment that I saw you holding the Heart-killing Sword and perform the Heart-killing Sword Technique, I knew that you had some relationship with Jian Chen, so I paid more attention to you. When I received the news that you encountered monster spies, I immediately went to save you. And fortunately, I arrived in time,” Temple Master Black Spirit said.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He had been wondering why Temple Master Black Spirit, who rarely left the Holy Place, had come to save him.

Now, he finally knew that he had received her special consideration because of the Sword Ancestor.

“Speaking of this assassination, I don’t know why those monster spies spared no effort to try and kill you.” Temple Master Black Spirit looked at the young man while speaking.

“I don’t know, either.” Jian Wushuang shook his head. “As an outsider, I do have some talents, but I don’t deserve to be hunted like this. Moreover, we haven’t had any conflicts, so the only possibility is that I have something they want.”

“Something they want?”

Jian Wushuang immediately thought of the compass.

The compass had to be precious because Temple Master Iceberg had tried his best to defeat him.

“If I’m right, what the Demonic Beasts wanted must have been the compass,” Jian Wushuang said.

“What compass?” Temple Master Black Spirit asked.

Jian Wushuang showed her the compass without hesitation.

He was not worried that the beautiful lady would grab it. She had already saved him, so even if she asked him to give her the compass, he would not refuse.

Jian Wushuang handed the compass to the beautiful lady and said, “Temple Master Black Spirit, this is the compass.”

She took it from him and looked it over.

She frowned slightly because she was unable to see any difference between this compass and others.

Temple Master Black Spirit asked, “Jian Wushuang, you said that those monster spies came for this? What secret does this compass have?”

“I’m not clear about it.” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

“But I know that Temple Master Iceberg greatly values it and desperately wants to get it. He had intended to kill me in Blood Moon Plain, but he changed his mind to deal with those monster spies because he saw that you were there.”
