4135 The Fourth-Level Ruler

“I just killed you twice. Every time you die, the principles of Heaven and earth and the principles of the universe in the Enlightenment River become stronger. In other words, if I can kill you a few more times, won’t I get more benefits from the Enlightenment River?” Jian Wushuang stared at River Spirit with evil intentions.

River Spirit glared, but Jian Wushuang had already made his move.

“Come here, Heaven Suppression Tablet!” Jian Wushuang laughed. A towering Heaven Suppression Tablet instantly descended and pressed River Spirit under the tablet.

Accompanied by River Spirit’s miserable cry, Jian Wushuang began his thousands of years of seclusion.

...

Spring passed, autumn came, and thousands of years passed.

In the blink of an eye, 3,000 years had passed.

During these 3,000 years, in this vast universe, every day, there would be experts falling, and new stars would be born. The cycle was endless.

To the universe, 3,000 years passed in the blink of an eye. The Life Palace was also peaceful.

In the third mountain range.

A calm, pitch-black river was originally flowing slowly.

Suddenly, the surface of the river began to boil, rumble.

The bubbles burst one by one. In just a few breaths, the surface of the river began to tremble violently like boiling water!

In the next moment.

Swish!

With a long cry, a black-clothed figure broke out of the bottom of the river in an instant.

Jian Wushuang took a step down and stood at the riverside of the Enlightenment River.

His eyes sparkled with divine light. Surrounded by the aura of Great Dao, he was like a divine king who was bathed in a sea of principles.

After 3,000 years, he had finally fused the seventh principle in the dao-comprehension river. His realm had also smoothly broken through from the third-level Ruler to the fourth-level Ruler.

“Is this the power of the fourth-level Ruler?” Jian Wushuang opened his palm and carefully felt the powerful power in his body. A satisfied smile appeared on his face.

He could feel that after breaking through to the fourth-level Ruler, his divine power was at least dozens of times stronger than before!

However, his divine power was 13,500 times stronger than that of an ordinary cultivator!

It was 13,500 times stronger than that of an ordinary fourth-level Ruler. In terms of divine power, he was stronger than many Ultimate Rulers.

However, this was not his biggest gain.

The most important thing was that his comprehension of the universe principles had reached a higher level than it had been 3,000 years ago!

Of course, the reason why his comprehension of the universe principles had improved greatly was because of the dao-Enlightenment River, in addition to the two lower-grade principle divine fruits that Ninth Kalpa King had lost to him.

No, it was because of the River Spirit.

“River Spirit, I can break through to the fourth-level Ruler in just 3,000 years thanks to your care.” Jian Wushuang looked at the center of the Enlightenment River and said with a faint smile.

There, River Spirit lay weakly on the surface of the river. He turned his head to glance at Jian Wushuang and opened his mouth to say something, but in the end, he shook his head helplessly.

3,899 strikes!

In the past 3,000 years, Jian Wushuang had cut him 3,899 times. He remembered every single strike clearly!

What did that mean?

He had died 3,899 times!

Was this something that a human could do?

What did he take his honorable Lord River Spirit for?

No one could understand his feelings. Under the suppression of the divine devil suppression tablet, he could neither escape nor escape. He could only watch helplessly. Every time Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of the universe principles reached a bottleneck, he would reach out his hand with a smile and slash at his body with a bang.

As the embodiment of the will of the dao-Enlightenment River and the origin of the principles, each time he died, the aura of the universal principles and principles in the dao-Enlightenment River would become stronger.

Thus, a large amount of the universal principles and principles collapsed and were fed back into the dao-Enlightenment River. Then, Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of the universal principles and the fusion of the universal principles would be accelerated.

“River Spirit, I’ve wronged you for the past 3,000 years. But don’t worry, I, Jian Wushuang, will repay you generously in the future.”

Jian Wushuang cupped his hands toward River Spirit seriously. In any case, he was very grateful to River Spirit. After all, without River Spirit, he would not have been able to break through to the fourth-level Ruler level in 3,000 years, his comprehension of the universal principles had increased by a large margin.

“You can go. I don’t want to see you again.” River Spirit waved his hand weakly. Now he had nothing else to ask. He only hoped that this bastard would leave as soon as possible.

Jian Wushuang smiled and said no more. He stomped his feet and soared into the sky, leaving the third mountain range.

...

In the manor where Jian Wushuang lived in the sixth mountain range.

A graceful figure was standing by the railing, holding a bag of fish food in her hand. She casually threw it down, causing thousands of koi to flip in the lake. The scene was quite spectacular.

“Shuang ‘er.”

At this moment, a pair of hands gently wrapped around the graceful figure’s waist. Then, a soft voice sounded behind her ear.

Leng Rushuang did not panic at all. Instead, she smiled and said, “Husband, you came out of seclusion so quickly?”

Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile. “Shuang ‘er, I haven’t seen you for 3,000 years. I can see that your aura is about to break through to the fourth level of the Ruler realm, right?”

“Yes, soon.” Leng Rushuang also nodded.

She had already broken through to the third level of the Ruler realm earlier than Jian Wushuang, and because she had absorbed the heart of the Star World, her potential was also enormous.

Now that the seventh principle was about to be fused, she was close to breaking through to the fourth-level Ruler.

It was a pity that Leng Rushuang was not a special life form after all. She could not obtain many resources in the Life Palace. Otherwise, she could have cultivated in the Enlightenment River for thousands of years just like Jian Wushuang.

After returning from the Enlightenment River, Jian Wushuang stayed in his manor with his wife.

Until three years later...

“Jian Wushuang, come to me quickly.” Ruler Blood Wave’s voice suddenly rang in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. Ruler Blood Wave was one of the chief supremacies of the Life Palace. Normally, he would not summon him unless there was something wrong. Now, not only did he summon him personally, but he also used the word ‘come quickly’, he was afraid that something urgent had happened.

“Shuang ‘er, Ruler Blood Wave is looking for me. You stay here for a while.” After greeting Leng Rushuang, Jian Wushuang did not dare to delay and rushed to Ruler Blood Wave.

Under the guidance of Ruler Blood Wave, Jian Wushuang soon arrived at a towering temple.

As soon as he entered the temple, Jian Wushuang’s pupils could not help shrinking.

The atmosphere was too heavy.

In the main hall, an old man with a rotten aura was sitting on the main seat. Ruler Blood Wave and Supreme Giant Axe were sitting on the vice seats of the old man with serious expressions on their faces. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Under the three of them, more than 20 special beings at the level of an Ultimate Ruler were sitting upright with ugly expressions on their faces.
