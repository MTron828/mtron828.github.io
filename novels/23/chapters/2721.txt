Chapter 2722: Badly Wounded

𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Bang!

Jian Wushuang, Yi Shen, and the Devilish Wind King were directly sent flying by the golden sword light after a loud bang.

However, Yi Shen waved his hand at the moment they were sent flying. A mighty wave of grey haze immediately came pouring out like huge grey snakes. There was a huge number of grey snakes that completely covered the golden principle spirit entirely.

“Let’s go now!” Yi Shen yelled softly. Jian Wushuang and Devilish Wind King also grabbed this opportunity to walk past the golden principle spirit and skimmed toward the void in front of them.

The golden principle spirit they met was pestered by the grey snakes so it failed in taking action to stop them.

They almost succeeded in moving past the golden principle spirit when suddenly...a ghostly golden figure appeared beside the three of them.

“What?” Jian Wushuang and the two others’ expressions changed.

They noticed that the golden figure which suddenly appeared was the second golden principle spirit.

However, was that second golden principle spirit not being pestered by Hong Chen and Long Xianzi?

Why did it run over to their side?

Whoosh!

The golden principle spirit waved its sword as the golden sword-light directly attacked Jian Wushuang who was the closest.

“Be careful!”

“Alliance Master Su Han, dodge!” Both the Devilish Wind King and Yi Shen immediately called out loudly.

Jian Wushuang also had a frightened expression on his face and subconsciously waved the sword in his hand to block the attack.

As a result, Jian Wushuang was crushed the moment both sword-lights met.

“Puff!” Jian Wushuang directly vomited a mouthful of blood as his face turned pale.

“Retreat now.” The Devilish Wind King and Yi Shen beside him immediately took action. Moments later, Hong Chen and Long Xianzi also rushed over and finally relieved the pressure on Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang, Devilish Wind King, and Yi Shen finally made their way out of this void area shortly and appeared at the edge.

Saber Master, Hong Chen, and Long Xianzi had soon got rid of the golden principle spirit that was pestering them and arrived at the area.

“Alliance Master Su Han, are you alright?” The Devilish Wind King looked over at him.

“I’m alright, I’m just slightly wounded.” Jian Wushuang was extremely pale with his breathing comparatively weakened to before. It obviously looked like he was badly wounded.

Of course, it was all just an act. The sword attack from the golden principle spirit was extremely powerful but still slightly insufficient to really injure him. In addition, he would be able to instantly recover by relying on his divine power even if he was badly injured.

Although the six of them seemed to be working together, everyone had their own motives. It was only natural that Jian Wushuang did not want to expose too much of his strength.

Apart from that, he had to purposely hide his true strength so the five other Grand Ultimate Gods did not pay too much attention to him.

The golden principle spirit’s attack provided him a great opportunity to hide his strength, hence he pretended to be badly wounded by the golden principle spirit.

“Hong Chen and Long Xianzi are supposed to pester the second golden principle spirit. The two of them are High-level Grand Ultimate Gods with high combat power so they can’t possibly fail in keeping a golden principle spirit distracted, hence...if I guess correctly, the two of them purposely allowed the previous occurrence to happen. More specifically, Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen did it on purpose,” said the Devilish Wind King softly while standing beside Jian Wushuang.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang’s facial expression slightly quivered as he glanced at Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen beside him.

The latter acted as though it had nothing to do with himself and did not even glance at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently when he saw the situation.

He knew Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen had purposely lured the second golden principle spirit over but did not bluntly point it out.

‘He must be trying to test my true strength?’ Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

He knew that among the six Grand Ultimate Gods who entered the secret realm that time, five knew of each other well as they had previously explored the realm together. Although their visit was 50 years later, there should not be any huge changes in their strength.

However, he was different.

Everybody in the Danyang Continent knew he was a top genius who killed Fo Yi head-on when he was still a Peak Heaven Ultimate God. Currently, he had already made a breakthrough from Peak Heaven Ultimate God to a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God after 30 years. His strength must have increased to a whole new level but the five present had no idea how strong he was.

Therefore, Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen had planned to test him on purpose with the help of the golden principle spirit in forcing him to take action. It was best if that move forced him to show his true strength.

Unfortunately, Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen was fated to be disappointed as Jian Wushuang did not display his true strength and even pretended to be heavily wounded.

On top of that, his pretense was so good the Grand Ultimate Gods around him could not see through it.

‘This Su Han...’ Grand Ultimate God shot a glance at Jian Wushuang but slightly frowned.

‘I heard he killed Fo Yi head-on thirty years ago when he was still a Peak Heaven Ultimate God. He should be extremely strong since he is currently a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God. Even if he’s not as powerful as me, he should be comparable to my strength. However, the power that he displayed just now...’

‘Humph! Looks like there’s some embellishment about his previous success in killing Fo Yi. After all, the difference between a Heaven Ultimate God and Grand Ultimate God is huge and isn’t something a person can easily compensate for. Apart from that, Fo Yi had strong combat prowess, hence I don’t think he did it alone and must’ve worked with a couple of people to kill Fo Yi. Even if he did it alone, he must have paid a serious price and used some unbelievable final measures that must be something not easily used.’

‘His true strength is just like this. Even though he had made a breakthrough, his combat power is still some distance away when compared to a High-level Grand Ultimate God,’ thought Hong Chen to himself as though already had a vague judgment toward Jian Wushuang’s combat prowess.

He had no idea what he saw was Jian Wushuang purposely putting on an act to show him.

Therefore, his judgment had been wrong from the beginning.

“We’ve passed the second dangerous area, so let’s continue onward,” said Saber Master.

“Alright.” The other Grand Ultimate Gods nodded.

“Alliance Master Su Han, don’t worry. We should arrive at the inner area of this secret realm after passing through the second dangerous area. Apart from that, there will be a place for you to rest and recover your divine power,” said the Devilish Wind King.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

The group continued to glide toward the void ahead.

Jian Wushuang was still extremely pale during the journey as he continuously took a couple of healing pills before his complexion finally got better.

After continuously gliding forward for half an hour, a huge floating castle located at the black and huge void in front of them appeared.

The old castle was the true core of that secret realm!
