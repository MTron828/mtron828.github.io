Chapter 292: The First Protector

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Lord of Demons Island was not much stronger than Xue Ying, so he was only able to struggle for a short period of time before he was killed by Jian Wushuang and the Master of Heartless Sect.

“The baldy had been fighting against me for many years. But he is finally dead,” the Master of Heartless Sect said and sighed, while standing in front of the Lord of Demons Island. Then he looked toward Jian Wushuang and said, with a smile, “Swordsman, your Realm of Sword Essence is really special. Without your Realm of Sword Essence that restricted his speed, we would not have been able to kill him so easily.”

“It’s just a little trick,” Jian Wushuang replied with a casual smile.

Sword Realm was a special and powerful Sword Skill. As a superior third-grade sword technique, it was not weaker than an inferior second-grade sword technique.

“You have lots of tricks,” Master of Heartless Sect continued with a smile, “Today, you killed a Half-saint expert by yourself. Compared to your strength, I feel ashamed of myself. I believe the Bloodmoon List will have your name soon. You will definitely rank high, at least higher than me.”

The Master of Heartless Sect was very clear that Jian Wushuang was stronger than him.

After all, he could only try his best to defeat a Half-saint expert, but he could not kill such an opponent.

However, Jian Wushuang could kill a Half-saint expert in a straightforward fight.

...

After Xue Ying and the Lord of Demons Island died, the final fight eventually ended.

The Heartless Sect seized victory, and Demons Island collapsed because of the death of their Lord.

This fight caused a sensation in the whole Skywave Prefecture. Numerous experts were shocked by the deaths of the two Half-saint experts.

A name spread through the whole prefecture.

Swordsman!

A man who had reached the Initial Yang Void Realm had killed Xue Ying by himself. Then he killed the Lord of Demons Island with the Master of Heartless Sect. Everyone marveled at his strength.

The next day, the Bloodmoon List was updated, with a great change.

“Swordsman ranks 99th.”

“He has reached the Initial Yang Void Realm. It’s confirmed that his attacks were straightforward and he killed Xue Ying, a Half-saint expert whose strength remained at the peak. There were many Half-saint experts on the list, but few could kill a Half-saint expert with a frontal attack, so our Bloodmoon Hotel affirmed that Swordsman was qualified to rank 99th.”

With the affirmation from the Bloodmoon Hotel and his battle results, Jian Wushuang’s ranking was instantly accepted by the public.

“Haha, he ranks 99th, much higher than me.” The Master of Heartless Sect laughed out while reading the rankings. He was sitting with several Protectors in the lobby of the Heartless Sect.

He admitted that Jian Wushuang was stronger than him, so he thought it was normal that Jian Wushuang ranked higher than him.

“Swordsman, you’re famous now,” the Master of Heartless Sect said with a smile.

“Ranked 99th?” Jian Wushuang wiped his nose and gave a faint smile.

The other Protectors congratulated Jian Wushuang. Only five Protectors, including Bei Mu and Leng Yang, survived this fight.

“Listen,” the Master of Heartless Sect suddenly said seriously, “from now on, Swordsman will be our First Protector. His position is equal to mine. All of you must follow his orders. Understand?”

On hearing this, the other Protector smiled while looking at each other. They started to saluted Jian Wushuang one by one. “I pay my respects to the First Protector.”

Jian Wushuang did not know how to react.

“Swordsman, I failed to recognize your strength. So please don’t refuse my invitation to be the First Protector,” Master of Heartless Sect said.

“First Protector...” Jian Wushuang thought for a moment before nodding. “Fine.”

“Haha.” The Master of Heartless Sect laughed out and spoke. “Wu Jiu had been in charge of the Bloody Blade Team, but now he is dead, so you can take his duty. What do you think?”

“OK,” Jian Wushuang nodded and replied, “But I will spend my time focusing on my cultivation, so unless it’s something very important, I won’t participate.”

“No problem,” the Master of Heartless Sect immediately agreed with it and continued, “Though you are just in the Yang Void Realm, you have the battle strength of a Half-saint expert. You don’t need to deal with trivial things. Unless I meet a Half-saint expert who I can’t handle, I won’t bother you.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“That’s fine.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

The news that Jian Wushuang became the First Protector and took charge of the Bloody Blade Team spread through the Heartless Sect.

Many experts were not surprised since they had seen Jian Wushuang’s strength during the battle. They thought Jian Wushuang deserved this.

It caused a stir in the Bloody Blade Team though.

The experts of the ninth squad were excited. After Jian Wushuang came back, they enjoyed a few drinks in celebration.

The night was as black as ink.

Jian Wushuang sat on his bed with his legs crossed while deliberating about his plan.

“Once I’m familiar with the surroundings of the Tang Dynasty, only then I can carry out my plan.”?A glimpse of battle intent flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

On the road to the Tang Dynasty, he had made a plan.

Now it was time to carry out it.

Jian Wushuang moved his mind. Then a blood-red figure appeared in front of him.

The figure wore a blood-red robe and a wicked blood-red mask. He stood there with a roaring killing intent, as if he were a Death Shura who just walked out of hell.

This was Jian Wushuang’s Slaughter Doppelganger.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and gave the Triple-kill Sword to his Slaughter Doppelganger.

“From now on, you’re Nan. Go ahead.” Jian Wushuang gave an order.

His Slaughter Doppelganger nodded slightly and immediately left the room, disappearing under the moonlight.

“From now on, my Slaughter Doppelganger will begin to slaughter around the Tang Dynasty with my Triple-kill Sword, while I will stay here to meditate on the World Origin.”?Jian Wushuang thought in private.

The Slaughter Doppelganger had its own consciousness, so he could leave it to go out killing on its own.

His true self and his doppelganger could work separately.
