Chapter 1819: Lineage of Star’s Danger

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Lineage of Star.

Jian Wushuang, Qiu Yue and Jian Yi appeared in the boundless galaxy.

“Qiu Yue, bring Jian Yi back to Sword Star first,” Jian Wushuang commanded.

“Yes,” Qiu Yue nodded politely. Then, she followed Jian Yi back to Sword Star.

Jian Wushuang plunged to the cave dwelling that Hall Master Yuan and the others were waiting at.

On the way back, Jian Wushuang met some disciples and elders of Lineage of Star.

“That’s… Hall Master Wushuang?”

“Didn’t Hall Master Wushuang say that he was going back to his hometown? Why did he return so soon?”

“Not only Hall Master Wushuang, Hall Master Gu Xin, Hall Master Nie Yun rushed back not too long ago as well. Did something happen?”

“Humph. Regardless, as long as our palace master and our hall masters are here, there’s nothing major.”

“That’s true.”

There was no tension in Lineage of Star. It was obvious that the news about the Master of Star Palace’s death had yet to spread.

In a lofty hall, there was a vast, grayish void.

There were four lofty thrones floating in the void. The four persons on the thrones, including Jian Wushuang, looked angry yet sorrowful.

“Master of Star Palace is so powerful and he has the Secret of Star Palace on-hand. He couldn’t easily give play to fighting power of a Great Emperor in an instant, how can he die?” Hall Master Nie Yun looked in disbelief.

“Master of Star Palace, how did he die?” Hall Master Gu Xin said in a deep voice.

“Master of Star Palace died and all of us are in pain. However, it isn’t the right time for this. Even the reason behind the death of Master of Star Palace shouldn’t be our main focus. We should focus on what Lineage of Star should do without Master of Star Palace attending garrison duty personally,” Hall Master Yuan’s voice resounded.

Although what he said was cruel, it was the truth!

The Master of Star Palace had already died and that was a fact.

Lineage of Star couldn’t divert their attention to look for the reason behind Master of Star Palace’s death.

“Lineage of Star has too many enemies in Eternal Chaotic World. Back when Master of Star Palace first founded Lineage of Star, he even carried out a massacre once and offended many major forces and solo experts. As there was Master of Star Palace in the commanding position previously, the major forces and solo experts didn’t dare to make any funny moves. But then, if they were to find out the news about Master of Star Palace’s death, they definitely would jump out and even swarm toward Lineage of Star,” Hall Master Yuan said in a low voice.

“Plus, those aren’t the main opponents that Lineage of Star going to face.”

Then, Jian Wushuang and the other two Hall Masters turned to look at Hall Master Yuan.

“Before Master of Star Palace headed to ancient mystery land, he told me that Lineage of Star was in a terrible state. Not only because we have many enemies, but is also because of some things that Lineage of Star possesses that made everyone green with envy.”

“Firstly, there’s Secret Skill of Star Palace,” Hall Master Yuan sounded solemn. “Secret Skill of Star Palace is something Master of Star Palace obtained from the ancient mystery land. It is from a scary sect, Seven Star Black Sect, in ancient times.?You should be able to tell the power of the secret skill. It is definitely one of the killer moves of Lineage of Star.

“With such a terrifying secret skill, of??course, he attracted many people who are green with envy. Like Master of Star Palace mentioned before, not only do many forces and experts desire to get the secret skill, but also Sanctuary Alliance, including the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance. They once found Master of Star Palace to discuss it, but Master of Star Palace refused to.”

Jian Wushuang was then shocked.

The higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance?

The higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance? Weren’t they the super existences of Great Emperor level?

Even Great Emperors cast greedy eyes over the Secret Skill of Star Palace.

“B*stard, the secret skill was obtained by Master of Star Palace through blood, sweat , and tears from the ancient mystery land. It was because of Master of Star Palace’s capability. How dare they cast greedy eyes over it? If they were capable enough, they could get a similar secret skill from the ancient mystery land too!” Hall Master Nie Yun roared.

Of course, he was merely ranting.

“Besides the Secret Skill of Star Palace, we of Lineage of Star also received a White Blaze Fruit tree over the years. The White Blaze Fruit tree is priceless too. Although it is nothing much to experts who are Great Emperor level, it is enough to make many major forces go crazy. Forget about the others, over the years, there was a total of three Almighties who came to visit personally?and paid a great price in exchange for White Blaze Fruit. In turn, we of Lineage of Star benefited well from it!”

“It has only been tens of thousands of years.”

Hearing what Hall Master Yuan had said, Jian Wushuang and the other two Hall Master’s faces grew in distress.

White Blaze Fruit tree was truly a treasure.

In merely tens of thousands of years, it had already brought about many benefits to Lineage of Star. If it were to remain in Lineage of Star for few million years, the benefit for Lineage of Star would be even greater.

The major forces in Eternal Chaotic World were of course dying for a White Blaze Fruit tree.

“A man’s wealth is his own ruin by causing others’ greed.”

“Because of the Secret Skill of Star Palace and the White Blaze Fruit Tree, Lineage of Star was eyed by many forces and experts long ago. Now that Master of Star Palace has passed away, some major forces or solo experts, even those who didn’t share any resentment with Lineage of Star, would inevitably attack us as Lineage of Star is going through a drastic incident.”

“Besides, there’s another huge potential threat in Lineage of Star,” Hall Master Yuan continued.

“More?” Jian Wushuang and the other two Hall Master’s faces grew grave.

“The potential threat is you, Jian Wushuang,” Hall Master Yuan looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Me?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Yes,” Hall Master Yuan nodded and explained, “Maybe you didn’t notice yourself. Your speed of growth is too fast and you have too great of a potential. Plus, you are an inverse cultivator. Merely as a Real God, you could already match evenly with an Emperor God. It is definitely right and proper to call you the number one Real God. In such a situation, if you were to obtain the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill and break through to become an Almighty, your fighting power should be comparable to a Great Emperor.”

“Once your steady your footstep among Almighies and continue to increase your power, you might even become the second Emperor Bai!”

“But you must know that Sanctuary Alliance isn’t that united. There are many forces and experts that have internal fights, but Sanctuary Alliance doesn’t get involved in it. Your growth, although many are looking forward to it, there are also some selfish people who didn’t anticipate your growth.”

“After all, Emperor Bai alone has already brought pressure to many of them. Who would wish for the second Emperor Bai in Sanctuary Alliance?”

Hearing what Hall Master Yuan had said, Jian Wushuang suddenly understood.

Around Emperor Bai, who could kill a Great Emperor with ease, many Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance were careful and no one dared to act wildly. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Another Emperor Bai?

Unfortunately,?there were not many who were willing to see that.
