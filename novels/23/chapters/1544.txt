Chapter 1545: Things Have Settled Down

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

It had ended.

The crazy fight that was participated in by many top Universe Gods in the Eternal Chaotic World had finally come to an end.

Many Universe Gods who had participated in the fight left with sadness.

During the crazy fight, some people had died without experiencing anything big while some people had trampled on the bodies of others and got a reputation for themselves.

During this fight, Jian Wushuang was one of the most dazzling figures.

In particular, Jian Wushuang had obtained two White Blaze Fruit trees and nine White Blaze Fruits alone. This has allowed the Lineage of Star to become the biggest winner of the fight this time around.

His name had also reverberated across the whole Eternal Chaotic World again.

…

Inside an old cave within the Lineage of Star.

Jian Wushuang, Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao were standing in front of the Star Palace Master respectfully.

“Palace Master, I have already opened up a standalone star in the Endless Milky Way. Moreover, I have already started to set up a spell. As soon as the spell is complete, we can nurture the two White Blaze Fruit trees. As for the resources needed to nurture the trees, we have already prepared quite a decent amount,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“We only need to nurture one White Blaze Fruit tree,” the Star Palace Master said.

“Eh?” Hall Master Yuan and Jian Wushuang became stupefied.

“The White Blaze Fruit tree is extremely precious. Just one tree alone is enough to make many Almighties go crazy. Although the Lineage of Star is one of the big powerhouses of the Eternal Chaotic World, we are not strong enough to have two trees at the same time. Hence, I have decided to give the other tree to the emperor,” the Star Palace Master said.

“The emperor?” Hall Master Yuan was stunned. After that, he nodded his head.

As for Jian Wushuang, he had a puzzled expression.

“Jian Wushuang, the emperor whom the Star Palace mentioned should be the Purple Moon Emperor of the Purple Moon Sanctuary,” the King of Venomous Worms’ voice echoed in Jian Wushuang’s head. As the King of Venomous Worms only grew inside Jian Wushuang’s Ancient God Body, his existence was not known even to the Star Palace Master.

“The Purple Moon Emperor is equivalent to the Master of the Purple Moon Sanctuary. He is a super expert who stands at the top of the Almighties in the Eternal Chaotic World. Moreover, he is a lot stronger than the Star Palace Master, as well as the Almighties that you saw previously!”

“The Star Palace Master is really smart. He knew that with the Lineage of Star’s abilities alone, it would be very difficult to possess two White Blaze Fruit trees. By giving one of them to the Purple Moon Emperor, the Lineage of Star would gain the support of the Purple Moon Emperor. Hence, no one would dare to set eyes on the White Blaze Fruit tree in the Lineage of Star.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“The Purple Moon Emperor?”

Jian Wushuang also took note of the name.

“Jian Wushuang.”

All of a sudden, the Star Palace Master looked at Jian Wushuang, “It is all thanks to your abilities this time around that the Lineage of Star is able to obtain these two White Blaze Fruit trees, as well as a few White Blaze Fruits. The Lineage of Star is fair in meting out rewards and punishments. Since you have achieved a great feat for the Lineage of Star, I will naturally give you an award. Although this reward cannot be compared to the value of the two White Blaze Fruit trees, it will still be of use to you.”

“How about this: If you need any treasures or resources, tell Hall Master Yuan later so that he will prepare them for you. In addition, I will allow you to enter the Real God Hall every hundred years. Moreover, you can stay inside for one year for every entry, until you become a Real God.”

After hearing what was said, Jian Wushuang’s eyes brightened up.

The Real God Hall was the most precious training resource of the Lineage of Star and it was extremely useful to Universe Gods.

However, it was not easy to open the Real God Hall as every opening would require a huge price to be paid. Hence, in the Lineage of Star, even if it were the Star Palace disciples, it was not easy for them to enter the Real God Hall for comprehension.

For example, when Jian Wushuang had risked his life to complete the Ultimate Disciple Task previously, his total award had only amounted to three months in the Real God Hall.

But what about that very moment?

He could enter the Real God Hall every hundred years. Moreover, he could stay for a year for each entry?

What great treatment was that? 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Jian Wushuang, your talents knows no limit and there might be some hope for you to become another Almighty of the Lineage of Star in the future. Thus, the Lineage of Star will do its utmost best to help you grow. However, before this, there will still be a long journey ahead of you. The more noteworthy one is at the very moment. Your Inverse Cultivation Test for the Third Heaven should be quite close to you.”

The Star Palace Master looked at Jian Wushuang.

“If you clear this final Inverse Cultivation Test for the last Heaven, you will rise to the top at one go.”

“However, if you were to fail, there would be no more hope for you forever!”

“Remember, you must be extremely careful.”

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head seriously. He himself was very clear that the Inverse Cultivation Test for the Third Heaven was his final test, as well as one of his greatest obstacles.

This obstacle was extremely important.

“You may leave now,” the Star Palace Master waved his hands.

At once, Jian Wushuang, Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao bowed and left.

After leaving the cave, the three of them stood in the Endless Milky Way.

“Jian Wushuang, I have passed the Palace Master’s words down. From now on, you can enter the Real God Hall once every hundred years. Moreover, if you need any resources or treasures, you can tell me directly and I will do my best to help you get them,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Understood, thank you very much, Hall Master Yuan,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“No need to stand on ceremony. By the way, did you get what you wanted from Wu Bei’s cave?” Hall Master Yuan looked at Jian Wushuang.

What he was asking about was naturally the Method of the Inverse Cultivator’s sixth step.

“I got it,” Jian Wushuang giggled.

“That’s good. Continue your training. Tell me when the Inverse Cultivation Test for the Third Heaven is here so that I can help you to prepare,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Jian Wushuang nodded his head. After that, he headed to his own Sword Star.

At the Sword Star.

“Qiu Yue, this Qian Kun Ring has quite a few training resources. Please share it with your sisters. For the next period of time, I will probably be staying in the Lineage of Star. If you have questions that you don’t understand, you can come and ask me,” Jian Wushuang was looking at the maids who were below him.

“Thank you very much,” Qiu Yue and the maids were all extremely delighted.

As the Sword Star Master, Jian Wushuang treated the maids under him quite well.

He would help if he could. Moreover, he would give them some training resources occasionally.

For Jian Wushuan, the training resources that he gave randomly were enough to cause Qiu Yue and the rest of the maids to be over the moon.

Inside a secret room, Jian Wushuang was sitting down alone with his legs crossed.

“From the journey to Wu Bei’s cave this time round, I have benefited greatly. In addition, my Soul Power has risen greatly as well. For the abilities of a Universe God of the Second Heaven like me to reach such a level is already very impressive. If I wish to continue getting stronger, I can only improve my comprehension toward the Heaven’s Way at best,” Jian Wushuang was quite helpless as well.

In the end, he was only a Universe God of the Second Heaven. Hence, his abilities were restricted.

“I wonder when the Inverse Cultivation Test for the Third Heaven will come. Will it be soon?”
