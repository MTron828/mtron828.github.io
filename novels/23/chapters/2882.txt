Chapter 2883: One-on-One Battle Against the Three Saints

——

Outside the void, in the nearby market, countless cultivators were gathered there, focusing their attention on this battle.

However, when they saw the scene in front of them, all of them were shocked.

“Elder Su, the Grand Immortal Saint used all his strength to activate his domain-type holy treasure, but in the end, he was still no match for the domain-type holy treasure that was activated by the hierarch. He was completely suppressed by the hierarch’s blood river?”

“How is this possible?”

“How can a Divine Master’s domain be so powerful? Even if the Divine Master used a domain-type holy treasure, his divine power is still incomparable.”

Everyone was a little dumbfounded.

Everyone was in disbelief.

Only Jian Wushuang himself was not surprised to see this scene.

“Five years ago, when I was fighting with Realm Lord Tian Qu, I could see that although I was not as powerful as the Immortal Saint in terms of divine power, the gap was not too big. Now, five years later, I have broken through from a Junior Great Divine Master to a Senior Great Divine Master, and my divine power has soared again. After using the various secret skills, I will definitely not be weaker than the ordinary immortal saint in terms of divine power. I might even be slightly stronger,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

It was a fact that his divine power was stronger than that of an ordinary Immortal Saint!

In addition to the nine universes blood light river, his divine power was obviously stronger than that of Elder Su’s flame halo! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“The nine universes blood light river was personally refined by brother Mo. It’s a top-tier third-grade holy treasure, while the flame halo is only an ordinary third-grade holy treasure. There’s a gap of two levels, and my divine power is stronger than that of the Immortal Saint from the Point Star Pavilion. Of course, my domain is more powerful,” Jian Wushuang sneered.

Now that he had fully activated the nine-universe blood-light river, Elder Su’s flame domain had been completely suppressed.

However, that was not all. Jian Wushuang’s dark golden armor was covered by a layer of dark golden light.

Majestic golden divine power surged and covered the void in front of him, and his sword world also came into effect.

Star armor domain, the prison of punishment, and sword world. Three more domains and the nine universe blood light river were perfectly stacked together. In an instant, the power of the blood river that was already extremely powerful increased by another level.

Elder Su, Heavenly Oasis Palace Master, and Heavenly Oasis Palace Master were all Immortal Saints, but under the suppression of this domain, their strength was suppressed to a certain extent. This suppression made them only be able to use less than 80% of their strength!

“I didn’t expect that we Immortal Saints would actually be suppressed by a Divine Master domain.” The gentle smile on the Heavenly Void Palace Lord’s face vanished, replaced by a layer of coldness.

“Hmph, so what if the domain is strong. In any case, there are restrictions around. Since this brat escaped, with us three Immortal Saints acting, does he still have a chance to survive?” Realm Lord Tian Qu snorted coldly, his body already moving.

Boom!

Realm Lord Tian Qu’s murderous aura surged like a wild beast.

In just an instant, he appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. On his right hand, there was a black glove, which was filled with boundless divine power and destructive power. When the two powers reached their limits, they gathered together.

Bang!

Realm Lord Tian Qu struck out with his palm, and the world suddenly shook.

A giant hand descended from the sky. The giant hand was pitch-black, like the hand of the Heavenly Dao, and it could destroy the world.

It descended to destroy everything.

Jian Wushuang was the target of the giant hand.

“Its power is even stronger than the last time it attacked me. Moreover, its strength is limited by my realm.”

Jian Wushuang was impressed by the giant hand that fell from the sky, but his hand did not slow down.

He poured all his divine power into the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

“Cut!”

With a low shout, the Blood Mountain Sword slashed out in anger.

It was like a sword that could split the sky.

The sword light could split the heaven and earth, let alone a giant hand.

Whoosh!

The pitch-black giant hand that could destroy heaven and earth was instantly split apart, and endless destructive power spread wildly in all directions.

However, as soon as the giant hand was split apart, Jian Wushuang’s pupils suddenly shrank, because the black-robed Elder Su had already appeared in front of him.

When Elder Su appeared, he already had a red-gold long stick in his hand. This long stick was extremely thick and three meters long. As Elder Su waved his hands, the red-gold long stick instantly turned into a huge red-gold mountain, it swept toward Jian Wushuang in a mighty manner.

A shrill sound of rushing wind was heard.

Before the long stick approached, Jian Wushuang had already sensed the terrifying power of the long stick.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes. The Blood Mountain Sword suddenly swept out and blocked in front of him.

Bang!

With a loud sound, the terrifying power directly transmitted over, causing Jian Wushuang’s arms to go numb.

“This power is so strong!”

Jian Wushuang was secretly shocked, but he knew that in terms of the strength of his divine power, his full strength was stronger than that of an ordinary immortal saint. He should be stronger than Elder Su.

However, the strength of divine power did not represent everything.

His understanding of sword principle and understanding of rules were far inferior to those of the Immortal Saint, not to mention the secret skill he created.

Elder Su waved his long stick, which was bound to be accompanied by his comprehension of rules, the stick principle, and even the absolute arts of the Saints. Naturally, Jian Wushuang was not able to resist it.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang’s figure had already shot back crazily.

However, before he completely stopped, a strange figure had already appeared beside him.

It was the Heavenly Void Temple Master.

The Heavenly Void Temple Master looked very gentle, but he was actually the most insidious of the three. As soon as he appeared, he let out an evil laugh and his body expanded. Four arms appeared on his body at the same time, each of which held a purple spear tightly, in an instant…

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The purple spear turned into streaks of purple light and stabbed toward Jian Wushuang at an extremely fast speed.

Before Jian Wushuang could stand firm, he was caught off guard by the sudden thrust of the spear. However, his reaction was very fast, and the Blood Mountain Sword had already met it.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

The Blood Mountain Sword and the purple spear kept colliding with each other, producing crisp metallic sounds. However, Jian Wushuang was caught off guard and could not keep up with the speed of the purple spear.
