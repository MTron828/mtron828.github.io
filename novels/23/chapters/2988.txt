Chapter 2989: Godless Sea Area

——

The sky was dark.

Below was a vast sea area. It was not only huge but also unusually quiet.

Whoosh!

A figure appeared around the sea area and looked ahead.

“Is this the Godless Sea area?” Jian Wushuang muttered.

The Godless Sea area was also in the endless territory, but it was a relatively prosperous territory.

There were many experts in this territory. It was said that there were many bandits hidden in the Godless Sea area during the period. These bandits had very high levels of strength, including many Immortal Saints.

“It’s been a year,” Jian Wushuang murmured. “I spent a year to complete the two three-star earth-level missions. Now, the Godless Sea area is the last three-star earth-level mission. I hope everything will go smoothly.”

He had taken three three-star earth-level missions in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Although the first two missions had caused him some trouble along the way, he had only spent a little more time and effort, he still completed the two missions. The two missions added up to 80 million sacred elixirs, and now they were in his hands.

Now, he was doing the last task he had accepted.

It was the most difficult and highest-paid task, with 100 million sacred elixirs.

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang quickly flew into the depths of the sea.

…

In the center of the Godless Sea, there was an uninhabited island.

The island looked very peaceful, but in fact, it was just because someone had set up a magic array on the island.

There was a team hidden on the island.

There were more than ten people in this team, and all of them were experts. There were eight Immortal Saints alone, so of course, they were only False Saints.

The team was led by two people. One was a bald old man in a white robe, and the other was a slightly chubby youth.

“Uncle Lei, we’ve been hiding here for more than a year. How much longer do we have to hide?” The slightly chubby youth asked in a deep voice.

“No matter how long we wait, we have to wait.”

The white-robed bald elder, Uncle Lei, spoke, “The Godless Sea area is an incomparably vast sea region. There are no spatial passageways here. If we want to leave, we have to pass through the center of the Godless Sea area. However, it’s not like you don’t know that the four overlords of the Godless Sea area are frantically searching for our tracks. Once our tracks are discovered by them, the experts of the four overlords will directly charge over. There’s no way for us to stop them.”

“But isn’t hiding here a solution?” The chubby youth said, “Although the Godless Sea is huge and has many islands, the four overlords have many experts under their command. They will spread out and search the islands carefully. Sooner or later, they will find our island.”

“Two people have been to this island before, but they are only Divine Masters. They were bewitched by the illusory formation you set up, Uncle Lei. They couldn’t see the reason. But if the next one comes is an Immortal Saint, Uncle Lei, I’m afraid your illusory formation won’t be of much use, right?”

Uncle Lei’s expression could not help but darken.

Indeed, the illusory formation he set up on this island could bewitch ordinary Divine Masters, but it would be too difficult to bewitch an Immortal Saint.

Once an Immortal Saint came to this island, he could definitely easily find them. As long as their whereabouts were exposed, it would be over.

“Don’t worry. Master knows your situation here, so he made the arrangements long ago. He even paid a huge price to invite the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. We’ve been waiting here for a year. If nothing unexpected happens, the experts of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance should be arriving soon. Once the experts of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance arrive, we can leave this Godless Sea area.” Uncle Lei said.

“Heaven-cleaving Alliance?” The chubby young man narrowed his eyes, and there was a flash of light in the depths of his eyes.

Right at this moment… Whoosh!

A figure rushed over from afar and appeared in the void above the island in an instant.

“Someone’s coming!”

“Be careful, hide your aura well.”

“Judging from the aura that this person is emitting, he’s only at the reverent-god level. He shouldn’t be able to see through the illusory formation Lord Lei set up.”

The experts in this group were discussing.

Although they could not see the exact appearance of the figure above, they could feel the aura of the other party.

They were not worried about a mere Divine Master.

However, suddenly…the figure that had stopped in the void above the island suddenly accelerated and rushed down.

“What?”

“He actually rushed in? Could it be that he saw through Lord Lei’s illusory formation?”

The experts of this group were all shocked.

Uncle Lei immediately activated the illusory formation, wanting to stop the other party.

But in the end…the figure that rushed downwards was not affected by the illusory formation at all. Instead, it continued downwards and in an instant, it passed through the illusory formation and appeared in front of the group.

The experts in the team all took out their magic weapons and planned to attack.

“Stop, don’t be rash.” Uncle Lei shouted in a low voice and blocked the surrounding people.

Then Uncle Lei glanced at Jian Wushuang seriously. After a long while, he finally said, “Are you from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“Sure enough.”

Uncle Lei was delighted. He had long known that the members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance were dressed like Jian Wushuang, who was wearing a gray robe and a gray mask. It was obviously the standard equipment for the members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

“You must be here on a mission from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, right?” Uncle Lei asked again.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded again and looked around. “The mission I received was to protect a young master named Qin Dong and leave the Godless Sea alive. Which one of you is Qin Dong?”

“I, I am.” The slightly plump young man immediately stood up.

“Is that you?” Jian Wushuang glanced at Qin Dong and said, “From today on, you follow me and I will take you out of the Godless Sea area alive.”

As soon as Jian Wushuang finished his words, the experts in the surrounding teams all had strange expressions on their faces.

“Little brother.” Uncle Lei also looked over. “May I know your name?”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis,” Jian Wushuang said.

“My little friend Heavenly Sword Marquis, where are your teammates now?” Uncle Lei asked.

“Teammates? No teammates.” Jian Wushuang shook his head directly.

“No teammates? Are they teammates?” Uncle Lei asked again.

“No. I took this mission alone, so naturally, I am responsible for it,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“What?”

Uncle Lei and the experts around the team were shocked.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))
