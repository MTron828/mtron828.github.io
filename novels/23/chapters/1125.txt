Chapter 1126: Dan Xin

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Both the experts from the Green Fire Palace and the Jin Kingdom returned to the outside of the Dan Xin Palace again.

The two camps confronted each other from a distance.

Since a lot of people had been slaughtered by Jian Wushuang previously, the overall strength of the two camps did not differ enormously. The most powerful expert in the Jin Kindom was Heaven Shadow King, while the Green Fire Palace had Sunrise Sword Emperor to support them. Obviously, Sunrise Sword Emperor was much mightier than Heaven Shadow King, which greatly boosted the morale of experts from the Green Fire Palace.

“The Life Elixirs and Nirvana Elixirs came from the Dan Xin Palace?” Sunrise Sword Emperor stared at the Dan Xin Palace indifferently and said slowly, “If I am right, the Dan Xin Palace is controlled by a spirit. Come out, there’s no need to hide.”

Sunrise Sword Emperor’s resonant voice penetrated the Restriction and went into the Dan Xin Palace.

An awkward silence pervaded here and soon afterwards, a shadowy figure slowly appeared before the crowd from the enormous hall of the Dan Xin Palace.

It turned out to be a chubby bald elder who had a pair of eyes as small as those of mouses. He looked quite cunning.

“Is this man the spirit of the Dan Xin Palace?”

Celestial Masters from the Green Fire Palace and the Jin Kingdom all looked at this elder surprisedly.

He looked ordinary, and if he was put in the crowd, he definitely was the most inconspicuous one.

“Ha-ha.”

Being stared by so many experts present, the chubby elder let out roars of weird laughter. “I planned to play with you for some more time, but now that you have brought my identity out into the open, I have no choice but to make an appearance. Alas, these Nirvana Elixirs are going to be wasted.”

He looked terribly sorry for that and two dark purple elixirs appeared in his hands.

Everyone on the scene knew what they were; they were Nirvana Elixirs that they had just fought madly for.

“Are there any other Nirvana Elixirs?” The Celestial Masters from the two camps were burning with desire.

The chubby elder noticed their expressions and smiled weirdly. He clenched his fists and crushed the two elixirs in his hands into powder in front of those people.

After that, he threw them away as if they were rubbish.

“This, this…”

“You bastard!!!”

“You are wasting treasures recklessly!!”

Voices mixed of shock and anger sounded outside the Dan Xin Palace.

They had just fought desperately for the six Nirvana Elixirs and quite a few experts died because of that.

However, the chubby elder just crushed two Nirvana Elixirs casually.

Although they were furious and astonished, they were more confused. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

They did not understand what this elder wanted to do on earth.

“The spirit of the Dan Xin Palace, do you have a name?” Sunrise Sword Emperor looked at him coldly and still remained calm.

“Name? Of course, I have. But unfortunately, I have long forgotten it after so many years. Since this is the Dan Xin Palace, just call me Dan Xin.” The chubby elder said.

Upon hearing this, the experts from the two camps had an odd expression on their faces.

“He has forgotten his name? How long has he lived?”?Jian Wushuang thought and knitted his brows.

“He has lived since this giant battlefield has existed.”

Gu King stated,?“As a spirit without a master, he must have been living a lonely life over the years. No one can stand such a life, even a spirit like him. He surely has become eccentric and crazy. That means, Jian Wushuang, he must be a throughout lunatic!”

“Lunatic?”?Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“Dan Xin.” Sunrise Sword Emperor opened his mouth again. “You’d been on this battlefield for so many years and had always remained silent, but you chose to show up during this period. I assume you must have your reasons. Tell me, what is your purpose?”

“Purpose? Haha, my purpose?” The chubby elder laughed out loud crazily. “It’s very simple. I just want to fool you and make you my playthings.”

“Fool us? Playthings?” The experts from the two camps frowned.

Dan Xin continued to laugh crazily.

“I had been in this damn place for too long. It’s so long that I cannot even remember. I haven’t ever encountered any man over the years. But when I woke up a decade ago, I finally saw a human expert pass by this area…”

“So, how could I just let him go? I decided to tease him. I threw out a Life Elixir on purpose and let him find it and surprised him. Later, I threw out a few more Life Elixirs in succession and let him discover all of them. He was overjoyed and chose to stay here to search for more Life Elixirs!”

“Then, I guided him to find other Life Elixirs step by step, from which I enjoyed some fun!”

“This is the only fun I have gained during that hard time.”

Hearing Dan Xin’s words, Jian Wushuang frowned and thought,?“He hadn’t met any person over that long period?”

“This is an unknown area. Both the experts from the Green Fire Palace and the Jin Kingdom has just explored it in recent years. Thus, that human expert was the first man Dan Xin has ever encountered.”?Gu King said.

Jian Wushuang immediately understood that.

“Originally, I intended to let that man provide me with a little more fun. I tried to lead him to a place full of dangers and let him die there. But I didn’t expect that there would be another human being coming there soon. Obviously, they were from different camps. I deliberately guided them to meet each other and kill each other crazily for Life Elixirs… Haha, interesting. It’s fucking interesting!”

“What’s more interesting was that more and more humans came here to search for Life Elixirs. I designedly threw out Life Elixirs to cause you guys to fight each other. Seeing that scene, I was greatly pleased.” Dan Xin laughed wildly.

Outside the Dan Xin Palace, the Celestial Masters from the two camps looked terrible.

They did not expect that it was Dan Xin who intentionally threw out the Life Elixirs on this area. His purpose was to guide them to fight for the Life Elixirs madly so that he could enjoy some fun.
