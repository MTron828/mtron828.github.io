Chapter 1131: Announcing the Result

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After making the decision, Jian Wushuang immediately spent 210,000 Fire Points to exchange the Blaze Quicksand Gourd. Later, he returned to his residence.

He sat cross-legged in the secret chamber alone.

“Jian Wushuang, this is a high-grade Blaze Quicksand Gourd. Although you have obtained it, you still have to take a lot of effort to refine it. As for the Secret Skill in it, it is even harder for you to cultivate. You should refine the Blaze Quicksand Gourd first,”?asked Gu King.

“I see.”?Jian Wushuang nodded and then began to refine it.

Just as he was refining the Blaze Quicksand Gourd, a big event took place in the Green Fire Palace.

Right on this day, Sunrise Sword Emperor, one of the Palace Masters of the Green Fire Palace, directly announced the person who was qualified to enter the Sword World 40 years later.

The Green Fire Palace controlled three Secret Lands which opened at set intervals and only one person was allowed to enter.

Therefore, people vied for the opportunity to enter them crazily.

Take the Sword World for example. It only opened every 100,000 years. Thus, the experts who specialized in Sword Principles were all waiting for that chance.

Now, however, Sunrise Sword Emperor announced the owner of that chance personally. It turned out to be Jian Wushuang!

All of a sudden, the entire Green Fire Palace was thrown in turmoil.

“It actually is Jian Wushuang?”

“He has just joined the Green Fire Palace for less than a hundred years!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Who said that the decisive factor to get into the Sword World is the time one has spent in the Green Fire Palace? Nan had been to the Space-time Secret Land although he has only stayed in the Green Fire Palace for a short period.”

“Although Jian Wushuang has just stayed in the Green Fire Palace for a very short period, he has made great progress. He killed about 20 experts from the Jin Kingdom at one go in the battle of scrambling for the Dan Xin Palace. Moreover, he has seized three Nirvana Elixirs under the nose of the Jin Kingdom’s experts. He has made great contributions to our Green Fire Palace and I argue that this opportunity is the reward for his hard work.”

“Our Green Fire Palace has always put the shoe on the right foot. Since he has made contributions and his gift in Sword Principles is fantastic, he will surely gain a great deal after returning from the Sword World. Maybe his strength will skyrocket again and reach the Level of that of our Palace Masters.”

Many Celestial Masters discussed that in the Green Fire Palace.

However, generally, there was no one questioning Jian Wushuang anymore.

After all, in the battle for the Dan Xin Palace, Jian Wushuang had proved himself with absolute strength.

Currently, Celestial Masters in the Green Fire Palace did not dare to belittle him. On the contrary, quite a few Celestial Masters secretly admired him at the bottom of their hearts.

Jian Wushuang did deserve their admiration.

The Celestial Masters in the Green Fire Palace accepted the decision to offer Jian Wushuang the opportunity to enter the Sword World.

“By the way, I heard that not long ago, several Temple Masters had the intention to let Celestial Master of Malignity enter the Sword World, but now Jian Wushuang gained that opportunity. How about Celestial Master of Malignity?”

“They just planned to do so but have not made up their mind. And now that Jian Wushuang obtained this opportunity, he, of course, can only wait for the next time.”

“The next time? To wait another 100,000 years?”

“Hehe, Celestial Master of Malignity is by no means good-tempered. I don’t know if he will cause Jian Wushuang trouble or not after learning the news.”

These Celestial Masters sighed with emotion.

In an enormous palace in the Green Fire Palace, Celestial Master of Malignity received the information Sunrise Sword Emperor sent to him as well.

As those Celestial Masters expected, he flew into a rage immediately!

“Bastard!”

“This opportunity is mine. Tens of thousands of years ago, the five Palace Masters have reached a consensus in their hearts. Not long ago, I also personally asked Senior Sister Red Lotus about that and she told me that they would offer me this opportunity, but now… ”

Celestial Master of Malignity looked ferocious and took out a token.

“Senior Sister, I need an explanation.” Celestial Master of Malignity sent out the message.

The fifth Palace Master of the Green Fire Palace was Red Lotus. She and Celestial Master of Malignity were born in the same era and they came from the same Sect, hence, she was Celestial Master of Malignity’s Senior Sister.

“This is the decision made by the other four Palace Masters. Although I tried my best to oppose it, I have to follow the rules.” Red Lotus replied.

Red Lotus did not think much of Jian Wushuang.

When the five Palace Masters gathered in the Ancient Monster Clan and Jian Nantian demanded to take Ji Wumeng away, Red Lotus planned to take actions directly. He trusted neither Jian Nantian nor Jian Wushuang. Unfortunately, only she insisted to do that. The other four Palace Masters chose to believe Jian Nantian and Jian Wushuang.

When Jian Wushuang joined the Green Fire Palace and experienced the battle for the Dan Xin Palace, his fame soared. Furthermore, his potential and strength convinced many Celestial Masters in the Green Fire Palace. Nevertheless, Red Lotus still held on to her own opinion.

She opposed strongly when Sunrise Sword Emperor proposed to offer the opportunity to enter the Sword World to Jian Wushuang. But the other four agreed, so she had no other choice.

“Jian Wushuang, Jian Wushuang!!! ”

“It’s Jian Wushuang’s fault!”

“How long has he been in the Green Fire Palace? Didn’t he just attain a few Nirvana Elixirs in the battle for the Dan Xin Palace? Except for that, how can he compare with me? Why should I wait for another 100,000 years instead of him?”

Celestial Master of Malignity roared crazily and his roars resounded through the entire palace.

After a short while, his eyes turned scarlet.

“Jian Wushuang, I’d like to see what are you capable of!”

After finishing speaking, he stood up and walked straight out of the palace.

…

Jian Wushuang still sat cross-legged in the secret chamber quietly and a gold gourd floated in front of him.

It was not big, just like an ordinary wine gourd, but it exuded an extremely unique aura.

As Jian Wushuang lifted his eyebrows, a special Mark was left on the gourd. In an instant, he had a connection with the gourd.

“I succeeded!”?Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, from which visibly pleasant surprise was revealed.

“Great, you’ve refined the Blaze Quicksand Gourd. You should be able to control the Blaze Quicksands in the gourd,”?said Gu King.

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang nodded and could clearly sense the enormous and terrifying force contained in the gourd.

It was the Blaze Quicksand!

It appeared to be a gourd, but in fact, there was a vast space where Blaze Quicksands could be seen everywhere in the gourd!
