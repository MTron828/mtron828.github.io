Chapter 3550: He Fled in a Sorry State

“Although my strength is only at this level, you are still slightly weaker than me. What are you so proud of?” Red Nether Master shouted in a low voice.

“Slightly weaker than you?” Jian Wushuang laughed playfully, “That may not be the case.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Jian Wushuang put the Blood Mountain Sword back into its scabbard. Then, with a flip of his hand, a purple divine sword emitting a faint cold light appeared in his hand.

This purple divine sword was, of course, the Absolute Shadow Divine Sword.

“Red Nether Master, now you and I will fight again,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

Of course, Red Nether Master also saw Jian Wushuang’s action, and his expression could not help changing. “That sword is a universe true treasure. Blood Sword Master clearly has an offensive magic weapon at the level of a universe true treasure, but he hasn’t taken it out before.”

Red Nether Master’s expression was gloomy. He knew that he had been underestimated by Jian Wushuang. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Kid, you’re too conceited.”

With a stern shout, Red Nether Master attacked again. This time, he tried his best to fully unleash his power.

Jian Wushuang took a simple step forward and instantly slashed down with the longsword in his hand.

It was the peerless sword technique, Xi Xiang!

Jian Wushuang used the same sword technique with the same power. The only difference was that Jian Wushuang had used the Blood Mountain Sword before, but now he used the Shadow Divine Sword. However, the power of the last sword attack…was obviously much more powerful.

Clang!

A low sound of collision was heard. Red Nether Master took a few steps back.

However, Jian Wushuang was not affected at all. After a head-on collision, he immediately gave chase.

In the void, Jian Wushuang and Red Nether Master were fighting again.

However, the situation had been completely reversed.

Previously, Red Nether Master had gained the upper hand in the fierce battle between Jian Wushuang and Red Nether Master with Blood Mountain Sword. However, now that Jian Wushuang had changed to Absolute Shadow Divine Sword, the power of his swordsmanship had increased greatly, in a head-on collision, Jian Wushuang had the advantage, so naturally, Jian Wushuang had the upper hand.

“Bastard, after the Blood Sword Master changed to a divine weapon, the power of his swordsmanship has increased by so much?” The Red Nether Master’s face was extremely ugly. He carefully looked at the purple divine sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand. “This sword is definitely an advanced universe true treasure, and it should be considered a top-grade one among the advanced universe true treasures. Otherwise, its power would not have increased so much all of a sudden.”

At this moment…

“I’m not playing with you anymore.” Jian Wushuang’s voice suddenly turned cold, and his face became serious.

Buzz!

A supreme destructive will suddenly rose.

This destructive will, with a hatred that was determined to die, completely exploded from Jian Wushuang’s hand.

A sword light also extended from the heaven and earth.

This sword light seemed to have split the sky of the Nine Twists Demon Cave in half.

“An absolute art at the peak of the sixth rank?”

The moment the Red Nether Master saw this sword light, his expression immediately changed.

When Jian Wushuang had used several advanced sixth rank absolute arts, he was already surprised enough. However, he had never expected that Jian Wushuang had also created an absolute art at the peak of the sixth rank.

“Block it!”

Red Nether Master clenched his teeth and swung his saber to block the sword light.

The sword light crushed his saber technique almost instantly, and a powerful destructive force was transmitted to his body.

Although he was protected by the universe true treasure armor, which had offset most of the power, the remaining power entered his divine body and directly depleted 10 percent of his divine body.

“That sword is indeed a top-tier senior universe true treasure. If it were an ordinary senior universe true treasure, my true treasure armor could at least cancel out more than 90% of its power. However, my true treasure armor only canceled out 70% of its power with his sword!” Red Nether Master’s face was cold. “I can’t keep fighting with him. Let’s go!”

Red Nether Master did not hesitate at all and rushed toward the void space at the fastest speed.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang did not intend to chase after him.

He knew very well that although he could suppress or defeat the Red Nether Master, it was still very difficult to kill him.

“It’s just as I thought. I’m a perfect level life-form. Even though I’m only at the Immortal Saint Realm, my basic divine power is still much stronger than that of an ordinary Principles Master. I have an advantage in basic divine power, and the first stage of the power of the Blood Crystal Armor brings out my advantage almost perfectly!

“Even if I only have four parts of the power of my will and one part of the power of my life divine power, I’m not much weaker than an ordinary expert of the six void realms!

“My swordsmanship has almost reached the advanced level of stage six. With Jian Wushuang’s help, I can fight against weaker experts of the six void realms head-on. For example, the Red Nether Master was at a slight disadvantage at the beginning. However, once I take out my Absolute Shadow Sword, I can easily suppress him,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

He had guessed that his current strength was no weaker than that of an ordinary expert of the six void realms. After the battle with the Red Nether Master, it proved that he indeed had such strength.

Of course, the Red Nether Master was an ordinary expert of the six void realms, which was why Jian Wushuang had the upper hand. But do not forget, the battle strength that Jian Wushuang mentioned…did not include the heaven-cleaving skill.

The heaven-cleaving skill was quite harmful to Jian Wushuang’s divine power. Therefore, Jian Wushuang had decided that he would not use it if he could not use it during his time in the Universe Battlefield.

For example, he did not use the heaven-cleaving skill during his fight with the Red Nether Master. Once he used it, his battle strength could instantly rise to the peak of the six void realms.

“In the end, Red Nether Master is still a little weak, but I can use it to test my strength,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile. Then, he took a step forward and continued to fly forward.

Red Nether Master, who was not far from Jian Wushuang, returned to a black boulder after he had gotten rid of Jian Wushuang.

“Phew.”

Red Nether Master exhaled and began to inspect his divine body. His expression immediately turned ugly.

“Damn it. I wanted to kill Blood Sword Master and take his time-space type true treasure, but I failed. Not only did I fail to kill him, but I also lost more than 20 percent of my divine power.”
