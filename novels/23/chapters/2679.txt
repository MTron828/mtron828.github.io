Chapter 2680: Surrender

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

It was really too fast!

In just a short face-to-face moment, their alliance master’s head had already been chopped off by somebody even before they had time to react.

Cleanly and neatly killed by a sword cut!!

“Why did this happen?”

“I-is this an illusion?”

“How is it possible the Alliance Master was so easily killed. Could this Su Han be a Grand Ultimate God?”

Multiple pairs of horrified eyes were glued on Jian Wushuang’s body as the Purple Beast Alliance experts were completely stunned.

They were not the only ones as the Dragon Divine Gang experts inside the black fortress were also completely stunned.

Although they already knew that Jian Wushuang was strong from early on and could fight the Purple Beast Alliance Master, they only thought he could fight against him with a small chance of winning. The result...was the Purple Beast Alliance Master being killed in a short moment.

A Heaven Ultimate God in the Dragon Divine Gang said, “Did you guys notice how the Alliance Master seemed to pause for a short moment just now as though he was completely stunned on the spot?”

“Yes, Su Han must have displayed some sort of secret skill to cause this if I guessed correctly. The Purple Beast Alliance Master was completely powerless to resist and was directly killed because of this secret skill.”

“What secret skill is that—it can make a person stop completely?”

“I don’t know but it should be a secret skill regarding space-time.”

The Heaven Ultimate Gods from the Dragon Divine Gang were discussing among themselves. All of them noticed that Jian Wushuang displayed a secret skill but nobody knew which secret skill it was. They only knew it was an extremely special secret skill and played a huge part in the Purple Beast Alliance Master’s instant death.

It was indeed the truth.

A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique was too frightening. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Although I’ve previously barely grasped this skill, I’ve never used it against anybody yet and never totally understand its might. I’ve finally learned about it now.” Jian Wushuang stood in the void as he was slightly shocked.

He made a move to kill the Purple Beast Alliance Master for two reasons. Firstly, he wanted a clean kill to instigate the best shocking results; secondly, he wanted to measure the power of the ‘A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique’.

Jian Wushuang discovered that he had belittled that secret skill after he used it.

The Purple Beast Alliance Master was a Peak Heaven Ultimate God! He was considered one of the strongest among the Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods yet failed to withstand the attack after Jian Wushuang displayed the A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique and entered a stagnated state before inexplicably killed by Jian Wushuang!

‘This skill is really too powerful. Using it with just my current power, nobody among the Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods will be able to withstand it, apart from those who also have a high insight towards the Space-time Law. I’ll be able to directly kill them as they will be my target once they fail to withstand this skill of mine and enter a temporarily stagnated space-time state!’

‘I’ll be able to wipe out ninety percent of the Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods with this skill. If I include my large collection of skills and hidden tricks, I can be considered invincible among the Ultimate Heaven Gods!!’ Jian Wushuang tightened his grips as the piercing look in his eyes intensified.

The Purple Beast Alliance Master was dead but the Alliance’s Heaven Ultimate Gods were still there.

Many among those Heaven Ultimate Gods were close subordinates of the Alliance Master such as the petite old man who used hammers and were loyal toward the Alliance Master.

These Heaven Ultimate Gods snapped out of their shock after a short while and reacted.

“He killed the Alliance Master! Kill him to avenge the Alliance Master!!”

“Attack!” Many Heaven Ultimate Gods immediately took action and attacked Jian Wushuang under the petite old man’s leadership.

However, several people did not make any movements.

Jian Wushuang glanced across these people as the look in his eyes turned cold.

Boom!!

The scary Sword World was directly extended as the Heaven Ultimate Gods attacking Jian Wushuang immediately felt his Sword World’s suppression.

They also activated their Principle World in hopes to withstand the Sword World. Although their Principle World was almost at the Profound Achievement, their Profound Achievement Worlds would still crumble like chicken coops under the suppression of Jian Wushuang’s perfect Sword World that stretched for 50,000 kilometers.

Jian Wushuang moved his body following that.

His ghost-like figure moved as though he was teleporting and appeared beside every Heaven Ultimate God before attacking with the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

These primary-level and high-level Heaven Ultimate Gods were incapable of reacting under that scary speed.

The Heaven Ultimate Gods were mercilessly killed by Jian Wushuang one at a time. The sword slashed out as heads were cut off one by one like harvesting wheat.

The Dragon Divine Gang experts in the black fortress felt shivers travel through their spines as they observed the occurrences.

They were extremely familiar with this scene as Jian Wushuang had attacked them as such three days ago but with reserved strength at that time. However, at that moment...

“Massacre! This is a total massacre!”

“It’s just like killing chickens!”

” If Su Han had attacked us intending to kill three days ago, we’d also have been slaughtered by him.” The people from the Dragon Divine Gang discussed among themselves with bated breaths.

Within less than two breath’s time, the Heaven Ultimate Gods who wanted to avenge the Purple Beast Alliance Master—apart from a small number of people who escaped when they saw the situation—had been killed by Jian Wushuang. Among them included the petite old man.

The void above Dragon City was covered in a huge amount of blood with the entire place painted a crimson red color. Bodies fell one by one and landed on the ground below before being laid spread across the ground while Jian Wushuang stood alone in the middle of the void with the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand—blood still slowly dripping from the blade’s edge.

He had a cold expression on his face as his cold eyes swept through the experts of the Purple Beast Alliance who escaped to their surroundings.

“Surrender or prepare to be wiped out!” Jian Wushuang’s demon-like voice echoed around the void above the Dragon City.

Many of the remaining experts looked at each other when they heard Jian Wushuang’s words and were secretly frightened.

The evil black-clothed woman who previously attacked Jian Wushuang was the first to walk forward and respectfully said. “Lord Su Han, I—Hei Yan along with the Purple Beast Alliance experts are willing to surrender and honor you as our new alliance master.”

The remaining Purple Beast Alliance’s Heaven Ultimate Gods also said in awe, “We’re willing to surrender!!”

The Purple Beast Alliance and Divine Dragon Gang were only gangs—not sects nor clans. They only believed in honoring the strongest as their master as they were formed by a large group of experts with no ideals of absolute loyalty.

Anybody strong could be their leader.

The remaining people surrendered willingly once Jian Wushuang had shown his absolute frightening strength by killing those loyal to the previous Alliance Master like the petite old man.
