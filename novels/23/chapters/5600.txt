Chapter 5601 ¬†All Living Beings Are Chess Pieces

He had great confidence in the first sword recorded in the Starry Sky Chronicles!

No matter how formidable Broly was, as long as this sword emerged, it would annihilate everything.

Turning this void into a portrayal of the Starry Sky.

Space and time would be compressed into a painting.

This sword was his greatest reliance!

"Are you ready?" Jian Wushuang held the sword with one hand, slowly closing his eyes, sensing the power coming from the Starry Sky.

The battle between the two was about to come to an end.

In the chaotic region far away from the Western Sea.

Moluo and others stood here, but the direction of the Western Sea was now a scorched earth, turning into a battlefield ruin.

The powerful figures of the Earth Realm Divine Temple's headquarters had long sensed the intense aura of the battle, but no one came to watch or intervene.

Bai Yi's avatar sat on the throne, still holding a token in his hand.

When Jian Wushuang and Broly had just started their confrontation, he received the message. Before he could go, Zhen Ling personally intercepted him.

At this moment, a subtle scene unfolded before their eyes.

Bai Yi sat on the throne, while Zhen Ling, like an aged old man, stood at the entrance of the hall, gazing into the distance.

"Lord Zhen Ling, are you really giving up on Broly?" Bai Yi still felt somewhat reluctant, and there was a hint of unwillingness in his tone.

After all, he was a formidable practitioner of the Transformation Dao, and now he had grown to this extent.

Zhen Ling didn't respond; he merely shook his head, which, in itself, conveyed an attitude.

Evidently, Bai Yi was unaware of the true situation.

The reality of Mie Sheng, perhaps even the Four Great Temple Masters were unaware of it.

"So, it's you who wants to destroy the Qishen Temple!" Zhen Ling muttered to himself.

Initially, he had speculated and repeatedly examined the timeline, but he couldn't identify the person responsible.

He had initially thought it was Jian Wushuang, then doubted it, and when he took action against Hu Qing, he discovered the clues, starting with Jiang Shang.

Ultimately, it attracted Mie Sheng, and only then did he understand everything.

It wasn't someone else intending to destroy the Qishen Temple; it was Mie Sheng himself who wanted to destroy it.

Since he had set this calamity in motion initially, why create the Qishen Temple and bring him into existence?

He, too, was just a pawn!

"You shouldn't have trusted him!" Zhen Ling gritted his teeth, inwardly screaming.

He had limited information about Mie Sheng, but he could still discern that the opponent was far from ordinary.

Initially, he was the second strongest in the Moro Temporal River, a Half-Step Seven Tribulations realm powerhouse.

The Moro Temporal River was a moderately sized temporal river, and having a Seven Tribulations realm powerhouse appearing in numerous eras was already remarkable.

The emergence of the Qishen had led many to believe that the Moro Temporal River would expand and become a dazzling temporal river in the Starry Sky.

In the end, everything collapsed.

Behind all of this, there was likely the scheming of Mie Sheng.

Although it's unclear what promises Mie Sheng made to Qishen in the beginning, it is evident now that Qishen had placed trust in him.

Moreover, the individuals taken away by Mie Sheng were quite delicate.

Among the three great True Monarchs that evolved from the Dao of Devouring abandoned by Qishen, two were still alive, or, from another perspective, they were all still alive.

Shan Jun, Gu Jun, and Mo Jun.

Initially, the true form of Shan Jun was disintegrated, giving rise not only to Shan Jun but also to the four Demon Lords.

Zhen Ling knew about two of them, both taken away by Mie Sheng.

And there was Jiang Shang!

The extraordinary cultivator who appeared in the Qishen Temple.

From the moment Jiang Shang appeared, he had been cautious.

She did not show up earlier or later, but chose this particular moment.

Since Jiang Shang was involved in the chessboard, Broly was very likely to be associated with Mie Sheng.

In the Four Great Secret Realms, it was impossible to produce experts at the realm of Tribulation. The practitioners in the secret realms all had their flaws, and this was an unchangeable fact.

Unless Mie Sheng intervened to modify their Origin Sources.

Jiang Shang and Broly had not been modified by him.

This was clearly a move made by Mie Sheng.

Even if Jian Wushuang didn't take action, Mie Sheng would personally eliminate Broly.

But now that Jian Wushuang had taken action, it could reduce some unnecessary gossip.

In the past, he didn't care about such things.

But times had changed. Mie Sheng's appearance was both righteous and wicked.

It not only posed a threat to the current Qishen Temple but probably also to his position.

In case something unexpected happened, and he got kicked out, what would he do?

At that time, things might become difficult to explain.

Fortunately, he had foresight and established the Elder Palace, firmly holding the Inheritors in his grasp.

In the present Four Great Temples, he no longer believed in them.

Mie Sheng collaborated with Qishen back then. If Bai Yi and the others were to learn about this, rebellion might be inevitable, and they might turn to Mie Sheng. REùíÇad updated stùíêries at n/ùíê/vel/bin(.)com

Now, he had to wait, wait for Mie Sheng to make a move!

The fear was that after the other party left, there would be no movement, and he would be at a disadvantage.

If something unexpected happened, he could always escape.

Leading the Qishen Temple to other temporal rivers (also known as rivers of time and space).

Zhen Ling repeatedly investigated the Four Great Secret Realms and the entire interior of the Qishen Temple.

Zhen Ling was never at ease!

On the battlefield of the Western Sea, a peak showdown was about to unfold.

Jian Wushuang faced off against Broly.

Now, Jian Wushuang had once again reached the peak state, his strength comparable to that of a supreme-peak expert. The sword in his hand could easily slay a supreme-peak opponent.

Broly had also reached his perfect form, fully unleashing all the potential within him, and his transformation reached its peak.

His combat power had even reached the terrifying peak of the supreme-peak.

Comparable to ancient practitioners like Wu Zuo who had cultivated for countless years.

Swish!

Jian Wushuang's figure began to flicker, his speed surpassing imagination.

Although his figure seemed to be stationary, his aura had already reached the deepest part of the void.

"Starry Sky Chronicles!" Jian Wushuang roared angrily. The Jueyun Sword was held horizontally in front of him, and in the next moment, he directly plunged towards Broly.

"The First Sword Move!"

The Sword Qi was vast and majestic, suddenly slanting!

Countless thoughts trembled, space changed, time froze.

Broly clenched his fists, placed them at his waist, and with a sudden tap of his toe, he directly shattered the condensed space beneath his feet. He advanced towards Jian Wushuang, unrelenting.

In his hands, numerous waves of energy continuously surged towards Jian Wushuang.

However, the power condensed from these auras was slowed down, too sluggish for Jian Wushuang.

Numerous large circular energies were frozen in the void, like suspended suns and moons.

At the tip of the Jueyun Sword, a burst of Starry Sky Intent erupted, and the space began to distort amidst the tremors.

Time came to a complete standstill, freezing Broly's body in place.

His understanding of time was limited; he could only grasp certain mysteries through the Starry Sky First Sword. All he could do was immobilize Broly in the void; freezing his consciousness remained beyond his reach.

Thus, Broly could sense his own slowing speed, yet his consciousness and thoughts continued to race.

After being frozen, he once again erupted with a powerful aura, attempting to shatter the confinement.

His physical body was frozen, but his consciousness persisted.

Breaking free from his physical form, his divine body, accompanied by the Origin Source, shot out together!

This scene startled Jian Wushuang.

In the frozen void, two versions of Broly appeared.

One was a dimmed physical body, already abandoned by Broly. He had made a decisive choice; if he didn't abandon it, facing this sword strike would mean certain death.
