Chapter 2203 The Emperor Bai in the Pas

“Don’t worry, Sword Emperor. We will definitely abide by the laws of the Green Fire World. If anyone dares to be funny, I will take care of them myself,” Abysmal Saint Master stood up and said.“Yes, yes. Don’t worry Sword Emperor!”

“Whoever dares to play a fool within the Eternal Chaotic World will be our common enemy!”

The remaining experts and great emperors said.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang nodded his head in approval.

“Not bad.” Emperor Bai looked over at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang shrugged his shoulders. He wanted to do this for a very long time.

Green Fire World was originally part of the Eternal Chaotic World, but it had been completely isolated for a period of time.

Jian Wushuang really hoped that Green Fire World could completely integrate with the Eternal Chaotic World.

However, it was a pity that the Green Fire World had had too much potential and he had not been powerful enough back then. If he had allowed the experts from the other clans to enter the Green Fire World back then, he would have completely lost control of the Green Fire World.

Now, it was different.

He was powerful enough to control the Green Fire World and no one from the Eternal Chaotic World would try to do anything funny there.

Even the great emperors within the Sanctuary Alliance had no choice but to listen to him, all except Emperor Bai.

This was when he could give concessions to the rest.

The banquet lasted three days and nights. The experts left after their hearts were full.

Within Wushuang city, in a large garden.

Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai sat together at a table.

“Thank you, Emperor Bai, for all the things you did when I was in slumber,” Jian Wushuang said gratefully. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“It is a small thing. You fell into slumber because you fought Blood Emperor for us. Since you gave your all for the Eternal Chaotic World, we too gave our all to take care of you. Furthermore, you don’t have to talk to me so respectfully. We are about the same power level right now,” Emperor Bai smiled.

In terms of fighting power, Jian Wushuang would still lose to Emperor Bai.

However, Jian Wushuang had a lot of trump cards, such as Secret Skills of Star Palace, which allowed him to have fighting power a thousand times more than normal, which would be far above that of Emperor Bai.

Hence, Emperor Bai would not ask Jian Wushuang to treat him as though he was superior.

“This... Alright, I will still call you Emperor Bai and neglect unnecessary etiquette,” Jian Wushuang thought for a while before replying.

Emperor Bai smiled as he whipped out a scroll.

This scroll was the Mountain River Map.

“This belongs to you. After you fell into slumber, I kept this treasure. Now that you awakened, I shall return it to its rightful owner,” Emperor Bai said.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up with happiness. He took the treasure and put it in his Qian Kun Ring.

During that battle, Jian Wushuang casted the seventh seal of the Nine Province Seal and killed the Blood Emperor before he fell into deep slumber. He did not have enough time to keep the Mountain River Map.

“Jian Wushuang, did you receive this treasure from Xuan Yi?” Emperor Bai asked out of nowhere.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows as he looked at Emperor Bai in surprise.

Xuan Yi was his master.

He had appeared during the final battle.

However, Jian Wushuang had never spoken his name, and Xuan Yi had not introduced himself at all.

How did Emperor Bai know of this name?

“Emperor Bai, you know my master personally?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Your master... Of course I know him. Come, let me tell you a story.”

“Once upon a time, back in the first era, there was a little brat. He was the core disciple of his family. His family was very powerful and was the ruler of a territory. This little brat had a very high status within the family, hence he was a spoiled child.”

“This little brat did everything he wanted to without giving it much thought. He would stir up trouble everywhere, but no one dared to stand up against him given how powerful his family was. This lasted until one day, this little brat provoked a clan that was much much more powerful than his own family. Out of anger, that clan destroyed his entire family within one year, and killed all of his loved ones. He was the only one that escaped.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang saw that Emperor Bai’s eyes had started to tear up.

Jian Wushuang understood immediately that that little brat was most likely Emperor Bai himself!

“I never thought that the most powerful man from the first era was once a rich brat. Furthermore, his actions led to the annihilation of his entire family,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

There were many rich brats in this world.

However, they were not born this way, to be evil. They were like this because of their upbringing which caused them to do things without giving much thought.

Once these kind of rich brats experienced great setbacks, they would either remain affected by the setback for the rest of their lives, or they would evolve into a better person!

Emperor Bai was the latter.

“Even though the little brat managed to escape, he was extremely weak and powerless to do anything. There were assassins who were constantly after him. When he was desperate and was about to jump off a cliff, he met a mysterious man.”

“This mysterious man managed to convince the little one not to jump. He was unwilling to resign himself to this fate. He felt anger, as this anger manifested into hatred... Under the effect of the words of the mysterious man, he wanted to take revenge.”

“This mysterious man then gave him a cultivating technique called the Heavenly Creation Skill!”

“This teenage boy started to cultivate the technique and became very different from the remaining cultivators. His rate of growth was incredible, and was unbeatable for the people in the same realm as him!”

“He took one step at a time, from being a weakling to becoming the most powerful man in the first era. He eventually destroyed his enemies and took revenge!”

Jian Wushuang’s irises constricted.

Heavenly Creation Skill, an inverse cultivation skill!

This technique was given to him by a mysterious man.

That mysterious man...

Jian Wushuang stared at Emperor Bai.

“Like you should have guessed, that little brat was me when I was young. The mysterious man who gave me the cultivating technique was your master, Xuan Yi!!!” Emperor Bai said.
