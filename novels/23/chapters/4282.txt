4283 The Undercurrent Surges

“What?”

The expressions of the Nine Stars Saint Son, the Overlord, and the others changed.

The God Sealing Tablet was their only purpose for coming to the Ancient Path of Stars. They had paid too much for it.

If he handed over the God Sealing Tablet now, wouldn’t all his efforts on the Ancient Path of Stars go down the drain?

!!

This Qiu Long really had a big appetite!

“Lord Qiu Long, please forgive us for not being able to hand over the God Sealing Tablet.” The Nine Stars Saint suppressed his anger and cupped his hands.

“Oh? So you’re not giving me face?” Qiu Long twisted his neck, making ‘ka ka ka’ sounds, and said with a fake smile.

The First Prince and the Young Empress, who were standing on both sides of him, had cold glints in their eyes.

A wave of overwhelming coldness was directed at them!

The Nine Stars Saint Son, the Overlord, and the young clan leader of the Moluo clan were all shocked. The young clan leader of the Moluo clan, who had the worst temper, slammed the table in front of him and stared at Qiu Long. He said, “Qiu Long, don’t go too far!”

The Nine Stars Saint Son and the Overlord stood up as well. They stood behind the young clan leader of the Moluo clan, exuding their own pressure.

Seeing this, the smile on Qiu Long’s face gradually disappeared and he said indifferently, “So what if it’s excessive? So what if I don’t go too far?”

As soon as he finished speaking, Qiu Long made his move. A chain shot out from his back and was flung toward the neck of the young clan leader of Moluo!

“Good!”

The young clan master of the Moluo clan let out a loud roar. His arm, which was as thick as a giant tree, instantly shot out. It carried a terrifyingly huge force as it blasted toward the chain.

The Moluo clan only cultivated their physical body and not their divine abilities. They were born with divine strength and their strength was extremely terrifying. As soon as this punch was thrown out, the void trembled!

This punch was enough to overturn mountains and seas, crack the earth, and shatter the heavens!

Bang!

A huge explosion sounded at the point of collision. The terrifying force of the punch directly broke the chain!

Qiu Long licked the corner of his mouth and hissed. Before the force of the Moluo’s punch could be completely dispersed, thousands of chains had already appeared behind his back and were once again thrown at him!

Just as the two of them were about to start a world-shaking battle, the Nine Stars Saint suddenly transmitted a message, “Moluo, don’t be reckless. We are not Qiu Long’s match. Let’s retreat first!”

Looking at the thousands of chains that were charging toward him, Moluo’s expression changed. He knew that Qiu Long had yet to make a move. He let out a low roar and used Moluo’s power again to break the chains. After that, he stomped on the ground and flew into the distance.

The Overlord and the Nine Stars Saint’s faces also darkened. They each performed their secret skills and left instantly.

The First Prince, Blood God, and the others were about to give chase when they saw the three of them disappear. However, Qiu Long waved his hand and said lazily, “Let them go. Anyway, there are still tens of thousands of years before the Grand Clan Gathering begins. If they all die, who’s going to bring me joy?”

“Yes!”

The First Prince and the others smiled and agreed.

Qiu Long raised his head and looked at the Overlord and the others who had turned into black dots in the sky. A hint of mockery flashed in his eyes.

…

…

At the same time, outside the Ancient Path of Stars, the entire universe was in a turmoil because of Jian Wushuang’s death.

Divine Life Palace, Supreme Divine Palace.

The Blood Wave Supreme and the Supreme Giant Axe were sitting in the main seats, and the black-clothed men who had been sent to find out about Qiu Long had returned and knelt respectfully at their feet.

“Blood Wave Supreme, Supreme Giant Axe, we’ve found information on Qiu Long.”

“Eh? Tell me the details.”

The Blood Wave Supreme and the Supreme Giant Axe exchanged a cold look.

“Yes!”

The few men in black lowered their heads and quickly began to narrate.

After the time for one incense stick to burn.

The black-robed men turned into black shadows and left the Supreme shrine.

The Supreme shrine fell silent, and only the sound of Supreme Blood Wave tapping on the armrest could be heard.

“Blood Wave, if Qiu Long is really as the Shadow Guard said and is the dragon clan member who lost his Divine Ruler Realm when he failed to seize the throne, then it will be a little difficult to deal with. it’s not like you don’t know that the dragon clan has its own rules. the members of the dragon clan can only be killed by the dragon clan. otherwise, the Emperor God of the Great Void Temple would not have just sealed him and not killed him after he committed such a sin in the Great Void Temple.” Supreme Giant Axe frowned as he spoke.

The Ruler Blood Wave’s face was expressionless when he heard this. He indifferently replied, “So what if he’s a member of the Dragon Clan? He has already been expelled from the Dragon Clan because of the great taboo. He is no longer a member of the Dragon Clan. He is now just a stray dog.”

After a pause, the Blood Wave Supreme continued, “Furthermore, the incident on the Ancient Path of Stars was not planned by the Dragon Clan. I am not looking for the Dragon Clan, I am looking for the Great Void Temple.”

Supreme Giant Axe pondered for a moment, but a decisive look flashed in his eyes. He then laughed heartily and said, “Fine, then I’ll go crazy for Jian Wushuang. What’s wrong with that?”

He said it was difficult, not impossible!

He, Giant Axe, had never been someone to be afraid of!

The Ruler Blood Wave chuckled upon seeing this. It had been many years since he and his old friend had fought side by side.

This time, the two of them would probably start a massacre again!

Alright, then we will go to the Great Void Temple now and seek justice for Wushuang! The Ruler Blood Wave laughed and stood up, preparing to leave the Divine Life Palace.

Supreme Giant Axe’s eyes narrowed, and killing intent began to condense as he stood up.

Just as the two of them were about to leave the Divine Life Palace, a disciple of the Divine Life Palace quickly rushed over.

“Milords, please hold on. Supreme Martial Artist Gai Fu has some words for me to pass to you.”

Supreme Blood Wave and Supreme Giant Axe frowned upon hearing this. Could it be that Supreme Fu was going to stop them?

“What do you mean?” The Ruler Blood Wave said indifferently.

The disciple of the Divine Life Palace quickly said, “My Lords, Supreme Martial Artist Gai Fu said that he won’t stop you from leaving the Divine Life Palace this time. He won’t ask what you want to do, but you can’t use the Divine Life Palace’s banner. Everything you do will be based on your personal preferences and has nothing to do with the Divine Life Palace.”

The Blood Wave Supreme and the Supreme Giant Axe exchanged a smile.

They naturally understood what this meant.

“Alright,” he said.

The two of them nodded. The Blood Wave Supreme seemed to have recalled something and instructed, “By the way, regarding Jian Wushuang’s death, just like before, you can’t reveal any information to his cultivation partner, understand?”

“Yes!”

The disciple of the Divine Life Palace cupped his hands and replied.

The Blood Wave Supreme and the Supreme Giant Axe did not hesitate any longer. They looked up at the sky and reappeared thousands of miles away.

The Divine Life Palace was located in the shrine where the Supreme was located.

Supreme Martial Artist Gai Fu sat cross-legged on a yin-yang futon, surrounded by a few exquisite incense burners. Wisps of mind-cleansing smoke rose from the incense burners and dispersed in the air, turning into a thin mist.

“Little fellow, this is all I can do for you.”

...

An old voice came out of his mouth.
