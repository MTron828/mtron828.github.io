Chapter 2227 Control

The endless storm soon came to a rest.The fire that swallowed the entire city has gradually dissipated as well.

The peace of the earth was restored.

At the centre of the earth, Jian Wushuang put his Blood Mountain Sword in his Qian Kun Ring, gazing at the two corpses below him.

“Two Ancient Era experts...”

“Indeed, your powers were way stronger than they were in the Ancient Era. I can take you all down because you were not able to perform pinnacle powers. But because of this, it shows that you no longer dominate this era,” Jian Wushuang murmured. He had no pity for the two corpses.

Perhaps the two Ancient Era experts truly had no intention of provoking the top powerhouses of the era.

They indeed had no intention to provoke Jian Wushuang either.

But what they did could not be tolerated by Jian Wushuang.

They had turned a pinnacle Sir God, and even an Emperor God, into a Blood Slave... those were not the actions of a decent man.

If he had allowed the three Ancient Era experts to remain, they would eventually pose a threat to the Eternal Chaotic World.

“Master.” He Xiu reappeared in front of Jian Wushuang, his eyes full of fanaticism.

He was a Sir God expert too, he could feel how powerful the two people Jian Wushuang had slain were.

Unexpectedly, the two were much stronger than all those Great Emperors from the Eternal Chaotic World.

But even when they teamed up, they were easily cut down by his master.

The strength of his master...

“The backing of the Real Martial Arts Divine Church has now been removed. What happens next shall be left to Hall Master Wushuang, let’s go,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“Yes,” He Xiu nodded.

Immediately, He Xiu and Jian Wushuang left.

When they left, the countless cultivators that had witnessed that battle were completely blasted away.

Many cultivators had enjoyed watching that battle.

The battle to them was perhaps the scariest battle they had seen in their lives.

Too strong, they were too strong.

Compared to them, let alone Almighties, even an ordinary Great Emperor could not do anything.

They also knew after that battle, the Real Martial Arts Divine Church was truly over.

Even though Jian Wushuang had removed those Almighties and three Ancient Era experts, the Real Martial Arts Divine Church was still around.

But without the Almighties and backings, the Church would collapse in a matter of time.

The Lineage of Stars would never forgive the Church, and other forces would soon eat up their territory anyway.

The Real Martial Arts Divine Church had nothing to counter them with.

Jian Wushuang was only in charge of wiping out the backings. He could not be bothered to handle the rest.

Above the vast Void, an ancient spaceship hurried away.

In the ship, Jian Wushuang stood alone in a secret room, with the Blood Mountain Sword floating in front of him.

“Xie Yu, how does it feel?”

“Not bad, right, being suppressed?” Jian Wushuang smiled as his voice was transmitted into the Blood Mountain Sword.

Xie Yu was full of despair within the Blood Mountain Sword.

He was already suppressed by Jian Wushuang with a serious injury, with no time to recover. Being suppressed also meant that a large number of torture techniques were being used on him, courtesy of the Blood Mountain Sword.

There were many kinds of torture. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Torture of the body, the mind, the soul.

After Xie Yu had been suppressed, he had been suffering from soul torture. So painful, even an Ancient expert could not handle it.

In the beginning, he had been cursing and shouting, with no intention of bowing to Jian Wushuang.

On the contrary, he had kept threatening Jian Wushuang to let him out, otherwise his brothers would definitely not let it pass.

Even though Jian Wushuang had ignored him, Xie Yu had still been confident.

He believed his brothers would save him and crush this Jian Wushuang ant for him.

Sure enough, they had come and fought against Jian Wushuang.

Xie Yu had witnessed the fight clearly through the Blood Mountain Sword.

But he had not expected things to end up this way.

Dead!

His brothers had been killed by Jian Wushuang?

“No! Impossible!”

Xie Yu was in disbelief, but eventually, he had to accept the fact.

It sent him into despair.

If even his brothers could be slaughtered by Jian Wushuang, who would save him?

Or, who could?

Now, Jian Wushuang’s consciousness had finally arrived.

“You’re the devil!”

Xie Yu had completely lost it.

“The devil?”

“Haha, you should have lived much longer than anyone here, but your mentality has been the same,” Jian Wushuang felt disdain.

The longer one lived, the stronger their mentality should be.

But Xie Yu, an Ancient Era expert, could not even fight against some Sir Gods in terms of mentality.

“Xie Yu, I have some questions to ask you,” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Hngh, you think I’ll answer?” Xie Yu replied coldly.

“You will,” Jian Wushuang smiled deviously. “Xie Yu, you know why I kept you but killed your two brothers?”

“Because you’re much easier to control,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Control?” Xie Yu froze, but his face darkened greatly in the next moment.

At the same time, Xie Yu could feel a boundless Soul Power coming for him.

“Soul Power, you want to use Soul Control on me?”

“Wish on!” Xie Yu was enraged.

Soul Control was worse than death, no better than Blood Slaves.

Regardless of if it was during the Ancient Era or the current era, cultivators would rather die than allow themselves to be soul controlled.

Thus, Xie Yu’s Soul Power in his consciousness sea surged immediately, obviously wanting to resist.

But soon he realised, Jian Wushuang’s Soul Power was so much stronger, and he simply could not resist.
