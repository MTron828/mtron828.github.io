Chapter 1894: Barren

Just as the Master of Star Palace’s death was verified, there was finally someone who took action against Lineage of Star.

They either don’t take action or when they did, it was as though they were breaking a piece of deadwood. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

In Lineage of Star, Jian Wushuang looked cold. He sat on a throne as Hall Master Yuan and the others stood there with a constant flow of messages flooding in.

“Abysmal Palace, Soaring Heaven King Palace, Divine King Island, Real Martial Arts Divine Church, Highest Heaven Emperor Mansion, the five major forces teamed up and formed Star Extermination Alliance. There is a large number of experts that descended on Star Land!”

“Ice Mansion, Green Zone, Cloud Island are under attack one after another. The tunnels that connect Star Land to the outside world are all in the hands of Star Extermination Alliance!”

“Serum Sect, Fate Pavilion, Asura Mansion, the three sects followed the lead of Lineage of Star were in bloodbath caused by Star Extermination Alliance. The three Sects were destroyed. Besides, the force that yielded to Lineage of Star sixty thousand years ago turned and fought against us.”

“East Call City, Purple Maple City, the eleven cities under the command of Lineage of Star are attacked by Star Extermination Alliance. Lineage of Star’s properties in the eleven cities were all destroyed.

The news came in continuously. Jian Wushuang and everyone else’s face grew grave.

“They act very swiftly,” Hall Master Yuan said in a deep voice.

“Not only are their speeds swift, they are also very decisive. Star Extermination Alliance not only wanted to destroy Lineage of Star, they also wanted to root us out. They are not leaving us any leeway,” Hall Master Gu Xin said.

Jian Wushuang’s face was cold.

He knew clearly that if Star Extermination Alliance were to only intend to destroy Lineage of Star, they only had to gather all experts to the lair of Lineage of Star and kill all the higher-ups of Lineage of Star.

The higher-ups died and Lineage of Star would naturally collapse.

But then, Star Extermination Alliance had first conquered the space wormholes in Star Land. After that, they had started massacring Star Land on a large scale, taking one step at a time. They wanted to destroy all sects that were close to Lineage of Star. They didn’t want to leave any leeway for Lineage of Star.

They truly wanted to root them out, leaving no leeway at all.

Once Star Extermination Alliance finally achieved their goal, Lineage of Star would definitely vanish into thin air without leaving anything behind.

This method was really extreme!

In such a situation, it’d be difficult even if Lineage of Star wanted to bury seeds that could grow in the future.

“Send down my command. Tell all experts of Lineage of Star to give up the resources and property on hand and return to Universe Galaxy. Tell them that the territory that we took control and the resources that we lose could be taken back in the future. First, their priority is to keep themselves alive. Tell them not to hesitate,” Jian Wushuang commanded.

“Yes,” Hall Master Yuan immediately sent down the command.

“Palace Master, do we watch as the entire Star Land fall into the hands of Star Extermination Alliance? Do we not counterattack?” Hall Master Nie Yun asked with a deep voice. There was an unwillingness in his eyes.

Star Land was named after Lineage of Star.

Ever since the establishment of Lineage of Star, Star Land had been under Lineage of Star’s control over the years.

Lineage of Star had been ruling for so long and they had an absolute ruling power.

But then, Jian Wushuang’s command was obviously telling them to give up Star Land.

After painstaking care over the years… no matter who it was, he would find himself loath to leave.

“Resources are forever in control of the hands of the strong. As long as one is powerful enough, the lost items can be taken back. It is just a matter of time,” Jian Wushuang said.

“With Lineage of Star’s current trump cards and techniques, we could totally be evenly matched with Star Extermination Alliance,” Hall Master Nie Yuan said in refusal.

“Fight head-on? Maybe. But don’t forget that we are not just dealing with Star Extermination Alliance,” Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows were tightly knitted.

Although Star Extermination Alliance had gathered five major forces, Lineage of Star might really be able to be evenly matched if they were to give full play to their trump cards.

Star Extermination Alliance wasn’t made up of all enemies of Lineage of Star. They were merely the first that took action.

After Star Extermination Alliance, there were many forces and experts who were waiting for Lineage of Star to be destroyed. In turn, they could take a share.

In such a situation, Lineage of Star should give up what should be given up, without hesitation.

“Just do what I say,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes,” although Hall Master Nie Yun was upset, he also knew not to comment much.

Just then…

“Master, I am back!” A message was suddenly sent.

“You’re back?” Jian Wushuang beamed with joy.

He Xiu who had already broken through and became Real God not long ago came before Jian Wushuang.

“Master, I brought these back,” He Xiu passed Jian Wushuang a Qian Kun ring.

Jian Wushuang took it and swept it with his consciousness. He then revealed a smile.

In the Qian Kun Ring, there were Dao soldiers, a total of twenty of them!

The twenty Dao soldiers were what Jian Wushuang had told He Xiu to make a trip to Green Fire World at the last minute to bring back from Green Fire World.

Back in the ancient battlefield, Jian Wushuang had received a total of one hundred and thirty-two Dao soldiers. Then, during the six thousand years when Jian Wushuang had wandered in the ancient battlefield, he had damaged some. However, there were still more than one hundred and twenty Dao soldiers. But then, Jian Wushuang had only brought back one hundred Dao soldiers and left over twenty Dao soldiers in Green Fire World.

But then, Lineage of Star was in danger. Jian Wushuang naturally wanted to figure out ways to increase Lineage of Star’s fighting power.

Hence, he told He Xiu to bring the twenty Dao soldiers over.

Then, there were only two Dao soldiers left in Green Fire World.

“In addition to these twenty Dao soldiers, there is a total of one hundred and twenty bronze-armored Dao soldiers in Lineage of Star. When two to three bronze-armored Dao soldiers team up, they could be evenly matched with an ordinary Sir God. In other words, it would be equivalent to fighting power of over forty Sir Gods. In addition to the guest elders of Lineage of Star and the four silver-armored Dao soldiers, Lineage of Star’s fighting power of Sir God level wouldn’t be weaker than Star Extermination Alliance.”

“As for fighting power of Emperor God…”

Jian Wushuang was calculating his troop’s fighting power.

In terms of Emperor Gods, there was a total of three Emperor Gods who accepted Lineage of Star’s invitation. They were Emperor God Jiu Yin, Emperor God Xuan Wu and Emperor God Gu Xue.

Among the three Emperor Gods, Emperor God Jiu Yin was extremely close to Peak Emperor God, while Emperor God Xuan Wu and Emperor God Gu Xue were slightly weaker. They could only be compared to an ordinary Emperor God.

Besides, in Lineage of Star, there were three peak Emperor Gods.

That were Jian Wushuang himself, Qian Mingzi, who Purple Moon Emperor had sent, and also Jian Yi!

In terms of fighting power of the Emperor God level, it was extremely strong too.

Plus, there was the trump card of Universe Galaxy. Lineage of Star’s overall power was strong.

“In terms of fighting power, Lineage of Star has reached the extreme limit. Now, it depends on our skills!”

Jian Wushuang was soaring with anger.
