Chapter 563: Trap!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

A streak of Flowing Light flashed across an endless plain, known as the Blood Moon Plain.

In a grassy area on that plain, a slender man who had been watching the sky above him suddenly narrowed his eyes and immediately sent a message.

“The target has appeared and will be there in about 10 breathes.”

At the end of the plain, stood nine towering figures. They looked up into the sky the moment they received the message and quickly noticed a black figure.

“Here he comes.” The leader of the nine people was a hairy man with dark skin and eyes as sharp as lighting.

A sliver of light flashed in these men’s eyes.

The black figure, Jian Wushuang, was heading towards the Wu Yan Tribe.

Since there were few wormholes on the Monster Continent, he had to travel on foot.

He was currently traveling through the Blood Moon Plain, which was an area he had to pass in order to reach his destination.

“What in the world were those monster spies thinking? Why did they kill so many human experts?”?Jian Wushuang was still lost in thought while considering this question.

Suddenly, he felt nine bursts of killing intent in front of him.

“Eh?”

The look on Jian Wushuang’s face instantly became serious as he stopped, then he looked straight ahead and saw nine figures.

“Who are those guys?”?Jian Wushuang became alert.

He could tell that the figures were all powerful.

“Sword Emperor.”

The leader of the figures spoke to Jian Wushuang in a frosty voice. “We have been waiting here for you for so long.”

“Waiting for me?”?Jian Wushuang’s face fell.

“I’ve never seen these powerful guys before. Why are they waiting for me on my way to the Wu Yan Tribe? They must have known my destination, so that means those attacks in the Human Territory were meant to draw me out of the Holy Place!”

“It’s a trap!”

“The spies set this trap for me!”

The idea crossed Jian Wushuang’s mind, and he was immediately sure that he was right.

He did not know why the spies had targeted him, an outsider, but he knew that there was no way it was good news.

“Run!”

Having made his mind clear, Jian Wushuang moved to escape without hesitation.

He had been in Monster Continent long enough to know the monster spies’ methods very well.

The spies had assassinated many geniuses and experts in Human Territory, and once they targeted someone, their success rate was about 80 percent.

Not being an idiot, Jian Wushuang knew he could not defeat nine experts at the same time.

“Since you’re already here, why leave in such a hurry?” The leader’s voice resounded through the area. As the voice fell, an aura more overbearing than a Divine Emperor’s exploded forth.

The leader’s aura was like a burning flame that spread out in all directions.

It looked as if his eyes were burning as well.

“Monster... Monster King!”

Seeing the fire, the escaping Jian Wushuang felt the man’s aura suppressing him and it felt like a mountain had been placed on his shoulders.

“He should be... A Monster King!”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed in shock.?“I know monster spies have their own forces in the Huaman Territory, but I never thought the force included a Monster King. What a terrifying group!”

It was terrifying indeed!

So terrifying that it almost drove Jian Wushuang mad. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Monster Kings were on a par with the Temple Masters of the Monster-exterminating League.

All eight of the men with him were Rank Nine Monsters that were as powerful as human emperors.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang had to face them all.

He was reasonably sure that the monster spies had gathered all their forces in Human Territory to kill him.

“Damn. Are those spies mad? Why are they trying so hard to kill an outsider like me?” Jian Wushuang growled. He took out a Messaging Slip and send a message to Monster-exterminating League asking for help.

“Temple Master Pure Moon, help! I’m in the Blood Moon Plains right now and there are eight Rank Nine Monsters, along with one Monster King, trying to kill me.”

Among all the Temple Masters, the only one from the Monster-exterminating League that Jian Wushuang really had any connection with was Temple Master Pure Moon, and his only Messaging Slip was from him, so this was the first time he asked him for help.

In the East Camp, Temple Master Pure Moon was instantly shocked when he received Jian Wushuang’s message.

“Monster spies are trying to kill Sword Emperor? One Monster King and eight Rank Nine Monsters are attacking him together?”?The event was so urgent that Temple Master Pure Moon immediately contacted the other Temple Masters before replying to Jian Wushuang.

“Sword Emperor, I’ve informed all the Temple Masters of your situation. Temple Master Black Feather and Temple Master Nine Sea are leaving Heaven Wing City and on the way to Blood Moon Plains, but it might take them a half hour to get there.”

“A half hour?” Jian Wushuang looked grave.

A half hour might be a short time, but his enemies were so powerful that the battle could be settled in a matter of several breaths.

“Run!”

Jian Wushuang roared in a low voice.

“Sword Emperor, you’re not going to escape from here.” From behind, the leader of the figures chased after Jian Wushuang at a higher speed.

At the same time, a purple Restriction arose and blocked Jian Wushuang’s path.

“A Restriction?” Jian Wushuang looked even more terrible.

“Those spies are indeed well-prepared. With so many experts hunting me, they still set up a Restriction on the Blood Moon Plain.”??With only a glance, Jian Wushuang knew that he could not break the Restriction in a short amount of time.

“Asura Secret Skill, Road to the Underworld!”

“Asura Secret Skill, Bridge of Helplessness!”

Boom! The Blood River swept out with a huge blood bridge hanging over it.

The river was surged out and suppressed Jian Wushuang’s enemies, along with the Sword Realm.

Weng! A dazzling golden light flashed as the Golden Sword Soul Phantom appeared behind Jian Wushuang, followed by a Supreme Sword Essence that swept the area.

Jian Wushuang had the Heart-killing Sword in hand and his killing intent exploded as he reached the peak of his power.

There was a fever in his eyes.

“Since I can’t run away, I’ll fight to the death.”
