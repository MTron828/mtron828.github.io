Chapter 804: Commander Yang

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Both Jian Wushuang and the indifferent man with the saber had recognized each other but kept their faces impassive.

“Elder Lei Xin, you’re getting so bent out of shape,” the man said while casting Lei Xin a quick glance.

“Oh, it’s you, Commander Yang of the Cercis Army.”

Lei Xin looked at him and heavily said, “Jian Wushuang tried to assassinate my disciple, and I’m going to kill him, shouldn’t I? Besides, I’ve won 10 consecutive victories in the Blood Battle Arena and got a Cercis Token. I’m not breaking the rules, am I?”

“You both have Cercis Tokens and have the privilege of fighting on Cercis Island. It would have been all right if you two had just fought with each other, but your fight caused a huge stir and even destroyed most of the surrounding streets. I couldn’t just turn a blind eye to this,” Commander Yang said.

Lei Xin frowned at his words and looked all around.

As the commander said, they had caused quite a scene, not only attracting a large number of experts but also destroying more than half of the surrounding streets, with the ground full of potholes. Long story short, the vicinity of the battlefield was horrible.

Then Commander Yang continued, “If you really want to fight it out or have a life-death duel, you can go straight to the Blood Battle Arena. That’s the place for you.”

“Blood Battle Arena? Humph, do you think he would dare to go to the Blood Battle Arena with me?” Lei Xin questioned him while looking at Jian Wushuang coldly.

“That’s your business, but if you’re going to continue with this unbridle fight, I have to do something about it.” Commander Yang warned.

Lei Xin’s face instantly fell.

They were on Cercis Island, where the Cercis Army had great power. Although he was the Guest Elder of the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion, even the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion could not help him if he really offended the Cercis Army openly.

And he found that Jian Wushuang was not weak at all.

“He is only a Divine Realm expert, but in a real fight, I cannot beat him with ease! He is also confident in himself. He dared to meet me head on and didn’t even try to run away. If he had tried to escape, I probably wouldn’t have killed him even if the Cercis Army hadn’t stopped us.”?Lei Xin speculated inwardly.

Then he clenched his hand tightly and said, “Commander Yang, for the sake of you and the Cercis Army, I’ll stop today,” then he turned to Jian Wushuang, “but it won’t end like this.”

“You are lucky today, but you won’t be so lucky next time,” he whispered the threat, glaring directly at Jian Wushuang.

As these words were spoken, Lei Xin threw his sleeve and turned straight away.

Seeing Lei Xin leave, Commander Yang turned his eyes on Jian Wushuang and said, “Come with me. You have to account for destroying so many things.”

Jian Wushuang shrugged his shoulders, but followed him with great cooperation.

As they all left, the surrounding streets became quiet again.

In the dark secret chamber of a rather vast mansion on Cercis Island, Jian Wushuang sat quietly at a table, while Commander Yang, who had brought him there, stood while looking at him.

Suddenly, Commander Yang turned over his hand, took out a pot of wine and handed it to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang uncorked it and sniffed it. “It smells good. What kind of wine is it?” he asked.

“It’s Demon Nectar, the best quality. Just this pot in the market is worth two million Divine Gems, and it has a price but no sales. I got two pots by chance. Usually, I don’t drink it,” Commander Yang said.

“Haha, you are a commander of the Cercis Army and also have a good wine worth two million Divine Gems. We parted for many years. Now you’re really impressive, Second brother.” Jian Wushuang laughed.

Commander Yang was one of his sworn brothers from the Ancient World, his Second brother Yang Zaixuan!

He was the personal disciple of Emperor Xiao.

When Jian Wushuang left the Ancient World, Yang Zaixuan was still with Emperor Xiao. Now more than 100 years had passed, and he had not expected to see his sworn brother on Cercis Island.

Moreover, now both his status and strength were extraordinary.

“A commander of the Cercis Army!”

“As far as I know, in the Cercis Army, the captains of the 10-sergeant squad are experts in the Eternal Realm. and the captains of the 100-sergeant squad are experts at Step Three or Four of the Eternal Realm. As for commanders… they are in charge of 500 sergeants, at least at Step Five of the Eternal Realm!” Jian Wushuang stated his analysis.

“Tut, tut, Second brother, it’s only been more than 100 years, and you’ve made amazing progress.” he said full of admiration.

Jian Wushuang could see that Yang Zaixuan had broken through to the Eternal Realm, and that, as a commander of the Cercis Army, he must be very powerful, at least as powerful as him.

“I can’t compare with you.”

Yang Zaixuan shook his head and said, “You went to the Eternal World alone to attend the Firmament Territory Feast, and grew to the present step by step by yourself. But unlike you, I have made such great progress largely because of my Master.”

Then he gave a rough account of his experience. “After you left the Ancient World, my Master took me to a very strange place, where I got a very precious and important inheritance. Thanks to this inheritance and the many opportunities my Master prepared for me, I got to this point and became the commander of the Cercis Army only a short time ago.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Yang Zaixuan’s voice was flat as he spoke these words.

Generally speaking, people would hide great opportunities like getting an inheritance in the bottom of their hearts, and would not tell others so easily like Yang Zaixuan just had done.

The reason why Yang Zaixuan told Jian Wushuang this without scruple was that he regarded Jian Wushuang as his good brother.

Good brothers could share almost everything.

“You’re still pretty impressive.” Jian Wushuang said smiling and rejoiced at Yang Zaixuan’s great opportunity.

“By the way, why are you alone? Where’s our Big Brother Wang Yuan? Didn’t he come to the Eternal World with you?” he asked.

Their Fourth sister Su Rou left the Ancient World a long time ago and should be in the Eternal World, too.

After her, Jian Wushuang set out alone to the Firmament Territory for the Firmament Territory Feast.

The reason that Yang Zaixuan and Wang Yuan came to the Eternal World was special. Their trip here had been arranged by Emperor Xiao.

“Our Big Brother Wang Yuan came to the Eternal World with me, but he’s now not on Cercis Island but in the Tang of the East. Are you passing by Cercis Island on your way to the Tang of the East?” Yang Zaixuan asked.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He was only temporarily staying on this island, and his real destination was indeed the Tang of the East.
