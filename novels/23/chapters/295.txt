“Domain?” Jian Wushuang felt like everything was frozen. He tried his best to move, but he could not. It made him aghast.

“It’s too terrifying!”

Unbelievable!

“It might be stronger than Domain.” Jian Wushuang thought in private.

The white-clothed woman, who aroused all their attention, finally stopped. She stood there, like a peerless Goddess. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Elder Sister.” The scruffy girl called out to the white-clothed woman.

“You caused trouble again?” the white-clothed woman asked while looking at the girl.

The girl stuck out her tongue. Then she pointed at the experts of Skywave Prefecture and said, “It’s their fault. I just ate one thing of theirs, and I said that I’m sorry, but they still keep chasing me and trying to kill me.”

The white-clothed woman coldly looked toward the experts of Skywave Prefecture.

Her glance made the black-clothed elder frightened. He spoke in terror. “My Lady, we’re from Skywave Prefecture. Your sister stole something precious that our Mansion Master has cultivated for many years. Our Mansion Master is furious...”

Before the black-clothed elder finished his words, a blast of coldness swept over. Then the black-clothed elder saw his people become ice sculptures.

They became ice sculptures, and then in the next moment, the ice sculptures shattered like glass and broke into pieces.

The scene struck terror into the black-clothed elder’s heart.

Jian Wushuang, Tai Shan, and Mo Ying also were shocked.

Just a glance could change dozens of experts into ice sculptures and then cause them to shatter.

What kind of trick was this?

“What did you say? Repeat it again.” The white-clothed woman looked down without any emotion in her eyes.

“No, no,” the black-clothed elder said in terror while shaking his head. “It’s my fault. I’m sorry. May I beg for your mercy?”

“Hum.” The white-clothed woman snorted. “Go back and tell your master. It’s my sister’s fault for eating his things, but you’ve already chased her for so long. That’s enough. We’re even. If he is not satisfied, he can come find me. Tell him, my name is Leng Rushuang.”

“Leng Rushuang?” Jian Wushuang felt a tremor in his heart. He was stunned.

Leng Rushuang ranked number one on the Bloodmoon List.

There were 26 experts of the Saint Realm recorded on the Bloodmoon List. As their strength changed, their rankings often fluctuated. Several years ago, a person entered the list and ranked first. From then on, that person kept their rank.

That person was Leng Rushuang.

She had killed more than one expert of the Saint Realm, with bizarre methods.

She did not make any moves. She just used her mind to turn experts of the Saint Realm into ice fragments.

No one knew how powerful she was.

No one knew her origin, either.

Even her age and cultivation remained unknown.

Definitely, She was one of the most mysterious and creepiest experts in the Tang Dynasty.

The person who built the Tang Dynasty was also a mysterious monarch who had led it to develop to its current extent.

Jian Wushuang did not expect that this beautiful woman was Leng Rushuang and that the scruffy girl was her sister.

Jian Wushuang was only shocked by this, but the black-clothed elder actually shivered in terror.

His legs trembled. Looking at Leng Rushuang, the black-clothed elder shook his head like a rattle and said, “No, no. Our Mansion Master feels that it was his great honor to have his treasure stolen by your sister.”

“Hum.” Leng Rushuang glanced at the black-clothed elder. “You can go.”

It seemed as if everything was back to normal. Jian Wushuang and the others could move again.

The black-clothed elder felt relieved. He respectfully bowed to Leng Rushuang, and turned to leave. Obviously, he was petrified.

“Let’s go!”

Jian Wushuang gave an order and they turned around, ready to leave.

But the scruffy girl suddenly blocked their way.

“My elder sister only let the old guy go. Why are you leaving?” the girl said while smiling at Jian Wushuang.

“Sister, these three guys bullied you? Do you want me to kill them for you?” Leng Rushuang looked toward the three warriors.

Jian Wushuang’s heart missed a beat.

He was clear that he was not her match even if he performed Soul-Devouring Secret Skill. If he fought with her,?he would become ice fragments.

“No, I don’t.” The girl shook her head. “They didn’t bully me. Instead, they help me a lot. Especially this guy, he blocked those attackers by himself.”

The scruffy girl winked at Jian Wushuang. Then she turned her gaze toward Leng Rushuang and said, “Elder Sister, this guy helped me a lot. Please reward him to express my gratitude.”

Leng Rushuang felt a tremor in her heart and glanced at Jian Wushuang. “A warrior of the Profound Yang Void Realm could block a Half-saint expert and a group of experts at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm. Not bad.”

“Big Brother,” the scruffy girl said, while looking toward Jian Wushuang. “Do you want something? My sister is powerful. No matter what you want, she could give it to you.”

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly. He raised his head, threw a glance at Leng Rushuang, and then snorted. “Sorry, I don’t need anything.”

Then he waved his hand at Tai Shan and Mo Ying.

“Let’s go!”

The three warriors left directly.

“Elder sister, why not stop them?” the scruffy girl asked.

“Obviously, the guy didn’t want to form a relationship with us. So why did stop them?” Leng Rushuang replied.

“But he did do me a favor. Our father told me that we should show our gratitude to someone that helps us,” the scruffy girl said.

“You dare to mention our father. You sneaked out while our father was in closed door cultivation. You should be worried about how our father will punish you,” Leng Rushuang said in a low voice.
