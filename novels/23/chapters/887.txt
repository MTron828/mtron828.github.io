Chapter 888: The Cultivation Age on Star Island

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After the duel with Zi Dong, Jian Wushuang returned to his residence.

A piece of empty land.

“Go!”

Jian Wushuang controlled the scarlet longsword formed by 36 Blood-sky Swords. The longsword shot out forwards.

It traveled at a breathtaking speed. Suddenly, Jian Wushuang felt a tug in his heart. He controlled the longsword to change direction mid-air. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The change in direction immediately caused the sword to pause temporarily. After which, there was an obvious slow-down in its speed.

“Its forward attack was acceptable, but once it changes direction, its speed slows down a lot.”

“Awkward, it is indeed very awkward.”

“Seems like I have to spend a long time to investigate this Ninth-heaven Sword Formation properly.”

Jian Wushang spoke to himself.

In the following days, Jian Wushuang naturally continued to cultivate on his own.

He continued to split the workload among the two Original Bodies. The World Body stayed in the Divine Yin Thunder Palace for a long period of time. It focused on improving the strength of the Divine Yin Thunder in its body.

On the other hand, his Slaughter Body often went to Star Jade Wall to meditate. After a period of meditation, he would find Zi Dong to battle out.

Zi Dong had been ‘withering’ on the Star Island for too long before he finally found an opponent in Jian Wushuang. He could not be more eager to battle with Jian Wushuang every single day.

Jian Wushuang had a high level of awareness. In addition to that, he also had the perfect opportunity given by Star Island. Thus, he was naturally improving at a remarkable rate.

With an expert like Zi Dong to help him practice, Jian Wushuang improved continuously in his Ninth-heaven Sword Formation. He was becoming increasing familiarized with it.

The Star Island was cut off from the rest of the world, it was basically a giant prison.

Gradually, time passed…

The people on the island were like prisoners; they led boring lives. They spent most of their time doing emotionless cultivation, they had already forgotten about the passing of time.

Time was just a number to them. No matter how much time had passed, there was not much significance.

However, that was not the case for Jian Wushuang.

Before he came to Stellar Fog Sea, he asked Wang Yuan how long Leng Rushuang could last without the Dragon-phoenix Fruit.

Wang Yuan’s answer back then was 300 years.

That was to say, Jian Wushuang must bring the Dragon-phoenix Fruit back within the next 300 years.

300 years was not a very long time. For the people on Star Island, it was nothing. However, for Jian Wushuang, they were crucial, each and every year.

When he was on Star Island, he took advantage of every minute and every second to think of ways to increase his strength.

Just like that, he had been on the island for 210 years.

Jian Wushuang had never stayed at a place for so long ever since he started cultivation. It was also his longest in-depth cultivation.

An elegant man with long purple hair was seated at a table in an ordinary backyard on Star Island. He sat there while drinking from the bottle of wine that he was holding.

“Zi Dong.”

A gentle voice was heard and a cool, elegant woman walked in.

This woman was also one of the Kings on Star Island. She was on good terms with Zi Dong.

“It’s so rare to see you drinking alone. Why, did Xuefeng stop looking for you to gauge his skills?” The woman looked at Zi Dong.

“Ever since he defeated me 120 years ago, he rarely came to find me. The last time was 30 years ago!” Zi Dong laughed.

“That Xuefeng is really a Monster.”

The woman shook her head as she sighed, “When you guys first fought against each other more than 200 years ago, you basically outclassed him completely. But who would have thought that he would defeat you less than 100 years later?”

“It’s less than a 100 years…100 years was nothing to us. But in this period of time, his strength improved by many levels, it was amazing.”

Hearing that, Zi Dong could not help but shake his head and sigh, “Xuefeng’s potential was unexpected. When I first fought with him, I saw that his strength had much room for improvement and perhaps he could outperform me in the future. But I never thought that he would improve so quickly!”

“By the way, I heard that Xuefeng came to challenge you a while back, what was the result?” Zi Dong asked suddenly.

“What else? Of course, I was defeated by him.” The woman laughed bitterly, “I don’t even know what he’s thinking. 30 years ago, he started to challenge others like crazy. Not only did he challenge us Kingsbut he even challenged each and every single one of them in the Eternal Realm who had average strength.”

“Furthermore, he acted strangely while he was fighting. He could easily have won us, but he purposely held back his strength every time. He would use his sword formation to battle with us for a long time before defeating us.”

“Haha, he is using you guys to train his sword formation.” Zi Dong laughed.

“210 years ago, I told him that there were some flaws in his sword formation. Since then, he focused on improving it. When I was helping him to gauge his skills later on, I could feel an obvious improvement in his control of the sword formation. It was much more flexible than before. By now, he probably already has an ultimate control over it.”

“Hmph, I saw that too. When he was dealing with me, he deliberately suppressed the sword formation’s strength and speed by a lot. However, its flexibility improved tremendously.” The woman sighed, “By the way, Zi Dong, if Xuefeng continues to improve at this speed, do you think he can really pass the test on Level Three?”

“Of course he can.” Zi Dong nodded his head in certainty. “If I thought that it was possibly more than 200 years ago, then now I’m absolutely certain of it. It won’t be long before he leaves Star Island.”

“Are you so sure about it?” The woman was surprised.

“Just wait and see.” Zi Dong smiled but did not explain much.

While the woman was chit-chatting with Zi Dong in the backyard, at the Divine Yin Thunder Palace on Star Island something else was happening.

Jian Wushuang was in the middle of the black thunderbolt ocean. He had a stern and serious look on his face.

“We have reached the extreme.” Jian Wushuang held on tightly to his fists. A streak of light shone violently in his gaze.

More than 200 years ago, his World Body had situated in the Divine Yin Thunder palace, sucking in the black thunderbolts.

As that progressed, the Divine Yin Thunder in his body naturally became stronger. Besides, he no longer only had one Dao of it; he had 10 of them!

Each Dao of the black Divine Yin Thunder had accumulated the maximum thunderbolts. This meant that the Divine Yin Thunder had reached the peak of Level One!

One more step and he would reach Level Two!
