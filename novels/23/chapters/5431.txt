Chapter 5431 ¬†Slaughter

After the diminishment of the dog-headed stone statue, a barrier appeared in front of the main hall, accompanied by numerous inscriptions.

Each line of text was unique.

"Enter one by one?"

Finally, amidst countless lines of text, they discerned a form of ancient universal language.

The general meaning was that everyone needed to individually confront the stone statues; winners could enter, losers could not. tier 6 Emperors could enter directly.

No wonder the chest of the stone statue bore five characters; it was meant to stop tier 5 Emperors.

The onlookers exchanged glances, none daring to step forward voluntarily.

Turtle Spirit Island Lord cast a sidelong glance at Jian Wushuang, stating coldly, "Let your people try first!"

"Alright!"

Jian Wushuang had no grounds for objection.

He randomly selected a tier 5 peak Emperor to step forward for the trial.

As the tier 5 Emperor stepped into the barrier, both sides erupted without any hesitation.

Rip!

Spurt!

The tier 5 Emperor was torn apart directly, blood splattering on the spot.

People nodded in approval; the strength of the stone statue was moderate.

Tier 5 Emperors like Zhen Wuyang could enter, but for others, it was not so straightforward.

However, the tier 6 Emperors were still somewhat uneasy.

Although it was stated that tier 6 Emperors could enter, no one could guarantee the absence of danger.

This time, not only did Gui Ling gaze at Jian Wushuang, but even Situ Nan also cast a glance.

Helpless, Jian Wushuang could only say to Elder Zhi Shan, "Elder Zhi Shan, you go in first. Since it's said that tier 6 Emperors can enter, there should be no problem."

Then, he transmitted comforting words, "All for the sake of Lord Shen Ling."

"Understood!" Elder Zhi Shan's expression was resolute as he entered the barrier directly.

The stone statue hesitated for a moment, confirming that it didn't make a move against Elder Zhi Shan.

After about a breath's time, Zhi Shan's figure disappeared directly from the spot, indicating that he had entered.

Situ Nan and the others breathed a sigh of relief and began entering one by one.

Situ Nan, however, didn't rush in.

He first let his two tier 6 Emperor subordinates go in, then allowed Zhen Wuyang and the others to follow.

There was no intention to let the Gui Ling in.

"You!" Gui Ling was furious.

Situ Nan sneered, "Old turtle, why the hurry? I haven't gone in yet. Wait for these little guys to enter, and then I'll accompany you in."

Zhen Wuyang and the others, with their considerable strength, easily entered.

But for Gui Ling, it was challenging.

Among the Inheritors, even Wan Xing could enter.

When a tier 4 Emperor entered, the stone statue displayed a four-character phrase, much to the delight of Luo Chuan, the Fourth Prince of the Mo Luo Kingdom.

It was difficult for a tier 5 Emperor to enter, but for a tier 4 Emperor, it was relatively easier.

At the same time, Luo Chuan glanced at the Crown Prince Luo Sha with a disdainful smile.

Luo Sha had just recently broken through to the tier 5 Emperor, at most reaching the peak-level of the tier 5. He had no hope of entering.

Soon, all the Inheritors had entered, with Situ Nan being the last to go in.

He was afraid that the Island Lord of Turtle Spirit and the others would become anxious and try to breach the barrier.

Even if he didn't dare to kill the Inheritors, he could still block their way!

So, he stayed behind.

Glancing at Gui Ling, he directly stepped into the barrier and disappeared.

Gui Ling and the others couldn't wait any longer. Like dumplings being cooked, they all entered in a matter of moments.

Now, the only ones left outside were the tier 5 Emperors.

Jian Wushuang finally walked to the forefront.

At this moment, their side was the strongest on the field.

Under his command were a total of nine tier 5 cloaked Emperors.

On the side of Gui Ling, besides some Emperors from the Mo Luo Kingdom who stayed behind, there were also disciples of the Turtle Spirit Island and some subordinates of other tier 6 Emperors.

Jian Wushuang didn't dare to claim that he could slay them all, but taking down one like Luo Sha was not a difficult task, especially when he still held Gong Miaoyi in his hands.

He clenched his fist, and Gong Miaoyi, following behind Luo Sha, frowned.

"Kill him, or you'll die!" Jian Wushuang's concealed avatar within Gong Miaoyi silently transmitted the message.

"Kill him!"

"Kill him!"

However, Gong Miaoyi hesitated to make a move, and Jian Wushuang's avatar began to devour.

The deep pain that reached the Origin Source made cold sweat appear on Gong Miaoyi's forehead.

Among the present tier 5 Emperors, Luo Sha had a relatively high status, but he lacked confidence. He let others try first.

When he noticed something wrong with Gong Miaoyi, he turned to her and whispered, "What's going on?"

Gong Miaoyi revealed a slight smile, shook her head, and softly said, "Nothing!"

"Alright!"

But before Luo Sha could turn around, the Bloodfall Crystal in Gong Miaoyi's hand pierced through his chest.

Staring at the Bloodfall Crystal that appeared in his chest, Luo Sha tried to turn around.

However, Jian Wushuang had already appeared in front of him. With a single hand chop, unleashing a power of 40,000-fold divine body, he directly beheaded Luo Sha.

The divine body was shattered, leaving only the Origin Source. Jian Wushuang's body transformed into a faint black hole, directly devouring every trace of the Origin Source.

All of this was completed in the blink of an eye. When everyone reacted, nine tier 5 peak Emperors were already standing around Jian Wushuang.

Click, click.

The taste of the Origin Source was still as wonderful as ever.

These were trivial matters.

What mattered was the Candle Dragon Arm he had long dreamed of obtaining.

A segment of an arm, or perhaps a piece of armor.

Jian Wushuang gently placed it on his right arm, and a tremendous attractive force emanated from the Beast God's Origin Source.

Hum!

The Arm of Candle Dragon fused with Jian Wushuang's right arm, releasing a powerful aura.

His divine body soared once again.

A force that was beyond control surged through his right hand, causing veins to pop on his forehead.

Boom!

Jian Wushuang directly revealed his original appearance.

A fierce, pale face with white hair flowing.

Candle Dragon Wings spread open. ƒêiscover nùíÜw chaptùíÜrs ùíên n0ùíóe(l)biùíè(.)com

His right hand clenched slightly, he struggled to suppress the force.

The entire right arm turned dark red, with blood-colored claws capable of tearing through space.

This arm of his unilaterally increased the divine body to 50,000-fold.

The overall divine body, from 40,000-fold, broke through to 45,000-fold.

Too miraculous.

Suppressing his curiosity, Jian Wushuang looked around and directly charged at Luo Chuan.

The Fourth Prince, who was still astonished that Jian Wushuang had just killed his own elder brother, hadn't reacted yet.

He was directly crushed alive by Jian Wushuang's divine body, and his Origin Source was devoured by the huge suction in the palm.

The principles of a rabbit's death and a fox's grief were not understood; the dead had no complaints.

The remaining tier 5 Emperors on the field revealed expressions of fear.

After obtaining the Arm of Candle Dragon, Jian Wushuang's divine body skyrocketed, and his strength naturally increased significantly.

However, among these people, he still couldn't be considered the strongest.

"Rest assured, I only have a grudge against the Mo Luo Nation. You all can enter easily!" Jian Wushuang made a welcoming gesture.

Bukun, Broly's father, was somewhat incredulous. He stood behind Broly, holding him back and not allowing him to enter.
