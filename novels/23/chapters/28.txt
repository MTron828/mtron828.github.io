“Shui Hanxin, if it continues on like this, your dear disciple will be defeated,” said Bai Chong with a smile.

“They are still fighting, and the little guy called Jian Wushuang only has a small advantage. It is too early to say that my disciple will lose, right?” Shui Hanxin said with a complacent expression as if everything was already in the bag.

“Then continue to watch.” Bai Chong frowned and said nothing more.

In the arena, eye catching sword light flashed.

Jian Meng’er had successively performed many strikes using First-class Sword Arts of the Sword Pavilion, which were incredibly formidable. However, Jian Wushuang not only countered her attacks, he also countered them with superior sword moves in response.

The gap in swordsmanship was too large. Although Jian Meng’er had an absolute advantage when using her spiritual power, it was difficult to utilize this at the moment, as her strength could not be channeled through her attacks. Her arrogance and confidence were completely suppressed by Jian Wushuang.

“Two months ago, you said that you and I were from two different worlds and that there was an insurmountable gap between us!”

“You looked down on me. In your eyes, I was trash, a wretch that could not even gather spiritual power!”

“Just before the start of this duel, you said again that in this fight, you would let me face complete despair due to your absolutely dominant strength!”

“You have said so much and been so arrogant. But now, Jian Meng’er, is your strength only to this extent?

“Come at me with your strongest attack, or … could it be that with your current strength, you do not have the qualifications to deserve my attention!”

With eyes gleaming like lightning, Jian Wushuang stared at Jian Meng’er who was embarrassed by the pressure from his swordsmanship. These harsh words which were spoken echoed throughout the whole Drill Ground, causing an uproar in the entire Ground.

Jian Meng’er clenched her white teeth tightly, and she involuntarily looked at Shui Hanxin who was in the stand. She sensed her gaze on her and nodded toward her slightly. Jian Meng’er immediately understood Shui Hanxin’s plan through this signal.

“Jian Wushuang, I know that your gift in Sword Principles is unique, and I never thought of fighting with you based on swordsmanship. But today, I will let you know how big the world is, you … observe closely.” With a groan, an awe-inspiring righteous aura burst out of her body, while holding her sword in one hand with the sword tip pointed at Jian Wushuang. Strong and formidable sword essence spread out slowly.

The sword essence was extremely vigorous, grand and magnificent.

“This is … …” Bai Chong, who had been smiling in the stand, was surprised, and a hint of fright flashed in his eyes.

“Boundless Universe Sword Art, one of the four Ultimate Swords Arts of the Tianyuan Sword Sect.”Bai Chong looked at Shui Hanxin with gloomy countenance, and coldly said, “Shui Hanxin, did you teach her the Boundless Universe Sword Art?”

“Meng’er is my disciple. Is there anything wrong with teaching her this?”Shui Hanxin sneered.

The Boundless Universe Sword Art, as one of the four Ultimate Sword Arts of the Tianyuan Sword Sect, was an absolute peak tier First-class Sword Art. Compared to the Eighteen First-class Sword Arts of Sword Pavilion, it was quite a bit stronger.

It was because Jian Meng’er had cultivated this Boundless Heaven Sword Art, combined with her higher Spiritual Power cultivation compared to Jian Wushuang’s, that Shui Hanxin had absolute confidence in Jian Meng’er from beginning to end.

“This is Boundless Heaven Sword Art? There is no longer any suspense in this duel.”Situ Qingyue sighed at the side. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Winner, Jian Meng’er must be the winner. Her Cultivation of Spiritual Power is much higher than that of Jian Wushuang, together with this top tier First-class Sword Art, it is impossible for Jian Wushuang to defeat her, definitely impossible!” Ye Xiu said as well.

“Victory!”

“That little guy called Jian Wushuang will lose!”

There was a collective groan from the stands.

“Well done, Meng’er, excellent.” At this moment, Jian Lan was clasping his hands full of excitement. Hearing the comments that Jian Meng’er would win the duel coming from the famous experts next to him, he looked ecstatic.

Only Bai Chong, who stared at Shui Hanxin with a frosty gaze, coldly said, “Although Jian Meng’er is your disciple, after all, she has neither really entered into Tianyuan Sword Sect, nor had an entry ceremony, while you have already taught her the Boundless Heaven Sword Art without authorization. Although you are an Elder of Tianyuan Sword Sect, and it is normal for you to have some privileges. But… to want to win only by virtue of the Boundless Heaven Sword Art? I don’t think so.”

“Oh?” Shui Hanxin was surprised as she looked at Bai Chong, with a condescending expression.

Jian Meng’er is using the Boundless Heaven Sword Art. Could there be any suspense in this duel?

On the battlefield, the condition of Jian Meng’er had reached the peak at this moment. That vast sword essence was at an awe-inspiring stage. Such frightful sword essence indicated that the sword strike that was about to be displayed by Jian Meng’er would be world shaking in power.

“Such strong sword essence, I didn’t think that Jian Meng’er would have this much power.” The expression of Jian Wushuang was gloomy. “This sword essence is amazing. It is not from my Sword Marquis Mansion, so it seems that her Great Master taught her that.”

“Good, I guess that makes sense.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were hot.

“Jian Wushuang, take my strike. Remember, it is called Sword River!”Jian Meng’er said coldly.

“Sword River?”Jian Wushuang eyes were fiery, and strong battle intent rose up from his heart immediately.”Come on, let this attack determine the outcome!”

“It won’t let you down.”

The awe-inspiring aura from the body of Jian Meng’er had reached the ultimate limit. At this moment, she held the Triple-kill Sword with both hands together and raised the sword into the air. Heaven and earth seemed to pause for a moment, while the surroundings fell silent instantly.

“Go to hell!”

Finally, Jian Meng’er powerfully hacked down with her Long Sword.

Swoosh!

A bright and dazzling sword light burst forth, cutting through the air and leaving an eye catching Sword River flowing through the void.

Gorgeous and beautiful!

Anyone who saw this Sword River would be completely immersed and awestruck.

However, when the Sword River flowed towards Jian Wushuang, he suddenly closed his eyes and thought of many unexpected scenes. All these scenes were about the time he and Jian Meng’er spent over the last four years from day to night.

“Once, I dreamed that I could be with you forever. We would get married and even have children!”

“You were my closest partner, someone I truly loved!”

“I was willing to give you everything, even my life!”

“But now, this illusion has been broken.”

“The next sword will determine victory or defeat, as well as completely end the relationship between you and me. With this sword, I will tell you that…”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, with a flat and cold voice resounding through the sky.

“There are many people who are qualified to look down on me in this world, but you … are unworthy!”

Zip!

Ice-cold sword light flashed at once.
