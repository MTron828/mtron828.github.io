Chapter 2588: Soul Expert

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Qinhuo Wilderness was merely an ordinary wilderness within Northern Darkstar Territory.

In a huge ancient forest, there was a dense camp where two Official Army battalions soldiers and the experts from various sects gathered. They were waiting ever since receiving news that Jian Wushuang would be visiting in person.

It did not take long before three figures came from the distant void and arrived in the camp.

“Territorial Lord.”

“A pleasure to meet the Territorial Lord!”

The two commanders and sect masters saluted with a bow.

“Mo Shan, what’s the current situation?” Jian Wushuang looked at a middle-aged man who was burly like a hill.

As the Territorial Lord, Jian Wushuang usually kept in touch with the ten Official Army commanders and he knew all of them.

“Territorial Lord, the demon has been staying in the ancient forest in front for all this time,” said the middle-aged man called Mo Shan.

Jian Wushuang looked at the ancient forest in front of him. The ancient forest was so vast that one could not see the end with the naked eye. Jian Wushuang immediately frowned, “How can you be sure he’s still in the forest? There are exits everywhere around the forest, yet the Official Army and various sects experts are gathered in this camp. That person can leave at any time.”

“We can’t stop it if he can leave anytime as he wishes, but that is not the case. Territorial Lord, please come with me,” said Mo Shan.

Mo Shan led the way with Jian Wushuang trailing behind him.

The group of people soon arrived at a huge pit around the campsite and saw all the corpses in the pit that were kept in good condition without any scars on their surface while standing by the pothole. Jian Wushuang’s face sank.

Cang Heng’s and Xiao Tiexin’s complexion turned ugly next to Jian Wushuang.

There were just too many corpses in the pit!

There were nearly two hundred and judging from the remaining divine power on those two hundred corpses, the weakest was a Peak Divine Demon whereas the stronger ones were Primary-level Ultimate God. There were even two High-level Ultimate Gods among them—the sacrificed Official Army soldiers!

“So many Official Army soldiers are dead?” Cang Heng’s voice was low when he looked at Mo Shan. “You did not mention this when you sent me a message earlier.

“I knew we had lost quite a few people before this but I don’t have the specific numbers. That’s why I didn’t report to you. The situation here is indeed very urgent,” said Mo Shan.

“These corpses are kept intact with no traces of external scars. They grimaced in pain before their death and probably suffered painful tortures before death. If I’m not mistaken, these are soul attacks!”Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Mo Shan nodded. “Yes, it’s a soul attack. These men from the Official Army are not the only ones who died as there are also people in the cities who were massacred by the demon before including experts from Qinhuo Wilderness’s sects who died in the demon’s hands. Many of them had also not sustained any physical injuries, but had painful horrific expressions and died from soul attacks. The demon should be an expert who’s extremely good at very terrible soul attacks!

“It’s for certain that he’s currently well hidden in the ancient forest ahead. The reason he didn’t choose to leave is that...the two battalions can do anything to him at all. It’s him who’s preying upon us instead of us keeping an eye on him.”

Mo Shan trembled in helplessness upon saying that.

“Preying on the Official Army?” Cang Heng’s gaze turned cold.

“This seems to be the case.” Jian Wushuang stared carefully at the Official Army soldiers’ corpses in the pit and said with a low voice, “Let’s call the expert who’s good at soul attacks the Demon for the time being. He went around on a killing spree in the cities before killing the experts from Qinhuo Wilderness’s sects and the Official Army. During this process, his strength is constantly getting stronger at an amazing speed according to the information you previously reported.

“In addition to the painful expressions on these people when they died, I guess they weren’t attacked and killed by a soul attack but probably had their souls forcibly ripped or consumed.”

“Soul ripped or consumed?” The people’s faces around them changed upon hearing that.

“The Demon’s strength must be very strong if I’m not mistaken. It’s not as simple as it seems now. Something may have happened. Perhaps he’s severely injured in a fight or had to pay a huge price after using a secret technique and severely damaged his strength. He’s probably in an extremely weakened state and could only recover his strength by consuming these cultivators’ souls.

“His strength has gradually recovered as he consumed more soul, hence getting stronger and stronger. He no longer wanted to kill, absorb, and devour those weak cultivators’ soul power in the cities as his strength is restored. That’s probably why he focuses on those who have stronger soul power.

“Therefore, he gave up on ordinary city cultivators and started targeting the various sects’ experts. When the Official Army arrived, he switched his focus on them instead,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Is that so?”

All the people present were stunned.

“Mo Shan, you have fought against him before. How is his strength?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“When we confronted him head-on, his combat power had reached the rank of a Primary-level Ultimate God and was using very powerful techniques. We only managed to slightly suppress him when two battalions formed a military formation to fight against him,” said Mo Shan.

“As for his soul attack, we could not easily judge as his soul attack is of little significance to our military formation so he has never performed a soul attack on us. Those soldiers who were unfortunate to receive a soul attack from him were all dead.”

“If I’m not wrong, all of you fought against him before these soldiers died, right?” Jian Wushuang pointed to the many corpses in the pit.

Mo Shan nodded. “Yes. We had a fierce battle against him and suppressed him before he flees into the forest. It’s too difficult to find him as the forest was too vast while he was alone in there. The Official Army could only spread out and search for him but it turned out...”

“As a result, the soldiers were defeated and killed one by one with you losing quite a few soldiers? Jian Wushuang looked over.

“Yes, it’s too late when I finally realized and immediately asked the soldiers to get into military formations again. However, the Demon still managed to kill quite a number of us even though only less than half were separated.” Mo Shan blamed himself.
