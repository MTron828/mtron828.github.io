Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I managed to kill Fo Yi in the battle because of my various strong secret techniques. However, I’m far behind him when it comes down to understanding laws and principles. This is also my most urgent issue.”

“This second Fengtian Scroll had appeared just in time.” Jian Wushuang tightened his fists.

His strength could only rise in an unscrupulous manner with his understanding of laws and Sword Principle leading the way.

‘Let me start meditating on it!’ Jian Wushuang soon calmed down and started meditating with both Fengtian Scrolls.

Old Snake was leading the Divine Sword Army to take over all the territories Star Fort previously controlled as Jian Wushuang was meditating. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Some of the Star Fort’s upper management surrendered. On the other hand, those who did not were killed, hence the remaining people dared not fight back allowing the Sword Alliance to take over all of Star Fort’s territories with ease.

However, Star Fort was one of the top second-rated forces and quite famous in the Danyang Continent. The news about Fo Yi’s death and Star Fort being taken over shook the entire Danyang Continent.

Su Han’s name had also spread across the entire Danyang Continent.

Everybody soon learned about how Su Han had the combat prowess of a Grand Ultimate God despite being a mere peak Heaven Ultimate God. Apart from that, he even killed Star Fort Master Fo Yi.

Su Han was known as both a genius and devilish.

The name Su Han had gained a reputation across the Danyang Continent.

Apart from that, the Sword Alliance had gained the attention of various forces in the Danyang Continent as it had caused a sensation in that area.

The Sword Alliance was a strong force after all. They had spent a huge amount of resources to form the highly competitive Divine Sword Army on top of having taken over Star Fort and the addition of the Grand Ultimate God, Old Snake. There was a huge possibility for the Sword Alliance to become a first-rate force after taking over all the territories belonging to Star Fort.

Although there were many second-rated and third-rated forces on the Danyang Continent, there were not many first-rated forces.

At a huge hall of the Nanwu Palace.

A burly middle-aged man wearing a loose and luxurious robe sat on a throne with a serious expression on his face. His fingers were lightly tapping the armchair.

The burly middle-aged man was the Palace Master of the Nanwu Palace and also the publicly recognized first-ranked expert on Danyang Continent.

“Su Han of the Sword Alliance? I wonder where this Su Han came from as he has some useful methods. The Sword Alliance had only been formed for merely two to three years and they’re now turning into a first-rated force since they had already taken over Star Fort?” The burly middle-aged man had a cold expression on his face.

“Although the Sword Alliance developed so speedily, they’re still quite far away from becoming a first-rated force and aren’t a threat to my Nanwu Palace so there’s no need to bother them right now. What’s urgent to Nanwu Palace right now is still the Crimson Stone Fort...” The moment Crimson Stone Fort was mentioned the burly middle-aged man’s expression was not the only one turning cold, the expressions of the Nanwu Palace experts sitting at the bottom also had the same expression.

“The Crimson Stone Fort has been aloof for too long. Even though they’ve declined right now and aren’t as strong as they used to be, a starved camel is bigger than a horse. Our Nanwu Palace still can’t contend head-on with them.” The burly middle-aged man understood that fact clearly.

The Crimson Stone Fort was still very strong despite having declined.

The Crimson Stone Fort seemed helpless because they were made up of many factions with non-stop internal fights.

The fact remains that Crimson Stone Fort’s power at that moment was still much stronger than the Nanwu Palace.

“Our Nanwu Palace has a tactical understanding with the Divine Demon Sect, Life and Death Tower, and Dongfang Clan. What we need to do right now is to recuperate and build our strength. At the same time, we need to try our best to maintain the situation of the Danyang Continent so that the continent’s balance is kept. We shall then wait as the Crimson Stone Fort’s strength constantly weakens following their internal factions’ continuous fights. Based on the current situation, the Crimson Stone Fort will be weakened to an extremely low point within a couple of hundred years!”

“Our opportunity will arrive by then!” The Nanwu Palace experts’ facial expressions had also changed.

It was true that Nanwu Palace and the other top-rated forces hoped to see the Crimson Stone Fort continue their internal struggles as they had never been affected hence had been recuperating and building up their strength.

“Although the Sword Alliance is developing so speedily right now, they are still unable to affect the current situation or break the balance of Danyang Continent right now. Therefore, we don’t need to pay much attention to them. This Sword Alliance Master Su Han is really a terrific genius. We can send somebody to contact him and learn about his background and if it’s possible—ask him to join the Nanwu Palace,” ordered the burly middle-aged man.

“Yes, Palace Master.” The experts from the Nanwu Palace nodded solemnly.

...

In the Divine Demon Sect, their sect master was also standing in a grand hall.

“Sword Alliance?”

“They can’t be considered as a first-rate force at this moment so they aren’t qualified enough to get my attention. As long as this force doesn’t continue to cause any huge problems, there’s no need to pay much attention to them. Let’s directly destroy it when they threaten to destroy the Danyang Continent’s balance!”

...

Every power force on the Danyang Continent including those top forces had learned about the Sword Alliance’s existence and heard of Su Han’s name.

However, those top forces did not pay much attention to them.

The Danyang Continent was a huge piece of land and the situation was very complicated while there were also all sorts of forces.

It was very normal for forces to rise and fall. The force that was being taken over was only a second-rated force and not even considered first-rate, therefore it did not affect the entire situation in the Danyang Continent much.

It was almost impossible for Jian Wushuang to break Danyang Continent’s balance and caused the continent to enter into a complete mess solely with that incident.

All the top forces had not put much importance on him at that moment nor did they have the time to pay much attention to him.

However, that was what Jian Wushuang wanted.

At the same time, a thin elder suddenly opened his eyes in a dark hall.

“Fo Yi was killed by somebody?”

“The Sword Alliance’s...Su Han?” The thin elder had just received news about that but immediately frowned.

“The item that once belonged to Fo Yi will land into Su Han’s hand upon his death. I don’t think Su Han has any idea what that item is nor will he know about its uses, right?”

“That’ll be quite troublesome.” The thin elder was still deep in his thoughts when his expression suddenly changed as several messages were transmitted to him.

The thin elder took the Message Token out and glanced at it before smiling helplessly.

“Those elders really know how to divert their responsibilities away and directly pass this troublesome matter to me? However, what can I do when those people are much stronger than me?”

“Alright, I shall personally go and meet Alliance Master Su Han.” The thin elder soon made a move after softly sighing.
