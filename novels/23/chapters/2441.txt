Chapter 2442: Staying in Inner Area

“Target of all? What should we do?” Zhuo Bing panicked.

Jian Wushuang smiled lightly. “Well, it’s actually not that big of a deal. My abilities are obvious and also I have a Safety Token. How simple do they think killing me is? However, all of you would run into plenty of trouble because of me, so you’d better leave the inner area.”

“Leave the inner area?” Zhuo Bing and the rest were all stunned.

Jian Wushuang turned his wrist and took out two position tokens. “How about this? Out of those three position tokens, I’ll keep one. Big Sister will take one. As for the last one, Senior Brother Ling Dan, Senior Brother Zhong Yi, and Senior Sister Su Tong can make the arrangements.”

“Um...” Ling Dan, Zhong Yi, and Su Tong were slightly tempted.

They were filled with an eagerness for the position token.

However, they knew full well that those tokens were obtained by Jian Wushuang alone and he had borne a huge risk for that.

“Junior Sister Zhuo Bing already has one. I don’t need it,” said Ling Dan quickly and without any hesitation.

“Senior Brother Zhong Yi, I’ve gotten quite a few benefits in Saint’s Tomb this time around. I think you should take the position token,” said Su Tong.

Zhong Yi kept quiet for a while and nodded a little. “I shall take it then. Thank you, Junior Brother Wushuang!”

Jian Wushuang mildly smiled. “Temporarily leave the inner area with those tokens and hide out there for some time. You can return when the fighting and killings in the inner area are over, along with the Feng Tian Scroll opening up.”

In Saint’s Tomb, the outer area was much bigger than the inner area. If they left for the outer area, genius disciples from other sects would not be able to easily snatch their tokens. After all, it would be difficult to just locate their whereabouts. Every time Saint’s Tomb opened, a lot of geniuses who obtained those tokens would have chosen to hide in the outer area.

“Little Brother, if we’re going to the outer area, how about you? Aren’t you coming with us?” Zhuo Bing frowned.

Jian Wushuang shook his head. “I can’t go. Besides, it’s useless to go. Those sects’ geniuses could still easily locate me.”

“Why?” Zhuo Bing and the rest could not understand.

The outer area was a vast land. If Jian Wushuang hid there, would it not be impossible for those various sects’ genius disciples to find him?

However, Jian Wushuang smiled and explained, “Think about it, how did I manage to get all three position tokens at once?”

Jian Wushuang’s words surprised them.

It was only then that they remembered what they saw when Jian Wushuang obtained the three position tokens.

The three tokens had appeared in the most strange and mysterious fashion.

The inner area was so large and the six tokens were supposed to appear one by one at different corners. However, three of those tokens appeared in the same area.

The first token at least made sense as it was being pursued by everyone and fell into Zhuo Bing’s hand in the end.

However, the second and third tokens appeared simultaneously right next to Jian Wushuang, which was obvious that it was given directly to him.

If they were supposed to randomly appear, that coincidence did not make sense.

“Junior Brother Wushuang, do you mean ‘He’ has something to do with it?” Zhong Yi frowned hard.

Although he did not mention that person’s name, everyone knew he was referring to the owner of Saint’s Tomb, Crimson Stone Saint!

Although Crimson Stone Saint had long passed, his consciousness must have remained within the tomb in bits and pieces. Everything that happened in Saint’s Tomb was all within his control.

The strange appearance of the three position tokens could have only one explanation. Crimson Stone Saint did that on purpose!

He deliberately gave Jian Wushuang all three position tokens and made him the target for all, causing everyone to try and take it from him.

“Why? Why did Crimson Stone Saint want to do so?” Zhong Yi was puzzled.

“Who knows? Maybe he’s only interested in me alone or wants something from me. Whichever is the case, that old fart has really locked his sights on me. Under such conditions, it doesn’t matter where I go. As long as I’m still in Saint’s Tomb, I wouldn’t be able to escape his grasp. Those geniuses could also easily find me with his hints.”

If that’s the case, I’d rather just stay in the inner area instead of looking for a hideout and allow whatever needs to happen unfold,” said Jian Wushuang calmly.

“Forget it then, just be extra careful,” said Zhuo Bing.

What she could only do at the moment was to give a word or two of advice. Otherwise, there was nothing else she could have done to help.

“I will, all of you go ahead.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

Zhuo Bing and Zhong Yi quickly led the many disciples from Narcissus Island and Ancient Star Temple to leave for the outer area.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold once they were gone.

He looked around the void and coldly said, “Hey old fart, I don’t really know what you’re trying to do, but if you are trying to find out my abilities or my background using those sects’ geniuses, I’m afraid it’s not that easy.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice resonated outwards, but there was not a soul around.

It did not seem like anyone heard his words either.

However, Crimson Stone Saint could hear every word he said in the hidden isolated space. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“This kid’s pretty smart. He knows my intention. I’ll keep a close watch since that’s the case.”

Crimson Stone Saint smiled as his consciousness was completely locked-on to Jian Wushuang, watching his every move.

In other parts of Saint’s Tomb’s inner area, genius disciples from various sects were still waiting for the position token’s appearance.

While the frenzied fight for Jian Wushuang’s three position tokens was occurring, only one other token appeared elsewhere and fell into the hand of Great Compassion Sect’s Long Zishan after an intense battle.

On an open field, ten disciples from the Great Compassion Sect gathered. Their leader was the well-reputed Long Zishan.

“Senior Brother Zishan, you’re still better than the rest. You get the token as soon as you take action. Moreover, the other sects immediately stop when you get it. They dare not continue fighting you.”

“What’s with the empty words? Senior Brother Zishan is ranked three on the Twelve Minor Kings. Unless they want to die, how will those sects’ genius disciples have the guts to fight with him?”

A few Great Compassion Sect disciples were brown-nosing Long Zishan.

Long Zishan slightly smiled over their praises and felt a little proud inside.

What hilarity! Either his abilities as the three-ranked Twelve Minor Kings or his identity as a genius disciple from Great Compassion Sect would have allowed him to do as he wished in Saint’s Tomb.

Which disciples from regular sects dared to fight with him over the token?

Right at that moment, the Great Compassion Sect’s top genius—Tu Qiancheng—who was staying outside of Saint’s Tomb sent him a direct message.

Upon receiving the message, Long Zishan’s smiling face immediately froze while still sitting on the ground.
