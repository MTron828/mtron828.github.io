Chapter 1827: One Realm Pearl

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Buzz~~~

With Jian Wushuang using his powerful Divine Power, the Moon Picking Skill, the Ancient God Clan’s strongest Secret Skill was completely unleashed.

This Secret Skill was related to spacetime. Hence, the stronger one’s comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine was, the greater its power.

During the six thousand years’ time that Jian Wushuang travelled in the ancient battlefield, the area that he had made the greatest improvement in was the Spacetime Doctrine.

By unleashing this Secret Skill

The void shook fiercely. After that, rumble~~~ The void collapsed into pieces like paper.

Emperor God Fan Yuan and Emperor God Jin Ming still stood in the void. However, at that moment, both of them realized that the spacetime around them had undergone some slight changes. After that, they noticed that the whole universe, the whole vault of heaven and the whole spacetime had started to exert pressure on them crazily.

The pressure was too powerful.

It was powerful to the extent that the bodies of these two Emperor Gods were unable to move at all.

“I am unable to move?” Emperor God Jin Ming opened his eyes wide.

All of a sudden, Jian Wushuang, who was in the void in front of him, took a step out.

This step covered a distance of hundreds of thousands of miles instantly and he appeared in front of Emperor God Jin Ming. After that, Jian Wushuang swung his sword.

An ice-cold, merciless sword shadow expanded in the eyes of Emperor God Jin Ming continuously. Emperor God Jin Ming’s throat became dry and he wanted to resist with all his might at that moment. However, it was extremely difficult for him to move while under the pressure of the spacetime. As such, he was totally unable to keep up with the speed of the sword light.

Swish!

The sword light flew past and Emperor God Jin Ming’s head was sent flying immediately.

After that, the Blood Mountain Sword shook madly. It seemed to be jumping for joy and it also seemed to be extremely excited.

“Oh? It’s about to make a breakthrough?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He was the Blood Mountain Sword’s Master and he naturally understood the feelings of the Blood Mountain Sword the most.

The Blood Mountain Sword had always been an embryo sword and it could raise its power with endless massacre and training. Then, the reason why the Blood Mountain Sword was so delighted and excited was that it had already reached the edge of a breakthrough after killing Emperor God Jin Ming. With just another step, it would achieve the level of a Chaos Divine Treasure!

At this stage, it yearned to drink blood again.

“Haha. Little thing, don’t worry. I will let you kill until you are satisfied,” Jian Wushuang laughed heartily. After putting Emperor God Jin Ming’s treasures away into his Qian Kun Ring, he looked in the direction Emperor God Fan Yuan and murderous intent rose from him abruptly.

“Not good,” Emperor God Fan Yuan’s expression changed greatly.

No matter how frightened or stupid he was, he understood that Jian Wushuang already possessed the fighting capabilities of a Peak Emperor God and he killed Emperor God Jin Ming easily moments ago.

As such, Jian Wushuang also had the ability to kill him.

“Run!”

Emperor God Fan Yuan did not hesitate in the slightest. He had already struggled free of the Moon Picking Skill’s binding and he had also unleashed his speed completely.

“You wish to escape?”

Jian Wushuang laughed coldly. When he unleashed the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood, his speed skyrocketed at once.

He was already a Stage Three Ultimate Real God and he possessed a total of one hundred Ultimate Real God Water Droplets. Therefore, the amount of Divine Power that he had was a lot more than that of the Sir Gods and Emperor Gods. With such a vast amount of Divine Power, he was naturally not worried about running out of it.

“Jian Wushuang, your target is only Emperor God Jin Ming. Now that he has been killed by you, why is there a need for you to be so aggressive?” Emperor God Fan Yuan shouted loudly as he escaped.

“Haha, now you are scared. However, Emperor God Fan Yuan, this wasn’t what you said at the start.”

Jian Wushuang laughed coldly. However, his eyes were filled with an infinite amount of murderous intent, “Hmph, if you were someone who was hired by Emperor God Jin Ming to help him due to him paying you a huge price, I would have just let you off. However, you are an extremely good friend of Emperor God Jin Ming and since I have killed your good friend in front of you, how can you not hate me? Not hate the Lineage of Star? Rather than letting you find an opportunity to take revenge in the future, it would be better for me to get rid of you now.”

Jian Wushuang’s mind was as clear as a bright mirror.

The Lineage of Star was in danger and it was naturally good to not provoke experts if there was no need to. For example, back then, Jian Wushuang had spared Sir God Cang Yu.

However, Jian Wushuang had spared him as he knew that Sir God Cang Yu and the Purple Sky Palace behind him would not hate him after the matter. Instead, they would remember this favor of his.

However, it was completely different for Emperor God Fan Yuan.

Moreover, there was another factor and it was his Blood Mountain Sword yearning for blood. In particular, the blood of an expert.

Under such circumstances, Jian Wushuang had no reason to let Emperor God Fan Yuan off.

“Damn it. Who do you think you are? So what if your abilities are stronger than mine? Do you think that you can kill me?” Emperor God Fan Yuan laughed disdainfully.

He admitted that Jian Wushuang’s abilities were stronger than his. However, Jian Wushuang’s abilities would definitely not be so much more powerful than his own.

Moreover, he was still an Emperor God expert who was near the peak after all and his ability to stay alive was extremely shocking. Even among the peak Emperor Gods, there were probably very few of them who could kill him to the extent that they could be counted with fingers. As for Jian Wushuang, he absolutely did not believe that Jian Wushuang possessed the ability to do so.

Swoosh!

Emperor God Fan Yuan also unleashed a Secret Skill to escape and his speed was not slower than Jian Wushuang’s in the slightest. Instead, it was slightly faster. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Isn’t his speed a bit too fast?” Jian Wushuang revealed a surprised expression.

Even though he had unleashed the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood with his full power, he was still unable to catch up with Emperor God Fan Yuan?

“I said before that you would not be able to kill me,” Emperor God Fan Yuan’s voice, which was filled with ridicule, could be heard.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang raised the corners of his mouth. After that, with a flip of his palm, a purple pearl which emitted a peculiar aura appeared in his hands.

“What is that?” Emperor God Fan Yuan had always been careful toward Jian Wushuang. When he saw the purple pearl that Jian Wushuang had taken out, he realized and felt immediately that it was not good.

As for Jian Wushuang, he laughed apathetically, “Go!”

Buzz~~~

A vast amount of purple energy burst forth from the purple pearl. This purple energy then covered a range of millions of miles of void around the surrounding almost instantly.

Similarly, Emperor God Fan Yuan, who had been escaping madly, was also covered by the purple energy.

“This, this is a… formation?” Emperor God Fan Yuan’s expression changed greatly.

He could already tell that the millions of miles of distance that the purple energy had already formed a kind of giant formation and this formation had already covered him as well.

If he wanted to escape, he would need to destroy the formation completely.

However, would it be so easy to destroy this formation?

“I have said before that you would not be able to escape,” Jian Wushuang laughed coldly and he approached Emperor God Fan Yuan hastily.

While shrouded by the formation, Emperor God Fan Yuan was totally unable to escape and he could only force himself to fight a close-quarters battle with Jian Wushuang head-on.

However, the close-quarters battle only lasted for a short time.

“No!”

Emperor God Fan Yuan gave a shrill roar and his consciousness started to dissipate slowly.

Jian Wushuang stood in his position calmly. With a wave of his hands, the purple energy which covered a distance of millions of miles was gathered up at once and returned to the purple pearl.

“This One Realm Pearl is really useful.”

Jian Wushuang laughed.
