Chapter 2696: The Star Fort’s Fo Wu

“You’re really Shi Mo. This divine power alone is much stronger than any Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods.” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently as he could feel the striking strength Shi Mo had.

“However, this degree of power isn’t enough.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold. Boom~ A huge surge of golden divine power grew and immediately turned into an endless sea of golden divine power.

This golden divine power sea swept across and crazily impacted every direction.

The huge hall they were at directly shattered under the impact as the golden divine power sea continued to expand.

Shi Mo humphed coldly when he saw that before he unleashed a huge amount of grey aura following a humming sound.

Those grey auras were strands of lifeless auras—stagnant and spiritless.

It was the Death Law Shi Mo comprehended and mastered.

The grey strands of air engulfed their surroundings and crazily collided with Jian Wushuang’s golden divine power sea.

In a short time, they were stuck in a complete stalemate as there was nothing they could do to each other.

“Your understanding of Death Law is extremely high to be able to block my Golden Divine Power Sea and prevent the Golden Prison’s formation. How about this then?” Jian Wushuang scoffed before a majestic sword essence exploded with a slight movement of his thoughts.

The densely packed sword essence rushed straight into the skies and covered the entire territory in the blink of an eye.

Jian Wushuang had opened up his Perfect Sword World that erupted completely before covering an entire area of 100,000 miles.

Shi Mo immediately displayed his Principle World when he felt the shocking sword essence.

His Principle World was also of the Profound Achievement but at first contact...

Clatter~ Shi Mo’s Principle World was mercilessly crushed without any chance of struggling. In the blink of an eye, Shi Mo’s Principle World had crumbled from the suppression.

A huge suppression affected Shi Mo such that even his facial expression changed. “How’s that possible?”

He had no idea Jian Wushuang’s Sword World would be so strong.

“Both our Principle Worlds are of the Profound Achievement. My Principle World had been extended to at least fifty thousand miles, but there was no room for it to even struggle. Could his Principle World possibly have already extended to seventy thousand or even eighty thousand miles?” Shi Mo mumbled.

Shi Mo suffered a great suppression effect due to the complete collapse of his Principle World—causing his overall strength to be weakened.

The Death Law powers coming from him were also weakened. It was originally comparable to Jian Wushuang’s golden divine power sea and was in a stalemate. At that moment, he was steadily being defeated and looked like it was going to completely disperse—allowing Jian Wushuang’s Golden Prison to resume its formation once again.

All of a sudden... Boom!

Another Principle World exploded open.

That Principle World was much stronger than Shi Mo’s Principle World. It directly rolled open and crazily impacted Jian Wushuang’s Sword World without being at a disadvantage.

“Hmmm?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

The other party’s Principle World must have reached the complete level for it to fight against his perfect Profound Achievement Sword World!

Complete level Principle World was the realization of ordinary Grand Ultimate God.

“Who’s that?” Jian Wushuang immediately looked over at the source where the Principle World burst forth.

A middle-aged man in green robes who gave off an extremely holy aura as though being placed under the sunlight’s shower could be seen walking over slowly.

The middle-aged man had an extremely charming smile on his face that caused people to be captivated by it. Everybody present could not help but look over at him after his appearance.

“This person...” Jian Wushuang secretly relaxed after taking a look at that green-robed middle-aged man.

Jian Wushuang originally thought he was a Grand Ultimate God since he was capable of creating a complete level Principle World. There was a possibility a Grand Ultimate God from Star Fort was personally there.

What happened today would be slightly troublesome if that was the case.

However, that green-robed middle-aged man emitted divine powers at the Peak Heaven Ultimate God realm.

However, for his understanding of principle to be so high when he’s just a Peak Heaven Ultimate God only meant he would be extremely strong—much stronger compared to Shi Mo.

“Shi Mo, I originally thought you can resolve this on your own based on your capabilities. Who knew I still had to personally take action in the end.” The green-robed middle-aged man smiled indifferently as he spoke in his gentle yet prestigious voice.

“I don’t want this but Alliance Master Su Han is really strong,” said Shi Mo with a bitter smile.

The green-robed middle-aged man slowly walked toward Shi Mo before turning his gaze towards Jian Wushuang without any emotions in his eyes.

“Su Han, allow me to introduce the person standing beside me. He’s Fo Wu from Star Fort. I wonder if you’ve heard about him.” Shi Mo smiled coldly.

Jian Wushuang did not react when the name ‘Fo Wu’ was introduced.

However, Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master were surprised by it.

“Star Fort’s Fo Wu?”

“Heavenly Buddha, Fo Wu?”

A huge wave of emotions convulsed through their hearts.

The name Fo Wu was extremely well known in the entire Danyang Continent and both of them had heard about him.

Heavenly Buddha Fo Wu was the preeminent figure just second to the Star Fort Master. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Although he was only a Peak Heaven Ultimate God, it was rumored he managed to survive one or two moves even when met the ordinary Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods. Among the many Peak Heaven Ultimate God experts in the entire Danyang Continent, Fo Wu was good enough to be in the top ten!!

It had to be mentioned that the Danyang Continent had a vast territory with many forces having a Peak Heaven Ultimate God overseeing ordinary third-rated forces.

There were a huge number of Heaven Ultimate Gods in those forces and Fo Wu’s capability to be in the top ten among Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods was not something any normal person could achieve.

“Sh*t, the Corpse Palace invited Fo Wu over?”

“This Fo Wu is rumored to be capable of wiping out a group of ordinary Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods by himself. Even if Su Han is willing to work with the two of us, we’ll only be wiped out by Fo Wu.” Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master were at the brink of desperation.

They were still hopeful if only two Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods from Star Fort were sent there.

There was a possibility of them walking out of the Corpse Palace if ‘Su Han’ was sufficiently strong.

However, they could not see any hope at that moment with Fo Wu personally being there.

Fo Wu looked extremely composed even when he was being stared at by the crowd and condescendingly looked at Jian Wushuang. “You’re Su Han? I’ve previously heard about you from Shi Mo. It’s really rare for a High-level Heaven Ultimate God to have such power. I can ensure a good future for you if you’re willing to join our Star Fort.”
