Chapter 1458: Training

“This, this…”

Jian Wushuang stood there as he watched Wu Cang leave. He took a long time to calm himself down.

“Too strong!”

“His close combat power is too strong!”

Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

Really scary!

He thought that he had fought with many experts ever since he started cultivation and his close combat power wasn’t that weak either.

However, when he had fought with Wu Cang, the match was dominated by one side from the outset.

Wu Cang was the one with the strongest close combat power among all experts that he had fought before.

“Such a terrifying close combat power. Why wasn’t it emphasized in the information that Luo Meng gave?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

From Luo Meng’s information, the introduction about Wu Cang had described his strong close combat power but it didn’t say just how strong it was. However, from Jian Wushuang’s point of view, Wu Cang’s close combat power couldn’t just be described as “extremely strong”. It should be described as terrifying.

“Unless… Unless most of the experts in Sky Sword Prison are good at close combat!”

Jian Wushuang thought, “Oh, the people in Sky Sword Prison are always in a massacre. The massacre itself would increase one’s close combat power tremendously and the people here are imprisoned for very long. They’d figure out all the ways to increase their own power. They wouldn’t even let the least bit pass.”

“Close combat power is extremely useful during an actual fight. These experts definitely try their best to enhance their power. Naturally, all of them are good at it.”

Jian Wushuang understood.

If it were to be a cultivator from the outside world, when they reached a bottleneck and found it difficult to break through, most of them would look for a chance and opportunity to improve.

However, it was different in Sky Sword Prison. There wasn’t any chance or opportunity, only merciless massacre. Hence, once their power reached a bottleneck, they could only figure out ways to improve things that they could improve on. It also led to the scenario where most of the experts in Sky Sword Prison were very good at close combat.

Wu Cang, who had fought with Jian Wushuang earlier, his close combat power wasn’t at the top in Sky Sword Prison.

“In terms of power, Wu Cang and I are about the same. However, he relied on his close combat power to suppress me. Of course, that was because I didn’t perform any secret skills, nor use my Soul Power. Otherwise, he would be the one in a fix,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

His strongest fighting power was a flawless combination of Sword Principle and Soul Power. That was the true fighting power of one on Universe God ranking list.

He merely used his Sword Principle but he never used a Soul Attack. He had yet to even reveal his trump cards.

“The battle with Wu Cang reminded me that my close combat power isn’t strong. There are many experts in Sky Sword Prison and most of them are good at close combat. With me wandering here, I could train my swordsmanship with the experts and simultaneously train close combat power. After all, there aren’t many experts who would fight against me in the outside world.

“Plus, I have the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation with me. When I tried to comprehend it on my own blindly, the speed of improvement wasn’t fast. But if I were to kill and train while I comprehend, the effect would be much better compared to before.”

Jian Wushuang then revealed a smile.

In Sky Sword Prison, he saw the opportunity to train.

An opportunity that he had never had anywhere else.

Very soon, Jian Wushuang continued to wander in Sky Sword Prison. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

With the advantage of Soul Power, he wasn’t worried that he would encounter much danger. After all, if he ran into anyone above the second level, experts who he couldn’t provoke, he would avoid them. He could only fight with experts in Sky Sword Prison from the third or fourth level.

Jian Wushuang had no intention of fighting with a Real God in the third level either.

After all, even the weakest Real God in the third level, although they never once comprehended the Power of Heaven Way, their unique skill and secret skill were at a terrifying level. Even when their divine power was restrained, they weren’t easy targets. Jian Wushuang planned to only fight against these Real Gods after he became stronger or after he had created a Real God unique skill. By then, he would really achieve the result of training.

The time flew past.

When Jian Wushuang had first came to Sky Sword Prison, not many of them knew. However, as Jian Wushuang continued to wander and fought against experts in the third and fourth level, the experts in Sky Sword Prison gradually got to know his existence.

After all, although Sky Sword Prison couldn’t be connected to the outside world, the experts in the prison could still communicate with one another freely. The messages weren’t hindered.

After Jian Wushuang fought many times, he was listed in the third level by many people’s experts’ information collection. He was listed as intermediate in the third level.

Of course, Jian Wushuang wasn’t there to train his swordsmanship and close combat power. Hence, he hardly used his Soul Power. If he were to use his Soul Power, he would be on the top in the third level.

After the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang had stayed in Sky Sword Prison for a hundred and seventy years.

In the hundred and seventy years, Jian Wushuang fought with many Universe God experts of the third and fourth level. There were victories and defeats. His swordsmanship and close combat power increased tremendously through the vigorous fighting but it was a pity that he never once killed an expert in the hundred and seventy years.

It wasn’t because Jian Wushuang wasn’t capable enough. It was because the experts in Sky Sword Prison had impressive survival skills.

Even experts of the fourth level weren’t easy targets to be killed.

In Sky Sword Mountain, in the cave dwelling under the nine lofty sword mountains, the middle-aged-man sat. He was the owner of Sky Sword Mountain. He opened his eyes once again after a hundred and seventy years.

Then, he glanced at the Sky Sword Prison which was under his control. He could see Jian Wushuang in Sky Sword Prison clearly.

“Huh?”

The owner of Sky Sword Mountain lifted the corners of his lips and revealed a smile in disdain, “It has already been a hundred and seventy years, this young man from Lineage of Star had yet to kill even one Universe God in the Third Heaven. Hehe, Yuan said that this young man could kill a hundred Universe Gods in ten thousand years and leave Sky Sword Prison with his own ability. From the look of things, that is just a joke.”

The owner of Sky Sword Mountain closed his eyes again.

As he was at a high level, he was not bothered by the life or death of the prisoners in sky Sword Prison.

But then, it was because of Jian Wushuang that he would pay more attention to Sky Sword Prison. Otherwise, he wouldn’t bother to take a look at Sky Sword Prison even once in a timespan of tens of thousands of years.
