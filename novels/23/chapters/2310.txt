Chapter 2311 Taunting

“In terms of Sword Principle, I have the Sword Principle Xuan Luo that is capable of attacking and defending. In close combat fights, that would be sufficient. However, the Sword Principle Xuan Luo is too ordinary. Although it could eliminate my weaknesses, I won’t have much of an advantage either. Therefore, I have to create the most appropriate ultimate move for killing!”“The Spacetime Sword Principle and Reincarnation Sword Principle could perfectly infuse the Rules of Order. I can follow through with it to the very end.”

Jian Wushuang had plans for his own Sword Principles.

Long ago, when he was still in the Eternal Chaotic World, he had thought of taking the paths of Timespace Sword Principle and Reincarnation Sword Principle. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

However, he had barely gotten in touch with the Spacetime Doctrine and Reincarnation Doctrine and had not reached the level of the Rules of Order.

Although he had come out with several Sword Principles, they weren’t infused with the Rules of Order.

And now, Wu Yu had left those Sword Principles aside completely. Instead, he had combined Rules of Order with the Sword Principles perfectly in his creation.

When he had been in Eternal Chaotic World, he had made a breakthrough in Reincarnation Sword Principle and come out with Samsara.

Now that he was in Absolute Beginning Divine World, the birth of Snow Cleave gave him a foundation in Spacetime Sword Principle.

“Regardless if it was the Spacetime Sword Principle or the Reincarnation Sword Principle, I have created the first move. Moving ahead, it would be constant improvements together with the ordinary Sword Principle Xuan Luo. Only then could I really move towards perfection in my Sword Principle,” Jian Wushuang mumbled to himself.

“Moving ahead, I have to work harder.”

Jian Wushuang continued his silent sword cultivation in the Lin Mansion.

Time passed quickly.

Soon, Jian Wushuang was sixteen. He had been in the Lin Mansion for over three years.

In his room, Jian Wushuang sat on his bed with his legs crossed.

The sixteen-year-old Jian Wushuang no longer had the child-like features of his youth. Instead, he looked cooler and handsome.

As for his appearance, he had intentionally made himself look similar to how he had been in his previous life.

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes abruptly.

At that very moment, a dense and powerful Divine Power emanated from his body.

“Middle Stage Pure Sun Realm.”

“Just as expected, without a limitation on the realm, all I need is to accumulate Divine Power. This has made cultivation a lot quicker,” Jian Wushuang mumbled with a faint smile.

Pure Sun Realm was the equivalent of the Real God stage in the Eternal Chaotic World.

As for Middle Stage Pure Sun Realm, it was the same as the second stage of Real God, the Eternal Real God.

He wasn’t too far away from the Chaotic Realm.

Judging from this speed, in another four years or when I’m twenty, I should be able to reach the Chaotic Realm. Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

The Chaotic Realm still wasn’t his previous pinnacle.

Now that he had reincarnated as a Perfect Chaotic Lifeform, once he returned to the Chaotic Realm, his fighting power would be substantially stronger. Furthermore, once he reached the Chaotic Realm, he could also start cultivating some secret skills he knew in the Eternal Chaotic World.

He would also be qualified to start with the few secret skills that his master, Xuan Yi, had left in his mind.

At that time, he would likely stand at the top of the Anjiu Prefecture.

“No hurry. One step at a time.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. All of a sudden, he was alarmed. The extended soul power had detected people walking towards the room he was in.

Jian Wushuang walked out of the room instantly.

“Brother Wushuang.”

From afar, Jian Wushuang could see Lin Yan approaching. Lin Qingqing was following him.

Jian Wushuang could see a tinge of bloodlust gleaming in the eyes of Lin Yan.

“What happened? Why are you looking so furious?” asked Jian Wushuang.

In the three years that he had spent in Lin Mansion, Lin Yan had often paid him visits. After several encounters, they had become quite close. Although Jian Wushuang still didn’t see Lin Yan as a brother he could go through life and death with, he did see him as a friend. He was also the first friend he had made in Absolute Beginning Divine World since he reincarnated.

“Brother Wushuang, I would like to ask for your help,” Lin Yan said solemnly

“Help?” Jian Wushuang raised an eyebrow. “Speak. What happened?”

“It’s the Zhuge Family. They are here with their number one figure of the younger generation, Zhuge Hong. This guy constantly provoked the disciples of our Lin Mansion and even announced he wants to challenge every single one of the younger generation in Lin Mansion.”

Lin Yan was fuming as he spoke.

Jian Wushuang understood instantly.

A conflict within the younger generation.

Zhuge Family and Lin Family were both among the six elite families in Anjiu Prefecture. Moreover, they had always been sworn enemies. Conflicts were common throughout the year.

This wasn’t limited to just the higher management. Conflicts and fights between younger generation disciples were equally common.

However, going to the Lin Mansion directly to taunt was probably a little overboard.

“What’s the matter? Isn’t there anyone in the younger generation that is a match for Zhuge Hong?” asked Jian Wushuang.

Lin Yan’s expression changed a little and he answered, “Brother Wushuang, I’ll be frank here. Zhuge Hong isn’t ordinary. Not only is he exceptionally talented, he also entered the Dongzuo Sect at a young age as a core disciple. His master is a very powerful and frightening Chaotic Divine Demon that isn’t any weaker than the Commandery Governor of Anjiu Prefecture. Under the tutelage of his master and grooming of Dongzuo Sect, Zhuge Hong’s strength isn’t something that the disciples of our Lin Mansion can match.”

“Even though I wouldn’t like to admit it, I have to say I’m not just a notch weaker than him.”

“Since you can’t defeat him, just bear with him. Or perhaps you could ask the higher management of your Lin Mansion to teach that Zhuge Hong a lesson,” Jian Wushuang said nonchalantly.

In his previous lifetime, he had lived for close to 100,000 years in the Eternal Chaotic World.

He had seen far too many conflicts between families and even sects and were numbed to them.

Since the younger generation disciples weren’t a match, they could only bear with them. Finding help externally wouldn’t be a wise decision.

Jian Wushuang had no intention of being implicated in the long conflicts between the two families. This was because he wouldn’t be helping Lin Mansion. Rather, he would be doing harm.

If they couldn’t win, enduring was their only option. When they made improvements, they could find their pride. That was what big families should do.

“If Zhuge Hong was just taunting, we could just put up with him. However, he went over us over and over again. More importantly, he even humiliated Qingqing in the past!” Lin Yan gnashed his teeth as the bloodlust surrounding him intensified.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was taken aback. He took a glance at Lin Qingqing and saw she was looking extremely bitter.

“Brother Wushuang, Qingqing was only able to continue practicing the Hazy Sword Principle because of your guidance. Subsequently, Qingqing followed your instructions to have more trials in the outside world. However, Qingqing suffered a blow in a recent trial. She was severely injured and a Lin Mansion’s disciple that accompanied her even died.”

“At that time, the Lin Mansion’s disciple wanted to escape and look for help for Qingqing. Qingqing was severely injured then and that was the only option.”
