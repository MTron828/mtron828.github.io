Chapter 2341: Center of Attention

In the Lin Mansion, corpses were everywhere and blood stained the entire ground. In fact, even the sky was tinted a shade of red.

The pungent smell of blood was nauseating and filled every corner in the Lin Mansion.

The blood that was shed could have formed a river!

Luckily, the killings had stopped in the Lin Mansion.

At the top of a building, two Chaotic Realm experts from the Lin Mansion looked down at the surrounding scene. They couldn’t help but pale.

“Who would have thought that we would survive this time, and that our Lin Mansion would manage to stop the joint attack from the Zhuge Family and Xiang Family?”

“I couldn’t believe it either. When the Xiang Family showed up, I thought our Lin Family was over. Yet...”

Both of them remained silent but turned to face the same direction at the same time.

It wasn’t just the two of them. The various Lin Mansion’s experts that survived were all looking in the same direction.

In the air, a man was standing.

A young man who looked way younger than the rest and was carrying a sword.

He stood there coldly and the aura around him was kept in check perfectly. He didn’t say a word but the atmosphere froze.

Everything around him lost its lustre.

The entire Lin Mansion was shrouded in deathly silence.

If there was a sound, it was the trickle of fresh blood that was dripping off the longsword carried by the young man.

The crowd felt unprecedented shock and fear.

Shock because he had displayed a strength that didn’t match his age.

Fear because he had committed a massacre within that short period.

Everything had happened in a moment. Within two breaths of time, over forty experts from the Zhuge Family and Xiang Family had died in his hands. In comparison, the total number of experts from the Xiang Family and Zhuge Family that had died over the entire battle was only sixty!

Among those that were killed, two dead Chaotic Divine Demons were killed by that young man with the sword!

“He’s no different from the God of Death!”

A Half Step Divine Demon exclaimed. However, he shut his mouth for good immediately after.

The other experts from the Lin Mansion gasped in astonishment.

They knew Jian Wushuang.

It was also because they knew him that it was so hard for them to accept it.

They knew Jian Wushuang was just nineteen this year!

No matter how talented an ordinary cultivator was, it would be incredible to exchange blows with a Chaotic Realm.

What about Jian Wushuang?

Killing Peak Chaotic Realms was like killing chickens to him!

Killing Half Step Divine Demons was like slaughtering dogs to him!

He had even killed Chaotic Divine Demons!

How unbelievable was that?

“Senior Sister Huo.”

The two Half Step Divine Demons from Thunder Sound Sect gathered beside Fire Fairy. One of them wanted to say something but ended up keeping quiet.

“I know what you guys are thinking. I’m feeling the same way. It’s unbelievable!” Fire Fairy commented and felt unprecedentedly astonished by Jian Wushuang.

“Senior Sister Huo, you are more experienced and knowlegeable about the talented disciples in Thunder Sound Sect. Could the few most demon-like disciples in our Thunder Fire Sect be a match for him?” the person asked.

“Match him? What rights do our disciples have to compare with him?” Fire Fairy forced out a bitter smile. “He’s an Early Stage Chaotic Realm that has reached Great Achievement in Sword Principle, mastering Spacetime Rules of Order and Reincarnation Rules of Order. Moreover, his grasp is extremely profound. It is especially so regarding the Reincarnation Rules of Order. If I’m right, his understanding of Reincarnation Rules of Order could even match a First Grade Divine Demon’s. More importantly, he could easily kill a Chaotic Divine Demon when he’s just an Early Stage Chaotic Realm!!”

“Hehe! There won’t be a second unprecedented monster like him in the entire Wusha Barren Region, let alone our Thunder Sound Sect.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“His talents are just like his name suggests. Unparalleled in the world!”

“At the very least, no one in the Wusha Barren Region could be a match for his talents!”

Fire Fairy was extremely solemn as she spoke. Although this was just her appraisal of Jian Wushuang, she was certain she hadn’t exaggerate at all.

Within the Wusha Barren Region, it was impossible to find a second person that could be compared with Jian Wushuang.

Even in the greater Absolute Beginning Divine World, one might not find a similar monster to him, let alone in the Wusha Barren Region.

The two Half Step Divine Demons from Thunder Fire Sect gulped down their saliva upon hearing Fire Fairy. They couldn’t keep their composure any longer.

Center of attention!

Jian Wushuang was undoubtedly the focus of everyone.

However, he looked extremely calm before the watchful eyes of the crowd.

He had killed lots of people in this battle. One could even say he had started a massacre. However, the number of people he had killed over close to a hundred thousand years in his previous life easily dwarfed his kills today.

A massacre like this was nothing and wouldn’t affect his emotions at all.

With this, the battle had concluded. He was still looking icy cold and remained exceptionally calm. He put away his Blood Mountain Sword in his Qian Kun Ring before looking for his father and went towards him.

“Father.”

Jian Wushuang looked at Zhuo Yunfeng and extended his soul power. He realized Zhuo Yunfeng had only suffered light injuries and wouldn’t be in any danger. It was then that he felt relieved.

As for Zhuo Yunfeng, he was staring blankly at Jian Wushuang.

He was feeling a myriad of emotions.

There was fear, ecstasy, and disbelief.

Was this young man before him really his son?

Killing Peak Chaotic Realm and Half Step Divine Demons like he was slaughtering chickens and dogs? Was this young man who killed two powerful Chaotic Divine Demons really his son?

Since when had his son grown to be so powerful?

“Father, if you are alright, let’s head for the Purple Virtue Hall first. Mother should be feeling really anxious now,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Yeah, you are right.” It was then that Zhuo Yunfeng reacted. “Let’s go. We will look for your mother at Purple Virtue Hall first.”

Upon finishing his words, Zhuo Yunfeng and Jian Wushuang headed towards Purple Virtue Hall.

“Brother Zhuo, Wushuang...” In his tone, that was slight fear and respect. The one who spoke was none other than the family head of the Lin Family, Lin Tiefeng.

Lin Tiefeng was an elite Third Grade Divine Demon. However, even he was astounded by the strength Jian Wushuang had shown.

“Uncle Lin, we are going to see my mother at Purple Virtue Hall first. Let’s talk in detail later,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Alright. You should.” Lin Tiefeng nodded and wouldn’t interfere.

Jian Wushuang and Zhuo Yunfeng left the place. However, those that were part of the intense battle previously were still feeling stupefied. They couldn’t react fully to the situation.
