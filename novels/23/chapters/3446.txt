Chapter 3451 Divine Moon Palace

“Clan leader Blood Marten, tell me.” Jian Wushuang knocked on the armchair casually.

“Celestial Marquis, to tell you the truth, the Blood Marten Clan arranged the marriage between my daughter and Chi Hu so that the Blood Marten Clan and the Scarlet Gold Clan could get closer through marriage. This way, we can have more confidence when we face the blood clan,” Er Xiu said.

“Blood Clan?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. “What does the marriage between you and the Scarlet Gold Clan have to do with the blood clan?”

“Mr. Heavenly Marquis, you may not know this, but although the Blood Marten Clan has always been a top clan in the demon region, in fact, our clan only had a period of glory when the ancestor was still alive. After the ancestor went to the universe battlefield, our clan gradually declined. Although we are still a top clan now, we are already at the bottom of the top clans!” “Many other races also secretly said that the Blood Marten Clan was not worthy of its name and no longer had the strength of a top race. In addition, the Heavenly Sword Marquis may also know that the competition between many races in the demon region has always been very cruel, and our Blood Marten Clan has been fighting with many races all year round!”

“Now that our Blood Marten Clan is under-estimated, our overall strength has already pulled away from many other top races. Naturally…many races want to replace our Blood Marten Clan, and there are even races that want to directly annex our Blood Marten Clan.”

“Are you saying that the clans that want to annex your Blood Marten Clan are the blood clan?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes.” Er Xiu nodded heavily. “Among the many top clans in the demon region, even if some of them have designs on the Blood Marten Clan, they would at most occupy the territory resources of the Blood Marten Clan. However, they would never want to annex or exterminate the Blood Marten Clan. After all, the Blood Marten Clan has had its glory. A camel that is about to die is bigger than a horse. In addition, there is the sect-protecting formation set up by the ancestor. The top clans in the demon region would not dare to truly fight with the Blood Marten Clan. However, the blood clan is different!”

“Blood clan, you are one of the four great divine clans. Your foundation and strength are far beyond that of the Blood Marten Clan. Even when the Blood Marten Clan was at its peak, we were still inferior to the blood clan when the ancestor was around, let alone now!”

“There is no doubt that the blood clan has the ability to directly devour and annihilate the Blood Marten Clan. From the actions of the blood clan over the years, it seems that the blood clan does have such a thought. It’s just that they are worried about the other divine clan, the Nine-tailed Clan, in the nearby territory. That’s why they haven’t made a move

yet.”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The most powerful clans around the Piahuo City were not only the Scarlet Gold Clan and the Blood Marten Clan, but also the even more terrifying Nine-tailed Clan.

As for the blood clan, they were still some distance away from this territory. If the blood clan took action against the Blood Marten Clan, it would be equivalent to encroaching on the territory near the Nine-tailed Clan. Of course, the Nine-tailed Clan would not sit idly by.

“Since the Nine-tailed Clan is keeping the balance, what do you need to worry about?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I didn’t worry about it before, but over the years, the Nine-tailed Clan has also encountered some troubles,” Er Xiu said.

“Oh, what troubles?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s a newly-risen clan. To be exact, it’s a newly-risen force,” Er Xiu said.

“Power?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

“Yes, it’s called Divine Moon Palace. It was founded hundreds of years ago. At first, it was very low-key and didn’t attract much attention. But in just a few hundred years, it has developed into a map that even the Nine-tailed Clan wouldn’t dare to underestimate. Especially 30 years ago, Divine Moon Palace even annexed the Howling Demon Clan and made the entire clan submit to it,” Er Xiu said.

“The Roaring Demon Clan?” Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted.

Among the many clans in the demon region, he knew not only the four great divine clans but also a few powerful top clans. The Roaring Demon Clan was undoubtedly an extremely powerful top clan, although there were no experts of the sixth void realm in the clan, it was said that there were two experts at the peak of the fifth void realm and many powerful Principles Masters.

In terms of overall strength, the Roaring Demon Clan was much stronger than the Blood Marten Clan, even stronger than the Scarlet Gold Clan.

How could such a top clan be annexed by the Divine Moon Palace, which had been established for only a few hundred years?

The Divine Moon Palace had amazing methods!

“What’s next?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“After the Divine Moon Palace annexed the Roaring Demon Clan, its overall strength skyrocketed. It has become a force above all the top clans, and it is qualified to threaten the status of the four great divine clans. As the only divine clan in this territory, the Nine-tailed Clan also sensed the threat, so they wanted to suppress the Divine Moon Palace. Unexpectedly, the Divine Moon Palace directly fought with the Nine-tailed Clan!” Er Xiu exclaimed.

“The Divine Moon Palace is not fighting indirectly, but directly. It can even be said to be a direct declaration of war. The nine-tailed race will naturally not be outdone. Therefore, the nine-tailed race and the Divine Moon Palace have been fighting fiercely all these years. Although the nine-tailed race has the upper hand, they do not have an absolute advantage. Instead, the Divine Moon Palace has been recruiting experts everywhere all these years. As their strength grows, the threat they pose to the nine-tailed race also grows!”

“At this time, the Nine-tailed Clan has put all their attention on Divine Moon Palace, so they have no time to care about the fights between the other clans. Therefore, they have given the blood clan an opportunity. Not long ago, experts from the blood clan came here one after another and even fought with the Blood Marten Clan.”

“Is that why you want to recruit the Scarlet Gold Clan to fight against the blood clan through marriage?” Jian Wushuang looked at Er Xiu.

“Yes, the Blood Marten Clan is not the only one who has noticed the blood clan’s intention. The Scarlet Gold Clan has also noticed it. We have a tacit understanding with each other in this marriage alliance. Now that the marriage alliance has been formed, it’s suitable for the two top clans to fight against the blood clan together. With the combined strength of the Blood Marten Clan and the Scarlet Gold Clan, as long as the blood clan doesn’t come out in full force, we’ll be able to protect ourselves,” Er Xiu said.

“After you proposed the marriage, I also thought about giving up the marriage with the Scarlet Gold Clan and choosing you, but you are a human cultivator and don’t stay in the demon region all year round. If something happens to the Blood Marten Clan, you won’t be able to come in time.”

“Secondly, although you are very talented and have great potential, your current strength…” Before Er Xiu finished his words, Jian Wushuang had completely understood.
