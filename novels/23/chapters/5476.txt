Chapter 5475 ¬†Rescued by Someone

Without waiting for Jian Wushuang to react, the other party had already disappeared.

The implication of these words was quite clear; the other party was no ordinary person.

"Divine General Moyin?" Jian Wushuang shook his head; it didn't seem likely!

Of the three who entered this place, Wanyan and Dongsheng might not be in this city, and these two wouldn't pretend to be superior in front of him.

Since they all reached this place, they should be like him‚Äîmere mortals.

It wasn't Dongsheng, Wanyan, or the Divine General Moyin. It seemed that there were others in this place, perhaps not human, but rather a consciousness left behind by the being who created this place.

Although he didn't know who the other party was, Jian Wushuang couldn't stand that tone.

It wasn't that he, as a rebel, couldn't stand being lectured by others. Mainly, was this trial necessary?

Does enduring suffering really make one stronger?

It could only be said that the creator of this place had a limited perspective.

"I'll survive. Today, I won't starve to death here. Let's see what you can do!" Jian Wushuang resolved silently. He refused to believe that he would perish of hunger in this place.

Even if Divine General Moyin didn't intervene, Zhen Ling would save him once he learned of it.

A future Ultimate Dao Lord, a peerless genius with the potential to ascend, dying of hunger in the mundane world‚Äîwhat kind of absurdity was that?

Plop!

Jian Wushuang found a threshold that looked comfortable and flopped down on it, limbs splayed in all directions.

"This will do, dying here wouldn't be so bad!" Jian Wushuang self-mockingly remarked, then suddenly, a wave of hunger struck.

Enduring the hunger, Jian Wushuang sank into a deep sleep.

As twilight descended, in the dim alley, the cold wind howled, and Jian Wushuang couldn't bear it, so he curled up.

Whether it was instinct or his consciousness not being firm enough, he shrank back.

Huff!

Jian Wushuang abruptly sat up.

Was his consciousness not firm enough?

Even though he had become a mortal, his consciousness was still intact!

Why did he hesitate?

With this thought, he stretched half of his body back onto the street.

Woo!

"Unbelievable!" Jian Wushuang shrank back, unwilling in his heart.

When he fell asleep again, his body curled into a ball, instinctively tidying up his clothes and wrapping himself completely.

Although his stomach kept growling, Jian Wushuang slept soundly. Perhaps because he hadn't slept for three days, he fell into a deep slumber.

At some unknown point, Jian Wushuang felt his mouth dry, his throat as if burning with fire, and a pungent smell reaching him.

A liquid flowed down his throat, and a hiccup woke him up abruptly.

Cough, cough!

Jian Wushuang coughed violently, weakly opening his eyes.

Everything before his eyes had changed.

Thinking he had returned to reality, he noticed the dirty and tattered clothes on his body, realizing he was still a beggar.

Turning his head to survey his surroundings, he found himself in a simple yet cozy room.

"You're quite lucky. You didn't freeze to death in the snowdrifts!" a woman's voice echoed.

Jian Wushuang struggled to lift his head and saw a young woman behind him. Her face was heavily adorned with rouge, but her features were still delicate.

Jian Wushuang's voice was weary. He wasn't thinking much at the moment; he just wanted a sip of water. Before he could speak, the woman twisted her waist and handed him a bowl of water.

Gulp!

He lifted the bowl and gulped it down, feeling refreshed and invigorated. It was the best-tasting water he had ever had, surpassing even the genius earth treasures he had encountered.

Seeing Jian Wushuang catch his breath, the woman asked with an unfriendly tone, "You filthy beggar, what's your name?"

Taking a breath, Jian Wushuang, with both hands supporting his body, leaned against the soft bed. He looked at the woman with a hint of hostility and replied coldly, "You're not worthy."

"Hey, you stinky beggar! I saved your life, and this is how you talk to me? Believe it or not, I'll throw you out to feed the dogs!" The woman with heavy makeup threatened fiercely.

Jian Wushuang paid her no mind. He had finally realized that he was afraid of death‚Äînot exactly fear, but an intense instinctive desire to survive, preventing him from willingly embracing death.

"You shouldn't have saved me," Jian Wushuang's voice softened.

If she hadn't intervened, he would have frozen to death tonight.

Now, having shaken off the chill from his body, lying in the warm bed, he actually felt like dying. He did not even want to move.

The dusty woman, who was initially somewhat angry, sighed and complained after hearing Jian Wushuang's words, "Men, every one of you is trouble! You should all freeze to death on the streets."

"I'm Jian Wushuang, and you?" he asked.

"You can call me Thirteen Niang!" UpdùíÇted chapters ùíên nùíêvelbin(.)com

The two exchanged names, a form of acquaintance.

Subsequently, they chatted about this and that. Jian Wushuang, having emerged from the mundane world, wasn't completely ignorant. He quickly learned about the city of Qingshan and the peculiar Thirteen Niang.

Her background wasn't favorable; her parents passed away when she was young, and her own uncle sold her to a brothel called the Cui Xiang Building on the west side of the city. This marked her entry into the world of dust.

This courtyard used to be her home, and after earning money in the brothel, she bought it. Normally, she wouldn't return, but today, she happened to be here due to something she shouldn't have come across, taking a break and encountering Jian Wushuang.

Fate is unpredictable, and it was such a coincidence that she saved Jian Wushuang, who was on the verge of freezing to death.

"What did you just give me to drink?" Jian Wushuang curiously asked.

Thirteen Niang was momentarily stunned, then replied, "Of course, it's the wine. Without that sip of wine, you would have frozen to death long ago."

"Well, is there anything else?" Jian Wushuang swallowed a mouthful of saliva, his stomach also betraying him with a growl.

"You, on the surface, look like a beggar, but your speech doesn't quite match. You seem more like a scholar who somehow ended up in this state!" Thirteen Niang casually handed the wine jug on the table to Jian Wushuang, and she also tossed a roasted sweet potato his way.

Jian Wushuang gulped down a mouthful of rough and strong liquor, picked up the somewhat hot sweet potato, and began to munch on it. After hearing Thirteen Niang's words, he mumbled, "You've got a good eye!"

He wasn't really a beggar before. If he revealed his previous identity, the other person would probably think he had gone crazy.

In this mundane world, there was no concept of cultivators.

With the sweet potato in his belly, he finally subdued the annoying little demon in his stomach.

Having his belly filled and lying on a warm bed, Jian Wushuang felt incredibly content. Recalling the mutton stew from the day, he couldn't help smacking his lips.

"Come on, tell me. Looking at your face, you don't seem like a child from a poor family. How did you end up like this today?" Thirteen Niang was quite curious; once a woman's gossip fire was lit, it wouldn't easily be extinguished.

Jian Wushuang hugged his head with both hands, gazing at the ceiling beams, and muttered to himself, "Well, it's hard to say."

Should he talk about the matters of Qishen Temple?

It was too unbelievable‚Äîintroducing Qishen Temple to a mortal was like talking about celestial scriptures.

Talking about things in the mundane world, it had to be from his own experiences, and indeed, he had some stories to tell.
