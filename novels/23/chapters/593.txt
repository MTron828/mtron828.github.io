Chapter 594: The Last Test!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“It’s been many years since we met last. How are you?” Jian Wushuang asked in a toneless voice.

“Jian Wushuang, it hasn’t been that long. You’re already back from the Divine Land?” Jin Ling responded with a hint of surprise.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

He had not only returned from the Divine Land, he had even traveled to the Monster Continent.

“I come to take the third test,” Jian Wushuang said.

There were three tests in the Ancestor’s Land and he had passed the second test before he left the Nanyang Continent, so only the third test remained.

“The third test is difficult, but looking at you, you’re pretty confident, right?” Jin Ling stared at Jian Wushuang curiously.

A little bit. Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. He was now even stronger than Sword Ancestor, who had been at his peak.

Therefore, he was capable of passing all the tests Sword Ancestor left.

“Follow me.”

Jin Ling and Mu Shan led the way, quickly arriving at the deepest part of the Ancestor’s Land.

A fathomless long tunnel appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, with a lilac Restriction covering its entrance.

This Restriction was extraordinarily powerful. Anyone that wanted to enter the tunnel had to break it.

“This tunnel is connected to the real core of the Ancestor’s Land, where Sword Ancestor left his things.” Jin Ling said, “As for the third test, it should be this Restriction, but I’m not sure about it. After all, Mu Shan and I are unable to enter this tunnel, so we don’t know if there are other tests inside.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang frowned as he looked over at the lilac Restriction.

He started to approach it.

“Jian Wushuang, this Restriction is quite powerful. It has an amazing defensive and offensive power. You should be careful.” Jin Ling, who was still in the process of speaking, was suddenly stunned.

Mu Shan was also petrified.

They watched as Jian Wushuang casually punched the Restriction.

As for the result, the powerful Restriction instantly collapsed in front of their eyes.

He smashed the Restriction with a casual punch.

“Is, is it really that easy?” Both Jin Ling and Mu Shan cried in shock.

As far as they knew, if an expert wanted to break the Restriction, he had to at least reach the sovereign level.

Sovereigns were supreme experts in the Divine Land.

Jian Wushuang must be stronger than a sovereign since he broke the Restriction with a single punch.

“It’s amazing for Jian Wushuang to have made such rapid progress in such a short period of time. So fast!” Jin Ling could not hold back her surprise.

When he initially arrived here, Jian Wushuang was so weak that he was not even qualified to do the first test.

Now, after a dozen years had passed, his strength had reached an incredible level!

“The third test is a piece of cake,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

He had narrowly escaped death when he was taking the first and second test. However, it was too easy for him to pass the third test.

“What will you do, wait for me or go inside with me?” Jian Wushuang turned to look at the two Puppet Fighters.

“We’ll stay here and wait for you,” Jin Ling replied.

Jian Wushuang shrugged his shoulders and walked inside.

The dark tunnel was not long, so it wasn’t long before a shabby secret chamber came into view.

Jian Wushuang stepped into the secret chamber and immediately saw two tokens on the table in the front of the chamber.

Other than the two tokens, there was nothing in there.

Jian Wushuang approached while observing the tokens. The first one was a gold token which radiated magic power in waves. It looked very mysterious in his eyes.

Two gilded words were carved on it: Ancient World.

“The Ancient World Token!”

Jian Wushuang immediately understood.

Emperor Xiao had said that the Sword Ancestor had prepared an Ancient World Token for him. It should be this one.

“This is the Ancient World Token?”

Jian Wushuang picked up the gold token and studied it for a while, but he could not figure it out. All he knew was that the power surrounding the token was similar to space waves.

“Countless Skyscraping Realm experts all desire this Ancient World Token.” Jian Wushuang sighed while shaking his head.

Because of it, the Sword Ancestor had been hunted by so many Skyscraping Realm experts and eventually died. Now, Jian Wushuang had received this Ancient World Token that the Sword Ancestor left. It could be said that the Sword Ancestor sacrificed himself to give the young man an opportunity.

Jian Wushuang put this Ancient World Token into his Interspatial Ring and then looked at the second token.

It was an ordinary Message Token.

Jian Wushuang smashed it and a message came out.

“I’m Jian Chen!”

Jian Wushuang was a bit surprised, but he immediately realized that this token contained some information Sword Ancestor left.

Jian Wushuang began listening carefully.

“I was born aloof and proud, so I would rather die than surrender to my enemies. I accidentally received an Ancient World Token, but the news leaked out, causing numerous Skyscraping Realm experts to chase...”

“Haha, they wanted me to hand over the Ancient World Token. However, I’d rather die or destroy the Ancient World Token than give it to them!”

Sword Ancestor told his story and left several words for his descendants.

“He really was quite stubborn!” Jian Wushuang said to himself.

Sword Ancestor mentioned that he was too obstinate. Even when he was seriously injured and unable to fight back against the numerous Skyscraping Realm experts, he would rather destroy the Ancient World Token than hand it over.

As a result, he was killed by those Skyscraping Realm experts.

If he had not been so stubborn, he would not have been killed.

“That’s his nature.” Jian Wushuang sighed as he shook his head.

“Sword Ancestor, don’t worry. As for those people who murdered you, I’ll kill them all.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, slightly bowed to space in front of him, and then left.
