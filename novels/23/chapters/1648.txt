1649 The Eighth Lair

“Jian Wushuang has too much potential and it would be great if we could kill him in time. However, if we are unable to kill him, he will become trouble for us in the future!”

“Moreover, there is still the Lineage of Star supporting him!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Hence, fighting such a genius with such talents to the death for the sake of prestige is indeed not worth it.”

The Four Symbol Mansion Master’s voice was so loud that it shook the heavens. He then took out a transmission token straight away and sent a message.

In no time, he got a reply.

After getting a reply, the Four Symbol Mansion Master nodded his head and looked around, “I have already negotiated with the Lineage of Star. From today on, the Four Symbol Mansion and the Lineage of Star, as well as Jian Wushuang, will keep out of each other’s affairs. There is no need for the Four Symbol Mansion to find trouble for him, and he also does not have a reason to deal with us of his own accord.”

“Mansion Master is wise,” Real God Chi Huo shouted at once.

The other experts within the palace also nodded their heads.

…

At the peak of a lofty mountain in the Thunderbolt Island.

“Jian Wushuang has cleared the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace?”

When the Monster King got wind of the news, his face turned hideous immediately and his eyes were filled with an unprecedented murderous intent.

“This little kid…”

The Monster King clenched his fists tightly and he took out a token at the next moment.

“Jian Wushuang has already cleared the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace. His speed of improvement is too fast and we will need to find a way to get rid of him immediately. If not… he will definitely cause huge trouble for us in the future.”

“Moreover, we should not drag this on for too long. The longer we drag it on for, the stronger his abilities will be.”

…

Just as everyone was talking about Jian Wushuang, no one knew that he had already left the Thunderbolt Island.

Within the black void, an ancient spaceship which came from the outside world was moving forward slowly.

Within the spaceship sat Jian Wushuang and he was communicating with Hall Master Yuan.

“Jian Wushuang, the Four Symbol Mansion Master has sent me a message personally. Although, he did not say it bluntly, he managed to get his message across, saying that he no longer wishes to be enemies with the Lineage of Star or you,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was surprised, “In any case, the Four Symbol Mansion is an overlord of the Ten Sanctuaries. Moreover, I have killed tens of their Real Gods. However, they actually let me off so easily?”

“Haha. Of course they do not wish to let you off. However, they had no choice. After all, the talents and potential that you revealed were too shocking and it caused the Four Symbol Mansion to be extremely fearful. When facing you, they had two choices. They would fight you to death and there is a possibility that you might die. Next, it might also be possible for you to grow and, in the future, you might destroy the Four Symbol Mansion.”

“In addition, you must know that only tens of Void Real Gods died and this was considered nothing to the Four Symbol Mansion, apart from damage to their prestige. In order to kill you for prestige, they would risk getting the Four Symbol Mansion completely destroyed in the future. Hence, which choice do you think they would pick?” Hall Master Yuan laughed.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang could not help but laugh.

In the end, abilities were equal to respect.

The talents and potential that Jian Wushuang had displayed had already caused the Four Symbol Mansion to feel fearful. Hence, the Four Symbol Mansion would rather suffer losses than continue fighting with Jian Wushuang. As such, they chose to make up with the Lineage of Star.

“Oh right. Hall Master Huan, have you prepared the item that I want?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

“I have finished preparations for it and I will send it over to you later. However, Jian Wushuang, do you really wish to travel in that place? That place is extremely dangerous,” Hall Master Yuan questioned.

“Of course I know that there is a great amount of danger. However, an Inverse Cultivator can only grow when faced with difficult situations. Training that is too easy and will only waste my talents.” Jian Wushuang laughed: “Moreover, my current abilities are probably high enough for me to travel there.”

“Since you have made up your mind, I will not stop you. However, you must be really careful and you must also remember what I have told you previously as well,” Hall Master Yuan warned.

“Alright,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

Jian Wushuang rode the spaceship and continued to travel in the sky. Tens of years later, he came before an ancient and big spell.

The spell covered a range of hundreds of millions of miles. It was extremely powerful and it was definitely the greatest spell in the Eternal Chaotic World.

The objective of the big spell was to completely seal up the void that it enclosed.

As Jian Wushuang was a member of the Sanctuary Alliance, he could pass through the big spell directly. After passing through, he came to the vast void within the big spell.

When Jian Wushuang came to the void, he looked at the scene in front of him with shock.

It was a boundless void. However, the center of the void was twisted open completely.

Over there was a black hole with a diameter of at least a hundred million miles revolving. As the black hole revolved, it moved the surrounding void from time to time and this generated air currents. These air currents possessed power to destroy the universe and they could tear the void apart into pieces easily.

It was the first time that Jian Wushuang had seen such a big black hole.

The feeling that it gave him was that of an unprecedented, ancient, ferocious beast which had opened its large, fierce-looking mouth as if it wanted to swallow the whole universe.

Jian Wushuang felt shocked, fearful and even outraged.

“This is the entrance to the Eighth Lair?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes squinted.

Previously, he had been training in the Thunderbolt Island. After that, he took a trip to the Ancient God Sanctuary. However, for the two thousand years in the Ancient God Sanctuary, he had spent most of his time training.

It had been very easy.

It would be fine for such an easy training to continue for a period of time. However, if it continued for too long, it would backfire on him.

An expert could only be born by training and experiencing hardships. Hence, when Jian Wushuang’s abilities achieved a certain level, he decided to travel straight away.

As for the place to travel… what he chose was the Eighth Lair, which was in front of him.

In the Eternal Chaotic World, the most infamous and hence dangerous place was the Eight Lairs!

The Eight Lairs came into existence a very long time ago. Moreover, they had been known to be dangerous. They had also been ranked in order with the next lair being more dangerous than the previous one.

In particular, the danger level of the Eighth Lair was considered the lowest among the Eight Lairs. Normally, only Chaotic Real Gods would have the guts to travel there. Of course, there were also Eternal Real Gods as well. However, these Eternal Real Gods would only dare to travel at the outer layer of the Eighth Lair and they dared not go deep in.

For the Seventh Lair, no Eternal Real Gods would dare to go there. Instead, only top Chaotic Real Gods, as well as experts on the Real God ranking list, would have the guts to travel there.

As for the Sixth Lair… Take Lei Chao of the Lineage of Star as an example. Previously, he had gone there to travel. However, even to experts in the Real God ranking list, there was a high risk of dying in there.

As for the Fifth Lair as well the Fourth Lair, Third Lair and Second Lair which were further in front, only Almighties dared to enter them.

As for the First lair… It was said that even Emperor-level super experts dared not travel there.

It was absolutely a forbidden area in the Eternal Chaotic World!
