Chapter 3026: Upgrade

——

“This kid must be planning something. There must be something that I haven’t noticed yet.” The Magic Note King narrowed his eyes and began to observe carefully.

Bang!

Another head-on collision. Jian Wushuang was sent flying as usual and his divine body was seriously injured again.

However, after this collision, the Magic Note King’s expression suddenly changed.

“No, the power is not right!”

“It’s the same swordsmanship, but the power of his sword seems to be a little better than the first one?”

“Yes, it is a little better!”

The Magic Note King finally noticed it.

Jian Wushuang seemed to be sent flying and trampled by the Magic Note King, but the power of Jian Wushuang’s sword was also increasing.

It was indeed increasing!

“It’s not his divine power that is getting stronger, but…his swordsmanship!”

“His swordsmanship is getting stronger!”

The Magic Note King suddenly raised his head, a rare look of surprise on his face.

He finally understood why Jian Wushuang was acting like a fool, blindly clashing with him again and again.

“He is using me or using me to improve his swordsmanship!” A fierce light flashed in the eyes of the Magic Note King.

“Do you feel it?” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly.

Yes, just as the Magic Note King had guessed, he was improving his swordsmanship.

He had meditated in seclusion for 120 years and created two great swordsmanships. One of them, Star Dream, was already in its embryonic form. It was also a third-level absolute art. It was fast, had amazing cutting and tearing abilities, and could kill at close range, this move was of great help to Jian Wushuang.

He had relied on this move to kill so many True Saints in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom.

However, Star Dream was not suitable for a confrontation of power.

The move, Xi Xiang, was a move that truly valued power.

Unfortunately, although Jian Wushuang had created this move, it was still a distance away from the embryonic form of the sword technique. In other words, this sword technique had not been truly completed and was still in the stage where it could be reconstructed and perfected.

However, in order to perfect this move, he needed to constantly fight with others, and it was best to fight head-on.

Therefore, when he fought with Gold King previously, he initially tried to use the ‘Xi Xiang’ swordsmanship to fight Gold King head-on. However, Gold King’s strength was too weak and could not give him much pressure. Therefore, when he fought Gold King head-on…his swordsmanship could not be improved much.

But it was completely different when he fought with the Magic Note King.

The Magic Note King was a rank-four True Saint. The most powerful skill he created was an advanced rank four skill, which also focused on strength and power.

In a head-on fight with such an expert, even if Jian Wushuang used all of his secret skill cards and used the ‘Xi Xiang’ move, he was still completely crushed. This gave Jian Wushuang an opportunity.

That was why he kept fighting head-on with the Magic Note King in a seemingly silly manner. While fighting, he was constantly pondering the shortcomings of the move ‘Xi Xiang’. During the process of the collision, he was constantly improving this sword skill.

Until now, after dozens of collisions, he had really improved this sword skill a lot. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Unsurprisingly, the move of ‘Xi Xiang’ had reached the level of the peak of stage two and was still improving.

“Haha, awesome! Awesome!”

“Magic Note King, let’s try again!”

Jian Wushuang’s hearty laughter echoed in the heaven and earth, and he rushed toward Magic Note King again.

“Damn it!” Magic Note King’s face immediately darkened.

In the surrounding void, the Immortal Saints of the Magic Note King gathered together and watched the battle attentively.

During this time, they also discussed among themselves.

“As expected of the king. His strength is too strong. The battle strength that Heavenly Sword Marquis displayed before was already at the peak of rank three True Saint Realm. I didn’t expect him to have so many tricks up his sleeve. Now that he has used so many tricks, his battle strength is probably close to that of a rank four True Saint. Even so, he still has no room to resist in front of the king. He is completely crushed by the king!

“Humph!

“Humph, this Heavenly Sword Marquis is really cheap. He was completely crushed by the king, and then he was trampled by the king, but he still laughed so happily!”

“That’s right. If I were him, I would have thought of a way to escape long ago. If he continues to fight like this, I’m afraid that his divine power will be completely exhausted before long, and then he will definitely die.”

The Immortal Saints were chatting and laughing.

They all thought that Jian Wushuang was a complete idiot and also praised the strength of the Magic Note King.

But at this moment…

“Shut up!” A low shout suddenly sounded.

The Immortal Saints were shocked and immediately looked at Gold King, who was shouting in a low voice.

“Haven’t you noticed that something is wrong?” Gold King said in a low voice.

“Wrong?” The Immortal Saints looked at each other, puzzled.

“A bunch of idiots.” Gold King said in a low voice, “Do you think that Heavenly Sword Marquis is really stupid? He knew that he couldn’t defeat the king, but he still foolishly kept clashing with him?

“Ridiculous. Didn’t you notice that the power of the sword technique that Heavenly Sword Marquis displayed was steadily increasing after clashing with the king?”

“What?”

“His swordsmanship is increasing?”

“How is this possible?”

The Immortal Saints were shocked and looked at the battlefield carefully in the next moment.

When they saw this, many people’s pupils shrank.

They also saw that the head-on collision between Jian Wushuang and the Magic Note King was completely crushing. Jian Wushuang was completely crushed.

However, after dozens of collisions, Jian Wushuang was still crushed, but not as easily as before.

After several more collisions, the unique skill of the Magic Note King could not even crush Jian Wushuang.

“A third-level unique skill!”

“The sword skill that Heavenly Sword Marquis used when he fought with me was only a relatively strong second-level unique skill, but now the power of his sword has exceeded the scope of a second-level unique skill. He has already touched the threshold of a third-level unique skill!”

“That is to say, during his confrontation with the king, he raised his sword technique absolute art student from a rank two absolute art to a rank three absolute art, and he is still improving!”

When Gold King said this, his body could not help but tremble.

The surrounding people were completely stunned.
