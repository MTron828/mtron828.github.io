Chapter 2705: Star Fort Master

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Although there was a huge gap between the Earth Ultimate God realm and Heaven Ultimate God realm, some top geniuses could still challenge those at a higher realm. The difference between the Heaven Ultimate God realm and the Grand Ultimate God realm was even more outrageous. Under normal circumstances, even those extremely talented Peak Heaven Ultimate God geniuses from Dragon Phoenix Pavilion could hardly fight against a Grand Ultimate God.

The Star Fort Master alone could easily slaughter a large group of Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods.

“Don’t worry, Master has long expected this attack from the Star Fort Master, so he had prepared something before he went into seclusion. We shall just watch quietly. The Star Fort Master probably can’t do anything to us,” said Xiao Tiexin.

Several people around also nodded in agreement.

It was indeed true as not long after the Star Fort experts appeared in the void above the black castle, a dark-skinned old man dressed in black robes and carrying a triangular head pattern-skinned green snake on his shoulder slowly appeared in the void above.

“Fo Yi.” Old Snake spoke coldly.

“Strange Old Snake, you and I haven’t seen each other for a while. Why do you have to intervene in today’s matters?” Fo Yi stared coldly at Old Snake.

“I’ve agreed to the responsibility of course,” said Old Snake, “I’ve promised Alliance Master Su Han to guard the Sword Alliance for him for two years. One year and nine months have passed and we’re currently counting down the last three months. You should come back in three months if you want to attack the Sword Alliance.”

Old Snake would leave after completing the agreement three months later and would not interfere in any of Sword Alliance’s matters at that time.

“Three months later?” Fo Yi’s eyes were extremely cold. “Su Han killed my only brother. The enmity between us is irresolvable. If I wasn’t going through a critical time previously and was unable to leave the secret chamber, I would’ve killed him a long time ago. You want me to wait another three months? Sorry, I can’t even wait one day.”

Old Snake said, “We have no choice in that case. I’m here to accept it if you want to make a move, but you ought to know my strength level. I’m afraid you won’t be able to go past me.”

“Really?” The Buddha smiled strangely.

Boom!

The terrifying power of a Grand Ultimate God spread across.

The aura oppressed everything as Fo Yi flipped his hand and a golden spear appeared before he immediately fired his first shot.

It was an earth-shattering attack by a Grand Ultimate God expert.

Old Snake was not afraid at all. He emanated a cold breath of aura which spread into the void before stepping forward to greet Fo Yi’s attacks.

The two Grand Ultimate God experts instantly fought head-on in the void. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

A series of earth-shaking noises sounded along with extremely violent divine power every time it happened.

The divine powers that spread to all corners were extremely powerful and were enough to easily tear a Heaven Ultimate God into pieces. It was hard to imagine the level of force at the fight’s epicenter.

“Retreat, retreat quickly!”

“Get out of here!”

Both the Sword Alliance and Star Fort’s experts moved out of the battlefield—giving way to form a larger battlefield.

All of them were standing on the very edge of the battlefield, staring at the battle between the two Grand Ultimate Gods at the center.

Sheng Long exclaimed, “Strong, too strong! This is a battle between the two Grand Ultimate Gods, I don’t know who’ll win in the end.”

“The Star Fort Master has been famous for a long time and is extremely powerful. However, Alliance Master has invited Old Snake’s assistance and is not someone to be trifled with either,” said the Purple Dress House Master.

“I’ve heard about Strange Old Snake, he’s a very terrifying lone ranger expert. In terms of strength, he’s close to the peak among those Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods. His reputation is much greater than the Star Fort Master. I wonder how Alliance Master managed to invite him.”

“In terms of fame, the Star Fort Master is not as famous as Old Snake. He’s probably also slightly inferior in terms of strength.”

Several high-level experts from the Sword Alliance were talking.

Suddenly...

Bang!

There was a loud noise as a rather embarrassing figure was immediately sent retreating quite far back.

Everyone looked on and noticed that person turned out to be the more famous Old Snake.

“How come?” Several high-level experts from the Sword Alliance were surprised.

Old Snake’s expression became extremely solemn after regaining his footings. “Fo Yi, your strength has improved this much?”

Old Snake knew about the Star Fort Master Fo Yi and his strength well.

Fo Yi was a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God and was quite powerful, but Old Snake thought that Fo Yi should be a little inferior as compared to himself.

He fought against Fo Yi many years ago. At that time, Fo Yi was completely subdued by him with no chance to fight back.

Time flew and within 200 years, Fo Yi’s strength had undergone some tremendous changes. Fo Yi had not only gained the upper hand but had also exerted a tremendous amount of pressure on Old Snake—making Old Snake unable to retaliate.

“Haha, Old Snake. I know you were in Sword Alliance a long time ago. Why will I be here if I didn’t have a certain amount of confidence? If you know what’s good for you, you should go away now. Otherwise, you won’t be able to escape today,” sneered Fo Yi.

“Huh, how arrogant!”

Old Snake’s gaze was icy-cold as he strode forward and began attacking again.

At that moment, Old Snake went all out with his strongest method.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Several more bombarding sounds rang again during the confrontation as the triangular-shaped head green pattern-skinned snake on Old Snake’s shoulder shot out without warning. Its size grew in the void before turning into a monstrous python.

The giant python opened its mouth and exposed its fangs before charging at Fo Yi.

Fo Yi shrank his pupils when he saw that.

“Go!”

The spear in Fo Yi’s hand suddenly soared with his stern shout and a terrifying golden beam of light was discharged from the spear.

The giant python transformed from the triangular head pattern-skinned green snake had no chance to struggle and was instantly knocked out of the way.

Even Old Snake’s figure was shocked by the impact before letting out a muffled grunt as he retreated.

A trace of blood spilled from the corner of his mouth after he regained his footing.

“Haha, Old Snake. I was indeed not your match in the last battle, but my current strength has gone through a major breakthrough and has completely surpassed yours. You alone cannot stop me now. If you choose not to leave now, then you may stay here forever.” Fo Yi laughed as the aura in his body soared. He was indeed stronger than Old Snake.
