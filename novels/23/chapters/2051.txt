2052 Emperor Bai Came!

The person who was walking over was Emperor Bai.

He walked over leisurely and his footsteps were slow. However, his footsteps in the void were ringing like a heavy drumroll in Demon King Chen Yu’s and the other Great Emperors’ heads.

One step, two steps…

Demon King Chen Yu looked unprecedentedly solemn.

Emperor Bai was a legend in Eternal Chaotic World.

He was also widely known as the strongest one!

In the beginning, Demon King Chen Yu had even turned his nose up at Emperor Bai. Because he had never fought with Emperor Bai, he’d never thought he would be weaker than Emperor Bai.

Not long ago, he had heard from Leng Ruxue that Emperor Bai had injured Lord Fen badly. Hence, he couldn’t help but have scruples.

Now, Emperor Bai had appeared before him.

“Mister Emperor Bai.”

Jian Wushuang, Abysmal Saint Master, Emperor Jiu Qiao bowed to Emperor Bai.

They weren’t surprised by Emperor Bai’s arrival because it was originally within Jian Wushuang’s plan.

Jian Wushuang wanted Emperor Bai to command the Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance to pick him up from Bronze Heart Region so that it would mislead the experts in Three-Emperors World. At the same time, Emperor Bai had to come to this region himself.

Emperor Bai was the person who was truly taking Jian Wushuang.

“Mm,” Emperor Bai nodded but his eyes were fixed upon Demon King Chen Yu, “Such demonic might. You should be the one from Acheron Palace, Demon King Chen Yu. Am I right?”

“You know me?” Demon King Chen Yu stared at Emperor Bai.

“Of course,” Emperor Bai smiled faintly, “I know all three experts that were left back then. Among the three of you, only Lord Fen fought with me. You will be second. I wonder how your power is compared to Lord Fen.”

“There’s only one way to find out!”

Demon King Chen Yu was outraged. He moved and took the initiative to pounce on Emperor Bai.

On the way, the divine weapons in his eight arms suddenly swept out fiercely.

His terrifying might reached its limit.

Emperor Bai remained composed at the sight. However, there was a huge golden shadow that soared up behind him immediately.

The golden shadow was a golden Emperor.

He was ninety-nine thousand zhang tall and three thousand zhang broad. His golden eyes looked smug. He looked down as though everything living thing in the universe should yield to him.

Emperor Bai fought too.

His slender arms instantly raised his fists. Then, there was a condensation of explosive power.

“Open!”

A word was uttered.

The golden shadow that was ninety-nine zhang tall behind Emperor Bai clenched its right hand too and condensed boundless force.

As Emperor Bai punched:

Rumble!

The void in front immediately shattered.

It swept away everything.

It was as though nothing, not even the universe and the spacetime, could take the punch.

The terrifying punch collided with the eight divine powers that Demon King Chen Yu wielded.

Bang!

There was suddenly a loud bang that spread.

In the middle of the battlefield, the crimson broadsword that tainted the universe red fell to the side.

The originally fierce club flew to the side.

The huge mountain that was transformed by the seal cracked from the middle and collapsed.

…

Every divine weapon that brought about powerful attacks dissolved under the punch. Even Demon King Chen Yu himself took a few steps back.

But then, Emperor Bai, standing in front of the ninety-nine zhang tall golden shadow, took a stride forward.

As he took the stride, rumble. The surrounding spacetime pressed at Demon King Chen Yu.

Demon King Chen Yu was only fighting against Emperor Bai alone. However, he felt like he was fighting against the entire universe.

There was a large amount of golden light that burst out and formed a golden ocean of divine power.

In the golden ocean of divine power, Emperor Bai attacked continuously.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

There were loud bangs and every single one would strike fear in any Great Emperors. It constantly resounded from the core of the golden ocean of divine power.

Jian Wushuang stood outside the golden ocean of divine power, but even he could feel the billowing movement. He couldn’t help but feel astonished.

However, the battle only took place for a short while.

Swoosh!

There was a figure that burst out from the golden ocean of divine power. The figure belonged to Demon King Chen Yu.

The difference from before was that Demon King Chen Yu looked pale now. He had eight arms but two of them were broken. His aura was obviously much weaker than before too.

“Humph!”

A cold humph reverberated in the universe. The golden ocean of divine power slowly dispersed and the scene within was slowly exposed. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Emperor Bai stood there perfectly intact. The ninety-nine thousand zhang tall shadow was still there. His aura grew even more terrifying.

However, he looked at Demon King Chen Yu in anger and disappointment.

“Demon King Chen Yu, at first I thought that if you were one of the three who survived, you should be on par with Lord Fen. Even if you were not much stronger than Lord Fen, you shouldn’t be much weaker. However, the facts show otherwise. You are far behind Lord Fen!” Emperor Bai’s cold roar reverberated through the universe.

“When I fought Lord Fen, at least I had to take out all I had to defeat him or to even severely injure him!”

“But you don’t even make me go all-out.”

“Go away!”

Emperor Bai waved and the wave contained boundless might.

Demon King Chen Yu stood there. He heard Emperor Bai’s remark and his face was red and white from embarrassment and anger. The fire in him ignited too.

However, no matter how angry he felt, he knew that he wasn’t Emperor Bai’s match. Hence, he would merely be humiliating himself if he were to continue the fight.

“Emperor Bai, I lost today. But don’t be too happy about it. In no time, I will take revenge. When I do, I will bury you along with Eternal Chaotic World!!!”

Demon King Chen Yu bellowed and turned and plunged into the far-off void without turning back.

Even Demon King Chen Yu was suppressed and he could only leave. Why would the thirteen Great Emperors, who could do nothing to Jian Wushuang, stay back?

They immediately left too.

In the vast void, there was only Emperor Bai, Jian Wushuang, Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao.

Emperor Bai watched Demon King Chen Yu as he left but there was a strange light shimmering in his eyes. He muttered, “The three experts that survived, I fought with Lord Fen and Demon King Chen Yu fought with me. Both of them lost to me. There is only Kaiser Blood who was the strongest!”

“Kaiser Blood… I wonder when I’ll get a chance to fight with him. I hope that his power is stronger than Lord Fen’s and Demon King Chen Yu’s. He’d better not disappoint me!!”
