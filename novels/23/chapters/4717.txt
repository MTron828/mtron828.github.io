4718 Exchanging Pointers

Cheng Qing smiled and said, “With brother Jian’s ability, it’s not difficult to get Little Lonely Heaven from the Young Emperor.”

Jian Wushuang also smiled. Chen Qing still did not know that the Young Emperor had given him both the Little and Big Lonely Heavens. Since he did not know, he did not answer.

This was not something to be proud of. On the contrary, it was a way to restrain Jian Wushuang.

Cheng Qing did not mind his silence. He raised his eyebrows and smiled, “Brother Jian, since we have nothing to do today, why don’t we have a spar?”

Jian Wushuang wanted to refuse, but he seemed to realize something and nodded. “As you wish.”

“Alright!” Cheng Qing replied, “Then, Brother Jian, let’s begin.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Chen Qing quickly retreated a thousand feet. His peak Yan power shot up into the sky, like a dragon in the sky, wantonly showing off.

Chun Qiu’s expression changed slightly. He hurried forward and said in a low voice, “Brother Jian, I can feel that this is not the limit of this Chen guy’s Yan power. We can’t treat him with a normal attitude.”

“Don’t worry. We’re just sparring on the way of the sword. It’s not a life-and-death battle,” Jian Wushuang replied.

Chun Qiu nodded and quickly left the battle.

Within a radius of 1,0000 feet, the green grass was slightly hunched.

A True Sword with an emerald green touch quietly appeared in Cheng Qing’s hand, causing his entire aura to change. It was like a treasure sword that was hiding its sharp edge, waiting to be activated.

Jian Wushuang also pulled out the broken Tarot Divine Sword from his waist and looked forward calmly.

The Tarot Divine Sword, which had been broken in the middle of the sword, not only did not show any signs of decline, it even let out a few excited cries.

Cheng Qing’s eyes focused slightly. He then reminded in a clear voice, “Brother Jian, let’s only talk about the Sword Dao.”

“Come on,” Jian Wushuang replied in a deep voice as he gripped the hilt of his sword. How could he not know that Chen Qing was taking care of him?

If he were to completely release his realm, this Chen Qing would definitely not be inferior to the Patriarch of the Whirling Heaven. He might even be superior.

He did not say anything else, but a cold killing intent rose up. The entire area within a thousand feet was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.

In the next moment, Chen Qing took the lead. His whole body was like an unstoppable arrow, carrying a great power, and he went straight to Jian Wushuang.

The space exploded and cracked rapidly. The ordinary stab was so fast that even Chun Qiu, who was watching from afar, could not react in time. It went straight for Jian Wushuang’s chest.

If this attack hit him, even if he did not die, he would definitely be seriously injured!

However, Jian Wushuang was faster than him. As soon as the attack was about to hit him, his broken sword blocked his heart.

Clang!

The two swords clashed, and a series of trembling sounds erupted.

Chen Qing, who was flying through the air, felt as if the tip of the True Sword in his hand had encountered a tall mountain and could not advance an inch further.

Jian Wushuang also felt an unparalleled force that made him take half a step back.

Seeing that his attack had missed, Cheng Qing laughed and immediately retreated a thousand feet with his sword.

This short test allowed the two to have some ideas in their hearts.

“Brother Jian, watch my Sword Dao!”

A proud voice resounded. In the next moment, a strong wind rose within a thousand feet. Jian Wushuang felt an inexplicable sense of danger.

The color of the sky changed slightly, and the earth quietly cracked. Cheng Qing held the hilt of the sword with both hands, and Sword Intent seemed to be floating in his eyes.

Countless wisps of light green Sword Intent emerged from his body and then all gathered in the sky above his head, condensing into True Swords.

Jian Wushuang was very familiar with such a sword curtain. It was a kind of Sword Intent manifestation, which was simple and easy to learn. It was suitable for group fighting.

However, in a situation where his swordsmanship was equal or even higher than his own, using this move was equivalent to seeking death and falling into a disadvantageous position.

Jian Wushuang did not understand Chen Qing’s intention, but when he looked above his head again, his eyes narrowed.

In the center of their heads, a giant sword that seemed to carry the power of millions of mountains descended.

It turned out that the sword curtain that was rising up was just a smokescreen. The real sword move was the sword that was hidden within the screen!

Jian Wushuang’s mouth slowly curved into a smile as the sword mountain came down.

Rumble!!!

The ground of the entire Little Lonely Heaven trembled violently. The sword mountain, which was hundreds of thousands of feet high, fell to the ground without any resistance. Jian Wushuang’s body was also pressed under the sword mountain.

Everything within a 10,000 feet radius collapsed!

When Chun Qiu saw this scene, his heart almost jumped out of his throat, and then he ran forward with all his might.

In the sky, Chen Qing’s heart trembled. Based on Jian Wushuang’s performance in Jingchuan’s Tian City, it was impossible that he could not withstand his first move!

But soon, he seemed to realize something. He patted his head and said anxiously, “I’m confused! Brother Jian, I’m coming to save you!”

Chen Qing recalled that Jian Wushuang had just fought a fierce battle at Jingchuan dozens of days ago and destroyed Jingchuan with his own power. He definitely could not recover in such a short time, so it was normal that he could not withstand his sword.

“Please don’t get seriously injured. Otherwise, the Young Emperor will not let me go,” he recalled nervously in his heart. Just as Cheng Qing was about to reach the sword mountain, an extremely pure Sword Intent soared into the sky.

The entire sword mountain shone with billions of the most brilliant light beams.

The explosion resounded!

Cheng Qing was shocked and immediately retreated. He then looked at the rapidly collapsing peak of the sword mountain.

On the highest peak, a figure dressed in a black Ranger’s attire was sitting on top, looking down at the sky with a smile.

The broken Tarot Divine Sword in his hand could not help but tremble, as if it could not hold back. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

In the next moment, as the entire sword mountain collapsed, Jian Wushuang floated down. He held the Tarot Divine Sword and slashed down casually.

It was as if the river of stars had fallen from the Nine Heavens, and the entire sky exploded under this heavy pressure!

It seemed to be endless, but it also seemed to be a casual slash. It expanded tens of thousands of miles across the sky, as if the might of the heavens had descended!

Cheng Qing, who was standing on the ground, raised his head and looked at this scene. His right hand, which was holding the true sword, was trembling slightly.

The majestic and vast sword move was the sword move that he desired the most. It was also the sword that move he found the most unbelievable.

It turned out that other than that person, there was another man who could cultivate the way of the sword to such a terrifying and unprecedented level!

Cheng Qing’s eyes flashed with a touch of excitement. His realm, which had been suppressed, had unconsciously climbed back to the peak.

He had already made up his mind to use his peak state to collide with that sword move and comprehend it to make up for his own Sword Dao!

His terrifying peak strength caused Chen Qing’s aura to rise to an impossible level. It seemed that even the Whirling Patriarch, who was about to break through to the Yan Immortal realm, could no longer be compared to Chen Qing.

The True Sword in his hand gave off a red light and pointed at the sky!

The world was flourishing!
