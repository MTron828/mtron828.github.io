Chapter 1337: Jian Wushuang’s Divine Power Exploded!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Bang!

With a flash of light, Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship was like a brisk autumn wind flying across the heavens, without any trail.

The seven rivals who had been ready to kill Jian Wushuang were all shocked by his swordsmanship.

Hoooo!

As the autumn wind dissipated, Jian Wushuang’s figure appeared behind the seven talents from the Universe God Palace. His Blood Mountain Sword was still roaring.

The advanced rank two unique skill—the Autumn Wind Swordsmanship!

Jian Wushuang acquired this swordsmanship on his way to the Snow Dojo.

It was similar to the Chant of Disturbance that he had created, but was actually faster and more powerful.

Furthermore, the Autumn Wind Swordsmanship could be used to attack a group of rivals.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

There were six cracking sounds.

Those cracking sounds suggested the split of Token. Six of the seven talents felt shocked when they felt the split of their Tokens, soon after which they were forced out of the Mountain Rock World.

Six geniuses were out of the game.

“Still one?”

Jian Wushuang turned around and saw who was still there.

“It’s a consciousness attack!”

“How powerful it is!”

Lu Qing, who was the only one left, felt nervous and sweaty, and licked his lips.

He was attacked by Jian Wushuang’s consciousness attack, but fortunately he defended himself at the crucial moment.

And the talents, including Long Hao at the other side of the battlefield, were shocked.

Jian Wushuang had defeated six rivals with only one swordsmanship!

“You are resilient enough to survive under my attack.” Jian Wushuang smiled to Lu Qing.

“Who are you?” Lu Qing stared at Jian Wushuang. I know all the powerful talents in the Snow Dojo but I have never known someone with such a powerful consciousness attack!”

“I joined the Snow Dojo just recently. Certainly you don’t know me.” Jian Wushuang laughed, “You quit by yourself or did you let me force you out?”

“Nonsense! Don’t imagine you can defeat me!”

Lu Qing gritted his teeth and clung to his axe, thinking that he could defeat Jian Wushuang as long as he was prepared.

He rushed to Jian Wushuang.

Like a furious giant monster.

In response, Jian Wushuang also strode.

As he strode, Jian Wushuang wielded his sword, and his Divine Power exploded.

Lu Qing wielded his axe and exercised his most powerful unique skills against Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword.

A big collision.

Boom!

Lu Qing felt his body was shaking and he was shocked. As he realized what had happened, his token split and he was forced out.

Again, Jian Wushuang just used a simple attack.

He didn’t even have to use the Soul Attack. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

After defeating Lu Qing, Jian Wushuang took back his sword and went to Long Hao.

Long Hao and his teammates were shocked. Jian Wushuang smiled, “We have won, right?”

They won!

The Snow Dojo won!

According to the rules of the Ranked Battle, one party lost the game when all participants were forced out of the game. So the Universe God Palace lost the battle.

Spectators outside the Mountain Rock World were also speechless.

They were stunned by Jian Wushuang.

All eyes were on the hero carrying a long sword, the one they had called the “poor confused guy”.

They had laughed at Jian Wushuang when he went to a group of rivals alone. But now, they had no reason to laugh at him.

Jian Wushuang defeated six talents with only one sword!

And with another, he defeated Lu Qing, the most excellent candidate among the Universe Gods in the First Heaven from the Universe God Palace.

How powerful Jian Wushuang was!!

“Excellent!”

“Hero!”

“Good job!”

It was Master of Silence Gloriette who cheered happily.

Master of Silence Gloriette stood up cheerfully.

But the Red Fire Elderly beside him was totally the opposite.

“We lose!”

It was unexpected for him.

He had predicted that the Universe God Palace could absolutely win this time.

Including the third round of the battle.

But they had lost.

“It is because of him.”

The Red Fire Elderly looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Who is that young talent? Why didn’t we ever hear about him before?”

The Red Fire Elderly congratulated Master of Silence Gloriette, “Finally you win!”

Master of Silence Gloriette looked complacent, “I told you that we would win.”

“Come on!” Red Fire Elderly said, “You won because you enrolled an excellent member, a true genius. Without him, you had no chance to win. I guess he stayed in the Snow Dojo for less than one year.”

The Universe God Palace collected information on the Snow Dojo once a year.

So the Red Fire Elderly guessed Jian Wushuang was the new member.

“Haha, you are right. He joined our dojo three months ago.” Master of Silence Gloriette answered.
