Chapter 5511 ¬†Zhen Ling Shouldn‚Äôt Play Any Tricks

His current strength was indeed inferior to the opponent's, but he had a method: to continuously trap the opponent and then contemplate here indefinitely.

However, by doing so, he would completely offend the other party to death.

Even though he couldn't defeat the opponent, it was still easy to trap them.

He now realized that the power of Life had some resistance to killing, but it could be integrated with the killing of the sword, enhancing his actual combat power.

The ninth level of the Sword Dao was still unable to break through, but a prototype had emerged in his mastery of the ultimate technique.

Life and killing.

He now had to create a more powerful ultimate technique to enhance his combat power.

Otherwise, he would be using a treasure as a fire stick.

To use strength wisely on the blade.

Jian Wushuang understood this principle.

Sitting cross-legged on a rock in a river, Jian Wushuang occasionally saw some evolving fish swimming by.

With a thought, his thought power transformed the golden sword into a fish, circling around him.

"Something is missing!" Jian Wushuang frowned.

Life and killing were opposites. If fused into an ultimate technique, tremendous power would be born.

The more opposing the forces merged, the greater the effect.

Perhaps, he could take advantage of this opportunity to break through in one go.

By cultivating both origin paths to perfection, he could eventually achieve unity.

However, things were not as simple as he thought.

The fusion of the two forces resulted in a violent power that directly shook him with internal injuries, tearing even his Origin Source apart.

Spitting out a mouthful of golden blood, Jian Wushuang came to a halt.

"No, the Extreme Dao has already reached the ninth level. The disparity between the Sword Dao and the Extreme Dao is quite significant. They are inherently opposite, and to merge them, a balance must be found. Right now, the gap is a bit too much!" Jian Wushuang shook his head and ultimately gave up.

Exhaling deeply, he regained his composure, preparing for a battle against the Envoy of All Things.

Retreating wasn't in his nature; even if he couldn't win, he had to give it a try.

Whoosh!

The One Thought Universe to start expanding, releasing the suppressed Envoy of All Things.

Inside, the Envoy of All Things flexed his wrist and angrily exclaimed, "Kid, you've really angered me. I won't let you lose so easily!"

"Is that so?" Jian Wushuang responded indifferently.

He truly didn't believe it.

A top-level tier 6 Emperor was nothing. He had already trapped him with the One Thought Universe. The One Thought Universe possessed the power of Life, not death.

Jian Wushuang could feel that aura‚Äîit was alive.

"Die for me!"

The Envoy of All Things struck mercilessly from the beginning, claiming not to let Jian Wushuang lose too quickly, but his actions showed no restraint.

He had already decided: either kill Jian Wushuang or be killed, forcing the other party to leave quickly.

Six sharp curved knives slashed through the air.

Controlling the One Thought Universe, Jian Wushuang tried to suppress the opponent's strength as much as possible. However, when facing that blade, he couldn't help but be surprised!

Too strong.

The sharp aura was much stronger than his Sword Dao, not even in the same league.

"Come forth!" Jian Wushuang pointed, and the Cloud Decision Sword behind him emitted a resounding sword cry, erupting forcefully.

This was the first time he had used the Jueyun Sword, imbued with the aura of Emperor Jueyun. Its formidable power surpassed even that of the Envoy of All Things.

"You actually have this sword!" The Envoy of All Things was also taken aback.

The shadow left by Emperor Jueyun back then was not much weaker than Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang's expression was equally astonished. Once the power within the Jueyun Sword was triggered, it surpassed his own Sword Dao. Finnd ùíèew chapters on nùíêve/lbiùíè(.)com

Unexpectedly, just containing the aura of Emperor Jueyun could make it this powerful.

With one sword strike, he directly shattered the first sharp knife.

However, with the second one, he couldn't manage.

Jian Wushuang could only manifest his Dao Image, relying on the Beast God Weapon and divine body to confront it head-on.

"This punch represents Life!" Jian Wushuang roared as he threw a punch.

It was a punch accompanied by the power of life.

The second sharp knife, he also broke.

Six sharp knives, two of them shattered.

He had run out of means to make a significant impact.

The thought that the power of the universe could weaken the opponent and enhance himself had its limitations.

Facing the subsequent attacks of the sharp knives, Jian Wushuang directly ignited the Origin Source.

Those strong individuals who had come out of the Beiwang Tower would go to convalesce in the Fenyang Island valley. It was because when they challenged the Beiwang Tower, they would ignite their Origin Source.

In general, burning the Origin Source was something done only when one was desperate.

Unless absolutely necessary, nobody would burn their own Origin Source or divine body.

However, because of the precious land on Fenyang Island that could quickly restore the Origin Source and divine body, it directly triggered a wave of burning Origin Source and divine body.

Of course, not everything was burned; there was a price to be paid.

The points obtained in the Beiwang Tower, along with the number of times one comprehended the Origin Source of All Things, were extremely precious.

If one failed to break through in one attempt, even if they cultivated to become the Universe Master, they would at most gain dozens of opportunities for comprehension.

Of course, Universe Masters couldn't be so mediocre that they couldn't break through even once.

But some individuals, while exceptional in the outside world, were nothing more than outstanding individuals in the Elder Palace.

To become stronger, one had to pay a price.

Burning the Origin Source to pursue a breakthrough‚Äîthat was the cost.

Opportunities for comprehension were meant to be seized.

Points were used to exchange for tokens and the power of All Things.

The things that could be exchanged for points were only these two.

One token was 100 points, and it could be used ten times.

It would shatter after 10 uses.

Some people got stuck on a certain level, trying countless times without success, ultimately preventing them from entering the Beiwang Tower again.

These individuals would then seek to buy tokens from others, and sometimes a token would be traded at astronomical prices, fetching hundreds of billions of cubic godstones for a single token.

As for the power of All Things, it was one strand for 100 points.

The complete Origin Source of the Universe had the ability to regenerate and wasn't afraid of others redeeming it.

Jian Wushuang glanced at his points; this time, it seemed that the Beiwang Tower was going to go bankrupt.

The strength on this level was too formidable; he was simply not a match.

After burning his Origin Source, a sharp knife broke through in front of him. He was already powerless against the three more knives behind it.

It directly pierced through his body, and his divine body shattered with a thunderous explosion.

With the power of Life, he could instantly restore his divine body and Origin Source. However, the sharp aura contained in the knives left him no time to even blink, directly killing him.

Phew!

"I still lost!" Jian Wushuang didn't feel regret; it was just that this sense of despair was even more profound than when others spoke of it.

To defeat the opponent, he probably needed at least to reach the ninth level of the Sword Dao and then create his own peak mastery.

He had plenty of ways to improve, no need to stay in the Beiwang Tower like everyone else.

In fact, with this determination, it was better to try the Demon Sound Mountain.

The power of the Origin Source was indeed powerful, but one could only comprehend it for a day at a time, which was too short.

It wasn't of much help to others.

However, Jian Wushuang's number of attempts was a bit too many, to the point that he could comprehend for over 100 million years without running out.

And he still had points. He wondered if these points could buy the entire strand of the power of All Things.

Since the rules were set, Zhen Ling shouldn't play any tricks!
