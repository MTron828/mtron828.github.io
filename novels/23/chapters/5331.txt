This left the group of Emperors who were overseeing the teleportation array almost collapsing in shock. The Emperor presiding over the temple immediately contacted the headquarters, frightened to step out.

There were two tier 6 Emperors, and over 100 formidable individuals comparable to tier 6 Emperors within this force.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

This power was more than enough to flatten several nearby large provinces.

Bai Yi and his group had concealed themselves well, and the Emperors from the Elder Palace hadn’t noticed. Urgently heading towards Liuzhou, they didn’t linger in this place. Once outside the city, they exerted all their efforts and rushed towards Liuzhou.

Among these people, Guangmu recognized many; some were even subordinates he had personally recruited, many of whom were his former defeated underlings.

Watching them leave, Bai Yi shook his head.

These thoughtless individuals, even if they went to Liuzhou with a large group now, wouldn’t find Jian Wushuang.

They had departed in the wrong direction. Jian Wushuang had fled from the southeast towards this large city, likely after consulting a map.

Going to Hanzhou was closer, but the cities there were farther apart.

Moreover, Hanzhou lacked strong individuals. Jian Wushuang likely chose to escape towards Beimuzhangzhou because of the presence of Guangmu

Tianzun.

Bai Yi quickly deduced Jian Wushuang’s intentions.

Unfortunately, the strong individuals from the Elder Palace had not considered this. They couldn’t contact Jian Wushuang now, nor could they find Yang Sanmu. All they could do was plunge into Liuzhou, searching aimlessly.

At the same time, outside Sharuo City.

Wu Zuo’s avatar exploded, forming a massive barrier, trapping Bai Junwang for a full hour.

The barrier consumed the power of at least three Eternal Treasures.

After breaking free, Bai Junwang, using his keen perception, soared into the sky, transforming into a streak of light heading towards North Mu Zhangzhou.

Jian Wushuang was now very close to Beimu Zhangzhou. If not for the continuous sneak attacks from Daoist Liuyang behind, causing the ancient boat to pause, he might have reached Zhangzhou by now.

In terms of distance, it seemed he would need at least another half-hour to reach Zhangzhou. After that, flying for just a quarter of an hour would bring him to the first major city in North Mu Zhangzhou, the only city with a teleportation array – ‘Beishan City!

“Daoist Liuyang, aren’t you afraid that I will inform the White Tiger Hall about today’s events? By then, you will have no place to hide in the Four Great Secret Realms, and you will surely perish!” Jian Wushuang shouted loudly, looking back at the large hall behind him.

If the opponent hadn’t been launching sneak attacks, he could have been faster.

Just moments ago, he sensed a tremendous threat, as if a fierce beast had broken through its cage and was rushing towards him.

He was genuinely afraid that he would be caught by that terrifying presence before reaching Beishan City.

The old man with sheep horns had yet to return, either fallen or entangled in something.

Now he could only rely on himself, continuously waving the large flag to scare away Daoist Liuyang first. Otherwise, he wouldn’t even get to sit on the teleportation array.

Now, he was all alone, with no one to protect him.

How to face this tier 5 peak Emperor.

Liuyang stood outside the main hall, with a pair of deep eyes looking at Jian Wushuang, arrogantly saying, “A wet-behind-the-ears kid like you thinks I’ll be scared? Even if you make the Temple’s people hunt me down, you have to survive first! ”

Bai Junwang had managed to trap Yang Sanmu, and now his own safety was uncertain.

All he needed to do was to delay Jian Wushuang or capture him, offering him to Bai Junwang. In return, he would gain countless treasures and ascend to tier 6.

When the time came, he could find a secluded place, hide for hundreds of epochs until things settled, and he would be a tier 6 Emperor. He truly doubted whether the Divine Temple would hunt down a tier 6 Emperor for the sake of a Dao Lord.

The Divine Temple should have a clear account of this matter.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang couldn’t send any messages now. Even if he were killed, no one would know it was him.

With ample confidence, he didn’t believe in Jian Wushuangs tactics.

Seeing that words couldn’t move the other party, Jian Wushuang didn’t waste any more words. The only thing he could do now was pray for the return of the old man with goat horns, or hope that there were peak experts within the Beishan City to assist him.

Otherwise, if he stopped, Liu Yang Daoist could instantly attack him and capture him alive,

If he didn’t stop and tried to take a teleportation array, flying on the ancient boat all the way to the Central Elder Palace in the Middle Zhou region, it would probably take millions of years.

Although Liuzhou was very close to the Central State, according to the distance on the map, he really couldn’t reach it without a million years.

This plan was not feasible. If he reached Beishan City and the old man with goat horns hadn’t returned, he would have to continue escaping.

Just as this thought occurred to him, the fisherman at the bow of the boat, with eyes glinting, turned his stiff head and said, “The master instructed me that when necessary, I will block all threats for you!’

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was greatly pleased. He hadn’t expected this seemingly ordinary puppet fisherman to have such a useful function.

Thinking it over, the pursuer from behind was a tier 5 peak Emperor. He asked, “Can you withstand the person chasing from behind, a tier 5 peak

Emperor? ‘

“l can hold on for ten breaths!” replied the stiff fisherman.

Jian Wushuang understood and said, “That’s enough!’

He swore that the first thing he would do after returning to Yuanyang Lake was to ask Wu Zuo to send him back to the Original Realm.

Ten breaths were more than enough for him to enter the teleportation array and escape to the Yuanyang Lake.

He swore that once he returned to Yuanyang Lake, the first thing he would do was have Wu Zuo send him back to the Original Realm.

He would not stay in the Heaven Realm for another moment.

The journey was simply terrifying. Faced with opponents of that caliber, Jian Wushuang found himself powerless to resist, resigned to his fate.

Escape seemed nearly impossible.

It was an incredibly desperate situation.

Running at full speed through space and time, he soon arrived at North Mu Zhangzhou.

Somehow, upon entering North Mu Zhangzhou, the underlying sense of fear in his heart weakened significantly.

“Only ten minutes left, almost there!”

Jian Wushuang focused his thoughts, keeping his strength at its peak. The Demonic Annihilation Armor had already manifested on his body.

The Beast God Domain also erupted in the next moment, with massive wings opening and closing.

He was prepared to jump into the teleportation array at any moment.

Daoist Liuyang behind him was even more anxious.

“What is this kid thinking? Does he really believe that I won’t dare to touch him once he enters Beishan City?”

Daoist Liuyang swiftly took out a dark red pill, turning to Zhu Bachi and said,

“If anything goes wrong later, take this pill. With the power of the Heavenly Demon Technique, it will enable you to unleash the Eight-Armed Demon. At that time, delay Jian Wushuang for a moment.”

Upon hearing the term Eight-Armed Demon, Zhu Bachi’s eyes lit up, nodding heavily.

The Six-Armed Demon was already comparable to the Thirteen Tai’a Sword. The legendary Eight-Armed Demon was much stronger than the Tai p a inheritance,

In the history of the Tianmo Sect, those who could unleash the Eight-Armed Demon body had already advanced to the tier 6 Emperor.

As a Dao Lord, being able to reluctantly unleash the Eight-Armed Demon body, as long as he comprehended a trace of it, he could benefit immensely..
