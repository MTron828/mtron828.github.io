Chapter 3881: Heaven-Punishing Sword

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Sword skill, Wavelight!

It was one of Jian Wushuang’s three most powerful sword skills. It was a sword skill used to trap enemies.

After Jian Wushuang combined four principles, the power and toughness of this sword skill had been greatly improved.

Now, this sword skill was perfectly displayed in Jian Wushuang’s hands.

The mighty waves of sword essence were endless and rushed toward Thousand-edge Demon Monarch.

Thousand-edge Demon Monarch was an expert in sword principle. Now that he was standing in the center of the sea of sword essence, he could clearly sense the endless essence in the sea of sword essence.

“What a powerful essence. This sword skill is quite impressive. If I can’t completely destroy this sword skill in one breath, the waves in the sky will be endless.” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch’s eyes were cold, in the next moment, he raised the Purple Divine Sword in his hand. In an instant, a purple sword light descended from the sky like a purple thunderbolt, slashing toward the sea of sword intent in front of him.

Hualala!

As the purple thunderbolt swept, the sea of sword intent in front of him immediately began to retreat and collapse at a speed visible to the naked eye.

In the blink of an eye, nearly 90% of the sea of sword intent collapsed, but the power of the purple thunderbolt was completely exhausted, dissipating in the world.

“What?”

A hint of surprise flashed through Thousand-edge Demon Monarch’s eyes, but he immediately regained his calm.

“No wonder this kid was able to use this move to render so many third-level Rulers helpless. This sword art is a little stronger than I imagined. Even when I used my full strength, I was still unable to completely destroy this sword art. That Ancient Soul King’s offensive ability is far inferior to mine. His strongest attack can probably only destroy sixty to seventy percent of this sword art at most. But in the blink of an eye, this sword art concept can be completely restored.”

Thousand-edge Demon Monarch could already see that the ocean of sword intent around him, which had already collapsed by 90%, had returned to its original state in a short period of time.

It was still vast and mighty, and endless waves were continuously surging toward him.

“It seems that I really have to take out some methods to kill this kid.” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch’s eyes flashed with a fierce light.

“Heaven-punishing sword!”

Buzz!

A killing intent instantly filled the entire world. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The surrounding space began to tremble under this killing intent.

Even Jian Wushuang could not help but raise his head.

Whoosh!

An unparalleled sword light mercilessly slashed down.

This sword light was bright and dazzling, filled with a terrifying sharpness that could kill the world.

In the blink of an eye, the sword light had already struck the ocean of sword essence in front of him. The sea of sword essence, which filled the sky and was extremely tough, directly melted under the sweeping sword light.

In a short moment, more than 90% of the ocean of sword essence had melted, and there was still a lot of power left in the sword light.

Finally —— buzz!

The vast ocean of sword essence completely dissipated, and Jian Wushuang’s sword move completely collapsed.

“My Wavelight sword art was actually defeated by a frontal attack?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes slightly sank.

After he had integrated four principles, the Wavelight sword art had been improved to a certain extent, and it was much more resilient than before.

However, Thousand-edge Demon Monarch still completely defeated his sword art with one sword move. It was clear how powerful Thousand-edge Demon Monarch’s sword move was.

“As expected of the number one killer in the ninth dark zone.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, but his expression was still very relaxed.

His relaxed appearance was naturally noticed by Thousand-edge Demon Monarch and Blood Rain Demon Monarch, who was in the void nearby.

“This kid, his sword art that he is proud of has been destroyed by my direct strike. What other means does he have?” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch frowned.

“Thousand-edge Demon Monarch,” Jian Wushuang said, “my Blood Sword has dominated the Eternal Dark Prison for so many years, and I have created three strongest swordsmanship. The one I chose to confront you with was the main offensive swordsmanship. Obviously, its power is far inferior to yours.

“The sword skill Wavelight that I just displayed was used to trap the enemy, but it was broken by you.

“But next, I will perform the last sword skill of the three sword skills I created. This sword skill is called Earth Guard. It is mainly used to protect the body. I don’t know if you can break this sword skill of mine.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and waved his right hand, causing endless sword essence to sweep out.

Buzz, buzz, a large amount of earthy yellow earth principles swept out. In addition to the Earth principles, the other three principles also surged into the sword essence.

A layer of Earth Sword Realm was formed. In the blink of an eye, 51 layers of Earth Sword Realm condensed in front of Jian Wushuang.

The 51 layers of Earth Sword Realm, which was led by the Earth principles and contained four layers of principle power, was Jian Wushuang’s strongest protective sword skill.

“Thousand-edge Demon Monarch, come and try it.”

Jian Wushuang smiled. He had absolute confidence in his Earth Guard sword skill.

“Humph, what body protection sword skill? In the face of absolute power, any method is useless. Watch me break your Protection Sword Skill.” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch snorted and raised the Purple Divine Sword in his hand again.

Buzz!

The shocking killing intent once again filled the heaven and earth.

“Heaven-punishing sword!”

Thousand-edge Demon Monarch made his move. He used the sword move that had just destroyed the sword skill Wavelight.

It was a dazzling sword with endless killing intent.

The unparalleled sword light mercilessly slashed out and instantly struck the Earth Guard sword domain in front of Jian Wushuang.

In just a moment, more than half of the 51 Earth Sword Realms had collapsed, but the remaining Earth Sword Realms were still indestructible.

The unparalleled sword light gradually slowed down, and in the end, its power completely dissipated. However, there were still nine Earth Sword Realms left in front of Jian Wushuang.

“You managed to break through 42 levels of the Earth Sword Realm, which is of a much higher quality than before. Thousand-edge Demon Monarch, your swordsmanship is indeed powerful.” Jian Wushuang casually smiled, in the blink of an eye, the 51 levels of the Earth Sword Realm recovered.

However, Thousand-edge Demon Monarch’s face was a little gloomy.

“He actually blocked my heaven-punishing sword?”

“And there are only nine levels left in the 51 sword domains. Obviously, the protective power of his swordsmanship is far from its limit!”

“Thousand-edge, it seems that you have underestimated Blood Sword Master.” Blood Rain Demon Monarch’s playful voice sounded at this moment.

“Humph, I’m not surprised. Blood Sword Master is just a Principles Master. He has a principle true treasure and has been living in Eternal Dark Prison. How could he not have any life-saving skills? Now it seems that his strongest life-saving skill is the protective swordsmanship. He can even block my heaven-punishing sword head-on. He is indeed powerful,” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch said in a low voice.

He acknowledged the power of Jian Wushuang’s body-protecting swordsmanship, but he was not at his wit’s end.

Couldn’t Be Broken?

“I’ve roamed the Eternal Prison for more than a hundred chaos cycles, creating my own Heaven Punisher and Blood Heaven sword-arts. With these two sword-arts, I’ve killed countless prisoners during these hundred chaos cycles. I’ve even killed quite a few third-tier prisoners. In the entire Eternal Prison, aside from the supreme ten monarchs, I’m not afraid of anyone!”

“How can the Blood Sword Master, a mere Principles Masters, stop me?” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch’s gaze was cold. “In terms of power, my Blood Heaven Sword is nearly twice as powerful as the heaven punishing sword. I don’t believe that I can’t kill him.”

Boom!

Monstrous demonic might swept out.

Thousand-edge Demon Monarch’s gaze turned scarlet. At the same time, his entire body was faintly showing a dark red color.

This dark red color was like the color of blood.

Blood stained the heavens. This was the strongest sword skill Thousand-edge Demon Monarch had created, the Blood Heaven Sword.

“Die!”

Thousand-edge Demon Monarch suddenly shouted hysterically.

The Purple Divine Sword in his hand trembled violently and turned completely blood-red at this moment.

Whoosh!

It was a blood-red sword light that made people’s hearts race.

The blood-red sword light was cold, dark, and carried an unprecedented killing intent. In the blink of an eye, it had appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes darkened slightly.

“A stronger swordsmanship? I wonder if my Earth Guard swordsmanship can withstand this sword.” There was a hint of expectation in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

Bang!

The blood-red sword light slashed directly at the Earth Sword Realm. In an instant, an extremely terrifying power and a terrifying cutting force burst out.

The 51 levels of Earth Sword Realm on Jian Wushuang’s body were destroyed in the blink of an eye. Then another level of Earth Sword Realm collapsed and dissipated.

The 47th level, the 48th level!

In the end, the blood-red sword light directly broke through the 49th level of Earth Sword Realm on Jian Wushuang’s body, but it was blocked by the 50th level of Earth Sword Realm.

Thousand-edge Demon Monarch’s strongest sword move stopped at the 50th level.

“It…it didn’t break through?”

This time, Thousand-edge Demon Monarch was really shocked.

He was absolutely confident in his offensive ability. The strongest sword skill he used, blood-heaven sword, was almost as powerful as the 10 Supreme Rulers.

In the first level of Eternal Dark Prison, except for the 10 Supreme Rulers, there were few third-level Rulers who could defeat him in terms of pure power.

However, the strongest swordsmanship that he was most proud of failed to break the body-protecting swordsmanship of the Principles Master?

“Hehe, this is interesting.”

Blood Rain Demon Monarch, who had been watching the battle from the side, also looked over with a strange light in his eyes.

“Thousand-edge Demon Monarch, it seems that your strongest swordsmanship is only so-so.” Jian Wushuang chuckled. Deep down, he was very satisfied with the defensive ability of the earth-protecting swordsmanship.

“Thousand-edge Demon Monarch’s strongest swordsmanship is definitely at the level of a third-level Advanced Ruler. In the Eternal Dark Prison, perhaps only the ten kings can defeat him in terms of offensive power. However, his sword still failed to completely break my Earth Guardian swordsmanship.” Jian Wushuang smiled lightly.

He had previously guessed that the Earth Guardian swordsmanship, which he had refined after fusing four principles and focusing on the earth, should be very powerful in terms of its defensive ability. Now, it seemed that it was indeed so.

“Blood Rain, this kid’s body protection sword technique is quite impressive. It will be very difficult for me to kill him. I’m afraid I’ll need your help,” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch said in a deep voice.

“Thousand-edge, when you asked me to help, you said that as long as I set up an array formation to prevent him from escaping, you would be the one to kill him. You didn’t say that you wanted me to kill him,” Blood Rain Demon Monarch said with a teasing tone.

“I didn’t expect this kid’s protective swordsmanship to be so good.” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch’s face was gloomy. “Blood Rain, help me. You can ask for anything.”

Blood Rain Demon Monarch had helped Thousand-edge Demon Monarch this time because he owed him a favor.

However, when Thousand-edge Demon Monarch asked Blood Rain Demon Monarch, he said that the favor could only be exchanged for Blood Rain Demon Monarch setting up a formation to prevent Jian Wushuang from escaping.

As for Blood Rain Demon Monarch personally making a move, Thousand-edge Demon Monarch did not say it, so it was naturally not within the scope of the favor.

Blood Rain Demon Monarch and Thousand-edge Demon Monarch did not have a good relationship. After seeing the situation clearly, Blood Rain Demon Monarch directly made a condition. “I can help you with five supreme-grade Supreme Treasures.”

Thousand-edge Demon Monarch immediately frowned.

Supreme true treasures were common in Eternal Dark Prison, and they were easy to get.

Killing a Ruler at the peak of the second level could get many such supreme true treasures.

However, supreme-tier supreme true treasures were rare.

Under normal circumstances, a third-level Ruler would only have one or two supreme-tier supreme true treasures.

However, a third-level Ruler with a supreme-grade supreme true treasure was usually very difficult to kill. Therefore, even if Thousand-edge Demon Monarch was one of the five supreme experts in the ninth dark zone, he still had a supreme-grade supreme true treasure, there were not many of them. Blood Rain Demon Monarch wanted five supreme-grade supreme true treasures at once, which was indeed not a small number.

However, when he thought of the principle true treasure Divine Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand, Thousand-edge Demon Monarch clenched his teeth and directly agreed. “Okay, five supreme-grade supreme true treasures. I’ll give them to you later.”

“That won’t do. After all, you’re good at sword principle. Once you kill Blood Sword Master and get his principle true treasure, your strength will increase greatly. By then, I’m afraid I’ll have no choice but to run for my life in front of you. If you don’t want to give it to me later, there’s nothing I can do. So, you’d better give me the five supreme-grade supreme-grade true treasures first, and then I’ll take action. It’s safer,” said Blood Rain Demon Monarch.

Thousand-edge Demon Monarch was so angry that he gritted his teeth, but he still nodded heavily. “Alright, I’ll give you five supreme-grade supreme treasures now.”

With that, he waved his hand and threw an interspatial ring at Blood Rain Demon Monarch.

Blood Rain Demon Monarch took it, scanned it with his consciousness, and nodded with a smile, but then he said, “Thousand-edge, I have to make it clear. Although I promised to do my best, you can’t blame me if I still can’t kill Blood Sword Master.”

“Of course, you just have to do your best,” Thousand-edge Demon Monarch said.

After they finished their discussion, Blood Rain Demon Monarch slowly floated toward Jian Wushuang.

Listening to their conversation, Jian Wushuang remained calm. He did not intend to interrupt them.
