Chapter 75: Battle for Massive Points!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Despite it being early in the morning, there were many Disciples of Dragon Palace, some of whom were even at the sixth or seventh level, gathered on the Martial Arts Practice Field.

Many people wanted to watch as it was well-known that Jian Wushuang and Nangong Jie would fight here in three months.

“Have you heard? Nangong Jie got past the sixth level in Dragon Gate. He even fought a close battle for a long time with a seventh level keeper.”

“Of course! Nangong Jie didn’t fight earlier or later until the last day before the duel. His purpose was very clear.”

“Look, he is coming.”

Nangong Jie, in a luxurious robe with charming smile, and another two disciples came over side by side slowly walking amongst all the disciples of Dragon Palace.

The two disciples were well-known in Dragon Palace, who both had passed the sixth level.

“You two, don’t forget what I told you.” Nangong Jie talked with the two disciples in a low voice.

“Don’t worry. We will never forget what we have promised. Not to mention that it is also important for us.” one of them replied.

“3000 points! It is not a small number. I will not lend it to you easily if I didn’t know your actual ability.” the other one smiled.

“So, you two just enjoy the fight. As soon as the fight is over, I will return the 3000 points with an extra 1000 points.” Nangong Jie smiled.

“Of course! We have never doubted your ability.” The two disciples smiled. They have both battled with Nangong Jie, so they knew his ability. There was no point worrying.

It was why they agreed to lend their points to Nangong Jie.

Not long after Nangong Jie arrived at the Martial Arts Practice Field, Jian Wushuang also appeared, of course followed by Wang Yuan and others.

“Look! The newbie is coming.”

“It seems that he is confident.”

“Em… Wouldn’t a genius like him who is qualified to be a member of Dragon Palace be confident? What’s more, he has been in Dragon Palace for three months, which is a time of great improvement. So as a newbie, he must have improved significantly in this period. ”

“Great improvement? So what? How far can he go in three months? He could get past the fifth level with difficulty three months ago. It is unlikely that he could reach the sixth level. He can only beat Nangong Jie in his dreams.”

“Yeah, he is a newbie after all. Hope he won’t lose too badly.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Guess how many points will Nangong Jie bet with the newbie? The newbie has said in public that he will agree with any amount of points.”

“Let’s wait and see. He won’t win any way. It will be a lesson for him to be more humble as a newbie.”

Disciples of Dragon Palace on the scene spoke loudly without much thought, so both Jian Wushuang and Nangong Jie could hear them clearly.

“Swordsman, you dared to come?” Nangong Jie laughed and looked at Jian Wushuang.

“I promised to fight with you three months ago, so I’ve come.” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

“Great courage! but you are a newbie after all, too naive.” Nangong Jie shook his head and said.

“Cut the crap, Nangong Jie, how many points do you want to bet?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Don’t worry. You are a newbie after all, so I won’t go too far.” Nangong Jie grinned, “I know you won 11 fight three months ago. Although you have been defeated by me, you won 10 thousand points in the end. Plus you came to here to fight and won some points. So you have about 15 thousand points.”

“I have borrowed my friends’ points,12 thousand in total. Let’s bet 12 thousand points.”

“12 thousand points?”

“Isn’t this too much?”

All the people present were stunned.

They all knew that Jian Wushuang got many points by fighting. But scores were very valuable and important in Secret Pavilion and Secret Land of Heaven and Earth. It must be difficult for him to take out 12 thousand points.

“Isn’t it too much?”

“12 thousand points?”

12 thousand points were enough to exchange for several secret techniques or to go to Secret Land of Heaven and Earth 12 times.

It was a large amount for any Disciples of Dragon Palace. Nangong Jie had gone too far in betting 12 thousand points.

“Em? Do you think the points are too much? But you said yourself that you would agree to whatever bet I wanted.” Nangong Jie put on an act and said.

“12 thousand points? OK.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head directly.

“Haha, great courage.” Nangong Jie said with a smile immediately.

The Drill Ground was immediately filled with turmoil.

“He agreed! The Swordsman dared to take it?”

“It is 12 thousand points!?”

“The Swordsman has so many points? ”

“Is he being arrogant at his own cost?”

Seeing all the worried eyes, Jian Wushuang smiled secretly and turned to Wang Yuan and other two people.

“Bro, bro senior and sis junior, I need you to borrow me some points.” Jian Wushuang said.

He did not have 12 thousand points, but he could borrow them.

“Do you have the confidence, bro? It is 12 thousand points.” Wang Yuan frowned and said.

“Definitely! ” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“OK, it is enough to hear that. I trust you. You can have all my 4 thousand points.” Wang Yuan said directly.

” I have exchanged for two secrets before, so I don’t have that many. You can have my left 1.5 thousand points.” Yang Zaixuan said.

“You can also have my 3 thousand points.” Su Rou said timidly.

“Enough.” Jian Wushuang smiled and looked at his bros and sis gratefully.

Jian Wushuang regarded the three people as his bros and sis the moment they lent their points to him without any hesitation.

“12 thousand points.” Jian Wushuang took out his disciple’s pledge. The points in the pledge were shown to everyone. Jian Wushuang looked at Nangong Jie with a threatening gaze.

“Nangong Jie, you looked for this fight yourself !”

“Primordial Gold Core is a big deal?”

“You got past the sixth level in Dragon Gate and fought closely for a long time with a seventh level keeper. Is that a big deal?”

“I will test how much progress I have made in the three months by fighting with you.”

“Come on!”

A 12-thousand-point battle would begin at any moment.
