Chapter 168: You’re Done

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Shocked!

Almost 100,000 startled warriors were gathered at the edge of the Cloud mountain range.

The mere wave generated by the collision could easily sweep away tens of Royal Guards!

What did that mean?

In the Cloud mountain range, when the two overwhelming attacks collided with each other, the two people involved in the head-on collision instantly bore the huge impact but were immediately knocked back.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Jian Wushuang’s figure flew through the air, like a meteor, at an amazing speed while tumbling, smashing against the ground four times in a row.

Every time he smashed into the ground, it cracked, but his figure was still crazily hurtling. Finally, he heavily smashed into the side of a mountain which was hundreds of meters away from his original position.

Bang!

The mountain abruptly shook, causing a small landslide.

Jian Wushuang was embedded in the mountain, with a thick mouthful of blood quickly spurting out.

On the other side, Xue Yun also suffered. He was also thrown hundreds of meters back, sliding to a stop, on the ground, due to the gravel. He also spit?out blood, with a completely pale complexion.

How severe!

The collision resulted in them both suffering injuries and neither one of them gaining an advantage or feeling good about the outcome.

Up in the air, the Yin-Yang Void Realm experts suddenly became quiet.

They looked down at the two injured people with astonished eyes.

“What they displayed just now were Original Sword and Sabre Techniques, right?” A purple-robed woman, who had reached the Exceptional Yin Void Realm, asked startlingly.

Original Blade Techniques...

After hearing those words, these experts couldn’t calm down anymore.

This was different from those ordinary sword skills. Original Sword Techniques involved the legendary Origin!

Even these Yin-Yang Void Realm experts were unlikely to comprehend the Origin.

Thus, the power of an Original Sword Technique was far stronger than that of an ordinary Sword Skill.

Like the Formless Sword Art. Why was it known as the top Sword Skill in Tianzong Dynasty?

Because the Formless Sword Art was the only Original Sword Technique in Tianzong Dynasty.

It was common knowledge that the Formless Sword Art contained nine moves. Actually, those who learned the history of Formless Sword Art knew it contained ten moves. The tenth move was the strongest and most terrifying because it involved the Origin.

But, just now, what had they seen?

They saw two different Blad Skills involving the Origin, used at the same time.

Both, the amazing sword skill displayed by Jian Wushuang just now and the devastating saber move displayed by Xue Yun, were obviously Blade Skills involving the Origin.

How could they not be shocked?

“Hum?”

Sitting at the center of these experts, Di Xi suddenly mumbled and then looked down at them immediately.

“These two little guys should compete again!”

Exactly!

Again.

Jian Wushuang’s battle intent didn’t weaken at all.

And Xue Yun’s overwhelming aura didn’t weaken at all either.

Although they received serious injuries in the collision, they were able to continue fighting.

At that time, they stood up again and slowly walked toward each other.

They kept walking, the halted at a distance of a hundred meters away from each other.

While preparing to fight again, they didn’t say anything and just glanced at each other.

At this point, Xue Yun became startled and attached more importance to dealing with Jian Wushuang. He didn’t expect both he and Jian Wushuang to suffer a lot of injuries after he used his strongest move.

“Come on,” Jian Wushuang growled in a low voice and strode forward. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

He had to admit that Xue Yun’s strength was definitely fierce.

Xue Yun was an exceptional genius as well as a peerless expert.

However, Xue Yun came from Blood Feather Tower with which he had a blood feud with.

Thus, there was no room for him to compromise with Xue Yun.

One would live, one would die.

Boom!

In an instant, a terrifying roar sounded again as they attacked.

The sword shadows rushed forward, one after the other, and each of the blade flashes were swallowing everything, which were both displayed in a perfect way.

The violent, frantic, and fierce battle shocked everyone who was watching.

“Are they still fighting?”

“How can they continue fighting like this?”

“Both of them are lunatics! Total lunatics, monsters!”

With a number of astonished eyes watching, they kept fighting for another half-hour.

After fighting for a while, Jian Wushuang and Xue Yun separated again. At this moment, the calmness and confidence had already disappeared from Xue Yun’s face. The disdain?had also vanished from his eyes, leaving him with only fear, curiosity, and puzzlement.

Now, his whole body was soaked with sweat, and even his hands were slightly trembling. His overwhelming aura had weakened greatly.

“How is this possible?”

“How can this be?”

Xue Yun fiercely stared at Jian Wushuang.

Standing in front of him, Jian Wushuang also looked exhausted. But compared to Xue Yun, Jian Wushuang was obviously more energetic, still radiating a vigorous sword essence.

“So, are you feeling curious and puzzled? Why am l still so energetic after such a long period of fighting?” Jian Wushuang said while wiping the sweat off his forehead and coldly looking at Xue Yun.

There was a dark cloud cast over Xue Yun’s face.

This was exactly what he wanted to ask.

The long period of battle between them consumed their physical strength, as well as a massive amount of their Spiritual Power.

But he had reached the peak of the Gold Core Realm, and he cultivated a special and extraordinary cultivation method that made his spiritual power twice as strong as other warriors in the Gold Core Realm.

That was why he had been willing to continue fighting so fiercely with Jian Wushuang.

He believed that, by extending the fight for a long period, he could make Jian Wushuang expend his spiritual power and then kill him.

But what was the result?

In the long period of battle, Xue Yun consumed eighty percent of his spiritual power while Jian Wushuang was still in good condition, even though his aura had greatly weakened.

“You are only a warrior in the Profound Gold Core Realm. How can your Spiritual Power be so strong?” Xue Yun thundered in a low voice.

“More than one person has asked me that.” Jian Wushuang looked at Xue Yun calmly and said, “The answer is simple. My Cultivation Method is more terrifying than you can imagine.”

“Although I’m a warrior in the Profound Gold Core Realm, I have much stronger Spiritual Power than you, a Peak Gold Core Realm warrior.”

“Now, you have consumed at least eighty percent of your Spiritual Power, but I have used no more than thirty percent. Your power will run out soon. Therefore... You’re doomed.”
