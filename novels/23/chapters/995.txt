Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang stepped into Guest Room 3 and found a brown-haired man waiting for him.

“A pleasure to make the acquaintance of the Dragon Wing Governor, Sir.” Jian Wushuang announced respectfully.

“I was right.” The Dragon Wing Governor was hardly surprised. “I knew you were coming at me.”

It was no secret that the Governor had spent much to hunt for the Jiuqu Dragon Fruit. It was obvious of Jian Wushuang’s purpose to announce his offer in the in the Dragon Wing City.

“What’s your name? Which population are you from?” asked the Dragon Wing Governor.

“My name is Jian Wushuang. I’m on my own, belonging to no population.” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Really? A recluse?” The Dragon Wing Governor smiled wryly. “So, it is true that you do have a Dragon Heart Elixir?”

Jian Wushuang did not reply. Instead, he waved his hand and produced the Dragon Heart Elixir.

Recognizing the Dragon Heart Elixir, the Dragon Wing Governor’s eyes burned with excitement and yearning.

“I see. It is true.” The Dragon Wing Governor fought to silence his ecstatic anxiousness and stared at Jian Wushuang. “Anything you require, my friend. Please be forthright. I will see if I can be of service.”

The Governor was a shrewd person, knowing that Jian Wushuang had surely come to him with the Elixir requiring something in return.

“In that case, I’ll get to the point.”

Jian Wushuang smiled. “I have a matter which requires the help of the Golden-clothed Deacons of the Samsara Temple. Knowing that the number of Deacons of the Temple would rarely number highly, I knew neither any of them or their whereabouts. But I was informed that you, Governor, has always enjoyed great influence and authority in these lands. Hence I come to you, hoping that you may have the solution to my conundrum.”

“You want me to introduce you to the Golden-clothed Deacons of the Samsara Temple?” The Dragon Wing Governor stared at his guest curiously, his brows furrowed with thoughts.

“That’s right.” Jian Wushuang confirmed.

The Dragon Wing Governor fell silent.

The Governor pondered for some time before he spoke again. “Despite their unchallenged rule of the Samsara Continent, the Samsara Temple does not involve interfere in the conflicts and strifes between the numberless populations inhabiting the Continent. Even their divisional chapters are few and scarce.”

“The Golden-clothed Deacons are one of the most supreme keepers of the Temple, bearing unmatched powers and authority. Even the stronger populations would hardly dare displease them, for they bear the pride and vanity as being the principal custodians of the Temple’s might and influence. It is hard for common Dao Masters to steal even a glimpse of them.”

“That is the very reason I came to you.” Jian Wushuang pressed. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang him knew that it was, in essence, impossible for him to secure an audience with the Golden-clothed Deacons of the Samsara Temple by himself.

But were but only a handful of Golden-clothed Deacons in existence. Without many divisional chapters of the Temple, it was impossible for him to secure knowledge of their whereabouts.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang had expected that he would hardly be able to secure an audience with a Golden-clothed Deacon on his own therefore he sought the help of the Dragon Wing Governor.

Some measure of reference would surely be useful in smoothing out his endeavors.

After listening to Jian Wushuang’s request, the governor forced a sardonic smile. “Indeed, I do command ample influence around here. But unfortunately, I do not know any of the Golden-clothed Deacons.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang frowned with dismay.

“Then again, it is by a stroke of luck that I happen to know the residence of one of the Deacons. I can bring you to him. But you will have to speak to him on your own about your errand,” said the governor.

“So be it.” Jian Wushuang replied in short, his eyes flashing with anticipation.

Despite not having any relations to the Golden-clothed Deacon that he mentioned, it was already a great help that he was able to lead him to the Deacon.

He would then do his utmost to negotiate for himself the Deacon’s help once they meet.

“Jian Wushuang.” The Dragon Wing Governor asked suddenly. “What business do you have with a Golden-clothed Deacon?”

“Well…” Jian Wushuang paused momentarily, before he smiled. “I have a kinsman who had become a Reincarnator of the Samsara Temple two thousand years ago. Since then, I have lost all news of him. I need the Deacon’s help to find him.”

“Is that so?” The governor nodded quietly. “But information on the Reincarnators are highly-guarded secrets even in the Temple. They are not easily disclosed. I am afraid the price for such tidings can be really costly indeed; assuming the Deacon is willing to help you. Yes, many times costlier than a Dragon Heart Elixir.”

By his words, the Dragon Wing Governor had just implied that Jian Wushuang would best need preparations before meeting with the Deacon.

“I know.” Jian Wushuang said, nodding faintly.

With the Interspatial Ring that he had received from Dao Yuanzi, Jian Wushuang has a huge hoard of riches and treasures; so great that it was unfathomable to common Dao Masters.

With such immense wealth in his disposal, Jian Wushuang was confident.

He was confident that he would be able to satisfy the price of the Deacon, no matter how costly it might be, to secure his help.

“When do we set off, Governor?” Jian Wushuang asked. He could not wait to leave.

“Patience.” The governor shooked his head with a smile. “I was informed that he had left his abode on some business for the Temple two years ago. He has yet to return.”

“Do you know when will he return then?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“I will need to ask.” The governor said as he immediately sent a message. It was hardly long before he received a reply.

“One of the Deacon’s men had just informed me that the Deacon will return after three years. We will have to wait until then,” said the governor.

“That will hardly be a problem. Three years it is then.” Jian Wushuang nodded gravely.

To him, three years was but a mere blink. For two thousand years, his father had disappeared to become a Reincarnator. Three years would amount to nothing in the face of such time.

“You’re welcome to take up lodgings at my mansion, if you are yet undecided on accommodations. We shall see the Deacon after three years,” said the governor.

“I appreciate your gracious offer, Sir.” Jian Wushuang smiled. He presented the Dragon Heart Elixir and gave it to the Dragon Wing Governor. “You seem rather anxious for this. You can have this now.”

“Really?” The Dragon Wing Governor’s face lit up.

Never did he expect that Jian Wushuang would give him the Elixir despite his promise of leading him to a Golden-clothed Deacon not yet fulfilled.

Such courage… Was this confidence in the character of the governor or was Jian Wushuang truly assured of his strength that he need not fear of the Governor?

“The name of the Dragon Wing Governor rings strongly across these lands. Surely that is worthy for my confidence in you.” Jian Wushuang smiled.
