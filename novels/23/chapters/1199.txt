Chapter 1200: The Battle Fortress!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Shock gripped Jian Wushuang.

He could tell that this land was extraordinary but never expected it to be a huge Battle Fortress.

“So it’s a Battle Fortress!” Gu King, who parasitized Jian Wushuang, was also amazed.

“It’s a challenge to refine a Battle Fortress. In the Eternal Chaotic World, even the lowest-level Battle Fortress is worth far more than a Chaos Magic Treasure. The high-level ones are killing machines and an absolute nightmare!”

“This Battle Fortress is a high-level one and is invaluable despite being 90 percent destroyed. If it’s intact, its value would be even higher than normal Chaos Divine Treasures.”

“It’s more valuable than Chaos Divine Treasures?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“This is getting interesting. To think that such a high-level Battle Fortress would appear in this battlefield and greatly destroyed at that. I’m really curious what sort of war formed this vast battlefield.” Gu King sighed.

“Can we fight the Jin Kingdom with such a strong Battle Fortress?” Jian Wushuang asked quietly.

“A direct fight?” Gu King laughed. “Never mind that, you can even wipe out the entire Jin Kingdom with ease if you can maximize whatever potential left of this Battle Fortress. The problem is that you can’t!”

“This fortress is like a baby equipped a peerless sword. It’s a good sword but the baby can’t demonstrate its power at all. What is the use?”

“It can’t be used?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Jian Wushuang, ask them what other means left in the Battle Fortress that are of use,” said Gu King.

Jian Wushuang did as requested.

Samsara Temple Master momentarily paused before answering, “There are many useful methods in the fortress but their levels are too high. Even some basic attacking methods require the command of dozens of and even hundreds of experts over the Universe Master level. We’re not strong enough to use some of the attacking methods of the fortress.”

“The only offense we can use is the Divine Rays of the North!”

“It’s the weakest attacking method in the fortress but it’s still something to contend with. One streak of Divine Rays of the North can easily kill a Universe Master but it’s not strong enough to kill experts as strong as Monarch of the Jin Kingdom.”

“However, there aren’t many Divine Rays of the North left. There are only 20 left.”

“Divine Rays of the North?” Gu King’s voice resounded inside Jian Wushuang’s mind. “Its one break carries about the same force as an attack from experts as strong as the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom. It’s more than enough to kill a Universe Master but it’s no more than a wild wish to kill the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom.”

“In other words, we can find an opportunity to kill the 20 Universe Masters of the Jin Kingdom with this fortress.” Jian Wushuang clasped his hands.

“You can put it that way. We fully utilized the Divine Rays of the North in the battle five million years ago and killed many Jin Kingdom experts,” Samsara Temple Master said, “In addition, though we have few usable attacking methods, there are still the basic defense movements in this fortress.”

“Even the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom won’t be able to break these defense formations. We can rely on the fortress to take the initiative and fight or retreat at our will. There is nothing the Jin Kingdom can do about us.”

“Doesn’t that make us invincible?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes gleamed. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“It’s not that simple.” Samsara Temple Master shook his head. “The fortress can only withstand the attack of the Jin Kingdom. If they ignore us and attack the Green Fire World instead, is it reasonable for us to stay here and watch them to destroy the Green Fire World?”

“That makes sense.” Jian Wushuang nodded solemnly.

The Green Fire World sat right behind Green Fire Palace. Once the Green Fire Palace experts retreat to the fortress and stop putting up a fight, it was likely that the Jin Kingdom would charge toward the Green Fire World to force the Green Fire Palace experts out.

“Even so, this fortress allows the Green Fire World to cope more easily with the Jin Kingdom experts. If any of us sustain life-threatening injuries, we can run to the fortress and recover,” Jian Wushuang said.

“That’s the idea.” Samsara Temple Master nodded with a smile. “This fortress is undoubtedly our most powerful trump card.”

“Moreover, there’s our second trump card too: a Puppet Fighter.”

“A Puppet Fighter?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

Regular Puppet Fighters, even ones like Jian Wushuang’s ax whose strength equaled that of a top Universe Master, could not be a trump card.

For a Puppet Fighter to be strong enough to be considered a trump card, it must be…

“Is it in the realm similar to the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom?” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

“No.” Samsara Temple Master shook his head. “It’s a formidable Puppet Fighter that is even more terrifying than the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom if its power is fully unleashed. Unfortunately, it consumes Fire Gems and its strength also depends on Fire Gems!”

“Fire Gems are so rare that I collected just a small amount of them after searching the battlefield for over 400 million years. With so few Fire Gems, it’s impossible to unleash the Puppet Fighter’s true power!”

“Even if it can display similar battle strength as the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom, it can last only about 10 breaths.”

“Five million years ago, we have even fewer Fire Gems. The Puppet Fighter didn’t even have a chance to fight.”

“I see.” Understanding dawned on Jian Wushuang. “In other words, we have a trump card that can counter the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom for dozes of breaths long?”

“Yes.” Samsara Temple Master solemnly nodded. “Our three strongest trump cards are tactical formations, the Battle Fortress, and the Puppet Fighter.”

“Besides, we wouldn’t be stingy with resources in life-and-death war. We’ll provide any treasures you need, be it Emperor weapons, Chaos Emperor Weapons or Chaos Magic Treasures. You don’t even need to exchange for them in the Fire Points Exchange Office!”

“We’ll also make available the Secret Skills in Fire Points Exchange Office!”

“We’ll equip the Dao Masters joining the battle with the most powerful Emperor Weapons. We’ll arm the strong ones with Chaos Emperor Weapons so that they can fully unleash their power. We’ll also reward each of them with one drop of Ancient God Power!”
