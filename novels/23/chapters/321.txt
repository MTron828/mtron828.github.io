Chapter 322: Overawe

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Oh?” Chi Mei could not help but be surprised.

He was an expert of the Saint Realm. Faced with his powerful aura, even an expert at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm or the Half-saint Realm would shiver in horror. At this moment, even though Jian Wushuang was suppressed by his aura, he was still as cool as a cucumber.

“Mr. Chi Mei, you don’t need to know who I am. You only need to know that what you want is in my hands.” Jian Wushuang turned his hand over, taking out the long pitch-black spear and the Wrath of Gale and Thunderbolt Manual.

The eyes of Chi Mei and Old Weirdo Yunyang both lit up.

They came here for those two treasures, so they attached great importance to them.

“I’ll give you the two items after everything is done, as long as both of you follow my orders during this trip to the Ice Nether Valley... Do you have any problem with that?” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Fine.” Old Weirdo Yunyang nodded without hesitation. He had been longing for the Wrath of Gale and Thunderbolt Manual, so he cherished this rare chance.

Chi Mei twitched his eyebrows. After thinking for a while, he casually said, “What I want is in your hands, so it’s only natural that I have to follow your orders.”

Hearing what Chi Mei said, Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and noticed a hint of disdain flash through Chi Mei’s eyes. Jian Wushuang speculated that Chi Mei might only be pretending to agree. He was not sure whether Chi Mei would obey his orders once they arrived at Ice Nether Valley.

”?Chi Mei must think I am young, so he’s unwilling to follow a boy’s order.?” Jian Wushuang sneered in his heart. Then he said, “Mr. Chi Mei, I heard you rank 13th on the Bloodmoon List?”

“So what?” Chi Mei replied and shot a glance at Jian Wushuang.

“I’ve been looking forward to fighting with some experts who are ranked close to the top. Elder Wine Master and Elder Yunyang rank too high. Mr. Chi Mei, only you happen to meet my requirement. I don’t know whether Mr. Chi Mei would like to teach me some moves?” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

“You want to fight with me?” Chi Mei was a bit surprised.

“It’s just a small request. I don’t think Mr. Chi Mei will refuse, right?” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Chi Mei replied coldly, “Refuse? Of course I won’t refuse.” He sneered while thinking in his heart.?“The boy is too reckless. If not for the superior third-grade magic weapon, I wouldn’t pay him any mind. He hasn’t even reached the Half-saint level. How could he be qualified to speak to me? Now he dares to challenge me?”

“Fine, let me teach him a lesson so he understands his position.”

Chi Mei had made up his mind to give him a heavy blow.

“Since it’s decided, please come with me,” Jian Wushuang said. Then they walked outside.

The experts in the hall all had an odd expression on their faces.

“Wine Master, who is that little guy? He dared to challenge Chi Mei?” Lady Black asked slowly.

“I saw Chi Mei’s expression. I’m afraid the little guy is going to suffer a lot.”

“Chi Mei probably wants to give him a heavy blow.”

The Wind and Rain Immortals spoke.

“A heavy blow? Hehe, it’s uncertain who will deliver the heavy blow,” the Wine Master said with a smile.

“Oh?” Lady Black, the Wind and Rain Immortals, and Old Weirdo Yunyang all looked toward the Wine Master.

“Let’s go have a look.” With an enigmatic expression, the Wine Master moved and appeared up in the air outside.

“Wine Master, what did you mean?” Lady Black and others immediately followed him.

“Watch carefully.” The Wine Master did not explain. Instead, he wore a slight smile.

Lady Black, the Wind and Rain Immortals, and Old Weirdo Yunyang did not know Jian Wushuang’s real identity, but the Wine Master and Yang Zaixuan were very clear about it.

They knew that Jian Wushuang killed Tan Feng and that Chi Mei, who ranked 13th on the Bloodmoon List, was weaker than Tan Feng.

...

Jian Wushuang and Chi Mei stood up in the air, hundreds of feet apart.

“Boy, come on, show me your strength,” Chi Mei shouted with a careless look.

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly, but thought.?“In this world, no matter where you are, powerful people will be respected. I’m paying a lot to invite them, but if I am not strong enough, it will be hard for me to control them.”

“This trip to Ice Nether Valley is quite different. There will be lots of accidents. If we are not careful, we might lose the whole game. I have to convince them to follow my orders, so I need them to be overawed by me.”

Thinking of this, Jian Wushuang launched an attack with an enormous amount of Spiritual Power crazily gushing out.

“Asura Secret Skill, Road to the Underworld!”

Jian Wushuang wanted to shock them, so he had to use his full strength. With that in mind, he didn’t waste time and performed Road to the Underworld directly.

The blood-red river spread out. At the same time, his Slaughter Domain and Realm of Sword Essence instantly formed as well.

The combination of Road to the Underworld, Slaughter Domain, and Sword Sea!

“Go!” Jian Wushuang shouted.

The blood-red river moved to cover Chi Mei and suppress his body.

Chi Mei was originally standing there with a casual look.

He did not put Jian Wushuang in his eyes, because he thought the little boy was just in the Yang Void Realm.

He did not take this fight seriously.

However, when the blood-red river surged toward him...

Boom!

Chi Mei suddenly lost his balance and nearly fell down.

“What?” Chi Mei’s expression changed immediately.

He felt the scary pressure from the blood-red river. In an instant, it suppressed 90 percent of his strength.

“Domain!”

Shocked, Chi Mei immediately performed his own Domain. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Though it helped relieve some pressure, 70 percent of his strength was still suppressed.

Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang began to move.

A streak of light suddenly flashed through the Blood River, flying across the hundreds of feet between them. Jian Wushuang appeared in front of Chi Mei and slashed at him with his powerful purple longsword.

Chi Mei was surprised. A long scarlet spear appeared in his hand and quietly lashed out. He pushed the power of the spear to its limit and tried to block the stroke.

After they collided with each other...

Peng!

Chi Mei suddenly fell down like a shooting star. He smashed into the Martial Arts Practice Field, causing a huge hole to appear, that was dozens of meters deep. At the bottom of the hole, Chi Mei spent quite a while standing up.

“Mr. Chi Mei, do you want to continue the fight?”

Jian Wushuang stood at the center of the Blood River. With his roaring killing intent, he was just like Shura from hell as his voice resounded through the area.

Chi Mei failed!
