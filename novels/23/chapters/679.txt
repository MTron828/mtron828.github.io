Chapter 680: Sword Mountain

It was a very advanced Sword Principle. Since Jian Wushuang only had superficial knowledge, he was unable to comprehend most of it.

“Very profound.”

Jian Wushuang shook his head and looked at some of the other Dao characters, but they were also too profound for him to understand.

Finally, Xuan Yi began to explain.

“Sword Principle is quite broad and profound and you’ve just recently condensed your Sword Heart, which is only the starting line for truly cultivating Sword Principle.”

“Sword Principle is very complicated. Because of that, it is divided into 72 concepts which are like 72 rivers joining to form a sea. If you only understand one concept, you can only comprehend a tiny part of Sword Principle. So, if you want to truly comprehend Sword Principle, you have to completely understand all 72 concepts.”

“For now, you still have a long journey ahead of you,” Xuan Yi said and smiled.

After hearing this, Jian Wushuang shrugged but he didn’t feel depressed.

He was still very young so he had time to cultivate and meditate on Sword Principle. As of now, he had only just reached the most basic requirement. However, if he had enough time, it would be very possible for him to comprehend all of them.

“There are 72 Dao characters in this cave mansion and every one of them represents the pinnacle in a concept of Sword Principles. Every Dao character represents one of the essences of Sword Principle. So now, what you need to do is try your best to comprehend them and improve your understanding of Sword Principle.”

“Compared to cultivating on your own, this will be easier and more effective,” Xuan Yi said.

After hearing that, Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

If he tried to cultivate Sword Principle on his own, even with Xuan Yi’s guidance, there would still be a limit on how much he could improve.

However, if he had the essences that make up Sword Principle as a reference, it would be a different story. These 72 Dao characters encompassed all the different concepts of Sword Principle and broke them down to their most basic form. Being able to use this would be the same as taking an incredibly difficult task and breaking it into numerous simple tasks.

It might be impossible for him to complete such a difficult task.

But, if they were broken up into numerous simple tasks, he could work on them one step at a time. At the same time, he would be slowly improving his comprehension of Sword Principle.

Doing it this way made it much easier to handle.

“Is this Sword Mountain?” Jian Wushuang was very excited as he clasped his hands.

He knew the requirement for entering Sword Mountain was very high, so he expected it to be an exceptional place for cultivating. To his great surprise, it was much more incredible than he expected because it was tailormade for warriors who cultivated Sword Principle.

As long as he meditated on these 72 Dao characters, his comprehension of Sword Principle would definitely improve.

“Although the requirement to enter is high, there is no time limit once you enter. You can stay here for as long as you want. Also, there are a few things I would like to give to you,” Xuan Yi said.

Jian Wushuang looked at him. Previously, Xuan Yi had told him that he would apply for some resources to give him. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“The first is a Secret Skill.”

Xuan Yi said, “Secret Skills are very powerful, but the cultivation requirements are also very high. Most Secret Skills that can improve physical power require the warrior to be in the Divine Realm. However, you are only in the Skyscraping Realm, so you can’t use those skills yet. However, I will give some that you can cultivate and are useful for you.”

“The first Secret Skill is a Sword Art.”

Xuan Yi said and then handed a Jade Slip to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang accepted it and took a quick glance at it.

“Boundless Heaven Sword Art?”

Jian Wushuang felt a rush of excitement in his heart.

This Jade Slip recorded the Boundless Heaven Sword Art which was a very powerful Secret Skill.

There was a total of seven sword movements and the power was quite terrifying.

Moreover, the Boundless Heaven Sword Art utilized both Sword Principle and Dao comprehension, which made it a very versatile skill.

As long as he reached the minimum requirement, he could even use the Boundless Heaven Sword Art with either the World Dao or Slaughter Dao.

“This Secret Skill is different from a self-created one. Those can be used to attack, defend, and movement since self-created skills will suit you perfectly. However, Secret Skills such as Sword Arts, Saber Techniques, and Stick Technique are Killing Moves!”

“If you look at the Boundless Heaven Sword Art, it contains seven sword moves that are all Killing Moves. It requires tremendous Spiritual Power to use them, but the power will be greater than a self-created skill.”

“On top of that, you’ve already reached the requirement for learning the First Move,” Xuan Yi said.

“I’ve reached the requirement for learning the First Move?” Jian Wushuang was shocked but quickly understood the reason. “The last sword scar from the three that Master has left is the requirement?”

“Yes.”

Xuan Yi smiled and nodded. “That sword imitates the first move of the Boundless Heaven Sword Art. However, it is only an imitation, so it can’t compare with the real first move.”

After hearing that, Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He had comprehended and practiced the third sword scar. Its power was already terrifying and much powerful than the Superior Rank Three Secret Skill that he created, Violet Star Destruction.

Since it was only an imitation of the First Move of the Boundless Heaven Sword Art, its power would be far weaker than the original.

How powerful would the First Move be?

“The Boundless Heaven Sword Art can improve your offensive power, but the most important thing for a warrior is to protect themselves, so I also acquired a protective skill for you, the Dragon Blood Secret Skill.”

“It is a skill that will help you escape by increasing your speed for a short time. However, it burns your Spiritual Power to achieve this, so this skill should only be used to escape, not to fight. You should study it carefully.”

Xuan Yi handed the second Jade Slip to Jian Wushuang.

“It requires you to burn your Spiritual Power?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Spiritual Power was the core of a warrior’s power. To burn their Spiritual Power? It was very unlikely that anyone in the Eternal World would dare to do that.

“Finally, I have one more Secret Skill, a very unique skill,” Xuan Yi said as he handed a golden scroll to Jian Wushuang.

This scroll was a golden Jade Slip that gave off an ancient aura.

Jian Wushuang took it and quickly skimmed through it.
