Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Buzz!

The hazy fog swept away, and Jian Wushuang finally displayed his killer move.

“What is this? A sword formation?” Thunder Ruler frowned as he looked at the fog in front of him. He could feel the power of the formation contained in the fog, but then he snorted coldly and said, “It’s just a small trick.”

The purple thunderbolt power surrounding Thunder Ruler, which was already extremely majestic, suddenly surged once again.

The mighty purple thunderbolt sea swept toward the fog in all directions, intending to disperse the fog directly.

!!

However, the fog that was swept out by the obscure sword formation was not solid at all. Although the purple thunderbolt power attacked, the fog did not have much of an impact on the battlefield.

The fog still filled the entire battlefield, and Jian Wushuang had already disappeared in front of Thunder Ruler.

Thunder Ruler looked around coldly, trying to find Jian Wushuang. However, he could not see Jian Wushuang because of the layers of gray fog, he could only sense Jian Wushuang’s approximate position with his soul perception.

Whoosh!

Without any warning, an ice-cold sword light cut through the void from the side.

“So fast, and so sudden!” Thunder Star Lord was shocked, but he did not panic. He saw a large amount of purple thunderbolt power surge and instantly gathered to form a complete purple thunderbolt armor on his body.

The thunderbolt armor covered Thunder Star Lord’s entire body. The sword light cut down on the purple thunderbolt armor, but it only scattered a part of the purple thunderbolt. In the next moment, the purple thunderbolt armor returned to normal.

“Humph, this is the Thunder God battle armor that I formed after refining the Purple Thunder Scroll. This battle armor can not only increase my offensive power, but also my defensive ability to the extreme. With both offense and defense, my overall strength can be doubled.” The Thunder Star Lord sneered.

The secret technique that he cultivated was extremely powerful. The first scroll of the green thunder scroll had already increased his strength by a lot. Not long ago, he had refined the purple thunder scroll, and his overall strength had increased again. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The purple Thunder God armor was especially powerful, which was the reason why he was so confident.

Jian Wushuang used the sword skill of the obscure sword formation to strike the Purple Thunder God armor, but it did not cause much damage.

However, Jian Wushuang was not in a hurry. In the hazy fog, sword lights lit up again.

Thunder Star Lord was prepared for these sword lights. He easily attacked. Purple lightning pillars descended out of thin air. Most of the sword lights were directly scattered by the lightning pillars. Even if some of them were not destroyed…they could not cause any damage to his purple Thunder God armor.

“Haha, kid, this is your trump card. You’re just scratching my itch.” Thunder Star Lord laughed loudly.

“Really?” Jian Wushuang’s cold voice suddenly sounded behind Thunder Ruler.

“What?” Thunder Ruler was stunned. His soul power had been sensing Jian Wushuang’s approximate position, but he did not sense when Jian Wushuang had appeared behind him.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang had already stabbed out with the Wuqi Divine Sword.

The sword was so fast that Thunder Star Lord did not have time to defend himself.

“Humph, so what if I am stabbed by you? With your level of attack, you can’t break my Thunder God armor.” Thunder Star Lord snorted in his heart. He had absolute confidence in the purple thunder armor on his body.

In fact, unless Jian Wushuang used the dragon-killing secret skill, which could increase his strength in a short period of time, he could not break the Thunder God armor with normal sword skills.

However, Thunder Star Lord did not know that Jian Wushuang had activated the drop of scarlet venom hidden in the Wuqi Divine Sword the moment he stabbed out!

This drop of venom was personally refined by an ultimate level Ruler Poison Ruler!

Just one drop was worth 1,000 universe origin stones!

Chi!

The cold sword light stabbed into the purple thunder armor on Thunder Star Lord’s body, and a sound of divine power melting was heard.

The smile on Thunder Star Lord’s face froze and turned into shock.

Wherever the sword light touched, the purple thunder that formed the Purple Thunder armor started to melt rapidly.

It was like a bowl of hot water sprinkled on the snow in winter.

The purple thunder melted too quickly.

There was nothing they could do. Once the drop of venom contained in the Wuqi Divine Sword exploded, the terrifying corrosive power might not even be able to resist the divine body of an Ultimate Ruler, and this purple thunder was only formed by Thunder Star Lord’s own divine power, how could he withstand the corrosion of the venom.

In an instant, a hole the size of a bowl appeared in the center of the Purple Thunderbolt armor. The Wuqi Divine Sword continued to extend and stab at the divine body of Thunder Star Lord.

There was a protective armor on the surface of the main body of thunder star. Although it was not a Principle Supreme Treasure, it was still the most powerful supreme treasure. Logically, it should be able to withstand all attacks, although Jian Wushuang’s Wuqi Divine Sword was an upper-grade Principle-based supreme treasure, he could not fully pierce through it because he could not unleash its true power.

However, Jian Wushuang did not need to pierce through it. He just needed to let the tip of the sword touch the Supreme Treasure armor. The moment the tip of the sword touched the supreme treasure armor…the drop of Venom from the Wuqi Divine Sword instantly rushed toward the supreme true treasure armor.

The supreme true treasure armor at the supreme grade was corroded and collapsed at this moment. The venom continued to corrode, and in the next moment, it finally entered Thunder Star Lord’s divine body.

Thunder Star Lord’s eyes were wide open.

“No!”

With a hysterical roar, Thunder Star Lord did not even have time to struggle before his divine body collapsed. His divine power was completely corroded, and the sound was completely cut off.

The purple thunderbolts in the sky dissipated, and Thunder Star Lord died!

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang appeared in the void where Thunder Star Lord died. He looked down at the treasure left behind by Thunder Star Lord and was shocked.

“It’s too terrifying. Although I had guessed that the poison was very terrifying, I didn’t expect it to be so terrifying. Thunder Star Lord is a fifth-level Ruler, and he is very powerful. However, in just a moment, he died. Even the supreme treasure armor on his body was corroded.” Jian Wushuang sighed.

Even he was like this, and the experts watching the battle around the drill ground were even more shocked beyond words.
