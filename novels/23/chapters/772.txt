Chapter 773: One Versus Three

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The moment the skinny Old Weirdo Dream dived forward, a sharp aquamarine longsword appeared in her hands.

She burst into shrill laughter. A bizarre light flashed across her eyes, and in the next moment, dozens of figures appeared.

“What is this?”

“Illusionary Body?”

“What an odd Secret Skill.”

The spectators could not hold back their shock.

One person had just turned into dozens of Old Weirdo Dream in an instant. They had the same aura. All of them were holding onto an aquamarine longsword and headed towards Jian Wushuang.

It was hard to distinguish her Original Body from them.

“Hmm?” Jian Wushuang was a bit surprised.

? ?This led him to think of the Secret Skill that Wu Dao had displayed.

At that time, in order to escape, Wu Dao changed into 18 figures and ran in different directions.

However, Wu Dao’s Secret Skill was meant to create doppelgangers that could confuse opponents while escaping. The Secret Skill that Old Weirdo Dream displayed, however, to create illusions to confuse her opponents for attack purposes.

Dozens of identical figures appeared out of nowhere and came towards Jian Wushuang.

“Ancient God Secret Skill, Scarlet Eye!” Jian Wushuang growled.

Then the scarlet mark between his eyebrows opened slightly.

An eerie-looking, vertical blood-red pupil opened suddenly.

It radiated a brilliant blood light and scanned through the figures.

“The Original Body is there!”

Jian Wushuang instantly fixed his eyes on one of the Old Weirdo Dreams and hacked at her with his longsword.

“Get lost!”

His longsword contained terrifying power and it struck the Original Body of Old Weirdo Dream.

“What?”

Old Weirdo Dream was taken aback, as she did not expect that Jian Wushuang would be able to distinguish her Original Body so quickly. She immediately swung her aquamarine longsword to resist his attack.

An enormous crash was heard. Old Weirdo Dream let out a muffled groan and her body moved backward immediately.

“This boy actually saw my Original Body?”?Old Weirdo Dream could not hide the astonishment in her heart as she was retreating. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Yun Fan spoke, “This boy is too powerful. We can’t tackle him one-to-one. Let’s fight together.”

Saber Master and Old Weirdo Dream nodded in agreement. The next moment, the three experts struck at the same time.

By just focusing on the size of their bodies, Yun Fan already looked small when compared to the 15-meter Jian Wushuang, let alone Saber Master and Old Weirdo Dream.

The trio struck out together.

? ?Faced with the three experts, Jian Wushuang unleashed all of his swordsmanship and offensive ability.

Jian Wushuang had done earnest cultivation in the Underground Palace of the Eighth Tribe for several years. Among the three tests there, the Human Level and Heaven Level Tests were designed to test practitioners’ ability to deal with the siege and melee.

Therefore, he was well-trained in handling situations where he was surrounded. This was beyond the experts’ expectation.

Even if Jian Wushuang were to battle three opponents whose powers match his, he would be able to grabble with them for quite some time by using just his own skills. Hence, it was easier to deal with these three who were weaker than him.

Yun Fan used to be on a par with him, but was badly injured by Jian Wushuang, so his strength weakened greatly.

One versus three!

Jian Wushuang still gained the upper hand.

“Jian Wushuang is too strong!”

“Yun Fan, Saber Master, and Old Weirdo Dream are working together, but yet they still can’t beat him?”

“What a terrifying offensive ability! His swordsmanship is also amazing!”

The spectators marveled at it inwardly.

Yun Fan, Saber Master, and Old Weirdo Dream were taken aback.

“His offensive skills are superb!”

“He is so young and his offensive ability is already so strong! His strength is only a bit greater than ours, but he’s able to fight against us with just his offensive ability and swordsmanship?”

“What a real monster!”

Yun Fan growled, “Saber Master, Old Weirdo Dream, stop wasting time on him. Let’s use our trump cards. If we continue like this, Xuan Yi might come here personally. When that happens, we won’t have any chance to catch this boy.”

“OK.” Saber Master and Old Weirdo Dream nodded, as they were all fearful of Xuan Yi.

“Remember, don’t kill him!” Yun Fan reminded.

“You don’t have to remind us that!” Saber Master threw a contemptuous glance at Yun Fan.

Then, all three of them started to display their strongest moves.

? ?Saber Master was up first. He dashed out with a ferocious look. The veins on his face and arms stood out.

He held onto sabers in both hands and took giant steps forward. A terrifying aura started to gather in his hands.

“Secret Skill, Dragon Slayer!” Saber Master shouted.

The saber lashed out immediately.

The sky darkened instantly and everything fell dead silent.

The surrounding turned dark, and in this endless darkness, only the Saber Master’s strike remained.

“Hum?” Jian Wushuang raised his head with a hint of gravity in his eyes.

He could sense that this strike was more powerful than the strongest move that Yun Fan had performed.

Obviously, in terms of offensive power, Saber Master ranked first among the three experts.

However, he was far behind Yun Fan in other aspects.

Faced with the incoming blade light, Jian Wushuang was about to deflect it. But right at this moment, Old Weirdo Dream looked over at him with a bizarre light in her eyes.

“Secret Skill, Eternal Dream!”

Buzz… An immaterial power suddenly swept toward the boy.

Jian Wushuang stood there but he saw everything disappear in front of him.

Yun Fan, Saber Master, Old Weirdo Dream, and the spectators had all disappeared.

They left him alone in the vast and dark Void. A voice echoed in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

It was magical and enticed him to fall asleep.

“Illusion?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression darkened and immediately realized it was an illusion. Instantly, the scarlet mark between his eyebrows opened once again and the vertical pupil radiated a ray of blood light.

The Scarlet Eye Secret Skill helped to see through the reality and illusion.

If one were to cultivate this skill until its peak, any illusion would be useless to him.

Although he had just mastered the Scarlet Eye Secret Skill, Jian Wushuang was able to penetrate the Illusion Skill Old Weirdo Dream had displayed.
