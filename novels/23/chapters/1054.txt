Chapter 1055: Blinding Speed

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“We have never had any animosity with the Empyrean Patriarch, nor have we sought revenge or retribution against each other.”

“Yet not long ago, a Dao Master of our Clan had inadvertently offended one of his Protectors. A most trivial issue. In most cases, the matter would at most be resolved with a minor penalty. But they have immediately executed that Dao Master, showing no ounce of leniency nor mercy. It is evident that the Empyrean Patriarch harbors intense hate towards our Clan!”

“And all these came because of Jian Wushuang.”

Lin Li’s voice rose like a thunder, her nostrils flaring with fury.

“Knowing that Jian Wushuang has a great many enemies thirsty for his blood, you have ill-advisedly decided to bring him here and have brought danger to our Clan!”

“And to shovel coal into the fire, I have had word that you have almost fought against the Empyrean Patriarch and the Ancient Demon Clan! All for the sake of Jian Wushuang! This is nothing but folly and ignorance to endanger the fate of our Clan for an alien!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Her rousing words stirred even many elders of the Clan, many of them who had been neutral. They frowned with dismay.

“I believe you have no authority towards me, Lin Li?” Su Rou snarled ominously.

“My respects, Your Majesty. You are the Holy Emperor of the Asuras, the sacred imperator of our Clan whom we all rever and obey. I, of course, have no authority over your conduct. But with respects, I am afraid that your methods are still boorish, Your Majesty. You still have much to learn.” Lin Li sneered.

“Much you have blathered, only to conceal the fact that you refuse to relinquish control of the Asura Guards.” Su Rou taunted.

Lin Li only snorted indignantly and said no more.

Standing beside Su Rou, the exchange between her and Lin Li had not escaped Jian Wushuang’s ears as he scoffed to himself with disgust.

The Ancient Demon Clan’s animosity towards the Blood Asura Clan stemmed from their rivalry as the two greatest tribes in the land. There has always been conspiracies and deceits between the two clans. Thus, it was of no surprise to him that the Ancient Demon Clan had been preying on the Blood Asura Clan.

The Empyrean Patriarch and his men have always been known to be cruel and sadistic. It was also hardly surprising that anyone of the Blood Asura Clan would have been slain by them, more so for one who had incurred their wrath.

These were incidents as common as the melting of snow. But the cunning Lin Li was trying to hang the blame of both misfortunes over his head.

It would be apparent that she was trying to use this as a pretense to aggravate and inconvenience Su Rou.

Understanding the true intentions of Lin Li, Jian Wushuang rose to his feet at once.

“Great Elder Lin Li, I confess that I have greatly inconvenienced the Blood Asura Clan in the duration of my stay here. Hence, I am willing to repay the kindness shown to me and consider it as a recompensation for the pains that you have endured.” Jian Wushuang declared as he produced an Interspatial Ring with a flick of his wrist.

“There are thirty Chaos Gems in this Ring. I believe this should be adequate remuneration.”

“Thirty Chaos Gems?”

Jian Wushuang could feel himself transfixed by dozens of stares upon him. An examination into the contents of the Ring was done and immediately the chilly stares and glances he felt turned softened.

“Thirty Chaos Gems. I must say I am impressed with your generosity, Master Jian.” One of the elders muttered.

Even the unfriendly eyes of Lin Li could not help but flash with a gleam of astonishment. But the Great Elder tried her best to maintain her composure and her frosty tone, “Thirty Chaos Gems. This, indeed, is a most valuable gift. But do you honestly believe that this compensation is fitting for the hardships you have caused to our Clan, more notably the hatred of the Empyrean Patriarch and his minions?”

“Oh?” The twinkle in Jian Wushuang’s eyes swiftly faded, only to be replaced by a cold fury suppressed within himself. “I see. If the thirty Gems are hardly enough, you say. What about this?”

“And what may that be?” The words escaped the lips of Lin Li before she could rein herself.

But sitting beside Jian Wushuang, Su Rou shifted in her seat uneasily.

None of the elders and warriors present in the chamber had expected that Jian Wushuang would dare unleash his powers in a convention so high and sacred.

“Boom!”

A huge and terrifying aura surged from within Jian Wushuang, pouring out with the force of a broken dam that the enormous round table broke asunder.

Jian Wushuang hurled himself forward with blinding speed like a fleeting apparition.

This had caught the entire congregation of elders unawares that they were frozen with shock.

“Third Brother!”

Caught also by surprise, the colors left Su Rou’s face. Never had she expected that Jian Wushuang would strike suddenly.

The terrifying aura tore through the air, stabbing straight at Lin Li.

But Lin Li was instead overcome by shock and anger, “You insolent pup! How dare you!”

As a powerful Holy Master himself, Lin Li possessed quick reflexes, allowing her to react swiftly.

The gleaming flash of an emerald-green blade flickered dangerously like a serpent striking at its prey. Silhouettes of falling petals rained around her with a frigid coldness that blanketed her surroundings as her sword pierced at Jian Wushuang charging towards him, the flow of Time being suspended in stasis as she unleashed her retaliation.

Whereas the Blood Mountain Sword struck forth with the force and intensity of a lightning bolt hammering down from the sky.

“Clank!”

The two swords clashed and gnashed furiously, emitting a huge explosion of force that released fiery sparkles and ripped even the fabric of Space.

“Such powers he wields…”?Lin Li regarded her foe with disbelief.

She could feel the sheer strength contained within the strike unleashed by Jian Wushuang; a strength that would hardly pale in comparison even to her, a Holy Master.

“You have commendable power and strength, but your skills are still lacking.” Lin Li taunted.

“Really?” Jian Wushuang replied nonchalantly with an eerie grin. There was an anger flaring in his eyes.

“BURST!”

Jian Wushuang roared loudly, his voice echoing loudly within the entire chamber.

And immediately at his command, Jian Wushuang’s blade released the vast and terrifying power contained within it at once!

A huge force swept like a tide towards Lin Li without warning.

“What?” Lin Li’s expression turned into one of shock and fear. “He had imbued a secondary charge of raw power in his stroke! And a huge and powerful force at that!”

Lin Li’s eyes widened with panic as she could feel the reverberations of the explosive force within Jian Wushuang’s sword. The raw energy transmitted from the blade ofher sword, passing intoher arm. With horrifying cracking of bursting flesh and viscera, Lin Li’s arm was blown in to bits and pieces.

Her limb exploded in the blink of an eye, throwing shreds and bits of sinewy flesh and bones into the air as her emerald-green sword flew out of her grasp and clattered harmlessly onto the floor.

And Jian Wushuang had wasted no time, appearing beside Lin Li abruptly.

“OFF WITH YOU!”

With a rumbling growl filled with rage, Jian Wushuang landed a strong kick onto Lin Li.

Heavily traumatized and dazed, Lin Li was no longer able to defend herself as she was thrown off her feet and crashed forcefully into the floor.

“Bang!”

The floor cracked and shattered under her. Another strike came, hitting her so hard that she fell out of the building and rolled down the hill. Then came another strike, sending her off the middle of the hill down towards the foot of the hill.?She crashed into a scarlet-colored palace, smashing the building that it too tumbled and collapsed.

“Whoosh!”

As Lin Li tumbled down the hill, Jian Wushuang followed closely behind, appearing at the fallen ruins of the scarlet-colored palace.

Lin Li was caught under the rubbles of the ruins, clambering to rise toher feet.

“Boom!”

A huge boulder, weighing at least hundreds of kilograms slammed mercilessly intoher chest, pinningher down on the ground.

“Urgh!”

Lin Li vomited a huge mouthful of blood. With most of her bones broken and shattered, she could no longer move and free herself from under the boulder.

And a figure, clad in a blood-crimson robe, stood imperiously atop the boulder. The figure raised his feet which glowed in gold, ready to end the suffering of Lin Li who was writhing with agonizing pain.
