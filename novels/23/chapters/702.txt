“The Univeral Dao Scripture!”

Jian Wushuang muttered, but he instantly shook his head.?“Come on, don’t think about it. I can ask my master after I return to the Ancient Sect. Now that they are treating me as their clansman and I haven’t intended to kill them, it should be fine.”

Five days passed by.

Every time the Eternal Zone opened, the outsiders were able to stay for 10 days. Jian Wushuang had spent two days meditating on the Fifth Occult of the World Dao and had stayed in this underground cave with Gu Qiong for five days, so the outsiders had three days left.

Jian Wushuang spent most of the time cultivating. He occasionally drank and chatted with Gu Qiong. Now he had a basic understanding of the Demon God Clan.

The Demon God Clan had been living in the Eternal Zone for countless years.

They called themselves the descendants of the Ancient God. It was said that their ancestor was powerful enough to shatter the world.

However, their ancestor disappeared many years ago, and no one knew his whereabouts.

All the Ancient God’s descendants admired him. Their blind worship of their ancestor had not weakened with age.

The Demon Gods in this Eternal Zone amounted to more than one million. They all gathered in the inner layer and were divided into 10 tribes. Gu Qiong and Gu Yan came from the Seventh Tribe.

They all treated their clansmen like family, and were friendly to the other clans as well as the human population. Each time the Eternal Zone opened, experts from the Firmament Territory rushed in and tried to kill their clansmen, which provoked the Demon Gods.

Therefore, the Demon God Clan would dispatch their elite clansmen to deal with the outsiders. Over the years, the experts killed many Demon Gods, and vice versa.

”?The experts from the Firmament Territory are invaders indeed,?” Jian Wushuang thought.

“Little brother Wushuang, the outsiders should leave in three days. Then we can go out,” Gu Qiong said.

“OK.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

He had just made up his mind to leave when the time was up.

Just then…

“Howl!”

A roar came from the depths of the dense forest. It seemed to be from a long distance away, but it was resonant, so Jian Wushuang and Gu Qiong were able to hear it clearly.

“Is it…?” Gu Qiong immediately stood up. “My clansman nearby is asking for help.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was a bit surprised.

Gu Qiong said in a low voice, “It must be because of the outsiders.”

“Howl!”

Another roar was heard. Jian Wushuang could tell that it sounded urgent. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Damn it, so urgent, this clansman won’t be able to withstand it.” Gu Qiong seemed worried as he said to the boy in an anxious voice, “Little Brother Wushuang, you stay here, I’ll go and check it out.”

Jian Wushuang had already risen up, and he replied, “Let’s go together.”

“OK, come on.” They instantly flew out of the cave.

The moment they appeared in the dense forest, they sensed violent roars from a nearby area.

“Hurry up!” Gu Qiong said urgently.

The two of them immediately accelerated and arrived at a battlefield.

A Copper-armored Demon God was fighting with a Human Warrior fiercely.

The Human Warrior in a scarlet robe gripped a scarlet scythe and charged forward like a ghost, leaving Blood Shadows in the sky.

Jian Wushuang considered the man and thought, ”?It’s him, Xue Guzi, one of the three superior Divine Realm experts from Cloud Sea Asgard!?”

Jian Wushuang came for the three superior Divine Realm experts, so he had paid more attention to them.

Xue Guzi was considered the weakest among the three superior Divine Realm experts from Cloud Sea Asgard.

However, as the Core Disciple of Cloud Sea Asgard, Xue Guzi was far more powerful than Hu Hu, who had been killed by Jian Wushuang.

Xue Guzi casually swung the scarlet scythe, unleashing Blood Shadows to suppress his opponent. The Copper-armored Demon God desperately resisted but had no chance to fight back.

The Copper-armored Demon God was comparable to an advanced Divine Realm expert, so he was far inferior to Xue Guzi.

Fortunately, he had a powerful body, so he was able to sustain the attacks for a while.

Without any aid, the Copper-armored Demon God would die without a doubt.

“Bastard!” Gu Qiong growled and, without hesitation, dived toward the battlefield.

Jian Wushuang only watched the fighting from afar, he did not intend to step in.

When the Copper-armored Demon God, who had fallen into despair, saw Gu Qiong, he was surprised and delighted.

“Gu Jing, let’s kill this outsider.” Obviously, Gu Qiong knew the Copper-armored Demon God.

Gu Jing nodded solemnly. “No problem.” Then they charged toward their opponent.

“Haha!”

Xue Guzi seemed glad that Gu Qiong had joined their fight. His evil eyes glittered with a flicker of excitement.

“Buy one, get one free. I’m lucky.”

Xue Guzi laughed out loud and dashed toward them with his scarlet scythe.
