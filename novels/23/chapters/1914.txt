Chapter 1915: Dumbstruck

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Rumble. The formation shook and there was a huge opening right in front of the experts from Supreme Ten Alliance.

The experts from Supreme Ten Alliance passed through the opening and entered the galaxy as they wished.

“I hope that Lineage of Star could hold on a little longer so we can make it in time.”

“Don’t worry. It hasn’t been long. Lineage of Star shouldn’t have been wiped out entirely yet. We definitely stand a chance to attack.”

“Hehe, I can’t wait!”

The experts from Supreme Ten Alliance were chatting casually as they plunged inside the galaxy.

Very soon, they arrived at the core region of the galaxy formation, the battlefield.

The moment they arrived at the battlefield, they saw the battlefield in front of them. Everyone who had been chatting leisurely immediately grew shocked.

The war was ongoing before them.

However, the war looked extremely tragic.

It was one-sided. It was definitely a one-sided war.

Even the word ‘war’ couldn’t describe the situation, it should be called a massacre instead!

Looking at the large number of Dao soldiers, along with the experts from Lineage of Star, they constantly swarmed in and besieged the people who were hemmed in.

There were continuous murders and the experts from Star Extermination Alliance who were hemmed in were constantly killed. Their numbers were decreasing.

By then, there was less than twenty people. Even of those who were alive, they were mostly severely injured.

“How could it be?”

“Am I dreaming?”

“Shouldn’t Lineage of Star be the one who is completely suppressed and massacred, to the point where there is no space to counterattack? How could the situation be the total opposite?”

“Star Extermination Alliance was massacred by Lineage of Star?”

Dumbstruck.

Everyone looked at the battlefield and they were dumbstruck.

They had never expected the war to be in such a state.

Previously, they hadn’t worried about Lineage of Star at all.

However, with the situation of the war then, Star Extermination Alliance was obviously defeated and massacred!

“Supreme Ten Alliance, the people from Supreme Ten Alliance are here!”

On the battlefield, the remaining experts from Star Extermination Alliance were thrilled with the arrival of Supreme Ten Alliance.

There were even people who immediately shouted, “Supreme Ten Alliance, hurry up and attack. Wipe out Lineage of Star with us!”

“Hurry up. Otherwise, if Star Extermination Alliance were to be wiped out, Supreme Ten Alliance alone wouldn’t be able to do anything about Lineage of Star.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Hurry up and help!!!”

There were shrill screams along with some roars that reverberated on the battlefield.

The experts from Supreme Ten Alliance exchanged a look.

“What do we do?”

There were gazes that fixed upon the Master of Emperor Sword Sect and Emperor God Wu Yao, the two Peak Emperor Gods.

On the way in, they had been thinking about how to destroy Lineage of Star.

When they arrived in the galaxy and saw the sight, it was entirely different from what they had imagined. Hence, their original plan naturally wouldn’t work.

The Master of Emperor Sword Sect had a cold look. “They are right. If Star Extermination Alliance were to be wiped out, Supreme Ten Alliance alone wouldn’t be able to do anything to Lineage of Star. Seize the time when Star Extermination Alliance still has some power and Lineage of Star just went through a war. Let’s attack immediately!”

“Mm, this is our only chance,” Emperor God Wu Yao nodded heavily.

“Die!”

There was a low roar then the Master of Emperor Sword Sect and Emperor God Wu Yao took the lead to attack first.

The experts from Supreme Ten Alliance saw and they didn’t hesitate and plunged out to kill too.

Supreme Ten Alliance joined the war!

“Great.”

Jian Wushuang wasn’t angry at the sight but he smiled, “Everyone, go all-out and wipe out Supreme Ten Alliance as well!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice reverberated in the void on the battlefield.

The guest elders of Lineage of Star heard and they couldn’t help but roar. There was excitement and passion burning in their eyes.

Before they fought with Star Extermination Alliance, they were anxious and worried that they couldn’t match evenly with Star Extermination Alliance.

But who could have known that Star Extermination Alliance had had the lower hand since the very beginning of the war. In the end, they were even being massacred.

The guest elders felt reassured and it gave a boost to their morale and kept them on an unprecedented high.

Then, even though Supreme Ten Alliance had arrived, they showed no fear.

Plus, Lineage of Star still had strong fighting power. They could totally be fearless to fight against Supreme Ten Alliance.

“Die!””Die!”

“Kill all of them!”

“Haha, it’s been a while since I have such a hearty massacre.”

There were earth-shattering roars resounding in the air. The experts and Dao soldiers from Lineage of Star immediately fought with the people from Supreme Ten Alliance.

Among the crowd.

“Jian Wushuang!” There was a sudden angry bellow.

Jian Wushuang turned to look at the source of the voice. Just as he saw the person who let out the angry roar, the corner of his lips lifted into a cold smirk, “I see. It’s the Master of Emperor Sword Sect. I saw through you long ago, Master of Emperor Sword Sect. You harbor a deep-seated grudge. Once Lineage of Star is in danger, you definitely will attack Lineage of Star without hesitation. From what it seems, I’m right.”

“Humph. If you had wiped out Emperor Sword Sect back then, you wouldn’t have this scene now.” The Master of Emperor Sword Sect humphed, “Today will be the day we of Emperor Sword Sect wash away our humiliation.”

“Is that so? We shall see if you are capable enough.”

Jian Wushuang sneered and moved his willpower. The four Hong Jun Golden Swords burst out at the Master of Emperor Sword Sect like lightning.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang took a huge stride forward. His fourteen arms wielded a sword each and sword intention swept across and pressed at the Master of Emperor Sword Sect.

The Master of Emperor Sword Sect knew that Jian Wushuang was powerful and didn’t dare to act recklessly.

He immediately gave full play to his swordsmanship to withstand Jian Wushuang’s attack.

Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!

There were a few ferocious clashes. Merely a few clashes and in a short time, the Master of Emperor Sword Sect fell back from Jian Wushuang’s attack and he seemed to be in a fix.

“Jian Wushuang is really strong,” the Master of Emperor Sword Sect muttered.

“Master of Emperor Sword Sect.”

There was a voice and Palace Master Wu Luo appeared next to him.

“Jian Wushuang’s power is far beyond us. Earlier, Number One Diving King, the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church and I teamed up but we were suppressed by him. It’d be impossible if you want to match evenly with him alone. Only if you and I and Emperor God Wu Yao team up can we fight against him.”

Palace Master Wu Luo’s voice was soft. If one took a closer look, they could see that Palace Master Wu Luo’s face was pale and there was a bloodstain at the corner of his lips.

It was obvious that he was forced into a miserable situation when he fought with Jian Wushuang alone.

If it wasn’t for Supreme Ten Alliance’s arrival, he might have been killed by Jian Wushuang.
