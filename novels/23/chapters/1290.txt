Chapter 1291: Class!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“This is Universe God Qing Yang from the Holy Prefecture. Like you, he is here to attend the Palace Master’s class.” The White Sector God said.

“Oh?” Chu Xiao and the other two inner disciples were surprised.

The Master of Dayu Palace hardly taught any classes. And, most of the time, only the few most outstanding disciples in Dayu Palace would be qualified to attend. But here were two outsiders for his class.

Forget about Jian Wushuang. He had obtained the Master of Dayu Palace’s favor after all. He exchanged presents for an opportunity to attend his class, but as for Universe God Qing Yang…

Chu Xiao and the other two disciples quickly understood that the fact that Universe God Qing Yang could attend the class was definitely due to a huge price paid by the Holy Prefecture.

“The famous Universe God Qing Yang. That great name has long resounded in my ears.” Chu Xiao said in a cold voice.

“The number one in Dayu Palace, I’ve heard about you too.” Universe God Qing Yang smiled.

“After Palace Master’s class, right here in Dayu Palace, let’s have a fight. What do you think?” Chu Xiao asked in a deep voice.

“Of course.” Universe God Qing Yang nodded.

With a simple exchange, the two of them had arranged a fight.

From the beginning till the end, Universe God Qing Yang didn’t even look at Jian Wushuang. That made him feel rather strange.

Maybe Universe God Qing Yang thought so highly of himself that he didn’t bother with Jian Wushuang. But, he can’t ignore the fact that Jiu Xi, who was killed by Jian Wushuang, was his junior disciple.

Jian Wushuang killed Universe God Qing Yang’s junior, but he didn’t react at all when he saw Jian Wushuang.

Although Jian Wushuang was confused, he wasn’t bothered much.

They waited for a little longer in front of the Fairy Palace until the gates finally opened.

“Go in. The palace master is waiting for you inside.” The White Sector God said.

Jian Wushuang, Universe God Qing Yang, Chu Xiao and the other two talented inner disciples entered the hall without hesitation.

The five of them entered the hall and the entrance closed behind them.

The hall was extremely spacious. There were five cattail hassocks right in the middle of the hall, and there was a sage-like elderly covered in white hair seated right at the uppermost position in the hall.

Jian Wushuang and the other four attendants immediately showed humble reverence and contentiously sat down on the five cattail hassocks in unison.

After the five of them took their seats, the Master of Dayu Palace opened his eyes. The incense burner by the side of the hall, too, started burning and there was a faint aroma that filled the air.

In the delicate aroma, the Master of Dayu Palace started the class straightaway.

He started directly with his experience of passing through the God Test.

The Master of Dayu Palace had exceptional understanding towards the God Test. Even the King of Venomous Worms in Jian Wushuang’s body didn’t understand the God Test as well as the Master of Dayu Palace.

Especially when it came to the details.

The details were the most important part!

Those that seemed insignificant became vital at crucial moments!

Jian Wushuang, Universe God Qing Yang, Chu Xiao and the other two disciples sat on the cattail hassocks while they listened attentively, in fear of missing one single word.

The five of them had to pass through God Test in the Second and even the Third Heaven. The experience that the Master of Dayu Palace was sharing was especially meaningful for them.

When the Master of Dayu Palace shared his experience, he sounded very skillful too.

He first started with three different kinds of God Test. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Three kinds of the God Test: thunder test, fire test, mind test!

The Master of Dayu Palace first talked about the thunder test. He brought up the changes of the thunder test and also countless details. It was actually extremely complicated but he made it easy to understand.

Then, the Master of Dayu Palace talked about the fire test.

When practitioners undergo the God Test, the probability of coming across the fire test is extremely low. Universe God Dong Men once started a massacre when he was in his demonic state. Hence, he faced the fire test but it was a rather mild fire test and it was barely complete. However, it still took Universe God Dong Men’s life.

One could imagine how scary the fire test would be.

The Master of Dayu Palace once underwent a complete fire test. Hence, he had high understanding about fire test.

At this very moment, he was conducting a class to share.

Only the mind test remained among the three kinds of God Test…

The Master of Dayu Palace talked about the thunder test and fire test in details but he merely spent a short time on the mind test before it ended.

Obviously, the Master of Dayu Palace had never come across a mind test so he didn’t know much about it.

The time flew past!

The Master of Dayu Palace used three days and three nights in total for the entire class. He spent two days and two nights solely for sharing details about his experience in the God Test.

As for the remaining one day and one night, the Master of Dayu Palace talked about issues regarding cultivation.

As three days and three nights passed by, the incense burner stopped burning too. The class ended then too.

Even though the time was short, Jian Wushuang reflected on his sharing repeatedly.

“Phew!”

Jian Wushuang was still seated on the cattail hassock as he let out a breath of relief. There was a delighted smile on his face.

The few others shared a similar expression to Jian Wushuang.

They had benefited greatly.

Although it was merely a short three days’ span, everyone was duly rewarded, especially regarding their understanding towards the God Tests.

If they were only twenty percent confident of passing through God Test before, they definitely were thirty percent or more confident of being able to pass through the God Test after the Master of Dayu Palace shared his experience and the details with them.

As for the problem regarding cultivation, they, too, were greatly helped.

“Jian Wushuang, now you know how big the difference is between having an expert to give pointers and fumbling about alone blindly?”

The King of Venomous Worms’ voice was heard in Jian Wushuang’s head, “The Master of Dayu Palace is only a Universe God in the Third Heaven and he was only conducting a class casually. But you benefited greatly from it. If you were to be in the Lineage of Star’s headquarters, there is existence that is much stronger than the Master of Dayu Palace among Lineage of Star. Maybe, you could be formally apprenticed to one of the experts. Then, you would receive even greater benefit!”

Jian Wushuang kept quiet, but he understood deep down in his heart.

The Master of Dayu Palace had casually conducted a class and it was so useful to him. If he were to stay back in Lineage of Star’s nest, he would definitely receive more resources and more pointers from the experts with his identity of a disciple in Star Palace.

“It’s a pity that you won’t be able to return to the Lineage of Star anytime soon. Plus, you will have to undergo your Inverse Cultivation Test in the First Heaven soon. You’re lucky enough to have the Master of Dayu Palace to give you pointers now,” King of Venomous Worms said.

Jian Wushuang was contented.

From what he saw, using a present in exchange for attending the Master of Dayu Palace’s class was definitely worthwhile!

After the class, the Master of Dayu Palace brought the five of them to a huge vacant lot outside Fairy Palace. White Sector God and many other inner disciples were waiting there.

“Palace Master, according to your instructions, our inner disciples in Dayu Palace who have faster comprehension have already gathered here,” White Sector God said.

“Mm,” the Master of Dayu Palace nodded faintly.
