Chapter 661: Rejection

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The various Palace Masters and Vice Palace Masters in the Dao Palace were amazed by Jian Wushuang’s talent and they secretly felt regretful that they weren’t good at the Daos that Jian Wushuang meditated on.

Of course, there were some that didn’t feel that way.

Each of the thirteen Palace Masters in the Dao Palace explored different Daos, so there were two Palace Masters, Baiyu and Mo Tao, who were good at the World Dao and the Slaughter Dao, respectively. After seeing Jian Wushuang’s information, both of these Palace Masters were a bit interested in him.

“Jian Wushuang is so talented. If he cultivates well, he’ll definitely reach the Eternal Realm in the future.”

“Although I have many disciples, there are no more than three who have a chance of reaching the Eternal Realm, but their chances of success are extremely low. Compared with Jian Wushuang, those three are far behind him in strength. It would really be a shame to miss out on such a genius.”

Palace Master Baiyu remained silent as he quickly called upon a disciple under him and commanded, “You, go deliver my token to Jian Wushuang and tell him that Baiyu is willing to take him as a disciple. He can come see me if he agrees.”

“Yes,” the disciple immediately set out to look for Jian Wushuang.

At the same time, a middle-aged man in a black robe, surrounded by an endless killing intent, also appeared at Enlightenment Mountain.

“Jian Wushuang,” a soft voice spread out and entered a specific cave mansion.

Jian Wushuang, who had been devoting himself to cultivation inside the cave mansion, woke up with a start and quickly appeared outside the cave mansion.

“This...” Jian Wushuang looked at the black-robed middle-aged man as if he was an unparalleled god of death because of the terrifying atmosphere that was almost suffocating.

“I am Mo Tao, one of Palace Masters from the Dao Palace, and I am good at the Slaughter Dao,” The middle-aged man said.

“You’re a Palace Master?” Jian Wushuang was stunned at first, but quickly regained his composure and bowed to him. “Respectful greetings, Palace Master Mo Tao.”

“Stand up!” Jian Wushuang straightened his back when Mo Tao waved at him, and then he got to the point. “I’ve browsed through your information. You’re a real talent with a exceptional potential. If you cultivate properly, you’ll certainly be one of the top experts in the Ancient Sect. I’m willing to take you as my apprentice. Are you willing?”

“Personal disciple?” It seemed to appeal Jian Wushuang.

Not long ago, someone came to give him a token from Baiyu who also said he intended to accept him as a personal disciple, but now Mo Tao was here in person.

“You are good at the Slaughter Dao, and I currently remain as the foremost in comprehending the Slaughter Dao,” Mo Tao added.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and immediately said, “I’m sorry, Palace Master Mo Tao. I currently have no plans to apprentice to anyone.”

“Eh?” Mo Tao frowned.

Generally speaking, disciples would select an expert to apprentice to right after joining the Ancient Sect. Jian Wushuang should do the same, but he just said he had no intention to do so. Even though he said it in a tactful way, he had still refused Mo Tao.

“What a pity.” Mo Tao shook his head, but he didn’t force him.

“You should take some time and think about it.”

After saying this, Mo Tao left.

Not long after Mo Tao left, several Vice Palace Masters from the Dao Palace and even the Vice Palace Masters from the Sword Palace, except Vice Palace Master Nie, visited Jian Wushuang for one purpose, to take him as their apprentice.

When Feng and Huo Ying heard about this preferential treatment, they got a bit jealous.

It was known to all that both of them wanted to apprentice to a Palace Master or even a Vice Palace Master, but they had to go through some trials and tribulations first.

Yet, these Palace Masters and Vice Palace Masters took the initiative to come to Jian Wushuang and even battle over him.

Surprisingly, however, all these experts who wanted him to become their apprentice were rejected by him.

Including the Palace Masters from the Dao Palace like Baiyu and Mo Tao, as well as that Vice Palace Master from the Sword Palace, Jian Wushuang had rejected them all.

Jian Wushuang stood there alone, inside the Ancient Sect, cultivating quietly.

During the day, he usually stayed at the Sword Palace, in front of the stone tablet at Sword Tower, meditating on the three sword scars. Sometimes he would head to the Dao Palace and listen to lectures delivered by experts who were good at World Dao and Slaughter Dao.

In the evening, he returned to Enlightenment Mountain, letting his two Original Bodies separate and meditate quietly.

He spent almost every day cultivating and meditating, maintaining a busy schedule.

In a flash, one month had passed. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

At the Dao Palace, numerous disciples of the Ancient Sect sat with their legs crossed at the huge Martial Arts Practice Field. At the very front, the strapping Feng, with sword-shaped eyebrows, prostrated himself before a Palace Master and gave him three respectful kowtows.

“Master! I pay my respects!”

Feng’s voice echoed throughout the entire Martial Arts Practice Field.

Many of the disciples at the Martial Arts Practice Field looked at Feng with envious eyes.

“He’s really persistent!”

“Indeed! He spent a whole month going through trails, with an indomitable fighting spirit, until he finally managed to become apprenticed to Palace Master Destruction as a personal disciple.”

“The barrier for becoming an apprentice to Palace Master Destruction was very high. He’s so lucky to have become one of the personal disciples.”

Nearly all the disciples of the Ancient Sect would apprentice to an expert while most of them would apprentice to those Vice Palace Masters at the level of a superior Divine Realm expert. There was only a tiny minority who were lucky enough to apprentice to the 13 Palace Masters, and these disciples were still split into nominal disciples and personal disciples.

Nominal disciples existed only in name. Although they could attend the lectures of the Palace Master and be instructed, the treatment was poorer compared with those personal disciples.

In the Ancient Sect, almost every Palace Master or Vice Palace Master had plenty of nominal disciples, but the number of personal disciples was small.

They would try their best to instruct every personal disciple.

The reasons Feng was able to become the personal disciple of Palace Master Destruction were that, on the one hand, he was gifted in the Destruction Dao and, on the other hand, he had perseverance and determination. So, he was finally accepted.

Another month passed.

Today, Huo Ying, who had been brought back like Jian Wushuang and Feng, as an inner disciple, was finally apprenticed to an expert.

The one he apprenticed to was also a Palace Master, but he was somewhat unfortunate. That Palace Master was only willing to take him as a nominal disciple because his cultivation age was so long that his potential had been exhausted.

Even though he was only a nominal disciple, Huo Ying still felt happy about it.

In addition, the other three people, Bing Shan, Xuan Ying, and Wu Huang, were also able to apprentice to an expert within these two months.

However, these three were only able to apprentice to those Vice Palace Masters as nominal disciples. They would all have to try harder if they wanted to become personal disciples.

As of now, five out of the six people that Xuan Yi brought back from Firmament Territory Feast had been apprenticed. Only Jian Wushuang was still cultivating on his own.
