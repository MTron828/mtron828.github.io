2206 Inside the Head

Inside Chillywind Valley, in the endless large dark hole. Chillwind was blowing everywhere.

Jian Wushuang recalled that when he was here for the first time, he had almost died to the chillwinds. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Now, the chillwind posed no threat to him.

In the air above Chillywind Valley stood a man in a white cloak.

“Lord Emperor Thirteen.”

Jian Wushuang greeted as he bowed lightly.

Emperor Thirteen looked at Jian Wushuang and said, “Follow me.”

Emperor Thirteen dashed into the Chillywind Valley.

Even though Jian Wushuang had many unanswered questions, he dashed in without hesitation.

Jian Wushuang followed behind Emperor Thirteen as they travelled at terrifying speed.

A while later, Jian Wushuang saw these gigantic, white jades.

“Have we reached the bottom of the Chillywind Valley?” Jian Wushuang asked.

This was where he met Emperor Thirteen for the first time.

He had been surprised by Emperor Thirteen when they first met.

Jian Wushuang was surprised when he saw Emperor Thirteen maintain his speed even as they approached these jades.

Boom!

The jades opened up and created a pathway for Emperor Thirteen to pass through.

“What? This is not the bottom of the valley?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

He had initially thought that they had reached the bottom of the valley. This was not the case.

He followed Emperor Thirteen deeper into the valley.

The further they went, the more surprised Jian Wushuang became.

“Chillywind Valley is far too deep!” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

From the entrance of Chillywind Valley to where he was then, they had at least travelled tens of millions of kilometers, yet they were still not at the bottom of the valley?

They were not close to the bottom either as the way forward was still pitch black.

Even though Jian Wushuang was surprised, he maintained his speed.

Another 7 minutes or so passed.

Finally, they reached the bottom of the valley.

“Is this where the bottom of the valley truly lies?” Jian Wushuang scanned his surroundings.

The ground was scarlet red, just like a human’s flesh.

There were clouds of bloody mist around him. The most obvious structure was another passageway at one side.

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes when he saw this passageway.

The Chillywind Valley was not too far away from Green Fire World, and Green Fire World was located at the centre of the forehead of a humongous head!!

The head was the most unbelievable thing Jian Wushuang had ever seen.

Chillywind Valley was located right below the head.

He followed Emperor Thirteen all the way down to the point that Jian Wushuang forgot how far he had travelled before he got here.

He knew that he was inside the head.

No matter if it was Green Fire World or the other unique sites of opportunity, they were located at the surface of the head.

Now, Jian Wushuang entered the inside of that head.

What would he find... inside the head?

Jian Wushuang’s mind was racing.

The head was the most valuable and mysterious place compared to the rest of the Ancient Battlefield.

When Jian Wushuang looked through the formation on this head, the cultivators from the Green Fire World did try to enter this head and explore the interior but to no avail. The furthest they could go was about a few million kilometers as the skin of this head was extremely tough.

Today, he had reached the interior of the head.

“Lets go.”

Emperor Thirteen said coldly as he walked into the passageway.

Jian Wushuang thought to himself silently for a moment before following Emperor Thirteen.

The passageway was very big. The first noticeable things were the crimson walls at both sides. Jian Wushuang knew that he was inside a real head. He could not help and muttered to himself, “Are these walls really made out of flesh and blood?”

He walked along the passageway for a short while.

An open space appeared in Jian Wushuang’s vision. On this open ground stood many crimson statues.

When these statues saw Emperor Thirteen and Jian Wushuang walking over towards them, they turned alive as their crimson eyes opened. They were filled with killing intent as these eyes turned towards Jian Wushuang and Emperor Thirteen.

An extremely strong sense of danger rose in Jian Wushuang’s heart when he saw these crimson eyes. He was startled.

“These statues...” Jian Wushuang was sure that every single one of these statues was extremely powerful.

Luckily, these statues did not attack and only looked at them once before closing their eyes. This could have been because of Emperor Thirteen.

Emperor Thirteen led the way forward as he walked past all of these statues.

“These statues should be the guardians of this passageway,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

In the Ancient Past, experts would have left special measures in their caves or sites of opportunities.

Just like the expert from the ancient past, Wu Hun, he had left behind many Dao soldiers around him to stop the weaker cultivators from entering to startle him.

In this passageway that Emperor Thirteen had brought Jian Wushuang through, they were within the humongous head. All the valuable secrets should be hidden here, hence, there should contain several measures along the way.

Apart from the crimson statues, Jian Wushuang saw numerous special measures.

There were many sophisticated formations, traps and even more guards.

When the guards deeper in the passageway opened its eyes, Jian Wushuang’s head went blank. These guards must have unimaginable power.

With these measures, it would be impossible for even great emperors to enter. They would most probably die.

Even if the Emperor Bai entered, he might be able to survive due to his unique constitution, but he would never reach the deepest part of the passageway.

The only reason Jian Wushuang could reach so far in was because of Emperor Thirteen.

At the end of the passageway was the core of the humongous head. Here, it was a vast, dark space.

This dark space was limitless and endless.

At the centre of this dark space, a province floated peacefully.
