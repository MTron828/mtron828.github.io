1924 One Glance, One Stroke!

“Who is he?” Purple Moon Emperor looked at the arrogant man in the white robe in shock.

He never seen him before.

However, from the first glance, he could tell that he was very scary!

Such scariness, he who was a Great Emperor who had never felt it from anyone else before.

Jian Wushuang stared at the person in front of him.

This person, no one knew him, but he knew him.

He was the strange person, the mysterious expert that Jian Wushuang had met at Chillywind Valley back when he had been wandering in the ancient battlefield.

He was a strange person. Back then, Jian Wushuang had offended him but he didn’t attack, nor did he kill Jian Wushuang, but he left a unique mark on Jian Wushuang’s body.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t remove the mark at all.

But it was merely a mark so Jian Wushuang didn’t worry much about it.

The mysterious expert from ancient battlefield appeared in front of him directly, through the mark?

What kind of technique was that?

“Who are you?”

The low voice belonged to Abysmal Saint Master. He was a Great Emperor after all and he was the top existence among Great Emperors. Although he could feel the person in front of him was very strong and probably not any weaker than him, he could maintain his calmness.

The arrogant man in the white robe who stood in front of Jian Wushuang didn’t even look at Abysmal Saint Master but only spat, “Go away!”

It was merely a short reply without any power. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

However, it gave an illusion to everyone that?the reply was the universe’s will.

“Courting death!”

Abysmal Saint Master suddenly became furious.

He was Abysmal Saint Master. Even Emperor Bai wouldn’t reprimand him so directly.

The person who popped out of nowhere had commanded him to leave?!

How could he not be furious?

“In this world, besides Emperor Bai, I don’t care about anyone else. Who the hell are you?”

“Die!”

As Abysmal Saint Master raged furiously, there was a chilly gleam in his eyes and the surrounding boundless dark sky started flowing.

Rumble. There were boundless dark clouds that swept out. Then, there was instantly a huge, dark beast, which was the size of a million miles, that appeared from nowhere.

The dark beast opened its mouth and its mouth was a huge darkness whirlpool, the exact whirlpool that swallowed all the power of the seal, Turn Up The Cloud, that Jian Wushuang had performed earlier. Then, the whirlpool was swirling at the arrogant man in the white robe.

As the dark beast moved, it shattered the earth and split the sky!

Everyone on the scene was terrified.

Even Purple Moon Emperor’s eyes dilated in shock when he saw it.

He was also a Great Emperor, but Abysmal Saint Master was listed on the third place while he was at the bottom of the ranking list among all Great Emperors. The differences in their power was naturally vast.

Even if he were to give his all, he could at most keep himself alive under Abysmal Saint Master’s attack.

Then, he could tell that Abysmal Saint Master had gone all out.

“This person, could he withstand Abysmal?” Purple Moon Emperor muttered.

Just then, the arrogant man in the white robe that everyone was fixing their gazes upon suddenly lifted his head.

Without any other action, merely a simple act of lifting his head and a look.

A glance and a will…

Bang!

The dark beast that covered a range of a million miles instantly shattered. The dark clouds then vanished into thin air.

At the same time, the surrounding universe that was drowning in darkness because of Abysmal Saint Master’s existence suddenly dispersed under the gaze of the arrogant man in the white robe. Everything disappeared in an instant and the universe regained light. It was left with no trace of darkness.

“How is that possible?” Abysmal Saint Master stared as he stood there. He couldn’t feel any darkness from the surroundings.

“My goodness,” Purple Moon Emperor was shocked.

Everyone at the scene exclaimed in surprise.

“As you already attacked, I shall return with one stroke.”

The arrogant man in white robe remained at the same spot as he spoke coldly. In his hands that were placed behind him, he slowly extended one of the fingers and glided to the void where Abysmal Saint Master was.

That glide was like an ordinary child drawing with his fingers in the void.

It was smooth yet extremely simple.

Vroom!

There was a sudden flash of sword light.

The sword light wasn’t glorious but rather ordinary and calm.

However, such a sword light made Abysmal Saint Master’s soul fly away and scatter.

He tried his best to perform skills to withstand it but he was surprised to find out that he couldn’t move at all.

“Can’t move?”

“I, a Great Emperor, can’t move?”

Abysmal Saint Master was dumbfounded as he quivered in fear. He could only watch as the sword light continued to magnify in his eyes.

He couldn’t even lift up his hand to block.

Bang!

The swordlight descended and there was a loud bang.

The black armor that Abysmal Saint Master was wearing was a suit of armor from ancient times that he had obtained during the time he had wandered in an ancient mystery land many years ago.

The armor was extremely strong and it was definitely Chaotic Divine Treasure level. It could even be much stronger than any ordinary Chaotic Divine Treasure.

With the armor, Abysmal Saint Master had even dared to venture into some dangerous places when he was in ancient mystery land.

But then, as the sword light swept out, the armor that he had been wearing broke apart.

It shattered into pieces!

His Chaotic Divine Treasure level armor shattered into pieces under the attack of the sword light.

The power of the sword light then hit his body.

“Poof!!!”

Abysmal Saint Master lifted his head and spat a mouthful of blood. He flew out like a dead dog. However, the void surrounding him wasn’t damaged at all, nor was there any divine power or sword light that swept out. It was only Abysmal Saint Master alone who was injured.

Everyone saw the scene.

Silence!

It was dead silent!

Everyone gawked at the arrogant man in the white robe.

With one glance, he had split heaven and earth, shattered the dark beast and dispersed the surrounding darkness.

With one glide of his finger, there was a sword light that had shattered the armor on Abysmal Saint Master and caused Abysmal Saint Master to be severely injured.

These were done by the man in the white robe.

“He... who the hell is he!?”

Purple Moon Emperor was roaring madly in his heart. The roar was hysterical.

The arrogant man in the white robe then put his hands behind his back again. He then looked in the direction of Abysmal Saint Master, “You are not worth killing. Go away!”

HIs voice reverberated.

Abysmal Saint Master then spat another mouthful of blood when he heard that and he nearly fainted.

All the surrounding experts stared.

They then understood that Abysmal Saint Master was alive merely because he wasn’t worth killing?

Because he wasn’t worthy?

That was why he was alive?

Everyone on the spot was dumbfounded.
