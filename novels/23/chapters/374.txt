Chapter 375: Nine Realms and 81 Domains

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

It took Jian Wushuang half a day to read all the information, and he could not help gasping in admiration. “The Divine Land really is great. Nanyang Continent is no match for it.”

The vast Divine Land was full of experts in the Yin-Yang Void Realm, with a good amount of experts in the Saint Realm.

Moreover, the division of the two places was totally different.

In the Nanyang Continent, there were sects and Dynasties, together they constituted the continent.

However, the Divine Land had neither of those. Instead, it had factions led by top experts and families of different sizes.

The Lin family, where Jian Wushuang was currently staying, was a medium-sized family in the Iron Saber Territory.

The territory was large, and Jian Wushuang reckoned that it was as vast as the whole Nanyang Continent.

In this territory, there were six large families, dozens of medium-sized families, and countless small families.

In Jian Wushuang’s mind, there had to be many more Saint Realm experts in the six large families than in a medium-sized family like the Lin family, that already possessed eight such experts.

Besides that, there was also a supreme lord, who could command everyone in the territory, even the six large families, and was said to be an expert above the peak of the Saint Realm.

“In the Divine Land, one territory is as insignificant as a small empire in Nanyang Continent, but its lord is an expert above the Saint Realm. How amazing!” Jian Wushuang praised it.

It was clearly written in what he read,?the vast Divine Land was filled with countless territories like the Iron Saber Territory.

In his eyes, even one territory in the Divine Land was as large as the whole Nanyang Continent. Therefore, the scale of the Divine Land was countless times larger than the Nanyang Continent.

“Too vast!”

“The Divine Land is too damn vast!”

Jian Wushuang couldn’t suppress his shock.

In the Divine Land, “territory” was indeed the smallest scale. Above that was the “domain”, and above the “domain” was the “realm”.

In total, there were nine Realms and 81 Domains.

All the Domains and Realms were under the top experts’ control, and those people were addressed as the 9 Sovereigns and the 81 Marquis.

Each king controlled one realm.

Each marquis controlled one domain, that contained dozens and even hundreds of territories.

In addition to the 9 Sovereigns and 81 Marquis, the Divine Land was also home to three supreme experts, known as the Three Ancestors!

Individually, they were known as the Holy Ancestor, the Spirit Ancestor, and the Stone Ancestor.

The three were regarded as people of supremacy, and their factions made up the Three Hegemons.

“Three Ancestors.”

While reading through the information on the Ancestors, a complex feeling filled Jian Wushuang.

He was a descendant of the Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline!

At his peak, the Sword Ancestor was on an equal footing with the Three Ancestors. His bloodline was once an overlord in the Divine Land, but after his death, due to an unknown reason, his bloodline lost its strongest support and was eliminated by another overlord.

The other overlord was among the Three Ancestors, who are now the Three Ancestors who stand at the top in the Divine Land.

“Jiu Xiu was right.”?Jian Wushuang looked serious.?“I was the strongest person in the Nanyang Continent. But in the Divine Land, I’m nothing.”

Knowing that even the lord of a territory was above the Saint Realm, he couldn’t imagine how strong the 9 Sovereigns and 81 Marquis were.

Also, how strong are the Three Ancestors?

“Looks like my cultivation still has a long way to go.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly but was not discouraged.

No one was born to be an expert. Only difficulties and hardships could create a strong person.

As Jian Wushuang continued studying the information, he heard a boom.

An energy wave suddenly rose from the direction of the mansion, causing a stir in the Lin family.

“It’s...” Lei Yun, standing by Jian Wushuang, was surprised when he felt the energy fluctuation.

“What’s wrong?” Jian Wushuang looked in the direction of the boom.

“It’s Miss Lan’er trying to break through again.” Lei Yun looked terrible.

Jian Wushuang gave him a curious expression.

“Isn’t a breakthrough considered a good thing?”

“Even if she fails, she can gain more experience for the next breakthrough. It does no harm at all.”

“Mr.Swordsman, you may not know this, but Miss Lan’er is different from others. A breakthrough is a good thing to others but a disaster to her,” Lei Yun explained.

“A disaster?” Jian Wushuang was astonished. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“I’ll tell you later. I have to find Miss Lan’er first.” After saying this, Lei Yun rushed towards the energy wave.

Jian Wushuang stood up, but his expression was weird.

“A breakthrough a good chance to others but a disaster to her?”

“I’d like to see what kind of disaster it could be.”

He immediately flew towards the energy wave, filled with curiosity.

When he arrived above Lin Lan’s yard, the energy wave had already subsided. Besides Lei Yun and him, there were also many experts and disciples of the Lin family watching as well. They stared at Lin Lan with a pitying look.

Jian Wushuang looked toward Lin Lan as well, but when he saw her terrible state, he was shocked.

He noticed that her aura was weakening.

Yes, it was weakening!

She failed the breakthrough. But, even worse than that, her aura started weakening, and her realm was regressing!

When he first met her at Jiuqu Waters, she was in the Initial Yang Void Realm, but due to her unsuccessful breakthrough this time, she fell back to the Peak of the Yin Void Realm, then the Exceptional Yin Void Realm, before finally stopping in the Profound Yin Void Realm.

It was not until this moment that her breathing calmed down.

“An unsuccessful breakthrough results in a falling back three levels?”?Jian Wushuang was really horrified.

He had never heard or seen such a thing.

“Unbelievable!”
