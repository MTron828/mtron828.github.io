Chapter 2636: An Uninvited Visit

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“One thousand Primordial Stones?”

The Divine Demons were dumbfounded.

They were stunned by the huge surprise.

Second-class and First-class Divine Demons like them who remained in the wilderness normally only use Ancient God Divine Power in their transactions.

10,000 Ancient God Divine Power only equated to one Primordial Stone.

1,000 Primordial Stones meant 10,000,000 Ancient God Divine Power which was a lot more than the total assets owned by some wilderness’ sects.

Gifting them with such wealth?

It was 1,000 Primordial Stones each! It caught them in a total surprise of course.

However, Jian Wushuang continued to speak, “It’s true that these Primordial Stones are for you, but don’t get too happy too soon. I’ll plant a restrictive spell on each of you that would not activate in normal circumstances. However, I will sense it immediately if you mentioned what happened today to anyone and the spell will immediately trigger—killing you right there and then.”

The Divine Demons shuddered before immediately snapping out of it.

“Sir, please be assured that we’ll never mention what happened today to anyone,” said one of them.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and casually planted the restrictive spell on each of them.

“You may go.”

The Divine Demons left the mining cave excited and perturbed as Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

Jian Wushuang looked over to Cang Heng and the other few commanders before taking out a similar Interspatial Ring after those Divine Demons had left. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Inside the ring is 20,000,000 Primordial Stones which you can split among yourselves. All of you are my people, so I won’t plant the spell on you. However, I do have to say that you’d better forget about everything you saw here. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being ruthless,” said Jian Wushuang frostily.

“Aye.” Cang Heng nodded immediately.

“Your Excellency, please be assured that we won’t utter a word about today’s occurrence.” The other two commanders nodded in agreement.

Although 20,000,000 Primordial Stones was far from the Royal Blood Gem’s value, it was quite an astronomical amount to the commanders.

Even after they gave some to their soldiers and divided it equally among themselves, they each would still have a few million Primordial Stones.

It was enough to shut them up.

“Come, let’s get out of here.”

Jian Wushuang and his men left the mining cave—ready to return to camp.

On their return path...

“Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord, where do you think you’re going?” An evil smile appeared in a void beside them.

Jian Wushuang’s face turned grim when he looked over and recognized who it was.

It was none other than Inspector Jin Yihang. Other than him, another person was gliding next to him—a Heaven Ultimate God!!

Jian Wushuang would normally not be worried about Jin Yihang. However, Jin Yihang paid him a surprise visit right after Jian Wushuang and his men left the mining cave which made him begin to wonder.

‘Is he suspecting something about what just happened?’ Jian Wushuang thought to himself but quickly negated the idea.

‘No, I have planted my restrictive spell on those Divine Demons. They won’t have the guts to spill the secret, while Cang Heng and the rest have been handsomely bribed to the extent they won’t receive a better amount even if they told Crimson Stone Fort the secret. Therefore, they have no reason to sell me out either. In addition, those who are present won’t only be Jin Yihang if word about Royal Blood Gem is out.’

However, he was still quite alarmed even after concluding that Jin Yihang was not there for Royal Blood Gem.

“Mr. Inspector, I just had a detailed investigation of this mineral vein and about to return to the camp. I wonder what’s the urgency?” Jian Wushuang casually spoke.

“Oh, I’ve nothing urgent, but Mr. Qing Ze here is seeking you out for some matters,” said Jin Yihang devilishly.

The large man next to him stared at Jian Wushuang and asked, “So, this man is whom you said easily defeated four Peak Earth Ultimate Gods while still only at the High-level Earth Ultimate God realm—the Northern Darkstar Territory Lord? He has obviously reached Peak Earth Ultimate God according to his aura.”

“It’s him, but his aura... Perhaps he just made a breakthrough to that level very recently,” said Jin Yihang.

The large man called Qing Ze heartily laughed. “Breakthrough? Great! Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord, right? My name is Qing Ze. I heard from Inspector Jin that you’re a supremely capable and talented fighter—able to easily crush four Peak Ultimate Gods while still a High-level Earth Ultimate God. However, I have yet to witness those occurrences with my own eyes, so I don’t really believe what I’ve heard, hence I asked Inspector Jin to bring me here to meet you.

“I’m here at quite the right timing as your current ability must be even higher than I initially thought since you have made a breakthrough to Peak Earth Ultimate God. Come, let’s have a duel!”

Qing Ze stared at Jian Wushuang like a hunter eyeing his prey.

Jian Wushuang’s expression turned dark—he had finally figured it out.

Qing Ze was someone Jin Yihang brought over to seek troubles.

It was most probably because he was unhappy about the fact of being defeated twice previously, hence he was looking for a chance to take back his pride.

Jin Yihang brought a Heaven Ultimate God along as an Earth Ultimate God was not sufficient to lay a hand on him. There were a dozen Crimson Stone Fort Heaven Ultimate Gods who were guarding the mineral vein and it was very easy to seek out one of them after all.

“My ability isn’t as strong as the Inspector described, but I’m happy to indulge Mr. Qing Ze if you so wish,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Haha, great!” Qing Ze immediately laughed. “Let’s just do it here.”

“Sure.” Jian Wushuang did not waste another word and immediately with his mind... Ring! Ring! Ring! Ring!

Infernal Crimson Divine Swords that were shrouded by Samsara Strength appeared in the void one by one.

There were a total of nine swords with each stirring the void and forming multiple Reincarnation Passages.

“Go!”

The nine Infernal Blood Divine Swords charged right at Qing Ze like nine humongous asteroids as Jian Wushuang pointed.

He could already easily defeat a Peak Ultimate God with that move before even making a breakthrough to Earth Ultimate God with his full strength. His divine power had increased incredibly since reaching the Earth Ultimate God level, hence the energy from the same move had surged ten times more than previous!

The nine asteroids arrived before Qing Ze in the blink of an eye with terrifyingly overpowering momentum.

“His energy is pretty strong for sure.”

Qing Ze’s eyes were shining fervently as he took a step forward with divine power violently gathered in his hand. He began throwing out a series of explosive punches as the Heaven Ultimate God divine power energy burst outward.
