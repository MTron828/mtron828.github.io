Chapter 1493: Number Twenty Of The Universe God Ranking List!

Inside a cave created by special gems in the Lineage of Star.

Hall Master Yuan and the ten deacons of the Lineage of Star had gathered together.

“Everyone, this is the most updated Universe God ranking list by the Vientiane Tower, please take a look,” Hall Master Yuan smiled and passed down a ranking list.

The deacons looked through the ranking list.

After some time, they focused their attention on the name in the twentieth position of the Universe God ranking list.

“Jian Wushuang is ranked twenty on the Universe God ranking list?”

“Jian Wushaung? That little kid in our Lineage of Star?”

“Number twenty, how can this be?”

After the deacons had seen the rankings, none of them were able to remain calm.

“Jian Wushuang. During the previous battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace, we saw him display his outstanding talent among the disciples who were Universe Gods of the Second Heaven. After he made a breakthrough and became a Universe God of the Third Heaven later on, we thought that he would still need a period of time before he could get into the Universe God ranking list. But now… In less than five thousand years, he got into the Universe God ranking list. Moreover, he got into the twentieth place straight away?”

“According to our information, Jian Wushuang defeated the Seven Planet Palace Master. We know that although the Seven Planet Palace Master belonged to the lowest end of the Real Gods, he was still a genuine Real God.”

“Haha, top twenty of the Universe God ranking list. How long has it been since a genius disciple who could get into the top twenty of the Universe God ranking list appeared in the Lineage of Star? The previous appearance of such a disciple was three million years ago. When Elder Wu was still a Universe God, he got into the top twenty of the Universe God ranking list before. I remember that Elder Wu was ranked nineteenth back then, one rank above Jian Wushuang now.”

“That Elder Wu remained Universe God of the Third Heaven for a total of three hundred thousand years. Moreover, it was only because of him obtaining many opportunities and treasures that he got into the nineteenth position of the Universe God ranking list. However, how long has it been since Jian Wushuang made a breakthrough to the Universe God of the Third Heaven? Comparing talent, it is obvious that he is more talented than Elder Wu.”

“This little kid has an unimaginable future.”

Many deacons were gasping with admiration and the whole cave was filled with delighted laughter and cheerful voices.

As for Hall Master Yuan, who was the leader, he was also over the moon.

Previously, he knew that Jian Wushuang had killed ten Real Gods in the Sky Sword Prison and thought that Jian Wushuang had fighting capabilities to get into the top thirty of the Universe God ranking list. However, looking at it at then, Jian Wushuang was obviously stronger than he had thought.

“It is rare for such a genius to appear in the Lineage of Star. This is great news. However, keep in mind that we must always protect Jian Wushuang. After all, although the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries at moment look peaceful, they have actually been doing something behind the scenes. The Lineage of Star also has some dangerous enemies. Hence, there is no guarantee that they will not lay their hands on the geniuses of our Lineage of Star and, naturally, Jian Wushuang will be the first to be affected,” Hall Master Yuan warned.

“Naturally.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

All the deacons present nodded their heads in succession.

The Lineage of Star had always paid great attention to their disciples, especially the most outstanding Star Palace disciples. Hence, there should be no problem in terms of protection.

“By the way, Jian Wushuang himself might not even know the news about him making into the twentieth position of the Universe God ranking list. Let me send him a message,” Hall Master Yuan chuckled and sent this piece of news to Jian Wushuang, who had just returned to the Lineage of Star.

Inside a secret room in the Sword Star, the complete list of the Universe God ranking list was floating in front of Jian Wushuang.

In particular, he was looking at his own introduction.

“Jian Wushuang… In the Heavenly Sky Summit, he defeated Ling Dan, who was ranked thirty-ninth on the Universe God ranking list, with one stroke. Afterwards, he had an intense battle with the Seven Planet Palace Master, a Real God expert. He pushed back the Seven Planet Palace Master throughout the whole battle and finally defeated him in the end. Such powerful abilities have allowed him to get into the top twenty of the Universe God ranking list.”

“However, as he has never fought with the other top twenty experts, he will be ranked in the twentieth position in the Universe God ranking list temporarily!”

…

“Ranked twentieth temporarily?” Jian Wushuang felt strange.

“Jian Wushuang, with the abilities that you displayed, you should be able to get into the sixteenth or seventeenth position of Universe God ranking list. However, you have never fought with an expert in the sixteenth and seventeenth position. In addition, the Vientiane Tower has always been conservative when it comes to the ranking of the Universe God ranking list. Hence, they only placed you at the twentieth position.”

“Afterall, if they had placed you in the sixteenth or seventeenth place based on your fighting results, they would be unable to get the trust of everyone. However, by placing you at the twentieth position, no one will say anything.”

“As for the temporary part, the Vientiane Tower probably hope that you will come across experts that are of a higher rank and, after going through a fight, they will raise your ranking,” the King of Venomous Worms’ voice echoed in Jian Wushuang’s head.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang understood.

Back then when he had fought with the Seven Planet Palace Master, he had more or less used his full power. Although he still had trump cards remaining, there were not many of them…

If he had shown all his trump cards, there might be a chance that his fighting capabilities would bring him into the top fifteen of the Universe God ranking list.

However, top fifteen was his limit. He still lacked the power to get into the top ten.

“According to the information on the Universe God ranking list, the top ten experts of the list have have accomplished the feat of killing a Real God,” Jian Wushuang clicked his tongue.

He had also killed Real Gods. However, the Real Gods that he had killed were those whose Divine Power was restricted and they were unable to display their full prowess. Hence, it was different.

As for the Real Gods that the experts in the top ten of the Universe God ranking list had killed, all of them were able to release their power to its full extent. However, they were still killed in the end.

Therefore, it could be seen how frightening the ten people in the top ten of the Universe God ranking list were.

The Universe God ranking list had also named them the ‘Ten Monsters’!

“Compared to the ten monsters in the top ten of the Universe God ranking list, I am still quite a distance away right now. Moreover, I am merely a Universe God of the Second Heaven. There is still room for my abilities to rise,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

He was extremely confident in his own abilities.

The Jian Wushuang of the very moment was under the restriction of being a Universe God of the Second Heaven. Hence, his Unique Skills could no longer be improved. Otherwise, he might be able to compete with the Ten Monsters.

Moreover, as soon as he got past the Third Heaven’s Inverse Cultivation Test and become a real Universe God of the Third Heaven, he would be able to go against the Ten Monsters easily.

“My journey is still long. Let me continue to train,” Jian Wushuang giggled and put the Universe God ranking list away.

As for that Ling Dan.

Previously, after taking one stroke of Jian Wushuang’s, he was seriously wounded. However, he did not die. Due to the fact that he had fought a few times previously, the audience took note of him. The experts of the Vientiane Tower also felt that Ling Dan had the fighting capabilities to get into the top forties of the Universe God ranking list. Hence, he was ranked thirty-ninth.

For the next period of time, be it the Lineage of Star or the movements in the outside world as a result of getting news about Jian Wushuang, Jian Wushuang did not bother about them.

He stayed on the Sword Star to meditate in seclusion so that he could train.

In the blink of an eye, another four hundred years passed.

The battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace in the Lineage of Star had arrived.
