“Light King?”

Even Jian Wushuang could not help exclaiming in his heart when he heard the name. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

With his current strength, any Invincible Saint could easily suppress him, and an expert like Su Xie, who was ranked on the True Saint List, could easily crush him. As for Light King, he was number one on the True Saint List, the most powerful Immortal Saint in this era!

He was indeed far from the Light King.

“To be able to combine the two principles at the Immortal Saint Realm and cultivate the soul at the same time, the Light King is really amazing,” Jian Wushuang thought.

“Well, let’s continue.”

Soon, the six of them continued to fly toward the center of the Blood Wave Realm.

…

In the void not far from the battlefield, the people from the Destruction Saint Realm and the Illusionary Moon Sect gathered there, their faces extremely ugly.

“Thunder God, I’m sorry. Under such circumstances, we can only leave,” Su Xie said seriously.

“I understand.” Thunder God nodded without any intention of blaming him.

It was true that the Illusory Moon Sect had retreated first, but he also knew that they had to leave at that critical moment.

Although there were five people in the Illusory Moon Sect, Su Xie was the only Invincible Saint and the other four were only Peak Saints. The four Peak Saints had no ability to resist Jian Wushuang at all, in just a short moment, their divine bodies had been destroyed, and the divine body of the ice master had been destroyed twice.

If they did not run away and continued to stand, none of the four Peak Saints would survive.

Moreover, the main purpose of this assassination was to kill Jian Wushuang.

However, with Jian Wushuang’s escape skill, they could not kill him, so they had to leave.

“Although Heavenly Sword Marquis is not very strong and any Invincible Saint can easily suppress him, his escape art is too terrifying. Thunder God, if you want to attack him, you must find a way to restrict his escape art. Otherwise, no one can kill him. As for us, we will leave first,” Su Xie said.

“Thank you,” Thunder God said and watched the five people of the Illusory Moon Sect leave.

After the people of the Illusionary Moon Sect left, Thunder God immediately contacted the higher-ups of the Destruction Saint Realm.

In the grand hall.

“Failed?” The eyes of Sky Nether Master flashed with coldness as he stared at Thunder God’s consciousness incarnation.

“Yes, everything was expected. I didn’t expect that Heavenly Sword Marquis to have mastered an extremely strange escape technique. He can escape the soul detection of the Invincible Saint. He can hide in the dark and assassinate us time and time again, but we can only watch helplessly. We have no choice but to retreat temporarily,” Thunder God said.

“Escape art? What kind of escape art can hide from your soul detection? Do you have a mirror image of him performing the escape art?” The Nether Sky Master asked.

“Yes.” Thunder God waved his hand, and a mirror image immediately appeared in the hall.

This mirror image was the scene of Jian Wushuang performing the shadowless escape art and ambushing the Peak Saints time and time again.

Nether Sky Master’s pupils shrank after looking at it for a while.

“Even the soul of the Invincible Saint couldn’t detect it. This escape art…should be the shadowless escape art of the Blood Blade Master,” Nether Sky Master said in a low voice, “I didn’t expect that Heavenly Sword Marquis had mastered the famous means of the Blood Blade Master. No wonder you couldn’t do anything to him.”

“Blood Blade Master?” Thunder God was puzzled.

“Many years ago, an extremely terrifying existence was a top-notch assassin. At that time, his assassination methods were so terrifying that even I felt a little scared when facing his assassination methods,” Sky Nether Master said.

Hearing this, Thunder God was greatly shocked.

He knew very well what kind of supreme existence Sky Nether Master was. He stood at the top among the Principles Masters. However, he himself admitted that the assassination methods of Blood Blade Master were extremely terrifying, from this, one could imagine how powerful the assassination methods of the Blood Blade Master were.

“This Heavenly Sword Marquis is only at the level of a True Saint, and he is only a rank six True Saint. Even if he has mastered the shadowless escape technique, he has only just entered the rudiments. I’m afraid that he hasn’t even reached the initial stage. As long as it is a Peak Saint who specializes in the soul, he should be able to sense his position with just the rudiments of the shadowless escape technique,” said Sky Nether Master.

“Among all the Saints we went to kill, junior brother Mo Xin is the only one who specializes in the soul. Unfortunately, he was killed by Heavenly Sword Marquis and Di Hao from the very beginning. That’s why the following scene happened,” Thunder God said.

“I understand. You can go,” Sky Nether master said.

“Lord Sky Nether, that Heavenly Sword Marquis…” Thunder God frowned.

“I have my own plans. Just wait for my news in the Blood Wave Realm. Before I send you a message, don’t act rashly, and don’t go looking for trouble with Heavenly Sword Marquis.” Sky Nether Master said.

“Yes.” Thunder God responded, and his consciousness avatar quickly disappeared.

…

Blood Wave Realm.

After traveling continuously, the six people of the Temporal Temple finally arrived at the central area of the Blood Wave Realm.

Once they reached the center, there were obviously more experts.

Countless Peak Saints gathered in the Blood Wave Realm. They would arrive at the center as soon as possible and wait for the birth of the Blood Wave Token.

Jian Wushuang and the others came early, but even so, there were still many people waiting in the center. Jian Wushuang and the others found a random place in the center and stopped, many experts nearby had noticed their presence.

“These six people should be from the Temporal Temple, right?”

“Yes, they are from the Temporal Temple. The leader of them is the cold man with a giant axe on his back. He is Di Hao, ranked eighth on the True Saint List. I heard that Di Hao is very powerful!”

“Apart from Di Hao, Qian Hongzi, Yue Yu, and Feixue are also quite famous. I’ve never heard of the other two.”

Many experts were secretly discussing.

Among the six people of the Temporal Temple, Di Hao was the most famous, followed by Qian Hongzi, Yue Yu, and Feixue. As for Jian Wushuang and Duan Lang, they were not very famous.

Jian Wushuang only attracted people’s attention because he emitted the aura of a rank six True Saint.

At this moment…

Whoosh!

A figure suddenly shot out from the void not far away and stopped in front of the six people of the Temporal Temple.

The person who came was a young man wearing a blood-red robe and carrying a blood-red battle saber on his back. His entire person looked extremely demonic. The eyes of this demonic man flickered with a trace of blood-red light. After arriving, he directly looked toward Di Hao..
