Chapter 857: The Last Treasure

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After the auction of the first treasure, the second one was displayed.

It was a magic weapon in the shape of a Giant Axe.

This cyan Giant Axe gave off an extremely terrifying aura the instant it was placed on the exhibition shelf.

Even the Dao Masters in the VIP rooms changed their look.

“Emperor Weapon! In addition, it’s not an ordinary one.”

“Such strong power. It must be a peak level Emperor Weapon.”

“Oh gosh. The first treasure was a token from the Heartless Divine Palace and the second one is a peak-level Emperor Weapon?”

“It’s a good stuff. Unfortunately, I’m not proficient with a Giant Axe, so it’s not useful for me.”

Lots of people sighed on the second floor.

An Emperor Weapon was extremely useful, even for a Dao Master.

The higher-level Emperor Weapons were even more useful.

The only regret was that this Emperor Weapon was a Giant Axe while only three or four top experts chose to use a Giant Axe as their weapon.

“I’ll get this magic weapon, whatever it takes!”

“This Giant Axe will be mine.”

“Go get more Divine Gems from our tribe, quickly. I’ve decided to buy this Giant Axe.”

The experts who chose the Giant Axe as their weapon were almost going crazy over it.

A peak-level Emperor Weapon could only be found by depending on luck. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for them. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Before long, they started bidding crazily on this magic weapon.

In the market, an ordinary Emperor Weapon cost hundreds of millions of Divine Gems. The price of an Emperor Weapon at the peak level was definitely ten times more than that.

In the end, this peak-level Emperor Weapon was sold at an astonishing price of 6.8 billion Divine Gems.

After the first and second treasure finished being auctioned off at a breathtaking price, the last one appeared.

When the black-robed elder took out the last treasure, the hearts of many people in the auction seemed to skip a beat.

The first treasure sold for 2.4 billion Divine Gems while the second sold for 6.8 billion Divine Gems.

The third one, which was also the last one, must be even more precious and valuable. How much would it be?

The third treasure the black-robed elder took out was three paintings.

Yes, three ordinary paintings.

However, everyone present knew that it must be extraordinary since it was the last treasure.

“Everyone, this is the last treasure today. The three paintings you see are actually a set of formations. To be exact, it’s a sword formation,” the black-robed elder explained.

“Sword Formation?” His words caused a stir among the crowd.

Jian Wushuang also watched it attentively.

Xue Lingtian mentioned that the gift for him would be sold at auction. The previous treasures meant nothing to him, while the last treasure was a sword formation related to Sword Principle. Was it…

“This sword formation is called the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation,” the black-robed elder paused deliberately with a smile on his face.

As he expected, the name of the sword formation caused a stir on the second floor of the auction house.

“Ninth-heaven Sword Formation. It’s the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation!”

“It, it…”

“Go, return to the tribe and collect plenty of Divine Gems for me. The Ninth-heaven Sword Formation has appeared. I have to get it no matter the price!”

The experts in the VIP rooms on the second floor were astonished.

Even those Dao Masters who were not good at Sword Principle and had no need for the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation had heard of its name.

They had not expected that the last treasure in the auction was the legendary Ninth-heaven Sword Formation!

As the experts on the second floor had a wide array of knowledge, they knew the origin of the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation. But the ordinary Warriors on the first floor were very confused.

They, including Jian Wushuang, had no idea what the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation was and had never heard of it.

The black-robed elder continued the introduction, “The Ninth-heaven Sword Formation is a very complicated and strong sword formation, which was created by two extraordinary experts.”

“One of them was a supreme expert who ranks first in Sword Principle, Sunrise Sword Emperor!”

Sunrise Sword Emperor!

When the name was spoken from the mouth of the black-robed elder, the entire auction house immediately began to seethe.

“Sunrise Sword Emperor?”

“The number one Sword Cultivator in the Eternal World?”

“It was him?”

Many people widened their eyes, stunned.

The Sunrise Sword Emperor was recognized as the number one Sword Cultivator in the Eternal World and enjoyed a great reputation.

Even the four emperors at the peak stage in the Tang of the East were not as famous as him.

In terms of strength, only Empress Qing, who had long been dead, could compete with the Sunrise Sword Emperor.

The other three emperors, Emperor Xiao, Emperor Yun, and Empress Leng were all weaker than him.

The terrifying strength of Sunrise Sword Emperor was imaginable.

In a corner of the first floor of the auction, Jian Wushuang also raised his head when he heard what the black-robed elder said.

“Sunrise Sword Emperor?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

He had received a token from his master, Xuan Yi, which contained three streaks of Sword Essence from the Sunrise Sword Emperor.

He had used the weakest one, which already contained a breathtaking Sword Essence.

He was full of admiration for this Supreme Being known as the number one Sword Cultivator in the Eternal World.

In a VIP room on the second floor of the auction.

“Uncle, is the Sunrise Sword Emperor really so great? Should he be treated so seriously?”

A middle-aged man stood respectfully in front of a white-bearded elder.

They came from a great clan in the Tang of the East, where there were many experts and even four Dao Masters.

This white-bearded elder was the strongest among the four Dao Masters.

In the middle-aged man’s view, as the white-beard elder was so strong and well-known in the Eternal World, he should be comparable to the Sunrise Sword Emperor.

The white-bearded elder smiled bitterly and said, “The Sunrise Sword Emperor? He’s a monster.”

“Many years ago, I met him once and witnessed him killing a Dao Master with only one sword stroke. That Dao Master was much stronger than me. What do you think, is he qualified to be treated seriously?”
