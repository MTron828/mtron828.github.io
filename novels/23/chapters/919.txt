The expectant crowd watched on as Jian Wushuang delivered the third wedding gift.

There was an abrupt buzzing sound as a splendid palace materialized out of thin air in the void of the Drill Ground.

Mighty and majestic aura emanated from the palace, drawing everyone’s attention to it.

Jian Wushuang declared, “this is the third wedding gift, the Magic Weapon Pavilion!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice reverberted in all directions as everyone present looked at the pavilion with some scepticism.

“Magic Weapon Pavilion?”

“What’s the use of such a pavilion?”

“Did anyone notice that the pavilion was taken out from his Interspatial Ring?”

Noise from the chatter echoed through the Drill Ground. Most of the comments reflected the doubts and suspicion of the crowd.

In the upper stand, the top experts furrowed their brows as they glanced at the pavilion.

“This pavilion was taken out from his Interspatial Ring. So, it’s a treasure that he can carry with him at all times. It’s rare, but it can’t be regarded as extremely precious.” An expert blurted.

“The third wedding gift from Jian Wushuang is a portable pavilion?”

“This pavilion can barely compare with a Peak Level Emperor Weapon. It may be more valuable, but as the third wedding gift, it’s not enough.”

“Haha, I thought he would produce a more valuable wedding gift, but this is mediocre.” Xia Yu mocked.

Xia Yu had initially been surprised at the appearance of the Magic Weapon Pavilion in the Drill Ground. He laughed out loud. “Jian Wushuang, this is your third wedding gift? A pavilion?”

“Haha, this pavilion is less valuable than Bodhi Dan. Are you making fun of Emperor Leng by presenting it as your last wedding gift?”

Despite Xia Mang’s sarcastic words,?Jian Wushuang maintained his composure and he continued to smile.

“This is the wedding gift my Master had carefully prepared for me!”

“Today, let me open your eyes!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were lit up with energy.

In the upper stand, Jian Wushuang’s Senior Brother Xue Lingtian’s gaze intensified. “It begins…”

With a serious expression on his face, Jian Wushuang stared at the huge pavilion in front of him and focused his thoughts on it.

“Open!”

The pavilion opened wide in response to Jian Wushuang’s command.

The interior of the pavilion was revealed.

Xia Mang, who had been ridiculing Jian Wushuang a minute ago, froze.

In the upper stand, Xia Yu was also taken aback.

The spectators in the Drill Ground were stunned at the scene inside the Magic Weapon Pavilion.

Within the Magic Weapon Pavilion, there were dense and innumerable exhibition shelves, each piled with countless magic weapons in a neat and orderly fashion.

There were various kinds of magic weapons.

It held all treasures one could imagine, like swords, broadswords, axes, spears, magic weapons and so on.

Most importantly, these magic weapons possessed extremely tough and strong auras.

The auras had different characters, ranging from from hostile and brutal, dark and cold, and sacred.

All of these weapons had reached Emperor Weapon Level.

The Magic Weapon Pavilion turned out to be a huge Treasure Vault filled with numerous Emperor Weapons!

It was composed entirely of countless Emperor Weapons!

Everyone was shocked.

Jian Wushuang, who had remained standing in front of Magic Weapon Pavilion, took a deep breath and opened his mouth slowly.

His voice was cold, but every word resounded like the beat of a drum.

“Magic Weapon Pavilion contains innumerable Emperor Weapons!”

“This includes 2,631 sword Emperor Weapons!”

“1,594 Broadsword Emperor Weapons!”

“1,423 spear Emperor Weapons!”

“1,080 axe Emperor Weapons!”

“Stick Emperor Weapons…”

…

“In total, there are 13,799 Emperor Weapons!

“Counting the Magic Weapon Pavilion, which is comparable to a Peak Emperor Weapon, there are exactly 13,800 Emperor Weapons!”

“This is the third wedding gift that I have specially prepared to marry Her Royal Highness.”

At the end of his declaration, Jian Wushuang’s voice was close to a roar.

His hands were also tightly clenched, and his eyes were filled with unprecedented energy and light.

A total of 13,800 magic weapons, and all were Emperor Weapons!

He believed that his incredible wedding gift would override all others in the Selection Ceremony.

“Xia Clan?”

“Magic Cloud Valley?”

“I will see if the so-called Magic Cloud Valley relics are superior to my 13,800 Emperor Weapons!”

Jian Wushuang’s heart was howling.

There was dead silence!

An eerie silence had descended in the Drill Ground.

The only sound that could be heard was that of the accelerated pulses of the experts present.

The experts present stared at the massive magic weapons in the Magic Weapon Pavilion. Shock turned to panic, and then to fury and madness.

More than half of the top experts in the stand couldn’t help standing up.

Even Xia Yu from Xia Clan stood up.

Jian Wushuang’s words continued to echo in their heads.

13,800!

They were not merely 13,8000 Divine Weapons or Eternal Weapons, but 13,800 Emperor Weapons!

Those were precious Emperor Weapons, which would be highly valued even by Dao Masters!

They had also realised that many of the Emperor Weapons had reached Advanced Level or even Peak Level.

13,800!

It was the sheer number of weapons that made all present tremble in shock and disbelief.

This was an unprecedented and unbelievable wedding gift!

Everyone was stunned by the number of Emperor Weapons in the Magic Weapon Pavilion.

All were stupefied.

But this was normal. After all, when Xue Lingtian received this wedding gift, even the experienced Bone King who had wandered around with Eight-star Imperial God was freaking out.

“Hum, all of you are surprised?”

Witch King gloated and hummed in the body of Jian Wushuang. He was pleased at the reaction of the crowd.

He was certain that Jian Wushuang’s wedding gift was unparalleled enough to shock the whole world!
