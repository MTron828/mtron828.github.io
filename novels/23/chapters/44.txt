Chapter 45: Gold-Dragon Palace

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

On the official road to the Dark Forest in Tiannan Province,

“Boy, in front of you is Qingdong City. Due to its proximity to the Dark Forest, the forces of Qingdong city became entangled. Some of them may be the forces of Gold-Dragon Palace and, of course, there are also some spies from Blood Feather Tower. Because of this, you need to keep a low profile when you go into the city. ” Sima Bu took a conical straw hat from his Gold-Dragon Ring, handing it to Jian Wushuang.

Carrying the Long Sword, Jian Wushuang, whose clothes were in tatters, took it and wore it without hesitation.

Compared to four months ago when he just entered the Dark Forest, Jian Wushuang obviously appeared a little calmer and his skin had also turned much darker. Because of this, his innocent appearance had vanished.

In the city, Jian Wushuang wore a conical straw hat that slightly covered his face. Although he knew that Qingdong City was already within the region of Tiannan Province, and the intelligence system of Blood Feather Tower was certainly not as good as Tianyan Province, Jian Wushaung was still cautious.

Led by Sima Bu, the two quickly arrived in front of a magnificent loft.

A gold dragon hovered over the rooftops of the gigantic loft, in front of which two men were standing there coldly. Then Sima Bu brought Jian Wushuang inside.

A large number of Warriors were in the loft and most of them, like Sima Bu, were wearing a gold ring, apparently symbolizing that they were Gold-Dragon Guards.

“Boy, wait for me for a while. I’m going to turn in the task.” Sima Bu said.

“Okay.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and then slightly raised his head, looking around at those Gold-Dragon Guards, who seemed to be drinking wine and chatting very casually. Yet, he could feel their subtle killing intent.

“Brother Bu was right. Gold-Dragon Guards, all of them are dangerous killers, who often engage in life-and-death struggles!” Jian Wushuang whispered.

“It took more than four months to finally fulfill the task.” Sima Bu came back to where Jian Wushuang was, carrying a pot of wine, then he said, “Boy, I took the task in the first place for the purpose of helping Ji Wuyue. As for bringing you, it was just out of convenience. Now my mission has been completed, so from here on you are on your own.”

“Thank you for all your help in these four months, Brother Bu.” Jian Wushuang nodded with gratitude deep down inside. Sima Bu really gave him a lot of assistance and Jian Wushuang secretly kept that favor in mind.

“Ha-ha, it’s nothing. Oh, yes. What do you intend to do next?” Sima Bu looked at him and asked.

“I want to be a Gold-Dragon Guard.” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“Oh?” Sima Bu smiled, and said with a raised brow, “I knew that was the choice you would make.”

“Gold-Dragon Guard is an occupation that walks on the edge of life and death, making it easier to hone real experts, dangerous as it is. Besides, judging from your actions in the Dark Forest, your craziness makes you suitable to be a Gold-Dragon Guard.

However, the Gold-Dragon Guard is divided into several different levels, such as One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard, Two-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard, Three-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard, and Golden-Dragon Ambassador, which is the highest level. Considering your current strength, at most, you can complete the task required to become a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard.”

“Yes, I see,” said Jian Wushuang while nodding.

Jian Wushuang often asked Bu about a variety of things those four months in the Dark Forest. Naturally, that included questions about the Gold-Dragon Guard. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Gold-Dragon Guard was an occupation with high requirements.

To even become a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard, the lowest level, one must at least reach the peak of the Profound Transforming Sea Realm.

In addition, to become a Gold-Dragon Guard, you had to complete a task assigned by Gold-dragon Palace. These tasks were extremely difficult and the chance of failure was high.

“With your current strength, as long as you are careful and not too impulsive, you have the ability to complete the task and become a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard. It isn’t supposed to be difficult.” Sima Bu laughed.

Witnessing Jian Wushuang’s growth, step by step, for four months, Sima Bu was definitely aware of his strength.

“Follow me, I’ll take you to sign up and accept the task of a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard,” said Sima Bu.

Jian Wushuang nodded. Then Sima Bu brought him to the counter in the attic, in front of which was a grey-robed elder with silver hair and half-squinting his eyes, who looked like he might fall asleep.

“Mr. Huo,” said Sima Bu with reverence. “My little brother wants to take on the task of a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard.”

The old man in gray looked up slightly, glancing at Jian Wushuang with his half-squinting eyes, and said indifferently, “What’s your name?”

“With regard to my name…” Jian Wushuang touched his nose, the corners of his mouth curling upwards as he said, “just call me Swordsman.”

“Swordsman?” Sima Bu cast a glance at Jian Wushuang and burst out in laughter.

“Take this token and come here again three days from now.” The grey-robed elder threw a Wooden-token with a Gold-Dragon Mark to Jian Wushuang and then turned around without giving Jian Wushuang a second glance.

“Is it that simple?” Jian Wushuang took the Wooden-token with great surprise.

“What do you think? Go!” said Sima Bu, smiling as they walked back.

“This is Mr. Bu, right? Haven’t seen you for many years. I didn’t expect to meet you here today,” said someone, with a clear and unpleasant tone of voice. Hearing this, Jian Wushuang saw a black-robed man with a cold face and bird-eyes coming over, followed by a purple-haired man.

“Zhu Tao.” Sima Bu picked his eyebrow, coldly smiling as he said, “Long time no see.”

Zhu Tao, his bird-eyes flashing with a ray of coldness, then looked to the grey-robed elder by the counter.

“Mr. Huo, this is my disciple, Dongfang Yu. He is here to accept the task of a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard,” Zhu Tao said humbly.

“Take this token and come back here in three days.” The grey-robed elder still spoke coldly and also gave the purple-haired man a Wooden-token with the Gold-dragon Mark.

Zhu Tao turned around and his eyes swept the room, only to see the Wooden-token in the hands of Jian Wushuang. The corners of his mouth quirked up as he said indifferently, “Mr. Bu, the one who is behind you is your disciple? It seems that he has already taken the task of a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard, too. What a coincidence!”

“This is one of my little brothers, called Swordsman, not my disciple,” Sima Bu said directly.

“Is he not your disciple?” Zhu Tao was laughing, then turned around and looked at the purple-robed man, “My disciple, this is your Great Master, Mr. Bu, whom I often mentioned, and the one next to him is one of his ‘little brothers.’ You may as well say hello to his ‘little brother.’ After all, you are going to work together to accomplish the One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard mission. ”

“Yes.” The purple-robed man nodded, then looked directly at Jian Wushuang. The corners of his mouth at this moment quirked up as he said, “Swordsman? My name is Dongfang Yu. I wonder if you have the courage to fight with me! ”
