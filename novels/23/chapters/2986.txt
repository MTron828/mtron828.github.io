Chapter 2987: ‘Gold-Splitting Secret Manual’

——

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed again.

Indeed, he felt that it was getting harder and harder to create a new sword skill.

For example, the space-time sword skill had a huge threshold from the seventh movement. Every time he wanted to create a new sword skill, it was extremely difficult.

After the ninth move, the first move, the storm, it was even more difficult to create the tenth move.

“Sir Mo Shan, to tell you the truth, I do have the idea to create the embryonic form of swordsmanship, but I have never received the guidance of an expert in the sword principle of a mission, and there is nothing I can do indirectly. It’s too difficult to create the embryonic form of swordsmanship,” Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice.

“Learn from it?” Mo Shan smiled. “It’s easy to learn from it. There are all kinds of secret manuals on sword principle in the Treasure Pavilion of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Many of them can be used as a reference for you. I know a secret manual that will be of great help to you.”

“Which secret manual?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“This secret manual is called the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual. It was created many years ago by an expert named Gold-Splitting.” Mo Shan smiled.

“Gold-Splitting?” Jian Wushuang’s expression did not change. Obviously, he had never heard of it.

“Gold-Splitting, the Gold-Splitting Master. When he was alive, he was very famous in the Divine Beginning World. Not only was he a Rule Master, but he was also one of the top Rule Masters, second only to the Legendary Saint Realm Master,” Mo Shan explained.

“And this Gold-Splitting Master was a Rule Master who had completely comprehended the laws of time and space. In addition, his forte was also Sword Dao. The void sword technique he created was one of the top sword techniques in the Divine Beginning Realm. Although it still focused on cutting and tearing, this sword technique also involved many aspects.”

“The ‘Gold-Splitting Secret Manual’ was the precious legacy left behind by the Gold-Splitting Master. During this period, not only did it contain his own void sword technique, but it also included his understanding of the laws of time and space as well as sword techniques. He even dissected the laws of time and space and Sword Dao in great detail and recorded them in the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual.”

“For example, he dissected the first stage of the space-time rule, the space-time illusion body, and the second stage, the space-time blade, into a total of 1,000 copies. Each copy represented a space-time blade, which was extremely detailed. It was the same with the sword principle. It even included how to combine the space-time rule and sword principle perfectly. It was explained in detail in the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual.”

Upon hearing Mo Shan’s words, Jian Wushuang’s eyes became fervent.

Previously, when he was in the Treasure Pavilion, he had no idea what to look for, so he had no idea where to start.

But now, after hearing Mo Shan’s ‘Gold-splitting secret manual’…

The space-time rule was perfectly combined with the sword principle, and he even dissected it perfectly, including the void swordsmanship created by the Gold-Splitting Master.

Just by listening to this secret manual, Jian Wushuang knew that it was very useful to him!

Whether it was comprehending the space-time rule, comprehending the sword principle, or even creating the embryonic form of the swordsmanship, it could be of great use.

“Master Mo Shan, the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual is so amazing. Its value must be very shocking, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course the complete Gold-Splitting Secret Manual is precious, but as far as I know, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance has long divided the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual into four volumes so that the experts of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance can have more opportunities to exchange for treasures. If It’s a single volume, its value should not be much higher. As for how much it is worth, you have to ask Master Tianshou,” Mo Shan said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly, but in his heart, he also noticed how Mo Shan addressed Sir Tianshuo.

Mo Shan, as a Rule Master, also called Sir Tianshuo respectfully. Obviously, Sir Tianshuo’s status in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance was much higher than that of an ordinary Rule Master.

“In fact, it’s very easy to learn from him. The most important thing is still guidance!” Mo Shan suddenly became serious. “Having an expert by your side to guide you and blindly exploring and cultivating alone are two completely different things.”

Jian Wushuang understood.

He did not deny this point.

With an expert’s personal guidance, people could avoid many detours and unnecessary steps. They could spend all their time changing places, so they would naturally grow faster.

“Little guy, I have already introduced that I come from the Three Palaces of Heaven-cleaving. The Three Palaces of Heaven-cleaving are full of geniuses, and there are countless experts. Any genius disciple who joins the Three Palaces of Heaven-cleaving will receive the greatest amount of training and will naturally receive the best guidance!”

“Do you want to go to the Three Palaces of Heaven-cleaving with me?” Mo Shan looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was a little excited, but his pupils suddenly shrank, and he suddenly woke up.

“This Mo Shan…”

On the surface, Jian Wushuang still looked the same, but he was secretly surprised.

He had guessed that this important figure from the headquarters of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance came to him, probably because he valued his talent and wanted to invite him to join the Three Palaces of Heaven-cleaving.

He had been keeping an eye out for him.

However, when he saw Mo Shan, the latter did not mention this matter at all. Instead, he was very friendly and did not put on any airs as he gave him some pointers and suggestions. These pointers and suggestions were indeed helpful to him.

In particular, Mo Shan told him about the ‘Gold-Splitting Secret Manual’, which made him very moved. It made him very grateful to Mo Shan.

However, Mo Shan changed the topic and asked him to join the Three Heavens-cleaving Palaces in a different way…he was so tempted that he almost agreed.

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang said solemnly, “Master Mo Shan, I’m sorry. I don’t plan to join the Three Heaven-cleaving Palaces for the time being.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Oh?” Mo Shan narrowed his eyes and looked surprised. “Little guy, I know that two geniuses of the Heaven and Earth Palace have invited you, but they are only disciples of the Heaven and Earth Palace. They don’t know much about the Three Palaces. Moreover, with your talent, it’s possible for you to enter the strongest Chaos Palace. The resources that the disciples of the Chaos Palace have are far beyond those of the Heaven and Earth Palace and the Primitive Palace. The two little guys don’t know about it, so they can’t explain it to you.”

“But I can tell you one by one…”

Mo Shan was ready to tell Jian Wushuang some of the resources that the disciples of the Chaos Palace had.

But before he could start, Jian Wushuang shook his head and refused. “I’m sorry, Master Mo Shan, I really don’t want to join the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces.”

Mo Shan frowned and did not continue.

He took a deep look at Jian Wushuang. “Little Guy, you have to think carefully. According to the rules of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, as long as you were rejected once, you won’t be invited again. I came here personally because of your amazing talent. If you refuse me, then in the future…”
