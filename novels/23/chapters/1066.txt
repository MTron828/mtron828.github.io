Chapter 1067: Constitution of Sword Spirit

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“It has been a long time. Have a drink!”

Jian Nantian took out a jug of wine and handed it to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang accepted the jug and took a huge swig of it without hesitation. Then, he started asking his father what had happened to him in the past 2,000 years.

“Father, are you really the Samsara Temple Master’s personal disciple?” he asked curiously.

“Yes.”

Jian Nantian smiled as he continued, “1,000 years ago, Master began paying attention to me after I made great breakthrough within a short time. When I became the Rank Five Reincarnator, he took me in as his personal disciple. Since then, he had patiently instructed me and even sent me to a Secret Land at great cost. That’s how I have made such rapid progress in such a short period.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang raised an eyebrow.

“I intended to go to the Void Continent to seek you after freeing your mother but I didn’t expect you to find me first,” Jian Nantian said with a smile.

In terms of the speed of growth, Jian Wushuang was much faster than him.

He was well aware of this.

Owing to his experience, he was more powerful than his son now. He had narrowly escaped death many times during the tournaments in the Samsara Temple. After becoming the Samsara Temple Master’s personal disciple, he had received his Master’s guidance on cultivation and lots of useful resources. Yet, his son had improved his strength on his own.

Most importantly, he had been to the Secret Land.

He had stayed in the Secret Land for 1,000 years, which was equivalent to him spending 100,000 years on his cultivation.

That was the reason behind his strong power and profound swordsmanship. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

What about Jian Wushuang?

He had traveled in the Void Continent alone and gradually enhanced his strength. In the span of over 2,000 years, he grew from a little lad from the Ancient World into a well-known expert in the Green Fire World. His growth speed was much more amazing compared to his father.

“Jian Wushuang, your father who possesses the constitution of Sword Spirit, had great potential in cultivation. However…” Gu King’s regretful voice resounded in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“Go on!” Jian Wushuang said. “What’s the constitution of Sword Spirit?”

“The constitution of Sword Spirit is a rare constitution,” Gu King replied. “You know that magic weapons have spirits.”

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang responded with a little nod.

He had learned that magic weapons possessed spirits, and that the higher the magic weapon ranked, the stronger its spirit was.

“Magic weapons all have spirits, and some high-level ones even have their own consciousness,” Gu King explained. “When magic weapons with consciousnesses realize that they’re about to be destroyed, their intelligence will escape. Most of their intelligence will vanish while some will enter other magic weapons.”

“The last case is the rarest one. The intelligence of the high-level magic weapon will enter a person’s body and integrate with his flesh and consciousness. That’s how the constitution of spirit comes to be.”

“Your father belongs to the last case and thus, boasts the constitution of Sword Spirit. The intelligence of a magic sword must have combined with your father’s body.”

Jian Wushuang looked amazed.

“Father owns the constitution of Sword Spirit because his body and a magic sword’s intelligence have combined?”

Gu King then continued, “The constitution of Sword Spirit is rare in the Eternal Chaotic World. Talent and potential in Sword Principle come instinctively to people with such constitution. You can even go as far as to say they’re born to be a sword itself.”

“They can easily fathom Sword Principles and are real Sword Principle geniuses.”

“The Sword Spirit that entered your father’s body is a high-level spirit and your father was meant to make remarkable achievements. His potential was promising, though not as excellent as yours. Unfortunately, his foundation was injured when he was young, which greatly weakened his potential,” Gu King said, shaking his head.

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened with disappointment.

It occurred to him that his father had taken the Reversal Red Scorching Elixir to recover his strength at a critical moment in the Ancient World back then. The side-effect of the elixir was that his potential for cultivation would be limited and the impact of it was great on Jian Nantian.

Besides, Jian Wushuang also knew that Jiu Xiu had extracted one of his father’s Sword Souls.

One’s Sword Soul was the origin and foundation of his Sword Principle.

The first Sword Soul which Jian Nantian had awakened was crucial to him but it was stolen by Jiu Xiu. It was a great blow to him.

The two consecutive injuries had greatly impaired Jian Nantian’s potential in cultivation.

Even so, Jian Nantian still managed to acquire such an incredible power within a short time. Obviously, he owed his impressive growth speed to his powerful Sword Spirit and his impressive capability.

“Gu King, is there any way to regain his lost potential?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“No.” Gu King shook his head. “His foundation has been damaged. You know how important the foundation is. Your flawless foundation contributes to your unlimited potential for cultivation. But your father… The potential for cultivating cannot be rehabilitated. Even if his potential has been greatly weakened, he with the constitution of Sword Spirit is enough to impress.”

“I can tell you with certainty that your father is destined to reach the level of Samsara Temple Master and Void Temple Master. Moreover, he’d be superior to his peers of the same level. However, that’s all he could do. It’s unrealistic for him to go beyond that.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded, feeling disappointed.

Jian Nantian’s foundation had been hurt when he was in the Ancient World. There was no way of recovering it.

He was doomed not to be able to stand at the summit of the Eternal Chaotic World. However, he could easily reach the top of the Green Fire World.

Suddenly, Jin Nantian asked him, “Shuang’er, do you know why I chose to break into the Heaven-ceasing Peak in a month?”

“Why?” Jian Wushuang blurted out.

“It’ll be 2,100 years since she was taken away from us on the last day of next month. I clearly remember that!”

“I’ve never forgotten that she was captured, not even for a moment.”

His father clasped his hands, his eyes filled with fury.

Jian Wushuang was astounded.

“Those whose strength has reached my level tend to ignore the lapsing of the time. Take me for example. I don’t even remember my age.”

“Yet Father still remembers that.”
