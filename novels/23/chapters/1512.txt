Chapter 1513: The Second Level Of The Cave

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“The second level of the cave is about to open. At that time, the fight will be even more intense. Hopefully, I would be able to come across Jian Wushuang,” Xin Zhu’s eyes were filled with coldness.

A month’s time passed quickly.

The dim shadow appeared again at the highest part of the void. At the same time, some space passage appeared in each and every corner of the cave.

“The space passage to enter the second level has been opened. If you wish to get more White Blaze Fruits and opportunities, please go in,” Real God Wu Bei’s voice was evil just like before and it resounded across the whole cave.

After hearing his voice, the Universe Gods who had finished their preparations a long time ago headed into the space passages that had appeared in their vicinities without hesitation and entered the second level of Wu Bei’s cave.

In the second level of Wu Bei’s cave, there was a crimson sun high in the sky.

The whole sky and earth were crimson in color, and even the air was filled with a thin crimson mist.

“Eh?”

Jian Wushuang was standing in the void in the second level of Wu Bei’s cave. He had already spread his Soul Power across the area and discovered many figures within the range that his Soul Power had covered.

There was a total of eighteen Universe Gods.

“On the second level, the Universe Gods are spread closer to one another,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

However, he also understood that the second level was not as huge as the first level. Hence, the Universe Gods would naturally be placed closer to one another.

“For the Universe Gods to be spread so close to one another, as soon as White Blaze Fruits appear and a fight breaks out, tens or even hundreds of Universe Gods will be able to get to the battlefield in an instant. With so many Universe Gods, if they were to team up, even the experts in the top twenty and top ten of the Universe God ranking list would have to retreat.”

“Moreover, how will the White Blaze Fruits in the second level appear? Will it be the same as the first level where it is inside the bodies of Iron Wing Beasts?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

While Jian Wushuang was puzzled, Real God Wu Bei’s dim shadow appeared at the highest part of the cave and his evil voice could be heard again, “The fifty White Blaze Fruits have already been spread across the space of every area of the cave’s second level. When the time is right, they will appear by themselves. However, it will be up to your own abilities if you wish to obtain the White Blaze Fruits.”

After that, the dim shadow disappeared again.

“Appearing in succession?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes. After that, he moved his legs and started to move around the area slowly.

While moving, a number of Universe Gods discovered him.

“That’s Jian Wushuang, the super expert ranked fifth on the new Universe God ranking list!”

“It is said that Jian Wushuang obtained a total of three White Blaze Fruits in just the first level of the cave alone!”

“Three White Blaze Fruits? It’s a pity that Jian Wushuang is too strong. Hence, it is totally impossible to snatch the White Blaze Fruits from his hands!”

Under such circumstances where experts were spread so close to one another, they had better not think of getting the White Blaze Fruits quietly.

Take the fifteen White Blaze Fruits on the first level of the cave as an example. The whereabouts of every fruit were known clearly.

As for Jian Wushuang, he had obtained a total of three White Blaze Fruit on the first level and everyone had known about it for a while.

However, although the Universe Gods knew that, no one dared to lay their eyes on Jian Wushuang. Take those Universe Gods who did not have the right to get into the Universe God ranking list as an example. Unless hundreds of them teamed up, trying to snatch treasures from Jian Wushuang was as good as suicide.

In the space of the second level, the Universe Gods were searching carefully.

At that moment… At a lofty mountain at a corner of the second level’s space, boom! A strong aura burst forth.

The aura disturbed the wind and clouds. In an instant, they became many giant waves which spread across the area. With such great disturbances, even if one were to be millions of miles away, they would be able to sense the commotion clearly.

In a jiffy, hundreds of Universe Gods who were within a few million miles became alarmed. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“This disturbance… The White Blaze Fruits have appeared!”

“It’s in this vicinity. Hurry there quickly!”

“Quick, quick!”

Hundreds of Universe Gods moved their bodies at once and rushed over at their fastest speeds.

Straight away after that, an extremely fierce, miserable fight began.

What had appeared was indeed White Blaze Fruits. Moreover, it was not only one fruit; it was two fruits.

The appearance of two White Blaze Fruits quickly attracted hundreds of Universe Gods over to compete for them. After some intense and tragic killing, the fight ended.

As for the Universe Gods at the other areas of the second level, despite not being able to make it to the fight, they had managed to get the information hastily. At the same time, they also knew the results of the fight.

“Two White Blaze Fruits appeared at the same time?” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

According to the information that he had obtained, during the fight for the two White Blaze Fruits, more than two hundred Universe Gods had died, and this included an expert on the Universe God ranking list.

“More than two hundred Universe Gods died in one fight. Moreover, all of them are practically Universe Gods who stand at the top of the Third Heaven. This is really crazy,” Jian Wushuang muttered, “Actually, the White Blaze Fruits are useless to Universe Gods like us. Hence, there is no need for them to go to this extent.”

As soon as Jian Wushuang’s words left his mouth, King of Venomous Worms sneered immediately: “Jian Wushuang, that’s easy for you to say. You are a Star Palace disciple of the Lineage of Star and the Star Palace treats you like a treasure. As soon as you have completed the Ultimate Disciple Task, you will be awarded a Real God-level Chaos Unique Treasure. However, in the Eternal Chaotic World, not all the Universe Gods are treated the same way as you. For the majority of the Universe Gods, not mentioning Real God-level Chaos Unique Treasures, even getting top Universe God-level Chaos Unique Treasures is difficult for them.”

“And this time around, every big powerhouse and many Almighties have given their word that every White Blaze Fruit can be exchanged for a Real God-level Chaos Unique Treasure. Hence, how can those Universe Gods not be interested?”

“Not mentioning Universe Gods alone, if Real Gods were able to enter the cave as well, you would see what reaction the Real Gods would have. They will definitely be as crazy as the Universe Gods.”

After hearing what had been said, Jian Wushuang could not help but be silent.

Indeed, due to his identity as a Star Palace disciple, as well as his good luck, he had managed to get many opportunities. As a result of that, he had acquired and possessed many treasures. However, other Universe Gods were not as fortunate.

One White Blaze Fruit could be exchanged for a Real God-level Chaos Unique Treasure. This was enough to make countless Universe Gods, as well as a few Real Gods, go crazy.

After the first fight, White Blaze Fruits appeared again after some time. Just like before, two White Blaze Fruits appeared at the same time and an insane fight took place as well.

What followed after that was the third appearance, where three White Blaze Fruits appeared at the same time.

After three blood-soaked fights, many Universe Gods in the cave, as well as the experts in the outside world, firmly believed that there were indeed fifty White Blaze Fruits in the second level of the cave!
