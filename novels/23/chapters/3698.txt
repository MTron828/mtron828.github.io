Chapter 3699: Challenge

“I heard that not too long ago, the Star Master sent three hegemons to accomplish an extremely important task. Could it be that something unexpected happened in this matter?” The muscular man asked.

“Who cares? It has nothing to do with us,” Demon Wolf said.

“That’s true.” The muscular man laughed, then quickly left to deliver the order.

Within the depths of the towering, deep violet hall, an endless, gloomy aura filled the entire hall.

Within the black fog at the very center of the hall, a pair of cold eyes suddenly opened.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis...this is getting interesting.”

“Just you wait. It won’t be long before I personally come looking for you. Haha...”

A maniacal laughter rang out. This laughter lingered in the hall for a long time.

…

In the Divine Beginning Realm, the old nest of the Three Great Saint Realms was now in ruins.

However, these ruins could be rebuilt.

Now, the experts of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect were starting to rebuild.

As for the many sects and forces that had participated in this battle, they left one by one after they divided the spoils of war among themselves.

The army of experts under the command of the four divine races had also returned to the Demon Realm, but Xiao’er, who was now publicly recognized as the Ruler of the four divine races, remained temporarily.

The original reason was, of course, because of Di Shisan.

On the calm lake, a wooden boat was drifting with the wind. On the wooden boat, a man and a woman were leaning against each other, whispering to each other. From time to time, faint laughter could be heard.

When Jian Wushuang came to the surrounding void and saw the scene below, his expression became strange.

The two people on the wooden boat below were, of course, Di Shisan and Xiao’er.

The two of them had always been in love with each other. In that battle, Xiao’er had even turned against the Nine-tailed Clan for Di Shisan. In the end, because of the destruction of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect, the entire Seven Star Divine Realm was sealed, Di Shisan had remained in the sealed time, while Xiao’er had started the nine reincarnations to cultivate the nine-life succubus skill.

Now, after countless years, the two of them finally met again.

Although so many years had passed, the feelings between them had not changed at all.

What surprised Jian Wushuang was Di Shisan’s current appearance.

In his impression, Di Shisan was an extremely cold and arrogant person.

He had started to interact with Di Shisan in his previous life. Speaking of which, they had been friends for many years. The Di Shisan he met had always had a cold face. No matter who he was facing, whether it was his own people or his enemies…his expression had never changed.

But now, when Di Shisan and Xiao’er were together, there was no trace of coldness. The smile on his face was so natural.

“I didn’t expect Di Shisan to have such a side.”

Jian Wushuang smiled, then he rushed down and soon appeared in front of Di Shisan and Xiao’er.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re here.”

Seeing Jian Wushuang coming, the smile on Di Shisan’s face disappeared and turned into an ice mountain again.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis.” Xiao’er bowed respectfully.

Although Jian Wushuang was once her ally, and his strength was not as good as hers for a long time, and even a long time ago, Jian Wushuang was just a little guy in front of her, but now...Jian Wushuang was already recognized as the number one expert in the Divine Beginning Realm. He could easily kill a Ruler and a master of the Saint Realm.

Xiao’er could not help but feel a trace of respect for such a super expert.

“Di Shisan, did I disturb you?” Jian Wushuang asked playfully.

“No.” Di Shisan shook his head. “Palace Master Xuan Yan and the others are already handling the matters in the Seven Star Mysterious Sect. I don’t think they need my help. Are you here for that matter?”

Di Shisan had already guessed Jian Wushuang’s intention.

Jian Wushuang smiled, he said, “As you know, in the Divine Beginning Realm and even in the surrounding star field, you’re probably the only one who can match me in sword principle comprehension. Your sword principle once made me look up to you. Now that I’ve finally caught up with you, I naturally want to have a face-to-face fight with you.

“Previously, in the Eternal Chaotic World, we were unable to fully display our sword principle strength. But now, in the Divine Beginning Realm, we don’t have any scruples.

“Di Shisan, how long will it take for your strength to recover to its peak?” Jian Wushuang asked him.

He wanted to fight with Di Shisan.

Of course, Jian Wushuang only wanted to compete with him in teaching. As for his strength, he was much stronger than Di Shisan. If it was a battle between two people, it would be unfair to Di Shisan.

However, he also knew that Di Shisan had been in the Eternal Chaotic World for a long time. He had been sleeping for a long time and was completely in the weakest state. Although he had returned to the Divine Beginning Realm now…it would definitely take time for him to recover to his peak.

“About 30 years,” Di Shisan said.

“30 years?” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. “In that case, I’ll come back to you in 30 years.”

“I’ll wait.” Di Shisan nodded.

“Goodbye.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and left.

After Jian Wushuang left…

“Shisan, are you really going to fight with Heavenly Sword Marquis?” Xiao’er immediately looked at him.

“Of course. We had an agreement when we were in the Eternal Chaotic World, and we can’t avoid it,” Di Shisan said.

“But in terms of strength, this Heavenly Sword Marquis can easily kill even Saint Realm Masters and Rulers?” Xiao’er frowned.

“In terms of strength, I am definitely far inferior to him. However, I am only competing with him in sword dao and swordsmanship. In this aspect, I am confident that I will not lose to him,” Di Shisan said with a smile.

“In other words, you are confident in defeating him in that battle?” Xiao’er was surprised.

“Not really. When he fought against those three hegemons, I could tell that his understanding of the Dao of the sword wasn’t much lower than mine. In addition, he created a high-grade tier 7 absolute art. Although it was only one type, that sword attack of his was extremely formidable.”

“It can be said that there isn’t much of a gap between him and me in terms of understanding of the Dao of the sword and in terms of sword-arts. However, there is one point. The sword-arts he created aren’t as comprehensive as mine. Therefore, when the time comes for a real battle, my chances of winning should be 70%, while his chances are 30%,” Di Shisan said calmly.

His words seemed a little arrogant.

But in fact, those who were familiar with Di Shisan knew that he was an extremely arrogant person, and he never exaggerated.

Since he said that he had a 70% chance of winning, those who were familiar with him knew that his chance of winning was more than 70%, or even 80%, or even 90%.

Although Di Shisan had existed many years ago and had not made any progress in sword principle because he had been sleeping, his understanding of sword principle had always been unparalleled. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Now, although Jian Wushuang was qualified to compete with him in sword principle, it was still unknown whether he could really surpass him.
