Chapter 2197 Old Monsters in Deep Slumber

“Thirty thousand years later, Heaven’s Horizon… That is their only chance!”Once the blurry figure said these words, the figure disappeared from the altar.

Leng Ruxue stood there, excited. After hearing what the blurry figure said, she thought to herself, “Thirty thousand years… Is the time finally coming?”

“Haha, these old monsters have waited for this for all eternity.”

She smiled creepily before she left.

…

Within the Eternal Chaotic World, there were many dangerous places.

The most dangerous was undoubtedly the Eight Lairs.

Even though the Eight Lairs were extremely dangerous, there were many opportunities within. The Eight Lairs was one of the best places for experts to venture into.

After the battlefield from the Ancient Past was revealed, many of the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World went to venture into the Ancient Mystery Land or the battlefield around Green Fire World. The Eight Lairs were neglected.

Only some of the real gods who could not venture into the ancient battlefield would choose to venture into the Eight Lairs.

Within the Eight Lairs, the Sixth Lair.

The Sixth Lair was one of the most infamous places. Many of the experts higher than the realm of Sir God dared not venture in.

The Buddhist Demon Sea was one of the most notorious places.

Back when Jian Wushuang had been set up by the Acheron Palace, he had entered Buddhist Demon Sea in order to save Lei Chao.

He was lucky as he had received help from experts and managed to survive.

After what happened, Jian Wushuang knew that there were two experts from the ancient past residing there in slumber.

One of the two experts was One-Star Man.

The other man had an ancient flood dragon and had tried to kill Jian Wushuang.

These two experts resided in the Buddhist Demon Sea.

On this day, a beautiful figure stepped foot into the Buddhist Demon Sea.

This beautiful figure was Leng Ruxue.

“Buddhist Demon Sea. Is that man still in slumber here?” Leng Ruxue looked at the endless sea and thought to herself.

Those experts who had survived from the ancient battlefield usually slumbered in the ancient battlefields.

For example, the Ancient Mystery Land. Many experts from the ancient past chose those places for their slumbers.

There were exceptions, of course. The battle back then had been so fierce that the entire Ancient Battlefield had been spread throughout this world.

The Buddhist Demon Sea was one of them.

Leng Ruxue did not hesitate and continued to head deep into the Buddhist Demon Sea.

The Buddhist Demon Sea was very dangerous. However, Leng Ruxue was a stage three great emperor. Soon, she reached the depth of the sea.

Here, it was covered in black mist.

The black mist contained inimaginable corrosive power. At the deepest part of the Buddhist Demon Sea, even a great emperor would find it difficult to stop the corrosive power.

Leng Ruxue floated there, motionless.

Right then, in the sea below, a large wave erupted as a black figure rose and appeared behind Leng Ruxue.

This black figure was an ancient flood dragon. His whole body was covered in black scales which radiated death. Its mouth opened as it bit Leng Ruxue with its two sharp teeth.

Leng Ruxue stood there. She noticed that the ancient flood dragon was attacking her, but she did not bother dodging or defending herself from the attack.

Right when Leng Ruxue was about to be bitten by the ancient flood dragon, she yelled.

“Old Monster Dragon, do you wish to be trapped here in the Buddhist Demon Sea forever?”

Her voice filled the entire Buddhist Demon Sea.

The ancient flood dragon stopped in its tracks.

The teeth of the dragon were about to touch Leng Ruxue. However, it stopped and dared not move another inch forward. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Leng Ruxue turned around slowly as she looked at the ancient flood dragon coldly. There was no fear in her eyes.

The ancient flood dragon was very fierce and savage. However, under the stare of Leng Ruxue, it backed off and closed its mouth.

On the back of the ancient flood dragon, a blurry figure formed.

He had black armour and an extremely violent aura. His eyes were like those of a venomous snake as he looked at Leng Ruxue.

“Little brat, who are you?” The blurry figure, who was Old Monster Dragon, said with a deep voice.

Leng Ruxue did not reply. Her hair turned white and her irises turned grey instantly. A terrifying aura of destruction swept out in all directions.

“White haired and grey irises. You are that person’s…” Old Monster Dragon was shocked. His attitude instantly turned for the battle.

“I am sorry that I scared you, little girl,” he said as he stomped on the ancient flood dragon, as though he was punishing it.

Leng Ruxue stood there coldly, not saying a thing.

“Little girl, you came today under that person’s orders?” Old Monster Dragon asked nervously.

“Humph. My master wants me to tell you this: thirty thousand years later, Heaven’s Horizon. That is one and only chance. If you miss it…” Leng Ruxue grunted. She turned around and left, completely ignoring Old Monster Dragon.

On the vast ocean, the ancient flood dragons float there. Old Monster Dragon stood on his dragon, stunned.

He was completely stunned.

Soon, he regained his composure.

“Hahaha~~~”

“Finally! Finally!”

“How long has it been? I can finally leave this terrible place!”

“Thirty thousand years, the last thirty thousand years.”

His crazy laughter was like letting go of his helplessness over these years. It contained some sadness as his laughter reverberated throughout the vast ocean.

However, in the Buddhist Demon Sea, there was more than one person who was in a slumber.

One-Star Man was there too.

When Leng Ruxue appeared there, One-Star Man realised her presence. When Old Monster Dragon laughed, One-Star Man had a complicated look.

“Thirty thousand years?”

“Those old men in a slumber must be excited. Looks like it is time for me to get out of this place and see some sunlight.”
