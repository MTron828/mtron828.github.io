Chapter 2513: The Demonic Moon Prefecture

Previously, there were no changes in Jian Wushuang’s expressions at all even when the Celestial Beast Alliance attacked in close proximity.

However, just the mention of that treasure by those two experts of the Xueya Escort Team had shaken Jian Wushuang.

“The Stately Painting!” Jian Wushuang mumbled in the corner of his mouth.

In his past life, Jian Wushuang possessed two extremely valuable treasures in the Eternal Chaotic Realm.

Both treasures were given by his master, Xuan Yi. One of them was Blood Mountain Sword, his default weapon which was upgraded alongside his own abilities.

The second treasure was the Stately Painting!

It was his secret weapon, his trump card, and also one of the Seven Star Black Sect’s most precious articles!

After Xuan Yi sent his soul into the Reincarnation Passage, he also sent the Blood Mountain Sword and The Stately Painting as well.

The Blood Mountain Sword fell from the sky during his birth and was still in his possessions.

However, The Stately Painting was lost.

Jian Wushuang guessed The Stately Painting had probably fallen into the Ancient God Realm as well on the same day he was born, but its exact location was unknown.

However, Jian Wushuang heard the name of the treasure mentioned once more in the Dark Thunder Territory through Xueya Escort Team members’ conversation.

According to their conversation, The Stately Painting was only recently discovered by the Xiao clan which only led to their clan’s destruction by the Territorial Lord’s personal actions. Obviously, The Stately Painting is so extraordinary it stirred such madness in the Territorial Lord to annihilate an entire clan, but that doesn’t mean this Stately Painting is the treasure which I’ve lost.’

Although Jian Wushuang was incredibly excited, he did not lose his rationality.

There were many people in the world who shared similar names, so it would not be surprising if there were treasures that shared the same name as well.

For example, it was entirely possible another painting scroll which was also a special treasure bearing the name ‘The Stately Painting’.

Regardless, it did not matter as Jian Wushuang would not ignore it the moment he heard the name ‘Stately Painting’.

‘The Xiao clan may be annihilated by the Territorial Lord because of the Stately Painting, but I wonder if the painting is currently in his hands.’

Jian Wushuang squinted before moving his eyesight toward the purple-armored woman who was sitting cross-legged on the ground. “This woman... The Xiao clan’s eldest daughter must know everything about how her clan obtained The Stately Painting!”

Nothing else happened for the rest of the night.

On the next day, everyone in Xueya Escort Team had freshened up and resumed their journey.

They soon stood before a huge mountain.

The group stopped there for a short while.

“Captain, what we see ahead of us is the Demonic Moon Mountains according to our map. One of the Dark Thunder Territory’s Eighteen Prefectures has nested inside the mountains. However, the Eighteen Prefectures are infamous in the Dark Thunder Territory. If there isn’t something valuable enough, they wouldn’t easily take action.” One of Xueya Escort Team’s deputy captains Ultimate Gods reported.

Although the Eighteen Prefectures were also thieves, they had risen to the level of political powers.

They had taken over the Dark Thunder Territory and regarded themselves as kings and overlords of the area. They still did indeed rob passersby, escort teams, caravans, and experts. However, they would usually run a thorough background check on the other party to understand their abilities and potential gains before making a move.

The Eighteen Prefectures would not take action altogether if there were not much to obtain.

The Xueya Escort Team was merely a regular crimson-class escort team while the 50 cultivators they were escorting had only very normal backgrounds. The only person slightly more unique was Jian Wushuang who was riding on a double-horned Thunderous Star Beast, but that was really a tiny benefit. Perhaps the Demonic Moon Prefecture did not think too much of it.

“Even so, we still need to be careful. We should avoid troubles even if it’s just some regular thieves. This is the base of the Demonic Moon Prefecture after all with a lot of thieves around. We’re only passersby, hence let’s not get into any more trouble and finish crossing through this place within two days,” said Xiao Tiexin.

“Aye. The rest would be smooth sailing once we pass through Dark Thunder Territory’s central region—the Demonic Moon Prefecture.” The deputy captain agreed.

“Let’s go then.”

Everyone entered the Demonic Moon Mountains very soon following an order from Xiao Tiexin.

They moved at a moderate pace.

After an hour...

Jian Wushuang—who had been riding cross-legged on the double-horn Thunderous Star Beast—suddenly opened his eyes.

He scanned the surrounding voids once and shook his head. “Looks like crossing the Demonic Moon Mountains wouldn’t be an easy job.”

He muttered to himself before closing his eyes.

All was calm and uneventful within the first six hours after entering the Demonic Moon Mountains.

However, Xiao Tiexin—who was walking in front of the group—suddenly paused.

“What’s the matter, captain?” The two deputy captains immediately looked at her.

Xiao Tiexin looked serious. “Something isn’t right. Our journey is too calm and smooth. The Demonic Moon Mountains is the Demonic Moon Prefecture’s base. There are usually innumerable criminal activities going on here. However, we have been here for six hours now and still didn’t see even a single thief. Not only did we not run into any, but there hasn’t even been a single person spying on us from our surroundings. I didn’t even sense a single beam of soul power. That’s absolutely impossible!”

Although Xiao Tiexin was quite young, her years of adventures had trained her to be mature and methodical.

She would definitely not be that naive to assume the situation was a coincidence.

“Captain, are you saying the Demonic Moon Prefecture has noticed us?” One of the deputy captains could not help but ask.

“That’s very possible.” Xiao Tiexin nodded solemnly.

“Then what do we do?” the deputy captain continued his inquiry.

“Don’t panic, stay calm. We’ll turn around and go back the same way. We’ll think of another way to cross Dark Thunder Territory’s central region once we are out of the mountains,” said Xiao Tiexin.

“Aye.” The two deputy captains solemnly nodded and immediately began sending messages to the remaining escort team members.

However, something suddenly happened before they could turn around!

A few waves of powerful aura suddenly swept across the void in various directions as a huge curtain of light-grey-colored energy began spreading in an instant after that.

The Xueya Escort Team and their current void location were soon completely shrouded by it. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Is this... Restrictive Shield?”

“Besiegement Restrictive Shield!”

Xiao Tiexin began to worry.

The Peak Divine Demons in Xueya Escort Team and those 50 cultivators being escorted were also visibly shocked!
