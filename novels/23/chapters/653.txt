Chapter 654: A Man Can’t Be Offended!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Silence!

The huge Drill Ground was in silence.

It was so quiet, you could hear a pin drop.

Many geniuses on the Drill Ground and experts in the Skyward Pavilion gazed upon this scene in awe.

“Did he die?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were fixed in a blank stare.

As an Elder of the Cloud Sea Asgard, Shi Qianhan was an Eternal Realm expert. Experts like him were masters in the Firmament Territory. However, Xuan Yi cut him in half with one strike of his sword.

“That strike.”

It haunted in Jian Wushuang’s memory.

A swift and frightening strike!

It had been too fast and too terrifying!

Among all the geniuses present, Jian Wushuang’s cultivated the principle of the sword more than the others. But even he couldn’t comprehend the blow from that sword. He just felt it was too powerful!

Right then...

“Xuan Yi!” An angry voice called out, it was Shi Qianhan.

“What?”

Many of the geniuses on the Drill Ground had become frantic. Their hair stood on end seeing Shi Qianhan’s body cut in half.

His upper half rose into the air, his face flamed with angry and his eyes fixed on Xuan Yi.

“How, how could it be possible?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

How could he survive being cut in half?

“I heard that the Eternal Realm expert would continue to live as long as his Life Core was unbroken. It seems it’s true.” The geniuses of the Eternal World recalled.

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang felt overwhelmed.

Life Core?

As long as the Life Core remained intact, he would live.

Jian Wushuang looked around, seeing that the experts who were walking out of the Skyward Pavilion didn’t seem surprised, apparently they knew Shi Qianhan was not dead.

But they were still shocked.

Few of them had seen Xuan Yi fight before. They were shocked by his strength.

“Xuan Yi, how dare you?” Shi Qianhan’s face twisted and he stared at Xuan Yi with hatred in his eyes. Suddenly... Whoosh!

A ghostlike figure appeared in front of him no less than a meter away.

It was Xuan Yi, his face had changed from a soft gaze to an ice cold stare.

Anyone who met his stare would start to shiver uncontrollably.

“Shi Qianhan.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xuan Yi called him, his voice heavy with the intent of killing Shi Qianhan. Shi Qianhan’s eyes were wide open and filled with fear.

Terrified!

The terror flooded Shi Qianhan’s mind. He felt Xuan Yi held his life in his hands.

“I agree with you. The Eternal World is dangerous.” Xuan Yi said calmly.

“Huh?” Shi Qianhan looked in horror at Xuan Yi, he couldn’t understand why he said that.

“In the dangerous world, it is not only Jian Wushuang, but you also need to be careful. In the Eternal World, even in the Firmament Territory, there are many people that could kill you.” Xuan Yi said in a cold voice.

“How dare you?” Shi Qianhan gazed at Xuan Yi, his eyes conveying both fear and anger.

Xuan Yi grinned a gruesome smile like a sharp knife. Then he moved forward, whispered in Shi Qianhan’s ear, “Shi Qianhan, ask your Palace Master whether or not I dare to kill you, what he does if I do kill you?”

“Make sure he understands!”

“Tell him, I will kill any of the Cloud Sea Asgard that threatens a disciple of the Ancient Sect!”

“Tell him everything.”

Shi Qianhan gulped, his fear had intensified and a cold sweat had broken out on his forehead.

The elder of the Immortal Dynasty and the evil lady of the Boundless Demon Sect looked pitifully at Shi Qianhan as if he was a fool.

“Foolish. How dare he threaten Jian Wushuang in front of Xuan Yi? Does he really think Xuan Yi is a push-over?” The elder of the Immortal Dynasty sneered.

“He really thought the Cloud Sea Asgard was the most powerful sect in the Firmament Territory. How reckless he is to offend Xuan Yi in public. Usually, Xuan Yi is nice and easy-going. Usually!”

“But if he got angry, he would definitely launch a massacre. I have not seen it with my own eyes, though I have heard tales of it. When Xuan Yi made waves in the Firmament Territory, the Palace Master of the Cloud Sea Asgard had not yet been born!” The evil lady of the Boundless Demon Sect also sneered.

They were smarter than Shi Qianhan.

They knew that the person in the Firmament Territory couldn’t be offended.

Long ago, their Sect Masters had warned them that two people in the Ancient Sect couldn’t be offended.

One was the Ancient Sect’s Master.

The other one was Xuan Yi.

They were told that the Ancient Sect was a special Sect inside the Firmament Territory and Xuan Yi was the special one in the Ancient Sect!

Therefore, they dared not offend Xuan Yi. However in his stupidity Shi Qianhan had done so today.

The Drill Ground was silent.

Everybody on the ground looked on in shock.

Shi Qianhan did not dare say another word, fearing that Xuan Yi would kill him.

Because Xuan Yi could easily do so.

“Jian Wushuang.” Xuan Yi softened his demeanor and looked at Jian Wushuang, he said softly, “Don’t worry. As you’re a disciple of the Ancient Sect, they will protect you. No one will hurt you unless the Ancient Sect gets destroyed.”
