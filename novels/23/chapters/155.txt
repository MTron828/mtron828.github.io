Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The surrounding warriors were currently in discussion.

Jian Wushuang, in a black robe, with the Triple-kill Sword in hand. Suddenly a sword essence was released through the air!

The sword essence with a billowing battle intent radiated from Jian Wushuang!

The billowing battle intent caused the whole area calm down.

Everyone was looking forward to what might happen next.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Two figures appeared next to Jian Wushuang. They were Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou. Their faces were cold, and both were staring at the demonic youth, Xue Yun, who was not far away from them.

“He-he, I just wanted to say hello, no need to take it so seriously!” Xue Yun smiled with an evil look.

“Say hello? The way you guys from Blood Feather Tower saying hello is really special,” Jian Wushuang sneered.

Xue Yun raised his eyebrows and said, “Jian Wushuang, I had never even heard of you one month ago. But now, you are quite well-known in Blood Feather Tower.”

“More than one month ago, you raided the Clearwater Stronghold in Qingshui on your own, killing more than one hundred assassins there. Even two purple-masked assassins were defeated, with one dying and the other one escaping. Aren’t you quite efficient?”

Xue Yun spoke casually. While listening to what he said, many warriors in the area were shocked.

” He attacked the Clearwater Stronghold alone?”

“He eliminated more than one hundred assassins, and even the purple-masked assassins were defeated, with one dying?and the other one escaping?”

“Purple-masked assassins? Aren’t they the supreme experts in the Yin-Yang Void Realm?”

“Jian Wushuang has such frightening battle results? Unexpected!”

...

“Compared to your Blood Feather Tower, what I did is nothing,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

Xue Yun sneered noncommittally.

“You two,” a low voice sounded. The sound was from one of the Royal Guards who seemed to be the leader.

“Any hatred between you can be resolved during the coming selection battle. For now, I hope you will temporarily stop. Even if you are powerful, the Royal Guard will definitely suppress you.”

The sergeants of the Royal Guard in the area all looked serious.

Having glanced at the Royal Guards who were gathering around them, Jian Wushuang lifted his head, looked toward Xue Yung, and said, “I will be coming for you in the selection battle!”

“I will be waiting for you,” Xue Yun spoke proudly, with a slight smile. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Their words immediately created a disturbance around the platform.

Everybody became excited.

Everybody knew that there would be an exciting and matchless battle in the selection battle.

The fierce confrontation between Jian and Xue just now was only a warm-up.

Several figures were gathered in the air, not far away from the platform. Some were floating, and some were riding on flying beasts. At first glance, there were at least ten people. These people were all peak experts of the Yin-Yang Void Realm.

They were the top experts from the Sects.

Which included Palace Masters Black White from Dragon Palace, Grayrobe from Blood Feather Tower, and one of the Hall Masters from the Gladiator Arena.

Those experts saw what just happened on the platform, and a few of them were in discussion.

“Ha-ha, those little fellows have bad tempers.”

“One is Xue Yun from Blood Feather Tower, and the other is Jian Wushuang from Dragon Palace. So it’s not surprising that they want to fight. After all, the hatred between Jian Wushuang and Blood Feather Tower is well-known.”

“Exactly. Their fight will be a competition of diamond cutting diamond. I am looking forward to it.”

“Palace Masters, and Mr. Grayrobe, don’t you have anything to say? Both of them are disciples under your commands.”

These Yin-Yang Void Realm experts were talking and laughing.

“There is nothing to say. Jian Wushuang is the target of the Scarlet Kill Command from our Blood Feather Tower. He needs to die no matter what,” Grayrobe said coldly.

“Hum, you like to exaggerate. Be careful that you don’t bite your tongue. Seems like the lesson you received two years was not enough,” Palace Master White glanced at Grayrobe, and spoke coldly.

“Two years ago?” with his mouth spasming, Grayrobe continued, “If it wasn’t for the other two forces secretly helping you two years ago, your Dragon Palace would not have put our Blood Feather Tower in such a situation! How ridiculous.”

“Oh, you are just quarrelsome,” said the Palace Master White sneeringly.

“You are the one who is quarrelsome. Just wait, that exceptional genius will die in this selection battle,” Grayrobe said.

Hearing this, Palace Master White’s face darkened. She was a little bit worried about Jian Wushuang.

“That boy should just participate in the selection battle like normal. Why does he need to engaged himself in a fight with Xue Yun like a fool?”

Xue Yun is the recognized 1st place on the Earthly Dragon List. His strength was already frightening three years ago. In addition, during the past three years, his strength had improvements in cultivation and other aspects.

All the people in the Tianzong Dynasty knew that now Xue Yun was a hardcore monster, so nobody dared to challenge him.

However, Jian Wushuang was determined to fight with this monster.

“If he avoided Xue Yun in the selection battle, he could definitely get a place with his strength. But once he faces Xue Yun, it will be difficult for him to survive, not to mention claiming a spot.”

Having glanced at each other, Palace Masters White and Black were both worried.

But right at that moment…

“Ha-ha, it’s quite lively here.”

A gentle and amiable voice suddenly rang out, as a golden chair appeared in the very center of the crowd of experts. On the chair sat a handsome man in a golden imperial robe.

Seeing the imperial-robed man who suddenly appeared, the Yin-Yang Void Realm experts all became courteous.

“Greetings, Your Majesty!”

“Greetings, Your Majesty!”

Many experts bowed to the imperial-robed man, included Palace Master White, Palace Master Black, and Grayrobe. They stood up from their seats, and gave him a courteous bow.

In the entire Tianzong Dynasty, only one person was qualified to be called Your Majesty.

He was Di Xi, the Monarch of Tianzong Dynasty.

Di Xi was not only the present Monarch of Tianzong Dynasty, but also a peak expert ranked 1st on the Heavenly Dragon List. He was recognized as the strongest in the Yin-Yang Void Realm in Tianzong Dynasty!

Regarding Crazy Knife, who shocked the entire Tianzong Dynasty a hundred years ago and had been ranked 1st on the Heavenly Dragon List for several decades, he had been removed from the Heavenly Dragon List because of his long absence.

“No need to be so formal, please sit as you were,” as soon as Di Xi waved his hand lightly, the people present all sat back down.

“I saw the fight between those two young men. They are both very excellent, especially Xue Yun. His strength is very distinctive. He did not display his full strength,” Di Xi said casually.

“The young man called Jian Wushuang is incredible as well. After all, he is only in the Profound Gold Core Realm right now. Once he achieves the Exceptional Gold Core Realm in several years, he will definitely be Xue Yun’s match.”

“It’s a pity that these two outstanding young men enemies, engaged in a life-and-death struggle.”
