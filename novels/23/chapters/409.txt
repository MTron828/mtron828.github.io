“Ah!”

“How is this possible!”

The Marquis Cangyue experts were hysterical. They looked at Jian Wushuang in fury.

They were well aware that the strike had been powerful.

“This stroke!” The elder widened his eyes and murmured. He spat out a mouthful of blood.

With the exception of the fat middle-aged man, all his people were terrified.

Some had their bodies cleaved into halves; others had their magic weapons smashed; still others had been decapitated or had their organs pulverized.

Eight of his people collapsed while he and the fat middle-aged man were seriously injured.

It had only been one strike!

“He is in Stage Three!”?The elder with sword-shaped eyebrows thought in a daze. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Jian Wushuang’s attack was more powerful than that of an ordinary Stage Three expert.

Jian Wushuang’s Realm had suppressed the strength of the elder and his comrades. This had resulted in eight of them perishing.

“Stage Three experts are rare in the vast Outer Area. How did I run into one?” The elder was petrified.

Using their special tactics, he and his squad had been relatively successful in hunting the squads of Marquis Piaoxue.

Nonetheless, setting a trap was not foolproof. Now, he was encountering a powerful opponent.

A Stage Three expert was much stronger than a Stage Two expert. He would be able to take on an entire squad on his own. A stronger Stage Three expert would even be able to slaughter all its members. With Double First-grade Sword Soul and Realm Technique, Jian Wushuang’s battle strength could be compared to a more powerful Stage Three expert, so he was able to kill eight opponents with ease.

Whoosh!

A lightning bolt flashed across the Blood River and appeared in front of the elder and the fat middle-aged man.

Two streaks of sword light slashed out. Aided by the Sword Souls’ power, the sword light pierced?the air and headed towards the two opponents, who tried to parry the attack.

However, they were much weaker than Jian Wushuang.

Chi! Chi!

The two streaks of sword light easily penetrated their bodies.

Jian Wushuang had just killed all 10 opponents.

The barbarian witnessed Jian Wushuang’s massacre of the other squad and immediately beat a hasty retreat with his people.

Having dispatched the elder and the fat middle-aged man, Jian Wushuang realized he could not hunt the other squad down as they had disappeared.

Calm was restored in the area.

Jian Wushuang’s comrades had witnessed the events and were in shock.

Jian Wushuang withdrew his aura. The two Sword Soul Phantoms and the Blood River gradually dissipated.

Jian Wushuang walked over to them.

“Swordsman, you...” Sir Axe stared speechlessly at Jian Wushuang.

“This was an intense battle, and must have aroused the attention of many people. Let’s leave now and talk later,” Jian Wushuang suggested.

“Okay.” Sir Axe nodded. The squad departed.

Half a day later, they stopped at a mountain.

“Haha, Swordsman, you’re amazing!”

Lei Dao, who was on good terms with Jian Wushuang, gave him a big hug.

“Swordsman!”

“Swordsman!”

Sir Axe, Shi Ling, and the other comrades looked at Jian Wushuang in admiration and gratitude.

They had been prepared to fight to the death.

Unexpectedly, Jian Wushuang had killed all members of the elder’s squad.

“I should have thought of it. How could an expert who owns Realm Technique be only at Stage Two?” Sir Axe exclaimed, “Sword Soul Phantom has always been something we aspired to.”

On the topic of Sword Soul Phantom, the other experts could not hold back their acclaim.

The Soul strength was powerful but strange.

There was a level higher than the Three Ultimate Stages of the Saint Realm—the Nature-defying Level.

An expert at Nature-defying Level was not much weaker than a lord, a Cloud Realm expert.

This was because he held the power from the awakening Soul.

Jian Wushuang had awakened Double First-grade Sword Souls and would be the subject of much envy.

“You have great battle strength although you have not condensed any Origin Marks. When you do so, your strength will increase exponentially. Then, you may become as strong as experts at Nature-defying Level. If you condense more Origin Marks, you will catch up with lords,” Sir Axe said enviously.

“Swordsman, you hid your strengths well.”

“Too powerful!”

The others sighed with emotion.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly but his expression soon turned grave. “Sir Axe, gentlemen, I have to tell you something.”

Lei Dao, and the others looked at Jian Wushuang.

“I want to go to Inner Area alone,” Jian Wushuang said.

His comrades exchanged looks and laughed.

“We’ve all guessed what you want,” Sir Axe said with a smile, “All experts who possess the battle strength of Stage Three travel alone in Flaming Battlefield, and most of them will stay in Inner Area. Only we, experts at Stage Two, team up and stay in Outer Area.

“Based on your battle strength, you’re even stronger than an expert at Stage Three. Inner Area is the right place for you.”

Sir Axe and others were not surprised by Jian Wushuang’s decision.

His Realm Technique was useful and they were reluctant to let him go.

But they knew that someone with his abilities should go to Inner Area.

Outer Area was a place for experts at Stage Two; it would not challenge Jian Wushuang.

Inner Area, which was full of the experts at Stage Three, was more suitable for Jian Wushuang.
