4160 Spatial Rift

Boom! Boom! Boom!

A clap of thunder resounded between heaven and earth!

The 300,000 rays of sword Qi slashed toward Qing Xuzi like a dragon that could destroy the world and a snake that could swallow the sun!

Jian Wushuang! Qing Xuzi’s expression changed drastically for the first time, and he roared!

!!

Bang!

The next moment, the 300000 rays of sword Qi crashed into Qing Xuzi’s body.

Clang, clang, clang, clang.

Qing Xuzi raised his sword to block the attack. The sharp sword Qi collided with the body of his startling cicada divine sword, making a clanging sound of metal and sparks.

However, Qing Xuzi only managed to block less than 100000 sword Qi before the shocking cicada divine sword was knocked out of his hand.

Then, the 200,000 sword Qi crashed into his body without any resistance.

Qing Xuzi’s divine body trembled like a sieve as if thousands of swords were piercing through his heart, making dense muffled sounds.

After three breaths of time, the 300000 rays of sword Qi finally disappeared.

Jian Wushuang stared at the scene until Qing Xuzi’s body fell to the ground like a broken bag. He finally heaved a sigh of relief.

He believed that even Qing Xuzi, who was considered invincible among the Ultimate Rulers, would not be any better off when faced with the 300000 flashes of sword Qi that he had put in so much effort and carefully planned, which was unleashed with 13000 times divine power and the burning divine power of the dragon-destroying secret skill.

Time passed, breath by breath.

The place where Qing Xuzi had landed raised a huge cloud of dust. Jian Wushuang did not dare to let his guard down. After all, Qing Xuzi was not only an invincible Ultimate Ruler, but also the deity of the Great Void Divine Hall, a top power in the universe.

No one knew what kind of trump card the Great Void Divine Hall had prepared for him when they sent him to the Tarot Ruins.

Cough, cough, cough.

Suddenly, the sound of blood being coughed up could be heard from the smoke.

Jian Wushuang’s heart sank. As expected, the 300000 rays of sword Qi were not enough to kill Qing Xuzi.

The smoke and dust gradually dispersed.

The place where Qing Xuzi had fallen formed a huge pit that was hundreds of meters wide.

Qing Xuzi staggered up from the pit, looking extremely miserable.

The white robe embroidered with the words ‘great void’ on his body was completely torn and hung on his body like a piece of rag. His hair was all disheveled, and his handsome face was full of blood. He no longer looked like the indifferent and noble son of God. He was in an extremely sorry state.

“Sword! Wu! Double!”

Qing Xuzi panted heavily and stared at Jian Wushuang. He squeezed the words ‘Jian Wushuang’ out of his teeth.

Clang!

He bent his waist and slowly moved forward. Then, he grabbed the divine sword Jingchan that was stuck in front of him. Like a demon that had crawled out of hell, a monstrous hatred exploded from his body.

“His aura didn’t weaken much?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang looked at the scene expressionlessly, but he sighed in his heart.

He had thought that even if he could not kill Qing Xuzi, he could at least severely injure him with the killing move that he had prepared with so much effort and divine power. However, although Qing Xuzi looked extremely embarrassed, his aura was not weakened much at all.

In the end, it was still because his realm was too low.

If he had not been a stage four great Ruler but a stage five great Ruler, he believed that that move would have been enough to kill Qing Xuzi.

“Almost…just a little bit more…I really did suffer a setback at the hands of a fourth-stage chief Ruler!” Qing Xuzi’s eyes were fixed on Jian Wushuang. While he was shocked and angry, he also felt lucky.

If not for the fact that the great void God temple had given him a life-saving jade pendant that could resist the power of a Ruler, he might have really failed miserably.

The killing move just now had a total of 300000 rays of terrifying sword Qi attacking him. If he relied on his own strength, he would definitely be seriously injured even though he could survive.

Once he was seriously injured, it would be difficult for him to recover in a short time, so he could only leave the Tarot Ruins for the time being.

Right now, even though he had protected himself from being severely injured by that killing move, he had used the life-saving jade pendant that the great void godly temple had prepared for him to use in the Tarot Ruins.

Qing Xuzi lowered his head and looked at the diamond-shaped jade pendant that had been broken into eight pieces in his hand. He could no longer suppress the killing intent he had never felt before.

“Jian Wushuang, I’m going to break all the bones in your body inch by inch and extract your soul from your divine body. You’ll have to suffer the pain of being burned by the sword every day!” Qing Xuzi said resentfully.

Jian Wushuang’s face was cold. He did not even look at Qing Xuzi. Instead, he looked at the void around him.

Perhaps it was because of the simultaneous explosion of the 300000 rays of sword Qi, the void had been distorted by the impact.

Gradually, an obscure space crack appeared.

“Spatial Rift?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed.

In the Tarot Ruins, under the impact of the sword Qi, a space crack suddenly appeared?

Where did the Spatial Rift lead to?

“Jian Wushuang, in fifty chaos cycles, you are the first person to force me into such a situation. Good, very good!” Qing Xuzi’s eyes were as cold as a poisonous snake’s. He took a deep breath and seemed to have made a decision. His brows gradually furrowed and he said, “Void forbidden technique, God’s wrath!”

Boom!

All of a sudden, Qing Xuzi’s long hair flew up, and a fierce wind burst out with him as the center.

Meanwhile, Qing Xuzi’s Qi started to surge inch by inch!

In the blink of an eye, it had reached a whole new level.

In an instant, the terrifying power was like a tide that pressed on Jian Wushuang.

After all, Jian Wushuang had fought with Qing Xuzi head-on after he had used the original universe. They were evenly matched. Although Qing Xuzi’s power was strong, it was not enough to scare Jian Wushuang.

However, Jian Wushuang felt suffocated by the power.

“What is this?” Jian Wushuang’s body trembled and for the first time, his eyes revealed a look of disbelief.

If Qing Xuzi’s previous strength was one level lower than the Ninth Kalpa King’s, then the feeling that he gave Jian Wushuang now was definitely no less than the Ninth Kalpa King at his peak.

Qing Xuzi had relied on the forbidden technique to possess the battle strength of a Ninth Kalpa King for a short period of time, which was comparable to that of a Supreme.

Jian Wushuang, you really deserve to die! Qing Xuzi said coldly. Only he knew what price he had to pay to use the ‘great void forbidden technique, God’s wrath’.

In order to kill Jian Wushuang, Qing Xuzi was willing to do anything!

Whoosh!

Before Qing Xuzi could finish his sentence, he had already disappeared.
