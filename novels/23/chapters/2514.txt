Chapter 2515: Xiao Clan’s Survivor

Only in a short moment, the 50 cultivators who were previously escorted by the Xueya Escort Team had completely cleared the place. No, it was more accurate to mention that one of those cultivators actually stayed.

That person was none other than Jian Wushuang.

“Oh, there’s actually one who stays behind?” The red-robed old man who was the Demonic Moon Prefecture Governor was intrigued.

Xiao Tiexin and the rest of the Xueya Escort Team experts who stayed back also looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

Everyone else had left except for this man.

Noticing everybody’s glare, the cross-legged Jian Wushuang on the back of the double-horned Thunderous Star Beast smiled awkwardly and said, “Sorry. I truly wished to run, but my beast isn’t listening to my commands. It has become frozen from fear.”

Everybody immediately looked at the double-horned Thunderous Star Beast.

It was true that the beast was shuddering and did not dare to move a muscle.

Wild beasts were fundamentally cowardly. They would not be able to move as long as they felt the auras from strong Divine Demons, let alone being in front of so many Ultimate Gods.

“What an idiot! He’s on the brink of death and still won’t let go of a wild beast?”

The Ultimate Gods from the Demonic Moon Prefecture began to scoff and nobody paid Jian Wushuang any more attention.

“Eldest Miss Xiao, the Xiao clan was one of the top clans in the Northern Darkstar Continent. We hear there were even a few Peak Ultimate Gods not to mention your foundations were extremely strong. Although the clan has been annihilated, perhaps you still possess some family wealth that you brought with you as the sole survivor of the clan?” The Governor stared at Xiao Tiexin with full of anticipation.

Xiao Tiexin stared at the Demonic Moon Prefecture Governor and scoffed, “Mr. Governor, it looks like you’re here for my family’s wealth. As one of the Eighteen Prefectures, you probably have a pretty well-organized intelligence department, yes? Didn’t your agents find out the Territorial Lord has robbed us completely of the clan’s wealth?”

“Yes, our intelligence did state so. However, you escape from the Xiao clan after all. You should’ve brought with you some resources and treasures when you ran. The Xiao clan was so large that even a tiny part brought out—say ten or even five percent—will still amount to huge wealth,” said the Governor.

“Haha. I’m afraid I’ll have to disappoint you, Mr. Governor. I did bring a portion of wealth with me when I left, but that was only the Interspatial Ring which my mother passed to me. My mother’s accumulated wealth only amounted to six thousand pieces of Primordial Stones. If you want it, you can have it. Why did you even utilize such a dramatic tactic?” As Xiao Tiexin spoke, she flipped her wrist and presented an Interspatial Ring.

Lying quietly in the ring were 6,000 pieces of Primordial Stones.

“Six thousand Primordial Stones?”

The Demonic Moon Prefecture’s Ultimate Gods were happy to hear that.

According to market value, one piece of Primordial Stone was equivalent to 10,000 drops of Ancient God Divine Power.

6,000 Primordial Stones meant 60,000,000 drops of Ancient God Divine power. It was a great amount of wealth for any High-Level Ultimate God, let alone a Low-Level Ultimate God.

Even the Demonic Moon Prefecture who accumulated an enormous amount of wealth through the ages could still not ignore 6,000 Primordial Stones.

For those Ultimate Gods, it was worth their time if they could obtain it.

However, the Demonic Moon Prefecture Governor did not look too happy.

6,000 pieces of Primordial Stones were a lot but was still a lot less than what he expected.

The Governor raised his head and said coldly, “Xiao Tiexin, don’t think you can get away with just giving me six thousand Primordial Stones. Perhaps what you carried with you is truly six thousand. However, your clan elders probably didn’t just give you Primordial Stones when you escaped. There are probably treasures which mean a lot to the Xiao clan, some secret techniques, and whatnot. All those are highly valuable stuff—a lot more valuable than the six thousand pieces of Primordial Stones. Surrender all of it.” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Xiao Tiexin’s heart sank.

She did bring some exceptional items when she left, but those items were her growth capital, and some were even for the Xiao clan’s revival—unlike the Primordial Stones.

The Primordial Stones were only a considerable wealth and as long as she became powerful, they were easy to obtain.

However, the rest of the items with her had their clan taken ages to accumulate.

She absolutely could not give up those things.

“Just six thousand Primordial Stones. I don’t have anything else. If you promise to let us leave, I shall respectfully present them to you. Otherwise, we’ll have to fight it out,” responded Xiao Tiexin frostily.

“Fight it out? Haha. Eldest Miss Xiao, perhaps you look too highly upon yourself since you don’t wish to give up the Xiao clan’s treasure. All I can do is to kill you before checking your Interspatial Ring myself.” The Governor sneered as his eyes turned icy-cold. “Do it!”

Boom!

The six Ultimate Gods next to the Governor immediately sprung into action.

Two giant waves of Ultimate God auras began pressing against each other and shocking everyone in the Xueya Escort Team.

“No.2, No.3, be careful. Find your chance to escape!” Xiao Tiexin instructed quietly and dashed forward in a sudden burst.

Purple lights surged from her body as she dashed forward while dragging out a trace of purple shadow. The purple shadow was actually in the form of a purple demon deity. Xiao Tiexin’s aura suddenly surged a great amount when the demon deity appeared.

The bewitching purple sickle also appeared in her hand without needing to mention it.

“Charge!”

Xiao Tiexin’s killing intention rose sky-high as she swung the purple sickle with one hand.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Three bewitching beams of purple blade-light immediately swept outward.

The purple blade-lights were incredibly fast and instantly blocked three Ultimate Gods of the Demonic Moon Prefecture.

The three Ultimate Gods also immediately reacted.

Unexpectedly... Xiao Tiexin’s movements were also extremely mysterious and unpredictable. She flashed and swayed along with her inconsistently flashing blade-lights produced by her purple sickle. It was extremely unpredictable and incredibly powerful.

The three Ultimate Gods joined forces, but could not gain any advantage over Xiao Tiexin. They gradually and eventually fell into a disadvantage.

“Goodness, this woman is really something!” All three of them were shocked in their minds.

At that very moment, the Governor who was behind the whole time stepped forward.

“Haha! Eldest Miss Xiao, let me experience your skills!”

The Governor laughed heartily and a bright red stone staff appeared in his hands. The battle strength of a high-level Ultimate God blasted outward.

Boom!

A staff shadow appeared out of the blue in the void above and began hitting down at Xiao Tiexin like huge waves.

The staff shadow was heaven-defying as it sealed up the void around Xiao Tiexin the moment it appeared and not giving her a chance to dodge. She could only swing her purple sickle to fend those attacks off by force.
