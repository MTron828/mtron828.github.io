Chapter 2856: Outside the Dragon-Phoenix Pavilion

——

Today, the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion would hold a grand opening of the Dragon-phoenix list, inviting various forces and experts of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow to attend the ceremony. The news had long since spread, and many forces in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow… including those experts, would also attend the ceremony.

Now, in front of the majestic mountain gate, an endless stream of experts came to attend the ceremony.

Jian Wushuang followed closely and soon arrived at the mountain gate.

“Sir, I wonder which realm or force you are from. Do you have an invitation letter from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion?” A Great Divine Master of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion stopped Jian Wushuang and asked with a smile.

“My name is Sword One, and I’m from the Sword Alliance of the Pill Sun Sacred World. As for the invitation letter, I don’t have one,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Sword Alliance?” The Great Divine Master frowned slightly.

“What? Do I have to have an invitation letter to attend the ceremony?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Not really. The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion is inviting experts from all over the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. As long as they have reached a certain level of strength, they can participate,” the Great Divine Master said with a smile.

“In that case…” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed, and a powerful divine power aura immediately erupted from his body.

He had already broken through to the initial Great Divine Master level, so the divine power aura he emitted under cover of Black Rock was that of a Peak Great Divine Master.

When his divine power aura erupted, the surrounding people were immediately attracted to him.

“A Peak Great Divine Master?”

“This person is actually an expert at the level of a Peak Great Divine Master.”

“There are not many Peak Great Divine Masters in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. Who is this person? Why have I never seen him before?”

Many people began to discuss.

The Great Divine Master from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion immediately smiled. “Since you are a Peak Great Divine Master, you are naturally qualified to participate in this ceremony. However, since you have entered the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, I hope you can fully abide by the rules of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and not act rashly.”

“Of course,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Please.” The Great Divine Master waved his hand.

Jian Wushuang smiled and was about to walk into the mountain gate.

However, at this moment, there was a sudden commotion on the steps below.

Jian Wushuang looked over and saw a handsome young man in luxurious woolen clothes slowly walking toward the mountain gate, surrounded by a group of people.

The young man was not very strong and was only at the Advanced Divine Master level. However, the people around him were emitting powerful auras, all at the Peak Divine Master level, especially the cold middle-aged man standing next to him.

The divine power aura emitted by the cold middle-aged man was above that of a Peak Divine Master.

“It’s Young Master Qu!”

“The young master of the Heaven Curve World Lord, the person beside him, oh my god, it’s the Black Blood Emperor.”

“That Heaven Curve World Lord really dotes on Young Master Qu. Although the heaven curve world is relatively large in the Golden Crow Nine Realms, it only has two unrivaled reverent deities. But now, this Heaven Curve World Lord actually sent an unrivaled reverent deity to protect Young Master Qu personally. This treatment, tsk tsk…”

The experts in the surroundings all sighed.

For these experts to come to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion to attend the ceremony, they all had a certain background or strength. Naturally, their knowledge was extraordinary as well.

For example, Young Master Qu and the Black-blood Emperor all knew about this.

Young Master Qu did not need to say much. He was the only son of the Skysong realm lord. Also, everyone knew how much Young Master Qu adored that Young Phoenix of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. So it was only natural for him to attend this ceremony.

But what truly shocked everyone was the arrival of the Black Blood Emperor.

The Black Blood Emperor was an Invincible Divine Master.

In the entire Golden Crow Nine Realms, there was only a handful of Invincible Divine Masters. Any one of them had an extremely high status, and even the Undying Sage would not look down on an Invincible Divine Master.

After all, the various realms of the Golden Crow Nine Realms had long agreed. Nevertheless, there were some things that the Undying Sage could not do personally, and he could only rely on the Invincible Divine Master under him.

Therefore, even the Immortal Saint would be very polite to these Invincible Divine Masters under normal circumstances.

But now, everyone knew why Master Qu came to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. However, the realm Lord Tian Qu had arranged for an Invincible Divine Master to accompany him showed how much the realm lord pampered him.

At the same time that Master Qu arrived, two figures flew over from the void in the distance.

These two figures were more high-profile than the others. Most of the experts who came to watch the ceremony, such as Jian Wushuang, first rushed to the foot of the mountain and then walked up the stairs step by step. However, these two people did not have any scruples. They landed directly in front of the mountain gate.

One of them was old, and the other was young.

The young man was handsome and elegant, and the aura he emitted was also powerful. Although he had not reached the level of Invincible Divine Master, he was definitely solid among the Peak Great Divine Masters. He was very close to Invincible Divine Master.

As for the older man next to him, he was even more impressive.

The older man was dressed in a black robe. His face was cold, and his eyes were extremely turbid. There was no aura emanating from his body. Yet, at first glance, he looked like an ordinary older man.

However, seeing the black-robed older man, not only the experts present, even Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank.

Because he felt tremendous pressure from the Elder.

With his current strength, the Elder’s identity was beyond doubt.

Immortal saint!

The black-robed elder was a genuine Immortal Saint!

“The Star Point Pavilion is from the Star Point Pavilion!” The leader was the young master of the Star Point Pavilion, Chi Ming. It was said that he was an out-and-out genius. In the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, except for the Young Phoenix and Hidden Dragon of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, he was the most talented. In addition, Chi Ming seemed to be one of the admirers of the Young Phoenix.”

“Tsk tsk, both Young Master Qu and Chi Ming are the pursuers of the Young Phoenix. So now, these two people actually came to the Dragon-phoenix pavilion at the same time. This is really interesting.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Many people in the surroundings revealed excited expressions and were waiting to watch the show.

As expected, Chi Ming appeared in front of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s mountain gate. His gaze swept over and soon froze on Young Master Qu.

“Isn’t this Young Master Qu? You also came to Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and coincidentally bumped into me. It’s quite a coincidence.” Chi Ming smiled, but there was a hint of amusement on his face.

“Humph, you and I came to watch the ceremony. We just happened to bump into each other. So what’s there to be a coincidence?” Young Master Qu snorted coldly, but there was a hint of surprise in his eyes.

Jian Wushuang could see that there was some fear in his eyes.
