Chapter 2740: Devilish Wind King’s Backing

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Devilish Wind King, you’ve hidden so deeply!!!” Saber Master tightened his fists as his eyes were filled with anger while he stared at Devilish Wind King and the figure that suddenly appeared beside him.

However, Devilish Wind King only smiled coldly.

On the other hand, the figure beside him was a bald man that was almost two meters tall. The bald man seemed lifeless without a hint of vitality and was another corpse puppet.

However, gentle golden lights were being released from his body.

Gold... Gold-armored Corpse Puppet!!

The bald man was a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet!!

Previously, they chose to run without any hesitation when they were in the cemetery as they did not dare to fight a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet whenever they came across one.

Every Gold-armored Corpse Puppet had the combat power of a Peak Grand Ultimate God.

However, the Devilish Wind King had waved his hand and taken out a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet at that moment?

“Saber Master, I have to admit that both items that you previously obtained during these two trips to the secret realm—the purple clock on your body and the Holy Treasure battle saber are extremely rare. The precious items you obtained must be the best compared to the rest. Unfortunately, my luck is better than yours!!” Devilish Wind King smiled.

“The first item I obtained fifty years ago when I came to this secret realm with all of you is this Gold-armored Corpse Puppet. The item I obtained this time is also a corpse puppet.” Devilish Wind King once again waved his hand as he spoke before another figure appeared beside him.

It was another corpse puppet but with a gentle silver light being released from its body. It was a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet.

A Gold-armored Corpse Puppet and a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet stood next to the Devilish Wind King with one on the right while the other on the left. Devilish Wind King had a ghastly smile on his face.

Saber Master’s expression had grown extremely dark.

He never imagined the two precious items Devilish Wind King obtained from the secret realm were two corpse puppets. The Silver-armored Corpse Puppet was still fine but he even obtained a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet which had the combat power comparable to a Peak Grand Ultimate God.

“No wonder... No wonder you tried your best to get them to kill me. You wanted to get rid of the others with my power before dealing with me using your full strength,” said Saber Master in a low voice.

Devilish Wind King also directly admitted, “Indeed, if I directly took action when Hong Chen and Long Xianzi were still here, I’ll still be able to overpower all of you with the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet. However, if you were able to keep the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet occupied for a moment, Hong Chen and Long Xianzi would be able to take action and could’ve easily killed me as I’m quite weak.

“However, Hong Chen and Long Xianzi have died while Su Han escaped—leaving just the two of us. Apart from that, the power from Long Xianzi’s Meteorite Bead just now had wounded you. Under such circumstances, the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet from my two corpse puppets would be enough to kill you while the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet will be guarding me—leaving you with no opportunities!

“You’re sure to die!

“Kill!” Devilish Wind King yelled coldly and ordered the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet beside him.

The two meters tall Gold-armored Corpse Puppet’s horrendous aura was immediately unleashed. Its humongous body transformed into a stream of golden light before directly attacking Saber Master.

Saber Master’s facial expression darkened as he immediately swung the battle saber in his hands. A glaring crimson saber-light fiercely slashed outward.

Saber Master had activated a huge portion of the Holy Treasure’s power.

However, the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet did not retreat when seeing the crimson saber-light. It also had a huge saber in his hands and straight-forwardly slashed forward fiercely.

Clank!

The crimson saber-light immediately dimmed down with a loud bang as Saber Master was sent flying backward. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“The power of a Peak Grand Ultimate God...” Saber Master’s facial expression darkened.

It was true that he was extremely strong and considered one of the top powerhouses among High-level Grand Ultimate Gods. He was almost invincible among High-level Grand Ultimate Gods when combined with his Holy Treasure. Ordinary High-level Grand Ultimate Gods such as Hong Chen and Long Xianzi were easily defeated by him even though they had used many means and precious items.

However, he was unable to compete against a true Peak Grand Ultimate God regardless of how powerful he was.

The Gold-armored Corpse Puppet indeed had the combat power of a Peak Grand Ultimate God.

Apart from that, the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet was too peremptory.

He was much more brutal compared to Saber Master and was extremely fast as the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet rushed toward Saber Master. The saber in his hands was extremely strong as he waved it crazily, purely suppressing Saber Master with his strength.

The saber-light was swift and carried thunderous power as it completely locked onto Saber Master. Saber Master could only helplessly withstand the attack with his saber.

However, he was completely crushed by the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet’s terrifying power during every collision with the residual power affecting the purple clock on the surface of his body.

Every collision carried such results and after dozens of times, the purple color of the purple clock on the surface of his body had become extremely dull as though it was going to completely break.

“D*mn it, I can’t hold it anymore.” Saber Master’s complexion had turned slightly pale.

Although the purple clock was a powerful defensive item, it was not completely invincible.

The purple clock soon reached its endurance limit after repeatedly facing such strong impacts over and over again under such collision and overpowering strikes.

Finally, the purple clock covering Saber Master’s body directly broke with a loud bang.

A strong collision directly impacted Saber Master’s divine body and caused him to let out a muffled humph as blood immediately trickled from the corners of his mouth.

“Haha... He finally fails to withstand the attack. Gold-armored Corpse Puppet, kill him!!” Devilish Wing King had been observing from a void not far away and was delighted when he saw the purple clock on Saber Master’s body surface had broken down.

Saber Master naturally entailed strenuous effort to withstand the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet without the purple clock’s protection.

His divine body had also failed to withstand the continuous collisions, hence his wounds worsened while his aura grew weaker.

Saber Master had undoubtedly been forced to his very limits.

‘I’ll die if this continues.’ Saber Master looked at the dark voids around him with cold eyes. It was not that he did not want to escape but he was different from Jian Wushuang. He was unfamiliar with Space-time Law and could not travel speedily. Apart from that, the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet was much faster than him and would not give him any chance to escape.

He also thought about killing Devilish Wing King but the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet blocking him was giving huge pressures—disabling him to do anything else. The most important matter was Devilish Wind King still had a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet by his side. Even if he was lucky enough to get rid of the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet and arrived in front of Devilish Wing King, Devilish Wing King could still stop him by getting the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet to take action.

Just when Saber Master was forced into desperation and thinking hard to form countermeasures.

“Hmmm?” Saber Master’s expression suddenly wavered because he noticed a figure had arrived in the void not far behind Devilish Wind King.
