Chapter 1250: The Holy Prefecture

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Since the Chillywind Valley is full of dangers, the Blood Coldwind is definitely not the only one danger within. I have integrated three strongest Sword Principles and become a Universe Master. Furthermore, my two Original Bodies have become a whole as well. So, if I die here again, I cannot reborn anymore.”

“Forget it…”

Jian Wushuang sighed slightly. He gave up the idea of going deep into the Chillywind Valley and flew out of it.

Right at this moment, a flash of red light shone at the bottom of the Chillywind Valley.

It was extremely chilling and after a short while, it disappeared again.

After regaining the Blaze Quicksand Gourd, Jian Wushuang returned to the Battle Fortress immediately.

His journey seemed smooth, but it took him nearly 10 years in fact.

During this period, the war in the Green Fire World had nearly come to the end.

Although the Green Fire World had been thrown into turmoil due to the great loss of its experts, it calmed down under the suppression of Tang Emperor and the other Palace Masters.

12 years after the final war, Palace Master Yun came to Jian Wushuang.

“Palace Master Wushuang, we have set up that formation.” Palace Master Yun said.

“Finished? So fast.” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed slightly.

“Although it’s complicated, Master Xuan Yi has left the clear steps of setting it up in the token. As for the necessary sources, we can get what we want at the Fire Point Exchange Office. Besides, the foundation of the former formation still exists, so it’s not that difficult for us to set it up again.” Palace Master Yun said smilingly.

“With the protection of this formation, our Green Fire World finally can live in a peaceful life again.” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Palace Master Wushuang, there’s one more thing.” Palace Master Yun added.

Jian Wushuang looked at Palace Master Yun.

“After the formation was set up, I found that there’s someone who has been trying to recover the tunnel connecting our world and the outside world. This person’s skills are very brilliant. If I guess correctly, that person should be the woman who activated the Enduring Samsara Formation before.” Palace Master Yun said seriously, “Among the remaining experts of the Jin Kingdom, only she could have such a capability on formations.”

“That woman?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes suddenly turned grim.

They were referring to Jiu Xi, of course.

At the final war, she escaped while noticing the situation was unfavorable.

“Palace Master Yun, since you could feel that she is trying to recover the Portal, I guess you know her location.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Of course. That’s why I came here to inform you of her location.” Palace Master Yun said with a smile.

“Great!” Jian Wushuang clasped his hands and asked, “Then tell me please.”

After knowing Jiu Xi’s current location, Jian Wushuang set off at once.

A cold and elegant woman, Jiu Xi, stood in a secluded Void above the huge battlefield, with some formation flags floating in front of her. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

These flags were giving off a formidable aura.

Obviously, Jiu Xi was setting up a formation. To be precise, she was destroying a formation.

She was trying to destroy the huge formation that the Green Fire World’s experts had set up around the battlefield.

Because it was connected with the space storm around this battlefield, so she paid a huge price and then succeeded in allowing the army of the Jin Kingdom to intrude into the formation. Now, it was impossible for her to destroy it again on her own.

However, she did not plan to totally destroy it. She wished to destroy a small part of it so that it could allow her to send a message out.

She enjoyed some reputation in her sect, so only if she could send a message to the experts of her sect, someone would come and save her.

“Damn, I’m almost made it, but the Green Fire World suddenly changed another formation, which was several times more complicated than before!” Jiu Xi gritted her teeth and her facial expression changed.

When she came to this battlefield with the monarch of the Jin Kingdom, she had never expected the monarch to die here. Therefore, she had not prepared any route of retreat for herself.?Now, she was trapped in this battlefield and it was really difficult for her to contact with the outside world.

Right at this moment…

Whoosh!

An invisible power swept across this Void.

Jiu Xi perceived that and turned around as soon as possible. She saw a young figure showing up behind her.

“Jian Wushuang?” Jiu Xi turned pale with fright. “How is this possible? How could you find me? Did…”

A possibility came to her mind at once. Her located had been presumably figured out by him while she was destroying the formation.

Looking at the elegant woman who had gotten into a panic, Jian Wushuang lifted his hands slowly. An immense amount of power had already gathered in his hand.

“No, Jian Wushuang, you can not kill me!”

Jiu Xi screamed right now. She knew Jian Wushuang’s strength clearly. Although she had some life-saving skills, they simply did not work at all when she was facing experts like Jian Wushuang.

“Can not kill you? Give me a reason!” Jian Wushuang said in a cold voice and the power continued gathering in his hand.

“I am a Core Disciple of the Holy Prefecture and my Teacher is one of the four Mansion Masters. I also have a Senior Brother—Universe God Qing Yang, who is the first genius of the Holy Prefecture!” Jiu Xi screamed continuously.

“Besides, each Core Disciple of the Holy Prefecture has learnt a Secret Skill that is similar to curse. If you kill me, you will be cursed by me. And someday, any Core Disciple or high-level experts of the Holy Prefecture can recognize that you have killed an important member of their sect at first glance. They surely will try their best to revenge against you!”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang’s eyebrow lifted and he asked, “Is there any such Secret Skill in the Eternal Chaotic World?”

“Yes.” Gu King nodded his heart.

“Jian Wushuang.” Jiu Xi looked at him again, “I know you are a genius and have great potential. You definitely will travel around the Eternal Chaotic World, where my sect is one of the overlords on the first territory you will set foot on. If you kill me, don’t expect that you will be safe there.”

“Killing me will not do any good to you, instead, it will be extremely difficult for you to venture into the Eternal Chaotic World.”

“If you let me go, I promise I will introduce you to join the Holy Prefecture. That will be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for you.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly and the power he had gather burst forth.

A flash of Flowing Light shot toward the woman instantly!

“You!”

Jiu Xi’s eyes were wide with disbelief. She had explained everything to Jian Wushuang so clearly, but the latter still struck her.

“If I die, you won’t be able to live a good life!”

Jiu Xi shouted angrily when she knew she would die. She triggered the Secret Skill she mentioned earlier and a little bit power swarmed into Jian Wushuang’s body.
