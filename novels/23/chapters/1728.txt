Chapter 1729: Jian Wushuang’s Maid

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

After knowing Jian Wushuang’s objective for coming, the experts in the Parting Hatred Island had puzzled expressions.

“How can I not know that my Parting Hatred Island imprisoned someone from the Lineage of Star? Elder Li Yun, what’s going on?” the Parting Hatred Island Master’s eyes turned cold and he looked at the red-robed old man known as Li Yun.

Although he was the Island Master, he had left most of the small matters in the Parting Hatred Island to Li Yun. For example, he indeed had no idea of the matter this time around.

“Island Master, there is indeed such a matter. However, I did an investigation previously. That woman is merely a normal maid of the Lineage of Star. However, she has killed quite a number of the Parting Hatred Island’s disciples. Hence, I got people to capture her and I also sent a message to the Lineage of Star to discuss this matter together,” Li Yun broke out in a cold sweat.

Previously, he had gotten the news that an expert from the Lineage of Star would come over to discuss about this matter. However, he totally did not expect that the person who would come from the Lineage of Star would be Jian Wushuang…

“That woman is a maid under me. Moreover, she is a maid who I like the most,” Jian Wushuang said bluntly.

Upon hearing that, the expressions of many experts of the Parting Hatred Island as well Li Yun changed greatly.

They could not care less if it were a normal maid from the Lineage of Star. However, what if it were Jian Wushuang’s maid? Moreover, if it was a maid who he liked the most… then, it would be different.

“Lord Jian Wushuang.” The Parting Hatred Island Master stood up and said straight away: “Lord, please forgive us for our crime. The Parting Hatred Island did not know about the relationship between that woman and the Lord in advance. If I’d known, even if I were able to pluck up even more courage, I would definitely not dare to make things difficult for her.”

“Yes, my Lord. Back then, when we captured that woman, she only said that she was a maid of the Lineage of Star and she did not reveal her relationship to you,” Li Yun said immediately.

For this matter, they indeed had had no idea about it.

“It’s alright.” Jian Wushuang waved his hands, “Please bring her over first.”

“Get down to it right away,” the Parting Hatred Island Master shot a glance toward Li Yun.

“Understood,” Li Yun left immediately.

“Lord Jian Wushuang, for this matter…” the Parting Hatred Island Master still wanted to say something.

“Let’s continue talking after she comes,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

Upon seeing that, the Parting Hatred Island Master stopped speaking and he could only wait quietly at his position.

Within the Parting Hatred Island, there was a lofty palace. The palace was the law enforcement hall of the Parting Hatred Island.

For an expert or disciple who had committed a crime within the Parting Hatred Island or had caused some trouble outside, he would be sent to the law enforcement hall for his punishment.

In a secret room in the inner part of the law enforcement hall.

At the center of the secret room was a seal. Within the seal, a beautiful woman with a great figure was sitting down with her legs crossed.

The beautiful woman was Jian Wushuang’s maid, Qiu Yue.

At present, Qiu Yue’s expression was a bit pale and her aura was weak. She was in quite a miserable state.

In front of the seal, there was a chair. In the chair sat a young man who wore a luxurious long robe with a jade-like face and one of his legs was stuck over the other. As he looked at Qiu Yue, who was inside the seal, his eyes were filled with relish.

“Hehe, I did not expect that piece of trash who died back then to have such a good little sister. Not only are you pretty, your talents are also not too bad. However, it’s a pity that you are still a bit lacking. If you were a bit stronger, you might have been able to take revenge for that trashy brother of yours.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Qiu Yue’s icy-cold eyes were staring at the young man and she was filled with dissatisfaction.

Just a bit more. Just a bit more and she would have been able to kill the person in front of her and gotten revenge for her brother.

“Why? Are you dissatisfied?” The young man laughed evilly, “No matter how dissatisfied you are, it’s useless. You will never have a chance again.”

“Although you are someone from the Lineage of Star, you are still a normal maid in the end. Since your position is too low, the Lineage of Star will absolutely not care about your fate. The Parting Hatred Island has merely sent the Lineage of Star a message to find a way out of their situation. After that, even if the Parting Hatred Island were to kill you, the Lineage of Star would not say anything.”

“Hence… you’re dead. Moreover, I would kill you personally. You would look on as I stab my saber into your heart. There would not be any room for you to struggle.”

The young man’s voice echoed within the secret room repeatedly.

Upon hearing that, Qiu Yue who was in the seal laughed coldly and her eyes were filled with disdain.

Although she was currently captured alive by the Parting Hatred Island, she knew that the Parting Hatred Island would definitely not kill her.

The reason being that was that her Master was Jian Wushuang!

With such an identity, the Lineage of Star would absolutely not leave her alone.

“Why? Even though you are already in such a situation, do you think that you will be able to continue living?” the young man swept his eyes over Qiu Yue with ridicule.

However, just then… the big door of the secret room opened abruptly. After that, escorted by some disciples, the red-robed old man, Li Yun, walked inside anxiously.

“Elder Li Yun, why have you come?”

The young man stood up immediately and revealed a friendly smile. He was completely different from before.

Upon seeing the young man in front, Li Yun became filled with anger and he swung his hand fiercely.

“Slap!”

A clear, melodious sound of a slap could be heard. The young man spit out a mouthful of blood at once and his body was sent flying ruthlessly.

“Damn little kid!”

Li Yun scolded with a low voice. He was too lazy to take another glance at that young man and he walked straight to the front of the seal.

The flames of fury that Li Yun originally had became nonexistent and he revealed a gentle smile, “Miss Qiu Yue, please leave with me.”

“Where are we going?” Qiu Yue asked.

“To the big hall. Lord Jian Wushuang is waiting for you there,” Li Yun said.

“Master?” Qiu Yue’s body shook at once, “Master has actually come himself?”

In no time, Li Yun got rid of the seal and showed Qiu Yue to the big hall. At the same time, he looked at the astonished young man who was hiding at the corner of the wall again, “Mo Tao, follow us as well. This matter happened because of you. Now that you have caused trouble, don’t think that we will let you off with just a slap.”

“I, I…” before the young man Mo Tan could even say anything, he was taken away by two disciples of the Parting Hatred Island forcibly and they headed to the big hall together.

In the big hall, Jian Wushuang and the Parting Hatred Island Master were sitting at its highest point and they were looking at Qiu Yue, Mo Tao and the few people who walked in.

“Master.”

Qiu Yue greeted Jian Wushuang immediately and she had mixed feelings.

She did not send a rescue message to Jian Wushuang at the start as she did not want to disturb him. After all, she was just a lowly maid. Moreover, she had merely provoked the Parting Hatred Sect and it was a small matter that was too insignificant to be brought up. Hence, it could be resolved with the Lineage of Star showing themselves.

However, Qiu Yue did not expect Jian Wushuang to come personally.

“Eh?” As Jian Wushuang looked at Qiu Yue, his eyes turned grave. It was not because of the fact that he had seen Qiu Yue’s injuries. Instead, it was because of the fact that he had seen the aura that she was emitting.

Her aura had achieved the level of a Real God.
