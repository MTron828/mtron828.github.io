Chapter 2790: Strength?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Over the years, Jian Wushuang had broken through to the realm of a divine master. He had obtained 50,000 divine elixirs from the battle saber and many divine elixirs from killing saber master and the others in the secret realm, under the cover of the black stone, he was indeed emitting the divine power aura of a senior divine master.

Therefore, the east god naturally regarded Jian wushuang as a senior great divine master.

The gap between a senior great divine master and a peak great divine master seemed to be one step away, but in fact, the gap was astonishing.

The difference in the power of divine power alone was more than ten times, and it was almost impossible to overcome.

The East God’s mocking words were also reasonable.

However, after hearing the east God’s words, Jian wushuang smiled indifferently and said, “East God, do you think your divine power is so strong that you will definitely surpass me?”

“HMM?”East God frowned. Jian wushuang’s smile made him feel a little uneasy.

Sure enough, Jian Wushuang’s body suddenly shook.

Immediately after, the divine power aura emitted from his body began to surge at an alarming speed.

The speed of the surge was also very terrifying.

In the blink of an eye, he had risen from an advanced great divine master to a peak great divine master!

Seven-star secret skill!

Jian wushuang finally used the seven-star secret skill, which was enough to upgrade himself to a higher level.

However, the seven-star secret skill had always been one of the top secret skills that Jian wushuang relied on.

Once this secret skill was used, his strength would skyrocket.

However, since the beginning of the battle, Jian Wushuang had never used this skill, whether it was when he defeated the Blood Thunder King and the others, or when he fought with the Allied forces of the four major forces, he was saving a trump card for himself.

Even so, with his divine power, which was far stronger than that of his peers as a perfect chaotic creature, and his 100,000-feet-tall Heaven Punisher, and the nine luminaries star armor armor, which increased his power by six times.., his power was already infinitely close to that of a peak great divine master.

In addition to his various secret skills, he could fight a slightly weaker peak great divine master head-on in such a state.

Now, he had finally used the seven-star secret skill as his trump card.

His cultivation was at the peak of the Divine Master Realm. Now that he had used the seven-star secret skill, his realm had reached the level of an elementary great divine master. Under the cover of the black stone, his divine power aura naturally rose to the level of a peak great divine master.

The strength of his divine power naturally soared, and so did his overall strength!

Boom! Boom

Jian wushuang stood in the void, his divine power surging, and the tyrannical aura of divine power unscrupulously swept out.

At the same time, as the strength of his divine power greatly increased, the power of his domain, which had been spreading across the entire battlefield, also skyrocketed.

Previously, his domain had only suppressed master Dongfang’s domain, but now it was completely suppressed.

The experts of the Allied army of the four forces were also much more suppressed on the battlefield.

Jian wushuang’s eyes were cold as he stared at the East God in the void.

The East God also sensed the change in Jian Wushuang’s divine power aura, and his pupils could not help shrinking.

“East God, didn’t you just say that I’m not qualified to compete with you in strength? Now... Let’s try again!”Jian wushuang smiled indifferently. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He remained still, but the nine underworld blood divine swords in front of him reassembled again.

It was also a giant black tree filled with vast samsara power, but when the giant black tree rushed out again, its momentum and power were ten times stronger than before!

Boom!

The giant black tree suddenly rushed out, and the void trembled wherever it passed.

East God clenched his teeth tightly, and a surge of divine power gathered on the giant axe in his right hand. The Aura on his body also soared to the limit.

“Get lost! !”

With another furious roar, East God once again swung the giant axe in his hand.

This giant axe was powerful and heavy, and it carried a world-shaking might. It wanted to send the giant black tree flying once again.

But this time..

Bang! !

As the giant black tree and the giant axe collided, two explosive powers exploded at the same time.

The giant black tree and the giant axe had collided once before, but the giant black tree was sent flying and almost disintegrated.

But now, the outcome was completely reversed.

“What?”

East God widened his eyes and looked at his palm in disbelief. He could feel a violent force coming from his palm and the giant axe. This force was so strong that the giant axe in his hand almost fell out of his hand.

The force went along his arm and hit his divine body.

“Humph!”

East God could not help but grunt, but he immediately retreated.

This collision was actually a direct blow to East God.

“Haha, East God, as a peak great divine master, your divine power is only so-so,”Jian wushuang said with a sneer.

“How is this possible?”East God was a little confused and could not believe what was happening.

He was clearly overwhelmed by the previous collision, but now, in the blink of an eye, the situation had been completely reversed. He was being suppressed and crushed?

How could the divine power of sword one be so strong? It was much stronger than that of a peak great divine master like him.

In his opinion, this power was not much weaker than palace master Nan Wu, the number one expert on the Pill Sun Continent.

“East God, weren’t you very proud just now? Now, let’s Do It Again!”Jian wushuang’s eyes turned cold. The giant black wood formed by the nine Netherblood divine swords trembled slightly, and then gathered a shocking power to charge at the East God.

Seeing the giant black wood charging toward him again, the East God clenched his teeth, and a trace of madness surged in his eyes.

“I don’t believe it!”

The violent divine power rose from the East God’s body, and he completely transformed into a peerless fierce beast. At the same time, his divine body was covered by a layer of blood-red light.

The appearance of this blood-red light also increased his divine power aura slightly.

“Kill! !”

East God was incomparably ruthless as he unleashed his full strength. He held a huge axe in each of his hands, and the two huge axes slashed out time and time again, colliding head-on with the ferocious charging black huge tree, they clashed together.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The collision after collision caused a shocking explosion.

And even if East God used a secret art, in terms of offensive power, his huge axe was clearly inferior to the second reincarnation sword formation by a large margin. Every collision was an absolute disadvantage for him.
