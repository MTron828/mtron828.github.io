Chapter 2230 Too?

Jian Wushuang fell silent.He knew what happened after that.

After the land was blocked by the formation, cut away from the Absolute Beginning Divine World, many experts, including the Seven Star Black Sect that remained, were all damaged by it. The restriction had forced them to a deep slumber as well, leading to the end of the Ancient Era.

Everything after that was publicly known.

As the restriction grew larger, the spiritual influence of heaven and earth grew thinner and with fewer experts, then the First Era, then the current Second Era.

“Do you know who placed the formation?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The expert was strong, even as good as the Master of the Holy Land. I do not know of his past, but I heard the Divine Dream Heaven Sect leader mention a name, “Xuan Yi”,” Jian Er said.

Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank sharply.

Xuan Yi!

His master, Xuan Yi.

When he had asked Jian Yi, he too had said that the formation that had led to experts into deep slumber was a man named Xuan Yi.

“The formation was really placed by Master?” Jian Wushuang was taken aback.

He knew how scary the formation was.

The formation forcibly split the land from the rest of the Absolute Beginning Divine World.

The Absolute Beginning Divine World had countless experts, but could never come over.

The restrictions were all caused by the formation!

“No wonder back at the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds, Master had been about to control and add the restrictions to Blood Emperor,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

The restrictions had been created by Xuan Yi.

The restrictions were from that formation.

Xuan Yi, being the creator of the formation, could naturally control it.

Jian Wushuang thought to himself, and a painting floated in his mind.

The painting was the same Ancient image he had seen in the Chillywind Valley.

The painting depicted a burly man with a big forehead, surrounded by countless experts.

But even then, the man would not give up and crumbled heaven and earth.

That image gave Jian Wushuang a feeling that it was the one Jian Er had just mentioned.

The moves that the man made were probably to activate the formation.

If that was the case... then the man’s identity...

Jian Wushuang shook his head and stopped thinking about it.

“Jian Er, since you received news about Heaven’s Horizon opening a path 3,900 years later to Absolute Beginning Divine World, that means it was not just the three of you that woke up, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Definitely,” Jian Er nodded. “But I do not know how many woke up,”

Jian Wushuang nodded, but that slightly stressed him.

He was currently undefeatable in his era.

But he was nothing compared to those Ancient experts. If not for the restrictions, Jian Wushuang would be nothing but a tiny ant in their eyes.

But, even with the restrictions, those Ancient Era experts were not to be messed with. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He took a deep breath and pulled out a token.

“Emperor Bai,” Jian Wushuang was transmitting to him.

“Jian Wushuang, what is it?” Emperor Bai replied.

“I just came back from the Real Martial Arts Divine Church, and met with some Ancient Era experts,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Ancient Era experts? You too?”

Emperor Bai’s voice deepened.

“Too?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes squinted. “Guess you know too.”

“Transmission’s not convenient. Come over to Thunderbolt Island, we can talk about this face to face,” Emperor Bai said.

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Soon, he turned his ship to head towards Thunderbolt Island.

Along the way, he continued to ask Jian Er some questions about the Absolute Beginning Divine World and took time to investigate Jian Er and his brothers’ Qian Kun Ring.

They were Ancient Era experts after all – their treasures were nothing ordinary.

Jian Wushuang found many valuable items. Ten-odd divine weapons when combining all three Qian Kun Rings, each had a genuine Chaos Divine Weapon, with several defensive armours.

There were eight secret skills as well, all formidable, but it was a pity that Jian Wushuang had no use for it.

There were fewer treasures.

Especially natural treasures and elixirs.

Ancient Era experts needed large amounts of natural treasures and elixirs to maintain their powers, it was no wonder that they had all been used up. That was why the three brothers had remained within the Real Martial Arts Divine Church – they had needed them to gather resources.

The rewards were plentiful.

Though Jian Wushuang had no use for them, he could pass them down to Green Fire World and Lineage of Stars, especially the eight secret skills. One of the secret skills of body refinery could not be compared to Jian Wushuang’s Immemorial Celestial Body, but was much better than Eternal Chaotic World’s own protective secret skills.

He passed it to He Xiu immediately.

After a simple check, He Xiu found a use for it.

After that, both of them went their separate ways.

He Xiu returned to the Lineage of Stars, whereas Jian Wushuang made his way to Thunderbolt Island.

Thunderbolt Island, within the Presbytery Pavilion.

The Presbytery Pavilion was where the higher-ups of the Sanctuary Alliance gathered. But only Emperor Bai was around.

Emperor Bai could tell the moment Jian Wushuang stepped into the Presbytery Pavilion.

“Hmm?”

“A breakthrough?” Emperor Bai looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

He could sense a great change in Jian Wushuang’s aura.

That can only happen when one advanced from the second stage of the seventh step to the final stage.

Without a doubt, Jian Wushuang had surpassed himself.

“How could you do it so quickly?” Emperor Bai was shocked.

He practised Inverse Cultivation as well – he knew how hard it was.

It needed a large amount of Divine Power.
