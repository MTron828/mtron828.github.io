Two Sword Soul Phantoms, each nearly 100 feet tall, rose behind Jian Wushuang, tall and straight, with majesty and a towering Sword Essence.

“They are...”

Both Jin Ling and Mu Shan were struck dumb with amazement.

“Sword Soul Phantom!”

“Two Sword Soul Phantoms, and so tall!”

“Double First-grade Sword Souls!”

They were stunned.

“This explains it. That’s why you only took three days to pass the second trial!” Jin Ling looked at Jian Wushuang with a solemn face.

“First-grade Sword Soul?” Jian Wushuang was surprised, then his Sword Soul Phantoms vanished.

“Are there different grades of Sword Soul?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course.” Jin Ling nodded solemnly and explained, “Sword Soul, only talented experts can awaken it, and the more talented they are in Sword Principle, the more powerful the Sword Soul they awaken will be!”

“Just like magic weapons, manuals, and elixirs, Sword Soul is classified into three grades.”

“At the height of the Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline, only a few geniuses awakened Sword Souls, but most of them were second-grade or third-grade. It’s rare to see a first grade.”

“Not only that, very few can awaken more than one Sword Soul!”

“Super geniuses are totally able to awaken two or more!”

“At his peak, the Sword Ancestor commanded seven Sword Emperors. They were top experts and every one of them awakened multiple Sword Souls!”

“Seven Sword Emperors?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

“The more Sword Soul one awakes, the more helpful it is in comprehending Sword Principle and Origin. What’s more, if a Sword Soul forms a spectral image, it also improves one’s strength significantly. And the higher grade a Sword Soul is, the more powerful it is!”

“Sword Soul is classified into three grades. A third-grade spectral image is less than 30 feet high!”

“Sword Soul Phantoms of the second grade go up to 60 feet!”

“However, first-grade Sword Soul Phantoms can be as tall as 90 feet.”

“You have two, and both Sword Soul Phantoms are nearly 100 feet tall.?They are definitely Double First-grade Sword Souls,” Jin Ling said.

“They are?” Jian Wushuang blinked.

His Sword Soul Phantoms were tall, both reaching about 100 feet in height.

If a Sword Soul’s grade was judged by its height, he had Double First-grade Sword Souls.

Jin Ling paused, then she continued, “A first-grade Sword Soul is rare, and having Double First-grade Sword Souls is incredible!”

“Most importantly, you awakened them at such a young age.”

“It’s possible for you to have a third one in the future!”

“A third one?” Jian Wushuang commented and smiled.

He didn’t know much about Sword Souls before, so he also did not know anything about Double Sword Souls. But, now he knew, and Double Sword Souls was not the limit.

“Jin Ling, you said that the more talented one was in Sword Principle, the more Sword Soul they would awaken. How many Sword Souls did the Sword Ancestor have? What was their grade?” Jian Wushuang asked while still surprised.

“The Sword Ancestor...” Jin Ling was stunned, then she smiled, “The Sword Ancestor had six first-grade Sword Souls!”

“Six first-grade Sword Souls?” Jian Wushuang was stunned, then he marveled secretly,?“Amazing!”

He really was the ancestor of Sword Principle.

Jian Wushuang thought himself great when he found out about Double Sword Souls, but now...

“Compared with Sword Ancestor, I have a long way to go.”?Jian Wushuang smiled but he wasn’t downhearted.

After all, Sword Soul improved with his growth.

Sword Ancestor must have lived a long time to have six Sword Souls. However, Jian Wushuang had just started moving along his path.

“The Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline has been declining, but you and your father awakened Sword Soul in succession. You even awakened Double First-grade Sword Souls, which is a miracle. And, your father... he came here not long ago,” Jin Ling suddenly said.

“My father?” Jian Wushuang looked toward her.

After destroying Blood Feather Tower, he had separated with his father. After that, he had not heard any news about his father.

But, just now, he had heard something related to his father from Jin Ling.

“It was about one year ago. He came here right after he had reached Divine Transcendence. He is also highly talented and passed the second trial, though he took longer than you.”

“Even though his first Sword Soul was stolen, he managed to awaken another one. And it was also a first-grade Sword Soul,” Jin Ling said.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help smiling.

His father’s talent was no less than his.

His father ate a Reversal Red Scorching Elixir, which suppressed his potential by a large extent. Even with that, Jian Nantian still reached Divine Transcendence and awakened a first-grade Sword Soul.

“Where is he now?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I don’t know.” Jin Ling shook her head and said, “After passing the trial and getting some opportunities, he left. But he left behind a letter for you.”

Jin Ling took out the letter.

Jian Wushuang raised her eyebrows. After taking the letter, he opened it and read it.

A moment later, he finished reading.

“Father, have you left already?” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“You left Holy Emperor Palace for me to deal with, so I need to improve as soon as possible.”?Jian Wushuang smashed the letter to pieces.

“After passing each trial in the Ancestor’s Land, you will be given some opportunities!” Jin Ling looked over at Jian Wushuang, “You have passed the second trial and are now a core disciple of the Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline. Therefore, you will have more privileges and opportunities.”
