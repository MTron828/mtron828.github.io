Chapter 1596: Hunt!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In an instant, Real God Dan Ding and Real God Ming Xin appeared on the battlefield.

“Lineage of Star, stop this instant,” Real God Dan Ding’s voice contained a strange power and it reverberated in the void.

“Elder Wu Liang, what do we do?” Both Jian Wushuang and Real God Fei Yan looked.

Real God Wu Liang’s gaze was cold. He stole a glance at Real God Shi Jie, “Don’t worry about them. Continue to kill!”

Hong!

The three of them launched an attack again.

Real God Dan Ding and Real God Ming Xin’s face changed.

“It’s Soaring Heaven Land after all. Please give Soaring Heaven King Palace face,” Real God Dan Ding spoke but his voice became cold.

“Humph, the three of us already did. Otherwise, we won’t wait till the two of you leave before we took action,” Real God Wu Liang scoffed.

“It seems that the three of you really want to have a hard time with Soaring Heaven King Palace,” Real God Dan Ding’s aura soared.

“It’s Soaring Heaven King Palace that is making it difficult for Lineage Star. You knew Real God Shi Jue shared a great resentment with Lineage of Star but you kept him under your provision,” Real God Wu Liang roared.

“If so, there’s nothing for us to say. Ming Xin, let’s do this!”

Real God Dan Ding waved his sleeve and barged into the battlefield along with Real God Ming Xin next to him.

Real God Dan Ding and Real God Ming Xin were both peak Eternal Real Gods. Once the two of them got involved, the entire battle immediately took a drastic turn.

“Haha, Real God Wu Liang, I heard about you long ago but I never fought with you before. I’d like to contest with you today,” Real God Dan Ding blocked before Real God Wu Liang.

He knew for sure that Real God Wu Liang was the one with the scariest power among the three of them.

As long as he kept him busy, the remaining Real God Fei Yan and Jian Wushuang wouldn’t be able to pose as great of a threat to Real God Shi Jue.

“You wouldn’t be able to stop me if you were to fight against me head-on!” Real God Wu Liang was ferocious as he turned into a primeval beast.

On the other hand.

“Real God Ming Xin, please keep Real God Fei Yan and Jian Wushuang busy,” Real God Shi Jue roared and he had already launched his fastest speed with the intention to run away from the battlefield.

“Let me take care of them,” Real God Ming Xin gripped his two long spears in his hands. Along with the flowing divine power, the two long spears stabbed into the air simultaneously.

The two long spears weren’t aimed at anyone. But when they flew out, there was immediately a wormhole in the void above. The two long spears flew into the wormhole then appeared before Jian Wushuang and Real God Fei Yan in the very next moment.

“This?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He could tell that Real God Ming Xin’s manipulation of Power of Spacetime was very impressive. If not mistaken, his comprehension towards Spacetime Doctrine should be at the standard to pass through the third level of Doctrine Palace.

The long spears contained terrifying power. As it flew, Real God Fei Yan’s face changed. She waved and there were immediately billowing waves that blocked her. The long spear pierced through the waves but in the end, it couldn’t withstand the waves.

As for Jian Wushuang, he cast almost a hundred shadows and used the Power of Spacetime to shuttle to and fro. He dodged the long spear with ease.

“Mm?” Real God Ming Xin looked at Jian Wushuang with astonishment, “Jian Wushuang’s martial art motion is impressive. He comprehended Spacetime Doctrine too and it isn’t a low comprehension. With the existence of such a martial art motion, even if I only fight against him alone, I might not be able to stop him. Let alone if I’m fighting against two… it’s impossible.”

“Shi Jue, I can only stop Real God Fei Yan. As for Jian Wushuang, it’s your call.”

Real God Shi Jue who already escaped from the green torrents pressed by Real God Fei Yan naturally saw the scene behind him. At the same time, he saw that Jian Wushuang was already chasing after him. His pupil fixed and then he smirked coldly, “Although Jian Wushuang is impressive, he is a Universe God after all. His fighting power is limited. With him alone, even if he catches up, he can’t do anything to me.”

With such a thought, Real God Shi Jue launched his fastest speed to plunge towards the void out of the city.

Jian Wushuang followed closely behind.

In the city, Real God Wu Liang and Real God Wu Yan were fighting against Real God Dan Ding and Real God Ming Xin.

In terms of power, Real God Wu Liang was slightly stronger than Real God Dan Ding by a slight bit while Real God Ming Xin was stronger than Real God Fei Yan. However, Real God Fei Yan’s defense power was strong.

The collaborations of both, they were just evenly matched. The match would be too hard to call in a short period of time. The four of them could launch a calling act.

“Haha, you live up to your reputation, Real God Wu Liang. You are really powerful. However, the monster from Lineage of Star, Jian Wushuang, is only a Universe God after all. You want him to go after Real God Shi Jue, is it really okay?” Real God Dan Ding sneered at him.

Real God Wu Liang and Real God Fei Yan’s faces grew distressed.

The two of them had already sent a message to Jian Wushuang for him to be careful. If he couldn’t, he should give up hunting Real God Shi Jue.

But Jian Wushuang’s reply was to let him take care of it. He seemed to be very confident.

Real God Wu Liang and Real God Fei Yan had no choice about it.

…

Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were two rays of flowing light traveling at shocking speed. In an instant, the two of them were out of the city.

In the vast void, Real God Shi Jue still looked pale even though he consumed a few elixirs on the way. His injuries during the earlier besiegement couldn’t be recovered so easily and the injury would affect his fighting power.

“Jian Wushuang is really chasing after me alone? He has guts!” Real God Shi Jue stole a glance at Jian Wushuang who was chasing closely behind, “He really thought I’d be afraid of him, a Universe God?”

There was a chilly gleam twinkling in Real God Shi Jue’s eyes.

Among the three from Lineage of Star that hemmed him in, he was afraid of Real God Wu Lian the most. After all, he was an expert standing on the pearl among Eternal Real Gods long ago. He was extremely close to Chaotic Real God too. During the besiegement earlier, the reason why he had been heavily injured was because of Real God Wu Liang.

Besides Real God Wu Liang, he didn’t even bother about Real God Fei Yan who was extremely close to the level of Peak Eternal Real God, let alone Jian Wushuang. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

From his viewpoint, among the three that besieged him, Jian Wushuang was the one who posed the least threat. He could only be his match in terms of martial art motion.

“As you want to follow me, follow me then. We just left the city not long ago. You don’t have to rush things. After a while, when we are far away enough from where Real God Wu Liang was, I’ll take action to kill the most impressive genius in the history of Lineage of Star!”

“After all, I already killed two disciples of Star Palace in the past. The hatred that Lineage of Star harbored against me is never-ending. It’s nothing to kill another one!”

Real God Shi Jue had terrifying murderous intention rising in his heart.
