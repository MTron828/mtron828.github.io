Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian spent the night talking under the moonlight

It was Jian Wushuang’s most heart warming night in the recent years.

The next day, the valley was already in an uproar at first light.

The experts walked out of their rooms and hurried towards the mountain where the Heart-killing Sword had been placed.

A short while later, a large group of experts had gathered in front of the mountain.

Naturally, Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian were among them.

Besides these experts, there were two other people present that attracted everyone’s attention.

One of them was a stout man with tanned skin, his body surrounded by a thunderbolt. The other one was a thin and elegant young man with a folding fan in his hand.

Their overbearing aura shocked many experts on the spot and instantly revealed their identity as marquises.

“They are Marquis Wanlei and Marquis Nanyu.”

“Neither of them is an expert in Sword Principle. What are they doing here?”

“They obviously came here for Jian Nantian.”

The onlookers were discussing the current situation in a low voice.

With his eyes squinted, Jian Wushuang looked at the two marquises and nodded.

There were both strong and weak marquises. Most of the well-acknowledged among the 72 Marquis were in the normal Seven-cloud Realm, and some of them did not even possess a Dao Weapon.

Marquis Piaoxue and Marquis Cangyue were part of the latter.

They wanted to kill Jian Nantian, and by doing so they could gain two Dao Weapons. Many experts and marquises were here for the same reason.

The two marquises had made their way to the valley the very same night after they heard the news.

However, though they had been in the valley, for fear of annoying Su Ming, they had to wait until Jian Nantian left the valley to kill him.

“Since these two marquises rushed here the moment they heard the news, Marquis Xuefeng must have heard the news as well,”?Jian Wushuang thought while frowning.

Right then, with a group of attendants surrounding him, a white-robed man came down.

He was a handsome man with a wicked smile on his face and a compelling manner.

The experts could not help but be drawn to the man as their eyes fixated on him. Even Jian Wushuang was impressed and shot the man a glance.

“Is he Su Ming?”?Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

From the chat with his father last night, he had learned that Su Ming was the traitor of Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline and had something to do with the fall of the bloodline.

Yet, only the top experts of the Divine Land knew about it, the common people still thought of Su Ming as the Sword Ancestor’s personal disciple.

Everyone’s eyes turned towards Su Ming when he came out, everyone except for Jian Nantian.

He did not spare Su Ming a glance from the very beginning.

He stood straight, with his eyes closed, as if he was asleep and had no idea of Su Ming’s arrival.

For him, only his sword and Jian Wushuang deserved his attention.

“Your Excellency!”

“I pay my respects to Your Excellency!”

The experts saluted Su Ming one after another, and even Marquis Wanlei and Marquis Nanyu paid their respect with a bow.

“Ladies and gentlemen, don’t be so courteous.” Su Ming spoke in a soft and fascinating voice.

The experts straightened their backs.

“Wanlei, Nanyu, I didn’t expect that you would come here.” Su Ming looked toward the marquises with a smile.

“We’d love to see how powerful the Heart-killing Sword is,” said Marquis Wanlei.

“Really?” Su Ming sneered and continued, “I reckon you’re here for something else.”

Upon hearing this, Marquis Wanlei and Marquis Nanyu exchanged an embarrassed look.

“All right. I don’t care what you do when you’re outside, but you’d better behave yourselves in Sword-suppression Valley,” said Su Ming.

“Of course, we will.”

Marquis Wanlei and Marquis Nanyu nodded heavily, not daring to say one more word.

After all, they were just in the Seven-cloud Realm and at the bottom of 72 Marquis, so they had to show their respect, even to Marquis Xuefeng, let alone Su Ming, one of Nine Sovereigns.

They knew very well how powerful and terrifying Su Ming was.

Though this sovereign looked gentle and elegant for the moment, he was known as Sword Demon among the top experts in the Divine Land.

His personality became quite chilling when it was time to kill.

“A half day from now, the Heart-killing Sword will begin to wake up. Don’t miss this rare opportunity.” After saying this, Su Ming shut his mouth.

However, the crowd got into a heated discussion.

“Swordsman, Tianming Lord, look, there are secret chambers at the foot of the mountain,” said Hunjian Lord.

“Secret chambers?”

Jian Wushuang followed the lord’s line of sight and spotted the chambers.

“half a day from now, the Heart-killing Sword will begin to awaken, erupting with Sword Essence. The Essence itself is an opportunity, and the nearer we are to the sword, the better our benefit will be. Since there are a total of 100 secret chambers that are the closest to the sword, we’ll definitely benefit greatly if we can enter one of them.”

“Are there only 100 chambers?” Tianming Lord frowned and asked.

There were hundreds of experts here and 100 chambers were definitely not enough.

“Are you really thinking that every one of us will be able to occupy a chamber?” Hunjian Lord laughed and continued, “Let me tell you this, 100 is a more than enough. At the previous meetings, less than 30 people were able to make their way into the chambers.”

“Why?” Tianming Lord was confused.

“You’ll know soon.” Hunjian Lord put on a mysterious smile.
