Chapter 1886: Two Hundred Years

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Jian Wushuang stood in the void as he watched the boatman in black leave. He didn’t intend to chase after him.

He was clear that, in terms of power, the boatman in black was still above him and he had many tricks and techniques on hand. It was already great enough that he got to survive the attack. It was an extravagant hope to take down the boatman in black.

“This person, who sent him?” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

Speaking of assassination, Jian Wushuang thought of Acheron Palace and Holocaust Sect first.

However, his gut feeling told him that the boatman in black should have nothing to do with Acheron Palace and Holocaust Sect.

After all, he had experienced the power of the two dark forces before.

They either don’t attack all, or there would be definite death if they did. Just like the besiegement of Acheron Palace last time, if it wasn’t because he was lucky and he had met One-star Man, it would have been impossible for him to survive.

Then, although the boatman in black was powerful and he could pull a Great Emperor-like hit.

He couldn’t corner Jian Wushuang to a desperate situation with that.

Acheron Palace and Holocaust definitely wouldn’t only reach such level when they attacked.

As he wasn’t from the two dark forces, those who could send someone so powerful yet with no fame definitely would only be the existence of the high above.

“The Great Emperor finally couldn’t hold back and started taking action at me?” Jian Wushuang looked gloomy.

Among the Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance, there were quite a few that didn’t wish to see him grow.

Merely because there were some Great Emperors that were looking forward to his growth, they were restricting one another.

“Although there are quite a few Great Emperors that don’t wish to see me grow, currently, only Abysmal Saint Master displayed his hostility towards me. Unless the one who wanted to kill me this time is really Abysmal Saint Master?” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Of course, he wasn’t sure.

“Although, I don’t know which Great Emperor did it this time. But luckily, as he still has scruples, he couldn’t kill me personally but only could send the boatman in black earlier. There’s a what-if in every situation. I’d better be more careful. Otherwise, it might be a Great Emperor who attacks personally next time.

“Power!”

“It’s power!!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and he felt unwilling to yield.

He knew that he was eyed by some Great Emperor, he had no other ways. He could only be defensive and take the hits. He could only think of ways to resolve the danger that he was in.

It was the difference in power.

Not until until the day that he obtained the Seventh Step of Inverse Cultivation Skill and truly became an Almighty would he be able to stand side by side with the Great Emperors.

Jian Wushuang didn’t stay any longer in the void but quickly returned to Lineage of Star.

…

In the huge, luxurious estate that looked like a paradise.

In the middle of the estate, there was a river and the river water was as clear as crystal. There was a boat floating and there was a lazy man in a purple robe fishing with a bamboo pole in the boat.

The entire estate was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.

Suddenly, the boatman in black appeared at the corner of the boat. He greeted politely, “Master, I’m back.”

“How did it go?” The lazy man asked casually.

“I already used Blood Dynasty Pearl but I still failed in the end. The defensive armor of Jian Wushuang’s body is unusual,” the boatman in black said.

“Oh?” The lazy man raised his eyebrows but he didn’t mind much, “Forget it. Let Jian Wushuang live for a while longer. Oh year, you didn’t reveal anything to him, right?”

“Master, I was in disguise during the attack. Besides Master, there is no one else who knows it was me,” the boatman in black said as his appearance and aura changed at a fast speed.

The original tan-skinned, scrawny elderly in black suddenly became an extremely evil-looking lady in a purple robe.

The lady looked enchantingly beautiful. Her skill was fair and her body figure was curvy. She was a classically beautiful girl.

Even if Jian Wushuang saw this lady, he definitely wouldn’t associate her with the boatman in black.

…

Not long after the assassination of the boatman in black, Jian Wushuang returned to Lineage of Star.

He cultivated in Emperor Sword Palace for one thousand years.

In the past one thousand years, nothing had happened in Eternal Chaotic World.

Lineage of Star was rather peaceful.

Ever since the fight between Lineage of Star and Abysmal Palace, Lineage of Star had displayed their fierce power and it served as a deterrent to all forces.

Plus, the news about the Master of Star Palace’s death had yet to be confirmed. Hence, although the forces and experts had intentions in their heads, no one dared to take action against Lineage of Star at that moment.

However, the date of the closing of Ancient Mystery Land was getting closer. There were only two hundred years left!

Two hundred years were extremely short. The time wasn’t much left for Lineage of Star.

In the lofty hall.

“Hall Master Yuan, how did the expert recruitment go?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“As of now, there is a total of seventeen Almighties that have accepted our invitation. Among the Almighties, there are two Emperor Gods while the rest of the fifteen are Sir Gods. Among the fifteen Sir Gods, there is one who is on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. In addition to Emperor God Jiu Yin who accepted our invitation earlier, we now have five people with the fighting power of an Emperor God in Lineage of Star! Plus, Palace Master yourself and Jian Yi, there are two Peak Emperor Gods,” Hall Master Yuan sounded excited.

Fighting power of five Emperor Gods. Among all sects in Sanctuary Alliance, any forces had yet to achieve that.

However, Lineage of Star had achieved it. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Of course, that was because the condition that Lineage of Star had offered was too tempting. Not only did they give them Chaotic Divine Treasure, but the temptation of Secret Skill of Star Palace was also huge.

“These people in Lineage of Star, are they honest people?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Palace Master, don’t worry. First of all, these people have good reputation. Secondly, they have yet to receive a Secret Skill of Star Palace. Even though they have gotten their Chaotic Divine Treasure, they are still restricted. Unless it comes to the brink of life and death, they won’t?abandon Lineage of Star and leave,’ Hall Master Yuan said.

“That’s great,’ Jian Wushuang nodded faintly.

Although the experts had accepted Lineage of Star’s invitation, they had come merely for the benefits offered and they didn’t have any relationship with Lineage of Star, let alone a feeling of belonging. It was impossible for them to go all out for Lineage of Star. Hence, Jian Wushuang merely wanted to hang on to them through benefits.

Wait until the war exploded, even if these people didn’t risk their all for Lineage of Star, they could at least be useful then. They could definitely increase the overall fighting power of Lineage of Star.
