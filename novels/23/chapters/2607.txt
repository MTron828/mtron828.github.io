Chapter 2608: Auctioning The Stately Painting

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“We have researched it since obtaining this treasure and had uncovered a message from it. The message is...

“The Stately Painting. The endless mountains and streams, dividing the world into nine continents. The mountains and rivers as the palms and the nine continents as the seal which created the world!”

The Golden Chief paused on purpose when he reached that point of his speech.

As expected, it caused quite a stir in the auction with countless experts standing up in an uproar.

It was a simple message, however... It was very domineering!

“Treasure, an absolute rare treasure.” Many had their eyes burning with desire.

“Too bad. Although the Star Picking Pavilion managed to extract the message from the treasure, recognize its uniqueness, and knowing that it’s indeed an extraordinary treasure, we could not make it recognize us as its master despite the various methods we took. However, that doesn’t prove anything as if it meets the right person, perhaps the treasure might recognize him as its master,” said the Golden Chief.

The experts all nodded.

There were indeed certain extraordinary treasures that would choose its own master.

It only proved that the treasure did not look too highly upon him if that person could not make it recognize him as its master. However, if that person was fated for this treasure—it would naturally identify him as its master upon meeting him.

None of the experts in the Star Picking Pavilion could make the Stately Painting recognize a master. It only proved that the treasure had very high standards and naturally made its price shockingly high.

A great number of experts in the auction including the second and third-floor experts began to feel excited about it.

“Let’s begin the bidding for the first star of the auction, the Stately Painting. The starting price is a hundred million Primordial Stones!!” The Golden Chief projected his voice.

As soon as the starting price was announced, a collective exclamation of shock resonated in the entire auction.

The starting price itself was already 100,000,000 Primordial Stones and that was a first for the auction!

The starting price had shattered most people’s desire toward the Stately Painting. Even though there were numerous experts in the auction, those who immediately could present 100,000,000 Primordial Stones were far and few.

Moreover, the 100,000,000 Primordial Stones were only the starting price.

Jian Wushuang’s face turned slightly gloomy when he heard the starting price. However, he immediately sat down slowly as though he had already calmed down.

In his eyes though, a sharp light was violently piercing out.

“There’s absolutely no way I will be able to obtain it through the auction since the starting price is already a hundred million. If that’s the case... I’ll have to resort to other methods,” mumbled Jian Wushuang to himself.

Although 100,000,000 Primordial Stones was an exorbitant starting price, there were quite a few people in the third floor’s rooms who could afford it.

Those people had started bidding.

“One hundred fifty million Primordial Stones.”

A young master dressed in an expensive purple long robe sat casually in an individual room while holding a paper fan. Next to him was a sitting figure that projected waves of overpowering energy.

The young master wore a slight smile before he murmured, “The Stately Painting is truly extraordinary and worthy of me taking action. Even if the treasure doesn’t recognize anyone as its master after bringing it back to Life and Death Tower, we could still give it away as a present and not lose much. However, if we are lucky to absorb the treasure, we will gain a lot.”

...

“Two hundred million!”

A statue-like dark figure standing in an individual room. The figure was clad in black robes as cold energy seeped out from him as he stared at the Stately Painting on the display stage with a strange light in his eyes. A sense of greed could be seen deep inside his pupils.

...

“Three hundred million Primordial Stones!”

A bald and plump teenager holding a fruit made his bid.

A Heaven Ultimate God old man frowned next to him and said, “Master Uncle, we didn’t bring many Primordial Stones this time. Only a rough total of one hundred fifty million and we’re only at the first star of the auction. Although the Stately Painting is truly extraordinary, purchasing it comes with risks. If we spend too much to buy this item, we’ll only be able to watch others bid for the next two stars of the auction.”

“I know that.” The bald teenager continued munching on his fruit and smiled demonically before saying, “It’s exactly because we didn’t bring a lot of Primordial Stones that I purposely raise the bidding price so that the Dongfang Clan and Young Palace Master of Nanwu Palace will competitively offering even higher bids to fight for the Stately Painting. It will then put us in advantage when we bid for the next two treasures.”

The bald young man was not too interested in the Stately Painting but still kept bidding a higher price.

He immediately raised the bid to 500,000,000 when the Young Palace Master of Nanwu Palace made an offer of 400,000,000 Primordial Stones.

The price continued and very quickly shot to a sky-high price under the competition between these high rollers.

At that moment, in an unremarkable individual room on the third floor of the auction house...

An expert was in that room, but if anyone were observant enough, they would discover that he did not bid once to fight for even a single treasure since the auction started.

Even after the Stately Painting appeared, the man in that individual room did not show the slightest bit of interest.

In the room was a simple-looking white-haired old man clad in grey.

The white-haired old man with murky eyes was sitting still like a meditating old monk. Nobody could tell if his eyes were opened or closed.

Standing before him were three people.

Among them was the purple-robed man—the Supervisor of the Star Picking Pavilion’s Narcissus Territory branch. The other two were that branch’s Golden Chiefs.

The bald man was one of the two Golden Chiefs who had a relationship with San Shouwang and showed a certain interest in Jian Wushuang.

The Golden Chiefs of Star Picking Pavilion enjoyed a high status in the auction house since there were only three Golden Chiefs at the Star Picking Pavilion’s Narcissus Territory branch.

The Supervisor held the highest authority at the branch of course that even the Golden Chiefs had to answer to him. His ability was also shockingly powerful as he was at the very limits of High-level Heaven Ultimate God with only a step away from reaching Peak Heaven Ultimate God.

However, the Supervisor and his two Golden Chiefs stood respectfully before the white-haired old man with their heads bowed extremely low without showing any defiance at that moment.
