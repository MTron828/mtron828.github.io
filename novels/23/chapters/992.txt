Chapter 993: Tribal Heterogeneity

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang turned and left confidently, leaving the irate warriors of the Bone Devil Clan behind him whose lips twitched with annoyance and anger.

Trying his best to silence his rage, Elder Scorpion’s face turned pale at the hearing of Jian Wushuang’s words. Within himself, he roared “Who would have known that a Rank Two Dao Master like you would conceal his aura? I would never have dared to infuriate you if only you had shown your aura in the beginning!”

Nevertheless, Elder Scorpion’s was true: none of them, including the purple-haired man, would dare brazenly attack him if Jian Wushuang had earlier revealed his powers as a Dao Master. They would first inquire his purpose of being there before deciding if aggression was called for.

Appearing suddenly in the vicinity with only the strength of a warrior of the Eternal Realm, the warriors of the Bone Devil Clan had foolishly mistaken him as one of the Heavenly Ape Clan.

Never would they expect that a mere warrior of the Eternal Realm was, in truth, a powerful master of the skill of combat in disguise.

Leaving the site of the decimation of the Heavenly Ape Clan, Jian Wushuang sped on for some time until he reached the top of a mountain ridge.

The middle-aged man stopped before Jian Wushuang, with his child in his arms.

He put the boy down and bowed to Jian Wushuang respectfully. “I am Yuan Gang of the Heavenly Ape Clan. Thank you so much for saving our lives.”

“Hao’er, quickly, bow to the young master and thank him for his kindness.” The man urged his son.

“Thank you so much, Sir.” The kid fell to his knees and bowed deeply to Jian Wushuang.

“Up you come.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand. Yuan Gang and his son felt a strange force, pouring like a strong wind that lifted them to their feet.

“Without your help, Hao’er and I could never hope to have escaped. We will remember your kindness and repay you someday.” Yuan Gang continued.

Jian Wushuang only shrugged indifferently; showing no heed at all.

“Alas… Even though we’ve escaped, the Heavenly Ape Clan is finished…” Yuan Gang’s eyes turned wet red and his son clenched his fists with anger.

Jian Wushuang’s placid face showed no emotion. It was only by a stroke of coincidence that he had just arrived in the Samsara Continent and had saved Yuan Gang and his son.

It was a truth that both Yuan Gang and his son were aware of.

“The Heavenly Ape Clan?”?Jian Wushuang murmured absent-mindedly.

“Unless I am mistaken, the Heavenly Ape Clan would likely be the descendants of a human and the Heavenly Ape, an Exotic Beast of the Eternal Chaotic World. The two before you bear the blood of the Heavenly Ape. But the strength of their bloodline is all but spent; so weak that they can hardly use their Bloodline Power against foes in battle.” The Gu King’s voice rang in Jian Wushuang’s head.

“Is that so?”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself, not saying a word.

Despite bearing the bloodline of the Ancient Gods, Jian Wushuang himself could hardly use the Bloodline Powers of the bodily fluids that flowed through his veins for he lacked the ritualistic baptism conducted upon him by the Ancient God Clan. The rituals are the prerequisite condition for him tap into the powers bestowed by his blood to become a true Ancient God and enjoy great enhancements in his strength.

The Heavenly Ape Clan bore a similarly unique bloodline of their own, yet they have not been able to call upon the powers of their own bloodline.

“I have a few questions that require honest answers, Yuan Gang,” said Jian Wushuang.

“You have shown us kindness and grace in dire times of need, Sir. I’ll answer to the best of my knowledge.” Yuan Gang quickly replied.

“Very well. It is just a few simple questions.” Jian Wushuang said as he began.

Jian Wushuang inquired about some common knowledge about life in the Samsara Continent; knowledge that any native to the land could easily provide. Before long, Jian Wushuang had all the answers he required.

“There are so many tribes and clans in the Samsara Continent?” Jian Wushuang thought quietly even though he was shocked.

Based on Yuan Gang’s accounts, there were too many tribes and clans in the Samsara Continent.

So many, that conflict and strife constantly plagued the tribal heterogeneity in pursuit of wealth and resources. As time passes, there began a form of hierarchical caste system amongst the multitudes of tribes and clans.

There were different tiers of castes that divided the tribes and clans of the Samsara Continent – the lesser tribes, the medium-leveled tribes, the stronger tribes and the principal tribes which occupied the top class of the caste hierarchy.

The lesser tribes – which constituted the bulk of the population spread across the entire continent – possessed the weakest strength; making them the easiest tribes to be annihilated and destroyed. The Heavenly Ape Clan was one of them. But from this day onwards, the Clan would be lost forever from the face of the Samsara Continent.

Much stronger than the lesser tribes, the medium populations numbered many times lesser than the weaker tribes. Survival was hardly a difficulty as long as they remain prudent and keep themselves from crossing the paths of the greater tribes and principal tribes of the land.

The Bone Devil Clan was one of these medium populations.

Now, in the dale before Jian Wushuang, there were more than ten tribes and clans in the vicinity. Only three of the ten were tribes of the medium population.

The stronger tribes would number even lesser still.

As existences that lorded over the steppes and swards of the Samsara Continent, the principal tribes of the land reigned with absolute supremacy.

Most of the natives of the Samsara Continent bore the bloodlines of ancient Exotic Beasts. Hence even from birth, most of them were inherently stronger than common humans. This allowed them greater chances to sire offsprings who could be great warriors in the future. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Yuan Gang had also revealed that most lesser tribes are led by chieftains most likely Dao Masters themselves.

The medium populations would commonly have more than ten Dao Masters on retainer and a Dao Master of at least Rank Two as chieftains.

The stronger and principal tribes would most naturally boast of greater strengths than the rest.

“Even the multitudes of lesser tribes of the Samsara Continent have Dao Masters as leaders. With the countless heterogeneity in the number of tribes here, there must surely be numerous Dao Masters here.”?Jian Wushuang thought.

This would reinforce the belief that the Samsara Continent was indeed very much stronger than that of the Void Continent.

The Void Continent has, at most, a handful of Dao Masters clustered together in a habituated area. Yet it was most certainly that the Samsara Continent has more than double the number of Dao Masters within an area, lending credence that the forces of the Samsara Continent would most surely outstrip the Void Continent by number and strength.

“A mere Samsara Continent is able to impress you that much, Jian Wushuang? I stand to wonder how will you react when you one day venture into the deeps of the vast Eternal Chaotic World?” The Gu King’s pestering voice rang suddenly. “These are but merely a few Dao Masters. Warriors of such level of strength come in tremendous supply in the Eternal Chaotic World that they are viewed as nothing but mere mediocrity.”

This made Jian Wushuang become speechless.

Indeed, at present, he was just a person of a limited insight into the greatness of the universe.

“A few more questions, Yuan Gang. How long have you lived here? Do you know of the Samsara Temple?” asked Jian Wushuang again.

“The Samsara Temple?” Yuan Gang’s eyes widened. “Of course I do. They are the most supreme sovereign to govern this lands; not even the principal tribes dare compare themselves with them.”
