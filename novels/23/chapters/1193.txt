Chapter 1194: Reincarnation of the Extinguished Consciousness

“Interesting!”

The Monarch of Jin Kingdom appeared overjoyed even as he was trapped in the storm of sword shadows. He thrust his pitch-black lance in a seemingly casual manner but happened to block Jian Wushuang’s sword at just the right timing. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“My Spell of Disturbance pushes the Sword Principles of the world to its pinnacle. Each sword strike affects time and space at a frighteningly high speed yet he’s able to block each one with such ease?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Just show me all that you have,” the Monarch of Jin Kingdom said with a laugh.

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened. His figure began to sway and a doppelganger appeared next to him.

“Oh, a doppelganger?” the Monarch of Jin Kingdom lifted an eyebrow.

“Kill!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were icy-cold as he and his doppelganger brandished their swords side by side. Then, at a lightning speed, they thrust their swords together.

Jian Wushuang’s doppelganger possessed the exact same Sword Principles and swordsmanship as him. It could also unleash the Stroke of Dawn. The only difference was that it was not dressed in the Blood-killing Plate Armor and was thus slightly weaker than Jian Wushuang. However, with this move as a Supreme Secret level, it still possessed the battle strength of a peak Universe Master.

“Master of Samsara Temple! Let’s fight together!”

Jian Wushuang opened his mouth to emit a whistle as he and his doppelganger struck at the same time.

“Alright!”

The Master of Samsara Temple, who had stabilized his injuries, immediately nodded.

His body rapidly enlarged and turned into a large vicious beast that was covered in armor. He then charged toward the Monarch of Jin Kingdom and arrived in front of the latter.

The Master of Void Temple, Emperor of Tang, Emperor of the Rising Sun Sword, and Red Lotus could only watch as the Master of Samsara Temple joined Jian Wushuang. Red Lotus could, at most, impose slight suppression on the Monarch of Jin Kingdom with his Nine Serenities Domain.

There was nothing concrete that they could do against such a powerful enemy like the Monarch of Jin Kingdom. Considering their strength, any show of carelessness on the battlefield will just give the Monarch an opportunity to kill them.

The war between the Green Fire Palace and the Jin Kingdom was imminent and any difference in realm and battle strength was vital in determining the outcome of the war. They would not hastily try and take down the Monarch of Jin Kingdom unless it was absolutely necessary.

With Jian Wushuang, his doppelganger, and the Master of Samsara Temple working together, coupled with Red Lotus’ Nine Serenities Domain aiding their fight, it was enough to take down the manifestation of the Monarch of Jin Kingdom’s consciousness.

“Kill!” “Die!”

The three of them unleashed their greatest battle potential.

In particular, Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship was sharp and precise. In terms of battle strength, he was not weaker than the Monarch of Jin Kingdom’s consciousness in the slightest.

Under successive attacks from all three of them, the Monarch of Jin Kingdom immediately fell to a state of disadvantage.

Not long after…

“Humph!”

The Master of Samsara Temple harrumphed coldly as he took advantage of the gap when the Monarch of Jin Kingdom was resisting Jian Wushuang’s sword. With his large body, he slammed into the Monarch with the force of a mountain. The Puppet Fighter that housed the Monarch’s consciousness immediately became damaged and part of his arm shattered from the force of the collision.

The eyes of Jian Wushuang and the Master of Samsara Temple brightened up when they saw this scene.

“Sure enough.”

Jian Wushuang smirked. “This soul-luring trick draws only the Monarch’s consciousness but its body is still that of a Puppet Fighter of the level of a Universe Master with ordinary defensive capabilities. It doesn’t have any self-protection methods either and any ordinary Universe Master would be able to cause such damage if their attack lands on the Puppet Fighter’s body. Let alone the Master of Samsara Temple’s brutal attack.”

“Moreover, the Monarch couldn’t restore the damaged parts of the Puppet Fighter…”

The Monarch of Jin Kingdom saw a sharp decline in his battle strength after the Master of Samsara Temple slammed into him. He was subsequently put under even stronger suppression.

The Puppet Fighter soon reached the fringe of complete destruction.

The Monarch of Jin Kingdom’s consciousness remained in the Puppet Fighter but he could also detect that his vessel had reached its limit. Even so, he showed no anger. His face remained as cold as ever.

“Jian Wushuang, I have remembered you.”

“It won’t be long before my true body arrives. I want to see if how your Green Fire Palace resist me then!”

“Don’t think that you’ll have the opportunity to live just because you’ve ruined our foundation here. It’s impossible!”

“I’ve made preparations this time. It doesn’t matter what tricks you people have up your sleeves, everything will end up being destroyed!”

“Wait for your deaths!”

The Monarch of Jin Kingdom’s voice reverberated in the air like the booming of thunder. The sound did not dissipate for a long time.

However, the Puppet Fighter had thoroughly frittered away and his consciousness also disappeared.

Jian Wushuang and the Master of Samsara Temple hovered in the Void as they stared at the “Puppet Fighter” slowly falling to the ground. Their expressions were as grave as ever.

“If his consciousness alone is this difficult to handle, just how terrifying would the real thing be?” Jian Wushuang tightly clasped his hands, his eyes clouded over.

The Monarch of Jin Kingdom was unable to unleash many of his skills and tricks, including his strength, due to the limitations of his vessel. Even so, he was only defeated when Jian Wushuang used his doppelganger and with the help of the Master of Samsara Temple.

The Monarch himself ought to be tenfold, perhaps even hundredfold, stronger.

What could the Green Fire Palace do to resist the Monarch of Jin Kingdom when he descends on this battlefield?

“Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!”

The Master of the Void Temple, Emperor of Tang, Emperor of the Rising Sun Sword, and Red Lotus flew over to them.

“Jian Wushuang.”

The four Palace Masters, including the Master of Samsara Temple, looked at him gratefully.

This time, they had come here with the intention of destroying the former capital of the Jin Kingdom as well as the kingdom’s foundation in this battlefield.

Yet they did not expect that the kingdom would once again use the soul-luring skill and draw the consciousness of the Monarch of Jin Kingdom here.

Were it not for Jian Wushuang making a prompt move, the Monarch’s consciousness could very well slaughter them all. The five of them might not be able to survive this.

Jian Wushuang’s strength had also stunned them.

The top expert of the Green Fire Palace was previously the Master of Samsara Temple.

However, after this battle, the position belonged to Jian Wushuang.

The only problem was that no one had the mood to bring this up under such circumstances.

After all, this was a problem that determined the survival of the entire Green Fire Palace, and even the Green Fire World.

“Everyone, what happened to the other Jin Kingdom experts?” Jian Wushuang asked.

While Jian Wushuang and the Master of Samsara Temple were working together to exterminate the Monarch of Jin Kingdom’s consciousness, the other three worked to complement Red Lotus’ Nine Serenities Domain and slaughter all the Jin Kingdom experts.

“Few of the Jin Kingdom could escape thanks to Red Lotus’ Nine Serenities Domain. Most of the Holy Masters were killed, with only a few lucky ones fleeing. The Universe Masters are all dead, except for Red Snow King!” the Master of Void Temple answered.
