Chapter 2222 Xie Yu

“Sword Emperor?” The Emperor God Bai Xing stared at the young man in front of him, full of fear.He was the leader of the Real Martial Arts Divine Church – he knew how terrifying Sword Emperor was.

The Sword Emperor was the recognised leader of the Eternal Chaotic World, no one could surpass him.

But he also knew that Jian Wushuang had slaughtered his way to the top.

His fame was built on the blood of others.

Notorious.

He had not expected the Sword Emperor to arrive personally, naturally, he was shocked.

The only person that did not fear Jian Wushuang was that middle-aged man.

“You are that Sword Emperor?” the middle-aged man looked at Jian Wushuang lazily. “I hear you’re the strongest cultivator in this Era, next to Emperor Bai. But you don’t seem like much.” He did not take Jian Wushuang to heart at all.

That was normal.

He was from the Ancient Era. For experts from that era, the highest experts of the new era were only Peak Chaotic Realm, nothing in comparison to their era.

After hearing that, Emperor God Bai Xing calmed down. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“So what if you’re the Sword Emperor? How could you compete against our Ancient Era lords?” Emperor God Bai Xing thought to himself.

Jian Wushuang glanced at the middle-aged man, “From the Ancient Era?”

Jian Wushuang had long ago guessed the latter’s identity.

In that era, besides Emperor Bai no one could have doubted him.

If the Real Martial Arts Divine Church provoked Lineage of Stars because they had the backing of this middle-aged man, then he must have been from the Ancient Era to give the Church such a confidence boost.

“Emperor God Bai Xing, your backing is only this?” Jian Wushuang swept at him.

“Hngh, Sword Emperor, you are scary but only in this era. With Lord Xie Yu from the Ancient Era, you can forget about escaping,” Emperor God Bai Xing said.

Xie Yu was the middle-aged man’s name.

“Is it?” Jian Wushuang’s lips purled.

“Tsk tsk, my second brother had instructed me not to clash with experts from this era, but you came to my doorstep yourself, you can’t blame me,” Xie Yu was smiling deviously, now with a red dagger in his hand.

The crimson dagger exuded a cold glaze under the sun that made one shiver.

“It would be interesting if I killed you and made you my Blood Servant,” Xie Yu smiled and made his move.

Xiu!

A red shadow zoom passed in the Void.

No one could fix their gaze on Xie Yu.

“So fast!”

The cultivators were all astonished.

“Careful, Master,” even He Xiu warned him.

He too felt that Xie Yu was too fast.

But Jian Wushuang stood there, not moving a single muscle.

Wong!

A crimson light tore through the Void and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang without a trace.

The crimson figure was going straight for Jian Wushuang’s throat.

Xie Yu had a devious smile on him. “Die, ant.”

The dagger was getting closer to his throat.

The surrounding crowd held their breaths.

As the crimson light was about to pierce Jian Wushuang’s throat, a large hand grabbed it.

Pap!

The hand exuded surging Divine Power and stopped the crimson dagger with his own bare hands.

In the Void, Jian Wushuang remained standing, Xie Yu about a metre away from him. His crimson dagger was being held tightly by Jian Wushuang, like a large plier. No matter what Xie Yu did, the dagger would not move forward.

“How is that possible?”

Xie Yu’s eyes glared in astonishment.

The dagger was a formidable Chaos Divine Treasure, and he had given everything he had in that blow, but Jian Wushuang had caught it with his bare hands?

He was an Ancient Era expert. Even though he was restricted by the Rules of Heaven and Earth, he had so many secret skills experts of the current era could only dream of. He was confident no cultivator of the current era could be his opponent.

His two elder brothers had their reservations towards Emperor Bai, but he had always dismissed those fears.

But now... it was beyond what he had expected.

“How could he actually catch my dagger?”

“How is that possible?” Xie Yu mumbled.

As he was in such shock, Jian Wushuang in front of him was staring coldly at him, his gaze full of ridicule and disdain.

“Expert from the Ancient Era? I wondered how strong could you be, but in the end, you’re nothing more than an ordinary Third Stage Great Emperor,” Jian Wushuang chuckled.

As Xie Yu made his move, Jian Wushuang felt it. Nothing more than an ordinary Third Stage Great Emperor.

For comparison, his abilities were alike to Demon King Chen Yu.

That level of power would have posed a threat towards him, if they were fighting 20,000 years ago, before the war.

But Jian Wushuang could not care anymore.

He caught Xie Yu’s blow with his Divine Power alone.

“If your abilities are only as such, you will not leave this place today,” Jian Wushuang’s voice was indifferent.

He placed his strength into his right fist, returning a terrifying blow as he knocked Xie Yu’s dagger away.

That fist encompassed Jian Wushuang’s Divine Power from the ultimate phase of the Seventh Step Inverse Cultivation, the Bloodline Power from the Ancient God Clan, and the improved Divine Power from the Immemorial Celestial Body’s second scroll. All of that combined was heading on its way towards Xie Yu.
