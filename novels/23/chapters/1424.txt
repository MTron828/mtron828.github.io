Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Phew!”

Jian Wushuang let out a breath as he walked out of the Real God Hall.

“Jian Wushuang, how did it go?” The white-haired elderly outside Real God Hall casually asked.

“Not bad,” Jian Wushuang smiled as he replied.

In actual fact, his visit to Real God Hall was better than not bad. With the aid Real God Hall, he had mastered a slight bit of Power of Reincarnation and become a beginner of Reincarnation Doctrine. What he achieved was definitely something countless Real Gods would be jealous of.

Then, Jian Wushuang walked towards Scripture Depository.

In Scripture Depository.

“Elderly,” Jian Wushuang looked at the deacon elderly who was guarding in Scripture Depository.

“Jian Wushuang?” The deacon elderly took a glance at Jian Wushuang, “If I’m not mistaken, you have yet to pass the third floor of Star Tower.”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded, “However, I have passed Illusionary Mind Sea’s nineteenth floor. Hall Master Yuan said that I am qualified to cultivate the second secret skill.”

“I see,” the deacon elderly understood and immediately pointed at the four secret rooms behind him.

“These four secret rooms, each room has a secret skill. You already cultivated the secret skill of Star Palace, so you can skip the first room on the left. Out of the remaining three secret rooms, you can choose whichever one you like.”

Jian Wushuang immediately walked before the three secret rooms.

There were descriptions about the secret skill in the secret room at the entrance of each door.

The second secret room was Supreme Heaven that Ling Feibai cultivated.

Supreme Heaven transformed one into demonic God and one’s power would increase tremendously in a short period of time.

The secret skill was of a high level. However, similarly, the cultivation threshold was terrifyingly high. Plus, Supreme Heaven was actually using an extremely unique Power of bloodline. He himself was already a cultivator who possessed Power of bloodline. Hence, he was destined to be unable to cultivate it.

“Supreme Heaven, although it is extremely fierce, I already possess Ancient God blood. That means I have the prerequisites to cultivate it.

Jian Wushuang sighed.

Back when Ling Fengbai performed Supreme Heaven at the crucial moment, he had been envious of the terrifying power that he showed.

Previously, he had made a decision. If he were to also have a chance to cultivate the secret skill… However, the opportunity was before him but he couldn’t cultivate it.

Jian Wushuang shook his head and walked towards the third secret room.

In the third secret room was an extremely powerful secret skill of defense. It was called Xuan Mie Golden Body.

“Secret skill of defense?” Jian Wushuang was intrigued.

His divine body was originally far stronger than cultivators of the same level and once cultivated secret skill of defense. However, it was Golden Image Secret Skill from Green Fire World.

Although the Golden Image Secret Skill was quite decent and had provided great assistance to Jian Wushuang previously, Jian Wushuang grew more powerful and the Golden Image Secret Skill barely met his standards. Plus, the Xuan Mie Golden Body that was before him, as one of the four secret skills in Lineage of Star, was definitely one of the top secret skills of defense.

To Jian Wushuang, such a secret skill of defense was very useful.

“Jian Wushuang, when you wander in Eternal Chaotic World and want to gain a foothold in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries and gradually come to prominence, the most important thing to do is to save your own life. As long as you’re alive, everything is possible. The defense power is naturally crucial.”

“I have heard of Xuan Mie Golden Body before. It is really a powerful secret skill of defense. The secret skill is such that a Universe God in the Third Heaven is barely qualified to cultivate this secret skill. Plus, once it’s refined, even if one is only a beginner, his divine body of Universe God in the Third Heaven would be enhanced tremendously. He could even be compared favorably to a Real God!” King of Venomous Worms said.

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

As long as a Universe God in the Third Heaven became a beginner in Xuan Mid Golden Body, his divine body could be compared favorably with a Real God’s.

So impressive. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“It seems that Xuan Mie Golden Body is really a great choice for me. However, there’s no rush. I shall see what the last secret skill is before I make a decision,” Jian Wushuang smiled and then came to the fourth secret room, which was also the last secret room.

Jian Wushuang’s fixed his gaze on the description of the last secret skill before the fourth secret room.

The last secret skill, it was called… Secret Skill of Dragon Blood!

“What?” Jian Wushuang was shocked when he saw the name itself.

Then, he continued to read the simple introduction about the secret skill. Suddenly, Jian Wushuang’s gaze became strange.

The last secret skill among the four secret skill in Lineage of Star was the secret skill of Dragon Blood which he had cultivated long ago!

Exactly the same!

The secret skill of Dragon Blood was passed on to him by his Master Xuan Yi, in order to protect his life during crucial times.

The secret skill had saved him countless times.

He also knew that the secret skill was extraordinary. Previously, merely by igniting his Soul Power, his speed would increase by a hundred folds under the eruption of power.

Then, he became Universe God and possessed divine power. Once his divine power ignited, his speed would be even faster, even more furious!”

But after he became a Universe God, there was never such a life and death situation. Hence, he had yet to perform the technique with his all in Eternal Chaotic World.

But Jian Wushuang never thought that the secret skill of Dragon Blood that his master taught him would be one of the four secret skills of Lineage of Star!

“The four secret skills in Lineage of Star are commonly entrusted to the person’s memory directly and the person wouldn’t be able to pass it on to someone else. In other words, the four secret skills should be leaked. However, your mysterious master possesses this secret skill and passed it on to you. Hehe, so interesting,” King of Venomous Worms laughed.

Jian Wushuang had a strange look on his face.

He didn’t know how his master got the secret skill of Dragon Blood. However, the techniques that he performed were unfathomable. He could never figure him out.

“I never thought that I had actually already cultivated two of the secret skills in Lineage of Star,” Jian Wushuang blinked.

The secret skill of Star Palace and the secret skill of Dragon Blood were both secret skills in Lineage of Star. However, as the secret skill of Star Palace possessed the Power of Star, the higher-ups in Lineage of Star could tell that he had cultivated it before. However, no one could tell that he could do the secret skill of Dragon Blood.

Even experts like Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao, or even founder of Lineage of Star, if Jian Wushuang didn’t proactively perform it, they wouldn’t know that Jian Wushuang had cultivated the secret skill long ago.

Hence, he was given the chance to visit Scripture Depository to choose the second secret skill.

In actual fact, he should be choosing the third secret skill.

“Whatever, the secret skill of Dragon Blood was passed on to me by my master, I didn’t get it from Lineage of Star,” Jian Wushuang shrugged and went into the third secret room.

Of the four secret skills, there were two that he had already cultivated and there was one that he couldn’t cultivate. Hence, he was only left with one choice.

The secret skill was Xuan Mie Golden Body!
