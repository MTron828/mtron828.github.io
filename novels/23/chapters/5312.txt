Chapter 5311: Reverse Time and Space

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Regarding the mysteries on Grave God Mountain, he wasn’t interested, but there was one legend among them that he had been trying to verify.

That was the reversal of time, the resurrection of those who had already fallen.

Swish!

With a single step, Nie Yuan, the one-armed man, walked directly towards Jian Wushuang.

The old man with goat horns immediately sensed a threatening intent and, as the unfamiliar Emperor rushed towards Jian Wushuang, his aura surged, blocking the intruder.

Boom!

Nie Yuan’s aura was somewhat chaotic and anxious, lacking murderous intent. That’s why the old man with goat horns didn’t kill him on the spot but instead punished him slightly, directly suppressing him to his knees.

“A tier 4 Emperor disguised as a tier 3!” The old man with goat horns clenched his fist in the void, forcing Nie Yuan to kneel.

Jian Wushuang remained calm, slowly rising.

He was a bit confused; did he know this one-armed man?

They only had a brief encounter, so why did he suddenly rush towards him?

Was it because of Grave God Mountain?

Elder Jiu Jian stood on the side, looking somewhat embarrassed.

His reaction wasn’t as quick as the old man with goat horns. Although both were peak Emperors, there was still a slight gap.

However, he never expected someone here would dare to be so bold as to disturb the distinguished guests of Shangqing Palace.

“Nie Yuan, you have quite the audacity! Disturbing the distinguished guests of Shangqing Palace, you better apologize immediately!” Although Elder Jiu

Jian’s tone was cold, he made it clear that an apology could resolve the matter.

Speaking of which, he was Nie Yuan’s martial uncle. Initially, he was the top figure of their generation, and Nie Yuan succeeded him later. At that time, he was so delighted to have an outstanding junior, believing that the future of Shangqing Palace would become even more powerful.

But what he didn’t expect was that such a dazzling genius, in the end, severed ties with Shangqing Palace because of a demoness and married into the Bailuo Sect. a small sect that not even a tier 6 Emoeror could match.

Not only did it bring shame to Shangqing Palace, but it also wasted such a promising sword cultivator.

“l…” Nie Yuan’s eye sockets sank, and he looked desolate.

Once, he stood above all with his sword, never bowing his head. But at this moment, he was willing to bow, only for the woman in his heart.

Jian Wushuang knew the other party meant no harm, so he pressed down his hand and spoke, “Senior Yang, forget it. I can see that this fellow cultivator has no ill intentions.’

“Don’t forget to thank Fellow Daoist Wushuang!” Elder Jiu Jian said coldly.

“Thank you, Fellow Daoist. I was a bit impulsive just now.”

“No problem.”

Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

In his opinion, this was not a big deal, and he was a bit startled by Elder Yangs reaction.

From his perspective, there was really no need for such a commotion.

Little did he know that Zhen Ling had explicitly instructed that he must be sent intact to the Original Realm. Moreover, Wu Zuo had entrusted him to Elder Yang for care, and if anything went wrong, Elder Yang would be held responsible.

While Elder Yang, as a senior figure, could withstand Wu Zuo’s anger, he had no face at all in front of Zhen Ling.

“Humph, next time, it won’t be so easy to talk!” Elder Yang put away his palm, and his aura converged.

Nie Yuan wiped away the bloodstains from the corner of his mouth and stood up.

“This fellow Daoist, may I ask you a question?” After standing up, Nie Yuan unexpectedly asked such an absurd question.

This made everyone else gasp in surprise.

Just now, they probably didn’t kill him because of Shangqing Palace. Even if he was expelled from Shangqing Palace, no matter how you looked at it, he was still a member of Shangqing Palace, the leader of the previous generation. Killing him in public, just for a clash, was indeed unreasonable.

However, it was a bit exaggerated now. He dared to take advantage and ask such a question.

Before Jian Wushuang and the old man with goat horns could answer, Elder

Jiu Jian was furious, shouting, “Arrogant!”

The gaze of the old man with goat horns also turned cold, and for a moment, the situation became tense.

Jian Wushuang, standing in the middle, didn’t know how to respond for a moment!

He didn’t know what Nie Yuan wanted to ask, and even if he asked, he might not know the answer.

“Daoist Wushuang, I apologize for this, but you can rest assured. I will personally drive this person away!” Elder Jiu Jian took a step forward, ready to take action.

However, Jian Wushuang raised his hand to stop him and calmly said, “No need!”

“This Fellow Daoist, just go ahead and ask whatever you want!”

Nie Yuan was overjoyed and quickly asked, “On the Grave God Mountain, is it really possible to reverse time and space and resurrect the dead?”

“Umm!”

Before Jian Wushuang could answer, the old man with goat horns beside him spoke first, ‘Yes, but you need to have the strength to go up!’

“Yes!” Jian Wushuang echoed.

To be honest, he didn’t know, but since the old man with the goat horns spoke, he followed suit.

Reversing time and space!

It seems to be for the resurrection of a fellow cultivator.

Devotion!

After understanding the other’s intentions, Jian Wushuang felt a certain admiration.

When Nie Yuan heard that he wanted answers, his entire demeanor changed. The previously despondent aura faded, replaced by a completely new momentum erupting from him.

Tier 4 Emperor!

At this moment, the others finally reacted.

Nie Yuan had already reached tier 4, and at this moment, he directly exposed the aura of the peak of tier 4.

“Senior Nie!” The young girl sitting in the back row, looking at her senior who had always been melancholic, now radiating a renewed vigor, felt genuinely happy for him.

After taking his seat again, Elder Jiu Jian continued discussing the past of Flowing Province with Jian Wushuang, and Jian Wushuang found it quite interesting.

However, secretly, he communicated with the old man with the goat horns.

“Senior, is it true that time and space can be reversed?” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Why, do you also have a fellow cultivator to resurrect?”

Jian Wushuang smiled awkwardly and then said, “No, no, I’m just curious about reversing time and space. As far as I know, the space source is common, it’s the origin source practiced by Emperor, but what about the time origin source? Why have I never seen relevant records!”

“You kid know quite a bit. The space origin source is related to the Emperor’s realm. Once mastered, it enters another realm, and in that realm, one cultivates the time origin source! With your current strength, there’s no need to know about the time origin source. Wait until you reach the tier 6 Emperor before asking!’

The old man with the goat horns smiled slightly; in fact, he didn’t know much about the space origin source, let alone time.

That was something the Divine Masters were concerned with.

However, Jian Wushuang was not satisfied and continued to ask, “Senior, if it’s true that time can be reversed on Grave God Mountain, why did you tell Nie Yuan? Could it be because of some resonance!”

After saying this, he looked at the old man with the goat horns with a slightly strange expression.

“Hmph, what nonsense are you guessing? I just felt sorry for him and gave him a thought. But if he really has the strength to go up Grave God Mountain, there is indeed hope to resurrect his fellow cultivator. But in my opinion, it’s difficult. The tier 6 Emperor is just the threshold,” the old man with the goat horns commented.

The tier 6 Emperor is the threshold!

Jian Wushuang wasn’t too surprised by this. After all, many tier 6 Emperors who entered the Divine Tomb had fallen, and the location of Grave God

Mountain had not been found..
