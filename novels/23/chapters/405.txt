Chapter 406: The First Fight

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

It was a sweltering summer day. The sun baked the ground and the air was hot and dry.

Jian Wushuang and his teammates had traveled Outer Area for several days, but they had not encountered any teams from the hostile camp.

Lei Dao, who was easily irritable, looked impatient, while the other members were calm.

“Lei Dao, it’s been a long time since we last met. You still haven’t changed.” Sir Axe cast a slight smile at Lei Dao.

“I’ve always been like that,” Lei Dao replied with a shrug.

Suddenly... Boom! A violent roar sounded from a distance, followed by a faint stream of power.

“What’s this?”

They immediately looked in the direction of the noise.

“A fierce fight ahead?” Sir Axe’s eyes lit up.

“Haha, it’s time for us to fight.” Lei Dao laughed.

There were only two camps on the entire Flaming Battlefield. If there was a fierce fight, it must have been initiated by a group from the rival camp.

“Let’s go. Hurry up,” Sir Axe hustled the rest along. The group sped up toward the fighting ahead.

As they approached, understanding dawned on them.

The two groups engaged in the raging battle were both strong. However, one side had lost two members and seemed to be at a huge disadvantage. This squad began to run in the direction of Jian Wushuang and his teammates.

“Hum?”

The leader of this squad, a brown-haired man, had been pleasantly surprised when he saw Jian Wushuang’s group approach.

“We’re in the same camp. Please do me a favor,” the brown-haired man said.

Sir Axe looked from the brown-haired man to the squad of Marquis Cangyue. He nodded. “OK!”

“Go!”

Sir Axe issued his command discreetly. Jian Wushuang, Lei Dao, and the other commanders charged toward the squad of Marquis Cangyue.

The brown-haired man turned to rejoin the fight.

“Hey hey, this our first fight in Flaming Battlefield. We have to win.” Lei Dao licked his lips. His eyes were eager.

Jian Wushuang considered the Marquis Cangyue squad.

Their leader was a young man in cyan clothes who radiated evil. When he realized that he could not sense the tokens of the newcomers, his face fell.

“Damn it. Another squad from Marquis Piaoxue!”

The young man’s eyes were flinty as he gestured to his squad. “Leave now!”

His squad obeyed and retreated.

Their squad was not strong enough to fight against more than a squad of eight people.

They did not have the ability to deal with two squads.

Lei Dao was anxious as the rival squad retreated. He shouted to Jian Wushuang. “Swordsman, we’re depending on you. Don’t let them run away.”

Lei Dao was unwilling to miss this rare opportunity to fight.

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang nodded imperceptibly. An overwhelming surge of Sword Essence rose from his body. Invisible waves of Sword Essence rapidly radiated outwards and covered the entire area.

As the Marquis Cangyue squad was close to Jian Wushuang, they immediately felt the effects of his Sword Realm and were suppressed.

“What?”

The Marquis Cangyue experts were astonished as their movement was greatly hampered. It was as though they were stuck in mud.

Sir Axe and his comrades were elated.

“Swordsman, good job,” Sir Axe praised Jian Wushuang. They began to hunt down their opponents.

“Crap.”

The Marquis Cangyue experts panicked, but they could only try their best to resist the advances of Sir Axe’s quad.

As they launched counterattacks, they realized that Sword Realm also had an effect of suppressing their strength. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“What an odd skill this is!” the rival squad’s leader looked terrified.

With the help of Sword Realm, Jian Wushuang and his comrades gained an advantage over their opponents.

Furthermore, the overall strength of two squads was far superior to that of the Marquis Cangyue squad. They were therefore able to overwhelm the latter with ease.

The Marquis Cangyue squad managed to hold out for a while. Then they started losing ground.

“Run! Run in a different direction!”

The rival squad’s leader looked grave as he cried out. His escape was blocked by Sir Axe and the brown-haired man.

Being team leaders, all three of them were at the Peak of Stage Two and had two Origin Marks. However, the rival squad leader had to fight two leaders while being under the influence of Sword Realm. He faced imminent death.

“You can’t run!”

Lei Dao sneered, eyes shining with frenzied excitement. Together with his comrades, he continued to pursue the rival experts.

The Marquis Cangyue experts were terrified. Under the influence of Sword Realm, they were unable to escape.

But right at this moment...

“Haha, Sir Axe. You’re very lucky.” Laughter reverberated through the area.

A squad appeared nearby.

The Marquis Cangyue experts were in despair.

The squad that had just appeared was also from Marquis Piaoxue Camp.

This squad had previously fought with Jian Wushuang and his teammates. Their leader was Feng Zhu, who had a grudge against Sir Axe.

At the sight of Feng Zhu, Sir Axe’s face darkened.

His team had been on the cusp of winning this fight. They would have shared the battle achievements when their opponents were killed.

Now that Feng Zhu had appeared with his squad, it did not bode well for them.
