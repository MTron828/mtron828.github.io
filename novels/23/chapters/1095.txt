“Warriors of Green Fire World like you are so short-sighted that you don’t know their usage even if you obtain good treasures.” Gu King tittered. “Listen, the Killing Bead can neither recognize the master nor has a need to. Nevertheless, you can still use it perfectly.”

“Did you sense the Killing Intent in the bead?” he asked.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He had checked the bead when he first received it and discovered that the reason behind its name: the bead contained an incredibly potent Killing Intent.

The Killing Intent inside the bead was stronger than anything Jian Wushuang had imagined.

No one in Green Fire Palace would be able to deflect such terrific Killing Intent.

“The essential part of the bead is its Killing Intent. That’s what you need to refine, not the bead itself,” Gu King said.

“Refine the Killing Intent?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes widened. “How?”

He had never heard of directly refining the Killing Intent inside an object.

“That’s why I said you warriors of the Green Fire World are ignorant. Of course you can refine Killing Intent!You just need a refinement technique.” Gu King grinned.

“Refinement technique?” Jian Wushuang was startled.

“You can only find the technique in the Eternal Chaotic World. When I was there with King Luo Zhen, I happened to learn a technique that could be used to refine Killing Intent. I can teach you that,” Gu King said.

“I see.” Jian Wushuang was delighted. “Hurry and teach me the technique.”

Gu King imparted the technique to Jian Wushuang without hesitation.

Jian Wushuang spent three days in meditation after learning the technique and finally mastered it.

“Use the technique and refine the Killing Intent. Be careful, the Killing Intent inside is strong. It’d be disastrous if you can’t control it after refining too much of it, so take it slow,” Gu King said.

“I understand.” With a nod, Jian Wushuang began using the technique to refine the Killing Intent inside the Killing Bead.

He was careful to only refine a tinge of Killing Intent.

“It works.”

Overjoyed as he was, he did not slow down.

Half a day passed by in the blink of an eye.

Jian Wushuang, seated in a lotus position, finally stopped what he was doing.

He opened his eyes and took a deep breath.

“That’s enough. It’d be strenuous to control the Killing Intent if I continue refining it,” he murmured.

Half a day had gone and the Killing Intent that he had refined was far less than 10 percent of the total contained in the bead. Jian Wushuang had done his utmost.

“Now that you’ve refined some of the Killing Intent, do you know how to apply it without my instruction?” Gu King asked.

“Sure.” Jian Wushuang grinned.

He knew very well how to use the Killing Intent.

Killing Intent had an enormous impact on one’s consciousness. If he combined the Killing Intent with his consciousness attack—one of his best tricks—it would greatly enhance his attacks.

“I’ve just created the Swordplay of Speed. I should make some amendments to the Heaven’s Bane, which is based on the Swordplay of Speed, so that it contains two conceptions of fast and slow. The Heaven’s Bane contains consciousness attack so all I need to do is try my best to modify it!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining.

Heaven’s Bane was extremely weird. It was one of his killing moves.

After making a breakthrough in the Sword Principle and refining part of Killing Intent in the Killing Bead, there was still great potential for the killing move.

Jian Wushuang immediately began researching.

With the end of spring came summer, which was soon replaced by autumn. Time had really flown by.

It was still rather calm in Green Fire Palace.

The experts there boasted of extremely long lifespans. For them, 10,000 or even 100,000 years passed as quickly as the blink of an eye. However, time was precious to Jian Wushuang, a newcomer to the palace.

This was the eighth year since he first arrived in Green Fire Palace.

He stood alone in the courtyard of the mansion that he lived in.

He held the Blood Mountain Sword in hand and his eyes were partially open.

The peach tree in front of him blossomed every season of the year. This was, of course, due to the unique landform where Green Fire Palace was located.

With the passing of a breeze, a peach blossom fell gently from the branch.

Before the peach blossom could reach the ground, Jian Wushuang moved.

He drew out his sword and brandished it.

A splendid and mighty sword light flared.

The sword light was dazzling and fascinating.

However, the sword light moved extremely slowly.

However, it was the same sword light that cut the peach blossom, which almost reached the ground, in half. It only landed on the ground when the sword light vanished.

Jian Wushuang withdrew his sword and opened his eyes. He smiled when he saw the two halves of the peach blossom.

“I’ve finally perfected Heaven’s Bane after several years of research.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He had complete the creation of three Sword Principles and equipped each with a suitable swordsmanship.

The Coalescence Sword Principle was equipped with Bladed Surge.

Speed Sword Principle was equipped with Death Shadow.

Scarlet Yang Sword Principle was equipped with Heaven’s Bane.

And now, the strongest and the most terrific one in his three sword movements was undoubtedly the Heaven’s Bane!

The movement was also his strongest Killing Move.

“When I created the Speed Sword Principle, the power of Dao increased significantly. Then, I cultivated the Golden Image Secret Skill and improved my defense capability. Now I’ve enhanced the Heaven’s Bane until it’s at its prime. It’s now perfectly combined with the Speed Sword Principle and the Killing Intent of the Killing Bead. I’m now much stronger than when I was in the Ancient Monster Clan.”

“Now that my strength has reached this level, I won’t be able to make much progress in a short time if I continue my cultivation here. It’s time for an adventure on the battlefield!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands tightly.

The huge battlefield was a land of opportunities as well as the place where Green Fire Palace and Jin Gold Kingdom experts met and kill one another.

Jian Wushuang held much anticipation and eagerness for the battlefield. Before this, he was not entirely confident as he was not very strong.

But now, he was confident enough!
