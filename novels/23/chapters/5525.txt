Chapter 5524: I Really Didn’t Do Anything

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation  Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

This time, he hadn’t expected it to be so easily resolved.

He wasn’t afraid that the other party wouldn’t make a move; he was afraid they would endure it indefinitely.

The purpose of coming here was to let outsiders know that in the future, if the Elder Palace were to pass judgment, there would be significant reasons behind it.

His Dao Companion was taken away by someone, and the Origin Source of All Things didn’t favor him either.

It could be considered making a name for oneself.

Jian Wushuang’s gaze gradually turned cold. Now, not to mention 30,000 cubic universe crystals, even if it were 300,000, he would continue to make a scene.

“30,000 cubic universe crystals, are you trying to dismiss me like a beggar?” He directly brushed off the mustard seed in the other party’s hand.

As soon as these words were spoken, Tie San could no longer endure it. He lifted his head, stared fiercely at Jian Wushuang, and his aura erupted at that moment, directly forcing Jian Wushuang to retreat.

To create a false impression, Jian Wushuang retreated for thousands of miles, smashing countless palaces and pavilions and stirring up countless Sword Qis.

From the outside, it seemed that Jian Wushuang would not only escape death this time but also suffer severe injuries.

Tie San was very surprised; he had only released some aura, not intending to take action.

Vice Hall Master Zhong, who was closest, could also perceive Tie San’s thoughts. Therefore, he didn’t intervene.

“What’s going on?” Vice Hall Master Zhong couldn’t care less about other matters. Wu Zuo had given the order to ensure Jian Wushuang’s safety.

Tie San’s expression looked ugly, hastily explaining, “Vice Hall Master Zhong, you must testify for me. I really didn’t take any action!”

“Tie San, you’ve gone too far, seizing my Dao Companion, robbing my fortune. We are irreconcilable!” Jian Wushuang angrily shouted.

The distant voice echoed, and many onlookers heard it.

In the wake of such a major incident, Dongsheng and Wanyan were also present at the scene.

Upon hearing Jian Wushuang’s piercing roar, some were moved and immediately approached.

The strong members of the Longevity Hall on the periphery wanted to intervene, but Dongsheng, now possessing the combat power of a top-level tier 6 Emperor, was not easily stopped.

With such a significant event unfolding, the Emperor of the Longevity Hall dared not act decisively. He merely symbolically attempted to block them, then let the two enter.

After all, so many Inheritors were watching from the outside. If they were to truly engage, it might provoke public outrage.

“Brother Wushuang, we’re late!” Dongsheng and Wanyan entered the ruins and saw Jian Wushuang in tattered clothes, blood at the corners of his mouth.

They were both shaken and then angrily looked towards the main hall of the Longevity Hall in the distance.

Jian Wushuang stood there, his face worn.

But deep down, he was overjoyed.

“Tie San, I will remember today’s humiliation!” Jian Wushuang looked at the opponent unwillingly and said coldly.

The air of resentment instantly soared.

“Let’s go!”

Under the protection of Dongsheng and Wanyan, Jian Wushuang left the Longevity Hall.

Only Tie San and Deputy Hall Master Zhong of the Enforcer Hall remained stunned in place.

“Tie San, it seems you’ve truly offended Jian Wushuang this time!” After leaving these words, Deputy Hall Master Zhong also left directly.

Subsequently, the strong members of the Longevity Hall approached.

“Hall Master, there’s nothing to fear. Jian Wushuang has gone too far. It’s normal for you to be unable to resist taking action!” someone comforted.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Tie San’s expression became even more gloomy. His violent aura directly pushed the person who spoke back several steps, and he roared, “All of you, get lost!”

Now, he had tarnished his reputation beyond redemption.

He couldn’t possibly explain to his subordinates that he didn’t dare to take action just to intimidate Jian Wushuang!

If he said that, there would be no way to mix in the future.

But if he didn’t explain, even his own people would assume that he had ruthlessly dealt with Jian Wushuang.

As the crowd dispersed, their gazes underwent some changes.

Tie San’s image was maintained, still as imposing as ever.

However, offending Jian Wushuang was now a fact.

Not only did he snatch Jian Wushuang’s Dao Companion, but he also came to demand the Origin Source of All Things from Jian Wushuang and ended up being beaten.

This matter quickly spread throughout the Elder Palace.

Palace Master Lu Hua personally brought a generous gift to visit Jian Wushuang.

He was completely unaware of the matter and had not heard any explanations.

Regarding the Origin Source of All Things, even though it had been decided, he would fully support Jian Wushuang. Whether he could obtain it was another matter, but he had already shown his stance.

Normally, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t go to Longevity Hall to demand it.

The matter of the Origin Source of All Things was significant. Although it was said that all the treasures of the Elder Palace on the surface were under the jurisdiction of Longevity Hall, the Origin Source of All Things was something they were not qualified to arrange, let alone Longevity Hall.

According to his speculation, it was probably because of the Dao Companion.

Although Jian Wushuang suffered a setback this time, Palace Master Lu Hua was secretly delighted. In this way, the relationship between Jian Wushuang and the faction of Chang Feng Sword God would become even more distant.

They could consider that they had taken different paths.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang was in the Enforcement Hall.

Lu Hua thought that Jian Wushuang was here to recuperate, so he came specially to express sympathy and comfort.

The result was that upon arrival, Jian Wushuang had already been thrown into the great prison.

Waiting outside for him was Wu Zuo.

“Wu Zuo, my old friend, have you lost your mind? Why did you arrest Jian Wushuang at this time?” Lu Hua was deeply shocked.

According to common sense, Jian Wushuang had the best relationship with Wu Zuo among all the people in the Elderly Palace. Why did Wu Zuo still arrest Jian Wushuang?

Wu Zuo stood there with a sinister air between his eyebrows.

“Palace Master Lu Hua, there are some things you may not be aware of. Jian Wushuang seriously injured a Vice Hall Master of Longevity Hall in the Longevity Hall. If it weren’t for Brother Tie San’s intervention, he would have almost perished,” Wu Zuo explained with righteousness.

“According to the regulations of the Law Enforcement Hall, Jian Wushuang has committed a serious crime and must be detained in prison awaiting punishment.”

Upon hearing this, Lu Hua was completely stunned.

Suddenly, he thought of something.

At this moment, Tie San, wearing a smile, walked out of the hall and greeted, “Greetings, Palace Master Lu Hua!”

Upon seeing the newcomer, Emperor Lu Hua’s expression turned completely cold.

“Tie San, did you orchestrate this matter?” Emperor Lu Hua asked coldly.

If that were the case, he would have to sever ties with Wu Zuo in the future.

Last time, when Wu Zuo suggested adding another Palace Master, Lu Hua politely declined.

He never expected that Wu Zuo would completely take the wrong path, colluding with Chang Feng. With Chang Feng and Wu Zuo dealing with Qingniu, Lu Hua might be forced to step down and let Wu Zuo take his place.

Tie San had lost the earlier anger at this moment, expressing happiness instead, “The Enforcement Hall acts according to regulations, and they do it very well. It has nothing to do with Longevity Hall!”

“Fine!” Emperor Lu Hua, in extreme anger, laughed sarcastically, saying, “Very good! You handle things really well!”

Leaving these words behind, he swung his sleeve and was about to leave directly.

However, thinking of Jian Wushuang, he stopped in his tracks, not turning around, just saying coldly, “Engaging in private combat, seriously injuring the elders, this matter is indeed very serious. I will personally inquire!”

Then, he directly tore through the space and arrived at the bottom of Yuanyang Lake.

There, a water prison existed.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang was suppressed in this place.

After leaving Longevity Hall not long ago, Wu Zuo personally took him away and brought him here.
