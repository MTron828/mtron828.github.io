4151 Taking Action

“If you want this godly medicine, you’ll have to ask the sword in my hand first,” The Taixu Son of God, Qing Xuzi, who had sent Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and the other three flying with one sword, was handsome and expressionless as he walked over.

The Great Sun Divine Kingdom, the Blood Sky Palace, and the Great Void Divine Hall!

The experts of the three top forces stared at the Ninth Kalpa King at the same time!

As for the valley, although there were still many Ultimate Rulers present, including some of the stronger Ruler teams, these Rulers all retreated to the side in tacit understanding when they saw this scene.

They knew very well that with the Great Sun Divine Kingdom, Blood Sky Palace, Great Void Divine Hall, and the Ninth Kalpa King present, it would be difficult for ordinary Ultimate Rulers like them to snatch the divine medicine.

In this battle, the protagonists were the four major forces that were currently facing each other. To be exact, there were only two parties that were facing each other.

The Divine Life Palace, led by the Ninth Kalpa King, was on one side.

The Great Sun Divine Kingdom, Blood Sky Palace, and Great Void Divine Hall had joined forces.

They had no choice. In front of the Ninth Kalpa King, they had to join forces.

The Ninth Kalpa King’s eyes narrowed slightly, and a grave look appeared on his face.

Although he was conceited, he was not stupid. The three forces had more than ten peak Ultimate Rulers. Lord Zhennan, Qing Xuzi, and the five Blood Nether Emissaries were invincible Rulers when they joined forces. Now that they had joined forces, even he had to take them seriously.

Off in the distance, the Ruler Silver Roc was watching him like a tiger watching its prey. If he had the chance, he would strike like lightning!

“Ninth Kalpa King, what should we do now?” Divine Marquis Qingfeng asked.

The Ninth Kalpa King took a deep breath and replied, “No matter what, I must get this godly medicine!”

Then, he turned over his right hand and a nine-leafed divine herb appeared. He looked at Jian Wushuang and said, “Jian Wushuang, I know that although you’re only a stage four great Ruler, your divine power is eight thousand times stronger than an ordinary cultivator’s. In addition to the power of will given by the laws of the universe, your divine power should be comparable to that of a top Ultimate Ruler. In addition to your comprehension of the laws of the universe and your gifted super power, you’re definitely not weaker than Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and Ruler Violet Eye.”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded. He had to admit that he did have the battle strength to do so.

“You also have a divine body that’s 68000 kilometers tall, and your divine power is nearly limitless. As long as an Supreme doesn’t appear, there’s basically no one who can kill you.” The Ninth Kalpa King said again.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded again.

“This is a Nine-Leaf Sword Grass. It contains an extremely high amount of origin power of the Dao of the sword. I obtained it from a secret realm ten chaos cycles ago. In terms of value, it’s not much inferior to this godly medicine. As long as you help me hold off that Son of God Taixu for a moment, this Nine-Leaf Sword Grass will be yours. How about it?” The Ninth Kalpa King said seriously.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was shocked. He had heard of the Nine-Leaf Sword Grass.

The Nine-Leaf Sword Grass was born from the heaven and earth, growing by absorbing the sword Qi of the world. To a sword cultivator, it was a peerless treasure that could only be found by chance!

If Jian Wushuang had this Nine-Leaf Sword Grass, he was confident that his comprehension of the sword principle universe origin would reach a whole new level. At that time, his strength would enter a whole new world!

“Sure.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

The Ninth Kalpa King smiled indifferently and directly pushed the Nine-Leaf Sword Grass to Jian Wushuang.

“Divine Lord Qingfeng, help me block the five blood underworld messengers for a moment. I’ll give you one million universe origin stones. If you can get through this smoothly and return to the divine Palace, I’ll give you a top-tier law Cardinal treasure. What do you think?” Ninth Kalpa King looked at Divine Marquis Qingfeng and said.

“Five Blood Nether Emissaries?” Divine Marquis Qingfeng frowned and then laughed, “These five blood underworld messengers aren’t that strong individually, but when they work together, their combat power is no weaker than Qing Xuzi’s. However, I may not have any other skills, but I do have some skills in holding people back. I can try my best in a short while.”

Although Divine Marquis Qingfeng was not as famous as Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and Ruler Violet Eye, it did not mean that he was weak. As one of the old Ultimate Rulers of the Divine Life Palace, he was stronger than Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and the others, but he rarely fought.

Furthermore, his ability to entrap and trap enemies was also one of a kind.

“Very!”

Upon seeing this, the Ninth Kalpa King’s heroic spirit soared.

He did not expect Jian Wushuang and Divine Marquis Qingfeng to defeat Qing Xuzi and the blood Messenger. He only needed them to stall for a while. He was confident that he could defeat the Great Sun Divine Kingdom and kill both of them!

At the level of an Ultimate Ruler, he, the Ninth Kalpa King, was invincible!

“Absorb!”

The next moment, the Ninth Kalpa King’s big hand stretched out and directly turned into a towering giant hand, covering the sky and the sun, and grabbed at the Supreme divine medicine on the edge of the cliff.

“Good!”

The red-robed Prince Zhennan from the Great Sun Divine Kingdom suddenly broke into a battle-thirsty smile. He took the lead and charged into the sky, crashing down on the giant hand!

“Hahaha, let me see if the Ninth Kalpa King, who is rumored to have the battle strength of a Supreme martial artist, is really that amazing!” Behind him, two golden Dharma wheels appeared. They were like blazing suns and shot out a bloodthirsty red light.

“You’re looking for death!”

Killing intent flashed in the Ninth Kalpa King’s eyes, and he pressed his hand down fiercely. In an instant, the towering giant hand that was originally grabbing the Supreme divine medicine changed its attack and slammed down on Lord Zhennan!

“Arrogant.”

On the other side, Qing Xuzi sneered. He grabbed the hilt of his sword with his right hand and unsheathed it.

A white-hot sword light shot out like a roaring dragon and slashed at the Ninth Kalpa King.

After this strike, Qing Xuzi did not give up. He took a heavy step and shot toward the Ninth Kalpa King.

“No one is allowed to take what the Blood Sky Palace wants.” The five Blood Nether Emissaries spoke at the same time, their voices hoarse and strange.

In the next moment, the five Blood Nether Emissaries flashed and disappeared from where they were.

At this moment, the unparalleled Rulers of the three forces charged at the Ninth Kalpa King at the same time!

Bang!

The Ninth Kalpa King’s palm slammed down, directly smacking Prince Zhennan, who was soaring into the sky, to the ground.

Just as Qing Xuzi’s sword was about to hit the Ninth Kalpa King…

Wuwuwuwuwu!

An equally dazzling sword light suddenly streaked across the sky and destroyed Qing Xuzi’s sword. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Then, a cold-looking figure in black stepped out and stood in front of Qing Xuzi.

“Your opponent is me.” The black-robed figure said indifferently.

“Eh? A fourth-stage chief Ruler?” Qing Xuzi’s figure, which was rushing forward, paused. He then squinted his eyes and asked coldly, “Who are you?”

The black-robed figure held the divine sword and replied calmly, “Jian Wushuang.”

Jian Wushuang? “I’ve never heard of it,” Qing Xuzi shook his head.

The next moment!

His eyes flashed with ruthlessness as he drew his sword and slashed forward again.

I don’t care who you are. Whoever blocks me will die!!!
