Chapter 1482: Jian Wushuang’s Request

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

When Jian Wushuang saw that the owner of Sky Sword Mountain had allowed himself to leave, he was delighted but he didn’t move at all.

“Why, what’s up?” The owner of Sky Sword Mountain sounded cold.

Jian Wushuang thought for a while and said politely, “Senior, to be frank with you, I have two requests. I hope that senior will agree.”

“Haha.” The owner of Sky Sword Mountain suddenly laughed. The laughter sounded casual but as it reverberated, the entire cave dwelling shook vigorously. Jian Wushuang was standing in the middle of the cave dwelling and his face went pale immediately. Luckily, he had already reached the first level of state of mind. Hence, he could continue to stand on his feet in the laughter. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

If it were to be any ordinary person, even a Real God, as long as they wasn’t on the first level of state of mind, they might have knelt on the ground.

The owner of Sky Sword Mountain stopped laughing and his face grew cold.

“Such a joke!”

“I am willing to let you go and I’m nice enough to do so. You have the guts to request something from me?”

Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave. His mind and soul were quivering madly under the huge pressure that the owner of Sky Sword Mountain imposed. However, he clenched his teeth and persisted.

“Humph, as you’re a disciple of Star Palace, tell me about it,” the owner of Sky Sword Mountain glanced at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was delighted. He took a deep breath and started saying, “The first thing is that I have an enemy over the years that I’ve spent in Sky Sword Prison. His name is Blood Emperor!”

“Blood Emperor is one of the four Kings in Sky Sword Prison. I’ve come across him twice and I’m definite that he’s from Holocaust Sect!”

“Hence, I’d like to request that you, senior, eliminate him!”

“Holocaust Sect?” The owner of Sky Sword Mountain looked at Jian Wushuang and he looked shocked.

He previously thought Jian Wushuang was stupid to ask for something at a crucial moment.

But from how things were looking…

“Holocaust Sect is the public enemy of countless cultivators in Eternal Chaotic World. Regardless of when, as soon as an expert of Holocaust Sect is found, he must be exterminated immediately. However, are you sure that Blood Emperor is from Holocaust Sect?” The owner of Sky Sword Mountain stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

“Alright then. Wait for a bit,” the owner of Sky Sword Mountain said, and then he closed his eyes.

Sky Sword Prison, Darkness Mountain, in the crimson castle.

Blood Emperor was lying leisurely on a crimson bed.

“Now Jian Wushuang has left, my Darkness Mountain has finally resumed its tranquility,” Blood Emperor muttered to himself. He had already sent a command to all the experts, who had left Darkness Mountain to avoid Jian Wushuang previously, to return.

After all, he was one of the overlords in Sky Sword Prison.

If those experts who were an appendage to him weren’t around, he wouldn’t feel like an overlord at all.

In Sky Sword Prison, in such a dull and fearless environment, his only happiness was derived from his feeling as an overlord.

Suddenly… Vroom vroom. A strange force condensed in the void above Crimson Castle.

“This force? What’s going on?”

“Could it be that someone is leaving Sky Sword Prison again?”

Blood Emperor was still in astonishment but the void above substantiated into a towering hand and grabbed him at lightning speed.

Blood Emperor had no strength to resist but was caught by the huge hand. At the same time, there was a terrifying, forceful strength that flushed into Blood Emperor’s body and marched unhindered in his body.

“It’s… it’s the owner of Sky Sword Mountain,” Blood Emperor had fear spread across his face.

“Humph, it seems like what Jian Wushuang said was right. You’re really from Holocaust Sect.”

A cold voice traveled across the universe. At the same time, it rang in Blood Emperor’s head.

Blood Emperor stiffened in an instant.

“Jian Wushuang, it’s Jian Wushuang?”

“He met the owner of Sky Sword Mountain and told him about my identity!”

“No, no!”

“The owner of Sky Sword Mountain, please let me off! Please show mercy!”

Blood Emperor immediately roared and pleaded.

“You’re a lackey from Holocaust Sect and you want me to show mercy? Die!”

Then, the huge hand exerted strength and it was like pinching an ant to death. The hand crushed Blood Emperor’s body into pieces.

Blood Emperor’s aura immediately dispersed too.

After that, the huge hand gradually vanished into thin air too.

The universe resumed its original state.

However, in the shattered ruins of Crimson Castle, the lady in green, who was appendage to Blood Emperor, felt an overwhelming billow in her heart.

“Blood Emperor is from Holocaust Sect. The owner of Sky Sword Mountain found out about his identity and killed him?”

“Jian Wushuang. Is it because of Jian Wushuang?”

…

In the dim cave dwelling, the owner of Sky Sword Mountain opened his eyes again.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re right. Blood Emperor was really from Holocaust Sect and I’ve exterminated him.”

As the owner of Sky Sword Mountain spoke, there was rage in his eyes, “These people from Holocaust Sect, they deserve to die. They lurk among various cultivators in Eternal Chaotic World. If they do not reveal some tricks from Holocaust Sect, no one would be able to tell their identity. Even if it was me. You helped me this time. Otherwise, I wouldn’t know that I had imprisoned an expert from Holocaust Sect in Sky Sword Prison!”

“Tell me, what’s your second request?”

Jian Wushuang felt touched.

He could clearly feel that the owner of Sky Sword Mountain was treating him slightly better than earlier.

Maybe it was because he took a huge risk to request Blood Emperor’s death. From the owner of Sky Sword Mountain’s point of view, it wasn’t a request but a helping hand from Jian Wushuang. Hence, he had a better feeling about Jian Wushuang.

“Another request is that I hope senior can release one of the four Kings, Fiery King, from Sky Sword Prison,” Jian Wushuang said with extreme care.

“Fiery King?” The owner of Sky Sword Mountain stole a glance at Jian Wushuang and smiled faintly, “You and Fiery King are related?”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded, “He took good care of me when I was in Sky Sword Prison. Plus, he and I are from the same lineage originally. He could be considered as one of my seniors. I naturally want him to be released. Of course, if senior were to have any request in return, I would try my best to fulfill it.”

“Oh?” The owner of Sky Sword Mountain immediately waved his hand, “If it was an ordinary Real God or Universe God, I would allow it because you helped me unearth an expert from Holocaust Sect earlier. However, Fiery King is one of the Kings in Sky Sword Prison. He is quite useful to me, so… Please return.”

“Senior…” Jian Wushuang panicked.

“Return first. In the future, if my Sky Sword Mountain needs assistance from Lineage of Star, we can discuss it then,” the owner of Sky Sword Mountain said and then closed his eyes.

Hearing that, Jian Wushuang was convinced. He didn’t bother the owner of Sky Sword Mountain further but bowed politely to him before he turned to leave.
