Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Silence descended in the Drill Ground.

Everyone waited with bated breath for the reveal of Jian Wushuang’s three wedding gifts.

Jian Wushuang didn’t disappoint. He flipped his palm and showed a nearly clear jade bottle. There was a light purple elixir in it. Unlike general elixirs, this elixir wasn’t fragrant and had an odorous scent.

The experts frowned when they saw the elixir.

“This elixir is called Crape Myrtle Elixir.” Jian Wushuang looked up at Emperor Leng. His voice rang out across the whole Drill Ground.

“Crape Myrtle Elixir?” Many people were confused as they had never heard about it or were aware of its function.

However, Emperor Leng seemed shocked.

Leng Rushuang, who was sitting beside Emperor Leng, appeared stunned as well. She looked at Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang continued, “More than 200 years ago, I was a Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard in the Royal Guard. I went through a Hell Level assignment with the other three Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards.”

“Hell Level?” Everyone was taken aback.

The Blood Eagle Guard was well-known in the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land.

They had heard of some of their assignments too.

Hell Level assignment?

Hell Level assignments were fraught with danger.?There had been few such assignments in the history of the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land.

“The reason for that Hell Level assignment was because the princess had been badly poisoned. To control the poison, a Natural Treasure called Yin Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit was needed to refine the Crape Myrtle Elixir. I went to an Impasse in the Eternal World with other Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards. After surmounting numerous obstacles, I was the only one who survived and retrieved the Yin Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit.”

“Now, I present the Crape Myrtle Elixir, refined by that Yin Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit, as my first wedding gift.” Jian Wushuang’s voice was as loud as thunder and it rang out across the Drill Ground.

Of course, he had mentioned the Impasse without talking about the Stellar Fog Sea.

The Stellar Fog Sea had been a mystery for a long time. If it were public knowledge that he had emerged from it alive,?it would inevitably cause some trouble.

Understanding dawned on the spectators.

The Crape Myrtle Elixir might not be very valuable, but it had been retrieved at great cost. The sincerity of the gift was incomparable.

As for the function of the Crape Myrtle Elixir…

Seated at the throne in the middle of the stand, Emperor Leng raised his eyebrows. Looking at Jian Wushuang, he thought to himself, “he really came out of the Stellar Fog Sea and got the Yin Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit. How did he manage to do it?”

Leng Rushuang was trembling slightly.

“He went to the Stellar Fog Sea for me?” Her emotions were in turmoil.

More than 200 years ago, Emperor Leng had sent some experts to the Stellar Fog Sea to get the Yin Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit for her. However, she hadn’t known that Jian Wushuang had been one of them.

The Stellar Fog Sea. It was the Impasse from which no one came out alive.

“Jian Wushuang.” Emperor Leng finally said, “your first gift is indeed quite useful for Shuang’er.”

Everyone was amazed with Emperor Leng’s acknowledgement.

For a fleeting moment, Xia Mang looked upset.?“It’s just opportunistic. Even if his Crape Myrtle Elixir is more useful than my Youth-retaining Elixir, it’s just the first gift.”

Everyone stared at Jian Wushuang as he smiled and took out his second gift.

The second gift was also an elixir in a jade bottle. However, there were 5.

“Distinguished Emperor Leng, Elders. You are all very knowledgeable. I believe you can recognize these five elixirs without my introduction.” Jian Wushuang took one out and placed it on his palm.

The experts on the stand stared at the light yellow elixir.

“Is it the… the Bodhi Dan?”

“Yes, it’s Bodhi Dan. I’ve seen it before. It has the same color and same fragrance. I am sure.”

“The legendary Bodhi Dan?”

Experts on the stand were agitated. Some of them even stood up.

Bodhi Dan, the elixir that could allow an Eternal Realm expert to easily become a Dao Master.

It was a legendary elixir in the Eternal World. It was almost extinct.

One Bodhi Dan had a 90 percent chance of turning an Eternal Realm expert into a Dao Master.

Five Bodhi Dans meant five Dao Masters. These were human Dao Masters unlike Xia Mang’s Blood Emperor Puppets.

Human experts were obviously more valuable than Puppet Fighters.

Jian Wushuang’s first gift, the Crape Myrtle Elixir might have been only slightly better than the Youth-retaining Elixir.

The five Bodhi Fruits were undoubtedly far better than the two Blood Emperor Puppets.

“I am very grateful to predecessor Alchemy Master for the Bodhi Dans.” Jian Wushuang looked up at Alchemy Master.

He had five Bodhi Fruits, with which it was already difficult to refine four Bodhi Dans. As the No. 1 alchemist, Alchemy Master had refined five. The success rate was 100%.

Seeing the five Bodhi Dans, Xia Yu from the Xia Clan became upset. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“How is it possible? How did he get the Bodhi Dan? And he even brought five?”

Xia Mang looked terrible, but calmed down soon. “Hmm, though your second gift is more precious than my Blood Emperor Puppets, don’t forget my third gift!”

“The third gift from our Xia Clan is an enormous treasure house. It’s invincible!”

Xia Mang was absolutely confident with their third gift.

So what if the Crape Myrtle Elixir had a better function than his Youth-retaining Elixir?

So what if five Bodhi Fruits were more precious than his two Blood Emperor Puppets?

The most important and valuable gift they had prepared was the third one.

It had outshone all the gifts from the others, combined.

What did someone from an ordinary Sect of the realm have that could compete with that?

Jian Wushuang didn’t mind Xia Mang at all. He looked at the experts and took a deep breath.

He took out the third gift that had been prepared by his Master, which had totally shocked Gu King and himself.
