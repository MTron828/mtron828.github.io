Chapter 1543: The Arrival Of The Palace Master

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

He was exceptionally talented in manufacturing weapons and using spells of many realms.

Moreover, he was also very mysterious.

This caused Jian Wushuang to think of his own Master, Xuan Yi, instantly.

Similarly, his Master’s background was extremely mysterious.

Moreover, his Master was also very proficient in manufacturing weapons, using spells, as well as in many other areas.

He was very similar to the great person Real God Wu Bei mentioned.

“Could it be Master?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

However, he was unable to confirm it.

It might just be a coincidence.

However, it might also be him.

If the great person who Real God Wu Bei had mentioned were really his Master Xuan Yi, then he would indeed be extremely mysterious.

“No matter what, I have no way of finding out if that person is my Master,” Jian Wushuang shook his head and stopped thinking about it.

“I have given you all the things that you wanted. Remember our agreement. When you have the ability, please help me to kill the Demon Heart Kingdom’s monarch. Now, please go!” Real God Wu Bei said.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes squinted and he glanced at Real God Wu Bei deeply. After that, he gave a bow and entered the space passage which led to the outside world.

With Jian Wushuang leaving, only Real God Wu Bei was left in the big cave.

As Real God Wu Bei stood in his position, he raised his eyes and looked up at the heavens.

“Haha~~~”

All of a sudden, an insane laught could be heard from Real God Wu Bei and it shook the universe.

“Old bastard, I have done what you wanted me to do. Hence, I, Wu Bei… no longer owe you anything!”

“Haha!!!”

A mad laugh resounded within the whole cave and the enormous cave also started to shake with laughter. At the next moment, the whole cave started to collapse.

As for Real God Wu Bei, who was in the cave, he was completely swallowed by the collapsed cave and his figure dissipated slowly.

…

Outside Wu Bei’s cave, the vast hall was still floating in the sky of the island.

Inside the big hall, many experts had gathered.

However, at that very moment, the eyes of the experts were focused on Lei Chao.

“Two White Blaze Fruit trees had been obtained by that little kid from the Lineage of Star!”

“Where did the insane luck of the Lineage of Star come from!”

With so many experts, as well as a few Almighties staring at him, even Lei Chao felt fearful.

However, at that moment… Swish! Another shadow appeared out of thin air from within the big hall.

It was a silvery, white-haired old man. His face was old and his aura was very normal. Hence, He looked like an ordinary old man.

However, when this ‘old man’ appeared, many experts in the vast hall went silent immediately.

The eyes of the Almighties also focused on the old man at once.

As for Lei Chao, who had felt a bit fearful moments ago, he became delighted when the old man arrived.

“Palace Master!”

Lei Chao appeared in front of the silvery white-haired old man immediately and greeted him respectfully.

“It’s the founder of the Lineage of Star!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“The Star’s old monster?”

“This old bastard actually came personally?”

A number of Almighties frowned.

However, they also knew that Jian Wushuang had obtained two White Blaze Fruit trees from Wu Bei’s cave. Since this was such a big matter, it would naturally cause the founder of the Lineage of Star to be alarmed.

Therefore, the founder of the Lineage of Star ought to come personally.

“You may stand up,” the silvery white-haired old man who was the Star Palace Master glanced at Lei Chao and questioned him at the same time: “Where’s the little kid from my Lineage of Star?”

“He is still inside Wu Bei’s cave and is about to come out soon,” Lei Chao said immediately.

“Ok.” The Star Palace Master nodded. After that, he looked toward the Almighties, who were at the front of the big hall.

“Haha. Long time no see, Star old monster.”

A hearty laugh came from the center of the big hall from the red-haired old man who had a horn on his forehead. Quite a number of Almighties beside him stood up as well.

However, apart from the red-haired old man, when the other Almighties looked at the Star Palace Master, it was obvious that they were looking at him with respect.

Similar to Universe Gods and Real Gods, there were weak and strong Almighties.

There were twenty Almighties present and this was considered a lot. However, among them, only the red-haired old man could compete with the Star Palace Master. As for the other Almighties, such as the owner of the Sky Sword Mountain and Tower Master Qi Fu, they were weaker than the Star Palace Master.

“Huo You, you’re here as well?” The Star Palace Master looked at the red-haired old man.

“I just happened to be in the Red Dragon Sanctuary during this period of time. After I knew about the appearance of Wu Bei’s cave, I hurried over to take a look,” the red-haired old man, Huo You, giggled, “Star, come and take a seat.”

With a wave of Huo You’s hand, a long, narrow table appeared beside him immediately.

The Star Palace Master did not stand on ceremony. With a flash of his body, he appeared in front of the long, narrow table and sat down straight away.

“Star, that little kid from your Lineage of Star has indeed brought you credit. With so many Universe Gods fighting for the three White Blaze Fruit trees, he still managed to obtain two of them in the end. We are all really envious of you,” Huo You gasped in admiration.

“This little kid’s luck is indeed not too bad. However, as he had obtained two White Blaze Fruit trees, there’s no avoiding the attention of people with hidden agendas. Hence, I have to rush over personally to bring him back,” the Star Palace Master said nonchalantly.

As soon as his words left his mouth, the expressions of quite a number of Almighties in the area changed slightly.

Before this, there were indeed some people among the Almighties who had had their eyes set on Jian Wushuang. After all, two White Blaze Fruit trees were extremely attractive.

However, at the very moment, with the arrival of the Star Palace Master, those people had dropped the idea at once.

They had no guts to snatch items away from the Star Palace Master. Moreover, they did not have the ability to do so either.

“Haha. Don’t be so blunt. As long as everyone understands,” Huo You chuckled, “Oh right, that little kid of your Lineage of Star should be coming out of the cave soon.”

“Understood,” the Star Palace Master nodded his head. With a flash of thought in his mind, an invisible seal appeared beside him and Huo You immediately.

The invisible seal was merely a technique used to prevent others from hearing their conversation.

“Star, could it be that you wish to tell me something? Such that you have placed a protective screen on the time and space around us?” Huo You looked toward the Star Palace Master with surprise.

“Indeed, I need your help with something,” The Star Palace Master spoke.

“What’s wrong?” Huo You questioned.

“When the little kid of my Lineage of Star comes out, no matter what you see from him, please don’t mention anything,” the Star Palace Master said.

“Oh?” Huo You raised his eyebrows, “Could it be that the little kid has some sort of secret?”

“Please, just tell me whether you agree to it or not,” the Star Palace Master said.

“Haha. After hearing such things from you, I am now very curious about that little kid. Don’t worry, since you have asked me personally, I will naturally not decline. No matter what I manage to see later, I will not say anything,” Huo You laughed.
