2051 Pick Up

“If I’m not mistaken, Jian Wushuang will arrive in Bronze Heart Region in no time. By then, the seven of us will apply battle formation and join forces with Mister Demon King to hem him in. Then, kill him,” a lady in a white robe who stood among the seven Great Emperors said coldly. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“The battle formation that the seven of us will form is best at trapping people. As long as Jian Wushuang comes to Bronze Heart Region, no doubt, he will die!”

“Yes, he will die.”

The other few Great Emperors said. They were obviously confident about their battle formation.

They were waiting patiently too.

The time continued to fly past.

In the vast void in Three-Emperors World, Jian Wushuang continued to plunge forward. The direction in which he was flying led to Bronze Heart Region.

Demon King Chen Yu and the other Great Emperors saw and they continued to follow closely behind him.

Demon King Chen Yu smirked in his heart when he saw the direction Jian Wushuang was plunging in, “Jian Wushuang, even though you have impressive skills, your final outcome is death!”

“You can’t escape Three-Emperors World!!”

Demon King Chen Yu knew that there were seven Great Emperors waiting at Bronze Heart Region.

When Jian Wushuang got there, he would work together with the formation of the seven Great Emperors to take down Jian Wushuang.

That was the plan in his head.

However, just as Jian Wushuang passed another region, there were less than three regions to reach the Bronze Heart Region.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang suddenly plunged in another direction. He flew towards another void.

“What?” Demon King Chen Yu suddenly grew glum.

From what he saw, Jian Wushuang should have continued to rush to the Bronze Heart Region.

He definitely has to go there.

Emperor Bai in Sanctuary Alliance had already commanded the experts in Sanctuary Alliance to pick Jian Wushuang up from Bronze Heart Region.

Emperor Bai gave a command and the Great Emperor in Sanctuary Alliance had already departed. They were really rushing to Bronze Heart Region.

Of course, Jian Wushuang has to go there too!

“Did he do that to confuse me?” Demon King Chen Yu creased his eyebrows and said.

It was merely his suspicion, but it was a feasible suspicion.

Jian Wushuang’s following actions cleared up his suspicion entirely.

Because after Jian Wushuang passed through another region, he continued to plunge to a region further away from Bronze Heart Region.

“D*mn it. This boy didn’t intend to go to the Bronze Heart Region at all!!!” Demon King Chen Yu instantly roared in anger. At the same time, he sent a message to question him, “What’s going on? Didn’t you say the Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance are going to pick him up from Bronze Heart Region? Why doesn’t this boy look like he is going to Bronze Heart Region??”

However, on the other side of the communication token, the reply was simple and straightforward. He said that it was really Emperor Bai’s command and the Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance were reaching Bronze Heart Region.

In other words, Emperor Bai’s command was true and the fact that Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance were going to pick up Jian Wushuang was true also.

However, Jian Wushuang going to Bronze Heart Region… was fake!!!

“Sh*t!”

Demon King Chen Yu’s heart skipped a beat and he instantly understood.

“This boy never intended to head to Bronze Heart Region. Emperor Bai sent the Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance to Bronze Heart Region to confuse us!!!”

“They definitely found out that our spy is among the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance. Hence, they beat us at our own game. They used our spy to give us a piece of false information!”

“D*mn it. We were fooled!”

Demon King Chen Yu’s face grew grave.

There was no doubt that they had been schemed against by Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai.

Jian Wushuang had never thought of going to Bronze Heart Region. He had been running in the direction of the Bronze Heart Region because he was pretending.

Now Jian Wushuang had already stepped foot in the border region of Three-Emperors World.

In this region, there were two figures waiting for Jian Wushuang.

The two people were Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao.

The two of them who stood in the void saw Jian Wushuang appear at the end of their sights and they looked thrilled.

“Haha, Jian Wushuang!!!”

“Sword Emperor!!”

The two Great Emperors immediately greeted Jian Wushuang.

“Abysmal Saint Master, Emperor Jiu Qiao, long time no see!” Jian Wushuang laughed heartily and the three of them quickly gathered.

Jian Wushuang also stopped running away.

As he was there, it was not necessary for him to escape anymore.

Hong!

Demon King Chen Yu’s demonic might spread and he appeared not far from Jian Wushuang and he stopped too.

Then, the total of thirteen Great Emperors who had followed the lead of Ling Zong. They followed behind since Imperial Peak.

Demon King Chen Yu and the thirteen Green Emperors were staring at Jian Wushuang. It was as though they were going to eat Jian Wushuang alive.

“Jian Wushuang, you are really skillful. Since you escaped Imperial City, you have been running in the direction to Bronze Heart Region. You intentionally made us think that you were running to Bronze Heart Region, but in the end, you came to this region?” Demon King Chen Yu’s voice was cold.

“Humph, I knew the movements of Sanctuary Alliance so well. Why would I run to Bronze Heart Region and fall into your trap again?” Jian Wushuang sneered, “Demon King Chen Yu, you must think I’m stupid. But I am certain that there’s really a double agent among the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance because of this!!”

Demon King Chen Yu’s face grew grave but he wasn’t surprised.

Jian Wushuang did it on purpose. He had obviously made use of the double agent.

“You are not stupid, but you are too proud of yourself. You should have left Three-Emperors World without hesitation but you stopped. You gave me another chance to kill you!” Demon King Chen Yu’s gaze was cold and the jade ruler in his hand shined with a bright light again.

The jade ruler was one of his very impressive treasures. It could turn into a sturdy yellow sand realm.

However, as the yellow sand realm had been broken once, it would need some time to be repaired and used again.

Now, after another round of chasing, the yellow sand realm had been repaired. He could totally perform it again. Hence, he naturally had another chance to kill Jian Wushuang.

However, Jian Wushuang flashed a malicious smile when he heard what Demon King Chen Yu said.?“Demon King Chen Yu, I think you misunderstood something. Now, the person who should run isn’t me. It should be… you.”

Demon King Chen Yu was stunned.

The next moment, at the end of the void, there was a figure in a grey robe that appeared and was slowly walking over.

He had white hair and white eyes. Even his skin was terrifyingly fair.

He was a man but his beautiful face would put all the women in Eternal Chaotic World to shame. His charming appearance with his fair skin made him look aloof.

However, ‘his’ arrival made Demon King Chen Yu’s eyes dilate in shock.

“Emperor Bai!!!”
