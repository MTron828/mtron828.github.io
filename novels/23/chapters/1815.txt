Chapter 1816: Strange Person

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the void, Jian Wushuang stood there like a statue. In his eyes, there was a fear that was rarely seen. He stared at the figure in front of him.

That person was in a snow-white robe, untainted by even a speck of dust. His hands were behind his slender figure as he stood in the void. There was no aura given out from his body but it was like air.

However, this person had a pair of deep-seated eyes that considered everything and everybody, that looked down on all living things in the universe, that could even cover heaven and earth.

He stood there without making any actions nor uttering any words, but he made the universe lose its shine..

He knew that the proud and aloof, white-robed figure was the person on the other side of the jade rock in the depth of Chillywind Valley. However, the person was in the depths of Chillywind Valley when Jian Wushuang felt something wasn’t right and immediately fled. In the end, he hadn’t ran far before he saw the person waiting for him ahead.

What kind of skill was that?

“Jian Wushuang, the person in front of you is very strong, really very strong!” King of Venomous Worms’ voice sounded terrified as it rang in Jian Wushuang’s head.

“Obviously. Need you say?” Jian Wushuang cursed.

He, of course, knew the person in front of him was terrifying strong.

Among the experts that he had seen, including the ancient experts, even the feeling that One-star Man and Long Qi had given Jian Wushuang couldn’t be compared to the aloof, white-robed figure in front of him. The only one who could be compared favorably would be Long Qi’s master – the beautiful, black-haired man sleeping in the coffin. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

If the beautiful, black-haired man were to wake up, he might have the ability to compete with this person.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath then bowed in the direction where the aloof, white-robed figure was. “Jian Wushuang has no intention to offend senior. I hope Senior can forgive me.”

As Jian Wushuang spoke, he felt anxious.

One should know that he really had offended the aloof, white-robed man.

The aloof, white-robed man was obviously in a deep sleep in Chillywind Valley or he might be recovering from his injury. But in the end, Jian Wushuang barged into his sleeping place and woke him up with a start… To put himself in his shoes, if someone were to barge in when Jian Wushuang was treating an injury or cultivating in seclusion, he would definitely be furious.

Besides, the aloof, white-robed man was really powerful and he made one feel hopeless. If he were to try to kill Jian Wushuang, Jian Wushuang definitely wouldn’t even stand a chance to struggle.

Hence, Jian Wushuang could only hope that he would calm down.

“Jian Wushuang?”

The aloof, white-robed man put his hands behind his back and floated in the void quietly. His eyes that were deep like stars suddenly looked at Jian Wushuang. He then muttered something and extended his right hand slowly in the direction where Jian Wushuang was and pointed.

“Oh no!” Jian Wushuang’s face changed.

He responded at the first instant. There were flowing lights bursting out from his body, which were bronze-armored Dao soldiers and the four silver-armored Dao soldiers.

Jian Wushuang took out all Dao soldiers that he had brought along. Even though he knew that the Dao soldiers couldn’t stop the person, it was a crucial moment. The longer they held him back, the better.

Boundless divine power in his body was burning madly. He had already performed the secret skill of dragon blood and he was prepared to flee.

At that moment, a terrifying power suddenly descended and instantly froze the spacetime surrounding him.

Jian Wushuang was still standing there. The divine power that was burning immediately stopped and it even stopped revolving. He couldn’t even move his body.

“Can’t move. I can’t move my body at all?” Jian Wushuang stared.

At that moment, he could clearly feel the difference of power that couldn’t be compensated in any way.

The aloof, white-robed man had merely pointed and Jian Wushuang couldn’t resist at all. That one gesture had bypassed the Dao soldiers easily and hit Jian Wushuang in the hand and it had hit in between Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows.

Jian Wushuang’s body quivered but he wasn’t injured. Then, he noticed that there was a unique mark on his body.

It was as though the mark had belonged to Jian Wushuang originally. It was imprinted on him.

Jian Wushuang was still in shock but the aloof, white-robed man grew illusionary and his body dispersed gradually.

Very soon, the aloof, white-robed man disappeared entirely.

Heaven and earth resumed its tranquility.

Jian Wushuang was still standing in the void. He realized his palms and his back were soaked with sweat.

“The person earlier didn’t intend to kill me?” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

The person really didn’t intend to kill him. He had merely left a unique mark on his body then left.

“I offended him but he didn’t reprimand me, nor talk to me at all. He only left a mark on my body and left?” Jian Wushuang was shocked. “What was he thinking about?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the mark carefully. The mark was really just a mark, but it was a unique method to leave a mark. Regardless of if it was Jian Wushuang or King of Venomous Worms, they couldn’t remove the mark.

Besides that, the mark served no other purpose.

Why did the aloof, white-robed man leave a mark on his body for?

“This person is so strange!” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Strange, really strange.

After he appeared, he didn’t show any anger nor ask Jian Wushuang any question. He didn’t even bother to say anything.

But he didn’t kill Jian Wushuang either. He had only left a mark in Jian Wushuang’s body.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t figure his intention out from such behavior.

“Regardless of his goal, I am alive,” Jian Wushuang was glad.

He had been really worried that the aloof, white-robed man would kill him. If he were to really attack Jian Wushuang, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t have stood a chance to survive even if he played all the cards he had on hand.

“The ancient battlefield has too many secrets and there are countless hidden experts. Even though most of these ancient experts are not at their peak, it is still easy for them to kill me. Just like the person earlier. From the looks of it, I have to be more cautious when I wander around the ancient battlefield,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

After seeing the aloof, white-robed man, Jian Wushuang lost all his interest in Chillywind Valley.

Then, he naturally went to explore other unique places.

Green Fire Palace was the only one who had found the ancient battlefield. However, as they were too weak, there were dozens of unique places that they had yet to explore. Jian Wushuang was going to explore them.
