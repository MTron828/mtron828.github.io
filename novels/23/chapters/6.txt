Chapter 7: Wishful Thinking?

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In front of the Sword Pavilion, in addition to Jian Wushuang and Jian Lin, there were a large number of Sword Pavilion disciples. They all saw what happened and felt confused.

“He forced Jian Lin back? How could this be?”

Peak of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path. Jian Lin is at the Peak of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path. Even though he didn’t use all his strength, no ordinary person could take it. Not to mention Jian Lin was forced back!”

“The Third Step, his cultivation is at the Third Step of the Spirit Path!”

“Has Jian Wushuang gathered Spiritual Power and become a Warrior? Is his cultivation at the Third Step of the Spirit Path?”

It was shocking. All the Sword Pavilion disciples were amazed.

Just ten days ago, Jian Wushuang had not gathered any Spiritual Power. But now, after only ten days had passed, he had not only gathered Spiritual Power, but also cultivated to the Third Step of the Spirit Path.

In ten days, he had gone from becoming a Warrior to reaching the Third Step of the Spirit Path after continuous breakthroughs?

What did that mean?

They did not know that Jian Wushuang cultivated Heavenly Creation Skill and couldn’t be thought of as an ordinary person.

He had a Heaven defying Cultivation Method!

Ten days ago, although he had just gathered the spiritual power, his cultivation speed with Heavenly Creation Skill was faster than ordinary people. What’s more, he had done frantic and desperate cultivation in the Human-level Cultivation Room, where one day’s cultivation for Jian Wushuang was worth dozens of days of cultivation for ordinary people. After ten days, he had had a direct breakthrough from the First Heaven of the Divine Path to the Third Heaven of the Divine Path!

Of course, he had just had the breakthrough and only reached the Third Heaven. The reason Jian Lin thought he had reached the Peak of the Third Step of Spirit Path was that he cultivated Heavenly Creation Skill. So his strength was significantly more than other Warriors at the same level.

“Kid, I admit that I underestimated you. I did not expect that you could gather Spiritual Power. But it doesn’t matter with only the Third Step of the Spirit Path. In front of me, you are still trash,” Jian Lin stared at Jian Wushuang. The Spiritual Power welling up from his palms showed that he was going all out.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes. No matter what he could not withstand an attack from someone who cultivated to the Peak of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path now.

At this moment…

“What are you doing?” There was a low growl, then Elder Hong in his gray robe came out from Sword Pavilion.

“Elder Hong.” Several Sword Pavilion disciples respectfully saluted at once.

Seeing the elder, Jian Lin immediately stopped and changed his look. The formidable Spiritual Power welling up from him was drawn back. At the same time, he saluted, “Elder Hong.”

“Hmm,” Elder Hong glanced at Jian Lin, and snorted, “You are Jian Lin, huh? With cultivation at the Peak of the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path, you are pretty good among disciples at the same level. Relying on a slightly deeper cultivation, you are showing off your strength in front of the Sword Pavilion. Do you really think there is no one who can deal with you in Sword Pavilion?”

“I dare not,” Jian Lin quickly shook his head, with cold sweat falling down instantly.

He pretty much knew that, even if the position of Sword Pavilion had declined markedly in the Sword Marquis Mansion, the Four Great Elders of Sword Pavilion, all of whom were at the Spiritual Sea Realm, were the backbone of the Mansion. Especially Elder Hong, his strength was absolutely in the top three in the current Sword Marquis Mansion. Facing such a strong man, even though he was conceited, he dared not be rude.

“Get out of here now,” Elder Hong scolded.

“OK,” Jian Lin replied immediately. But as he was leaving, he glanced at Jian Wushuang and said with a sneer, “Jian Wushuang, I heard that you went to find Meng’er the day she was appointed as the new Sword Pavilion Master, and boldly threw down a personal challenge for the annual Sword Marquis Token Battle in two months?”

All those around were puzzled at first. This was the first time they were hearing this. They looked at Jian Wushuang.

Two months later, Jian Wushuang would challenge Jian Meng’er?

Was this a joke?

“There are many folks in this world who are foolish and arrogant. But I have never met such a foolish and arrogant person as you. With just the Third Step of the Spirit Path, you are actually thinking of defeating Meng’er who is in the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm? Haha, my laughter is killing me!” Jian Lin left. But his unscrupulous laughter echoed in front of the Sword Pavilion.

Jian Wushuang just stood there, with an apathetic expression. Many people gazed at him with regret in their eyes. Some eyes were even filled with ridicule and disdain, just like Jian Lin’s.

Even Elder Hong was looking at Jian Wushuang with a quiet complex expression.

In two months he is challenging Jian Meng’er?

Was Jian Wushuang going to rely on his cultivation at the Third Step of the Spirit Path?

All the Sword Pavilion disciples thought that was just wishful thinking for Jian Wushuang.

After Jian Lin left, Elder Hong winked at Jian Wushuang. Immediately they went inside the hall of Sword Pavilion.

“Young Pavillion Master, congratulations. You have finally become a real Warrior after four years’ endeavor,” Elder Hong smiled. He had seen everything that had occurred outside the Sword Pavilion just now and had surely seen Jian Lin get knocked back by Jian Wushuang.

“Ah, but it is not enough just to be a Warrior,” Jian Wushuang said in a downcast voice.

Elder Hong looked at Jian Wushuang seriously and asked, “Young Pavillion Master, do you really want to fight with Jian Meng’er at the Sword Marquis Token Battle?”

“Yes, this competition is inevitable,” Jian Wushuang said firmly. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Elder Hong thought it was impossible. “Young Master of the Pavilion, you should know that during a warrior’s cultivation, the breakthrough of each level is much harder. It will also take a very long time. Only two months… As far as I know, in the whole Sword Marquis Mansion, the only one who ever made such great progress in two months was the Pavilion Master, your father!

“When the Pavilion Master was young, in two months he reached the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path from the Second Step of the Spirit Path. He had a direct breakthrough of four Levels, which greatly defied the natural order. The reason the Pavilion Master had such a breakthrough was that, first of all, he had a great gift for cultivation, together with the support of a large number of pills from the Sword Marquis Mansion. The most important thing was that the Pavilion Master spent those two months in the Gladiator Arena and participated in combat with opponents almost every day. Only because of struggling with life and death in the arena, could he progress so fast!

“However, the Pavilion Master only had a breakthrough from the Second Step of the Spirit Path to the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path,” Elder Hong stared at Jian Wushuang.

But that could not sway him from his decision, not even a little.

Of course, he understood what Elder Hong said. It had taken his father two months to break through the Second Step of the Spirit Path and reach the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path, which was incredible. However, what he was going to do was much harder.

“Jian Meng’er is already at the Profound Spiritual Sea Realm. I need to reach at least the level of the Seventh Heaven of the Divine Path. Then by virtue of Heavenly Creation Skill and my swordsmanship, as well as the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill, it is possible for me to defeat her! ”

“And from the Third Heaven of the Divine Path to the Seventh Heaven of the Divine Path, it is same in that they both need to break through four Levels. But it is at least ten times harder than that from the Second Step of the Spirit Path to the Sixth Step of the Spirit Path!”

“But… I am a Defiant Cultivator. Every step I take will be out of the ordinary and in defiance of the natural order!”

“Other people cannot do it. But for me, it is possible!”

Jian Wushuang had made up his mind. His eyes became more determined.

Seeing this, Elder Hong asked, “Do you really want to try?”

“Of course. But I will not just try, I will defeat her in two months.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were grim.

In that case, I will not say anything more. But I have something that may be able to help you.” Elder Hong took out a jade box from his bosom and then opened it. Inside the jade box were two milk-white pills.
