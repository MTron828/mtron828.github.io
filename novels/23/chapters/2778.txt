“Alliance Master Su Han...”

Jue Xin, An Ying, and Lan Junzhu looked at Alliance Master Su Han in amazement but kept a straight face.

“Alliance Master Su Han, your domain oppression methods look extraordinary. I really look forward to feeling the power of this domain oppression methods,” said Blood Thunder King with a smile next to Jian Wushuang.

“Don’t worry, you’ll experience it very soon.” Jian Wushuang smiled while his right hand slowly stretched out.

“Be careful!”

“Alliance Master Su Han’s domain oppression methods are great such that even Peak Grand Ultimate Gods’ strength is suppressed. We have to be vigilant.”

There was a commotion among the Grand Ultimate Gods from Yin Su’er’s faction with all of them waiting intently and preparing to contend with the domain oppression methods Jian Wushuang displayed.

Blood Thunder King and those Grand Ultimate Gods under his command sneered at them while looking forward to Jian Wushuang using his domain oppression methods to suppress all the Grand Ultimate Gods from Yin Su’er’s faction. They were waiting to take advantage of the situation and caused the greatest damage to Yin Su’er’s faction.

Jian Wushuang finally straightened his right arm, but his palm suddenly flipped around.

“Domain Oppression!”

Rumbling...

The Golden Light Domain, Prison of Punishment, Star Armor Domain, and Sword World superimposed as its terrifying power instantly came into effect.

The well-prepared Grand Ultimate Gods from Yin Su’er’s faction were puzzled when Jian Wushuang exercised his domain oppression methods as they did not feel the slightest bit of oppression at all.

On the other hand, Blood Thunder King and those Grand Ultimate God experts under his command felt the oppression instead.

They were sneering at their opponents and waiting for a good show. However, they were the ones who immediately felt the suppression by the four superimposed domain oppression methods. Those Grand Ultimate Gods including Blood Thunder King felt as though a mighty mountain was on top of them. The sixteen of them—which were either Primary-level or High-level Grand Ultimate Gods—felt their overall strength had instantly reduced by about 30 to 40 percent.

Their strength had diminished all of a sudden.

“Alliance Master Su Han, what are you doing?” Blood Thunder King was horrified.

He was looking forward to Jian Wushuang’s domain oppression methods as he and Jian Wushuang were supposed to be in the same camp. However, why were he and his people being suppressed instead?

Jian Wushuang merely smiled coldly when he heard Blood Thunder King’s shriek as his right hand instantly pointed toward Blood Thunder King’s direction.

Buzz!

The power of Space-time Law instantly swept and drifted across.

A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique!

Blood Thunder King alone was being targeted by that method.

“Attack!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with murderous intent.

Those who were already ready to go behind him such as Jue Zin, An Ying, and Lan Junzhu as well as the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet, Silver-armored Corpse Puppet, and two Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets instantly began their attack with the intentions to kill.

Those corpse puppets were refined by Jian Wushuang and he could command them just by using his mind power.

Jue Zin, An Ying, and Lan Junzhu had also been informed by Jian Wushuang beforehand, so they were not surprised to see Jian Wushuang’s behavior. They began killing Blood Thunder King and the others next to them.

Blood Thunder King and the other sixteen Grand Ultimate Gods were still recovering from their shock after encountering the sudden change and betrayal, yet had to face the imminent fierce attacks.

“Sh*t!”

“Sword Alliance, you bastard!”

“The Sword Alliance is our enemy!”

The Grand Ultimate Gods under Blood Thunder King’s command were frightened.

All of them thought the Sword Alliance was an ally recruited by Blood Thunder King which they were quite happy about it. They might be able to wipe out Yin Su’er and Yun Shan’s factions in no time with the Sword Alliance’s help.

However, the situation was reversed to their horror.

The Sword Alliance was not a friend but a foe!

All of a sudden, they were suppressed by the terrifying domain oppression methods without any preparations. At the same time, they were being attacked by Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin and the others.

They were standing so close to the Sword Alliance experts before, therefore many of those Grand Ultimate Gods under Blood Thunder King’s command were unable to resist when Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin made the sudden attack.

Chuck! Chuck! Chuck! Chuck!

Five Grand Ultimate Gods were killed on the spot with three Grand Ultimate Gods severely injured.

In addition, Jian Wushuang targeted Blood Thunder King.

Jian Wushuang used the A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique on Blood Thunder King to freeze the space-time Blood Thunder King was located at. Thereafter, the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet next to Blood Thunder King fired a shot toward Blood Thunder King who was still in a daze and unable to put up a defense.

The Gold-armored Corpse Puppet wielded a large saber which slashed down a horrifying saber-light at Blood Thunder King like a thunderbolt that suddenly appeared on a sunny day.

Blood Thunder King had not recovered from his senses and naturally did not manage to resist the attack. However, a simple jade slip hidden in his sleeves cracked.

An invisible shield immediately appeared in front of Blood Thunder King after the jade slip was broken.

Bang!

The Gold-armored Corpse Puppet’s large saber landed on the shield and produced a loud bang. The shield shook violently and instantly collapsed, but the large saber’s power was greatly weakened.

The remaining power from the blow was very weak as it landed on Blood Thunder King’s divine body after being weakened by the protective armor and could no longer cause any harm toward Blood Thunder King. However, the momentum had sent him flying.

“Oh, he’s not dead?”

Jian Wushuang was a little surprised. It was a shame that he did not manage to kill Blood Thunder King with that blow.

It was definitely a great opportunity to kill Blood Thunder King who was caught off guard and standing so close together. Jian Wushuang worked seamlessly with the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet with him performing the A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique while the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet used its killer move. They should have been able to kill the Blood Thunder King.

However, they never expected Blood Thunder King to have a life-saving method hidden up his sleeves.

The jade slip was a life-saving method. Although it was not sophisticated, it did save his life.

“Fortunately, I have a life-saving method!”

Blood Thunder King had recovered from the frozen space-time and concurrently also noticed the jade slip in his sleeves was broken. He had figured out what just happened.

He knew he had just been through a life-threatening situation.

He then saw five figures were slowly falling downward up in the void ahead of him.

Those five people were his followers who were killed by Jian Wushuang’s Grand Ultimate Gods and corpse puppets.

“Damn it!”

Blood Thunder King looked extremely gloomy with blood-red eyes like two blood-colored thunderbolts as he shot a look at Jian Wushuang.

“Su Han!”
