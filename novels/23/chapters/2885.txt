Chapter 2886: Ultimate Move

——

“This brat, he’s just a Divine Master. How can he be so hard to deal with?” Elder Su’s expression was dark.

“Heavenly Void, Elder Su, create an opportunity for me. I have a move that should be enough to kill him.” Realm Lord Tian Qu said coldly.

Elder Su and Heavenly Void Palace Lord’s expressions changed.

The two of them had seen Realm lord Tian Qu’s most decisive move before.

That move caused them to be extremely wary. However, it was not easy to execute that move. Nevertheless, this Realm Lord Tian Qu had no other choice. Hence he chose to use that move.

“Watch me.”

The eyes of the Heavenly Void Palace Master narrowed as a violet lightning energy suddenly flashed out from his eyes.

He still had four arms, each holding a purple spear tightly. But at this moment, a vast purple shadow suddenly appeared behind him.

This purple shadow looked exactly like Heavenly Void Temple Master, but its size was many times larger.

Terrifying divine power gathered in each of Heavenly Void Temple Master’s four spears.

“13 slaughter divine spears!”

Heavenly Void Temple Master shouted. The four spears in his hand turned into four purple thunderbolts and shot toward Jian Wushuang crazily.

Fast, the four purple thunderbolts were too fast.

Each of the purple thunderbolts contained terrifying power. Any one of them could quickly kill Invincible Divine Masters like Marquis of Three Yin and Black Blood Emperor. However, at this moment, the Heavenly Void Temple Master swung his arm wildly. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

A total of 14 such purple thunderbolts shot toward Jian Wushuang at the same time.

Jian Wushuang was in the Sword Principle World and had channeled the sword essence of Blood Mountain Sword to the maximum. His fighting spirit was overflowing. Seeing the purple thunderbolts shooting toward him, his eyes shone with a bright light.

“Get lost!”

With a low shout, Jian Wushuang suddenly slashed out with his sword.

The Heavenly Void Temple Master had thrust out 13 spears, but Jian Wushuang had only used one sword strike.

However, it was this sword strike that swept through everything and destroyed the purple divine thunderbolts crazily.

Finally… the crackling of the divine thunderbolts continued.

The 13 bolts of purple divine thunder dissipated, and the Heavenly Void Temple Master’s body trembled slightly in the void. Jian Wushuang was also sent flying by the impact of the 13 bolts of purple divine thunder.

At this moment, a suffocating power suddenly came from the void above him.

Jian Wushuang looked up and found that Elder Su had appeared in the void above him at some point in time. His body was suffused with endless golden divine power, and as he held the vast scarlet-gold long staff with both hands… the giant golden long stick, which was already as big as a small mountain, suddenly expanded and turned into a giant pillar.

“Heaven-shaking stick!”

With a low roar, the enormous golden long stick smashed toward Jian Wushuang from the top down.

Rumble! The world trembled.

The world seemed unable to withstand the terrifying power contained in the long golden stick and began to tremble crazily.

The Sword Principle World formed by Jian Wushuang’s Mountain River Map was also on the verge of collapse.

Seeing the towering golden-red long stick coming at him, Jian Wushuang’s expression changed slightly. The supreme sword essence swept over his body. Undercover of the sword essence, the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand seemed to have expanded in size. He also waved his sword and blocked the golden-red long stick.

Bang!

The golden-red long stick smashed into the Blood Mountain Sword. The terrifying power contained in the long stick completely exploded.

Heaven-shaking stick was the most decisive move that this old monster could use.

Moreover, this move was purely a crushing force. The power was too strong.

Jian Wushuang only felt a massive force on the Blood Mountain Sword. In an instant, it was as if Mount Tai was pressing down on him. His body directly sank as if he was about to fall to the ground. Moreover, he could not control his body when he fell.

“World Master Tai Qu, it’s up to you,” Elder Su growled.

The Heaven Void Temple Master also looked at Realm Lord Tian Qu.

Whether it was the 13 slaughtering spears of the Heavenly Void Temple Master or Elder Su’s heaven exploding cudgel, the purpose of their most potent moves was to sweep away the obstacles and create an opportunity for Realm Lord Tian Qu’s most powerful move.

Now that the opportunity had been formed, Jian Wushuang’s body was on the way down. He had almost no ability to react, and Realm Lord Tian Qu’s killer move was ready.

“Jian Yi, die with my son!”

A roar suddenly echoed in the world.

Realm Lord Tian Qu’s body was full of killing intent. As his roar fell, endless and pure black divine power surged out.

This black divine power resulted from Realm Lord Tian Qu combining his divine power with the destructive rule power he had comprehended.

At this moment, the black divine power gathered crazily, and in the blink of an eye, it had formed a giant black beast that was 30,000 meters tall.

The giant black beast did not have a body but only a bloody mouth that seemed to devour the world.

Under the guidance of Realm Lord Tian Qu, the bloody mouth had already swallowed Jian Wushuang, and in the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang was destroyed.

“Destruction, crushing plate!”

Realm Lord Tian Qu’s eyes shone with a bright light.

The destructive power of the bloody mouth was completely unleashed.

Heavenly Void Temple Master and Elder Su stood in the void around the giant black beast. Their eyes flashed with a strange light as they looked at the big black beast in front of them.

Jian Wushuang was in the mouth of the giant black beast. No one knew what had happened inside. Heavenly Void Temple Master and Elder Su could not see it. They could only hear the laughter of divine power coming from the bloody mouth.

However, both the Master of Heavenly Void Temple and Elder Su had absolute confidence in the move of the Realm Lord.

This move was the most decisive move of the Realm Lord, and he did not create it. Instead, it was a powerful secret skill that he had obtained by chance many years ago. The Realm Lord had once used this personal skill in front of everyone. It was the same scene. However, the black beast had swallowed a genuine Immortal Saint.

As a result, the Immortal Saint was swallowed by the black beast and never came out.

In other words, Realm Lord Tian Qu had used this move to kill an Immortal Saint in front of others.

Jian Wushuang was only a Divine Master, so they did not think he could survive the black beast.

The voice of the black beast finally calmed down. Then, the black beast turned into a large amount of black divine power and slowly dissipated in the world.

When all the news was released and the void was revealed again, there was no human figure.
