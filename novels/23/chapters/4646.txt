4647 Half-Ancestor Dao

As time passed, there was no such thing as day or night on the Cangwu Platform. The abundant divine power made this the perfect place for meditation.

As the Dao Field before Lu Ding’s Dao validation and becoming an Ancestor, the rules of the Great Dao contained here were far beyond any place in the Divine Power Universe.

This Cangwu Platform was equivalent to Cosmos God’s Cloud Palace back then.

And listening to Dao in the Cosmos God’s Cloud Palace was a great fortune that could only be encountered by chance. Usually, only the most outstanding and unparalleled geniuses in the universe would have the chance to sit on a futon and listen to the Dao.

This Ancestor-grade Daoist Field, Cangwu Platform, had opened a new door, allowing these one million cultivators to cultivate and comprehend the Dao.

In just a few months, all the cultivators in the Divine Power Universe had recovered from their injuries, but tens of thousands of cultivators who were severely injured had still died.

At the same time, many cultivators broke through the restraints and entered the Supreme realm.

Jian Wushuang woke up not long after. He had thought that he would lose some of his origin divine power, but not only was it not consumed, it was also accompanied by a strange and surging power.

It was not until the descendant of the Phoenix clan vaguely explained the reason that Jian Wushuang realized that the endless life aura in his meridians was because of the divine blood of the ancestral bloodline that Feng Qi had transferred to him.

Shaking his head helplessly, Jian Wushuang was about to leave the formation when Feng Qi appeared in front of him in a red flowing cloud gown.

Feng Qi’s eyes suddenly lit up. She hurriedly went up and used her palm to check.

Jian Wushuang was embarrassed and quickly covered his exposed chest.

“How is that possible? He should have been able to break through that realm,” Feng Qi frowned and muttered.

After tidying up his clothes, Jian Wushuang said, “What are you talking about? You’re so mysterious.”

Feng Qi did not hide anything and said frankly, “When you gave me your blood essence earlier, I vaguely felt that your aura had already reached the critical point of a breakthrough. But why is there no sign of a breakthrough now?”

“Do you think it’s that easy to break through to the Half Ancestor realm? Which Half Ancestor hasn’t been immersed in the Invincible Supreme realm for countless years before they managed to grasp a small opportunity.” Jian Wushuang shook his head and smiled bitterly. “As for me, it has only been 100,000 years since I became an Invincible Supreme. I’m afraid it will take a long time for me to become a Half Ancestor.”

When Feng Qi heard this, she subconsciously pouted and said, “It doesn’t seem that difficult to advance to the Half Ancestor level. I remember that I only took a nap back then, and then I became a Half Ancestor.”

Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded for a moment. Then, he nodded, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. “I’ll try my best.”

Feng Qi said seriously, “You’re different from the others. My intuition has always been accurate. It’s definitely right.”

Looking at the Phoenix Matriarch, who was so determined to believe in him, he felt a lot better.

After saying goodbye to Feng Qi, Jian Wushuang walked slowly on the grassy plain.

Pure divine power filled every inch of space, giving people an indescribable sense of comfort.

Jian Wushuang had already decided that when Old Master’s injuries recovered, he would once again face the Void Universe army led by Void God!

And in this short period of time, the thought that had only appeared in his mind for a moment resurfaced.

“Perhaps I should really try to comprehend that realm?”

Jian Wushuang looked into the distance and saw Lu Ding walking over with a kind smile.

“Shall we go for a walk?”

“Sure.”

The two figures leisurely strolled around the Cangwu Platform, experiencing all kinds of scenery and looking at countless rare and exotic beasts.

In the clouds, the two of them were like banished Immortals in the sky, sitting and watching the strange clouds in the great realm. The mountains and rivers connected the sky and the earth, and the four seasons changed in a flash.

As the wind and clouds changed, Jian Wushuang’s state of mind had already changed.

“When I was young, I only liked to play. All kinds of rare beasts, famous mountains and giant rivers, I never grew tired of them. Later, because of various reasons, I cultivated hard until now. Although my state of mind has changed, my love for fun has never changed.”

As he talked about the past, there was a sense of satisfaction and pride in Lu Ding’s expression. “So I simply moved all the things I used to like to this Cangwu Platform. What you see now is real and has existed before.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Big Brother Lu, your state of mind has already surpassed 99 percent of the people in the world. You are able to maintain your original state of mind as always.”

Lu Ding laughed heartily and looked at Jian Wushuang with a much gentler gaze. “I once thought that I was born by riding on the Heavenly Dao and that I was a rare Heaven’s Favorite in all the realms. But it was not until today that I realized that there is no end to this.”

Jian Wushuang did not speak and waited for the rest.

“This world of the Cangwu Platform that I’ve created is tens of times larger than the Rodu Star Field that my clan used to have. However, it’s like a drop in the ocean when it’s attached to the Spring of Chaos.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“At the same time, I also know how insignificant I am. The peak of my cultivation realm is only the ceiling of the rules of the underworld.”

At this point, Lu Ding paused for a moment before continuing, “Palace Master Wushuang, do you think that Ancestor realm is the true peak?”

Jian Wushuang only felt that the knowledge that existed in his mind was even more confusing.

The vast and mysterious realm in the Land of Sorrows, the strange words Snake God had said in the Polar Sea Star Field, Old Master who had walked out of the Black River, and the Devourers, the mysterious organization… All of these things had increased his understanding of the world.

“If the Ancestor realm isn’t the true peak, then what is above it?” Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and said slowly.

Hearing this, Lu Ding laughed out loud. “I don’t know either.”

Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded and then he shook his head, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. He had really gone in a big circle and returned to the original place.

“But one thing is for sure. If you want to know more, you have to jump out of the rules that bind you.”

Lu Ding smiled. “For example, you should make a breakthrough now.”

“Half Ancestor, huh?” Jian Wushuang murmured, “It’s indeed time.”

Endless divine power started to spread out from his body. Like leaves and vines, it stretched out in the air.

Seeing this, Lu Ding smiled and retreated from this world.

Between the rolling clouds, thousands of scarlet-golden divine beams shot up into the sky.

At this moment, all the cultivators in the Divine Power Universe on the Cangwu Platform looked in shock at the direction of the golden sky.

A Half Ancestor vindicated their Dao, their Dao flowed and their treasure light grew endlessly.

Is this guy really going crazy to save the Divine Power Universe?” Great Void Divine Emperor, who was sitting cross-legged in comprehension, stood up slowly. His gaze was as calm as usual.
