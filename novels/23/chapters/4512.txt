4513 Belated Awareness

Boom!

An endless void energy condensed in Elder Shen Lian’s hand.

His robe fluttered and his eyes were filled with killing intent. A violent force shook the void.

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes. He had just held the hilt of the Tarot Divine Sword, but he seemed to have thought of something. He loosened his five fingers again, turned around, took a step forward, and turned into a flowing light, sweeping into the distance.

“You want to run?”

Elder Shen Lian laughed out of anger. He dispersed the terrifying power in his hand and turned to chase after Jian Wushuang.

“Wushuang! You killed Yan Dan. I don’t care if you go to heaven or hell, I’ll kill you today!” he shouted from behind.

Jian Wushuang did not look back, but he sneered.

Back when he was at the God Refining Sect, he had already thought of killing Elder Shen Lian.

He had not been able to find a suitable opportunity, but now, the opportunity had come!

However, the Land of Gods was a place that stirred up a storm and attracted the attention of all the major forces. If they wanted to kill Elder Shen Lian, it was inevitable that they would reveal some of their strength, which would easily cause trouble.

It was better to lure him out first, leave the Land of Gods, and then kill him with one sword strike!

Whoosh!!!

Jian Wushuang and Elder Shen Lian were very fast. The two of them turned into flowing lights and left the Land of Gods very quickly.

In the empty Land of Gods, only the group from Crimson Whale Gang remained.

“C-Chief, there’s no aura of anyone in the Land of Gods,” a Crimson Whale Gang member said softly.

“Chief, did Lord Bing Ye get killed inside?” another Crimson Whale Gang disciple asked.

Crimson Whale Gang’s Chief Luo Ming did not speak, but a hesitant look appeared on his face.

The strongest person who had entered the Land of Gods before was only at the level of Two Scars, and Lord Bing Ye’s strength was stronger than his. How could he have been killed?

If there was not an accident inside, then there was only one possibility…

Luo Ming raised his head and looked at the place where Jian Wushuang had left.

He could clearly notice that Lord Bing Ye had a strong enmity toward this kid from the God Refining Sect, Wushuang.

With Lord Bing Ye’s power, anyone who could be regarded as an enemy by him must be at least on the same level as him, right?

“Let’s go. Let’s catch up and take a look,” Luo Ming said as his thoughts flickered.

Boom!

The Crimson Whale Gang’s Cosmic Warship suddenly accelerated and chased after the place where Jian Wushuang and Elder Shen Lian disappeared.

…

Whoosh!

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang and Elder Shen Lian flew in the sky one after another.

Jian Wushuang was expressionless and his speed was neither fast nor slow. He did not completely shake off Elder Shen Lian, but he maintained a distance that was just enough to keep up with him as he gradually flew toward a remote part of the universe.

“Damn it!” Elder Shen Lian’s expression was gloomy. His anger had completely overwhelmed his mind.

He did not think about how Jian Wushuang, a mere 8-Star Void Warrior, could kill Yan Dan, who had broken through to the Scar level, nor did he think about why he could not catch up with Jian Wushuang even though he was at the Scar level.

He only had one thought in his mind.

And that was to catch up and kill Jian Wushuang!

After a few hours.

Under the power of the two, they had already crossed several Star Fields and were nearly ten million miles away from the Land of Gods.

The two of them gradually entered a desolate Star Field.

“Let’s do it here!”

Jian Wushuang spread out his void power and found no one. After he found that there was no one there, he could not help but take a deep breath and gradually stopped.

“Hahahaha, Wushuang! Why aren’t you running anymore?”

When Elder Shen Lian saw this, he immediately laughed out loud in excitement.

He thought that Jian Wushuang had used up all his void power and could no longer escape.

“Wushuang, since you can’t run anymore, then prepare to die! I’ll be buried with my son!”

Immediately, Elder Shen Lian’s laughter stopped and was replaced with endless hatred.

The Yan Dan was his life’s work!

“Soul Separation Sickle!!!”

Bang! Bang!

With a flip of his right hand, a black sickle tied together with chains and used as a handle appeared in his hand.

The blade of the sickle was shimmering with black light. Not only was its attack power unusually powerful, but it could also hook out a cultivator’s divine soul and imprison it on the sickle forever, tormenting it day and night. It was the most notorious and peerless weapon in the Void Universe.

As soon as the Soul Separation Sickle appeared, the void was immediately filled with ghostly wails and wolf howls. It was as if countless vengeful souls and malicious ghosts were imprisoned in the sickle and were howling.

Jian Wushuang turned around and held the hilt of the Tarot Divine Sword with his right hand. His expression was cold.

This Elder Shen Lian had a cultivation base of Three Scars, which was equivalent to a High Supreme of the Divine Power Universe.

If Jian Wushuang had not broken through to the Intermediate Supreme realm, it might be difficult for him to deal with this person. However, after he had broken through to Intermediate Supreme, Elder Shen Xiu was just an ant that he could kill with a flip of his hand.

...

“Shen Lian, do you really want to see your son Yan Dan?” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

“What do you think?” Elder Shen Lian sneered and retorted.

He did not want to talk to Jian Wushuang anymore. As he spoke, the Soul Separation Sickle in his hand turned into a black flowing light and shot toward Jian Wushuang!

“Very well, then I’ll do as you wish and send you to accompany him!”

Jian Wushuang nodded and the corners of his mouth suddenly pulled up into a deep and sinister smile.

“Die!”

Bang! Bang!

Jian Wushuang moved.

This movement was like a thunderclap!

“Tarot Sword Manual, second move, Daybreak!”

A golden light suddenly appeared!

...

It was as if the entire world had been torn apart by this golden light, and a thick layer of multicolored light spread out.

The Divine Bell of Fortune, the separation of yin and yang!

This sword had split the yin and yang of heaven and earth!

Clang!

With a crisp sound, the Daybreak sword light that Jian Wushuang had turned into landed on the Soul Separation Sickle.

Instantly, this notorious Soul Separation Sickle only lasted for a breath’s time before it was covered with dense, spider-web like holes.

Bang! Bang!

Then, it was hit by the Sword Qi, and the whole sickle was broken into pieces.

As for Jian Wushuang, he had already passed through Elder Shen Lian’s body like a golden dragon.

Pfff.

Jian Wushuang’s figure appeared behind Elder Shen Lian and the golden light around his body scattered.

A large hole had already appeared in Elder Shen Lian’s chest.

“This… this power…”

Elder Shen Lian turned his head in a daze and looked at Jian Wushuang in shock.

“You’ve hidden your cultivation.”

“No… no, you’re not from our universe!”

Realization dawned on Elder Shen Lian’s face. However, before he could finish his sentence, his aura quickly withered. His entire body dissipated rapidly.

“I hate it!!!”

Under Elder Shen Lian’s extremely unwilling voice, his body, which had been shredded by the Sword Qi, began to disintegrate inch by inch.

Jian Wushuang remained silent and did not answer Elder Shen Lian’s question. Instead, he looked at Elder Shen Lian calmly as his divine body collapsed and dissipated.
