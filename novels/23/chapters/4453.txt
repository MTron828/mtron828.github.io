4458 The Return

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

Streaks of light streaked across the vast starry sky.

Along the way, no one said a word and kept silent.

He had won this battle, but it had been too tragic and moving.

!!

Jian Wushuang was expressionless and also silent. Nine Stars Saint’s desperate gaze before his death kept replaying in his mind.

He was not particularly close to Nine Stars Saint, but he would remember Nine Stars Saint’s help with the disciples of the Nine Stars Holy Land when the Six Forces besieged the Divine Life Palace.

“Void God…”

Jian Wushuang muttered to himself and a murderous intent flashed in his eyes.

…

A moment later.

They had arrived at the base camp outside the outer region battlefield.

Other than Team 6, which was left to patrol the spatial Rift, the Captains of the other teams all brought their team members and stood at the entrance of the main camp to welcome everyone.

It was obvious that they already knew about the war that had broken out on the Offworld Battlefield.

It was the first time Jian Wushuang had seen a member of Team 9.

Everyone walked into the base camp step by step and nodded slightly to the members of Team 8 as a form of greeting.

Jian Wushuang walked at the back. Just as he was about to step into the base camp, he stopped.

“It’s him?”

Jian Wushuang frowned and looked at the second team.

The Captain of the second team was Great Void Divine Emperor, whom he had met once in the Great Void Temple!

“I didn’t expect him to be the Captain of Team 2!”

“Oh? This guy is here too?” Great Void Divine Emperor also saw Jian Wushuang and he raised his eyebrows.

Every once in a while, Cosmos God would transfer a group of Supremes from the universe to the Offworld Battlefield. If he had not seen Jian Wushuang today, he would not have known that Jian Wushuang had come to the Offworld Battlefield.

Standing beside Great Void Divine Emperor was Supreme Bing Ye, who had already recovered from his injuries. He was wearing the Vice-Captain’s white robe. He also saw Jian Wushuang and his body trembled.

“Jian Wushuang! It’s Jian Wushuang!”

Then, he lowered his head, and a hysterical and sick smile appeared on his face.

“Very good! Jian Wushuang, I didn’t expect you to come to the Offworld Battlefield. Hehehe, it’s time for us to settle our scores!”

His chest heaved up and down violently as he laughed wildly, but he did not make a single sound.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes swept across Supreme Bing Ye’s face and the corners of his mouth curled into a cold smile.

Very good, his greatest enemies were all in the Offworld Battlefield! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The hatred between them had long reached the point where they would not rest until one of them was dead. Unless one of them died, this hatred would continue.

Thud!

Jian Wushuang lifted his foot and continued to walk forward.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re really lucky. You survived even when Void God attacked.”

An ear-piercing sound rang in Jian Wushuang’s ears.

Jian Wushuang turned his head and saw Long Qing, the Vice-Captain of Team 3 in a white robe, spreading his hands and speaking with a mocking expression.

Before Jian Wushuang could reply, Long Qing shook his head and said with a smile, “But it’s fine. It seems like the heavens are prepared to let you die in my hands.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang glanced at him and then ignored him. He walked forward step by step.

There was still a lot of time, and he would naturally get rid of these enemies one by one.

He walked into the main palace.

Cosmos God was already seated on the main seat, holding the headless monster and the pearl condensed from the Eight-Part Generals in his hands.

He swept his gaze across everyone’s faces. With a wave of his right hand, a warm-colored radiance was released from Cosmos God’s hand and sprinkled on everyone.

In an instant, the injuries on everyone’s bodies rapidly recovered, and the exhausted divine power in their bodies recovered at a rapid rate.

“We thank you, Cosmos God!”

Immediately, everyone cupped their hands.

“It’s fine! It’s been hard on all of you this time.” Cosmos God nodded.

Following that, Cosmos God waved his right hand once more. The small bead in his hand rose into the air and left his palm.

Whoosh!

The next moment, the headless monster and the Eight-Part Generals’ figures expanded in the wind and stood in the hall.

“Damned old thing!!!”

“Kill!”

Instantly, the headless monster and the Eight-Part Generals’ faces were filled with ferocity, and they were about to shout and kill.

However, with the presence of a Cosmos God, what could they do?

Whoosh.

With an indifferent expression, Cosmos God flicked his finger. Instantly, Immortal radiance shot out from his hand and turned into a cage, trapping the headless monster and the Eight-Part Generals.

...

Within the cage, the headless monster rammed into the cage a few times. After realizing that it was completely unable to shake the cage, it turned to Cosmos God and licked its lips.

“Cosmos God, you kept us here until now because you want to know about Lord Void God, right?”

Cosmos God did not say anything.

The headless monster shook its head and said, “So what if I tell you? It wouldn’t be long before Lord Void God undid the seal and led an army to flatten this universe! At that time, not only will you die, but everyone in the hall will not be able to escape! The billions of living beings in your universe will become our slaves, hahahaha!”

At this point, the headless monster laughed out loud. His face was filled with savagery, and there was no trace of fear.

“You’re looking for death!”

The expression of Cosmos God turned stern. With a flick of his finger, the headless monster’s body began to melt inch by inch. In just a few breaths’ time, its body and spirit were completely destroyed!

Following that, Cosmos God flicked his fingers continuously, and the Eight-Part Generals began to die one by one.

In front of a Cosmos God, be it the headless monster or the Eight-Part Generals, there was no difference. It was just like how Jian Wushuang and the others were faced with the pitch-black arm. They had no power to resist at all.

Bang bang bang!

A series of muffled sounds could be heard. Soon, the Eight-Part Generals were all dead, leaving only the gloomy-faced three-headed snake Wang Liu.

...

Just as Cosmos God was about to kill him, the three-headed snake, Wang Liu, suddenly spoke, “I can tell you about the Void Gods and even the deployment that our universe has for you, but I have a condition.”

Hearing this, Cosmos God frowned and said indifferently, “What condition?”

Upon hearing this, the three-headed snake, Wang Liu, revealed a cruel smile and his green pupils turned.

The next moment, he looked at Jian Wushuang.

“I want to fight with this man. Life or death, it’s up to fate!”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone was shocked.

Whoosh…

Everyone looked at Jian Wushuang.

Cosmos God took a glance at Jian Wushuang before looking back at the three-headed snake, Wang Liu. He shook his head and said, “No, change your condition.”

However, the three-headed snake, Wang Liu, shrugged and shook his head. “That’s a pity. Come, kill me. ”

“You think I won’t?”

Cosmos God snorted coldly when he heard that. Dao light circulated on his fingertips as he was about to kill him.

At this moment.

“Fight me? I agree.”

Jian Wushuang took a step forward and said expressionlessly.
