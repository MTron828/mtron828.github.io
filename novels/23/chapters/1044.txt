Chapter 1045: Black-robed Girl

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Since Xiu Jiu has been enduring for such a long time, there’s no way he’d tell me in just an hour!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold as his resolution grew firmer. “Looks like I have no choice but to kill him!”

“Kill him? Don’t you want to know where your mother is?” Gu King asked.

“I’d put up a fight if I know I stand even the slightest chance but it’s hopeless now,” Jian Wushuang replied solemnly. “I’m not a hotspur. I won’t blindly pursue a goal even knowing it’s hopeless.”

“The mysterious pattern on Jiu Xiu’s skin would be gone after his death. I’m confident I can manage to escape within this hour!”

Once he made up his mind, he immediately set out to kill Jiu Xiu.

Just then…

“Jian Wushuang, hurry up and look what’s in front of you,” Gu King cried.

Jian Wushuang looked up and saw a black dot appearing at the end of his line of sight. The black dot magnified rapidly and appeared before him instantly. It was a sturdy, bear-like, and apathetic man.

“Oh no!”

Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrunk the moment he saw the apathetic man.

“This aura belongs to a Holy Master! Is he from the Ancient Demon Clan?” His expression was grim.

He had been ready to take Jiu Xiu out but now a Celestial Master showed up out of nowhere. Moreover, this Celestial Master was evidently targeting him. He was either from the Ancient Demon Clan or an expert that they invited.

“This is troublesome.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold. The Blood Mountain Sword was already in his hand.

Yet unexpectedly…

“Hm?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He realized that though the bear-like, apathetic man was eyeing him, there was no Killing Intent in the latter’s eyes.

The man was already in front of Jian Wushuang but made no move to attack him. Instead, he bypassed Jian Wushuang and stopped behind him. He then lifted his head and targeted his sharp gaze at Patriarch of Empyrean Glory, who was taking his sweet time in catching up to Jian Wushuang.

Then, the man made his move.

“Boom!”

The man had merely thrown a simple punch but it was enough to set off an explosion that detonated all of the space around them.

Soon an immense black hole emerged which covered the range of thousands of miles out of thin air. The spiral-shaped black hole extended outward in a perfectly straight line.

In the center of that spatial black hole was a thick, solid arm with its hand tightly clenched. It was an incredibly arrogant and unyielding fist.

“This…”

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s expression changed when he saw the punch flying at him. He responded by clapping his large wings, producing a powerful storm with a concentrated force. The storm effortlessly shattered the fist and spatial black hole. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Though he managed to crush the attacks, Patriarch of Empyrean Glory was forced to stop.

“Who are you? How dare you stop me?” he asked, his voice carrying traces of alarm.

The apathetic man remained expressionless as he responded emotionlessly, “I’m here to stop you on my Master’s order!”

“Master?” Patriarch of Empyrean Glory was stunned.

Once the apathetic man made his move, he had shown that he was a genuine Celestial Master.

“What kind of a person will be strong enough to have a Celestial Master call his Master?” thought Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had continued to widen his distance from Patriarch of Empyrean Glory after the apathetic man bypassed him. In the end, he stopped running and turned around in time to see the man stopping Patriarch of Empyrean Glory.

“This man came for me but he’s not here to kill me, but to… help me?” He was stunned.

Reinforcement?

Jian Wushuang never dreamed that he would have reinforcements.

After all, he hadn’t made many friends in the Samsara Continent. He only knew Dragon Wing Governor and Dreamless Dao Master, and he was absolutely certain that these two would have no way of getting him reinforcements on the level of a Holy Master.

But the apathetic man’s action and words…

“Master?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

Who would be the Master of this strong and apathetic man?

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory was so mad, to boot!

“I don’t care who your Master is. This brat killed my son and for that, I must take his life today. Get out of my way. Otherwise…” Patriarch of Empyrean Glory roared.

Before he could finish his sentence, a cold voice came drifting from afar reached his ears. “Otherwise? Otherwise what?”

Both Jian Wushuang and Patriarch of Empyrean Glory immediately turned toward the source of the voice.

They saw dozens of black dots appearing in their vision. These dots rapidly enlarged, soon turning into figures that stood in the Void.

The group of people emanated dangerously strong auras that indicated that they were in the Peak of Rank Three Level. Their leader was unexpectedly a stunning, delicate-looking girl in black.

Despite her frail appearance, the group of Dao Masters stood deferentially behind her. Even the apathetic man who made the first move bowed respectfully to her and cried, “Master!”

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s pupils shrank in shock.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded.

He had never felt this stupefied in his life.

He kept his gaze fixed on the black-robed girl.

The girl also stared at him, her eyes reflecting the fierce joy.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t help crying out, “Fourth Sister?” His emotions began surging wildly.

Fourth Sister?

Few people in this world would merit such an intimate manner of addressing from Jian Wushuang.

In fact, there were only three—the three people that he swore to be good siblings with when he was still a weakling in the Ancient World.

There were four of them in total.

The oldest was Wang Yuan.

The second was Yang Zaixuan.

The third was Jian Wushuang himself.

The fourth… Su Rou!

The young and shy girl whose charm drew everyone to dote on her was also the earliest to leave the Ancient World.

He wasn’t there when she left, hearing about her departure from Wang Yuan and Yang Zaixuan later. He didn’t know where she went, only that she was leaving with a mysterious expert.

When he arrived in the Green Fire World, he guessed that she was also here somewhere.

But he never once thought that it would be here, in the Samsara Continent, that he would meet Fourth Sister again or that she would now be so different.

The young and shy girl back then now possessed a fearsome aura. The dozens of experts that surrounded and protected her also showed her status as an expert.

Su Rou was similarly surprised but she was able to suppress her emotions.

Her eyes turned a little colder as she turned to look at Patriarch of Empyrean Glory. She once again spoke in that icy cold voice of hers.

“Patriarch of Empyrean Glory, if you dare touch even a strand of hair on his head while I’m around, I’ll pluck out all the fur on your bat body!”
