Chapter 2195 Deep Slumber

Emperor Bai made it sound very simple.In reality, even though the Tai Ying Soul Resurrection Formation and spiritual pool were both extremely helpful in the recovery of one’s soul power, it was not easy to set up.

Tai Ying Soul Resurrection Formation originated from the ancient past.

At least ten masters of formation were needed to form this formation. Furthermore, large amounts of resources were needed to keep this formation running.

These resources could come in the forms of special power stones. However, unless the power stone was like that of the Supreme Emperor Stone, a large amount of these special power stones would be needed to keep the formation running. The Sanctuary Alliance could not bear such a cost.

Hence, Emperor Bai commanded around two hundred almighty to stay there at the Wushuang City.

They would provide divine power to keep the TaiYing Soul Resurrection Formation running.

As for the Spiritual Pool, it sounds ordinary.

However, for the spiritual pool to be of use to Jian Wushuang, large amounts of treasures and resources were needed, though the amount was much less than that required to open the Heaven Repairing Palace.

As of the current ability of the Sanctuary Alliance, time was needed to prepare these resources.

The cost was huge and the process was extremely complicated.

No matter as Emperor Bai, nor any other almighties, were unwilling to put in the effort.

The person who needed this was Jian Wushuang!

The man who they owed the most to in this war!

Jian Wushuang had risked it all, even his life, to kill the Blood Emperor.

They would give it their all as long as there was even the slightest of hope for him to recover.

“Besides the TaiYing Soul Resurrection Formation and Spiritual Pool, we should prepare some elixir which helps in the recovery of soul power. However, such elixirs are rare and extremely difficult to make. We need to prepare,” Emperor Bai said.

“I have elixirs which help in the recovery in soul power,” Wang Yuan said.

“Huh? What type of elixir?” Emperor Bai looked at Wang Yuan in surprise.

“Ice Soul Elixir!” Wang Yuan said.

Emperor Bai raised his eyebrows.

Ice Soul Elixir was one of the more powerful elixirs that there was.

This elixir was basically extinct in the Eternal Chaotic World. No one could create it. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

This ordinary looking fat man could create the Ice Soul Elixir?

“How many of the Ice Soul Elixir do you have now?” Emperor Bai asked.

“As of now, I only have three.” Wang Yuan whipped out a small bottle which contained three crystal clear elixir.

After looking at the elixir and smelling its fragrance, Emperor Bai was sure that it was an extremely pure Ice Soul Elixir.

“Three is too little,” Emperor Bai frowned and said.

“Too little?”

“It is alright. As long as I have sufficient materials, I can make more of these,” Wang Yuan said.

“You can make Ice Soul Elixir?” Emperor Bai was in disbelief.

No alchemist master in the Eternal Chaotic World could create the Ice Soul Elixir, but this fat man here could?

“Emperor Bai might not know about this. Wang Yuan is Wushuang’s brother. He has the unique constitution of being the Celestial Elixir. He received an opportunity in the Ancient battlefield around the Green Fire World and mastered many techniques to create elixirs that existed in the ancient past. He indeed possesses incredible skills as an alchemist,” Jian Nan Tien said.

Celestial Elixir was a unique constitution that every alchemist master dreamed of having.

Furthermore, he had received an opportunity from the ancient past.

Emperor Bai looked at Wang Yuan in a different light.

He knew that even though this little fat man was a mere Chaotic Real God, every major faction in the Eternal Chaotic World would have died to have him join their factions. This was the same for the Sanctuary Alliance.

“I will ask my men to prepare the necessary materials to create the Ice Soul Elixir. I will leave the making of the elixir to you. I hope you can make at least one every decade,” Emperor Bai said.

“One every ten years?” Wang Yuan was stunned.

The Ice Soul Elixir was a high grade elixir from the ancient past.

It was not easy even for him. If he needed to make one every ten years…

“Is there a problem?” Emperor Bai asked.

“No problem. For my brother, I will make it happen, even if he needs one every year. At most, starting from today, I will not eat nor drink, just spend all my time making the elixir until Wushuang wakes up,” Wang Yuan said as he shook his head.

Hearing this, Emperor Bai nodded his head slowly.

Soon, the entire Sanctuary Alliance started to work.

They neglected everything else and managed to form the basic structure of the TaiYing Soul Resurrection Formation and Spiritual Pool.

Wang Yuan started to make elixir. This time, he would be spending the most time on one job ever since he was born.

Sanctuary Alliance, Green Fire World and everyone of Jian Wushuang’s family and friends gave it their all to ensure that the formation and the Spiritual Pool were running smoothly.

Everyone was giving their all for Jian Wushuang.

Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang lay peacefully in the middle of the Spiritual pool, in a deep slumber.

…

While Jian Wushuang was in a deep slumber.

Somewhere in the Eternal Chaotic World, in an endless and dark void.

Whoosh!

A beautiful figure was rushing somewhere.

She had a perfect figure. She wore a veil and looked like she was a fairy.

She made her way forward. Suddenly, she stopped in her tracks.

“What?” Leng Ruxue raised her head and looked forward to her beautiful iris.

There stood a man in a white cloak.

The cloak looked like it was made of snow. He was handsome and cold yet arrogant. He stood there in the air, radiating no aura.

It was like he was made of air.

“Emperor Thirteen!”

Leng Ruxue saw the man as she clenched her jaws.

During the battle in the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds, she had not attacked at all. When she had realised that Blood Emperor was about to die, she had turned and escaped immediately.

She was far away from the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World. She had left promptly and no one could catch up to her.

However, not long after she had left the Three Emperors World, Emperor Thirteen had appeared in front of her.
