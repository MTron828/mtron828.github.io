Chapter 499: A Bell

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Bagu Cave Master, behind you...” Holy Ancestor’s voice betrayed his horror.

“Behind me?” Bagu Cave Master was confused. Yet, at the same time, he sensed someone breathing lightly behind him. The person was directly behind him, and he could tell they were within a half meter from him.

“When did this person arrive?”?Bagu Cave Master’s heart began to beat erratically.

He was a supreme expert above the Cloud Realm. In terms of battle strength, he was confident that he could rank in the top 2 among the experts currently here and was just a little weaker than Sword Ancestor.

Therefore, he could not believe that someone had approached him from behind and come so close without being noticed.

“How is this possible?”

Bagu Cave Master was terrified.

As were the Three Ancestors, Blood Bladesman, and Dong Ming King.

They all watched the person standing behind Bagu Cave Master intensely.

The newcomer was a skinny elder, who had chilling and weird eyes. The elder wore a meaningful smile and a ghostly light flashed in his eyes.

“Senior Di Jing.” Jian Wushuang was surprised to see the elder.

He had met the elder in the Puppet Master’s cave mansion earlier.

Di Jing, the seventh War God under the command of Emperor Xiao from Tang of the East!

He had been recognized as a great demon in the Divine Land a thousand years ago.

“Old guy, you are so weak yet so arrogant.” Di Jing spoke slowly and his voice was frigid. The next moment, his hand moved towards Bagu Cave Master’s shoulder.

The hand moved slowly, but there was a strange power behind it.

Bagu Cave Master’s face turned red as cold sweat began rolling down his face. He tried hard to doge Di Jing’s hand, but quickly discovered that he was frozen in place by an unknown force.

Finally, the hand landed on Bagu Cave Master’s shoulder.

It seemed like a casual pat, but Bagu Cave Master felt as if his soul had been shaken out of his body.

He was in a daze and unable to struggle. It took him a while to regain his consciousness, but he was immediately scared, to the point of feeling a chill, and could not help gasping.

It was so terrifying!

The pat did not actually hurt him, but it showed him Di Jing’s formidable power.

He instantly understood that Di Jing could kill him as easily as crushing an ant. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Se-senior.”

Bagu Cave Master finally spoke, and the way he addressed the elder amazed all the surrounding experts.

“Senior?” Di Jing smiled ironically. “Just now, you were so arrogant and said that the boy asked a coward for help, didn’t you?”

“Sorry, sorry.” Bagu Cave Master shook his head.

“Don’t be scared. After all, it was not me who he asked for help,” Di Jing put on a smile.

Bagu Cave Master was relieved, but quickly, he heard Di Jing add, “In fact, he asked my young master for help.”

Bagu Cave Master’s eyes were wide with shock.

He reckoned that Di Jing’s young master had to be more powerful and terrifying than Di Jing, but he just called such a person a coward.

“Old guy, you also said that if the boy would not tell only you the location of Sword Ancestor’s cave mansion, you would kill him and anyone related to him, so you’re going to kill me and my young master? I’m his acquaintance and my young master is his friend.” Di Jing’s voice became cold.

Bagu Cave Master swallowed hard and his heart was trembling in fear. He regretted saying those words so much that he wanted to beat himself.

“Hump, I used to be so bad-tempered in the past that I would not have hesitated to kill you,” Di Jing continued, “But you’re in luck because my master told me not to kill anyone for a thousand years.”

“So, I will spare your life this time, but there will be a punishment.”

Having said that, Di Jing struck Bagu Cave Master with a palm before the master could react.

Bagu Cave Master was unable to struggle and could only watch as the hand landed on his head, at which point he felt a strange power enter his body.

To the horror of everyone, the master’s body started to shrink visibly. In an instant, his body had become as small as a baby, but the change did not stop there.

Finally, under everyone’s eyes, Bagu Cave Master transformed from a human being into a bell.

Yes, a bell.

Di Jing held the bell in his hand while he waved at in a direction that seemed to be empty. Suddenly, a greenish-black figure came rushing to him.

The figure was a huge spirit beast, more than three meters tall, with greenish-black scales all over its body. The beast had a dragons head, but its body was shaped like a lion, except that it had six feet.

“What kind of spirit beast is that?”

Seeing the beast, even those knowledgeable super experts could not help being confused.

They had never seen such a beast before, and they could tell it was extremely powerful.

“I feel pressured by this beast.”

“What a terrifying beast! I’ve been to Ancient World and a dozen plane worlds, but I have never seen such a strange one.”

“The important point is that its master is more powerful!”

The Three Ancestors, Blood Bladesman, Dong Ming King, and the others all looked at Di Jing in horror.

In their eyes, Di Jing was the real monster because he turned a human being into a bell.

“There’s no way Di Jing is from the Ancient World!”

“Maybe he came from that place.”

“Yes, he must have...”

Those experts had made guesses about Di Jing’s background, which only increased their fear.

Di Jing shook the bell with a smile on his face, “This transforming skill, invented by Witch Qiyun, is really useless in fighting, but there’s no better method for punishing some juniors.”

After saying this, Di Jing tied the bell to the beast’s neck.
