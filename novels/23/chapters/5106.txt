Chapter 5110 ¬†Bloody Battle in the Great Desolate Wilderness (1)

The young samanera, Hu Qing, spoke with a gentle, smiling expression. His eyes filled with kindness like a clear spring, pure to the extreme.

"Saving a virtuous person's life is also a form of cultivation for us, a great act of virtue," Jian Wushuang said with a slightly furrowed brow, then thanked them solemnly.

Hu Qing smiled again and said, "You don't need to thank me. If you must thank someone, thank my several masters. It was their combined efforts that saved you."

He nodded gratefully, then, realizing something, he asked, "Are you from the Heaven-Reaching Buddhist Realm?"

"How did you know..." Hu Qing widened his eyes, looking at him in disbelief.

But just as he was about to say more, a Monk turned around, his expression serious, and scolded, "That's enough, Hu Qing, do not speak further!"

Hu Qing was startled and quickly nodded, making a hushing gesture.

Only after the Monk turned away did he speak in a low voice, "I can't say too much; my masters are very strict with me."

Jian Wushuang nodded, then moved away from Hu Qing's frail back. Re√™ad latest ùíèovùíÜls at nùíêùíêv/e/l/biùíè(.)com

He looked around and quickly recognized the place, his heart sinking.

"Have you all reached the border?!"

With these words, all the leading Monks stopped in their tracks, staring at Jian Wushuang like angry Vajrapanis, seemingly ready to act at any moment.

But Jian Wushuang paid no attention to their stares and shouted urgently, "Hurry up and leave, if you don't leave now, it will be too late. There's something going on at the border!"

The Grandmaster furrowed his brow tightly, his gaze fixed on Jian Wushuang, as if trying to discern the truth in his words.

And just at that moment, a colossal figure, tens of millions of feet tall, with a murderous intent that could obliterate the void, quietly approached the edge of the border barrier.

In those crimson, nearly fanatical and paranoid eyes, filled with boundless anger, they glared at the group of Monks.

Jian Wushuang was the first to spot the presence of the armored figure and urgently shouted, "Hurry, he's coming!"

But it was already too late!

The killing intent, capable of obliterating the void, swept in an instant, and the colossal body of the armored figure descended fiercely.

A massive shattered sword tore through the void, ruthlessly descending!

The group of Monks also sensed something in an instant and acted without hesitation.

Brilliant to the extreme, the Buddhist light, accompanied by their Yan power, at that moment completely blossomed with endless radiance, forming a barrier to resist that sword strike.

The sword tore through the void, carrying boundless killing intent as it fell heavily.

Buzz!!!

The dark bloodstained sword struck the barrier, and the Grandmaster's expression changed drastically, then he spat out divine blood directly.

The situation of the other five Monks was no better; they all spewed divine blood and their vitality instantly withered.

And the Buddhist light barrier also shattered in an instant.

"Master!" Hu Qing shouted in alarm.

Jian Wushuang gritted his teeth, released more than ten strands of his Yan power, wrapped around the waists of the group of Monks, and forcefully pulled them out of the range of the shattered sword.

Boom!!!

The road of Immortal bones instantly cracked with millions of feet of fissures, and the ancient Immortal bones turned to dust.

Under the swirling dust, the group of Monks who had barely escaped the danger had pale faces, their eyes filled with disbelief.

Jian Wushuang breathed slightly, "Hurry, don't stop, go as far as you can!"

None of the Monks spoke; instead, they looked at their composed Grandmaster.

Then, he spoke, having already made a decision, "No, we can't retreat even a step! We came here on a mission, and we cannot retreat even a step!"

Jian Wushuang was momentarily stunned and couldn't find words to reply.

Long before, he had sensed that these Monks were all incredibly formidable. They were all Grand Yan Immortals, except the young samanera.

A formidable group of beings, any one of them alone was enough to bring about the destruction of countless Heavenly Regions.

But there was an even more terrifying presence than them, the armored figure who had already reached the realm of the Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal!

He hailed from the Ancient Era, slumbering until now, awakening with boundless murderous intent. His existence was beyond imagination.

This was fundamentally an incredibly uneven battle.

Facing a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, the six Monks seemed to court death!

"Do you understand? He's a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal!" Jian Wushuang furrowed his brow as he cautioned them.

"Even if he's Nine Revolutions, we can only move forward, not retreat!" Grandmaster spoke in a deep voice, his gaze sweeping over the other Monk leaders. "Don't forget how many of our brothers we lost to escape the Great Desolate Wilderness. How can we retreat now?!"

All the Monks nodded slightly, facing a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal who had emerged from the Ancient Era, they showed no intention of backing down.

"Have you all gone mad? Do you know what Nine Revolutions represents?" Jian Wushuang could not believe what he was seeing. They were facing certain death, so why were they seeking it?

At this moment, Hu Qing, who had been silent all along, seemed to have made a decision. With a resolute gaze, he moved forward.

But before he could take more than a couple of steps, Jian Wushuang grabbed him by the collar and pulled him back. "Are you also going to throw your life away?!"

Hu Qing, his face red, argued vehemently, "Kind sir, please let me go. This is a decision I made alongside my masters, and I will not change it!"

Jian Wushuang was exasperated. "Your masters are heading towards certain death, and you're not trying to stop them but are instead willing to die with them? What kind of foolish decision is this?!"

Hu Qing, still red-faced, continued to defend his stance. "We are not going to die. The Great Desolate Wilderness is so terrifying, yet we have come this far. How can we fall at the border of the Great Si Region?"

Jian Wushuang's expression turned solemn. "Let me tell you, do you know the gap in perception between them? It's like an unbridgeable chasm; there's no way to make up for it!"

He paused and then said earnestly, "I don't care about these Monks. Since you saved me, I can't just watch you all go to your deaths. I would love to save everyone, but if I can only save one, so be it!"

Hu Qing opened his mouth slightly, and for some reason, at this moment, the determination in his heart began to waver.

This was the first doubt he had harbored in his 30 million years of enlightenment.
