Chapter 1681: Jian Wushuang and Soaring Heaven King Palace

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Real God Zi Ye died long ago. I killed him. However, he was pretty good. Before he died, he cornered me into a desperate situation and the space that I was in was sealed off from the outside world entirely. I couldn’t send any message for you to come and rescue me but I could rely on my own capabilities. However, I am lucky enough to be able to survive and escape from a desperate situation alive,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Is that so?” Hall Master Yuan creased his eyebrows.

He knew Jian Wushuang’s character well. If even Jian Wushuang had said it was a desperate situation, the encounter must be beyond imagination.

“Regardless, it’s great that you manage to escape. I, and all experts from Lineage of Star, can finally let out a breath of relief,” Hall Master Yuan smiled, “Oh yeah, where are you exactly? Let me send the experts from Lineage of Star over immediately to escort you back.”

“Escort?” Jian Wushuang refused, “There’s no need. I can come back on my own.”

“There’s no need? Jian Wushuang, I’m afraid you do not know what kind of situation you are in now,” Hall Master Yuan smiled faintly.

“Why?” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but ask.

“A hundred years ago, when you were after Real God Zi Ye in the core region, it spread across wildfire and it stirred a hubbub. Many higher-ups in Soaring Heaven King Palace were notified, especially when you and Real God Zi Ye disappeared, Soaring Heaven King Palace was furious too. They immediately sent many experts to the Eighth Lair to search for you and Real God Zi Ye. They continued to do that for a hundred years and they never stopped. On the contrary, Soaring Heaven King Palace sent more and more experts. They even paid a great price to hire some top Chaotic Real Gods.”

“Their intentions are, firstly, they had a string of hope that Real God Zi Ye might not have been dead. Secondly….”

“Secondly, to kill me?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“I’m glad you know that. From the hunt back then, Real God Zi Ye should be dead from the desperate situation. However, although you were lost, you were most likely not dead. Soaring Heaven King Palace has been barbaric all this while. You continuously killed two of their Chaotic Real Gods, why would they let you off the hook?” Hall Master Yuan smirked coldly.

“Hence, it’s best that you find a place to hide for now and wait until the experts from Lineage of Star arrive. Over the years, we of Lineage of Star have also sent many experts to the Eighth Lair to look for you. Although not as many as Soaring Heaven King Palace, as long as they are with you, it shouldn’t be that easy for Soaring Heaven King Palace to kill you.”

“I see,” Jian Wushuang smiled. He understood what Hall Master Yuan meant but he replied with a smile, “Hall Master Yuan, you don’t have to go through the trouble. I can return on my own.”

“Jian Wushuang, you…” Hall Master Yuan was shocked.

“Hall Master Yuan, I have something that I have yet to tell you. During the time when I was in a desperate situation, I broke through and became an Eternal Real God,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Broke through?” Hall Master Yuan was surprised.

He knew that it didn’t take long for Jian Wushuang to breakthrough from Universe God to Void Real God. It was at most a few hundred years.

In such a short period, he broke through from being aVoid Real God to become an Eternal Real God?!

How did he progress so quickly?

“Jian Wushuang, are you really confident?” Hall Master Yuan was uncertain.

“Of course, the current me is not someone who could be dealt with so easily,” Jian Wushuang said confidently.

“If so, alright then. However, if you were to fight with the experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace, I would still let the surrounding experts from Lineage of Star move in your direction,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Sure,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

After texting with Hall Master Yuan, Jian Wushuang let out a breath. He suddenly looked at the end of the boundless dark void.

“Soaring Heaven King Palace, I hoped that you’d be wiser. Otherwise…”

There was boundless chill soaring in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

…

In the boundless, dark void, there was cold aura.

In a dark land, there were over twenty Star Demons gathered. Suddenly, there was a silver flowing light that plunged into the Star Demons like a bolt of lightning. Then, a massacre took place.

Over twenty Star Demons were wiped out by the silver flowing light in an instant.

The silver flowing like dispersed and revealed a cold-looking elder in silver armor.

There was dim light in the cold-looking elder’s eyes. He had a smile plastered across his face but his smile was malicious.

“Shi Gu, you are pretty carefree. You have the intention to kill these Star Demons,” a red-robed figure appeared next to the cold-looking elder from nowhere. The red-robed figure belonged to a handsome young man. The two of them were top Chaotic Real Gods.

“Hehe, we have been searching for more than a hundred years but we have never seen Real God Zi Ye and Jian Wushuang. I reckon that both of them already met death together. It would be a waste of time if we continued to search for them. I might as well spend some time on hunting Star Demons. The demon cores are good,” the cold-looking elder said.

“Humph, don’t forget that Soaring Heaven King Palace hired you at a great price. It’s not right for you to hunt Star Demons,’ the red-robed handsome man’s voice was cold.

“Hehe, don’t worry. Only hunting a few Star Demons won’t interrupt our main goal,” the elder said.

The red-robed handsome man couldn’t say anything more.

Just then…

“Mm?” The cold-looking elder’s face suddenly grew solemn, “Someone’s here.”

The red-robed handsome man immediately noticed and his eyes looked to the void afar at the first instant.

There was a figure plunging over slowly.

He looked handsome and extremely young. He was in crimson robe and there was a sword on his back. There was no power but he let out the aura of an expert at all times.

The originally carefree cold-looking elder and the red-robed handsome man saw the incomer and their eyes dilated in shock.

“This outfit, this appearance…”

“It’s Jian Wushuang! It’s him!”

“Hall Master, Hall Master, I found Jian Wushuang. He’s alive. He is near me…”

The red-robed handsome man immediately exclaimed in surprise. At the same time, he instantly sent a message to Soaring Heaven King Palace.

“We finally found him and happened to be found by us,” the cold-looking elder looked delighted.

“Let’s go!” The red-robed handsome man’s eyes shimmered with joy.

At the very next moment, the two figures plunged out and instantly appeared in the void before Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang who was traveling forward could feel the two of them approaching and he immediately stopped his steps and looked up.

“So fast?”

Jian Wushuang smirked and formed a malicious smile.

“Jian Wushuang, I finally found you!”

The red-robed handsome man and the cold-looking elder glared at Jian Wushuang and they eyes boiled with rage.
