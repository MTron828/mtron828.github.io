Chapter 54: Haunting like a Ghost

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“You’ll see, even though Yin Min boasts immense strength, there is a large number of Tianhuan Sect disciples at the level of Profound Spiritual Sea Realm and Initial Realm, as well as five disciples at Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm. This kind of battle will definitely make them suffer,” the stout man said gloatingly. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

But only a short while later they saw Jian Wushuang kill four of the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples swiftly and cruelly, while the remaining Tianhuan Sect disciples fled.

The four of them were stunned.

“It’s impossible!”

“Unbelievable! That Swordsman, how could he be so strong?”

“I can’t believe that he killed four Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm disciples in such a short time. How could that happen?”

The four of them felt it was impossible. Meanwhile, they recalled the words they heard in Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace. It was about Dongfang Yu defeating Jian Wushuang in only three moves.

“Today we personally witnessed Swordsman’s strength. How was it possible that he couldn’t resist Dongfang Yu? You must be kidding me. I would rather believe that Dongfang Yu was defeated by him in three moves,” roared the stout man.

How could his incredible strength be overcome by Dongfang Yu in three moves?

That was ridiculous!

“It is a relief that we didn’t have a real conflict with them, or…” The stout man spoke in a relaxing tone. He counted himself fortunate to have never turned against Yin Min, even when she took Interspatial Ring away from him. He felt terrified when he thought of Jian Wushuang’s immense power.

“Go! Be quick!” the stout man roared. “We should keep away from these three people until the mission is finished. All in all, we used them just now, and they might hold a grudge against us. I’m afraid that they will fight against us next time.”

“Go! Hurry up!”

The others nodded and intended to escape in panic.

“Hey, do you see that?” said the woman in purple.

The strong man turned his head at once. Suddenly his expression became weird. “It’s them?”

“It’s Dongfang Yu and his followers. They arrived just now and met Swordsman just in time.”

The four were just about ready to leave, but at this moment their steps suddenly stopped.

On the corridor, Jian Wushuang and his companions also noticed Dongfang Yu and his followers.

“It’s Dongfang Yu.” Yin Min and Ling Tianhao glanced at Jian Wushuang with queer complexions.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and smiled slightly but said nothing.

“Dongfang Yu, you are like a ghost, constantly haunting us,” Yin Min said in a cold voice and cast a glance towards Dongfang Yu.

“Yin Min, I’m surprised that the two trash following you are still alive. Lucky guys.” Dongfang Yu appeared in front of them, speaking with an arrogant voice, “Let’s get to the point. Yin Min, since you guys have been in the Tianhuan Sect for a while now, I bet you have an Interspatial Ring, right?”

“Interspatial Ring?” Yin Min said with a sneer. Then she stretched out her right hand as a light purple ring shined dazzlingly on her fourth finger, “Here it is. If you want it, come and take it.”

At the sight of the Interspatial Ring on Yin Min’s hand, the eyes of the five people behind Dongfang Yu brightened and a flash of heat appeared in their eyes.

“Oh, you really do have one. But only one ring.” Dongfang Yu sneered at her and turned his head to his five followers. Then he said, “Let’s go.”

The people following Dongfang Yu hesitated, but eventually the left with him. However, Dongfang Yu glanced at Jian Wushuang and Ling Tianhao as he left and said in a low voice, “You two trash are very lucky to have Yin Min as your pillar. But there are only ten Interspatial Rings. Even I only managed to get one of them. How dare you expect to get them?”

Dongfang Yu left once he finished speaking.

“What a contemptuous look! But he would never think that our Swordsman has the second Interspatial Ring,” Ling Tianhao said before pursing his lips.

“I’m surprised he didn’t bother us. That was my fault. I should have given the ring to you, Haozi (Mouse). If Dongfang Yu knew an Interspatial Ring was in your hands, he would definitely try to take it from you without hesitation.”

She was definitely hoping to see Dongfang Yu try to take the ring just now. If he had started a fight, Jian Wushuang would have instantly given him a lesson. But Dongfang Yu had no desire to snatch the Interspatial Ring when he saw that it was in her possession.

Things would totally change if the Interspatial Ring was Ling Tianhao’s.

“Haozi (Mouse), the second Interspatial Ring, it’s yours.” Jian Wushuang gave the ring to Ling Tianhao.

“Swordsman, what happened to you?” Ling Tianhao looked at Jian Wushuang in astonishment, instead of accepting the ring.

“I need you two to do me a favor.” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“How can we help you?” Yin Min also turned to face him.

“See this attic?” Jian Wushuang stared at the attic beside him and said with a smile, “I want to cultivate alone in this attic with no interruptions, so I need you two to safeguard me.”

“Cultivate?”

“You want to cultivate now?”

Yin Min and Ling Tianhao both felt astonished.

“Did you have a breakthrough?” Yin Min asked spontaneously.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang said and nodded.

“Really?” Yin Min and Ling Tianhao were both surprised.

They believed the fighting capacity of Jian Wushuang was already incredible among people in the Spiritual Sea Realm. If he made a breakthrough, he would probably reach the Gold Core.

Primordial Gold Core, a level they hoped to reach someday.

“I need some time to cultivate, but I don’t know how long I will need. Maybe our mission will finish before I’m done with my cultivation. So the second Interspatial Ring naturally belongs to you Haozi (Mouse). After all, it’s your last chance to attempt the Golden-dragon Guard mission. If you fail, you will never be able to become a Golden-dragon Guard for the rest of your life. But it’s not the same for me,” Jian Wushuang said while smiling.

“I see,” Ling Tianhao understood, so he nodded his head with a smile and said, “thanks a lot. You can count on us to guard this area. We won’t let anyone disturb you. ”

“Thanks,” said Jian Wushuang. Then he smiled and went straight into the attic. Yin Min and Ling Tianhao stood guard in front of the attic.

The stout man and his companions witnessed it all because they were still near the courtyard.

“What is Swordsman doing? Why did he go into the attic?”

“Did he suddenly comprehend something? Is he going to make a breakthrough?”

“Will he reach the Gold Core?”

Their complexions became uneasy. The strength of Jian Wushuang was already so terrifying. What kind of level would he reach after he made a breakthrough?

“Don’t mind what he does. From now on, if we meet the three of them, we turn round immediately,” the stout man said and left with the others in a hurry.
