Chapter 1433: Ancient Moon Island

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Almost all the bandits were made up of Universe Gods and few were Real Gods.

After all, Real Gods enjoyed a high status so they don’t need to be bandits.

Under this circumstance, Ancient Moon Island, which was home to five Universe Gods in the Third Heaven, was already a power in the universe. That was why they could occupy a whole floating island.

But now, Jian Wushuang had intruded into the island, so the bandits were naturally very angry.

“Who are you?”

The middle-aged man with a beard stared at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang did not answer but took out a token and his deep voice sounded all over the Ancient Moon Island.

“Universe Zhu Xin, 60,000 years ago, you were a guard in the Green Sea City. Three-hundred years after that, you accompanied The Duke of the Green Sea City to explore, but because you coveted the treasure of the duke, you joined the bandits, killed the rest thirty one Universe Gods, and fled here!”

“Today, on behalf of the Lineage of Star and the Green Sea City, I will give you the death penalty and carry it out immediately!”

As Jian Wushuang was speaking, he stared at a man in black in the crowd. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He was Universe Zhu Xin, who Jian Wushuang had come for.

“Sir, did you hear that? This guy comes for you and announces your death sentence. Should he execute it immediately? A middle-aged man in the crowd laughed ironically.

Universe Zhu Xin laughed too, “He doesn’t know what he is talking about. An ignorant, proud guy who brings himself trouble.”

The bandits beside them all laughed.

They might fear a Real God.

But Jian Wushuang was obviously only a Universe God in the Third Heaven.

So, what did they have to fear?

“Boy, don’t you understand? It’s the ancient moon island here, a paradise for us bandits. It doesn’t work here, whether you represent the Green Sea Island or the Lineage of Star. And you, only a Universe God in the Third Heaven dare to come here alone and sentence me to death? It’s a joke. You’d better think about whether you can survive here on the island or not.” The middle-aged man laughed wildly.

“I only come for Universe Zhu Xin. You can continue to be bandits and do whatever you want, but, if you don’t, all the bandits here will die!” Jian Wushuang said to the middle-age man aggressively.

Jian Wushuang didn’t like the bandits wandering in the endless void. After all, he had almost died in the hands of these bandits several times when he first went to the ten cultivation sanctuaries. Now, if these bandits dared to stand in the way, he would not hesitate to kill them.

“Well, we all have to die? It’s a joke. Do you think you’re a real God, or the strongest talent in your world? Even a strong man on the Universe God ranking list dares not say so in front of us on my ancient moon island.” The middle-aged man with a beard snorted.

“Don’t talk nonsense to this kid. Go ahead and kill him!” Next to the middle-aged man, a Universe God in the Third Heaven got impatient and started to attack Jian Wushuang.

With his action, a large number of bandits directly rushed to Jian Wushuang in an instant.

In a moment, Jian Wushuang’s soul power burst out.

Bang!

With a piercing, hoarse sound, Jian Wushuang generated a scarlet, blood-colored phoenix, which comprised of his soul power, and appeared in the heaven.

This red phoenix was enormous. Once it formed, it spread its wings and plunged out with great power.

When approaching the bandits, the Power Germs of the Phoenix feathers turned into dozens of flashes of scarlet light. The flashes of light were so fast and went directly into the body of the bandits, who could not resist them at all.

Without any sign, these bandits who had just been rushing crazily to Jian Wushuang, were blocked by a mysterious power.

The next moment, a large number of bandits all fell directly to the ground, like raindrops, without any sound.

Under the attack of Jian Wushuang, only nine bandits out of a 366-member group survived.

These nine people were all Universe Gods in the Third Heaven with great consciousness skills, three of which were even Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven.

At that moment, the nine survivors were shocked.

“Consciousness attack!”

“A powerful consciousness attack!”

They didn’t look down at Jian Wushuang any more.

And Jian Wushuang remained calm.

More than three hundred bandits were all killed by a man out of the Universe God ranking list? For Jian Wushuang, who was good at consciousness attacks, it was easy.

In the Eternal Chaotic World, consciousness was known to be able to kill countless enemies.

Because consciousness attacks could cover a large area at one time, and there was no way to block it.

Talents extremely good at consciousness attack could kill all living creatures in a whole territory!

And Jian Wushuang, after his God Test, had greatly enhanced his power.

With his great power, now he could easily deal with a group of Universe Gods in the Second or Third Heaven with the Crimson Phoenix in the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack.

Now there were still nine enemies.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang took out his Blood Mountain Sword, preparing for the next attack.
