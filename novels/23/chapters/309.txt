“Domain?”

Shocked, Jian Wushuang stared at the Origin Domain that surrounded him. Using his will, he made the Domain start to rapidly shrink, then suddenly expand. Finally, he made it fade away as he turned over his hand.

“It really is Domain! I mastered it!”

“But how could this be possible?”

Jian Wushuang couldn’t believe that he really did it.

He was quite excellent at comprehending the Origin, but there was still a gap separating him and the Origin Domain. According to his thoughts, it would take him at least one year to master it.

But now, inexplicably, he reached the Domain realm without any effort in comprehending it. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Not only had he comprehend the Origin, he also had a large improvement in his cultivation.

“Exceptional Yang Void Realm!”

While clenching his hands, he could feel a surge of power from his improved cultivation, even though he was injured and could not use it at this moment.

He made it to the Exceptional Yang Void Realm from the Profound Yang Void Realm.

He had only recently made it to the Profound Yang Void Realm, and at the moment he exited the room, he was definitely still in the Profound Yang Void Realm.

In only an instant, he had become much stronger.

“It had to be the melody! Yes, the melody!”

Jian Wushuang looked at Leng Rushuang with a serious face.

He finally realized that it was the music that had helped him progress so much in such a short time.

That music had such an incredible effect.

“Who is she really? “

His eyes were fixed on Leng Rushuang, but Jian Wushuang was not overjoyed by his progress. On the contrary, he felt an extreme horror that he had never felt before, a horror that almost felt like it would make his heard burst.

It was so terrifying!

She enhanced his strength so much, in a short while, with her music. What kind of method was this?

How frightening was the person who played this melody?

Jian Wushuang even thought that his adventures in the Ancestor’s Land was nothing when compared with listening to this music.

“Haha, Big Brother Wushuang, how do you feel now?” Leng Ruxue, who was standing next to him, looked at Jian Wushuang with a grin and said, “There is nothing more precious than the music my sister plays.”

“Nothing more precious?” Jian Wushuang secretly nodded.

It was indeed precious! At least, Jian Wushuang had never heard of anyone who could enhance others’ power by playing an instrument.

Leng Rushuang put away the Chinese zither, then stood up and walked towards Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang felt a bit timid as he watched Leng Rushuang walk towards him.

It was because she was frighteningly strong!

The only thing he knew about her was from the introduction on the Bloodmoon List, which said that she was unfathomably strong with a mysterious background.

Jian Wushuang had no idea of her strength until just now when he personally experienced it.

It was far more than just frightening.

She was unimaginably strong.

“You saved my younger sister before, and I saved you this time. We’re even. You’ll have a month to recover from your injuries here before you have to leave,” said Leng Rushuang, shooting him a glance before going back to the room.

“Unbelievable!?I never thought that sister would allow you to stay here for a month,” Leng Ruxue oddly said.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

He felt that even though Leng Rushuang was still indifferent to him, she was not holding herself aloft anymore.

“Big Brother Wushuang, please stay here and recover over next month at ease. You can even listen to my sister’s music when you’re free. Others could never get such a chance!” Leng Ruxue said and smiled.

Jian Wushuang agreed with her.

It was hard for him to walk now, since he was badly injured, let alone leave here by himself.

Moreover, he didn’t intend to leave now.

He was so curious about the melody Leng Rushuang had played.

The next day, Jian Wushuang had recovered a little bit. So, during the morning, he listened to Leng Rushuang play her Chinese zither again.

The melody was rising and falling as if there was magic power in it.

Though it was a new song, the moment he heard the sound, Jian Wushuang immediately found himself settling into a peaceful state that he had never felt before, and he could see the Origin surrounding him more clearly, comprehend it more efficiently.

Even with only Sword Soul, he could comprehend the Origin at an amazing speed. Now, with help from the music as well, he was able to do it 100 times faster than before.

100 times faster!

What did this mean?

If he could continue comprehending like this, he would progress 100 times faster!

It was unbelievable!

More than that, he also gained Spiritual Power faster here, with the help, than he did outside.

“What a great opportunity! A chance like this is as important and helpful as the Ancestor’s Land!”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes were glittering.?“But I only have one month, so I should not waste a single day.”

After learning about the benefits of the music, Jian Wushuang did not miss any chance to listen to Leng Rushuang play. Sometimes, he even picked a piece of bamboo, using it like a sword, and practiced his sword skill while listening to the music.

Leng Rushuang played the Chinese zither every day, and Jian Wushuang would listen to her every time.

While she played, he listened or practiced his sword skills.

From the beginning to the end, neither of them ever talked to each other.

In a flash, one month had passed.

Under the crooked tree, as the white-clothed girl suddenly stopped playing the Chinese zither, the melody that resounded through the bamboos slowly died away. Jian Wushuang, who had been practicing his swordsmanship in front of the girl, stopped as well.

“One month has passed. It’s time for you to leave,” The white-clothed girl said while looking at Jian Wushuang coldly.

“Time to leave?”?Jian Wushuang sighed and was a bit reluctant to leave.

He had benefited a lot from the music, progressing incredibly and steadily during the past month. If possible, he really wanted to stay longer.

But he could not.

“I’ve made great progress during the past month, so I should be satisfied,”?Jian Wushuang thought. Then he looked at Leng Rushuang and said, “Thanks so much for the past month.”

It was his heartfelt appreciation.

Leng Rushuang had indeed helped him so much during the past month.
