“Jian Wushuang… is he going to be defeated?”VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Ruler Hao Jin and the others looked up at Jian Wushuang, who was trembling in the void and continuously being sent flying by Supreme Bing Ye, and their hearts turned cold.

The others were also silent, their expressions complicated.

After a long time, they sighed and said, “Jian Wushuang is indeed powerful, and each of his divine techniques can be called a unique skill of the universe. However, it’s a pity that he has cultivated for too short a time. His cultivation foundation is far inferior to Supreme Bing Ye’s.”

“I’m sure that if Jian Wushuang were to cultivate for another ten million years, perhaps Jian Wushuang can easily defeat Supreme Bing Ye.”

Jian Wushuang did not have much time left.

Countless people looked at each other, their hearts silent.

Jian Wushuang’s defeat was a foregone conclusion.

The disciples of the great void divine Hall looked at the 100,000-feet-tall Supreme Bing Ye and were all excited. They waved their fists and shouted, “Master Bing Ye is unbeatable!”

“Jian Wushuang is just an ant! How would he dare to compete with Master Bing Ye?”

“He’s just a weakling! Is he trying to show-off?”

In the starry sky of the great void, Supreme Bing Ye’s expression was cold, as if he was a God who controlled life and death. He was about to sentence Jian Wushuang to death.

At this moment, even the races in the universe who were watching the battle through the Xuanguang Mirror shook their heads and stood up, ready to recall the emissaries who had sent gifts to the Divine Life Palace.

Jian Wushuang was dead for sure.

This scene played out in every corner of the universe at the same time.

Until…

“Tarot Sword Manual, fifth move, Tarot!”

As soon as Jian Wushuang finished speaking, the entire universe and starry sky rumbled!

It was not just the space where Jian Wushuang and Supreme Bing Ye had fought, but the entire universe!

Whoosh.

The sky began to tear and the wind suddenly blew in all directions. With Jian Wushuang as the center, an aura spread out for thousands of feet.

There were countless people watching the battle in the distance. All the cultivators who had entered the path of swordsmanship, whether they had their swords hanging on their waists or lying quietly in their Interspatial Rings, were shocked.

At this moment, they all let out a loud and clear sound!

Countless sword Qi shot up to the Nine Heavens!

It was as if he was welcoming the ancient Sword God who was about to descend to the world!

Stepping into the void, Jian Wushuang’s aura changed little by little.

His aura had become unfamiliar, sharp, and domineering!

“This…”

Supreme Bing Ye raised his huge ice crystal sword and was just about to slash down when he stopped and frowned.

Jian Wushuang’s appearance had not changed. Jian Wushuang was standing in front of him, but he was still in the elementary Supreme realm.

However, for some reason, Jian Wushuang’s body suddenly emitted an aura that made him feel frightened!

“He’s not Jian Wushuang!” An outrageous thought rose in Supreme Bing Ye’s mind as he shouted, “Stop him!”

Although he did not know what had happened to Jian Wushuang, he could vaguely feel that Jian Wushuang was in extreme danger!

“Go to hell!” Supreme Bing Ye sneered and the huge ice crystal sword in his hand slashed toward Jian Wushuang like a collapsing mountain!

Swish!!

The speed of this sword was extremely fast!

Jian Wushuang was smiling like an idiot. He closed his eyes tightly and waited for the sword to land.

Seeing this, the disciples of the Great Void Temple burst into laughter.

“Hahaha, I thought Jian Wushuang had some big move up his sleeve. It turns out that he’s just waiting for death.”

“How pretentious!”

Even Supreme Bing Ye, who had been slightly nervous, relaxed.

Just as the sword was about to land on Jian Wushuang’s head…

Boom!

Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes!

Two earth-shaking divine lights burst out from his eyes!

Countless immortal radiance swirled up as if it was welcoming the arrival of the sovereigns of heaven and earth. Countless starlight surged from all directions and enveloped Jian Wushuang’s divine body in a brilliant starlight. He was full of divinity.

In the distance, the countless divine swords shrieked and trembled madly. Even the sword owners lost their sense of connection with their swords, and were unable to recall them.

“What is this?!”

Under the shocked and dazed eyes of countless people, Jian Wushuang slowly opened his mouth. A low, hoarse, but extremely sharp voice came out of Jian Wushuang’s mouth.

“I am Tarot!”

Thump!

The Heavenly Divine Gate suddenly opened and a golden light beam fell from the sky. On Jian Wushuang’s back, it formed an illusionary image that wore a green robe, walking on a sword, holding a gourd, and drinking the entire world!

The huge ice crystal sword that was slashing down was shattered instantly!

“What? How did this happen?”

Supreme Bing Ye’s expression was dazed.

He was very familiar with this figure!

Who else could it be but Supreme Tarot?

300 chaos cycles ago, Supreme Tarot had swept through the entire universe as a Supreme cultivator. He had been undefeated in 10,000 battles and had suppressed the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

He was simply invincible!

Supreme Bing Ye, had also been a Top Supreme realm cultivator in the past and had entered the Dao with the sword.

At that time, he was testing his Sword Dao. He used many mighty swordsmen as stepping stones to integrate his own sword principle.

At that time, Supreme Tarot was like the sun in the sky, so how could he let him go?

He had challenged Tarot to a battle at the peak of the universe, but he had been utterly defeated in that battle.

All it took was a single sword strike!

Supreme Bing Ye had been defeated!

From then on, Supreme Tarot had become a nightmare for Supreme Bing Ye.

The reason why he had such a strong killing intent towards Jian Wushuang was because of this.

“How is that possible? What’s going on?”

Supreme Bing Ye stared at Jian Wushuang and growled continuously.

The aura coming from Jian Wushuang almost suffocated him and made him tremble. He could not compare to Jian Wushuang at all!

In the distance, more people were frozen as if they had been struck by lightning. Their minds were filled with thoughts and stormy waves!

“Supreme Tarot! It’s the aura of Supreme Tarot!”

“Not bad! I was fortunate enough to have met Supreme Tarot once before he died, and I’m absolutely certain that this is his aura!”

A veteran powerhouse took a deep breath and said in a serious tone.

There was also an old friend of Supreme Tarot, who said with tears streaming down his face, “Fellow Daoist Tarot, we parted ways 300 chaos cycles ago, separating life from death. I thought that we would never meet again in this life. I didn’t think that we would meet again here.”

Countless people sighed.

However, even more people were puzzled. What was going on?

Only Jian Wushuang knew the answer.

Above the Nine Heavens.

Jian Wushuang was expressionless as he looked down at Supreme Bing Ye and said coldly, “Who’s the ant now?”

A powerful aura and pressure descended upon Supreme Bing Ye, causing him to gradually kneel and prostrate himself on the ground.

“No! Supreme Tarot is already dead! You can’t be Supremacy Tarot! I don’t believe it!”

Supreme Bing Ye clenched his fists tightly and gritted his teeth.

The next moment!

“Jian Wushuang! Even if you are Supreme Tarot, I will still kill you today, let alone the fact that you are not Tarot!”

Roar!

There was a crazed look in Supreme Bing Ye’s eyes as he stood up from the pressure of the sword.

Then, he smacked the void with his right hand and jumped up to kill Jian Wushuang!

“Divine Technique, Destruction!!!”
