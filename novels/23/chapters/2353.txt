Chapter 2354: Punisher God

Qian Yuan didn’t know the Samsara that Jian Wushuang had cast encompassed a unique reincarnation and cycle.

It could convert all matter to its primitive state.

He had created this move in his previous life. Now, with extensive advancement in the Reincarnation Rules of Order, this move had also grown exponentially more frightening.

“I still couldn’t take him down when I teamed up with junior brother Xiang Yi? And I even got injured by him?” Qian Yuan’s expression darkened. “Everyone, kill him together!”

“Together?”

Hearing this, the surrounding Lin Mansion experts couldn’t believe their ears.

Even the four Divine Demon Realm experts from Golden Cauldron Sect were shocked for a moment. However, they recovered quickly and reacted.

“Together!”

Four of them exchanged glances before charging towards Jian Wushuang while ignoring the disdainful gazes that others were throwing at them.

The six men that came from Golden Cauldron Sect were in fact in the same team and had just completed a mission in a perilous land.

Although there were only two Second Grade Divine Demons among the six of them, the other four weren’t weak either. At the very least, the other four could be considered experts among Third Grade Divine Demons. Two of them had even reached the pinnacle of the Third Grade Divine Demons. Now that four of them had struck together, the battle strength they could release could even bring huge threat to a Second Grade Divine Demon!

“Six Chaotic Divine Demons are teaming up against a teenager that isn’t even twenty years old? Golden Cauldron Sect, do you no longer care how others see you guys?” Lin Tiefeng berated.

“How would others see us? Tsk!” Xiang Zong replied with a scoff. “No matter where you go in this world, it’s always the strongest who rule. Who cares about how others look at you?”

Lin Tiefeng was speechless.

Although the experts of the Golden Cauldron Sect had gotten out of the way, Xiang Zong and the burly old man from the Xiang Family were still standing there.

Lin Tiefeng and the rest couldn’t have helped even if they wanted to.

However, Jian Wushuang didn’t seem flustered despite seeing another four Divine Demon Realm experts joining in.

“As I said earlier, you guy should have come for me at the same time since the beginning. If you did, it wouldn’t be as troublesome as now!” Jian Wushuang sneered.

As he spoke, a boundless divine power started sweeping through his body.

This divine power was golden in color. As they gathered in huge amounts, a God Statue shadow of over a thousand feet was formed in the blink of an eye.

The God Statue shadow that appeared behind Jian Wushuang was blurry but extremely majestic.

“One of the Five Great Secret Skills of the Seven Star Black Sect, Punisher God. I have only mastered the first tier and can now form a God Statue shadow of a thousand feet. I wonder how the thousand feet tall God Statue shadow will enhance my strength?”

Carrying a little anticipation, Jian Wushuang struck.

Weng!

His figure flickered with the application of Spacetime Rules of Order, making him appear extremely creepy.

Before him, Qian Yuan manipulated his sabre constantly. Sabre light with scorching flames slashed down at Jian Wushuang relentlessly. From afar, Xiang Yi also propelled the Hong Jun Divine Rod and smashed frenziedly toward Jian Wushuang. However, Jian Wushuang just needed a slight dodge to avoid all these attacks.

“His instantaneous speed seems to have gotten even quicker?” Qian Yuan was astounded.

When Jian Wushuang successfully avoided the attacks from the two of them, he rushed towards the approaching quartet of Divine Demon Realm experts immediately. In the blink of an eye, he got right in front of the four Divine Demon Realm experts.

“Be careful!” Qian Yuan shouted to remind the four Divine Demon Realm experts.

The four Divine Demons from the Golden Cauldron Sect had also witnessed the strength displayed by Jian Wushuang previously. Naturally, they wouldn’t dare to be careless.

However, they had absolute confidence in themselves.

All four of them would be considered extremely strong amongst Third Grade Divine Demons. Moreover, they were familiar with one another and cooperated well. When the four of them teamed up, even an ordinary Second Grade Divine Demon would avoid them. They truly weren’t afraid of Jian Wushuang.

“Kill him!”

“Brat, die!”

“You are too full of yourself!”

Four Divine Demon Realm experts struck one after another.

One waved his long whip that coiled around Jian Wushuang like a huge python.

One thrust out a spear ferociously, wanting to pierce Jian Wushuang’s entire body.

One threw out a palm strike. With vast divine power gathering in his palm, this strike could shock heaven and earth.

The last person was using a dagger. His movements were elusive and he was clearly looking for an opportunity to deal a fatal blow to Jian Wushuang.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

He bolted ahead and left two spacetime shadows behind.

The attacks from the four Divine Demon Realm experts descended but went through the two spacetime shadows without hitting Jian Wushuang, or even the edge of his clothes, at all.

At this very moment...

Weng!

A brilliant sword light illuminated the area.

That brilliant sword light was mesmerizing and intoxicating.

The moment it appeared, even the space was affected as ripples reverberated through it.

The surrounding space-time seemed to have come to a halt as well.

Spacetime Sword Principle, Snow Cleave!

Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft!

That brilliant sword light zoomed past and the four Divine Demon Realm experts from the Golden Cauldron Sect were shocked.

The eyes of two of them dimmed as they fell to the ground helplessly.

Although the other two could barely remain standing in the air, they spewed a mouthful of blood and their expressions paled drastically. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Impossible!” Behind Jian Wushuang, the approaching Qian Yuan and Xiang Yi were flabbergasted.

“How could he be so strong?”

Those from the Lin Mansion were equally dumbfounded.

In a single strike, he had killed two and severely injured another two Divine Demon Realm experts.

What was this power?

What kind of strength did he possess?

“This is indeed worthy of being one of the Five Great Secret Skills of the Seven Star Black Sect. Although I have only mastered the first tier and can only form a God Statue shadow of a thousand feet, the enhancement to my strength is so massive. Based on my estimation, both the intensity of my power, speed and many other aspects have doubled!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

Twice as strong as before!

For Divine Demon Realm experts, a 10% to 20% increase in strength would already be considered outrageous.

Having a 100% increase would have drastic changes to Jian Wushuang’s strength.

“This is just the first tier. Once I have mastered the third tier and form a God Statue shadow of a hundred thousand feet, I can also use various other attacking means of Punisher God like Punisher’s Hell and Punisher God Annihilation. At that time, my battle strength will be even greater!!” Jian Wushuang was looking forward to it.

What he didn’t know was that it was impossible for him to form a one hundred thousand feet tall God Statue shadow within a short period.

After getting a sense of his own strength, Jian Wushuang looked towards the two Golden Cauldron Sect’s experts that were severely injured.

“Die!”

Killing intent gleamed in the eyes of Jian Wushuang as he darted forward.

“Retreat! Retreat!!” The two Divine Demon Realm experts from the Golden Cauldron Sect shouted out in horror.
