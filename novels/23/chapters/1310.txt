Chapter 1311: Interpreting

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“No restrictions except having to come back to save Scarlet Island once a crisis happens?”

Without much hesitation, Jian Wushuang nodded, “Yes!”

The only condition was absolutely acceptable to him.

Even if he did not join the Lineage of Scarlet, he would definitely offer a hand whenever the island met with a crisis.

After all, it was the first place that welcomed him after he entered the Eternal Chaotic World, and the island master was very kind to him.

“That’s the deal.” Scarlet Island Master smiled.

Tian Ying Universe God who was near the master took out a command token to give to Jian Wushuang, “Drip a drop of blood to it and you will become a member of the Lineage of Scarlet.”

Jian Wushuang glanced at the command token with his soul power, nodded, and dripped a drop of blood into it.

Scarlet Island Master smiled, “Welcome. From now on, just call me Brother He Yuan, as we are both from Lineage of Scarlet.”

“Brother He Yuan?” Hearing the real name of Scarlet Island Master for the first time, Jian Wushuang felt a little bit awkward.

“Now, I will take you to the cultivating place of Scarlet Kingdom.”

Scarlet Island Master took Jian Wushuang to the core place of the Lineage of Scarlet.

The place was over ten thousand miles below the Scarlet City.

Right in this place sat a tremendous palace, hidden by an advanced forbidden token. Ordinary Gods, including Universe Gods in the Third Heaven, could not find it.

Jian Wushuang followed Scarlet Island Master and Tian Ying Universe God, and came to a wide square in the palace.

In the middle of the square, there was a stone monument with ancient words written on it.

Each of these words was magical and grand.

“The stone monument was left by the founder of our Lineage of Scarlet. The powerful descendants all depend on them to interpret the secret skills of Scarlet Kingdom.” Scarlet Island Master said.

Jian Wushuang looked at the stone monument in front of him, feeling amazed.

He knew how extraordinary it was. The material, for example, was unknown by Jian Wushuang.

“Interesting.”

The King of Venomous Worms in the body of Jian Wushuang said, “This stone monument is made up of Ancient Magic Crystals, which are precious in the Eternal Chaotic World. Such a huge piece of Ancient Magic Crystal must be invaluable. And the founder of Lineage of Scarlet used it just to record the secret skills! It is too luxurious even though the lineage is powerful!”

“It feels like the founder of the Lineage of Scarlet had very extraordinary power.”

“On what level?” Jian Wushuang asked. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“I can’t tell from just an ancient magic crystal monument. But no matter how powerful it was, the founder lagged far behind the founder of the Lineage of Stars.” The King of Venomous Worms said.

“Doubtless.” Jian Wushuang replied.

After all, the Lineage of Stars was among the top ones in the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries.

If the founder of the Lineage of Scarlet had been powerful enough to be compared with the founder of the Lineage of Stars, the Lineage of Scarlet wouldn’t only stay in a small universe like this.

“The secret skills of the Scarlet Kingdom are divided into four parts. Even the simplest part is very difficult to interpret. I spent three thousand years in front of the monument to figure out the first part and I still can’t interpret the second one.”

“You are more talented than me but your time is limited. So you should seize the time and try to interpret the first part. It is enough to finish the first part. As for the next three parts, you can work on finishing them until you pass your God Test.” Scarlet Island Master said.

“OK.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Then we will leave you alone to stay here to interpret. Remember to keep track of the time.” Scarlet Island Master reminded Jian Wushuang again and left with Tian Jie Universe God.

After they left, Jian Wushuang immediately sat down. His soul power instantly covered the entire monument, and he could clearly see what was hidden within the monument.

Then he began to meticulously interpret it.

After only three days, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes.

“Well? What happened?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Why did I spend just three days to interpret the first part while Brother He Yuan used three thousand years?”

Jian Wushuang was confused.

When he heard about what Scarlet Island Master said, he felt that it was not easy to interpret the secret skill of Scarlet Kingdom.

But unexpectedly, he just took three days.

With another two days, he could even interpret all the four parts of the skills.

“How come?” Jian Wushuang was still puzzled.

At this time, the King of Venomous Worms gave him an answer. “Scarlet Island Master said it was difficult based on his own intelligence and capability. First of all, he is far less intelligent to you. More importantly, it is because you have ignited the Soul Fire!”

“This stone is made of Ancient Magic Crystal, which makes obstacles in people’s consciousness. Therefore, people covering this monument with consciousness find it hard to see all the hidden things. I guess the founder of the Lineage of Stars deliberately set this obstacle in order to test the intelligence of his descendants. Although you don’t have enough magic power, you are doing Inverse Cultivation and you have ignited the Soul Fire, which covers this monument and offsets the obstacles for you. So it is much easier for you to interpret.”

“In this way, you easily outpaced Scarlet Island Master.”

Jian Wushuang fully understood and felt amazed by his power.

The powerful Inverse Cultivation facilitated the Soul Power and ignited the Soul Fire, contributing to incomparable advantages for Jian Wushuang.

“The next three secret skills won’t take long for me to finish, I think.” Jian Wushuang smiled and then continued to interpret.
