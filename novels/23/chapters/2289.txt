“Xuan Yi!”

The black-haired man on the golden Dragon Turtle looked at Xuan Yi with mixed feelings.

Indeed, Xuan Yan hated Xuan Yi to the core.

Seven Star Black Sect had met its doom mainly due to Xuan Yi.

But at the same time, they were best friends, blood-forged brothers!

Xuan Yan’s heart felt heavy at the sight of Xuan Yi’s willpower collapsing.

“I have no regrets after sending that lad into the reincarnation passage.” Xuan Yi smiled with no regard to his own thinning body. “I’ve made all the preparations. All that’s left is for the boy to understand it, it’s time for me to leave,” Xuan Yi said as he looked at Xuan Yan.

“Xuan Yan, my brother, goodbye.”

Xuan Yi finally disappeared without a trace.

The heaven-shaking super-existence was finally gone!

Xuan Yan was heavy at heart and said nothing as Xuan Yi gradually disappeared. After some time, he heaved a long sigh.

“Forget it, he’s gone, no reason to hold any more grudges. Xuan Yi, so long.”

After sighing, Xuan Yan tore through space and left.

The other Seven Star Black Sect experts all sighed.

Soon the Seven Star Black Sect experts, such as Emperor Thirteen and One-Star Man, left.

The restrictions on the earth were too great that if they stayed for any longer, the environment would have a detrimental impact on their health. Now that Xuan Yi’s plan had succeeded, they would continue to sleep.

They would all spend their remaining time in slumber, Emperor Thirteen included.

In a moment, the experts at Heaven’s Horizon all left, all except for the Eternal Chaotic World experts headed by Emperor Bai.

Emperor Bai, Abysmal Saint Master, and many more fell quiet.

After some time, Ancestor Tian Chen asked, “Is it over?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Yes, it is. Those that desired to return have done so, those who did not have gone back to sleep. The Eternal Chaotic World will not see any Ancient Era experts for a long time. Peace is finally restored.”

The Great Emperors around looked at each other but were not happy at all.

Peace had indeed been restored at Eternal Chaotic World, but after the battle, the Great Emperors were full of awe and longing for the Absolute Beginning Divine World instead.

Unfortunately, that would not be possible now.

They lived in a restricted land that protected them from Absolute Beginning Divine World experts.

But similarly, they could never leave.

“Sword Emperor should have survived right?” Abysmal Saint Master frowned.

“He did,” Emperor Bai nodded. “He had died, but his master Xuan Yi took great efforts to revert spacetime and revived his soul, and sent it down the reincarnation tunnel. If I am not wrong, he sent him to the reincarnation tunnel towards Absolute Beginning Divine World!”

They had all guessed it.

Xuan Yi’s intention was to use the tunnel to send Jian Wushuang to the Absolute Beginning Divine World.

But with the lands completely under the control of those Absolute Beginning Divine World experts, he could not rely on the link passage to send him towards the Absolute Beginning Divine World. He used all means to send him there via the reincarnation passage instead.

“Turning back time, and sending him into the reincarnation passage, how powerful was that man?”

“Is that what the Absolute Beginning Divine World experts can do?”

“Amazing.”

“We may be Great Emperors of this earth, admired by many, but we are no more than frogs trapped in a well.”

“Our trapped vision will never let us see the vast lands of the Absolute Beginning Divine World. I wonder when we can go there.”

The Great Emperors all longed for the place.

But they could not go to it.

Unless the expert Xuan Yi revived and built another reincarnation passage for them, it was impossible.

“Listen up.”

Emperor Bai’s gaze turned solemn. “Nothing about today can be divulged to the outside world. Absolute Beginning Divine World must never be mentioned within the Eternal Chaotic World.”

The Great Emperors flinched but nodded.

They understood Emperor Bai’s purpose.

Absolute Beginning Divine World was too vast, even the Great Emperors had no chance to interact with it, much less the normal cultivators.

It was better to hide it and let the Eternal Chaotic World cultivators live in bliss and ignorance.

“As for Sword Emperor...” Emperor Bai paused, and said, “You can inform his parents and his close friends about what really happened to Sword Emperor, but publicly, Sword Emperor died during the battle between the Sanctuary Alliance and Ancient Era experts, understood?”

“Understood,” the Great Emperors nodded once again.

“Although the Sword Emperor is no longer here, his achievements and sacrifices for the Sanctuary Alliance and the Eternal Chaotic World can never be surpassed. No one will ever lay their hands on his hometown Green Fire World and Lineage of Stars. Anyone who does that will be the enemy of the Sanctuary Alliance, an enemy of me!” Emperor Bai’s voice was stern as he stared at those Great Emperors.

Those words were for the Great Emperors in front of him.

The Green Fire World and Lineage of Stars were powerful by themselves – no one would have dared touch it without the help of a Great Emperor. Emperor Bai had to deter the Great Emperors from thinking otherwise.

The Great Emperors looked at each other. They dared not think otherwise with Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang’s remaining influence around.

“Let’s go.”

The Great Emperors soon left.

Word of the Sword Emperor collapsing spread like wildfire across the Eternal Chaotic World.

Countless cultivators sighed for the loss of such a genius, a legend.

Once one has collapsed, no matter how glorious his past was he would eventually be forgotten and become no more than a legend.

Sanctuary Alliance Great Emperors knew that he was not dead.

Perhaps one day Jian Wushuang would return.

But that would be many, many years later.
