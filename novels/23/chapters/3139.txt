Chapter 3140: Sweep

——

“Did they all attack? Humph, well done!”

Jian Wushuang was not angry but happy when he saw the experts of the Purple Cloud Pavilion attacking.

Buzz, buzz, a majestic star power burst out from Jian Wushuang’s body.

The seven-star secret skill was fully activated.

The third volume of the seven-star secret skill was enough to increase Jian Wushuang’s realm by half a realm.

He had already reached the limit of a rank four True Saint. The increase of half a realm instantly made Jian Wushuang reach the level of a rank five True Saint!

Then, a large amount of golden divine power began to gather behind him, and a huge Golden Emperor Phantom condensed behind him.

The difference was that this Golden Emperor Phantom had increased from 300,000 feet to 500,000 feet!

In the past 90 years, Jian Wushuang had not only improved his principles and swordsmanship, but also his secret skills.

For example, he had improved a lot in the divine punishment realm.

The 500,000-feet-tall Golden Emperor Phantom looked down at everything in the world and shocked everyone.

At the same time, a layer of black-gold armor appeared on Jian Wushuang’s body.

Seven-star secret skill, punishment divine realm expert, nine brilliant star armor heavenly armor chapter were all used!

The Supreme Sword Essence in the Blood Mountain Sword also unscrupulously swept out under Jian Wushuang’s guidance.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang’s strength had risen to the peak of his own!

“Before, my divine power was only comparable to the peak of rank six. But now, with the use of my secret skill, my divine power has increased by many times. I have a feeling that my strength now definitely surpasses that of an ordinary primary rank seven True Saint!” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, as he felt the surge of strength in his body, his eyes shone brightly.

In the next moment, Jian Wushuang’s terrifying power completely erupted.

“Samsara Sword Formation, kill!”

Jian Wushuang pointed with his big hand. Under the dim light surrounding the giant dragon, it seemed as if a dragon’s roar was heard. Then, the dim light expanded and shot toward the short elder in front of him, Deacon Qi.

Deacon Qi’s body was still covered with a large number of pale purple thunderbolts. When he saw the dim light shooting toward him, he waved the big axe in his hand again, trying to hack the Samsara Sword Formation back like before.

In the blink of an eye, the axe and the dark light collided again.

In Deacon Qi’s opinion, the result of the same move would definitely be the same.

However, in fact, at the moment when the two collided…

“What?”

Deacon Qi’s pupils suddenly shrank. He had already felt the unbelievable force coming from the dark light.

That force was completely beyond what he could bear.

Clang!

With a loud sound, the ax in Deacon Qi’s hand was sent flying, but the dim light continued to attack Deacon Qi’s divine body.

“Puff!”

Deacon Qi spat out a mouthful of blood and retreated immediately.

“Level-seven?” Deacon Qi regained his balance and stared at Jian Wushuang with fear in his eyes.

After severely injuring Deacon Qi in the first collision, Jian Wushuang willed the dark light to burst out with terrifying power again and directly shot toward the experts of the Purple Cloud Pavilion.

“Be careful!”

The expressions of the rank six True Saints of the Purple Cloud Pavilion changed drastically.

The dark light arrived in front of a True Saint at the peak of rank six. The True Saint at the peak of rank six subconsciously waved the huge sword in his hand. The huge sword was thick and powerful, but it could withstand the dark light head-on.

Peng!

The huge sword was sent flying, and this peak-type rank six True Saint suffered heavy injuries as well. He retreated explosively.

Following that, the dark light shot toward another person.

Peng! Peng! Peng!

There were three consecutive loud bangs, and the first two were loud. The two peak-type rank six True Saints still had some strength, and they were able to obstruct the dark light, preventing it from destroying their divine bodies, they could recover after expending some divine power.

However, Long Lu, who was only at the initial-type rank six True Saint Realm, was in trouble.

The terrifying might of the light was not something Long Lu could withstand. With just a single attack, Long Lu’s divine body was instantly destroyed.

Silence!

The entire world fell silent.

Everyone watched on in shock.

Even the rank six experts of the Purple Cloud Pavilion were stunned.

Everyone was stunned.

“How…how is this possible?”

“Four rank six Peak True Saints and an initial rank six True Saint joined hands to kill a rank four True Saint, but they were defeated and defeated by that rank four True Saint?”

“Is he…is he really a rank four True Saint? Why do I feel like he’s a rank seven True Saint?”

A thought appeared in the minds of all the experts present.

They had thought that Jian Wushuang would be in big trouble when they saw the experts of Purple Cloud Pavilion attacking at the same time. However, they had not expected that the situation would be completely reversed in just a blink of an eye.

Four rank six Peak True Saints and one initial rank six True Saint were defeated by Jian Wushuang in just a blink of an eye! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Yes, it was a sweep!

The four rank six Peak True Saints were all severely injured.

The initial-stage rank six True Saint, Long Lu, had his divine body collapsed on the spot.

If this was not a sweep, what was it?

Under everyone’s shocked gazes, Jian Wushuang remained standing in the void with a cold smile on his face.

“The gap between a rank six True Saint and a rank seven True Saint is ridiculous. After using a few secret skills, the power of my divine power has already surpassed most of the initial-stage rank seven True Saints and is even close to that of an advanced-stage rank seven True Saint. My strength is so much stronger. If I use the eighth reincarnation sword formation, you long spear, how can these sixth-level true saints withstand it?” Jian Wushuang sneered in his heart, however, his eyes turned cold, and a killing intent slowly rose from his body.

“You can’t kill me, but I can kill you!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold. The dark light surrounding the giant dragon shook slightly and burst out again, and Jian Wushuang moved at the same time.

The moment his body moved, Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

“Crash!” The raging flames, mixed with endless white ice fog, produced endless power of ice and fire. The two natural opposing powers of ice and fire merged perfectly at this moment, the power of ice and fire swept wildly in all directions. In the blink of an eye, it completely covered the surrounding void, forming a huge world of ice and fire.

The world of ice and fire was centered around Jian Wushuang. With a thought from Jian Wushuang, the world of ice and fire crazily pressed down on the Purple Pavilion experts in front of him.

Under the control of Jian Wushuang’s divine power, which was equivalent to that of a rank seven True Saint, the ice and fire swimming dragon ruler instantly burst out with terrifying power.
