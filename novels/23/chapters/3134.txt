Chapter 3135: The Mission

——

“It seems that I have to find the lord to exchange for some divine power fruits,” Jian Wushuang murmured, stood up, and walked out of the secret skill.

The Mystic Realm Jian Wushuang was in was in the first sky, unlike in the Endless Territory, where there were many experts.

In the hall, there were many members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance gathered. Some wore the special clothes of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and masks, but some did not. The entire hall was very lively.

Jian Wushuang did not wear a mask. He just changed his original appearance slightly. He had always used this appearance. When he walked out of the room and came to the hall, the entire hall immediately fell silent.

Many people looked at Jian Wushuang with strange gazes.

Some were curious, some were surprised, and some were gloating.

“Is he Heavenly Sword Marquis?”

“It’s him. It’s because of him that the Mystic Realm we’re in is sealed by the Purple Cloud Pavilion, so we can’t even use the space passage.”

“The space-time seal has been in place for ninety years. During those ninety years, the Heavenly Sword Marquis stayed in the secret chamber and said that he was cultivating in seclusion. But from what I can see, he didn’t dare to go out, so he had to hide.”

“That’s normal. If it were me, I would have to hide under such circumstances. I don’t believe that the Purple Cloud Pavilion would dare to seal this place forever.”

“Hehe, I heard that when the Purple Cloud Pavilion sealed this place up 90 years ago, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance asked the Heavenly Sword Marquis if they wanted to help him get rid of the people from the Purple Cloud Pavilion. In the end, they were rejected by him. He said that it was his fault and that he could handle it himself. There was no need for the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to do anything.”

“Handle it himself? He’s a rank three True Saint. Oh No, he seems to have broken through to the rank four True Saint now. But even so, how could he handle it by himself?”

“In my opinion, he’s suffering because he wants to save face. Now, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance obviously won’t pay attention to this matter, and he can only hide in this nest like a coward.”

In the hall, many members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance were chatting casually, and many of them looked at Jian Wushuang with a hint of ridicule.

Because in their eyes, Jian Wushuang really wanted to save face.

It would have been great if the Heaven-cleaving Alliance had appeared before, but now he had to hide in this Mystic Realm.

Jian Wushuang also noticed these mocking gazes, but he did not care at all.

Under the gaze of these people, Jian Wushuang had already come to the counter.

“My young friend, how can I help you?” The brown-haired elder at the counter was still very humble and polite to Jian Wushuang.

“I want to ask how many experts of the Purple Cloud Pavilion are staying outside and what level they are at,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Well, I do know.” The brown-haired elder smiled, “There are six experts of the Purple Cloud Pavilion staying outside the nest. Five of them are rank six True Saints. Besides an ordinary deacon of rank six True Saints, the other four are at the peak of rank six!”

“As for the last one, you should know that he is Elder Xin Wu of the Purple Cloud Pavilion. He is a very powerful rank seven True Saint. Although he is not at the peak of rank seven, he is more powerful than an ordinary peak rank seven True Saint!”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

A powerful rank seven True Saint, four peak rank six True Saints, and an ordinary six True Saints in the outside world. This lineup was very strong. Elder Xin Wu really thought highly of him.

“After cultivating in seclusion for 90 years, my strength has indeed soared. In addition, I just broke through to rank four True Saint. Now, I can deal with a rank six True Saint easily, but the key is Xinwu!” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

Although Xin Wu was not at the peak of rank seven, she was more difficult to deal with than an ordinary rank seven Peak True Saint.

Such an expert was not something Jian Wushuang could deal with at the moment.

However, if he wanted to walk out of this nest, he would have to face the heart witch head-on.

“I have no choice but to ask for help,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

Of course, he did not mean to ask for help directly from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance or the Dao Palace, but…to issue a mission!

“Sir, I want to know what price an expert at the peak of rank seven would have to pay in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“An expert at the peak of rank seven?” The brown-haired elder looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise. He had probably figured out what Jian Wushuang was going to do.

“A True Saint at the peak of rank seven is already a top-notch True Saint expert. Although there are also Invincible True Saints, a true saint at the peak of rank seven is definitely a top-notch expert even in the Second Heaven, let alone in the First Heaven. The price to hire such an expert is not cheap,” the brown-haired elder said in a deep voice.

“I know the price is not low, but how much do you need?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“At least five billion holy elixirs. It will take some time before a rank seven Peak True Saint comes to accept the mission,” the brown-haired elder said.

“Five billion?” Jian Wushuang nodded secretly. The price was not far from what he had expected.

Five billion holy elixirs was an astronomical figure for an ordinary True Saint, even for many rank six True Saints.

But it was not too much for a rank seven True Saint. After all, many rank seven True Saints had more than five billion holy elixirs. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

It was not too much to ask a rank seven Peak True Saint to help once. Five billion holy elixirs were more or less enough.

“How about this? I’ll give you seven billion holy elixirs. I want you to give me a task immediately and ask a rank seven Peak True Saint to come,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Seven billion?” The brown-haired elder’s pupils suddenly constricted.

Jian Wushuang was only a rank three True Saint before. Even if he made a breakthrough now, he was only a rank four True Saint. How could he give seven billion holy elixirs?

“If it’s seven billion holy elixirs, there should be many rank seven Peak True Saints willing to accept this mission, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course.” The brown-haired elder said, “Five billion holy elixirs were not enough to hire a rank seven Peak True Saint, but seven billion holy elixirs is more than enough. If nothing goes wrong, once this mission is issued, someone will accept it in two days at most.”

“That’s good.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“My young friend, the seven billion holy elixirs…” The brown-haired elder looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Wait a moment.” Jian Wushuang went directly to the Treasure Pavilion.

He did not have seven billion holy elixirs, but he still had eight universe crystals in his hand. He could get one from Lord Tianshou.
