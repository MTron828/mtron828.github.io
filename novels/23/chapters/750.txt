Chapter 751: Waiting for Hares to Crash into A Tree Stump

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the canyon, the black-robed woman was sitting cross-legged on a boulder, her eyes continuously sweeping the surroundings in vigilance.

Although Jian Wushuang flew to her from behind, when he was still 100 meters away, she had already spotted him.

“Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!”

Jets of aquamarine light suddenly shot out. They were as sharp as spears. At least 10 shot towards Jian Wushuang at the same time. They traveled so fast that he was instantly enveloped in aquamarine light.

She, who had had her back to him, turned around abruptly, revealing a grotesque face. A hideous grin was spreading across her ugly face. “Which reckless dumbass dares to throw a sneak attack on me?”

Ten shots of aquamarine light zoomed over.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were freezing cold, the Emperor Sword in his hand stabbed forward. Half of the Sword Heart power was unleashed.

“Get away from me!”

A roar sounded. A towering sword shadow wielded in the air and produced several currents of wind, fending off every jet of aquamarine light.

“Battle strength at Step Two of the Eternal Realm?” The woman was startled. But soon, a dull black Stone Staff appeared in her hand.

Holding the Staff, she gave off an intimidating aura. All of a sudden, she hurled it toward Jian Wushuang.

The Long Staff quickly swelled and grew in midair. In an instant, it was the size of a mountain. It continued to propel toward him.

Jian Wushuang did not panic. He pulled out his sword single-handedly.

“Secret Skill, the Netherworld!”

Jian Wushuang cast his Killing Move.

A thunderous bang sounded. The black-robed woman gave a violent shudder, and then blood spilled from her mouth, too.

“I am at the peak of Step One of the Eternal Realm. If I was seriously wounded by him from only one move, I’m afraid his battle strength is approaching the peak of Step Two,” she murmured. She quickly turned and fled.

A puff of bizarre aquamarine mist rose from her body, and her speed instantly skyrocketed.

“Secret Skill, Mind-controlling!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his teeth and performed the Mind-controlling Secret Skill.

When he’d thrown this attack on the elder from the Immortal Dynasty, he had frozen on the spot for a second on account of the pain. Now, caught off guard, the black-robed woman also sensed a piercing twinge in her mind, rendering her motionless for a moment.

Although this momentary motionlessness was even shorter than that of the elder, Jian Wushuang still seized the opportunity.

“Secret Skill, Twilight!”

He launched his fastest move with the sword. The Sword Heart power in his sea of consciousness also released 70 percent of its power, accelerating the speed of the sword significantly. Then, before she could react, Jian Wushuang finished her off.

“Yeah—”

After killing the black-robed woman, Jian Wushuang let out a slight sigh of relief. He turned to look at the dead body at his feet.

“Most of the experts in the Eternal Realm have a way to escape. If it wasn’t for the Mind-controlling Secret Skill, even if I become stronger, it would still be very difficult to kill them!” Jian Wushuang said to himself.

Being good at escaping was a crucial ability. Experts from the Firmament Territory relied on it when they journeyed in the Tianqi Mountains.

But unfortunately for them, the target of the Mind-controlling Secret Skill was the mind. This was highly eccentric, and always put the enemy off his guard.

If Eternal Realm experts were not careful enough, they would easily fall into Jian Wushuang’s trap, offering him the chance to launch his fatal attack.

With a wave of the hand, the black-robed woman was turned to dust. After burning the corpse and destroying the evidence, Jian Wushuang slinked aside and hid in the canyon.

He was waiting for more Cloud Sea Asgard experts to arrive.

He did not wait long. In less than half a day, a stocky muscular elder appeared in the canyon.

Jian Wushuang, who was still hiding in the dark, recognized with just one glance that this muscular elder was also from the Cloud Sea Asgard.

Without hesitation, he struck out again.

This elder was not as strong as the woman he had just murdered. In spite of his unique way of fleeing, under the impact of Jian Wushuang’s Mind-Controlling Secret Skill and Scarlet Eye Secret Skill, it was impossible for him to escape. In the end, he was slaughtered as well.

After destroying three Eternal Realm experts—Wu Dao, the black-robed woman, and the muscular elder, Jian Wushuang decided to keep hiding in the Cloud Canyon.

But apparently, these two were the only experts Wu Dao had joined hands with, because Jian Wushuang waited in the canyon for almost another full day but failed to spot any more. He only saw a few clansmen from the Ancient God Clan.

“Seems that the only Cloud Sea Asgard experts around the Cloud Canyon are the three of them,” he thought.

With no more prey to hunt, naturally he chose to leave. He continued his traveling in the Tianqi Mountains.

…

Each time, the Eternal Zone’s opening period was only 10 days.

Today was already the third day.

In the vast Void of the Tianqi Mountains.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Three figures swiftly flitted across the Void, each of them emitting a rich aura of Spiritual Power. Obviously, they were desperately running away from something by casting their Secret Skills to the fullest.

An enormous silver figure emerged behind them.

It was obviously a Silver-armored Ancient God. He was sprinting in hot pursuit after the three. Usually, Ancient Gods were not good at running fast. However, this Silver-armored Ancient God was amazingly fast, even a bit faster than the three who were fleeing hastily with their Secret Skills.

Nor far behind him were two human experts.

“Bastard!”

Among the three who were fleeing with all their efforts, the one taking the lead was giving off a devastating aura.

This man was a Palace Master from the Ancient Sect. His name was Destruction.

The other two were Palace Master Ming Xin and Palace Master Mo Tao.

“Destruction, we’re not quite as fast as him. And we’re already performing our Secret Skills to the fullest. This costs us a great deal of our Spiritual Power. Soon our Spiritual Power will be depleted. What should we do? Separate and run in different directions?” Palace Master Mo Tao asked.

“Separate?” Palace Master Destruction’s eyebrows furrowed in concentration. “If we run together, we might all be killed or all survive. If we separate, one of us will definitely die. We will not separate from each other unless there is no other alternative.”

Palace Master Mo Tao and Palace Master Ming Xin both nodded.

If they had to separate and flee on their own, it meant they had no way but to sacrifice one’s life in order to save the lives of the other two.

Once they made such a choice, one of them was bound to die. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

But for now, they were not that desperate.

“I’ve sent the emergency signal. I hope experts from our Ancient Sect can rush here and back us up, otherwise…” Palace Master Destruction said. His face was gloomy.

“That guy is crazy!”

Mo Tao yelled, fixing his eyes on the Silver-armored Ancient God who was hurtling towards them.
