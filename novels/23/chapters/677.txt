“Everyone has their own unique opportunities. The fact that you, a little fellow from the Ancient World, received such incredible an opportunity, just means that you are very fortunate and blessed,” Xuan Yi smiled. “Now that I know you’ve acquired the Immortality Secret Skill, I won’t ask about it anymore.”

“You can go back first. I need to prepare some Secret Skills which are suitable for you. In addition, I will help you apply to cultivate at Sword Mountain .”

“Sword Mountain?”It seemed to appeal to Jian Wushuang.

On the first day he arrived at Sword Palace, he heard about Sword Mountain from Zhu Lie. Sword Mountain was unique to Sword Palace and it was demanding to cultivate there. Sword Mountain was almost a legend in Sword Palace and few people could cultivate there, but apparently, Jian Wushuang had the qualifications now.

“I’ll take my leave then.”

Jian Wushuang said, then he turned around and left.

As Xuan Yi watched Jian Wushuang leaving, an enigmatic smile appeared on his face.

“My disciple is very cautious.”

“His opportunity was by no means as simple as what he said. He is hiding a very big secret, but he won’t even tell me about it.”

Xuan Yi murmured but did he didn’t blame his disciple. On the contrary, a strong appreciation could be seen flickering in his eyes.

Since it was a big secret, it was better if fewer people knew about it. If Jian Wushuang told him the secret easily, it would definitely disappoint him.

“The little fellow is superb, both in talent and wisdom!”

“He is a real diamond in the rough. Once he is polished, he will be able to achieve a lot in the future.”

“As for the polishing, it will not be that difficult. The very moment he became my personal disciple, the polishing had already started.”

“Haha, if Cloud Sea Asgard, the Immortal Dynasty, and the Boundless Demon Sect knew that I’ve taken Jian Wushuang as my personal disciple, I’m afraid the three magnates would explode…”

Not long after Jian Wushuang grasped the three sword scars left by Xuan Yi, the news that Xuan Yi had taken him as his personal disciple had spread throughout the entire the Ancient Sect.

At that time, the whole Ancient Sect was in shock.

The Ancient Sect disciples were aghast.

Since Xuan Yi was one of the oldest, most mysterious, and most powerful Palace Masters, everyone dreamed of being apprenticed to him.

It was a pity though, the requirement for becoming his disciple was just too demanding. After so many years, no one had met the standards set by Xuan Yi and these Ancient Sect disciples didn’t know that Xuan Yi already had other personal disciples.

In their eyes, Xuan Yi had finally accepted a personal disciple.

Immediately after that, countless Ancient Sect disciples began to admire Jian Wushuang for having such a powerful master whom everyone dreamed of apprenticing to.

As for experts in the Ancient Sect, they remained calm after hearing this news.

They knew that Jian Wushuang had condensed his Sword Heart and that the third sword scar would no longer be a challenge for him. It was obvious that Jian Wushuang would be able to grasp the third sword scar and became the personal disciple of Xuan Yi. However, they never expected him to succeed as quickly as he did and only use half a month to comprehend it.

The news of Xuan Yi accepting a personal disciple didn’t just shock the Ancient Sect though. It even created a great disturbance within the entire Firmament Territory.

One of the three magnates of the Firmament Territory, Cloud Sea Asgard.

At the center of a huge immortal mansion inside the Cloud Sea Asgard Sect, dozens of Elders had gathered, lead by a grey-haired and barefoot elder with a baby face. This barefoot elder was Yun Fan, the Great Elder of Cloud Sea Asgard.

“I just heard news from the Ancient Sect that Xuan Yi accepted a personal disciple today and the disciple is the well-known Jian Wushuang,” Yunfan looked rather grim.

Normally, if someone else accepted a personal disciple, it had nothing to do with him or Cloud Sea Asgard.

But it was wholly different when Xuan Yi accepted a personal disciple.

All of Cloud Sea Asgard attached great importance to it when Xuan Yi accepted a personal disciple.

After hearing what Yun Fan said, these Elders looked grim, as well.

“I’ve found out some information about Jian Wushuang. He is a peerless genius from the Ancient World who just recently appeared in Firmament Territory Feast two years ago,” Yun Fan continued. “Although he came from the Ancient World, he gave an impressive performance at Firmament Territory Feast. At that time, he was already incredibly powerful, he had spent less than 40 years cultivating, and he had only been in the Skyscraping Realm for less than a year. He is only slightly inferior when compared with Gong Chao.

After hearing that, all the Elders were shocked.

Gong Chao was currently a disciple of their Cloud Sea Asgard. They were all aware of his talent and strength. However, Jian Wushuang, who cultivated for less than 40 years and came from the Ancient World, was evenly matched with Gong Chao. It was completely unbelievable!

“After Jian Wushuang arrived at the Ancient Sect, he quickly demonstrated his amazing talent in Sword Principle and became apprenticed to Xuan Yi as a nominal disciple. Not long after ago, he took part in their Sect Competition and managed to pass through 30 floors of the Ninth Heaven Road in one go. It’s truly incredible.” Yunfan clasped his hands.

“The 30th floor of the Ninth Heaven Road!?” These Elders marveled at such a result.

They all knew about the Ninth Heaven Road, which was composed of 31 floors. It was unimaginable that a kid in the Skyscraping Realm could pass the 30th floor.

“According to the information we have, Jian Wushuang is still in the Skyscraping Realm, but he has already condensed his Sword Heart. After condensing his Sword Heart, it only took him half a month to comprehend the third sword scar left by Xuan Yi. After that, Xuan Yi agreed to accept him as a personal disciple,” Yun Fan said, then remained silent for a while. After that moment of silence, he raised his head and glanced around with a very grim look in his eyes.

“Everyone! All of you know how terrifying Xuan Yi is!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“And it’s not just because of his own strength, the most important part is his ability to instruct his disciples. Before Jian Wushuang, he already had three personal disciples, whose achievements are known by all of us.”

These elders of Cloud Sea Asgard also stayed silent.

The three personal disciples Xuan Yi instructed?

Immediately, three figures appeared in their minds. At the mere thought of them, they all trembled in fear.

“Xuan Yi! He is a complete and utter Monster, so the disciples he instructs will definitely be monstrous as well!”

“His first three personal disciples have made incredibly fast progress. I don’t even need to comment on it. You all understand how terrifying the three of them are! Any one of them is strong enough to threaten the entire Cloud Sea Asgard!”

“And now, Jian Wushuang, who spent less than 40 years cultivating, possesses a strength that is almost equal to Gong Chao, and condensed his Sword Heart while still in the Skyscraping Realm, probably has even higher talent than those other three personal disciples!”
