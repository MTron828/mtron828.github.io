Chapter 1226: Fighting!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“With the vortex growing to such size, the spaceship of the Jin Kingdom had long retreated farther away, leaving on the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom with the woman who was the conjurer of the formation nearby. I will leave this Puppet Fighter with you, Jian Wushuang. Everything hinges upon your success. Go with our blessings and hope.” The Samsara Temple Master said to him gravely.

“Leave everything to me.” Jian Wushuang nodded to him as he received control of the Puppet Fighter.

“Father, Sword Emperor, we strike now.” Jian Wushuang muttered, his eyes burning with conviction as his second Original Body materialized beside him.

“Of course.”

Having readied themselves, Jian Nantian and the Sunrise Sword Emperor were already waiting for Jian Wushuang’s signal. They disembarked the Fortress and the four flew towards the eye of the spiraling vortex.

But the proud contemptuous conjurer of the vortex, Jiu Xi at its eye instantly noticed their auras once they took into the sky.

“At last. After one year, the Green Fire World has finally begun to act.” Jiu Xi cast her gaze into the distance, studying at the four figures coming at her. “What are they thinking of doing? Do they not intend to destroy the formation?”

“But for one year they have waited and the Grand Formation has grown to such size. Is it not too late?”

Jiu Xi wondered as she felt pleased and confident with herself.

Even in the realm of the Eternal Chaotic World, the Enduring Samsara Formation was flagrantly notorious as a formation that could easily destroy worlds and lay waste to dimensions. Surely its magic could never be easily undone.

Moreover, the Grand Formation had cultivated itself to its current deformity over the past year. It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to destroy the Grand Formation now.

It is unfathomable that the Green Fire World, a domain which has little to nil dealings with the Eternal Chaotic World, would have any way to destroy the Grand Formation. Surely it could not even be possible.

Yet despite her overbearing confidence in her impending success, Jiu Xi was careful enough to immediately contact the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom.

The Monarch had also been hiding nearby for the entire year. Finally, there came an opportunity for him to shake off his year-long restlessness.

“Jian Wushuang?”

The Monarch had been observing the four approaching figures when they approached. A wicked and sinister smile lined across his face. “It was by sheer luck that you have been able to slip through my fingers last time. But you will never be so lucky this time!”

The four flew closer and closer to the eye of the vortex under the watchful eye of the Monarch observing them.

“We are nearing the eye of the vortex. But why is the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom not showing himself?” Jian Nantian wondered, his face wearing a solemn expression of concern.

“Have no worry, father. I have found his approximate position and I am still observing him. I will release the Flame Deity Puppet upon him if he shows himself so that he would not be able to disturb us. The woman is only an ordinary Universe Master. I have something prepared for her.” Jian Wushuang said to him.

He had long projected his Strength of Soul to locate the position of the disguised Monarch who could still be oblivious to the vulnerability of his concealment.

This was the advantage of using his Strength of Soul.

The Strength of Soul was a form of energy most powerful and potent. It was only through his Inverse Cultivation that Jian Wushuang had been able to harness such powers. Then again, this was merely a fraction of the Strength’s full potential and faculties.

“Ah? I see he can wait no more.” Jian Wushuang noticed, the edge of his lips curling. His senses had picked up the movements of the Monarch who was now coming at them stealthily.

“Hahaha… Despite possessing strength greater than that of mine, the Monarch intends to put me to death by using camouflage and ambush. Hardly a conduct befitting that of a king.” Jian Wushuang chuckled with disdain. He waited until the Monarch was about thousands of kilometers away before he threw his arms outwards.

A silvery flash of light shot from the folds of his sleeve.

“Boom!”

The Flame Deity Puppet emerged imperiously with a strong and terrifying aura that poured forth with the force of a broken dam; an indomitable and staggering presence which could deflate even a Universe Master such as the Samsara Temple Master himself.

His cold eyes flared with a silver glint, training upon the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom under the commands of Jian Wushuang. He began to move, striding forward towards the Monarch.

With one single step, the Puppet defied all laws of physics as his step landed him directly in front of the Monarch. He had covered thousands of kilometers with one single step! The tip of his silvery spear rose like a bolt of lightning as the Puppet brandished the weapon and stabbed furiously at the Monarch.

“What did they do?”

Even the Monarch himself was taken aback by the sudden haste of the Puppet’s attack. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

He had not expected Jian Wushuang to have locked on to his position, nor had he expected that he would be under attack suddenly!

Swift and strong was the stroke unleashed by the Puppet that even the Monarch broke into cold sweat.

This unknown warrior possessed strength hardly inferior to his, in fact, it could even be stronger than his!

“Hmph!”

The Monarch grunted with defiant rage and summoned into his grasp his black spear. The long polearm gleamed with a supple blush as it appeared, heeding its master’s call.

“My weapon, the Spear of the Secluded Rainbow!”

The eyes of the Monarch sparkled with malice as he swung his spear in an arc and it collided ferociously with the silvery spear.

“Clang!”

Steel grated against steel as the ruthless and brutish gnashing of metals produced angry sparks. The sheer explosive force caused by the collision threw the fabric of Space around the weapons into disarray.

The Monarch’s look turned into one of ugliness and rage as he was thrown backward by the explosion. He staggered a few steps frantically in less than a dozen steps; each step he took sent him thousands of kilometers away.

Instead, the Flame Deity Puppet was hardly affected by the blast. The silvery armor-clad figure merely paused and threw himself forward, hurtling towards the Monarch for another bout.

“The Silver Armored Puppet Fighter does indeed live up to its name! To think that he could best the Monarch in strength and power!” Jian Wushuang was gleeful. He looked at his companions and said, “The Puppet Fighter has bought us time. Let us strike now!”

“Very well.” The Sword Emperor and Jian Nantian both agreed.

As they full well knew, they now held in their hands the very fate of the entire Green Fire World!

The survival of the Green Fire World was hinged upon their success!

But if they were to fail, the vortex of the Grand Formation of the Enduring Samsara would continue growing and the Green Fire World would be engulfed by it!

“Attack!”

With the cue of Jian Wushuang’s thunderous battle cry, his two Original Bodies, Jian Nantian and the Sunrise Sword Emperor split.

The four figures streaked rapidly through the air and swiftly assumed their positions according to the Sword Formation as instructed by Xuan Yi.

As he flew, Jian Wushuang threw another wary glance at the proud woman Jiu Xi.

“Being an ordinary Universe Master, I doubt your powers will be able to obstruct us. But it would be best that you are kept from us.” Jian Wushuang muttered and flicked wrist again.

A hulking figure emerged out of thin air into view.

“Keep her occupied so that she cannot be in our way, Fu Yi. It would be better too if you can take her alive!” Jian Wushuang commanded him.

Jian Wushuang had made such arrangements as a precautionary measure.

In the event of failure, they might still be able to wring answers out of Jiu Xi.

She might be in possession of the knowledge to remove the Grand Formation, seeing as she was the conjurer of the Grand Formation.

Fu Yi’s eyes twinkled once as he acknowledged Jian Wushuang’s order. A huge battle axe appeared in his grasp as he pounced at Jiu Xi.

“Ah… So you lot have come to destroy the Grand Formation and you have brought along a Puppet Fighter which is strong enough to fight against Lord Jin Feng. But your efforts will all be for naught no matter how hard you try!” Jiu Xi smiled wickedly to herself. Seeing as Fu Yi came charging at her, she drifted into the undulations of the churning energies rolling around the vortex.
