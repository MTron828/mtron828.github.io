Chapter 5196: Feather Continent

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Losing half of his origin source and his divine body was on the verge of collapse, Madman Yang couldn’t fight anymore. He could only retire in the mountains.

“Hmph, if it weren’t for your cowardice, I would have killed that bullsh*t Daluo Realm’s Prince long ago.” Madman Yang had almost died, but his mouth was still very tough, not convinced at all.

The peak-level Grand Yan Immortal they had their eyes on was one of the top 10 Princes of the Daluo Realm.

Three years ago, four of the six Great Princes of the Daluo Realm on this original planet had fallen. The remaining two Princes did not dare to be arrogant anymore and had been walking in the main continent in a low-profile manner. Who would have thought that a few top-notch Grand Yan Immortals would dare to surround him and treat him as a pushover? In a fit of anger, they almost killed all the experts in that small team.

His good friend sighed and said indifferently, “Alright, even Little Seven has fallen this time. What else do you want us to do?”

Hearing him mention Little Seven, Madman Yang also fell silent, and his eyes turned red.

Little Seven was the only female among them. In the outside world, he had always treated her as a younger sister. Now, she had fallen on the original planet because of them.

“Little Seven.” Madman Yang lowered his head.

“Alright, don’t be too sad. Rest well here. In a few years, if you really can’t fight anymore, we’ll come to you and wait for the trial to end.”

Their strength was at the top-grade level, and with this strength, they had a chance of entering the top 1,000. Moreover, they had discussed that in the final year, if anyone was the closest to the top 1,000, they would give up the top 10,000 spot and give the identity token to that person so that he could enter the top 1,000 and enter the next round.

As for the treasures bestowed, they were given to those who contributed to the battle.

Madman Yang nodded. This time, he didn’t say anything else and went straight into the mountain range.

The expert who sent him here shook his head and sighed. His figure flashed and disappeared from where he was. The journey was not over yet. He still had to go to the main continent to fight.

After landing in the heart of the mountain range, Madman Yang collected his aura and started to search for a suitable place to hide. Now that he was seriously injured and only had the strength of an ordinary Perfected Nine Revolutions, he naturally had to find the safest place to hide.

He walked over thousands of mountains and searched everywhere.

“I heard that there are more than 100,000 Grand Yan Immortals hidden in this mountain range!” Madman Yang sneered.

Grand Yan Immortals who needed to hide were the weakest. This was also the hinterland of the mountain range, so not many experts would come here.

When some Grand Yan Immortals came in, they saw that the situation was not right and hid in the mountain range. These people were mostly Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals, they were weak and did not have any battle achievements, so no one went to look for these Grand Yan Immortals.

Killing a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal only gave him 100 battle achievement points. If he had the time, he might as well participate in a random battle on the continent and obtain 10,000 battle achievement points.

After all these years of trial, the Grand Yan Immortals who were able to survive on the main continent were not weak. Moreover, each of them had hundreds of thousands of battle achievement points.

These people were the real fat meat!

Madman Yang continued to explore the mountain range.

Even though his strength had dropped drastically, he was still at the standard of an ordinary Perfected Nine Revolutions. Naturally, he was not afraid of those cowards who were hiding.

Thud!

Madman Yang stepped into a quiet canyon.

“This place is not bad!” Madman Yang murmured softly.

After fighting for so many years, he was still somewhat unwilling to end up like this. However, his strength had decreased so much that he could no longer stay on the main continent. Otherwise, he would be courting death.

After entering the canyon, his figure flashed and he reached the depths of the canyon.

Looking around, there were natural caves here that extended in all directions. It was very suitable for hiding.

He took another step forward and entered the cave.

Madman Yang, who had just entered the cave, suddenly felt that something was wrong. However, before he could react, he was stunned on the spot. Then, like a puppet, he walked forward mechanically.

Whoosh!

“l see someone took the initiative to come and deliver their battle points to me!” Jian Wushuang controlled the seriously injured Madman Yang with his Heart power.

In the blink of an eye, he had already cultivated for several years. He originally wanted to leave this place in the next few days and go to the main continent to roam around. In the end, before he could move, a silly Grand Yan Immortal barged into his array.

Then, under the interference of his Thought power, he let Madman Yang walk into the cave he was in and directly used his Heart power to control him.

Although he was also ranked in the top 100 of the original planet, he did not know much about the actual battlefields on the original planet.

With a thought, Madman Yang came directly in front of him.

At this moment, Madman Yang was sitting cross-legged opposite Jian Wushuang with a dull look in his eyes.

“Let me ask you, how much do you know about the main continent?” Jian Wushuang waved his hand and a long table appeared in front of him. On it were some rare fruits and a pot of wine.

All of these were obtained from God-Emperor MO Long. This fellow had an Emperor as his father and a territory comparable to a medium-grade world under his control.

It was not an exaggeration to say that he was an Emperor. As an Emperor, it was normal for him to have all kinds of rare treasures, strange fruits, and fine wine.

Jian Wushuang poured himself a glass of wine and drank it calmly. The light fragrance of the wine made him feel refreshed. After drinking it, he felt light and light. It seemed that the wine was refined from a large number of exotic fruits.

It was good to be the master of a force!

All kinds of treasures were offered, but Jian Wushuang had never even smelled this kind of wine. After all, this pot of wine could probably be exchanged for an ordinary treasure in the outside world. Jian Wushuang wasn’t that extravagant.

Although Madman Yang was unconscious, he still swallowed his saliva and replied stiffly, “Continent? Is it the Feather Continent?”

“Yes!” Jian Wushuang nodded. He had heard MO Long mention the Feather Continent before. At that time, he had wanted to ask MO Long about the situation in the Feather Continent. However, he remembered that MO Long had just recovered from his injuries and had not gone to the Feather Continent for a long time. That was the main battlefield. It was different every day.

“Oh right, why is that continent called the Feather Continent?” Jian Wushuang asked curiously.

When they had just arrived at the original planet, it had been deathly silent. They did not know anything about this planet. How did that continent have a name and everyone recognized it?

“That continent was derived from a feather. Dao Lord Xue Yue called it Feather Continent, and everyone followed suit.”

A feather?

Jian Wushuangs eyes narrowed and he exclaimed in shock, “A feather? How could it be so big?!”

A feather the size of a continent, and it was 10 percent the size of the entire original planet. Regardless of where the feather fell from, that existence had to be very large.

This wasn’t the manifestation of some magical heavenly law. This was truly the size of a feather that had fallen off.

That existence’s body was probably comparable to a miniature world. He had never heard of such a huge body.. Even a tier 5 Emperor would find it difficult

to do such a thing!
