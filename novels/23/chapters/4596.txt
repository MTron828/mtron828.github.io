4598 Land of Gods

There were a total of 17 Void Masters patrolling the 23rd crack. Apart from the most powerful Jiuzhi Emperor, there were seven Void Masters with Five Scars hiding in the depths.

In order to prevent the news of him entering the Void Universe from spreading too quickly, Jian Wushuang simply sealed the entire area with his super power and killed the remaining Void Masters one by one.

After doing all this quickly, Jian Wushuang’s body turned into a flowing light and swept toward the path in his memory.

There were billions of Star Fields in the Void Universe, and the larger Star Fields and Holy Lands were already in a state of war. Every once in a while, they would send Scar-level Void Masters to the Divine Power Universe.

The Void Universe had already exhausted all its resources during the Great Catastrophe War.

“Just for the sake of fate energy for the Void Universe, my entire Divine Power Universe has fallen…” Jian Wushuang’s star-like eyes reflected a large Star Field. “I’ll make you pay back double for what you’ve eaten!”

In a desolate Star Field, Jian Wushuang, dressed as a young Ranger, stopped.

In just 10,000 years, the Land of Gods where Palace Master Dao Yan was sealed had become dilapidated and desolate until it was destroyed.

The 99 divine power restrictions had long since ceased to exist, and any Four Scar Void Master could break them with force.

The more it was so, the more Jian Wushuang panicked. He did not want to believe that the Supreme Dao Yan would die just like that, so he immediately urged his divine power to enter the Land of Gods.

The 99 divine power restrictions disappeared automatically and opened up a path for Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was stunned when he stepped into the Land of Gods.

The dilapidated walls that were originally as large as hills and ravines had disappeared. In their place was a green lotus that grew to the sky.

Every inch of the land was filled with green lotuses, swaying with the wind.

Apart from the green lotuses, there was nothing else.

“Senior Brother Dao Yan… Senior Brother Dao Yan.” Jian Wushuang walked forward and his voice reverberated through the entire world.

The green lotus contained a divine rhythm, which was transformed from the body of the Supreme Dao Yan.

Jian Wushuang did not know if the Supreme Dao Yan had died, so he could only follow his aura to find his whereabouts.

For 15 days, he searched the hills and ravines tirelessly, but there was no trace of him.

“Could it be that Senior Brother Dao Yan has really died?” A trace of sadness flashed through his eyes.

“Junior Brother Wushuang, how have you been?”

Like the spring breeze and summer cicadas, an indescribably pleasant and warm voice sounded.

Jian Wushuang quivered and hurriedly looked behind him.

“Senior brother Dao Yan!” Jian Wushuang jumped up and ran to Dao Yan excitedly.

Dao Yan had recovered a little since the last time they met. His dry face had begun to recover and looked a little more refreshed.

“Wushuang, why did you risk your life to come here?” Dao Yan said, “I can sense that the aura left behind by that existence is extremely weak. Has our universe won?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes dimmed and he told Dao Yan everything that had happened.

“Even now, it is still unknown how powerful Cosmos God is.” Jian Wushuang found it difficult to continue.

Supreme Dao Yan’s body swayed as he looked at the sky that was forever dark. He shed tears and said, “The Heavenly Dao! How can the Heavenly Dao be like this!?”

“As long as I’m still alive, I’ll definitely slaughter all the enemies!” Jian Wushuang said hatefully, “I’ll use my life to change the heavens!”

“I, Dao Yan, swear to protect the Divine Power Universe with my life!” Dao Yan’s tears fell. “But now, my Dao realm has returned to its original state. I can’t turn the situation around.”

Jian Wushuang took a step forward and said, “Senior Brother, it’s okay. Now, leave this place with me. I’ll take you to a Land of Great Creation. After comprehending for more than 10,000 years, you’ll definitely be able to return to your peak.”

Dao Yan’s eyes were filled with hope, but then they dimmed again. “Silly Junior Brother, I can’t leave now. Once I leave, the aura left by Void God will definitely fight back crazily. I’m afraid you won’t be able to leave then.”

Jian Wushuang said firmly, “Senior Brother, I’m not the same person as before. As long as he doesn’t come in person, I can protect you even if he’s a Half Ancestor realm expert!”

Then, without waiting for Dao Yan to speak, Jian Wushuang waved his hand and used divine power to pick the Natal Green Lotus under Dao Yan.

In an instant, the entire Land of Gods collapsed. Countless green lotuses withered like rivers and seas falling. The dispersed spiritual power returned to the origin of the green lotus.

At the same time, a majestic voice that seemed to have traveled through the primeval times resounded.

“Dao Yan, why do you want to step out of the restriction? Aren’t you afraid of your soul being destroyed?”

The sky caved in, and endless void power descended. Black flames so dense that they were almost tangible covered the entire sky, and a giant face of chaos looked down at the earth.

His eyes, which were like the sun and stars, shone on the ground.

Jian Wushuang saw it clearly. The huge face was the True Shadow of Void God in the Void Universe!

Dao Yan snorted and did not look at him. Instead, he sent a message to Jian Wushuang, “Junior Brother Wushuang, I will fight him with my divine soul later. You should take the time to escape and save the Last Flame for my Divine Power Universe.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang shook his head gently and said, “Senior Brother Dao Yan, I’m telling you now that I’m not the same as before. Even if his True Shadow comes, I’m not afraid at all!”

At the end of his words, a vast divine power suddenly surged up like a huge wind that hit the sky.

The two completely different forces clashed together, creating the most magnificent light.

The divine power that belonged to Jian Wushuang, under the pressure of the void power, was actually able to be equal to it and there was a faint trend of rising!

“What?” In the sky, the giant face asked doubtfully, “Such an ant can actually emit such an aura. No wonder you dare to step out of the thunder pool, Dao Yan!”

“Since that’s the case, then all of you shall stay here today!”

As the sound of a bell rang out, the endless void power suddenly condensed into a huge palm that covered the sky and pressed down heavily.

Jian Wushuang was not afraid. He snorted coldly and his palms emitted a brilliant scarlet-gold divine light. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Ancestral Skill — Transcendence Heavenly Gate!”

The majestic Heavenly Gate broke through the dark void power and landed in the sky, emitting an endless majesty.

Treasure light circulated and the giant sun shone. A giant finger that reached the heavens appeared from the Heaven’s Gate. With a brilliant divine might, it met the giant palm that covered the sky.

Boom!!

The two collided, and an extremely dark void power and brilliant divine might erupted in the most intense explosion.

The seven-colored shockwaves destroyed the sky, and a chasm appeared on the ground. The foul air of the abyss gushed out.

At the moment of collision, blood gushed out of Jian Wushuang’s ears and nose. The black robe on his body was torn and the divine patterns around him dimmed.

The giant palm and the giant finger of the Heavenly Gate were in a stalemate. The divine power and void power completely tore the Land of Gods apart.

The giant face in the sky was no longer expressionless. Under the Heaven’s Gate’s finger, it also quickly dimmed.

Although the face was Void God’s True Shadow, this was Jian Wushuang’s home field!
