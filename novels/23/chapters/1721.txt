Chapter 1722: Jian Wushuang and Sir God Liu Yin

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“It’s really you,” Sir God Liu Yin’s face grew dim.

He was also a member of Sanctuary Alliance and he had also heard of Jian Wushuang, but he only knew Jian Wushuang’s name and some of his deeds. He had no idea how Jian Wushuang dressed.

After all, he shared no relationship with Lineage of Star and he never thought to have dealings with Jian Wushuang.

At the beginning when he saw Jian Wushuang, he didn’t recognize Jian Wushuang. But the moment he saw the power that Jian Wushuang displayed…

An Eternal Real God who could withstand his attack so easily… He reckoned that there was only Jian Wushuang alone who could do that in Eternal Chaotic World.

When the experts from the surrounding sixteen Holy Kingdoms heard Jian Wushuang’s name, everyone was confused. Then, they quickly realized Jian Wushuang’s identity.

“Jian Wushuang, the first place on Real God ranking list, Jian Wushuang!!!”

“Oh my goodness, it’s him!”

“First place on Real God ranking list!”

Along with cries of astonishment, everyone finally understood why Jian Wushuang had had the guts to provoke Sir God Liu Yin.

The difference between a Real God and an Almighty was ridiculously vast. In Eternal Chaotic World, there wouldn’t be more than three Real Gods who could be qualified to challenge an Almighty. However, Jian Wushuang definitely had the capability to.

“Jian Wushuang, I should have never offended you nor should I have offended Lineage of Star, right?” Sir God Liu Yin looked coldly at Jian Wushuang.

“You didn’t, but I really have to get the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas. So, I’m sorry,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“If so, there’s nothing much to say. I heard long ago that you are known as the top genius in Eternal Chaotic World and also an inverse cultivator. You just became an Eternal Chaotic Real God and you could fight against a Sir God, I’d like to see it in person today,” Sir God Liu Yin’s face grew cold.

“What tricks do you have? Go ahead and perform them.” Jian Wushuang said with confidence.

“Excuse my immodesty,” Sir God Liu Yin’s gaze grew sharp.

Hong!

The void quivered and a boundless divine power suddenly flowed out. It then formed huge Gale Dragons in front of Sir God Liu Yin.

Every single Gale Dragon was a hundred zhang long. There were more than hundred of Gale Dragons of that size that formed instantly and roared simultaneously. Then, they pounded at Jian Wushuang among the fierce winds.

Jian Wushuang could only feel a terrifying storm pressing at him and he immediately withdrew Blood Mountain Sword.

Vroom!

There was a soaring sword intention that seemed to be tearing everything apart.

Jian Wushuang stood there facing the wine but the surrounding people saw his figure vanish into thin air like a sharp sword that was going to pierce the sky.

He raised Blood Mountain Sword high in the sky and there were shrill crimson sword shadows that appeared in the void instantly.

Every single crimson sword shadow could destroy heaven and earth and was sufficient to strike fear in the hearts of the surrounding Real Gods, including those Chaotic Real Gods.

In an instant, there were sixty-one crimson sword shadows that carried such power which appeared in the air.

The sixty-one crimson sword shadows appeared and were immediately superposed onto one another.

“Ten Thousand Waves, break!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice shook the earth and he slashed Blood Mountain Sword downwards. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The brand new sword shadow made of the sixty-one crimson sword shadows suddenly swung out.

The sword shadow soared and instantly tore the Gale Dragons that were charging towards him into pieces. Then, in a short time, it swept out the Gale Dragon. There were some that were cut across from the middle and broke apart too.

The boundless divine power spread in all directions but suddenly… There was a hole in the middle of the divine power, a figure stepped out from the opening. He was Sir God Liu Yin.

There was murderous intention in his eyes. His right hand became a claw and he pounded at Jian Wushuang to claw the void.

The sharp claw magnified and it was like a dragon’s claw at an unbelievable speed. The claw caught Jian Wushuang and Jian Wushuang’s body instantly shattered into pieces.

Sir God Liu Yi wasn’t surprised at the sight but he looked solemn.

The one he clawed at was only a shadow.

“Vroom!””Vroom!”

There were two ear-piercing noises. Although the sound wasn’t loud, Sir God Liu Yin heard it clearly. Then, there were two rays of golden light next to him as well. The two rays of golden light were brilliant and extremely fast in speed.

Sir God Liu Yin waved and there were two flowing lights that swept out too.

Dang! Dang!

There was a loud clash and the two golden lights were shaken off. However, Sir God Liu Yin took a few steps back before he steadied himself too. Then, there were two flywheels that appeared in his hand. One of them was white and the other one was black. They gave out a unique aura which was quite creepy.

In the void before Sir God Liu Yin, Jian Wushuang stood there with one hand holding his sword. In front of him, the two Hong Jun Golden Swords were each on both sides of his body.

“Those are the golden swords that you used to injure Sir God Qian Lan?” Sir God Liu Yin glanced at the two Hong Jun Golden Sword and his gaze was cold. “They are quite powerful, but I wonder how are they against my Life and Death Flywheels?”

“Why not give it a try? Then, you’ll know,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Because he had known that he would run into Sir God Liu Yin, he had already read through some information about Sir God Liu Yin on his way there.

He knew that Sir God Liu Yin was one of the top Sir Gods. Compared to Sir God Qian Lan that he had fought with previously, he was much stronger and Sir God Liu Yin was best with his Life and Death Flywheels.

The two flywheels represented life and death each and displayed Sir God Liu Yin’s comprehension of Life and Death Doctrine flawlessly.

Life and Death Doctrine, one of the Nine Heaven God Doctrine, focused on being creepy.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang bellowed and the two Hong Jun Golden Swords that were floating in the air suddenly shook and turned into two resplendent golden lights. They burst out and left two golden straight lines in the void.

On the other hand, Sir God Liu Yin drove his two flywheels. Swoosh! Swoosh! The flywheels flew past the void and the speed was shockingly fast too.

Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!

The repeated clashing noise rang in the void. Both parties gave full play to their divine powers and comprehension towards doctrines respectively.

Hong Jun Golden Sword and the black and white flywheel that represented life and death clashed again and again. Just the overflowing power that spread was enough to rip a huge black hole in the void.

Occasionally, the impact spread to the border of the battlefield and a large number of experts were terrified.

The battle was a vigorous fight between Almighties. It wasn’t a fight that any Universe Gods or Real Gods at the scene could get involved in.

Even if one were a Chaotic Real God, they reckoned the Chaotic Real God might be exterminated by the power of the exchange blows.

Hong! Hong! Hong!

The void was torn apart again and again but it recovered again and again.

The battle between the two was becoming white-hot.
