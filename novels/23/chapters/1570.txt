Chapter 1571: A Stranded Dragon Rises To The Sky!

“How is this possible?” Ming Ba was completely stunned.

After all, he was a Void Real God.

However, at that very moment, just a gaze at him alone had actually caused him to be terrified and his expression to turn ghastly pale?

What kind of ability was this?

Even if Jian Wushuang had really regained the abilities of his peak, he should still not be so frightening, right?

“Could it be that not only did his abilities recover, he also achieved a great breakthrough and became a Real God?”

“But his aura is still that of a Universe God?”

Ming Ba was filled with amazement.

Jian Wushuang possessed a treasure manufactured by the Star Palace Master. However, that treasure could only allow Jian Wushuang to pretend to have the aura of a Universe God and not a Real God.

In other words, since he had already made a breakthrough to the Universe God of the Third Heaven, the aura that was released from his body was also that of a Universe God of the Third Heaven.

At the same time that Ming Ba was shocked, an indifferent voice could be heard. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Although I have not interacted with you much, for the past eighteen thousand years in the Qing Tian Mystery Land, I want to thank you for looking after me secretly. There are a hundred million Chaos Gems here and they are for you. From now on, you do not need to follow me anymore.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice felt as if it possessed some magical power. When it echoed in Ming Ba’s ears, his eyes became misty, he looked as if he were drunk and he was sleepy.

It was only after the voice disappeared for a long time that he woke up with a start abruptly. When he looked down again, he realized that Jian Wushuang had disappeared from the peak of the mountain ages ago and what was left was only a Qian Kun Ring.

“What a horrifying consciousness attack. It merely made my consciousness sleepy and did not make me completely unconscious. Moreover, it did not harm me at all. Such abilities… looks like Jian Wushuang’s abilities have really achieved a great breakthrough. However, he was already ranked third in the Universe God ranking list previously. At the very moment, how powerful is he?” Ming Ba exclaimed and shook his head.

After he had picked up Jian Wushuang’s Qian Kun Ring, he made his way back to the Green Feather Pavilion.

He knew that Jian Wushuang did not need him to observe him secretly anymore. Even if he wanted to observe Jian Wushuang, he did not have the ability to do so.

…

Atop the vast sky, Jian Wushuang wore the Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor that was made as a blood robe again. He then carried the Blood Mountain Sword on his back and moved slowly.

During his journey, he could not help but stretch himself.

“This feels so good!” Jian Wushuang laughed. It was obvious that he was over the moon.

“Jian Wushuang, you finally feel comfortable now. During the previous twenty-one thousand years, hehe, you were even inferior to a normal person and you almost died an upsetting death,” the King of Venomous Worms gasped in admiration.

“Haha. A cultivator has his own joys and a normal person also has his own benefits as well,” Jian Wushuang laughed,

For the past twenty-one thousand years, minus the thirteen thousand years that he had become a hard rock, he had lived his life as a normal person for eight thousand years and these eight thousand years had given him many feelings.

“No matter what, you have already cleared the Inverse Cultivation Test for the final Heaven. Hence, you have gotten past your greatest obstacle and your journey from now on will be a lot more relaxing. As such, I can set my mind at ease,” the King of Venomous Worms laughed, “Also, you must make the best use of your time to think of a way to make a breakthrough earlier to become a Real God. As soon as you make a breakthrough to a Real God, your Ancient God Power will achieve the sixth star and I will evolve along with you.”

“Five-star Ancient God and the Six-star Ancient God are both great thresholds. As soon as you get past them, your abilities would undergo an earth-shaking change. This change also applies to me. When you become a Six-star Ancient God, I will undergo a great change. At that time, I will be able to unleash a fair bit of my fighting capabilities and I will not need to stay in your body like now and die a depressing death.”

“Haha. Don’t worry. Since I have achieved the Universe God of the Third Heaven, Real God won’t be too far away as well,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

In no time, Jian Wushuang returned to the Divine Light Dynasty again.

The Divine Light Dynasty was the place that he had first set foot in when he arrived in the Qing Tian Mystery Land.

Within the Divine Light Dynasty, there was another person; he was Chen Hu.

Having stayed in the Qing Tian Mystery Land for so many years, he had interacted with quite a number of people. However, among these people, the only person who Jian Wushuang was concerned about was Chen Hu.

Divine Light Dynasty, Rising Sun Palace.

Even though eighteen thousand long years had passed, the Rising Sun Palace still existed and it was even more powerful than it was in the past.

In addition, the current Palace Master of the Rising Sun Palace was Chen Hu!

Over the past eighteen thousand years, his abilities had risen greatly. At that very moment, not only was he recognized as the strongest person by the Divine Light Dynasty, he also possessed the right to stand at the top in the whole Qing Tian Mystery Land.

“Compared to the past, this little kid has become more mature and sedated. He really has the look of a Sect Master,” Jian Wushuang was floating high up in the skies of the Rising Sun Palace Sect. As he looked at everything below him, he had already released his Soul Power and observed everything within the Rising Sun Palace a long time ago.

Naturally, he also saw Chen Hu, who was reprimanding two Elders in the lofty palace.

“Hu Zi,” Jian Wushuang opened his mouth.

The voice passed by the void and many halls into the highest part of the towering palace into Chen Hu’s ears.

Chen Hu, who was scolding the two Elders, could not help but be stunned.

Hu Zi?

It had been very long since someone had called him by that name.

It had been about eighteen thousand years. Ever since his Master, who he was greatly indebted to, had left the Rising Sun Palace, no one had called him by that name again.

At that very moment… A familiar voice and a familiar way of addressing him.

“Master, Master!”

“Is it really you?”

Hu Zi stood up straight away and his voice was extremely emotional.

This caused the Elders in the big palace to become stupefied.

They were all pleading for their lives and they did not know what had happened to the Palace Master.

As for the Master who he had mentioned?

Some Elders who had served in the Rising Sun Palace for a very long time thought of a person. The person was a supreme person who had appeared unexpectedly within the Divine Light Dynasty.

However, the supreme person had left ages ago. At that very moment, could he have returned?

“Master,” Chen Hu was still extremely emotional and he did not care about how the Elders would change their perceptions of him.

“Hu Zi, listen up.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice echoed in Chen Hu’s ears, “You were the first person I saw when I first appeared in this world. At the same time, you are also the only person in this world who has interacted a lot with me. Although you and I are not Master and disciple, you are still considered to be my partial disciple. Today, I am about to leave. However, before I leave, let me tell you something. If you have the time, return back to your previous home to your mother and little sister’s burial ground. I have left some opportunities as well as a test there for you!”

“If you have the ability to clear the test in the future, I will accept you as my disciple for real. Moreover, I will also bring you to the vast world that I am in. However, if you are unable to clear it, this means that we are not destined to be together. With that, please take care of yourself.”

After his speech, Jian Wushuang’s voice disappeared completely.

As for Chen Hu, he became stupefied at his position and at the next moment, his eyes started to glow brilliantly.

He could not help but clench his fists as well.

“Master, don’t worry. I will definitely pass the test and obtain your approval!”
