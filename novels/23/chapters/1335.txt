Chapter 1336: Finally Made It!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Humph, you’d better be praying that we, Snow Dojo, will win this ranking battle. Otherwise, I will tear off your skin!”

Wu Cang heard the Master of Silence Gloriette’s raging voice and he trembled. He wore an anguished look as he thought, “Jian Wushuang, you are getting me into trouble!”

Next to Wu Cang was Wu Chao, who was always competing with him. He laughed mischievously, “Humph, didn’t you want Jian Wushuang to join the battle back then? Now, I shall see how you’d take care of this.”

Among the people in the training field, Dong Ao looked extremely sullen and said, “Jian Wushuang, if you were to continue to lose, I shall see how you are going to die when the ranking battle ends!”

Jian Wushuang had already arrived at the Dark Sea and he noticed that something wasn’t right.

“This sea seems to be the border of Mountain Rock World?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Although he wasn’t familiar with Mountain Rock World, when he was watching the two ranking battles earlier, he saw the sea from the images.

The geniuses from both parties never came here in every battle.

“I think I took the wrong way.”

Jian Wushuang clicked his tongue and turned around to walk back.

“I hope I can reach it in time.”

Jian Wushuang felt helpless too.

In Mountain Rock World, both parties were having a ferocious fight. However, the winning balance was tipping over Universe God Palace all the time.

“Sigh, Snow Dojo is going to lose!”

“Even Long Hao was injured. He is quite badly injured and it’ll be difficult for him to recover. There seems to be no struggle point for Snow Dojo.”

“Look, Universe God Palace is approaching. The final battle is going to begin.”

Before everyone’s gaze, in one of the images, there were seven representatives from Universe God Palace who were alive. They were meeting up with Snow Dojo’s representatives.

There were only five representatives from Snow Dojo who had gathered there. The other four were eliminated, while Jian Wushuang had yet to reach there.

Among the five representatives, three were severely injured. That included Long Hao, who was the strongest of all.

On the other hand, Universe God Palace maintained their team pretty well. There were still seven of them left. Their power was too vastly different.

“Don’t give up. We can hold them back by using a strong formation until Long Hao recovers completely. We still have a chance!”

The few geniuses from Snow Dojo kept pressing even though they were at such a disadvantage. They didn’t intend to give up. Among the five geniuses, there was one who was an expert in formation. He immediately set up a formation and they continued to fight against the representative from Universe God Palace with the aid of power derived from the formation.

But the sight looked just like they were fighting desperately like a cornered wild beast.

“Haha, Long Hao, you still don’t want to give up at such state?” A burst of taunting laughter was heard from outside the formation. The one who spoke was Lu Qing from Universe God Palace, “From the previous ranking battle, you were defeated by me. This time, you will be heavily defeated.”

“You don’t stand a chance!”

The few geniuses from Universe God Palace were beaming with joy. Under Lu Qing’s lead, they suppressed the formation and it was going to be routed soon.

Once the formation was routed, the remaining geniuses would fight face-to-face. Then, Snow Dojo would definitely be trounced.

Just then, there was a figure that appeared in the sky.

“Oh? The lost guy is finally on the battlefield.”

“Haha, he’s finally here. But, he’s too late!”

“The die is cast. Snow Dojo doesn’t stand a chance. Even if the little guy came here in time, it wouldn’t be much help to Snow Dojo.”

“Including this session of ranking battle that Universe God Palace won, we are in a winning strike of six battles. Tsk tsk!”

Everyone on the training field complemented.

Jian Wushuang who appeared at the border of the battlefield in the image, saw the situation of the battlefield.

“Luckily. Although I’m a little late, I got here in time,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and Blood Mountain Sword immediately appeared in his hand.

He was clear with the situation of the battlefield before his eyes.

He knew that the geniuses from Snow Dojo couldn’t hold on any longer. At such a crucial moment, he had to take action.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang moved towards the battlefield before him like a flowing light.

The geniuses from both parties noticed his arrival that instant as well.

“It’s Jian Wushuang?”

“It’s him!”

“He only came to meet us now?”

The few geniuses from Snow Dojo was burning with rage.

They didn’t see Jian Wushuang during the meeting at Blood Fire Pinnacle earlier and they thought Jian Wushuang was killed and eliminated by the people from Universe God Palace on his way there.

But then they realized that Jian Wushuang was still surviving in Mountain Rock World.

If he wasn’t eliminated, why didn’t he meet us earlier?

“Forget it. Better late than never,” Long Hao sighed and shouted, “Quick, Jian Wushuang, come into the formation. Work together to resist Universe God Palace’s attack. Wait ’til I recover to my peak, we still stand a chance!”

“Jian Wushuang, hurry up.” The other geniuses from Snow Dojo shouted too.

When Jian Wushuang heard Long Hao shouting, his pupils contracted and he quickly thought. The very next moment, he didn’t reply to Long Hao and the rest, nor did he enter the formation. He wielded the Blood Mountain Sword and charged towards the seven geniuses from Universe God Palace.

That sight astonished Long Hao and the rest.

On the training field outside Mountain Rock World, everyone saw Jian Wushuang’s movement and they were all shocked. Then, it was followed by a roar of laughter.

“This boy is really silly, huh?”

“According to the situation now, if he were to enter the formation to resist the attack together as Long Hao said, they might really stand a chance. Who knew that the guy would charge towards the geniuses from Universe God Palace alone.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“He was already lost before, to the point where he got to the Dark Sea. Now that he finally made it in time to the final battle, he looks even more lost.”

Many spectators were entertained with Jian Wushuang’s movement.

On the stand, the Master of Silence Gloriette’s face grew grave. An unusually terrifying aura was spiraling around him, and he was still holding it back before it exploded entirely.

The other experts from Snow Dojo looked extremely embarrassed too.

On the battlefield in Mountain Rock World, those geniuses from Universe God Palace saw Jian Wushuang charged towards them alone.

The seven geniuses found it strange too.

“Who knew there would be a fish out of the net.”

“Who the hell is this? Why haven’t I seen him before?”

“Who cares. If he has a death wish, grant it to him. Kill him.”

The seven geniuses from Universe God Palace locked into their target, Jian Wushuang. Just as they prepared to take action, Jian Wushuang who came before them… Suddenly wielded his sword!
