Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

“The Heavenly Void realm was originally larger and more powerful than our Pill Sun Sacred World.”

Yin Su’er’s voice echoed throughout the entire hall, “When father was still alive, our Pill Sun Sacred World was at its peak. Compared to the Heavenly Void Realm, our Pill Sun Sacred World was slightly weaker. Moreover, the strength of the Heavenly Void Palace Master was also slightly stronger than father.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Since my father died, our Pill Sun Sacred World’s overall strength has plummeted. In recent years, we have been engaged in internal battles. During the internal strife, our Crimson Rock Castle has even lost control of the entire sacred world. It can be said that our sacred world has suffered a great loss

“Although the internal strife has subsided and our sacred world has regained its absolute control, our sacred world’s strength has not recovered. It is still at its lowest point. If the Heaven Void World takes the opportunity to attack us, our sacred world will have a hard time contending against it.”

Hearing this, Jian wushuang, Yun Shan, and Palace Master Si Zhen’s faces darkened.

“Don’t the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow have some potential agreements and agreements? Does the Heaven Void Palace really dare to invade our Saint Realm?” Palace Master Si Zhen asked.

“It’s true that there are agreements between the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, but most of them only restrict the Immortal Saints of each realm. As for the forces under their control, there are no restrictions. Therefore, as long as the Heaven Void Palace Master doesn’t show himself, he will let his experts fight to expand the territory. This is not a violation of the agreement,” Yin Su’er said.

At this moment...

Yin Su’er’s expression suddenly changed. “Oh no!”

“What’s Wrong?” Jian Wushuang, Yun Shan, and Palace Master Si Zhen immediately looked over.

“I just received a message from a good friend,” Yin Su’er said in a low voice, “I met this good friend when I was adventuring in the outside world. He’s from the Heavenly Void World, but he’s not from the Heavenly Void Palace. He just learned that the Master of the Heavenly Void Palace has personally issued an order and has begun to gather the Heavenly Void Army. It seems that he’s making a big move.”

“The Heavenly Void Army?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

“It is the strongest army under the control of the Heavenly Void Palace, just like the Crimson Rock Army in our Crimson Rock Castle. But the Heavenly Void Army is even stronger than the Crimson Rock Army!” Yin Su’er said solemnly, “As far as I know, the Heavenly Void Army has always maintained the size of 2,000 people and has many experts. Even if it is just an ordinary soldier, he is usually an Advanced Divine Master or even a Peak Divine Master. The captain of the 10-man team is usually a Great Divine Master!”

“What?” Jian Wushuang was also shocked.

In a 2,000-man army, the weakest ordinary soldier was an Advanced Divine Master.

The captain of the 10-man team was a Great Divine Master?

Did that mean that there were 200 Great Divine Masters in the 2,000-man Heavenly Void Army?

“How is it possible that there are so many Great Divine Masters and Divine Masters under the command of the Heavenly Void Palace?” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

“Of course it’s possible,” Yin Su’er said directly. “The Heavenly Void Palace has always been the leader of the Heavenly Void World. The Master of the Heavenly Void Palace controls everything, and the territory of the Heavenly Void World is much larger than that of our Pill Sun Sacred World. Naturally, more than 80 percent of the experts are under the command of the Master of the Heavenly Void World. There are also various forces in the Heavenly Void World, but the experts of these forces follow the lead of the Heavenly Void Palace. Many experts in the Heavenly Void Army come from these forces.”

“It can be said that the Heavenly Void Army is formed by gathering the power of the entire Heavenly Void Realm. It’s not difficult to find 200 Great Divine Masters in such a huge Heavenly Void Realm.”

Jian Wushuang nodded secretly.

Indeed, take the current Pill Sun Sacred World for example.

Even though it had been in internal strife for many years and its vitality had been greatly damaged, the Great Divine Masters in the Pill Sun Sacred World... Crimson Rock Castle, Sword Alliance, the four top forces, as well as many first-rate forces on the Pill Sun Continent, and even a large number of solitary experts... adding them all up, there were still quite a number of them.

It was just that these forces were currently unable to be completely controlled by the Crimson Rock Castle.

However, in the Heavenly Void World, many great Divine Masters were mostly under the command of the Heavenly Void Temple Master.

He had formed such a tyrannical Heavenly Void Army, so it naturally became a reality.

“The Heavenly Void Army’s combat strength is extremely tyrannical,” Yin Su’er continued.

“Even at its peak, there is still a huge gap between the Crimson Rock Army formed by thousands of elite Divine Masters and dozens of Advanced Divine Masters and the Heavenly Void Army. Now, the combat strength of the Crimson Rock Army is not as good as before. Let’s not talk about the Advanced Divine Masters. Just the Divine Masters... There are still a few people in the Crimson Rock Army formed by Peak Divine Masters. They can’t compare to the Heavenly Void Army at all.”

“The Heavenly Void Army rarely makes a move in the Heavenly Void realm, even on a small scale. However, according to the information I got this time, the Heavenly Void Army has made a huge ruckus. Half of the 2,000-man army seems to have gathered... a 1,000-man Heavenly Void Army can’t be here to deal with the internal changes in the Heavenly Void Realm. It must be for a war!”

“Considering the arrival of Marquis of Three Yin, the Heavenly Void Army is most likely coming for our Pill Sun Sacred World.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang and Palace Master Si Zhen’s expressions became unusually heavy.

The Heavenly Void Army’s combat strength was too terrifying.

Even if half of the 2,000-man army had come, there would still be over a hundred Great Divine Masters. If such an army came to the Pill Sun Sacred World and was personally led by the Marquis of Three Yin, it would be impossible to wipe out the current Pill Sun Sacred World, it was not impossible.

“What should we do?” Palace Master Si Zhen was extremely anxious and immediately thought of a countermeasure.

“What should come will come, and there’s nothing we can do to change it. Now, we can only think of a way to deal with the Heavenly Void Army.” Yun Shan narrowed his eyes.

“Right.” Yin Su’er nodded. “Actually, we are already considered lucky. Fortunately, Mister Sword One was strong enough to get rid of the Marquis of Three Yin. The Marquis of Three Yin probably knows that he can’t do anything to Sword One. Once he attacks, Sword One can completely stop him, which is why he asked the Heavenly Void Palace Master to gather the Heavenly Void Army.”

“If Sword One did not stop the Marquis of Three Yin, the Marquis of Three Yin would have killed all the higher-ups of our Crimson Rock Castle with his own strength. However, he only needed to bring people to take over the territory of our Pill Sun Sacred World.”

“And now, even though the Heavenly Void Army is extremely powerful, it will still take some time to gather them. Our Pill Sun Sacred World still has some time to prepare.. As long as we think of a way to unite all the factions and experts of the Pill Sun Sacred World, we might have a chance of winning even if we fight the Heavenly Void Army head-on.”
