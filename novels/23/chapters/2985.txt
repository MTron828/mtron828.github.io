Chapter 2986: Embryonic Form of Swordsmanship

—— FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“My Lord, the Heavenly Sword Marquis has arrived.” The violet-haired devilish youth stared at the elderly figure, his eyes flashing with reverence.

“Mm, you may leave.” The elderly figure waved his hand, and the violet-haired devilish youth immediately turned around and left.

After his death, the elderly figure slowly turned around, revealing an elderly face.

He had white hair and looked like he had entered his twilight years. However, his vitality was abnormally strong. His deep eyes were like black explosions, full of vigor. His aura was extremely unique as if he had been through endless wind and rain, he had experienced vicissitudes of life.

At this moment, the vicissitudes of life elder were staring at Jian Wushuang with interest. “As expected, he is only a Divine Master.”

The vicissitude elder felt a trace of joy in his heart.

He had just come, so he was not too sure about Jian Wushuang’s talent and strength.

Because they had not seen Jian Wushuang in person before, they could not determine whether Jian Wushuang was really just a Divine Master.

But now that he had seen it with his own eyes, he could sense that Jian Wushuang was indeed just a Divine Master.

If an existence like him could not see any flaws, then Jian Wushuang must be just a Divine Master.

“I am Mo Shan from the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces!” The weathered elder said.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, greetings, sir.” Jian Wushuang was extremely respectful.

When he saw the weathered Elder Mo Shan, he could already tell that the latter was a genuine rule master!

Rule Masters were the top existences in the entire Divine Beginning World. They were all super experts who could intimidate everyone.

How could such a super expert come to the endless territory in person?

“Little guy, look at this first.” Mo Shan waved his hand casually, and a huge mirror image immediately appeared around him.

In the mirror image, Jian Wushuang and Prince Qian Chen were fighting head-on.

Jian Wushuang was very familiar with this scene and recognized it at a glance.

What Jian Wushuang did not know was why Mo Shan took out the mirror image token.

“Little guy, you have a good understanding of the reincarnation rule and have obtained a sword formation that is very suitable for you to use. You have perfectly displayed your understanding of the reincarnation rule, but in terms of the space-time rule, you have a lot of room for improvement,” Mo Shan explained.

“Let’s not talk about the space-time rules. Just in terms of swordsmanship… If I’m not wrong, it shouldn’t be too long for your comprehension of the sword principle to reach the second stage, the boundless sword tree.”

“It’s not too long,” Jian Wushuang admitted.

“That’s right. His comprehension of the sword principle is not very high, but the power of your sword tree is very strong. It’s not surprising that your foundation is too strong. Although you have just broken through, the boundless sword skill in your body is at least 20,000 feet high. Only such a powerful boundless sword tree can make your swordsmanship so strong,” Mo Shan said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

Mo Shan seemed to have seen through him with just a mirror image of his fierce battle with Prince Qian Chen.

His comprehension of the sword principle was indeed not very high. As for why his swordsmanship was so powerful, that was his innate advantage.

His boundless swordsmanship was 3,300 feet tall, which was much more powerful than many top True Saints.

“Your comprehension of laws and Sword Dao has already surpassed Divine Masters, and some have even reached the True Saint level. Logically speaking, you should already have the conditions to break through to become an Immortal Saint. However, it is precisely because your talent is too high and your potential is too great that you still have some room for improvement!”

“If I’m not wrong, the space for improvement lies in the absolute art you created. You must create a stronger absolute art so that your strength can be saturated. Only then can you find an opportunity to make a breakthrough,” Mo Shan added.

“It’s like this.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “I’m also thinking of creating a stronger sword art.”

“Since you want to create swordsmanship, I can give you a suggestion,” Mo Shan said.

Jian Wushuang listened carefully.

“You can try to tear and cut your swordsmanship,” Mo Shan said. “In the picture, when you were fighting with the little guy, the sword essence that you burst out was mainly sharp. Even the natal magic weapon in your hand is most terrifying because of its sharpness. The sword essence and magic weapon are both the same. Naturally, the swordsmanship that you created should be mainly about tearing and cutting.”

“Or if you have the time and energy, you can even create a complete set of swordsmanship.”

“Create a complete set of swordsmanship?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Yes.” Mo Shan smiled and said, “Swordsmanship can be used to attack, defend, cut, and explode. It can be involved in all aspects. It’s only because of the relationship between your sword essence and the use of magic weapons that I mind you taking the path of tearing and cutting. But in fact, if you have the time and energy and good perception, you can try to create a complete set of swordsmanship that involves all aspects.”

“Once such swordsmanship has an outline, it can be improved and perfected as one’s comprehension of the rules and swordsmanship improves. The power of this swordsmanship will naturally become stronger and stronger. In the future, you don’t need to spend so much time creating new swordsmanship. Not only can it save time, but it can also make your swordsmanship more complete.”

Upon hearing Mo Shan’s words, Jian Wushuang’s expression became solemn.

Creating a complete sword art and improving it in the future?

It was not that Jian Wushuang had not thought of this method.

However, a complete sword art must involve all aspects and have a complete embryonic form. This embryonic form was the most important.

Just like how a person built a house, how high and how strong the building was depended on the foundation.

If the foundation was not firm, the house could easily collapse.

The same was true for swordsmanship. If Jian Wushuang really wanted to complete the step mentioned by Mo Shan, it would not be easy.

After all, his current swordsmanship involved the rules and sword principles, which were unfathomable. Under such circumstances, it was not difficult for him to just create an embryonic form. The key was that this embryonic form had a lot of room for growth, it would be much more difficult for him to keep improving.

Previously, Jian Wushuang did not have the confidence to create such an embryonic form of swordsmanship. But now, despite Mo Shan’s suggestion, he still did not have the confidence.

“Little guy, your talent is very high. This embryonic form of sword principle should not be difficult for you. At most, it will only take a little time. But if you continue to pursue a higher level of swordsmanship, it will be easy for you to create more powerful swordsmanship now, but it will be difficult in the future,” Mo Shan said.
