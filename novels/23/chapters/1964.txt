Once Great Emperor Colored Glaze understood that, she made up her mind.

“Go away!!”

Great Emperor Colored Glaze bellowed and the chilliness in her body flowed out. The boundless chilliness substantiated before her and formed three Ice Dragons.

Every single one of the three Ice Dragons was ten thousand miles in length and they gave out billowing auras. Anyone of them could easily kill an Emperor God.

Then, as Great Emperor Colored Glaze controlled the three Ice Dragons, they let out a bellow and instantly plunged at Jian Yi.

Dealing with three Ice Dragons, Jian Yi didn’t act recklessly but launched a full hit to match him evenly.

However, just as he prepared to deal with the three Ice Dragons, Great Emperor Colored Glaze took a huge step back. Then, she turned to charge at Jian Wushuang.

A terrifying chilliness and cold aura instantly covered Jian Wushuang.

Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s eyes which were fixed upon Jian Wushuang turned cold too.

Looking at Great Emperor Colored Glaze charging at him, Jian Wushuang’s eyes dilated in shock but he didn’t panic.

He flipped his hand and there was a bronze mirror that let out an ancient aura in his hand, the Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror.

He had just gotten the Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror not too long ago and it was his first time displaying its power outside.

Rumble. Boundless divine power flowed into the bronze mirror and the five godly spirits in the bronze mirror were woken up by Jian Wushuang. Then, they plunged out.

Tall dark shadows substantiated in the void. There was a total of five.

Plus, all the five dark shadows were huge and every single one was more than five meters tall. They gave out chilly aura as though they were from Acheron.

“Five godly spirits, stop her!”

At Jian Wushuang’s command, the five dark shadows lifted their heads at the same time.

In their eye sockets, there weren’t eyeballs. There was only dancing ghostly fire. That very moment, the ghostly fire was churning and it seemed rather impatient.

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong!

The five godly spirits moved simultaneously.

In the first instance, they formed a Five Fire Formation.

Once they appeared before Great Emperor Colored Glaze, the power of the five godly spirits and Five Fire Formation exploded.

After a loud bang, the five godly spirits took a step back at the same time.

However, Great Emperor Colored Glaze was stopped.

“What’s that?”

Great Emperor Colored Glaze looked at the five godly spirits that had appeared in front of her in shock.

She could tell that the five godly spirits weren’t war puppets, nor were they real. They should have existed in a unique way.

Plus, the fighting power of each godly spirit wasn’t too strong and they should be a distance from a Great Emperor. However, when the five godly spirits joined forces with the aid of the formation, the pressure that they brought to her was not weaker than an ordinary Great Emperor’s. In terms of power and strength, they might even be stronger than Jian Yi had been previously.

“Jian Wushuang has such powerful treasure?”

Great Emperor Colored Glaze couldn’t help but steal a glance at the bronze mirror in Jian Wushuang’s hand.

She knew that the five godly spirits had popped out from the bronze mirror.

The five godly spirits had joined forces and possessed the fighting power of a Great Emperor.

“Die!”

The five godly spirits were raging with anger. They were refined into spirits via brutal methods. All their lives, they wouldn’t be able to shake it off. To them, it was absolutely more painful than death. Over the years, they had naturally accumulated boundless hatred and cruelty.

The hatred was taken out on their opponents.

The five godly spirits formed Five Fire Formation and fought with Great Emperor Colored Glaze. At the same time, Jian Yi had already taken care of the three Ice Dragons and he was charging at Great Emperor Colored Glaze.

When they joined forces, it equaled the fighting power of two Great Emperors.

Although Great Emperor Colored Glaze was on the sixth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, she was considered the stronger one among Great Emperors. However, she wasn’t capable enough to fight two Great Emperors at the same time.

Plus, Jian Yi and the five godly spirits displayed fighting power that wasn’t weak.

In a short while, Great Emperor Colored Glaze was already suppressed.

“D*mn it!!!”

Great Emperor Colored Glaze looked cold as there was fire burning in her eyes.

However, no matter how angry she was, fighting power was on display. She was really not capable enough to match evenly with Jian Yi and the five godly spirits.

Even under Jian Yi and the five godly spirits’ pressure, she wanted to find a chance to attack Jian Wushuang but she had failed to do so.

“Colored Glaze, do you want to continue to fight?” Jian Wushuang stood in the void nearby as he humphed coldly.

“B*stard!” Great Emperor Colored Glaze was angry but she couldn’t do anything to Jian Wushuang.

“Humph. You’re so stubborn. You really think that I can’t make you, a Great Emperor, stay?” Jian Wushuang’s voice became cold, “Don’t forget that my sword servant and I cultivated the Secret Skill of Star Palace!”

“Secret Skill of Star Palace?” Great Emperor Colored Glaze stunned.

She naturally knew about the Secret Skill of Star Palace. She also knew that Jian Wushuang had cultivated the third volume of Secret Skill of Star Palace successfully. Back then, with that one move, he had wiped out almost a hundred Almighties from Almighties Alliance with one hit. His power had already reached the extreme limit of a Great Emperor.

In Eternal Chaotic World, besides Emperor bai and the mysterious Emperor Thirteen, they reckoned no one could perform such an attack.

Now, she was against Jian Yi and five godly spirits. She was already suppressed entirely. By then, if Jian Wushuang were to attack again, attack at that level, her life might be threatened even though she was a Great Emperor.

“I will count to three. If you don’t retreat, I’ll immediately launch my killer hit. Don’t think I’m joking,” Jian Wushuang’s voice was low. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“One!”

“Two!”

Jian Wushuang had yet to count to three.

Great Emperor Colored Glaze, who was fighting with Jian Yi and five godly spirits ferociously, suddenly retreated.

As she retreated, her cold voice resounded in the universe, “Jian Wushuang, I am defeated. But don’t be too happy just yet. You think you’ll be able to protect Green Fire World on your own?”

“You are dreaming!”

“Just you wait. In no time, I will return!”

Her voice continued to reverberate.

Then, Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s body disappeared at the end of the sky.

In the void in front of Green Fire World, Jian Wushuang stood. His face grew grave when he heard what Great Emperor Colored Glaze said.

He hadn’t lied earlier. If he were to perform his trump card without scruples, he was confident that he could make Great Emperor Colored Glaze stay forever.

However, there was no use if she stayed. The secret of Green Fire World would be exposed. Even if he killed Great Emperor Colored Glaze then, there would be other Great Emperor or experts who would come. He might as well save the final trump card to deal with the upcoming danger.

Plus, a Great Emperor expert was associated with many. Anyone’s pass would stir a great commotion and inflict a great outcome.
