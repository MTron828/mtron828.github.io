Chapter 5515 ¬†Origin Source of All Things

There, everything turned into the plunder of the black hole, which is why so many powerful beings continuously poured into the secret realms of the universe.

Jian Wushuang stood above the secret realm at this moment, the aura of life getting closer.

"What exactly is hidden here?"

He was becoming impatient. After all, it was just a clone, and there was nothing to fear. He plunged straight in.

Upon entering the secret realm, he discovered that the space and time here were even more stable.

Complete space, vast time, and life?

Jian Wushuang's eyes narrowed suddenly.

He gained a rough understanding of the hierarchy of life.

His current life force could, at most, be utilized on himself.

But here, life could be nurtured. What did that signify?

Life was born from the Origin Source of a Universe Master. This probably marked a unique path, unprecedented like his own.

This kind of origin had its peculiarities‚Äîit surpassed those powerful beings following predetermined paths in realms where it shouldn't exist.

Although Jian Wushuang didn't know much about the realm of the Universe Master, after observing numerous Universe Origin Sources, he had some understanding.

In ordinary Universe Origin Sources, the descent of the true meaning of time would make one a formidable Universe Master. ViiSiit nùíêvelbùíä/n(.)c/(ùíê)m for lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvels

In the Origin Source of all things, if there was the true meaning of time, it proved that the original master of All Things was already among the supreme Universe Masters.

However, in his secret realm, it was more than just a complete space; it had its own mysteries.

The embodiment of the true meaning of time and a stable flow of time could give birth to life.

This is quite exaggerated.

It has already surpassed the rules of the Universe Master.

Jian Wushuang swallowed hard. He, too, a Dao Lord, not only transcended in spatial dimensions but also bypassed the true meaning of time, mastering the power of Life.

Although the current power of Life was still weak, unable to be infused into the Origin Source at all, once his Spatial Origin Source gained the recognition of the true meaning of time, he could directly infiltrate the power of life into it.

By that time, he would be able to ascend, directly surpassing those conventional Universe Masters.

Jian Wushuang's hands were trembling. Seeing this scene, he felt well-prepared for his own future, a very complete path.

This trip was not in vain.

The Origin Source of All Things, Beiwang Tower.

Indeed, it was a great blessing for him.

He increasingly yearned to obtain this complete Origin Source of All Things.

"I'd like to see what has been nurtured here!" Jian Wushuang lifted the natural rules arranged in this place with his hands.

The rules of the universe covered the truth here.

If he hadn't mastered the power of Life, he wouldn't have been able to detect life incubating here at all.

Without the power of All Things, he couldn't enter it either.

In either case, he wouldn't be able to come in.

As the rule power dissipated, Jian Wushuang's eyes penetrated into it.

With just one glance, cold sweat broke out on his back. The life contained inside made his whole body tremble.

"Go!"

Jian Wushuang didn't hesitate at all, instantly dissolving his clone. At the very first moment, his true self entered the teleportation array.

Phew!

Seeing the figure in front of him moving, Jian Wushuang finally relaxed.

The mighty Emperor reigning over this domain was somewhat surprised. He hadn't expected Jian Wushuang to emerge so quickly. The flow of time inside was the same as the outside world, and not even a day had passed since Jian Wushuang entered.

Each opportunity for comprehension lasted only a day. Most people couldn't grasp it in time, but someone like Jian Wushuang, a Dao Lord defying the heavens, seemed indifferent.

After all, with numerous points in hand, he could easily afford to purchase the Origin Source of All Things.

"Your Lordship Jian Wushuang, you've completed your comprehension so quickly; indeed, extraordinary!" A black-robed old man flattered, followed by a smile.

Jian Wushuang, at this moment, was like a startled bird, not willing to stay a moment longer. He nodded and left directly.

After leaving Beiwang Tower, he headed straight for the Demon Sound Mountain.

Upon reaching the Demon Sound Mountain, he headed directly to the Demon-Sealing Space at the mountain's summit.

With Wu Zuo absent, he could only seek out Divine General Moyin.

Buzz!

The figure of the Demon Sound Divine General was still sitting cross-legged in the Demon-Sealing Space. Jian Wushuang, upon arriving, finally breathed a sigh of relief.

"Lord Divine General, I wish to see Zhen Ling!" Jian Wushuang stated the reason without hesitation.

Divine General Moyin was quite surprised and asked, "Is it for the Origin Source of All Things?"

"Yes, this matter is crucial!" Jian Wushuang's gaze was firm.

Once that life conceived successfully, it would be challenging for the current Qishen Temple to resist. Moreover, the emitted power was too formidable, surpassing all the experts he had encountered.

Even stronger than the supreme-peak experts.

Not even Divine General Moyin, an Ultimate Emperor among supreme-peak experts, possessed such terror.

On the side of Divine General Moyin, there was some difficulty.

He had heard about Jian Wushuang's matter from Dongsheng and Wanyan, but he didn't believe that Jian Wushuang could obtain the Origin Source of All Things.

The Origin Source of All Things was crucial to Beiwang Tower; it was the pinnacle of the universe. Initially, it was the renowned treasure in the hands of the master of All Things, and its power could rival the nine great Beast God Weapons.

He thought Jian Wushuang had sought him out to demand the Origin Source of All Things, and he felt somewhat reluctant.

Even if he communicated with Zhen Ling, he doubted that Zhen Ling would pay him any attention.

What Emperor Lu Hua would usually say, this time, was uttered by the Divine General Moyin.

"Jian Wushuang, your current strength is insufficient to control the Origin Source of All Things. When you integrate everything through cultivation, everything will fall into place. Don't be anxious for a moment!" Divine General Moyin advised.

Jian Wushuang remained firm; he insisted on meeting Zhen Ling.

Because within the Origin Source of All Things, there was an incubating life, a giant egg identical to the one that birthed Shen Ling.

The Three Kings Court was destroyed in this way initially, and he didn't want to see the Qishen Temple become like the Three Kings Court.

And now, he was in the Qishen Temple!

He didn't want the Origin Source of All Things, but he had to bring this matter to the attention of Zhen Ling.

The shell of that giant egg had started to crack, and it was estimated that life inside would soon emerge.

At that time, everyone would be in deep trouble.

He didn't know if this was the plan of Shen Ling or the conspiracy of Fuego, but it was detrimental to the Qishen Temple either way.

This matter was of great significance, and he couldn't speak of it until he saw Zhen Ling.

There might be a mole in the Elder's Palace capable of letting the giant egg infiltrate the Origin Source of All Things, and everyone in the Qishen Temple suspected it. He didn't dare to take that risk.

"Divine General, it's not because of the Origin Source of All Things; there are other matters I need to report to Zhen Ling!" Jian Wushuang said tactfully.

Divine General Moyin seemed somewhat skeptical, but since Jian Wushuang was so determined and didn't overthink like some of the Palace Masters in the Elder's Palace, he directly communicated the information to Zhen Ling.

On the side of Zhen Ling, they were currently plotting another matter. Upon receiving the message from Divine General Moyin, they glanced at it but didn't pay any attention.
