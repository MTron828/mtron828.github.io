Chapter 608: Universal Thunder Sect

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

All the experts, including Dark Emperor, Bone Dragon Emperor and the present experts from the Darkness Temple, looked at Su Ming with admiration.

In normal circumstances, if they wanted to go to the Eternal World, they had to desperately fight for an Ancient World Token, and then had to wait for the commencement of the Firmament Territory Feast to enter the Eternal World. In addition, even though they took part in the Firmament Territory Feast, only the people who did very well and the most brilliant talents could get the chance to enter powerful sects. Most of the people who were going to the Eternal World would become cannon fodder.

But Su Ming... He could directly enter the Eternal World and the Universal Thunder Sect just because he obtained an opportunity left by an expert of the Eternal World, and he could even be guided by an expert. His luck was really heaven defying.

“I wanted to stay longer in the Ancient World, but...” Su Ming said, and looking at Jian Wushuang with incomparably cold eyes.

Anyway, he had just broken through and reached the Skyscraping Realm. Indeed, he was not in a hurry to enter the Eternal World.

His original plan was to stay for another several hundred years in the Ancient World, where he could enjoy being a top expert. Anyway, when he arrived in the Eternal World, where there were countless experts, he, a Skyscraping Realm, would be as weak as an ant.

However, just because of Jian Wushuang, because of Jian Wushuang’s pressure, he had to choose to crush the Jade Slip now and directly enter the Eternal World.

“Su Ming, my junior brother, can you come along with me now?” Xue Yang asked.

“Xue Yang, my senior brother, speaking frankly, I have a deadly enemy in this Ancient World. Today, if you, my senior brother had not come, I’m afraid I would have become a dead body. If this man is not killed, I cannot go to the Universal Thunder Sect with a peaceful heart, so... I hope you can help me kill my enemy.” Su Ming said seriously.

“Oh?” Xue Yang raised his eyebrows, with his Scarlet Thunderbolt-eyes sweeping around.

Hearing what Su Ming said, Jian Wushuang looked concerned.

“Su Ming, my junior brother, who is your enemy? I can help you kill him.” Xue Yang directly said.

In this little Ancient World, no one could stop Xue Yang from doing anything.

He just needed to lift a finger to kill Su Ming’s enemy in the Ancient World. As soon as he thought Su Ming was the person Sect Master Lei Xin told him to guide, Xue Yang would not refuse at all.

“Thank you for your help, Xue Yang, my senior brother.”

Su Ming was very glad. He pointed to Jian Wushuang immediately. “Xue Yang, my senior brother, my enemy was him. I hope you kill him. I will be very grateful.”

“This little guy?” Xue Yang shot a glance at Jian Wushuang, with no emotion in his eyes, and said, “Little guy, as long as my junior brother wants you to die, you have to die!”

After saying this, Xue Yang reached out his hand and pointed a finger at Jian Wushuang.

A light Scarlet Thunderbolt whirled around him and burst out in an instant.

At that moment, Huahua... The Void directly collapsed, and many space rifts, which were as long as several miles, appeared.

More than a score of space rifts burst out immediately.

“The space in the Ancient World is so fragile.” Xue Yang smiled scornfully.

The sight of this caused the surrounding experts to gulp a deep breath.

Anyway, in their Ancient World, it was well recognized that Dark Emperor had the No. 1 offensive power. However, even the Secret Skill he created, his most powerful technique could only make a small space rift in the Void. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

But now, Xue Yang’s casual finger could produce power which was tens of thousands of times stronger than the Dark Emperor’s most powerful technique!

It was too terrifying!

With a single finger, he could destroy the entire earth and heaven!

“No!”

Jian Wushang’s face became pale. Seeing the finger which could destroy the world attacking him, despite desperately wanting to escape, he realized with terror?that no matter how he dodged, that finger would track and attack him.

The comprehension of Dao from this far exceeded his imagination.

“Jian Wushuang, accept your destiny and die!” Su Ming’s face looked ferocious, looking forward to seeing the scene where Jian Wushuang was completely killed.

However, just before the finger, which could destroy the world, really fell upon Jian Wushuang, the Void before Jian Wushuang suddenly broke and a hole appeared.

A giant hand came out from the hole and slapped that finger into pieces in an instant. Moreover, the power of the giant hand was not diminishing, and the hand continued to attack Xue Yang.

“What?”

Xue Yang, the purple-robed person with a superior posture, changed his face greatly at this moment. He had never thought that in this little Ancient World, someone could head-on stop his attack. As the giant hand approached him, he had no capacity to dodge at all.

Peng!

The giant hand slapped Xue Yang, and the latter immediately spouted out a mouthful of fresh blood, while his figure retreated in embarrassment.

At the same time, a grand voice with arrogance was heard from the hole, echoing between the earth and heaven.

“Universal Thunder Sect? Humph! How dare you! You dare attack the man who is valued by our Master Emperor Xiao! When there is a chance, I will visit your Sect Master Lei Xin for Master Emperor Xiao!”

The arrogant voice echoed between the earth and heaven, lingering for a long time, and terrifying everyone present.

“Emperor Xiao? Master Emperor Xiao?”

Xue Yang’s eyes widened, with a sense of terror. At this moment, he could not think about his own injuries. In a hurry, he looked at Su Ming and said, “Su Ming, junior brother, let’s go! Let’s go quickly!”

Shocked by that scene just now, Su Ming was stunned when he heard what Xue Yang said. He realized the terror on Xue Yang’s face. He dared not hesitate, and just directly stepped into the channel to the Eternal World following Xue Yang.

As a brilliant light flashed, Xue Yang and Su Ming disappeared out of everyone’s sight.

“Hoo.”

Watching Xue Yang leave, Bone Dragon Emperor let out a sigh of relief. “Lucky, it’s lucky that the master has been paying attention to the situation here and did something, or...”

Bone Dragon Emperor exclaimed. He knew that the person who had just attacked was Di Jing.

“Jian Wushuang, Su Ming has gone to the Eternal World. If you want to kill him, it seems that you have to wait.” Bone Dragon Emperor looked over to Jian Wushuang.

“Em.” Jian Wushuang was just standing still and looking at what was happening. he slightly nodded, with an icy cold face.

“Universal Thunder Sect!”

Jian Wushuang gripped his hands tightly, “Su Ming, you just wait, and I’ll pursue you in the Eternal World in a little while!”
