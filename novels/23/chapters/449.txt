Chapter 450: The Encounter in an Unknown Area

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The maze seemed to be boundless.

Jian Wushuang followed the route on the map and finally arrived at its outer layer.

In front of him was a bottomless abyss, above which a black rock bridge connected the two sides.

Jian Wushuang stared at the four statue-still figures on the bridge with narrowed eyes.?“Cross that bridge and I’ll get into the inner layer. However, it’s not easy.”

Those figures were Puppet Fighters and were as powerful as lords, and Jian Wushuang had to pass by them to enter the inner layer.

Sword Essence swept over from the Triple-kill Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand, and behind him, two Sword Soul Phantoms rose up high.

“Go!”

Jian Wushuang rushed toward the figures like a streak of flowing light, leaving his shadows behind.

The four Puppet Fighters opened their eyes just as Jian Wushuang stepped onto the bridge, their pupils flashing with green light.

Four whooshing sounds were heard before the puppets attacked Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s sword went dancing outward, and the flurry of blows looked like a peacock showing its tail.

“Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!”

There were four consecutive clashes of metal on metal, and the four puppets were held off for a while.

Jian Wushuang leaped twice, going around the puppets to their backs, and kept on moving. In no time, he crossed the bridge and stepped into the inner layer.

When he crossed the bridge, the four puppets again turned into motionless statues.

“Not that hard.”

Jian Wushuang looked back at the Puppet Fighters.

He felt that it was easy to pass by the four powerful puppets, and every expert as powerful as a lord would feel the same. But, if it had been to kill the puppets, it would have been a much more difficult challenge.

Therefore, he reckoned that the puppets had been left there to obstruct those who were weaker than a lord.

When Jian Wushuang arrived in the inner layer, he took out the map again.

“Just like the outer layer, the inner layer is also a maze consisting of secret chambers. The difference is that the chambers in the outer layer are empty, few contain opportunities or treasures, while those in the inner layer are the opposite.

“The marks on the map refer to the places that have been explored by other experts and where the opportunities and treasures have been taken away. I have to target those unexplored places to get my opportunities.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were fixed on the map.

He was interested in the areas that had not been explored and were full of uncertainties.

“Let’s begin.”

Staring at the three channels in front of him, he stepped onto the left one without thinking after taking a deep breath.

He marched forward courageously, for he was in a frequented area, where he could go off to the dangerous places that were marked on the map. One hour later, he arrived at an open space, and before him were nine different channels.

“From here onward, I’ll be in a place that hasn’t been explored.”?He looked grim as he surveyed the nine channels, and finally, he took the fourth path.

The channel was dark and wide, leading him to an unknown world full of mysteries.

Jian Wushuang slowed his pace and remained alert, studying the surroundings.

It was clear to him that any carelessness would put him in danger.

“Clomp! Clomp!”

Suddenly, he heard footsteps in front of him.

“Is there someone coming?”

He stopped moving and looked into the darkness with a solemn expression.

He guessed that he might encounter a lord of the two camps because most lords from the camps were trying their luck at those unexplored places in this mansion.

Soon, a bent figure came into his sight, whose token could not be sensed.

“He is from a rival camp.”?Jian Wushuang immediately became on his guard.

The figure approached him slowly and stopped 100 feet away.

“He is...”?Jian Wushuang stared fixedly at the figure, who was in a gray robe and had a weather-beaten face. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“He is Blackhill Lord from Marquis Cangyue’s camp.”

Jian Wushuang recognized the man at first glance due to a file that he had read. The file belonged to Deng Huo, a man he had killed, and in it was detailed information of many lords and experts.

“The Saint Realm?”

Blackhill Lord called out in amazement and stared at Jian Wushuang with sharp eyes.

“How can you, a boy in the Saint Realm, get into the inner layer? Who brought you in?” Blackhill Lord looked down at Jian Wushuang in an overbearing manner.

He thought it was impossible for a boy in the Saint Realm to break into the inner layer through the Puppet Fighters’ guard all by himself. It had to be with someone’s help, like a powerful lord.

“Blackhill Lord, are you questioning me?” Jian Wushuang answered, arms crossed in front of his chest, looking into the lord’s eyes.

“Questioning you? Yes, I am. So what?” Blackhill Lord wore a cold smile. “Boy, whoever brought in you here isn’t around now. You’re on your own, so why not be more humble?”

“Oh? Really?” Jian Wushuang did not take his suggestion.

“Why is he so arrogant in front of me?”?Blackhill Lord’s complexion looked strange as he looked Jian Wushuang up and down.

“So young and so arrogant... A boy in the Saint Realm with a longsword?”

A sliver of light flashed in Blackhill Lord’s eyes. Then he said, “I’ve heard that there is a new expert at the Heaven-defying Level in Marquis Piaoxue’s camp who is named Swordsman. It’s you, isn’t it?”
