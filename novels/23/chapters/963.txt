Chapter 964: Changes in Tang of the East (Part One)

Translator:?Transn?Editor:?Transn

Does Xuan Yi really only belong to the Eternal Realm Level?

Jian Wushuang had carried this question in his mind for a long time and had yet to find an answer for it. It was only until today that he found the courage to ask Xuan Yi for an answer.

“Ha ha” Xuan Yi laughed. “I’m definitely only at the Eternal Realm level. Any Dao Master may just kill me. Your current strength is much stronger than mine.”

Jian Wushuang was full of doubts.

Really? Merely of the Eternal Realm level?

“That’s all for now, there are some things that you don’t know now but soon, you will. Your current priority is to quickly restore your strength because Tang of the East is in big trouble. They are still waiting for you. “Xuan Yi laughed heartily before falling completely silent.

Hearing his master’s words, Jian Wushuang felt utterly helpless.

But he relaxed soon after.

“Master, no matter who you are, what your origin and background are, and no matter how strong you are, you are my master and will always be my master. Once a teacher, always a father!”?Jian Wushuang murmured in his heart.

Jian Wushuang was full of gratitude towards his master, a person who seemed to have no desire for anything.

His master had helped him a lot and saved him numerous times.

He decided that from that day onwards, no matter what his Master’s orders were, he would fulfill them to his best ability, as long as they did not violate his principles.

After finishing their talk, Jian Wushuang immediately recalled Xuan Yi’s words.

“Tang of the East is in big trouble?”

Deep in thought, Jian Wushuang fetched a message token from the Interspatial Ring.

This token belonged to Wang Yuan.

“Big Brother Wang Yuan.” Jian Wushuang sent his message over.

In the newly rebuilt Imperial Palace of Tang of the East, Wang Yuan sat in a secret chamber, concentrating on cultivating an elixir. Upon receiving Jian Wushuang’s message, he widened his eyes. He lost control of his fire and a huge bang was heard from inside the alchemy stove. The elixir he had been refining turned into ashes instantly.

But Wang Yuan did not care for this. He immediately retrieved Jian Wushuang’s message token.

“Third bother! Third brother!” Wang Yuan sounded elated. “It’s really you, did you not die?”

“It’s me.” Jian Wushuang replied.

“But, but I saw with my own eyes how you got blood everywhere!” Wang Yuan was in doubt.

“That does not mean I had died.” Jian Wushuang smiled wryly.

“Haha, yes.” Wang Yuan smiled in an almost crazy manner. “Great, great, you really are alive, I have to inform Second Brother immediately, and Emperor Xiao as well.”

“Don’t.” Jian Wushuang stopped him.

“What’s the matter?” Wang Yuan stopped in his tracks. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Big Brother Wang Yuan, I have a question to ask you. What is the situation in Tang of the East now?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The situation is not very optimistic.” Wang Yuan said gloomily, “Ten years ago, Emperor Xiao defeated and suppressed Emperor Leng, but Tang of the East lost its vigor and luck in the battle.”

“In that battle, the Xia Clan almost lost their battle strength completely too. They owned many treasures which many top clans yearned to possess. But the new Xia Clan Master was very capable. He managed to build an Immortal Army in a short period of time and fought against other clans.”

“In the past decade, Tang of the East has been in a state of chaos.”

“What about Emperor Xiao and Emperor Yun?” Jian Wushuang asked again, “With their presence in Tang of the East, no clans would dare to be presumptuous, right?”

“Third brother, things have changed. A long time ago, Emperor Xiao left Tang of the East. His status was gradually lost within the country. Even if he returns to Tang of the East now, he is no longer able to give commands because hardly anyone listens to him anymore.”

“Ten years ago, in the battle of the Imperial Palace, he and Emperor Yun were both injured by Dao Yuanzi. Now, the both of them remained only 30% of their original strength. They can no longer get others to surrender by martial force.”

“In addition, although Emperor Leng was suppressed, she had after all governed Tang of the East for many years. Recently, her numerous experts have been stirring up troubles in the country. Emperor Xiao had to suppress her experts with all his strength. He doesn’t have any more energy to deal with the rioting clans. He can only wait until his strength is completely restored.” Wang Yuan said.

“Is that so?”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

He did not expect that, in such a short time, Tang of the East would end up in such a plight.

Even Emperor Xiao and Emperor Yun could not summon full control over the situation.

“Tang of the East may be in a state of chaos, but since you’re still alive, you can help them.” Wang Yuan suddenly said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang appeared doubtful.

“Third Brother, you saved Tang of the East single-handedly 10 years ago. You were not far from a god in the eyes of the people there. Even today, people are still talking about you and your brave deeds. Countless young warriors in Tang of the East regard you as an example to be followed.”

“Besides, your strength is formidable, even though you had actually made used of a special method to be even more powerful 10 years back. But you achieved such power despite being so young and belonging only to the Eternal Realm level. When you become a Dao Master, what would it mean? It probably means that no one in the entire Eternal World can beat you.”

“You have high status and huge capabilities. You don’t have to do anything more. As long as you show up with Emperor Xiao in Tang of the East, and declare that you have survived and still support Emperor Xiao, which clans would still dare to be disrespectful? Who would dare to not listen to his order?” Wang Yuan said.

Hearing Wang Yuan’s words, Jian Wushuang was completely dumbfounded.

“Am, am I that influential in Tang of the East?” Jian Wushuang found it hard to believe.

“Come on.” King Gu suddenly voiced out. “Jian Wushuang, are you still not aware of what you have done? You killed a Blood Killing Sect expert. Even experts at the top of the Green Fire World dare not look down on you, not to mention the people in Tang of the East.

“More importantly, you are currently at the Eternal Realm level.”

“In the eyes of the people in the Green Fire World, you have immense potential!”
