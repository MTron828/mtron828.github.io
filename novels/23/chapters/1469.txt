Chapter 1470: This Technique

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Heartless, and Blood Emperor?”

The brawny man engulfed in flame smiled.

Even with the hindrance of consciousness prison, the brawny man could still see the happening within clearly. He naturally also saw the scene of Blood Emperor fighting against Jian Wushuang.

“This Universe God should be Jian Wushuang, who came to Sky Sword Prison not too long ago. To be able to struggle for so long in Blood Emperor’s hand, his power is not too shabby. However, it ends here,” the brawny man smiled faintly as he watched. He couldn’t be bothered, nor did he plan, to get involved.

In consciousness prison.

“Very soon!”

“I’ll be there very soon!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were red with a tinge of madness. However, in actual fact, he was absolutely calm and cool-headed. He had been moving towards the weakest point of the consciousness prison the whole time.

He finally arrived at the weakest point of the consciousness prison, but his divine body was heavily injured.

“This is it!”

There was a glimpse of light in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

Hong!

A vast, blazing quicksand exploded directly. The blazing quicksand region moved towards Blood Emperor under Jian Wushuang’s manipulation.

Although it seemed to only have constrained Blood Emperor slightly, it at least affected his speed.

At the same time, there was an enormous amount of crimson flame that flowed from Jian Wushuang’s body. The crimson flame formed a huge, crimson sea of fire directly.

Jian Wushuang was standing right at the core of the sea of fire, as though he were the King of the crimson sea.

The power of Star Palace in his body instantly flowed out too.

The secret skills of Scarlet Kingdom and Star Palace were performed simultaneously.

“Break!”

Jian Wushuang’s expression looked extremely crazy as the golden divine ape that covered the surface of his body let out a roar. The sword in its hand was revealing boundless power as well.

Wow!

A terrifying sword light swept out.

The sword light wasn’t a slash against Blood Emperor, but at the consciousness wall behind Jian Wushuang.

It was a single venture that Jian Wushuang risked everything on, and he performed a variety of his trump cards at once.

If the hit were to collapse the consciousness wall, he would stand a chance to escape.

Hong!

A vigorous noise and the originally-sturdy consciousness prison suddenly shook madly and teetered from the attack.

In the very next moment, on the consciousness wall that Jian Wushuang hit, a crack appeared and had an opening.

Although the opening wasn’t too big, it was big enough for Jian Wushuang to run out of.

“What?”

“He knew the weakest point of my consciousness prison?”

Heartless King, who had retreated to the border of the consciousness prison, was surprised.

Compared to Jian Wushuang being able to cause an opening in consciousness prison, she was even more shocked by the earlier technique that Jian Wushuang had suddenly performed.

Especially… That one technique!

“This, this technique?” Heartless King was shocked.

Even Blood Emperor was stunned on the spot.

“Blood Emperor, you never said that Jian Wushuang knew this technique before!” Heartless King straightaway roared.

“This… I never knew he knew that technique too!” Blood Emperor bellowed, but he looked extremely distressed. “At this point, we can’t think too much. Kill!”

Swoosh!

Blood Emperor was fueled by murderous intention. He locked his gaze on Jian Wushuang and plunged to chase after him.

However, Jian Wushuang who caused an opening in consciousness prison already appeared outside of consciousness prison after he had exited from the opening.

“I’m out!”

There was joy shimmering in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

Without the hindrance of consciousness prison, it would be much easier if he wanted to escape in the open space.

Jian Wushuang instantly performed the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood and the divine power in his body started burning in madness.

At the same time, he swept out his Soul Power.

Just as Jian Wushuang performed the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood and was prepared to make a run…

“What?” Jian Wushuang’s face suddenly changed.

Within his sensory range of Soul Power, he noticed an extremely hot aura which was traveling at terrifying speed.

The aura appeared in the void right before him.

“This is…”

Jian Wushuang lifted his head and saw a cloud of boundless flame sweeping over. The flame was like a cloud of fire that descended from heaven.

The cloud of fire landed before Jian Wushuang. Rumble!

The boundless flame swept forward crazily in an imposing manner, like breaking dead wood.

The surrounding ten thousand mile range was burned by the blazing flame to the point where not even a blade of grass would grow.

The terrifying power frightened Jian Wushuang, while Blood Emperor and Heartless King, who were chasing after Jian Wushuang, immediately hauled their steps.

The boundless flame slowed down and finally left a small flame burning. Inside the small flame, a brawny figure gradually revealed itself.

He had fiery-red hair, fiery-red eyebrows, and even his beard had a flame-like redness.

His body was built and his skin was tan. He was filled with an air of masculinity. However, the brawny man engulfed in the flame was covered in unprecedented rage and his gaze was furious too.

Looking at the visitor, Blood Emperor and Heartless King grew grave.

Jian Wushuang stopped in the void afar too. He was shocked to see the sight.

“Such a terrifying aura. The aura was so savage and so much stronger compared to Blood Emperor and Heartless King!”

“This is… Fiery King!”

Jian Wushuang immediately understood the visitor’s identity.

In Sky Sword Prison, the four Kings were publicly recognized as the four most powerful experts.

However, among the four experts, there were differences in their power too. Among them, Fiery King was known publicly and recognized as the strongest!

He was stronger that Blood Emperor, Heartless King and also Mist King!

The legend said that Fiery King would visit the other three Kings every once in a while to fight against them.

Every time they fought, although he couldn’t kill the other three Kings, he could torture the other three Kings.

Hence the reason why he was recognized as the number one overlord in Sky Sword Prison.

The other three Kings were afraid of Fiery King to a certain extent.

Then, Fiery King appeared before Jian Wushuang.

“Impressive. Four Kings in Sky Sword Prison, and there are three here!”

“Plus, Fiery King took the initiative to block Blood Emperor and Heartless King for me?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression grew strange.

The brawny man showering in flame, Fiery King, was in boundless anger as he stared at Blood Emperor and Heartless King before him.

“Blood Emperor, Heartless, the two of you, how dare you do anything to my underling?”

“You have guts!!!”

A loud roar was heard from Fiery King. His deafening voice shook the surrounding void as though they were shivering in fear.

Hearing that, Blood Emperor and Heartless King grew pale while Jian Wushuang looked surprised.
