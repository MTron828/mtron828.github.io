Chapter 237: Kill

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Mo Feng could no longer sit still, power at the Yang Void Realm radiated from him as he immediately rushed toward Jian Wushuang.

The Nine Emperors Sect was heavily weakened by Jian Wushuang half a year ago. However, after recovering for half a year, there were now five warriors from the Nine Emperors Sect in the Yin-Yang Void Realm. But, just now, two of them had been killed by Jian Wushuang in the blink of an eye.

This would cause anyone to feel the heartache.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang moved like a ghost, quickly drifting through the area and killing those two warriors in succession. Then he flew towards a purple-robed middle-aged man, who was the current sect master of the Nine Emperors Sect, Qu Nan.

That ice-cold sword light flashed again.

“What?” Qu Nan was shocked.

“Stop, stop right now!” Mo Feng, who was rushing there, shouted.

But Jian Wushuang didn’t stop. The ice-cold sword light, containing a humongous power, pierced forward with a burst of killing intent. Qu Nan realized his intent and tried his best to defend.

But, because of the huge gap in their strength, he was only able to slow him down a little.

“Young man, you dare!”

Mo Feng raged. In the next moment, he could only watch as the sword light passed through Qu Nan’s neck, cutting off his head.

“You’re dead!” A second later, Mo Feng’s expression twisted and the look in his eyes became cold. While staring at Jian Wushuang, a huge hammer instantly appeared in his hand out of nowhere.

At a glance, the huge hammer seemed to weigh a thousand catties, but Mo Feng easily held it and swung it.

At the very moment, he swung it, creating ripples that contained a terrifying power and spread out in waves, forcing the warriors who were fighting in the area to retreat.

Rumble… The hammer roared and appeared beside Jian Wushuang. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Ridiculous.”?Jian Wushuang sneered without glancing at Mo Feng, then he adjusted his grip and hacked out with his sword.

It was a normal move, but it used his full strength.

The power of this move almost reached the Profound Yang Void Realm, which was definitely more powerful than Mo Feng, who had only recently reached the Initial Yang Void Realm

Bang!

With a thunder sound, the huge hammer trembled. Then a strong force passed through the hammer to Mo Feng.

Mo Feng’s eyes widened with shock and his face turned pale. He couldn’t help looking at Jian Wushuang while he retreated. He saw Jian Wushuang’s figure fly up and rush toward him.

“You thought you could kill me?” Jian Wushuang sneered and said, “I killed Qu Nan, and I can kill you too.”

After he finished speaking, a terrifying killing intent radiated from him, filling the area.

Even Mo Feng had never seen such a strong killing intent. When Jian Wushuang looked at him again, Mo Feng couldn’t help feeling terrified, as if the one he faced with was not a human being but an Asura from hell.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang hacked out with his longsword again.

This weightless move which seemed weak and feeble, but the Slaughter Source contained in it was enough to freeze the entire area.

As it moved toward Mo Feng, his eyes widened and the feeling of an unprecedented and deadly crisis struck him.

He had no doubt that this weightless and seemingly weak move could kill him in an instant.

“Help me, Mr. Ku, help me!” Mo Feng called out with a sad and shrill voice.

Hearing that, the weathered elder on crutches who had been hiding suddenly moved.

He moved at a speed that was much faster than Jian Wushuang.

Before the sword light fell on Mo Feng, the weathered elder appeared. His eyes flashed with a sharp look as he stretched out his dry and yellow palm, covered in a flowing stream of Spiritual Power, then turning into a sharp claw as it caught Jian Wushuang’s longsword.

Crack!

The sharp claw caught the sword and prevented it from moving.

“Arrogant.”

Jian Wushuang suddenly shouted as the power contained in the sword surged, at the same time the killing intent formed into a flowing light and rushed towards the weathered elder’s forehead.

“Hum?” Surprise flashed in the weathered elder’s eyes as he immediately released the sword blade in his hand, slamming down with the crutch in his other hand to defend.

As the crutch smashed down, the fleeting sound of a thunder crash was heard.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

Crashes sounded, with each collision creating a small blast wave. Several moments later, a large blast wave formed and swept out in all directions.

Rumble… The whole area trembled, with both Jian Wushuang and the weathered elder being forced backwards. As they separated, the whole battlefield turned peaceful.

Many warriors from the Nine Emperors Sect and the Raindrop Pavilion were shocked.

Even the warriors in hiding were aghast.

Too fast, what happened just now was so fast.

From the moment Jian Wushuang began moving, he had killed two warriors from the Nine Emperors Sect in succession, as well as killing their sect master, Qu Nan, and then forced Mo Feng back. At that point, the weathered elder appeared to save Mo Feng and a fierce exchange happened between Jian Wushuang and the weathered elder.

So fast, it all happened suddenly and ended just as quickly.

Before the warriors in the area could even react, Jian Wushuang and the weathered elder had already moved away from each other.

And three bodies lay on the ground.

Among them, two were elders of the Nine Emperors Sect, and the other was the sect master of the Nine Emperors Sect.

In such a short time, they were all killed by Jian Wushuang?

How terrifying was his strength?

“That man, is from the Raindrop Pavilion?”

“No, he must be a helper that was hired by the Raindrop Pavilion.”

“Haha, there is still hope.”

Many warriors from the Raindrop Pavilion suddenly seemed to be infused with excitement.

“Boss...” Tang Wuji also looked at Jian Wushuang excitedly.

Those guests of the Raindrop Pavilion who were becoming desperate before, suddenly became hopeful when they saw Jian Wushuang’s strength, and their hope continued to increase.

On the other side, the people of the Nine Emperors Sect did not look happy.

Up in the air, Jian Wushuang and the weathered elder stood facing each other, and Mo Feng had already moved back out of the way. Although he was a warrior in the Yang Void Realm, he understood that he was not qualified to join this fight.

“Old man, you stayed hidden for such a long time. Now you’ve finally decided to show yourself?” Jian Wushuang asked and smiled.

“I was only hidden for a short while, but you?” The weathered elder looked over at him coldly and said, “We have been searching for you since the Easternmost Hunt ended, but you seemed to have disappeared from the face of the earth for the last half year. Today, you finally reappeared.”

“Jian Wushuang, it was not easy to find you!”
