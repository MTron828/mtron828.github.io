Chapter 691: Fighting

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

As Jian Wushuang exerted all the power of Sword Heart and Emperor Sword, his strength had reached a new height.

At the same time, he brought forth his swordsmanship fully.

Numerous sword shadows completely suppressed Hu Hu, making him feel as if he had fallen into a Sword Sea and was surrounded by sword shadows.

Red clouds surged from the red crystal armor of Hu Hu and vast power gathered in his hands. He swung his double-edged giant axe and hacked toward Jian Wushuang continuously.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

There were consecutive clashes of metal on metal, which were so deep and powerful that the whole hall trembled.

Jian Wushuang completely unleashed his swordsmanship, which was simple, pure, neat and almost flawless. His sword strokes were so fast that Hu Hu could do nothing but parry them with difficulty.

“Get out of my way!”

Hu Hu shouted and then hacked his Giant Axe violently. A huge Axe Shadow of nearly a hundred meters appeared in the hall instantly.

The power of this Axe Shadow was suffocating, and the air seemed to be shuddering.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold.

“Violet Calamity Sword Skill!”

He shouted and operated the strongest move which he had created.

He had used this move before, but he had withheld his strength and only used 70 percent of Sword Heart power at that time.

He brought gave it everything this time.

It was a head-on confrontation!

A beautiful purple light suddenly lit up and then collided with the towering Axe Shadow which was a hundred meters high.

With a loud sound, the entire hall was violently trembling. Jian Wushuang, who fell into an energy storm, darkened his face as he felt an extraordinary force coming along his arm and knocking him backward.

“He’s a superior Divine Realm expert indeed. I’ve tried my best and exerted all my power, but I still can’t compete with him,”?Jian Wushuang sighed but was not discouraged by it.

He was prepared for the fact that a superior Divine Realm expert was much stronger than an advanced Divine Realm expert.

“Since I can’t play hardball, I’ll kill him using my skills and swordsmanship.”?Jian Wushuang thought.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled. He suddenly flashed and appeared behind Hu Hu, his sharp sword stabbing at Hu Hu’s throat directly.

Hu Hu counterattacked with his axe. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The overwhelming Axe Shadow split the entire hall ground apart but it did not touch even the corner of Jian Wushuang’s clothes. On the contrary, Jian Wushuang’s sword stroke which originally aimed at Hu Hu’s throat swung sidewards and brushed over Hu Hu’s shoulder like a ghost, leaving a sword scar.

“You should die!”

Hu Hu’s eyes were burning with anger. He continued to chop with his axe, trying to kill Jian Wushuang.

But Jian Wushuang kept dodging quickly in the hall. As he enhanced his speed to its extreme, he was as fast as a fish in water, trying his best to avoid direct collisions with Hu Hu. Instead, he used his more delicate swordsmanship to force Hu Hu to resist his attacks frantically.

Jian Wushuang’s sword shadows, including straight slashes, sweeps, or sudden withdrawal, seemed simple but were actually delicate. They suppressed Hu Hu perfectly, making him unable to swing his Giant Axe to counterattack. Some unexpected sword shadows even brought a lot of harm to Hu Hu.

Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship was too profound.

Compared with Jian Wushuang, Hu Hu’s axe skills were extremely rigid and he was not as flexible as Jian Wushuang.

Facing Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship, Hu Hu had nothing but brute force which he could not use to his full advantage.

“Boy, do you dare to face me directlyYou’re a coward if you hide all the time,” Hu Hu growled in anxiety and anger.

“Are you joking? You’re a superior Divine Realm expert while I’m just at the Skyscraping Realm. Do you expect me to compare force with you?” Jian Wushuang sneered.

He was not a fool. Since he knew he could not win in the head-on confrontation, he would certainly stop fighting in this way.

In addition, after six years of cultivation in the Sword Mountain, he had made biggest progress in Sword Principle Cultivation and swordsmanship, which became his greatest advantage. He naturally wanted to use this.

In the hall, the collisions between the two continued, but it was obvious that Hu Hu had been completely suppressed by Jian Wushuang.

“Bastard, bastard!”

Hu Hu was angry and he was almost driven crazy by Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship.

On the contrary, Jian Wushuang felt excited and delighted!

“Good! This feels so good!”

In the past six years, he had been cultivating in seclusion. Though his swordsmanship was extremely powerful, he had no chance to practice it. He had killed the 10 Divine Realm experts including four advanced Divine Realm experts, but it could barely be counted as a challenge for him.

He did not need to use his full strength to kill those 10 Divine Realm experts.

They were not qualified to make him go all out.

Until he met Hu Hu.

In the face of a superior Divine Realm expert, he could finally go all out, including using his swordsmanship.

The fight swept away the boredom of his six years of cultivation.

Bang!

After another collision, Jian Wushuang finally stepped backward to generate a distance between the two.

“Rat.” Hu Hu stared at Jian Wushuang with freezing and gloomy eyes. He felt stuck in the fierce battle, as he could not use his force at all. After all, Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship was too overwhelming and profound.

“How can a Skyscraping Realm expert’s swordsmanship be so terrifying?”?Hu Hu felt awestruck.

At this time, Jian Wushuang looked up at Hu Hu.

“Hu Hu, I enjoyed the fight with you. But let’s end this,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

“Hum?” Hu Hu’s expression changed slightly.

“Didn’t you complain that I did not dare fight you directly just now? Now I’ll do as you wish,” Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice.

Hu Hu looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

Just now Jian Wushuang had gained the upper hand due to his exquisite swordsmanship. However, if they had a head-on confrontation and competed for power, Hu Hu was much better than Jian Wushuang.

And now Jian Wushuang was willing to give up his advantage to have a direct confrontation with Hu Hu?

“Are you ready?”

A solemn look appeared on Jian Wushuang’s face. The Emperor Sword in his hand also trembled furiously at this moment.
