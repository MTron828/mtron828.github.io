Chapter 642: The Strongest Genius, Gong Chao!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“He lost.”

Seeing Feng being carried out of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang sighed while shaking his head.

Feng had exerted his full strength. He was powerful indeed, especially using his Saber Technique.

However, his comprehension of the Dao was inferior to Qianqiu Wuhen’s, so he was unable to turn the tables.

Then it was time for Jian Wushuang to fight Gong Chao.

Under the gazes of the geniuses on the Drill Ground and the experts in the Skyward Pavilion, Jian Wushuang and Gong Chao stepped onto the battlefield.

Jian Wushuang had to be considered the best genius from the Ancient World.

Gong Chao was qualified to rank number one in the other geniuses’ eyes, but the experts knew that he was actually much more powerful than Qianqiu Wuhen and would be the strongest genius in this year’s Firmament Territory Feast. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Therefore, their duel received lots of attention.

“The battle between Jian Wushuang and Gong Chao will be exciting!”

“Both of them are the best geniuses from their respective worlds. It’s rare to see such a fight!”

“Anyway, Gong Chao will be the winner. I only wonder how far Jian Wushuang will go.”

“Right, Gong Chao is far superior to the other geniuses. Even Qianqiu Wuhen is weaker than him. No one is his match in this year’s feast. Although Jian Wushuang is good, he is unable to fight against Gong Chao.”

“I don’t think so.” An elegant, middle-aged expert from a superior sect disagreed.

“Jian Wushuang has been hiding his strength and has various skills. In the second of the genius battles, he almost lost the fight against the Puppet Fighter, but he still held on for 10 minutes by using his Sword Principle!

“As for the arena duel with Chu Yang, all of us thought he would lose without a doubt, but in the end, he defeated Chu Yang with ease.

“And during his fight with Ouyang Xuan, we thought he would be defeated by the 13 Sword Moves of Liu Yun, but he used his World Dao to save the day.

“Every time, his performance has been beyond our expectations, so we have to change our view of him. Even I can’t see through him.

“If the other geniuses went up against Gong Chao, I believe that Gong Chao would win. But now, it’s Jian Wushuang... Hehe, I don’t dare to draw a conclusion.”

Upon hearing this, many experts secretly nodded.

The middle-aged expert was telling the truth. Jian Wushuang had surprised them three times, so he might create a miracle this time.

“Hmph, Jian Wushuang is just a little guy from the Ancient World. It’s a miracle that he has been able to reach this level. He wants to defeat Gong Chao? Ridiculous!” said the black-haired elder from Cloud Sea Asgard with disdain. He fixed his eyes on Gong Chao, as he believed that Gong Chao was the number one genius in this year’s Firmament Territory Feast.

Jian Wushang?

How was he comparable to Gong Chao?

At this point, Jian Wushuang and Gong Chao stood face to face.

“Gong Chao.”

Jian Wushuang stared at his opponent as his battle intent rose, and he said, “You’re more powerful than any of us in the feast, and I know that you haven’t used your full strength yet.

“I really want to see how powerful you are!”

“That depends on how strong you are. I won’t use my full strength to attack someone who is weak,” Gong Chao responded in a frosty tone.

“Give it a try.” Jian Wushuang stuck out his tongue to lick his lips. His battle intent had peaked while his eyes sparkled with eagerness.

It had been a long time since he had encountered a super genius like Gong Chao.

Therefore, he was looking forward to it.

“Your strength is greater than my previous opponents, so I’ll take it seriously,” Gong Chao said as he gave him an icy stare.

A Stone Cudgel appeared in his hands. It looked worn out, but a terrifying aura radiated out from it.

Gong Chao had used it to defeat his opponents during the previous rounds of genius battles.

No one had been able to withstand three strikes from him.

“Show your move,” Jian Wushuang replied in a confident tone.

His Heart-killing Sword appeared in his hand. It seemed to be perceiving the overwhelming battle intent from his body and it started to shake violently.

“OK.”

Gong Chao suddenly stepped forward.

“Bang!”

The tough ground immediately cracked. Many geniuses were unable to break the ground even if they used all of their strength, but Gong Chao did it easily.

His terrifying aura reached its peak. Then, Gong Chao waved his Stone Cudgel toward his opponent, who was still standing far away from him.

The moment the cudgel lashed out, it began to expand at an amazing speed and became a Sky-Supporting Pillar that connected heaven and earth.

Endless thunderbolts curled around the pillar with the power of destroying the whole world.

Holding his Stone Cudgel, Gong Chao now became the ruler of the thunderbolts.

“How powerful!”

“This strike...”

“Rank Two... Rank Two Secret Skill!”

Many geniuses on the Drill Ground and experts in the Skyward Pavilion were stupefied.

Seeing the terrifying power, everyone realized that this attack belonged to the Rank Two Secret Skill.

It was the first time that a Rank Two Secret Skill had appeared during this year’s Firmament Territory Feast.

At this point, Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up. And the next moment, his World Energy suddenly emanated out as the power of the Heart-killing Sword soared.

“Boom!”

A strike charged forward, as if it would split the whole area.

This powerful strike drew the attention of all the spectators.

“This strike!”

Everyone widened their eyes because they discovered that Jian Wushuang was displaying a Rank Two Secret Skill!

It was a competition between Rank Two Secret Skills—peerless Staff Technique versus terrifying Swordsmanship!

The two strikes crashed head-on under everyone’s gaze.
