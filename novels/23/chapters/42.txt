Chapter 43: Incredible Comprehension

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Whoosh!

Sword light flashed at an amazingly fast speed, just like a fish swimming in the water, shifting around naturally.

It was quite a bit later when Jian Wushuang finally stopped practicing.

“Kid, I think I am beginning to understand why Blood Feather Tower chased you in such a crazy manner,” Sima Bu said to him with a complex look on his face. “To be honest, I have to admit that you are an exceptional genius. You have grasped the Sword Principle of Gale today even though you just learned of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth yesterday. Your talent completely outmatches the exceptional genius I mentioned to you earlier. If I’m not mistaken, although your natural talent is good, part of it must have to do with your awakening of the Sword Soul. ”

“Sword Soul?” Jian Wushuang felt a tremor in his heart, then nodded, quietly approving.

Indeed, when practicing his swordsmanship, he also realized that something inside him helped him comprehend the Essences of Heaven and Earth. Even though it was difficult for others, he could easily grasp the Sword Essence of Gale.

But what was it inside him that helped him comprehend the Essences of Heaven and Earth?

Undoubtedly, it must be because of his Sword Soul awakening.

Sword Soul. Something that drove Blood Feather Tower to chase after him desperately. Naturally, it must be extraordinary.

It was due to the Sword Soul that he could immediately and swiftly comprehend a trace of the Sword Essence of Gale.

“Anyhow, I have already grasped a trace of the Sword Essence of Gale. With it, my swordsmanship should be several times or even dozens of times more skillful than before.” Jian Wushuang thought with a bright look in his eyes.

Only a trace of Sword Essence of Gale could easily make his sword several times faster once it was integrated into his swordsmanship.

Such an increase in speed also helped sharpen his swordsmanship, greatly contributing to its piercing force.

It would cause his level of swordsmanship to increase immensely.

“Let me test it against a Spirit Beast first!” Jian Wushuang thought quietly.

Shortly after, he fought with a huge Iron-backed Bear.

Its force was extremely dreadful and absolutely the most formidable Spirit Beast in the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm.

If he had encountered this huge Iron-backed Bear before grasping a trace of the Sword Essence of Gale, Jian Wushuang would have had no choice but to flee in a disorderly manner. However, now he did not even show a trace of fear.

“Kill!”

After releasing a low howl, with his eyes blazing like torches, Jian Wushuang waved his sword. Sword light flashed out across the air for several meters before finally striking the huge body of the Iron-backed Bear directly.

The sword light was so fleeting that the Iron-backed Bear didn’t even realize its body was had been injured at first. Instantly, a flood of fresh blood poured out from the sword scar on its body.

Though the sword scar was nothing to its huge body and strong defense, it was definitely enough to enrage the Iron-backed Bear.

“Howl!”

The howl from the Iron-backed Bear’s mouth echoed in the surroundings. Its two giant feet stamped on the ground as it made great strides towards Jian Wushuang. Every step forward produced a minor tremor.

“Go to hell, human!”

The dark golden eyes of the Iron-backed Bear were a bloody color and its desire to kill Jian Wushuang increased dramatically.

“Haha, come on.”Jian Wushuang began to laugh loudly while moving his sword to fight against it. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

After a while, a cold and dazzling sword light directly penetrated it’s defense and plunged into its throat.

“Iron-backed Bears are formidable in both power and defense, but their speed is very slow. Now that I have grasped a trace of the Sword Essence of Gale, I can easily surpass it in speed. There is no chance for it to resist against my absolute advantage in speed. ” Jian Wushuang smiled secretly.

Iron-backed Bears, the most formidable Spirit Beasts in the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm. Now, they could easily be slain by Jian Wushuang.

“Continue…”

Next, the tests progressed forward as he battled one formidable Spirit Beasts after another.

Such as Purple Crystal-Winged Lions, Phantom Foxes, Gibbon-shaped Wolverines, Nine Poisons Pythons and so on.

The most formidable Spirit Beasts in the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm became the opponents of Jian Wushuang and were eventually killed by him.

Time flew by. It had already been one month since Jian Wushuang entered the Dark Forest.

The Dark Forest covered an abundantly immense area, stretching across two provinces. Although he had already traveled for a month, Jian Wushuang still had a long way to go before he would reach the Tiannan Province.

With his hands crossed, in the darkness of the forest, Sima Bu gravely stared at Jian Wushuang, who was practicing his swordsmanship in front of him.

In his eyes, he could clearly perceive that every one of Jian Wushuang’s extremely heavy moves interacted and integrated with the earth.

“Sword Essence of Earth!”

“He has just grasped a trace of the Sword Essence of Gale, but in less than a month after that, he seems to have also grasped the Sword Essence of Earth!”

“Unbelievable, it’s really unbelievable!”

It shocked Sima Bu to his core.

It was really incredible for him to simultaneously grasp two kinds of Sword Essence within a month. However, this made Sima Bu much more curious about Sword Soul, “What on earth is Sword Soul? And how did it create such a monster?”

It wasn’t long before Jian Wushuang finished practicing his swordsmanship.

“Earth, warm and heavy!”

“The Sword Essence of Earth is exactly like this!”

Jian Wushuang forced a smile and rejoiced. He himself didn’t expect to grasp the Sword Essence as easily as he did today. He grasped Sword Principle of Gale earlier, but only one month later he had also grasped a trace of the Sword Essence of Earth. For his part, that must be the result of the Sword Soul.

Great progress had been made in his swordsmanship in the past month.

First, his Cultivation had reached the peak of the Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path after one month’s worth of life-and-death fighting and day-and-night cultivation. His current level was comparable to when he used the Soul-taking Secret Skill to fight against Ye Mo.

At its peak, the Ninth Heaven of the Divine Path was equivalent to the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm.

Secondly, his swordsmanship, and especially his fighting experience, had made greater progress. Now, without a doubt, he was completely experienced in fighting.

As for Sword Essence, he learned more tricks in the Sword Essence of Gale and became more skilled and flexible in the practice and use of Sword Essence. But more importantly, he also apprehended a trace of the Sword Essence of Earth just now.

It must be acknowledged that he had grasped two different Sword Essences of nature in this short amount of time.

Characterized by its flexibility and fastness, the Sword Essence of Gale could make Sword Arts and piercing force much more powerful. As for the Sword Essence of Earth, it was boundless and tremendous due to its heaviness and steadiness.

If used perfectly and flexibly, these two Sword Essences could make his Sword Arts more dreadful and formidable.

“After a month of cultivating and fighting, I have killed numerous Spirit Beasts easily. Even the formidable Spirit Beasts in the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm are not considered a threat to me, so…”

Exposing a cold look in his eyes, Jian Wushuang made a decision in his mind.
