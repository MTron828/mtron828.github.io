Chapter 2741: Finally Made A Move!

‘Isn’t this... Su Han?’ Saber Master narrowed his eyes.

He was not the only person who noticed Jian Wushuang who had appeared in the void behind him, Devilish Wind King noticed it as well. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Alliance Master Su Han, you’re so daring to return?” Devilish Wind King turned around and glanced at Jian Wushuang with a cold look in his eyes.

Jian Wushuang stood in the dark void and stared at Devilish Wind King with a smile at the corners of his mouth. “Devilish Wind King, I’ve realized since earlier on that you were hiding your means all this while. I grew more alert toward you since you managed to escape from being chased by a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet. It seems like my assumptions were correct.”

“You own a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet and a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet. Haha... You’re really quite strong.”

Devilish Wind King said with a snicker, “So what if you realized? Hong Chen and Long Xianzi have died. What changes can you alone make?”

The person Devilish Wind King feared the most among the other five who entered the secret realm that time was Saber Master with Hong Chen and Long Xianzi next in line. As for Jian Wushuang and Yi Shen, he did not pay much attention to them from the beginning.

It was naturally the same at that moment since he did not pay much attention to them previously.

“You have a really good plan. Unfortunately, you’ve calculated something incorrectly,” said Jian Wushuang.

“What did I calculate incorrectly?” Devilish Wind King asked.

“You’ve underestimated my true strength.” Jian Wushuang smiled oddly and instantly moved.

Whoosh!!

The Space-time Law was directly activated as Jian Wushuang’s speed achieved its peak within moments.

However, Devilish Wind King smiled in disdain as he pointed at Jian Wushuang. “What a joke, kill him!!”

The Silver-armored Corpse Puppet beside Devilish Wind King who had not made any moves immediately took action when he received Devilish Wind King’s order.

Although the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet was not as terrifying as the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet, its combat power was considered top-tier among High-level Grand Ultimate Gods.

A Silver-armored Corpse Puppet was capable of fighting head-on with Saber Master for some time—which self-explains his true strength.

Devilish Wing King noticed Jian Wushuang might have hidden his true strength previously. However, he truly thought that a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet was sufficient to kill Jian Wushuang with ease.

Jian Wushuang smiled coldly when he saw the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet coming toward him. A huge wave of golden divine power immediately coagulated behind him before the 10,000-foot-tall Golden Emperor once again appeared between Heaven and Earth. He also instantaneously activated the Seven Stars Secret Technique in his body which directly raised his realm to another level.

At the same time, a layer of dark gold-colored armor slowly appeared on the surface of his body.

All three secret techniques—Divine God of Punishment, Seven Stars Secret Technique, and Precious Armor of the Nine Sparkle Star Armor—were activated at the same time. Jian Wushuang’s strength had increased to its extreme level at that moment.

Jian Wushuang then pointed with a single finger following his course of actions.

Clatter~ A wave of hazy dark golden light directly swept across all directions and completely covered the entire area within the blink of an eye.

The surging golden divine power sea also came sweeping outward crazily as a huge prison was instantly formed.

The 100,000 miles Sword World was also directly unleashed without restraints.

All three domains—Star Armor Domain, Prison of Punishment, and Sword World—had superimposed!

Boom!!

The terrifying power immediately suppressed the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet’s body.

Although the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet was a corpse puppet without any consciousness, his body still suddenly paused under the suppression wave with his skimming speed also immediately slowed down.

Once all of that was executed, Jian Wushuang finally took action with his sword.

It was the first time he took action after stepping foot in the secret realm and 30 years of training in retreat.

No matter what previously happened in the secret realm, he only showed a small portion of his means and had never used the Seven Stars Secret Technique or Nine Sparkle Star Armor. He also did not unleash his divine power to its extremities. However, his divine power had reached its extreme level at that moment with him activating all his secret techniques.

“Silver-armored Corpse Puppet, let’s see if you can withstand this sword attack of mine!!” A fierce look burst outward from Jian Wushuang’s face as he waved forward the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

It was a purely strong sword attack without any additional moves. However, the strength was enough to shake the heavens.

The Silver-armored Corpse Puppet suddenly raised his head under the crazy domains’ suppression as he fiercely punched forward.

The punch came like a huge mountain before both attacks collided with one another.

Bang!!

A low banging sound could be heard.

The Silver-armored Corpse Puppet was created using special means and had an extremely strong divine body. However, the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet’s outer layer punching hand had directly broken under the collision with his entire arm twisted. The Blood Mountain Sword’s domineering power had directly sent the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet falling toward the void below.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang had recovered with a slight tremble of his body.

It was completely crushed in terms of power.

The Silver-armored Corpse Puppet with the same combat power as a top-tier High-level Grand Ultimate God was completely crushed by Jian Wushuang during a collision of pure strength.

“How’s this possible?” Devilish Wind King turned pale with fright when he saw what transpired.

He had no idea that Jian Wushuang had crushed a top-tier Primary-level Grand Ultimate God called Fo Yi 30 years ago with his full power even before he made a breakthrough. His power back then was already much stronger than Fo Yi and very close to a High-level Grand Ultimate God’s.

At that moment, he had made a breakthrough in his realm and reached the High-level Heaven Ultimate God which resulted in a great increase of his divine power. As for his secret techniques, his Divine God of Punishment had achieved the third level and when coupled with the 10,000-foot-tall Divine God of Punishment—his strength at that moment was the highest among High-level Grand Ultimate Gods.

He was no weaker when compared to Saber Master and slightly stronger than the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet.

It had to be highlighted that the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet could not even use 70 percent of its true strength under his triple domain suppression.

The Silver-armored Corpse Puppet could only be completely crushed by Jian Wushuang when fighting against him under such circumstances in a fight that relied on pure strength.

“In order not to attract the others’ attention, I’ve greatly downplayed my divine power and secret techniques. It’s really a nice feeling now that I can finally take action with my full power.” Jian Wushuang smiled softly but the look in his eyes felt as though it might burst forward like two lightning bolts as he looked over to Devilish Wind King as a strong killing intent began to rise.

‘Sh*t!!’ Devilish Wind King’s expression darkened.

He could see the strong killing intent in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

He did not have any means to stop Jian Wushuang with the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet fighting Saber Master and the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet crushed by Jian Wushuang.

“Run!!” Devilish Wind King immediately made his decision and wanted to escape with his strong self-protecting means.

During his course of escape, he immediately ordered the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet to stop pestering the Saber Master and protect him instead.

The Gold-armored Corpse Puppet also did as ordered and immediately gave up fighting Saber Master and skimmed toward Devilish Wind King.

However, Jian Wushuang slowly pointed his finger at the Devilish Wind King from the void at that moment.
