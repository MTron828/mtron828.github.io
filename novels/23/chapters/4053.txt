Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“How is this possible?” Di Huo’s head was buzzing. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

He knew that Jian Wushuang had passed the fourth level of the Principle Sea, so his comprehension of the universal principles must be much higher than his.

However, when they fought, even if they had the same divine power and the same degree of fusion of the principles, the outcome could not be decided just by the comprehension of the universal principles.

In Di Huo’s opinion, although his comprehension of the universe principles was not as good as Jian Wushuang’s, he was very confident in his comprehension of the saber principle, the universe origin, his saber skills, and the secret skills he cultivated.

Under such circumstances, even if his comprehension of the universe principles was weaker, he should be able to defeat Blood Sword.

However, the real fight was not what he had imagined.

He did not even have the chance to show his saber skills and was defeated in an instant.

“What a powerful sword!”

The surrounding spectators, including Green Flame Star Lord, Golden Feather Star Lord, and Gui Yun, were all shocked.

Two of them were Ultimate Rulers, and the other one was also a Ruler at the peak of the fifth level. They all had very high standards, so they could naturally see how powerful Jian Wushuang’s sword was.

“It’s too fast,” Golden Feather Star Lord praised.

“It is very fast. In terms of speed, he is probably the top among the fifth level Rulers. There is no doubt that Blood Sword has a very high comprehension of the universe principles, and his comprehension of the sword principle universe is also ridiculously high. I think he has already surpassed most of the fifth level Rulers,” Green Flame Star Lord said.

“In the Principle Sea, we can only see the comprehension of the universal principles, but we can’t judge other aspects. But now, it seems that Blood Sword is much stronger than we thought.” Gui Yun sighed.

Before, they thought that Jian Wushuang only had a high comprehension of the universal principles. But now, they knew that Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of the universe origin of Sword Principle was also ridiculously high, and his swordsmanship.., he was probably stronger than many fifth-level Rulers who were good at sword principle.

Gui Yun and the others did not feel wronged that Di Huo was defeated by him.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang had already flown down from the void, and Di Huo followed behind Jian Wushuang and flew down.

“My young friend Blood Sword, thank you very much.” Green Flame Star Lord said with a smile.

“You’re welcome.” Jian Wushuang just nodded slightly.

“Disciple, are you convinced of this battle?” Green Flame Star Lord looked at Di Huo.

Di Huo moved his lips and wanted to say something, but he held it back in the end. He just lowered his head and looked extremely ugly.

“Humph.” Green Flame Star Lord suddenly snorted. “A defeat is a defeat. If you don’t even have the courage to face defeat, then you’ll disappoint me.”

“Ruler.” Di Huo raised his head and said in a low voice, “I’m convinced by this battle. Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Blood Sword.”

Di Huo had even addressed Jian Wushuang as Mr. Blood Sword. It was obvious that Jian Wushuang’s strength had convinced him.

Seeing this, Green Flame Star Lord nodded with satisfaction, he said, “A defeat is not terrible. Moreover, the little friend Blood Sword who defeated you now must be the best and most heaven-defying genius in the entire vast universe. It’s not shameful to be defeated by such a genius. What’s important is that you must recognize yourself through this battle.”

“Although you are a genius and you are number one in terms of talent in the entire Bone Pupil Star Field, you might not be able to rank at the top in the entire vast universe. At the very least, you are still far from the most heaven-defying geniuses.”

“What you need to do is to maintain your reverence toward the universe. Keep your temper and slowly grow step by step. Sooner or later, you will have a chance to stabilize your peak. You might even surpass Blood Sword in the future.”

“I understand.” Di Huo nodded heavily, and his eyes became hot again.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang also nodded secretly. He could see that the Star Lord of Green Flame was very devoted to his disciple, and he also knew how to teach his disciple.

After teaching Di Huo a lesson with his own hands, Di Huo’s temper would definitely be erased, and his achievements in the future would be even greater.

As for whether Di Huo would have a chance to surpass him in the future, Jian Wushuang did not dare to say it.

“Alright, it’s time to fight. Disciple, let’s go back.” Green Flame Star Lord said directly.

“Yes.” Di Huo nodded respectfully.

Green Flame Star Lord smiled at Jian Wushuang and then left with Di Huo.

“What a pity.” Golden Feather Star Lord looked at Jian Wushuang with emotion.

It was obvious that Jian Wushuang was much more talented than Di Huo and had greater potential. It was a pity that Jian Wushuang did not agree to his invitation.

“Well, Blood Sword, Gui Yun, I’m leaving too.” Golden Feather Star Lord left directly.

After the two Star Lords left —

“Blood Sword, I just heard you say that you’re going to the Nine Luminaries Galaxy?” Gui Yun looked at him.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Since you’re going to the Nine Luminaries Star Field, then after you leave the Bone Pupil Star Field, your next stop should be the Pillheart Star Field,” Gui Yun said.

“That’s right.” Jian Wushuang looked at Gui Yun with some confusion, not knowing why Gui Yun asked this question.

“That’s right. After you passed the fourth level of the Principle Sea, I reported this news to the higher-ups. You should know that the creator of the Principle Sea is a top force in the depths of the universe. This top force created the Principle Sea and spread it across all the major Star Fields in the universe. Moreover, there is a watcher beside the Principle Sea in each major Star Field. Naturally, it has some special purpose.”

“The special intention is to find some geniuses. A genius like you, Blood Sword, will certainly attract the attention of the high-level experts of this force. They might even arrange someone to contact you. So I hope you can leave a message token so that I can contact you,” Gui Yun said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Haha, don’t worry, my friend. It’s not a bad thing for you,” Gui Yun said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang pondered for a moment and nodded slightly.

Indeed, the forces behind the Nine Emperor Pavilion and the Principle Sea were all Supreme Rulers in the universe. In front of such a Supreme Ruler, even a supreme was nothing, not to mention a genius who had yet to grow up.

If there was no absolute reason, these super forces would certainly not lower themselves to attack a genius. At most, they would try to recruit these geniuses with various conditions or at a price.

For example, the Nine Emperor Pavilion established the special list of the Nine Emperor List.

Even if the super forces behind the Principle Sea really wanted to contact him, they would probably come to recruit him. This was indeed not a bad thing for Jian Wushuang.
