Chapter 1515: Crazy Fight For The White Blaze Fruits

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The commotion this time around was indeed too big.

It was a lot greater than the commotion from the previous twelve times when the White Blaze Fruits appeared. Naturally, more Universe Gods were attracted as well.

Among those Universe Gods, Jian Wushuang was part of the batch of people who was the closest to the point of appearance. He was less than a hundred miles away!

With such a short distance, by using his speed, Jian Wushuang managed to reach the location in a short time.

However, after reaching the location, even Jian Wushuang was shocked by the scene in front of him.

On a vast wasteland, the ground had split open due to an explosion. In the void above it, there were eight floating, bright white lights spread across the area and what was shrouded inside the white lights were the White Blaze Fruits.

A total of eight White Blaze Fruits!

“Gosh!” Jian Wushuang could not help but opened his eyes big.

During the twelve appearances previously, two fruits had appeared every time. At most, three fruits had appeared.

However, just then, eight fruits had appeared at once!

It was crazy, really crazy!

All the Universe Gods who rushed to the point of appearance at once went insane when they saw the eight White Blaze Fruits.

Even Jian Wushuang’s eyes were burning with excitement.

“Snatch!”

With a flash of shrill light, Jian Wushuang unleashed his fastest speed instantly and eighteen shadows appeared at the same time.

In the void in the vicinity, there were seven other people who charged toward the eight White Blaze Fruits. All the eyes of the seven Universe Gods were dyed scarlet in color and they were using all their strength to head toward the eight White Blaze Fruits. However, due to the differences in their speeds, four people were the fastest to arrive at the eight White Blaze Fruits.

Jian Wushuang was among the four people.

“Collect!”

With a swing of his big hand, Jian Wushuang put the two White Blaze Fruits that were the closest to him into a Qian Kun Ring with lightning speed. After that, his body appeared in front of the third White Blaze Fruit in the blink of an eye and he was about to collect it.

“That’s mine.”

A shrill voice could be heard. A purple-clothed youth with a strict expression had already lost his senses. With a swing of his hand, he snatched the White Blaze Fruit away. Moreover, he had also seized another White Blaze Fruit moments ago. This meant that he had also gotten two White Blaze Fruits at the same time.

After seeing what had been done, Jian Wushuang’s expression turned grave. His icy-cold eyes shot a glance at the strict-looking youth and he activated his Soul Power.

“Ah!”

The strict-looking youth gave a horrible shriek. While shrieking, his consciousness was completely destroyed.

“A normal Universe God dares to snatch my item. You are really courting death!”

Jian Wushuang was filled with murderous aura. With a wave of his hand, he took the strict-looking youth’s Qian Kun Ring. By sweeping his consciousness past it, his eyes glowed brilliantly at once.

This youth had just collected two White Blaze Fruits. In addition to the two White Blaze Fruits that he had collected as well, this meant that Jian Wushuang had gotten another four White Blaze Fruits.

Moreover, it was obvious that the fight for the White Blaze Fruits had only just begun.

“Continue snatching.”

Jian Wushuang locked on to a black-robed old married woman near him. His Soul Power had already noticed that the black-robed woman had also managed to get a White Blaze Fruit.

Eighteen shadows appeared and Jian Wushuang appeared in front of the black-robed woman at once.

“Jian Wushuang? Not good!” the black-robed woman was shocked.

“Die!” Jian Wushuang was filled with murderous intent. His Blood Mountain Sword was extended like a spiritual snake and it was also filled with a small bit of the Power of Spacetime. Hence, the black-robed woman had no time to block it at all and the sword light struck her body.

“Argh!” the black-robed woman spit out a big mouthful of blood on the spot and her aura plunged down.

“Not dead?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes squinted slightly. However, he was not too surprised.

There were innumerable Universe Gods with impressive abilities. Although the black-robed woman looked normal and had no reputation, her abilities should be quite close to making it into the Universe God ranking list.

“Jian Wushuang, I will give the White Blaze Fruit to you. I shall not participate in this fight anymore,” the black-robed woman suppressed her fear and anger. She then tossed out a white light. The white light was the White Blaze Fruit.

Jian Wushuang extended his hand and caught the white light.

“The fifth fruit!” Jian Wushuang was delighted.

At that moment, an intense fight by the side attracted Jian Wushuang’s attention. In particular, his attention was focused on a plump young man in the intense fight.

“The sixth White Blaze Fruit is with this young man!” With the flash of a shrill light, Jian Wushuang prepared to head over to snatch the sixth White Blaze Fruit.

However, all of a sudden… Buzz!

Quietly, the plump young man’s eyes became dim. His body also became weak and he started to fall downward.

“A consciousness attack?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned serious. The consciousness attack was not from him.

Swoosh!

A strange black shadow appeared beside the body of the plump young man. With a stretch of his hands, he grabbed the plump young man’s Qian Kun Ring.

As for the four Universe Gods who were originally fighting with the plump young man, they went on to attack the black shadow instinctively after seeing such a scene.

However, in the end, the four Universe Gods’ eyes turned dim quietly, just like before.

“What a strong consciousness attack,” Jian Wushuang’s expression turned grave.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Sounds of the wind being disturbed could be heard and many Universe Gods arrived.

Although the fight moments ago could be said to be slow, in actual fact, it was completed hastily. In a short amount of time, the eight White Blaze Fruits had all landed into the hands of someone. In particular, two people had managed to get one White Blaze Fruit each and had they left a long time ago. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

As for the remaining six fruits, they were with Jian Wushuang and the black shadow which had appeared abruptly.

“It’s Jian Wushuang, who is ranked fifth on the Universe God ranking list. As for the other one… It’s Xin Zhu!”

“Jian Wushuang and Xin Zhu. Two experts who are ranked fifth and sixth in the Universe God ranking list respectively are both here.”

When the Universe Gods who had just arrived saw the two of them standing opposite one another in the void, they were surprised. Naturally, they did not dare to make a move.

“Xin Zhu?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and stared at the black-robed young man in front of him. The black-robed young man was handsome and cold like a demon.

Xin Zhu had an extremely infamous reputation in the Eternal Chaotic World.

Before Wu Bei’s cave appeared, among the Universe Gods, only the God Destroying King, Zi Dongwang and Demon Girl Ling Luo could overpower him. Moreover, in the eyes of many Universe Gods, Xin Zhu was more frightening that the God Destroying King, Zi Dongwang and Ling Luo.

The God Destroying King was recognized as the number one of the Universe Gods. He was powerful, and in a one-to-one match, no one aside from Real Gods could be his opponent. However, if he were to be besieged by a large number of Universe Gods, say if there were hundreds of Universe Gods fighting him at the same time, he would also have no choice but to escape miserably.

However, Xin Zhu was different.

Xin Zhu was an expert who was proficient in consciousness attacks.

And for those people who were proficient in consciousness attacks, numbers were the least of their worries.

For example, since the second level of the cave had opened, the White Blaze Fruits had appeared twelve times. There were two times where Xin Zhu had managed to make it and he had acquired the White Blaze Fruit in front of countless Universe Gods. Moreover, he stood in his position openly and did not?try to escape. As for the hundreds of Universe Gods near him, they could only watch him. No one dared to attack.
