Translator: EndlessFantasy TranslationEditor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, are you saying that your wife was brought here many years ago by the people of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley because she is suitable to cultivate the supreme divine skill of the Valley?” Demon Master Chen Huo looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“That’s not right, is it?” Demon Master Chen Huo frowned. “Most of the secret skills in the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley require one to abandon emotion. As for the supreme skill, it is said that only those who are absolutely pure in heart and have not been touched by the secular world are qualified

to cultivate it. If the person you are looking for is really your wife, how could she not be touched by the secular world and have no emotion at all?”

“She is indeed my wife, but she is from my previous life. When we entered the reincarnation passage at the same time, my memory of my previous life was not affected at all. However, her memory seems to have disappeared, so she doesn’t know who I am in this life,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Is that so?” Demon Master Chen Huo raised his eyebrows and then said, “Heavenly Sword Marquis, if we do as you say, this matter will be troublesome.”

“First of all, your wife has lost her memory of her previous life, so she can’t recognize you at all. Moreover, since she has already come to the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley to cultivate the divine skill, it’s fine if she hasn’t made any progress or achievements in the divine skill, but once she has

cultivated the divine skill to a certain level, she won’t have any feelings at all. At this point, even if she has restored her memory of her previous life, I’m afraid it won’t be of any use.”

“Lknow. That’s why I cultivated to this level as soon as possible and came here to ask for her right after I had a certain level of strength,” Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice.

He had been very worried.

He was worried that if his wife cultivated the divine skill to a certain level and completely abandoned all emotions, her memories from her previous life would never be found again, and even if they were found, they would be immediately discarded.

That was why he had seized every opportunity to increase his strength. He wanted to reach the point where he could face the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley head-on as soon as possible.

But now, he had already reached this step.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, what do you plan to do?” Demon Master Chen Huo looked over. “First of all, I have to remind you that although the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley is only an overlord of the Second Heaven, it is different from other sects of the Second Heaven. The Supreme

Emotion-forgetting Valley has a very deep foundation, and there has always been an extremely terrifying old monster hiding there. It is very difficult to provoke.”

Of course, Jian Wushuang knew who the old monster was. It was the old Valley Master in the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley who had mastered the supreme divine skill. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Jian Wushuang now knew more about the old Valley Master.

Moreover, he had heard from Temple Master Bai Xing that once the old Valley Master went crazy, even experts at the level of the three Saint Realm Masters and Temporal Temple Master would have a headache.

“Don’t worry, I know my own strength. I Won’t be so stupid as to go to the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley and take my wife away. However, with my current strength and status, the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley won’t dare to look down on me. I can pay a visit to the Supreme

Emotion-forgetting Valley first and see if there are any other ways for me to take my wife away. No matter what they offer, I can agree to it!”

“But if Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley doesn’t give me any chance to negotiate, then it’s not my fault.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining with a fierce light.

Upon hearing this, Demon Master Chen Huo narrowed his eyes slightly but did not say anything more.

“Let’s go down.”

Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chen Huo descended directly toward the entrance of Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley.

As soon as Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chen Huo landed on the open space at the entrance of the valley, several disciples of the valley immediately went up to greet them.

Most of the disciples of the valley were women. The female disciple in the lead asked, “Who are you and why are you here?”

“Please go in and inform them that the sixth inspector of the Temporal Temple, Heavenly Sword Marquis, is here to pay a visit,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis?” The female disciple immediately raised her head and looked at Jian Wushuang in shock.

Jian Wushuang was too famous now. From the high and mighty Principles Masters to the ordinary cultivators in the Divine Beginning Realm, most of them had heard of his name. As for the disciples of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, they naturally knew of Jian Wushuang.

When they learned that the Immortal Saint was the famous Heavenly Sword Marquis, the disciples were shocked, but the female disciple quickly calmed down.

“Please wait a moment, I’l go in and report immediately.” The female disciple rushed into the valley as fast as she could.

Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chen Huo were not in a hurry. They waited quietly at the entrance of the valley.

Ina quiet attic in the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, Longyu, the Valley Master of the valley, was living there.

At this moment…

“Heavenly Sword Marquis?”

Dressed in a plain robe, Longyu stood up with a cold expression. “Did you really see him? is he really here to visit?”

“I didn’t see him myself. I came to see you as soon as I received the report. But now, Heavenly Sword Marquis is very famous in the Divine Beginning Realm. Besides, almost all the sects and forces have seen the mirror image of the collision between Heavenly Sword Marquis and the three Saint Realms.

They all know what he looks like. Therefore, there should be no one pretending to be him.” Standing in front of Longyu was a black-clothed woman, the black-clothed woman was an elder of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, and she was also a Principles Master.

“What should have come has come.” Longyu narrowed her eyes slightly.

“valley Master, which one is Heavenly Sword Marquis coming for?” The black-clothed woman asked.

“Who else can it be for?” Longyu glanced at the black-clothed woman and sighed inwardly.

She had long known that Jian Wushuang would come to her one day.

Jian Wushuang had saved the genius disciple Han Xin in the Blood Wave Realm. Later, he asked her about Leng Rushuang, which alerted her. When she returned to the valley, Han Xin reported the matter to Longyu, who immediately ordered people to investigate.

As the mirror image of Jian Wushuang fighting with the three Saint Realms spread in the Divine Beginning Realm, the Principles Master who had taken Leng Rushuang away in the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley recognized Jian Wushuang at a glance.

Back in the Golden Crow Nine Realms, Jian Wushuang had revealed his life-level pressure and summoned the power of the will of heaven to suppress Leng Rushuang in order to prevent the people of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley from taking her away, immediately after, countless experts from

the three Saint Realms descended. The rule master had witnessed all of this, and he had always remembered Jian Wushuang. Therefore, when he saw the mirror image of Jian Wushuang again, he immediately confirmed Jian Wushuang’s identity.
