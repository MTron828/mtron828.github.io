“Although I forced Great Emperor Colored Glaze to back off for now, in no time, Great Emperor Colored Glaze will definitely bring other experts along again. She might even lead all the experts from various forces in Eternal Chaotic World over,” Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave.

Green Fire World, its value was really unbelievable.

When Emperor God Xie Xin had first discovered Green Fire World and only find out briefly about Green Fire World, he determined that Green Fire World had the potential to become another powerful sanctuary.

But in actual fact, the potential of Green Fire World was far beyond what Emperor God Xie Xin and Sir God Xue Dao had imagined.

Such a place, even Sanctuary Alliance would care about.

Forget about the experts from various forces.

As for Jian Wushuang, he naturally wanted to protect Green Fire World alone and not let various forces in Sanctuary Alliance carve it up.

Hence, he was destined to go against the entire Eternal Chaotic World!!

“Regardless, Green Fire World is my hometown, it is my root!”

“As long as I am alive, I will not allow anyone to take a share of it!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands tightly and he had already made up his mind.

...

In the void near Green Fire World.

Swoosh!

Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s figure appeared again. At that very moment, there was coldness on her enchanting face and she didn’t look good at all.

Next to Great Emperor Colored Glaze, Emperor God Shi Yu and Sir God Xue Dao stood politely.

“The two of you, keep watch of Green Fire World from today onwards. Watch their every movement,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze commanded.

“Yes,” Emperor God Shi Yu and Sir God Xue Dao nodded.

Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s figure turned illusionary and vanished into thin air.

Emperor God Shi Yu looked calm at the sight but Sir God Xue Dao looked curious.

“I never expected that Great Emperor God Colored Glaze wouldn’t do anything to Jian Wushuang when she attacked personally. She was forced to retreat?” Sir God Xue Dao was surprised.

He knew Jian Wushuang’s reputation and he also knew of Jian Wushuang’s battle achievement.

However, these battle achievements weren’t enough to fight with a Great Emperor.

But then...

“Great Emperor Colored Glaze left. She had definitely wanted to invite other Great Emperor experts to attack together. However, even if a few Great Emperors joined forces, I’m afraid they could only force Jian Wushuang to hand out Green Fire World. As for killing Jian Wushuang... I reckon there is no one who dares to do so,” Sir God Xue Dao thought.

In the beginning, he had really thought Great Emperor Colored Glaze would kill Jian Wushuang to take revenge on his behalf.

However, he understood from the conversation between Great Emperor Colored Glaze and Jian Wushuang that Great Emperor Colored Glaze had scruples with the mysterious expert behind Jian Wushuang, Emperor Thirteen. She didn’t have the guts to kill Jian Wushuang for real. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Even though Jian Wushuang had humiliated her on the spot. He had called her an old woman and told her to leave but Great Emperor Colored Glaze had only wanted to teach him a lesson.

In other words, Great Emperor Colored Glaze had only pretended to promise him from the very beginning.

As Great Emperor Colored Glaze had scruples with Emperor Thirteen, the other Great Emperors that she invited should be the same as well.

To kill Jian Wushuang for real, Great Emperor Colored Glaze and the Emperor Gods that she was going to invite wouldn’t do.

“It seems that there is only one final move to take if I really want Sword Emperor to be killed for senior,” Sir God Xue Dao’s thought coldly

He didn’t react much so Emperor God Shi Yu by his side couldn’t see anything different in him.

...

In the vast void on ancient battlefield.

Great Emperor Colored Glaze floated in silence. Soon, a dark figure plunged over.

The dark figure belonged to Abysmal Saint Master.

“Colored Glaze, what’s the hurry?” Abysmal Saint Master appeared before Great Emperor Colored Glaze.

Abysmal Saint Master rushed to the ancient battlefield at the first instant. During the ninety years of wandering in the ancient battlefield, he had really obtained some opportunities but not many. At that moment, he had yet to receive any opportunity that would allow him to improve his power tremendously.

His power had yet to recover to his peak by then.

“I look for you, naturally there’s a good deal,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze looked at Abysmal Saint Master and immediately briefly told him about Green Fire World.

Great Emperor Colored Glaze said and Abysmal Saint Master’s gaze became sharp.

“The ancient battlefield nurtured a big world?” Abysmal Saint Master was astonished.

“Green Fire World does exist but it’s a pity that Jian Wushuang is there. I originally wanted to attack and conquer Green Fire World. But in the end, I was forced to retreat. I have no choice but to look for you,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze explained.

“Jian Wushuang? Why is this boy everywhere?” Abysmal Saint Master’s gaze was cold.

To Jian Wushuang, he harbored murderous intention.

“If I’m not mistaken, Green Fire World should be Jian Wushuang’s hometown, where his roots are. The reason why his cultivation speed is so shocking and why he is so talented, it should be related to Green Fire World,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze said.

“That’s right. Jian Wushuang is too eye-catching. I reckon he is much more brilliant than Emperor Bai was back then. Such top genius would be considered unbelievable in the first era, let alone the second era. I think only Green Fire World could nurture such impressive genius. This boy is lucky that he could be born in such a place.

Abysmal Saint Master clenched his hand and turned to Great Emperor Colored Glaze by his side, “Colored Glaze, you came to look for me to join forces with me to fight Jian Wushuang, right?”

“Yes,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze nodded, “Jian Wushuang is Green Fire World’s biggest reliance. If we want to conquer Green Fire World, we have to get rid of Jian Wushuang first.”

“According to what you said, there was a Great Emperor with Jian Wushuang and he has a treasure that could control five dark shadows that possess the fighting power of a Great Emperor if forces join. On top of that, he himself has trump cards to hand... With such fighting power, even if I were to work together with you during my peak time, we might not stand a chance,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s gaze grew dim.

That was true. Although Abysmal Saint Master and her were both powerful Great Emperors, Abysmal Saint Master had yet to recover from his injury completely. With the two of them joining forces, they could at most be evenly matched with Jian Wushuang. Even though they had the upper hand, it wasn’t enough.

“How about this? Let’s wait for a while. Let me ask another person,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

“Alright,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze nodded.

Abysmal Saint Master immediately sent a message.

The two Great Emperors waited in the void for a while. Very soon, the third Great Emperor joined them.

With purple robes, a lazy look and a middle-aged appearance, he looked rather gentle.

The purple-robed lazy middle-aged man was Great Emperor Zi Xu in fifth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list!
