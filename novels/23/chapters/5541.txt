Chapter 5540 ¬†Candle Dragon Bloodline

Buzz!

Candle Dragon Wings spread in an instant. His left hand clenched into a fist, and crimson stripes appeared on his arm, containing the power of the Beast God.

However, these stripes couldn't connect with the wings.

At his brow, the Eye of Candle Dragon also emerged.

The ancient dragon became angrier as it looked; that was something from its ancestor.

Before it could unleash its fury, Jian Wushuang took the initiative, imitating the dragon's claw. His palm transformed into the Candle Dragon Claw.

Hiss!

In the sky, black mist was swallowed by five spatial rifts.

These rifts were left by the Beast God Claw. Although they lacked the power of the Beast God Weapon, they contained abundant Life pwoer.

Although the opponent didn't suffer any substantial damage from this claw strike, the insult was significant.

"Cultivator, you have angered me; I will have you dead!"

Jian Wushuang sneered, "Weren't you angry from the beginning?"

Although the opponent was already a tier 6 Emperor, judging from the conversation, their wisdom was mediocre.

No wonder they were called desolate beasts rather than demonic beasts.

The ones Jian Wushuang encountered in the Western Sea were demonic beasts.

It was strange; some powerful demonic beast experts preferred to call themselves desoalte beasts.

Desolate beasts had low intelligence, unable to compare with demonic beasts.

The only strength they possessed was their own power.

Demonic beasts were similar to human clans, with great reproductive capabilities and decent intelligence, reproducing at a fast pace.

In some Original Universes within the river of time, situations had arisen where the entire universe consisted of demonic beasts.

The struggle for existence!

In some Original Universes, certain errors led to an imbalance in the Qi, resulting in the emergence of a singular group of beings.

In the universe where he resided, the human race dominated, with few powerful members of the demon race.

This was also a drawback of the Original Universe.

It was the same in the Divine Power Universe; being too singular was not ideal.

Divine power and Void power could coexist.

If a Universe Master intervened, they could directly refine the two into a unified whole.

Unfortunately, their temporal river lacked a Universe Master.

In the battle against the ancient dragon, Jian Wushuang found it effortless. Although he couldn't severely damage the opponent, the dragon found it challenging to harm him.

It couldn't even touch him.

The difference in speed was too great.

On his journey through space, he had come a long way and was about to master the realm of black holes.

However, the ancient dragon, even when entering the gaps in space, had to forcefully shatter the void.

It was quite clumsy. Finnd ùíèew chapters on nùíêve/lbiùíè(.)com

"Dao Image!" Jian Wushuang appeared behind the dragon, chanting, and a massive manifestation of the Dao Image appeared behind him.

It was the symbol of the Origin Source.

The pale green gigantic Dao Image made Jian Wushuang appear benevolent.

That was the source of Life.

The ancient dragon tilted its head, its massive eyes fixed on Jian Wushuang, revealing a hint of panic.

It thought the ancestor had descended.

That was the oppressive force of bloodline.

"How is this possible!" The ancient dragon roared in disbelief, unable to continue, "How could the mere human race suppress my bloodline!"

They had been engaged in a battle for quite some time, and the opponent had been playing a cat-and-mouse game all along.

However, he was exploring.

Probing for the opponent's weaknesses.

It wasn't easy to kill this ancient dragon.

Direct confrontation was disadvantageous!

He could only seek unconventional methods.

In the end, he discovered that it was related to the power of life. For a moment, his head spun, either due to the opponent being too foolish, affecting his judgment.

At this level of ancient colossal beast, the most feared was the suppression in the bloodline.

The power of Life was the most effective against it.

"You foolish creature, in the presence of the ancestor, you don't even pay your respects!" Jian Wushuang merged with the Dao Image, his figure instantly transformed into a colossal Candle Dragon spanning billions of miles.

As the momentum rose, the aura of the candle dragon was remarkably similar.

The ancient dragon was once again shocked!

"Ancestor!" It couldn't distinguish between real and fake for a moment.

As a tier 6 Emperor-level ancient dragon, it possessed only a trace of the bloodline power of the Candle Dragon. It had never encountered the real Candle Dragon, only vaguely sensed it through the bloodline inheritors.

"Kneel!" The aura of the transformed Candle Dragon by Jian Wushuang was incredibly ferocious.

There was a true kingly aura, as if descended from the heavens.

The innate Beast Gods, each one was a peak Universe Master, essentially a king.

The ancient dragon, upon hearing the command to kneel, softened its four claws for a moment, almost kneeling on the ground.

Then, it came to its senses, roared in anger, and rushed towards Jian Wushuang to fight desperately.

"You dare to deceive me!" The ancient dragon was greatly infuriated.

Jian Wushuang shook his head; it was somewhat uninteresting, feeling like battling a child.

"Life Universe!"

Buzz!

In the depths of the desolation, the withered vines and rotten leaves began to burst with powerful vitality.

A struggling wildcat in the mud puddle, sensing the intense power of Life, instantly broke free, only one paw visible before, now entirely emerging from the mire.

The weak and dying demonic beasts, touched by the force of Life, revived and erupted with tremendous life potential.

A near-death patient sat up in astonishment!

But that's about it.

Within the Life Universe's enveloping billions of miles, everything was revived.

A faint bit of fate energy gathered within Jian Wushuang.

This move not only had the power to kill enemies but could also plunder fate energy.

Assisting the weak would gain the Fate Energy Origin Source from the Qishen Temple. Though it was somewhat insignificant, using the Life Universe in some mortal realms would likely garner a massive amount of luck and fate energy.

However, he had not yet achieved the status of Emperor, so fate energy was somewhat redundant for him, offering little significant aid.

Moreover, he had no leisure or interest in gathering luck.

Not refining pills, not establishing a family or force; having so much fate energy was useless. It was better to improve one's strength.

In the outside world, it was different. Like the past Zhen Wuyang, gathering fate energy was because he was already invincible in the Great Si Region, having no room for improvement, only able to play with luck.

After arriving at the Qishen Temple, it was a constant and thrilling place for inheriting legacies. There was no time for such things; it was too low-level.

All life enveloped within the universe underwent transformation, yet the ancient desolate dragon alone continued to weaken steadily.

The power of Life was suppressed, and bloodlines began to dissipate.

Without the bloodline of the Candle Dragon, the levels of life were also suppressed, and apart from the physical body, all abilities grew weaker.

The divine body rapidly declined, and although the physical body was not greatly affected, it began to lose a significant amount of vitality.

The once-existent healing ability was no more.

In other words, each of his attacks became a massive trauma, one that could not be healed.

"Despair!" Jian Wushuang held the Jueyun Sword upside down, gazing at the ancient desolate dragon.

The Candle Dragon's Dao Image did not disperse; it stood firm in the sky, staring at the ancient desolate dragon, while his true body charged forward.

Ready to slaughter!

The exchange between the two was not too swift; they had already been deadlocked for an hour.
