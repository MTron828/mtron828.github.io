“Well, I have to talk to the Pavilion Masters of some nearby Star Fields to get accurate information.” Ruler Chenyun paused for a moment. “Well, please wait here for a moment. I’ll contact the branch Pavilion Masters of those Star Fields immediately.”

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded and did not rush them.

Ruler Chenyun immediately ordered people to serve them good wine and food.

Half a day later, Ruler Chenyun gave a definite answer.

“Blood Sword Master, I’ve just compiled this list. It can be sent to this Star Field in the shortest time. The level of the special crystals on this list is much higher than the previous list. See if you’re satisfied.” Ruler Chenyun sent another list to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took it, scanned it with his consciousness, and nodded slightly.

Indeed, the level of the special gems on this list was much higher than the previous one.

“Devil Flame, what do you think?” Jian Wushuang communicated with Devil Flame in his mind.

“It’s not bad.”

Devil Flame also said, “Although there are only dozens of gems on this list, they are not low-level. The highest level of these gems can help me recover my divine body the most. One is Ice Essence Crystals, and the other is Gold-Fire Magic Stones. Although these two gems are still inferior to the gold-fire world stone, they are still very good, especially the Gold-Fire Magic Stones. If there are a certain number of them, I can recover 10% to 20% of my divine body in a short time.”

Jian Wushuang immediately raised his head after receiving the answer from Devil Flame. “Ruler Chenyun, I need two kinds of crystals, Ice Essence Crystals and Gold-Fire Magic Stones. I wonder how much they are worth?”

“Ice Essence Crystals and Gold-Fire Magic Stones?” Ruler Chenyun raised his eyebrows, he smiled and said, “Blood Sword Master, you have good taste. On the latest list I gave you, these two kinds of crystals are of the highest level, especially Gold-Fire Magic Stones, which are extremely rare in the edge of the universe.”

“Of course, the higher the level, the higher the value. Moreover, these two crystals need to be sent from other Star Fields, so the price is even higher.”

Ruler Chenyun only said that the price was higher, but he did not mention the specific value of these two crystals.

Jian Wushuang said directly, “Not only do I need to send these two crystals from other Star Fields, but I also have a request, which is that the speed must be fast. Within 500 years, they must be sent to this Star Field and handed over to me.”

“What? Within 500 years?” Ruler Chenyun stared at him.

“Why? Can’t you do it?” Jian Wushuang glanced at him.

“I can do it. The Nine Emperor Pavilion is spread throughout the universe and has connections with other Star Fields. There are special space passages between us. If we use them, we can send them to you within 50 years, let alone 500 years!”

“But the key is the universe passage. Unlike the space passages in the Star Fields, it’s extremely difficult to open any of them. The cost is enormous. And this is just the creation. Every time we use the universe space passage, we also have to pay a huge price. It’s the same for the short-distance universe space passage. But to cross the Star Fields, the cost is even more ridiculous.” Ruler Chenyun frowned.

“I know the price is high, and I’m prepared for it. You don’t have to waste your breath on me. Just tell me how much it will cost to deliver these two crystals to me within 500 years,” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

Ruler Chenyun pondered for a moment, then stretched out a finger and said, “One Gold-Fire Magic Stone costs one Universe Origin Stone!”

Jian Wushuang’s pupils suddenly shrank.

“What a big demand,” Demon Dragon Lord said coldly, and a faint murderous aura swept out from his body.

Ruler Chenyun and the other two Pavilion Masters of the Nine Emperor Pavilion were shocked when they sensed this murderous aura.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand, indicating Demon Dragon Lord to restrain his aura.

“One Universe Origin Stone?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

Universe Origin Stone was a special unit used for trading in the vast universe.

In the vast universe, there were two kinds of currency. One was Universe Crystals, which was the first universal currency that Jian Wushuang came into contact with. When he received the blood north inheritance, he got some Universe Crystals, at that time, he did not know the use of Universe Crystals. Later, when he entered the Universe Battlefield, he found out.

However, Universe Crystals were only the most basic currency, and most of them were used by Principles Masters and some weaker Rulers.

Rulers who had reached a certain level of strength used Universe Origin Stones to trade.

In the universe, the ratio of Universe Origin Stones to Universe Crystals was 1:100 million.

In other words, 100 million Universe Crystals could be exchanged for one Universe Origin Stone.

However, in this Star Field, even those Principles Masters who had been adventuring in the Universe Battlefields all year round and had true treasures would only have 100 Universe Crystals in total, even for a first-tier Ruler, their total wealth would only be around 100,000 Universe Crystals. If they had a supreme true treasure, their wealth might be a little more, but it would not be much more.

One Universe Origin Stone was equivalent to 100 million Universe Crystals, which was an astronomical figure for most first-level Rulers.

On the market, a supreme true treasure could be worth between 1 million and 2 million Universe Crystals.

One Universe Origin Stone was equivalent to dozens or even nearly a hundred supreme true treasures.

Demon Dragon Lord could not be blamed for saying that Ruler Chenyun was asking for too much. Under normal circumstances, a golden-fire magic stone did not need one Universe Origin Stone. At most, 0.1 Universe Origin Stone would be enough.

“Blood Sword Master, I know that the price is relatively expensive, but there’s no other way. Your request is too high. You must send it to this Star Field within 500 years. For 500 years, you can only rely on the universe space passage,” Ruler Chenyun said solemnly.

“What about Ice Essence Crystals?” Jian Wushuang asked again.

“The value of Ice Essence Crystals is slightly lower than Gold-Fire Magic Stones, but if it is sent within 500 years, it will also cost 0.9 Universe Origin Stones,” Ruler Chenyun said.

Jian Wushuang fell silent.

In his heart, he was asking Devil Flame, “Devil Flame, how many Gold-Fire Magic Stones or Ice Essence Crystals do you need to recover 20% of your gold-swallowing divine body?”

“If all of them are Gold-Fire Magic Stones, 100 should be enough. If all of them are Ice Essence Crystals, I’m afraid you’ll need about 120,” Devil Flame replied. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“100 Gold-Fire Magic Stones means 100 Universe Origin Stones.” Jian Wushuang could not help narrowing his eyes.
