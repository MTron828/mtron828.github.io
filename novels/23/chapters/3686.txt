Chapter 3688: Fierce Battle

Clang!

Jian Wushuang moved his body, and the sound of metal clashing rang out of nowhere.

As if the heaven and earth had just opened and was being torn apart, the sword essence that Jian Wushuang burst out instantly swept across the nine heavens.

The terrifying aura and the shocking sword essence swept in all directions, causing the expressions of the three masters of the Saint Realm to change.

Even the three Masters of the Devil Cloud Star were stunned.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you are too arrogant.” The white-haired elder said with a hint of anger.

“Die.” The tall man took a step forward and directly rushed toward Jian Wushuang.

Whoosh!

A dazzling silver light suddenly flashed.

The silver claw formed by the tall man’s right hand easily tore the space apart like a blade.

As the air trembled, the silver claw rushed toward Jian Wushuang’s chest at lightning speed.

Seeing the silver claw coming, Jian Wushuang did not dodge and let the claw tear at his body.

Hiss…

The silver claw left a clear claw mark on Jian Wushuang’s body, but Jian Wushuang did not move at all.

“What?”

The tall man raised his head in shock.

Not long ago, in the Magic Smoke Valley, one of the three cosmic battlefields, he and the evil young man worked together to kill Jian Wushuang.

At that time, Jian Wushuang was still very weak in front of him, and his casual attack could cause great damage to Jian Wushuang. If Temporal Temple Master had not arrived in time, that battle…he could easily kill Jian Wushuang.

However, it had only been 3,000 years since the battle, yet Jian Wushuang did not dodge or dodge his attacks. He allowed all of his power to affect his divine body, but he did not move or suffer any damage?

How did this jump get to be so big?

Even if Jian Wushuang had broken through to become a Principles Master and possessed the battle strength of a Ruler, it was impossible for him to completely ignore his attacks?

“Your attacks are just scratching my itch.” Jian Wushuang looked at the tall man in front of him with a mocking expression.

“Bastard, if it weren’t for the fact that I was too restricted in this world and was unable to unleash my full strength, do you think you would be able to withstand my attack head-on?” The tall man was still unwilling to admit Jian Wushuang’s current strength.

What he did not know was that since Jian Wushuang had cultivated the first level of the supreme eternal celestial body, an attack at the level of an elementary Ruler like him was indeed unable to shake him.

Even if the tall man’s strength was at its peak, Jian Wushuang could still easily withstand that claw attack without dodging.

“I’ve already asked you to attack first. Now, you should also take my attack.”

Jian Wushuang did not use his supreme treasure magic weapon. Instead, he used his finger as a sword and slashed with one hand.

It was a casual strike, but it had activated the origin of the sword principle universe. At the same time, it carried the power of Jian Wushuang’s divine power, which was comparable to that of an elementary Ruler.

Crash!

As his finger fell, a towering sword shadow instantly slashed out.

The tall man’s face changed drastically. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Behind him, the evil-looking young man’s face suddenly sank. Buzz!

The space-time trembled, and endless power of space-time principles pressed toward Jian Wushuang. Even the sword shadow he used was weakened by the power of space-time.

However, it was only weakened. The sword shadow did not completely disappear, but continued to slash at the tall man.

“Get lost!”

The tall man waved his sharp claws and forcefully collided with the sword shadow.

As a result, the towering sword shadow seemed to look at each other as if they were facing a huge sea wave. In an instant, it defeated his attack. Then, the mighty sword shadow covered his body.

“Hum!”

With a muffled groan, the tall man suddenly retreated. His face was a little paler than before.

It was slow to say, but in fact, from the moment the tall man fought with Jian Wushuang to the moment when the tall man was defeated by Jian Wushuang’s sword shadow annihilation, it was all done in a flash.

In this flash, the battle between Jian Wushuang and the tall man had already been decided, and the outcome was very clear.

“It seems that the Ruler of the three Saint Realms has been pushed back?”

“Not just pushed back, but completely crushed by the Heavenly Sword Marquis.”

“Yes, crushed. I saw it clearly. The Heavenly Sword Marquis didn’t dodge or dodge the Ruler’s attack, but his body wasn’t moved at all. On the contrary, the Ruler simply used his finger as a sword and casually used his sword techniques to crush him.”

“How can this be? Isn’t that an expert at the Ruler Realm?”

“It feels like their identities have been switched. Heavenly Sword Marquis is the real Ruler, while the Ruler is just an Immortal Saint. The gap between the two is too big.”

The countless experts from various forces who watched the battle through the mirror images were shocked.

They had doubted Jian Wushuang’s strength before and did not understand why he was qualified to stand between the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and Temporal Temple Master. But now, they vaguely understood.

The tall man’s face was extremely ugly when he was easily crushed by Jian Wushuang in front of so many people in the three Saint Realms.

But no matter how ugly it was, he had to admit that the gap between his strength and Jian Wushuang’s was indeed a little big.

“It seems that this kid’s strength is not affected at all in this world. He can completely unleash the power of a Ruler, but the three of us are too restricted. We can only use one-tenth of our strength at our peak. We are absolutely no match for him in a one-on-one fight,” the tall man said in a low voice.

“If that’s the case, then the three of us will attack together,” the devilish youth said.

“Mm.” The white-haired elder nodded slightly and said, “Let’s use the plan that the three of us have been using to attack the enemy together.”

“Alright.” The tall man and the devilish youth nodded in unison.

The three of them had been sent here by the Devil Cloud Star Master not only because they were experts at the Ruler level, but more importantly, the three of them often went on adventures together. The three of them had a very good understanding of each other, and he’s very good at killing people.

The three of them have even ganged up to kill a high master, although the high master escaped, but the high master almost died in the hands of the three of them, this is an indisputable fact.

Now, even though the strength of the three of them was greatly restricted and they could only display one-tenth of their peak strength, if the three of them worked together, they still had the confidence to rely on one-tenth of their combat strength, if the three of them worked together, they would be able to defeat a new Ruler.

Jian Wushuang, on the other hand, had just made a breakthrough, and he was not a Ruler yet.
