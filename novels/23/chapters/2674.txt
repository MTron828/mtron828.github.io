Chapter 2675: Muddy the Waters

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang stood in the Sacred Palace’s void with a mischievous smile on his face while holding an Interspatial Ring in his hand.

“I went to the Space-time Palace to see if I can gain something but didn’t expect to meet those people from Dragon Phoenix Pavilion. They’re so good that they send me so many Divine Elixir Pills.”

Jian Wushuang had decided to challenge the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciples to a gamble-fight on a whim, but the outcome was clear.

What a joke! Although he was only a Peak Earth Ultimate God, his combat power was definitely at the Peak Heaven Ultimate God level. How can he possibly lose a gamble-fight with the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciples?

“Unfortunately, these one thousand eight hundred Divine Elixir Pills are still not enough to help me to make a breakthrough from a Peak Earth Ultimate God to Heaven Ultimate God,” mumbled Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had absorbed and refined more than 1,200 Divine Elixir Pills to make a breakthrough from High-level Earth Ultimate God to Peak Earth Ultimate God. Besides that, he had also used the divine power he accumulated for decades. Therefore, he would need much more divine power to make a breakthrough from Peak Earth Ultimate God to Heaven Ultimate God.

The Divine Elixir Pills Jian Wushuang had accumulated were a far cry from enough as he estimated that he probably needed 5,000 to 6,000 Divine Elixir Pills.

“I won’t be able to make a next-level breakthrough anyway, so I don’t need to absorb and refine these Divine Elixir Pills in a hurry. Perhaps I can use it for some other purposes later.”

Jian Wushuang kept the Interspatial Ring, but his gazes gradually became sharper.

“My strength should have reached the peak now. It’s almost impossible to make any large progress in a short period, so it’s useless for me to stay in the Sacred Palace. I should start my next plan.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang left the Sacred Palace on the same day.

...

In a hidden secret chamber, Jian Wushuang had once again disguised himself as Su Han and used the black stone to cover up his real divine power breath in his body. He was originally only a Peak Earth Ultimate God but his divine power had already reached the High-level Heaven Ultimate God level.

He was carefully looking at a document with detailed information in his hand.

It was the information of various powerful sects in the Danyang Continent.

Danyang Continent was the core of the Danyang Holy Domain where experts gathered. The activities within Danyang Continent were complicated as there were countless sects, forces, and clans involved regardless of their size.

The top five forces are the Crimson Stone Fort, Nanwu Palace, Divine Demon Sect, Life and Death Tower, and the Dongfang Clan.

Jian Wushuang had seen information about the five forces before so he naturally did not need to read further.

He was looking at the information of the first-rate, second-rate, and even third-rate forces in the Danyang Continent.

Those forces must not be trifled with since they were able to occupy a place within Danyang Continent whereby Grand Ultimate Gods were respected, Heaven Ultimate Gods were plentiful, and Earth Ultimate Gods everywhere.

Take those first-rated forces as an example...

There were as many as twelve first-rated forces on the Danyang Continent and each of those forces had extraordinary strength. At the very least, they had at least two to three Grand Ultimate Gods and many experts under their leadership.

Anyone of those first-rated forces was not weaker than a small faction within Crimson Stone Fort.

The second-rated forces were able to secure a foothold within Danyang Continent from having Grand Ultimate Gods and a lot of Heaven Ultimate Gods with quite a few Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods—some as many as ten.

The third-rated forces were much weaker. The weaker ones generally had one or two Grand Ultimate Gods in charge and up to as many as twenty to thirty Heaven Ultimate Gods under their command.

Moving down below was the much weaker but larger number of third-rated forces. They could be destroyed very quickly.

‘There are five top forces and twelve first-rated forces with many second-rated and third-rated forces. The Danyang Continent has no less than a few hundreds of forces and sects if I add them all up together.’ Jian Wushuang pondered.

“The Danyang Continent is huge with matters looking good when the Crimson Stone Fort had absolute power during his tenure, but it’s now equivalent to a big pie that everyone is trying to get a share, yet all hell did not break loose? I guess it must be the five top forces that kept matters in check, right?”

Jian Wushuang had studied the situation in Danyang Continent for a long time.

The current Danyang Continent was indeed very peaceful. Contention between the forces was inevitable but fights between various forces to rake in profit were scarce.

The Danyang Continent managed to establish such a balance because of the top five forces’ deterrence effect.

Jian Wushuang planned to destroy the balance!

‘The reason Crimson Stone Fort is falling apart is due to their internal disputes being too chaotic with seven factions frantically competing within a single entity. I’ll be surprised if Crimson Stone Fort remained strong despite all that. The top four forces namely the Nanwu Palace, Divine Demon Sect, Life and Death Tower, and Dongfang Clan are all sitting back and relaxing while waiting to reap easy benefits. They are waiting for Crimson Stone Fort to wither away before striking and destroying the Crimson Stone Fort when the opportunity arises!’

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. ‘They are currently living so comfortably. I can’t let these top forces stay at ease, keep accumulating their power, and get stronger if I want to help Yin Su’er. I’ll have to muddy the waters and make things chaotic for the entire Danyang Continent as Crimson Stone Fort cannot be the only force in chaos. The more chaotic the better.’

‘Only when the entire Danyang Continent is completely messed up will the four top forces—Nanwu Palace, Divine Demon Sect, Life and Death Tower, and Dongfang Clan be pressured. They have their attention divided which will relieve some stress off Yin Su’er.’

Jian Wushuang thought carefully.

He had to find ways to instigate competition between various forces to muddy the waters in Danyang Continent. He needed manpower and authority to do so as he could not do it alone.

In other words, he needed to be in control of a powerful force.

It was too late for him to build up step-by-step as he had to take shortcuts and exercise absolute strength to forcefully subdue one of those forces.

That was why he was carefully looking at the information of each force and sect—seeking a suitable target.

“The easy ones are those who aren’t influential. I can easily subdue one or two of those forces with my strength, but they usually have weak foundations and very few experts.”
