4628 Shattering the Extreme Point

The Dragon Emperor Linhe and the Phoenix Matriarch, Feng Qi, were frowning. The fact that there was a Spring of Chaos sealed under the Qilin clan’s Luo du Galaxy was known to both the Dragon and Phoenix clans.

It was also because of this knowledge that he knew the importance of the Spring of Chaos.

They had almost reached the peak of the entire universe and had already begun to comprehend the laws of divine power. Naturally, they knew that the universe was not a vast universe that included countless Star Fields and Divine Kingdoms.

As early as the moment the universe was formed, the place where it finally condensed was the extreme point of the entire universe, which was also the weakest point of the universe. It was called the Spring of Chaos by the Qilin clan.

No one knew what was in the Spring of Chaos. Even the Qilin clan, who guarded the spring, did not have the slightest intention of exploring.

At this moment, the Dragon Emperor Linhe’s murky eyes began to clear up.

He looked at Lu Ting and finally said, “May I ask, when was the first time the Spring of Chaos split open?”

Lu Ting glanced at Dragon Emperor Linhe from the corner of his eyes and sneered, “You picked a good day back then, and now you’ve forgotten? Wasn’t it right before you started the war between the three clans?”

It was as if a thunderbolt had exploded in his mind. The body of Dragon Emperor Linhe trembled slightly, and he had to use his palms to support himself on the railing so that he would not fall.

Dragon Emperor Linhe seemed to have realized that his father, the Ancestral Dragon who had disappeared for countless chaos eras, had probably gone to the Spring of Chaos in the Qilin clan and disappeared.

There was dead silence in the Cosmic Boat. No one spoke, and everyone looked thoughtful.

With full acceleration, the Cosmic Boat arrived at the Qilin clan’s Rodu Star Field in less than a month.

Before he even got close, Jian Wushuang felt a strange invisible energy circling in the sky.

The divine power in his meridians started to stir restlessly and Jian Wushuang felt thirsty for no reason.

Then, they looked at each other, activated the divine power in their bodies, and flew toward Rodu.

Only Old Master’s half-closed eyes opened quietly, and his dark eyes looked into the distance.

“Greetings, Junior Patriarch,” When the general guarding the city saw Lu Ting and the others, he hurriedly flew forward.

“Quickly take me to the Patriarch,” Lu Ting said anxiously.

The Qilin clan general glanced at Jian Wushuang and the others, then lowered his voice in a panic and said, “Young Patriarch, something is wrong. The crack in the spring is getting bigger and bigger…”

“Then what’s the point of talking? Let’s go!” Lu Ting hurriedly shouted, his figure immediately flying towards the depths of Rodu Star Field.

Jian Wushuang glanced at the strange aura in the sky and then plunged into the depths.

In the center of the Rodu Star Field, a deep pit the size of a star was spewing out strange energy.

Over 8,000 descendants of the Qilin clan were gathered around the pit. The precious images of Qilin of different sizes were emitting a seven-colored light, as if they were trying their best to seal this place.

Wearing a golden armor, Patriarch Lu Shan was the closest to the pit. The giant form of a Qilin was roaring, as if it was struggling against some kind of power.

Stepping into the area, the referee subconsciously shouted when he heard the situation.

Lu Shan turned his head subconsciously, and the phantom form of the Qilin instantly became much dimmer.

Boom boom boom!

A huge amount of strange energy winds rose from the pit in the abyss, broke through the suppression, and completely gathered in the sky.

All the descendants of the Qilin clan took a few steps back and suffered different internal injuries.

In the next moment, the deep pit quickly collapsed, and a star-sized skull poked out of it!

The aura of someone who had reached the peak and was able to change the color of the entire Star Field instantly swept through Rodu.

Jian Wushuang was shocked and he immediately activated his boundless divine power.

Feng Qi immediately turned into her Natal Phoenix, covering the sky. She looked at the head in the abyss as if she was facing a great enemy.

Only Dragon Emperor Linhe stumbled backward and almost fell to the ground.

The awe-inspiring skull that emerged from the abyss was the head of a Dragon!

Everyone’s faces were extremely pale.

As the Dragon head of the Bone Dragon broke through the seal, its entire body made of white bones tore through the abyss and stretched across the sky!

The indescribable terrifying aura had even surpassed the pressure brought by Void God.

The Bone Dragon, which was larger than the entire Rodu Star Field, had exceeded the rules of the Divine Power Universe and could not possibly exist!

However, now, it was hovering above the entire Rodu Star Field, and a dark aura was seeping out from every single bone in its body. It was as if it could destroy the entire Qilin clan with a single claw.

“Let’s go!” Lu Shan roared. He had never thought of resisting the Bone Dragon’s peak strength.

All the descendants of the Qilin clan did not hesitate at all as they circulated their divine power and ran for their lives.

Feng Qi directly turned into a human and fell to the ground.

“Why aren’t you running? Do you want to wait for death here?!” Feng Qi said anxiously and grabbed Jian Wushuang’s hand to escape.

However, Jian Wushuang reached out to hold Feng Qi’s hand and struggled to break free.

“Are you crazy? If we don’t run now, are we just waiting for death?” Feng Qi was already a little flustered and exasperated. In her opinion, fighting an Ancestor realm expert head-on was already an act of courting death, let alone this existence that seemed to have exceeded the Ancestor realm.

Jian Wushuang shook his head slowly, “If I leave, the Divine Power Universe will be finished.”

Feng Qi could not help but say angrily, “Who do you think you are? Even if you can fight a Half Ancestor, you’re not even one-tenth of an Ancestor! Not to mention this big guy. You’re not trying to save anything, you’re just looking for death!”

Jian Wushuang remained unmoved.

“Alright, if you’re willing to court death here, I won’t accompany you anymore!” Feng Qi stomped her foot, and her body turned into a Fire Phoenix, flying into the distance.

After taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang looked at Old Master behind him, “Senior, can you help me?”

“You little brat, you’ve really brought me trouble.”

A faint sigh came from the old man’s mouth.

The hood was slowly pulled down, revealing a sickly face. “This universe has a great restraint on me, but it’s enough.”

As soon as he finished speaking, black water ripples surged out from under Old Master’s feet. He slowly stepped into the air to face the white Bone Dragon that was entrenched in the sky. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Jian Wushuang also activated his divine power to the extreme. The purple “Chuan” character between his eyebrows had become extremely lustrous.

Dragon Emperor Linhe looked up at the giant Dragon in the sky. As tears streamed down his face, his peak Half Ancestor realm divine power was activated.

The black scepter of power stomped in the air, creating ripples that immediately caught the attention of the white Bone Dragon.

The next moment, the huge bone c;aw tore the sky apart and crushed toward Old Master. Every inch it traveled, there were explosions.

“Heavenly Gate — Extreme Darkness!”

Brilliant and majestic divine power spread out, and unparalleled divine power pressed down at the same time.
