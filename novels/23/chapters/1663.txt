Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Including the purple moon that suddenly flew out from the back, there were a total of five moons attacking Jian Wushuang simultaneously and they were traveling at an unbelievable speed.

“That’s creepy,” Jian Wushuang moved and there myriads of shadows were cast.

His real body plunged through the void quickly and fled through the gap between the five purple moons.

Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow!

Five resplendent purple blade lights hit the void and slashed five huge cracks in the void. Then, they dispersed.

The very next moment, next to Real God Zi Ye’s body, another five purple moons merged while there was purple electricity flowing in Real God Zi Ye’s eyes. Then, he suddenly plunged.

Swoosh!

Real God Zi Ye’s real body turned into a purple sword light and appeared before Jian Wushuang’s real body along with his surrounding five purple moons.

“He instantly determined where my real body is. He lives up to his reputation as the top Chaotic Real God,” Jian Wushuang exclaimed in surprise. Blood Mountain Sword in his hand immediately let out a soaring sword intention too.

“Kill!”

Hong!

There was divine power soaring in Jian Wushuang body and it clashed against Real God Zi Ye.

The blade light and sword intention criss-crossed one another ferociously.

Real God Zi Ye’s blade skill and Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship were given full play and their speed was at their maximum too.

Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!

There was a clashing noise. After a short while, the two of them had at least collided a hundred times.

But it was obvious that Jian Wushuang had the lower hand during the fight.

Bang!

There was a low thud and Jian Wushuang rolled out gracelessly. He rolled continuously for a few hundred miles until he stopped.

After regaining stability, there was blood at the corner of Jian Wushuang’s lips.

As for Real God Zi Ye, he was in good condition and the aura on his body was growing stronger.

“Humph, how dare you fight close combat with me? You’re really stupid,” Real god Zi Ye looked at Jian Wushuang in disdain as he spoke with a voice that shook the earth.

Real God Zi Ye was best at close combat.

His close combat ability was shockingly strong. In collaboration with his blade skill, he was even scarier.

Compared to close body combat, as long as he didn’t run into an expert from Real God ranking list, he wasn’t afraid.

He heard what Real God Zi Ye said and Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes but wasn’t angry at all. On the contrary, he was excited.

“Real God Zi Ye, you really didn’t disappoint me,” Jian Wushuang looked at Real God Zi Ye with a faint smile. As he spoke, there was a boundless Ancient God power that instantly exploded.

Vroom vroom. His divine power billowed and Jian Wushuang’s body suddenly magnified and turned into a ten zhang tall dark gold Ancient God.

In his eyes, there was also a dark gold luster. In-between his eyebrows, there were six stars hanging upside down. The invincible might was illustrious.

“Ever since I broke through and became a Real God, this is the first time I go all out,” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and felt the boundless power in his palms, “Real God Zi Ye, you were saying earlier that your close combat ability is very strong, right?”

“Huh?” Real God Zi Ye creased his eyebrows and he had a bad feeling in the bottom of his heart.

“Hehe, close combat ability?” Jian Wushuang sneered as his huge Ancient God body immediately started changing.

Vroom. Huge heads and muscular arms that were substantiated with divine power extended from his body.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang had four heads and eight arms.

His eight muscular arms were each holding a sword. Hence, there was a total of eight swords, just like a demon.

“Humph, trying to be deliberately mystifying,” Real God Zi Ye wasn’t bothered.

In Eternal Chaotic World, there were many secret skills that enable one to grow more arms and heads. So what if there were extra? It would at most increase one’s fighting power by a slight bit. To many top experts, four and eight arms were the same.

However, he didn’t know that Jian Wushuang was actually performing a supreme unique skill of Ancient God tribe!

The unique skill wasn’t as simple as growing extra arms and heads. The most crucial part was that it contained an attack skill.

“Kill!”

Real God Zi Ye let out a low bellow and his body turned into purple light before he pounded Jian Wushuang again.

Jian Wushuang gripped the eight swords in his hands tightly as the eyes on his four heads shimmered with dark gold luster.

“Kill!”

Similarly, Jian Wushuang charged forward with his huge Ancient God body after letting out a roar.

The huge feet stepped onto the ground. With every step he took, there would be a huge hole created in the ground.

Their distance pulled closer very quickly.

The distance of a few hundred miles was instantly leaped. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The two not-proportionate bodies collided.

“Die!”

Real God Zi Ye had soaring murderous intention. The five purple moons around him were giving our resplendent brilliance, along with the purple saber in his hand that was shimmering with a cold gleam. They instantly formed six blade lights and swung out in madness.

“You, will die!”

Jian Wushuang’s four heads roared simultaneously and the eight divine swords in his hands formed eight flowing lights in collaboration with the unique attack method as they flew out.

Close combat!

Close combat in complete madness.

Both of them gave their all.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Bang! Psst!

There were continuous clashing noises that rang.

With such collisions, there were glints of sparks and fire.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang and Real God Zi Ye’s bodies crisscrossed.

Jian Wushuang continued to hold his eight swords while his eight eyes were filled with murderous intention. He steadied himself and turned around to look at Real God Zi Ye.

Real God Zi Ye then… looked extremely shocked.

His eyes were staring wide opened as they covered in disbelief.

The next moment…

“Poof!”

A mouthful of fresh blood was spat from Real God Zi Ye’s mouth and his face instantly turned pale.

“How could this be?” Real God Zi Ye muttered.

He knew clearly what had happened earlier.

Just as a splint of spark and fire exploded, he fought Jian Wushuang closely and exchanged blows like lightning. Their speed and combat skills were given full play.

But in the end, in such a short period of time, Jian Wushuang hit him six times!

In other words, he was slashed by six strokes while Jian Wushuang blocked his blade attack entirely.

He was defeated!

His close combat ability that he had always been proud of had failed and he was defeated. He was completely cornered.

If he wasn’t wearing a high-level armor and if didn’t cultivate his secret skill of defense to a high level, he would have been dead after the six strokes!
