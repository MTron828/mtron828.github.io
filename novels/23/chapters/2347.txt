Chapter 2348: Come Out And Die

Lin Tiefeng was hoping Jian Wushuang could make some advancements in the three months. For example, if he made a breakthrough in his cultivation base to the Middle Stage Chaotic Realm, he would have some means to go against Xiang Yi. However, it was clear that he was a little too optimistic.

Giving it more careful thoughts, no matter how demon-like a genius was, how great of an advancement could he get through closed-door cultivation within a short period of three months without any major chance encounter?

“Huh? Why is everyone looking so worried? Has something bad happened?” asked Jian Wushuang casually.

“Nephew Wushuang, we have just received news that Xiang Yi is back,” answered Lin Tiefeng.

“Xiang Yi?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled and clearly had not heard of Xiang Yi.

“Shuang, Xiang Yi is a genius of Xiang Family that headed for the Golden Cauldron Sect a long time ago. He’s now an Enforcement Elder in the Golden Cauldron Sect and a true Second Grade Divine Demon,” Zhuo Yunfeng explained.

“I see.” Jian Wushuang understood.

It was not surprising that everyone in the Lin Mansion would be so concerned about a Second Grade Divine Demon returning.

In the previous battle, although Jian Wushuang had been able to kill one of the three Divine Demon Realm experts who had teamed up against him, it didn’t mean that he was able to match a Second Grade Divine Demon.

“Is Xiang Yi coming for me?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“Yeah. It isn’t just that. Based on the information we have gathered, there will be several other Divine Demon Realm experts from Golden Cauldron Sect that will be returning with Xiang Yi. If things go as expected, they will make a move soon and head for Lin Mansion,” Lin Tiefeng remarked.

“Oh. That will really be a little troublesome,” Jian Wushuang mumbled to himself.

A Second Grade Divine Demon would be much stronger than a Third Grade Divine Demon. If he had to face a Second Grade Divine Demon alone, he would experience some pressure as well.

Moreover, several other Divine Demon Realm experts from the Golden Cauldron Sect would be with Xiang Yi as well.

“Wushuang, there should be two paths ahead of you now.” A gentle voice sounded and it was Fire Fairy who was speaking.

“First, you can take your parents and leave the Lin Family and Anjiu Prefecture immediately. This is a personal feud between the Xiang Family and you after all. Since you have not offended Golden Cauldron Sect directly, they won’t go after you with all their strength. All you need to do is to avoid them for some time and they won’t do anything to you.”

“Second, you can agree to our Thunder Sound Sect’s invitation. The conditions haven’t changed. I can send a message to the higher management of our Thunder Sound Sect to get them to send experts over as soon as possible. Even if they can’t make it in time, I’ll get our sect leader to send a message to the Golden Cauldron Sect to protect you. Although our Thunder Sound Sect might not be comparable to the Golden Cauldron Sect, they will likely respect us for such a small matter if our sect leader requests for it personally.”

“This would be your final two options. Even if you want to join other sects, there will probably be insufficient time.”

Fire Fairy’s analysis was on point and the surrounding crowd nodded in agreement.

From their perspectives, these were the only two options left for Jian Wushuang.

“However, Jian Wushuang shook his head after listening to Fire Fairy. “The first option is no different from acting like a defeated dog. As for the second option to join Thunder Sound Sect... There’s isn’t such a need there either.”

“Wushuang...” Fire Fairy was slightly surprised.

“Shuang.” Zhuo Yunfeng couldn’t help but look at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and said, “It’s just Xiang Yi, he still can’t force me to flee. There’s no need for Thunder Sound Sect’s protection either. If he wants to kill me, he can just come for me.”

“This...” Everyone in the hall was puzzled.

“Wushuang, this concerns your life. You shouldn’t joke about it. Moreover, Xiang Yi is a true Second Grade Divine Demon and is a lot stronger than the Third Grade Divine Demon you fought previously.” Fire Fairy tried to convince Jian Wushuang.

“I understand. However, I know what I’m doing. If I really am not a match for Xiang Yi, it won’t be too late to join Thunder Sound Sect then,” Jian Wushuang commented casually.

“But...” Fire Fairy wanted to say something but gave up after thinking about it. “Since you are so confident, I won’t try to convince you otherwise.”

“Family Head!”

The Elder from Lin Mansion entered again and reported, “We have news on the Xiang Family. Xiang Yi and a few others from Golden Cauldron Sect are heading our way under the leadership of Xiang Zong.”

“So soon?” Lin Tiefeng was astounded. “He just arrived in Xiang Mansion today and he’s already heading for our Lin Mansion?”

He gnashed his teeth before continuing, “Relay my orders. Inform all our Lin Mansion experts to get ready for battle.”

“Yes.” That Lin Mansion Elder sent down the message swiftly.

“Nephew Wushuang, this incident started because of Lin Mansion. Our Lin Mansion won’t leave you aside. We will definitely stand with you,” said Lin Tiefeng.

“Thank you, Uncle Lin.” Jian Wushuang smiled with gratitude. However, he wasn’t too concerned.

Those that were coming for him were just experts at the Chaotic Divine Demon Realm. Jian Wushuang wouldn’t care even if he did not have help from the Lin Mansion.

In the Lin Mansion, everyone looked extremely solemn.

Only the party involved, Jian Wushuang, appeared to be casual and at ease. He sat on the chair, closed his eyes to rest, and didn’t seem to be panicking at all.

Seeing this, the experts in Lin Mansion could only whisper in secret.

Half a day later.

“They are here!”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes abruptly and looked out to the far away sky. Through his soul power, he sensed the arrival of several powerful auras.

Other experts in Lin Mansion sensed them soon after.

“Jian Wushuang, come out and die!”

An angry roar reverberated through the sky above Lin Mansion. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The voice was deafening and everyone within the Lin Mansion could hear the angry roar clearly.

“Who are you? How dare you try to provoke young master Wushuang?”

“Young master Wushuang is someone who can even easily kill Chaotic Divine Demons! Even our Family Head treats him with the utmost respect. Which unruly and ignorant fool dares to make young master Wushuang come out and die?”

“Quick! Let’s go take a look.”

Numerous experts and disciples of Lin Mansion were alarmed. Many of them moved and appeared in the sky.

These experts and disciples from Lin Mansion were all glowering at the few people who had gathered before the Lin Mansion’s main doors.

Since the huge battle three months ago, Jian Wushuang’s standing in Lin Mansion had reached an unbelievable level.

Almost all the disciples and even experts of the Lin Mansion had the utmost fear and respect for Jian Wushuang.

And now, hearing others shamelessly ask Jian Wushuang to come out and die, these disciples of Lin Mansion were naturally enraged.
