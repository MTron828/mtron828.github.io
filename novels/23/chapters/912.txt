When the Selection Ceremony arrived, Jian Wushang finished his meditation.

During the three years of meditation, his two Original Bodies possessed a good command of Nine-province Seal and the Second Move of Ninth-heaven Sword Formation.

Having entered the Initial Realm of the Second Move of Ninth-heaven Sword Formation, Jian Wushuang easily wielded it with outrageous proficiency.

As for the Nine-province Seal in Mountain River Map, it released great power in collaboration with the Map. This secret skill was much more domineering than what Jian Wushuang had seen previously.

Jian Wushuang only managed to crack the First Move, while he still unable to wield it.

He received no chance of driving Mountain River Map since it drained too much Spiritual Power.

It was early in the morning.

Jian Wushuang sat on a chair in the meeting hall with three other figures.

Two of them were his two close friends, Wang Yuan and Yang Zaixuan.

Yang Zaixuan stayed at Cercis Island before, but rushed to the royal palace to assist Jian Wushuang.

At the first sight of Yang Zaixuan, King of Venomous Worms could not help but exclaim, “Amazing aura of emperor! What a high-grade bloodline!”

With the help of Emperor Xiao, Yang Zaixuan once received a bloodline inheritance, no wonder he possessed a high-grade bloodline.

He made great progress these last few years and ranked the top of the Eternal Realm. If he completely erupted the bloodline at any cost, he may have the strength to combat a Dao Master.

A grey-robed elder also sat among them quietly.

This weathered elder closed his eyes slightly, blinked twice, and repeated. He looked like a piece of wood.

He was Alchemy Master Huo Qiong, the master of Wang Yuan, and the acknowledged first alchemist in the Ancient World.

This Alchemy Master served as the introducer of Jian Wushuang at the Selection Ceremony.

The four figures waited for dawn without words.

Although they didn’t wait long.

From the horizon, the sun rose, and the first rosy sunlight shined upon the ancient royal palace.

The entire royal palace awakened.

Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat! Rat-a-tat!

One by one, the bells tolled in a deep and resonant voice.

The sound reverberated through the royal palace.

In the meeting hall, the four figures opened their eyes and looked at the window.

“Finally… Has it arrived?”

Jia Wushuang stood up slowly.?A smile softened his cold face as he saw the rosy sunlight.

“Let’s go.”

Dan Zun also stood up.

Afterwards, they set off for the ceremony venue.

At the same time, in other places of the royal palace, experts from various forces of the Eternal World also set off.

A great many of experts rushed to the drill ground at the center of the royal palace like buzzing wasps.

When Jian Wushuang and other three figures arrived, lots of people eagerly awaited there.

“So many people!” Jian Wushuang said, scanning the crowd on the drill ground. There were numerous figures entering from the the void nearby.

“There are millions of people.” Wang Yuan was stunned by the scene.

Crowds of people gathered around the grill ground. Everyone who attended the Selection Ceremony was capable, and many of them were preeminent.

Fortunately, the Royal Guard of Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land sent all the members. They maintained order with Blood Eagle Guard. Some experts at the level of Dao Master also kept an bird’s eye view of the venue. As a result, the drill ground was safe for all.

“Blood Mountain, I gave you a referral two days ago. As you requested, I used the name ‘Jian Wushuang’,” Alchemy Master said.

“Thank you, Alchemy Master.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

Becasue he wanted to marry Leng Rushuang fair and square, he had to use his real name.

Although it would cause a lot of trouble, he would face them sooner or later.

“Since Xia Clan was so powerful, they must have received the list of the competitors. They surely were astonished to see my name on the list.” Jian Wushuang said, laughing in his mind.

He killed Xia Yan in person, the Second Master of Xia Clan.

People in Xia Clan searched for him these years, but found nothing.

This time, if they knew he dared to participate in this Selection Ceremony and to compete with Xia Mang, they would definitely do far worse than slander his name.

A figure suddenly appeared beside Jian Wushuang.

“Hi, First Senior Brother.” Jian Wushuang greeted him with a wave.

His First Senior Brother, Xue Lingtian.

“Have a gander at your wedding gift, my junior brother.” Xue Lingtian said, offering him an Interspatial Ring.

“Is this?” Jian Wushuang smiled and took the ring.

He saw the mysterious smile on Xue Lingtian’s face, which aroused his curiosity.

“What will the wedding gift would be?” Jian Wushuang said, peeking inside Interspatial Ring with curiosity and anticipation.

When he saw clear what the wedding gift truly was, he and King of Venomous Worms stomped their feet vehemently.

“How is this possible!” Jian Wushuang said in a demanding voice, staring at the ring in shock.

“Monster! Your master is a true monster, Jian Wushuang!” King of Venomous Worms roared. “How did he obtain these? He refined them on his own? Impossible! That’s impossible!”

“Monster!”

“Your master is a monster!”

A series of roars from King of Venomous Worms rang out in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

Jia Wushuang felt the same as King of Venomous Worms.

Horrible!

He even shivered with fear.

He was totally taken aback by the weeding gift his master gave him.

And believed whoever saw it would be taken aback as well.

After all, this wedding gift was too… It was far too shocking and stunning!
