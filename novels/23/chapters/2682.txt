Chapter 2683: A Few Tens To A Hundred Billion

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“It’s not difficult to make them willingly fight for the Sword Alliance but we’ll need to support them with lots of resources. In another word, we’ve to give them the benefits they want,” said Long Shan.

Jian Wushuang of course knew that people work for the sake of benefits!

Experts who joined the Dragon Divine Gang, Purple Beast Alliance, Corpse Palace, and even the many powerful forces in the Danyang Continent were after benefits offered. They would leave once nothing grabbed their interest.

However, those sects and clans were different.

They had nurtured their experts for generations, hence their disciples and followers had a strong sense of belonging. They would fight for their sects and clans even when there was nothing to reap to the extent they might even be willing to give up their lives for their sects and clans.

Sword Alliance must be prepared to provide them with lucrative benefits if Sword Alliance were to win the experts’ hearts.

“I’ll find a way to solve matters about resources. All you need to do is to find a way to form an Official Army as soon as possible. Don’t be afraid to recruit too many experts as long as you find someone suitable as I won’t be limiting it to only thirty people. We can even do fifty or a hundred. There are two hundred million Primordial Stones in this Interspatial Ring. Use it for now and come look for me when you run out of Primordial Stones.” Jian Wushuang handed an Interspatial Ring to Long Shan.

Jian Wushuang had heaps of Primordial Stones on hand but could not possibly give all of them at once to Long Shan.

Jian Wushuang had not fully trusted Long Shan after all.

“Yes.” Long Shan took the Interspatial Ring with his eyes sparkling in excitement.

“Okay, all of you may go.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

The four people immediately bowed and left.

Jian Wushuang was still sitting alone in the hall.

Jian Wushuang murmured, “I have never really built a sect before, hence I didn’t have any idea about these training resources. However, I now know how important they are. I have a lot of resources now from receiving one billion Primordial Stones at one go when I sold ten catties of Royal Blood Gems to the Star Picking Pavilion. I’m afraid I’ll need a lot more if I were to form a decent-sized Official Army that’s willing to fight for me.”

“It seems that I’ll have to find Yin Su’er.”

Jian Wushuang immediately left for the Sacred Palace after having made a decision.

He first went for Palace Keeper Si Zhen instead of directly looking for Yin Su’er.

In the palace...

“Jian Yi, what brought you here?” Palace Keeper Si Zhen asked while standing in front of Jian Wushuang.

He once told Jian Wushuang to ask help from the two Sacred Palace Elders if he needed anything and for Jian Wushuang to see him only meant that Jian Wushuang must have some important matters to discuss.

“I need a large batch of Primordial Stones,” replied Jian Wushuang.

“How much do you need?” Palace Keeper Si Zhen was indifferent.

Jian Wushuang asked for Divine Elixir Pills when he first arrived at the Sacred Palace which Yin Su’er tried her best and managed to get him 800 pieces.

Palace Keeper was not surprised if Jian Wushuang would do the same for Primordial Stones if that was how Jian Wushuang asked for Divine Elixir Pills.

“Not many, I’d like to have just a few tens and up to a hundred billion of them,” replied Jian Wushuang casually.

“What did you say?” Palace Keeper Si Zhen stared wide-eyed at Jian Wushuang. “You think a few tens or a hundred billion Primordial Stones isn’t a lot? Jian Yi, you do ask brazenly, don’t you?”

There was an obvious trace of anger in Palace Keeper Si Zhen’s tone.

What a joke! Although the Primordial Stone was far less rare and precious than Divine Elixir Pills, it was used in all kinds of goods exchanges and transactions in the Danyang Holy Domain. Scorpion King was killed because of the Blood Gems he managed to retrieve from the Blood Gem Mineral Vein which only totaled up to 37,000,000,000 Primordial Stones.

It was a huge amount of wealth even for Yin Su’er and managed to slightly lift her pressure due to that batch of Primordial Stones she got from those Blood Gems. Yin Su’er might not refuse if Palace Keeper Si Zhen asked her for 100,000,000 to 200,000,000 Primordial Stones or even 2,000,000,000 to 3,000,000,000 Primordial Stones.

However, Jian Wushuang was asking for up to 100,000,000,000 Primordial Stones! What was with his request?

“Jian Yi, the Fort Master respects you as someone invited by the old Fort Master and ordered us to fulfill your request as much as possible to help you improve your strength, but your request is too much! Why will a Peak Earth Ultimate God like you need a few tens or even a hundred billion Primordial Stones?” Palace Keeper Si Zhen stared at Jian Wushuang in disbelief.

“I want these Primordial Stones because I need a lot of resources to build up a force and expand it,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Build up a force?” Palace Keeper Si Zhen’s expression sank before he continued, “You should be aware of the situation the Fort Master is facing now as it is. Do you think the Fort Master can get a few tens and up to a hundred billion Primordial Stones? I’m afraid she’ll have to pay a hefty price for it even if she can.”

“I know, so this time I won’t be asking without offering an exchange. I’ll give you something in exchange. No, it should be that I’m giving you something in hopes you can help me find a way to liquidate this thing. You’ll be getting either Divine Elixir Pills or Primordial Stones after disposing of this thing,” said Jian Wushuang.

“What is it?” Palace Keeper Si Zhen asked.

Jian Wushuang did not intend to continue hiding it as he flipped his hand and took out a blood-colored Blood Gem the size of a baby’s fist. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The blood-colored Blood Gem was the second Royal Blood Gem in Jian Wushung’s hands!

The first Royal Blood Gem was only the size of a thumb and weighed ten catties. The second one was the size of a baby’s fist and weighed more than two hundred catties!

“This is...”

Palace Keeper Si Zhen stared wide-eyed at the blood-colored Blood Gem. “Royal Blood Gem. This is the Royal Blood Gem!”

“Yes, it’s the Royal Blood Gem and I think this one weighs around two hundred thirty catties. However, I don’t know how much it’s worth?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Two hundred thirty catties of Royal Blood Gem?” Palace Keeper Si Zhen drew in a sharp breath of cold air. He was excited while looking intently at the Royal Blood Gem.

He was also obviously coveting the Royal Blood Gem caused by the green-eyed monster in him.

Jian Wushuang also noticed the greed in Palace Keeper Si Zhen’s eyes but was not worried that Palace Keeper Si Zhen would make a move.

Jian Wushuang was trying to honor the agreement with Crimson Stone Saint to help Yin Su’er after all. He would be much at ease if Palace Keeper Si Zhen tried to rob the Royal Blood Gem from him as he could just leave and no longer paid any attention to the Crimson Stone Fort’s affairs along with Yin Su’er’s survival in that case.

Palace Keeper Si Zhen would of course not be doing something so foolish.

“Jian Yi, how come you have such a big and heavy piece of Royal Blood Gem? Is this from the Blood Gem Mineral Vein?” Palace Keeper Si Zhen exclaimed in a low voice.

“I obtained this by luck and it has nothing to do with the mineral vein.” Jian Wushuang shook his head. He would of course not admit that the Royal Blood Gem was obtained from that mineral vein.
