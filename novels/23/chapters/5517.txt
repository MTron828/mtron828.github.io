Chapter 5516 ¬†Fimisa

Because his true body was not in the Sea of the Universe but at the outer hall guarded by the Xuanwu Temple.

"Little b*stard, I only want 7 Envoys of All Things, not 700. Are you giving them to me or not? If you don't, I'll smash your head!" Zhen Ling glared with small eyes, threatening Xuan Yi, the Temple Master.

He was currently preparing for matters in the territorial boundaries. The roots of trouble were left behind in the Forest of Eternal Secrets, and now a group of strong individuals was needed to resolve it.

While Wu Zuo, in the Heavenly Realm, cooperated with Jian Wushuang to lure Fuego, he was not idle either.

He aimed to gather a group of Envoys of All Things to completely eradicate the Forest of Eternal Secrets.

Xuan Yi, the Temple Master, kept smiling all along but refused to yield, not giving anything.

"Lord Zhen Ling, the Original Universe can't withstand the True Master for much longer. These Envoys of All Things cannot be touched. We've already given one, and these days, we need to expedite the refinement. There's simply nothing extra!" In the Ten Great Puppet Worlds, except for the first world, the other nine worlds were all refining Envoys of All Things.

Day and night without rest... Ever since the Qishen Temple reawakened, especially within this Original Universe, Xuan Yi, the Temple Master, didn't dare to slack off for a moment, continuously refining Envoys of All Things.

Zhen Ling couldn't leave Qishen Temple. If something unexpected happened outside, they would have to rely on these Envoys of All Things.

Among the heirs, the Universe Master had not appeared, and the Azure Dragon Temple Master was uncooperative, putting all the pressure on him.

Zhen Ling gritted his teeth, stood up directly from his seat, "How about this, you give me seven envoys of All Things, and I'll give you the Beiwang Tower. How's that?"

"Lord, don't try to trick me. The entire Qishen Temple knows now. Heir Jian Wushuang has broken through more than 40 levels. The Beiwang Tower is not enough to compensate for it. As for the Origin Source of All Things, it's not something I can decide!" Although Xuan Yi, the Temple Master, was not in the Four Great Secret Realms, he still had many informants. Many things, he knew almost instantly.

Zhen Ling slapped his head, snorted coldly, and turned around, walking away.

Not enough manpower!

His true body had to stay to deal with Fuego; he couldn't easily move.

Except for the Azure Dragon, the other Four Great Temples couldn't break free.

The critical moment arrived as Azure Dragon had been dispatched to the Human Realm Secret Realm to secretly observe Hu Qing.

Upon his return to the Origin Source Sea, he sensed a looming danger emanating from the Heavenly Realm.

Although he couldn't grasp the specific aura, deduction was within his capabilities.

"It's related to Fuego!" Zhen Ling immediately stood up, initiating constant surveillance of all movements in the Heavenly Realm.

Inside the Elder Palace.

Cracks started to appear on the giant egg lurking within the Origin Source of All Things.

Life within the giant egg had long developed consciousness.

Naturally, it also witnessed Jian Wushuang.

"The Power of Life!!!"

"Frolasa, you deceived me! How can there be a formidable wielder of Life power in this place?" The consciousness within the giant egg struggled.

Its horror surpassed that of Jian Wushuang upon seeing it.

Shen Ling!

The root cause of calamity within the Qishen Temple.

He was suppressed in the First Prison.

"Hehe, Fimisa, you've been fooled. That person's strength is quite ordinary. His name is Jian Wushuang, just a Dao Lord. Don't act rashly; I'll send Fuego to capture him."

Shen Ling was quite frustrated.

Fimisa was his foundation.

As long as it could successfully incubate, it would become a Universe Master.

Although Fuego had revived, his strength could only be maintained at the lowest level of a Universe Master, making it difficult for him to be effective.

To escape from the Qishen Temple, he still needed the assistance of Fimisa.

When the Three Kings Court was annihilated, Fuego was suppressed, and he was taken away by the master of All Things, one of the three major Divine Masters.

However, he had left a contingency plan. Originally meant to descend into another timeline's giant egg, he guided it into the Moro Space instead.

Entering the Origin Source of the master of All Things.

Initially, he constantly deceived the master of All Things, urging it to seize control of Fimisa's body, allowing him an opportunity to break free.

But before that day arrived, the Moro Space fell into desolation.

In that desolation, he uncovered the truth.

One could only say that the Moro Space was extremely unlucky.

In order to survive, he willingly entered the Qishen Temple.

Following Qishen Temple, he left that timeline.

Now, he wants to leave, but he can't. Zhen Ling in charge is not swayed by his enticements.

He has been constantly thinking of ways to eliminate him.

He can only secretly plan to revive Fuego.

Fuego was born much earlier than him and is also a top powerhouse among the Universe Masters. He alone can suppress the Three True Kings.

However, the strength after revival is still somewhat lacking.

Fortunately, at this time, Jian Wushuang appeared.

Jian Wushuang possesses the power of All Things within him, a unique power belonging to them. Not only can it restore Fuego's strength, but it can also bring out Fumisa.

Now, the most important thing is to capture Jian Wushuang.

Once Jian Wushuang is captured, everything will succeed.

However, since Jian Wushuang arrived in the Heavenly Realm, he has been hiding in the Elder Palace and hasn't come out at all.

They have no way because the Elder Palace has Divine General Moyin and the highest-level teleportation array. Bai Yi, the Lord of Bai Palace, can arrive at the first moment.

In addition to Wu Zuo and others.

Suddenly, several supreme-peak powerhouses, and Fuego can't handle it.

Fuego's current strength was approximately at the level of the 80th floor of the Beiwang Tower, capable of suppressing Divine General Moyin and others, even achieving a kill.

However, it required time!

Before others could make the kill, the Zhen Ling had already descended. Visjt nùíêvelbin(.)cùíêm for new updates

At that moment, Fuego's self-preservation was uncertain!

The pressure from Zhen Ling was immense, and the pressure from the Shen Ling was also substantial.

Within the Qishen Temple, the Ultimate Emperor had already created the cosmic secret technique, and the Spatial Origin Source had reached the universe realm.

Perhaps, at any moment, he would ascend to become the Universe Master.

Fuego and the hidden Fumisa within the Origin Source of All Things were enormous threats, continuously exerting significant pressure on the Zhen Ling.

This couldn't be prolonged.

No one could afford to procrastinate.

Gritting his teeth, Shen Ling endured, but if Jian Wushuang didn't appear soon, he would let Fuego break in, even at the cost of his life, just to bring Jian Wushuang out.

"Don't act recklessly for now. Even if that Zhen Ling finds you, it won't harm you as long as Fuego regains his peak strength. Everything can be resolved!"

However, Fimisa found it hard to believe the other's words. After all, he had been deceived into descending into the Moro Temporal Space, and what was the result?

After so many years of incubation, he didn't even have the ability to crack open his egg. If it weren't for the nourishment from the origin of all things, he would have starved to death long ago.

It was probably the biggest joke among their giant god clan.

Shen Ling was born, dead in the womb.

The Giant God clan, a divine race in the starry sky, born as the Universe Master, unmatched.

The descent of a giant egg represented the fall of a spacetime.

How powerful.

Yet, the result was that the spirits of three consecutive Giant Gods fell into the Moro Temporal Space, a colossal disgrace.

While consoling Fimisa, the deity also informed Fuego to infiltrate the Heavenly Realm.

This time, he wanted to play in the dark.

At the same time, he was dispatching members of the Shadow Sect in the Heavenly Realm.
