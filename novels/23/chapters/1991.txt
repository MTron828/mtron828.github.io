Chapter 1992: The Early Bird Catches The Worm

Big trouble!

Emperor God Golden Lion knew how scary Sword Emperor was.

He could offend anyone but he happened to offend Sword Emperor and he just hit it directly in vain.

Emperor God Golden Lion felt bitter but mostly, he was glad. He was glad that Sword Emperor held back and didn’t kill him directly.

Otherwise…

“Golden Lion, I’m asking you. Are you willing to let him off the hook?” Jian Wushuang asked with a deep voice and there was chilliness in his eyes.

In the beginning, he was considered gentle. Who knew Emperor God Golden Lion would behave so recklessly and blindly? Jian Wushuang, of course, wouldn’t treat him politely anymore.

“Yes, yes,” Emperor God Golden Lion didn’t dare to complain further.

“Hurry up and get lost!” Jian Wushuang roared.

Emperor God Golden Lion immediately left and didn’t delay any further.

“Thank you for the help, Sword Emperor,” the owner of Sky Sword Mountain immediately bowed to Jian Wushuang.

“No big deal. You and I are friends,” Jian Wushuang waved casually, “Oh yeah. You came to Jiu Jue Sword Mansion for the nine sword steles, right?”

“Yes,” the owner of Sky Sword Mountain nodded, “I originally wanted to try my luck. Who knew there was a test at every sword stele and not just anyone could get it? I was in Jiu Jue Sword Mansion for a few days but I didn’t get any sword stele. I met this Golden Lion and nearly lost my life.”

“There’s a test at every sword stele?” Jian Wushuang was surprised but it wasn’t unexpected. “Tian Jian, as you have been here in Jiu Jue Sword Mansion for quite some time, you should have come across a few sword steles, right?”

“Yeah. I found three sword steles in the past few days. But it is a pity that I didn’t get any one of them,” the owner of Sky Sword Mountain smiled bitterly.

“Can you bring me to the three sword steles then?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course,” the owner of Sky Sword Mountain naturally wouldn’t refuse.

Under the lead of the owner of Sky Sword Mountain, Jian Wushuang immediately went to where the three sword steles were located.

Jian Wushuang arrived at the first sword stele very quickly.

“That is the sword stele?”

Jian Wushuang looked at a green stele towering in the middle of the barren field. The green stele was huge and it was made of unique green crystals.

Even though Jian Wushuang was experienced, he couldn’t tell what the green crystal was.

The green crystal gave out an ancient aura and there was a spiralling tunnel underneath. One could enter the sword stele through the tunnel to sit for the test.

At the very moment, there were three cultivators by the side of the green sword stele.

The three cultivators were an Emperor God and two Sir Gods. When they saw Jian Wushuang’s arrival, their eyes dilated in shock.

“Greetings, Sword Emperor!”

“Greetings, Sword Emperor!”

The three of them bowed politely simultaneously.

“Come on,” Jian Wushuang waved, “There’s someone in the sword stele now?”

“Yes,” the Emperor God replied, “Master Wu just went in not too long ago.”

“Master Wu?” Jian Wushuang was taken by surprise.

In Eternal Chaotic World, before Jian Wushuang rose, before Jian Yi and Lord Sound Spirit and the others appeared, there was only a total of fifteen Great Emperors. Thirteen of them were from Sanctuary Alliance and there were two out of Sanctuary Alliance. It was widely known by the public.

In the great Eternal Chaotic World, it was normal that there would be one or two Great Emperors that people didn’t know.

For instance, Master Wu wasn’t famous back then until the ancient battlefield appeared. He started wandering on the ancient battlefield and gained fame in the public.

He was extremely powerful and was listed at the eighth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list!

“Master Wu is good with a sword too. It is very normal that he came to wander in Jiu Jue Sword Mansion,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly.

“Sword Emperor, only one person is permitted to enter to sit for the test in the sword stele at one time. As Master Wu is sitting for the test in the sword stele, we can only wait outside,” the owner of Sky Sword Mountain explained.

“Alright then,” Jian Wushuang smiled but wasn’t bothered much.

The time flew past. In the blink of an eye, half a day had passed.

There was finally movement in the huge sword stele. The sword stele quivered slightly and was suddenly diminished at a terrifyingly fast speed.

Looking at the sight, Jian Wushuang and the others immediately understood that Master Wu had definitely passed the test. So, the sword stele belonged to him.

Jian Wushuang let out a sigh but he couldn’t do anything about it either.

Master Wu had already taken the sword stele as he had arrived first. It was Master Wu’s ability to pass through the test and obtain the sword stele. Hence, Jian Wushuang couldn’t do anything about it.

As for the owner of Sky Sword Mountain, Sir God Mo Yu and the rest could only be envious.

The tall sword stele vanished into thin air and it was replaced by a brawny man who was three meters tall.

The tall man carried a broad and heavy sword on his back. He himself was just like a mountain and the fierce aura given out by the “mountain” not only made one feel pressured, but also eerie.

The tall, brawny man was Master Wu.

Jian Wushuang stood there with his hands on his back when he looked at Master Wu.

Master Wu felt Jian Wushuang gaze and he looked back. Both of their eyes met and the void instantly froze.

The owner of Sky Sword Mountain, Sir God Mo Yu and the others around them gulped and held their breaths.

Master Wu was a Great Emperor.

As for Jian Wushuang, he was also a superb existence. He had obviously already broken through. His fighting power shouldn’t be second to Great Emperor’s either.

In front of the two superb existence, they were, of course, nervous.

At the same time, they were surprised, “Would the two of them fight here?”

Judging from their behavior, they did look like they were going to fight.

But in the end…

“Let’s go.”

Jian Wushuang suddenly turned and told the owner of Sky Sword Mountain.

The owner of Sky Sword Mountain didn’t hesitate and immediately turned to leave.

Master Wu reined in his gaze and left as well.

There were only the three cultivators, who were waiting outside the sword stele earlier, left standing at the original spot.

Then, the three cultivators had yet to calm down.

“I though Sword Emperor would fight with Master Wu over the sword stele, but it didn’t seem like it just now.”

“Humph, Master Wu is a true Great Emperor, in eighth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. But Sword Emperor, although he broke through, I reckon his true power has barely passed the threshold of a Great Emperor’s. His sword servant isn’t with him either. What does he have to take things away from Master Wu?”

“Mm, that’s true. Sword Emperor wouldn’t ask for a snub when he knew that he wasn’t his match.”

The three of them chatted casually.
