Chapter 2791: Sneak Attack

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang’s second reincarnation sword formation was too powerful, and it was a sword formation that could be controlled by consciousness. In a head-on collision, it did not need to withstand the rebounding force of the impact, but the East God did, and the force was surprisingly strong.

Although the East God’s divine body was strong and its protective ability was not weak, it could not completely offset the impact.

Therefore, every head-on collision, his divine body would suffer a certain degree of impact. In just a dozen impacts, the East God’s divine body had already suffered a certain degree of damage, but the East God did not pay any attention to it. He was like a madman, he continued to collide head-on with the reincarnation sword formation.

“The east god clearly knows that he can’t fight head-on with my reincarnation sword formation, but he still wants to fight head-on? As a peak divine master and the ruler of a top force, how could he be so stupid?”Jian wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.

Just as he was puzzled... Buzz! !

An invisible force directly attacked Jian wushuang without any warning.

Jian wushuang did not react at all, but the Purple Emperor Bell in his body, which had been refined by him, suddenly burst out with powerful power.

A huge purple barrier formed a purple bell that completely covered Jian wushuang.

The invisible power acted on the purple bell at the first moment. Although the power eventually passed through the Purple Bell, the power had been weakened by more than half.

“It’s a Soul Attack!”Jian wushuang was startled and his pupils shrank.

After being greatly weakened by the Purple Bell, the soul attack directly entered Jian Wushuang’s body and ferociously attacked the real soul in his sea of consciousness.

However, around Jian Wushuang’s real soul, a towering and sturdy tower stood there. It was the exquisite pagoda.

The Exquisite Pagoda was purely a soul defense secret skill, which had an amazing ability to defend against the soul. After being weakened by the Purple Emperor Bell, the soul attack hit the Exquisite Pagoda, which shook it crazily, but it did not destroy the exquisite pagoda.

This sudden and extremely powerful soul attack was easily blocked by Jian Wushuang’s double soul defense.

“Humph!”

Jian wushuang snorted and scanned the surroundings with his cold eyes. In the blink of an eye, he had focused his eyes on a black-clothed woman.

The black-clothed woman had a unique aura. Although she was only a junior great divine master, the soul power around her was extremely strong. In terms of soul power, she was extremely strong among senior great divine masters, therefore, she could use her soul attack to fight against ordinary senior great divine masters. She even had a high chance of winning.

Just now, the black-clothed woman suddenly used her soul attack to sneak attack Jian wushuang.

Now that she failed to hit him and Jian Wushuang looked at her again, a trace of panic flashed in the black-clothed woman’s eyes.

Her body swayed, and the black-clothed woman wanted to escape.

“You want to escape?”

Jian wushuang’s eyes were cold, and a strong killing intent rose from his body. He slowly raised his left palm and pointed in the direction of the black-clothed woman.

He immediately used the heaven-pointing skill.

Although the black-clothed woman was good at soul attacks and her soul techniques were very impressive, she was only a novice great divine master and had no knowledge of the space-time rules. Naturally, she could not block Jian Wushuang’s move.

In an instant, her fleeing figure froze in the void.

Jian wushuang’s figure flashed past the black-clothed woman easily. The cold sword light had already killed the black-clothed woman.

“Sneak Attack Me?”Jian wushuang’s voice was extremely cold.

In the void not far away, the East God, who had been madly colliding with the giant black wood formed by the Samsara Sword Formation, saw this and his expression could not help but change.

“Damn it, he actually blocked it?”The East God did not dare to do so.

Jian wushuang had also realized that.

“He knew that his divine power was no match for me, so he risked his divine body to fight me head-on. He thought that the east god was stupid, but now it seems that... the head-on fight was just a pretense. His real goal was to attract my attention and create a perfect opportunity for the woman to kill me directly with a soul attack.”Jian Wushuang’s face was a little gloomy.

He was right. That was the plan of the East God.

The East God knew that he might not be able to kill Jian wushuang, so he had a backup plan.

In his opinion, Jian Wushuang’s rise was too fast, and his realm was rising too fast. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

His realm was rising so fast, but in terms of the soul, it was probably not as fast.

The East God had guessed that Jian Wushuang’s soul might be his weakness, so he had specially arranged this move. He had also told the black-clothed woman in advance.

However, he had not expected that Jian Wushuang’s soul defense skill would be so amazing. The black-clothed woman’s soul attack was so sudden that it was difficult for a senior divine master to block it, but Jian Wushuang had blocked it.

Now that the black-clothed woman had been killed by Jian wushuang, his plan had failed. It was obviously not rational to continue fighting with Jian Wushuang’s reincarnation sword formation. Therefore, he was ready to retreat.

However, at this time, Jian Wushuang’s eyes suddenly focused.

“East God, take my move too!”

Jian Wushuang’s cold voice echoed in the sky.

His figure flashed, and under the effect of the space-time rule power, he was extremely fast. In the blink of an eye, he appeared in the void in front of East God.

Then he pointed out with one hand.

“This move...”East God’s face changed greatly.

Whether it was the face-to-face confrontation between the Sword Union and the Divine Demon sect many years ago, or the collision between Jian Wushuang and the Blood Thunder King and the Heaven Void Palace, he had seen Jian wushuang use this move many times.

He was well aware of how terrifying this move was.

It could be said that it was largely because of this move that Jian Wushuang was able to play a key role in the two wars and slaughter numerous great divine masters without restraint.

This move could freeze time and space for a short period of time.

It was because he knew that the moment he saw Jian wushuang perform this move, the East God subconsciously wanted to dodge.

However, he had underestimated the power of the heaven-designated skill.

Before Jian Wushuang had used the seven-star secret skill, he had been able to defeat an advanced great divine master. Only an expert like Su Dao, who had a profound understanding of space-time rules, would be slightly affected.

However, now that Jian Wushuang had used the seven-star secret skill, his divine power was extremely powerful even among peak great divine masters. If he used this move again... even a peak great divine master would not be able to withstand it!
