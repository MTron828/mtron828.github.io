Chapter 451: Battling a Lord

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang did not answer the lord’s question, but just stared at him coldly.

“I’ve been in this mansion for quite a while and haven’t gotten my opportunity for treasure yet, but here you are with the greatest luck around!” Blackhill Lord smiled cruelly. “Boy, your life has a lot of value in our camp.

“So, it will be a rewarding exploration as long as I kill you.”

The lord held a long black spear in his hand as he spoke, and its surging power revealed its nature as a first-grade magic weapon.

Filled with killing desire, Blackhill Lord moved.

“Swish!”

The spear pierced through the void and approached Jian Wushuang like a black ghost. Swirling, it targeted Jian Wushuang’s throat like a snake targeting its prey.

It was a fast strike, much faster than an expert in the Saint Realm could make.

“Is this a strike from a lord?”

Watching the spear coming at him, Jian Wushuang stayed calm and even admired the lord in his heart.

“Lords are indeed more powerful than those in the Saint Realm. Even an ordinary lord can surpass an expert at the Heaven-defying Level, whether in speed, power, or bodily strength.

“I reckon that no experts at the Heaven-defying Level can withstand this strike.” Jian Wushuang became lost in thought.

“Is he too terrified to move?” The overbearing Blackhill Lord sneered when seeing Jian Wushuang frozen in place. He thought that it was due to fear.

When the spear was nearly touching his throat, Jian Wushuang finally reached out his hand to make a fist and threw it at the spear with all his power behind it.

“Boom!”

The two terrifying force collided together, shaking the mansion. Jian Wushuang was thrown back by the force like a flying shell and smashed into the walls.

As the walls cracked, broken pieces continually fell.

“Is he dead?”

Blackhill Lord’s breath surged, puffing up his hair and beard. He looked toward Jian Wushuang with ruthless eyes.

To his surprise, with light footsteps, Jian Wushuang walked out from the ruins and came up to him again.

“How could this be?”?the lord though in amazement.

“An ordinary expert at the Heaven-defying Level can hardly even withstand that strike, as 90 percent of my power was behind it. He, however, was not only able to withstand it, but was not even hurt.”

When Blackhill Lord saw that Jian Wushuang was as powerful as before without even a scratch on him, he became even more shocked.

Obviously, his attack had not worked on Jian Wushuang.

As Jian Wushuang stood firmly in front of the lord, he brushed the dirt off his cloth before shooting a cold eye at him.

“As a lord, is this all you’ve got?” he sneered.

“Say it again, I dare you.” Blackhill Lord’s face turned livid.

“Hmph.” Jian Wushuang snorted and continued, “Don’t talk as if you can kill me. Nevertheless, I’d love to see how you will try it.

“You are courting death!”

The lord was enraged. A tremendous aura swept out from his body, and at the same time, he approached Jian Wushuang like a ghost and launched a series of attacks with his spear.

“Chu! Chu! Chu!” Three strikes in succession.

The spear was so fast that Jian Wushuang could only see three blinding flashes of light coming to hunt him.

“Funny.”

He laughed and took out the Triple-kill Sword. He twisted his wrist and simply brandished the sword with all his Spiritual Power, physical strength, and the power of his four Origin Marks.

It might have been a simple strike, but the lord felt the formidable force behind it. The force roared at him, smashed his attacks, and overwhelmed his body with its remaining power.

Blackhill Lord let out a suppressed sound, with his face pale and blood streaming from the corner of his mouth, and he kept falling back.

“How could this happen?”

He raised his head and glared at Jian Wushuang in horror.

“How could he overpower me as just a boy in the Saint Realm?”

Under that gaze, Jian Wushuang burst out an immense Sword Essence, and behind him emerged two Sword Soul Phantoms over 100 feet high, which increased his power.

“Sword Soul Phantoms?”?The lord’s mouth twitched.?“So, he overpowered me without using his Sword Soul?”

“You are just a novice lord in the Three-cloud Realm. How dare you claim that you can kill me!” Jian Wushuang’s voice resounded in the mansion and rocked the lord’s heart. “Now, let’s see who will be the one that is killed!”

“Damn!” Blackhill Lord’s appearance looked grave.

He knew that he could not beat Jian Wushuang, now or before, with or without the Double First-grade Sword Soul’s presence.

“But how can he be so powerful in only the Saint Realm?”?The lord was muddled, but he had no time to solve his confusion. He had to find a way to survive.

Right then, a roar was heard from far away.

“What’s that?”

Jian Wushuang turned back only to find a golden figure diving toward them at amazing speed. The figure did not give any sign of being a living thing and it turned out to be a Puppet Fighter.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes became sharp.

“A Gold-armored Puppet?”?Blackhill Lord was even more frightened.

“Run! Run!”

Without thinking, the lord headed back and started running desperately.

It was clear to him that he could defeat neither Jian Wushuang nor the Gold-armored Puppet.

“You’re running nowhere!” Jian Wushuang chased after the lord immediately, his eyes filled with killing desire. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

But before he could catch up to Blackhill Lord, the Puppet Fighter caught up to him and hit him with a huge fist.

“So fast!”?Jian Wushuang was surprised by the puppet’s speed.

After all, a moment before, the Gold-armored Puppet was still far away when Jian Wushuang started chasing Blackhill Lord at his fastest speed.
