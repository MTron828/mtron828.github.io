Chapter 466: An Unexpected Accident

Translator:?Transn?Editor:?Transn

Myriad Islands Lord died.

He died with his eyes wide open and a terrified expression on his face.

The lords of the two camps were silent and they looked ambivalent.

They had witnessed the events unfold. They were shocked to their core.

A living man had become an ice sculpture in a moment and had shattered into pieces.

It made their hair stand on end.

They knew that Myriad Islands Lord had been poisoned. When Dragon King Arrow pierced his skin, the poison on it had entered his body. But it was too ghastly.

Myriad Islands Lord, an advanced lord, had not been able to resist it and had died a swift and strange death.

Even Jian Wushuang, who had used the poisoned arrow, sighed when he saw Myriad Islands Lord’s death.

“The Icy Heart Poison is much more frightening than I thought,” Jian Wushuang looked at the Dragon King Arrow in his hand.

There was a hint of white on the point of Dragon King Arrow, which was the Icy Heart Poison he had deliberately used.

Icy Heart Poison was the most frightening venom that Jian Wushuang had encountered.

When he had helped Leng Rushuang refine the Icy Heart Poison in her body, he had obtained 12 drops of venom. He had applied one drop to the Dragon King Arrow as a secret weapon. The result was satisfying.

While Jian Wushuang was killing Myriad Islands Lord with the Dragon King Bow and Icy Heart Poison... Nobody knew that there was a magnificent hall at the bottom of the cave mansion. Inside it, a skinny elder suddenly raised his head.

“Young master’s aura! Why does he have it?”

The skinny elder narrowed his eyes slightly as if he could see everything in the palace. Then he slowly stretched out his shriveled hand.

The Void beside the skinny elder tore unexpectedly like a piece of paper, revealing a huge wormhole. The skinny elder’s palm stretched out of the wormhole.

In the palace.

After killing Demon Soul Lord and Myriad Islands Lord, Jian Wushuang ordered the Blood Puppet to quickly pick up their Interspatial Rings. With a wave of his hand, he summoned the Blood Puppet back, and then looked around.

He found that the lords of the two camps were staring at him with complex expressions on their faces.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and began to say something, but suddenly, an unexpected accident happened.

Hum... An immaterial wave came from the Void and immediately attracted the attention of everyone present.

They were stunned by what they saw.

The Void collapsed without a sign and revealed a huge wormhole. From it, a shriveled hand stretched out and slowly grew larger. Soon, it became so immense that it covered the sky.

Space and time froze.

The lords were terrified. Simultaneously, they discovered with horror that they had lost their ability to act. Jian Wushuang also could not move at this moment.

The hand seized Jian Wushuang as easily as if he were a toy. It then retreated back into the wormhole, which shrunk and disappeared.

Calm was restored to the palace.

However, the emotions of the lords present were turbulent.

When they recovered, they realized that Jian Wushuang had disappeared with the huge hand.

The skinny elder slowly stretched his hand and pulled Jian Wushuang into the hall. Then he loosened his grip and threw him on the ground.

Jian Wushuang struggled to stand up, still feeling dizzy.

He had been in the palace, but he had been unexpectedly grasped by a giant hand and brought to this hall.

The hand had suddenly appeared from the Void, and seized him with such ease. He had been unable to struggle and resist. Even a marquis would have been unable to that.

With mounting horror, Jian Wushuang looked around. He discovered that the palace was nearly identical to the one in which they battled for the Interspatial Rings.

This included similarities in construction structure, size and even the decorations.

The only difference was that at the top of the hall, two men sat there instead of Puppet Fighters.

They were both old men.

One old man had white hair, a white beard and an ethereal appearance. The white robe he wore was covered with dust.

The other was thin. The Thunderbolt Mark between his eyebrows stood out.

“They..”

Jian Wushuang frowned and looked at the two reclining figures. He could not feel their vitality. It was as though they had been dead for many years.

Nevertheless, the thin elder suddenly opened his eyes and looked at Jian Wushuang. His eyes were cold and held ghostly flames.

“What?”

Jian Wushuang was greatly taken aback.

He still could not feel any vitality from the thin elder. He should be dead, but now...

“It was him who seized me.”

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and immediately understood the situation. He bowed to the old man and said, “Respected Elder, I am Jian Wushuang.”

The thin elder’s strength was unfathomable. He was definitely an incredible superbeing. In front of him, Jian Wushuang did not dare to use the pseudonym of “Swordsman”.

“Jian Wushang?”

The skinny elder stared at Jian Wushuang with his cold and strange eyes, but his voice was cordial. “I’m Di Jing!”

Hearing the name, Jian Wushuang’s heart skipped a beat.

Di Jing?

Great Demon, Di Jing!
