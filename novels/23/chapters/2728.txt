Chapter 2729: The First To Fall

“Alright, so we gather there.”

Jian Wushuang got the location shared by Saber Master and departed.

Although the six of them had scattered and fled in different directions, they were not too far from each other. The other five also knew the location shared by Saber Master and it was not difficult for them to head over there.

Jian Wushuang did not go immediately as he waited momentarily before setting off.

He finally arrived at the void after Saber Master, God Hong Chen, and Long Xianzi.

Among the three High-level Grand Ultimate Gods, Saber Master and Hong Chen both looked extremely relaxed while Long Xianzi was extremely pale with the corners of his clothes having traces of blood while his breath of aura was quite weak.

“Long Xianzi, you...” Jian Wushuang looked at Long Xianzi in surprise.

Five of them were targeted by a corpse puppet before everyone scattered and fled except for Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen.

The one who went after Long Xianzi was a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet.

Although the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet was powerful whereby Long Xianzi might not be able to resist its attack, Long Xianzi’s methods and life-saving abilities could have helped her. The Silver-armored Corpse Puppet should be unable to catch up with her had she not delayed and immediately run for her life, hence she should not be so miserable.

However...

“I was unlucky. I ran into two Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets while running away from the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet. The two Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets blocked my path and besieged me together with the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet. I...I almost died but managed to escape with my life-saving technique,” said Long Xianzi who was grateful for the narrow escape.

Jian Wushuang realized what had happened.

There were many corpse puppets around in the cemetery, making it possible for Long Xianzi to encounter other corpse puppets while fleeing.

Long Xianzi was a little unlucky.

“The four of us are waiting for the Devilish Wind King and Yi Shen. I don’t know if they both managed to get rid of their corpse puppets,” said Long Xianzi.

Jian Wushuang sighed.

It was true that Long Xianzi was unlucky but she was not the one with the worst luck. Devilish Wind King and Yi Shen had it worse.

The two only Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods were each targeted by a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet and the scariest Gold-armored Corpse Puppet.

The Silver-armored Corpse Puppet might be easier to handle, but the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet—even Saber Master would want to run away from it.

“It all depends on their fate. Let’s hope they come back safely,” said Jian Wushuang.

The four of them stood waiting quietly. A figure slowly drifted over in the void after nearly half an hour. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Oh, the Devilish Wind King?”

Jian Wushuang and the others were surprised to see who had arrived.

“I finally see the four of you again.” Devilish Wind King was equally miserable as though he had just gone through a disaster. His divine power breath was extremely weak and he struggled to squeeze a smile when he saw his four teammates.

“Devilish Wind King, you managed to escape from the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet?” Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen glanced at Devilish Wind King in surprise.

“Only after I used my ultimate life-saving method.” The Devilish Wind King smiled bitterly.

Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen nodded.

The Devilish Wind King was very famous in the Danyang Continent for being extremely difficult to subdue.

It was due to his powerful life-saving abilities to a large extent, hence it would take an arduous effort to kill the Devilish Wind King.

“Where is Yi Shen?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Saber Master replied, “I’ve already sent him a message but he hasn’t responded...”

“We probably don’t have to wait anymore as he could’ve died,” said Devilish Wind King.

“Died?” Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrunk.

“I received a message from Yi Shen telling me that he was on his way to escape but ended up encountering another Silver-armored Corpse Puppet blocking his path. He was then besieged by two Silver-armored Corpse Puppets at the same time with no chance of escaping,” said Devilish Wind King.

Jian Wushuang and the others fell silent after hearing the bad news.

Although Yi Shen was rather powerful, he was only a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God. It was extremely challenging to be confronted by a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet, but to face two Silver-armored Corpse Puppets at the same time only meant he had no chance of escaping.

In addition, there was no information on Yi Shen’s whereabouts which only meant he had failed to survive.

Yi Shen was the first to die among the six experts who entered the secret realm.

However, Jian Wushuang was rather perplexed after learning the news of Yi Shen’s death.

“Yi Shen could not survive because he was targeted by a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet. However, the Devilish Wind King who’s slightly weaker than Yi Shen had survived the attack from a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet?” Jian Wushuang murmured.

He knew the Devilish Wind King had powerful life-saving abilities, hence the Devilish Wind King might seem to be much stronger than Yi Shen in that aspect.

However, Jian Wushuang was still curious but would try to find out the answer later.

“Long Xianzi and Devilish Wind King—you both are seriously injured. This cemetery is way too dangerous with corpse poisons lurking all over the place and it’s getting more and more powerful. There isn’t a place for you both to recover from your injuries at the moment, so shall we carry on with the journey?” Saber Master looked at them.

“We should be alright if we don’t bump into another Gold-armored Corpse Puppet,” replied Long Xianzi.

The Devilish Wind King agreed, “Let’s go.”

The five people immediately carried on with their journey after reaching a consensus.

The cemetery was huge. They had traveled for several hours but still had not passed through the cemetery.

One of them had died while the other two were severely injured, but they were only halfway through the cemetery.

They were being extra cautious.

However, they were quite lucky after that as they indeed encountered three other corpse puppets but none could threaten them. They had not bumped into another Gold-armored Corpse Puppet, nor did they encounter any difficult hindrances along the way.

The five finally passed the cemetery two hours later.

“Phew, it’s over!”

“Finally! We passed the cemetery.”

After reaching the end of the cemetery, they noticed the corpse poison around them had slowly dissipated with no more densely packed stone coffins in front of them. The five of them then rejoiced.

“We should be safe out here away from the cemetery. Let’s stay here for a while to recover our divine power. Long Xianzi and Devilish Wind King—both of you are seriously injured, so hurry up and recuperate,” suggested Saber Master.

“Alright.” Long Xianzi immediately sat down with the Devilish Wind King and started recovering from their injuries.

Jian Wushuang, Saber Master, and Hong Chen also began to restore their divine power.

Their divine body was constantly enduring the corpse poison’s erosion and a great deal of their divine power was consumed for that purpose.

Jian Wushuang was the exception of course, but he still pretended to recover his divine power nonetheless.
