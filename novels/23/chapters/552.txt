Chapter 553: Triple Phantom Saber Move

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“He concealed it so deeply!”

The Temple Masters in the void also looked at Emperor Golden Snake in surprise.

Among the 108 Divine Emperors, Emperor Golden Snake had always been low-key and seldom fought with others. In his confrontations with Demonic Beasts, he had only used Gale Saber Principle. Therefore, the people of Monster-exterminating League, including the Divine Emperors, had thought that he was just an ordinary Divine Emperor.

No one had expected that Emperor Golden Snake had comprehended two Dao simultaneously. More importantly, his understanding of Phantom Saber Principle was more profound than they had guessed.

“Why did he keep it under wraps?” Temple Master Pure Moon frowned.

Even Temple Master Golden Mountain, who knew Emperor Golden Snake well, was surprised.

He hadn’t known that Emperor Golden Snake had comprehended Phantom Saber Principle and couldn’t understand why he had kept that fact under wraps.

Monster-exterminating League was a united organization and Emperor Golden Snake had no deadly enemies. Why then did he hide the extent of his skills?

“There must be a reason. After the duel, I will ask him.”?Temple Master Golden Mountain told himself.

On the battlefield, Jian Wushuang stared coldly at Emperor Golden Snake.

“It seems they all looked down on you.” Jian Wushuang said in a hostile tone, remembering what Emperor Fengxiao had told him.

Emperor Fengxiao had warned him that few knew Emperor Golden Snake’s real strength because he had always been low-key.

This was indeed the case.

“Once I display Phantom Saber Principle, I will have endless trouble. To avenge my son’s death, I have no choice.”?Emperor Golden Snake’s face was sullen.

Phantom Saber Principle was his last trump card and he would not have used it unless absolutely necessary.

In the Monster-exterminating League, no one, not even those close to him, knew about this.

He wasn’t planning on using it, but now he had to.

“Boy, you should be proud.” Emperor Golden Snake said in a deep voice as he stared at Jian Wushuang. “I created Triple Phantom Saber Move but I’ve never displayed it in front of others. You are the first. A death caused by it is a worthy one.”

“Triple Phantom Saber Move?” Jian Wushuang’s glare froze.

“Watch carefully.” Emperor Golden Snake was so confident of his Triple Phantom Saber Move that he pre-empted Jian Wushuang before he made his move.

Jian Wushuang’s face was grim.

Emperor Golden Snake was still holding his black scimitar. At this moment, he slashed it at will.

As the black scimitar was slashed from a distance of 30 meters, the dark sharp light had reached Jian Wushuang.

“What?” Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly darkened.

Too fast!

He was shocked by its speed.

It was as if Emperor Golden Snake had slashed the sword right in front of him, rather than at a distance of 30 meters.

The attack was so sudden that Jian Wushuang had no time to use his swordsmanship and gather power. Instead, he instinctively raised his sword.

Bang! The impact threw Jian Wushuang off but he regained his footing after a while.

“Quick reaction.” Emperor Golden Snake stared at Jian Wushuang with ice-cold eyes, “That’s just the first move. Now comes the second.”

Jian Wushuang looked grave as he stared at Emperor Golden Snake. He was on high alert.

Jian Wushuang was still recovering from his shock. The first move had been fast; indubitably, the second would be faster.

Whoosh! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Emperor Golden Snake moved like a phantom.

As Jian Wushuang saw Emperor Golden Snake move, a black light which had been less than a meter away rushed towards his head.

This strike was faster and more terrible than the first.

At such a close distance, there was no room for Jian Wushuang to use his Heart-killing Sword. He could only raise it to his chest.

Clang!

The black light struck the Heart-killing Sword. Its impact numbed Jian Wushuang’s arms, which nearly caused him to drop his sword. Jian Wushuang retreated a few steps from the force of the attack.

“How could he be so fast?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with shock.

At least he had been able to slash his sword to resist the first move. However, he had not been able to do so to meet the second move.

What about the third move?

“It’s great that you have fended off those attacks, but that won’t be enough!”

“The third move is the most powerful!”

“You must die.”

Emperor Golden Snake made this pronouncement coldly, as though he had just sentenced Jian Wushuang to death.

Jian Wushuang held his breath.

The experts outside the Restriction watched in tensed silence. They also wanted to witness for themselves the strength of the last move!

As the spectators watched, Emperor Golden Snake suddenly moved.

Whoosh! Eight ‘Emperor Golden Snake’s appeared in the air.

These were eight ‘Emperor Golden Snake’s, rather than his residual shadows.

The figures besieged Jian Wushuang.

“God!”

“What’s that?”

“Eight, eight Emperor Golden Snakes?”

Experts outside the Restriction were stunned.

“Phantom, eight phantoms. Has he mastered the Phantom Saber Principle so perfectly?” Emperor Fengxiao exclaimed.

On the battlefield, eight ‘Emperor Golden Snake’s surrounded Jian Wushuang. Suddenly, they raised their black scimitars in concert with cold smiles.

The eight ‘Emperors Golden Snake’s attacked Jian Wushuang simultaneously. He wasn’t able to tell which was the Original Body of Emperor Golden Snake.

The black scimitars continued their fervent slashes.

As the attacks grew faster and stronger, Jian Wushuang couldn’t tell where the blade light came from.

He discovered its source when he felt a coldness at his back.

By then, it was too late.
