Chapter 866: The Dramatic Change

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Before they knew it, the group had been in the Stellar Fog Sea for one year.

Under the cover of lots of gray fog, swish! A cold sword shadow burst swiftly out and instantly slashed a purple Exotic Beast ten meters in height. The purple beast let out a desperate scream and was viciously killed.

Seeing Jian Wushuang kill the purple Exotic Beast, Jiu Zui, Ling Long and Shui Jin all went up to it.

“Blood Mountain, it seems your swordsmanship is better than before.” Jiu Zui looked at Jian Wushuang, a little solemnly.

Ling Long and Shui Jin both nodded. They saw it, too.

“Yes, a little.” Jian Wushuang smiled and did not deny it.

During the year, the four of them had been roving around in the Stellar Fog Sea. They bumped into thousands of Exotic Beasts. Some of these Exotic Beasts appeared alone, and some gathered together in twos and threes.

Once the four met these Exotic Beasts, a fierce battle would break right out.

Jian Wushuang considered these Exotic Beasts his enhancement objects. As he fought fiercely with these Exotic Beasts, he was constantly honing his swordsmanship and improving his strength.

After one year, he had not made too much progress, but his swordsmanship had improved.

“Among the four of us, you are already the strongest, but you are still making continued progress.” Jiu Zui smiled bitterly because he himself was indeed very strong, but he barely had any confidence in competing with Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had fully proved his strength in several fierce battles this year.

Notably, they had encountered danger several times during the year.

In this critical moment, Jian Wushuang would come forward and use his almost invincible Killing Move, and he could not be resisted at all.

Now even Jiu Zui had to admit that Jian Wushuang was stronger than him, and he was absolutely the strongest of them all.

“Blood Mountain, I really envy you. Obviously, you are strong enough, but you still have a lot of room for improvement,” said Jiu Zui. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“As for us, we have reached peak Eternal Realm and almost have no room to improve our strength. It would be impossible to improve greatly unless we break through and reach the Dao Master realm. But it’s too hard and we probably couldn’t make it even if we struggled for a lifetime.”

“But you, tsk...”

Hearing this, Ling Long and Shui Jin both nodded.

They had reached the peak of the Eternal Realm and had little room for improvement.

But Jian Wushuang?

He was merely a Divine Realm expert.

He still had huge room for growth. He would surely make a leap in strength in the future when he broke through and reached the Eternal Realm.

“By the way, when will you break through and reach the Eternal Realm?” Ling Long looked at Jian Wushuang.

The Stellar Fog Sea was extremely dangerous. Naturally, while they wondered around here, the stronger they were, the better. In the current realm, Jian Wushuang already had exceptional strength. Once he broke through to the Eternal Realm, his battle strength would increase and he could be of even greater help to them.

“Break through to the Eternal Realm? Soon, I guess.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He was not lying, as indeed he would break through soon.

Back in the Firmament Territory, his Third Senior Brother Bai Hu gave him a Seven-colored Dao Fruit which was of great help to his comprehension of the Dao.

Later, he meditated in the Divine Sea twice, which substantially improved his comprehension of the Dao. He hadn’t completely mastered the ninth Occult in both the World Dao and Slaughter Dao, but it was only a step away and he felt it would not be long before he could break through.

The four were talking and laughing casually, when...

Boom! The whole world began shaking.

As it shook, heavy voices suddenly came from the nearby void.

“What’s happening?”

The group looked serious. Jian Wushuang deployed the Scarlet Eye immediately to see ahead.

“What is it? Do you see something?” Ling Long asked.

“Not yet.”

Jian Wushuang shook his head. With gray fog covering the Stellar Fog Sea, with his Scarlet Eye, he could only see clearly for a hundred meters, and those heavy voices obviously came from farther away.

It seemed something was approaching quickly, as those heavy voices were getting louder and louder.

“Are they Exotic Beasts?” Jiu Zui’s asked with a grave expression.

As they wandered around in the Stellar Fog Sea, they mostly met Exotic Beasts.

“Wait a second, I’m about to see it.” Jian Wushuang used the Scarlet Eye Secret Skill the best he could and stared ahead. The next moment, huge Exotic Beasts appeared for him to see.

Too many, there were too many Exotic Beasts.

Just a moment later, there were at least hundreds of Exotic Beasts in his sight.

“This, this is actually an Exotic Beast rampage!” There was a hint of fright in Jian Wushuang’s eyes, and he immediately screamed. “Run! Hurry up!”

As he shouted, Jian Wushuang turned straight around and ran.

Jiu Zui, Ling Long and Shui Jin couldn’t see the thousands of Exotic Beasts charging, but they all believed Jian Wushuang’s Scarlet Eye Secret Skill. After all, with its help, Jian Wushuang was always the first to discover Exotic Beasts in the past year.

Now Jian Wushuang panicked, which meant he had seen something terrifying.

Without hesitation, Jiu Zui, Ling Long and Shui Jin immediately turned and ran like crazy.

Shortly after the three of them turned and fled, they could see the Exotic Beast rampage.

“Oh my God!”

“This... this!”

“Why are there so many?”

Jiu Zui, Ling Long and Shui Jin were all dumbstruck.

They all saw the countless Exotic Beasts behind them.

There were a large number of Exotic Beasts in formidable formation. They saw no less than a hundred, and there were even more tall figures that were too hazy to see in the fog.

There were many kinds of Exotic Beasts, many of which they had met in the past year, like huge One-eyed Giants, evil Exotic Beasts with black scales all over them, and Exotic Beasts spreading out their wings like Winged Dragons, incredibly skilled in speed.

Before, they had only come across the occasional Exotic Beast. At worst only a few of them had gathered together, which they could still manage. But they had never seen such a terrifying rampage with so many Exotic Beasts.

Who could stop this overwhelming amount of Exotic Beasts?

The four of them were far from being able to fight so many.

So, they could only escape!

Run like crazy!
