2047 Take Action Personally

“I want to leave and no one can stop me!”

Jian Wushuang said with absolute confidence.

His confidence wasn’t only because his current power could make him fearless under the besiegement of the thirteen Great Emperors, but more importantly, because the Emperor Supreme Rock had shattered. Not only was the Emperor Supreme Rock the source of energy that drove the dark millstone, it was also the main factor of the great formation surrounding Imperial Peak and Imperial City.

Once the Emperor Supreme Rock shattered, the great formation in Imperial Peak and Imperial City would simply be nothing.

Without the surrounding great formation, the thirteen Great Emperors wanted him to stay?

That was simply a joke.

“Go away!!”

Jian Wushuang let out an angry roar. His voice contained boundless power as though the universe was angry.

There were originally four Great Emperors in front of him. However, when they saw that Jian Wushuang had filled the air with terrifying sword intention, they pounced forward.

“Step back!”

“Hurry up and retreat!”

The four Great Emperors retreated without hesitation.

Even when four Great Emperors joined forces, they wouldn’t have the courage to stop Jian Wushuang.

“Rubbish!”

Ling Zong, who was following Jian Wushuang, saw it and he cursed.

However, he was sure that even if the four Great Emperors were to block Jian Wushuang, they would only be beaten back by Jian Wushuang in an instant.

Hong!

Jian Wushuang was raging with anger. He plunged out of Imperial City directly.

The thirteen Great Emperors followed Jian Wushuang but they were merely following him.

After a short while, Jian Wushuang escaped from Imperial Peak and left Imperial City. He continued to plunge into the boundless, vast region in Three-Emperors World.

The thirteen Great Emperors could do nothing about him.

“Ling Zong.”

The tall and sturdy middle-aged man flying alongside with Ling Zong looked distressed, “Jian Wushuang is much stronger than thirty years ago. We can’t stop him, report to the higher-ups.

Ling Zong’s body quivered.

His eyebrows were tightly knitted. Even though he was unwilling to yield, he knew that whatever the tall and sturdy middle-aged man said was true.

“Report then.”

Ling Zong sighed and took out a token to send a message.

…

In the dark void, the three overlords sat there.

Then, the three of their faces grew grave.

They were in the dark millstone. The three of them were controlling the dark millstone. But as the Emperor Supreme Rock shattered and the dark millstone lost its energy source, it completely stopped.

If they couldn’t find another huge Emperor Supreme Rock, they wouldn’t make the dark millstone move again.

“Jian Wushuang didn’t die?” The brawny Demon King let out an earth-shaking roar. He stared and said, “That bunch of rubbish! What did they do thirty years ago?! Didn’t they say that they killed Jian Wushuang? Why is he still living well right now? He even broke the Emperor Supreme Rock!”

“He destroyed the Emperor Supreme Rock and he left Imperial Peak and Imperial City openly? Ling Zong and the other twelve in Peak Chaotic Realm couldn’t stop him but they have to get help from us?”

“Rubbish! A bunch of rubbish!”

Demon King cursed and roared.

The blurry blood man next to him gave out a chilly aura, “We put in so much time and effort in building the dark millstone but Jian Wushuang ruined it. Our hard word is in vain. Jian Wushuang deserves to die!!!”

Demon King and the blurry blood man harbored great hatred against Jian Wushuang.

Only Leng Ruxue’s eyes were twinkling with a different emotion. She kept quiet for a while before she spoke, “As it already happened, it’s too late for us to complain. Let’s think about what we should do next.”

“As the dark millstone stopped, Sanctuary Alliance will definitely take action. We’d better get ready.”

“Mm,” Demon King nodded in agreement and he calmed down. “How about this? The two of you stay here and deal with Sanctuary Alliance. As for Jian Wushuang, I’ll take care of him personally. I’d like to see how powerful is this Jian Wsuhuang. Why the thirteen Great Emperors from Three-Emperors World could do nothing about him!!”

Then, Demon King didn’t care about Leng Ruxue and the blurry blood man’s respond but plunged to Three-Emperors World immediately.

The blurry blood man didn’t bother much but Leng Ruxue’s eyes dilated in shock.

She originally intended to fight against Jian Wushuang but Demon King took the initiative and went ahead. She naturally didn’t speak.

Jian Wushuang, oh, Jian Wushuang. You didn’t thirty years ago under that kind of situation. You are impressive!”

“It seems like I really belittled you.”

Leng Ruxue muttered but she smirked in a malicious smile.

…

Three-Emperors World was in complete chaos. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

In the palace in the nearby void around the dark millstone, the Great Emperors who were the higher-ups of Sanctuary Alliance gathered there. Emperor Bai was naturally the leader.

The Great Emperors from Sanctuary Alliance were gathered by Emperor Bai in a sudden. Most of them attended in their consciousness incarnation. Then, all of them looked confused as they didn’t know why Emperor Bai suddenly gathered them.

When everyone was there,

“Everyone,”

Emperor Bai spoke and looked around, “I have something to tell all of you. The Emperor Supreme Rock shattered. The dark millstone stopped.”

“What?”

A tossed stone raised a thousand ripples.

The surrounding Great Emperors looked astonished.

Ever since thirty years ago when they found out that the four-members troop that they sent fell into the enemy’s trap and both Jian Wushuang and Great Emperor Zhi Luo died, they didn’t have any hope about destroying the Emperor Supreme Rock. On the contrary, they focused all their effort on gathering experts and bringing the powerful ones in Eternal Chaotic World.

However, they had yet to fully prepare after thirty years but Emperor Bai told them that the Emperor Supreme Rock was shattered and the dark millstone had stopped.

They were in disbelief at first when they heard the news. But they finally confirmed when they checked the dark millstone.

“The dark millstone isn’t moving anymore!”

“It really stopped!!”

“Haha, it really stopped?!”

The Great Emperors were thrilled in happiness. Some even shed tears of joy.

The dark millstone was a really big threat against Eternal Chaotic World.

If it continued to spin, the entire Eternal Chaotic World would vanish into thin air and it wouldn’t take long for it to happen.

Hence, they had been very anxious and they had been thinking of ways for the dark millstone to stop. They already put in a lot of hard work to make it happen.

Then, when they found out that the dark millstone finally stopped, how could they not feel surprised?

Of course, they were also confused when they were surprised.
