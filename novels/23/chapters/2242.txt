Chapter 2243 Fear

This indeed was the Body of Undying: to be able to regenerate a destroyed body almost immediately with no effects on his fighting power.Body of Undying... As an expert from the ancient past, Old Monster Jiao clearly knew how terrifying the Body of Undying was.

This was why the Undying Saints could do whatever they wanted within the Absolute Beginning Divine World. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Old Monster Jiao had not expected Emperor Bai, as someone in the Chaotic Realm, to possess the Body of Undying.

“How is this possible?” Old Monster Jiao cried out.

“Sir Jiao, I understand that it is difficult to believe what I just said . However, this is a fact. I have the project image with me,” Chen Qi said as he whipped out a project image token.

During the battle between Emperor Bai and Blood Emperor, all of the almighties from the Eternal Chaotic World had been there watching the fight. They had used a project image token to record the battle. After the war, these project images had started to become widespread within the Eternal Chaotic World. Chen Qi had obtained one easily.

As the project image appeared in front of everyone. The experts in the Divine Demon Realm and Old Monster Jiao saw how Emperor Bai’s divine body was first destroyed, then regenerated almost instantly with their own eyes.

“Indeed. That is Body of Undying,” Old Monster Jiao clenched his fist and said. His face was dark.

Body of Undying. An expert in the Chaotic Realm possessed the Body of Undying?

“I am sure that everyone here knows how scary the Body of Undying can be. On top of this, Emperor Bai has incredible fighting power. Given how we can only have fighting power limited to the chaotic realm, he is basically invincible.”

Chen Qi continued solemnly, “This means that it is impossible to kill him even if we work with each other. We can only defeat him. ”

Hearing this, Old Monster Jiao trembled. He had to admit Chen Qi was speaking the truth.

With that level of fighting power, and with the Body of Undying, it was true that killing him was a dream.

“Humph. Even if I can’t kill him, I want him to pay ten times, or even a hundred times the price!!”

“I will destroy Sanctuary Alliance and kill everyone around him!” Old Monster Jiao roared with anger.

“That is feasible. Other than Emperor Bai, the other people within Sanctuary Alliance and the people of this era were generally weak and we do not need to be afraid. However, there are still things we need to look out for,” Chen Qi said.

“First, we need to watch out for the Sword Emperor. From the intel I have, the Sword Emperor only has the fighting power of an ordinary stage-three great emperor. Any one of the experts in the divine demon realm here can stop him and defeat him. However, he has incredible techniques and trump cards. The reason why the Blood Emperor lost twenty thousand over years ago was because the Sword Emperor cast an incredible secret skill which boosted his fighting power. He also had a treasure which he used to kill the Blood Emperor.”

“I think that the Sword Emperor can only use these techniques at a great cost. I wonder if he can still use them. We just need to be more cautious. Once he casts the secret skill, it is in our best interests to temporarily retreat to avoid him at his strongest. We can attack again at a later time,” Chen Qi said.

Hearing this, the surrounding people nodded their heads.

Everyone had to take the Sword Emperor seriously as he could kill the Blood Emperor, who could use the power of the Divine Demon Realm once he used his secret skill.

They should avoid the Sword Emperor when he cast the secret skill.

“On top of this, we should be extra cautious of one more man,” Chen Qi continued.

“Extra cautious? Who?” Old Monster Jiao looked over and asked.

“Emperor Thirteen!!” When Chen Qi said this name, it was evident that his voice was different.

Old Monster Jiao’s irises contracted.

As for the experts in the Divine Demon Realm, they were all stunned and confused.

“Lord Chen Qi, who is Emperor Thirteen? Is he a greater threat than Emperor Bai and the Sword Emperor?” One of the experts in the Divine Demon Realm asked.

These experts in the Divine Demon Realms would have been mere pawns back in the Ancient Battlefield. They had no idea of what happened at the higher levels.

They didn’t know the really powerful people like Emperor Thirteen.

“Of course. Compared to Emperor Thirteen, Emperor Bai and the Sword Emperor are nothing. After all, these two are cultivators of this era. We only need to take them seriously because of the presence of the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth. However, Emperor Thirteen is different. He is like us: he came from the Absolute Beginning Divine World!” Chen Qi said.

“So what?” That expert in the Divine Demon Realm was still confused.

All of them came from the Absolute Beginning Divine World. Why should they be extra cautious?

“Haha,” Chen Qi had a weird laugh and looked at that expert mockingly.

“Chen Qi. Is that Emperor Thirteen from Seven Star Black Sect, the leader of Seven Stars and the one who challenged and injured the Master of Holy Land in a one on one fight?” Old Monster Jiao looked over at Chen Qi and asked.

“Yes, that is him,” Chen Qi nodded his head.

Old Monster Jiao’s heart skipped a beat.

The other experts in the Divine Demon Realm took a cold breath.

“Challenge the Master of Holy Land in a one on one fight? And injure him in the fight?”

“Oh my god. Emperor Thirteen is such a terrifying being?”

“Seven Star Black Sect? There are people from the Seven Star Black Sect who survived? And his power level is similar to that of the Master of Holy Land?”

These experts in the Divine Demon Realm were trembling in fear.

Experts in the Divine Demon Realm were superpowers in this era. However, they were nothing back in the Ancient Past.

Back in the Ancient Past, these people were mere pawns in the battlefield of the highest level.

However, Master of Holy Land... He had been one of the strongest men back in the Absolute Beginning Divine World.

To these experts, a Undying Saint was already considered a superpower that they would kneel down to.

Master of the Holy Land?

That man was even more powerful.

After they discovered Emperor Thirteen’s true power and identity, these experts fell silent.

Those who had thought Emperor Thirteen was nothing previously were now fearful.

Who dared to look down on someone who was comparable to the Master of Holy Land? That person would be a joke.

“Emperor Thirteen awakened a very long time ago, much earlier than me. He was one of the main reasons why the Blood Emperor lost back in the great battle twenty thousand years ago. From my sources, Emperor Thirteen is not part of the Sanctuary Alliance. The reason why he helped out back then was because of the Sword Emperor. This means that Emperor Thirteen should not appear if we do not threaten the life of the Sword Emperor,” Chen Qi said.
