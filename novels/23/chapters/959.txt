Chapter 960: The End of the Battle

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The world map above in the void slowly rolled up and fell down.

The 36 Diabolic Pillars, which were covered with mysterious lines and patterns, suddenly burst open and could no longer suppress the 36 prefectures of Tang of the East.

The gray defensive cover above Tang of the East began to disperse.

Countless living beings in Tang of the East noticed that the vitality of their lives ceased to drain away.

They erupted into cheers.

“The Life Devouring Formation has been demolished!”

Everyone on the battlefield was thrilled too. At this moment, all of them fixed their gaze upon the youth in the center of the huge battlefield.

Jian Wushuang stood there alone. He was just a young man with Eternal Realm.

However, it was this youth that had achieved an incredible miracle once again.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang also turned his head to look at the crowd, kindly and smilingly.

“I, Jian Wushuang, never let my relatives and friends down.

“I never let you down in the past, and I’ll never let you down in the future.”

Jian Wushuang said plainly and somewhat relievedly.

Upon hearing that, the crowd burst into a spontaneous cheer.

“Third Brother!” shouted Wang Yuan and Yang Zaixuan.

They were particularly excited.

They had only been able to stand by and watch the fight during the battles, since they were far beyond their levels.

They had been shocked and outraged when seeing Jian Wushuang fall into crisis. Now, when they saw him kill Dao Yuanzi and demolish Life Devouring Formation, they were so proud that they could not help but ran toward Jian Wushuang.

“Don’t go there.”

Alchemy Master said and stopped them with his arm outstretched in front of them.

“Is there anything wrong?” asked Wang Yuan, confusedly.

Alchemy Master did not reply, but he wore an exceptionally solemn expression on his face.

Not only him, but also the other powerful and wise experts such as Gu Tong, Emperor Xiao and Emperor Yun all discovered that Jian Wushuang did not feel alright. They even believed that he was suffering!

“He has forced himself to absorb such powerful Inheritance Essence Blood…” Gu Tong sighed secretly. “As an expert with Eternal Realm, he can never control such a formidable power.”

“Jian Wushuang…” Emperor Xiao sighed, feeling uneasy. His face became pale.

Not far away from Jian Wushuang, crouched a large centipede, Gu King. It also fixed its red eyes upon Jian Wushuang.

As for Leng Rushuang, she still remained unconscious. Gu King had already sent her to Emperor Xiao instead of carrying her on its back.

Now that Life Devouring Formation was demolished, Gu King did not have to carry her around to keep her safe.

“Young man, I’ve advised you not to get involved in this mess. You chose to play the hero yourself. Now, you saved others, but your own life is in great danger now,” murmured Gu King.

Jian Wushuang quietly stood at the center of the battlefield, looking calm and collected on the outside, but actually he was resisting a strong impact inside.

The Ancient God Power contained in the Inheritance Essence Blood of King Luo Zhen was eroding his insides. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This caused unbearable pains to him and made him feel as if his insides had been set on fire and his bones, smashed into pieces.

“I guess I have no choice now.”

Jian Wushuang thought with a bitter smile on his face.

“Boom!” His huge body shook and exploded into a dense blood fog in front of everyone.

Drops of blood began to fall toward the center of the battlefield, giving everyone present a shock.

“Third Brother!!!”

Wang Yuan and Yang Zaixuan were overwhelmed by the sadness.

“Junior brother!” Xue Lingtian turned pale with fright.

Right at this moment, excitement suddenly flickered within the eyes of Gu King, who had been staying around Jian Wushuang in the void all this while. It stared straight ahead and spotted a drop of dark golden blood in the blood fog.

All the drops in the fog were red, except that one.

Gu King acted immediately.

It rustled into the blood fog instantly and opened its mouth to catch and swallow the drop of dark golden blood. In the meantime, its tentacles all stood up, ready to clear up the battlefield.

It used its tentacles to pick up Jian Wushuang’s Interspatial Ring and Mountain River Map as well as Dao Yuanzi’s treasures.

After that, it gave a long roar towards the sky and then tunnelled into the ground.

“Boom—”

It swiftly entered the depths of the sinkhole and then the underground world, disappearing from everyone’s view.

This scene stunned everyone present.

Upon seeing that, they reached the same conclusion.

“Jian Wushuang must be dead.

“He turned himself into a dense blood fog. There’s no chance that he is still alive.

“His worm beast escaped with all his and Dao Yuanzi’s treasures.”

All of a sudden, the world became quiet.

“You bitch, look what you’ve done!” Emperor Xiao was furious and stared at Emperor Leng, who was standing right in front of him.

Sadness was evident on the beautiful face of Emperor Leng. Her eyes were vacant, and her attitude was cold regardless of how everyone else looked at her.

Despite that, she could not help feeling painful inside.

The next moment, when Emperor Xiao came at her and suppressed her, she did not resist at all.

“Xuan Yi, I’ve tried my best to fight this battle today. The agreement between you and me ends here. Goodbye.”

King Gu Tong sent a message to Xuan Yi. After that, he swished his hand to open a wormhole in the void and left through it.

At this point in time, this unprecedentedly fierce battle finally concluded. Dao Yuanzi was killed, and Jian Wushuang was believed to be dead. His worm beast was thought to have fled with all their treasures.

“It ended,” someone murmured.

“What an incredible battle! It’s finally over,” someone exclaimed.

“It had too many twists and turns,” someone added.

“Jian Wushuang is such a peerless genius, a ‘once-in-a-generation’ talent. Unfortunately, he’s dead…” someone sighed.

“What a pity!” someone echoed.

The crowd burst into exclamations and sighs.
