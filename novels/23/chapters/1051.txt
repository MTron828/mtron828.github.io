Chapter 1052: Special Person

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Su Rou couldn’t help sighing after hearing Jian Wushuang’s story.

“So that’s what happened. Your father became a Reincarnator?”

She knew how cruel the cultivation of a Reincarnator was.

“I’ve already requested the help of Elder Ding Mo of the Samsara Temple to find my father several days ago. I think I’ll get an answer in a few days,” Jian Wushuang said.

“I’m sure an Elder of the Inner Hall of the temple would definitely help you find your father,” Su Rou replied.

“Let’s hope so.”

Inside a large courtyard halfway up the mountain housed the Blood Asura Clan.

“Third Brother, please make this your home for the moment and take your time to recuperate. If you need anything, feel free to call for me,” Su Rou said.

“Alright.” Jian Wushuang made a small nod. He wouldn’t be overly courteous to her.

Su Rou soon took leave.

Now Jian Wushuang alone sat upright beside a stone table.

“Jian Wushuang, as for Jiu Xiu… What do you plan to do with him?” Gu King’s voice suddenly resounded.

“Jiu Xiu?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes, his gaze landing on Jiu Xiu who was being suppressed inside his Sword Mountain.

“Jiu Xiu sure is stubborn. I triggered all the restrictions within the sword and tormenting him for so long, but he’s still refusing to talk.” Jian Wushuang’s gaze was steely.

“That’s only natural. The current restrictions are useless and I’ve no way of triggering anything stronger at the moment. Moreover, Celestial Master Dong Ming said that it’ll do Mother good to keep Jiu Xiu alive. I don’t know if he’s telling the truth but then again, I’m not in a hurry to kill him.”

“I’ll just keep him suppressed in the Sword Mountain then.”

Jian Wushuang was feeling helpless as well.

He had planned to force Jiu Xiu to reveal his mother’s whereabouts. However, the latter refused to speak. There was nothing he could do about it.

“Now, all I can do is wait for Elder Ding Mo’s news.” Jian Wushuang immediately started healing his injuries while waiting for news from Elder Ding Mo.

Several days later, Ding Mo finally contacted him.

“Jian Wushuang, I heard you escape unscathed after Patriarch of Empyrean Glory and Celestial Master Dong Ming of the Ancient Demon Clan teamed up to hunt you. How powerful!”

He had already caused such a great commotion after being pursued in the first place. Later on, he made a bet with Patriarch of Empyrean Glory and survived three of his attacks head-on in front of such a large audience. Naturally, the news spread far and wide.

Of course Ding Mo, as an Elder of the Inner Hall of the Samsara Temple, would hear about it.

“Just a stroke of good luck. Moreover, Asura Lord showed up and helped me tide over this crisis. Otherwise…” Jian Wushuang said, imagining the possible outcome.

“Asura Lord of the Blood Asura Clan? Tsk, tsk. I never thought you’d share such a friendship with her,” Ding Mo said.

“Elder Ding Mo, I’m sure you’re contacting me because you’ve made progress in my request?” Jian Wushuang went straight to the point, giving Ding Mo no chance to waste time on idle chatter.

“You’re right. Moreover, I’m sure it ought to be good news to you,” Ding Mo replied.

“Good news?” Jian Wushuang was initially overjoyed but a frown colored his expression just as quickly. “What do you mean ‘ought to’?”

“I used my authority to begin investigating, starting from your next of kin’s origins and the time period in which he became a Reincarnator. I did found someone matching the description,” Ding Mo began to explain.

“Did you find him?” Jian Wushuang’s heart tightened.

“Calm down,” Ding Mo said. “I did discover the existence of such a person. But the odd thing is that I only found the information on him before he became the Rank Five Reincarnator and below but not those above. Yet my investigation reveals that he isn’t one of the current Rank Five Reincarnators of the Samsara Temple.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“What do you mean?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“What did it mean that he could only find the information before this man became Rank Five Reincarnators and below but not those above?

Did this mean that my father failed in the Rank Five Reincarnator test and die?”

“He’s not dead. If he hadn’t survived the test, his information would’ve been completely obliterated. He currently has information available to Rank Five Reincarnators but not those above, yet he himself isn’t among the Rank Five Reincarnators of the Samsara Temple. If this happens in the Samsara Continent, there’s only one explanation for it,” Ding Mo said solemnly.

“What is it?” Jian Wushuang immediately asked.

“He’s a special person who means a great deal or poses a great function for the Samsara Temple!” Ding Mo said.

“Special person?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“There is a very rare group of people in the Samsara Temple. They’re so special that the temple holds them in the highest of regards. So information about them is top secret. Not even an Elder of the Inner Hall like me has the right to read it. As far as I know, there are currently no more than ten of such special persons in the Samsara Temple!”

“It serves to reason that your family member should be one of them!” Ding Mo’s voice was rather solemn.

“Each special person of the Samsara Temple is equivalent to a precious treasure. In terms of status, they were much more important than a mere Elder of the Inner Hall like me.”

“I see,” Jian Wushuang said, his expression also becoming strange.

“So my father is a special person whom the Samsara Temple attaches much importance to?”

“Jian Wushuang, the reason why I say that it’s a good news to you is that such special persons would be very well-protected. Under ordinary circumstances, they’d never die. Since your family member is a special person, he ought to be living well and even has a higher status than me in the Samsara Temple,” Ding Mo continued.

“I understand. Thank you very much, Elder Ding Mo.” Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh, a smile finally emerging on his face.

Even though Ding Mo didn’t manage to find his father’s whereabouts, the former nevertheless still told him one piece of good news.

“If Father truly holds a high status in the Samsara Temple, he must be fairly influential. I caused such a great commotion in the Divine Demon Domain, so maybe he has already heard of it. Who knows if he’s already making plans to come and find me?” Jian Wushuang said with a smile, joy buoying his heart.

Once the communication was over, Jian Wushuang went to look for Su Rou.

“Fourth Sister, I need your help,” he said.

“Your business is my business. Don’t be so polite.” Su Rou smiled at him. She had always considered him as her biological brother.

He chuckled and no longer tried to be courteous. “I need you to use your influence to keep an eye on the top experts of the Samsara Temple and see if any of them resemble my father.”

“Moreover, there’s the Ancient Demon Clan as well. Since their clan and yours are the two top clans among the four great clans, I’m sure there are a lot of explicit and covert fights going on each day, so much so that both clans know each other well. I need you to help me investigate my mother’s whereabouts in the Ancient Demon Clan.”
