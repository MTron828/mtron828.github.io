Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang crossed his hands behind his back and looked indifferently at the experts in front of him. Suddenly, his expression changed, he asked, “Master True Eyes, shouldn’t the patrol team be composed of ten Principles Masters and 100 Peak Saints?

“Lhave seen the 100 Peak Saints, but why do I only see nine Principles Masters and one more random guy?”

“Well...” Master True Eyes looked at the Principles Masters around him and frowned. “Inspector, I’ve asked my men to inform them. Everyone should have arrived by now, but I don’t know why he didn’t come. I’ll send a message to him now.”

Master True Eyes was about to send a message.

‘The middle-aged man who had been drinking with Master True Eyes stood up and said, “Inspector, Master True Eyes is...drunk!”

“Oh, drunk?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and found it funny.

Although good wine could make people drunk, in the Divine Beginning Realm, any cultivator who was slightly stronger could freely control their drunkenness, especially when they had reached the level of Principles Master. With a thought, they could make their drunkenness disappear completely.

‘The bottle of wine was enough to make a Principles Master lose consciousness completely. He did not even know if there was such wine in the Divine Beginning Realm, so how could Master True Eyes be drunk? Even if he was really drunk, it was probably on purpose.

“Inspector, this Master True Eyes is too presumptuous. I’ll bring him here now,” said Master True Eyes.

“No need.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand. “Since this Master True Eyes is unwilling to come to see me, I’ll go and see him.”

“You’re willing to see him, sir?” Master True Eyes was stunned.

“Lead the way,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Master True Eyes said nothing more and led Jian Wushuang to the attic where Master True Eyes was.

As for the Principles Masters of the patrol team, they looked at each other and immediately followed.

“Let’s go and take a look.”

“The Master True Eyes doesn’t listen to the order of the patrol master. This is going to be a good show.”

“If [were the patrol master, I would definitely teach him a good lesson.”

While discussing among themselves, the Peak Saints also followed suit.

Soon, Jian Wushuang arrived in front of the attic.

“Patrol master, this is the residence of the clear-eyed master. He should be in the attic now,” Master True Eyes said.

Jian Wushuang glanced at the attic and sensed the aura of Master True Eyes. He immediately said coldly, “Master True Eyes, come out. Do you want me to invite you in personally?”

“Who is it?”

A dissatisfied voice sounded, and then Master True Eyes walked out of the attic with a red face and a smell of alcohol.

But on the surface, it seemed that Master True Eyes was really drunk.

“True Eyes, how dare you ignore the order of the inspector?” He stared at Master True Eyes coldly and shouted.

“Inspector? Who? Him?” Master True Eyes looked like a drunkard, he glanced at Jian Wushuang from the corner of his eyes and then burst into laughter. “Are you kidding me? Isn’t he just a young boy at the Saint Realm? How dare you call him an inspector? I don’t think I’m drunk. You’re drunk!”

“How dare you! How dare you disrespect an Inspector?” Master True Eyes could not help but shout angrily.

In front of everyone in the patrol team, he directly told them that Jian Wushuang was merely an Immortal Saint. Anyone with a discerning eye could tell that this Master True Eyes was deliberately pretending to be crazy, but in fact, he was trying to embarrass Jian Wushuang.

“Master True Eyes, right?” Jian Wushuang looked at the Master True Eyes with his hands behind his back.

“It’s me,” Master True Eyes replied with a hint of mockery in his eyes.

“Do you know your identity?” Jian Wushuang asked indifferently.

“Of course I do. I’m the captain of the sixth patrol team of the Temporal Temple,” Master True Eyes said.

“Then do you know who I am?” Jian Wushuang asked again.

“You? Didn’t I tell you that you’re just a young boy at the Saint Realm? Yes, you’re just an Immortal Saint. How dare you talk to me? Get out of my way,” Master True Eyes scolded.

“Good, you’re really brave. Now that you know your identity, it’s easy to deal with you. Now, as the sixth inspector of the Temporal Temple, I order you, Master True Eyes, to disobey my orders. Everyone in the camp is publicly disobeying my orders. Immediately suppress and send you to the eighth level of

the boundless prison. You’ll never be able to get out!” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“What?”

Jian Wushuang’s words shocked everyone around him.

The boundless prison was a place used by the Temporal Temple to lock up experts. It was also very famous in the Divine Beginning Realm.

There were nine levels in the boundless prison. Each level had some unbearable torture that could even make people break down. It was extremely terrifying. The eighth level of the boundless prison was only inferior to the ninth level, this was definitely a place that made many people tremble in fear.

Now, Jian Wushuang had given the order to lock the Master True Eyes directly into the eighth level of the boundless prison. However, Jian Wushuang was now an inspector, and the Master True Eyes was his subordinate, Jian Wushuang indeed had the right to do so, and he had a reason for it.

‘The Master True Eyes openly disobeyed orders. Just this alone, even if Jian Wushuang wanted to kill him, it was reasonable. Although the Master True Eyes only wanted to show off to Jian Wushuang, he did not really want to disobey orders, however, he did do so.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, what did you just say? You want to suppress me and put me in the boundless prison?” The Master True Eyes was instantly enraged, his eyes were filled with raging anger. As for his drunkenness, it had all dissipated.

“What? Are you clear-headed now?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. “Does no one understand what I said? take him down!”

“Thi:

.” The surrounding Principles Masters were at a loss. Even Master True Eyes was stunned, but he did not come forward immediately.

“Let’s see who dares!” Master True Eyes looked around, his aura of the three void realms swept across the area. In the end, he looked at Jian Wushuang again. “Heavenly Sword Marquis, aren’t you lucky enough to be favored by the Temple Master? Now that the Temple Master has gone to the universe

battlefield, how dare you be so arrogant? And you want to suppress me in the boundless prison? Haha, what a joke!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“I, pure eye, have been in the Temporal Temple for so many years and have made great contributions. Even Temple Master Bai Xing and Lord Ba Cang have to think twice before suppressing me. Who do you think you are?”

The voice of Master True Eyes shook the sky, showing no respect for Jian Wushuang.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang smiled.
