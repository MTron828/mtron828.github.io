Chapter 2085 The Tribes Unite

“Oh Ancient Emperor.”

Someone stood up as Jian Wushuang ended his speech.

It was a black-robed old man who let off an eerie aura.

King Chen Xing standing beside Jian Wushuang whispered, “That man is the leader of the Black Bone Clan, Hei Qi. Although their clan cannot be compared to the top four Clans, their abilities are not to be underestimated. Furthermore, they follow the Sky Swallowing Clan.”

Jian Wushuang understood.

“Clan Elder Hei Qi, may I know your thoughts?” Jian Wushuang smiled back.

“O’ Ancient Emperor, I myself have received the message from the Sanctuary Alliance. But in my humble opinion, this fight is only between the Three Emperors World and the humans, and has nothing to do with us special tribes. Even if is the Holocaust Sect, or the Archelon Palace, they are only active in human domains, very rarely do they step on our grounds.”

“If it is a battle amongst humans, we special tribes have no need to interfere,” Hei Qi replied.

This caused a slight commotion within the crowd.

Jian Wushuang watched the crowd from above, and saw how they responded. He replied, “Looks like you have not fully grasped the severity of this issue, Clan Elder Hei Qi. Indeed, we have never interfered in human matters, and vice versa, of course we would not interfere if it was a simple war between the humans.”

“But this issue, do you really think it only involves humans?”

“Everyone, let me show you all a projected image.”

As he spoke, Jian Wushuang waved his hand. Instantly, a large projected image appeared above the Void.

In that projection was the great Dark Millstone.

As the millstone moved, it crushed everything. Everywhere it went, every inch of grass, every domain, and countless Cultivators, were all crushed into ash. Nothing remained.

And as it turned, the Millstone expanded exponentially.

Seeing this, all the experts were shocked.

“O’ Ancient Emperor, what is this thing in the projection?” A clan elder inquired.

“This is the Dark Millstone, as you can see, it devours everything in its path, and within the the Millstone lies the Three Emperors World! This is the source of the crisis the Sanctuary Alliance has warned us of!”

“But rest assured, a team of experts from the Sanctuary Alliance had barged into the Three Emperors World and destroyed the energy source within it, stopping the Millstone, but at a great cost,” Jian Wushuang said.

As they heard that the Millstone had stopped, the experts all heaved a sigh of relief. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Even as a projection, they all saw how terrifying the Millstone was.

Without a doubt, if the Millstone continued to expand, the entire Eternal Chaotic World would go down in flames.

“O’ Ancient Emperor,” Hei Qi from the Black Bone Clan spoke once again. “The Millstone is indeed terrifying, but it has not appeared in our special tribes domain, and as you’ve said, it had stopped. It poses no more threat. In this case, the only enemies of the Three Emperor World are the humans…”

Hei Qi could not finish his sentence.

“Foolish!”

Jian Wushuang interrupted him in a fit of rage.

“O’ Ancient Emperor, what do you mean?” Hei Qi’s face darkened, a tinge of anger visible through his eyes.

“I called you foolish, unbelievably foolish,” Jian Wushuang pointed at Hei Qi and scolded, “I really have my doubts on how you became clan leader! What stupid words you’ve said!”

“You say since the Millstone has stopped and has not affected our special tribe domain, it’s not our enemy?”

“That’s like saying the enemy was about to strike you with his sword, but was blocked by another. You being the stupid one then begin to say the enemy was not going for you? The enemy was just playing around?”

“Haha, must you really wait for the sword to pierce your heart before you admit the enemy was going for you?”

“Clan elder Hei Qi, the logic is clear even to a three-year-old. An Emperor God expert like you, the leader of a clan can’t even understand it? You dare say you’re not foolish?”

Jian Wushuang showed no restraint.

It was a clear insult, and in front of so many tribe leaders.

The Black Bone Clan leader Hei Qi was trembling in anger and shame, his teeth clenched tightly, unconsciously looking towards Ba Su seating in front of the hall.

The Sky Swallowing Clan leader Ba Su had to give him a stern glance before Hei Qi could suppress his anger. He sat down once again.

“Hngh.”

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang snorted in contempt, his glanced now on Ba Su.

He realised that the Sky Swallowing Clan leader was very calm about what had happened, sitting there without muttering a word.

“This Sky Swallower got the Black Bone Clan to stand up for him, what exactly does he want?” Jian Wushuang muttered.

In the main hall, all the experts and leaders witnessed the scolding of Hei Qi. The scolding was coarse, but it made sense.”

Another figure stood up.

It was another clan leader, whose abilities were not any lesser than the Black Bone Clan’s. But what was different was that this clan resided within the Ancient God Sanctuary, and followed the Ancient God Clan faithfully.

“O’ Ancient Emperor, I think we all understand what you mean. The Black Millstone was obviously made to destroy the entire Eternal Chaotic World, not just the human domains. Thankfully the experts from the Sanctuary Alliance were able to stop it. Consequences would be dire if it had not happened.”

“Therefore, if we special tribes don’t form an alliance with the human Sanctuary Alliance, once the Three Emperors Word destroys the Sanctuary Alliance, we special tribes will certainly be their next target!”
