Chapter 511: Twelve Levels of Bone Fusion!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Only human experts from plane worlds outside of the Monster Continent would not have come into contact with a Body Reshaping Technique until now,” Qing Huo said.

Jian Wushuang was speechless at first, but he directly admitted, “Yes, I did come from somewhere outside of the Monster Continent.”

“Just as I thought.”

Qing Huo looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile and said, “Wushuang, my friend, don’t worry. Human Warriors on the Monster Continent only hate Demonic Beasts. We won’t refuse human experts from other plane worlds. They can even serve as Divine Generals and Divine Emperors in the Monster-exterminating League. All human experts are welcome in the Monster-exterminating League.”

“Oh?”Jian Wushuang was surprised and asked, “Are there experts from other plane worlds who are Divine Generals and Divine Emperors in the Monster-exterminating League?”

“Yes.” Qing Huo said, “Those experts aim for the League’s Holy Place. If they want to obtain benefits from the Holy Place, they have to make corresponding contributions to the League, which includes killing Demonic Beasts. That’s why they serve as Divine Generals or Divine Emperors.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang secretly nodded.

“Wushuang, aren’t you also aiming for the Holy Place?” Qing Huo asked in doubts.

“I came here by accident. But, now I’m quite interested in the League’s Holy Place,” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

“The Holy Place is open to all human experts. But you have to become a Divine General of the League first,” Qing Huo looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile and said, “Even though you’re only in the Saint Realm, you’re stronger than me and definitely qualified to become a Divine General.”

“May I ask what the requirements are?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s very simple. As long as you are strong enough to pass the assessment, it won’t be a problem for you,” Qing Huo laughed. “I’ll be staying in the tribe for a month. If you’re not in a hurry, you can wait and go with me when I leave. How about it?”

“Thank you, Mr. Qing Huo,” Jian Wushuang said.

He had only just arrived on the Monster Continent recently and had very little knowledge regarding anything here. It would be better if he could obtain some information from Qing Huo.

“By the way,” Qing Huo said, “I saw how easily you cultivated the Fourth Level of the Bone Fusion Technique. I guess it won’t be difficult for you to cultivate the Fifth or Sixth Level. I brought them back with me this time. Do you want to read them?”

Qing Huo took out two Jade Slips.

They had the Fifth and Sixth Level of the Bone Fusion Technique recorded on them.

Seeing the Jade Slips, a happy expression appeared on Jian Wushuang’s face.

After having contact with the Bone Fusion Technique, Jian Wushuang was extremely eager to continue practicing it. It had an immeasurable effect on his physical strength. With just the initial four levels, his strength had already soared to a level several times higher, and his strong body made him qualified to cultivate higher levels of the Bone Fusion Technique.

He definitely yearned for the Fifth and Sixth Levels of the Bone Fusion Technique.

“Thank you so much, Mr. Qing Huo,” Jian Wushuang said gratefully.

“Since we’re both human beings, there is no need to be so polite,” Qing Huo said and smiled. “By the way, don’t call me Mr. Qing Huo. You’re even stronger than me, so just call me Qing Huo.”

Jian Wushuang responded with a smile.

He had discovered that Qing Huo and Wu Yuan, as well as all the clansmen in the Wu Yan Tribe, hated the Demonic Beasts, but they were very friendly and enthusiastic to other human beings and treated them like brothers.

“Qing Huo, do you know who created the Bone Fusion Technique and how many levels there are?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I don’t know who created it. No one seems to know. I only know that it has been spread throughout the Monster Continent since long ago. More than 90 percent of the Human Warriors on the continent cultivate it to improve their physical strength. As for its levels...”

“As far as I know, the Bone Fusion Technique is divided into three volumes and each volume contains four levels, so there are 12 levels altogether,” Qing Huo said.

“12 levels?” Jian Wushuang was shocked. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The initial four levels of the Bone Fusion Technique had already benefited him greatly, but there were a total of 12 levels!

How strong of a body would he attain after cultivating all 12 levels?

“However, it’s impossible to cultivate all 12 levels. Or, at least, no human on the Monster Continent has ever succeeded. Even the strongest person has only cultivated the 11th level and is regarded as the Top Human Warrior.”

“Only a few Human Warriors have cultivated the Tenth Level in the history of Monster Continent,” Qing Huo said.

Jian Wushuang was not surprised to hear it.

The more powerful the technique was, the more difficult it was to cultivate. The Bone Fusion Technique was definitely an incredible one and had high requirements on the body’s foundation. It was naturally difficult to cultivate all 12 levels.

“I have another technique which should also be useful to you,” Qing Huo said while taking out another Jade Slip.

“This is...?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

“This is a technique dedicated to concealing one’s aura,” Qing Huo explained.

“Aura-concealing Technique,” Jian Wushuang’s face changed slightly as he quickly understood.

“I obtained this technique by chance. It can completely conceal a Warrior’s Spiritual Power aura. No one will know your strength unless he’s much stronger than you.” Qing Huo said, “After all, you’re only at the Saint Realm. It’ll be too noticeable if you participate in the Divine General assessment like this. With this technique, no one will know your Realm.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang slightly nodded.

Divine Generals in the Monster-exterminating League were usually Cloud Realm experts. It would indeed be noticeable if he became a Divine General as a Saint Realm expert.

“Thank you so much,” Jian Wushuang expressed his gratitude again.

“You have a month to prepare. After that, we’ll set off,” Qing Huo said and then laughed.

Jian Wushuang nodded, then he shared several drinks with Qing Huo while asking him questions about the Monster Continent.

He stayed there until dusk.
