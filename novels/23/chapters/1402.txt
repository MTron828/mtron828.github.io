Chapter 1403: First Battle!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In boundless Milky Way, Hall Master Yuan and his fellow deacon elderlies were chatting casually.

“Lu Han is so stupid!”

“Who does he think he is? He thought that he was Ling Feibai? He’s just an ordinary disciple. How dare he be in doubt of the result that Hall Master Yuan and us deacon elderlies agreed upon?”

“Humph. He thought Jian Wushuang didn’t stay in Supreme Tower as long as he did and assumed that Jian Wushuang couldn’t be stronger than him. What a joke.”

“Whoever stayed longer in Supreme Tower is stronger? Ridiculous!”

The deacon elderlies saw clearly how long Jian Wushuang had stayed in Supreme Tower earlier.

They were sure that Jian Wushuang was definitely stronger than Lu Han, and by a considerable amount.

“The reason Jian Wushuang only stayed in Supreme Tower for seventeen breaths was that the opponent that he was fighting against was a war puppet. An expert who is good at consciousness attack fights against war puppets won’t have any conscious. Jian Wushuang was at great at disadvantage but, even so, he stayed for seventeen breaths.”

“Plus, if I’m not mistaken, Jian Wushuang only used the consciousness manipulation method in Supreme Tower and didn’t perform any consciousness secret skills or anything. He didn’t even use any Swords Principles. His power should not have to be put to play entirely.”

“If he were to give his all, even if he was at a great disadvantage as he fought against a war puppet, he should be able to persist for a longer time.”

A deacon elderly in a gold robe casually commented.

“Mm, look. Jian Wushuang is going to take action.”

Hall Master Yuan and the other deacon elderlies looked towards Titanic Star.

…

On Titanic Star, the rotation battle had begun.

Similarly to the rotation battle among Universe God in the First Heaven, the ten disciples took turns to fight against one another. Everyone had to fight nine battles.

The very first battle was between Jian Wushuang and Luo Quan.

When the deacon elderly on Titanic Star announced the two of them for the first battle, it stirred a commotion on Titanic Star in that instant.

One opponent was Jian Wushuang, who had been a controversial person for the past eight hundred years. Especially as everyone was still in doubt of his power, he immediately had to take action.

The other one was publicly known as the strongest ordinary disciple among Universe Gods in the Second Heaven.

Plus, it so happened that the first person that Jian Wushuang had lost to after he had got to Lineage of Star was Luo Quan.

The two of them were enemies to begin with.

Before everyone’s gaze, Jian Wushuang walked to the middle of Titanic Star slowly.

Just as Luo Quan was going to walk forward, Qu Yang, who was behind him, reminded him softly, “Luo Quan, be careful. Don’t belittle him, especially be careful of his consciousness attack.”

“Consciousness attack?” Luo Quan was stunned but suddenly sneered, “I fought with him eight hundred years ago. He used consciousness attacks then too. It didn’t affect me at all. Even if he did improve tremendously over the past eight hundred years, he was so far behind me it won’t matter even now.”

Luo Quan sneered as he walked to the middle of Titanic Star. He stood opposite Jian Wushuang, a large distance away.

The moment Luo Quan appeared on the battlefield, his face grew cold and he put his guard up.

It was clear that Hall Master Yuan and the deacon elderlies were in agreement that Jian Wushuang was stronger than Lu Han, so it must be true. This point alone showed that Jian Wushuang was not that weak.

“Although Lu Han wasn’t very strong, I’d need to put in time and effort to defeat him. Jian Wushuang is definitely stronger than Lu Han. I can’t be careless. I must give my all from the very beginning. Otherwise, I might miss the quota to become a disciple of Star Palace,” Luo Quan licked his lips as he fixed his gaze on Jian Wushuang.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang was looking at Luo Quan while he sent a message.

“Qiu Yue, are all of you here yet?

“Yes, Mister. All the maid and servants on Sword Star are watching at the border of Titanic Star,” Qiu Yue replied.

“Alright. Watch the next scene. Don’t miss it,” Jian Wushuang sounded calm. After he sent the message, he spoke, “Luo Quan, you once said that my property as a disciple of Star palace, my Sword Star, including the maids and servants under my command would become yours after this battle. Now, I am standing before you. Defeat me and you will naturally get everything that you wanted.”

“Humph, you think I can’t?” Luo Quan sneered, “Eight hundred years ago, you were once defeated by me. This time, you’ll be decimated!”

The moment Luo Quan said that, he suddenly charged forward like a raging beast.

He was wearing a pair of crimson gloves on his hand and they were giving out a bold scarlet light.

Suddenly, Luo Quan appeared before Jian Wushuang. There was an ancient roar reverberating as his right hand curled into a fist and transformed into a ferocious beast. It was plunging at Jian Wushuang with a terrifying force.

Looking at the attack that Luo Quan had pulled, the surrounding disciples looked shocked.

“Jian Wushuang still isn’t taking action?”

“What is he doing standing there? Hurry up and block the attack!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The disciples started panicking on behalf of Jian Wushuang, but he didn’t even move an inch. It was almost as though he was scared stiff.

However, just as the beast transformed from the crimson fist descending on Jian Wushuang, he suddenly lifted his head and there was an intense crimson light that erupted.

The crimson light was just like a scarlet sun. It was blinding, yet eye-catching.

Everyone couldn’t help but be attracted by the scarlet sun and Luo Quan was the first to bear the brunt of it.

It was a consciousness attack secret skill by Real God Demonic Rain on Real God ranking list, Eighteen Asura Hell, which was performed by Jian Wushuang who possessed Soul Power that was at the level of Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven.

“Ahh!!!”

A shrill scream was heard across Titanic Star.

The ferocious beast that had transformed from the fist dispersed straight away, but left Luo Quan alone, bellowing like a mad man.

His face was distorted and red with agony. The veins on his forehead and arms popped, he looked ferocious. His eyes were bloodshot too.

He waved his hands desperately as an enormous amount of divine power splashed out, but it didn’t reach Jian Wushuang at all. He continued to bellow.

“No! No!!”

“Stop, quick stop!!”

“Ahh!!! Hurry up and stop!!!”

The entire Titanic Star and the entire boundless Milky Way were shaken by the shrill, mad bellow.

The surrounding disciples on Titanic Star were shocked at the sight.

“He… what happened to him?”
