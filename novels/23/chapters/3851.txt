Chapter 3856: Another Battle With Sky Master

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Outside the Demon Palace, Jian Wushuang was waiting quietly.

Suddenly, a figure rushed out of the Demon Palace and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“You are…Sky Master?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Blood Sword Master, long time no see.” Sky Master smiled indifferently.

“You actually joined the Ancient Night Demon Palace?” Jian Wushuang’s expression was strange.

“Of course. A wise man submits to circumstances. The Demon Monarch’s demonic might is unrivaled. No one in this Star Field can resist him. Why is it strange that I joined the Demon Monarch’s Army?

“Moreover, I’ve benefited a lot from the Demon Monarch’s army over the years. Now, I’m the first general under the Demon Monarch’s command.”

“Blood Sword Master, you’re very talented, but no one can guide you in this Star Field. So You’re still just a Principles Master. Why Don’t you join Demon Monarch and become a great general under Demon Monarch like me? If Demon Monarch gives you some advice, maybe you’ll break through to become a Ruler. In the future, we’ll fight in the universe together with Demon Monarch. Wouldn’t that be great?” Sky Master said.

“Become a general under Demon Monarch Ancient Night?” Jian Wushuang asked with a strange look on his face, “Sky Master, I don’t like to live under someone else’s roof like you do. As a Ruler, I will naturally break through slowly. I don’t want to worry about your Ruler. I came to visit Demon Monarch Ancient Night today because I have something to discuss with him.”

“Something to discuss? It should be about your Star Palace, right?” Sky Master looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Haha, your Star Palace dares to disrespect and humiliate our Ancient Night Demon Palace’s Ruler, Death Ruler. The Demon Monarch already knows about this and is quite angry. He is ready to destroy your Star Palace. It’s too late for you to beg for mercy now.”

“Of course, if you become a general under the Demon Monarch, the Demon Monarch will forgive you for your previous offense. Your Star Palace can even rise in this Star Field in the future. What do you think?” Sky Master continued to invite him.

“Sky Master, I said I’m not interested in that general. I’m too lazy to talk to you. You’d better go and tell your Demon Monarch to come out,” Jian Wushuang said coldly with his hands behind his back.

“If you refuse a toast, you’ll be forced to drink a forfeit. In that case, I can only capture you to see the Demon Monarch.” Sky Master’s voice was cold, and a strong divine power swept out from his body.

In the next moment, Sky Master attacked directly.

Sky Master flipped his palm, and a red-gold hammer appeared in his hand. The power of this hammer soared to the sky. It was the most powerful supreme treasure in terms of attack.

Buzz!

The void shook slightly, and Sky Master’s red-gold hammer turned into red-gold lightning and smashed toward Jian Wushuang at a terrifying speed across the void.

The red-gold lightning was extremely fast and powerful.

“The Sky Master seems to be stronger than before.” Jian Wushuang frowned. As soon as he saw the red-gold lightning, he could tell that the Sky Master was much more powerful than when he fought with him in the Red Cloud World, he was much stronger.

Of course, he was no longer comparable to the Red Cloud World when it was born.

Jian Wushuang struck out with his sword. The Netherworld Divine Sword turned into a pitch-black shadow and slashed out casually.

It was indeed a casual strike, but the sword skill contained the universe origin of sword principle, which was extremely rich.

Bang!

A low collision sound was heard, and the Sky Master’s arm slightly sank.

“What?” The Sky Master was stunned.

However, Jian Wushuang struck out again and again, each strike was casual and plain.

However, the sword shadows were so fast that Sky Master could not resist them with all his strength. Even if he tried to resist, it would be very difficult.

“How is this possible?

“How can his swordsmanship be so amazing? and the power contained in it…his divine power is not very strong, but when he uses his swordsmanship, his strength completely surpasses my sledgehammer.” Sky Master looked incredulous.

When they fought in the Red Cloud World last time, he was not as strong as he was now, but he could still easily suppress Jian Wushuang, except that he could not kill him.

But now, when they fought again, he was obviously stronger, but when they fought, he was completely suppressed?

“Demon King told me to be careful and not to kill him, but in this situation, how can I be careful?” Sky Master’s eyes flashed with a fierce light. “I can’t care about that anymore.”

Sky Master suddenly roared, and a cold light suddenly lit up between his eyebrows.

The light directly merged with the surface of Sky Master’s divine body, and his aura suddenly increased. The power of his red-gold hammer also increased greatly.

Boom!

The red-gold hammer crashed down, and for a moment, it seemed as if the entire world was pressing down.

“Second-level battle strength?”

A trace of surprise flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

The last time Sky Master fought with him, he was only an ordinary Superior Ruler of the first-level. But now, when they fought again, his battle strength was obviously among the Superior Rulers, which was extremely terrifying, and now, he even displayed an attack power comparable to that of a second-level Ruler.

“It seems that he has benefited a lot from being under Demon Monarch Ancient Night.” Jian Wushuang nodded secretly. Then, he moved his body and made a simple dash, and the Netherworld Divine Sword also made a simple stab. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

His divine power did not increase, but the sword principle universe origin contained in his swordsmanship was suddenly several times stronger than before.

Clang!

The Netherworld Divine Sword directly collided with the Golden Hammer.

The hammer looked extremely heavy and powerful. Compared to the hammer, Jian Wushuang’s Netherworld Divine Sword looked very thin and weak.

However, Jian Wushuang’s Netherworld Divine Sword did not move at all. Instead, the golden hammer in Sky Master’s hand was thrown away.

Even though the divine weapon in his hand was thrown away, the power of Jian Wushuang’s Netherworld Divine Sword was not completely exhausted. It still pierced into Sky Master’s divine body. Sky Master’s body shook violently, and his aura was instantly weakened.

“How is this possible?”

Sky Master regained his balance and looked up at Jian Wushuang with a face full of disbelief.

“Is it possible?”

The last time they met, he could easily suppress Jian Wushuang. But now, in the blink of an eye, his strength had increased with the help of Demon Monarch Ancient Night, and he was easily defeated by his opponent?

How could this Blood Sword Master be so heaven-defying?

Jian Wushuang did not feel proud that he had defeated Sky Master.

For him, it was difficult for a master like Sky Master to attract his attention.

“Demon Monarch Ancient Night, you’ve been watching for so long. It’s time for you to show yourself,” Jian Wushuang suddenly said, his voice echoing throughout the entire demon palace.
