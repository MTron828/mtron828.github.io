Jian Wushuang sat across from Su Rou in the front courtyard of his residence.

“Brother, thank you for that.” Su Rou said.

“You’re welcome. Besides, if I didn’t get you in trouble with the Blood Asura Clan, Lin Li wouldn’t have been compelled to target you.” Jian Wushuang replied smilingly.

“Humph, Lin Li… She held me in humble reverence when master was here, but ever since Master left, she has been making things difficult for me in all respects. I wasn’t strong enough or confident enough to offend her openly. However, with your help today, the Asura Guards are now in my hands, and with my significant increase in power, she’s not going to make any more trouble.” Su Rou said with confidence.

Jiang Wushuang saw a spark of ruthlessness in her eyes as she spoke.

“Sister, you’ve grown a lot over the years.” Jian Wushuang proudly answered with a smile.

He still remembered when he met Su Rou in the Ancient World. Back then, she was a shy little girl who was afraid to talk to strangers.

But now, her aura of her confidence filled the courtyard.

“Everyone has to grow up, but regardless of what changes, our relationship will always be the same.” Su Rou said solemnly.

“That’s good.” Jian Wushuang answered, grinning. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Oh, Brother. You had asked me to check the whereabouts of your mother in the Ancient Demon Clan, and I sent someone to investigate. Not long ago, he returned a message with some information.” Su Rou said.

“Information?” Jian Wushuang looked anxious.

“Yes, but it hasn’t been confirmed yet. I think he will send me more exact information in a few days.” Su Rou replied.

“Okay, as long as there is news.” Jian Wushuang replied. He couldn’t help but clench his hands, at the expectations that were stirring deep within his heart.

In anticipation of more information from Su Rou, Jian Wushen continued his stay in the Blood Asura Clan, filling his time with meditation on the Sword Principle.

Hundreds of miles away…

There was an isolated mountain in the Divine Monster Territory.

The mountain was enormous, but otherwise seemed to be completely normal at first glance. Even common Dao Masters flying over might fail to detect anything out of the ordinary. However, masters who were skilled in Formation would undoubtedly realize its power.

The mountain was encircled in a huge Psychedelic Formation.

And inside it lay a smattering of palaces.

This was the Samsara Temple, known as the most important branch in the Divine Monster Territory.

At present, a bright light shone from the center a huge wormhole in the middle of the temple, followed by a figure.

The figure who walked out was a handsome man dressed in a simple indigo-robe. He had a little stubble and silvery long hair flowed over his shoulder. He was somewhat haggard, but his eyes still managed to be striking.

They were as dark as gems and seemed to hold the endless Void.

There was no aura surrounding him, causing him to look quite ordinary. But with a closer look, every move he made caused a ripple in the world around him.

As he appeared, many experts in the temple rushed over.

Dozens of them were experts who held high positions in the temple, and the rest also held positions of influence.

Among them were ten Gold-clothed Deacons and there were even two Inner Elders who were strong enough to be Reincarnators of Rank Eight.

These experts looked to the indigo-robed man with reverence and awe before greeting him together.

“Greetings, Your Highness.”

The indigo-robed man nodded with indifference and continued on into one of the towering palaces around them.

Inside the palace, he sat on the largest throne, with the Inner Elders and Gold-clothed Deacons standing below him, respectfully. Occasionally, some of them would glance at him with admiration in their eyes.

They all knew the greatness of the man in front of them.

In the past one thousand years, he actions had created one myth after another, each of which thrilled everyone present.

Sitting on the throne, the indigo-robed man was thumbed through some papers.

The papers held records of the events of the Divine Monster Territory in recent years, the most detailed of which contained what befell the Ancient Demon Clan.

“Hmm?”

The indigo-robed man’s expression shifted as he read about how the Ancient Demon Clan worked with the Patriarch of Empyrean Glory to hunt down Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang?”

A strange expression appeared on his face before he demanded, “Bring me all the files on Jian Wushuang.”

“Yes.” One of the Inner Elders answered and was gone for just a moment before he returned with more papers.

Jiang Wushuang had stirred up the Samsara Continent, and his talent and strength were things to behold. The Samsara Temple had investigated him thoroughly already and kept the subsequent files on hand.

As he read the files on Jian Wushuang, the corners of the indigo-robed man’s mouth turned up.

“It was him…

“The Ancient Demon Clan and the Patriarch of Empyrean Glory failed to hurt him even when they worked together. Even better, he survived three attacks from the Patriarch. Well, that’s impressive.

“This is perfect timing for my next action; it would be great if he could lend a hand.

“The Ancient Demon Clan! Humph!”

He sneered, but then turned serious. He waved his hand, pulling out a gilded letter.

“Go and send this letter to all the populations in the Divine Monster Territory, all the lone warriors, and anyone who has the ability to fight as fast as possible.” He ordered in a loud voice.

Below him, one Inner Elder took this letter immediately. As he opened the letter and read, his pupils dilated.

“The… the inauguration ceremony for New Supervisor?”

Everyone in the palace gasped at his words. Shocked, they all looked to the indigo-robed man.

They knew what great power the Supervisor of the Samsara Temple held, and the extent of the abilities needed to claim the title.

The indigo-robed man in front of them would be the new Supervisor? So soon?
