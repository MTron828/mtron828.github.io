Chapter 741: Dedicated Meditation

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang was quietly meditating on the Secret Skill in front of the three stone tablets.

The Star-river Secret Skill consisted of 34 levels. It was easy to reach the elementary levels. Even the clansmen who had not awakened the bloodline were able to master Level One or Level Two.

However, the further they went, the harder it became. In the entire clan, few had been able to reach Level 20.

As for the Scarlet Eye Secret Skill and the Mind-controlling Secret Skill, it was difficult for the Ancient Gods to meet the requirements.

Some powerful clansmen, and even some Gold-armored Ancient Gods, would spend 10 years or even 100 years meditating on the two skills if they wanted to reach Level One.

Jian Wushuang possessed the Imperial Bloodline. If he had remained a Skyscraping Realm expert who had the highest understanding, it would have been easier for him to meditate on the two skills, but now, he was a Divine Realm expert, whose understanding was weaker.

It took him five years to start getting the hang of the Scarlet Eye Secret Skill.

Then he spent eight years reaching the elementary levels of the Mind-controlling Secret Skill.

And as for the Star-river Secret Skill, it only took him half a month to master Level 10.

In the Ancient God Clan, One-star Ancient Gods were only able to reach Level 10 of the Star-river Secret Skill.

After keeping the Three Secret Skills manuals in his mind, Jian Wushuang decided to leave.

“Jian Wushuang.”

The moment he stepped out of the black pavilion, Jian Wushuang immediately saw Elder Yi sitting on the ground. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Elder Yi.” Jian Wushuang bowed to the elder.

“How’s it going with the Three Secret Skills?” Elder Yi asked.

“Not bad. I’ve reached Level 10 of the Star-river Secret Skill and elementary levels of the other two skills,” Jian Wushuang replied honestly.

“What? So fast?” Elder Yi was astonished, but soon calmed himself. Then, he said with a smile, “You’re worthy of possessing the Imperial Bloodline. Your understanding is excellent.”

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang smiled. But actually, he was not satisfied with his achievements.

His talents in comprehension became weaker than before after he reached the Deification Realm.

If he had been in the Skyscraping Realm, he would have only spent three years on the two last Secret Skills.

“As for how to use the three skills, you can ask some Ancient Gods in the Ancient God Palace. They’ll help you,” Elder Yi added.

“OK.” Jian Wushuang nodded. He had planed to stay in the Ancient God Palace.

“I have lived in the Eternal Zone for more than 90 years. In seven years, this zone will open again, then I’ll leave for the Firmament Territory. So, I can stay in the Ancient God Palace to enhance my strength until then.”?Jian Wushuang made up his mind.

He would live in the Ancient God Palace for seven years.

There were numerous powerful clansmen in the Ancient God Palace. Although Jian Wushuang was unable to fight against them, he was raring to go.

The clansmen of the Ancient God Clan were born militant, as was Jian Wushuang.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang started to challenge his clansmen.

…

Time flew by in the Eternal Zone.

During that period of time, he had fought many clansmen in the Ancient God Palace.

Although he rarely won the fights, Jian Wushuang had never lost heart and kept challenging more clansmen. He also gained a lot from his abject failures.

Seven years passed by.

On the top floor of a towering pagoda, Jian Wushuang quietly sat cross-legged under an ancient copper bell, with his eyes closed and a faint smile on his face.

He suddenly shook, and a surge of overwhelming aura radiated out.

“Star-river Secret Skill, Level 11 is complete!” Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, which shone with excitement.

He had reached Level 10 seven years ago and improved his offensive power by 30 times.

He had been practicing the Star-river Secret Skill over the past seven years. Now, he finally made it to Level 11 and gained another threefold increase.

The Star-river Secret Skill was restricted to Ancient Gods’ Realm.

When Jian Wushuang was a Skyscraping Realm expert before he had awakened his bloodline, he was capable of mastering the first three levels of this skill. As for his clansmen, who had not become One-star Ancient Gods, they could reach Level Three at the most.

Level 10 of the Star-river Secret Skill would be the limit for the One-star Ancient Gods.

The strongest One-star Ancient Gods, even the Gold-armored Ancient Gods, could only reach Level 10. No one had made it to Level 11.

However, Jian Wushuang succeeded.

This was the particularity of the Deification Realm.

His strength was limitless in that realm.

Therefore, he was able to reach Level 11.

He would progress to Level 12 or 13, as he had great potential.

“Jian Wushuang.”

A bold voice was heard before a bald man glided in from afar.

Jian Wushuang addressed him. “Gu Heng.”

The bald man was named Gu Heng, who was a powerful Two-star Ancient God. Although he was a Silver-armored Ancient God, few Gold-armored Ancient Gods could match him.

Jian Wushuang had sparred with him more than once, but he had suffered a crushing defeat every time.

“Time is up. Elder Yi asked me to tell you that the outsiders are about to arrive,” Gu Heng said.

“Finally, it’s time for me to show up!”

Jian Wushuang raised his head, his eyes shining with killing intent.
