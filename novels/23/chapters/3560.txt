Chapter 3561: Special Time and Space

After passing through the crack in the precipice, Jian Wushuang had completely stepped into the unknown region.

What entered his eyes was still a dark and boundless land, with a faint black smoke floating in the void. It did not look much different from other places.

In fact, from the moment Jian Wushuang set foot in the unexplored area, he knew nothing except for a route marked on the star map from Xue Bei.

As the saying went, the unknown was dangerous. The areas explored in the Devil Smoke Valley had many dangerous places, such as the Corpse Cave, the Death Hurricane Eye, and the Devil Flame Land, all of which were famous for their savagery, even a Ruler Realm expert would have a slim chance of survival if he stepped into them.

However, although these places were dangerous, they were known areas after all. The experts from various star worlds and forces knew that they would definitely die if they entered these places, so they naturally avoided them from afar, they would not step into them at all.

However, the unknown areas were completely different. There was no way to know where the danger was. In other words, if you simply rushed forward, you would unknowingly step into some certain death places.

“This unknown region is too dangerous. I must completely follow the path Xue Bei pointed out. I must not deviate. Once I deviate, I may encounter unknown dangers.” Jian Wushuang’s expression was solemn.

After entering the unknown region, his nerves were completely tensed and he became fully alert.

Under this full alert, he also followed the path Xue Bei pointed out and slowly moved forward.

His speed was very slow, even slower than the speed of an ordinary Principles Master. There was nothing he could do, because although Xue Bei had left a route, it was only a rough direction, there was no complete star map, so he naturally had to carefully find the right direction to move forward.

If he did not pay attention to the direction while moving forward, even if it was just a small deviation, it could make him completely lost.

Fortunately, Jian Wushuang was careful and achieved results. After a long ten years, he finally came to a dark abyss.

“The dark abyss is here.”

Jian Wushuang stood in the void and looked down at the abyss.

The abyss was pitch-black and bottomless, but if one looked carefully, they would find a slowly flowing dark vortex in the center of the abyss.

The dark vortex was not big and its color was not deep. It was difficult to find it in the surrounding darkness.

Master Xue Bei had come here by chance and stayed for a period of time before he discovered the existence of the dark vortex.

What Jian Wushuang was looking for was this dark vortex.

“According to what Xue Bei said, this dark vortex is the passage to enter that special space-time.” Jian Wushuang’s face was solemn. He stared at the dark vortex in the abyss, took a deep breath, and then jumped down.

Whoosh!

Ear-piercing air-piercing sounds continued to ring out. Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold as he fixed his gaze on the dark vortex. After a while, he directly flew into the dark vortex.

When Jian Wushuang flew into the dark vortex, it was like a drop of water dropping into the sea. There was no fluctuation from the dark vortex, and the dark vortex was still slowly rotating in the middle of the abyss, as always, it was the same.

...

After entering the dark vortex, Jian Wushuang came to the special space-time.

It was a gray void, vast and boundless. There was no light, and there was no sky or earth.

There was only a void.

As Jian Wushuang stood there, he immediately sensed the difference between this space-time and the outside world.

“It’s just as Xue Bei said. I can’t sense the power of space-time at all here, and my connection with the outside world will be completely cut off.” Jian Wushuang looked around and tried to contact the people outside, but there was no response.

“A completely independent space-time is completely different from the outside world,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

Not only that, but Jian Wushuang also sensed an extremely obscure crisis in this space-time.

This sense of crisis had been present since he stepped into this space-time, which was also mentioned by Xue Bei in the star map.

“According to Xue Bei, after he entered this space-time, he immediately felt a sense of danger. As he continued to move forward, the sense of danger grew stronger. Later, he vaguely saw a floating platform, but because he saw that platform, the sense of danger in his heart rose to the extreme, as if he would die at the next moment. Therefore, he didn’t have time to see what was on the platform before he turned around and left.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Xue Bei had indeed paved the way for him, but this path only led to the high platform. As for what happened next, Xue Bei did not know.

“When I came to the core area of Devil Smoke Valley and entered this special space, I had the battle strength of the peak of the fifth realm. He didn’t even see what was on the high platform and left in fear. But now, my strength is much higher than Xue Bei’s, and my life-saving ability is much stronger than his. I should be able to see more things in this special space than him,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

In the next moment, Jian Wushuang slowly moved forward.

As Xue Bei had said, as Jian Wushuang slowly moved forward, the sense of crisis in his heart grew stronger.

However, this level of crisis naturally did not scare Jian Wushuang. He continued to move forward as usual.

In the gray void, Jian Wushuang did not know how far he had walked or how long he had walked. He only knew that the sense of crisis in his heart was growing stronger, and he was getting closer and closer to the high platform.

But at this moment...

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly changed.

He saw a golden light in the gray void in front of him.

Yes, it was a golden light.

Although the golden light was dim and not as dazzling, it was still very eye-catching in the gray void.

“What is that golden light?”

With a trace of curiosity, Jian Wushuang rushed toward the golden light.

However, when he approached the golden light and finally saw it clearly, he was stunned.

The golden light was nothing else but a golden long spear!

“A long spear?”

“There is such a spear floating in this special space and time?”

Jian Wushuang frowned and walked to the side of the golden long spear. After carefully observing the golden long spear, he reached out his hand and grabbed it.
