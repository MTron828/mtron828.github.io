Chapter 2144 Frenzied Ba Su

“Jian Wushuang, give me your life!”Hong!

Ba Su made his move.

The enormous distance between the duo was instantly closed by Ba Su.

Ba Su appeared in front of Jian Wushuang with overflowing golden light all over him, looking like a god.

Soon, Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua!

Streaks and streaks of golden claws came down like lightning.

Every single golden claw could tear heaven apart.

Every streak could have easily wounded a First Stage Great Emperor, or even killed him.

The claws came one after another, turning the sky golden.

“Hngh!” Jian Wushuang snorted, and with a unique sword move, he turned into a heaven-swallowing black whirlpool.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo, Mixed Elements Spirit.

Qiang! Qiang! Qiang! Qiang! Qiang! Qiang!

Sounds of collision could be repeatedly heard, each sound containing terrifying explosive power.

As the golden claws came down like rain, Jian Wushuang found himself retreating.

“You won’t parry my attacks?”

“Counter, Jian Wushuang, counter!” Ba Su had turned mad – his claws never stopped.

And they were getting faster, and more powerful.

Ba Su was already equipped with pinnacle Second Stage fighting powers with his Sky Swallowing Clan Bloodline. With the Three Emperors World’s opportunity, he had managed to master a bit of the Rules of Order, which increased his abilities tremendously.

His claws, in terms of speed or power, were way more powerful than they had been in the past.

Because of this, he had absolute confidence in his power.

He knew Jian Wushuang would never match up to him again.

Sure enough, he had completely suppressed Jian Wushuang from the beginning. The speed he threw his Golden Claws with were amazing, Jian Wushuang could only defend.

“Haha, useless! Good-for-nothing!” Ba Su laughed wildly. The craze in his eyes was evident.

But the craze only lasted for a moment. He realised something was wrong.

“How could this be? My claws are getting faster and more powerful with every blow. He could only resist in the beginning, it should be more difficult for him to resist later. But why has nothing changed?” Ba Su looked at Jian Wushuang in amazement.

He knew that if Jian Wushuang was really struggling to resist his attack, it would surely become more difficult to resist as his power increased.

This difficulty would definitely manifest during the fierce battle.

But in the end… although Jian Wushuang had been retreating the entire time, and it looked like he was being suppressed, nothing has changed since.

What could this mean?

It meant that when Jian Wushuang resisted his attack, it was not as strenuous as he had imagined, or was it too easy for him?

Sure enough…

“Hngh!”

A cold snort resonated through the Void.

Jian Wushuang, who had been defending Ba Su’s attacks with his Mixed Elements Spirit swordsmanship, suddenly took the offensive.

Mixed Elements Spirit swordsmanship instantly turned into the Sanguis Extremus style.

Peng!

The sword light had cut down the oncoming Golden Claw, the power released from the collision was enough to throw Ba Su back.

Jian Wushuang stood there, looking indifferently at the re-composed Ba Su.

“This is the power you were proud of? With this power, you want to take me down?” There was disdain in his eyes, and his voice echoed through the heavens.

“How is that possible?” Ba Su widened his eyes and stared at Jian Wushuang.

It felt impossible, but Jian Wushuang had easily throw Ba Su back.

“Idiot, you think everyone needs to sacrifice a million years of their freedom to reach Third Stage Great Emperor fighting powers?” Jian Wushuang sneered.

“You… you reached the Third Stage as well?” Ba Su looked stunned.

Ba Su had rushed towards the Imperial City upon Demon King Chen Yu’s message and had not paid much thought to Jian Wushuang’s fighting power. Even when he had arrived, he did not notice Jian Wushuang’s true fighting power when he was going against the thirteen Great Emperors.

Even though he had confronted Jian Wushuang once at the beginning, Jian Wushuang had not demonstrated his true power then. He would never have imagined Jian Wushuang to possess that kind of power. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

But now… he had finally realised.

“Fool, you dare call me useless? I’m afraid calling you useless would do the word a disservice,” Jian Wushuang looked at Ba Su, full of ridicule.

He had never intended to use his full strength against Ba Su. He simply wanted to know how far Ba Su had improved in mastering a bit of Rules of Order.

The results were disappointing.

“I thought that with his previous fighting power, coupled with the Sky Swallowing Clan Bloodline power, with the Rules of Order he would be tyrannical amongst the Third Stages. Not only did he fail to master the complete Rules of Order, but the power he can use from it is negligible!”

“Although this leaves him with Third Stage fighting power, it’s nothing compared to Demon King Chen Yu,” Jian Wushuang sneered.

Jian Wushuang’s contempt and ridicule made Ba Su even angrier.

“You have a death wish!” !! Ba Su’s eyes seemed to spit fire.

At the same time, his body started to transform into a giant golden bat.

The golden bat had his golden eyes fixed on Jian Wushuang.

“Li!” An eye-piercing, hissing voice echoed.

At the same time, the surface of Ba Su’s body emitted a strong golden light, like a dazzling golden sun.

“This move again?” Jian Wushuang was indifferent.

“Wrong, it’s not only the Sky Swallowing Clan’s soul attack, but there is also a powerful secret skill embedded within it as well. Maybe a soul attack treasure as well,” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He had seen Ba Su play that trick several times.

Every time Ba Su made his move, it was a simple Soul Attack. But now, there was an embedded secret skill, along with an auxiliary Soul Attack treasure.

His Soul Attack power had naturally soared.

“It seems that he’s gained more than simple opportunities within the Three Emperors World,” Jian Wushuang mumbled.
