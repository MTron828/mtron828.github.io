Hua!

The sword light slashed out, its power shocking the world.

And at the instant the sword light slashed out, majestic power of spacetime suddenly covered the void in front of them.

Palace Master Bai Xing was in this void, and the first thing she sensed was the existence of this power of spacetime.

“As expected.”

Temple Master Bai Xing smiled and allowed the space-time power to envelop her, but her figure was not affected at all.

When the sword light came down, Temple Master Bai Xing only raised her hand, and the sword light stopped one meter in front of her.

“That’s enough,” Temple Master Bai Xing said. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Jian Wushuang immediately withdrew his sword and retreated to the side.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis.” Temple Master Bai Xing looked at Jian Wushuang again, but his expression had become very serious. “What’s the name of the sword skill you just displayed? And, did you really create this sword skill?”

“I named this sword skill Blood Asura. Of course, I created it myself.” Jian Wushuang’s expression was strange.

He could see that his Blood Asura sword skill had shocked both Temple Master Bai Xing and Ba Cang.

“Your sword technique is very powerful,” Temple Master Bai Xing said, “if I’m not mistaken, you’ve perfectly combined your swordsmanship with the heaven-designated skill, the first move of the space-time divine skill, right?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“How did you do it?” Temple Master Bai Xing asked.

“How?” Jian Wushuang was stunned. He answered subconsciously, “I just wanted to incorporate the heaven-designated skill into my swordsmanship. I tried to do it, and I did it.”

What Jian Wushuang said was the truth. In the Peerless Sword Manual, except for the two moves of Xi Xiang and Star Dream, he created the other five sword moves in the Bodhi World in the Mystic Realm of the North-blood Realm.

The Bodhi World was obtained by the North-blood Realm in the universe battlefield, and it contained a great opportunity.

He stayed in the Bodhi World for a full 100 years, observing a large number of exquisite swordsmanship and continuously comprehending it. Only then did he create these five sword moves.

As for the Blood Asura move, he did have the idea of incorporating a heaven-designated skill into his own swordsmanship. Then, he tried again. During the process of trying, he continued to study it and succeeded.

There was no other reason or a special factor.

Hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, Temple Master Bai Xing and Ba Cang looked at each other with strange expressions.

“Temple Master Bai Xing, Lord Ba Cang, what’s going on? From the looks of you two, it seems that the sword skill I created is very unusual.” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Nonsense, of course it’s unusual,” Ba Cang said directly, “Boy, I’m afraid you don’t know that the space-time divine skill is the most powerful divine skill that Temple Master created personally. Since Temple Master created it, most of the cultivators in our Temporal Temple have had a hard time comprehending it. It’s impossible to combine this divine skill with other secret skills or incorporate it into their own attack moves!”

“Since the creation of the Temporal Temple, countless experts and talented people have been born in the Temporal Temple. However, none of them have been able to integrate the time-space divine skill into their own offensive skills. Never!”

“No!”

“Even Lord Temple Master himself, although he is the creator of the time-space divine skill, I have never heard Lord Temple Master say that he can integrate the time-space divine skill into his own offensive skills. In other words, you are the first one in our Temporal Temple to integrate the time-space divine skill into his own skills. Do you think what you have created is powerful?”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, do you know why Ba Cang came to pick you up personally?” Temple Master Bai Xing looked at Jian Wushuang. “It was because we saw you fight with the rank seven True Saint of the Purple Cloud Pavilion. During that fight, we saw that your sword had merged with the space-time divine skill, so we were alarmed. We even reported it to the Temple Master, who personally ordered Ba Cang to pick you up.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He did not expect that the sword skill he created would be so amazing.

Although he was proud when he created Blood Asura, he did not expect that his move would make the two experts, Temple Master Bai Xing and Ba Cang, so moved, even Temporal Temple Master’s original body was alarmed and ordered Ba Cang to come and pick him up.

“Boy, you’re really amazing. You’re the first one to incorporate the spacetime divine skill into your swordsmanship.” Ba Cang smiled.

Jian Wushuang was flattered.

“Well, it’s been verified. Your talent in spacetime is indeed beyond ordinary people. Now, follow me,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

Jian Wushuang immediately followed Temple Master Bai Xing to the void ahead.

Under the guidance of Temple Master Bai Xing, it did not take long for Jian Wushuang to arrive at a towering temple.

The temple was not big, but it was extremely majestic.

In the center of the temple, there were neatly arranged divine tablets.

Each of these divine tablets was lifelike and contained boundless vitality. At a glance, there were more than a thousand divine tablets.

“What are these?” Jian Wushuang looked at the divine tablets in front of him in confusion.

“These are the divine tablets of the cultivators under the command of the Temporal Temple. Every expert under the command of the Temporal Temple will leave a divine tablet here, and this divine tablet will contain a trace of his life aura. With this trace of life aura, the Temporal Temple will be able to sense his condition and his location, making it easier for us to rescue him in time.”

“Take an ordinary Principles Master under my Temporal Temple as an example. If this Principles Master is in danger while adventuring outside, he can ask for help from my Temporal Temple. My Temporal Temple can rush to his location in the shortest time according to the life aura he left on the divine throne!”

“In addition, if a cultivator under my Temporal Temple accidentally dies while adventuring outside, his divine throne here will be directly destroyed. We can also know that he is dead,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood, but suddenly, his expression changed. “Temple Master Bai Xing, if you said that every expert under the command of the spacetime temple would leave a divine seat here, then why are there so few divine seats here? There are only over a thousand divine seats, could it be…”

Jian Wushuang thought of a possibility, and his expression immediately became strange.

Temple Master Bai Xing smiled and said, “You guessed it right. There are only about 1,000 experts in the Temporal Temple who are still alive. Their divine seats are all here.”
