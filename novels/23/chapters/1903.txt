Chapter 1904: Going To Attack

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“The third volume, once performed, could multiply my attack power by a thousand times…” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands as his eyes shined.

Although he could only perform one move, it would be a thousand times the power.

His fighting power was already at the level of Peak Emperor God. Which level would he be able to reach if his power were to be increased by a thousand times?

A terrifying hit by a Great Emperor was nothing.

The strongest trump card!

The moment Jian Wushuang successfully cultivated Secret Skill of Star Palace, it became his strongest trump card!

Just like the other trump cards, King Sword Skill, Star Destruction Skill, River Mountain Map. Although they were all powerful.

None of the trump cards would enable him to increase his power by a thousand times in a split moment.

If the trump card were to be utilized appropriately, he could turn around an undesirable change!!!

…

After grasping the final strongest trump card, Jian Wushuang came out of seclusion.

In the lofty palace in Lineage of Star.

“Palace Master!”

Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin, Hall Master Nie Yun, the three of them stood in reverence before Jian Wushuang.

“Almighties Alliance, did they make any move?” Jian Wushuang looked.

“No, I think they are still waiting for our reply,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Hehe, Almighties Alliance want to take advantage of us during our difficult times. It won’t be that easy. Forget about the fact that they offer no effort at all, even if they were to be willing to work with Lineage of Star to fight against the two alliances, I wouldn’t pass them Secret Skill of Star Palace,” Jian Wushuang sneered.

“If so, I shall reply to them now then,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“There’s no hurry,” Jian Wushuang waved his hand, “Don’t need to reply. Keep them waiting. Even if they ask, tell them Lineage of Star still needs time to consider. We can hold them back for the time being. Seizing the time, Lineage of Star shall first take care of Star Extermination Alliance and Supreme Ten Alliance.”

Hearing what Jian Wushuang had said, the three Hall Masters were surprised. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Palace Master, we are finally taking action?” Hall Master Nie Yun’s eyes were burning with enthusiasm.

All these years, Star Extermination Alliance and Supreme Ten Alliance had been sending people who hurled abuse and humiliated them from outside. The experts in Lineage of Star felt aggrieved, let alone Hall Master Nie Yun, who was a short-tempered and impatient person.

“We’ve been hiding for so many years and we are so full of grievances. It’s finally time for us to get back in the game,” Jian Wushuang smiled but his smile was cold.

“Hall Master Yuan, follow the original plan and carry on,” Jian Wushuang commanded.

“Yes,” Hall Master Yuan nodded. His eyes were beaming too.

Lineage of Star had been showing the white feather, they had been hiding.

Even though they were humiliated, they were holding themselves back.

They had been hiding for so long and they were finally going to counterattack!

…

Outside Universe Galaxy, in the vast void, there were lofty palaces and pavilions floating.

The palaces and pavilions were built by Star Extermination Alliance temporarily, where the headquarters of Star Extermination Alliance was.

Then, in the lofty palace right in the middle.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Emperor God Tian Ling, Number One Divine King, Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church, Master of Highest Heaven Emperor Mansion, the main representatives rushed over one after another.

“Palace Master Wu Luo, what’s the matter? Why are you looking for us in a hurry?” Number One Divine King asked.

Palace Master Wu Luo, who was waiting in the palace since long ago, smirked, “Of course, there’s good news.”

Then, Palace Master Wu Luo looked to the person next to him.

Everyone else looked at the person as well.

She was a white-robed married woman who had a great body. The beautiful married woman only gave out aura of a Sir God. In terms of power, no one at the scene would bother with her.

However, her identity was extraordinary.

The beautiful married woman was Sir God Yin Yue, a genius in formation.

In the past two hundred and fifty years, Star Extermination Alliance had invited a few geniuses in formation to study the Galaxy formation. Amongst them, Sir God Yin Yue was the most knowledgeable in formation.

“Sir God Yin Yue, did you find the weak point of the formation?” Number One Divine King couldn’t help but ask.

“Luckily I accomplished the mission,” Sir God Yin Yue smiled.

Merely a short reply but it struck happiness in everyone.

One should know that Star Extermination Alliance possess the power to exterminate Lineage of Star. However, because of Galaxy formation, they could do nothing about it.

In the past two hundred and fifty years, they had been trying to resolve the Galaxy formation.

Then, there was finally news about it.

“Everyone, please take a look,” Sir God Yin Yue waved and there was immediately a miniature Galaxy on the floor in the palace.

With naked eyes, besides the size, the Galaxy looked exactly the same as Universe Galaxy.

“Look, I marked it here,” Sir God Yin Yue pointed at a spot on the Galaxy.

It was a corner that was hard to notice in Universe Galaxy, which no one would pay attention to normally. Under Sir God Yin Yue’s manipulation, there was energy revolving in the Galaxy and it formed a cycle. In the complete cycle, the corner that Sir God Yin Yue had marked was the middle of the support for the cycle.

“As expected!”

The Peak Emperor Gods were beaming with joy when they saw it.

“The Galaxy around Lineage of Star is really unique. I’ve searched for a very long time to find this place. Besides myself, in Eternal Chaotic World, there definitely will be less than three people who could find this.

“Haha, thank you Sir God Yin Yue. The previously agreed reward, we Star Extermination Alliance would triple it,” Palace Master Wu Luo said.

“Thank you,” Sir God Yin Yue was delighted.

Palace Master Wu Luo looked at the people around him, “As we now know the weak point of the Galaxy formation, the following matter is much easier. We only need to break this point with fierce force. The cycle of the galaxy will definitely shatter and the galaxy formation will be resolved.”

“That being said, even the weak point requires fierce power to break it. I wonder if all experts in Star Extermination Alliance could break it if they worked together,” Number One Divine King creased his eyebrows and said.

“Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church, how did the attack superposition formation go?” Palace Master Wu Luo looked at Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church.

“We found an ordinary attack superposition formation. Although it could concentrate all Almighties’ power, it could at most concentrate over ten Almighties’ power. Our Star Extermination Alliance’s experts use this attack superposition formation would concentrate six attacks in the end. It is better than all power scattered, better than over seventy attacks. The possibility of breaking the weak point should be high,” Master of Real Martial Arts Divine Church said.

“Whether or not we can break it, we will know when we try,” Palace Master Wu Luo looked cold, “Let’s go!”

Very soon, the experts from Star Extermination Alliance departed.
