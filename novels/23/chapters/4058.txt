Chapter 4059: Slaughter

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Long Chenxing River, a Galaxy that was wider than the Purple Micro Galaxy, had more intersecting Star Fields, and was more chaotic.

There were also a large number of space pirates in long Chenxing River, and they were more powerful. There were many fourth-level and fifth-level space pirates. There were even rumors that there were even ultimate level space pirates in long Chenxing River.

In the Galaxy.

“Kill him!”

“It’s already good enough that we don’t kill a second-level space Ruler. How dare he provoke us?” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

!!

“He’s courting death!”

Hundreds of space pirates charged at a black-clothed man in front of the Galaxy like wasps.

The black-clothed man held a sword in one hand, and his figure directly materialized.

He appeared among the space pirates like a ghost.

Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!

Sword shadows seemed to fly out casually. These sword shadows weren’t very powerful, but they were very mysterious.

The sword shadows easily slashed onto the bodies of the space pirates. The weaker first-level or second-level Rulers could not withstand one sword attack, and they were killed, even the protective armor on the surface of their bodies was torn apart easily.

Even the third-level Ruler’s true treasure armor was torn apart with a single sword attack, and his godly power was instantly annihilated.

Although this black-clothed man was only a second-level Ruler, and the power of his godly power was only at the peak of the second-level, the third-level Rulers could not withstand the sword techniques he displayed.

The slaughter was completely one-sided.

More than a hundred space pirates had been slaughtered in just a few breaths, and only a few of them had fled back when they saw that the situation was not good.

And at this time…

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!

Four strong auras suddenly swept over from the distant void. These four people were three men and one woman, and the auras on their bodies were all at the fourth-level Ruler level.

“Leader!”

“Leader!”

Seeing the appearance of the four people, the space pirates who were lucky enough to survive screamed miserably as if they had seen their savior.

These four people were the leaders of this group of space pirates.

In Chenxing River, even a small space pirate gang had a fourth-level dominator overseeing them. Now, there were four fourth-level Dominators in this space pirate gang.

“A second-level Ruler killed so many of us?”

“He is only a second-level Ruler, and his divine power is only at the second level, but his swordsmanship can’t even stop a third-level Ruler?”

“His divine sword in the water should be a medium-grade principle treasure, and it can even tear the supreme true treasure armor.”

The four leaders stared at Jian Wushuang with cold eyes. Their eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Four fourth-level Rulers? That’s going to take some effort.” Jian Wushuang looked up at the four leaders with a smile on his face.

It was a clear smile.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang moved and easily appeared in front of the four leaders as if he had teleported.

“Be careful!”

The four leaders were shocked because Jian Wushuang’s speed was very fast.

However, before they could react, Jian Wushuang had already struck.

Whoosh!

It was a very ordinary and casual strike.

In the eyes of the four fourth-level Rulers, this strike was very slow and soft, as if it contained no power at all,

even an ordinary Principle Ruler might be able to dodge such a slow sword move, let alone a Ruler.

However, when the four leaders saw Jian Wushuang’s sword move and were ready to counterattack, they were horrified to find that they could not move.

It was not that they could not move, but that they were too slow,

they were as slow as snails, so slow that they could not dodge or block Jian Wushuang’s sword light.

“It’s not that we are too slow, but his swordsmanship is too fast!” This thought immediately appeared in the minds of the four leaders.

They widened their eyes and watched as the slow and soft sword light slashed at their necks at the same time, the power of the true treasure armor on their bodies had been fully activated, protecting their entire bodies.

However, when the sword light slashed toward them, the supreme-tier true treasure armor on their bodies was torn apart like a piece of paper by the sword light.

The power of the sword light did not decrease, and it continued to slash toward their godly bodies.

Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!

The sound of the sword cutting into their bodies could be heard, and four huge heads were sent flying at the same time.

The four leaders’ eyes were still filled with fear and disbelief, they did not believe that a second-level Ruler could kill them with only one sword attack. Even their true treasures, armor, and undying bodies were useless against this sword attack.

“The leader is dead?”

“He killed four leaders with one sword strike?”

“Run!”

Those space pirates who were lucky enough to survive were even more terrified. They were scared out of their wits and began to flee frantically.

Jian Wushuang did not chase after them anymore, buzz! The ancient universe boat stopped in the void around Jian Wushuang. Leng Rushuang and Devil Flame walked out of the universe boat.

“Husband, your strength has improved a lot compared to 30,000 years ago,” Leng Rushuang said with a smile.

“You only used the divine power of a second-level Ruler and killed four fourth-level Rulers with one sword attack. Ruler, your strength…” Devil Flame was also amazed.

Jian Wushuang just smiled faintly.

It was not a big deal to kill four fourth-level Rulers with the combat strength of a second-level Ruler. After all, Jian Wushuang already had the combat strength of a fifth-level Ruler since a long time ago in the Purple Micro Galaxy, he had even killed a fifth-level Ruler, Thunder Star Lord.

However, the reason why Jian Wushuang had such battle strength was that his divine power was very strong. It was comparable to the divine power of a third-level Ruler, plus the power of the will given by the universal principles, he also had two secret skills, life divine power and heaven-cleaving skill. This made him as powerful as any fourth-level Ruler.

But this time, whether it was killing the space pirates or killing the four fourth-level Rulers, his divine power was controlled at the second-level, he did not use the power of the will given by the universe principles.

In other words, he killed the four fourth-level Rulers with the power of an ordinary second-level Ruler, relying solely on his swordsmanship and his comprehension and application of the universe principles.

If it had been 30,000 years ago, Jian Wushuang would not have been able to do this. However, over the years, as he comprehended the Purple Blood Secret Manual, his application of the universe principles continued to improve. Combined with his swordsmanship, he was able to display his own swordsmanship, it was several times more exquisite and terrifying than before, or even nearly ten times more.

That was how he was able to do this.
