Chapter 1647: Sanctuary Mountain

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

As a Chaos Divine Treasure, the Mountain River Map had a high requirement of Divine Power.

A normal Real God would be unable to use such a treasure. As an Inverse Cultivator, Jian Wushuang possessed the Ultimate Divine Power, which was not weaker than a Chaotic Real God’s Divine Power.

Hence, he could barely use the treasure.

The most frightening thing of the Mountain River Map were the nine continents that it contained. The nine continents would change into an earth-shaking Nine-province Seal. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The Nine-province Seal contained a total of nine moves. A long time ago, Jian Wushuang had grasped the First Move. However, he lacked the Divine Power necessary to use it.

At that very moment, as he possessed the necessary amount of Divine Power, he could naturally use it.

“Let’s try it…” Jian Wushuang attempted to use the first move at once.

With a wave of his hand, the Mountain River Map blended into the surrounding void.

Buzz~~~ An unusual ray of light appeared, and the void which was originally in complete darkness started to change at once.

Atop the void, a giant and exceptionally beautiful Picture Scroll World appeared slowly and it spread all over the heaven like flowing water.

The world contained mountains and rivers. The scenery was beautiful.

The most attractive thing was naturally the nine continents which were spread all over nine different corners.

“The mountains and rivers are as palms, and the Nine Provinces as the seal!!!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were glowing with a shrill light and he shouted out those words with a pause in between each word. Every word contained a special magical power.

At the same time, he released the Divine Power from his body crazily and it entered the Picture Scroll World.

In no time, one of the nine continents became extremely lifelike and came out from the Picture Scroll World slowly.

Rumble~~~

The continent descended completely.

It then fell on its frightening weight.

With that, the standalone void was torn open completely like paper.

In the blink of an eye, the power dissipated and the standalone void quietened down. Only the exceptionally beautiful Picture Scroll World, which was flowing slowly in the heavens, remained.

Jian Wushuang was sitting on the void and he drew a light breath.

“As expected of a Chaos Divine Treasure. Although I can barely use it with my Divine Power, I can only unleash forty percent of the power of the Nine-province Seal’s First Seal. As for my Divine Power, I have used more than fifty percent of it,” Jian Wushuang gasped.

He had only become an Ultimate Real God recently. Hence, his body only contained one Ultimate Divine Power Water Droplet and he did not possess enough Divine Power. By using the Eternal Divine Treasure forcefully, he would deplete a great amount of Divine Power.

However, even though the rate of depletion was shocking, its power did not disappoint him.

“If I am not wrong, if I were to activate the Mountain River Map and use the First Seal of the Nine-province Seal with my current Divine Power, its power would be enough to kill a normal Chaotic Real God easily. Moreover, even top experts from the Chaotic Real Gods would be unable to block it. If I were to combine it with the Secret Skill of Star Palace… Even if it were experts in the Real God ranking list, probably not many of them would be able to block it. Moreover, even if they were able to block it, they would definitely end up in a bad state.”

“In other words, I currently have two strongest trump cards. The first one is the Secret Skill of Star Palace while the second one is this Mountain River Map. Moreover, if I were to come across a strong enemy who I cannot block at all, I could use these two trump cards at the same time.

“If I were to go up another stage and become a Stage Two Ultimate Real God, where my Divine Power is equivalent to that of a normal Almighty, I should be able to unleash the full power of the Nine-province Seal’s First Move. Moreover, I might even be able to unleash the Second Move and Third Move of the Nine-province Seal. At that time, I will be able to unleash the true power of this Chaos Divine Treasure.”

Jian Wushuang clenched both his fists tightly and his eyes were glowing brilliantly.

…

Thunderbolt Island, Doctrine Palace.

As the goal of the Power of Heaven Way’s comprehension, the Doctrine Palace had always been lively as experts would come to challenge the Doctrine Palace from time to time.

At that very moment, Jian Wushuang had also come before the Doctrine Palace.

“Lord You Ji,” Jian Wushuang greeted a black-robed, middle-aged man who was in front of him.

“You are the Lineage of Star’s Inverse Cultivator, Jian Wushuang?” the black-robed middle-aged man’s voice was cold, “Why, have you come to challenge the Doctrine Palace as well?”

“I have come here to give it a try,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“How many levels do you wish to challenge?” the black-robed, middle-aged man asked.

“I shall start from the fourth level. If it’s possible, I also wish to clear the fifth level,” Jian Wushuang said bluntly.

“Oh? Then I shall wait and see,” the black-robed, middle-aged man raised his eyebrows, “You may go in.”

Jian Wushuang walked toward the Doctrine Palace at once.

Although there was only one Doctrine Palace, many people could challenge it at the same time.

Jian Wushuang went straight to the fourth level of the Doctrine Palace.

The fourth level was within a group of huge volcanoes and a red-armored shadow was standing on the sky above the group of volcanoes.

The red-armored shadow looked toward Jian Wushuang, “I can tell that you have been comprehending the Reincarnation Doctrine and Spacetime Doctrine at the same time. Hence, you can choose to use either the Reincarnation Doctrine, Spacetime Doctrine, or a combination of both to clear this level.”

“I choose the Spacetime Doctrine,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

Although he was comprehending two Heaven Ways, only his Spacetime Doctrine could clear the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace.

In a split second, Jian Wushuang fought with the red-armored shadow.

As it was only the fourth level of the Doctrine Palace, Jian Wushuang cleared it easily without using a lot of energy.

After that, he came to the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace.

…

Outside the Doctrine Palace sat the black-robed, middle-aged man.

He was the person in charge of the Doctrine Palace. Hence, he knew everything that was happening within the Doctrine Palace clearly.

“Yes. That Jian Wushuang has really cleared the fifth level?” the black-robed middle-aged man was surprised.

In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang walked out from the Doctrine Palace.

“Little kid, you are not too bad. Even though you have only become a Real God recently, you have cleared the fifth level of the Doctrine Palace. Looking at these abilities of yours, there probably isn’t a second Void Real God who is superior to you in the Sanctuary Alliance.” The black-robed middle-aged man giggled, “Since you have cleared the fifth level, according to the rules of the Thunderbolt Island, you now possess the right to stay in the Thunderbolt Island permanently and I will let the person in charge of the Sanctuary Mountain know about this matter. Now, you can go to the Sanctuary Mountain and choose a place to build your own palace or cave.”

After hearing what was said, Jian Wushuang’s eyes brightened up immediately.

The right to stay in the Thunderbolt Island permanently was something that could make many Eternal Real Gods, as well as a few Chaotic Real Gods, extremely envious. Furthermore, at that very moment, Jian Wushuang possessed this right after having become a Real God recently.

Jian Wushuang headed to the Sanctuary Mountain right away.

The Sanctuary Mountain was in the northern region of the Thunderbolt Island and it was extremely huge.

Upon arriving at the Sanctuary Mountain, Jian Wushuang looked at the enormous mountain range in front of him. At the same time, he also saw many different kinds of palaces, caves and courtyards on the mountain range and there were many of them.

Moreover, those structures and buildings were well-distributed. Most of them were either at the foot of a mountain or halfway up a mountain. As for palaces at the top of the mountain, there were very few of them.

“The people living at the top of the mountains of the Sanctuary Mountain should be Almighties. The foot of the mountains and halfway up the mountains should be places where Real Gods live,” Jian Wushuang laughed nonchalantly and in no time, he found a place.
