“Please rise,” Temple Master Pure Moon said in a soft voice.

Everyone got up one after another, at which point they noticed many people arriving and quickly appearing at her side. Those people were the generals of East Camp.

These 10 generals were all Divine Emperors who had participated in the fight with Demonic Beasts on the front battlefield. They came here after they sensed what was happening and even Emperor Fengxiao was among them.

“Golden Snake, aren’t you quite irritable today?” Emperor Fengxiao looked at Emperor Golden Snake with great interest.

“Emperor Golden Snake, I just heard that you wanted to have a Life-death Duel with Xiying. What happened? Why did you mention a Life-death Duel?”

“Haha, Golden Snake, you always keep a low profile. Why are you being so domineering today?”

The generals were talking casually.

Emperor Golden Snake was regarded as an average general among the 108 Divine Emperors. Many of the Divine Emperors present were stronger than him. As for Emperor Fengxiao, he was far stronger than Golden Snake.

They did not need to consider Golden Snake’s feeling when joking.

Emperor Golden Snake’s face darkened slightly. Nevertheless, with the presence of so many Divine Emperors and Temple Master Pure Moon, he dared not rage against them.

Before Emperor Golden Snake could say anything, Emperor Xiying began to speak.

“Temple Master Pure Moon, and everyone else.”

Emperor Xiying narrated what he witnessed.

“When I was on the front battlefield, I noticed that Emperor Golden Snake seemed a little weird, so I followed him here. Then I found him fighting with this Divine General named Jian Wushuang.”

“Inthe end, Golden Snake is a Divine Emperor and he violated the rules of the East Camp by fighting with a Divine General. In addition, this Divine General had just fought with the Demonic Beasts and made great contributions to our League. So I tried to stop him.”

“I never thought that he was unwilling to stop and insisted on killing Jian Wushuang. He even said that he would apply for a Life-death Duel with me if I still tried to stop him.”

“Is it so?”

Temple Master Pure Moon, as well as the Divine Emperors, looked at Emperor Golden Snake in shock.

“Golden Snake, what’s the matter?” Temple Master Pure Moon’s voice became cold.

East Camp was established to defend against the Demonic Beasts.

Its only enemy was the Demonic Beasts.

In the East Camp, any personal conflicts must be put aside. The experts were allowed to fight with each other only after they left the East Camp, or if they got permission from the higher-level experts after applying for a Life-death Duel.

Emperor Golden Snake had indeed violated the rules of East Camp by trying to kill a Divine General without regards to the price. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Temple Master Pure Moon, Jian Wushuang killed my only son. How can I spare his life?” Emperor Golden Snake said in a trembling voice.

“Killed your son?” Temple Master Pure Moon’s beautiful face became serious. She asked, “Do you mean that this Divine General killed your son out of personal conflicts during the battle with the Demonic Beasts?”

“Yes,” Emperor Golden Snake replied, “I got a message from Ling’er before he died. Out of personal conflicts, Jian Wushuang left him to die while fighting the Demonic Beasts. Temple Master Pure Moon, please uphold justice and allow me to kill this man and avenge Ling’er!”

“Left him to die?” Temple Master Pure Moon raised her eyebrows and turned to Jian Wushuang. Her mighty aura also started to suppress Jian Wushuang.

“Little boy, is that true?” She asked.

The Divine Emperors also turned to Jian Wushuang.

Under the gaze of the crowd, Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and then nodded slowly, “Indeed, it’s true!”

“Temple Master Pure Moon, and everyone else, did you hear him? He admitted that he refused to help Ling’er and caused Ling’er’s death!” Emperor Golden Snake’s voice was full of pain. “Ling’er died because of him. Shouldn’t I kill him to avenge Ling’er?”

The other Divine Emperors quietly nodded their agreement.

In this case, it was natural for Emperor Golden Snake to avenge his son.

At this moment, however, Jian Wushuang stepped forward and solemnly said when looking at Temple Master Pure Moon and others Divine Emperors, “Temple Master Pure Moon and respected Divine Emperors, I want to ask you a question before you come to a conclusion.”

Temple Master Pure Moon and the Divine Emperors turned to look at Jian Wushuang again.

“My question is this, if you rescue a man, then he stabs you in the back after that and causes you to fall into a crisis, will you rescue him again?” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

“Of course I won’t rescue such an ungrateful man,” a hot-tempered Divine Emperor directly answered.

“That’s it.” Jian Wushuang said loudly, “Your honors, I had already saved Jin Ling once before he died.”

“I did my best to save him even at the price of falling into a crisis myself. After he made it out, he ignored the ones who saved him and only wanted to flee for his life, causing us to fall into despair and nearly die!”

“If it wasn’t for my trump cards, the sergeants of my squad and I would have been killed by the Demonic Beasts.”

“The farmer saved a snake, but was bitten by it!”

“I rescued such an ungrateful and selfish man once. Why should I rescue him a second time?”

Jian Wushuang became more agitated as he said these words and his eyes which were full of anger as he turned to face Emperor Golden Snake.

“Emperor Golden Snake, you said that I left him to die. Let me ask you this, would you save him if you were me?” Jian Wushuang shouted angrily.

Golden Snake’s expression darkened, but he did not reply.

“Temple Master Pure Moon, and Your honors,” Jian Wushuang turned to Temple Master Pure Moon and said solemnly, “I, Jian Wushuang, am always open and straightforward. I’m fair to everyone and won’t be affected by private feelings in business. I did my best to save Jin Ling once, so I don’t feel guilty!”

“I rescued him, but what I got in return was him leaving me in a desperate situation!”

“I’m not a fool!”

“I won’t be cheated a second time.”

“Even if Jin Ling stood in front of me and asked for my help now, I wouldn’t save him again.”

“If I were not restrained by the rules of East Camp, I would kill him myself!”

Jian Wushuang’s loud voice echoed throughout the area and his words were as sharp as blades, making people secretly feel surprised as they quivered.

Temple Master Pure Moon and the Divine Emperors became silent.

They were thinking about Jian Wushuang’s words.

If it were them, would they save Jin Ling again after that?

The answer was definitely no.
