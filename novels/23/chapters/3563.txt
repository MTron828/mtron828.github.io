Chapter 3563: Star Thunder Ruler

“These human-shaped statues are obviously the guards of this high platform. It’s fine if I don’t go near the high platform, but once I get close to the high platform, these human-shaped statues will probably wake up and kill me. The trouble is that I don’t know the strength of these human-shaped statues.”

Jian Wushuang understood that the three battlefields in this territory were not formed naturally, but probably came from the depths of the universe.

In the depths of the universe, experts were as numerous as clouds. There were many overlord-level experts and their methods were earth-shaking. The battlefields they left behind were filled with too many unknowns.

In Jian Wushuang’s opinion, these human-shaped statues on the high platform might be the battle strength of a Principles Master, but they might also be the battle strength of a Ruler Realm expert.

If they were only the battle strength of a Principles Master, then it would be fine. Even if they were all at the pinnacle of the six realm, he still had a chance to protect himself. However, if all the human-shaped statues had the battle strength of a Ruler, then he would be courting death, if he rushed forward, it would be no different from courting death.

“But I’ve come here with great difficulty, and the opportunity is right in front of me. I can’t just turn around and leave like Xue Bei.” Jian Wushuang frowned and thought for a while, in the end, Jian Wushuang could only think of a way to neutralize the situation.

“I must get close to the high platform, but I don’t need to be anxious. I’ll try to get close first and see the reaction of these human-shaped statues. Even if they wake up, they can’t rush to my side all at once. I can try to fight with them first and figure out their strength.”

“If they are far beyond me and I can’t fight them, I will escape immediately. As long as I don’t go too deep, I can still escape from the edge of the high platform.” Jian Wushuang made up his mind. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

He carefully approached the high platform in front of him.

As he slowly approached the high platform, he focused his attention on the reactions of the human-shaped sculptures on the high platform and was ready to escape at any time.

However, to his surprise, he was still extremely close to the high platform. However, the human-shaped sculptures on the high platform still did not have the slightest reaction, even though he had half a foot on the high platform, the human-shaped sculptures still did not move at all.

“What’s going on? Am I thinking too much? Are these human-shaped sculptures not dangerous?” Jian Wushuang frowned. He was also full of doubts, but now he was completely standing on the high platform, although he was at the edge of the high platform, those human-shaped sculptures should be able to wake up.

But in fact, there was still no movement from those human-shaped sculptures.

“Let’s not worry about that for now. Let’s get the blood-red armor and the long stick first.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes. He took another step and slowly walked toward the corpse of the purple-haired elder in the center of the high platform.

One step, two steps...Jian Wushuang had already appeared in front of the human-shaped sculptures. Even when he was close to the center of the platform, the sculptures still did not move.

In the end, Jian Wushuang finally came to the side of the purple-haired elder.

“Did it really go so smoothly?”

Jian Wushuang stood beside the purple-haired elder’s corpse and looked around the human-shaped sculptures with a trace of doubt, but the sculptures still did not respond.

Shaking his head, Jian Wushuang did not think too much about it. He carefully inspected the purple-haired old man’s divine body and confirmed that there was nothing wrong with it. Then he bowed slightly to the purple-haired old man and said, “Sorry to offend you!”

After bowing, he took the purple-haired old man’s blood-red armor and the dark cyan longstaff in his hand.

When he came into contact with the blood-red armor and the dark cyan longstaff, Jian Wushuang finally sensed the power of the two supreme treasures and knew their specific levels.

“Shadow Demon Thunder Rod...a pinnacle universe true treasure!”

“Blood Demon Cave Armor...a pinnacle universe true treasure armor!”

After learning the name and level of the armor and the long rod, Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“A pinnacle universe true treasure? And there’s a pinnacle universe true treasure armor?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were wide open.

Universe true treasures were divided into elementary, advanced, pinnacle, peak, and supreme true treasures.

Top-tier universe true treasures were enough to make countless Principles Masters fight over them. As for pinnacle true treasures and supreme true treasures, they were usually only available to great beings at the Ruler Realm, and only a few Principles Masters who were extremely powerful had them, that was why there were pinnacle universe true treasures.

But now, Shadow Demon Thunder Staff and Blood Demon Cave Armor were both at the level of Pinnacle Universe true treasures.

The Blood Demon Cave Armor was a pinnacle universe true treasure armor, which was so valuable that even an ordinary Ruler Realm expert would be envious of it.

“Under normal circumstances, even an extremely powerful Principles Master would be very lucky to have an attack weapon at the pinnacle universe true treasure level. It’s impossible for him to have a pinnacle universe true treasure armor. Since this old man left behind such a true treasure, then his identity...” Jian Wushuang looked at the purple-haired old man in front of him, waves of emotions rose in his heart.

This purple-haired old man should be a Ruler, if he was not mistaken!

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly changed. He noticed that there was a black ring on the ring finger of the purple-haired old man’s right hand.

“Interspatial ring!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up. “This Ruler left not only the Blood Demon Cave Armor and the Shadow Demon Thunder Staff, but also the interspatial ring.”

Jian Wushuang was overjoyed.

The Blood Demon Cave Armor and the Shadow Demon Thunder Staff alone were invaluable, but now there was an interspatial ring...

The interspatial ring was left by the Ruler. It should contain all the wealth of the Ruler Realm expert and the entire wealth of a Ruler Realm expert. Jian Wushuang was excited just thinking about it.

Jian Wushuang possessed it and took off the interspatial ring on the ring finger of the purple-haired elder.

Since the owner of the interspatial ring had died, Jian Wushuang could use his consciousness to check it. However, when he checked it, he immediately frowned.

“What’s going on? How can there be a token in this interspatial ring?”

Jian Wushuang took out the only token left in the interspatial ring with surprise and then sank his consciousness into the token.

In an instant, a vast amount of information surged toward Jian Wushuang.

“I am the Star Thunder Ruler in the mortal world!”

The first sentence of the information revealed the true identity of the purple-haired elder, and it also proved Jian Wushuang’s guess.

“He is indeed a Ruler, but I have never heard of the Star Thunder Ruler. There is also the mortal world... There seems to be no mortal world in the dozens of starworlds in the surrounding territories.” Jian Wushuang frowned, then he continued reading.
