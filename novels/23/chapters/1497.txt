Chapter 1498: Grand Banquet

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Many mystery lands and some unique places, such as Sky Sword Prison, had sealed off connection with the outside world entirely.

But Wu Bei’s cave obviously hadn’t.

Jian Wushuang immediately started going through the information that Hall Master Yuan had sent over.

Very soon, he had a rough idea about Wu Bei’s cave.

Firstly, regarding the experts.

Since the news about Wu Bei’s cave had spread until then, there were many Almighties that were shaken by the news. However, the Almighties couldn’t enter Wu Bei’s cave personally. Hence, they could only make use of their influence and send the Universe Gods under their command to enter Wu Bei’s cave.

Some Almighties had even paid a high price to hire experts on Universe God ranking lists, including Universe Gods who were extremely famous, to participate.

Each and every force and sect in the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries did the same too.

Besides, there were even people passing a message that they had promised to give a Real God Chaos Unique Treasure in exchange for White Blaze Fruit. The Real God Chaos Unique Treasure was not limited by category. In other words, one could also request a Real God Chaos Unique Realm Treasure with one White Blaze Fruit. Many forces were willing to do the trade.

As such, countless Universe Gods in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries heard the news and came, including a large number of solo experts. Regardless of if they were famous or not, they all participated in the battle for White Blaze Fruit. It had only been one month’s time since the news had spread, but there were more than a hundred thousand Universe Gods who entered Wu Bei’s cave.

The hundred thousand Universe Gods were not any ordinary Universe Gods. Every one of them was confident in their power. The weakest among them should be a Peak Universe God of the Third Heaven. As for the stronger ones, experts who were listed on the Universe God ranking list, there were at least sixty of them in the place and there were many who were on their way there.

It could be described as a grand fight banquet of Universe Gods in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries!

An unprecedented grand banquet.

“Almost a hundred thousand top Universe God are gathered here, and there are many more Universe Gods on their way here?”

Jian Wushuang looked around and sighed in amazement.

In the Eternal Chaotic World, probably only when the involvement of the Almighties and also the temptation of Real God Chaos Unique Treasure could attract so many top Universe Gods.

“If I’m not mistaken, some of the Universe Gods aren’t here for White Blaze Fruits, but for fame. This grand banquet attracted half of the experts on Universe God ranking list that are hard to meet on normal days. With all eyes watching, with all experts gathered, one only need to slightly reveal their power to be famous all over the universe. Plus, some might even be looked upon by Real Gods and Almighties outside of the cave dwelling, and become their disciples. To many Universe Gods who aren’t famous, it is a great attraction for them,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“If I have never joined Lineage of Star and I am not famous, I’ll definitely participate in this grand banquet without hesitation. After all, it is the grandest banquet for Universe Gods level in Eternal Chaotic World. If one were to miss the grand banquet, it would be a chance hard to come by again in the future,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re quite famous now. As you came to Wu Bei’s cave, I’m afraid many people might eye you. It is inevitable that there will be people who come to challenge you. You’d better be prepared,” King of Venomous Worms.

“I prepared long ago. Tell them to bring it on,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Almost a hundred thousand Universe Gods. It was a large number, but they were then scattered all over Wu Bei’s cave.

The Universe Gods were scattered all around the cave dwelling to look for an exotic beast, Iron Wing Beast.

The exotic beast was very rare in Eternal Chaotic World too. However, there was quite a large number of them in Wu Bri’s cave. No one knew how Real God Wu Bei had got them.

In the Iron Wing Beast’s body, there were very few who had a Qian Kun ring with them and there was White Blaze Fruit in the Qian Kun ring.

The Universe Gods in Wu Bei’s cave was then looking for those Iron Wing Beasts wantonly and trying to kill them to get the Qian Kun ring in the Iron Wing Beasts’ bodies.

“He put White Blaze Fruits in the stomach of those Iron Wing Beasts? On top of that, not every Iron Wing Beast carries them? Real God Wu Bei is quite strange,” Jian Wushuang muttered. Then, he started searching the cave dwelling too.

Vroom.

A boundless Soul Power spread recklessly and permeated the surrounding ten thousand mile range. The ten thousand mile range that he had covered appeared before Jian Wushuang clearly.

“Within the ten thousand mile range that I covered, there are eight Universe Gods. It is so crowded,” Jian Wushuang frowned.

Although the cave dwelling was spacious, it was naturally crowded when a hundred thousand people were scattered all around.

“In such a crowded environment, even if I found an Iron Wing Beast first, the very moment I launch an attack, my movement will definitely attract the surrounding Universe God. By then, a fight will be inevitable. That’d be a little troublesome,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

In the independent space, he was at an extremely great advantage. His advantage was because of his Soul Power.

According to the information that Hall Master Yuan had sent, the aura of Iron Wing Beast was unique. One would not notice them if they only covered the area with consciousness and only probed inch-by-inch with consciousness carefully. However, the process of probing inch-by-inch was very slow.

Just like back then in Sky Sword Prison when Blood Emperor had invited Heartless King to help to look for Jian Wushuang within the one billion mile range.

Even Heartless King, who was a Real God and good at consciousness attacks, required a long time to probe a million mile range inch by inch. It was naturally even more difficult if the Universe Gods in the independent space wanted to probe inch by inch. Hence, even though there were more than a hundred thousand of Universe Gods who had stayed for more than a month but they didn’t probe many places. Many Iron Wing Beasts remained hidden.

On the other hand, if Jian Wushuang were to probe using Soul Power, it would definitely be easier by a thousandfold for him than the other Universe Gods.

It was a pity that in the situation where the experts were scattered and so densely populated, even if he was the first who found the Iron Wing Beast, it wouldn’t be easy to get the Qian Kun ring in the Iron Wing Beast.

“Regardless, let’s find an Iron Wing Beast first.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and immediately started searching wantonly in the independent space.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s figure pierced the void like a flowing light. While he plunged through the void, his Soul Power probed the surrounding thousands of miles and he confirmed that there weren’t any Iron Wing Beasts.

While Jian Wushuang traveled at such terrifying speed, Universe Gods that he flew by were shocked.

“Such a swift speed… This person can’t be looking for Iron Wing Beasts. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be traveling at that speed!”

The Universe Gods didn’t know that when Jian Wushuang flew past them, he had already swept through their surrounding area.
