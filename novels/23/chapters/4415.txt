4418 The Universe Shakes

The Blood Sky Ruler was dead.

The man, who had once stood at the peak of the universe and was the leader of a force, had died in the hands of Jian Wushuang.

Above the starry sky, Jian Wushuang stood with his hands behind his back. His black hair was flying, his eyes were burning with fire, and his handsome face was indifferent.

Countless stars were under his feet. He was like a god, the master of the stars.

!!

For a moment, everyone in the minor planetary system had their mouths wide open, and there was silence.

The Blood Sky Ruler had ruled over them for nearly a thousand chaos cycles, and their fear of him had been etched into their bones.

They had never thought that the Blood Sky Ruler would fall at the hands of others one day.

All of this had happened too suddenly. It was like a dream, giving people a sense of surrealism.

After a long time, when Jian Wushuang had left, they slowly came back to their senses. They looked at each other and instantly became excited!

“He’s fallen! The Blood Sky Supreme, a giant star, has fallen!”

it seems that Jian Wushuang will have to settle the old scores now that he has broken through to the Supreme Master level!

“That’s right. If I’m not wrong, the Blood Sky Ruler is just the beginning. Jian Wushuang will not let any of the six major forces go!”

“It seems that something big is going to happen in the universe!”

Countless people thought of this, and their hearts trembled.

Then, the news that Jian Wushuang had come out of seclusion cultivation to kill Blood Sky Ruler spread at an extremely fast speed and instantly swept the entire universe!

Immediately, the universe was in an uproar as if a heavy bomb had been dropped!

…

Divine Life Palace, Supreme Divine Palace.

“Hahaha, this kid, I knew he would succeed!”

The Ruler Blood Wave’s hearty laughter rang out from the usually solemn Hall.

This morning, the news had reached the Divine Life Palace. Jian Wushuang had killed the Hall Master of the Blood Sky Hall, the Blood Sky Supreme, in the small planetary group. The entire universe was shocked!

The Ninth Kalpa King, Supreme Giant Axe, and the core members of the Sword Union were all sitting on both sides, and they also smiled when they heard this.

Jian Wushuang is always calm when he doesn’t make a move, but when he does, it’s earth-shattering.

The Ninth Kalpa King shook his head and said. His expression was one of helplessness, but he was also happy for Jian Wushuang.

Blood Sky Ruler is considered an expert among the top-tier Rulers. Even I found it difficult to deal with him. I didn’t expect Jian Wushuang to be able to kill him by himself.

Supreme Giant Axe sighed with emotion. He then turned to look at Ruler Blood Wave and laughed,

“Blood Wave, I’m afraid Jian Wushuang’s power is no longer less than yours and mine.”

The Ruler Blood Wave nodded with a smile and replied, “That’s right. In my opinion, it won’t take long for Jian Wushuang to grow to the point where he can protect my Divine Life Palace.”

This kid’s talent is too shocking.

The Supreme martial artists chatted and laughed with each other. However, the Overlord of the Sword Union seemed to have thought of something, and his expression was a little worried.

Upon seeing this, the Ruler Blood Wave couldn’t help but tease, “Little friend Overlord, what are you worried about? Could it be that you still can’t get over the fact that Jian Wushuang didn’t bring you along with him?”

Hearing this, the Overlord quickly collected his thoughts and replied, “No. Since the alliance leader did this, he must have his own considerations.

“Oh? Then, little friend Overlord, why do you look so worried?”

The Ruler Blood Wave couldn’t help but be surprised.

The great Overlord took a deep breath and cupped his hands. Ruler Blood Wave, everyone knows that the alliance leader killed the Blood Sky Ruler. Many people have already expected that the alliance leader wants to find the six great forces one by one. I’m afraid that the other forces have already made preparations. I’m worried that Lord Alliance leader will fall into an ambush.”

The Ruler Blood Wave didn’t look as worried as the Overlord had imagined. Instead, he patted the Overlord’s shoulder and looked through the entrance of the Supreme divine Hall into the distant void.

“Little friend Overlord, don’t worry. Whatever you can think of, Jian Wushuang will naturally think of it as well. We don’t need to care about this. We just need to wait here for Jian Wushuang’s good news.”

Hearing this, the Overlord was stunned. Then, he said with a bitter smile, “That’s true.”

…

As the news of Jian Wushuang killing the Blood Sky Ruler spread, the originally peaceful universe was once again in turmoil.

In the depths of the universe, in the Great Void Temple.

Bang!

Supreme Bing Ye smashed the armrest of his throne into pieces with a single slap. His face was ashen as he said, “Bastard! We haven’t even gone to find trouble with Jian Wushuang, but he dares to find trouble with us? Does he really think he’s a big shot?”

Supreme Bing Ye’s voice was filled with rage.

Below him, less than 10% of the Supreme martial artists who had been sitting in the hall were left. There were only two or three small cats left.

“Hall Master, please calm your anger.”

A Supreme-being from the Great Void Temple comforted.

As soon as these words were spoken, the already unsightly expression on Supreme Bing Ye’s face became even more unsightly.

“I’ve said it many times. I’m now the divine Emperor of the Great Void Temple, not the Hall Master.” Supreme Bing Ye shot him a cold look.

Hearing this, the Supreme martial artists looked at each other and sighed.

Ever since Supreme Bing Ye failed to kill Jian Wushuang and was humiliated by the white-haired ancestor, he had become more temperamental.

“I know.”

The Supreme martial artist nodded, then said with a slightly worried tone, “Sir Emperor God, now that Jian Wushuang has grown up, I’m afraid he will come to our door in a few days. It’s better for us to be prepared.”

“Make early preparations? With just Jian Wushuang?” Supreme Bing Ye sneered contemptuously upon hearing this and shook his head.

...

“Do you think I’m that trash, Blood Sky? Would I be afraid of Jian Wushuang? Hmph, it’s fine if he doesn’t come, but if he dares to come, I’ll make sure he won’t be able to return!” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“This…”

When the Supreme martial artists heard this, hesitation flashed across their faces. They felt that Supreme Bing Ye was too conceited.

Supreme Bing Ye saw through their thoughts and snorted coldly,”I think you’re all scared out of your wits by Jian Wushuang. No matter how strong he is, he’s only a beginner Supreme. What a disgrace!”

After casting a cold glance at the Supreme martial artists, Supreme Bing Ye strode out.

In the hall, the few Supreme-beings could not help but laugh bitterly. After looking at each other, they felt that Jian Wushuang alone would not cause any trouble for the Great Void Temple. After all, besides Supreme Bing Ye’s half-step unrivaled cultivation, they still had other trump cards.

At the thought of this, they heaved a sigh of relief. However, for some reason, they still felt an inexplicable sense of uneasiness.
