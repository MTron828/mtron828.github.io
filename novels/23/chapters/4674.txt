4675 Immortal From Above the Heavens, Ding Baiyi (1)

Devouring Emperor, one of the people who pushed the two universes to fight to the death, had been killed!

The mysterious Devourers also disappeared into the sky as if they had never been there.

However, the death of Devouring Emperor did not make anyone feel good.

Old Master’s brows were tightly furrowed, and his face had never been so serious before.

Jian Wushuang’s mind was in a mess. This was not the first time he had heard news about Xuan Yi from outsiders. However, every time, it would stop at the beginning and end abruptly.

“Master, what kind of existence are you!? Why can’t I get any news of you even though I’ve already reached the peak of the Dao?” Jian Wushuang looked at the void and suddenly felt a little weak.

“Old Master, I’m a little tired.” He slowly closed his eyes.

Old Master turned to look at him and nodded. “Let’s go back then.”

“No, as long as the Void Universe is not eliminated, the Divine Power Universe will be like a thorn in my back. I don’t want my juniors to be shrouded in the shadow anymore.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with determination, “I will eliminate the biggest threat for my juniors!”

However, in the next moment, a wave of chaotic and vast aura swept over the broken sky like a light mist.

However, this chaotic aura only existed for a moment before it disappeared completely.

However, everyone could sense this aura that had come from nowhere and disappeared.

Jian Wushuang’s heart trembled and he could not help but look at Old Master.

A moment later, Old Master said in a deep voice, “The Spring of Chaos spring has loosened.”

“Retreat!” Jian Wushuang didn’t dare to delay any further and immediately gave the order to retreat.

Without any hesitation, all the Supreme experts released their divine power, turned around, and rushed in the direction of the Divine Power Universe.

The Spring of Chaos, the symbol of the extreme point of the Divine Power Universe, was the weakest place. Every time it loosened, it would bring great terror.

At the same time, no one knew where the Spring of Chaos would lead to, and even Old Master was extremely afraid of it.

Jian Wushuang could not imagine what would happen if the Spring of Chaos was opened again.

Devouring Emperor’s dark light and words before he died had made him feel a sense of fear.

After the retreat of the army of Supremes, the place where Devouring Emperor had been killed began to show fine black patterns.

…

Two years later, Jian Wushuang and the others stepped into the Offworld Battlefield from the Void Universe and went straight to the Divine Life Palace.

The Divine Life Palace, which protected the entire Divine Power Universe, was still peaceful.

Thereafter, the Vice Hall Master Supreme Dao Yan brought over ten disciples and rushed out of the palace. He cupped his hands and said, “Disciple greets Cosmos God.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and then asked, “In the past few decades, has there been anything strange in the universe?”

Dao Yan pondered for a moment, then shook his head and said, “Everything is as usual. There is nothing unusual. However, there have been special energy fluctuations in the vicinity of Rodu Star Field in recent years. The disciples I sent to investigate have yet to return.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang immediately said, “All the Supremes are to guard the Cloud Palace. All the Half Ancestors are to come with me.”

No one had any objections. The army of Supreme experts, which had not suffered many casualties, stayed where they were. Jian Wushuang led the group of Half Ancestors and rushed to Rodu Star Field.

After all these incidents, the Rodu Galaxy had been raised to the highest level of vigilance. There were nearly 1000 Invincible Supreme martial artists taking turns to guard the place.

They would take turns every thousand years, and it had been millions of years.

However, now, the further they went, the weaker the divine power of the Invincible Paragon became, almost undetectable.

“Damn it, please don’t let anything be wrong.” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself and sped up.

Everyone heaved a sigh of relief when the shattered Rodu Star Field returned to normal.

The thousands of Invincible Supremes who were stationed there all flew out of the city and came before Jian Wushuang. “Greetings, Cosmos God.”

“Are there any abnormalities in the Spring of Chaos?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes.” The leading Supreme said, “Replying to Cosmos Gods, there hasn’t been anything unusual for the past million years.”

Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh of relief in his heart. However, before he could speak, the Spring of Chaos that had been in a state of silence suddenly gushed out an earth-shaking energy.

The domineering aura that could easily suppress divine power was like a boundless galaxy that filled the entire sky.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang immediately released his Ancestor realm divine power, which turned into a barrier and blocked all the Invincible Supremes behind him.

At the same time, Old Master beside him murmured softly, “They are here.”

The barrier formed by the Ancestor realm divine power was almost instantly covered with cracks. Under the earth-shaking energy, it only lasted for a moment before completely collapsing.

Old Master then raised his black scepter to block the attack, barely managing to resist the mighty energy.

All the Half Ancestors present were shocked. Jian Wushuang and Old Master had to join hands to resist it. What kind of almighty being could emit such energy?

He did not dare to be careless and focused his eyes on the center of the blazing energy.

The next moment, a young man with sword-like eyebrows and starry eyes walked out slowly. The rules of the Great Dao of the Divine Power Universe were very repulsive, but they turned into powder when they got close to him.

His long hair, which was casually tied behind his back, fluttered in the wind, and he looked like an Immortal who had come out of the world. He was extremely elegant.

Jian Wushuang’s mood instantly fell to the bottom. He could feel that the energy was not weaker than that of Devouring Emperor, and might even be stronger!

The channel of the Spring of Chaos closed slowly, but the energy of the galaxy filling the sky did not decrease at all. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

As for the young man who descended from the Spring of Chaos, he first sized up the universe he was in. Then, he stretched out his palm to feel his own energy and finally looked at Jian Wushuang and the others.

He looked at Old Master for a moment and was a little confused. But in the end, he stopped at Jian Wushuang.

Then, he slowly stretched out his palm and pointed at Jian Wushuang, “I am very familiar with your aura. Was it you who barged into the Great Yan Domain millions of years ago?”

As soon as he heard this, Old Master’s eyes widened. He had never lost his composure like this before. “You’ve been to the Great Yan Domain?!”

When Jian Wushuang heard the three words ‘Great Yan Domain’, he instantly understood.

The majestic world that had been swept into the space-time turbulence by accident and laid there for 500,000 years was the Great Yan Domain.

“Back then, I was swept into the space-time turbulence and entered a large realm. I think it should be called the Great Yan Domain,” Jian Wushuang said to Old Master in a low voice.
