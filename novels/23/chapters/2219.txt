Chapter 2220 Blood Slave

“This He Xiu is definitely the lineal disciple of the Sword Emperor. He is extremely powerful.”“If this continues, the four of us might be defeated by him.”

The more the four sir gods from the Real Martial Arts Divine Church fought, the more surprised they were at He Xiu’s battle power.

“We have no choice. Use the Blood Slaves,” one of the sir god said coldly.

The other three nodded their heads in approval.

The sir god waved his hands as two figures which radiated enormous amounts of blood qi appeared in the sky above.

“Huh?”

He Xiu focused his eyes before staring at one of the figures.

He was looking at a pale,weak and skinny elder man. The aura this man radiated was at the level of emperor god.

“Emperor God Ling Qu!” He Xiu was shocked.

This weak and elder man was Emperor God Ling Qu from Lineage of Stars. He was the one who had gone missing after reaching this place.

No one had expected him to appear so suddenly. Even though his aura was still at the level of an emperor god, the vibes he had were completely different.

“What happened? What did you do to Emperor God Ling Qu?” He Xiu asked.

“Haha. What happened to him? We just made him into a blood slave. Don’t worry, you will become like him soon,” the sir gods from the Real Martial Martial Arts Divine Church laughed. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

He Xiu looked dark.

He could see that Emperor God Ling Qu and the other peak sir god had lost their own consciousness and were staring at him in a hostile manner.

In the tarven far away:

“Are they under soul control?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes as he studied the two figures who radiated large amounts of blood qi.

“No. Even if they are under soul control, their vitality signs would be there and the vibes they give would be like any other human’s. However, these two people here have no vitality signs at all. It is as though they are battle puppets!”

“Battle puppets...”

Jian Wushuang had already realised that Emperor God Ling Qu and the other peak sir god had been made into battle puppets using certain weird techniques.

To forcefully make an emperor god into a battle puppet was much more cruel than soul control.

“Looks like my deductions are right. There are people supporting them. And these people come from...” Jian Wushuang started to think to himself.

On the battlefield.

“Blood slave, kill him!”

The sir god from the Real Martial Arts Divine Church ordered.

The two blood slaves did not hesitate and attacked He Xiu.

One of the battle puppets was an emperor god while the other was a peak sir god. This was a much more powerful line up compared to the four sir gods from the Real Martial Arts Divine Church.

Emperor God Ling Qu was already very powerful among the emperor gods. After he had become a blood slave, his battle power had become one level higher and he could put heavy pressure on He Xiu.

“I cannot fend off Emperor God Ling Qu alone.”

He Xiu knew this clearly. Hence, when Emperor God Ling Qu moved, he waved his hands and summoned four figures who were in grey armour.

These four figures were four silver armour dao soldiers.

Jian Wushuang deliberately told He Xiu to bring these dao soldiers along before they set off.

Any one of the four silver armor dao soldiers had the power of an ordinary emperor god, though they lacked fighting techniques. However, four of such dao soldiers could still stop Emperor God Ling Qu easily.

As long as Emperor God Ling Qu was stopped, He Xiu could take care of the last peak sir god easily.

The battle continued at the centre of the town. It became increasingly fierce.

Initially, the four sir gods were pleased when they had just brought out the blood slave. However, that changed when they saw that He Xiu had deployed the four dao soldiers which had stopped Emperor God Ling Qu.

“He Xiu brought four silver armour dao soldiers?”

“This is troublesome. With the four silver armor dao soldiers, there is nothing we can do even if we have two blood slaves.”

“Quick, update what happened here to the church master. Let him make the decision.”

The four sir gods messaged Emperor God Bai Xing immediately.

Within the headquarters of the Real Martial Arts Divine Church.

“As expected, things are not so simple. We only know that He Xiu has four dao silver armour dao soldiers. If I am not wrong, there are other experts hiding in the dark, or he has other tricks up his sleeves.” Emperor God Bai Xing was not surprised when he received the message.

“There is nothing the two blood slaves and Mo Qiu and friends can do in this situation. Even if I was there, the experts from Lineage of Stars would intercept me. If this is the case, I shall ask the lords for help.”

Emperor God Bai Xing no longer hesitated and went to look for the lords immediately.

Within one of the quiet palaces.

“Lord.”

Emperor God Bai Xing stood respectfully in front of the middle-aged man in silvery, loose robes.

“What is the matter?” The middle-aged man raised his head and looked at Emperor God Bai Xing. His attitude was extremely cold.

Emperor God Bai Xing was only an emperor god. Back in the ancient past, he had just been an ordinary expert in the middle stage chaotic realm. The middle-aged man would not take him seriously.

The middle-aged man would not even take the entire Real Martial Arts Divine Church.

If not for his special addiction to virgin blood and his elder brothers needing resources, he would not have had any interactions with the Real Martial Arts Divine Church.

“Lord. Previously, you made Emperor God Ling Qu into a blood slave. The clan he was from, Lineage of Stars, sent experts here. They are now at one of the towns outside of the Real Martial Arts Divine Church and are fighting with the experts from our church. They might not be able to hold on for long,” Emperor God Bai Xing said carefully.

The middle-aged man had a calm manner.

The Real Martial Arts Divine Church did search for certain resources under the command of him and his two brothers. He knew that the method that the church had used would definitely provoke other clans. Hence, they had agreed that they would help if the church encountered any problems.

When Emperor God Ling Qu first reached the territory belonging to the Real Martial Arts Divine Church, the middle-aged man settled him personally.

“This is quite annoying. How many people did Lineage of Stars send, and what realms are they in?” The middle-aged man asked casually.

“From what we know, they only sent one sir god named He Xiu,” Emperor God Bai Xing said.

“This is ridiculous. You ask me to help you to deal with a sir god? Are the people from the Real Martial Arts Divine Church all useless?” The middle-aged man roared in anger.

“Lord, please calm down. Even though he is a sir god, he is a genius, his fighting power is that of an ordinary emperor god. Furthermore, he brought along four silver armour dao soldiers...” Emperor God Bai Xing quickly explained.
