Chapter 1763: Soaring Heaven Mansion

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The Soaring Heaven Mansion was a giant city.

A wise old man had brought his disciple outside the Soaring Heaven Mansion.

“My disciple, listen to this. When you enter the Soaring Heaven Mansion later on, you must be extremely careful in whatever you do. Even if you were to get in a disagreement with someone else, do your best to bear with it. One more thing. You must absolutely not break the rules of the Soaring Heaven Mansion. If not, no one will be able to save you,” the wise old man warned.

“Master, our Five Spirit Sect is a big sect in the Sea Continent. Moreover, you are an Elder of our sect. Hence, even if it were the Soaring Heaven King Palace, they would give you some face. Thus, is there a need for us to be so careful?” the red-robed young lady who was the disciple of the wise old man said.

“You fool. How can our Five Spirit Sect be compared to the Soaring Heaven King Palace? If the Soaring Heaven King Palace were to send out an Almighty, it would be enough to destroy the Five Spirit Sect,” the wise old man said in a deep voice. “In addition, the Soaring Heaven Mansion is a big base of the Soaring Heaven King Palace in the Sea Continent. Here, the Soaring Heaven King Palace has absolute power and they are God!”

“Therefore, who would dare to go against the rules that they have set here?”

“Don’t say that I am an Elder of the Five Spirit Sect. Even if the Sect Master or Great Elder were to come here personally, as soon as they break the rules of the Soaring Heaven King Palace, the Soaring Heaven King Palace will also take action and kill them without hesitation.”

“They are that unreasonable?” the red-robed young lady was shocked. At the same time, she could not help but ask: “When will our Five Spirit Sect catch up to the Soaring Heaven King Palace?”

“Catch up to the Soaring Heaven King Palace?”

The wise old man became stunned for some time. After that, he shook his head and sighed lightly: “The Soaring Heaven King Palace is a super powerhouse and it is a great deterrent in the Eternal Chaotic World. Hence, it is a powerful overlord. Take the Soaring Heaven Mansion as an example. The Soaring Heaven Mansion is only a portion of the Soaring Heaven King Palace’s power. Moreover, even though it has been in the Sea Continent for many years, no one dared to provoke it. Therefore, how much power do you think it possesses?”

“Catching up to such a kind of super powerhouse… haha. Let’s wait for an Almighty to be born in our Five Spirit Sect first before we think of this. As for now, we are too far away.”

As he spoke, the two of them came before the door of the Soaring Heaven Mansion.

Over there, there were quite a number of cultivators from each and every corner of the Sea Continent and they were all queuing up to enter the Soaring Heaven Mansion.

“There’s so many people,” the red-robed young lady was looking at the long queue in front of her.

“The Soaring Heaven Mansion’s first rule is that it forbids flying. If we wish to enter the mansion, we will have to enter through the door obediently. As a form of respect to the Soaring Heaven King Palace, no one dares to break the rules that the Soaring Heaven King Palace has set,” the wise old man said.

“Impressive,” the red-robed young lady exclaimed with admiration.

However, just then, a crimson-robed figure came over quickly from the void behind them. Moreover, he swept through the void, over the wise old man and the red-robed young lady.

“Eh?” The red-robed young lady revealed a surprised expression, “Master, didn’t you say that flying is forbidden in the Soaring Heaven Mansion? But this person…”

“This is weird. Even if it were experts of the Soaring Heaven King Palace who need to queue to enter the Soaring Heaven Mansion, they would normally stop when they reached the entrance of the mansion. As for this person…” the wise old man frowned.

It was not just the two of them. Many cultivators before the Soaring Heaven Mansion who were queuing to enter the mansion had also witnessed the arrival of the crimson-robed figure.

The crimson-robed figure ignored everyone and flew straight to the front. In the end, he was stopped by a giant formation which covered the Soaring Heaven Mansion.

“A formation?” Jian Wushuang laughed indifferently.

Every powerhouse and sect had their own big protective formation. The formation was probably extremely powerful.

The Soaring Heaven Mansion was equivalent to the second base of the Soaring Heaven King Palace. Hence, it naturally had a big protective formation.

Clang!

The sword that Jian Wushuang was carrying on his back had left its scabbard. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“He has drawn his sword!”

“Drawing his sword in front of the entrance of the Soaring Heaven Mansion? What is he trying to do?”

“Who is this person?”

Many cultivators before the door of the mansion looked at Jian Wushuang with great surprise.

They had absolutely no idea what Jian Wushuang was trying to do.

It was only when Divine Power emerged from the body of Jian Wushuang and a shocking sword essence spread in all directions that the expressions of the cultivators who were present changed.

Jian Wushuang had already swung the Blood Mountain Sword in his hands.

Swish!

A gigantic sword light which contained power that could destroy the world struck the big protective formation of the Soaring Heaven Mansion with fury directly.

“The sword has struck the big formation!”

“He is actually attacking the big formation?”

“Is he crazy?”

Many cultivators who were present were extremely terrified.

“Master, didn’t you say that for many years, no one dared to provoke the Soaring Heaven Mansion?” the red-robed young lady asked her own Master.

“Who knows? This person is probably crazy. Even though he is only a Real God, he still dared to attack the big protective formation of the Soaring Heaven King Palace. He is really courting death,” the wise old man said in a deep voice.

However, just when his words left his mouth:

Boom!!!

A loud booming sound resounded across the universe and frightening power spread across all directions like tidewater.

The power was so great that many cultivators who were present became visibly moved and they revealed terrified expressions.

The Soaring Heaven Mansion’s giant protective formation then shook madly.

“What?”

“The Soaring Heaven Mansion’s protective formation is actually shaking?”

“A Real God only unleashed one stroke and it actually managed to shake the big protective formation of the Soaring Heaven Mansion?”

The cultivators who were present found it unbelievable.

However, at that moment, Jian Wushuang was squinting his eyes. After that, his sword essence, which was already unreasonable and shocking to begin with, achieved a whole new level again.

He unleashed the Divine Power in his body without holding back.

The Blood Mountain Sword in his hands were shaking and a great amount of Reincarnation Power burst forth.

“Reincarnation Sword Principle, First Move!”

Buzz!

Sword light was swung again and this time around, the sword light was not as big as before. Instead, it was more dazzling.

As soon as the sword light appeared, the dazzling light caused many cultivators, as well as the Real Gods who were present, to have no choice but to close their eyes.

The sword light struck the big formation and the big formation, which was already shaking crazily and was on the verge of collapsing to begin with, gave off a violent booming sound. The big formation then split open and fell apart completely.

“The big formation has been broken through?”

Everyone opened their eyes wide and they were looking at the scene with disbelief.

The Soaring Heaven Mansion had existed for many years in the Sea Continent and it had terrorized all the powerhouses with fear. As such, it was a leviathan-level super existence. Moreover, the protective formation that it had deployed was extremely powerful and it was said that even normal Almighties were unable to break the big formation apart with force. However, at that moment, the big formation had been destroyed by a Real God in two strokes!!

As soon as the big formation collapsed, the Soaring Heaven Mansion was no longer covered up and it was completely exposed in front of Jian Wushuang.

Upon seeing that, Jian Wushuang wore a bloodthirsty smile. An ice-cold voice then came out of his mouth and reverberated across the area.

“Soaring Heaven King Palace, I have come… to demand the repayment of a debt!”
