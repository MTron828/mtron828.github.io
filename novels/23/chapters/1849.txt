Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“No wonder?” Sir God Chi Feng looked confused. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The white-robed woman smiled but didn’t reply. Then, she flipped her hand and there was a token.

“Mother, this is…?” Sir God Chi Feng looked at the token.

“This is the communication token of the Master of Star Palace. For the past three thousand years, I sent many messages to the Master of Star Palace. He replied to me with a few messages in the beginning. Then, for the past two thousand years, he didn’t reply at all,” the white-robed woman said.

“No reply?” Sir God Chi Feng was surprised. “The Master of Star Palace even visited Mother personally to ask Mother to set up a formation for him. He should be making preparations for an opportunity in the Ancient Mystery Land. All these years, he has been staying in Ancient Mystery Land. You sent him messages but he didn’t reply? Could he be fully concentrated in some sort of opportunity or could he be carried away with comprehension?”

“Carried away?” The white-robed woman smiled.

“In the beginning, I thought so too. As he went in for an opportunity and he prepared so meticulously beforehand, it would be normal if he received an opportunity in Ancient Mystery Land. But later on, about three hundred years ago, I sent him another message but he still didn’t reply. That’s a little strange. Because he and I have an agreement that he would rush to mine three hundred years ago and he would complete one task on my behalf. It was also a condition for me to agree to set up the formation for him.”

“The Master of Star Palace is a good person and his reputation is great. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have promised him back then. However, when it was our agreed time and he didn’t come here, he didn’t even send me a message. That was strange. After all, even if he was carried away in the opportunity and he couldn’t rush over in time, he could at least reply and inform me.”

“Mother, what you’re trying to say is that the Master of Star Palace… has died?” Sir God Chi Feng stared.

“Previously, it was hard to say. After all, he might be in places with unique spacetime and he couldn’t send any message. However, I heard from you that Lineage of Star has been acting strange. Especially when I heard about Sword Emperor massacring in madness, I became seventy percent certain that the Master of Star Palace had died,” the white-robed woman said calmly.

“One should know that Lineage of Star has been at peace for so many years. Although they have many enemies, they never killed their enemies so wantonly before. After all, as long as the Master of Star Palace is alive, Lineage of Star’s enemies couldn’t stir any trouble. Plus, Jian Wushuang… Although he is young, he could reach where he is now as an inverse cultivator, he is definitely not stupid.”

“He should know that when the limelight is too strong, the risk is high, especially when his identity as an inverse cultivator is so sensitive. There were originally a lot of people who didn’t wish to see him grow. At such times, if it isn’t necessary, he should get stronger in silence. When his power increases and he breaks through to become an Almighty, his wings will be full-fledged and there will be almost no one who can do anything about him. He can do anything he wishes then. He would then truly be able to act wantonly, without scruples.”

“By then, it won’t be a problem for him to massacre the enemies or even major forces. But it should definitely not be now.”

Sir God Chi Feng nodded in silence. She felt that what her mother had said made sense.

Ever since Jian Wushuang’s massacre, although it had led to his bad name, it had also made everyone fearful of him.

There were a lot of people who wished for him to die. There might even be people who were preparing in silence.

It was really too risky.

“Besides, Lineage of Star has started to rope in experts with all kinds of methods… Hehe, everything I said combined, I am determined Lineage of Star definitely has a reason that made them do so. As for the reason, besides the death of the Master of Star Palace, I couldn’t think of the second,” the white-robed woman said with a smile.

Sir God Chi Feng heard her and her heart skipped a beat.

“Yes, Mother, you’re right. Only if the Master of Star Palace dies will that Lineage of Star would lose their mainstay. Under helpless circumstances, they took the initiative to kill their enemies, to exterminate them. That’s why Jian Wushuang was keeping a high profile,” Sir God Chi Feng agreed with his Mother’s conclusion.

From what she knew, Jian Wushuang had fought with Soaring Heaven King Palace back then and he had kept silent and lied low after he had been listed on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list.

He had been quiet for six thousand years.

In the six thousand years, Jian Wushuang had improved tremendously. He could totally continue to lay low and continue to improve his power.

However, with no symptoms, Lineage of Star had suddenly started massacring his enemies. It was too strange.

On top of that, the Master of Star Palace didn’t reply to any messages when the agreed time was up. The possibility of the Master of Star Palace’s death was extremely high.

“The Master of Star Palace, such a horrifying existence, he died in Ancient Mystery Land?” Sir God Chi Feng sighed.

The Master of Star Palace, although he was only on the thirty-first on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, he was considered an outstanding one among Peak Emperor Gods but not the top.

However, the experts in Sanctuary Alliance knew clearly that if the Master of Star Palace were to explode and perform Secret Skill of Star Palace without scruples, its level of scariness would be above Underworld God who was the top person among Emperor Gods.

Such an expert had died?

“Ancient Mystery Land has many opportunities but there are even more dangerous places. These places, forget about Emperor Gods like the Master of Star Palace, even a Great Emperor would die without a doubt when they enter. The Master of Star Palace only thought of being a Great Emperor to serve as a better deterrent to all forces. It was a pity that he belittled the danger. Now that he has died and lost his functions, Lineage of Star…” The white-robed woman shook her head slightly.

Sir God Chi Feng’s eyes beamed when she heard that.

One should know that Red Glow Fairy Palace and Lineage of Star were on Purple Moon Sanctuary and they weren’t too far apart. There was a conflict of interest too. If Lineage of Star were to be in danger, Red Glow Fairy Palace would receive many benefits too.

“Mother, the news about the Master of Star Palace’s death, do you think we should spread it?” Sir God Chi Feng said.

“You’re the palace master of Red Glow Fairy Palace. Do you want to hide or spread the news for Lineage of Star? It’s your decision. But one thing, even if you want to spread, it can’t be spread from Red Glow Fairy Palace. It must be done through a third person, do you understand?” The white-robed woman said.

She had a deal with the Master of Star Palace, but there was no friendship.

She had helped the Master of Star Palace to set up a formation and it was merely a deal made. Hence, she didn’t have the thought to safeguard Lineage of Star.

“I understand, I will head to Vientiane Tower now.”

Sir God Chi Feng was extremely excited.
