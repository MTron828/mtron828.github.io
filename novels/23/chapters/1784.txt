Chapter 1785: The Snow Dojo’s Disciple

“I have already sent an order down to get people to capture that lineal son of mine and he is all yours to handle,” the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom said.

Jian Wushuang tapped the chair that he was sitting on with his hands. After remaining for some time, he said, “Currently, where is Wu Cang?”

“I have gotten news that he is currently in the Dayu World. It is said that one of his good friends has gotten into some trouble over there and he went over to help him,” the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom said.

“The Dayu World?” Jian Wushuang could not help but laugh.

His hometown, the Green Fire World, was in the Dayu World. Hence, he had stayed there for quite a period of time as well.

As for Wu Cang’s good friend, Jian Wushuang knew that it was the Dayu Palace Master.

“The Dayu Palace Master is the overlord of the Dayu World. Since he has come across some trouble, does that mean that some unforeseen events have occurred in the Dayu World?” Jian Wushuang murmured and he spoke after that, “I will go to the Dayu World right away. As for the lineage son under you, I will let Wu Cang handle him after he comes back.”

“Understood,” the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom nodded his head immediately.

“Oh right. I saw the Master of Silence Gloriette of the Snow Dojo just now. Back then, when I set off from the Snow Kingdom to the Ten Sanctuaries, he was the one who gave me the map. During that time, I was indeed a little kid to him. Hence, he did not offend me just now when we were outside. As such, you must not make trouble for him. As for the Snow Dojo, I was once a disciple of the Snow Dojo. Thus, you should also treat its disciples well,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Understood,” the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom nodded his head again.

After having a simple chat, Jian Wushuang did not continue and he left at once.

“Lord, please have a safe trip,” the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom led many cultivators of the Snow Sacred Land to send Jian Wushuang off to his spaceship.

After Jian Wushuang left.

“Snow, you have heard little friend Jian Wushuang’s instructions. Therefore, you should think over how you are going to do things. If you really have no idea, you should step down from your position of Monarch,” after Sir God Tian Yuan spoke, she returned to the Tian Yuan Mystery Land immediately.

The Monarch of the Snow Kingdom had broken out in a cold sweat while standing in his position.

After Sir God Tian Xuan had left as well, the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom heaved a sigh of relief. After that, he turned his head and looked at the large number of cultivators. In the end, his attention was focused on one person.

“Master of Silence Gloriette,” the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom said.

“Monarch,” the Master of Silence Gloriette said right away.

Quite a number of the surrounding people looked at the Master of Silence Gloriette with sympathy and ridicule.

They had seen with their own eyes that the Master of Silence Gloriette had offended the Lord moments ago.

What was the position of that Lord? Even the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom trembled with fear when he saw him and the Master of Silence Gloriette had actually called him ‘little kid’ in front of so many people?

Wasn’t he courting death?

Although it was unintentional, there was no guarantee that the other party would not be concerned?

“Let’s look. Let’s look at how the Monarch will punish him!”

“After all, the Master of Silence Gloriette has a high position. Hence, the Monarch will probably not kill him. However, there will definitely be a punishment,”

Quite a number of people were thinking about that.

The Master of Silence Gloriette was also extremely fearful.

However, all of a sudden, the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom, who had been staring at him, revealed a smile, “Master of Silence Gloriette, your Snow Dojo has indeed not disappointed me. Great going!”

“What?” the Master of Silence Gloriette was stunned.

The surrounding people also looked at the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom with surprise.

Shouldn’t the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom be enraged and punish the Master of Silence Gloriette straight away? Why did he commend the Snow Dojo instead?

“Why? Don’t you understand yet?” The Monarch of the Snow Kingdom laughed, “You know that Lord from just now, right?”

“Of course I do,” the Master of Silence Gloriette nodded his head, “It was more than forty thousand years ago. To date, it should have been fifty thousand years already. Back then, he was only a Universe God and he had once represented the Snow Dojo to take part in that ranking competition. Due to his participation, the Snow Dojo was victorious in the ranking competition.”

“You’re wrong about that.” the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom laughed heartily. “That Lord is a super existence who is exceptionally talented and his power has completely exceeded your expectations. Moreover, such a super expert was actually once a disciple of your Snow Dojo? Just now, he also told me personally to treat the Snow Dojo well. This means that his impression of the Snow Dojo is not too bad. How honored do you think you are?”

The surrounding people were all dumbfounded.

The Lord from before actually came from the Snow Dojo.

Such an earth-shaking super expert had actually been born from the Snow Dojo.

“I have already made up my mind. From today now, I will give the Snow Dojo twice the amount of resources. As for the upcoming ranking competition, you just need to do your best, the end result is not important,” the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom said.

“What?” everyone was shocked again.

Especially the people from the Universe God Palace. They had finally suppressed the Snow Dojo to the point that even the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom wanted to close down the Snow Dojo.

However, at that point, just because of the arrival of an expert who was slightly related to the Snow Dojo, not only did the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom stop thinking about getting rid of the Snow Dojo, he had also decided to give them twice the amount of resources?

This was twice the amount of resources. Even when their Universe God Palace had won the ranking competition in succession for the past few years, the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom had never been so generous.

“My Snow Dojo is about to change for the better,” the Master of Silence Gloriette was extremely delighted.

It was the same for the Golden Deacons of the Snow Dojo who were at the back.

They had originally thought that it was the end of the line for the Dojo. However, in the end, due to the arrival of Jian Wushuang, the Snow Dojo had achieved its peak instantly. Moreover, its position in the mind of the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom had risen higher than never before.

It was all because of Jian Wushuang!

…

In the dark void, the silver spaceship that Jian Wushuang and the two other people were riding was moving at a shocking speed continuously.

As it was only from the Snow Sacred Land to the Dayu World, the distance was not too far. With the spaceship’s speed, they reached the Dayu World in just a few months’ time.

This time around, Jian Wushuang did not attract so much attention by riding the spaceship into the Dayu World. Instead, he stopped the spaceship outside the Dayu World. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Both of you shall wait for me here. I will be going in to greet some of my old friends,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Understood,” He Xiu and Qiu Yue nodded their heads with respect.

After that, Jian Wushuang’s body turned vague and he disappeared from the spaceship.

The Dayu World was a normal region under the Snow Kingdom.

As a normal region, their experts were normally Universe Gods of the Third Heaven.

Back then, when Jian Wushuang had been traveling in the Dayu World, everything in the Dayu World had been controlled by the Dayu Palace Master, a Universe God of the Third Heaven. Moreover, he was the only Universe God of the Third Heaven in the whole region. Hence, he was the most powerful person.

Back then, to Jian Wushuang, the Dayu Palace Master had been considered a super existence which was impossible to surpass. However, at that time… forget about a mere Universe God of the Third Heaven, even if it were Real Gods, Jian Wushuang had already killed an innumerous number of them.

After entering the Dayu World, Jian Wushuang knew that some unforeseen events had indeed occurred in the Dayu World.
