Chapter 2310 Snow Cleave

Time passed in the blink of an eye. Jian Wushuang had been staying in the Lin Mansion for three months.In the house that Jian Wushuang was staying in.

Just as Lin Yan was about to enter the garden, two people walked out from inside.

They were two experts in the Chaotic Realm.

They were chatting as they walked.

“I had never thought that there could be an expert in the Lin Mansion who would have such an incredible understanding of the Sword Doctrine. What is more amazing is that he is a child aged twelve.”

“Little friend Wushuang is really incredible. His talent in the Sword Doctrine is unmatched. Taoist Priest Xuan Shen is amazing. With this level of talent, he should be given ten times the amount of resources of a core disciple.”

The two of them chatted casually. Lin Yan could hear what they were saying clearly.

“Both of you.” Lin Yan smiled.

“Prince Yan.” The two experts in the Chaotic Realm looked over and greeted.

“Did both of you seek Brother Wushuang’s guidance in the Sword Doctrine?” Lin Yan asked.

“Yes. Both of us have learnt a lot from him,” one of the experts said.

“Yes, a lot.” The other man nodded his head in approval.

“Brother Wushuang is a guest here at the Lin Mansion. He also needs to focus on his own cultivation. You can come and ask him once in a while, but please don’t come and bother him consistently,” Lin Yan said.

“Of course.”

“We have already benefited greatly from a single session. How could we be greedy and want more?” the two experts in the Chaotic Realm said.

“That’s right. Carry on.” Lin Yan waved his hands and the two experts in the Chaotic Realm left the place.

Lin Yan then entered the garden that Jian Wushuang lived in.

After he reached the garden, he saw Lin Yi.

Jian Wushuang stood in the middle of the garden with his eyes closed. He held an ordinary sword in his hands.

“Uncle Lin Yi, what is Brother Wushuang doing?” Lin Yi asked softly.

“Looks like he is going to practice with a sword.”

“Practice?” Lin Yan raised his eyebrows. He realized that even though Jian Wushuang had been there for three months, he had only studied sword skills. He had never practiced at all.

This was the first time Lin Yan had seen Jian Wushuang use a sword for practice.

Lin Yan stood to the side quietly as he did not want to disturb Jian Wushuang.

Snowflakes filled the entire sky as they fell to the ground slowly. The floor of the entire garden was already covered with snow.

Jian Wushuang held a sword with one hand and stood at the center of the garden. He opened his eyes all of a sudden. Killing intent could be seen clearly in his eyes. The sword in his hand moved.

He thrusted the sword out like a beam of light.

It seemed like an ordinary thrust. However, ripples could be seen in the surrounding space.

It was as though the space bent because it was so affected by the sword essence.

In reality, it was not space which bent. It was spacetime.

Before the thrust landed, Jian Wushuang swung his blade out in a horizontal swing.

This horizontal swing was the sword skill that Jian Wushuang was trying to cast.

A sword light could be seen at the corner of his eyes. It was beautiful and stunning. People could lose themselves within it.

Even though the sword light seemed extremely small, it filled the entire garden, including the space right in front of Jian Wushuang.

As the sword light dimmed, peace returned to the garden.

Jian Wushuang sheathed his sword.

“What... what sword skill was that? I am completely lost.” Lin Yan knitted his eyebrows. He could not understand the essence of the sword skill that Jian Wushuang had just done.

However, he could feel how terrifying the move was.

“Uncle Lin Yi, do you understand what just happened?” Lin Yan looked over and Lin Yi and asked.

“I could not understand it completely, but I realized something,” Lin Yi said.

“What did you realize?” Lin Yan asked.

“Have you not realized that the amount of snowflakes around our dear friend Wushuang has become more dense?” Lin Yi a said.

“Oh yes, that’s true. What happened?” Lin Yi asked curiously.

“If I am not wrong, Wushuang sliced all of the snowflakes falling from the sky in half. This created the illusion that the snowflakes on the ground became denser. The sword light is incredibly powerful, and the snowflake is extremely frail. It will melt easily. However, he managed to slice all of the snowflakes in half without melting them. How incredible is his control of the sword essence and power of that sword skill?”

“He is that incredible?” Lin Yan widened his eyes in shock.

“That sword swing, that swing...” Lin Yi clenched his fists and closed his eyes as the scene where the snowflakes were sliced in half played repeatedly in his mind.

“Uncle Lin Yi, what happened to you?” Lin Yan asked.

“Do not disturb him,” Jian Wushuang said as he walked over. “It seems like he has managed to learn and understand something new.”

“Learn something new?” Lin Yan nodded his head and stood there quietly, waiting for his uncle.

After a few minutes, Lin Yi opened his eyes. He looked extremely happy.

He took a deep breath and bowed to Jian Wushuang before turning and leaving.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Looks like the Lin Family is finally going to have an expert who meets the criteria for the Sword Doctrine Realm.”

Lin Yan also realized that Lin Yi was going to have a breakthrough in his understanding of the Sword Doctrine.

That was why Lin Yi had left without saying anything. He was going into isolation to train.

“Brother Wushuang, what is the sword skill that you just cast? It looks foreign to me,” Lin Yan said.

“That sword skill... is called Snow Cleave. I created this style after fully understanding and mastering Sword Principle Snow Congelation,” Jian Wushuang said.

He had been studying the Sword Principle Snow Congelation for three months. He had managed to master this sword skill completely.

He had created Snow Cleave after gathering the essence from Sword Principle Snow Congelation and combining it with the Power of Spacetime.

“I finally created my own style in the Spacetime Sword Principle after I did the same for the Reincarnation Sword Principle.”Jian Wushuang smiled.

His understanding of the Spacetime Rules of Order and Reincarnation Rules of Order was profound. He had a better understanding of Reincarnation Rules of Order due to the miniature reincarnation, which allowed him to create a style in the Reincarnation Sword Principle... Samsara.

Jian Wushuang had never been able to perfectly combine his understanding of the Spacetime Rules of Order and the Sword Doctrine to create a new sword skill.

He had finally managed to do so today by creating Snow Cleave.
