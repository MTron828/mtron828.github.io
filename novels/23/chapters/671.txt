“Swoosh!”

A dazzling and splendid bright purple light lit up the sky.

Behind it was a terrifying killing intent sought to destroy everything.

Jian Wushuang held his sword up with both hands and swung it at two Puppet Fighters rushing toward him. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Puppet Fighters’ spears also struck out to meet the sword.

Clang! Clang!

Two crashes were heard, one after the other, and the spears were shattered. However, Jian Wushuang did not stop attacking them and finally defeated them.

Jian Wushuang then moved toward the rest of the Puppet Fighters. Strike after strike, he displayed a brilliant swordsmanship that the Puppet Fighters could barely fight back against.

A short while later, he passed the 25th floor and moved onto the next one.

The senior experts in the hall all looked amazed when they saw Jian Wushuang’s performance on the 25th floor.

“His power is so formidable.”

“The skill he displayed just now should be a Superior Rank Three Secret Skill.”

“Wow, even those who have comprehended the fourth Occult, like Luo Yong and Dong’er, can’t create a skill at that level, but Jian Wushuang actually did it. His cultivation in Sword Principle is amazingly high.”

One could create Secret Skills based on their comprehension of the Dao and weapons.

Jian Wushuang might be weaker than Luo Yong and Dong’er in comprehending the Dao, but his cultivation of Sword Principle was far above theirs. That was why he could create the Superior Rank Three Secret Skill, Violet Devastation Sword Skill. It was the most powerful move that he could currently perform.

On the 26th floor of the Ninth Heaven Road, Jian Wushuang faced 10 Puppet Fighters again, that were even more powerful than the previous ones.

The moment the 10 Puppet Fighters started moving, Jian Wushuang was suppressed. They attacked him with impressive teamwork and forced him to continuously retreat.

“He is losing ground.”

“Of course he is. Every Puppet Fighter on this floor is as powerful as a novice Divine Realm expert and only someone above the level of an intermediate Divine Realm expert could withstand their attacks. He is only in the Skyscraping Realm, so it’s already very impressive for him to make it this far.”

“The 26th floor will be his limit. ”

The experts sighed.

Previously, they all thought that Jian Wushuang could make it to the 25th floor at best and that the 26th floor was beyond his reach.

Xuan Yi had not shown any feelings towards Jian Wushuang’s situation yet. He just stared at him in silence while thinking,?“Boy, show me how far you can go.”

Under the Puppet Fighters’ powerful attacks, Jian Wushuang was like a drowned mouse.

“It looks it’s time for me to go all out,”?He thought while narrowing his eyes. Then, in the next instant, there was a sudden increase in his physical strength.

“Piss off!”

He struck at the Puppet Fighter in front of him and forced it down, causing the Puppet Fighter to hit the ground and roll across the floor.

Jian Wushuang then turned his sword towards the other Puppet Fighters and struck out at them like lighting.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

After several sounds of metal colliding against metal, he beat them back a bit.

“Violet Cataclysm Skill!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled and a purple light lit up the sky again. He forced another three Puppet Fighters to retreat.

In just a moment, the 10 Puppet Fighters surrounded him were all beaten back.

“I have been suppressing my power ever since I came to the Eternal World. Not even once have I ever exposed my power to others during the last two years in the Ancient Sect, until this moment.

“It feels good to be able to go all out after so long.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists and felt the power surging within him.

He had a flawless foundation and could release more power than others at the same level as him. Because of this, his body was stronger than other Skyscraping Realm experts.

Overall, this made him more powerful than others. Even when compared to Divine Realm experts, he was just a little bit weaker.

He had restrained his power this whole time, even when he fought with Gong Chao in the Firmament Territory Feast.

Only now, on the 26th floor of the Ninth Heaven Road, did he finally show his full power.

“For fear of arousing others’ suspicion, I had hidden my real power from the prying eyes and ears at the Firmament Territory Feast.

“But now, things are different!

“I have to show more power so I can get more resources from the sect.

“And the people here won’t know that my incredible power is because of my foundation. To be precise, they won’t be able to tell that I have a perfect foundation.”

Before taking part in the Sect Competition, Jian Wushuang had decided that he would do his utmost in order to obtain more resources from the sect.

“Come on.”

Jian Wushuang was thrilled. He held his sword in one hand and gazed at the Puppet Fighters with his overwhelming battle intent.

“Kill!”

He shouted and dived forward.

The 10 Puppet Fighters rushed toward him as well. An instant later, he was locked in an intense fight with them again. However, this time, he had the upper hand.

When he attacked, there was a terrifying power behind every one of his exquisitemoves. He knocked his opponents away with the full exertion of his power, his comprehension of the Dao, and his skill.

He was at the peak of his battle strength!
