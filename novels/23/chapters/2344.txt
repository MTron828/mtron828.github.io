Chapter 2345: Luo Xinqin’s Conjecture

“Xinqin, even if what you said is right, that his growth is full of mysteries and his maturity is way beyond an ordinary person’s, what would this prove?” Zhuo Yunfeng was puzzled.

“Husband, I heard of a legend.” Luo Xinqin looked to Zhuo Yunfeng before continuing, “It is said that the super existence that stood at the top of our Absolute Beginning Divine World is known as the Master of Holy Land. They have amazing means that can even shock the world. With a single thought, numerous experts can be annihilated. With a single sentence, trillions of Divine Demons will bow down in submission. Some even say they could communicate with Heaven’s Will, reverse space-time and even resurrect the dead!”

“Besides that, it is said that once someone reaches a certain level of strength and is facing limitations in making a further advancement, they can request the experts at the level of the Master of Holy Land to open up a reincarnation passage. From there, they will be reincarnated and reborn in this world!”

“Reincarnated?” Zhuo Yunfeng was stupefied. “You are saying our Shuang was sent back to this world by an expert that stands at the top of our Absolute Beginning Divine World?”

“That’s just my guess, but I think it’s very likely. From what I read in the ancient text, the explanation of reincarnation is that once the process is successful, one will lose all his strength and have to start cultivating from the very beginning. However, one will keep all the memories of the previous lifetime, including the Rules of Order and understanding of the Sword Principle that one has mastered. In other words, other than their cultivation base, other aspects of one’s strength will remain at their peak state from the previous life.”

“Under such circumstances, one can cultivate extremely quickly. This is because one won’t face any bottleneck and just needs the accumulation of divine power. This can also explain why Shuang has been able to reach the Chaotic Realm in less than twenty years and why his understanding of Sword Principle and Rules of Order is so insanely high.”

“As for why he can kill Divine Demon Realm experts as an Early Stage Chaotic Realm, it’s also reasonable.”

“This is because he might be an expert that stands at the top of Absolute Beginning Divine World and have means that far exceed what we can imagine. Similarly, this might be the reason why he never wanted to join those sects when he was young. Those that you have chosen for him are just known within the Wusha Barren Region and the strongest is only Chaotic Divine Demon or an expert above this level. A sect like this won’t attract the attention of Shuang,” Luo Xinqin said.

She was reasonable in her conjecture and extremely close to the truth.

For example, it was a known fact that Jian Wushuang wasn’t interested in those sects.

However, what she didn’t know was that Jian Wushuang wasn’t reincarnated from the elite experts of Absolute Beginning Divine World. He had only been at the Peak Chaotic Realm in his previous life as well. In the end, he had only made the breakthrough to the Chaotic Divine Demon after he had made his way to the reincarnation passage. Therefore, one wouldn’t say he had had a high cultivation base in his previous life.

The reason why he was so strong was because of his understanding of Sword Principle and Rules of Order. However, more importantly, it was because he was a Perfect Chaotic Lifeform! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“No, I still can’t believe this.”

Upon hearing Luo Xinqin, Zhuo Yunfeng shook his head profusely. “What you have said is just too mysterious. Master of Holy Land? An expert that is resurrected after death? Reincarnation? Those are just legends and might not be real. How can we be sure that Shuang is reincarnated from an elite expert with just these conjectures?”

“This... I can’t be sure as well. I’m just basing my conjecture on some observations. As for the aspects of reincarnation, I saw them in an ancient book. However, I’m not sure if the records are true or false. Perhaps I’m just overthinking.” Luo Xinqin chuckled but turned serious suddenly. “Regardless of if my guess is right or wrong, whether Shuang is the reincarnation of an expert, he’s still my son! I carried him for nine years, nine months and nine days before giving birth to him, and he calls me his mother!”

“Yeah, regardless of the secrets surrounding him or if he truly has some incredible background, he’s still our child and will always be.” Zhuo Yunfeng also nodded his head with conviction.

Neither of them would doubt their own child.

Even if Jian Wushuang seemed a little extraordinary, they would still recognize Jian Wushuang as their child.

“Alright, it isn’t early now. Let’s get some rest,” Zhuo Yunfeng said lovingly.

“You too.” Luo Xinqin smiled sweetly and both of them fell asleep soon after.

...

In a huge mansion, many experts from the Zhuge Family had gathered together.

However, regardless of if they were experts from Zhuge Family or Elder Chen and others from Dongzuo Sect, they all looked extremely bitter.

“We have failed!”

“To annihilate Lin Family, our Zhuge Family planned meticulously for years. We even hired the Xiang Family without regard for the cost. Yet, we returned in defeat because of a brat that isn’t twenty years old! Even the Ancient Elder died in that battle!!” Zhuge Yuanchong clenched his fist tightly. His razor-sharp fingernails even sunk into his flesh and blood was oozing out.

The experts from the Zhuge Family exchanged glances and shook their heads.

“Jian Wushuang! It’s all because of Jian Wushuang!” Zhuge Hong bellowed.

Although he hadn’t participated in that battle, he had been watching it from afar. He knew what had happened in that battle.

“Initially, our Zhuge Family was about to annihilate the Lin Family with the Xiang Family. In the end, Jian Wushuang stepped in and all our efforts went to waste. He even killed the Ancient Elder. Jian Wushuang must die!!” Zhuge Hong growled.

“Don’t be rash,” Elder Chen interjected.

“What? Elder Chen, could it be you are saying Jian Wushuang shouldn’t be killed?” Zhuge Hong looked over.

The experts of the Zhuge Family, including Zhuge Yuanchong, also turned to Elder Chen.

Jian Wushuang had killed Zhuge Yun and numerous experts from the Zhuge Family. This had made their efforts over the years to go down the drain. They naturally wanted revenge and to have Jian Wushuang killed.

“You are right, Jian Wushuang should die. However, that’s only if there’s an opportunity. It isn’t just you guys that want him killed. However, we aren’t capable of killing Jian Wushuang now. At the very least, with our strength and even if we can count on the Xiang Family, it won’t be enough. As for requesting our sect to send more experts, that’s not possible. Our Dongzuo Sect has a pact with other sects and can’t send that many experts in a conflict between families.”

“In other words, we can’t do anything to Jian Wushuang now. However, Jian Wushuang has the ability to annihilate the Zhuge Family or even all of us!” Elder Chen said solemnly.
