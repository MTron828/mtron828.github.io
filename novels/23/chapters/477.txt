Chapter 478: Three Sword Souls

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang planned to use his full strength against the puppet.

Buzz...

An enormous Sword Essence surged out as two giant Sword Soul Phantoms appeared behind Jian Wushuang.

The Phantoms were almost 30 meters tall and contained a mighty Sword Essence.

With the power of the Sword Souls, Jian Wushuang quickly defeated the puppet.

The experts in the line were amazed when they saw Jian Wushuang’s Sword Soul Phantoms and how he defeated the puppet.

“Double Sword Souls, each 30 meters tall!”

“Those are Double First-grade Sword Souls!”

“He has Double First-grade Sword Souls? He is so talented!”

The experts discussed in amazement.

Seeing Jian Wushuang’s Sword Souls, the purple-clothed woman could not help but nod to herself. “The representatives sent by Marquis Piaoxue are indeed powerful. You three, please go this way.”

Jian Wushuang, Hunjian Lord, and Tianming Lord immediately followed the path and entered Sword-suppression Valley.

As soon as they entered the valley, someone came to guide them.

“Look, that is where the Heart-killing Sword is suppressed.” Hunjian Lord pointed at a huge mountain in the distance.

The mountain was shaped like a volcano, with a huge hole at the center and the Heart-killing Sword was placed at the bottom.

At his first glance of the mountain, Jian Wushuang felt an obscure Sword Essence coming from the bottom.

The Sword Essence was like a sleeping dragon. Once it woke up, the world would be shaken.

With that, Jian Wushuang also sensed the Triple-kill Sword on his back start to quiver.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang looked confused and tried his best to calm the sword down by holding the hilt tightly. In the end, he had to put the sword in his Interspatial Ring.

“Why is the Triple-kill Sword so excited?”?Jian Wushuang pondered.

The sword had been with him since long ago when he left Sword Marquis Mansion and ventured to the outside world. It was like his dearest comrade, but he had never seen the sword become so excited before.

Yes, so excited that it was as if it was meeting family.

“The Triple-kill Sword is a token to enter the Ancestor’s Land. It may be related to the Heart-killing Sword somehow,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

“Sir, those are your residences. Three days from now, the Heart-killing Sword will wake up. Before that time, please concede to stay here.” The attendant led them to a yard with many rooms.

The rooms were made especially for the invited experts.

“Thanks.” Hunjian Lord thanked the attendant.

After the attendant left, Jian Wushuang and the lords gathered by a table in the room.

“Swordsman, Tianming Lord, get yourselves prepared in the next three days. We can’t miss the rare opportunity of the Heart-killing Sword’s awakening,” said Hunjian Lord.

Among the three, Hunjian Lord was the only one that had been here before.

“Hunjian Lord, I’ve heard that at that time there will be a thousand sword salute here. What exactly is that like? What kind of opportunity are we looking at?” asked Tianming Lord.

“Well...” After a moment of pondering, Hunjian Lord continued, “I don’t know how to describe it. It’s a unique experience, so you will have to see it for yourself at that time.”

” After hearing your words, I can’t wait for the Sword Principle Meeting to begin,” Tianming Lord said and smiled.

Jian Wushuang showed a faint smile as well. He shared the lord’s feeling.

Two days passed in the blink of an eye.

During these last few days, experts from every corner kept rushing to the valley.

At this moment, outside the valley, a ragged man with a weather-beaten face walked forward slowly.

He had a long sword on his back and looked like he was middle-aged, but his hair was grey.

The man arrived at the entrance to the valley.

“Sir, please show me your invitation,” said the purple-clothed woman.

“I don’t have such a thing,” the man answered.

The women pulled her face. The surrounding experts’ eyes immediately fell on the man.

The Sword-suppression Valley was not accessible to everyone.

Those who were in the valley were either recommended by their marquis or famous throughout the Divine Land and received an invitation from Su Ming.

Without a recommendation or an invitation, one could not enter.

“So, without an invitation, I can’t get in?” asked the man in a flat tone.

“That’s not completely true.” The woman shook her head and added, “Lord Su Ming has proclaimed that everyone with high achievements in Sword Principle will be allowed into the valley on condition that they can prove themselves.”

The man looked indifferent upon hearing the woman’s words, but behind him, an overwhelming Sword Essence shot up, along with three towering figures.

There were three Sword Soul Phantoms standing side by side, and the center one was a first-grade Sword Soul that was over 30 meters high. On the left and right, the other two Phantoms guarded the center one. They were over 24 meters tall and were second-grade Sword Souls. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The three Phantoms were surging with Sword Essence, enough to shock anyone in the world.

“He... has three Sword Souls!”

“Gosh!”

“Who is he?”

The experts were aghast when they saw this scene.

So was the women.?“How could he have three Sword Souls?”

The awakening of Sword Soul depended on one’s talent in Sword Principle. An ordinary expert might awaken one Sword Soul at best, and in such cases, they would be called a genius.

When the Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline was at its peak, there had been a few people who had awoken their Sword Souls over the decades.

The people with two Sword Souls had been even fewer.

As for those with three Sword Souls, they were monsters.

“Now, can I get in?”

The man’s voiced echoed through the valley.
