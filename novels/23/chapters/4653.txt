4654 The Demoness of Da Qian (1)

Shaking her head slightly, the female disciple from the Taicang Shrine realized that Cosmos God was looking down at them and hurriedly lowered her head.

“Eldest Senior Brother, Second Senior Brother, why don’t we turn back now?” after hesitating for a while, the female disciple gritted her teeth and said.

When the Eldest Senior Brother heard this, he immediately became anxious. “I say, Jiu Ling, what are you doing now? Do you know how hard it is to get an entrance ticket? You’re making a joke out of your Dao Path!”

The female disciple named Jiu Ling gritted her teeth. In the next moment, she suddenly turned around and squeezed through the crowd, leaving the Cangwu Platform.

“Junior Sister, come back!” the Eldest Senior Brother and the others shouted anxiously, but seeing that she had already made up her mind, they could only stop in regret.

In the crowd of cultivators, Jiu Ling turned back to look at them, and then left resolutely.

“I hope that all of this is just my wild guess.”

Close to 3.5 million cultivators all surged into the Cangwu Platform.

Every piece of unknown spiritual Jade beneath their feet exuded a vast amount of divine power. As the cultivators walked into it, they could feel their bodies being nourished by some kind of mysterious energy.

The entire Cangwu Platform’s giant hall was like a boundless Star Field with countless ancient stars above it, looking extremely profound.

In the vast hall of the vast Cangwu Platform, where the clouds were misty, tens of thousands of Lotus platforms were shining on each other. In the center of the largest lotus platform sat Lu Ding, dressed in a flowing cloud scholar’s robe.

The Great Dao of heaven and earth appeared behind him like a rainbow, with auspicious sounds and precious light flowing. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

All the cultivators felt a suppression from the Great Dao of heaven and earth in their hearts. Then, a total of 3.5 million cultivators knelt down at the same time and called out devoutly.

With a smile on his face, Lu Ding waved his sleeve, and the supreme divine power turned into thousands of rainbow shadows, sweeping into the bodies of every cultivator.

At this moment, all the cultivators felt that the elusive shackles were opened, as if the floodgates had opened and they were rising.

Rays of Supreme realm cultivation light shot up into the sky, illuminating the inside of the Cangwu Platform as if it were daytime.

While these cultivators were breaking through their cultivation realms, a shadow flashed across Lu Ding’s eyes. The next moment, a palm-sized flesh-colored cauldron was taken out of his sleeve.

The flesh-colored furnace expanded in the wind and grew to a size of tens of millions of miles in the blink of an eye.

All the cultivators subconsciously looked over.

At this moment, regardless of whether it was near or far, more than half of the stars began to rush towards the Cangwu Platform and fall into the flesh-colored cauldron.

A bright and strange light began to rise from the furnace, turning into a cloud of smoke that rose to the ground.

All the cultivators felt as if they were in a Fairyland, and they had unknowingly lost their way.

Just like that, nearly 3.5 million cultivators floated into the air and then fell into the abyss-like flesh-colored cauldron.

In an instant, the world changed dramatically. With the entire Cangwu Platform as the center, the wind and clouds suddenly changed.

Almost 50,000 Star Fields around the Rodu Star Field were destroyed by this strange change, and the heavens and earth were crying.

Lu Ding sat on the Lotus Throne, still looking at the scene with a kind face. A wisp of power that was not divine power but far stronger than divine power rose around him.

The flesh-colored cauldron, which contained millions of cultivators and countless stars, kept shaking. At the same time, wisps of blood-red patterns began filling up the grooves of the cauldron.

There were no screams, no wails. Everything seemed to be immersed in a Fairyland, until the last moment of death.

When the flesh-colored cauldron stopped shaking, all the phenomena in the world quieted down.

Then, the flesh-colored cauldron slowly changed and finally transformed into a body without any facial features.

Lu Ding waved his hand, and the strange body shrank and fell into his hand.

“Next time, your facial features will grow out.” Lu Ding grinned. “And it’s time for me to break this invisible restraint.”

Heaven and earth trembled. Jiu Ling, who was already far away from the Cangwu Platform, sensed this strange change and hurriedly fled. However, the invisible suction force was simply too terrifying. With her realm as an Ultimate Ruler, she could not even move an inch.

At this critical moment, a Qilin’s roar rang out. At the same time, a force of extreme yang pulled her body and saved her from the suction.

In the vast Cosmic boat, Lu Ting looked at Jiu Ling. “Miss, the Dao Field is already closed. You haven’t entered yet, have you?”

Jiu Ling did not to speak anymore. She looked at the thousands of Qilin clan people in the Cosmic Boat in fear.

“You’re not thinking of us as bad people, are you? We’re all the relatives of the Cosmos God. We’re not bad people,” Lu Gong laughed and said. For some reason, he had a good impression of this woman whose eyes were filled with fear.

However, Jiu Ling only thanked him in a hurry and left the Comisc Boat as if she was escaping.

“Second Brother, you guys can go back first. I’ll be back soon.” After leaving these words, Lu Gong hurriedly followed Jiu Ling’s footsteps.

Lu Ting shook his head helplessly and returned to the Cangwu Platform in the Cosmic Boat.

…

“What is this place…”

“Didn’t I fall into the dark abyss? Did I not die…”

A strange whimper and whisper came into his ears. A figure that was almost torn into two by the chaotic astral wind slowly woke up.

The scabs formed by the divine blood all over his body were repeatedly torn by the astral wind in the space-time turbulence and could not heal. He had already become a bloodied man.

Jian Wushuang’s original appearance was almost unrecognizable. He was like a skeleton that had just grown flesh and blood. He looked at the grotesque and variegated space-time turbulence in a daze.

“If I’m not dead, how am I supposed to go back?”

He lifted his feet and walked through this unknown time and space like a walking corpse. He had lost count of how many years he had been walking.

The most terrifying thing about the space-time turbulence was the unknown. There were no space-time coordinates here. There were only grotesque and variegated realms and astral winds that could easily tear one’s body apart.

However, Jian Wushuang had never given up. He was determined to move forward in the turbulence.

He did not know how much time had passed. Just as he was completely numb, a faint light spot hidden in the turbulence appeared in his eyes.

Jian Wushuang touched it without thinking.

In an instant, tens of thousands of streams of light appeared, stirring up layers of ripples as if they were stirring the water.

Then, the flowing light that burst out was like a dense net that directly absorbed Jian Wushuang’s entire body.

His mind and divine sense were spinning, and he didn’t know how big the world was.

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

A beam of light, like a shooting star in broad daylight, streaked across the sky in a white line and then fell heavily to the ground.
