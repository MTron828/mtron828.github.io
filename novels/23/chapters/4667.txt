4668 The Appearance of the Clay Idol

After hearing the young cultivator’s words, Jian Wushuang nodded to himself. Judging from the general timing, it was indeed in line with the behavior of Lu Ding’s clay idol who had disappeared, as it could mobilize such terrifying energy to devour the souls of the cultivators in the entire Star Field.

After roughly confirming that this was where Lu Ding’s clay idol was located, Jian Wushuang asked again, “Over the years, have you noticed the place with the most death Qi or other energy in this world?”

The young cultivator pondered for a moment and then nodded. “Of course I’ve seen it before. In the Pishui Frontier in the far north, a dense turbid gas would rise every 100,000 years. The turbid gas would cover the sky and the sun, and I would have to lie in a coffin to take refuge.”

“I think the Pishui Frontier is about to be filled with dense and turbid Qi.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and exchanged glances with Old Master. He cupped his hands and said, “Thank you for the information, young friend. We’ll part ways here. See you again.”

“Wait, we’re going to say goodbye? Where are you guys going?”

“The Pishui Frontier you speak of, my Young Friend.” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“What are you guys doing there? Could it be that you’re tired of living?” the young cultivator said in shock.

Jian Wushuang smiled and cupped his hands again. He was about to stand up.

“Forget it, I’ll go with you!” The young cultivator stood up and said, “I’m tired of living like a coward. Why don’t I go with you to find out what’s going on? I’ll die knowing why.”

Jian Wushuang was speechless, but he did not refuse. The four of them flew toward Pishui Frontier.

This was the Genyang Continent, a Star Field, and a Divine Kingdom. Its territory was considered one of the more advanced regions in the Divine Power Universe.

A huge river that seemed to run through the entire Genyang Continent was extremely vast.

But now, the completely dried-up river bed was like a giant skeletal dragon that wriggled menacingly on the continent.

At the same time, a yellow fog that covered the sky suddenly appeared in the distance.

“Not good, the foul air is rising. It’s almost back to the ground.” The young cultivator who was flying on the coffin was shocked when he saw this.

However, when he saw that Jian Wushuang and the others were unmoved, he immediately said nervously, “This foul gas is no joke. Even a Supreme realm expert would have to die on the spot!”

“Little Friend, don’t worry. I’m here.” Jian Wushuang turned around and smiled. Then, he continued to move forward firmly.

For some reason, the young cultivator’s heart calmed down after hearing this.

“F*ck, if we die, so be it!” he shouted in a low voice and leaned on the coffin, looking ahead nervously.

The turbid air that blotted out the sky and covered the earth was like a bloody mouth that kept pushing forward, devouring everything.

The next moment, an extremely clear and pure sword light shot up into the sky like a dragon rising to the sky or a heavenly River flowing backward.

The cultivator on top of the coffin looked at the battle before him in shock. From what he could remember, even the strongest Patriarch of the Genyang Continent would noto be able to survive for even an instant here.

The surging Sword Intent easily destroyed the turbid gas.

The world was clear again.

However, what happened next made the young cultivator suck in a cold breath.

In the dried-up river bed, countless cultivators ‘corpses were piled up like a flowing river of corpses.

Perhaps sensing the arrival of an external force, the countless corpses of cultivators piled up on the entire riverbed began to tremble.

The next moment, a terrifying arm made up of corpses rose from the riverbed and grabbed at Jian Wushuang.

A terrifying sonic boom tore through the sky.

Jian Wushuang looked calm. He looked at the huge palm that was about to grab him and pointed with his finger.

The profound Law instantly condensed into a line and ground the entire palm into powder.

After crushing the earth-shaking palm, nearly a hundred more similar arms rose from the riverbed and attacked from all directions like tentacles.

The young cultivator was completely numb. The war that did not belong to this plane at all appeared in front of him at such a close distance, making him feel like a firefly competing with the bright moon.

Han Ya was also in disbelief. Everything was beyond her knowledge.

The Lord that she had followed for over 100,000 years was an existence that she could not touch at all.

Jian Wushuang sneered as he looked at the terrifying energy that was crashing toward him.

He did not even want to use his Wushuang Sword Dao. He reached out and waved his hand in the air.

Instantly, the power of the entire Heaven-Earth Law pressed down.

The hundreds of terrifying arms made up of countless corpses could not withstand the Laws of heaven and earth at all. They immediately crumbled and turned into a huge amount of sand.

“Lu Ding, if this is all you’ve gained over the years, you’re going to die an ugly death,” Jian Wushuang shouted coldly, and his majestic aura spread.

Rumble…

The ground began to crack, and ravines appeared. Countless dark and strange energy surged up from the earth’s core.

The strange energy gradually gathered in the air and transformed into a giant statue.

“Jian Wushuang, it’s been a million years! Why are you still not willing to let me go?” A bitter and shrill voice resounded from the mouth of the giant statue.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were calm. “Because your appearance was a mistake. In order to prevent this mistake from getting worse, I can only erase it.”

“Crown Prince, do you think you can defeat me now?” the giant statue roared in a deep voice.

“Don’t fight like a trapped beast anymore. Remove your natural life source. Since you didn’t want to do it, I promise you that you can enter reincarnation,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

The giant laughed sinisterly, and in the blink of an eye, it shrunk, revealing the origin of the clay idol.

“I should be the one saying that to you. Do you really think that I’m someone Lu Ding can compare to?”

The terrifying aura of an Ancestor realm being surged out of the clay idol’s body, instantly causing the color of heaven and earth to change, and all living things began to be destroyed into dust.

“I was supposed to be Lu Ding’s scapegoat. However, the Heavenly Dao changed, and I escaped. He died, but I’m still alive. In the end, I should thank you, Jian Wushuang, the most.”

“In order to thank you, I’ve decided to devour you and torture you to death bit by bit!”

Ancestor realm energy burst forth from the clay idol’s body, transforming into countless terrifying bolts of light that swirled over. The heavens crumbled, and the entire Genyang Star Field was annihilated into nothingness.

At the same time, the resentment formed an evil Dao Field and wrapped everyone in it.
