Chapter 3816: Life Core Fragment

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I can’t make any noise in the Dark Magic Region. If I make any noise, a large number of monsters will surround me. I’m afraid that ordinary Superior Rulers won’t be able to escape,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile, “As for me...fortunately, I have the secret skill that you told me about.”

After fighting with the eight-headed monster, Jian Wushuang understood that in order to enter the Dark Magic Region, hiding skills were especially important, in addition to strong strength and life-saving skills.

After all, if you hid well enough so that the monsters could not find you, you would naturally be safe.

Therefore, during the time he entered the Dark Magic Region, he had been looking for secret skills to cultivate.

He had been wandering in this Star Field for a long time and had even killed a Ruler. He had obtained a lot of resources, including some unique secret skills.

He also had secret skills to conceal his aura, but they were not of a high level. In this Star Field, they could only be considered at an ordinary level.

It would be difficult for such an ordinary secret skill to hide from monsters at the ‘elite’ level.

Fortunately, Jian Wushuang still had the Devil Flame in his hand.

Devil Flame was a Ruler at the ultimate level when he was alive. Not only was he powerful, but he had also experienced the drill ground in the vast universe. His knowledge and skills were extraordinary.

Devil Flame naturally knew some secret skills to conceal his aura. At Jian Wushuang’s request, Devil Flame taught him a secret skill to conceal himself.

The level of this secret skill was not very high in the vast universe, but it was much more powerful than the secret skills of concealment in this Star Field.

Moreover, it was relatively easy to cultivate this secret skill. In just a few days, Jian Wushuang had already mastered it.

After mastering this secret skill of concealment, Jian Wushuang immediately went to try it. He found that with this secret skill, even the monsters at the ‘elite’ level could not sense his arrival in advance, only then did he enter the depths of the Dark Magic Region smoothly and did not make much noise.

“I can sense the existence of the monsters around me, but those monsters can’t find me. Even though there are many monsters around, I can still deal with them calmly.” Jian Wushuang chuckled.

He was wandering alone in the depths of the Dark Magic Region.

Half a day later...

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly changed, and a trace of shock appeared on his face.

“Monsters, so many monsters.”

Jian Wushuang could sense that thousands of miles ahead of him, there were a large number of dark red monsters gathered.

A fierce and tyrannical aura soared into the sky.

Jian Wushuang simply swept his consciousness over and saw hundreds of such monsters. This was because the range of his soul power was close to that area. As he slowly approached that area...the number of monsters he sensed increased.

“Too many, too many.”

“There must be more than a thousand monsters.”

Jian Wushuang was amazed.

Along the way, he encountered many monsters, but at most, there were only dozens of monsters gathered together. But now, there were more than a thousand monsters gathered in front of him, most of the monsters were ordinary level monsters, but there were still dozens of elite level monsters.

“So many monsters gathered together. Is there something special about that area?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and immediately used his concealment secret skill to carefully approach the area.

Soon, he appeared in the void around the thousands of monsters.

Even without using his soul power, Jian Wushuang could see a large number of dark red monsters gathered on the ground in front of him. In the center of the land...there was a blood-colored stone with an extremely strange shape. On the blood-colored stone, there were a few white light spots floating quietly.

The white light spots were extremely dazzling and emitted a unique aura.

“That’s...” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were completely fixed on the white light spots.

“A life core fragment. Yes, that’s a life core fragment.” The Devil Flame in the Blood-Red Gourd also became excited. “Master, you’re really lucky. There are indeed pieces of the Immortal Ghost’s life core fragment left behind in the Dark Magic Region. Moreover, there are not only one, but several pieces, or even more.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were also shining with surprise and joy.

The dazzling white light spots floating on the blood stone seemed to contain a special magic power, which made his mind go silent.

The numerous monsters around the blood stone looked at the white light spots with fanaticism. Obviously, the white light spots meant a lot to them.

“There’s more than one life core fragment.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands. “There are four pieces of life core fragments floating on the blood stone. I’m afraid there are other life core fragments in this area and other places in the Dark Magic Region!

“However, although the life core fragment is right in front of me, it’s not easy for me to get it.”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly.

The Blood Stone was in the center of the monsters. If he wanted to step on the blood stone and collect all the life core fragments, he would have to pass through the monsters. Even if he got the life core fragments, he would still have to escape from these crazy monsters, it was not easy for him to escape from these crazy monsters.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang also found that the life core fragments on the blood stone were not floating together, but scattered in different places. Even if he rushed to the blood stone at the first moment, if he wanted to collect the life core fragments...he could only collect them one by one. He could not put all four life core fragments into his interspatial ring at once.

“It’s a bit troublesome.” Jian Wushuang frowned. He did not choose to attack at once, but began to think.

He was thinking about how to get the life core fragments from the group of monsters, and it was best to get all four life core fragments at once.

“Master, these blood-colored specters are formed from the blood of the immortal specters. They have very low intelligence. The life core fragments left by the immortal specters should be something like holy objects for them. That’s why they pay so much attention to them. If you try to snatch them, they will definitely go crazy,” Devil Flame said.

“I know. I’m thinking about how to get the life core fragment easily or how to reduce the risk,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Reduce the risk? Almost impossible.” Devil Flame shook his head.
