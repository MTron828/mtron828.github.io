Chapter 2541: Won!

The Spear World displayed had an oppressive effect on Jian Wushuang.

Under the effects of her Spear World, the Ancient Witch had an advantage in terms of a great improvement in her spear skills.

“Jian Yi, let’s fight now,” said the Ancient Witch as she struck with her spear.

Her speed and power had skyrocketed, making her attacks more versatile and efficient.

Jian Wushuang felt pressured.

He went all out with his sword skills but was still suppressed by the Ancient Witch.

“She’s damn good with the spear!” Jian Wushuang admiringly exclaimed.

She was good with the spear and had her own Spear World on top of an in-depth law understanding and techniques. In Jian Wushuang’s opinion, her overall strength was much stronger than many High-Level Ultimate Gods.

She was an exceptional genius and there were probably only one or two who could be similar to her level in the entire Northern Darkstar Territory. There might perhaps even be none at all.

Jian Wushuang was curious how the Shi clan found such a strong opponent to fight against him.

“Haha. Jian Yi, you’ll lose if this is all you’re capable of.” The Ancient Witch let out a peal of haughty laughter and hurled the spear in her hand.

A cloud of darkness instantly filled the space as a majestic black dragon appeared out of thin air and aimed ferociously at Jian Wushuang.

The terrifying power had completely restricted Jian Wushuang’s body.

“Oh well, enough of playing around.” Jian Wushuang’s gaze became stern as the divine powers within his body were completely released.

Jian Wushuang drew out his sword. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

An overwhelming feeling of hatred spontaneously aroused!

Hate! Hate! Hate!

He was determined and unfaltering.

His sword shadow accompanied with an intense feeling of hatred swept across the void and left behind a trace of Hateful Path Toward Heaven!

Boom!

Sword-lights flashed past.

The black dragon was instantly split into half as a large amount of divine power madly stretched out and around.

The Ancient Witch was horrified as her body was flung out into the distance.

She had only managed to stabilize herself when she was almost at the arena’s edge. At the same time, she felt nauseous and spat out blood.

The ancient witch stared at Jian Wushuang in disbelief. “Your divine powers! You’re obviously only a Primary-Level Ultimate God. Why is your divine power so strong?”

Yes, it was not the sword technique that had defeated her but his overwhelming divine powers contained within the sword move.

Jian Wushuang’s divine power was definitely not common among the Primary-Level Ultimate Gods.

‘Is it some sort of a secret technique?’ The Ancient Witch made a wild guess.

However, Jian Wushuang’s powerful divine power did not come from the secret technique, but himself.

As a Perfect Chaotic Creature, his divine powers were unmatched by ordinary cultivators. His true realm was actually the pinnacle of First-Class Divine Demons, but his divine powers were much stronger than many Primary-Level Ultimate Gods. Along with the divine powers bestowed by the Primordial Void Celestial Body and Seven Stars Secret Technique which he just performed, the fusion of his divine powers was not inferior to those elite High-Level Ultimate Gods.

His divine powers would be even stronger had he performed Divine God of Punishment.

It was no surprise the Ancient Witch was injured from just a single blow with such powerful divine powers combined with his splendid sword technique.

“You’re flattering me.” Jian Wushuang glanced at the Ancient Witch with his monotonous voice.

“You won this time, but don’t ever let me see you again. I’ll definitely get you back next time,” snorted the Ancient Witch coldly before she turned and left.

She felt heavy-hearted and troubled as she walked away.

“There’s unexpectedly a Primary-Level Ultimate God who’s stronger than me in Northern Darkstar Territory! He’s not slightly but a lot stronger than me. His divine powers are extremely strong in addition to his high understanding of the laws and great sword skills. Even among Dragon Phoenix Pavilion’s Ultimate Gods disciples, I’m afraid no one is his match apart from Senior Sister Leng.

“Senior Sister Leng...”

The Ancient Witch thought of the beautiful woman but immediately abandoned her idea. “Senior Sister Leng is too cold and aloof. It’s impossible for her to agree with a fight against Jian Yi.”

She shook her head before walking away without any further thoughts.

There was a huge uproar after she left the arena.

“He won, he did it!”

“A new Ultimate God Blood Gladiator is born!”

“Amazing. Jian Yi is really amazing!”

“Jian Yi! Jian Yi!

The entire arena was chanting Jian Wushuang’s name.

Experts were highly respected in every part of the world and Jian Wushuang was definitely one worthy of such.

The spectators’ frenzy cheered.

Contrary to those spectators’ enthusiasm, the graceful woman’s and black-robed old man’s face were gloomy and grim.

“She lost even after displaying her Spear World! Jian Yi...” The graceful woman’s eyes were cold with murderous intent.

The room door was suddenly flung open as a white-haired silver-robed man surrounded by a few people slowly walked in.

“Clan head?” The graceful woman was startled.

The white-haired silver-robed man was Shi Qianhan, head of the Shi clan.

“The Ancient Witch lost,” reported the graceful woman in a low voice.

“I know. I’ve seen it from the spectators’ seat.” Shi Qianhan nodded with his unreadable facial expression. “I can’t blame the Ancient Witch as she has done her best. Her combat power is extremely strong even among the High-Level Ultimate Gods, but she’s nonetheless defeated by Jian Yi. It only shows that Jian Yi is stronger than her.”

The graceful woman nodded.

The Ancient Witch did indeed give her best, but could not best Jian Wushuang.

“Now that Jian Yi has won five battles, he can take away one hundred and sixty thousand Primordial Stones from us, so...” The graceful woman was put in a difficult situation.

The Gladiatorial Arena had not made such huge profits even in the past ten thousand years.

It was uncommon for someone to bet using Primordial Stones like Jian Wushuang after all as most people usually bet on Ancient God Divine Power.
