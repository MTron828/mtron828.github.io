Chapter 2842: Lord Mo’s Excitement

——

“I wonder which magic weapon Sword One wants to refine again?” Lord Mo asked with a smile.

“This is it.” Jian Wushuang flipped his hand, and the blood mountain sword immediately appeared in his hand.

Lord Mo stared at the blood mountain sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand and carefully browsed it for a moment. Finally, however, he frowned slightly. He was the number one master of blacksmithing in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, but at this moment, he did not see anything special about the blood mountain sword.

It seemed that the blood mountain sword was no different from an ordinary magic weapon.

“Young friend, can you let me have a closer look at this sword?” Lord Mo asked.

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang directly threw the blood mountain sword in front of Lord Mo...

Lord Mo stretched out his hand, and just as his old palm received the blood mountain sword, buzz. Instantly, a terrifying sword essence directly surged toward him.

This sword intent could be said to be world-shocking. Although Lord Mo was an Immortal Saint, the instant he felt this sword intent, his body and mind could not help but tremble.

At the same time, boundless killing intent spread out.

Lord Mo felt a boundless sea of blood from the blood mountain sword.

The sea of blood surged into the sky, and countless corpses were buried there.

It was obvious that this sword had killed countless experts.

It was a real killing sword, an unparalleled sword.

“This sword...”

After carefully examining the blood mountain sword and sensing its structure, Lord Mo’s eyes were filled with more and more shock.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

In the end, the eyes of the number one refiner of the Golden Crow Nine Realms, the Immortal Saint, were wide open!

“Perfect. Too perfect!”

“The body of the sword on the outside and the structure on the inside, from the beginning of the refinement to the formation of the sword, and even the control of the fire, are all absolutely perfect. There is not a single flaw. On the contrary, every flaw has been found!”

“How is it possible?”

“How can someone refine a divine weapon so perfectly in this world?”

“Unbelievable! Unbelievable!”

Even though Lord Mo was well-informed and had seen all kinds of divine weapons, as well as all kinds of refining methods, he was completely shocked when he carefully felt the structure of the blood mountain sword.

He was surprised or even completely shocked.

He had never thought that a divine weapon could achieve such perfection.

In his opinion, regardless of whether it was refining weapons or pills, no matter how high the standard was, there would still be a slight flaw in the refining process.

This slight flaw was not called a flaw in the eyes of many people. Therefore, the divine weapons or elixirs they refined were still perfect.

However, the divine weapon in front of him truly made him unable to find a single flaw.

Perfect, truly perfect!

“Who is it? Which almighty expert refined such an incredible divine weapon?” Lord Mo exclaimed in surprise.

He was a peak seventh-grade blacksmith, but when he refined divine weapons, it was already perfect to achieve 70% perfection.

As for those eighth or ninth-grade blacksmiths who were of a higher level than him, they could at most achieve 80% or 90% perfection.

If one wanted to achieve 100% perfection without any flaws, even the legendary blacksmiths at the peak of the ninth grade could not achieve it.

But now, this magic weapon...

“Although I don’t know who made it, this magic weapon really opened my eyes!” Lord Mo laughed loudly. His entire body was trembling, obviously very excited.

He looked at Jian Wushuang and asked, “Sword One, can you tell me who made your sword?”

Lord Mo looked at Jian Wushuang with anticipation. Obviously, he wanted to know the answer.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and said, “I can only tell you his name. His name is Xuan Yi. As for the rest, I can’t tell you.”

“Xuan Yi, Xuan Yi!”

Lord Mo chanted the name and then bowed respectfully to Jian Wushuang.

“Lord Mo, what are you doing?” Jian Wushuang was caught off guard.

This powerful Lord Mo actually bowed respectfully to him? How could he stand it?

“My friend Sword One, I’m bowing to you to thank you for telling me about this incredible weapon master. Although I can’t see the scene of this Master Xuan Yi refining a magic weapon with my own eyes, I have no regrets just knowing his name. At least I know that in this world, there is an incredible weapon master who can refine the most perfect and flawless magic weapon.”

“From now on, whether I have the chance to meet Master Xuan Yi or not, he will be the person I respect and admire the most.” Lord Mo’s voice was sincere. He truly regarded Xuan Yi as his idol.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang could only smile bitterly.

He did not expect Lord Mo to be so shocked after seeing the blood mountain sword. He did not even care about his status.

After a while, Lord Mo finally calmed down.

“Sword One, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.” Lord Mo smiled awkwardly.

“Never mind.” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

“Now I finally know why you paid such a high price to ask me to refine this magic weapon for you. You’re right. In the entire nine realms of the Golden Crow, no one except me is qualified to refine this magic weapon again. Even for me, this is a great challenge. It can even be said to be the biggest challenge in my life,” Lord Mo said seriously.

“The biggest challenge? Does that mean that even you, Lord Mo, are not sure that you can refine the sword again?” Jian Wushuang asked, puzzled.

“Yes.” Lord Mo nodded, “It’s impossible to refine such a perfect magic weapon. Even a top eighth-grade or legendary ninth-grade weapon refiner can’t do it, let alone me. However, my young friend’s request is to infuse his own blood essence into the magic sword. So for me, I have a chance to do it. As for my confidence, it’s about 60%.”

“Only 60%?” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

“Don’t worry, my friend. Although I’m only 60% sure, it won’t affect or damage the magic weapon even if I fail. Since such a perfect magic weapon has been created, it’s impossible to damage it. Furthermore, I’m just a top seventh-grade weapon refiner, so I can’t affect it at all,” Lord Mo said.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. “In that case, when will you refine it, Lord Mo?”
