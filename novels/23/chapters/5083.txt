Chapter 5085 Black Robe! Black Robe!

As a Divine Craftsman, Xu Tuo died on the spot!

Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang, in the brief moment of their clash, was blasted into the molten lava of the enormous cauldron!

It was too terrifying, too gruesome.

Rumble...

The giant cauldron began to deform, its bottom suddenly shattered. The cataclysmic lava, akin to a rampaging dragon out of control, gushed out from the cauldron!

The heavens and the earth changed color, and even the Heavenly Dao of the Sancun Mountain shattered directly.

Clouds dissipated, and a dark purple haze churned frenziedly.

Everything was filled with an apocalyptic atmosphere.

The black-red doomsday lava instantly devoured nearly half of the Dao Arena and began to burn.

The entire sky turned chaotic and crimson.

Nan Xuan's anxiety reached its peak. If he did not rescue Jian Wushuang from the molten cauldron in time, the outcome would undoubtedly be dire.

This was a situation he absolutely did not want to witness.

Therefore, the moment Jian Wushuang fell into the giant cauldron, Nan Xuan rushed toward him.

But in the next moment, what awaited him was an impenetrable barrier.

The dark purple mist surged wildly and formed a thick barrier, blocking Nan Xuan's path.

"Get out of my way!" he snarled, directly unleashing the supreme Yan Power unique to the Grand Yan Immortals.

However, what happened next was beyond Nan Xuan's expectations.

The unparalleled Yan power, which could override the Heavenly Dao and modify them, rapidly dissipated upon touching the barrier.

At the same time, a massive black robe, like the embodiment of darkness itself, hovered in front of Nan Xuan beyond the barrier.

His eyes narrowed, and almost at an unimaginable speed, he drew the long sword hanging from his waist and thrust it toward the black-robed figure beyond the barrier!

The barrier shattered in response, but the long sword came to a halt in front of the black-robed figure, unable to advance any further.

Tip of the sword against fingertip!

The black-robed figure slowly extended a finger, pressing it against the tip of Nan Xuan's sword.

Nan Xuan was astonished, attempting to retract the sword, but he realized he could no longer control it.

"Clang, clang, clang!"

A crisp sound of metal shattering rang out. His personal long sword, a blade capable of challenging even Jian Wushuang, unexpectedly shattered in this moment!

Shattered inch by inch!

With a single finger, the black-robed figure shattered the long sword. Then, with undiminished force, a dark purple beam shot forth.

Nan Xuan could no longer dodge and could only watch as the dark purple beam of light pierced towards him.

His Immortal body, which was stronger than the Heavenly Dao, was easily shattered at this moment.

His entire right arm was instantly shattered, and even his entire right shoulder was penetrated by that terrifying force.

Divine blood scattered, and South Xuan had no strength left for another battle, plummeting into the molten lava below.

In the span of ten breaths, another Grand Yan Immortal met near-instantaneous obliteration, and the black-robed figure had used only a single finger from start to finish.

The dark purple mist obscured the sky, and the endless molten lava pouring from the giant cauldron had already devoured the entire Dao Arena, burning through the clouds.

Nan Xuan fell into the molten lava like a kite with a broken string.

The black-robed figure, however, seemed unwilling to let him go and began moving closer.

But at that moment, as the rolling molten lava surged, a crack suddenly appeared, and the previously deceased Divine Craftsman, Xu Tuo, miraculously came back to life!

Although he was short and stout, he moved with incredible agility and quickly rescued Nan Xuan.

Then, he swiftly shoved a pill into Nan Xuan's mouth. "Kid, wake up for me!"

Nan Xuan coughed up a mouthful of divine blood, his vitality greatly diminished, clearly heavily wounded.

"I... am not dead yet?"

"Dying is simple, but staying alive is not so easy. Buck up!" Xu Tuo growled in a low voice.

He then supported Nan Xuan and prepared to escape.

However, everything had already undergone a profound change, and even a Grand Yan Immortal had no power to reverse the situation!

The black-robed figure that had appeared from seemingly nowhere effortlessly struck down Xu Tuo with one palm, and with a single finger, defeated Nan Xuan. Its true power was far more terrifying than what had been revealed.

A cold sweat dripped from Xu Tuo's temple. Previously, he had managed to escape disaster by feigning death, but this did not prove that he could resist the black-robed figure. Instead, it made him realize that the black-robed figure was too terrifying and overwhelmingly powerful.

Strength this formidable made no sense; it was the embodiment of endless despair.

Next, as if to confirm Xu Tuo's thoughts, the sky suddenly collapsed and folded, an irresistible force like chains compressing from all directions.

Xu Tuo and Nan Xuan simultaneously groaned and then stiffened in place, unable to make any further moves.

The black-robed figure appeared before them once more, slowly raising its withered and massive hand toward the front.

A pure and dense dark purple aura gathered in its palm, filled with a destructive aura.

Xu Tuo's eyes widened; he could foresee that once this aura struck, even a Grand Yan Immortal would have no chance of survival.

But there was simply no escape.

The dark purple aura, brimming with the essence of destruction, roared forth, directly engulfing Xu Tuo.

In the next moment, an almost earth-shattering explosion resounded.

The giant cauldron shattered with a thunderous crash, and black-red magma scattered in all directions, scorching the heavens.

And amidst it all, a beam of light, like a shooting star, tore through the mist and shot towards the black-robed figure.

And among them, a beam of light that looked like a meteor suddenly tore through the mist and shot toward the black-robed figure.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Xu Tuo felt his eyes obscured by a crimson hue, and he and Nan Xuan were both forcefully pushed back by the tremendous force.

The collision of the dark purple aura and the crimson beam resulted in the most intense detonation.

Just this single explosion had brought the entire Dao Arena to the brink of destruction.

Six of the ten giant cauldrons in the Dao Arena shattered in a row.

The black-red molten lava inside the cauldrons was no longer restrained, falling to the earth like colossal dragons.

At that moment, countless divine herbs and Immortal trees, as well as the vitality of countless living beings, were devoured by the molten lava.

The earth turned into a purgatory, becoming a vessel for the accumulating lava, and mountains, rivers, and lakes all turned to ashes.

"A great battle is happening!"

The previously Guardian Immortals, witnessing this unimaginable scene, all rushed toward the direction of the Dao Arena without hesitation.

At the same time, disciples of the Divine Craftsman Xu Tuo also sprang into action.

The destruction of the world continued.

Due to the sudden detonation, both Divine Craftsman Xu Tuo and Nan Xuan were able to catch their breath.

At the same time, Xu Tuo exclaimed in disbelief, "It can't be, how could it be that kid?!"

Nan Xuan, barely recovering his composure, saw the scene in the distance and couldn't help but smile bitterly. Diiscover new ùíîtories at nùíêve/lbin(.)c/oùíé

In the far distance, facing the figure in the black robe was Jian Wushuang, dressed in the Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens.

His Immortal body, previously heavily wounded, had fully recovered. His robe had been torn to shreds by the surging lava, revealing the deep blue Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens underneath.

Radiant divine patterns flowed all over his body, and the boundless power of the Great Dao once again radiated from him.

The Dao of Protection, the Wushuang Sword Dao, the Dao of Slaughter‚Äîthese three Great Dao had merged within him, making Jian Wushuang reach an unprecedented level of terror.

Fierce winds raged, making the figure's black robe rustle.

And once again, he moved!
