1982 The Origins of Star Foggy Sea

Jian Wushuang represented the entire Green Fire World.

Comparing Green Fire World to the entire Eternal Chaotic World, it was at a disadvantage. Green Fire World was too valuable.

After Green Fire World was exposed, Jian Wushuang understood that Green Fire World had to give way. He used up all he could to protect the benefits of the cultivators in Green Fire World.

Although Green Fire World gave out thirty percent territory, Green Fire World was finally under his control. They kept the ancient battlefield where the skull was, where the Green Fire World was located. On top of that, experts from various forces had to pay a certain amount of Doctrine Gems and supplement some resources that Green Fire World needed. That was good enough.

As for Sanctuary Alliance and special tribe…

Because they were worried that Jian Wushuang would fight at the risk of mutual destruction, worried about the formation that blended with the spacetime storm, they had no choice but to compromise.

Dealing with a spacetime storm that could instantly wipe out the entire ancient battlefield and all experts at the scene, they couldn’t be aggressive.

After they reached a mutual agreement, experts from various forces left and made their own preparations. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

One thing for sure was that Sanctuary Alliance, special tribes and various forces in Eternal Chaotic World had to discuss how many cultivators below Real God level could head into Green Fire World. Also, they would have to discuss who would make up the Alliance of Ten. All those would go through some arguments.

Of course, that had nothing to do with Jian Wushuang.

In the lofty palace.

“Jian Wushuang.” Emperor Bai who closed his eyes and never spoke finally opened his eyes.

“Mister Emperor Bai,” Jian Wushuang immediately looked at Emperor Bai.

“I never thought that your hometown would be on this ancient battlefield. If I am not mistaken, Emperor Thirteen should be formed on this ancient battlefield, right?” Emperor Bai asked.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“As expected,” Emperor Bai smiled faintly. He then said, “I heard that your power has improved tremendously over the years. How far away are you from the seventh step?”

“I am very close,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“I see,” Emperor Bai creased his eyebrows and said. “Although I know it is about luck to break through, I hope you could breakthrough sooner. After all, Eternal Chaotic World is becoming more and more unstable. The two hidden dark forces continuously popped out one after another. If I’m not mistaken, in no time, the two hidden dark forces will take major action.”

Jian Wushuang was shocked and he immediately nodded, “I understand.”

Jian Wushuang bid farewell soon after.

After Jian Wushuang left the palace, he plunged in the direction of Green Fire World.

Before he got close to Green Fire World, Jian Nantian, Wang Yuan, Su Rou and the others who had been waiting for very long in Green Fire World greeted him.

“Shuang, how did it go?” Jian Nantian asked closely.

“Third brother.” The others looked at Jian Wushuang.

All their gazes were filled with anticipation.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, “It’s okay.”

A simple reply made all cultivators in Green Fire World be filled with excitement.

One should know that all of them viewed death unflinchingly and wanted to fight at a risk of mutual destruction.

They had already prepared to die in the battle.

But then… they were fine?

Everything had been solved?

“Really?” Wang Yuan found it unbelievable.

“Of course,” Jian Wushuang smiled and looked at Jian Nantian, “Father, please gather all higher-ups in Green Fire World for a discussion.”

“Alright,” Jian Nantian nodded and immediately went to make the arrangement.

Jian Wushuang brought King Luo Yu and Lord Spirit Sound to a remote void.

“King Luo Yu, Lord Spirit Sound, thank you so much, “Jian Wushuang expressed his gratitude.

Lord Spirit Sound shrugged but didn’t say much.

King Luo Yu said solemnly, “Sword Emperor, you are welcome. We of Ancient God tribe value bloodlines the most. You have our royal bloodline and you should be our new Emperor. I wonder when Sword Emperor will follow me back to Ancient God tribe?”

“Ancient God tribe?” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but smile, “You can tell that I am very busy now. Wait for a while. Until Green Fire World and the ancient battlefield stable down,?I will head down to visit Ancient God tribe.

“Alright, this is my communication token. When Sword Emperor reaches Ancient God tribe, send me a message directly,” King Luo Yu passed Jian Wushuang his token and he left.

From the beginning until the end, King Luo Yu had revered Jian Wushuang from the bottom of his heart.

After King Luo Yu left, Jian Wushuang looked at Lord Spirit Sound again, “Lord Spirit Sound, it has been so long. There are many things that I am confused about. I wonder if you could answer them for me.”

“Sure. Go ahead and ask,” Lord Spirit Sound replied with a faint smile. She knew that Jian Wushuang would definitely ask her some questions.

She was well-prepared.

“Lord Spirit Sound, you should know what I want to ask, right?” Jian Wushuang looked at Lord Spirit Sound, “Firstly, it’s about where you are from. If I’m not mistaken, Lord Spirit Sound shouldn’t be related to Lineage of Star at all. Previously, you said that you controlled Star Foggy Sea to select disciple for Lineage of Star. I’m afraid that’s not the truth, right?”

“That’s right. I am not related to Lineage of Star at all. As for controlling Star Foggy Sea, someone wanted me to do that,” Lord Spirit Sound said.

“Who?” Jian Wushuang asked closely.

“Xuan Yi! You should know this,” Lord Spirit Sound smiled.

Jian Wushuang was surprised when he heard the name Xuan Yi.

“As expected,” Jian Wushuang sighed. He had already guessed so in his head.

“As for where I am from, I think you could guess it too. I am from the surrounding battlefield, as are the cultivators from ancient times that you were talking about. However, I was only a small figure in ancient times. I somehow or other got involved in the war back then. Back then, the war darkened the sky and obscured everything. Countless terrifying existences passed away. Although I got involved in the war, I was lucky. At least, I survived,” Lord Spirit Sound said.

“Although I survived, I was in bad shape. I was in a deep sleep in the depths of this ancient battlefield. I had no alternative until I met the mysterious expert named Xuan Yi. He woke me up and helped me to recover my power. As an exchange, I have to control Star Foggy Sea on his behalf until someone can pass the final test in Star Foggy Sea. Then, I will gain my freedom.”

“As for the excuse of manipulating Star Foggy Sea on behalf of the Master of Star Palace, it was instructed by Xuan Yi. I don’t even know what Lineage of Star is, so why would I control Star Foggy Sea on their behalf?”
