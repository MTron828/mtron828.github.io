As Xuan Yi led his four favorite disciples off swaggering under the watch of all the experts, today’s incident was finally settled.

The experts and disciples all gloated at the three magnates.

Today, it could be said that the three magnates went for wool and came home shorn.

They originally wanted to take on Jian Wushuang and force him to tell them the secrets about the Eternal Zone. However, they did not achieve this. What was more, they suffered a great loss—they not only lost many Eternal Realm experts in the fight against Jian Wushuang, but also had to pay a huge price to appease Xuan Yi’s wrath.

They had to pay 100 million Divine Gems, five kilograms of Orichalcum, and loads of precious Secret Skills.

This compensation really cost the three magnates an arm and a leg.

Today’s battle actually turned the three magnates into Jian Wushuang and Xuan Yi’s stepping stones.

After this battle, the entire Firmament Territory would soon know the Ancient Sect had raised a peerless genius, an unprecedented Divine Realm expert who could outshine all the experts of the three magnates, and his name was Jian Wushuang.

? ? Meanwhile, with the reappearance of his three Dao Master disciples, the fame and influence of the most mysterious Xuan Yi in the Firmament Territory would certainly be taken a notch up.

But of course, fame and influence were never the things that Jian Wushuang and Xuan Yi pursued.

They did not care what the experts of various sects in the Firmament Territory were saying.

On the top of the Enlightenment Mountain in the Ancient Sect, Jian Wushuang and his three Senior Brothers were sitting by a table loaded with wine and assorted dishes.

“Senior Brothers, if you hadn’t come in time today, I’m afraid I would not be sitting here alive. Now, I’d like to propose a toast to the three of you,” Jian Wushuang said sincerely, raising his wine cup.

His three Senior Brothers all accepted his gratitude and drained their cups.

Then, Bai Hu, who was evidently the most outspoken one out of the three, gave a hearty smile and said, “Junior Brother, even if we did not get to you in time today, you wouldn’t be in any danger at all.”

“Yeah.” Xue Lingtian and Purple Mountain also nodded in agreement.

“Really?” Jian Wushuang could not help but feel bemused.

If his three Senior Brothers had not arrived in time, could he really have gotten out of trouble unscathed?

“Junior Brother, don’t forget that you still have our Master on your side,” Bai Hu said with a grin.

“Master?” Jian Wushuang looked taken aback.

This was not because he did not have much confidence in his Master. On the contrary, he had great faith in his Master Xuan Yi. If not, he would not have struck out without hesitation because of Xuan Yi’s few words and made such a scene today.

But deep down, Jian Wushuang was still a bit puzzled. After all, his Master Xuan Yi was only an Eternal Realm expert. How could that be?

“Junior Brother, don’t belittle our Master.” Xue Lingtian looked at Jian Wushuang and said solemnly. “It’s true that our Master hasn’t reached the level of Dao Master, but this does not mean he is inferior to those Dao Masters.”

“In fact, it is the opposite. I’ve traveled around for years and met many Dao Masters. I even came into contact with some very powerful and influential figures in the Eternal World. But I can say, among all the experts I met over those years, that in terms of unfathomable strength, our Master definitely ranks first.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang felt surprised.

Xue Lingtian was one of the 18 Masters of the Void Temple. He was widely known in the Eternal World, his power and influence were also exceptional.

? ? A big shot like him certainly had dealings with many extraordinary experts. Among all those experts, how could Palace Master Xuan Yi rank first?

“Junior Brother, you’re one of the members of the Sword Palace in the Ancient Sect, aren’t you?” Xue Lingtian suddenly asked.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“You know, many years ago when I was recruited, the Ancient Sect had no Sword Palace at all. The only palace they had was the Saber Palace, and our Master was the Palace Master there at that time,” Xue Lingtian said.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Before the Sword Palace was established, there was a Saber Palace? And Xuan Yi was the Palace Master of this Saber Palace?

“Not only did the First Senior Brother experience this, so but also the two of us. When I joined in the Ancient Sect, there was no Sword Palace or Saber Palace. All they had was the Spear Palace, and our Master was the Palace Master of the Spear Palace,” Purple Mountain said.

“Haha, I use an axe as my weapon. This is because when I was taken in, our Master was the Palace Master of the Axe Palace in the Ancient Sect,” Bai Hu said candidly.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was completely dumbstruck.

He had noticed long ago that his Senior Brothers all used different weapons. His First Senior Brother Xue Lingtian wielded a saber, his Second Senior Brother Purple Mountain employed a long spear, and his Third Senior Brother Bai Hu relied on a Giant Axe.

But at that time he did not think about it too much. After all, no one said that his Master Xuan Yi would only take in experts who were good at the Sword Principle.

However, at this moment, Jian Wushuang finally realized that his Master was not only an ace at the Sword Principle.

Given that he had taught the three Dao Masters, Xue Lingtian, Purple Mountain, and Bai Hu, he must have had an equally deep understanding of the Saber Principle, the Spear Principle, and the Axe Principle.

Considering as well what Xuan Yi had said himself, he had also had profound study in many fields, such as refining weapons, making puppets, and concocting elixirs, the shock that Jian Wushuang felt became even greater.

Xuan Yi had studied so many subjects and made profound achievements in all of those subjects. Was he even human?

How mysterious!

How unfathomable!

This was what Jian Wushuang thought about Xuan Yi.

Long before, he had already found his Master very mysterious. But now, he realized that he still vastly underestimated him.

Seeing Jian Wushuang’s expression alter, Xue Lingtian and the other two were not surprised at all. Anyway, they had been through the same shock that Jian Wushuang was feeling now.

“So, Junior Brother, even if we hadn’t come today, with our Master’s capability, you would never have fallen into the hands of the three magnates. I don’t know much else, but I’m sure Master could easily rescue you and take you away.” Xue Lingtian beamed.

“Really?” Jian Wushuang nodded. Then, he asked, “Senior Brothers, you’ve followed the leadership of our Master for so many years, but do you have any inside information about him?”

“No, I don’t.” Bai Hu shook his head without hesitation.

“I don’t know much, either.” Purple Mountain gave a wry smile.

“I’m the one who has been around our Master the longest. But I also have no real insight into him at all. Well, judging by his daily behaviors, I can tell that our Master is the kind of man who desires nothing. He doesn’t pursue anything but always follows his heart. Taking us in as his personal disciples is also a decision he made in the course of nature,” Xue Lingtian said subtly.

“And our Master cares a lot about us, but he has never asked us to do anything for him.”

“It’s been at least more than 100,000 years since I joined our Master, and he never once ordered me to do his biddings. Instead, it was me who often sought help from him.”
