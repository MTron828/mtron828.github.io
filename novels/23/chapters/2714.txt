Chapter 2715: Token of the Secret Realm

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“An entry token to the secret realm?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

There were two types of secret realms.

One of them was a naturally formed cosmic secret realm that normally had free spirits living in them and was considered a small world.

These secret realms were mostly extraordinarily valuable because these cosmic secret realms contained different elements compared to the Ancient God Domain. The appearance of a cosmic secret realm as such would draw the attention of many experts.

The other type of secret realm was those created by cultivators.

Just like in his past life, there were many secret realms created by cultivators when Jian Wushuang was in the Eternal Chaotic World.

However, there were no Will of Heavenly Way in the Eternal Chaotic World, allowing the opening up of secret realms there to be extremely easy.

However, it was different in the Ancient God Domain.

The Ancient God Domain was controlled by the Will of Heavenly Way and the space was extremely stable. There was a huge requirement toward a person’s strength to open a secret realm under such circumstances. At the very least, normal cultivators such as Ultimate Gods could not do that.

Even an Undying Saint was not capable of doing so, but there were still some possibilities for those top-notched or strongest Undying Saints.

The secret realm that Devilish Wind King mentioned needed an entry token falls to the second type which was created by cultivators. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

A secret realm created by cultivators was extremely valuable.

The person who created the secret realm might have left many blessings and precious items inside the secret realm.

Such a secret realm was extremely attractive to cultivators.

“Devilish Wind King, you’re saying this broken sword is a token to enter a secret realm?” Jian Wushuang stared at the Devilish Wind King.

“Yes, this secret realm has never been disclosed and almost nobody knew about it. The secret realm contains all sorts of blessings with most of them being well preserved,” said the Devilish Wind King.

“Most of them being well preserved? Does this mean that a part of the blessings has been obtained by others? Somebody had previously entered the secret realm?” Jian Wushuang could not help but frown.

“Somebody had entered the realm. Otherwise, how will I know that this broken sword is the token to the secret realm?” The Devilish Wind King smiled and continued speaking, “In truth, this broken black sword is the token of the secret realm but it’s not the only token as there are six pieces with this being one of the pieces that form a longsword. I also have one of the pieces with me.” The Devilish Wind King also took a similar broken black sword out with a flip of his hand.

Jian Wushuang’s facial expression darkened when he saw the broken black sword in Devilish Wind King’s hand.

“This is nothing as the token to the secret realm was a complete divine sword. I’m the one who initially obtained it,” said the Devilish Wind King with a smile.

“You’re the one who obtained it?” Jian Wushuang’s facial expression changed.

“Although I’ve obtained the complete token and found the secret realm based on the token’s guidance, the secret realm was extremely dangerous while I’m just an ordinary Primary-level Grand Ultimate God so I did not manage to travel far before directly retreated and later on gathered a group of not many helpers. I only gathered five Grand Ultimate Gods and the six of us once again entered the secret realm to explore the place.

“The six of us worked together this time and managed to obtain some rewards from the secret realm,” said the Devilish Wind King with a smile.

“Fo Yi is one of your helpers?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, he’s one of the helpers I’ve employed and who also obtained a precious item from the secret realm. It seemed to be a special scroll but I have no idea what use is that scroll. As for the others, they’ve gotten something for themselves too,” said the Devilish Wind King.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

He finally knew the reason Fo Yi owned a Fengtian Scroll.

It turns out he gained them from a special secret realm.

That secret realm was created by a super expert and seemed to contain all sorts of precious items that one had the opportunity to obtain inside the realm to the extent it seemed normal for Fo Yi to get his hands on one or two Fengtian Scrolls.

“What happened then?” Jian Wushuang looked at the Devilish Wind King.

“The six of us originally went on an adventure together. However, we met with an extremely dangerous situation before we reached the secret realm’s internal area and the six of us could only escape. In the end, all six of us had a difficult time leaving the place and were badly wounded.

“We were in bad shape after leaving the secret realm hence we did not enter the place again. Instead, we made a promise to reenter this realm again after fifty years when our strength has almost recovered. Apart from that, the token that was originally mine was also broken into six pieces under the request... No, under those five people’s coerce with everyone holding on to one of the pieces.

“None of us six can enter this secret realm on our own under such circumstances. We can only go together if we want to enter the realm. In addition, we made a pact not to tell anybody about the secret realm” said the Devilish Wind King.

Jian Wushuang finally understood what was going on when he heard that.

He also knew the Devilish Wind King’s purpose of coming to see him.

“Alliance Master Su Han, the secret realm can only be opened after we’ve collected all six pieces of the token. The broken sword piece that once belonged to Fo Yi is now in your possession as you’ve killed him, hence the others contacted me after they learned of this news and asked me to personally contact you about this matter. You can sell this broken black sword token to us if you’re willing. We’ll be able to give you a satisfactory price with the five of us working together.

“Besides that, Alliance Master Su Han can also replace Fo Yi and choose to wander the secret realm with us. However, the prerequisite condition is that you cannot tell anyone about this, or...all five of us will do our best to kill you. Although I’m not extremely strong and I can’t do anything to you, the other four aren’t easy to deal with and are capable of killing you,” said the Devilish Wind King seriously.

Jian Wushuang smiled quietly and said, “I understand, I’m very interested in the secret realm since it’s so wonderful and won’t miss this opportunity since it has been offered to me.”

“What you meant to say is that you’re joining us on an adventure in the secret realm the next time we enter the realm?”

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile on his face.

“If that’s the case, I hope Alliance Master Su Han will keep your promise and not tell others about this. Here’s my token. The last time we entered the secret realm was twenty years ago and there are another thirty years before we enter the secret realm again. You can prepare yourself well within these thirty years. I’ll notify you with this token when the time comes,” said the Devilish Wind King.

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang smiled and took the token.

The Devilish Wind King did not continue to linger and soon left.

Jian Wushuang slightly squinted as he saw the Devilish Wind King leaving.

Jian Wushuang mumbled, “This Devilish Wind King is extremely cunning. I wonder if the secret realm he mentioned is real or not? No matter which it is, there are still thirty years left. We’ll see it after thirty years.”
