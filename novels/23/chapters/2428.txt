Chapter 2429: Joining Hands

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Even Crimson Stone Saint exclaimed after knowing about Jian Wushuang’s story.

He was a well-respected Undying Saint and had witnessed various genius experts amidst traveling throughout the Ancient God Domain when he was still a mortal.

Among them, there were some truly mesmerizing demons and monsters!

Even so, he had never heard of a 16-year-old demon achieving Profound Achievement regardless of how impressive that 16-year-old was.

As for an Early Stage Chaotic Realm that could go head-on and overpower a Second-Class Divine Demon, that was even more unbelievable. If not hearing it directly from Gold Cauldron Sect’s Na Qianyuan, even Crimson Stone Saint himself would have trouble believing it, not to mention genius disciples from various sects.

Even Crimson Stone Saint himself had never seen or even heard of such a monster.

Crimson Stone Saint became even more curious about Jian Wushuang after discovering it.

“If he could overpower Second-Class Divine Demon while still being an Early Stage Chaotic Realm, his ability must have gone up a whole lot, now that he’s at the Peak Stage Chaotic Realm and also had achieved a breakthrough in his sword principle cultivation level. I suppose his battle strength is perhaps comparable to a Peak Divine Demon? I wonder where he is positioned in comparison to those few geniuses in the tomb. In a few more days, I want to observe in detail when the competition for those six positions begins.”

...

After that, It was extremely peaceful in the Saint’s Tomb.

Genius disciples from all sects tried breaking through those challenges on the Bridge of Trials with nobody else creating any more troubles.

As for Jian Wushuang, although everyone knew that he possessed Purple Blood Saint’s relics and some felt slight greed to possess them, all of them held back with nobody daring to take any actions.

Almost in the blink of an eye, Saint’s Tomb had been opened for almost a month.

In the fields where Narcissus Island disciples gathered, the disciples from Ancient Star Temple had chosen to station there as well.

Zhuo Bing, Ling Dan, Zhong Yi, and Su Tong gathered together.

“It’s almost time. If nothing’s out of expectations, the competition for those six positions will begin these few days,” said Ling Dan.

“Fengtian Scroll... For all of us, it’s such a precious opportunity to be able to study Fengtian Scroll. Hence, when those six positions appear, there’s bound to be a bloodied fight over it,” mumbled Zhuo Bing.

“Zhong Yi and Su Tong, I gather you’re both interested in those positions as well?” Ling Dan looked at them.

“That’s for sure,” Zhong Yi and Su Tong simultaneously nodded. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Why don’t we join hands since that’s the case?” Ling Dan suggested.

“Joining hands?” Zhong Yi and Su Tong both felt surprised.

“It’s such that if there is a position token that appears near our area when the competition begins, all four of us could use our full might to fight for it. However, if any among us successfully obtains a position token, the other three should not fight for it, and have to do their best to help him fend off genius disciples from other sects instead,” said Ling Dan.

Hearing that, Zhong Yi and Su Tong looked at each other and nodded without much hesitation.

“Sure. It would be exceptionally difficult to get one position token relying only on Junior Sister Su Tong and myself. However, if we join forces with Brother Ling Dan and Miss Zhuo Bing, we might be able to get one if luck permits,” said Zhong Yi.

“Well then, it’s decided. From my investigation today, even though there are many sects surrounding us in this area, there aren’t many who are very skilled. Furthermore, I’m the only Twelve Minor King. If we four join hands and a position token really appears around here, there shouldn’t be anyone qualified to fight against us over it.” Ling Dan smiled.

However, as soon as he spoke...

There were a few black dots dashing towards them from the void not far away. They soon had appeared within their sight.

“These are...people from the Great Compassion Sect?”

“With Pang Tao leading?”

“What is he doing here?”

Zhuo Bing, Ling Dan, and the other Narcissus Island disciples were stunned.

However, Pang Tao did not come up to provoke them this time. They instead stopped somewhere rather close to them. Afterward, the ten Great Compassion Sect disciples led by Pang Tao found a place and settled down.

“Damn it, this Pang Tao also plans to wait in this area?” Ling Dan said quietly.

Saint’s Tomb was very large, and even though the inner area was not as big as the outer area, it was still not a small place per se.

Those six position tokens that symbolized the right to study Fengtian Scroll could appear at any time on any corner of the inner area.

They could appear anywhere, so it was largely luck dependent on whether one could find them.

All the various sects’ genius disciples were scattered in different places within the inner area, waiting patiently for their opportunities.

However, no sects wished for any opponents who could form a threat to lurk around the area they were in.

It would only mean that a strenuous fight would occur with such an opponent around, should a position token appear in that area.

Pang Tao from the Great Compassion Sect was undoubtedly a strong opponent in the eyes of disciples from Narcissus Island and Ancient Star Temple.

Previously, Ling Dan thought that if Ancient Star Temple and Narcissus Island joined hands, they could dominate that area, and no other sects could withstand them.

However, now that Pang Tao had appeared, the situation was completely different.

“This Pang Tao, he’s most probably here for us,” said Zhong Yi coldly.

“Correct. When he was taken away by Long Zishan, I could see how dissatisfied he was and would look for a chance to make a move on Junior Brother Wushuang, and now he simply settles close to us. As soon as the competition begins, he would have the chance to do something to Junior Brother Wushuang.” Su Tong agreed.

“Little Brother.” Zhuo Bing’s expression turned cold and called out.

Jian Wushuang, who was sitting on a broken rock studying Purple Blood Sword Principle, gradually opened his eyes and walked over.

“Big Sister, what is the matter?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Look over there.” Zhuo Bing signaled Jian Wushuang with her eyes.

Jian Wushuang immediately looked at the direction she was gazing at, noticing Pang Tao and the others from the Great Compassion Sect.

“Oh, they’re camping closeby. Looks like he’s looking for a chance to get me.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“It’s good that you know. He wouldn’t make a move since the competition for those token positions hasn’t begun. However, the inner area will be incredibly chaotic once it starts. If such a token appears in our area, all of us including Pang Tao will fight for it. You need to retreat to the battlefield’s edge and not join in or stay too close to avoid getting dragged into it so that Pang Tao couldn’t find a chance. Understand?” Zhuo Bing advised.

“Gotcha, I’ll be careful. My life is extremely precious after all.” Jian Wushuang smiled mildly, with not the least bit of worry in his mind.
