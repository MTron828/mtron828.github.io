Chapter 3144: Kill!

——

“Voodoo poison…”

Jian Wushuang sneered in his heart. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Previously, the god-killing nail contained extremely strong voodoo poison, so it could not affect Jian Wushuang at all.

But now, although the voodoo world was much stronger than the god-killing nail, Jian Wushuang was still immune to it.

Even if he stayed in the voodoo world for 10 days and 10 nights, he would not be affected, let alone 10 breaths.

“You’ve used your most powerful skill, but you still can’t do anything to me. Then you’re dead.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold.

“Oh no!” The heart witch’s face changed.

As Jian Wushuang had said, as long as Jian Wushuang was not dead, he would be in big trouble.

“Kill!”

Dao Dragon and the Samsara Sword Formation controlled by Jian Wushuang appeared in front of the heart witch again and rushed toward her.

The heart witch, who had lost more than half of her divine power, was in a worse and worse situation. In the end, she could only struggle.

However, the struggle only lasted for a moment, and she still died.

“She’s dead! The heart witch is dead!”

“The heart witch is a very famous rank seven True Saint. It’s said that he’s more difficult to deal with than many rank seven Peak True Saints.”

“Lord Dao Dragon and Heavenly Sword Marquis really killed the heart witch here?”

Most of the experts of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance were in disbelief.

When Jian Wushuang said that he would leave the heart witch behind, many people did not believe him.

But it happened.

Of course, it was not because the heart witch’s methods did not match the rumors. It was because the heart witch had met Jian Wushuang, who had even better methods.

The heart witch’s best method was to control the voodoo poison, but his voodoo poison had no effect on Jian Wushuang!

Secondly, his life-saving methods were also very good. That was why he dared to fight Dao Dragon head-on.

However, Jian Wushuang’s ruler seal completely sealed the surrounding void, instantly cutting off his chance to escape. Many of his escape skills could not be used at all.

In addition, the mind wizard also had some unique skills. He could think of ways to avoid fighting Dao Dragon head-on, and then wait for the experts from the Purple Cloud Pavilion to arrive.

However, Jian Wushuang’s ice and fire realm, which was performed by the ice and fire swimming dragon ruler, also completely cut off this possibility.

All the life-saving and entangling skills were restricted by Jian Wushuang.

It could be said that he had met his nemesis!

Since he could not use these life-saving skills, he had to fight Dao Dragon head-on. In addition, Jian Wushuang also attacked with all his strength. Of course, he had to die.

“Heart shaman, this old man is very famous and has many skills. I didn’t think I could kill him, but he died.” Dao Dragon stood in the void and looked at Jian Wushuang with a strange look.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, this heart shaman is an elder of the Purple Cloud Pavilion. Because of his witchcraft poison and weapon-refining skills, he is highly regarded in the Purple Cloud Pavilion. Now that you and I have killed him, we are in big trouble!”

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed and he nodded secretly.

“I have accumulated a lot of hatred with the Purple Cloud Pavilion. It’s not that the Purple Cloud Pavilion hasn’t thought of ways to kill me, but they just don’t have the ability. Now, it’s not a big deal for me to kill the heart shaman. But you are different. If nothing goes wrong, from today on, the Purple Cloud Pavilion will try to kill you,” Dao Dragon added.

“I know, but since I dared to kill someone, I must be mentally prepared,” Jian Wushuang said.

“That’s good. In that case, you take care of yourself. I’ve completed my task, so I’ll take my leave,” Dao Dragon said.

“Thank you, Lord Dao Dragon.”

Jian Wushuang thanked him and soon Dao Dragon left.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and an interspatial ring immediately floated toward him.

This interspatial ring was the one left behind by the heart witch after her death.

“Lord Dao Dragon is very polite. He did a lot to kill the heart witch, but he didn’t even look at her interspatial ring and left it to me?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

The heart witch was a rank seven True Saint and an elder of the Purple Cloud Pavilion. She was proficient in voodoo and weapon refining. Her reputation was shocking, so she must be rich.

Although Jian Wushuang did not have any treasures in the interspatial ring, he could guess that the value of the interspatial ring was more than that of an ordinary peak rank seven True Saint.

However, Dao Dragon was not interested in such a big fortune at all. He kept it all for himself.

Obviously, Dao Dragon thought that Jian Wushuang was the reason why he could kill the heart witch. He did not accept the reward. On the other hand, Dao Dragon probably wanted to make friends with Jian Wushuang, a top genius.

“Lord Dao Dragon, please help me. I paid seven billion holy elixirs, but I killed four rank six Peak True Saints, one initial rank six True Saint, and most importantly, I killed the heart witch, a rank seven True Saint. I got their interspatial ring. Its value has long surpassed the price I paid, and I made a lot of money.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

He had indeed made a profit this time.

Of course, at the same time, he had also offended the Purple Cloud Pavilion.

…

The Purple Cloud Pavilion.

The overlord of the First Heaven, one of the three pavilions!

In the First Heaven, the Purple Cloud Pavilion had absolute authority, and all the sects and factions were extremely fearful.

And the experts of the Purple Cloud Pavilion were practically unruly no matter where they went in the First Heaven. Very few people dared to make an enemy of the Purple Cloud Pavilion, much less kill an elder of the Purple Cloud Pavilion.

Dao Dragon was the only one who dared to do so in the past million years.

He was strong enough to not be afraid of the Purple Cloud Pavilion. The Purple Cloud Pavilion could not kill him without the help of the Principles Master. Therefore, Dao Dragon was able to live.

As for the others, they were all dead.

Therefore, when the news of the witch body’s death spread to the Purple Cloud Pavilion, the Pavilion Master and the elders of the Purple Cloud Pavilion were furious!

When they learned that the heart shaman’s death was largely due to Jian Wushuang, a rank four True Saint, the killing intent of the Purple Cloud Pavilion’s upper echelons was even more shocking.

“A mere rank four True Saint dares to kill an elder of the Purple Cloud Pavilion!”

“Kill, kill Heavenly Sword Marquis!”

“We can’t kill Dao Dragon, but Heavenly Sword Marquis must die!”

Soon, an order was given.

It was a kill order.

Anyone who belonged to the Purple Cloud Pavilion, including the experts and disciples of the Purple Cloud Pavilion, as well as all the forces and countries under the Purple Cloud Pavilion, who met Heavenly Sword Marquis must be killed!

At the same time, the Intelligence Department of the Purple Cloud Pavilion began to operate and frantically search for Jian Wushuang.

Once they found Jian Wushuang, the Purple Cloud Pavilion would immediately send experts to kill him!
