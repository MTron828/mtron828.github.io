Chapter 573: The Crystal-armored Monster Clan, One of the Three Overlord Clans!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“There are at least one million Demonic Beasts, maybe even as much as 10 million!”

“Look, look at those Demonic Beasts that are covered in Amethyst. They are... The Crystal-armored Monster Clan!”

“Right, the Crystal-armored Monster Clan, one of the three overlord clans on the Monster Continent!”

“Quickly, go tell the Holy Place that the Crystal-armored Monster Clan has lead 10 million Demonic Beasts here!”

An urgent message immediately arrived at the Holy Place and shook everyone.

As the number one expert in the Monster-exterminating League, Temple Master Black Spirit ordered them to resist with everything they had while numerous experts, including seniors who had been in closed-door cultivation for many years, rushed to join them.

The experts in the other three camps were sent to the North Camp.

Even the high-level experts were heading there.

Numerous human experts gathered in the vast plain. 25 Temple Masters arrived, which was every Temple master except the several who were currently traveling in other worlds and unable to return in time.

Even Temple Master Black Spirit personally came.

When they saw the endless horde of Demonic Beasts, all the human experts wore grim expressions.

The number of Demonic Beasts definitely amounted to over 10 million.

Most importantly, those Demonic Beasts were very powerful. Most of them were comparable to Cloud Realm experts, including many Rank Seven and Eight Monsters who were as powerful as Divine Generals.

There were more than 30 Monster Kings.

Their overall strength was far superior to that of the human population.

Among the Demonic Beasts, some of the huge Demonic Beast posed even more of a threat to the human experts.

“Crystal-armored Monster Clan!”

There were countless Demonic Beasts spread out over the Monster Continent, divided into many different races. Under normal circumstances, the weaker ones would become the vassal of the stronger ones, just like in the human world.

There were three races that were more powerful than the rest of the monster population.

They were known as three overlord clans: The Bone Dragon Clan, the Crystal-armored Monster Clan, and the Demonic Ape Clan.

Their leaders, called Monster Emperors, were Bone Dragon Emperor, Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, and Demonic Ape Emperor.

This time, it was the Crystal-armored Monster Clan that had launched an attack on the Human Territory.

They suddenly stopped in an orderly manner and a golden throne appeared above them as a purple-robed young man with a wicked expression slowly materialized on it.

He was beautiful, with eyes that radiated a wicked purple light, which was terrifying.

However, unlike a normal human, he had two curved purple horns on his forehead.

He was currently sitting on the throne while looking at numerous human experts in front of him.

The faces of many Temple Masters fell when they saw this purple-robed wicked man.

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor!” Temple Master Pure Moon mumbled with a flicker of terror in his eyes.

As one of the three Monster Emperors, Crystal-armored Monster Emperor was much more powerful than those Human Temple Masters.

The only one that was capable of fighting against Crystal-armored Monster Emperor was Temple Master Black Spirit.

She was currently standing in front of the army, but she took a step and instantly reappeared before the purple-robed wicked man.

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor.” Temple Master Black Spirit spoke.

“Temple Master Black Spirit.” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor responded in a hoarse voice while looking at her. In the whole Human League, only Temple Master Black Spirit was able to arouse his attention.

“Thousands of years ago, I made an agreement with you three Monster Emperors. Do you remember that?” Temple Master Black Spirit said coldly.

“Yes, I do.” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor nodded slightly. “Because of this agreement, you have lived in peace for the last thousand years.”

“So why are you here? Do you want to break the agreement and have an all-out war with us?” Temple Master Black Spirit asked.

Upon hearing this, Crystal-armored Monster Emperor’s face fell.

”?Break the agreement and have an all-out war??”

Although he was one of the three Monster Emperors, he was still in awe of Temple Master Black Spirit. Unless it was necessary, he would not be willing to go back on the agreement and declare war on the humans.

However, this time...

“That compass is a treasure related to the Ancient World Token. As long as I get it, I can receive the Ancient World Token, so no matter what it takes, I have to acquire it.”A flicker of firmness flashed through Crystal-armored Monster Emperor’s eyes.

“Temple Master Black Spirit, I’m not interested in fighting to the death with you. I’m here because of one person. As long as you give him to me, I’ll leave immediately,” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor said.

“One person?” Temple Master Black Spirit narrowed her eyes. “Who is this person?”

“He is a Divine Emperor in your league, called Sword Emperor,” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor replied, “As far as I know, he is an outsider and hasn’t been on the Monster Continent for long, so he should not be important to your Human League. As long as you give him to me, I’ll keep my promise.”

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor’s voice reverberated through the entire area. Countless human experts heard it clearly.

“Sword Emperor? The one who recently became a Divine Emperor while still in Saint Realm?”

“Those Demonic Beasts actually came for Sword Emperor?”

“Sword Emperor really is a troublemaker. He provoked Emperor Golden Snake, causing him to have a Life-death Duel with him. Now he has gotten us into trouble with the Crystal-armored Monster Clan.”

“Just an outsider. If Crystal-armored Monster Emperor will keep his promise, then give him Sword Emperor.”

A hot discussion rose among the human camp. Many experts felt resentment towards Jian Wushuang.

If Jian Wushuang was a human expert from the Monster Continent, they might stand up for him. But, since he was an outsider, things were different. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Temple Master Iceberg, who stood in the human camp, was also shocked by the Monster Emperor’s words.
