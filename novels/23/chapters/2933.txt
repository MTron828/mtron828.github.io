Chapter 2934: Sword Heavenly Marquis

——

Under the guidance of Xue Dong King, Jian wushuang came to the counter in the center of the hall. A thin Elder in a Taoist robe was dozing off.

“Elder Qiu, don’t sleep,” Xue Dong King shouted.

The thin Elder in a Taoist robe moved his eyelids slightly and then opened his eyes.

After opening his eyes, he glanced at Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King and asked, “What’s the matter?”

“This little brother next to me wants to join the Heaven-cleaving Alliance,” Xue Dong King said.

“Where’s the Heaven-cleaving token?” The thin Elder, who Xue Dong King referred to as Elder Qiu, reached out his hand.

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang handed over his Heaven-cleaving token.

Elder Qiu glanced at the token and nodded slightly. “What is your name, or what title do you use?”

“Title?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

“Brother Jian, there are only a few people in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance like me who are willing to show their true faces. Most of them wear gray robes and masks to hide their identities. Naturally, they won’t use their real names, so most of them will give themselves a title. If you want to hide your identity in the future, you can also give yourself a title,” Xue Dong King said.

Jian Wushuang immediately fell into deep thought.

Title… he still remembered that when he was young, he used to travel around in the green fire world under the name of Swordsman.

Later, when he came to the 10,000 chaotic worlds, he also became famous as Sword Emperor.

Now, when it came to the title, Jian Wushuang thought of Sword Emperor.

But soon, he shook his head. Sword Emperor was a very common title in the Beginning Divine Realm.

Many experts in the Beginning Divine Realm were called Swordsman, Sword Emperor, and Sword Saint. Naturally, Sword Emperor was a good title.

Jian Wushuang thought of a more special title.

After pondering for a moment, Jian Wushuang finally thought of a title. “I’ll call you Sword Heavenly Marquis.”

“Sword Heavenly Marquis?” Xue Dong King looked over and nodded. “It’s a very domineering title.”

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly.

Sword Heavenly Marquis was the first name that came to his mind.

It was the place where he was born, but unfortunately, the Sword Heavenly Marquis mansion no longer existed after so many years.

Elder Qiu, who was standing in front of the counter, waved his hand and left the words ‘Sword Heavenly Marquis’ on the Heaven-cleaving token.

“Leave your communication token here. I’ll inform you when the test is ready,” Elder Qiu said.

Jian Wushuang handed his message token to the Elder and asked, “How long will it take?”

“The test of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance will be held every once in a while. Each time, dozens of experts from hundreds of nests will gather to take part in the test. It has been nine years since the last test, and there is less than a year left. You can stay here and wait, or you can leave on your own. When the test is over, you can come back,” the Elder said.

“It’s only been a year. I’ll just wait here.” Jian Wushuang smiled and looked at Xue Dong King. “Xue Dong King, thank you so much.”

“Don’t worry. It’s rare to see a talent that I admire. Anyway, I have nothing to do these days, so I’ll stay here with you. I’ll also take a look at some of the missions that have been released recently.” Xue Dong King smiled, then he looked at the Elder and said, “Old man, show me some of the new missions that have been released recently in the nearby territories.”

The Elder glanced at Xue Dong King and casually threw a jade slip over. “Here’s the mission list. Take a look for yourself.”

Xue Dong King took the jade slip and found a seat beside Jian Wushuang.

“Brother Jian, it won’t be long before you become a member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Your strength is no less than mine. You can take a look at the mission list.” Xue Dong King also put the jade slip in front of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and the two began to examine the jade slip together.

“One-star ordinary task: Kill a Peak Divine Master.”

“Task location: Blood Smoke Cave.”

“Task reward: 400,000 sacred elixirs, plus a third-grade offensive holy treasure.”

…

“One-star ordinary task: Protect an Earth Divine Master for 100 years.”

“Task location: Luo Something Realm.”

“Mission reward: 600,000 sacred elixirs.”

…

“3-star ordinary mission: Kill the three Shadow Saints.”

“Mission reward: 2,000,000 sacred elixirs, two superior third-grade offensive holy treasures, and one superior protective armor holy treasure.”

…

Jian Wushuang took a casual glance at the first three missions, but he was shocked by them. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

There were many special missions in the jade slip. Each mission only had a simple introduction, but there was no detailed process or background.

But generally, the rewards for these missions were extremely high!

“Just killing a Peak Great Divine Master can get me 400,000 sacred elixirs and a third-grade offensive holy treasure. Isn’t the reward too high?

“Or is it that this Peak Great Divine Master is unusual and difficult to kill?” Jian Wushuang could not help but ask.

“No, if I’m not wrong, that Peak Great Divine Master’s strength is average. With our strength, we can kill him easily. The reason why the mission is still here and the reward is so high should be the location of the mission, which is the Blood Smoke Cave,” Xue Dong King said.

“Is there anything special about the Blood Smoke Cave?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Sword Heavenly Marquis, you don’t come from the surrounding territories, so you don’t know anything about it.” Xue Dong King had already changed the way he addressed Jian Wushuang.

Previously, he had always called Jian Wushuang brother Jian, which made Jian wushuang feel very strange. Therefore, he asked Xue Dong King to directly call him Sword Heavenly Marquis.

“The Blood Smoke Cave is a famous danger zone in the surrounding area. In this danger zone, let alone Divine Masters, even ordinary Immortal Saints have a certain chance of dying, while ordinary Invincible Divine Masters have at least a 70% chance of dying,” Xue Dong King said in a deep voice, “There is a 70% chance of dying. Those Invincible Divine Masters who have already become members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance will definitely not take the risk.”

“And most of the Immortal Saints would not risk breaking into the Blood Smoke Cave for a mere 400,000 sacred elixirs. Therefore, the reward for this mission is not high, but too low. If the person who issued the mission can increase the reward to 600,000 or 700,000 sacred elixirs, then the Invincible Divine Master or the Immortal Saint should go and take the risk.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood, but then he asked, “Since the Blood Smoke Cave is so dangerous, how did the Peak Divine Master who was on the mission break in? Is he still alive?”

“Who knows? In short, although the mission is only one star, I’m not interested,” Xue Dong King said.
