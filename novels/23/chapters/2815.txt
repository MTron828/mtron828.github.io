Chapter 2816: The Test

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

There were many dangerous places in the secret realm, but these places were determined by the strength of the cultivator.

Jian Wushuang was only a Divine Master, so the danger he encountered was naturally only for Divine Masters.

He kept moving forward. With his current strength, he easily passed through the first and second dangerous places.

Even in the third danger zone, which was in the cemetery, Jian Wushuang encountered many corpse puppets along the way. Some golden-armored corpse puppets even appeared, but they were all easily taken care of by Jian Wushuang.

Soon, Jian Wushuang arrived at the core of the secret realm, where the invincible Immortal Saints and the bodies of the two rule masters were located.

When he arrived...

Buzz!

A strange light suddenly condensed in front of Jian Wushuang.

The light was gray and gradually condensed into a human figure.

It was a simple-looking gray-robed elder. He was Elder Gu, the spirit of the secret realm. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Greetings, Elder Gu.”

Jian Wushuang immediately bowed humbly when he saw him.

“Little guy, you’re here again.”

With his hands behind his back, Elder Gu fixed his indifferent eyes on Jian Wushuang. “Before you left, I told you to come back after you broke through to become an Immortal Saint. But now, you’re obviously far from becoming an Immortal Saint.”

“I did, but this time, my world has encountered a great crisis. I have no choice but to come here again. I want to ask for your help, Elder Gu,” Jian Wushuang said.

“You want me to help you?” Elder Gu could not help but smile. “Little guy, are you mistaken? I’m just a spirit of the secret realm. I can’t leave this secret realm, so how can I help you?”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang said, “I know you control everything in this secret realm. Like the cemetery I walked through before, those corpse puppets are also under your control. I came here this time to ask for some corpse puppets from you so that I can fight for my world.”

“Is that so?” Elder Gu asked, “I do have corpse puppets, but they were refined by my master when he was alive. They are all my master’s things. I have been guarding this secret realm according to my master’s instructions. Everything has to be done according to the rules. If you want to get the treasures in this secret realm, you have to pass the corresponding tests, even for these insignificant corpse puppets.”

“I know, but what kind of test do I need to pass to get these corpse puppets?” Jian Wushuang asked directly.

“If it’s a test...” Elder Gu began to ponder. After a moment, he spoke again, “Master has left many tests in this secret realm, but most of them are aimed at the Immortal Saint and above. You are only a Divine Master after all. The chances of you passing even the simplest test left by master are very slim. Moreover, these tests are life-and-death tests. If you are careless, you will be doomed. Therefore, I advise you not to try.”

“Is the probability of passing very low?” Jian Wushuang frowned, but then he said seriously, “Time is tight, and I can’t think of any other way to resolve this crisis. I have no choice but to try.”

“Are you really going to try?” Elder Gu narrowed his eyes, “Su Han, it’s not that I look down on you, but Master’s methods are far beyond your imagination. The simplest test he left is aimed at the soul. If you are not careful, your soul will be completely destroyed. If you don’t listen to my advice and try, the probability of you getting out of the test is much lower than 10%!”

Elder Gu obviously had some expectations for Jian Wushuang, so he did not want Jian Wushuang to choose this road that was close to death.

His words were also obviously with an air of persuasion.

However, he did not know that his persuasion made Jian Wushuang even more determined.

“A test on the soul?” Jian Wushuang smiled in his heart. “Elder Gu, I have decided to accept this test.”

“Since you’re so determined, I won’t force you.” Elder Gu waved his hand and a space passage appeared in the void.

“This space passage leads to the place where you’ll be tested. You can accept the test as long as you can endure the test for six hours. If you don’t die after six hours, you’ll pass.”

“Take care of yourself.”

Elder Gu sighed.

Jian Wushuang bowed slightly to Elder Gu and then stepped into the space passage without any hesitation.

Seeing Jian Wushuang enter the space passage, Elder Gu shook his head secretly.

In his opinion, Jian Wushuang should not be able to pass this test. However, since Jian Wushuang wanted to hold on, he could not stop him.

“I hope this little guy is lucky.” Elder Gu could only think so.

...

After entering the space passage, Jian Wushuang directly appeared in a dark void.

The dark void was boundless, just like the dark void where Elder Gu had asked him to compete with the Saber Master and the others for the universe.

As soon as Jian Wushuang entered the dark void, he did not have time to check his surroundings.

Boom!

A strong soul power surged up crazily.

The soul power was extremely powerful. It suddenly appeared in the dark void and was almost solid.

In an instant, a huge soul storm took shape in the dark void. The soul storm was still expanding at an alarming speed.

“What’s this?”

Looking at the soul storm in front of him, Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted. He was about to dodge, but he found that the same soul power had burst out in several places nearby, forming the same soul storm.

The soul storm appeared in every corner around him, completely blocking his escape route, leaving him no room to escape.

As the soul storm continued to expand, Jian Wushuang was instantly sucked into the soul storm.

Rumble!

As soon as he fell into the storm, a large amount of soul power immediately rushed toward him crazily.

The soul power from all directions poured into his mind and crazily rushed toward the material soul in his sea of consciousness.

“It’s a soul attack!”

“And it’s a continuous soul attack.”

Jian Wushuang’s face was solemn. When he sensed the soul power rushing toward him, a purple bell immediately rose from the surface of his body.

The Purple Emperor Bell was not only a protective treasure, but it also had a certain defensive effect against soul attacks.

Now, the power of the surrounding soul power was greatly weakened after passing through the Purple Emperor Bell.
