Chapter 2295 The Reason behind Everything Part II

Jian Wushuang read on.“I had thought of everything, but nothing would work. I could not even restore the Seven Star Divine Realm’s spiritual influence of heaven and earth. If I wasn’t dead, maybe I could have.”

“But because of that, I had a thought. I needed to create another me, another Perfect Chaotic Lifeform.”

Jian Wushuang was taken aback.

According to Xuan Yi, the Perfect Chaotic Lifeform was created naturally, and there had only been one from the birth of the Absolute Beginning Divine World till now.

To create such a lifeform artificially? 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Was that possible?

“Even I thought that the idea was crazy. But no matter how crazy it was, it was the Seven Star Black Sect’s, and my own last hope. I started to research.”

“First, to create the Perfect Chaotic Lifeform, he needed to be optimised at every aspect of a Cultivator.”

“From that Ancient battle onwards, I tried countless times, and finally created a brand new cultivating system. It was Inverse Cultivation!”

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Inverse Cultivation!

Inverse Cultivation was indeed created by his master.

He had created it after countless failures to form a Perfect Chaotic Lifeform.

“So is the ultimate goal of the Inverse Cultivation the Perfect Chaotic Lifeform?” Jian Wushuang murmured as he read on.

“The Inverse Cultivation system starts off with the Perfect Foundation, then the Perfect Chaotic Holy Body, finally the Perfect Chaotic Lifeform... the creation of this system was the first step to my plan. There was hope. But I did not realise the cultivating requirements were too strict, countless guys from the First Era could not even perfect the Perfect Foundation.”

“I was in despair, but a lucky fellow cultivated the Perfect Foundation, he was Emperor Bai!”

He had heard Emperor Bai mention Xuan Yi teaching him Inverse Cultivation before. He did not know Xuan Yi was testing him amongst countless other experts, but only he made it to Perfect Foundation.

“I thought of countless ways to help him improve, and he did not disappoint. He passed the Inverse Cultivation Test and made it to the Perfect Chaotic Holy Body.”

“But unfortunately, I realised he could never become the Perfect Chaotic Lifeform.”

“I could tell. He lacked something from birth. My experiment ended in failure.”

“But that did not bring me down. I saw hope. I realise from Emperor Bai that the deficiency came from birth. You could only rectify it if you changed the factors of the birth, and before it.”

“The First Era experts under the barren spiritual energy all came with that deficiency to reach Perfect Chaotic Lifeform. So, I formed a whole new environment.”

“That environment is where my head was at that battlefield!”

“My head is the source of all power, it is the origin. Even though I had collapsed, it was still the head of the Perfect Chaotic Lifeform. With countless tries, I re-formed whatever power was left from it, and created the Green Fire World!”

Jian Wushuang could no longer control himself.

“Indeed, the Green Fire World had been created from that head, from master’s remaining energy and life.” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“I am the Perfect Chaotic Lifeform, and all those that are born from that world will, therefore, be my offspring. Cultivators from there naturally will be able to become Perfect Chaotic Lifeforms, making up for that deficiency.”

“Next, just as I had expected, the Green Fire World started to prosper with more cultivators. I passed down the Inverse Cultivation via many channels, and finally, the first Inverse Cultivation expert from the Green Fire World, Emperor Qing, was born. Although she made up for the deficiency, she was not able to combine all her perfect factors together.”

“To mitigate that, I created a ‘seasoner’, the Universal Dao Scripture!”

Jian Wushuang was taken aback once again.

“The Universal Dao Scripture is indeed special!”

Jian Wushuang had known that it was very unique from the very beginning.

He had even suspected that he was able to absorb quickly due to it.

Looked like he was right.

Not only was it extraordinary, but it was also part of the Inverse Cultivation.

Only when one had cultivated the Universal Dao Scripture would one able to combine all the perfect factors learnt from Inverse Cultivation to become truly perfect.

Emperor Bai could not become the Perfect Chaotic Lifeform due to his deficiency.

Emperor Qing had collapsed too soon without combining the factors.

Next...

“Soon after I created the Universal Dao Scripture, the second Inverse Cultivation expert from Green Fire World was you!”
