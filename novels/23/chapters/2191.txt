Chapter 2192 A figure

“Broke! The crimson shield broke!”“Sword Emperor managed to break the opponent’s strongest defence skill!”

“Is he going to succeed?”

The experts from the Eternal Chaotic World were excited.

“No, it is not so simple. Even though this attack is extremely powerful, more than seventy percent of the power was used to break the crimson shield. Blood Emperor may be able to defend against the remaining power. He could be severely injured, but not killed!” Emperor Bai said.

“What?” The experts around turned pale.

Even after destroying the crimson shield, Blood Emperor could survive this attack?

“Oh no. It still lacks some power.” Emperor Thirteen too frowned.

At the centre of the battlefield, the seventh seal continued to descend on Blood Emperor.

Blood Qi continued to?erupt from Blood Emperor as the Ancient Blood Beast roared in anger.

The Blood Emperor laughed.

“Come, lets see if the remaining power from the seventh seal can kill me today?”

“If I survive, all of you will die!”

“Hahaha~~~” His crazy laughter reverberated throughout the battlefield.

The huge Ancient Blood Beast held up its hands and held on tightly to the descending province.

The majestic province descended extremely slowly under the resistance from the Ancient Blood Beast. During the entire process, its power was continuously weakened. If this continued, the seal would not be able to kill the Blood Emperor after it destroyed the Ancient Blood Beast.

“Sword Emperor gave his all and even cast soul ignition, yet he still failed to kill Blood Emperor?”

“Is the Eternal Chaotic World done for?”

“Looks like fate decided that the Eternal Chaotic World should perish today!”

Howls of bitterness could be heard from the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World.

These experts had no hope left.

Even Emperor Bai looked devastated.

Jian Wushuang was their last hope. However, this last attack of his did not seem like it could kill Blood Emperor.

As for Emperor Thirteen, he could not kill Blood Emperor even though he had incredible fighting power.

If Blood Emperor survived, that meant that they were dead meat.

The Eternal Chaotic World was done for.

Many different emotions surfaced.

At the centre of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang turned even more crazy as he lost his consciousness. His eyes were bloodshot as he stared straight at Blood Emperor.

Right then, in the majestic province in front of him.

A human figure appeared slowly.

This figure appeared out of nowhere with no warning at all.

The power of the seventh seal was about to run out, yet a figure had appeared from within at this point in time.

Once it appeared, everyone looked over at it.

“That is…?” The experts from the Eternal Chaotic World were stunned as they looked at the figure.

It was a well-built man in white clothes. He was smiling brightly and warmly. It felt peaceful.

He appeared out of nowhere and had no aura. It was like he was nothing but air.

Once people looked at him, they could no longer look away.

When he saw the figure who appeared out of nowhere, Blood Emperor frowned. He started to feel uncertain as the bad feeling turned even stronger.

Emperor Thirteen too was looking at this human figure.

“This old man… He has got a back up plan.” Emperor Thirteen muttered to himself in a voice only he could hear.

As for Jian Wushuang, he was using all his strength to keep himself conscious.

At the same time, he recognized this figure who had appeared.

“Mas… Master.” Jian Wushuang spoke with great difficulty.

Master… Jian Wushuang had only had one master since the day he had started cultivating.

This man was… Xuan Yi!

“Hi, little one.” Xuan Yi smiled and greeted Jian Wushuang.

The warm smile caused Jian Wushuang to feel relaxed.

Xuan Yi then looked down at everyone.

When he saw Emperor Thirteen, a glint of surprise flashed over his eyes, as he quickly moved his vision. Finally, he fixed his vision on Blood Emperor.

“A member of the Blood Clan?”

“Haha. This formation is interesting. It is a pity that this is too malicious.”

Xuan Yi muttered to himself.

At the same time, he noticed the seventh seal of the Nine Province Seal. There was only about twenty percent of power left in this seal.

With this power, it could severely injure Blood Emperor. However, there was no way it could kill Blood Emperor.

“My disciple, your master shall help you today.”

Xuan Yi said as he raised one of his arms slowly.

On his right index figure, a special energy gathered as it flew towards Blood Emperor.

It felt like the energy did not exist at all.

He pointed his finger very casually.

The experts around the battlefield were curious as to why Xuan Yi had done that.

They did not understand what the figure was trying to do.

He pointed his finger at Blood Emperor?

What was next?

Why was there no power or momentum felt?

The seventh seal of the Nine Province Seal did not get more powerful.

It seemed like nothing had changed.

While everyone was curious about why Xuan Yi had done that…

Boom!

The space shuddered. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The heaven and earth that the experts were in started to crumble at an incredible speed.

Yes, it crumbled.

Large amounts of space started to collapse in on themselves. Even the earth started to sink.

Hum~~~

As for the Opposing Blood Formation that covered the entire Three Emperors World, it started to quickly dissipate and shrink as though it was being suppressed by a terrifying power.

Within moments, the Opposing Blood Formation, which covered the entire Three Emperors World, shrank to the mere size of the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds.

And the shrinking had yet to stop.

At the same time, a suppressive power far greater than what anyone had experienced before was felt.

This non-specific suppressive power did not belong to any expert.

It came from the heavens.

It came from the earth!

This suppressive power came from heaven and earth. It was the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth!
