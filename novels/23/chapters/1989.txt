Chapter 1990: Jiu Jue Sword Mansion

“Passionate about gathering exquisite sword principles and he constantly challenged many sword experts to bet with sword principles. He was truly a sword geek,” Jian Wushuang smiled. “However, regardless of if it was sword principle, saber skill or other secret skills, it would be about quality over quantity. Even though he mastered countless sword principles, there were definitely many sword experts who were more powerful than he was.”

“That’s true. This sword geek, Jiu Jue, was considered a top grade expert in ancient times. But there was a distance between him and the peak in ancient times,” Jian Yi smiled. “However, if he were to be put in this era, Jiu Jue would definitely be a high and mighty existence. There were many Great Emperors in this era that would only be a nuisance in front of him.”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows but he could understand why.

Anyone from ancient times was, of course, not someone anyone in the second era could compare to.

The sword geek, Jiu Jue, was definitely a top grade expert in ancient times. If he were to be in the current era, he could march over unhindered.

“Regardless, Jiu Jue definitely possessed a bunch of sword principles. To me, they would definitely be useful. It seems that I have to fight for the nine sword steles too,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Jian Wushuang made up his mind and immediately instructed, “Jian Yi, you stay back to look after Green Fire World. I will make a trip to Jiu Jue Sword Mansion.”

“Master, you don’t need me to go with you?” Jian Yi asked.

“There’s no need to,” Jian Wushuang waved.

Ever since he had broken through to the seventh step and possessed the perfect Chaotic divine body, he had been different from before.

He might have yet to catch up with Jian Yi in terms of power, but in terms of defensive power, even ten Jian Yis wouldn’t be his match.

He would be able to deal with everything if he headed over to Jiu Jue Sword Mansion alone. If he really couldn’t survive when he ran into danger, the outcome would be the same even if Jian Yi helped.

Jian Wushuang didn’t delay any further but departed.

“Jiu Jue Sword Mansion isn’t too far away from Green Fire World. If I rush my journey at my top speed, I will be able to reach it in a few days. I should be able to make it in time.”

Jian Wushuang was looking forward to it as well.

In the ancient battlefield, not only him, but also many sword experts, who had sensed the birth of Jiu Jue Sword Mansion, received the news and rushed over simultaneously.

There were even experts who didn’t have expertise in sword principles that rushed to Jiu Jue Sword Mansion.

The nine sword steles might be useless to cultivators who weren’t good at sword principle. However, if they could obtain it and sell it, it absolutely could be exchanged for abundant resources. Hence, there were countless experts that swarmed over it like bees.

…

In a barren land with no vigor in sight.

Then, there was a tall pavilion towering in the barren land above.

The pavilion door was wide open and it was mysterious.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were two figures standing side by side outside the pavilion. The two Sir Gods appeared and glanced at the pavilion before they entered it.

“There are another two who want it.”

“Including the two of them, there are more than a hundred experts in Jiu Jue Sword Mansion.”

“There are a hundred and five of them. I reckon there are still people who are rushing here.”

There were two purple-robed figures hiding in the void outside the pavilion. They were paying close attention to the pavilion.

The two of them were assigned to watch the pavilion by Sanctuary Alliance. Not only outside the pavilion, but there were also experts that were assigned to watch from within as well.

Sanctuary Alliance would pay close attention to whichever cave dwelling came into the world or any opportunity on the ancient battlefield once it was announced to the public.

For instance, Sanctuary Alliance was very concerned about Jiu Jue Sword Mansion then.

Just then…

Swoosh!

There was a flash of flowing light that burst out of the nearby void. It didn’t stop but leaped into the pavilion without any pause. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The two purple-robed figures stared at the pavilion with their eyes wide open.

“This speed is so fast!”

“This is too fast. Even an ordinary Emperor God wouldn’t be able to achieve such speed. He at least should be a Peak Emperor God to travel at such a speed. However, the person who just entered, I didn’t see his face but his aura was only of a Sir God? That’s weird.”

Although he was confused, he didn’t think much.

It looked like it was only a pavilion but it was a mystery inside the pavilion.

It was a huge, barren world. The world was so huge that no one could see its border.

“This is Jiu Jue Sword Mansion?” Jian Wushuang smiled while he looked around.

“The biggest opportunity in Jiu Jue Sword Mansion is definitely the nine sword steles. Of course, there are only eight left. The eight steles are scattered to eight different corners. I have to take time to find them,” Jian Wushuang muttered and plunged to another direction in the void.

He wasn’t sure of the structure and environment in Jiu Jue Sword Mansion so he could only wander around.

But it was not long after he entered Jiu Jue Sword Mansion.

“Hong!”

There was a vigorous roar that sounded from the void afar. At the same time, there were ripples of divine power.

The loud roar and the ripples of divine power, Jian Wushuang naturally didn’t find it foreign.

“I just entered Jiu Jue Sword Mansion for a while. I shouldn’t reach the eight sword steles so soon right? But the ripples of divine power are obviously from a pitch battle,” Jian Wushuang was surprised. He didn’t hesitate but plunged in the direction of the source of the divine power ripples.

At the end of the direction in which Jian Wushuang plunged:

Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were two figures, a male and a female, traveling forward at a high speed.

The two of them looked terrified and judging from their traveling speed, they were running for their lives.

Behind the two of them, there was a figure that carried an aura that had reached the level of Emperor God who caught up with them.

“Mo Yu, I’m sorry that I dragged you down with me,” a middle-aged man said as he wielded his sword and carried two on his back. It meant that he had carried three on his back originally. Now, he was soaring with rage and there was fire burning in his eyes.

“You and I are best friends and we are wandering together. We naturally have to go through trials and tribulations together. Why did you apologize? It’s just that we never expected that the golden-headed lion would be so persistent,” Sir God Mo Yu in a simple grey robe clenched his teeth and spat angrily.

“Blame me. I shouldn’t have offended the golden-head lion back then. He is a madman. A madman!!!” The middle-aged man carrying three swords said.

“Forget about that for now. We have to figure out a way to shake off the madman. Otherwise…” Sir God Mo Yu was distressed.

Although both of them were powerful Sir Gods, the one who was after them was an Emperor God, a mad Emperor God!
