Chapter 2689: Battling The Seven Absolute Palace Master

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The five-thousand-foot-high Golden God Shadow appeared once again behind Jian Wushuang and looked down upon all things in heaven and earth—intimidating them.

Jian Wushuang was like an emperor in the golden prison.

Buzz...

Powerful domain oppression was acting on those Seven Absolute Palace experts. The experts could feel that their strength was limited to a certain extent.

“What’s this?”

“A prison? And one with domain powers?”

“The domain...is so powerful!”

The Seven Absolute Palace experts frowned as all of them could feel the golden prison’s sturdy and solid strength around them.

They were all trapped within the prison.

“Divine Sword Official Army, kill!” Jian Wushuang pointed toward the Seven Absolute Palace experts in front of him and commanded.

Murderous intent instantly rose in those 50 Divine Sword Official Army soldiers.

Long Shan roared and said, “Everybody, Alliance Master has spent such a high price and time to create us the Divine Sword Official Army and today is our first battle. Let’s show the Alliance Master our combat powers. Listen to my orders. People, go in groups of five and kill!”

The attack command resounded!

The cold killing intent diffused as the 50 Divine Sword Official Army soldiers immediately went into groups of five and off they went charging at the many Seven Absolute Palace experts.

Shocking shouts of killing echoed in the void which shook heaven and earth.

“Kill!”

The many Seven Absolute Palace experts also immediately came forth to greet the attack and both sides were in a heated battle.

The war had broken out.

“Su Han!”

The Seven Absolute Palace Master’s cold eyes stared hard and hostilely at Jian Wushuang as an endless evil aura permeated the area.

Jian Wushuang smiled coldly at him before soon made his move.

Jian Wushuang appeared in front of the Seven Absolute Palace Master in a jiffy as though he teleported before coldly thrusting the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

The gloomy Seven Absolute Palace Master had a purple spear in his hand.

“Although Sword Alliance Master Su Han is only a High-level Heaven Ultimate God, he was capable of killing the former Purple Beast Alliance Master and should not be underestimated or taken lightly.”

A majestic divine power surged as the Seven Absolute Palace Master had fully displayed his own strength.

The purple spear in his hand made a sharp forward stab producing endless power of destruction. The power of destruction formed a huge vortex of destruction in the void—like a wild beast opening its big wide mouth fiercely at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang who was supported by the sword intent from his longsword that carried the powers of two Space-time Blades wanted to strangle and break everything in front of him.

The two instantly collided.

Bang!

A low sound like two heavy objects collided was heard as two shots of terrifying powers exploded before colliding head-on in the void.

At the same time as the powers collision, Jian Wushuang’s perfect sword world of 100,000 miles hit the Principle World displayed by the Seven Absolute Palace Master and caused the Principle World to be oppressed and almost disintegrated in just a brief moment.

“How is his Sword World so strong?” Seven Absolute Palace Master was astonished. His Principle World was completely crushed as he was affected by a great shock—instantly weakening his overall strength. He was perplexed because he had learned the Destruction Law which had one of the strongest offensive powers among the laws!

His spear technique was also extremely good, not to mention that his own divine power was even more tyrannical. Even if he was under the double oppression of Jian Wushuang’s Sword World and golden prison domain, he was certain it would not affect his offensive powers. However, he ended up recalling himself with a slight advantage after colliding against Jian Wushuang’s Sword World.

Rumbling... The divine power spread in heaven and earth as both of them finally pulled apart with Jian Wushuang sent staggering back a short distance.

“Indeed, anyone who learns the Destruction Law has fierce offensive powers.” Jian Wushuang was admiring the power of the Destruction Law.

Soon after Jian Wushuang stood firm and raised his hand.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!

Nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords appeared in front of him. Each of those nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords was filled with Transmigration strength. Jian Wushuang thought it was a hassle to use the nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords individually for attacking so he had fused all nine into one.

Transmigration Sword Formation’s first formation—Heaven’s Edge!

Boom!

A huge black divine sword burst out from the Reincarnation Passage like a huge awl as it pierced through the void and shot toward the Seven Absolute Palace Master.

The Transmigration Sword Formation... Although it was only the first formation, it was performed in its best possible condition. Jian Wushuang had spent more than 40 years in his journey from Northern Darkstar Territory on his Transmigration Law perception which had already reached the first stage’s extreme.

In addition, his divine power was also comparable to a Peak Heaven Ultimate God at that instance. The black divine sword had shocking power when its full potential was being displayed.

The Seven Absolute Palace Master’s pupils shrank sharply when he saw the black divine sword coming through the void.

He immediately sent the spear in his hand out.

Clang!

The sound of metallic objects collided could be heard as the Seven Absolute Palace Master retreated a few steps back. The black sword was also shaken off its route but had only skewed slightly before returning to its original position and continued to shoot forward.

“This sword formation is so powerful.”

The Seven Absolute Palace Master tightened his grip around his spear before greeting the sword formation attack.

The black divine sword attacked again and again, but Seven Absolute Palace Master was able to parry it off. However, the Seven Absolute Palace Master was a little gloomy after the repeated attack.

“I have fought again and again with this sword formation that even my divine body has been affected. My divine body will sustain further damage if this carries on, but this Su Han...is only remotely controlling the sword formation to attack me with his action merely consuming some of his divine power. I’ll suffer if this continues.”

“I can’t go on like this. Let’s just use that trump card!”

The Seven Absolute Palace Master’s eyes were cold as a gush of divine power surged from within him.

Buzz!

A weird figure that condensed from Destruction Law appeared in the void out of thin air. It was a destructive clone formed by the Seven Absolute Palace Master based on his own comprehension of the Destruction Law that could only last for a brief moment.

The destruction clone stood in the black divine sword’s path.

The Seven Absolute Palace Master rushed toward Jian Wushuang.

On his way, a monstrous destructive force had begun to condense in his spear.

“Destructive Dragon Lord Spear!”

The spear that carried endless destructive power exploded all of a sudden.
