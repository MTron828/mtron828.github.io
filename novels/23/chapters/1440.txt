Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Dead silent!

The entire universe was dead silent!

The countless Universe God from Hei Longshan stared at demon-like Jian Wushuang whose hands were covered with fresh blood.

Everyone shivered in fear from the bottom of their hearts.

“Too… too strong!”

“Demon, he’s a demon!”

“Such a demon, how could we match him evenly?”

The Universe Gods from Hei Longshan shouted.

They saw the earlier scene clearly.

The ten Kings of Hei Longshan had joined forces and became a war formation, demonic dragon knight. But Jian Wushuang swept them off and the ten Kings died!

With his thought, thousands of Universe Gods had suddenly died!

The head of Hei Longshan, who was the strongest among them, couldn’t make one single move on Jian Wushuang and was instantly killed.

Everything shocked them and they were dumbfounded.

“Run!”

No one knew who the first person who shouted was. The very next moment, the surrounding countless Universe Gods, including the few heads of Hei Longshan didn’t hesitate but opted to run for their lives.

Run! Run! Run!

The bandits forgot about everything but only knew to run.

In an instant, the large number of bandits who were originally surrounding the spaceship ran away.

The danger vanished into thin air in a sudden.

On the deck, Universe Gods in Hong Ri Mercenary Group looked surprised and it stirred a commotion in everyone’s heart.

Especially Yu Gang. He looked as though he had seen a ghost.

One must know that the people in Hong Ri Mercenary Group were unhappy with Jian Wushuang’s existence earlier. They thought it’d be more than enough for Su Hong to hire Hong Ri Mercenary Group alone. He didn’t need to hire another person. On top of that, Jian Wushuang wasn’t famous and they didn’t think just how strong Jian Wushuang was. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

But then… After Jian Wushuang had showed his power, everyone was taken by surprise.

“Too strong!”

“This… he definitely has the fighting power of one on Universe God ranking list!”

“Mm, definitely. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to defeat Hei Longshan’s troop all alone!”

“This Jian Ke, is he an expert on Universe God ranking list?”

The people in Hong Ri Mercenary Group were hot with emotion.

They finally understood why Su Hong would hire Jian Wushuang.

Just then, swoosh!

Jian Wushuang landed on the deck once again, among the people in Hong Ri Mercenary Group.

The people in Hong Ri Mercenary Group looked at Jian Wushuang again at a close distance and all of them were gulping their saliva, including Yu Gang. There was an unprecedented reverence in their eyes.

Jian Wushuang stole a glance at everyone but didn’t say much. He walked into the cabin before everyone’s gazes.

When Jian Wushuang entered the cabin, the people in Hong Ri Mercenary Group let out a breath of relief.

“Go, go, go. Let’s continue with our journey.”

Yu Gang said and continued to drive the spaceship again.

In the spaceship cabin.

“You live up to your reputation as disciple of Star Palace. I’m impressed.”

Su Hong looked at Jian Wushuang in shock and smiled, “To have you, Jian Wushuang, escort me personally, is my pleasure.”

“Don’t be too happy just yet. After all, our real trouble has yet to arrive,” Jian Wushuang looked solemn.

Su Hong squinted his eyes, “The expert that Chu Sect sent might be very strong, but with your power, you should be able to deal with them, right?”

In Su Hong’s view, Jian Wushuang could deal with a huge bandit group like Hei Longshan. The expert that Chu Sect sent wouldn’t be any stronger than Hei Longshan, so Jian Wushuang should be able to deal with it easily.

“If it was before Hei Longshan, I definitely could. But now, it’s hard to say,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Why?” Su Hong was confused.

“I told you before that Chu Sect definitely sent experts to hide among Hong Ri Mercenary Group. I didn’t take any action before, so Chu sect didn’t know my background. They’d only treat me as an ordinary Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven. But now that I have exposed my power, Chu Sect will definitely know and they will definitely lay down a plan according to my power. The experts that they send will definitely be extremely strong!” Jian Wushuang said.

Su Hong was stunned and immediately understood.

The experts from Chu Sect either did not take action at all or took action with full confidence. They naturally took Jian Wushuang’s power into consideration.

“What can we do?” Su Hong creased his eyebrows and asked.

“I don’t know, but when I attacked earlier, I did something on purpose. I didn’t show my full power. Plus, the expert that Chu Sect sent to hide among Hong Ri Mercenary Group is most likely a Universe God in the Third Heaven, or even lower. Hence, his understanding is limited and he won’t be able to tell my true ability. I reckon he will only treat me as an expert suspected to have fighting power like one on the Universe God ranking list. Hence, we are still at an advantage,” Jian Wushuang said.

Hearing what Jian Wushuang said, Su Hong was extremely shocked, “What you revealed earlier wasn’t your full power?”

Jian Wushuang glanced at Su Hong but didn’t answer.

In actual fact, he did hold back during the battle earlier.

He didn’t give full play to the Power of Reincarnation and his swordsmanship wasn’t performed to the limit.

He had just passed through his second Inverse Cultivation test and his swordsmanship was in an advancement period. During the years he was preparing in Lineage of Star, he had improved in swordsmanship tremendously with the aid of the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation. The most distinguished achievement would be that he had created the Reincarnation Sword Principle.

The Reincarnation Sword Principle… He had named it so because he had comprehended from the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation.

There’s seven strokes in the Reincarnation Sword Principle. Every stroke was a fierce unique skill. He had only performed two of the fiercer strokes, the Bleeding Technique and Bleed to the end of the world Technique. Among the Reincarnation Sword Principle, he had also created another stronger stroke compared to the two but he had yet to perform it.

“Just wait, the expert that Chu Sect sent will be here in no time.”

Jian Wushuang muttered, then he closed his eyes.

Just as Jian Wushuang had expected, the experts sent by Chu Sect immediately found out about Jian Wushuang’s power after their encounter with Hei Longshan and they made a corresponding plan.

In the boundless void, there were a dozen figures waiting patiently on a mini island that was abandoned.

Very soon, a crimson spaceship stopped before the island in the void. Then, there was a crimson-robed figure that walked out slowly from the crimson spaceship.

“He’s here!”

Looking at the crimson-robed figure, people who were waiting on the island looked excited.
