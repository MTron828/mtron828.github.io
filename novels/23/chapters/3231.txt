Chapter 3232: Risk Your Life

____________

In the void, Jian Wushuang stared at Light King.

“As expected of Light King, who is ranked first on the True Saint List. His fusion power of the two principles is really strong. Not only did he destroy my divine body, but he also destroyed my divine power, causing me to lose one-thirtieth of my divine power!” Jian Wushuang sighed in his heart.

One-thirtieth…do not underestimate this number.

Because he was a perfect chaotic creature, his divine power was more than a hundred times greater than that of an ordinary cultivator.

Like before, Thunder God had defeated his divine body ten times, but he did not use up much of his divine power.

But now, with just one strike, the Light King had used up one-thirtieth of his divine power. With his current realm, one-thirtieth of his divine power was much greater than the divine power of many Invincible Saints.

“No wonder Light King can kill Invincible Saints with one strike,” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

Everyone’s eyes were fixed on Jian Wushuang.

“He’s not dead?”

“No, but his divine power aura seems to be slightly weaker than before.”

“Yes, it’s weakened. Although it’s very weak, as long as his divine power aura is weakened, it means that his divine power is not infinite. As long as he keeps attacking and destroying his divine power, he can be killed completely.”

“Yes!”

The eyes of the experts from the three Saint Realms flashed with a fierce light.

“Let’s attack him together,” Silver Wolf shouted and then directly attacked Jian Wushuang.

After Silver Wolf attacked, Thunder God, Gu Zhenzi, Wan Xuan, and the Invincible Saints and Peak Saints from the Destruction Saint Realm all attacked at the same time.

In addition to Light King and Nine Temples Saintess, many top experts used their destruction divine bodies and divine power to crazily attack Jian Wushuang.

This scene shocked the surrounding spectators.

“What a guy. He just wants to kill a rank six True Saint, but he wants the three Saint Realms, Light King, and Nine Temples Saintess to work together to kill him?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Heavenly Sword Marquis is not very strong, but he is too strong and difficult to kill. The three Saint Realms probably can’t do anything about it.”

“In any case, Heavenly Sword Marquis is able to force the three Saint Realms, Light King, and Nine Temples Saintess to join hands to kill him. Even if he dies, he should be proud.”

The people on the scene discussed animatedly.

Jian Wushuang, who had become the target of many experts, suddenly burst into laughter. There was a hint of madness in his laughter. “Haha, If you want to kill me, then come at me!”

At the same time, Jian Wushuang flipped his palm, and a drop of golden water appeared in his hand.

The faces of the people from the three Saint Realms changed when they saw the golden water drop.

“God’s power?”

God’s power was condensed by the Principles Masters, and it contained part of the power of the will of the Principles Masters.

Some Immortal Saints who were at the peak level could absorb God’s power to guide the power of the will contained in the period, which would increase their strength in a short period of time. However, the power of the will of the Principles Masters…was not so easy to control. If they were not careful, they would be doomed.

Therefore, under normal circumstances, no one would easily consume divine power. However, when it was a matter of life and death, no one would care about it.

For example, Jian Wushuang took out a drop of divine power and immediately swallowed it.

Of course, the reason why he swallowed it was not because it was a matter of life and death. However, his physique was too special. After consuming divine power, he was not worried about the backlash from the power of the will, naturally, there was no need to worry about the divine power.

“Is this the willpower power controlled by the Principles Master? Although it’s just a trace, it still feels very strong!” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, after he swallowed the divine power, he could control the trace of willpower power for a short period of time, and he could clearly feel the strength of the trace of willpower power.

“Get lost!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice shook the sky. He held the sword with one hand and suddenly waved it.

The moment the sword light was waved, the endless power of ice and fire swept out, forming a huge ice and fire domain that suppressed the surrounding people. At the same time, a wave of space-time power was released.

Rumble! The endless space-time pressure was crazily applied to the void in front of him.

Peerless sword technique, Emperor’s blood massacre!

Under the pressure of space and time, it was a Peak Saint from the Destruction Saint Realm. Facing the shocking sword light, this Peak Saint felt an incredible pressure. He could only raise his heavy sword with difficulty, but in the end…bang!

With a low and loud sound, this Peak Saint’s divine body was directly destroyed.

“Be careful!”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis is going to risk his life!”

“Humph, so what if he swallowed the divine power?”

“His battle strength is only at the Peak Saint Realm. After swallowing the divine power, with the help of the power of his will, his battle strength can at most be upgraded to the Invincible Saint Realm. In addition to the suppression of his domain, he is probably only slightly stronger than the Invincible Saint. He can’t even touch the True Saint List. What does his battle strength count for in front of us?” Thunder God looked at Jian Wushuang with disdain.

Light King, Nine Temples Saintess, Silver Wolf, Gu Zhenzi, and Wan Xuan, who were experts on the True Saint List, did not care about Jian Wushuang’s strength at all.

They swarmed forward and used their monstrous skills to easily crush Jian Wushuang, who was fighting desperately.

Then, they continued to attack Jian Wushuang’s divine body in a frenzy.

Under the siege of these people, Jian Wushuang’s divine body was destroyed, again and again, especially the attack of Light King, which contained the two powers of integration. Each attack greatly destroyed Jian Wushuang’s divine power.

Just like that, they surrounded and attacked Jian Wushuang for a long time. During this time, Jian Wushuang’s divine body was destroyed countless times.

The divine power aura on Jian Wushuang’s body finally became extremely weak.

On the battlefield, the people from the three Saint Realms had also stopped fighting. Many experts stood together and stared at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang looked extremely miserable at the moment. His divine power aura had been weakened to the lowest point. If it were to be calculated, his divine power aura was only 10% of his peak.

In terms of divine power, he indeed had less than 10% of his divine power left.

“This kid can’t hold on anymore?” Thunder God stared at Jian Wushuang.

“He has held on for so long under our joint attack. Heavenly Sword Marquis should be proud of himself,” Silver Wolf said..
