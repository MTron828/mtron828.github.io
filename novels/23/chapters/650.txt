Chapter 651: Jian Wushuang Is A Peerless Super Genius!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

As Elder Qiu finished speaking, the noisy Drill Grounds suddenly quietened.

The words echoed in their ears.

His cultivation age was less than 40!

He reached the Skyscraping Realm less than one year ago?

“Elder, Elder Qiu.”

The presiding middle-aged man regained his composure first. He looked at Elder Qiu and said with a smile, “Did you miss something? Did you take 4,000 years as 40 years?”

All eyes gazed at Elder Qiu, hoped he had made a mistake.

Elder Qiu took a deep breath, said, “I didn’t believe it at first, so I checked it twice. The results are the same. I swear to you that the test result is true, Jian Wushuang’s cultivation age is less than 40 years and he reached the Skyscraping Realm less than a year ago.”

Elder Qiu had sworn on his life.

No one could doubt it anymore.

But...

“Cultivation age, less than 40 years; the Skyscraping Realm, less than one year?”

Many of the experts from all sects in the Skyward Pavilion were muttering, vacant-eyed.

Just now, they were guessing how long Jian Wushuang had cultivated. Most of them thought it was over 2,000 years; a few guessed Jian Wushuang had gotten some lucky opportunities and thought it would not be longer than Feng and Huo Ying’s cultivation age but at least 1,000 years.

It was a miracle if Jian Wushuang could have made it within 1,000 years in such a poor cultivation environment.

Feng, strong and having a high-potential, had cultivated for 1,900 years.

However, when they heard the test result, all of them were astounded.

They were stunned!

Totally stunned.

So were the geniuses on the Drill Grounds.

“40 years, less than 40 years?”

Huo Ying growled and went red in the face. A complicated feeling of being astounded, amazed but more ashamed flashed in his eyes.

“Both of us cultivated in the Ancient World. I have spent 3,700 years, he just spent 40 years. How could he be so much stronger than me?”

“I... I...”

“I have lived for 3,700 years in vain!”

At this moment, he hoped to find a hole and to hide in it.

Among all the geniuses here, he had spent the longest time in cultivation. Besides, he came from the same Ancient World with Jian Wushuang.

To cultivate in the same environment, Jian Wushuang spent only 40 years, but he spent 3,700 years.

More importantly, Jian Wushuang was stronger than him.

What have I done with my time?

“How, how could it be possible?”

“Less than 40 years? You must be kidding!”

“Dear God, am I in a dream? A genius coming from the Ancient World who has only cultivated for 40 years is much stronger than us. We are geniuses of the Eternal World.”

“Is it because I know little of what is going on in the Ancient Worlds? Has the cultivation environment of the Ancient Worlds become better than that of the Eternal World?”

People on the Drill Grounds were also in shock.

Crazy!

All of them felt that the world had gone mad.

“His cultivation age is less than 40 years!” Even Gong Chao was gasping with astonishment. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He was known as a real super genius, counted as one of the best of all the geniuses of all Firmament Territory Feasts so far.

Despite his talent and cultivation in the Eternal World, he had spent 120 years and had been in the Skyscraping Realm for 50 years.

Jian Wushuang... cultivated in the Ancient World. He spent much less time than him, and despite this he was nearly as strong as him.

If he was a monster, a super genius, what was Jian Wushuang?

“A peerless super genius!”

“A peerless?super genius who is even more talented than Gong Chao!”

“It took him only 40 years to reach such a level in the Ancient World and he has been in the Skyscraping Realm for less than one year. I guess he came to the Firmament Territory Feast not long after reaching the Skyscraping Realm. He is definitely a much more talented genius than Gong Chao!”

The Drill Grounds were in shock and all stared at Jian Wushuang as if he was a monster.

They imagined he might not be a human. Genius, exceptional genius or monster, these words were not enough to describe him.

They could only think of two words: Heaven-defying!

A Heaven-defying Level genius!

In the Skyward Pavilion, the experts who had come from all sects, although experienced and knowledgeable, were also speechless.

Even Xuan Yi was surprised. He knew that Jian Wushuang was extraordinary for he hadn’t even gained an insight into Jian Wushuang. But he hadn’t expected that his cultivation age was so short.

Xuan Yi calmed down soon and looked at him happily, “Nice, it’s a worthy visit today.”

Three experts who respectively represented the most three powerful sects sat in three rooms in the Skyward Pavilion. They paid little attention to Jian Wushuang as he came from the Ancient World, even though Jian Wushuang had performed well.

They had promised to give up these Ancient Worlds’ geniuses to Xuan Yi at the very beginning.

But now... the three of them felt deep remorse.

Very deep.

They knew that Jian Wushuang was more talented than Gong Chao.

They had fought crazily for Gong Chao. How could they give up a Heaven-defying genius who was better than Gong Chao to Xuan Yi?

“How stupid I am. Xuan Yi is a visionary. If these young men were ordinary, how could Xuan Yi pick them?” The arrogant middle-aged man from the Immortal Dynasty was so regretful that he wanted to slap himself.
