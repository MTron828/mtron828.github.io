Chapter 516: Second-grade Divine General

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

He brandished his sword.

A poignant sword stroke emerged.

Beautiful and enchanting!

It was the third move of Heart-killing Sword Technique, Enchant!

The sword light even enthralled Emperor Fengxiao and the red-robed woman who were outside the Gladiator Arena.

“That move...” A hint of surprise flashed in Emperor Fengxiao’s eyes.

It was a poignant sword move, intoxicating, powerful and occult.

Seeing this, Emperor Fengxiao was stunned, feeling like he had been struck by an electric shock.

He was good at Sword Principle and believed that few in the Monster Continent could be his rivals.

But the sword move Jian Wushuang unleashed just now had touched him.

Yes, it touched him.

Emperor Fengxiao closed his eyes and replayed the move in his mind. A sword move which he hadn’t understood for years suddenly became clear.

All of a sudden.

“That’s it!”

“I have been walking on the wrong path.”

Emperor Fengxiao murmured, then opened his surprised eyes.

“He mastered such a unique Sword Skill.” Emperor Fengxiao looked at Jian Wushuang.

He didn’t know that Heart-killing Sword Technique was created by Sword Ancestor, which was also Sword Ancestor’s best Sword Skill. Though he was strong in Sword Principle, he was much weaker compared with Sword Ancestor. Therefore, it was normal that Sword Ancestor’s best Sword Skill would touch him.

“I should thank him.” Emperor Fengxiao took an earnest look at Jian Wushuang.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang had defeated the Demonic Ape Puppet Fighter with Realm suppression and the third move of Heart-killing Sword Technique.

The Fourth Level, passed!

“He should be able to pass it!”

The red-robed woman opened her eyes wide with a shocked face.

She didn’t study Sword Principle and had no idea how special the move was. What shocked her was that Jian Wushuang had passed the Fourth Level.

It should be known that those who passed the Fourth Level were at the peak even among Second-grade Divine Generals.

Top Second-grade Divine Generals were ranked only second to the Divine Emperor.

In the Gladiator Arena, the Demonic Beast Puppet Fighter of the Fifth Level appeared.

When Jian Wushuang fought with the Demonic Beast Puppet Fighter, he found that it was stronger by at least two levels than the Demonic Ape Puppet Fighter, whether in speed or in power.

“The Demonic Beast Puppet Fighter of the Fifth Level is much stronger. I may not be able to defeat it even using Sword Soul and trying my best.”?Jian Wushuang thought.

“To pass the Fourth Level is enough. There is no need to pass more.”

Having decided, he retreated to the perimeter of the Gladiator Arena, looked up at the stands out of the Restriction, back to where he entered and walked out of the Gladiator Arena.

He didn’t plan to use all his trump cards here. But the strength he had shown was shocking enough.

“Red Butterfly.”

In the stand, Emperor Fengxiao took a glance at the red-robed woman behind him.

“Divine Emperor.” The red-robed woman said respectfully.

“Take this to him.” Emperor Fengxiao gave the red-robed woman a Jade Slip.

Taking it, the red-robed woman was confused. But after she recognized what it was, she was in great shock.

“Divine Emperor, this, this is...” The red-robed woman’s voice was trembling. She knew the value of the Jade Slip.

It was a Jade Slip that lots of Divine Generals were eager to own. And it was also important for Emperor Fengxiao himself.

How could Emperor Fengxiao give this as a present to Jian Wushuang?

“Just do as you are told.” Emperor Fengxiao said.

“Yes.” Dan Jiu took a deep breath and nodded heavily. Then she left.

In the stand sat Emperor Fengxiao with the corners of his mouth curled up.

“After mastering that sword movement, my strength has improved to a new level. The Jade Slip was nothing compared with what I received because of him.” Emperor Fengxiao murmured, “The Jade Slip is useful to Jian Wushuang. It can be my gift to thank him.”

“Hehe, the journey has not been made in vain.”

Emperor Fengxiao stood up and stretched. After a quick move, he had disappeared from the stand.

...

In the open space, all the experts participating in the assessment gathered and waited.

When Jian Wushuang appeared in the open space, those experts looked towards him.

“Why did he take such a long time?”

Their eyes were full of curiosity.

They had all fought with the Demonic Beasts’ Puppet Fighters in the Gladiator Arena. Some took a while and some were brief. But Jian Wushuang took the longest time, even longer than Jin Ling’s.

A moment later, the red-robed woman arrived at the open space.

“Now, I will announce the results.”

The red-robed woman took out a list and started to read.

“The first one, He Cang, pass, First-grade Divine General!”

“The second one, Luo Yi, pass, First-grade Divine General!”

“The third one... First-grade Divine General!”

“The fourth one... fail.”

The red-robed woman read everyone’s name.

More than 30 experts participated in the test. Almost all of them had reached Seven-cloud Realm, so most of them would pass it. Only one or two failed.

“Jin Ling, pass, Second-grade Divine General!” The red-robed woman said.

All people present looked towards the red-haired man, Jin Ling, but didn’t feel surprised.

Because it was only he that reached Eight-cloud Realm and he should be a Second-grade Divine General.

Jin Ling himself also thought he deserved it.

“The next one...” continued the red-robed woman.

Finally, the red-robed woman read the last one’s name, Jian Wushuang.

“The last one, Jian Wushuang, pass, Second-grade Divine General!” The red-robed woman looked at Jian Wushuang after reading.

All experts present looked towards Jian Wushuang.

It was normal that Jin Ling became a Second-grade Divine General, because he was at Eight-cloud Realm. But Jian Wushuang...
