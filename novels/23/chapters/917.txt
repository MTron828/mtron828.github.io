Chapter 918: I Have Three Wedding Gifts Too

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Magic Cloud Valley had become a mysterious relic in the Eternal World since the unprecedented war. No one had been able to enter it.” Xia Mang’s words resounded through the Drill Ground.

One expert on the stand nodded solemnly and said, “The Magic Cloud Valley relic is among the top ten relics in the Eternal World. It’s said that the tokens of the Four Great Elders of the Magic Cloud Valley are needed to enter it. Did you just…”

“That’s right.” Xia Mang said proudly, “the last gift I have prepared is the tokens of the Four Great Elders. With them, one can go to the Magic Cloud Valley relic and obtain all the treasures in it.”

“Wow!”

All the top experts on the stand were greatly surprised.

The third gift was so valuable!

Not only was it a complete relic, it was one of the Magic Cloud Valley, the overlord of the Eternal World at that time.

Although the Magic Cloud Valley was not as powerful as the Xia Clan, it was pretty close. The relic of such a powerful clan was very precious!

That was a huge treasure.

The Xia Clan had presented it to Emperor Leng as a wedding gift?

“So generous!” Alchemy Master praised, “I’ve heard about the Magic Cloud Valley before. There were only a few people who survived the war. Various magic weapons and treasures were left in the relic. It’s extremely valuable.”

“Haha, generous, so generous. That’s the Xia Clan.” Elder Deadwood laughed but inwardly, he felt sad.

Among the previous 15 geniuses, the most valuable gift that had been presented was the Nine-colored Cloud Fruit from his disciple. Xia Mang’s third gift was such an incredible treasure that it dwarfed the 10 Nine-colored Cloud Fruits.

Elder Deadwood realised that in terms of wedding gifts, Xia Mang had overtaken his disciple.

Everyone on the stand was astonished.

“Xia Yu, you’re paying a high price to win the princess’s hand in marriage. If Xia Clan had kept the Magic Cloud Valley relic, your overall strength would have increased 10 to 20 percent. Would you really rather present it as a wedding gift?” Dong Yan Clan’s Master’s tone was sarcastic as he looked at Xia Yu.

“It’s just the Magic Cloud Valley relic, it’s not that important. Intermarriage with the Imperial House is worth it regardless of what it costs.” On the surface, Xia Yu appeared nonchalant about the loss of the treasure but inwardly, he felt different.

Nobody knew how long it had taken to obtain the tokens. It had taken nearly a million years to collect all four tokens and now they were losing them at the same time. It was understandable that Xia Yu felt some sorrow at their loss.

However, the benefits of an intermarriage with the Imperial House outweighed those of the Magic Cloud Valley relic.

“Distinguished Emperor Leng, are you satisfied with the three wedding gifts we present?” Xia Yu asked.

“Pretty good. It seems that the Xia Clan has proved their good faith.” The poker-faced Emperor Leng finally smiled.

Indeed, the wedding gifts from the Xia Clan were very outstanding, especially the third one. The benefits of the Magic Cloud Valley were significant, even for the Imperial House of the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land.

“Haha, it seems that the result of the wedding gifts competition is obvious.” Xia Yu laughed.

“Elder Xia Yu, is it too soon to make a judgment?” Someone snorted.

Xia Yu looked over and realised that Xue Lingtian had spoken. He answered coldly, “Master Blood Saber, do you think there is any wedding gift comparable to ours? Or are you saying that your junior brother is going to present a more precious and scarce treasure?”

“Master Blood Saber, are you daydreaming?”

Xia Yu sneered impolitely. The other experts shared the same sentiments but remained silent.

“Hmm, let’s wait and see. I don’t need to make any judgment. Everyone can tell whose wedding gift is better.” Xue Lingtian snorted.

Xia Yu frowned and looked towards the Drill Ground.

Xia Mang stood back and looked at Jian Wushuang.

He was surprised to see that Jian Wushuang had remained composed even though everyone else had been shocked by his gifts.

Jian Wushuang stepped forward.

Everyone in the Drill Ground stared at Jian Wushuang with expectant faces.

They remembered the confrontation between Jian Wushuang and Xia Mang before the Selection Ceremony. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Xia Mang had presented three impressive wedding gifts. What would Jian Wushuang present?

“Although it’s impossible to match Xia Mang’s, it would be very embarrassing if the gifts are even worse that others’,” Someone joked.

In the middle of the Drill Ground, Jian Wushuang walked a few steps forward and stopped. He looked up at Emperor Leng and the other experts and bowed. “Distinguished Emperor Leng, I am inferior Jian Wushuang. What a coincidence. I have brought hree wedding gifts too.”

Everyone was shocked.

What a coincidence!

Jian Wushuang had also prepared three wedding gifts?

Xia Mang had just presented three gifts.

If there were no history of bad blood between the two, it might just be a coincidence.

However, given their previous confrontation, it was obvious that Jian Wushuang had done this intentionally.

“Hmm, also three gifts?”

Xia Mang was shocked for a moment. He sneered. “Well. Let’s see if a bumpkin from an ordinary sect of the realm can produce anything to compete with my Youth-retaining Elixir, Blood Emperor Puppet and Magic Cloud Valley relic!”
