Amongst the contemporaries, perhaps only Hu Qing had such an opportunity.

Alternatively, there was the extraordinary talent in the Transformation Dao, Broly. His progress was even more astonishing. There were rumors about him at Yuanyang Lake. A native Inheritor appeared on the Grave God Mountain, and upon arriving, he broke through to the tier 6 Emperor.

Moreover, there were some interesting incidents during his breakthrough.

Broly went to the Grave God Mountain not as eager for inheritance as other native powerhouses but with the intention of descending the mountain to find his missing father.

Zhen Ling set up a formation. If a tier 6 Emperor couldn't descend the mountain.

Broly, being a ruthless individual, directly accelerated the flow of time to 10,000 times its normal speed, breaking through in just 10,000 years, while only ten years passed in the outside world.

How could this not be shocking?!

When Jian Wushuang first heard about it, he was even more astonished. Because it was he who ordered the members of the Kui Organization to kill Bukun. At that time, Bukun was just a nobody, and he didn't pay any attention to him.

Now, unexpectedly, trouble had been stirred up.

Fortunately, Zhen Ling explained the situation, telling Broly that his father had died at the hands of the Kui Organization. This was not a lie.

Indeed, he was killed by a tier 5 Emperor of the Kui Organization.

Currently, Broly was filled with rage, slaughtering in the Earth Realm, issuing wanted orders for the powerhouses of the Kui Organization in all directions.

Anyone associated with the Kui Organization was killed by him.

Zhen Ling also promised him that as long as he killed all the members of the Kui Organization in the Earth Realm, his father would be resurrected.

To resurrect a tier 5 Emperor with a half-formed Origin Source, especially a native powerhouse of the Qishen Temple, was like finding a needle in a haystack for Zhen Ling.

The whole situation was nothing, it was like treating Broly as a mere killing machine.

Jian Wushuang shook his head, choosing not to dwell on such matters. Now, Dragon God has been captured and thrown into the Second Prison, similar to Shan Jun was once banished.

The environment there could make even supreme-peak experts fall. There was no way out in this lifetime. Well, Dragon God offended a Divine General of Qishen Temple, so it was truly unavoidable.

Jian Wushuang wanted to rescue Shan Jun, but currently, there was no clue.

It was a good opportunity to ask Lord Yunzhong, who was a Divine General.

"Junior Jian Wushuang pays respects to Senior Yun Zhong!" Jian Wushuang showed great respect.

Last time, he offended the other party badly. Without showing due respect, given the ruthless character of the Divine General, there would be no leniency.

Currently, he was still within the other party's territory.

Dragon God, a powerful being, was suppressed effortlessly, akin to dealing with a small chicken.

Dongsheng and Wanyan had long been waiting in a respectful posture for Lord Yun Zhong to speak.

It was their first time encountering such high-level experts.

In the Original Universe, it was troublesome to meet a tier 6 Emperor, let alone supreme-peak experts.

Only after coming to Qishen Temple did they encounter several supreme-peak experts. This was also the first time witnessing the clash between supreme-peak experts.

The powerful aura directly suppressed the two of them.

When Zhen Ling issued the challenge, stating that as long as they could reach Grave God Mountain with their own abilities, they would be nurtured into supreme-peak, it didn't have much impact on them at that time. They didn't understand much about supreme-peak.

But now, seeing the supreme-peak in action, they were determined to exert 100 or even 1,000 times more effort after going out, aiming to become a tier 6 Emperor and head to the Grave God Mountain as soon as possible.

"Tsk tsk, little ones, this place is now all yours. How many treasures you can obtain depends on your luck!" Lord Yun Zhong resumed his amiable demeanor, resembling a kind old man.

However, Jian Wushuang couldn't believe it.

This was the Dao Arena where the Dark King transcended. It must be heavily guarded, and the treasures were stored in the treasure vault. Opening the vault required a key, but how were they going to get one?

This old man was indeed holding a grudge against him for destroying the mortal world back then.

Originally, Jian Wushuang wanted to inquire about the Second Prison, but now it seemed that the other party wouldn't truly tell him. They might even deceive him.

Jian Wushuang didn't bother pursuing it and could only respectfully see the old man off.

Before leaving, Lord Yun Zhong looked at Jian Wushuang and said, "You are Jian Wushuang, right? I've heard about you. Your future is promising. Work hard. The treasures in this mustard seed were left by Dragon God. The three of you can split them!"

Saying this, he tossed the mustard seed to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was delighted at first, but then his face froze.

Before Lord Yun Zhong left, he quickly handed the mustard seed to Emperor Dongsheng, simultaneously praying in his heart, 'Please trust me!'

In the mustard seed given by Lord Yun Zhong, there were nothing but some worthless items. If he had accepted the mustard seed, things would have been unclear.

Emperor Dongsheng was somewhat surprised, thinking that Jian Wushuang was being too polite. Since Lord Yun Zhong handed it to Jian Wushuang, it should be for him to share with the rest.

He had originally planned to be polite and hope that Jian Wushuang wouldn't be too greedy, at least giving them a share. UpdùíÇted chapters ùíên nùíêvelbin(.)com

After all, the fate of the mustard seed in whose hands it ended up was a matter of uncertainty. With Lord Yun Zhong departing, the truth might remain elusive, and dividing the spoils would be an open-ended affair.

Jian Wushuang took the initiative to hand over the mustard seed to Dongsheng, a decision that Wanyan understood well.

Jian Wushuang's face darkened as he stood in place, not uttering a word. Only after Lord Yun Zhong's departure did he speak, "Stop staring; there's nothing in here. Do you really think that old man would be so benevolent?"

He wasn't afraid that Lord Yun Zhong would be secretly monitoring him‚Äîindeed, he might be. Lord Yun Zhong probably wanted to witness Jian Wushuang being pranked. However, Jian Wushuang wasn't falling for that.

Especially when he heard Jian Wushuang directly curse at him, Lord Yun Zhong, who was lurking in the shadows, blinked and left.

If he didn't scheme against Jian Wushuang this time, there would be a next time. As long as Jian Wushuang didn't surpass him, there would be plenty of opportunities for calculations and schemes.

Inside the treasure hall, Dongsheng held the mustard seed, at a loss for what to do. Stammering, he said, "Is this, isn't this a joke? Wushuang, you must vouch for me!"

Finishing his words, he handed the mustard seed to Wanyan.

Wanyan's Thought power probed into it, and his expression instantly froze. He glanced at Dongsheng and then at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang spoke, "Brother Wanyan, if you don't believe it, I can let you search my mustard seed."

"No, no, that's not what I mean. I just find it puzzling why a peak expert like you would play tricks on us," Wanyan hurriedly waved his hands.

Even harboring doubts in his heart, he dared not search Jian Wushuang's belongings!

Jian Wushuang was a prominent figure among the Inheritors. Although he had not visited the Grave God Mountain, his name resounded loudly on the mountain.

Especially after the journey to the Western Sea, he displayed a combat power not inferior to that of a tier 5 Emperor, shocking many.

Wanyan and Dongsheng were both Emperors who had achieved ordinary Origin Source levels.

However, Jian Wushuang represented the Ultimate Dao, a future existence much stronger than them.

How could one afford to offend him?

"There's nothing impossible. These veteran powerhouses have just been resurrected after countless eons of silence. Who knows if there might be some strange quirks!" Jian Wushuang sighed.

He hadn't expected the other party to hold such a grudge. After their group got a beating from Dragon God, one would think that would be the end of it... But the old man even schemed against him before leaving.

Moreover, leaving them in the early stages of the Dark King's treasure hunt‚Äîwasn't that a joke?
