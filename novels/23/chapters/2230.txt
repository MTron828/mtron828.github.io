Chapter 2231

Black Water Dragon

Emperor Bai had reached the second stage of the seventh step back during the First Era.

Even when the First Era collapsed, he had not been able to reach the ultimate stage of the seventh step and spent quite some time in the Second Era before he broke through.

He had spent an entire era, countless treasures, to finally reach the base requirements for his breakthrough.

But Jian Wushuang?

It was not long since he reached the second stage of his Inverse Cultivation’s seventh step.

But now he had reached the ultimate stage.

“Jian Wushuang, your speed of progress is really enviable,” Emperor Bai exclaimed.

“Haha, I was just lucky,” Jian Wushuang casually laughed it off.

Emperor Bai frowned, “You must have received some sort of amazing opportunity,” To him, without such an opportunity, it was impossible for Jian Wushuang to reach such a breakthrough.

And that was indeed the case.

Emperor Bai knew it, but he did not intend to probe more.

“Previously you said you encountered an Ancient Era expert, tell me what happened?” Emperor Bai asked.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate and described his experience in the Real Martial Arts Divine Church.

“Three, three Ancient Era experts?” Emperor Bai’s eyes narrowed. “What happened to the three of them?”

“I killed two of them, the other one now my Sword Servant via Soul Control,” Jian Wushuang did not conceal anything.

Emperor Bai was shocked, but soon he was relieved.

Before reaching the ultimate stage, Jian Wushuang’s fighting power was already very aggressive... Emperor Bai knew how much one’s fighting power would increase by the moment he stepped into the ultimate stage. Jian Wushuang now definitely possessed Ancient Era expert-slaying abilities.

“Emperor Bai, you mentioned a ‘too’ previously? What’s happening? There are others that encountered Ancient Era experts?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yep,” Emperor Bai nodded. “Three hundred years ago, at the Colored Glaze Sanctuary, Colored Glaze herself seemed to have encountered an Ancient Era expert.”

“Seemed?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“I say ‘seemed’ because we are not sure. Colored Glaze wanted to engage him, but the opponent simply glanced at her, and she lost the courage to make her move. According to her, the opponent’s aura was extremely terrifying, and she would have died without a struggle if she had engaged him,” Emperor Bai said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He knew about Great Emperor Colored Glaze – she was an elite First Stage Great Emperor.

If she had encountered a Second Stage Great Emperor, she would have been so scared as to lose courage.

If the opponent could make her feel that way, it meant that the opponent was definitely a decent Third Stage Great Emperor, possibly pinnacle, and definitely not weaker than Jian Er’s two elder brothers.

“I asked Colored Glaze personally. She said the opponent’s aura felt very similar to mine,” Emperor Bai said.

“Then it has to be an Ancient Era expert,” Jian Wushuang said.

The top two experts of the Eternal Chaotic World were Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai.

There was no other Third Stage Great Emperor besides the two of them.

The restrictions on the Second Era were too powerful, making it hard to produce Third Stage Great Emperors.

Under those circumstances, there was only one logical explanation for an expert’s fighting powers to be similar to Emperor Bai’s – the opponent was from the Ancient Era.

“He should be an Ancient Era expert, but we cannot be sure. Luckily, the opponent did not engage or stir up any mess within the Colored Glaze Sanctuary,” Emperor Bai said.

Jian Wushuang nodded.

As long as terrifying Ancient Era experts did not stir up any trouble within the Eternal Chaotic World, the Sanctuary Alliance would not provoke them.

Like Emperor Thirteen, in the beginning, no one had known what he wanted to do nor how powerful he was. As long as he did not provoke the Sanctuary Alliance, they did not care. Even if Emperor Thirteen were to start a slaughter within the Eternal Chaotic World, as long as it was not out of hand, the Sanctuary Alliance would not care.

“Besides the suspected Ancient Era expert Colored Glaze saw, there was another incident thirty years ago at the Red Dragon Sanctuary,” Emperor Bai said.

“What was it?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It was a city. A lot of cultivators disappeared within the city in a short period of time, leaving an aura of coldness that covered the city in a layer of ice,” Emperor Bai said. “This stirred some waves in the Red Dragon Sanctuary then, but Red Dragon himself was not particularly bothered by it. But afterwards, two other cities and a sect suffered the same treatment.”

“Red Dragon started treating it seriously, and after some research, they realised it was the work of a black water dragon.”

“Black Water Dragon?” Jian Wushuang’s gaze moved, but something about it felt familiar.

“Afterwards, five years ago, when the Black Water Dragon made its move on another city again, Red Dragon was able to reach there in time but in the end... Red Dragon almost got himself killed by the Black Water Dragon,” Emperor Bai said.

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

Red Dragon King had been ranked second in the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list in the past. Though the list needed some refreshing, he still possessed Second Stage Great Emperor powers.

But Red Dragon King was almost killed?

How powerful was that Black Water Dragon?

“Emperor Bai, did Red Dragon King have any projected image of the Black Water Dragon?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, Red Dragon recorded it himself,” Emperor Bai said, and took out a token.

With a wave, a large projected image appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed as he watched the projected image.
