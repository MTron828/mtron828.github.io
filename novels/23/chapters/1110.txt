Chapter 1111: Acquaintances

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang flew alone at a comfortable pace, passing the never-ending lofty mountains below.

He was using the Scarlet Eye Secret Skill as it gave him a broader view.

“To think there’s such a peculiar elixir in the world.” He appeared bewildered as he contemplated the existence of Life Elixirs.

“Humph! What’s so surprising about them?” Gu King asked coldly. “You’re so short-sighted. No one in the Eternal Chaotic World would even blink because there are so many more powerful ones there.”

“Yes, but I’m now in the Green Fire World. Life Elixirs will be a great help to Green Fire Palace.” Jian Wushuang retorted.

After all, one Life Elixir could create a Celestial Master.

If they found hundreds of Life Elixirs here, Green Fire Palace would welcome hundreds of new Celestial Masters. It would greatly enhance the might of the palace.

“Oh right. Life Elixirs could help people to integrate different Daos and create Dharma Bodies. Can I use it when I’m ready to become a Celestial Master in the future?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“You? It’s impossible.” Gu King laughed.

“Why?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“It’s true that Life Elixirs can help one become a Celestial Master but one’s Dao will determine the chances of success in breaking through. If your three Dao are merely in the General Level, then I can say with certainty that the elixir can help you become a Celestial Master.”

“However, if one of two of your Daos are in the Universe Level, your chances drop to 80 or 90 percent. If they’re in the Creation Level, your chances are less than 50 percent!”

“You should at least develop the Strongest Sword Principle if you want to be a Celestial Master and form your Dharma Body. Life Elixirs have little effect on you, so it’s impossible for you to become a Celestial Master with just the elixir,” Gu King added.

“I see.” Jian Wushuang smiled wryly.

He was unaware that Life Elixirs had a bearing on the level of Dao he had developed.

“Either way, I should try my best to get more Life Elixirs,” Jian Wushuang said, clenching his hands.

He continued to fly above the mountains to search for the elixirs.

Five days had passed since.

“Hm? This smell…”

Jan Wushuang stopped midair when he smelled the unmistakable fragrance of elixir. It originated from the spot beside him. The smell was unique as it was the smell of blood.

“Over there.” Jian Wushuang looked in a particular direction and rushed over at once.

After a while, he saw two scarlet elixirs floating in the Void.

“Two elixirs? Looks like I’m in luck.” Jian Wushuang was so excited that he rushed to grab the two scarlet elixirs.

However, when he looked at the elixirs in his hands, a strange feeling hit him.

“These are Life Elixirs? Such a strong smell of blood!” Jian Wushuang commented in bewilderment.

“Life Elixirs are made out of warriors’ Essence Blood. Of course, they’ll emanate the aura of Essence Blood,” Gu King explained.

“I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

The strong aura of the two elixirs also attracted an elegant man dressed in a golden armor. The man also rushed to the source of the aura but he was much slower than Jian Wushuang.

He arrived just in time to see Jian Wushuang putting the two Life Elixirs away.

“Two Life Elixirs?”

“Damn it! Someone got to them earlier and to make things worse, it’s a Green Fire Palace expert!”

His face darkened and his expression twisted into one of anger.

Soon, he got a clear look at Jian Wushuang.

“It’s him!”?He stopped in midair with a frown.

Jian Wushuang, who had just placed the Life Elixirs into his Interspatial Ring, also noticed the man’s presence. He was surprised when he looked up and saw who it was.

It was the Jin Kingdom expert that he met under the stone pillar with the word “Kill” on it earlier, as well as the first Jin Kingdom expert that he met since entering the battlefield.

The man possessed the strength of an advanced Celestial Master and was strong even among his same-level peers. He was, at least, much stronger than the purple-haired, burly man whom he defeated three days ago.

“The Life Elixirs fell into the youngster’s hands.”?The man stared at Jian Wushuang, contemplating. He then shook his head.

In their previous battle, he was defeated and even lost an arm. Jian Wushuang was evidently as strong as he was. Now that he was alone, it seemed unlikely that he would be able to steal those Life Elixirs from Jian Wushuang.

The man turned around to leave after a brief contemplation.

Just as he was about to leave…

“Haha! Where are you going, all anxious like that?”

Jian Wushuang’s cheerful laughter reverberated in the air as he flew toward the man.

The man stopped in his tracks and turned around to glare at Jian Wushuang. “I know I can’t kill you and have no way of taking the Life Elixirs from you, so I’m leaving. What else do you want me to do?” he shouted.

“What else do I want you to do?” Jian Wushuang sneered. “The grudge between Green Fire Palace and the Jin Kingdom dictates both sides never stop until the other is exterminated! Since I’ve stumbled across you now, how can I allow you to leave with ease? Take this!”

Jian Wushuang charged at the man like he was a Flowing Light.

A sword essence came out in an instant. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“You madman!”

There was raging fury in the man’s eyes. He had chosen to leave, knowing that he could neither defeat Jian Wushuang or steal Jian Wushuang’s Life Elixirs.

However, he never expected that Jian Wushuang would provoke and fight him.

Where did the kid get the courage?

“I didn’t want to waste any energy battling you the last time, but did you think that I was afraid of you?” the man asked coldly. Golden light flared from within him as four arms materialized, all equipped with a massive golden hammer.

He swung his hammers at Jian Wushuang with a lighting-speed motion.

In just several decades, Jian Wushuang once again fought a fierce battle with the golden-armored man!
