The experts, who had accepted the task, came back one after another. Dongfang Yu, followed by the brown-haired man, was the last to arrive, but his appearance looked a little unnatural.

“It’s good that there are still 15 people alive in the end,” Mr. Huo said indifferently with a casual glance.

However, everyone else looked awestruck.

“More than 30 people at the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm accepted this mission, but only 15 people survived in the end. In other words, more than half of the people died during the mission. Some were killed by disciples from the Tianhuan Sect, while the ones killed by fellow examinees is probably not only a few.” Jian Wushuang thought secretly.

Take Dongfang Yu for example. He was followed by five martial masters in the beginning, but now there was only the brown-haired man, who was seriously injured. So it was very clear to Jian Wushuang how the other four people had died.

“Everyone who has an Interspatial Ring should give it to me,” said Mr. Huo.

Among the 15 people who survived, ten stepped forward to hand in their rings. At which point, Mr. Huo took out a list and recorded their names.

After recording their names, Mr. Huo waved his hand and threw them gold rings. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“These are your Gold-Dragon Rings. The claw marks represent your rank in the Gold-Dragon Guard. One claw mark stands for One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard while two stands for Two-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard. From this day forth, you are members of the Gold-Dragon Guard,” Mr. Huo said loudly.

After receiving the rings, Jian Wushuang and the other nine, who had completed the task, immediately used their blood to bind the rings.

“Is this an Interspatial ring?” Jian Wushuang became aware of the space contained in the Interspatial ring when he inspected it with his mind. Then he laughed and said, “This Interspatial ring will make it more convenient to carry things.”

“You should be exhausted after completing the task, so you can take a break before returning to Qingdong City.” After saying this, Mr. Huo glanced at Jian Wushuang and said: “Little guy, come with me.”

Jian Wushuang felt surprised as he followed Mr. Huo to the side.

“Little guy, you hid so well. I did not notice the slightest flaw when you were defeated by Dongfang Yu within three rounds three days ago.” Mr. Huo glanced at Jian Wushuang with a smile.

Jian Wushuang only smiled awkwardly.

“If I’m not mistaken, you should have some grievances with the Blood Feather Tower, right?” Mr. Huo asked suddenly.

Jian Wushuang’s complexion changed immediately.

“It seems that I guessed right.” It was clear to Mr. Huo when he saw the change in Jian Wushuang’s expression. “Every action has a reason. There must have been a reason for you to prefer giving up your face and allowing Dongfang Yu to defeat you within three rounds at the Gold-Dragon Subsidiary Palace. Yet, during this mission, you killed all the people from Blood Feather Tower. So, I guessed that you must have a huge feud with Blood Feather Tower.”

Hearing that, Jian Wushuang could only shrug his shoulders, replying in a deep voice, “I do, in fact, have a grudge with Blood Feather Tower. Unless I die, I will never stop seeking revenge.”

“Unless you die?” Mr. Huo frowned.

“Blood Feather Tower is the number one assassin organization in the Tianzong Dynasty. Their actions are very cruel and extreme. In the Tianzong Dynasty, there are many people who have grudges with the Blood Feather Tower, deathless endlessly, but Tiannan Province is not the main province where Blood Feather Tower operates. Their insidious hidden strength cannot be underestimated. If you are spotted by them, you will be in a big trouble,” Mr. Huo said and smiled.

“But don’t worry, the rehabilitation capacity of our Golden-dragon Palace is always good and in general, it’s not possible to let out the course of this mission. Therefore, although you have killed several martial experts of Blood Feather Tower, you don’t need to worry about being spotted by the people of Blood Feather Tower.”

“I know,” Jian Wushuang said and nodded.

But don’t worry, our Gold-dragon Palace is always good at dealing with the aftermath. In general, it’s impossible for the information of this mission to be leaked. Therefore, although you have killed several experts from Blood Feather Tower, you won’t have to worry about being targeted by Blood Feather Tower.”

“Little guy, you should have heard of Dragon Palace?” Mr. Huo asked suddenly.

“Of course I have.” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

“It will be much simpler if you already know about the Dragon Palace. Are you interested in cultivating in the Dragon Palace?” ask Mr. Huo while smiling mysteriously.

“Go to the Dragon Palace to cultivate? ” Jian Wushuang asked while surprised.

Dragon Palace was a Holy Place full of exceptional geniuses!

Jian Wushuang has always wanted to join a group like Dragon Palace, a place which was full of geniuses and monsters.

“Can I join Dragon Palace? ” Jian Wushuang asked immediately.

“I’m uncertain whether you can actually join Dragon Palace to cultivate. But, based on your performance in the Tianhuan Sect, you can easily kill someone at the peak of Initial Gold Core Realm in just two moves while you are only in Spiritual Sea Realm. This is incredible and you can absolutely be called a monster, so you have a very good chance of entering Dragon Palace.”

“Therefore, if you are willing to wait, I will ask for a Gold-Dragon Ambassador to come and verify your actual strength once we return to Qingdong City. As long as you can gain the recognition and recommendation of the Gold-Dragon Ambassador, you will have a chance cultivate at Dragon Palace.”

Mr. Huo paused and glanced at Jian Wushuang afterwards, ” so I’ll ask you now, do you want to go to Dragon Palace for cultivation?”

“Yes, of course I do,” Jian Wushuang nodded and said immediately, without any hesitation.

Dragon Palace was a Holy Place for cultivation. Numerous talents in the Tianzong Dynasty were eager to join and cultivate, and Jian Wushuang was no exception.

After all, a warrior who cultivated blindly by himself could become an expert, but compared with warriors who had a lot of resources and were instructed by experts, he would still be inferior.

Jian Wushuang possessed remarkable ability in swordmanship because he had followed his father in practicing swordsmanship since he was a child. Therefore, he knew very well that there was a large difference between having a teacher and learning on his own.

“Haha, I will immediately arrange for you as you wish after returning to Qingdong City. In addition, it doesn’t matter if you eventually didn’t enter into Dragon Palace, but once you enter into Dragon Palace, you needn’t care about Blood Feather Tower. Because Dragon Palace will protect its talented disciples strictly, even Blood Feather Tower is hard to find chance to kill you, and even if there is a chance, they dare not to kill the disciples of Dragon Palace.” Mr. Huo said with a smile.

After hearing these words, Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up again.

What was he most worried about? It was not having the chance to grow up and become stronger, the chance that Blood Feather Tower did not want to give him. If he joined the Dragon Palace, he could grow up slowly over the next few years under the protection of the Dragon Palace. He would eve have a chance to grow strong enough to make the Blood Feather Tower treat him seriously, maybe even fear him.
