Chapter 2667: Someone Familiar

Just like the black-clothed girl, those three people were also from the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion. They were the black-clothed girl’s three senior brothers who were much stronger than the black-clothed girl in terms of cultivation realms and overall strength.

Among the black-clothed girl’s three senior brothers, two Peak Earth Ultimate Gods had already taken action against the Sacred Palace’s Peak Earth Ultimate Gods. The Sacred Palace disciples had no room for struggle and were not a match to the both of them.

They were frustrated and angry from their incapability, but could only hold back their emotions.

They were secretly sighing in their hearts—they were also geniuses from the Sacred Palace but the geniuses recruited by Dragon Phoenix Pavilion from all over the Nine Realms of Golden Crows were much stronger. Dragon Phoenix Pavilion’s talented disciples were not only better in terms of their overall strength but also in other aspects.

“What are the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciples doing here at Sacred Palace? Are they here just to show off their talents and strength?”

“Who knows? We aren’t the one who invited them to come anyway.”

“I heard that the people from Dragon Phoenix Pavilion had taken the initiative to visit Sacred Palace and paid a price to gather Sacred Palace disciples at the Space-time Palace. The Palace Keeper must have agreed to us disciples learning from each other as he wanted the talented disciples from Dragon Phoenix Pavilion to show us a thing or two so we know how far behind we are and quit being arrogant.”

“Did the Palace Keeper do that?”

Many of the Sacred Palace disciples were secretly passing comments as they felt the bitterness in their hearts.

It was true that those Sacred Palace disciples were arrogant as they had always thought of themselves as geniuses. However, they were nobodies in the face of those Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciples. The failure would probably teach them a lesson not to be complacent in the future.

The black-clothed girl made her way to her three Senior Brothers.

“They are too weak, so there’s no point in fighting against them,” said the black-clothed girl in disappointment.

“Haha, I’ve told you not to have too high hopes.” A young man with red hair smiled. “If the Crimson Stone Fort had not fallen to their current state, the potential of their geniuses could be extremely high. Even though they might not be as good as us, the gap should not be so ridiculously wide. However...the level of Sacred Palace concentration camp’s geniuses are no longer on par with us.”

“Indeed, I heard some elders in the attic mentioned that Sacred Palace is no longer what it used to be after the fall of Crimson Stone Saint. It’ll probably take a lot of luck and a long time for them to cultivate a truly presentable genius as they haven’t had any in the last one thousand years,” said another handsome young man with a half-moon-like face.

“We’ve already fought these Sacred Palace disciples per the Palace Keeper Si Zhen’s requirements and have achieved what we wanted. There’s no need to waste time with them. Let’s go to the Space-time Palace now. Among the many cultivation places within the Sacred Palace, only the Space-time Beast inside the Space-time Palace could be helpful to us,” said a cold voice. It was the burly man at the back with a dark golden stone staff on his back.

“Yes, Senior Brother Tian Xin.”

The black-clothed girl along with the other two Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciples immediately nodded when the burly man spoke—no longer dared to talk anymore. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Those people from Dragon Phoenix Pavilion soon went straight to the Space-time Palace led by the experts from Sacred Palace.

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged under the Space-time Beast with a regretful look.

“What a pity. Although the Space-time Beast is amazing, its evolution in Space-time Law had only reached the early stage of its strangulation power. My current Space-time Law understanding is already at this level. It’ll only allow me to be more familiar with the Space-time Law if I continue doing this and that’s not much use to me.”

Jian Wushuang quickly walked out of the Space-time Palace after shaking his head.

As he stepped out of the Space-time Palace, Jian Wushuang coincidentally bumped into the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciples who were walking toward him.

Many disciples as well as Sacred Palace experts were following behind the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciples.

“So many people?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

The Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciples had also noticed Jian Wushuang.

“It’s him!”

A low voice suddenly came from the black-clothed girl among the four Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciples.

This black-clothed girl who ravaged many High-level Earth Ultimate God disciples from Sacred Palace in the battle earlier was powerful and had treated the other Sacred Palace disciples condescendingly, but she was stunned to see Jian Wushuang. Her eyes became extremely solemn while she stared closely at Jian Wushuang.

“Oh, someone familiar?”

Jian Wushuang also noticed the black-clothed girl as the corner of his mouth curled up.

That was not the first time he saw the black-clothed girl as they had even fought against each other before. He recalled that the other party had shown some extraordinary techniques and even brought him a little pressure, hence the black-clothed girl was rather memorable to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang later learned that the black-clothed girl was a Dragon Phoenix Pavilion disciple.

“Junior Sister, do you know this person?” The red-haired young man next to her looked over.

“Of course I do.” The black-clothed girl’s voice became low. “The three of you should’ve heard me talking about him before. I went on a mission to an ordinary stellar region decades ago while still a Primary-level Ultimate God and fought against a similarly ranked genius before being defeated.”

“I heard you mention this before. Could he be the one?” The red-haired young man immediately turned his gaze to Jian Wushuang.

The handsome young man with the half-moon face and even the cold-looking burly man Tian Xin also shot a glance at Jian Wushuang.

“That’s him.”

The black-clothed girl was the fifth opponent Jian Wushuang encountered during the Blood Gladiator Challenge on the Northern Darkstar Continent. The Ancient Witch said in a low voice, “I was defeated by his shocking strength decades ago and haven’t seen him for decades. I didn’t expect him to be at the Sacred Palace. He seems to be one of the Sacred Palace disciples and his cultivation realm... He made a breakthrough at a faster pace than me?”

The Ancient Witch was a little horrified when she noticed that.

She was the much-loved Dragon Phoenix Pavilion Princess with a powerful master guiding her alongside a steady supply of resources for self-improvement.

On the other hand, Jian Wushuang had to collect a large number of Primordial Stones and Divine Elixir Pills to improve his divine power while the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion paid a great price to construct a divine power fountain.
