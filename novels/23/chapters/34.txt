Chapter 35: Follow me

“Young Pavillion Master.”

The Four Great Elders walked before Jian Wushuang, then Elder Hong said, “We are here to thank you. Sword Pavilion would have fallen into the hands of Red Martial Hall if you hadn’t defeated Jian Meng’er.”

Senior Yuan said, “Yes, you were magnificent, Young Pavillion Master. It was amazing that it only took two months for you to surpass Jian Meng’er. You are definitely the son of the Pavilion Master.”

Senior Qing proudly said, “Hmm, when I heard that you, Young Pavillion Master, would have a battle with Jian Meng’er, I was sure that you could defeat her.”

Senior Li refuted him at once, “You dare to say that. You were the first to say that it was impossible.”

Hearing the Four Great Elders words and even seeing them play with each other, Jian Wushuang smiled. His heart was full of gratification.

But at the moment, Elder Hong looked at him and said, “Young Pavillion Master, you did a good job at a tough time. You held the Sword Pavilion together for us. But now you are leaving.”

“Leaving? Where am I going?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

With severe countenance, Elder Hong said, “You are leaving Sword Marquis Mansion and going somewhere else.”

Jian Wushuang felt a little puzzled, “But why?”

“Because….”, Elder Hong was silent, not knowing how to answer.

A cold voice suddenly rang out, “Stop your nonsense.” As Jian Wushuang turned and looked around, a green-clothed woman appeared behind him.

The green-clothed woman was graceful, with black hair and a veil covering her face. Although people could not see her actual appearance, one could tell that the woman was very beautiful just by looking into her eyes.

The green-clothed woman seemed charming. However, there was a faint smell on her body. All the good was gone.

Jian Wushuang frowned and asked, “Who are you?” He was sure that he had never seen this woman.

Elder Hong noticed the green-clothed woman and didn’t feel any sense of amazement. He said, “If you’re here, that means that the others should be ready.”

“Yes,” she nodded, stepping toward Jian Wushuang. “There is little time to say so much. You! Come with me at once.”

“Follow you?” Jian Wushuang showed alertness, and sword essence began to gather in his body.

“Ridiculous.” The woman laughed and moved around. Jian Wushuang did not react as the woman patted his forehead with her palm. At this moment a majestic Spiritual Power poured into his body. It blocked his eight extra channels and then seized his hands.

Jian Wushuang wanted to rebel, but he realized, to his horror, that he could not control his Spiritual Power.

Jian Wushuang was frightened, “Gold Core. She has at least cultivated a Gold Core, she might even be an expert of the Gold Core Realm.”

Elder Hong said loudly, “Young Pavillion Master, you can go with her. She won’t hurt you.”

Jian Wushuang tried to say something, but all of a sudden… BOOM!

A terrifying roar came from close behind, immediately followed by a large amount of Spiritual Power.

“Who are you? How dare you behave atrociously in my Sword Marquis Mansion!” A voice immediately rang through the sky.

Jian Wushuang recognized that the voice, it was the Sword Marquis Mansion Master, Jian Xinhong.

“They’re coming,” said the green-clothed woman, who had already put Jian Wushuang behind her back. “I’ll take him and hand everything else over to you.”

“The four of us are ready.” Elder Hong and other three Great Elders looked at each other, and each took out a Scarlet Pill. They did not hesitate to swallow the Scarlet Pill.

“Blind old man.”

Another person came to the courtyard, a graceful middle-aged woman. She was the proprietress of the wine shop where Elder Hong had gone before.

“Jiu Jun…” noticing that someone had come in, Elder Hong became nervous.

The woman smiled, “Nothing else to say? Give me a Scarlet Pill.”

Elder Hong frowned.

“No? Are you not willing or you do not have any?” The woman, Jiu Jun, smiled and then took out a Scarlet Pill, “Fortunately, I prepared one for myself.”

After finishing her words, she swallowed it quickly, not noticing Elder Hong’s expression.

Elder Hong sighed, “Jiu Jun, Why would you do this?”

“Blind old man, do you know why I always call you a Blind old man? Because you can’t see how I’ve felt about you for so many years,” Jiu Jun smiled, “But it does not matter anymore. Although we have not really been together, at least we can die together.”

Elder Hong took a deep look at Jiu Jun and nodded heavily.

The Four Great Elders of the Sword Pavilion and Jiu Jun had swallowed a Scarlet Pill. The aura surrounding the five people instantly soared up, directly reaching an unprecedented level.

Gold Core!

Five people had all reached the Primordial Gold Core Realm. Elder Hong’s aura was the strongest, reaching the point of the Profound Gold Core Realm.

“This, this …” Jian Wushuang was completely confused.

“What’s happening?”

“What’s the matter?”

“Who broke into the Sword Marquis Mansion? Who is the green-clothed woman with a veil? What kind of pill did the four Elders swallow? Why did their strength suddenly improve so much? And most importantly, why did they swallow this pill? Why do they look like they are going to die?”

Jian Wushuang had so many doubts. He did not understand what had happened.

All of this was too sudden, there had been no signs at all.

“Ji Wuyue, I will leave the young master to you.” Elder Hong turned red and growled with a trace of madness in his eyes.

Ji Wuyue looked at the five people. Two words that were so heavy came out of the mouth of the green-clothed woman slowly.

“Take care!”

After finishing her words, Ji Wuyue did not hesitate to turn around, taking Jian Wushuang away at full speed and sweeping out of Sword Marquis Mansion.

Just as Ji Wuyue turned and left, a wide roar of rage rang through Sword Marquis Mansion.

“Haha, you Blood Feather Tower bastards, prepare to go to hell!”

“Well, you five old people! How dare you block us?! Kill them!”

“Kill them!”

As the roar of rage echoed, the whole Sword Marquis Mansion was caught in a terrible war. Deadly amounts of Spiritual Power soared through the area.

While all this was happening, Jian Wushuang was totally at a loss.

“What on earth is happening?”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
