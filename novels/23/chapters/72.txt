Chapter 73: Sword Skills Being Obtained

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

It was not long before Jian Wushuang left the martial arts practice field.

“Wushuang, are you sure that you can duel with Nangong Jie in three months?” Wang Yuan could not help asking the question.

“I have already promised him. I can’t break my word, can I?” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

“But Nangong Jie is very strong.” Wang Yuan said seriously.

“I know, Nangong Jie can break through level six,” said Yang Zaixuan.

“I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded, but was not afraid. “Take it easy. I promised I would duel with him and I’m confident of success. In three months you’ll see.”

Jian Wushuang had a faint smile. He did not feel anxious.

Perhaps three months was a short time for ordinary warriors but for Jian Wushuang it was too long.

It had only taken him four months before he understood what the sword essence was.

It had only taken four months before Jian Wushuang was eligible to break through to the level five of the Dragon Gate. Perhaps, even Dragon Palace disciples would be shocked at his cultivation speed.

He had cultivated by himself without any teachers or help for four months. Even so, great progress had been made, not to mention now in the Dragon Palace.

The Dragon Palace was renown as a holy place for cultivating. It was rich in resources.

Four Temples of Earth, Fire, Water, and Wind; the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth; the Secret Pavilion…

Besides, Jian Wushuang could learn from so many talents now by exchanging views.

With such wonderful conditions for cultivation, he would certainly comprehend the Realm of Heaven and Earth faster!

That was why he was confident enough to duel with Nangong Jie in three months’ time and had promised that no matter how many points Nangong Jie required, Jian Wushuang would agree.

Anyway, nobody but Jian Wushuang himself knew the reason.

…

Shortly afterwards Jian Wushuang went to the Secret Pavilion again.

He had hardly won eleven duels in succession when he lost one in the martial art practice field. Every time he won a duel, Jian Wushuang would get 1,000 points. So he had 10,000 points in total. Including the 2,000 points from his own, he had 12,000 points in total. He was very well off now.

Surely now that he had enough points, Jian Wushuang would naturally buy whatever he wanted.

Using 7,000 points, he bought the Formless Sword Wave and three skills of the Formless Swordsmanship.

Then he exchanged 1,500 points for the Reincarnation Sword Skill in comprehending Sword Essence of Earth.

Reincarnation Sword Skill was a Sword Skill for defense; Sword Essence of Earth was the best for defense.

After obtaining these three superb Sword Skill, Jian Wushuang bought 20 First-class Divine Pills with 400 points.

Heavenly Spirit Pill was similar to Spirit-cultivating Pill. Only by breaking through Spiritual Sea Realm could warriors take Heavenly Spirit Pill. Weaker warriors should take Spirit-cultivating Pill. First-class Heavenly Spirit Pill was the best in Heavenly Spirit Pills. It was potent enough to produce the desired effect.

In the outside world, First-class Heavenly Spirit Pill was very rare with extraordinary value, but in the Secret Pavilion of Dragon Palace it only cost 20 points for one First-class Heavenly Spirit Pill. Thus, Jian Wushuang exchanged 400 points for 20 First-class Heavenly Spirit Pills.

As soon as he had bought what he wanted, he returned to his manor.

In the courtyard of the manor, Wang Yuan, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou sat at the stone table drinking wine. From time to time they turned to look at Jian Wushuang, who was practicing his Sword Skill.

BZZZ…

Jian Wushuang happened to be aggressive with his firm sword shadow.

It was quite easy for him to learn the first move of Formless Sword Wave without stopping.

The second, third, fourth…sixth move.

Formless Sword Ripple was divided into two parts. Each part included seven sword skills. However, Jian Wushuang was such a genius that he performed the first six sword skills easily.

“He has performed the sixth move?” Wang Yuan was shocked.

“After having bought the Sword Skill, he performed the first six moves in merely two hours. Even if he had comprehended the sword essence of earth, he shouldn’t have performed such sword tactics so fluently.” Yang Zaixuan was a little surprised as well.

After all, Sword Skills were combined perfectly using sword essence and swordsmanship. It was important to comprehend sword essence, but it was more important and difficult to grasp every move of the wonderful sword skills.

Like a general warrior, even if he got the Sword Skills and had the appropriate sword essence, it would take a long time to learn and grasp the moves and skills of sword tactics.

But Jian Wushuang was absolutely not an ordinary warrior.

After having bought the sword skills, he performed the first six moves in just two hours with no difficulty.

“He is a genius,” Yang Zaixuan thought with eyes blazing like torches. “Wushuang has a gift for sword principle.”

“He’s such a genius. If an ordinary genius wants to grasp the first moves of such advanced sword skills, he must learn for several days.” Wang Yuan sighed.

Jian Wushuang had hardly performed the sixth move of the Formless Sword Wave when he stopped practicing.

“Formless Sword Wave is worth 5,000 points. Every skill or move is powerful enough, so I’ll comprehend the Sword Essence of Earth as much as possible.” Jian Wushuang was quite satisfied.

He had always been distressed for he could not comprehend the sword essence of earth fully without suitable sword skills. But now he did not need to worry.

“What a pity. Perhaps I cannot comprehend the Sword Essence of Earth fully. Although I am trying my best, I cannot break through the sixth move,” Jian Wushuang thought.

He had grasped the basic skills of the seventh move but had not been able to perform the complete swordsmanship.

“Haste creates waste. I have to walk with a firm step.”

Jian Wushuang thought with a faint smile. Shortly afterwards he started learning the Reincarnation Sword Skill.

Early the next morning, Jian Wushuang came to the Four Temples.

The Four Temples of Earth, Fire, Water and Wind were renowned for their six strong temple masters, who would occasionally give instruction in the palace. Today, a master was giving lessons. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jian Wushuang went into the Ground Palace where many of Dragon Palace disciples sat on the ground. Some were discussing as they pleased.

Jian Wushuang did not mind the disciples talking around him. He sat down and closed his eyes to cultivate.

It was not long before a master appeared. Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and turned to him.

He was a middle-aged man wearing a golden robe. He looked quite kind. He seemed to be an ordinary person without excessive tyranny, but when Jian Wushuang first looked at this middle-aged man, he found himself deeply attracted by the master, as if the man had something magical.

“That is why he can give lessons in Dragon Palace. Although he showed no strength outside, he seems stronger than Ye Rufeng,” Jian Wushuang thought.
