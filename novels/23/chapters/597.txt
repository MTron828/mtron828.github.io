Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang sighed in private.

“Flying to the Ninth Heaven” was about reaching a flawless level in every aspect.

As his body had now reached a flawless condition, he had to wait for a special chance to enhance the defense of his body.

Which is to say, even if he could reach the 11th and 12th Level at this moment, it would only increase his physical strength, not his body’s defense.

The Holy Ancestor Feast began.

Holy Ancestor was a supreme being in the Divine Land, so no one would refuse to join the feast he held to celebrate his 2000th birthday.

Among the Three Ancestors, except Su Ming who was in other plane worlds and could not be there, both Spirit Ancestor and Stone Ancestor were present at the feast.

The other Skyscraping Realm experts also attended it.

Dong Ming King and Qian Xingzi, who had participated in exterminating Sword Ancestor and forced Jian Wushuang away from the Divine Land, were there for the feast as well.

Following them were the eight sovereigns and the considerably powerful marquises.

In short, the feast was of the highest level in the Divine Land.

During the feast, all the experts gathered at a large Martial Arts Practice Field. Holy Ancestor sat at the top of the field in his white robe. He looked holy while basking in the sun, beaming with joy.

“Ladies and gentlemen, I’ve traveled around the Purple Jade Continent only to gain the Purple Jade Wine at any cost. I’ve never tasted any wine better than it. Now, fill up your cup and drink with me,” Holy Ancestor said and held up his cup as his voice echoed throughout the field.

Spirit Ancestor, Stone Ancestor, Dong Ming King, and Qian Xingzi, who sat beside him on both sides, all held up their cups.

Those experts in Skyscraping Realm talked to each other. They had their own social circuit, which was also true for the sovereigns and marquises.

The combination of the marquises and the Holy Ancestor’s Core Disciples who were at the feast numbered in the hundreds. Among the crowd, Jian Wushuang hid his aura with his Aura Restraint skill and used a bamboo hat to conceal his face. Therefore, no one noticed him.

Beside Jian Wushuang, Lin Lan, Marquis Zizhong, and Marquis Guyang all sat perfectly straight at the long table. They looked at ease and even talked to other with a smile sometimes. But, in fact, they were quite nervous.

They all knew Jian Wushuang’s intentions and, In their opinion, it was a crazy idea.

“Those who should be present are all here.”?Jian Wushuang looked up at the top of the field, where over eight Skyscraping Realm experts sat.

Among them were the Three Ancestors and five experts from other plane worlds.

“Outside of Spirit Ancestor, the other seven people are my enemies.”?Jian Wushuang pondered.

He had confirmed that Spirit Ancestor was not among the murderers of Sword Ancestor.

He even learned that Spirit Ancestor used to get along well with Sword Ancestor. Moreover, Spirit Ancestor had protected Sword Marquis Mansion from being destroyed.

He never even tried to force Jian Wushuang to speak about the location of Sword Ancestor’s cave mansion.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang regarded this ancestor as his benefactor.

However, the other seven people had been involved in both events.

“Five of them are at Level One of the Skyscraping Realm while the other two, Holy Ancestor and Dong Ming King, are at Level Two. I’m strong enough to kill them all with my current power.”?Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

A person’s power differed in the Skyscraping Realm, so they were divided into three levels.

Level One referred to the normal Skyscraping Realm.

Most of the experts were at this level, like Blood Bladesman, who Jian Wushuang had killed, and most of the Human Temple Masters. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Level Two referred to the superior Skyscraping Realm. Most people at this level had comprehended a Dao to a certain level and possessed some powerful skills.

Temple Master Iceberg was at this level when Jian Wushuang killed him.

As for Level Three, only top experts could reach this level. They were excellent in comprehending the Dao and extremely powerful.

The three Monster Emperors of Monster Continent, Temple Master Black Spirit, and Sword Ancestor were at this level.

Normally, it was easy for those at Level Three to overpower those at Level Two.

The reason why Sword Ancestor had been killed by the dozens of experts at Level One and Two was because, before fighting with them, he had gotten seriously injured in the fight for the Ancient World Token. However, he had been so powerful that even after his death, his murderers still did not get the token.

Jian Wushuang believed himself to be a little more powerful than Sword Ancestor because he had reached the Nine-cloud Realm and had Strongest Sword Soul, along with many secret skills. He was among the stronger ones at Level Three.

With such power, it was easy for him to kill seven enemies in the Level One and Two range.

“Lan’er.” Jian Wushuang shot Lin Lan a meaningful glance.

Lin Lan immediately stood up and walked to the center of the field.

The drinking and chatting experts looked up curiously when saw Lin Lan’s action.

“Marquis Lanyue, what’s the matter?” An expert asked her with a frown.

Lin Lan did not answer him but looked up at Holy Ancestor.

“Holy Ancestor.” Lin Lan called out and her voice echoed throughout the field.

Holy Ancestor and the other experts sitting beside him immediately looked down at her.

“I came across a treasure by luck, but it’s useless to me. Please allow me to present it to you as a birthday gift,” Lin Lan said solemnly.
