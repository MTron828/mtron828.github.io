Chapter 677: Personal Disciple

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Drill Ground was completely silent.

The 30th floor?

Almost no one could believe what they heard.

Even the two geniuses, Luo Yong and Donger, looked at Jian Wushuang in astonishment.

It had been several decades since they arrived at the Ancient Sect and they were convinced they’d made great progress over the years. But, their results were nothing when compared to Jian Wushuang. They couldn’t even be compared.

He’d passed through 30 of the 31 floors in the Ninth Heaven Road. There was only one floor left for Jian Wushuang to pass.

It had only been two years since Jian Wushuang joined the Ancient Sect.

“Jian Wushuang, you…”

Feng, who stood beside Jian Wushuang, looked as if he had seen a ghost. He knew that Jian Wushuang had passed through more floors because he had asked him, but he only thought Jian Wushuang got through the 21st floor. So, he was not that discouraged and believed he could catch up to him in the future.

But now… He hears that it was the 30th floor, ten floors ahead of him.

In the past two years, he thought he had caught up with Jian Wushuang, but now he realized the gap between Jian Wushuang and him had only grown larger, far more than he could handle.

The ten-year Ancient Sect Competition came to an end.

And, with that, the ten places for inner disciple had been decided. Both Jian Wushuang and Feng kept their positions as inner disciples and only Huo Ying lost his position and became an outer disciple.

However, even though the Sect Competition had come to an end, there was still a heated discussion going on about Jian Wushuang. It was a hot topic among the disciples at first, but the heated discussions finally began to die down after several days.

Jian Wushuang brushed aside those voices. After the Sect Competition finished, he immediately headed to Sword Palace and began meditating in front of the stone tablet in front of Sword Tower.

Jian Wushuang had already grasped the second of the three sword scars left by Xuan Yi and had become his nominal disciple. As for the third scar…

The third sword scar fused all nine sword movements from the first sword scar into one, which was 1000 times more difficult than the second sword scar.

As Jian Wushuang was meditating, his Cultivation in Sword Principle had increasingly improved. It didn’t mean that he couldn’t grasp the third sword scar, but he had no idea where to begin.

It had only been recently that he finally condensed his Sword Heart.

Now that his Sword Heart was condensed, he looked at the three sword scars again. But, now they looked completely different to him.

Previously, he couldn’t even figure out where to start while looking at the third sword scar. But now, with just a simple glimpse, he suddenly felt inspired.

Half a month later.

Crash!

A sword light flew out and rushed through the empty space ahead.

It seemed to move without making noise or disturbing the surroundings, but right after the sword light passed through the area, there was a series of explosions. Boom! Boom!

This sword seemed to be a combination of many Occults, which resulted in terribly enormous power. When performed, it was even more powerful than the Superior Rank Three Secret Skill he created, Violet Devastation Sword Skill.

“What a frightening sword strike.”

Jian Wushuang raised the Heart-killing Sword in his hand, looking at a series of overwhelming swordsmanship movements in front, with his eyes displaying a slight shade of shock.

This sword strike was so frightening that Jian Wushuang even believed it was much more powerful than a Rank Four Secret Skill.

It was definitely a powerful killing move.

“Have you grasped it?” Suddenly, a soft floating voice sounded beside him.

Jian Wushuang looked next to him and realized that Xuan Yi had suddenly appeared by his side. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Master,” Jian Wushuang immediately bowed and said.

Xuan Yi stepped forward slowly, then stopped less than a meter away from Jian Wushuang.

“When you condensed your Sword Heart on the Ninth Heaven Road, I knew that it wouldn’t take you long to grasp the three sword scars I Ieft behind, but it’s only been half a month…” A mild smile grew on Xuan Yi’s face as he continued, “I made a rule, if anyone below the Eternal Realm fully grasps my three sword scars, they can become my personal disciple.”

“Since you’ve succeeded, from this day on you will be my fourth personal disciple.

“The fourth personal disciple?” It seemed to appeal Jian Wushuang.

In the two years he spent in the Ancient Sect, he’d never heard that Xuan Yi had other personal disciples.

Many disciples of Sword Palace said that there was nobody who had fully comprehended all three of the sword scars left by Xuan Yi, but now…

“You do have three Senior Brothers, but they have already left the Ancient Sect and set off on new adventures. If possible, you will meet them one day,” Xuan Yi said and smiled.

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly, filled with anticipation at the bottom of his heart.

There were very high standards for becoming one of Xuan Yi’s personal disciples. The other three Senior Brothers should all be extraordinary, so he was looking forward to seeing their abilities someday.

“Follow me,” Xuan Yi said.

Xuan Yi led Jian Wushuang to Sword Tower.

Only Jian Wushuang and Xuan Yi were left inside Sword Tower.

“Now that it’s only the two of us, I have something I want to ask you,” Xuan Yi said while looking at Jian Wushuang.

“Master, please ask.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“Earlier, at Firmament Territory Feast, I realized you must have received a remarkable opportunity in the Ancient World. If not, how is it possible for you to reach your current level and even acquire the Doppelganger Secret Skill in less than 40 years?” Xuan Yi said.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

After seeing his performance at Firmament Territory Feast, even the experts from every Sect could tell that he had received an extraordinary opportunity, let alone Xuan Yi, so Jian Wushuang could not deny it.

“At that time, we didn’t have any relationship, so I never asked you about it. After all, everyone has had their own opportunities and I won’t interfere with it. But now, since you are my personal disciple, I have to ask about your previous experience,” Xuan Yi said.

Jian Wushuang also understood.

As a master, one must have a certain understanding of his disciples’ previous experiences.

“I did have a somewhat outstanding opportunity in the Ancient World and I was even lucky enough to be instructed by a super expert,” Jian Wushuang said directly. Of course, the super expert he referred to was undoubtedly Emperor Xiao.

“Ah? I see.” Xuan Yi seemed to realize something, then he immediately continued, “Do you have a Secret Skill for Body Reshaping? Your foundation seems extraordinarily strong.”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded again, “I acquired a Body Reshaping Technique called Immortality in the Ancient World, so my body should be quite strong. As for my foundation, I have to thank the experts’ guidance for that.”

Jian Wushuang didn’t intend to reveal anything about the Heavenly Creation Skill, which was his biggest secret. So, the only thing he could do was to place the blame on Emperor Xiao.

“Immortality Secret Skill?” Xuan Yi raised his eyebrows but didn’t continue asking about it.

As a master, he only needed to know what Jian Wushuang had experienced. There was no need to go into detail about it.
