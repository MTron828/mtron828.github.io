4752 Heavenly Dao Library

In the end, thanks to Jian Wushuang’s intervention, Ding Beichun was not beaten up.

“Don’t worry, brother Jian. I’ll definitely forge a perfect sword for you in less than a century,” Ding Beichun said shamefully. “However, I’m afraid that the fate energy…”

Jian Wushuang did not scold him. Instead, he patted his shoulder and said, “Don’t feel too pressured. It’s fine if you don’t have it. That sword is no longer suitable for me. I’m looking forward to the sword you will give me in the future.”

Even though he said that, he still felt a sense of reluctance and loss in his heart.

He had ascended to this ultimate Great Yan Domain from the Divine Power Universe by himself, and the only Tarot Divine Sword had become his sustenance.

The familiar fate energy had disappeared, and even the last half of the Tarot Divine Sword had been reduced to dust.

Ding Beichun nodded heavily. “Don’t worry, Brother Jian. I, Ding Beichun, never go back on my word. Even if we don’t see each other again in the future, I’ll still personally deliver the sword to you.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Alright, I’ll wait for that day.” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“And brother Jian, I can feel that your way of the sword is completely different from my Master’s. I look forward to seeing you two discuss the sword one day. That was definitely an amazing battle,” Ding Beichun said.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang became interested. Whether it was from the Young Emperor or Ding Beichun, he had heard about his mysterious Master too many times.

Just as he was about to ask, a supreme pressure quietly appeared behind the three of them.

Jian Wushuang and the Young Emperor looked back at the same time and saw Uncle Yu staring at them with a cold face.

“U-Uncle Yu, listen to me…”

Below the platform, the two figures who were tied tightly to the pillars by Yan power ropes looked as if they had lost all will to live.

In the blink of an eye, Sword Heaven was tied up and brought back to the platform. To prevent the two from escaping again, the Yan power rope was almost tied to their heads.

“I say, Uncle Yu, the confinement is not that strict, is it? We didn’t do anything bad in there…” the Young Emperor said helplessly.

But no matter how hard he tried to open his mouth, Uncle Yu remained silent like a rock.

“Uncle Yu, please don’t imprison us like this. Why don’t you lock us up in the Heavenly Dao Library? We can read more books there.”

Uncle Yu opened his eyes slowly, then waved his hand to untie the ropes that bound the two.

“You are only allowed to go to the Heavenly Dao Library. If I discover that you guys have gone to other places, your confinement will be increased by another ten years.”

The Young Emperor raised his eyebrows and pulled Jian Wushuang out of the Wind-Listening Platform again.

“I’m telling you, don’t drag me to some random place again,” Jian Wushuang said in dissatisfaction among the clouds.

The Young Emperor turned his head and smiled. “Don’t worry. I promise I won’t take you to any messy places this time.”

The Heavenly Dao Library was located in the center of the platform. Other than the Emperor and some Elders, it was not open to any Yan Immortals or Goddesses.

After flying in the Immortal cloud for half a day, Jian Wushuang saw a lofty pavilion sitting in the light wheel.

Nearly 20 overlapping light wheels rotated slowly, surrounding the pavilion in the middle. It looked sacred and mysterious.

When their feet landed on the ground, a few of the little attendants who were cleaning the square saw the two of them and bowed.

“This library is rarely visited by people. There are countless scrolls in it, including all the cultivation techniques and Daoist scriptures of the entire Great Si Region.”

The Young Emperor explained as he pushed open the dusty library.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was tempted. If what he said was true, he might be able to find some clues in the Heavenly Dao Library.

Even if he only understood some of the situations in the Great Yan Domain, it was much better than running around like a headless fly.

He pushed the door open and entered. A spiral wooden ladder that led upwards appeared in front of him.

“Although this is called a library, the space here is not much smaller than some ordinary Heavenly Regions. You can see all the profound cultivation techniques here.”

The Young Emperor explained as he walked forward slowly. At the same time, he waved his hand, and the clouds on both sides of the wooden ladder retreated, revealing a wall of books piled up with countless ancient books.

There were countless scrolls in it. Jian Wushuang took out a single book named ‘Mighty Secret Method’. It described the rudiments of the technique in great detail and was a rare treasure.

After flipping through another six to seven books, he truly felt that the Heavenly Dao Library was a treasure vault.

The secret techniques and cultivation techniques recorded in each of these books were no weaker than the Ancestral Skills. If they were placed in any Heavenly Region, they would probably cause a bloody storm.

However, these were not what Jian Wushuang wanted. He wanted to find a book that described the Great Yan Domain in detail and the mystery of the cultivation realms above Yan Immortal realm.

After he told the Young Emperor about this idea, he only got a shake of the head.

“You want to know the situation of the entire Great Yan Domain? Do you know how vast the entire Great Si Region is? I’m afraid even my Imperial Father can’t be sure of the situation in the Great Yan Domain.”

“A Heavenly Region is like a lone boat in the Great Yan Domain. Unless you can sense the existence of that realm, you will never be able to understand it.”

“The prerequisite for exploring this place is to have the Emperor’s fate energy.” The Young Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang with a meaningful look.

“And the prerequisite to becoming an Emperor is to completely step past the Yan Immortal realm and become a Grand Yan Immortal.”

“Grand Yan Immortal?” This was the first time Jian Wushuang had heard of a new realm other than the Yan Immoral realm.

The Young Emperor nodded. “That’s right. All the Elders you saw in the Heavenly Court, including my Imperial Father, were all at the Grand Yan Immortal realm.”

“However, there are differences between Grand Yan Immortals. Although my Imperial Father is also a Grand Yan Immortal, he has the Imperial Emperor’s fate energy. He can create the Heavenly Court and control the Heavenly Region.”

Jian Wushuang quickly absorbed the questions about realms and then asked, “What realms are above the Grand Yan Immoral?”

“I’m afraid only my Imperial Father can explain this. As for me, I haven’t broken through to the Grand Yan Immortal realm.” The Young Emperor laughed at himself and walked forward slowly.

Jian Wushuang did not ask any more questions. He learned that there was a Great Yan Immortal realm above the Yan Immortal realm. As for Emperors, they were people who showed control and dominance in the Great Yan Immortal realm.

It made him subconsciously feel that the realms above the Grand Yan Immortal were very likely to be known or advanced only after becoming an Emperor.

As the wooden ladder under his feet spiraled up, Jian Wushuang continuously took out books and read them.

Just as he finished reading another book and was about to continue, a book that was slightly thicker than the other books came into view.
