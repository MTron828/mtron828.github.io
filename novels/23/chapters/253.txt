Chapter 254: Devourment of Heaven and Earth, Soul-Devouring Secret Skill!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang was lying at the bottom of the giant pit.

There were remnants of blood in his mouth. His face was deathly white. He felt a sharp pain throughout his entire body.

The Divine Transcendence expert was quite powerful indeed.

“Fortunately, the Heavenly Creation Skill has continuously remolded my body. It made all of the bones and muscles in my body much tougher and durable than the average warrior. Otherwise, the third finger would have finished me off,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

The power of the three fingers was earth-shattering.

Under the attack of the three fingers, he was seriously injured.

“Can only rely on the final trump card,” Jian Wushuang said with a twinkle of madness in his eyes.

His most powerful trump card was Soul-Devouring Secret Skill!

Soul-Devouring Secret Skill had saved his life from crises many times before.

Now, the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill had become his final hope.

“Secret Skill...Soul-Devouring!” Jian Wushuang shouted. Then within his body there exploded out a violent and terrible power.

The first volume of the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill absorbed all natural power within a 100-meter radius, and was extremely potent.

However, the second volume of the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill was even more frightening.

As the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill was performed, there was a rumble and the heavens and earth changed color. Under the gaze of the countless experts inside and out of the Heartless Island, an unprecedented terrific power exploded out from the bottom of the pit.

Devourment of Heaven and Earth!

In an instant, a giant engulfing whirlpool formed at the bottom of the giant pit.

At this moment, a vast amount of natural power coming from all things of the universe headed towards that engulfing whirlpool.

“What’s this?”

“What is that?”

“A whirlpool? Such frightening power to engulf everything.”

The countless experts on the edges were shaken as they watched this giant whirlpool appear. Everyone felt as if their hearts were going to leap out from their chests.

Even when Qi Luosheng saw a giant swallowing whirlpool appear at the bottom, his face fell. “Using your final trump card, eh?”

He knew Jian Wushuang was the type to have an ace up his sleeve, and was able to make his power rise sharply in a short span of time.

However, this kind of trump card was not Qi Luosheng’s concern at all.

“Hmph, you can only go up one level in regards to your own Realm. Even if you can go from the Initial Yang Void Realm to Profound Yang Void Realm, then what?” Qi Luosheng said with disdain.

Jian Wushuang ever used this trump card before when he was in the Easternmost Hunting. He then elevated himself from the Exceptional Gold Core Realm to Initial Yin Void Realm, but he had only gone up one level.

In Qi Luosheng’s mind, by using this trump card Jian Wushuang could at best just go from the Initial Yang Void Realm to Profound Yang Void Realm.

But he didn’t know that Jian Wushuang just grasped the first volume of the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill when he was in the Easternmost Hunting. Now, he had grasped the second volume!

“Look around. Look at those trees, what’s wrong?” a voice cried in alarm.

Everyone then saw that in the Heartless Island, a great number of flowers, plants, and trees all dried up one after the other. Just in an instant, all of them had been deprived of their life force.

The ground of the Heartless Island was affected. The earth that had originally been full of vitality had become dry and yellow in an instant, to the point where cracks have started appearing as if a long drought befell the island.

The Heartless Island that had previously been abundant with life had seemingly become a place of death in an instant.

How big was the entire Heartless Island? No less than a considerable amount of miles!

Could any skill really kill off an entire island of this size so quickly and efficiently?

Everyone saw this act and it was nearly enough to make their heads explode in a fit of terror.

Once the entire Heartless Island’s natural power had been swallowed up, the force of the giant swirling whirlpool at the bottom of the pit stood stagnated and then dissipated. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang, who had originally been lying down, slowly stood up. As he stood up, a frightening aura exploded out from his body.

With the help of the first volume of the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill, he could merely swallow up all of the natural power within a radius of 100 meters.

However, after performing the second volume, he devoured all of the natural power on the entire island without exception.

His Cultivation of Spiritual Power rose sharply in an instant. He had achieved the Peak of the Yang Void Realm!

“Peak of Yang Void Realm!”

Jian Wushuang glanced at his palms and then clasped them together. A blast of cracking sounds came out as if he scratched the air.

Going directly from the Initial Yang Void Realm to the Peak of the Yang Void Realm, he had advanced by no less than three levels, and this was all within the Yang Void Realm.

In the Nanyang Continent, there were some extremely powerful elixirs that could sharply increase one’s power in a short span of time. With regards to Yang Void experts, there are limitations; they could improve one level at most.

However, the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill had allowed Jian Wushuang to advance by three levels!

How powerful!

Of course, this potent secret technique placed also a heavy burden on the body.

“The natural power is too much. The longer I utilize the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill, the greater effect it has on my body.”?Jian Wushuang frowned and suddenly raised his head.

Boom!

With a terrifying aura, Jian Wushuang lept out from the bottom of the pit, and once more appeared in front of Qi Luosheng. Immediately, his terrifying aura swept out and caused many of the experts around the perimeter to feel it.

“Such a strong aura. How could his Cultivation of Spiritual Power improve to such an extent?”

“All of that just then, that was all his doing?”

“What on earth kind of method is this?”

“A terrifying method.”

Numerous of the surrounding experts were all dumbstruck.

As he watched Jian Wushuang’s aura, Qi Luosheng was also astonished. “Peak of the Yang Void Realm?”

But he still smiled just as before. “Even with the Cultivation of Spiritual Power advancement, then what? In the end it’s still only the Yang Void Realm. In the face of the Saint Realm, he’s a mere ant and that’s all.

“For this next move, I’ll use full power.”

When Qi Luosheng finished speaking, a finger of his right hand once again slowly raised up.

“It just so happens that I also don’t want to waste time,” Jian Wushuang said coldly. The Triple-kill Sword in his hand trembled with excitement. Behind him, the towering figure of the giant had once again emerged.

It was still the first move of the Blood Emptying Technique, but in the wake of Jian Wushuang’s sharp rise in Cultivation of Spiritual Power, the power of the stroke had advanced to a truly terrifying state.

The unmatched stroke once again descended.

Qi Luosheng’s finger extended and the giant finger lashed out once again.

In a split second, the two terrifying powers collided with each other.

It was as if two stars were colliding head on.

Slam!

There was a world-shaking tremor. The earth quaked and the mountains shook.

Swoosh... The awful blast waves viciously swept out. The entire Heartless Island started to violently shake. At the core of the collision, a streak of sword light flew off without warning.

It mercilessly swept across the Heartless Island.

Rumble... In an instant, the Heartless Island split in two.
