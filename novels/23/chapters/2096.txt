Chapter 2097 Reinforcements!

The Black Dragon Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang in a different manner.

Ba Su’s face turned after Jian Wu Shuang appeared.

“Ancient God Emperor?”

“How is this possible? Why is he here?”

The cold man in dark robes from the Acheron Palace transmitted a message to Ba Su when he was shocked. “Leader Ba Su, people of the Acheron Palace just told me that the formation they placed outside was destroyed. Many people managed to break through and are heading this way right now.”

“What?” Ba Su face darkened. Many figures of powerful people appeared in his vision.

Among them were King Chen Xing and other Eight and Nine star Ancient Gods!

These Ancient Gods rushed into the battlefield and helped out the various members of the Black Water Dragon Clan.

“It’s the Ancient God Clan! The Ancient God Clan is here!”

“Haha. Yes, Yes! The Black Water Dragon Clan has hope!!”

“The Ancient God Clan arrived on time.”

The members of the Black Water Dragon Clan were excited.

They immediately allied with the Ancient God CLan.

“How did this happen?” The experts from the Sky Swallowing Clan and the Acheron Palace were stunned.

People like Ba Su had a gloomy face.

Their original plan had been to purposefully create chaos among the Special Tribes. During the chaos, when all the clans cared about themselves, they would go and destroy the Black Water Dragon Clan decisively.

Even though they would suffer losses during the battle, the Sky Swallowing Clan could devour the blood essence of the experts from the Black Water Dragon Clan and get stronger. Their overall power would instead increase due to this.

As long as they did this well, no one would know that the Sky Swallowing Clan had participated in this if they did not leave any marks behind. People would think that the destruction of the Black Water Dragon Clan was due to the Acheron Palace.

The Sky Swallowing Clan could continue to stay undercover and find a good time to destroy the God Eater Clan. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Once these two top tier clans were gone, the Special Tribes Alliance would receive a devastating blow. They could then focus on dealing with the Ancient God Clan. With luck, the Sky Swallowing Clan would become the true kings amongst the Special Tribes.

Without the other three top tier clans, the remaining clans would not be able to do anything as they wouldn’t even have any great emperors. They couldn’t ally with Sanctuary Alliance.

This was the plan.

The plan was executed hastily. Even though the risks were greater, there were no holes within the plan.

He thought that the extinction of the Black Water Dragon Clan was inevitable.

However, the results…

“The Ancient God Clan. Why is the Ancient God Clan here? And the Ancient God Emperor personally leading the charge!!” Ba Su roared.

Jian Wushuang looked at Ba Su and scoffed. “Leader Ba Su, are you surprised to see me? You are probably thinking that I should be within the Ancient God Clan or heading to the other clans to aid in their battles, right?”

“However, you underestimated me. I received information from the Sanctuary Alliance that the Sky Swallowing Clans has secret interactions with the Acheron Palace. Furthermore, your actions during the coronation ceremony helped me confirm that the Sky Swallowing Clan has allied with the Acheron Palace.”

“This time, the various clans in the Special Tribes Alliance went into chaos at the same time. Even the God Eater Clan had to deal with some problems. On the other hand, the Sky Swallowing Clan and the Black Water Dragon Clan remained calm. At that point in time, I was sure that you would attack the Black Water Dragon Clan!”

“After all, having chaos within the clans or having a few experts die from every clan would have negligible effects on the Special Tribes Alliance. Wouldn’t the repercussions be much greater if an entire top tier clan was destroyed? Am I right?”

Jian Wushuang looked at Ba Su with great interest and smiled

Hearing this, Ba Su was dumbfounded.

He had never guessed that Jian Wushuang could deduce that the Sky Swallowing Clan would attack the Black Water Dragon Clan just because the Black Water Dragon Clan was peaceful. He also did not expect that the Ancient God Emperor could come on time.

This brilliance…

“I admit that I indeed underestimated you. I never thought with your incredible talent and power that you were so brilliant. It was no wonder you managed to become the only new Ancient God Emperor after all this time.” Ba Su said.

“However, so what if you are here? More than half of the experts from the Ancient God Clan had to stay within the clan to prevent a backstab. Many others went, under the guidance of King Zhan Cang, to assist other clans. Even with these experts you brought, the fighting power will be n where near to what we have.”

“It is still uncertain who will emerge victorious!”

“Haha. Lets try.” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly as he unsheathed his Blood Mountain Sword and attacked Ba Su.

At the same time……

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Six beams of golden light flashed all around him. It was the six Hong Jun Golden Swords he had.

Ba Su looked at the swords gravely.

He could deal with the Black Dragon Emperor easily even if she used all her might.

It was different if his opponent was Jian Wushuang.

He could still remember the battle during the coronation ceremony clearly.

Boom! Boom!

Ba Su fought Jian Wushuang with all his fight. As expected, he was completely suppressed under the pressure of the six Hong Jun Golden Swords.

On the entire battlefield, the Black Water Dragon Clan was at a severe disadvantage.

It was not simply the difference at the level of the Almighty. There were two great emperors who were freely wreaking havoc on the battlefield.

When the experts from the Ancient God Clan arrived and joined the battlefield, the tides turned.

At the level of an almighty, there were eight Eight-star Ancient Gods. Among them were King Gu You, and three other top tier eight star ancient gods. The remaining were seven star ancient gods. Once this fighting power entered the battlefield, the fighting power equal the level of of the almighty.

The Sky Swallowing Clan had five Great Emperors. On the other hand, there were only four great emperors on the side of the Black Water Dragon Clan and the reinforcements from Jian Wushuang.

They had one less, but the quality of the great emperors was higher.
