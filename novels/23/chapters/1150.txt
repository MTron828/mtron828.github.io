Chapter 1151: Determination

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“I’ve never expected that I would get ambushed by experts from the Jin Kingdom right after I became a Dao Master. It looks like this Original Body of mine is doomed,” Jian Wushuang said gravely but still had a smile on his face. “Gu King, get prepared. I’ll create a chance for you to escape with all my treasures.”

“Have you already made up your mind, Jian Wushuang?” asked Gu King, solemnly.

“Yeah,” Jian Wushuang nodded and said. “This Original Body of mine is definitely going to perish. This Red Snow King is exceptionally strong and fast. I can’t shake him off with the help of my Quicksand Realm and even my Dragon Blood Secret Skill, and it’s impossible for experts of the Green Fire Palace to come to my rescue in time.

“I have two Original Bodies. When this one is gone, I’ll come back to life through the other one. It’s not a big deal. However, I really need you to keep all my treasures for me.”

“I see,” said Gu King said. “You can hand over Blood-killing Plate Armor and Blood Mountain Sword to me. What about Blaze Quicksand Gourd?”

Jian Wushuang carried three treasures with this Original Body, which included Blood-killing Plate Armor, Blood Mountain Sword and Blaze Quicksand Gourd. As for the more precious treasures, such as Mountain River Map, they had been left with the other Original Body of Jian Wushuang.

“I need this Blaze Quicksand Gourd during the fight, so I can’t give it to you. Maybe I’ll lose it in the end, but I can accept this result.” Jian Wushuang paused for a moment and continued, “Beside the two treasures you’ve mentioned, I’ll give you two drops of Ancient God Power, some elixir which can restore your Spiritual Power and some other treasures except Blaze Quicksand Gourd. You have to take all of them away. If you can’t, destroy them. I can’t let my enemies have them!

“Of course, the most important thing is that you have to keep yourself safe.”

Jian Wushuang emphasized.

Gu King had been parasitic in him for so many years. He had begun to treat him like family a long time ago. He was willing to give up all his treasures, even his Blood-killing Plate Armor and Blood Mountain Sword, to ensure that Gu King could survive.

“Don’t worry, I’m a seasoned worrior. I accompanied King Luo Zhen everywhere when he was exploring the Eternal Chaotic World. Although I’m not so powerful as before, which is because I’ve recognized you as my owner, a Universe Master can never kill me,” Gu King said confidently.

“That’s good.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly.

He continued to escape, and when he spotted a high mountain in front of him, excitement flickered within his eyes.

“Here, it’s near the Chillywind Valley!”

With these words, he clenched his fists to stop himself and suddenly turned around.

“Buzz—” He absorbed a drop of Ancient God Power. The next moment his aura got much stronger.

“Go die!”

He shouted loudly and rushed toward Red Snow King.

“You just can’t wait to die!”

Red Snow King sneered and thrust his long spear toward Jian Wushuang.

As the spear was pushed forward violently, red snowflakes drifted down, making the fighting scenes beautiful and eye-catching.

Jian Wushuang propelled his sword forward, making a slight whistling sound.

In an instant, his Soul Attack reached Red Snow King with strong destructive powers and Killing Intent from the Killing Bead.

“What?

“This consciousness attack seems to be as fierce as the one launched by Tianhuan King.”

Red Snow King thought, grim-faced.

However, Jian Wushuang’s Soul Attack failed to exert much influence on Red Snow King. The latter’s long spear was as powerful as before and quickly clashed against Blood Mountain Sword.

“Clang!”

After the loud clunk, Red Snow King twisted his wrist to rotate his spear, creating a vortex in the void, and then hurled it at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang did not have enough time to dodge. All he could do at that time was lifting up his Blood Mountain Sword to block the spear.

“Bang!”

The next moment, he was knocked away. He flew backward until he bumped into the high mountain behind him.

He smashed into the mountain and was buried by the gravel.

“Here you are. Keep them for me, Gu King!”

Jian Wushuang said as he tossed out an Interspatial Ring, which contained Blood-killing Plate Armor, Blood Mountain Sword and many other treasures he had collected before.

In the meantime, a flowing red light shone across the place where Jian Wushuang landed. It was Plenilune Centipede, Gu King.

It had not appeared too bulky this time. It caught the Interspatial Ring with his mouth, swallowed it down and tunneled into the mountain and then the ground, hurriedly fleeing away from this place.

“Boom!”

Jian Wushuang flew out of the mountain and then toward the Chillywind Valley.

“What?”

Red Snow King was a little surprised. He had been fixed his gaze upon Jian Wushuang all this while and naturally noticed Gu King.

“Worm beast?” Red Snow King wondered.

“No matter what it is, I’ll kill it.”

Red Snow King had a strong killing intent. He used his consciousness to lock on Gu King and then swished his hand to launch a fierce attack on it.

After that, he continued to chase after Jian Wushuang.

“Boom!”

Red Snow King’s offensive power penetrated the ground and reached Gu King, but it only affected its speed instead of killing it. In the end, it still managed to sneak into the deepest part of the earth and disappeared.

“Swoosh! Swoosh!”

Red Snow King was closely after Jian Wushuang, and behind them were Tianhuan King, Golden Rock King and Tianying King. However, these three kings were quite far away from them now.

Without Gu King’s help, Jian Wushuang was unable to restore his powers as easily as before. To make matters worse, the Dragon Blood Secret Skill he uesd to escape kept draining away his Spiritual Power. As such, he could not sustain himself like this for a very long time.

Given this, he decided to go to the place he always wanted to visit.

Soon enough, Jian Wushuang and Red Snow King saw a vast sinkhole.

“The Chillywind Valley!”

Jian Wushuang rushed toward the center of the sinkhole, excitement flickered in his eyes.

When he arrived at the center of the sinkhole, he stopped.

“Buzz—” The Blaze Quicksand around him dispersed.

He stood there, pale and gasping feebly, but he did not look frightened.

“Swoosh!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The red-haired Red Snow King arrived and stopped in front of Jian Wushuang.

As for Tianhuan King, Golden Rock King and Tianying King, they were still far away from this sinkhole.

“Jian Wushuang, why don’t you continue to escape?” Red Snow King said while looking coldly at Jian Wushuang.

“I’m running out of Spiritual Power, and I’m chased by Red Snow King, the strongest king of the Jin Kingdom. I can’t escape from you even though I wish I could do that,” replied Jian Wushuang, smilingly.
