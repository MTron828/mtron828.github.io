Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

His cold words reverberated thoughout the sky over the Heartless Island, catching the experts on the Heartless Island by surprise.

Today was the day Blood Feather Tower would be destroyed!

“With such a small group? How dare you say that! It’s ridiculous.” Qi Luosheng sneered, followed by several whoosh sounds. A large number of figures suddenly glided close and then landed near the center of the island.

These figures all wore a black robe and a purple mask. It was a group headed by the Left and Right Messengers from Blood Feather Tower. At a glance, the number was roughly 100.

“So many people?”

“They are all purple-masked assassins. They are all experts in the Yin-Yang Void Realm!”

“Is this the true strength of Blood Feather Tower?”

Seeing such a battle formation, the experts from the various sects were all shocked.

Anyone in the Yin-Yang Void Realm could definitely be considered a top expert in the Tianzong Dynasty. Some top sects of the Tianzong Dynasty only had a few of these experts at most. However, at the very beginning of this battle, Blood Feather Tower already dispatched about 100.

Even though most of these purple-masked assassins were only at the Yin Void Realm, the number of Yang Void Realm experts was still more than 10.

It was a fierce and magnificent battle formation.

Wang Yuan glanced at Jian Wushuang and then said, with a serious tone, “We can handle these people.”

“OK.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“None of you guys will leave here today,” Qi Luosheng said coldly. He slightly lifted his palm and immediately signaled for the battle to begin.

The instant he lowered his hand, the purple-masked assassins immediately took action. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Go!” As soon as Wang Yuan snarled, all the experts from the Alchemy School, Ice Nether Valley, and Dragon Palace violently rushed forward as well. At this moment, Wang Yuan stepped forward as well.

In only an instant, the two groups had already engaged themselves in battle on the Heartless Island.

The battle began in an instance.

Rumble...

As soon as the experts collided, several horrible roars were instantly heard. Along with those sounds, violent Spiritual Power was crazily sweeping in every direction, leading Heartless Island toward its own destruction.

“Run, run!”

“Get out of here right away. Hurry, before you get caught up in it!”

“Hurry, leave Heartless Island.”

At this moment, the experts from the various sects were rushing to leave the island one after another because none of them wanted to be involved in the battle. They halted once they made it to the island’s exterior, but their eyes were still fixated on the battlefield.

In terms of quantity, Blood Feather Tower had more experts than Jian Wushuang.

But in terms of the strength, Jian Wushuang’s side was much stronger.

Among the experts of the Alchemy School and Ice Nether Valley, more than 15 were at the Yang Void Realm. The remaining were all at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm.

As for Dragon Palace, although there were only six experts, three were in the Yang Void Realm, including Palace Master White, while the rest were at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm.

In other words, among the experts on Jian Wushuang’s side, the weakest ones were at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm.

However, on the Blood Feather Tower’s side, even though they had a great number of experts, most were somewhere between the Initial Yin Void Realm and the Profound Yin Void Realm. Their number of experts who achieved the Peak of the Yin Void Realm or the Yang Void Realm was less than Jian Wushuang’s side.

Because of this, the overall strength of both sides was very close, so it was extremely fierce as soon as the battle began. The experts on both sides were furiously fighting, and it was hard to tell which side had the upper hand.

Even though the battle was off to a violent start, Jian Wushuang had not moved a single step.

Not just him, Qi Luosheng had not moved either. He was just standing there on the raised platform.

Jian Wushuang glanced at the battlefield in the front of him, then turned and looked toward his father, Jian Nantian.

Currently, Jian Nantian was lying on the ground and drinking wine alone. His eyelids didn’t even flicker until he noticed Jian Wushuang looking at him. Then he gave Jian Wushuang a glance as well.

They looked at each other, without needing to say any words.

A second later, Jian Wushuang finally began to move. He took one step after another, walking directly towards Jian Nantian.

However, when he was about to take his third step, he was stopped by a whizzing sound?and three figures suddenly appeared in front of him.

“Huh?” After looking at the three figures that suddenly appeared, Jian Wushuang halted and the expression on his face darkened.

The three were not assassins from Blood Feather Tower, but he knew one of them.

“Mo Lingtian.” Jian Wushuang coldly stared at the vicious-eyed man, who was carrying a longsword on his back and seemed to be the leader.

The Law-enforcement Elder of the Wilderness Sword Sect, Mo Lingtian.

Jian Wushuang previously met Mo Lingtian during the Easternmost Hunt. At that time, Mo Lingtian lent his hand to Blood Feather Tower against him. Without Wang Yuan’s support at that time, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t have survived Mo Lingtian’s attack.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Mo Lingtian had a slight sneer on his face as he blocked Jian Wushuang’s path. There were two people following behind him, one was a man and the other was a lady. Both of them carried a sharp sword on their back. Furthermore, their aura was no weaker than Mo Lingtian’s.

The peak of the Yang Void Realm!

Needless to say, the two behind Mo Lingtian were experts at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm. So the three in front of Jian Wushuang were all at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm!

“Wilderness Sword Sect! They are from the Wilderness Sword Sect!”

“The Wilderness Sword Sect is one of the top eight Sects in the Nanyang Continent. Why are they entangling themselves in Blood Feather Tower’s matters?”

“It is already very difficult to deal with Blood Feather Tower. Now, unexpectedly, the Wilderness Sword Sect has joined in as well.”

The experts who were watching the battle from outside of the Heartless Island already recognized Mo Lingtian and his comrades. Everybody started to feel sad for Jian Wushuang.

No matter what, the Wilderness Sword Sect was one of the top eight Sects in the Nanyang Continent.

“Jian Wushuang, we meet again,” Mo Lingtian said while staring at Jian Wushuang coldly.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang slightly nodded and said, “I said it during the Easternmost Hunt, there will be ample time for us to meet again. But I didn’t expect it to happen so quickly. However, since you are already here, let’s put an end to our animosities today.”

“It’s time to finish it. But it will be me who finishes you,” Mo Lingtian said. In no time his eyes turned cold.

Shua!

Suddenly, the space in front of Jian Wushuang was cut, after which Mo Lingtian appeared, holding a sharp longsword in his hand. At this moment, his longsword was already slashing out at an amazing speed, like a bolt of lightning.

However, Jian Wushuang just stood there as if nothing had happened, not making a single move.

“Go to hell!” Mo Lingtian yelled and grinned, his eyes turning even icier.

The longsword directly passed through Jian Wushuang’s neck, but there wasn’t a single drop of blood.

“Huh?” Mo Lingtian was stunned because he had perceived that his sword did not touch anything.

It was a Residual shadow; the object that this longsword just passed through was not Jian Wushuang, just his residual shadow.

“You want to kill me?”

An extremely cold voice suddenly came from Mo Lingtian’s side.

“What?” Mo Lingtian was shocked and looked to the side, where a figure who he didn’t expect to see had appeared. What’s more, a tremendous killing intent was radiating from this figure and focusing on him.

“Do you think trash like you can kill me?”

No sooner had Jian Wushuang spoke, than he threw out a slap.

The palm, filled with Slaughter Origin, directly moved towards Mo Lingtian’s face.
