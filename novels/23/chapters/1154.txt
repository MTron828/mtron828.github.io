Chapter 1155: The Odd Thing

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“The four kings of the Jin Kingdom, including Red Snow King, entered the Chillywind Valley personally, but they didn’t kill you and lost Heaven Shadow King instead. What’s worse, Red Snow King is probably dead. The Jin Kingdom has paid a double penalty this time!” Void Temple Master laughed.

Had they sustained too many losses?

The Jin Kingdom had indeed suffered great losses this time.

They had paid a great price but failed to kill Jian Wushuang, who was a potential threat to them. It was so terrible.

Jian Wushuang was still alive. He only lost his first Original Body and some treasures, which had a marginal effect on him.

“The Jin Kingdom has paid such a great price but didn’t kill Jian Wushuang. If they find out about it, they will become wild with anger.” Samsara Temple Master snorted.

“Jian Wushuang is dead.” Tang Emperor said suddenly.

“What?” The four other Palace Masters and Jian Wushuang immediately turned to look at Tang Emperor.

“The reason why the people of the Jin Kingdom are eager to kill Jian Wushuang is that they are afraid that he has the potential to be the leader of our Green Fire Palace and reach a higher level in the future. Now that Jian Wushuang’s first Original Body has died, they must think that Jian Wushuang has really died, which is a good thing for us.” Tang Emperor explained.

“Do you mean that we will hide Jian Wushuang?” Sunrise Sword Emperor raised his eyebrows and asked.

“Yes, we will hide him. To be precise, we need to keep the secret that Jian Wushuang is still alive. Otherwise, they will find other ways to assassinate him and secretly observe Jian Wushuang in the future. If necessary, they will even fight a decisive battle with us preemptively until both sides are dead.” Tang Emperor said seriously.

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang and the four Palace Masters wore grave expressions.

In terms of their battle formation, the Jin Kingdom was very eager to kill Jian Wushuang.

If they knew that Jian Wushuang was still alive, they were sure to find another way to assassinate him.

“The Jin Kingdom thinks that Jian Wushuang is dead now, so we should ask Jian Wushuang to hide while he becomes stronger so that he can be a powerful weapon of the Green Fire Palace in the future. At the crucial moment, he is likely to play an incredible role.” Tang Emperor continued.

“You’re right.”

“I agree with you.”

“The trump card is always hidden in a secret place. Jian Wushuang is qualified to be our trump card.”

After some hesitation, the four other Palace Masters nodded, showing that they all agreed with Tang Emperor.

“What do you think?” Tang emperor looked at Jian Wushuang.

“As long as it is for the benefit of the Green Fire Palace, I agree.” Jian Wushuang laughed. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Well, you shouldn’t show up on the battlefield later, and shouldn’t make contact with the Celestial Masters of the Green Fire Palace. We, Palace Masters, will announce your death, and only the five of us will know that you are still alive.” Tang Emperor continued.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

Jian Wushuang didn’t care about whether he could still make contact with the Celestial Masters. On the other hand, it was a pity that he couldn’t appear on the battlefield, but he could also accept it.

“Since I am not allowed to go to the battlefield, I will return to the Green Fire World because I have something private to deal with in that place.” Jian Wushuang said.

“You can go to the Green Fire World, but remember to keep a low profile. If you need to fight with others, you should hide your identity. If you get into trouble and can’t act personally, you should send a message to Samsara Temple Master and Void Temple Master, and then they will help you solve your problem in the Void Continent or Samsara Continent.” Tang Emperor said.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang laughed.

He knew that some spies from the Jin Kingdom were hiding in the Green Fire World, so he was supposed to keep a low profile. Otherwise, he would probably betray himself.

Tang Emperor paused for a moment and then spoke again. “There is another thing.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang and the four other Palace Masters all stared at him.

“I feel something strange about the assassination attempt of the Jin Kingdom.” Tang Emperor said seriously.

“Something strange?” Jian Wushuang was a little confused.

“You said that you fell into the trap of the three kings of Jin Kingdom, but you should remember that the battlefield is huge. How did they know that you fly around the mountains alone? Did they set a trap and wait for you?” Tang Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang as he asked.

Hearing these words, Jian Wushuang and the other people felt very confused.

Jian Wushuang frowned. He also felt that something was wrong, but he had no time to think about it before.

“Jian Wushuang, did you meet some experts from the Jin Kingdom when you flew near the Chillywind Valley?” Samsara Temple Master looked at him.

“No.” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

He only met the four kings in the battlefield but never met an expert from the Jin Kingdom throughout.

“Could some experts from the Jin Kingdom have approached you, but you didn’t notice them?” Samsara Temple Master asked.

“That’s impossible.” Jian Wushuang shook his head again and spoke with confidence.

He was very sure that no experts of the Jin Kingdom had approached him.

Otherwise, he would have found them out early on.

After he became a Dao Master, he lit the Fire of Soul and possessed Strength of Soul. If he exercised the Strength of Soul, he would be able to discover even a Universe Master who was hiding near him. Therefore, it was impossible for those experts to approach him secretly.

“You said that you didn’t meet any experts from the Jin Kingdom, but they knew your location and set a trap ahead of time. There are only two possible reasons they were able to do this!” Samsara Temple Master said in a low voice.

“First, an expert of the Jin Kingdom probably left a special mark on your body during the battle of Dan Xin Palace so that they could pinpoint your location.”

“That’s impossible,” Sunrise Sword Emperor suddenly said. “I saw Jian Wushuang outside the Dan Xin Palace, and then took him to the World of Swords. If there was a special mark on his body, I would have noticed it.”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Gu King, who had a high vision and strong psychic ability, had stayed in that Original Body. He would have told Jian Wushuang if there was a mark in his Body.

“There is the other possibility: Some spies or renegades are hiding in the Green Fire Palace and they told the Jin Kingdom Jian Wushuang’s location.” Samsara Temple Master said coldly.

“Spies or renegades?”

Hearing this, the other four kings became very serious.
