Chapter 1485: Challenging The Star Tower Again

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The secret skill of the Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor indeed required a very high level of the Reincarnation Doctrine.

Just the beginner level alone would require the power to clear the first level of the Doctrine Palace.

However, Jian Wushuang had an extremely high level of comprehension of the Reincarnation Doctrine. During the four thousand years in the Sky Sword Prison, he had been studying the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation intensively. As a result, he had completely understood the first three paintings of the Painting of Understanding Sword via Reincarnation. Hence, he possessed the power to clear the first level of the Doctrine Palace.

In just a short while, Jian Wushuang managed to get the hang of the secret skill.

Within the secret room, Jian Wushuang continued to sit with his legs crossed. However, he had already fully activated the secret skill of the Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor.

“Gosh, this power…”

Jian Wushuang clenched both his fists tightly and felt the enormous amount of power in his hands.

It was the full release of his Divine Power. However, after he had activated his blood and the secret skill of the Reincarnation Armor, his Divine Power increased greatly compared to the past!

“As of now, my Divine Power is unable to rival that of a Real God. However, the distance between us is no longer as huge as before,” Jian Wushuang sighed.

The difference in Divine Power between a Real God and Universe God was extremely great.

Previously, in the Sky Prison Tower, it was because of the fact that the Real Gods’ Divine Power was restricted that Jian Wushang could kill them.

If not for the restriction, he could only fight with the weakest of the Real Gods.

However, at that very moment… With the secret skill of the Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor, the difference in Divine Power between him and the Real Gods had been reduced greatly.

“Not only does this Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor increase my defense greatly, it has also caused my abilities as a whole to skyrocket,” Jian Wushuang chuckled and he was elated.

After getting the hang of the secret skill, Jian Wushuang walked out of the secret room.

Next, he walked toward the Star Tower.

The Star Tower was one of the three training grounds of the Lineage of Star and Jian Wushuang had only cleared its first level.

Within the second level of the Star Tower.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang summoned nine shadows and unleashed his Sword Principles. He was extremely swift and fierce.

The long-bearded, strict middle-aged man who fought with him also swung his longsword and clashed with Jian Wushuang’s attacks continuously.

However, it was obvious that Jian Wushuang’s Sword Principles were faster and fiercer. Their power was also a lot greater.

“Go down!”

Jian Wushuang gave a shout and a sword light struck the body of the strict middle-aged man like lightning and caused him to retreat.

The second level was cleared.

As for the third level… The third level was a lot more difficult than the second level. By relying on his own Sword Principles and his close combat abilities, he was not the stern middle-aged man’s opponent. In the end, Jian Wushuang had no choice but to use the Reincarnation Doctrine that he had learnt.

By adding Reincarnation Power to the Sword Principles, their power rose sharply and he cleared the third level straight away.

After clearing the third level, Jian Wushuang did not continue. Instead, he left.

“I have already learnt three of the four secret skills of the Lineage of Star. For these three secret skills, the Secret Skills of Star Palace could be learnt when one becomes a disciple of the Star Palace. As for Xuan Mie Golden Body, I only managed to learn it after I cleared the nineteenth level of the Illusionary Mind Sea. However, I am still unable to explain the origin of the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood.”

“But now… I have cleared the third level of the Star Tower. Hence, I am able to learn another secret skill. Thus, it is logical that I am able to learn the Secret Skill of Dragon Blood.”

As Jian Wushuang walked across the tall buildings alone, he wore an indifferent smile.

“Senior Wushuang!”

“Greetings, Senior.”

During his walk, the disciples of the Lineage of Star, who Jian Wushuang had met, all greeted him modestly.

As for some of the disciples, they were talking in whispers.

“Senior Wushuang demonstrated his extraordinary skills in the previous battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace and he is almost on par with Ling Feibai. Later on, he went out to the outside world alone for training and this journey alone was for over four thousand years. It is only until when the next battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace is about to reopen again that he finally returned.”

“Say, do you think Senior Wushuang will be able to retain his position as a disciple of the Star Palace in the battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace this time round?”

“No idea.”

“This is hard to say. If Senior Wushuang remains a Universe God of the Second Heaven, then there will be no problem. However, at that moment, he and the equally famous Ling Feibai back then will have both become Universe Gods of the Third Heaven. The battle between the Star Palace disciples who were Universe Gods of the Third Heaven will be more intense.”

“However, Senior Wushuang is extremely talented. Even if he were to be reduced to a normal disciple in the battle this time round, by waiting for another five thousand years for the next battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace, he would definitely be able to climb up the ranks.”

“That is true.”

…

“Jian Wushuang,” a voice could be heard.

Jian Wushuang stopped walking and turned his head. When he saw the person walking over, he wore a smile.

“Long time no see, Ling Feibai,” Jian Wushuang laughed happily.

“It is because of the fact that you keep on immersing yourself in training in the outside world,” the elegant and smart youth Ling Feibai came to the front of Jian Wushuang.

Ling Feibai was one of the top geniuses of the Lineage of Star.

During the previous battle between the geniuses of the Star Palace disciples, at the Universe God of the Second Heaven’s level, Ling Feibai could be said to be unrivalled.

Even Jian Wushuang had lost to Ling Feibai in that battle.

After over four thousand years, Ling Feibai had already passed the God’s Test for the Third Heaven and become a Universe God of the Third Heaven.

“Just a while more and the battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace that occurs once every five thousand years will begin again. Do you have confidence this time round?” Ling Feibai looked toward Jian Wushuang.

“The battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Back then, when he had first come to the Star Palace, he had paid close attention to the battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace.

After all, if he were unable to keep himself within the top five, he would be reduced to a normal disciple. In the Lineage of Star, the difference in treatment between a normal disciple and a Star Palace disciple was extremely huge.

However, at that moment, Jian Wushuang was no longer that interested in the battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace.

“Looking at the time, the battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace is indeed about to begin soon,” Jian Wushuang chuckled and spoke again immediately, “I am quite confident. How about you?” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“I have no confidence at all,” Ling Feibai shook his head and forced a smile: “Jian Wushuang, ever since you made a breakthrough to the Universe God of the Third Heaven, you have been living in the outside world. Hence, you have never fought with the disciples who are Universe Gods of the Third Heaven before. As such, there are some things that you do not know.”

“Give me an example,” Jian Wushuang spoke with interest.

“Then I shall tell you. Within the Universe God disciples of the three levels of the Lineage of Star, the number of disciples who are Universe Gods of the Third Heaven is the greatest,” Ling Feibai said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and he understood quickly.

All the disciples in the Lineage of Star were real geniuses and a normal God’s Tests were unable to stop them. Hence, those disciples would usually not stay at the same level for long as they would be able make a breakthrough. They would make a breakthrough from Universe God of the First Heaven to the Second Heaven, and then, from the Second Heaven to the Third Heaven.

However, after reaching Universe God of the Third Heaven…
