Chapter 2820: Saint Ascension Elixir

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

“What’s the chance?” Jian Wushuang immediately asked.

“10%,” Elder Gu said, “Of course, for those ordinary Divine Masters who are unprepared, they still have a 10% chance of breaking through to the Immortal Saint-level after taking the Saint Ascension Elixir. But for those powerful Divine Masters who are well prepared and have great potential, there’s at least a 30% chance of breaking through to the Immortal Saint-level after taking the Saint Ascension Elixir.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was even more shocked.

Without any preparation, there was a 10% chance of a breakthrough.

With sufficient preparation, there was a 30% chance of a breakthrough?

A 30% chance!

After all, the aurous core of the royal realm could make a Senior Great Divine Master breakthrough to be a Peak Great Divine Master, which was also very small. Even so, it was enough to make many Great Divine Masters fight for it and even kill each other.

For example, Elder Tong and Ba Xiong, who had been killed by Jian Wushuang, had directly broken through to be a Peak Great Divine Master by taking a gold core of the royal realm.

A gold core of the royal realm was worth at least 100 times or even 1,000 times more than just normal cultivation. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Jian Wushuang had no doubt that once the news of the gold core of the royal realm spread, the entire Pill Sun Sacred World and even the entire Golden Crow Nine Realms would be shocked.

Countless Great Divine Masters and top experts would fight for the elixir at all costs.

Even an Invincible Divine Master like the Marquis of Three Yin would not be able to resist the temptation of the elixir, let alone a Peak Great Divine Master.

After all, it was too difficult for an ordinary Peak Great Divine Master to break through to become an Immortal Saint.

Take the Pill Sun Sacred World as an example. The vast sacred world had an incomparably vast territory, but after so many years, the Pill Sun Sacred World had given birth to an undying sage, and that was the Crimson Rock Sage.

However, there were quite a few experts at the great deity level in the Pill Sun Sacred World. There were even some Peak Great Deity level experts, but they were unable to truly breakthrough to become an undying sage, however, it was difficult to break through to become an undying sage.

And once an elixir with a 30% chance of breaking through was placed in front of these Great Divine Masters, it would be strange if these Great Divine Masters did not go crazy.

“Su Han, your talent is extremely high. Although you haven’t reached the Peak Great Divine Master level yet, you’ll reach it sooner or later. At that time, you’ll probably encounter a bottleneck. Even if you can breakthrough, it’ll definitely take a long time. And this sacred elixir will help you when the time comes.”

“With your talent and skills, as long as you’ve accumulated enough divine power, you’ll have at least a 50% chance of becoming an Immortal Saint with the help of the elixir.” Elder Gu smiled.

“I can give you the pill now, but you have to agree to one condition.”

“What condition?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s simple. I want you to agree to it. To be exact, I want you to swear that if you break through to the Immortal Saint level, you will come to the secret realm and try your best to accept the test left by the master and get the mantle left by the master. How about that?” Elder Gu said.

“That’s the condition?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He had thought that Elder Gu would make such a harsh condition, but it turned out that he just wanted him to try his best to accept the test left by the master of the secret realm.

In fact, even if Elder Gu did not say anything, Jian Wushuang would definitely come back to the secret realm after he broke through to become an Immortal Saint.

After all, this secret realm was left by a powerful rule master and contained endless opportunities. Jian Wushuang also had a certain yearning for opportunities in this secret realm.

“I agree to this condition. I can swear it now...”

Jian Wushuang made an oath right in front of Elder Gu.

Of course, this oath was not very binding for Jian Wushuang. Even if he broke it later, there would be no harm.

However, given Jian Wushuang’s character, since he made an oath, he would definitely do his best to fulfill it.

Seeing Jian Wushuang make an oath, Elder Gu could not help but smile. Then he waved his hand and handed the Saint Ascension Elixir directly to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang carefully put the Saint Ascension Elixir into his interspatial ring, but he was delighted.

Elder Gu was wrong. The Saint Ascension Elixir had some effect on Jian Wushuang, but it was not very useful.

He had no choice. He was a perfect chaotic creature, and every breakthrough in his realm was different from ordinary people.

For other Great Divine Masters, the gold core of the royal realm was the best elixir for breaking through their own realm, but it was of little use to Jian Wushuang.

That was why he had not swallowed any of the five royal gold cores he had obtained in the secret realm. Instead, he had used them to recruit experts.

If the royal gold core was like that, then the Saint Ascension Elixir was the same.

Jian Wushuang knew very well that even if he successfully reached the level of a Peak Great Divine Master and his divine power had reached the peak, he would not be able to break through with just a Saint Ascension Elixir.

The Saint Ascension Elixir could at most help him or promote him.

However, Jian Wushuang was still quite happy.

After all, he did not need the Saint Ascension Elixir, but others could.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang already had a suitable candidate in his heart. It was Yin Su’er!

“I promised Saint Crimson Rock that I would try my best to help Yin Su’er break through her realm and make her an Immortal Saint, but it’s easier said than done. I can’t really help her, but now... I’m giving her the Saint Ascension Elixir, which is the best way to help her. As for whether she can make a breakthrough to become an Immortal Saint, it depends on her own luck,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

“Thank you, Elder Gu.”

Jian Wushuang thanked Elder Gu, then he refined the corpse puppets one by one, put them into his interspatial ring, and left the secret realm with the corpse puppet army.

The second time he entered the secret realm, Jian Wushuang had gained a lot.

He had obtained the corpse puppet army, a Saint Ascension Elixir, and his soul power had also been tempered.

“With the corpse puppet army and the combined power of the Pill Sun Sacred World, I should be able to fight the Heavenly Void Army head-on and even gain the upper hand. Moreover, with the existence of the blood-armored corpse puppet, I’m not afraid of the Marquis of Three Yin. However... my own strength is still inferior.”

“Since the Heavenly Void Army hasn’t arrived yet, I have to improve my strength as much as possible.”

Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

There were only two ways for him to improve his strength.
