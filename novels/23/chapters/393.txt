Chapter 394: Bluestone Corridor

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“It’s strange.”

Jian Wushuang was inwardly shocked as the aquamarine long whip twisted around his arm like a vine. He recovered quickly and a surge of soaring Sword Essence erupted from him, his hands shook and threw off the long whip.

Swish!

Jian Wushuang drew his longsword and dashed forward.

The lady with long aquamarine hair wielded her long whip casually. Shadows cast by the whip changed into waves, surging forward.

Jian Wushuang felt as if he was falling into a vast sea. The continual lashing waves made it hard for him to free himself and suppressed his strength.

“The woman comprehends Waterdrop Origin so well.”

While he was struggling, Jian Wushuang noticed two Origin Marks on the lady’s arms.

These marks meant that she was at the Peak of Stage Two.

Jian Wushuang assessed the current situation.

General Qing’s army was led by six commanders.

On the other hand, the Silver-winged Army led by Wu Ta had seven commanders.

These commanders were at Stage Two, so one more person could give them an advantage if both sides were matched in terms of skill.

It was therefore unsurprising that the Silver-winged Army already had the upper hand.

“I must do something.” Jian Wushuang radiated an overwhelming Sword Essence. Invisible waves began to spread out and covered the entire battlefield.

Sword Realm, Tenfold Realm!

Slaughter Domain also started to sweep out.

The two skills were combined into a deadly attack.

“What?”

The experts of the Silver-winged Army felt themselves enveloped by a flow of invisible power. It was as though they were stuck in mud with their movements restricted.

“Realm Technique?”

“How powerful!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Silver-winged Army experts were astounded and rendered helpless by the attack. On the other hand, the Iron Saber Army commanders remained unaffected.

This caused some excitement among the commanders.

“Haha, Swordsman, good job!”

“Swordsman, I love you.”

Lei Dao and Yao Mei cried out.

General Qing glanced at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“Hmph!” Jian Wushuang snorted.

He resumed his fight with the lady with long aquamarine hair. As she was now suppressed by the Tenfold Realm, she could no longer restrict Jian Wushuang’s movements.

Because of the Tenfold Realm, the strength gap between the both sides narrowed.

Now the Iron Saber Army almost drew even with their opponent.

Wu Ta’s face fell. “I didn’t expect that someone from the Iron Saber Army would have such an odd technique.”

The Realm Sword Skill or Technique was rare in the vast Divine Land.

It was also a cause of much envy.

Wu Ta knew it was impossible to defeat the Iron Saber Army and decided to withdraw from the fight.

“Leave them alone. Let’s go inside.”

Wu Ta repelled General Qing and shouted to his commanders. He rushed into the cave mansion.

The Silver-winged Army commanders followed him inside.

“Hurry up! Let’s follow them.”

Jian Wushuang and the other commanders responded to General Qing’s orders and darted into the cave mansion.

The bottomless broad Bluestone Corridor came into sight.

Candle-holders shaped like dragon heads were placed along both sides of the corridor. Instead of candles, the open mouths of the dragon heads held transparent gems which lit the path.

“This is a cave mansion? Why do I feel that I’m in a huge underground palace?”?Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Jian Wushuang and the others moved forward quickly. The Iron Saber Army and Silver-winged Army were separated by a short distance, with the former on the left side and the latter on the right side. Both armies remained vigilant but they did not intend to fight.

“The corridor is too long.”?Jian Wushuang frowned at the bottomless corridor.

They had walked for several thousand meters, but still could not see the end of the corridor.

But at this moment… Chi!

A faint sound rang out. Jian Wushuang looked at the candle-holders along the corridor and saw a sliver of light.

“Be careful!”

The words had barely left General Qing when...

Chuu! Chuu! Chuu! Chuu!

A forlorn sound of breaking wind sounded. A black Flowing Light passed through the air and swept towards them, accompanied by streaks of black Flowing Light shooting from the candlesticks.

The Flowing Light moved quickly with an overwhelming and frightening momentum.

Jian Wushuang reacted first. He struck with his Lonely Heart Sword and parried three streaks of black Flowing Light. These landed on the ground and showed themselves to be three black arrows made of special materials.

The other commanders were also attacked by the black arrows. Shi Ling, who stood behind Jian Wushuang, was targeted by six arrows.

“Damn!”

Shi Ling paled at the onslaught. He tried to block the six arrows using his Giant Axe. His weapon was powerful, but less flexible than longswords or sabers.

He was only able to deflect four arrows. The other two arrows continued their journey toward his chest and lower abdomen.

At the critical moment, Jian Wushuang stepped forward and blocked Shi Ling.

He deflected the arrow targeting Shi Ling’s lower abdomen, but he had no time to parry the other.

The black arrow swiftly crashed into Jian Wushuang’s chest.
