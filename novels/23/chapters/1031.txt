Chapter 1032: Ancient Monster Clan & Dao Master Nine Sword!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Jiu Xiu!”

Jian Wushuang could feel his heart brimming with killing intent upon thinking about the name. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

It was him who had kidnapped his mother and snatched his father’s Sword Soul in the Ancient World previously. The fiend had even destroyed the Ji Clan personally.

Jian Wushuang had seen Jiu Xiu before. Of course, at that time, the latter was only a wisp of consciousness that had possessed a Puppet Fighter.

After the incident, Jian Wushuang and his father climbed their way to the summit of the Ancient World, but neither of them knew that Jiu Xiu had brought Jian Wushuang’s mother back to the Ancient World long ago.

His father, Jian Nantian, had decided to make the irreversible decision to become a Reincarnator once he knew about it.

As such, if it were not for Jiu Xiu, many things would not have happened.

Jian Wushuang felt an unprecedented hatred toward Jiu Xiu.

Now, after 2,000 years, he finally got to meet Jiu Xiu again.

“It’s him, everything happened because of him!”?Jian Wushuang thought, his gaze turning icy cold.

“If it weren’t for him, my father would never have taken the risk of becoming a Reincarnator and he would have been reunited with my mother a long time ago. They would not have been separated for so long until now.

“There’s also the issue of the Ji Clan!

“They were exterminated because of Jiu Xiu’s doing!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists tightly.

He wished he could torture Jiu Xiu slowly, but his enemy’s current status amazed him.

Not only did Jiu Xiu have the power of a Rank Three Dao Master, but he also had a huge standing in the Ancient Monster Clan. He had two Peak Rank Three experts serving as his guards; it was a privilege few in the Ancient Monster Clan enjoyed.

“Ancient Monster Clan…”

Jian Wushuang finished reading his research material. He now had a certain knowledge of the clan.

Not only was the Ancient Monster Clan one of the top clans, but it was also arguably the strongest clan out of the four top clans. Their people even had two types of bloodlines.

The first bloodline was that of the Ancient Gods!

As for the second, it was that of the Heavenly Monsters.

“The Ancient Monster Clan is extraordinary,” Gu King’s voice rang in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“Needless to say the Ancient Gods were at the apex of the Eternal Chaotic World and their bloodline was extremely precious and dominant. As for the Heavenly Demons, they were also extremely famous, and even though they were somewhat weaker than the Ancient Gods, the difference between both lineages was not too great.”

“It was extremely rare to have any one of these two bloodlines, so it’s very strange for the Ancient Monster Clan to possess both.”

Jian Wushuang’s expression was extremely serious as he listened.

He had been mired in doubt as to how he came to possess the bloodline of the Ancient Gods, but everything was clear to him now.

“Perhaps, my mother is from the Ancient Monster Clan,” Jian Wushuang thought.

The combined might of the Ancient Monster Clan was extremely great because of the fact that it possessed the two great bloodlines. There were already three Celestial Masters and countless strong Dao Masters within the clan. It possessed so much strength that even the Samsara Temple dared not take it lightly.

As for Jiu Xiu, the Dao Master Nine Sword, he seemed to have been treated by the clan as a precious treasure because he had awoken an extremely rare bloodline.

“That said, if my mother was really from the Ancient Monster Clan, why would she go to the Ancient World? And that Jiu Xiu…” said Jian Wushuang as he frowned.

“To that, Jian Wushuang, I might know of a possibility,” replied Gu King.

“What possibility?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“Reincarnation!” Gu King replied, his tone solemn.

“What?” Jian Wushuang exclaimed as his eyes opened wide.

“Reincarnation?” he thought.

“What reincarnation is he referring to?

“Could it be that kind that means one gets reborn into the world after death?”

“In the Eternal Chaotic World, one could get reborn and get a chance to cultivate again. If your mother really awoke the Heavenly Monster bloodline, there’s a high possibility that reincarnation was involved,” said Gu King.

Jian Wushuang winced as he heard the words of Gu King; he was experiencing huge emotional upheaval.

Reincarnation…

It was the first time he had heard the term, and it made him feel extremely alarmed.

That said, aside from his alarm, he came to understand many more things.

“I understand now, I understand everything now!”

Jian Wushuang let out a stream of air lightly. He began to understand that many of his deductions were true.

“It’s a pity that even though this material is extremely detailed, it did not mention anything about my mother,” Jian Wushuang said, shaking his head as he held the documents.

Now that he had discovered the whereabouts of Jiu Xiu, he wanted to find an opportunity to kill him, but the more pressing matter was to find out where his mother was.

“To find out where my mother is currently, I have to act from Jiu Xiu,” Jian Wushuang proclaimed, a murderous gaze in his eyes.

“What are you planning to do, Jian Wushuang?” Gu King’s voice rang out again. “Don’t forget, there are two Dao Masters at the Peak of Rank Three by his side. You have basically not much hope of making a move against Jiu Xiu under their watchful eyes.”

“I know that,” Jian Wushuang replied as he nodded slightly. He understood that it would not be easy to get to Jiu Xiu.

After all, he did not merely wish to defeat or even kill Jiu Xiu; he wanted to capture his enemy alive or subdue him so that he could interrogate him.

“Capturing him alive… will be much harder than defeating or killing him outright.

“Putting the interference from the two Dao Masters aside, I don’t even have much confidence of subduing Jiu Xiu in a head-on contest.

“Furthermore, Empyrean Patriarch has placed a bounty of 20 Chaos Gems on my head. If I were to remain in hiding, no one would be able to identify me, but if I move against Jiu Xiu, my identity will be exposed and there will be even more trouble when Empyrean Patriarch comes chasing after me.”?he thought.

“Even though the path ahead is fraught with obstacles, it’s the only way if I want to find out where my mother is!” exclaimed Jian Wushuang in a low tone.

From the research material, Jian Wushuang gathered that Jiu Xiu could normally be found in the den of the Ancient Monster Clan; he seldom showed himself and ventured out even less often.

This time, he was making a rare trip away from home and would return to the Ancient Monster Clan after he was done dealing his affairs. If Jian Wushuang missed this chance, it would be much harder for him to harm Jiu Xiu again.

“I don’t know how long I’ll have to wait for another chance. Therefore, I have to give it a shot no matter how hard or risky it’ll be,” said Jian Wushuang, a resolute gaze in his eyes. Evidently, he had already made up his mind.

“Since you’ve already decided, I shall not stop you. Before you strike, however, you should plan in detail. You shouldn’t act unless you’re sure, but once you do, make sure you hit your target. Also, your plan should also allow you to retreat in one piece,” suggested Gu King solemnly.

“I understand,” nodded Jian Wushuang. “There are two Dao Masters at Peak Rank Three with Jiu Xiu, and there’s not much chance of success if I act alone. I can, however, get more help.”

“Even though no one in the Samsara Continent will offend the Ancient Monster Clan simply, if I offer a huge reward, some people will be willing to help me.”

“Take for instance… Blood Saber!”
