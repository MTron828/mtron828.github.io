Chapter 1264: Universe God?

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Lin Dong, Mo You, step back!” Jian Wushuang shouted hurriedly.

“Why?”

Lin Dong and Mo You were startled, but they still subconsciously drew a few steps backward.

Just as the three drew back, a black flowing light flashed where the three had just stood. The light was so powerful that perhaps Jian Wushuang could protect himself with his Blood-killing Armor, but if Lin Dong and Mo You got hit by it, they would definitely be killed.

Swish!

A black figure appeared where the three had just stood.

It was a black-robed elder with a rolling aura, radiating a faint Divine Power. The elder had cold eyes.

“He is a Universe God?” Lin Dong and Mo You were both shocked.

Universe Gods were those who had experienced a God Test to become a god. They were top experts.

Jian Wushuang and the other two generals were Invincible Universe Masters with unparalleled battle strength in their realm, but they were no match for a Universe God.

“How could it be possible?”

“Haven’t all the Universe Gods in the Red Water Alliance been killed? Why there is another one?”

As two powerful Divine Generals, Lin Dong and Mo You, however, looked horrified at that moment.

Gu Nan, standing behind the elder, smirked while speaking, “Elder Li, kill them three.”

“Be assured, Young Master. None of them can escape from me today.”

As the elder’s chilling voice fell, a Divine Power started running inside his body. He neared Jian Wushuang and the two generals through the void like a black flowing light. The black scimitar in his hand gleamed with a terrifying light.

“Run!”

“Quick, run!”

Lin Dong and Mo You headed away running without thinking.

They had become the Divine Generals for so long that they had seen many battles between Universe Gods and therefore knew very well how powerful the Universe Gods were. They were no match for the elder even if they joined their hands.

“Run!” “Run!” “Run!”

Lin Dong and Mo You started running desperately, and at the same time, they also noticed that Jian Wushuang remained standing where he was.

“Jian Wushuang, what are you doing? Run quickly!” Mo You shouted at him.

“Jian Wushuang, are you insane?” Lin Dong also yelled at him anxiously.

When they saw that Jian Wushuang remained indifferent towards their warns, Lin Dong could not help but shake his head. “Alas, he is too shallow, too proud, and too confident. That elder is a Universe God. Does he think that he can battle a Universe God?”

“He has just arrived here without encountering any Universe God before. He knows nothing about their power.” Mo You also sighed.

“Alright, we have already reminded him, but since he is courting death himself, we are not the one that he should blame. We can’t even protect ourselves now, let alone to save him.”

Lin Dong and Mo You kept running madly to the outside of the city.

As for Jian Wushuang, they were incapable of helping him. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

They did not know that when Jian Wushuang saw that Universe God, he was not surprised or afraid but excited.

“Universe God!”

He looked at the elder with frenzied eyes.

He had only battled two Universe Gods yet—Universe God Chen and the monarch of the Jin Kingdom. He had fought with the former in a very friendly way, practicing his swordsmanship. Therefore, he actually battled only the later. Now, the black-robed elder standing in front of him was his second opponent as a Universe God.

“The elder is in the First Heaven. Who is the stronger one among him and the monarch?”?With a smile, Jian Wushuang held the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand and charged at the elder.

Seeing his move, the onlookers all thought Jian Wushuang mad.

As a Universe Master, he did not escape from but choose to challenge a Universe God, wasn’t he mad?

The elder was amazed as others, but the next moment, his eyes turned cold.?“You want to sacrifice yourself to protect your partners??Well, you’re a loyal friend yet a fool.”

“Since you want to die, I grant your wish!”

The elder shouted, and his black saber struck out in a strange way, cutting the void open.

A black light appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Facing a Universe God, Jian Wushuang became extremely cautious, and he dared not to restrain his power anymore like battling Universe Master Bei before.

He used eight-tenth of his power to attack.

It was a strike as powerful as the one from the elementary Universe Gods in the First Heaven. As for swordsmanship, he randomly displayed one.

This strike was meant to test the elder’s power.

However, when his sword met with the elder’s saber, Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded.

The elder’s attack was crumbled by his causal strike, and even the elder was thrown far away under the force before regaining his balance.

“How could this be possible?”

Jian Wushuang paused in the void, staring at the elder with a frown.

“I only used eighty percent of my power in the just casual move, but still, I overpowered him. Is he really a Universe God?”

Jian Wushuang could not believe what had happened.

Could a Universe God be so weak?

“Haha.”

Gu King, which parasitized in Jian Wushuang’s body, suddenly laughed and said, “Jian Wushuang, don’t be so surprised. It is normal for you to suppress him.”

“Why?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Simple, because this person has just passed the God Test to become a Universe God and his power has not been completely transformed into Divine Power. Therefore, he is not a real Universe God as those we have normally known. It’s true he is more powerful than the Universe Masters, but, he is no match for the real Universe Gods like the monarch of the Gold Kingdom.

“Eighty percent of your power can surpass all his power, let alone that your Blood Mountain Sword is much superior to his weapon.

“Therefore, shouldn’t it be natural that you can overpower him?” Gu King explained in a laughing voice.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang finally understood the reason.

Gu King’s words reminded him that it would take a Universe God some time to transform his power after he passed the God Test.

This black-robed elder obviously had passed the test not long enough to transform all his power yet.

Such a Universe God was not a real god.

“The Scarlet Island is excellent in collecting intelligence in the Dayu Region, but as the elder just passed the God Test not long ago, no wonder the island doesn’t know him.”?Jian Wushuang showed a faint smile.
