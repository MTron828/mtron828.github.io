Chapter 3578: Internal Star Secret Skill

“I do.”

Jian Wushuang agreed without hesitation.

In fact, Jian Wushuang had nothing to refuse. He had never been to the deepest part of the universe, nor had he had much contact with it. The only contact he had was with Blood Wave, and through Blood Wave…he knew about the existence of the Palace of Life.

However, the Palace of Life was formed by the special life forms in the universe. Since he was one of the special life forms, he was naturally part of the Palace of Life. Because of the special relationship of the Palace of Life, he could freely join the other major forces in the depths of the universe.

Although Planet Lingyun had undergone drastic changes, it used to be an overlord in the deepest part of the universe. There seemed to be many experts at the supreme level. Such a major force…usually, it was difficult for many experts to join. Now that Jian Wushuang had the opportunity, there was no need to refuse.

After all, with another identity, if he went to the deepest part of the universe in the future, he would have more to rely on.

“Very good.”

Seeing Jian Wushuang agree, the Golden War God also smiled. “Little guy, you’re very lucky. If previously, when Planet Lingyun was at its peak, countless geniuses tried to join our Planet Lingyun, but we didn’t bother with them. It’s a great fortune for you to be a disciple of our Planet Lingyun.”

“Lord Wind Demon, since it’s a good fortune, as an inner star disciple of the Planet Lingyun, I should be able to get some benefits, right?” Jian Wushuang asked directly.

“Of course.” The Golden War God smiled. “But our Planet Lingyun suffered heavy losses in the accident, and its foundation has been almost destroyed. Now, in this barren territory, I can’t give you the same treatment as an inner star disciple. At most, I can only let you choose an inner star secret skill.”

“Inner star secret skill? Is it a secret skill that only inner star disciples of Planet Lingyun are qualified to cultivate?” Jian Wushuang looked over.

“Yes, and not every inner star disciple is qualified to cultivate it. Only a few outstanding inner star disciples who win the competition every once in a while are qualified to choose an inner star secret skill. This time, because of the current environment, I can’t give you the treatment you deserve as an inner star disciple, so I made an exception and let you choose an inner star secret skill.”

“In addition, there are nine internal star secret skills in our Planet Lingyun. Each of them is extremely powerful, enough to make countless Rulers and even supreme-beings yearn for them. However, because of the accident, the cultivation methods of these nine internal star secret skills are available to different experts under my command. I only have two internal star secret skills. You can choose one of these two internal star secret skills,” the Golden War God said, with a wave of his hand, two golden stone tablets appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

It was obvious that these two golden stone tablets were the cultivation methods of the inner star secret skill. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Obviously, the protection of the inner star secret skill in Planet Lingyun was very strict. The secret skill could only be taught by these golden stone tablets. In other places, even if the other party had already mastered one of the inner star secret skills…but this person could not teach this secret skill to others.

“Only two inner star secret skills?” Jian Wushuang frowned, he said, “Sir, according to what you said, because I can’t get the treatment that an ordinary inner star disciple should have, you made an exception and let me choose one inner star secret skill. But you only have two inner star secret skills to choose for me. This is still a little unfair to me. Otherwise, you might as well let me cultivate both of these secret skills.”

Jian Wushuang was not willing to cultivate only one internal star secret skill. He wanted to cultivate two at the same time.

After all, according to Wind Demon, countless Rulers, including many supreme-level experts, yearned to cultivate the nine internal star secret skills that originated from the Planet Lingyun at its peak, naturally, Jian Wushuang also yearned for it.

It would be best if he could cultivate two such secret skills at the same time.

But after hearing his words, the Golden War God directly shook his head. “Don’t even think about it. You Don’t even know the value of these inner star secret techniques and their strength. This inner star secret technique is definitely much more precious than the treatment that all your inner star disciples can receive. I’ve already opened a back door for you by letting you choose one inner star secret technique, but you actually want to cultivate a second one?

“Do you think the internal star secret skill of Lingyun star is like cabbages everywhere?”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang curled his lips and did not insist. “Let me take a look at these two secret skills first.”

“Okay.” The Golden War God nodded and then revealed some of the information on the golden stone tablet to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang immediately knew the secret skills on the two golden stone tablets.

One of the two inner star gates was a special secret skill for the circulation of divine power. Once one mastered this secret skill, his divine power could be instantly increased by several times, or even dozens of times, to the peak, it could even reach hundreds of times.

Of course, the flaw was that this secret skill consumed a lot of divine power, and it could not be used together with other secret skills that also increased divine power. Most importantly, the threshold of this secret skill was very high, under normal circumstances, only great beings who had reached the Ruler Realm were qualified to practice it.

As for the other internal star secret technique, it was a secret technique related to godly bodies. It was called the supreme undying mysterious body.

This secret technique was used to shape and refine godly bodies. It could make one’s godly body incomparably tough and powerful, and it could directly reach the level of a universe true treasure. Besides, this secret technique could be practiced at the level of a Principles Master, but the flaw was…when cultivating this secret skill, it required the assistance of some extremely high-level genius earthly treasures, which were very difficult to find.

These two secret skills were placed in front of Jian Wushuang at the same time, but Jian Wushuang chose the second one decisively.

“Although the special divine power circulation secret skill can increase a cultivator’s divine power and strength, it can only be cultivated by an expert at the Ruler Realm. Although I’m a perfect chaotic creature with some special features, I can’t cultivate it at the Immortal Saint Realm. Even if I break through to the Principles Master Realm in the future, I may not be qualified to cultivate this secret skill. I don’t have so much time to reach the Ruler Realm. Besides, who knows if I’ll have the chance to become a Ruler in the future?” Jian Wushuang laughed in his heart.

A Ruler...there were so many astral worlds in this territory, but there were only so many experts at the Ruler Realm. There were only a few in the Divine Beginning Realm, so it was extremely difficult to reach that level, although Jian Wushuang had great potential, he did not dare to say that he would definitely be able to break through to become a Ruler.
