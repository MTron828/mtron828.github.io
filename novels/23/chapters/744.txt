Chapter 745: I Will Deal with the Three Guys!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Three versus two. No wonder our clansmen can’t resist them.”

Gu Mian and Gu Wu were furious. They were about to make a move, but Jian Wushuang was blocking them.

“I’ll deal with the three guys.” Jian Wushuang spoke.

“Sir?” Gu Mian and Gu Wu looked at the young man in shock.

“Just watch,” Jian Wushuang replied. He drew his longsword and charged forward.

“What should we do?”

Gu Mian and Gu Wu looked at each other, debating whether to go or not.

They had to obey Jian Wushuang’s orders, but they also needed to protect him.

“Don’t worry,” Gu Wu said solemnly, “Jian Wushuang is from the Ancient God Palace, he should be pretty strong. He wants to fight alone, let him do it. We only need to ensure his safety.”

“OK.” Gu Mian nodded. “Let’s be prepared. If he’s in danger, we’ll save him.”

They had made up their minds.

The three Eternal Realm experts from the Immortal Dynasty were fighting fiercely with the two clansmen from the Ancient God Clan.

The three experts were holding all the cards. If they finished the two clansmen off, they would take all the pool water from Baptismal Pool.

They noticed that three figures were quickly approaching.

Although Jian Wushuang and his clansmen were not Ancient Gods, the three Eternal Realm experts recognized that the newcomers were not experts from the Firmament Territory.

“Shit!”

“Demon Gods! They’re the Demon God reinforcements.”

“It hasn’t been that long since we launched the attack. They’ve come so soon?”

Their faces fell. They knew they would be unable to deal with another three Demon Gods.

“We have no choice but to retreat,” the purple-clothed lady said through gritted teeth.

“OK.” The other two experts nodded in agreement. They were just about to leave…

What happened next was totally unexpected. They saw two of the Demon Gods stop suddenly. The other one, wearing a silver mask, dove forward.

The attacker did not have a strong aura.

“One-star, One-star Demon God?”

The three Eternal Realm experts were astonished.

They were familiar with Demon Gods. They had learned about their ranking system.

In their eyes, a One-star Demon God was only comparable to a Divine Realm expert.

They could not understand why a One-star Demon God would charge out and attack three Eternal Realm experts while the other two Two-star Demon Gods stood by.

The silver-robed man asked with a frown, “What are the other two Demon Gods doing?”

“Whatever, they are courting death, don’t blame us. Luo Ao, go kill the One-star Demon God,” the white-haired elder ordered.

“OK.” The silver-robed man nodded and charged forward.

He appeared in front of his opponent and thrust at him with his long black spear. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Chuu!

The spear lashed out at an amazing speed like a viper taking its prey by surprise.

It caused a swirl to appear before Jian Wushuang, who immediately sensed a surge of killing power sweeping over.

A hint of such power was enough to kill a superior Divine Realm expert.

Upon seeing this, Jian Wushuang showed a frosty smile.

“Over the past 100 years, I’ve sparred with numerous Ancient Gods, including Two-star Ancient Gods many times, but I’ve never fought against an Eternal Realm expert!

“You’re the first one!

“Let me see how powerful you are!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up. When the long spear was about to touch his robe, he moved and waved his Emperor Sword.

The strike looked simple, but it was exquisite indeed.

Jian Wushuang had given full play to the Star-river Secret Skill and increased his offensive power by 33 times.

Boom!

A loud boom rang out just before the long spear was knocked away.

Jian Wushuang attacked again, stabbing at his opponent’s throat.

“So fast!”

Luo Ao paled. He was shocked by the young man’s quick reaction. He did not expect that Jian Wushuang would strike back so quickly with such brilliant swordsmanship.

“Humph!” He snorted.

A mighty Spiritual Power gushed out from his body. A huge powerful palm materialized in front of him, slapping toward Jian Wushuang.

Shua!

The moment the longsword crashed into the palm of Spiritual Power, brilliant sword light radiated, causing the giant hand to shatter into pieces.

“What?”?Luo Ao was stupefied.?“This boy is just a One-star Demon God, how could his strength be so amazing?”

“Luo Ao, what are you doing? Kill him. Quick!” the white-haired elder shouted.

The three experts were at a disadvantage now. Although Gu Mian and Gu Wu had not made a move, the two Demon Gods also posed a threat to them, so the outsiders wanted to leave as soon as possible.

“Bastard!”

Luo Ao’s eyes blazed with anger as he lashed out.

“Go to hell, Boy!” A roar reverberated through the area.

“Demon Heart Spear Technique!”

His long spear shot out, causing a harsh sound of piercing air.

Like a huge spiraling awl, it darted violently toward Jian Wushuang.
