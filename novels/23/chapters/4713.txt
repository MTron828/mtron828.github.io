4714 Prince Jiu

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered with uncertainty. Finally, he said slowly, “Destroy this Jingchuan completely before leaving.”

The three Emperors nodded without retorting.

Then, a terrifying scene played out.

With Jian Wushuang as the leader, they combined the power of the three Emperors and turned into an unimaginable supreme power that descended on the ground.

The river that had already cracked was completely destroyed!

The ravines that were as deep as the abyss extended to the depths of the earth’s core, radiating across the entire plane like a spider web.

In the end, this super Heaven Domain was shattered. Countless broken walls turned into giant rocks that floated in the void.

Many top cultivators who lived in the river had left.

Looking at the Heaven Domain that had been reduced to dust, Chun Qiu’s eyes almost popped out of their sockets. According to the legends, Jingchuan was the Daoist Rite of an Emperor, and it almost became the backup Heavenly Court!

Chun Qiu sighed in his heart and ignored the broken Heaven Domain that had no value anymore. He followed Jian Wushuang and was ready to leave.

The three Emperors reentered the Boyang Bowl as if they had never appeared.

“Brother Jian, from now on, we’re like birds flying in the sky and fish swimming in the ocean. Wherever you go, I, Chun Qiu, will follow you without a word!” Chun Qiu was a little excited. He had been a prisoner for countless years, and he desperately wanted freedom.

Jian Wushuang also smiled. Looking at the strange and unfamiliar Great Yan Domain, even he began to feel a sense of powerlessness.

In this Great Yan Domain that had transcended his knowledge, who knew that it would be an unknown road to find those two existences?

“Let’s take it one step at a time. I need to come up with a good idea,” Jian Wushuang said with a bitter smile.

Chun Qiu nodded. “If Brother Jian still doesn’t know what to do next, why don’t you come with me to my Imperial Father’s old Heavenly Court?”

Jian Wushuang neither nodded nor refused. He was thinking about his next step.

Unknowingly, the two of them had stepped out of the Jingchuan gate. However, what happened next made Jian Wushuang’s expression change slightly.

They saw three figures sitting on a huge rock in the void. They seemed to have been waiting for a long time. As soon as they saw them, they hurried over.

“Brother Jian, I thought you guys had also encountered such a huge commotion…” Cheng Qing stood up and waved from a distance.

Jian Wushuang’s expression was obviously not good. He did not expect that the Young Emperor and the others had not left but were waiting far away.

Chun Qiu frowned and asked in a low voice, “Brother Jian, how is it? do you want to fight your way out?”

Just as Jian Wushuang was hesitating, the Young Emperor slowly opened his eyes. He did not know whether he was confused or careless, but he took a step forward subconsciously and fell from the rock into the void.

Jian Wushuang quickly controlled the rippling force to pull his falling body to his side.

“I knew you wouldn’t die.” The Young Emperor said these last words while he was unconscious.

Jian Wushuang was helpless. Beside him, Chun Qiu’s eyes were cold, indicating that he should just kill him with one stroke.

However, Jian Wushuang shook his head. He did not have a good impression of the Young Emperor, but it did not escalate to the point where he would kill this guy.

Chen Qing and the skinny purple-robed man hurried over and took the Young Emperor from Jian Wushuang.

Then, the thin purple-robed man took out an item from his arms and threw it into the air, which expanded into a huge ship in the wind.

“Lord Jian, please board the ship.” He looked at Jian Wushuang and then nodded.

As he was too embarrassed to leave, Jian Wushuang had to board the pirate ship that led to the Six Heavens Realm again.

Because Jingchuan Heaven Domain had been completely destroyed, Chen Qing had no place to stay, so he had to go to the Six Heavens Realm with them.

Sitting at the bow of the ship, Jian Wushuang was stroking the Heaven-patterned Bone Armor he had obtained from the Tian City. The patterns on it were carved by some unknown tool, which looked strange and a little old.

“Xuan… Yi… Damn it, why can’t I see anything now? Is it a problem with the angle?” Jian Wushuang looked at the bone armor carefully. He had seen the words ‘Xuan Yi’ on the bone armor that day.

“Also, what did the stall-keeper take from my body? Divine ability, Ancestral Skill, or life force?”

Jian Wushuang looked at his palm with a frown and tried to find something different. However, just as he was concentrating, he was interrupted by a cold and deep voice.

“Prince Jiu, I know it’s you. I’ll kill you when I get back!”

Jian Wushuang looked back and saw that the voice came from the Young Emperor. However, it was probably sleep talk as he fell asleep again after the shout.

The thin purple robe was constantly transmitting Yan power, trying to make the Young Emperor feel more comfortable.

Chen Qing also walked toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang did not have much conflict with this tough and straightforward middle-aged man. After nodding to him, he prepared to continue studying the Heaven-patterned Bone Armor in his hand.

“Brother Jian, there are not many who enter my eyes, but you are one of them,” Chen Qing sighed. “In Tian City, the Sword Intent that you released was something I felt inferior to.”

“You flatter me. If you use your heart to comprehend it, you will definitely reach that step,” Jian Wushuang said.

Chen Qing smiled bitterly, “I… I’m afraid that I can’t integrate my Sword Dao anymore. However, after I go to the Six Heavens Realm, I really hope to be able to fight with Brother Jian and see the gap between us.”

“You’re always welcome.” Jian Wushuang nodded. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

A touch of joy appeared on Chen Qing’s face and he cupped his hands slightly to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang seemed to have recalled something. He turned to look at Chen Qing and asked, “Who is the Prince Jiu that he was talking about?”

Hearing this, Chen Qing’s expression changed slightly. He turned to look at the Young Emperor and said, “It’s not a big secret. Everyone under Lord Young Emperor knows a thing or two.”

“The Prince Jiu that Young Emperor mentioned is actually his Second Brother.”

“Second Brother?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. Apparently, he was thinking about the second half of the Young Emperor’s words.

Chen Qing also realized what Jian Wushuang was thinking. He smiled bitterly, “But the two brothers are now almost mortal enemies.”

I had my suspicions about the assassination attempt at Tian City. Now that the Young Emperor has said it, it’s clear that it was most likely his second brother, Prince Jiu, who had instructed it.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows again. He clearly remembered the battle formation this time. There were more than 15 Yan Immortals and nearly 1,000 Ancestor-level experts. Such a terrifying move was definitely aimed at eliminating them completely. It was definitely not an ordinary battle between brothers.
