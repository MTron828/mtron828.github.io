“Run!”

“Quick, run!”

The Jin Kingdom experts began fleeing frantically.

This place was the former capital of the Jin Kingdom. Coupled with the fact that the main forces of the kingdom were about to arrive, the kingdom had gathered the Celestial Masters who was already on the battlefield here.

However, it seemed as if they had set up themselves to seized by the Green Fire Palace in one fell swoop.

These Celestial Masters did not even have the right to put up a fight. They could merely flee frantically. Unfortunately, it was difficult for them to do so as they were in the ruddy-faced Jiu You’s domain.

Thus, a large amount of Celestial Masters was mercilessly slaughtered.

“Damn it!”

Red Snow King’s face was icy-cold as he emitted a roar. Out of the blue, a pitch-black tail that was like a saber came sweeping at him at lightning speed.

He immediately scrambled to defend himself but Samsara Temple Master suddenly bellowed. The sound carried a terrifying sound wave that attacked him.

“Crash!”

The low sound of collision resounded and Red Snow King’s body flew out. While being flung away, he spewed blood from his mouth.

“Red Snow King, I’ve told you that I won’t let even one of you Jin Kingdom experts here today escape!”

Samsara Temple Master’s cold voice reverberated in the air.

Instead of getting angry, Red Snow King laughed and replied, “You won’t let even one of us escape? Don’t you think you’re too confident in yourselves?”

“Did you really think you’ll be able to ruin the foundation of our Jin Kingdom on this battlefield with a couple of Palace Masters, Jian Wushuang, and several Puppet Fighters? What a joke!”

“Since you’re all here today, don’t even dream of escaping!”

Red Snow King was seeing red, his gaze carrying a boundless killing intent.

The several Palace Masters of Green Fire Palace and Jian Wushuang could not help frowning after hearing his words.

What kind of trouble could Red Snow King cause now that the situation had reached its current state and all the experts in the old Jin Kingdom capital had escaped?

“Humph!”

Following a harrumph, Red Snow King waved his hand and a sturdy figure immediately appeared in the Void beside him.

This sturdy figure was evidently a Puppet Fighter that bore no vitality or aura whatsoever. Moreover, it ought to be one at the Universe Master Level.

However, Red Snow King would not be able to change the current situation even if he could produce Puppet Fighters at the Third or Fourth Level, let alone a single one at the Universe Master Level.

“Could it be?” The pupils of Samsara Temple Master, Void Temple Master, and the others rapidly shrank.

They came to realize there was something Red Snow King could do.

Per their expectations, they saw him taking out a jade bottle and poured the drop of Blood Essence on the Puppet Fighter. Then, a simple and unsophisticated aura slowly began to rise out of the Puppet Fighter.

“Oh no!”

“Damn it!”

The expressions of Samsara Temple Master, Void Temple Master, and the others changed.

They already knew what Red Snow King was attempting to do.

“Soul-luring!”

“This is a soul-luring tactic!”

Gu King’s solemn voice reverberated in Jian Wushuang’s heart.

“Soul-luring? What’s soul-luring?” Jian Wushuang immediately asked.

“Soul-luring is a rather strange tactic from the Eternal Chaotic World. The user will imbue a shred of his consciousness into a drop of Essence Blood and then use his Secret Skill on a Puppet Fighter or some other vessel. One will have to pay a great price for using this tactic. In fact, the stronger one is, the steeper the price,” Gu King replied.

“What you’re seeing right now is an example of soul-luring. The drop of Essence Blood contained a shred of consciousness. I believe it to be the Monarch of Jin Kingdom’s consciousness.”

“Monarch of Jin Kingdom’s consciousness?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Even though it’s just a shred of consciousness, it contains the memories of the Monarch of Jin Kingdom. In other words, the shred of consciousness could unleash the Secret Skills he knows—including the Tao that he founded and the unique moves that he created—through the Puppet Fighter,” Gu King continued.

“However, this Puppet Fighter is only in the Universe Master level. That means whatever skills the Monarch of Jin Kingdom uses will only contain the force of half a Universe Master level.”

“I see,” Jian Wushuang said, finally understanding the situation.

Sure enough, the pupils of the Puppet Fighter that was completely still earlier began shifting around after the soul-luring ceremony. It was now alive.

“Your Highness!”

Red Snow King immediately kowtowed to the Puppet Fighter.

The Puppet Fighter ignored him and turned to look at the Palace Masters of the Green Fire Palace.

“Knowing that my army is about to arrive, you all decided to take the first initiative and destroy all our foundation here. Your Palace Masters are pretty smart, aren’t they? Courageous too,” said a cold, hoarse voice.

The faces of Samsara Temple Master, Void Temple Master, Emperor of Tang, Emperor of the Rising Sun Sword, and Red Lotus darkened.

They had once seen this scene five million years ago.

In the war between the Jin Kingdom and the Green Fire Palace, the former had used this exact same soul-luring skill to place a shred of their Monarch’s consciousness in a Puppet Fighter.

The Green Fire Palace had to pay a steep price and exerted great effort before they could defeat the Puppet Fighter imbued with the Monarch of Jin Kingdom’s consciousness.

Would history repeat itself today?

“This is troublesome!” Samsara Temple Master muttered.

Even though the basic strength of Monarch of Jin Kingdom’s consciousness was only at the ordinary Universe Master, his realm was above the Universe Master level.

“The last time we fought, you people had to use all sorts of tricks and sacrifice two of your Universe Masters to defeat a shred of my consciousness. I wonder what price you’ll have to pay this time?” the Monarch of Jin Kingdom said, smiling faintly at them.

“Samsara, what should we do?” The Palace Masters of the Green Fire Palace were already gathered in the same spot.

“What to do? What can we do?” The voice of Samsara Temple Master was cold. “Since things have come to this point, our only choice is to kill him!”

“Kill me? Hehe! How audacious.” The Monarch of Jin Kingdom sneered.

His eyes turned steely and in the next second, he was already charging at them.

“Kaboom!” The aura of Samsara Temple Master surged violently as black flames flared from within his body.

Carrying an endlessly tyrannical aura, he appeared in front of the Monarch of Jin Kingdom.

Underneath his black armor, his face had thoroughly contorted into a warped expression. His strength was at its peak. The palm that was covered in black armor was like a legendary rain-summoning dragon as he suddenly threw it outward.

Black ripples emerged out of nowhere as explosions rang out. The nine ripples revolved around Samsara Temple Master’s palm.

His palm suddenly exploded with the power of millions of thunderbolts!

“Ninth-fold Heaven Samsara Seal!”

“Kaboom!”

It was an earth-shattering skill.

This was the most powerful unique move of Samsara Temple Master in his many years of fame!

It was also a skill that he executed with all of his strength!
