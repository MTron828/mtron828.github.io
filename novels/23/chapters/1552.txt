Chapter 1553: Red Stone Prison

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“What’s wrong?”

His Highness Mu Hong and the fat, middle-aged man looked toward the old married woman.

“Someone has entered the spell that I have placed,” the black-robed old married woman said.

“Oh?” his Highness Mu Hong frowned and shot a glance toward the fat middle-aged man who was beside him, “Go and take a look.”

“Understood,” with a change of his body, the fat, middle-aged man disappeared from the palace.

“Number Seven, you go as well,” Leng Zunzhu instructed.

The black-robed old married man’s figure also disappeared from the palace.

Jian Wushuang and Real God Long Qing had just reached the void around the Ancient Demon Mountain. The moment they arrived, they were caught within a spell.

Such a spell was simple. Hence, Jian Wushuang and Real God Long Qing broke the spell quickly.

However, at that moment, swish!

A shadow appeared at the void in front of them. It was the fat middle-aged man.

“A Universe God?”

The fat middle-aged man first swept his eyes across Jian Wushuang and he revealed a surprised expression. However, after that, he took a look at Real God Long Qing and his eyes shrank hastily.

“Jian Wushuang, looks like there are some mistakes in your information. There are other Real Gods present within the Blood Demon Church.?Moreover, he should be a very powerful Eternal Real God,” Real God Long Qing said.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head slightly and said immediately: “I will leave this Eternal Real God to you.”

“Haha, leave it to me,” Real God Long Qing laughed heartily and a scarlet longspear appeared in his hands.

Swoosh!

With a flash of his body which looked like teleportation, Real God Long Qing appeared beside the fat middle-aged man.

The scarlet longspear in his hands then stabbed abruptly.

Boom~~~ The void collapsed at once.

The whole universe was drawn in by the scarlet spear instantly, and in no time, the whole boundless universe headed toward the fat middle-aged man with great power.

Such frightening power changed into an ear-piercing sound explosion.

“Kill! Kill! Kill!”

Although Real God Long Qing did not open his mouth, Jian Wushuang and the fat middle-aged man who were near the area seemed to have heard hysterical shouting sounds shouting “kill.”

“A Chaotic Real God?” the fat middle-aged man’s expression changed greatly and he immediately swung his fat palms. Following his swing, a giant mountain appeared in front of him at once. The mountain was golden in color and it gave off an ancient vibe. The mountain was then used to block the attack of the scarlet longspear.

However, at the next moment…

The lofty mountain crumbled into pieces instantly. Even the ground, which was connected to it, caved in as if it had completely disappeared.

“What shocking power. This is a Chaotic Real God?” Jian Wushuang revealed an astonished expression.

He had seen Real Gods fighting before. However, those Real Gods were merely normal Real Gods of the first stage. As for Chaotic Real Gods who were at the third stage… he had seen Lei Chao killing a Real God before. However, as Lei Chao was very powerful and the Real Gods who he was killing were too weak, he was not able to tell the difference.

However, at the very moment, after seeing Real God Long Qing’s attack, he understood how frightening a Chaotic Real God was. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He was very certain that it was lucky that the Real God who stood in front of Real God Long Qing was a very powerful Eternal Real God. If it were a Void Real God who was at the first stage, with a stab from Real God Long Qing, he would probably be able to kill tens of them.

“Hmph!”

With a cold shout, the fat middle-aged man retreated quickly and his expression also became ghostly pale.

“Trying to escape?” Real God Long Qing was filled with murderous intent.

However, at the moment when Real God Long Qing chased the fat middle-aged man, a figure appeared behind Jian Wushuang quietly.

Swoosh!

A dim light came out of the fingertips of the figure and headed towards Jian Wushuang’s neck.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s body changed and he avoided the dim light easily.

“He actually dodged it?” the black-robed old married woman who became visible was surprised when she saw what had happened.

It should be known that she was an Eternal Real God. Even though she had launched a surprise attack on a Universe God abruptly, she had still failed to kill him?

Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword had already appeared in his hands and his icy-cold eyes looked toward the black-robed old married woman.

“Another one. Seems like it’s another Eternal Real God,” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

It was obvious that there were more hidden experts in the Blood Demon Church than he had expected.

“Little kid, a Universe God like you actually dares to come here? Aren’t you very gutsy?” the black-robed old married woman laughed with a hoarse voice. After that, she lifted the sleeves of her robe and revealed ten pitch-black, wizened fingers which were below the sleeves of her robe.

At that very moment, the ten fingers were filled with dim light and in no time, rustle! Rustle! Rustle! A total of ten rays of light shot out at the same time.

“Hmph,” Jian Wushuang gave a cold shout and his body dashed forward fiercely.

Swish~~~ A total of eighteen shadows appeared at the same time.

Jian Wushuang’s body was like a ghost which passed through the void hastily. At the same time, he also bypassed the dim lights and in the blink of an eye, he had already appeared in front of the black-robed old married woman.

“Crimson Light!”

His sword light glowed as if it were crimson lightning and it headed straight for the black-robed old married woman’s neck.

Compared to back when he was in Wu Bei’s cave, the power of the crimson lightning that Jian Wushuang had unleashed at that very moment had risen considerably. In particular, its speed had become about twice as fast!

“This martial art motion?”

The black-robed old married woman revealed an astonished expression. After that, the five fingers on one of her hands changed into a sharp claw at once and headed toward the crimson lightning.

Clang!

A sound resembling the sounds of metal clashing could be heard and the black-robed old married woman’s body floated backwards. At the same time, she revealed a smile, “I see. No wonder his abilities are so impressive.”

It was obvious that the black-robed old married woman had already figured out Jian Wushuang’s identity.

However, at that very moment, bam!

It was another loud sound. A short distance away, the fat middle-aged man was spitting out many mouthfuls of blood continuously from his mouth. His aura then became weaker in an instant.

Such a scene had caused the eyes of the black-robed old married woman to shrink. At the next moment, boom~~~ Imposing Divine Power which could blot out the sky burst forth from her body and headed toward the universe.

The Divine Power came together at the void and transformed into red giant stones. The giant stones then stacked onto and pressed against each other, forming a giant prison that was completely made up of red giant stones.

Moreover, the prison had many red walls and in a split second, the red walls isolated Jian Wushuang and Real God Long Qing completely.

Taking advantage of the moment that the Red Stone Prison was forming, the black-robed old married woman and the fat middle-aged man retreated immediately.

“This is?”

Jian Wushuang frowned and looked around him. He was currently in a corridor which was formed by the red giant stones and red walls stood on both sides of him.

Moreover, the red stone walls were strange as they even blocked off his Soul Power.

“Break!”

Jian Wushuang unleashed an unreasonable amount of strength with the intent to break the red stone walls. However, the hardness of the red stone walls had completely exceeded his expectations. A stroke with his power had only managed to leave a sword mark that was neither big nor small on the red stone walls. Moreover, the sword mark closed up again in a split second.
