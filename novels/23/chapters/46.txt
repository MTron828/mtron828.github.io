Chapter 47: Dragon Palace

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Having experienced the betrayal of Jian Meng’er and the pursuit from Blood Feather Tower, Jian Wushuang had become more mature and prudent.

He understands when to be tolerant and keep a low profile.

Taking the battle with Dongfang Yu as an example, if he failed, he would lose face, but if he won, all the people would pay attention to him, and then the rate of exposure for his identity would increase significantly.

“Well, Brother Bu, do you know anything regarding the Dragon Palace these people have been talking about?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Dragon Palace…” when Sima Bu spoke about Dragon Palace, his expression was full of obvious desire. “That is the Holy Land for Gold-dragon Palace as well as the Tianzong Dynasty. It is a gathering of real talents! It was said that there are countless treasures, like Cultivation Methods and Martial Arts Techniques. Lots of things that can’t be obtained in Tianzong Dynasty can be found in Dragon Palace.

“At the same time, there is a variety of Strong and legendary people in the Yin-Yang Void Realm. Anyone who enters Dragon Palace will receive the best cultivation materials from Tianzong Dynasty.”

“But not everyone can be admitted to Dragon Palace to cultivate. In Tianzong Dynasty, it is said that all the people in Dragon Palace are exceptional geniuses! So you can understand that only the strongest geniuses can have the opportunity to cultivate inside Dragon Palace. People with average talent are not qualified at all.”

Jian Wushuang could not help being stunned.

“Are all of them geniuses?”

That was to say, any disciple in Dragon Palace would be respectfully treated as a master in Tianzong Dynasty. No wonder it was called the Holy Land.

“Brother Bu, since the qualifications are so harsh, is Dongfang Yu qualified to enter Dragon Palace?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course!” Sima Bu laughed and said, ” But not everyone can become a disciple and join Dragon Palace. Firstly, he must be recommended by a Golden Dragon Ambassador. Secondly, he has to pass the test arranged by Dragon Palace. As for these two conditions, not everyone can accomplish the first one.”

Jian Wushuang understood, the first condition was the recommendation from a Golden Dragon Ambassador.

But what’s the status of a Golden Dragon Ambassador?

It was known to all that the strongest experts of the Gold Core Realm, like Sima Bu, who had a deep understanding of the Blade Essence of Raging Fire were just a Three-Clawed Golden Dragon Guards. Only the Supreme existences could be a Golden Dragon Ambassador. That recommendation would be very difficult to get.

“Zhu Tao has been complaining that his disciple didn’t get recommended, but if he really has the talent, there is no need for him to worry about the recommendation. Look at Mr. Huo at the counter. If Dongfang Yu really is a monster-class talent, why hasn’t Mr. Huo recognized him in all this time? And nobody in Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace of Qingdong City except him has the ability to contact a Golden Dragon Ambassador.” Sima Bu sneered and said.

Jian Wushuang looked at the grey-robed elder in front of the counter and smiled.

Mr. Huo had his eyes narrowed the whole time and would not even look at Dongfang Yu, no matter how much Zhu Tao boasted about him.

“In fact, Jian Wushuang, if you are willing to work hard in the future, with your talent, there is a chance for you to enter Dragon Palace,” Sima bu said.

“Me?” Jian Wushuag shook his head.

…

Having stayed at an inn in the Qingdong City for three days, Jian Wushuang went back to the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace after the three days wait.

Once Jian Wushuang arrived, he immediately saw many people holding the same wooden-token, with the same Golden Dragon Mark as him, waiting in the hall. That included Zhu Tao’s disciple, Dongfang Yu.

“So many people?” Jian Wushuang was surprised. He just came in and didn’t have time to find a place to sit down.

“Swordsman.” A shadow appeared in front of Jian Wushuang, which turned out to be Dongfang Yu. However, Dongfang Yu looked at Jian Wushuang with despise at this moment. “How dare you come?”

“Why not?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“You can’t even fight with me for three blows. You are such a piece of trash. Did you come here to be killed?” Dongfang Yu said and laughed.

“Even if I did, that has nothing to do with you,” said Jian Wushuang as he glanced at Dongfang Yu. He didn’t want to talk with Dongfang Yu, because Dongfang Yu was just a self-righteous idiot in his eyes.

“Hum, for someone so weak, you shouldn’t have such a bad temper!” said Dongfang Yu with a sneer. Then, he thought, “Boy, once the task begins, do not let me find a chance, or…”

Dongfang Yu remembered clearly that his Great Master asked him to take down anyone who had something to do with Sima Bu.

Jian Wushuang sat at a table alone, but not long after, a black-haired man walked towards him.

“You are Swordsman, right?” The man asked, smiling at him and showing great passion.

“Who are you?” Jian Wushuang looked at him and asked the man.

“I am Ling Tianhao, but you can also call me Mouse. I came here to finish the task to become a One-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard, just like you.” The man opened his palm, showing a wooden-token with the Golden Dragon Mark.

“Is there something you want?” Jian Wushuang asked coldly.

“Of course.” Ling Tianhao looked at Jian Wushuang and asked, “Is this your first time accepting the task for a One-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard?”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“This is my third time.” Ling Tianhao sighed and said,” My strength was not enough, so I was unable to finish my task the other two times, only managing a narrow escape. If I can’t finish the third time, I will never become a Golden Dragon Guard.”

Jian Wushuang fell into silence. He knew that a person could only accept the task for One-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard three times. If he failed all three times, he would never be qualified to become a Golden Dragon Guard.

“I want to cooperate with you. When the task begins, let’s work together.”Ling Tianhao said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was a little surprised, “Cooperate?”

“Don’t hesitate.” Ling Tianhao continued speaking, ” I know that you fought with Dongfang Yu three days ago, and you didn’t even last for three exchanges. You are one of the weakest out of all the people attempting this task, just like me. So if you work alone, you will be killed before you even have a chance of finishing the task.”

“You are right. I will cooperate with you.” Jian Wushuang said and nodded. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Haha, that’s right. Follow me, I will introduce a backer to you.” Ling Tianhao pulled Jian Wushuang along as he left.

“Backer?”

Although Jian Wushuang was doubtful, Ling Tianhao brought him to meet a red-haired girl.
