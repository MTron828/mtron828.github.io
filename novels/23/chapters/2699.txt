Chapter 2700: Subdued

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master were very worried.

Initially, when they realized the real purpose of the Corpse Palace and knew that they were trapped in the situation, they hoped that Jian Wushuang would show his strength and joined them to fight the Corpse Palace.

Surprisingly... Jian Wushuang took care of Corpse Palace by himself.

Jian Wushuang had beheaded the Corpse Palace Master on the spot as well as Fo Wu who was invited by the Corpse Palace Master.

His strength was too terrifying.

Both Sheng Long and Purple Dress House Master were taken aback.

Jian Wushuang’s strength was so terrifying that it sent chills when they saw the weird smile on Jian Wushuang’s face. Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master immediately had a bad premonition.

They also recalled something. Although the Corpse Palace had great ambitions to swallow all of the forces, at least the Corpse Palace was more sensible and had not taken the initiative to act on any of the forces before.

However, the Sword Alliance was obviously more ambitious than Corpse Palace and with more sophisticated methods.

The Sword Alliance had taken down Seven Absolute Palace and Blood Water Gang one after another—it was a bloodbath.

The Sword Alliance was going to bag Corpse Palace anytime soon. Would the Sword Alliance Master Su Han be willing to let the two of them—Sheng Long and Purple Dress House Master—go?

“Alliance Master Su Han, thank you for your action today in stopping the Corpse Palace from carrying out their treacherous tricks and allowing the Divine Dragon Pavilion to be safe. I’ll prepare a generous gift and send it personally to the Sword Alliance to express my deepest gratitude after the incident,” said Sheng Long.

“The Purple Dress House is also very thankful. The Purple Dress House will do our best to help if Alliance Master Su Han needs any help in the future,” said the Purple Dress House Master.

They dared not get on Jian Wushuang’s wrong side and took the initiative to lower their pride in hopes that Jian Wushuang would let them go.

Jian Wushuang sneered after hearing them out. “I must say that the two of you are clever. You’re going to be disappointed if you think that simply being thankful or a generous gift will settle the past bad blood between us. I’m not interested in listening to your words of gratitude and generous gifts. What I’m keen on are both your territories and experts.”

Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master were startled.

“As I’ve said before, I’ve no opinion on Palace Master Gu Mo’s proposal. That’s exactly what I wanted to do to be precise. I also want to bring the third-rated forces together and form a brand new force. The only difference is that the new force must be called the Sword Alliance with me as the absolute leader!”

“Do you both have any opinions?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master were extremely furious but dared not refute.

Jian Wushuang’s purpose was obviously the same as the Corpse Palace—to take over the two forces.

In addition, Jian Wushuang was obviously stronger than Corpse Palace.

The situation seemed to like they had just painstakingly sent away a wolf, but ended up with a new and worse enemy like a ferocious tiger.

“Why? Are the two unwilling?” Jian Wushuang stared at the two in front of him with a hint of sarcasm in his eyes.

He need not do anything as he believed the two people in front of him should understand their situation laid before them.

The two of them had no choice at all.

Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master indeed were looking helplessly at each other.

Sheng Long said after a while, “Alliance Master Su Han, what will happen to us after the Divine Dragon Pavilion and Purple Dress House Master merged into the Sword Alliance?”

“Nothing will change as it’s just a simple integration. All the experts from both the pavilion and house will be given a position in the alliance based on their strength. Those with tyrannical strength can also join the Divine Sword Official Army. I’m sure all of them can be integrated into the Sword Alliance.”

“As for the two of you...” Jian Wushuang glanced at Sheng Long and Purple Dress House Master.

“You know that the overall strength of the Sword Alliance isn’t weak with me having the highest combat power at the Peak Heaven Ultimate God realm. If both of you join the Sword Alliance, you’ll only be under myself and my chief Steward who is also my maid.”

“I plan to set up another battle hall in the Sword Alliance such that only those above the High-level Heaven Ultimate Gods could join. Both of you can choose to be part of it and become the leader of the battle hall, or you can join the Divine Sword Official Army and become a member of the Divine Sword Official Army.”

“You will neither suffer nor be wronged in Sword Alliance no matter which you choose as your cultivation realm is obviously Peak Heaven Ultimate God realm. Moreover, our Sword Alliance has sufficient resources. You’ll get to enjoy more resources from the Sword Alliance every year the stronger you are,” said Jian Wushuang.

Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master were moved after listening to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s offers were not great but they dared not turn him down.

“If this is the case, Divine Dragon Pavilion agrees to be part of the Sword Alliance and respect Master Su Han as our leader,” said Sheng Long.

“Likewise with the Purple Dress House.” The Purple Dress House Master nodded in agreement.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“Alliance Master Su Han, Divine Dragon Pavilion has agreed to surrender. I’ll return and summon all the experts to make the announcement,” said Sheng Long.

“Hold on.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand. “You only made a verbal agreement. Although the two of you have agreed now, there’s no guarantee that you won’t regret it when you return to your respective forces. I’ll have wasted my efforts if that happened, won’t I?”

Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master’s expressions sank.

“Alliance Master Su Han, don’t you believe us?” Sheng Long asked in a low voice.

“It’s not that I don’t believe the two of you, but there must be a surety. It’s okay if the two of you leave now, but you have to let me leave an oppression in your body without struggling.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Leave an oppression?”

Sheng Long and Purple Dress House Master were shocked.

An oppression left in the body was equivalent to one’s life being under the other party’s control.

One must never violate the other party’s order from then on. Otherwise, the other party could kill them by manipulating the oppression.

It was a method to control the other party which was quite similar to soul control.

The difference was that soul control would erase the subject’s own consciousness and become absolutely loyal to the owner without any doubt.

On the other hand, leaving an oppression in the body would not have any effect on the subject’s consciousness, thoughts, strength, or other areas.

It was merely to control the subject by placing a stern reminder in the body, hence the subject dared not disobey the other party’s orders. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Although the method to leave an oppression in the body was not as bad as soul control, it would still make the subject feel extremely anxious.
