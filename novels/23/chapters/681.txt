Chapter 682: Prove Yourself

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

As the disciples were talking about Jian Wushuang, they couldn’t help being amazed.

Jian Wushuang had already become a monster in the Ancient Sect the moment he passed the 30th floor of the Ninth Heaven Road during the Sect Competition.

The Sword Mountain was still not noticeable.

Whoosh!

A figure appeared in the sky above Sword Mountain. The figure turned out to be Xuan Yi.

He glanced at the cave mansion and smiled, then entered it.

Jian Wushuang had his eyes closed and was still in the middle of practicing his swordsmanship. Though it’s being referred to as swordsmanship, it was actually just a simple sword slash.

It was simple, easy and quick. But when Xuan Yi saw it, he smiled.

“Going from complexity to simplicity, that is the proof of having reached Profound Realm. He has already comprehended the first Level of Sword Heart.”?Xuan Yi smiled slightly.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang stopped and looked at Xuan Yi.

“Master,” Jian Wushuang greeted him respectfully.

During these six years, Xuan Yi had come to see him every several times and given him advice on many occasions, so he knew that Xuan Yi was trying to help him. Although six years was not that long, they had built a deep friendship.

“You have been meditating in Sword Mountain for six years, it’s time for you to leave,” Xuan Yi said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang was surprised, but a smile quickly appeared on his face.

These 72 Dao characters were indeed very mysterious. In the first couple years of meditating on them, he made dramatic improvements in Sword Principle. However, his progress eventually began to slow down. Especially recently, his improvement had become very slow. It was still faster than meditating on his own but compared to when he first started, there was a big difference.

Jian Wushuang realized that the 72 Dao characters were less useful now than they were before. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“In two months, the Eternal Zone will reopen,” Xuan Yi said.

“The Eternal Zone?” Jian Wushuang suddenly looked at Xuan Yi in surprise.

“The Eternal Zone is an important event in the Firmament Territory that happens every hundred years,” Xuan Yi explained.

“When it reopens, lots of disciples from the three magnates and nine top Sects will be allowed to enter it. Usually, most of them have broken through to the Divine Realm and some of them are still pretty young, so the three magnates and nine top Sects have an agreement. The disciples in the Divine Realm only get one chance to enter and every time only a certain number of disciples from each Sect are allowed to go.”

“That means the people who enter are the top disciples from all the Sects.”

“These geniuses can enter the outer layer of the Eternal Zone, but only the experts in the Eternal Realm can enter the inner layer. They can stay there for one month and when the Eternal Zone closes, the experts all will come out.”

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly in acknowledgment.

He realized that the Eternal Zone was very unique, otherwise the three magnates and nine top Sects wouldn’t so pay much attention to it.

“It’s been one hundred years already. During this period of time, our Ancient Sect has found some excellent disciples and you are one of them, so I will arrange for you to enter the Eternal Zone,” Xuan Yi said.

“Me?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

According to what Xuan Yi said, the disciples who were allowed to enter the Eternal Zone would already have broken through and become Divine Realm experts, but he was only in the Skyscraping Realm.

Even though, based on Dao comprehension and other complex skills, he was capable of breaking through to become a Divine Realm expert, he was not planning to do it right now.

After all, the Skyscraping Realm was the equivalent of the Heaven-treading Realm in the Heavenly Creation Skill, which was the most appropriate level for cultivating, so he wanted to remain at this level longer.

“Don’t worry. Although you are only in the Skyscraping Realm, your battle strength is definitely good enough. Ordinary Divine Realm experts are not qualified to be your opponents,” Xuan Yi smiled slightly and continued, “Six years ago, you had already passed the 30th floor of the Ninth Heaven Road. At that moment, your battle strength was at the peak of the intermediate Divine Realm and almost at the advanced Divine Realm. Six years have already passed since that time, so you must have had a significant improvement.”

“Just a bit.” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help laughing.

During the last six years, he had focused on improving his comprehension of Sword Principle at Sword Mountain and hadn’t paid much attention to the World Dao and Slaughter Dao. However, his talent was pretty high, so even if he only spent a small amount of time meditating on them, his comprehension of these two Dao still had a significant improvement.

Now, he had already comprehended the fourth Occult and most of the fifth.

The most important point was that his current understanding of Sword Principle was completely different from six years ago.

Six years ago, he had to do his best to reach the 31st floor of the Ninth Heaven Road, but he was still defeated by the ten Puppet Fighters.

However, five years ago, he passed the 31st floor. Obviously, his strength was at an even higher level now.

“We of the Ancient Sect usually arrange for the genius disciples who are in the advanced Divine Realm to enter the Eternal Zone, so you only need to prove that you have the battle strength of an advanced Divine Realm expert. I’ve got a task from the Divine Palace for you. This task can help you prove yourself.”

Xuan Yi passed a task scroll to Jian Wushuang.

“A task?”

Jian Wushuang opened it and took a quick glance. Immediately after that, he had an odd expression on his face.

“Earth-level Task?”

In the Divine Palace, the tasks assigned to the Divine Realm experts were divided into levels, the Human-level, Earth-level, and Heaven-level. The Human-level was the easiest, so novice and intermediate Divine Realm experts were able to complete them easily. However, the Earth-level tasks were very difficult and only advanced Divine Realm experts would be capable of completing them.

As for the Heaven-level tasks, they could only be assigned to the superior Divine Realm experts.

Xuan Yi got him an Earth-level Task which was also at a difficult level.

Task content: Kill 11 evil Divine Realm experts who are in the vicinity of the Ancient Sect.

The task would only be complete once the 11 Divine Realm experts were all killed.

The scroll contained the information and locations of these 11 Divine Realm experts.

Among these 11 Divine Realm experts, the weakest one was at the peak of the intermediate Divine Realm. There were also five advanced Divine Realm experts and one of them, Hu Hu, was a peak advanced Divine Realm expert. He was not going to be easy to deal with.
