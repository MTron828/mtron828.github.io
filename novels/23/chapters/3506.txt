Chapter 3511: Human Illusion Level

The Purple Blood Sect had been destroyed for more than 500 years.

Although they had the capital to rebuild the sect, the sect-protecting formation was still very important.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, I know that Star Palace has a special relationship with you, and Marquis Duan Yu said that he was willing to listen to you. So, can you ask him to come to the Purple Blood Sect and set up a protective array for us? Of course, the Purple Blood Sect will not let him come for nothing. We will prepare a generous reward for him or let me owe him a favor.”.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help but smile and said, “Let me ask him for you.”

Jian Wushuang directly sent a message to Marquis Duan Yu and soon got the answer.

“Marquis Duan Yu has agreed to set up a clan-protecting formation for your Purple Blood Sect. As for the conditions, he hasn’t mentioned it yet,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Thank you,” Demon Master Chenhuo thanked him. He knew that the reason why Marquis Duan Yu agreed so readily was largely because it was Jian Wushuang who invited him.

“Marquis Duan Yu said it would take him two to three months to reach the Second Heaven. Let’s wait here,” Jian Wushuang said.

In the following time, the Purple Blood Sect began to rebuild on a large scale.

To rebuild the sect, of course, it would require a lot of resources, which was easy to do.

Demon Master Chenhuo had a lot of resources left by the Purple Star Demon Sect, which could be used.

Moreover, even if there were not so many resources, the six forces that controlled the Blood Origin Domain nearby would definitely come to him.

Three months later, Marquis Duan Yu arrived at the Purple Blood Sect.

“My young friend, Mr. Chenhuo.” Marquis Duan Yu bowed humbly.

“Marquis Duan Yu, you already know the purpose of inviting you here. Now, the Purple Blood Sect is under your feet. It has just been rebuilt. What do you think of the sect-protecting formation?” Jian Wushuang asked directly.

Marquis Duan Yu looked down at the Purple Blood Sect and nodded slightly. “The general sect-protecting formation is nothing more than to block strong enemies at the critical moment. Therefore, the sect-protecting formation is mainly used for defense. However, there are some sect-protecting formations that can be used for both offense and defense. However, the cost is even greater. Which one do you need, Mr. Chenhuo?”

“We will use a pure array formation to defend against strong enemies. As for attacking, we will only need to carry some offensive power on our shoulders,” said Demon Master Chenhuo. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“What about the level of the array formation?” Marquis Duan Yu said again, “My young friend Heavenly Sword Marquis has told me before that the Purple Blood Sect is not considered a very powerful sect now. However, because of you, Mr. Chenhuo, it will definitely rise in the future. The level of this array formation should also be higher, right?”

“Of course, it needs a high-level array formation. It would be best if it could block the array formation of a Saint Realm Master,” said Demon Master Chenhuo.

Back when the Purple Star Demon Sect was destroyed, the one who attacked the Purple Star Demon Sect was a Saint Realm Master!

The sect-protecting array formation of the Purple Star Demon Sect back then was actually very powerful. However, in front of a Saint Realm Master, it was like paper.

Having experienced it once, Demon Master Chenhuo did not wish for the next Saint Realm Master to charge into the Purple Blood Sect. Therefore, he naturally wanted a sect-protecting array formation that could block a Saint Realm Master.

However, Marquis Duan Yu smiled when he heard the words of the Demon Master. “I do have a formation that can block a Saint Realm Master. Moreover, I can set it up with my attainments in the Dao of formations. However, the prerequisite is that the resources required to set up such a formation will be much greater than what you can imagine, Mr. Chenhuo.”

“Oh?” Demon Master Chenhuo frowned.

“Let’s not talk about other things first. Just the energy required to maintain the formation can only be absorbed through divine power. To maintain the normal operation of the formation, the divine power that is stored throughout the year is in the hundreds of millions, not to mention the other precious natural treasures.”

“In addition, even if the formation is set up, it must be maintained by two or more experts who have reached the pinnacle of the sixth level of the void every million years. Otherwise, the formation might also collapse and disintegrate.”

“These two conditions are just two of the requirements for setting up the formation. There are also many other requirements that are equally demanding, such as the time required to set up the formation. I wonder if Mr. Chenhuo can accept them?” Marquis Duan Yu said playfully.

Upon hearing this, Demon Master Chenhuo was somewhat stunned.

Jian Wushuang’s expression also became strange.

However, he could understand. After all, it was not easy to set up a magic array that could withstand a Saint Realm Master?

Even if Marquis Duan Yu had the ability to set up this magic array, he did not have the capital to do so.

Although Demon Master Chenhuo had a lot of resources on hand, he was afraid that he would not be able to meet the conditions mentioned by Marquis Duan Yu.

“It seems that I have been too arrogant. I won’t think about this array that can withstand the attacks of a Saint Realm Master for the time being. Then, what are the requirements for setting up a slightly lower level array?” Demon Master Chenhuo said.

“There are many levels of array formations. An array that can withstand the attacks of a Saint Realm Master or an ordinary ruler-level expert is already an earth sage-level array formation. This level of array formation is extremely impressive, so it is naturally quite difficult to set up. For example, the five elements array formation of the Nine-tailed Clan is an earth sage-level array formation. However, because the Nine-tailed Clan does not have a ruler-level expert supporting them, they are unable to unleash the power of an earth sage-level array formation. That is why I was able to break it so easily!”

“However, if a genuine holy-level formation is successfully set up, there is absolutely no need to worry about it being broken in the Divine Beginning Realm. However, with the resources of the cultivators in the Divine Beginning Realm, it is almost impossible to set up an holy-level formation!”

“In that case, we can only take a step back and set up a human-illusion-level formation,” Marquis Duan Yu said.

“Human illusion-level magic array?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

“In the vast universe, a human illusion-level magic array is only an entry-level magic array, but in the Divine Beginning Realm, it is very high-level. For example, the Blood Marten Clan’s clan protection magic array was also at the human illusion level, but it was only at the intermediate level among the human illusion-level magic arrays.”

“And I have a few complete peak-stage human illusion-level formations in my hands. Once these formations are set up, ordinary sixth-level void realm experts would definitely not be able to break them. Even if there are three or five peak-stage void realm experts, it would be very difficult to shake them. Unless there are two or more peak-stage void realm experts, only then would they be able to break them.” Marquis Duan Yu said.

Upon hearing this, the eyes of the Demon Master brightened.

Even experts at the pinnacle of the void six realms would need at least two to break through it?

However, it must be known that other than him, there were only two experts at the pinnacle of the void six realms in the Divine Beginning Realm.

In other words, once such a formation was set up, as long as the Saint Realm Master did not personally take action, no one would be able to break it.
