Chapter 23: Supreme Level? Transcend It!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

When everyone saw that Jian Wushuang was also performing the Wave Superposition Sword Art, an uproar was raised on the Drill Ground.

“He dared to perform the Wave Superposition Sword Art?”

“He’s digging his own grave!”

It was not such a big deal if two contestants demonstrated the same Sword Art here. But one of them was a dazzling and peerless genius and the other was the one who challenged that talent two months ago. It felt like a subtle provocation for Jian Wushuang to perform the same Sword Art.

“Jian Meng’er had already pushed this Sword Art to its greatest height. Isn’t Jian Wushuang asking for trouble by performing it?”

“That’s not for sure. Don’t forget it was Jian Wushuang who taught Jian Meng’er this Sword Art.”

“So what? Jian Meng’er demonstrated the Ninth sword move. Even if Jian Wushuang can do the same, what can he prove? What’s the point to his provocation?”

All eyes were on Jian Wushuang who was standing on the arena. Many were wearing sneers on their faces. A small part of the disciples in Sword Pavilion wanted to argue for him, but those arguments seemed so weak in front of the Jian Meng’er who had performed the Ninth move of this Sword Art.

Jian Wushuang ignored everyone else. He had long focused all his attention on performing this Sword Art.

Wave Superposition Sword Art was a constant accumulation of power, stacked one over the other, requiring mastery of the most basic sword techniques.

The sword light emerged like a tide. There was no hesitation in Jian Wushuang’s movements as he performed the first Seven sword moves under everyone’s eyes. The sound of the sword slicing the air reverberated with each move.

His moves were still smooth after the Seventh one and much more coordinated compared to Jian Meng’er’s.

The Eighth sword move followed the seventh.

“It’s the Eighth sword move!”

People on the Drill Ground looked at him with earnest attention. But Jian Wushuang did not stop after the Eighth sword move and everyone realized he was attempting the Ninth sword move.

But the Ninth move was the peak level of this Sword Art. Would he be able to do it?

Just as the curiosity of the spectators was roused, he was already ready to make his move in the next moment. In an instant, he made another sword move.

The Ninth sword move! He still demonstrated it naturally and smoothly.

Exclamations rang all over the Drill Ground.

“Haha! As expected, Bai Chong was right on the mark. This little boy actually managed to perform the Ninth sword move, and he did it even more smoothly than Jian Meng’er. His talent for Sword Principle is no less than hers,” Situ Qingyue said, smiling.

The other famous experts in the grandstand nodded to show their agreements.

“Don’t make your assumptions too soon. It’s still too early to decide,” said Bai Chong, wearing a mysterious smile.

Everyone was stunned and instantly turned towards the arena. Instead of sheathing his blade, Jian Wushuang who had completed the Ninth sword move continued to wield his sword.

“What?”

The Drill Ground fell into silence just then.

He had already completed the Ninth sword move and had theoretically reached the limit. Yet he did not sheathe his blade. What did he want to do?

“Don’t tell me, he’s attempting the Tenth move?”

With someone speaking, the whole Drill Ground burst into exclamations in an instant.

“The Tenth sword move! He’s going to perform the Tenth sword move!”

“Is there be a Tenth move in the Wave Superposition Sword Art?”

Everyone was stunned. That included Jian Meng’er, whose beautiful eyes were staring at Jian Wushuang in disbelief.

Jian Wushuang was indeed continuing this Sword Art, power superposed on one another. When it finally reached a certain degree, his face turned steely and he stepped forward to make another sword move without any hesitation.

The Tenth move!

Swish! His Sword Edge cut through the air, making an ear-splitting explosion. The power of the Tenth sword move was evidently far stronger than the Ninth sword move. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

A furor swept the Drill Ground.

“Bravo!” Situ Qingyue suddenly stood up, his eyes flashing with excitement.

“Jian Xinhong, your Sword Marquis Mansion really has so many talents! We don’t even have to talk about Jian Meng’er. She’s an amazing genius. And you have this boy who has superposed the power ten times and performed the Tenth Sword. His talent in Sword Principle is pretty terrifying!” Ye Xiu looked at Jian Xinhong, his words carrying a deeper meaning.

“This…” Jian Xinhong was pretty shocked himself. He did not know how he should respond.

“Jian Xinhong, didn’t you just say the highest level of this Sword Art was the Ninth move? What about the Tenth move?” Situ Qingyue asked.

Jian Xinhong took a deep breath and said solemnly, “Indeed, the highest level of the Wave Superposition Sword Art is the Ninth move. The Tenth move is at the supreme level. However, it’s too hard to perform it. Since the time Sword Marquis Mansion obtained this Sword Art, there has only been one person who could perform the Tenth move. That was Jian Nantian, the previous Sword Pavilion Master. And this boy… is his son.”

“Jian Nantian’s son?” Situ Qingyue was frozen in shock. Instantly, the famous experts in the grandstand began to look at Jian Wushuang differently.

“The Tenth move. I just knew the boy wouldn’t disappoint me.” A smile came over Bai Chong’s face but disappeared just as quickly.

“What?” Bai Chong blurted out in surprise.

“This…” Everyone in the grandstand was astonished.

Jian Wushuang, whose performance of the Tenth move had left everyone astounded, was not done yet. His sword light began to flutter, ready to accumulate power.

He was going to attempt the Eleventh move!

“That’s impossible!” Even Jian Xinhong could not help standing up, eyes gleaming with horror.

“This boy is mad! He’s mad!” Under the arena, Jian Lan was shouting again and again.

“The Eleventh move?” Bai Chong and the rest in grandstand stood up with surprise. Even the high and lofty Shui Hanxin was stunned and, for the first time, looking at him approvingly.

The Drill Ground sank into a deadly silence.

Everyone’s eyes were concentrated on Jian Wushuang.

He did not pay mind to their attention and closed his eyes, recalling everything his father told him when he taught him this Sword Art.

“Shuang, remember that there’s no such thing as the supreme level to any Sword Art. If the Tenth move is the supreme level of the Wave Superposition Sword Art, all you need to do is to transcend the supreme level!”

Swish!

The ruthless sword light emerged with fury.

This sword move seemed capable of splitting the world into two.

On the arena, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes. A faint smile appeared on his face.

“I have transcended the supreme level!”

“Father, I’ve done it!”
