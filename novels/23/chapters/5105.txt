Chapter 5106 ¬†The Enemy of the Past

In what seemed like an affirmation of Jian Wushuang's inner worries, the road of Immortal bones suddenly began to tremble relentlessly.

Along with this tremor, a voice, as if echoing from ancient times, filled with a sense of decay, rang out.

"Kill‚Äîkill‚Äîkill!"

The shouts of killing resounded from beneath the road of Immortal bones, causing the entire road to become turbulent.

Jian Wushuang's gaze became completely serious; he could sense the terrifying presence beneath the earth's core.

With each cry for blood, it felt as though countless Yan Immortals were engaged in a bloodthirsty battle on a battlefield, exhausting their last drops of divine blood.

The entire boundless border seemed to have turned into a battlefield, returning to that distant Ancient Era.

The road of Immortal bones beneath his feet trembled as if these Immortal bones were about to awaken at any moment, leaving everything with an indescribable sense of awe.

"Kill‚Äîkill‚Äîkill!"

The next moment, from the depths of the abyss, black smoke billowed more intensely than at any previous time, almost reaching the point of obscuring the void.

Jian Wushuang slowly retreated, his brows furrowed. This kind of supreme aura could not be released by ordinary Yan Immortals.

A great calamity was about to occur on this road of Immortal bones.

As if confirming his thoughts, within the all-encompassing black smoke, a pair of eyes, like suns and stars, quietly appeared.

In the midst of the abyssal black smoke, the True Eyes suddenly emerged.

With the appearance of this pair of true eyes, Jian Wushuang immediately sensed it.

As their gazes met, thousands of arrow-like black mists shot out from the black smoke.

Jian Wushuang was taken aback and, almost instinctively, he retreated a hundred steps, wielding his Invisible Sword to cut down each of the oncoming black mist arrows.

"I'm still alive... I'm actually still alive!"

From within the black smoke, a voice, desolate and withered, rang out, as if it had released the endless pain of countless ages.

"Zhen Wuyang, I'm still alive, I'm still alive!"

The black smoke raged violently, and the top layer of the road of Immortal bones began to crumble into dust.

Jian Wushuang slowly retreated. He could already sense a desolate and lonely aura from this black smoke, and coupled with the words spoken, he could deduce that this entity had existed in the same era as Zhen Wuyang.

To coexist in the same era as Zhen Wuyang and call out his name could only mean they were hostile forces.

Who else but the most formidable beings could traverse the river of time and still remain alive? Re√™ad latest ùíèovùíÜls at nùíêùíêv/e/l/biùíè(.)com

After thinking through all of this, Jian Wushuang made no hesitation and prepared to retreat from the boundless border. After all, here, once his Yan power was depleted, he would truly perish.

However, before he could make any moves, the pitch-black smoke that obscured the void suddenly gathered, transforming into a massive hammer that could blot out the sky, crashing heavily toward Jian Wushuang.

He felt a sudden shock, naturally sensing the terrifying power of this force, and hastily leaped aside.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The hammer, formed from condensed black mist, struck heavily upon the road of Immortal bones, causing a tremendous quake.

The Immortal bones, which had endured for countless eons without decay, couldn't bear such immense pressure, and instantly, craters appeared one after another.

Jian Wushuang had no intention of lingering in the battle. He used his movement ability 'Earth Shrinking Mountain River' to traverse mountains and rivers, quickly leaving the road of Immortal bones.

However, the road of Immortal bones was vast beyond measure, almost as boundless as the Great Desolate Wilderness.

As he departed, the hammer formed by the condensing black smoke transformed once again, this time into thousands of chains that madly shot downward.

Clang! Clang!

Each chain formed from the black smoke easily shattered a section of the road of Immortal bones.

Even with his use of Earth Shrinking Mountain River to traverse mountains and rivers, Jian Wushuang found it difficult to create distance as the chains descended from the heavens, blocking any possible escape route.

His brow furrowed, and an Invisible Sword silently materialized in his hand, releasing a myriad of Sword Intents!

Every sword intent erupted with unparalleled momentum, slashing at the chains.

When the two clashed, light and darkness existed only for a moment before both dissipated.

Jian Wushuang no longer rushed to escape but instead turned to gaze at the void.

In the emptiness, the towering black smoke had gradually converged and was slowly undulating.

As the black smoke continued to dissipate, a pair of True Eyes hidden within it finally fully materialized.

It was a colossal figure reaching tens of millions of feet in height. Even though it was concealed beneath the black smoke, its magnificent stature was hard to conceal.

Presenting the fragmented and battered armor, one could hardly discern it as a piece of battle gear. It had been worn down to the point where it could no longer conceal the colossal body that stood a staggering ten million feet tall.

As the black smoke dissipated, the colossal figure loomed over the road of Immortal bones.

He wore tattered battle armor, his face was angular with wild unkempt hair, and his eyes gleamed like they were forged from divine blood, radiating unmatched true power.

In his hand, he held a sword that was already broken in half.

With his appearance, violent whirlwinds reappeared in the void, and thunderbolts, resembling colossal dragons, descended from within the whirlwinds, wrapping around the figure in the damaged armor.

"I'm still alive, and I won't live in vain. I will destroy everything as a companion to my master in death!"

The figure in the battle armor roared with his sword held high, and his eyes seemed as if they were about to bleed.

He had died countless ages ago, yet here he was, awakening in the vast wilderness.

Everything familiar had turned to dust, and all that met his gaze was desolation.

Upon his first moments of awakening, there was only Jian Wushuang by his side, and he instinctively regarded Jian Wushuang as an enemy.

"You're one of Zhen Wuyang's lackeys?!" the figure in the battle armor shouted angrily, pointing his broken sword down.

Jian Wushuang took a step back, his gaze serious. "I have no connection to Zhen Wuyang. You've mistaken me."

"I won't make a mistake. I can sense his aura on you. You must have an intricate connection with Zhen Wuyang!" the figure in the battle armor roared. "Since I've come back to life, I'll destroy everything related to Zhen Wuyang!"

Jian Wushuang muttered to himself, "This is bad," and without hesitation, he unleashed the peak of his Yan power from within his Immortal body.

Boom, boom, boom!

Supreme Yan power erupted instantly in the barren wasteland where Yan power couldn't naturally exist, once again causing spatial anomalies to manifest!

Whirlwinds converged, emitting a suffocating and desolate aura.

The figure in the battle armor stood on the road of Immortal bones, his colossal body exuding an irresistible pressure, almost unbearable to behold. He then swung the broken sword in his hand downward.

The void could not withstand the force of this strike, and it began to rupture, collapsing under an unparalleled weight.

Jian Wushuang's gaze turned intense. He stomped on the road of Immortal bones beneath him, with himself at the center. In that moment, a million Sword Intents surged, pure and intertwined with crimson-gold divine patterns, illuminating the void.

The Wushuang Sword Intent clashed with the broken sword, creating boundless sonic waves.

The bone road was torn apart, turning into powder in the void.

As for the mountain-like roadblocks that Jian Wushuang had piled up in the boundary cracks, they too turned into a handful of ashes...
