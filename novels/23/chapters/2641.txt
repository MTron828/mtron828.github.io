Chapter 2642: Upheaval!!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang was gliding by the void around them and overheard the soldiers’ conversation by chance.

Jian Wushuang smiled. ‘It’s because I’ve gained great benefit from the Blood Gem mineral vein, especially Royal Blood Gem... Otherwise, I can’t afford to be so generous.”

He would not mistreat his men, but those soldiers were only Peak Divine Demons or regular Ultimate Gods after all. Even the commanders were only Peak Ultimate Gods, hence those Primordial Stones that Jian Wushuang gave them were quite plentiful.

“Tomorrow will be the day to say bye to this mineral vein.” Jian Wushuang gave out a slight sigh as well.

There was not much for him to worry about moving onward since the Royal Blood Gem’s secret had not leaked.

Even if someone talked about it after many years, his abilities would certainly have been at an even higher level where he could protect himself.

Jian Wushuang casually glided.

Suddenly...

Ring!!

A bolt of energy wave came from not far away.

It was too vague that none of the Official Army soldiers reacted to it, but Jian Wushuang immediately sensed it.

“This wave...” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

“Enemy attack!!

“Immediately be prepared!!”

Jian Wushuang shouted urgently as his voice resonated between the mountains where the mineral vein was located.

Many Official Army soldiers at the mineral vein including those Crimson Stone Fort experts were immediately alerted at once.

Meanwhile, the faces of those few black-robed men who gathered together at the place where the energy wave started turned grim upon hearing the shout.

“Damn, I thought there’s no Heaven Ultimate God left in this area. How could someone discover us?”

“Don’t care, let’s move now!”

“Alright!”

Boom boom!!

The vague energy wave stopped hiding as huge energy burst out.

The energy burst did not only go in one direction but spread out to five other directions in the mineral vein as well.

A blurry grey light immediately began to expand in all six directions which covered the entire mineral vein.

The entire Blood Gem mineral vein was shrouded in a grey light within only the blink of an eye.

“Is this...a magic formation?”

The bullish black battle armor donning Scorpion King had already appeared way up in the air while looking at the mineral vein that had already been shrouded in the grey magic formation with an unhappy expression. He waved his large hand and charged fiercely with his gigantic fist at it like a huge mountain.

The Scorpion King’s punch contained the extremely powerful energy of a Grand Ultimate God.

However, it only slightly shook grey magic formation when the punch landed which very soon became still again.

“What powerful magic formation.” Scorpion King squinted slightly as his cold voice suddenly resonated. “Who are you losers? Show yourselves!!”

Scorpion King’s loud command swept in all directions with incredible force.

“Haha, Scorpion King. No need for that big temper”

“Hehe, Scorpion King. It’s been a while, you’re still the same, huh?”

Two voices were heard one after another before several black-robed men immediately glided out of the grey restrictive shield’s edge from six different directions.

A sharp-browed old man and a purple-haired man whom the two voices belonged to were leading the group.

“Bai Tu and Li Qianji! So it’s the two of you.” The Scorpion King looked at both of them with grim-looking eyes.

The sharp-browed old man’s name was Bai Tu from the Divine Demon Sect while the purple-haired man was Li Qianji from Life and Death Tower.

Both of them were Grand Ultimate God experts which the Scorpion King had got acquainted with in the past. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Other than the two, there were 40 over black-robed men with each of them projecting the aura of a Heaven Ultimate God.

The terrifying line-up consisted of two Grand Ultimate Gods and over 40 Heaven Ultimate Gods.

“Uh...”

“We’re in big trouble!”

The Crimson Stone Fort’s Heaven Ultimate Gods had already gathered together with a worried expression.

Jin Yihang was trembling in fear and dare not stay in the void above. He instead quickly hid in a mining cave.

On the other hand, the Official Army soldiers from Northern Darkstar Territory were also gathered together.

“Your Excellency, what should we do?” Cang Heng and the other commanders stood before Jian Wushuang.

“They’re not friendly. Get all our brothers to stand in formations as we observe the situation,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Aye.” Cang Heng immediately got the Official Army to fall into formations.

However, they only have four Official Army battalions which consisted of 4,000 men. Each battalion was barely capable of fighting against a High-level Earth Ultimate God at most even when they were in formation. A Heaven Ultimate God sent by the Life and Death was enough to crush them.

“Hmph, when did the Divine Demon Sect and Life and Death Tower started to be in bed together?” Scorpion King’s face was frosty while staring at the two of them.

“Haha. Although Divine Demon Sect and Life and Death Tower have minor disputes, we don’t have a deep grudge against each other. What’s wrong with us temporarily being together for some mutual benefits?” The sharp-browed old man Bai Tu giggled. “Scorpion King, we have to thank you this time for extracting all the Blood Gems from the mineral vein and saving us so much work.”

“You’re here for the Blood Gems as expected.” Scorpion King was not at all surprised.

Although he purposely prevented news from leaking out, Life and Death Tower and Divine Demon Sect have very strong intelligence gathering capabilities, so they might already catch wind of it since he did lead some Heaven Ultimate Gods to carry out the huge mining work. They might have previously just been quiet about it.

The two top-tier powers waited until the Blood Gems extraction was completed and kept in an Interspatial Ring before taking action.

“You have two choices now, Scorpion King. First is to hand over all the Blood Gems you have gotten then we’ll let you and the Crimson Stone Fort experts go while the second choice is that we’ll directly get it ourselves and the Blood Gems will still be ours in the end, but all of you will die!” Bai Tu’s voice was cold.

“Hehe, the famous Scorpion King! We heard you’re only a slightly more talented disciple in the Sacred Palace when Crimson Stone Saint was still alive and you’re only loyal from being indebted to him!

“You’ve been beside Yin Su’er as her right-hand man ever since Crimson Stone Saint’s death. You’re the reason Yin Su’er can still somehow barely hold Crimson Stone Fort together despite it being on the brink of crumbling. I believe Yin Su’er will be heartbroken if you as her right-hand man die here today,” sneered Li Qianji.
