“Zi Xu, it’s really you?”

Great Emperor Colored Glaze looked at Great Emperor Zi Xu in shock.

From what she knew, Great Emperor Zi Yu had always been taking an indifferent attitude in fighting for fame and fortune.

Like ranking on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, regardless of if he was on the fifth place or the last place, he didn’t care.

He hardly fought and he didn’t care much about Sanctuary Alliance. He could be said to be a Great Emperor who was aloof.

However, Great Emperor Zi Xu rushed over.

“I never expected Great Emperor Zi Xu, who is widely acknowledged as aloof, would be interested in Green Fire World as well,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze sneered.

“A big world that is nurtured by the ancient battlefield. It’s not strange that I am interested in it,” Great Emperor Zi Xu smiled.

“Humph, don’t think that I don’t know that you are not interested in Green Fire World but Jian Wushuang,” Abysmal Saint Master looked at Great Emperor Zi Xu and there was a strange look.

“Regardless of if I am interested in Green Fire World or Jian Wushuang, as long as our goal is the same, it will work, right?” Great Emperor Zi Xu smiled.

“That’s right. Green Fire World is very unusual. How could Jian Wushuang conquer such a world with boundless possibilities alone? The three of us might as well conquer Green Fire World first. Then, when the others discover the world, we can discuss then. As long as the three of us take hold of Green Fire World first, the three of us will definitely receive the most benefits,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze said.

“That’s right. So, let’s not delay any further. Let’s depart now,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

Great Emperor Zi Xu smiled faintly.

The three Great Emperor immediately departed.

However, it was not long after the three Great Emperors departed. They still had a fair distance to reach Green Fire World.

A piece of news was spreading among experts in Eternal Chaotic World like wildfire.

The news was about Green Fire World’s existence!!!

Green Fire World, that was nurtured by the ancient battlefield and had great potential!

At the same time, it was also the biggest treasure in the entire ancient battlefield!

The moment the news spread, the three Great Emperors who were on the way to Green Fire World found out immediately.

“D*mn it. The news about Green Fire World has already spread,” Abysmal Saint Master’s face grew grave and he reprimanded Great Emperor Colored Glaze, “Colored Glaze, what’s going on? I thought only you knew about Green Fire World.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“I never said that I was the first who found Green Fire World,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze refuted coldly, “The first who found out was Emperor God Xie Xin and he was killed by Jian Wushuang long ago. As for the news, it was given to me by a Sir God from Colored Glaze Sanctuary who just broke through not long ago. He was Emperor God Xie Xin’s junior.”

“He told me about Green Fire World and the condition was for me to kill Jian Wushuang on his behalf. I agreed with him on the surface. But now, he has found out that I can’t kill Jian Wushuang. Hence, he naturally has to figure out other ways. It is normal that he would spread the news.”

“You knew that he would announce the news to the public. Why didn’t you kill him directly?” Abysmal Saint Master asked coldly.

“Abysmal, do you think I am as despicable as you?” Great Emperor Colored Glaze teased, “Plus, I can guarantee that he didn’t keep his guard up. If he were to inform the others long ago and hide, so what? The news would spread even sooner if I were to kill him.”

“Although the news spread, at least we have the upper hand.”

“Mm, Colored Glaze is right,” Zi Xu by the side spoke too, “The big world on the ancient battlefield would be found sooner or later. There’s no way to hide it. However, compared to the others, the three of us have gotten a head start. It’s good enough.”

Abysmal Saint Master heard but didn’t speak further.

The three of them immediately sped up and rushed to Green Fire World.

Then, in Eternal Chaotic World and on the ancient battlefield, there was a great commotion.

“A big world? The ancient battlefield nurtured a big world?”

“The big world is located right at the core of the ancient battlefield. The spiritual influence of heaven and earth was the strongest there. If we were to be able to cultivate there...”

“There is limitless possibilities. Green Fire World really carries limitless possibilities!”

“Go, go, hurry up and go!”

“A big world that is nurtured by the ancient battlefield. I wonder how it looks internally.”

Countless experts were shaken by the news and made their way to Green Fire World.

Not only experts from human territories but also experts of special tribes all rushed to Green Fire World at the first instant when they heard the news.

Green Fire World was everyone’s focus. It was everyone’s focus.

However, when Sir God Xue Dao spread the news, he brought up Green Fire World but he not Jian Wushuang.

He knew that if the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance were to find out that Green Fire World was controlled by Jian Wushuang, the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance would definitely find a way to message Jian Wushuang for him to hand out Green Fire World proactively. Regardless of the threats or temptations, Jian Wushuang might be forced to give in if he had no alternative.

However, as long as Jian Wushuang had a string of hope and didn’t hand over Green Fire World, experts from various forces would charge there altogether. Jian Wushuang might not have the time to regret then.

...

In Green Fire World, although Jian Wushuang was in his secret room, the movement in Eternal Chaotic World and the ancient battlefield, he received detailed information from Lineage of Star.

“It is widespread now?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes but he wasn’t surprised.

He knew that as long as the ancient battlefield was found out, it would be impossible to hide Green Fire World.

Then, all experts from various forces in Eternal Chaotic World were shaken by the news and they were on their way to Green Fire World.

Green Fire World was enduring unprecedented pressure.

“Until now, the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance had yet to get in touch with me. It seems that the person who spread the news only spoke of Green Fire World but never mentioned me,” Jian Wushuang took a deep breath.

“The surrounding battlefield, the opportunities contained on the battlefield, take them if you want!”

“However, Green Fire World is my root. No one should even think about touching it. That’s my bottom line!”

“I hope that you don’t force me to then. Otherwise, I can only make that move!”

There was an intense light shimmering in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

In Green Fire World, besides himself, there was another trump card.

That was the strongest trump card, the final trump card.

Jian Wushuang definitely wouldn’t use the trump card unless he reached the final stage.

If Jian Wushuang were to be cornered, he absolutely wouldn’t hesitate to use it.

At the worst, they’d fight at the risk of mutual destruction!!
