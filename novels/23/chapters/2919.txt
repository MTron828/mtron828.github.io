Chapter 2920: Consciousness Doppelganger

——

Countless experts in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion were completely stunned.

There were nine Immortal Saints in the Supreme Emotion Valley. In the blink of an eye, eight of them died on the spot!

Jian Wushuang’s terrifying sword strike and terrifying strength shocked everyone.

“This, this is impossible!”

A shrill voice suddenly sounded.

The voice belonged to the cold and arrogant woman, the only one among the nine Immortal Saints of the Supreme Emotion Valley who was still alive.

The cold and arrogant woman was the strongest among the nine, and her position in the Supreme Emotion Valley was very high. Although an Elder of the Supreme Emotion Valley had given her a life-saving command token, which she had used just now, she was lucky enough to survive. Otherwise, she would have been killed on the spot just like the other eight people.

However, although she survived, her right arm had been cut off by the sword sea.

She was pressing on the wound on her right arm. The divine power in her body was surging, trying to repair the broken right arm.

However, no matter what she did, the wound did not change at all. There was still a trace of extraordinary power left in the wound, which was still eroding her divine body.

“What kind of power is this?!” The cold-arrogant woman was terrified.

Jian Wushuang stood in front of her with a cold face.

“The heaven-cleaving skill can even cut through saber principle. The immortal body has no effect against the heaven-cleaving skill.” Jian Wushuang murmured, “Unfortunately, I only met the requirements to use the heaven-cleaving skill, and I didn’t have a deep understanding of it. I just barely used it, but I didn’t use even one-thousandth of its power. Otherwise… Even though I’m only a Divine Master, the heaven-cleaving skill alone is enough to defeat many Immortal Saints.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists.

He knew how terrifying the heaven-cleaving skill was.

It was the most powerful magic power created by his Master Xuan Yi.

“Eh?”

Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly changed, and he immediately raised his head.

As he raised his head, he saw that the void above him was becoming noisier and noisier.

“The will of Heavenly Dao is about to descend, so I can’t dawdle. I want to leave with Shuang Er immediately!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold, but he directly moved forward, wanting to snatch Leng rushuang away.

But just as he moved…

“Jian Yi!”

A hysterical roar suddenly came out of the cold and arrogant woman’s mouth. “You killed eight disciples of our Supreme Emotion Valley. Today, no matter what background you have, you will die without a doubt! No one can save you!!”

As the cold and arrogant woman’s roar fell, a jade slip suddenly appeared in her hand.

It was a gray jade slip that emitted a special aura.

As soon as the jade slip appeared in her hand, it was crushed by her.

In an instant, a thick and ancient aura burst out from the jade slip.

Rumble…

The aura was so strong that it was suffocating.

As soon as it appeared, countless cultivators felt as if their necks were being strangled. They could not even breathe normally.

Jian Wushuang’s figure immediately stopped in the void. He frowned slightly and looked toward the source of this aura.

Here, a hazy figure slowly took shape.

This figure was at least three meters tall. Although her face could not be seen clearly because of the hazy figure, she was already a woman.

“Master!!”

Seeing the three-meter-tall figure, the cold and arrogant woman immediately cried and knelt. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

A pair of cold eyes swept across the surroundings from the haziness and saw everything.

She ignored the cold and arrogant woman and directly locked her eyes on Jian Wushuang.

“The pressure of the life level? And it’s so strong, it’s incredible!!” The haziness could not help but be shocked.

She had a noble identity and was very powerful. She had spent many years in the core of the absolute beginning Divine World, which was the third sky. She had seen all kinds of bloodlines and races in the whole beginning divine world, as well as some unique life forms.

But she had never seen a creature with a life-level pressure that was so strong.

“The person with the highest life-level pressure I’ve seen is a superior life-form who has long reached the level of a master of laws. He is a life-form formed by a golden mountain that has existed for billions of years. His physique is powerful, and he is one of the overlords of the absolute beginning divine world. When that life-level pressure swept out, even the top bloodlines in the whole beginning divine world would have to submit to it.

“But I feel that the life-level pressure from this Divine Master is ten times stronger than that of the rule master!”

The shadowy figure exclaimed in disbelief.

While the shadowy figure stared at Jian Wushuang, the latter was also sizing her up.

“An avatar of consciousness?” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

A cultivator could easily condense an avatar of consciousness if he wanted to.

However, an avatar of consciousness did not have power, but an avatar of consciousness was different.

An avatar of consciousness could have a certain level of combat strength. Some people could condense an avatar of consciousness because they cultivated secret skills, which was enough to display 30% to 40% of the original body’s combat strength.

The blurry figure in front of him was a consciousness clone, and it was the consciousness clone of a rule master!

“Even if the consciousness clone of a rule master only has 20% or 10% of the combat strength, it’s probably enough to defeat the Immortal Saint,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself. But, facing the consciousness clone of a rule master… he was also feeling a lot of pressure.

“What’s going on here? Who is this person?” The shadowy figure asked slowly, but his voice was a bit hoarse.

“Master, this person is a monster,” the cold and arrogant woman said. “We were ordered to come to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion to take junior sister Leng back to the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, but we were stopped by this person. At first, we saw that he would be a hindrance to junior sister Leng, so we wanted to kill him directly. However, we did not expect that although he is only a Divine Master, his methods are very powerful, and he is too strange!

“He is just a Divine Master, but his combat strength is strong enough to match a first-level true God. Moreover, he has an immortal body. This immortal body is not only ineffective against material attacks, even soul attacks have no effect at all. Just now, junior sister Qiu had already used soul attacks on him twice in a row. Each time, his soul was completely destroyed, but he was still able to survive and recover immediately.

“Just as I was planning to use the treasure to suppress him, he used an incredible technique to kill junior brother Ziyi and his seven junior sisters. Even I would have died if I didn’t have the life-saving talisman that you gave me!”
