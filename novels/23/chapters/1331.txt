Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“The two of you can start now,” Master Qing instructed.

Jian Wushuang and Dong Ao walked towards the middle of the drill ground.

“Jian Wushuang,” Wu Cang spoke, “When you go into Snow Tower, you are only required to reach the seventh floor and you don’t need to worry about it. But now, you have to take this seriously.”

“Don’t worry, I know,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Jian Wushuang and Dong Ao stood in the middle of the drill ground and faced each other in a short distance.

Dong Ao had a frosty look and he gazed at Jian Wushuang. He lowered his voice and said, “You go ahead first. Give me your all. Otherwise, you might not stand a chance.”

“You’re pretty confident,” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. The Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand, “I’d like to see where your confidence derives from.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Jian Wushuang took action straight away.

A flowing light suddenly flashed. Then, Jian Wushuang stood before Dong Ao and stroked with Blood Mountain Sword.

Although the stroke looked like it was performed casually, it felt like it could actually tear the world.

The divine power that Jian Wushuang let out was merely the level of a Peak Universe God in the First Heaven. However, through Blood Mountain Sword, it was a notch stronger than an ordinary Peak Universe God in the First Heaven.

Looking at the attack of the sword light, Dong Ao’s gaze turned cold and he took a step forward.

The moment he took a step forward, the saber that he was carrying behind his back was suddenly withdrawn simultaneously.

Cling-clang. The saber light was like a wave lapping at Jian Wushuang.

There was a cloud of grey mist that soared up from Dong Ao. His image suddenly became very blurry.

Dang! Dang! Dang!

The continuous metal clashing noise was heard and Jian Wushuang’s figure was forced to move three steps back.

“This strength, you’re not weak, huh?” Jian Wushuang lifted his eyebrows, “It’s a secret skill. The grey mist that covered his body strengthened the explosion of his divine power.”

Buzz!

A fierce blade suddenly raised and Dong Ao’s gaze turned cold. The grey mist on his body suddenly increased and his divine body increased in size too. He looked as though he had turned into a brown bear and there was a terrifying hostility.

Wow!

Dong Ao slashed his saber down.

A shadow that covered half the sky appeared from nowhere. The shadow contained an imposing power and the disciples from Snow Dojo were surprised.

“A rank two unique skill?”

“Although it’s only a beginner rank two, it’s not too shabby.”

Some disciples were discussing among themselves.

For a Peak Universe God in the First Heaven to create a rank two unique skill, it would definitely stir a commotion elsewhere in other worlds.

However, in Snow Dojo where experts gathered, for a Universe God in the First Heaven to create a rank two unique skill was nothing.

There were at least a dozen Universe Gods in the First Heaven in the Snow Dojo who had created rank two unique skill after all.

At the same time as Dong Ao wielded his saber and put his rank two unique skill to play, Jian Wushuang swung his sword and performed a rank two unique skill too, Test Wrecker!

Bang!

There was a loud thud and the ground suddenly cracked and shattered.

Jian Wushuang was pushed back by the impact once again. He wasn’t just forced backwards but actually flew off.

Only after a while he regained stability.

“As expected, you who merely reached the seventh floor of Snow Tower, are only at this level of power,” Dong Ao stood there with his saber as he spoke in a disdainful manner.

By the side, Wu Chao saw and he couldn’t help but look at Wu Cang in disdain and smiled coldly, “Wu Cang, this is the genius who you were talking about earlier? The one who can win victory for Snow Dojo in the ranking battle? Stop joking.”

“The battle has yet to end. Why are you in a hurry?” Wu Cang snorted but he wasn’t panicking at all.

On the battlefield, Jian Wushuang heard Dong Ao’s disdain and taunting words. His pupils contracted as he said, “At first, I wanted to experiment with a few new unique skills on you. But as you said that, let’s end the battle straightaway.”

Jian Wushuang didn’t plan to continue fooling around with Dong Ao but took action directly.

Swoosh!

It was the same situation. A flowing light plundered and appeared before Dong Ao.

Then, he wielded his sword. That stroke was a simple lift to the air, a simple and casual stroke.

“Funny!”

Dong Ao didn’t bother with Jian Wushuang. When he saw Jian Wushuang charging towards him, he wanted to raise his saber again.

Buzz!

The sword light appeared with a faint whistle of the sword.

Dong Ao shook and he stunned on the spot.

Psst!

An arm and a fiery redness flew out.

Jian Wushuang stopped behind Dong Ao and he slowly tucked Blood Mountain Sword into its scabbard.

Dong Ao finally came back to reality and he suddenly glared. His eyes were filled with terror and rage.

He realized that his right arm was chopped off.

It was because Jian Wushuang showed mercy. Otherwise, that stroke could totally chop off his head.

“Impossible!”

“I refuse to accept the result!”

“It is merely because I’m careless and I didn’t defend you. Hence, your surprise attack succeeded!”

Dong Ao bellowed, “Jian Wushuang, let’s do this again!”

“Again?” Jian Wushuang turned around and looked at Dong Ao. In his eyes, there was a flash of disdain.

By the side, Wu Cang chuckled sneeringly, “Wu Chao, this is the genius that you brought? This kind of quality? He lost. If Jian Wushuang didn’t show mercy, he would be dead by now. And he’s shameless enough to ask Jian Wushuang for a rematch? Haha!!!”

Wu Chao’s face grew grave.

Especially when he heard Dong Ao throwinga tantrum, he felt even more embarrassed.

“Idiot, get down!” Wu Chao shouted.

“I refuse!”

Dong Ao stared at Jian Wushuang. He was really unwilling to accept the outcome.

He thought Jian Wushuang had merely defeated him by a surprise attack because he was not paying attention.

However, no matter how unhappy he was with the result, he had lost. No one pitied him. Jian Wushuang wouldn’t do a rematch with him. He had no choice but to leave.

“Long Hao, you watched the two battles. Do you have a decision?” Master Qing looked at Long Hao.

“Yes.” Long Hao nodded and smiled, “The battle earlier, Jian Wushuang was originally at disadvantage. However, he could defeat Dong Ao directly in the end because he performed a consciousness attack. It was a very fierce consciousness attack, even Dong Ao, who was a Peak Universe God in the First Heaven, couldn’t resist.”

“Such an impressive consciousness attack is rare to come by!”

Long Hao was telling the truth.

A consciousness attack wasn’t something rated. Most cultivators could perform the trick, but to be able to perform didn’t mean one was an expert at it.

In the Eternal Chaotic World, only very few people specialized in consciousness attacks or other similar magic tricks. Only those who were experts in it could perform such fierce consciousness attacks, and Jian Wushuang was obviously one of them.
