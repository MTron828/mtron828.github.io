Chapter 278: An Invitation

With a leap, Jian Wushuang landed on the roof, and the thunder dragon quickly followed him. “Crack!” The dragon swept over the roof, and under its powerful attack, the roof was smashed into pieces. After rapidly flying around the rooftop, Jian Wushuang returned to the purple-robed youth.

With a terrifying killing intent, Jian Wushuang slashed at the youth with his sword, his great power behind it.

The purple-robed youth remained calm and brandished the Stone Cudgel once more.

With a rumbling boom, the thunderbolt’s power exploded fiercely, and yet, the Cudgel was knocked away by Jian Wushuang’s sword.

As soon as Jian Wushuang beat back the youth, he found that the emotionless man was upon him before he could attack the youth further. All at once, a shaft of black light appeared which quickly transformed into a thread, both chilling and terrifying.

Seeing the black light, Jian Wushuang could not help but frown. He instantly stamped the ground with his feet.

Where he stamped, the ground would crackle. He suddenly retreated back, and at the same time, raised the Triple-kill Sword. With this move, a towering giant appeared behind him out of thin air, wielding a sword of its own, which proceeded to attack the two.

The strike was so powerful that the youth and the emotionless man were both shocked and were forced to defend themselves at the same time. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Bang!”

The powerful roar echoed between heaven and earth, the whole of Devil Heart City trembled at that very moment.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Three flowing lights fell back all at once and stood firm in the Void. Their positions set in three different directions.

Sword in one hand, Jian Wushuang stared the other two down impassively.

His eyes, however, glittered with excitement, the purple-robed youth was burning with the pure desire for battle. But after a moment, he was able to control that desire, suppressing it.

“That’s enough. Stop the fighting,” the emotionless man said, and then looked at Jian Wushuang. “Gentleman, we meant no harm. My brother was simply born too warlike for his own good, unable to suppress his desire for battle. But it certainly doesn’t go as far as to the death.”

The purple-robed youth gave Jian Wushuang a grin.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes then nodded himself. He had noticed that as well. These two men fought against him with plenty of restraint. It had become obvious through their blows that neither had intended to fight seriously.

“Since that’s the case, both of you are free to leave,” Jian Wushuang said in a cold voice.

However, the two didn’t move.

“You are a truly mighty expert. In a one on one fight, my brother and I alone are no match for you,” said the emotionless man, “with such strength, your name must be mentioned quite often in the Tang Dynasty. Yet I’m confused about which one on the Bloodmoon List should be you.”

“Bloodmoon List?” Jian Wushuang shook his head. “I arrived in the Tang Dynasty today, so I am not on the list.”

“Oh?” Their eyes lit up. “Then, your name?” asked the emotionless man.

“Swordsman,” replied Jian Wushuang.

“Swordsman?” The emotionless man nodded and said, “I am Bei Mu, and my brother is called Leng Yang. Both of us come from the Heartless Sect.”

“Bei Mu and Leng Yang?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He had seen those names on the Bloodmoon List before.

Leng Yang had been ranked 864th on the list.

Bei Mu had been ranked 713th on the list.

The two had both been outstanding experts with rather high rankings on the list.

“No wonder they are so strong. They turned out to be the experts on the Bloodmoon List.”?Jian Wushuang thought with approving admiration.

There were so many experts within this dynasty that an ordinary expert in the Peak of the Yang Void Realm was not worth mentioning. After all, he had killed six of them just in one day. But it was another story for the experts in the same realm on the Bloodmoon List; they were much stronger than the former.

Just like the warriors of the Gold Core Realm on the Earthly Dragon List of the Tianzong Dynasty, the warriors on the Bloodmoon List could best all the others who had achieved the same tier.

The same was true of the experts at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm on the Bloodmoon List.

“Swordsman, you seem to be a bit stronger than even us. To stay in such a small city is nothing short of wasting your many talents,” said Bei Mu, looking at Jian Wushuang.

“As I see it, you might as well follow us to the Heartless Sect,” he continued, “since our sect is one of the four great powers in the Skywave Prefecture. Besides, there’s a raging battle with another force ongoing, you can display your talent to its fullest if you were to go there.”

“The Heartless Sect?”

Upon hearing the name, Jian Wushuang immediately recalled a person, the Master of Heartless Sect, a Half-saint expert who was ranked 118th on the Bloodmoon List.

“So, what do you think?” Both Bei Mu and Leng Yang both appeared confident, likely expecting a positive reply.

Since their sect had recently been fighting a fierce battle with another great force, they certainly had an urgent need for more experts. Since that was the case, any experts that qualified to be on the Bloodmoon List, such as Jian Wushuang, would undoubtedly be well received.

Jian Wushuang pondered for a moment before finally nodding. “Very well, I shall follow you.”

Hearing this, Bei Mu and Leng Yang glanced at one another with satisfied grins before turning back to Jian Wushuang with happy smiles on their faces.

“How soon can you depart?” asked Bei Mu.

“Please wait for a moment, I”ll be ready to leave soon,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“Ok.” Bei Mu and Leng Yang waited where they were while Jian Wushuang left for the Void nearby.

In a modest room in the Devil Heart City, a black-robed youth leaned on a corner drinking. Suddenly, with a long sword upon his back, Jian Wushuang appeared in front of the youth.

The black-robed youth raised his head, revealing a face as same as Jian Wushuang’s.

Through sheer force of will, Jian Wushuang and the youth soon merged into one a single body.

No one knew that the man who had slaughtered the Hungry Wolf Gang, and later fought both Bei Mu and Leng Yang to a standstill had just been a Slaughter Doppelganger of Jian Wushuang. As for himself, he had been in that room since the very beginning.

Jian Wushuang slowly swayed the wine pot.?“Bei Mu is right. Destroying the strongest gang in the Devil Heart City, the Hungry Wolf Gang, was so easy for me. I can’t put my talent to use here at all.”

“But the Heartless Sect... it’s one of the four great powers in the Skywave Prefecture!”

“There is an average of fifty experts on the Bloodmoon List for every one of the twenty-one prefectures in the Tang Dynasty. In Skywave Prefecture alone, I could guess there were at most fifty experts that come from the four powers. Only there can see more experts.”

Considering the intricacy of the powers of the Tang Dynasty, most experts and warriors would choose to join forces with them in particular. That was exactly what Jian Wushuang planned to do as well.

As for the Bloodseeker Gang, a gang without even one expert on the Bloodmoon List and had also invited him to join during the day, they no longer suited his tastes. The Heartless Sect was far more qualified to present him an invitation, which was exactly why he accepted their invitation.

Having made up his mind, Jian Wushuang came back to the Hungry Wolf Gang’s nest and saw Bei Mu and Leng Yang still waiting there.

“Hey, let’s go.”Jian Wushuang smiled.

Upon seeing Jian Wushuang, Bei Mu and Leng Yang both felt that his aura seemed to have changed somewhat, but they didn’t pay much attention.

With Jian Wushuang now in tow, the three headed to the Heartless Sect.
