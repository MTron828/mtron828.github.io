Chapter 1466: Living In Seclusion!

Within the one billion mile range that the experts under Blood Emperor’s control were searching through vigorously, in the extreme depths of the underground, there was a cave dwelling that had exploded forcefully by divine power.

Jian Wushuang was in the cave dwelling.

At that very moment, his face was pale and the aura on his body was weak.

“King of Venomous Worms, how long until my divine power has recovered to its peak?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The stronger your power, the more difficult it is to recover your divine power. Plus, your divine power wasn’t expended in an ordinary massacre but burned by force while you were running away. When you arrived at this cave dwelling, your divine power was almost empty. Luckily, I was there to recover on behalf. You’ll need at least three days to recover to your peak,” King of Venomous Worms replied.

With his divine power, which could be compared favorably with Peak in the Third Heaven, under the situation where it was burned entirely, it was already considered an unbelievable recovery rate for him to recover in just three days.

It was all because of King of Venomous Worms.

If Jian Wushuang were to rely on his own recovery power, it would definitely require much longer time.

“Three days?” Jian Wushuang nodded in silence as his face grew grave, “What’s going on with Blood Emperor? I told him I have no Tian Sha Gem. I said I have none and he wanted to kill me?”

“Could it be that he was definite that I have a Tian Sha Gem? But I don’t even know what Tian Sha Gems are.”

Jian Wushuang muttered.

“It was because you didn’t know about Tian Sha Gems. That’s why Blood Emperor wanted to kill you,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Why?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“Jian Wushuang, if I’m not mistaken, Blood Emperor should be someone from Holocaust Sect!” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Holocaust Sect?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Holocaust Sect was one of the most vicious sects in Eternal Chaotic World. They were brutal and merciless. In order to enhance their power, they would even massacre countless living things.

Such a sect was hated by every force in Eternal Chaotic World, they were the public enemy of all cultivators!

Back in Green Fire World, Jian Wushuang came across an expert from Holocaust Sect, Dao Yuanzi and he witnessed the vicious measure of one from Holocaust Sect.

In the end, Dao Yuanzi died in his hand and his Blood-killing Plate Armor was from Dao Yuanzi.

“An expert from Holocaust Sect wants to kill me? Would it be because of Blood-killing Plate Armor?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

“Should be,” King of Venomous Worms nodded, “Blood-killing Plate Armor is a treasure made by Holocaust Sect with a vicious method and experts from Holocaust Sect should have some sensory ability towards treasure like this. Plus, the closer the distance, the stronger the senses.

“Previously, when you were wandering around the other places in Sky Sword Prison, Blood Emperor couldn’t sense the existence of Blood-killing Plate Armor as the distance was far. But when you came to Darkness Mountains, the distance became closer and he could sense the aura of Blood-killing Plate Armor. Hence, he aimed for you!”

“However, although he could sense the existence of Blood-killing Plate Armor, he wouldn’t be able to gauge if you were from Holocaust Sect. After all, people from Holocaust Sect must be extremely careful when they wander around Eternal Chaotic World. They would hide the aura of the secret skill of Holocaust Sect that they cultivated entirely. Under a situation where they do not expose the aura actively, no one would know that he was an expert from Holocaust Sect.”

“Hence, he was nice to you at the very beginning.”

King of Venomous Worms paused and continued, “As for the reason why he asked for a Tian Sha Gem from you, he was probing you!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Tian Sha Gem was a treasure that Holocaust Sect refined forcibly using a unique method. It is extremely precious. Many experts in Eternal Chaotic World never heard of it. However, an expert from the Holocaust Sect would definitely know about it.”

“He used Tian Sha Gam to test you but you don’t know anything about it. Hence, he determined that you aren’t from Holocaust Sect. You obtained Blood-killing Plate Armor by chance. Hence, he wanted to kill you and take away your Blood-killing Plate Armor!”

“Oh, I see,” Jian Wushuang nodded in silence but he found it confusing, “Although my Blood-killing Plate Armor is quite powerful, it is just a Chaos Unique Treasure for Universe God level. It has yet to reach the Real God level. With Blood Emperor’s power, he shouldn’t be bothered by this kind of treasure.”

“Hehe, you got this wrong,” King of Venomous Worms scoffed, “Blood-killing Plate Armor is really just a Chaos Unique Treasure for Universe God level to you. However, it was different for experts from Holocaust Sect. After all, Blood-killing Plate Armor was a unique treasure to Holocaust Sect and ordinary experts in Holocaust Sect aren’t qualified to have it.”

“Dao Yuanzi, the guy you killed back then, wasn’t as powerful as Blood Emperor but his background should be more impressive compared to Blood Emperor. He didn’t get Blood-killing Plate Armor, but Dao Yuanzi got it.”

“To Blood Emperor, he couldn’t use Blood-killing Plate Armor of Universe God level. But when he’s out of here, he could figure out a way to enhance the level of Blood-killing Plate Armor through massacres. Then, Blood-killing Plate Armor would become Blood-killing King Armor. Blood-killing King Armor is a treasure that many experts from Holocaust Sect dream of!”

“Blood-killing King Armor?” Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded.

He knew that there was Blood-killing Armor below Blood-killing Plate Armor, but he didn’t know about Blood-killing King Armor.

“No wonder Blood Emperor wanted to kill me. He wanted to take my Blood-killing Plate Armor,” Jian Wushuang understood.

“Blood Emperor is from Holocaust Sect. If so, what if I expose his identity? Wouldn’t he become the public enemy of cultivators in Sky Sword Prison?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“He wouldn’t.”

King of Venomous Worms smiled, “If you were to expose his identity in the outside world, he would become a public enemy and be chased after by many experts. However, you’re in Sky Sword Prison. In this prison, everyone is a prisoner. Under such conditions, every expert in Sky Sword Prison only wants to survive and shake off their identity as a prisoner one day. As for Blood Emperor being from Holocaust Sect, they wouldn’t be bothered.”

“True,” Jian Wushuang nodded as he agreed with King of Venomous Worms’ assumption.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ll pass on a set of hiding methods to you. Study them and master them as soon as possible,” King of Venomous Worms suddenly said.

“Hiding methods?” Jian Wushuang stunned.

“King of Venomous Worms explained, “You’re eyed by Blood Emperor and you’re in big trouble. Although you’re out of his sights for now, he definitely knew that you were hiding in this region. He definitely ordered the experts under his control to search for you in this region. If they find you, you’ll be doomed.”

“But if you master this method, it won’t be that easy for them to find you.”

“You might as well hide here and cultivate. Live in seclusion. Let Blood Emperor and his people continue their search. After some time, when they grow tired of it, you can find an opportunity to leave.”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows when he heard that and he understood.
