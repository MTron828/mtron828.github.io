Chapter 2281 Insanity!

There were two people who stepped out of the passageway. The first was a smiling bald man in a white cloak. He was bathed in sunlight as there was white lights that were sparkling around him. It gave people the impression that he was a gentleman.The other woman was in crimson cloak. She looked ordinary, but she had an incredibly cold aura. It was as though everyone had to worship her and she was out of reach.

Jian Wushuang’s irises constricted when he saw the two experts.

He had seen these two people before!

He had seen them in the Ancient Display inside the gigantic head.

In the Ancient Display, the owner of the head, the bold man who could battle the Heavens, the Earth and all sentient beings, had been forced into a desperate situation by trillions of Divine Demons.

There were three people in the lead, and two of them were these two figures who had appeared.

These two led trillions of Divine Demons with another man. The other man was an unmatchable Demon King. He rode a crimson dragon and penetrated the heart of the bold man with a spear.

These two were definitely Masters of the Holy Land!!

“Hehe, Seria. You really value this disciple of yours. Not only did you ask both of us to help you open this passageway, you also paid a huge price for both of our consciousness embodiments to descend upon this world?” The bald man in the white cloak laughed heartily.

“Is this your precious disciple? White hair with grey irises. Haha. She has the same unique constitution as you,” the woman in crimson clothes said casually. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Even though both of them spoke normally, their voices were heard not only within the area covered by the black mist, but across the entire battlefield.

The beautiful lady squinted her eyes and said with a deep voice, “Stop wasting time, save my disciple.”

“Naturally.” The bald man smiled.

“Leave it to us,” the woman in crimson clothes said confidently.

They were Masters of the Holy Land. They were absolutely confident in their own abilities.

The bald man in white clothes and the lady in crimson clothes looked over at the space where Jian Wushuang and Leng Ruxue were.

Leng Ruxue had just escaped into the area covered in black mist. She was trying her best to get close to the passageway with Jian Wushuang hot on her tail. He was closing in on her quickly.

Leng Ruxue could have been faster than Jian Wushuang given how eerie her martial art movement was. It should have been difficult for Jian Wushuang to catch up to her.

However, after casting the Golden Flame three times, Leng Ruxue was severely injured. She lost most of her fighting power. Of course her speed would be slower as well.

However, Leng Ruxue saw hope.

She saw the two figures who appeared at the edge of the passageway. Without a doubt, her master had asked both of them to help her.

“Stop.”

The bald man smiled as he said indifferently. He did not move at all.

He only opened his mouth and told Jian Wushuang to stop.

Right after he said these words, Jian Wushuang felt an unbelievable amount of power pressuring him.

This power did not have any substance to it. It was neither aura nor pressure. It was purely to suppress one’s will!

It was pure willpower, yet it was incredible and absolute.

Under this pressure, Jian Wushuang was tempted to kneel. The desire to stop flashed across his mind.

Immediately, a ray of killing intent flashed across his irises.

“It is just will. How can it stop me?”

Jian Wushuang’s face turned red as he roared. His stopped for a split second before continuing to dash towards Leng Ruxue.

“Huh? This little one has such a strong will.” The bald man was surprised.

“Having a strong will is one thing. More importantly, the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth here are far too powerful. You can barely use your willpower.” The woman in crimson clothes smiled.

“That is true.” The bald man laughed silently before his eyes turned cold. “No one should go against my will. Since this little one has gone against it, he shall die.”

Once the bald man finished speaking, a brilliant white light lit up the space around him.

This light was extremely bright and warm. It lit both him and the area covered in black mist up. One could feel at peace simply by looking at him.

However, Jian Wushuang’s irises constricted when he was covered by the white light.

He clearly saw a white spear appear in front of him, threatening to pierce through his divine body.

“This power...” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He could feel that the power within this white spear was far stronger than that of a Chaotic Realm expert. It was probably near the peak power of a Divine Demon.

Even though Leng Ruxue’s master was also a Master of the Holy Land, her attacks were not nearly as powerful.

Of course, this didn’t mean that the bald man was much more powerful. It was because the bald man was standing within the black mist. Here, the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth were much weaker.

The area covered in black mist was where the Eternal Chaotic World met the Absolute Beginning Divine World. Here, the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth were the weakest. Now that the passageway was open, the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth were further weakened. This enabled the two Masters of the Holy Land to be much more powerful within this area.

Jian Wushuang was sure that the two Masters of the Holy Land could at least use the power of a Divine Demon, maybe even more!

The power that Jian Wushuang could use was also at the level of a Divine Demon, but he felt his power was far weaker than that of the bald man in white clothes.

There was no way Jian Wushuang could beat him when both his power and techniques were far inferior.

Jian Wushuang instantly felt that his life was in danger when he saw the white spear.

“I cannot be stopped by these two Masters of the Holy Land. If I am...” Jian Wushuang fixed his eyes on Leng Ruxue who was still trying her best to escape his chase.

He was extremely close to Leng Ruxue. He would be able to catch up to her and suppress her almost instantly, give that she had no fighting power left.

If he was stopped by this spear, Leng Ruxue could use the time to dash beside the two Masters of the Holy Land. Jian Wushuang would not stand a chance against them.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned bloodshot when he thought of this.

Madness was written all over his face. He made a headstrong decision.

Instantly, star power started to boil within his body.
