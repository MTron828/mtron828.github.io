Chapter 4002: Unreconciled

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I know great beings who own universe boat are not to be trifled with, but I am still unreconciled to the meat on the tip of my tongue. So I went forward to negotiate with the great beings in universe boat, and I even brought up my Ancient Yuan Star. Who would have thought that the other party did not care about my Ancient Yuan Star at all? He even directly asked me to get lost, and if I were to say one more word, he would kill all of us.” The sturdy old man clenched his hands tightly, in a low voice, he said, “No matter what, he is still snatching the meat from our mouths, yet he is still so overbearing, completely disregarding our Ancient Yuan Star. Of course, this makes me angry. I have been unable to swallow this anger, so naturally, I do not have the mood to continue hunting.”

“Is that so?” The silver-haired middle-aged man in the long robe nodded slightly, but then he smiled. “Why, are you not happy? Don’t tell me you want to drag out the great beings in universe boat and kill them?”

The muscular old man was stunned, but then he shook his head. “I’m not stupid. How could I dare to attack him directly? Even if I’m angry, I can only endure it.”

“It’s good that you know.” The middle-aged man in the silver-haired robe laughed, “In the universe, to be able to own a universe boat is enough to show his identity and power. Unless we have absolute confidence to figure out his true power and means, we shouldn’t provoke such a person.”

“I know, but this person has been hiding in universe boat and hasn’t shown himself. There are arrays on universe boat that block my soul probing, so I can’t find out his true power, so I don’t dare to act Rashly. However, the more this is the case, the more unwilling I am to accept it. If the other party is really a powerful great being, and he shows himself, or shows a little godly power or aura, and it really scares me, then it’s fine for me to be reprimanded by him, but what if the person in universe boat isn’t a great being, and he’s just using universe boat to put on airs? Then I’ll become a joke,” said the sturdy old man.

!!

In the universe, there were many people who relied on universe boat to put on airs.

Everyone knew that those who could own universe boat were all extraordinary, so naturally, very few people dared to provoke them.

However, the universe was so big that there were some weaker people who had obtained universe boat by chance. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

In the Purple Micro Star Field alone, it had happened several times that the other party rode universe boat, but his own power was very ordinary. There was even a Principles Master who rode universe boat.

“Old man, do you think the person I met this time is a real great being, or is he just putting on an act with the help of universe boat?” Asked the muscular old man.

“I don’t know.” The silver-haired middle-aged man shook his head. “It’s hard to get a universe boat,” said the middle-aged man, “there’s no doubt about that. Under normal circumstances, those who own a universe boat must be real great beings or people with a big background. Of course, there are also some people who are lucky enough to get such a universe boat. However, such situations are rare. However, from what you just said, the other party didn’t show up at all. He didn’t even show his godly power or aura. That’s strange.”

“You think it’s strange too?” The muscular old man’s eyes lit up.

“A little, but I can’t be sure.” The silver-haired middle-aged man’s voice was calm, but his gaze suddenly turned toward the muscular old man. “Thirteen, if you’re really unhappy and feel aggrieved, and you can’t take this lying down, you can try to probe that universe boat, but don’t show yourself. Just send your subordinates to probe it, or use some other method to figure out the level of power of the great beings in the universe boat. Then you can decide whether to make a move or not.”

“Haha!” The old man laughed, “I’ve been waiting for you to say that. To tell you the truth, I’ve been planning to do that for a long time. However, I don’t need my men to test it out. I just need to wait quietly. I’ve known for a long time that the couple saved by the great beings in universe boat are going to wing fire star field. When my men fought with this couple, they used some special methods to sense their location.”

“If I’m not mistaken, this couple should have been on that universe boat the whole time. When they arrive at the wing fire star field, they will come down from the universe. We just need to go to the wing fire star field in advance and wait. Once that couple leaves the universe boat, we will immediately capture them. By then, we will be able to get information about the great being on that universe boat from this couple.”

“That’s a good idea.” The silver-haired middle-aged man in the long robe could not help nodding his head.

“However, that couple rode on the universe boat. The speed of the universe boat traveling through the universe void space isn’t something we can compare to. Whether we want to arrive at the Winged Fire Star Field ahead of time or catch up with that universe boat later, we’ll probably have to use the few universe passages in Ancient Yuan Star.” The muscular old man frowned.

The price of creating a universe passage was extremely high.

However, as a large-scale pirate force that could be ranked in the top ten in the Purple Micro Galaxy, there were indeed a few hidden universe passages in the Purple Micro Galaxy. However, they were rarely used unless there was a big deal.

“The price of using this universe passage is extremely high. Although I am also a leader of the Ancient Yuan Star, my ranking is relatively lower. If I want to use the universe passage, I have to get the approval of those few people. Old Ten, you have to help me talk to them when the time comes,” said the strong old man.

“Okay, leave it to me. When I understand the strength of the great being on the universe boat, if the other party is really putting on airs, I will go with you to deal with that person. If it is not enough, call Old Seven and Old Five,” said the silver-haired middle-aged man in a long robe.

“Haha, then thank you very much.” The strong old man finally laughed.

In the Purple Micro Galaxy, the speed of the universe boat was naturally not as fast as when it was in the dark void of the universe. Moreover, because of the frequent encounters with Space Pirates, it would more or less be affected, but the speed was still very fast, at least, it was many times faster than the speed of the cultivators.

Jian Wushuang and Leng Rushuang stayed in the universe boat, along with the couple.

The couple had only stayed in the universe boat for 40 years, and they had already reached the edge of the galaxy near the Winged Fire Star Field.

“Good luck, you two.”

Jian Wushuang’s laughter came from the universe boat, and then the universe boat sped up and flew directly toward the galaxy ahead.

The cold-looking man and the red-clothed woman watched the universe boat leave with gratitude.

After the universe boat completely disappeared from their sight, the couple also prepared to leave the galaxy and go to the Winged Fire Star Field.

However, they had just left.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

A large number of Space Pirates suddenly appeared and blocked the way of the couple.
