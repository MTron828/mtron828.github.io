Chapter 606: Secret Skill

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Please go ahead,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Look carefully, it’s the first move!”

Immediately, six tall Spear Soul Phantoms arose behind him. Just after Dark Emperor thrust his long spear, the phantoms did so too.

Darkness spread and created an eddy as if it would swallow everything in the world. At the center of the eddy, the cold spearhead had rushed towards Jian Wushuang with an all-encompassing lethal force.

Jian Wushuang looked grave. Behind him, his Golden Sword Soul Phantom rose too.

Although there was only one, the Supreme Sword Essence it unleashed was much more powerful than those six Spear Soul Phantoms.

Gathering the Spiritual Power in his hand, in the next second, Jian Wushuang slashed out with his Heart-killing Sword, which looked like a boundless and lasting Star River.

It was the seventh move of Heart-killing Sword, Star River.

BANG!

Two forces collided, immediately ripples spread through the air. The dark eddy turned around and Jian Wushuang also staggered back many steps.

In the eddy, Dark Emperor held tightly onto his long black spear and the aura of darkness on him became stronger, “I have underestimated you. It didn’t kill you, it didn’t even suppress you. Instead, you have the upper hand. You are strong enough to be ranked among the top experts in the Ancient World.”

“Here comes the second move!”

“I will spare no effort this time.”

Then he thrust his long spear again.

Seemingly simple, it rushed rapidly towards Jian Wushuang’s head like lightning across the distance.

“So fast!” Jian Wushuang’s look darkened.

“Fast and horrifying!” Saint Masters of the Darkness Temple behind Dark Emperor were shocked.

Apparently he had spared no effort.

Jian Wushuang squared his shoulders and watched the coming spear. The Blood River Realm immediately spread and a blood bridge crossed the Blood River.

Asura Secret Skill, Road to the Underworld and Bridge of Helplessness were displayed simultaneously.

The next moment, Jian Wushuang slashed again.

He used his full strength, with all his body’s power, Spiritual Power and power of Sword Soul and Dao.

The Star River was much stronger than before.

Boom!

Two forces collided again, Jian Wushuang stepped back more than 30 meters before stopping.

“Such a powerful move.”

A glimpse of admiration flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes after he came to a stop.

Though his physical strength was stronger than Dark Emperor.

He was weaker in Dao, as was his trump card. Therefore, he was at a disadvantage.

But fortunately he was not injured.

“You’re not injured. I believe you are qualified to be ranked in the top ten in the Ancient World. Be careful, the third move comes.” Dark Emperor’s cold voice reverberated in the world.

On hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s face darkened more.

Saint Masters of the Darkness Temple were expectant.

“Is it...”

“Sure. His most powerful move, Secret Skill, which he created himself!”

“Secret Skill, when will we create our own?”

In the void, Dark Emperor suddenly struck out.

Immediately the void turned into nothingness. A long spear stabbed out quietly but with amazing speed.

It was too fast to react to, Jian Wushuang could only raise his longsword before his chest.

BANG!

A thud fell. Jian Wushuang’s eyes opened wide after finding that a rift appeared in the void before him.

“Space, space rift?” Jian Wushuang stared at it.

It cracked space. Such a powerful attack...

“What’s going on?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He thought it was powerful because it had torn through space. However, when it really hit him, he found that it was not. He was not even wounded.

“What happened?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and understood immediately, “Dark Emperor has planned this. He was just posturing to prove that he had tried his best.”

Understanding this point, a happy expression appeared on Jian Wushuang’s face.

Since it was a show, Jian Wushuang certainly would support him. Spitting out blood, Jian Wushuang’s face turned pale, as if he was heavily wounded. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Dark Emperor frowned and looked at Jian Wushuang, “You are not dead? Your body is so strong that?even Bone Dragon Emperor’s body is not stronger than yours.”

“I will keep my word. Since you’re still alive, I will not stop you anymore.”

Then he left directly.

“Husband!”

“Temple Master!”

Hearing what the Dark Emperor said, those Saint Masters’ faces changed.

“Thank you!”

He turned his eyes to a corner of the Darkness Temple, where there was a powerful aura he had perceived earlier.

That was Su Ming.

“Su Ming, come accept your death!”

Jian Wushuang’s angry shout reverberated.

In a hall of the Darkness Temple, Su Ming sat leg-crossed. He knew what had happened outside.

His eyes fell when he saw Jian Wushuang was still alive after being attacked by Dark Emperor’s strongest move.

“Dark Emperor’s most powerful move, he created it himself. In the Ancient World, only he can perform it. It’s impossible that Jian Wushuang can withstand it, even if his body is strong!”
