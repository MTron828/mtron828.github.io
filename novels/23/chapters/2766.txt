Chapter 2767: Outer Realm

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Apart from those two, a bulky middle-aged man with a strict face was also sitting by the round table. The bulky middle-aged man in a loose yet expensive-looking robe was the publicly recognized most powerful expert in the Danyang Continent—Nanwu Palace Master!

Nanwu Palace Master, Life and Death Tower Master, and the Dongfang Clan Master... Three of the five pinnacle forces’ leaders in the Danyang Continent had gathered there.

“Honorable leaders, I’m sure you know the reason I invited you here today?” Nanwu Palace Master looked at the others around him.

The evil-looking elder—the Life and Death Tower Master—laughed weirdly. “Of course, we definitely need to revise our plans now that such a huge incident has occurred.”

The grey-haired old lady also known as the Dongfang Clan Master asked, “I never imagined the Divine Demon Sect was so weak. How could they be defeated in a head-on battle against the Sword Alliance—an alliance that had just been formed recently?”

“Don’t underestimate the Sword Alliance. Both of you would be foolish to think that it was a pure coincidence for the Sword Alliance to defeat the Divine Demon Sect,” said Nanwu Palace Master in a low voice.

“Nanwu, what do you mean by this?” The Life and Death Tower Master looked at him.

“Nanwu, you also took action during the battle and knew most about the Sword Alliance. Tell us about them if you know,” said Dongfang Clan Master.

“It’s true that I saw the entire battle with my own eyes. The Sword Alliance isn’t weak and is truly slightly stronger than the Divine Demon Sect. I’m guessing that only Nanwu Palace is stronger than the Sword Alliance Among our four pinnacle forces while both of your forces are almost at a similar level to the Sword Alliance,” said Nanwu Palace Master.

“Are they really that strong?” The Life and Death Tower Master and Dongfang Clan Master’s facial expressions darkened.

They saw from the mirror images that the Sword Alliance had quite strong combat powers.

However, it was quite unconvincing to say the Sword Alliance was well-matched with both their forces.

Nanwu Palace Master said with a serious tone, “You only saw images of the battle but did not participate in it. The Sword Alliance had such an upper hand in the battle isn’t only because the Sword Alliance has a group of Grand Ultimate Gods with high combat power. Another major reason is the Sword Alliance Master Su Han!

“Don’t underestimate Su Han. Although he only has the power of a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God, he has extremely strong skills and exceptionally strong domains. Many of the Divine Demon Sect’s Grand Ultimate Gods were greatly suppressed when it was activated, causing their combat power to be greatly reduced. Even a Peak Grand Ultimate God such as Dong Shen was greatly suppressed.

“These are the results of his domains when covering the entire battlefield. If he focused on only suppressing an individual, the domains’ suppression would be even stronger!”

The Life and Death Tower Master and Dongfang Clan Master were stunned when they heard that.

They realized that Nanwu Palace Master had a high evaluation of Su Han’s domains.

Su Han’s skills in domain control must be extremely good for the Nanwu Palace Master to give him such high praise.

“Su Han’s skills and the Sword Alliance’s strength are only some of the factors. The real issue we should be afraid of is the Sword Alliance’s background,” said Nanwu Palace Master all of a sudden.

“Background?” The Life and Death Tower Master and Dongfang Clan Master were stunned.

“The Sword Alliance had risen at such a fast pace within only a couple of decades while Su Han is just a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God who isn’t really strong. How can he create such a strong Sword Alliance capable of competing against the pinnacle forces by himself in such a short time?” Nanwu Palace Master seriously raised his doubts.

“You mean that Su Han has people secretly supporting him?” Dongfang Clan Master slightly narrowed her eyes.

“That’s right. According to the news I received, the Sword Alliance already started building its own army when it was founded. Apart from that, the reason their strength grew so profoundly is that the Sword Alliance has a large number of resources. They gave much better offers—two to three times more compared to those offered by ordinary first-rated forces—to the experts they gathered.

“The reason so many experts are willing to join the Sword Alliance is because of their exceptional offers and is the reason the Sword Alliance manages to grow rapidly within such a short period. However, where did all these resources come from? It can’t be Su Han who obtained them by himself, right?” Nanwu Palace Master asked.

The Life and Death Tower Master and Dongfang Clan Master also nodded in agreement after hearing Nanwu Palace Master’s conjunction.

It was true that Su Han only had the strength of an ordinary Peak Heaven Ultimate God when he first gained a reputation in the Danyang Continent. The number of resources he owned when compared to his strength obviously meant somebody was secretly supporting him.

“However, who could be capable or should we say—who would spend so much resources to raise the Sword Alliance to become a pinnacle force? Could it be the Crimson Stone Fort?” The Life and Death Tower Master had a cold look in his eyes.

However, Nanwu Palace Master directly shook his head. “It can’t be the Crimson Stone Fort.

“If it’s the Crimson Stone Fort during its peak period when they had the Crimson Stone Saint supporting them, they might still be capable of supporting the rise of a pinnacle force. However, I’m sure you know of the current situation in the Crimson Stone Fort. They have such serious internal fights amongst their factions and suffer a huge consumption of assorted resources. Even Yun Shan—the person who’s in charge of various resources in the Crimson Stone Fort and the most wealthy among them all—isn’t capable of supporting the rise of a pinnacle force.

“It’s difficult for them to even support a single first-rated force. Apart from that, all of us know the temperament of Strange Old Tong, Jue Xin, An Ying, and Lan Junzhu. The current Crimson Stone Fort isn’t capable of coming up with better terms to move them. However, these people are obeying Sword Alliance’s Su Han right now.”

The Dongfang Clan Master suddenly asked, “If it isn’t the Crimson Stone Fort, who else is capable of supporting the Sword Alliance? Could it be...somebody from the outer realm?”

“Outer realm?” The Life and Death Tower Master also narrowed his eyes.

Nanwu Palace Master’s facial expression turned cold. “Nobody among the local forces in the Danyang Holy Domain is capable of raising a pinnacle force. There’s a huge possibility that the Sword Alliance’s supporter is a force from the outer realm.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The Life and Death Tower Master and Dongfang Clan Master’s facial expression darkened after they heard that.

The outer realm...

The Danyang Holy Domain was only one of the many realms within the Nine Realms of Golden Crow.

There were eight other realms around them on top of the Danyang Holy Domain.

Among those eight realms, some of the realms were bigger and wider than the Danyang Holy Domain which naturally meant they had more experts.

Even the weakest realm was comparable to the Danyang Holy Domain and there were without a doubt some extremely strong forces in those other eight realms.

The remaining eight realms differ from the Danyang Holy Domain as they still have Undying Saints supporting them. The forces they controlled were extremely powerful!!
