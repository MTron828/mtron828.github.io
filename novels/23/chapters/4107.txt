Chapter 4108: Red Light Filled the Sky

Jian Wushuang had already entered the Purple Temple, while Ruler Blood Wave and the dirty girl were waiting outside.

“This little guy must have a high level of life to be led by Ruler Blood Wave himself,” the dirty girl thought to herself. At the same time, she secretly glanced at Ruler Blood Wave, however, she noticed that Ruler Blood Wave had a calm, confident look on his face.

This confidence made the dirty maiden even more certain of what she was thinking.

“Right. We have a result.” The dirty maiden’s face lit up as she raised her head to look at the shrine in front of her.

!!

The towering violet shrine suddenly began to emit a dazzling red light.

This red light was like the setting sun, illuminating the surrounding void and causing it to turn red.

“Red light permeating the sky, it’s actually red light permeating the sky?” The dirty girl was shocked.

She had been guarding the purple shrine for a long time, during which a large number of special life forms came to the purple shrine to test their life levels, and the final result of the life test was no more than four types.

The first type was emitting white light, this white light represented an initial level life form, and this was the most mediocre among the special life forms.

The second type was a silver light, which represented a universe level special life form.

The third type was a cyan light, which represented a creation level life form. The denser the cyan light, the higher the level of a creation level life form.

The fourth type was the highest level, which was a perfect level life form. The light emitted by the Purple Temple was a red light!

Now, the Purple Temple was emitting a sky full of red light. Clearly, Jian Wushuang, who was being tested in the Purple Temple, was a perfect life-form!

“It’s actually a perfect level life-form!” The dirty girl’s expression was solemn. She immediately understood why Jian Wushuang was qualified to let one of the first Supreme-beings, Ruler Blood Wave, personally receive him.

A perfect level life-form was definitely a treasure for the Life Palace.

Under normal circumstances, it would be very difficult for a perfect life-form to be born within a hundred Chaos cycles in the vast universe.

Although the Life Palace was the base camp for all kinds of special life-forms, in reality, there were only three perfect life-forms in the Life Palace.

Two of these three were extremely ancient Rulers who had lived for countless years. Up until now, the one who had lived for more than a hundred chaos cycles was a Ruler at the Ultimate level. Although he was younger, he had lived for more than a hundred Chaos cycles. These three people held extremely high positions in the Life Palace, all three of them held extremely high positions in the Life Palace.

As for Jian Wushuang, he was the fourth perfect life-form in the Life Palace.

“When the red light appeared, those old guys must have been alarmed,” the dirty girl thought.

Indeed, although the red light did not cover a large area, there were countless experts in the Life Palace.

As soon as the red light appeared, quite a few experts in the Life Palace were startled and began to rush over at high speed.

Moments later, dozens of figures had gathered in front of the Purple Temple.

Nearly half of the figures were Rulers, and when they arrived, they saw Blood Wave.

“Ruler Blood Wave.”

“Greetings, Ruler Blood Wave.”

The experts all began to pay their respects.

Although they were all experts from the Life Palace, and there were quite a few Rulers present, Ruler Blood Wave was one of the Chief Supremes of the Life Palace. He was a Supreme Ruler, and so in terms of status and power…he was naturally a bit more powerful than the others present.

“Blood Wave.” Another person hurried over. This was a muscular man dressed in scarlet armor.

This muscular man carried an enormous mountain-cleaving axe on his back. His entire body was like an enormous axe, ready to cleave apart the heavens.

This muscular man was the only person present who could call Blood Wave by his name. Clearly, his status was not any lower than Blood Wave’s.

“Giant Axe, you’re here, too.” Ruler Blood Wave looked at the burly man.

“The red light represents a perfect life. I’m in the palace and not far from here, so I came to take a look.” The burly man smiled faintly and then looked at the Purple Temple in front of him, “Who is in the temple?”

“Supreme Axe, the one in the temple is a little guy named Jian Wushuang. Ruler Blood Wave personally brought him to the palace. The first time he came to the palace, his life was tested according to the principles, so this is what happened,” the dirty girl said.

“Blood Wave, did you bring him here yourself?” The strong man looked at Blood Wave. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Yes,” Blood Wave nodded with a smile. “More than 100,000 years ago, I saw this little guy in an ordinary level-three Star World. At that time, I knew he was a perfect life, so I contacted him and asked him to join my Life Palace. Not long ago, he came to the depths of the universe and sent a message to me, so I brought him to the palace,” Blood Wave said.

“You’ve brought in a perfect lifeform. Blood Wave, you’ve once again rendered a great service to the Life Palace,” the muscular man said with a laugh.

“Although the level of life is important, it is still unknown whether or not this little fellow will be able to become a Supreme expert in the future.” Blood Wave waved his hand.

But right at this moment…

“Eh?” Ruler Blood Wave and the muscular man both raised their heads as they sensed something.

The Purple Temple in front of them was glowing with red light. In the very center of the temple, a dazzling golden light suddenly began to shine.

“What? !”Ruler Blood Wave and the muscular man were both shocked.

“Golden Light? What’s Going On?”

“The sky is filled with red light. It’s true that it is a perfect lifeform, but why is it still glowing with golden light despite the Red Light?”

“So far, no one has detected a golden light in this purple shrine, right?”

“What’s going on?”

The expressions of the experts from the Life Palace became strange.

There were four different levels of special life forms, and they corresponded to four different lights. However, there was no golden light!

“It seems that this little guy’s life level is not as simple as a perfect life form.”The muscular man narrowed his eyes.

“He’s out,”Blood Wave said.

The door of the Purple Temple was opened again, and Jian Wushuang slowly walked out of it.

As soon as he walked out of the temple, Jian Wushuang immediately saw a large group of experts gathered in front of him. Each of these experts had extremely powerful auras, and the weakest one was at the Ultimate Ruler level, the aura of more than a dozen of them, which was invisible, shocked him.

Obviously, these people were all experts at the Supreme level.

Seeing this scene, Jian Wushuang could not help but be shocked.
