Chapter 2839: The Lowest Threshold

——

In the main hall of the castle, Lord Mo’s personal disciple Bi Yan was casually chatting with the imposing young man.

At this moment, Fan Xin walked in and whispered a few words into Bi Yan’s ear.

Bi Yan’s expression immediately changed and he became a little surprised.

Then he stood up and said apologetically, “Master Qu, I have something to take care of. Please wait here for a moment.”

“No problem.” The young man waved his hand, indicating that he did not care.

Bi Yan immediately walked toward the side hall with Fan Xin.

When they arrived at the side hall, Bi Yan immediately saw Jian Wushuang who was waiting quietly.

“Haha, you must be Mr. Sword One, right?” Bi Yan smiled and spoke in a gentle tone.

“Sword One greets Mr. Bi Yan,” Jian Wushuang bowed slightly.

Bi Yan was capable of becoming Lord Mo’s personal disciple. Jian Wushuang did not know about his weapon-refining level, but his strength was not weak. He had already reached the level of a Divine Master at the peak, he was much stronger than Fan Xin, who was only at the peak of the Divine Master Realm.

“I heard that you came here to ask Master to refine a magic weapon, and you also brought a 10,000-pound Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal?” Bi Yan looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and took out the Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal.

Bi Yan’s vision was much higher than Bi Yan’s. With just a glance at the Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal, he could instantly tell that it was a genuine Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal. Moreover, based on the size of the Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal, the Blood Wilderness Emperor crystal should weigh about 12,000 kilograms.

Bi Yan’s eyes immediately lit up.

“Junior brother Fan Xin, you can leave first. I’ll have a good chat with Mr. Sword One,” Bi Yan instructed.

“Yes.” Fan Xin nodded. He looked at the Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal with a burning gaze, but he still left directly.

Only Jian Wushuang and Bi Yan were left in the side hall.

“The Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal is one of the main materials used to refine holy treasures. It’s extremely rare. Usually, it’s rare to see a Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal that weighs more than 100 kilograms, and it requires a great opportunity. But the Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal in your hand weighs more than 10,000 kilograms...” Bi Yan could not help but sigh.

As a weapon refiner, what he yearned for the most were rare weapon refining materials.

Last time, Yin Su’er came to him and sold him a piece of Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal that weighed 230 catties, which made him quite happy.

Now, the Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal weighed more than 10,000 catties. Even he could not help but feel ecstatic.

“Mr. Sword One, the Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal in your hand is extremely valuable. If you are willing, you can sell it to my Fire Cloud Castle. I can buy it for 20 saint elixirs more than the market price. Your piece of Blood Wilderness Emperor crystal weighs 12,000 catties, so you can get 1,440,000 saint elixirs for it. I’ll give you another 10,000 saint elixirs. How about 1,450,000 Saint Elixirs?” Bi Yan said.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He had to admit that Bi Yan was very generous and offered a very high price.

Of course, this was mainly related to the great wealth of the Fire Cloud Castle. With the number one refiner in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, there were too many people who came to fire cloud castle to ask for refining weapons. Every time they refined weapons, Fire Cloud Castle could get a huge commission, after so many years of accumulation, the wealth of Fire Cloud Castle was terrifying.

Perhaps the wealth of Fire Cloud Castle was not as rich as the four pavilions, but it was not much worse.

“Mr. Bi Yan, Mr. Fan Xin should have told you just now. My purpose here is not to sell the Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal, but to ask Lord Mo to personally refine my magic weapon for me,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“I heard about it from junior brother Fan Xin, but with all due respect, I’m afraid it’s difficult for you to ask Master to refine your magic weapon for you,” Bi Yan said.

“Why?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“To tell you the truth, master has a very strange temper. Even if he wants to refine a magic weapon, it depends purely on his mood and preferences. As for the so-called 300,000 holy elixirs, it’s just a minimum threshold set by the master. His purpose is to stop some unnecessary visitors, but it’s just a minimum threshold. Even if you achieve it, it doesn’t mean that master will definitely refine a magic weapon for you.”

“Right now, besides you, there’s another person in Fire Cloud Castle. His father is a world overlord, and he brought 300,000 sacred elixirs to ask the master to refine a special treasure for him. But I think master will ignore him,” Bi Yan explained.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help but be speechless.

He could understand the hidden meaning behind Bi Yan’s words. Even the young master of a world lord took out 300,000 saint elixirs, but Lord Mo ignored him. He had no background and was only an Advanced Great Divine Master, how could he be taken seriously by Lord Mo?

“If that’s the case, how can I ask Lord Mo to help me?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“300,000 saint elixirs is the minimum requirement for the master to refine magic weapons or treasures. Secondly, it depends on the identity of the other party. If It’s the Immortal Saint, my master will give him some face. If It’s the powerful Immortal Saint, my master will give him a warm welcome. Long ago, Lord Bone Emperor personally visited my master and asked me to refine a treasure for him. When Lord Bone Emperor comes, my master will not dare to neglect him,” Bi Yan said.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly.

Bone Emperor... was the strongest expert in the nine realms of the Golden Crow. Who would dare to not give him face? Of course, Lord Mo would not dare to.

It was obvious that Lord Mo’s refining of treasures was largely determined by his strength and identity. This was normal. In the primordial divine world, experts were respected wherever they went. Only experts would receive sufficient respect.

“Other than that, there’s another possibility that master can personally take action. That is, the other party can take out a treasure that even my master is interested in. Or, the treasure that he refined has a certain degree of challenge to my master. Master will also take action.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Bi Yan continued, “The Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal that you are taking out is indeed very valuable. It is much more than the entire wealth of many immortal saints. However, with all due respect, even if you give this Blood Wilderness Emperor Crystal to master, he might not be interested. At his level, there aren’t many treasures in the Golden Crow Nine Realms that can truly make him interested.”
