Chapter 3971: Was He Dead or Not?

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“No, no!” Demon Cloud Star Master was extremely shocked.

The power that rose from the bamboo leaf made his body and heart tremble.

That power gathered crazily and finally condensed into a blade.

A huge, incomparably domineering blade that could split the sky and split the earth.

It was obvious that the fifth-level master who had refined the bamboo leaf was an expert who specialized in saber principle, and his saber technique should be extremely domineering. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The saber that appeared in front of Devil Cloud Star Master now only had part of the power of the fifth-level master, but it still had the power of god-slaying and demon-slaying.

“Devil Cloud Star Master, go to Hell!”

Jian Wushuang’s killing intent soared to the sky. Above the universe void, the extremely domineering blade slashed down fiercely at Devil Cloud Star Master.

Even someone as powerful as Devil Cloud Star Master did not have the courage to resist this blade.

“It’s too powerful. If I was at my peak, I might be able to survive this blade. But in my current state, if I take this blade…I’ll die!” Devil Cloud Star Master’s eyes widened.

At this moment, he did sense an unprecedented life-and-death crisis.

This life-and-death crisis was so intense that it was the first time it had appeared since he possessed the Divine Beginning Realm and became Devil Cloud Star Master.

Without a doubt, this blade was enough to kill him.

“No, I, Devil Cloud, have just broken through to the fourth level, and I have just received the recognition of the Great Cosmos Godly Palace. I have yet to roam the universe, and I haven’t even had the time to go to the depths of the universe to take a look. How can I die like this!?”

“No!”

“I can’t die, I can’t die!”

Devil Cloud Star Master roared crazily, his voice hysterical.

His face had been completely distorted, and his eyes were bloodshot. Just as the domineering blade was about to slash down, a violent power suddenly rose from Devil Cloud Star Master’s body.

Weng weng! Devil Cloud Star Master’s entire body had become crazy at this moment.

“Soul Burning!”

“It’s soul burning!”

“Devil Cloud Star Master used soul burning?”

Many experts who were watching the battle in the void were shocked by this scene.

Even Jian Wushuang, who was guiding the saber, was stunned.

Soul Burning…under normal circumstances, when there was no chance of survival, they would burn their souls desperately to make the other party pay the price.

Once a cultivator burned his soul, he could not stop under normal circumstances until his soul was completely burned.

In other words, this method was a sure-death method.

When Jian Wushuang was in the Eternal Dark Prison, he used the keepsake of the Red Cloud Lineage to suppress many experts. Many experts, after being suppressed by him, chose to burn their souls to commit suicide because they were unwilling to submit to him.

However, what Jian Wushuang did not expect was that Devil Cloud Star Master had chosen to burn his soul at this moment.

Could it be that he thought that he would definitely die under this saber strike, so he made such a choice?

However, the domineering saber had not really slashed down, and its power had not been fully revealed. Was it not a little too early to burn his soul?

Although Jian Wushuang was puzzled, the speed and power of the domineering saber did not weaken at all.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

The saber light fought mercilessly. The entire universe void was split in half, and a huge space crack hung in the air like a Milky Way.

The saber light had completely engulfed the Devil Cloud Star Master, and its terrifying power completely covered him.

Sizzle! Sizzle! Sizzle!

The sound of divine power squeezing and colliding was heard. After a while, the power of the saber was completely exhausted and dissipated.

The universe void gradually regained its calm.

Jian Wushuang had also stopped burning his divine power and appeared at the edge of the battlefield.

Although it had only been a short time since he had attacked, he had used all his trump cards during this period of time, he had been using the dragon-killing secret skill all this time. He had also used the Divine Devil Heaven Suppressing Formation and his wave light sword formation to consume Devil Cloud Star Master’s divine power.

Although Devil Cloud Star Master’s divine power had been consumed by nearly 40%, he had also consumed a lot of his own divine power.

By now, Jian Wushuang’s aura had also weakened a lot. He had less than 50% of his divine power left, but he did not care about his state at all. Instead, he raised his head and stared at the void in front of him.

“Is Devil Cloud Star Master dead?” Jian Wushuang murmured softly.

He was not the only one. The Rulers from the Divine Beginning Realm and the Devil Cloud Star Master’s side were also staring at the void.

They were also waiting for a result.

Buzz! The remaining energy in the void completely dissipated, and the shattered universe void recovered.

After everything calmed down, a figure slowly appeared in front of everyone’s eyes.

The appearance of this figure caused all the experts in the Divine Beginning Realm to narrow their eyes.

“He’s not dead?”

“He used soul burning, but he’s still alive?”

“How is it possible? How is it possible that he’s still alive?”

“It’s impossible!”

The Rulers in the Divine Beginning Realm screamed.

Daoist Xuan God, Temporal Temple Master, Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master, and Heaven Ancestor were extremely excited just now. When they saw Devil Cloud Star Master burning his soul, they almost thought that Devil Cloud Star Master was dead for sure. But now, this figure appeared, they almost had a mental breakdown.

“He’s not dead yet?” Even Jian Wushuang was in disbelief at this moment.

Devil Cloud Star Master was not at the perfect level of life like himself. His soul could be recovered by divine power. When he used soul burning, he should have died.

But in the end…

“I survived. Haha! I did survive.” Devil Cloud Star Master laughed wildly.

“I have to thank the Cosmos Temple. If it wasn’t for its unique soul burning secret skill, I would have died.”

“But now…I survived. Haha! I, Devil Cloud, deserve to live. I won’t die here.”

Devil Cloud Master laughed like a madman.

Jian Wushuang fell silent after hearing Devil Cloud Master’s words.

“The hall of Yu the great? A unique soul burning secret skill?” Jian Wushuang immediately understood.

Devil Cloud Master did not die just now because he had a unique soul burning secret skill. It could burn one’s soul and produce terrifying strength in a short period of time, however, it could stop the soul burning midway to ensure that Devil Cloud Master’s soul would not be completely destroyed.
