Chapter 1588: All Parties Shocked

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

There were many solo experts where the battle in Burning Demon Region took place. Hence, the news about the battle couldn’t be contained even if they wanted it to be.

After the battle ended, it immediately spread at a terrifying speed, like wildfire.

Especially the mirror image of the battle…

The mirror image recorded clearly that Jian Wushuang had massacred many Real Gods of Four Symbol Mansion with his power of Universe God. There was even a scene where he had suppressed an Eternal Real God.

As the image spread, whichever experts saw the images were astonished.

“There were almost forty Void Real Gods that hemmed in a Universe God at the same time, but they were massacred instead?”

“This, this… how could it be?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Is he really just a Universe God? In the history of Eternal Chaotic World, was there any Universe God this scary?”

Everyone found it unbelievable.

Vientiane Tower even amended and announced the latest Universe God ranking list at the first instant. As Jian Wushuang had lost all his power previously, his name was removed from the Universe God ranking list long ago.

But then, when the new Universe God ranking list was announced, he was listed in the first place directly.

There was no doubt about the ranking. Everyone found it right and reasonable.

Even though he had never fought against God Destroying King, who was in the first place, from the terrifying power and the result that he displayed in the battle at Burning Demon Region, he was far beyond God Destroying King. After all, although God Destroying King was a top genius, he couldn’t fight against an Eternal Real God head-on, let alone corner him.

“Monster!”

“Monstrosity!”

“In the history of the entire Eternal Chaotic World, he is a superb monster that is hard to come by.”

All kinds of names were given to Jian Wushuang, and Jian Wushuang became a synonym for monster.

However, Four Symbol Mansion also spread other news.

Jian Wushuang was an inverse cultivator!

The news was simple, but it was like a stone that created thousands of ripples. The higher-ups and experts in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, even a number of Almighties were startled by the news.

The higher-ups and experts were all knowledgeable and they quickly determined that the news was a fact!

They could tell from the power that Jian Wushuang displayed and also from the incident where he lost all his power temporarily.

Jian Wushuang was no doubt a true inverse cultivator.

Only the legendary inverse cultivator could possess such unbelievable power at the stage of Universe God.

Inverse cultivator!

The Eternal Chaotic World was the scariest and most unique existence.

They were born to go against the world, they were born to be different.

The potential of an inverse cultivator was far beyond an ordinary cultivator.

If it was an inverse cultivator who had yet to pass through inverse cultivation tests, they might not need to be worried. After all, inverse cultivation tests were the biggest threshold as an inverse cultivator. Among ten inverse cultivators, there might not even be one who could pass through. But once he passed through three inverse cultivation tests, his potential… would be unboundedly great!

Sky Sword Mountain, under the nine lofty sword mountains, in the secretive cave dwelling.

“Haha, Jian Wushuang is an inverse cultivator?”

The owner of Sky Sword Mountain, who carried three swords on his back, looked just like an enduring, fierce sword. He received the news and let out a hearty laugh.

“An Inverse cultivator, and one who already passed all inverse cultivation tests. Such potential… another Wu Bei!”

“Back when Wu Bei rose up at an unbelievably fast speed, he shocked all Almighties in Eternal Chaotic World. It is a pity that there was an unexpected incident that led him to his deathbed. Otherwise… Unless the few Almighties from Sanctuary Alliance teamed up, in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, there wouldn’t have been anyone who could have made him yield.”

“Jian Wushuang seems to be even more outstanding than when Wu Bei was a Universe God.”

The owner of Sky Sword Mountain complimented as he smiled.

He was involved with Jian Wushuang and could just about say that they shared a relationship. Hence, he naturally was delighted to see Jian Wushuang’s growth.

…

In a crimson territory, there was an overlord. He was Huo You.

Not only was Huo You an Almighty, but he was also considered one who was extremely strong among the Almighties. He could be on an equal footing as the founder of Lineage of Star, Star Palace Master.

“Haha, Star Palace old man, I followed our agreement and never exposed the young man’s identity. In the end, he was the one who exposed himself. I can’t be blamed.”

In the lofty crimson hall, Huo You, who had a unicorn on his forehead, laughed wantonly.

“Tsk tsk. An inverse cultivator and he passed through all inverse cultivation tests. Lineage of Star has obtained an impressive little guy.”

…

It was a dark, starry night. There was a piece of dark land floating in the starry night.

In the dark land, there were lofty mountains and all the mountains were hundreds of thousands of zhang high. Even the smaller ones were more than ten thousand zhang high.

Right in the middle of the countless mountains, there was a dark palace in the air.

In the spacious hall, a figure in a black robe suddenly appeared in the hall. He shouted anxiously, “There’s an important report.”

On both sides of the hall, guards who were engulfed in the dim light immediately looked at the figure in black robe. There were some who glanced with a furious gaze.

“What report makes you so anxious?”

A low yet hoarse voice reverberated in the hall. The voice was coming from all directions but no one knew where the person who was speaking was.

The figure in a black robe had already knelt down and looked politely at the empty throne right in front of the hall, “Master, I have received the news that the genius Jian Wushuang, who was removed from the must-kill name list in our tribe previously, his power has recovered. Not only did he recover his power, but he has also become even stronger than before.”

“With his power as a Universe God, he suppressed an Eternal Real God. Vientiane Tower in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries listed him on the first place on Universe God ranking list. On top of that, I receive a piece of credible news that Jian Wushuang is an inverse cultivator. The reason he lost all his power entirely was that he was in the progress of passing through his third inverse cultivation power. Now, he has already passed through it.”

“Inverse cultivator?” The hoarse voice spoke again, “An inverse cultivator who has already passed inverse cultivation tests and suppressed an Eternal Real God with his power as Universe God?”

“Isn’t this Jian Wushuang more monstrous than Real God Wu Bei back then?”

“Yes,” the figure in a black robe nodded continuously, “Many experts in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, including the Almighties said that Jian Wushuang could totally be compared favorably with Real God Wu Bei or even surpass Real God Wu Bei and be compared favorably with the few higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance.

“No way!”

A low bellow suddenly burst through the dark hall.

“Real God Wu Bei is within the range that our tribe can accept, but the few higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance… Such experts, any extra headcount can increase Sanctuary Alliance’s power tremendously. We definitely can’t let Jian Wushuang have a chance to reach that level!”

“Send down my command. Immediately list Jian Wushuang in the top must-kill name list.”
