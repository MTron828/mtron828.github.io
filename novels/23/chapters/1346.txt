Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Duan Lingfeng and Jian Wushuang talked for a long time in the spaceship.

Jian Wushuang felt happy to be exchanging ideas with Duan Lingfeng, a real genius.

And it was also a pleasure for Duan Lingfeng to make friends with Jian Wushuang.

The spaceship kept traveling through the Ancient Star Sea.

The Ancient Star Sea was full of dangers, in which there were beasts much more scary and violent than the Purple Martens Jian Wushuang’s team had met.

But the team was powerful enough, especially with the top talent, Duan Lingfeng, to tackle any problems or dangers.

The forty years passed quickly.

Jian Wushuang’s team finally arrived at the verge of the Ancient Star Sea.

“We are already at the verge of the Ancient Star Sea. I guess we can leave here within one month!

“Finally. I have been feeling nervous along the way.”

“We are all terrified!”

“We couldn’t survive without Duan Lingfeng being here.”

Everyone was talking happily.

After all, they thought they could got free of the anxiety and fear that they had been feeling all day and all night in the past forty years.

However, they didn’t realize that at the peak of the mountain that they were heading for, a black-robed man felt them coming and opened his eyes.

The black-robed man said, “I feel a calling, a very strong calling.”

“Who is giving me that calling?”

The black-robed man stood up and looked around.

He looked in the direction from which the spaceship came and went into ecstasy.

“It’s my prey!”

“A very delicious prey for which I have a crazily strong desire!”

“I could have a feast today!”

Then the black-robed man transformed into a spirit and flew toward the spaceship.

“Come on, my prey!”

“I am coming!”

…

And passengers in the spaceship had no idea of what was happending.

Jian Wushuang was sitting on the deck of the spaceship with a flagon beside him, watching a young talent practicing swordsmanship.

The young talent was Luo Hai, who had grown up.

Within forty years, the gifted Luo Hai had improved his swordsmanship a lot by studying in the Ancient Star Sea and also with the help of elixirs given to him by Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng.

Shoo!

Luo Hai waved his sword, producing a dazzling light.

Soon Luo Hai stopped his exercises and the light disappeared.

“Brother Wushuang, what do you think of the swordsmanship I have created?” Luo Hai asked Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang said, “Not bad. As you have already created your own Sword Principle, you can develop your swordsmanship based on it so that you can unleash the potential power of your Sword Principle.”

“Thank you, brother Wushuang. Can I follow you as your disciple? I have really improved a lot with your help!”

“My disciple?”

Luo Yu and Duan Lingfeng also looked at them.

Jian Wushuang shook his head, smiling, “I am not qualified actually.”

Luo Hai was a little disappointed, but he didn’t continue the conversation.

Bang!

Suddenly, a very strong consciousness attack hit every one in the spaceship.

Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng frowned.

Other Universe Gods also felt alarmed and looked in the direction of the attack.

Shoo!

A black-robed man appeared at the front of the deck and intercepted the spaceship.

Everyone in the crowd was now looking at the man through the barrier.

“Only a man?”

“He comes here alone intending to intercept us?”

“He seems to be powerful…”

Everyone in the crowd was discussing it.

The team leader in the spaceship, Yu Shan, asked politely, “Is there anything that we could help you with?”

Yu Shan felt that the man was at least at the level of Universe Gods in the Third Heaven. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Haha!”

The black-robed man didn’t pay much attention to Yu Shan but stared at only one man on the spaceship while wearing a cunning and vicious smile.

He was looking at Jian Wushuang!

“You are my prey now!”

The black-robed man murmured, licking his lips.

He was extremely excited.

His face turned red and his eyes were full of craziness.

“What wonderful prey you are!”

“That blood of his smells so good!”

The black-robed man’s voice was heard by members on the spaceship.

They frowned, feeling the coming danger.

Jian Wushuang was also alarmed.

He had already felt the craziness in the man’s eyes.

Obviously, the black-robed man was coming for him.

King of Venomous Worms said to Jian Wushuang, “You are in danger now. I think that man is from the Sky-devouring Clan.

“Sky-devouring Clan!” Jian Wushuang was reminded immediately of two Sky-devouring Clan descendants he met in his hometown of the Green Fire World.

They Patriarch of Empyrean Glory and his son Emperor Yan!

He had heard from King of Venomous Worms about the Sky-devouring Clan.
