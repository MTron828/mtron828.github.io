“A good staff?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

“The Killing Bead.” Gu King replied.

Jian Wushuang immediately looked at the Killing Bead.

“The Killing Bead is worth 100 Fire Points?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

There were abundant treasures in the Fire Point Exchange Office. Most of them were priceless, so they were worth a lot Fire Points.

The treasure worth only 100 Fire Points was at the bottom of the list.

“The Killing Bead is a treasure?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course it’s a treasure. It’s just so cheap that the Treasure Vault has misjudged its value. Besides, the Killing Bead will be of great use to you,” Gu King said.

“It will be useful?” Jian Wushuang was delighted. “Exchange it for me right now.”

“Take it easy. The Killing Bead is peculiar, and nobody in the Green Fire World knows how to use it. Otherwise, a treasure like this would have already been sold out. Ask people outside how to get Fire Points first, and then come alone to exchange it after some time,” Gu King said.

“Ok.” Jian Wushuang nodded and then wasted no more time lingering at that place.

After he got out of the Fire Point Exchange Office, the Celestial Master Yu Ding caught up with him.

“Jian Wushuang, how’sit going? Have you found any desirable treasure?” Celestial Master Yu Ding smiled.

“I did find a desirable treasure, but I don’t have any Fire Points.” Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly, and then he asked, “Celestial Master Yu Ding, do you know how to get Fire Points?”

“Fire Points come from bartering.” Celestial Master Yu Ding explaine., “You can take your treasure to the Fire Point Exchange Office for appraisal by the spirit, and he will tell you the value of the treasure. You canexchange it for 70 percent of its value.”

“For instance, if a treasure is worth 1,000 Fire Points, you can only get 700 fire points if you sell it to the Fire Point Exchange Office.

“This is the only way to get Fire Points.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang understood. He thought to himself,?“When I killed Dao Yuanzi, all of his treasures became mine. Most of them are of great value, and I don’t need them all. If I barter those treasures for Fire Points, how many can I get?”

“Jian Wushuang, shall we depart? Let me take you to the place of opportunity,” Celestial Master Yu Ding said.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

The battlefield where Green Fire World was located was full of opportunities.

Jian Wushuang did not expect much from the three Secret Lands. However, there was an opportunity that every expert of the Green Fire Palace could get.

Following Celestial Master Yu Ding, Jian Wushuang arrived in front of a wormhole.

“Wormhole?” Jian Wushuang had a weird expression.

“The opportunity is in the battlefield, which is far from Green Fire Palace. If traveling by foot, it would take more than a decade to get there. It would save much time to use the wormhole.” Celestial Master Yu Ding smiled.

Jian Wushuang followed Celestial Master Yu Ding and entered the wormhole without hesitation.

As a light flashed, Jian Wushuang reappeared. He was now in a lofty palace.

The palace was resplendent and magnificent. Jian Wushuang was in a corridor of the palace.

“Where is this?” Jian Wushuang frowned at the surroundings.

“It is Tai Qing Palace, and the opportunity is right here. Just follow me.” Celestial Master Yu Ding led the way with a smile on his face.

Soon, Jian Wushuang arrived at the center of the palace. There was a vast hall. There were four tall figures in the center of the hall and a huge censer.

“Are they Puppet Fighters?” Jian Wushuang looked at the four tall figures towering in the center of the hall.

“Jian Wushuang, did you see the four sticks of incense around the censer?” Celestial Master Yu Ding pointed his finger at it.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. He also noticed that there were four sticks of incense with different sizes on the table beside the censer.

The four sticks of incense were laid side by side from the largest to the smallest.

Jian Wushuang could also sense that the four sticks of incense were extraordinary.

“It should be the Soul-leading Incense?” Gu King said in a shocked voice.

“What is the Soul-leading Incense?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The soul-leading Incense is a treasure that contributes greatly to cultivation. It could help people find inner peace and upgrade the speed of meditation.” Gu King answered. “Although it’s not complicated to refine the Soul-leading Incense, the materials required are rare and of great value. Few people could use the Soul-leading Incense all the time while cultivating even if they are in the Eternal Chaotic World. It’s too extravagant.

“Of course, the Soul-leading Incense will be of some use to you.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang nodded to himself.

“Jian Wushuang, there are four sticks of Soul-leading Incense on the table, and their sizes vary,” Celestial Master Yu Ding said.

“The smallest one could burn for two hours after being lit!

“The second smallest Soul-leading Incense could keep burning for a day!

“The third one could burn for a whole month.

“As for the biggest Soul-leading Incense, it could burn for a year!”

“Every expert of the Green Fire Palace is eligible to get one Soul-leading Incense. However, it is up to your ability which one you get.”

“Do you see the four Puppet Fighters in front of you? It is they who will decide which Soul-leading Incense you get. There will be a battle between you and them. The longer you hold on, the bigger the Soul-leading Incense you would get.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jian Wushuang understood after hearing what Celestial Master Yu Ding said.

“Let’s start,” said Celestial Master Yu Ding as he retreated from the hall.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath, proceeding slowly. As he arrived at the center of the hall, the four towering Puppet Fighters opened their eyes immediately and were ready to fight.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

The four Puppet Fighters moved simultaneously and attacked Jian Wushuang from different directions.

Jian Wushuang was being very cautious since he had no idea of their strength. He swept his hand that was holding the Blood Mountain Sword.

A drifting sword light came out.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

The sword light struck the four Puppet Fighters, causing a crisp sound as if it had hit the metal. The four Puppet Fighters were sent flying out immediately.

“That’s all they’ve got?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Jian Wushuang, if I’m not mistaken, the level of the four Puppet Fighters will depend on your own Realm. Since you are only at the Eternal Realm, they treat you as someone at the Eternal Realm. However, their strength will increase gradually,” Gu King said.

“I see.”

Jian Wushuang grinned and then waved the Blood Mountain Sword as he approached the four Puppet Fighters.
