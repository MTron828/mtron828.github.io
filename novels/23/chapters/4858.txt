4862 Annihilate the Celestial Region

The Yan Immortal named Song Xin was beheaded by Jian Wushuang and his Immortal Source was shattered.

This was like the final beginning, marking the ultimate defeat of the revenge of the Heavenly Sects in the Celestial Region.

A total of 72 Yan Immortals from the Celestial Region, none of them survived, all of them perished.

With the death of Yan Immortals, the top cultivators from the Celestial Region all fled, fighting to be the first to escape into the teleportation array.

The broken void was covered with broken Immortal corpses and divine blood.

Standing in front of the Immortal array formation, Jian Wushuang stopped.

The Young Emperor, who was covered in divine blood, came to his side, his chest heaving.

Chen Qing, Chun Qiu, Cui Jing, Wei Liujia, and the others also rushed over, all in a sorry state.

The Young Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang, who was standing still, and he understood something.

After a moment, he said softly, “Brother Jian, it wasn’t my intention to destroy the Celestial Region, but when Zhang Tian returns, he will definitely side with Prince Jiu. I’m afraid that the Six Heavens Realm will end up like the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture.”

“The beginning of this battle means that it will not end well.”

After a long while, Jian Wushuang said, “Let’s go.”

The teleportation Immortal array formation built by the Celestial Region’s Heavenly Sects could teleport tens of thousands of top cultivators at a time and was extremely stable.

When the remaining top cultivators of the Celestial Region fled back to the Celestial Region in a sorry state, they did not know that a doomsday had quietly come.

As the first Yan Immortal from the Six Heavens Realm stepped into the Celestial Region, the cold-blooded killing began.

Blood and fire erupted in the Celestial Region that spanned nearly ten Super Heavenly Regions.

Countless living beings were crushed into dust by the Yan Immortals.

The Heavenly Plates were destroyed, and the mountains and rivers were cut off.

Dark clouds loomed in the sky, and the sky began to rain.

There were nearly ten Super Heavenly Regions, including nearly 100 Heavenly Planes. Each plane was a world.

And in the aftermath of this battle, everything was shattered.

Chen Qing held a True Sword and destroyed a Heavenly Region all by himself.

However, Chun Qiu, Cui Jing, and Wei Liujia did not make a move. Instead, they stood quietly behind Jian Wushuang.

The entire Celestial Region’s Heavenly Sects were being destroyed rapidly.

Located on top of a tall divine mountain in the clouds, there was a quiet and secluded hall. It was the most mysterious place in the entire Celestial Region’s Heavenly Sect, and it was the Dao Field of the entire sect.

However, it was already chaotic.

“Sect Master, let’s go. We have to leave quickly and seek refuge with the Second Prince!”

“As long as there’s life, there’s hope. Rather than living and dying with the Celestial Region, it’s better to leave as soon as possible and make plans!”

In the dim hall, more than ten Elders were anxiously discussing the figure that was half-lying in the hall.

That figure was Zhang Tian, who had escaped back to the Celestial Region. At this moment, he seemed to have aged to another state, and his eyelids were drooping.

After a long while, he said in a hoarse voice, “You guys can leave first. I’ll be there soon.”

All the Elders stopped talking. They looked at Zhang Tian with similar looks, but also uncertainties.

“Let’s go, it’ll be too late if we don’t.”

“Then Sect Master… We’ll go ahead first and be the vanguard for you.”

…

When the dark hall returned to silence, Zhang Tian slowly raised his eyes and looked outside the hall.

Six figures appeared and slowly stepped into the hall.

Jian Wushuang and the Young Emperor walked in front and finally stood in front of him.

A sneer flashed in his eyes. “I really didn’t expect that the son of the Emperor would be so ruthless to a Heavenly Sect in the Celestial Region. You are indeed vengeful.”

“You only have yourself to blame for all of this. You should have expected this to happen when you started a war against me.”

“But is the price reasonable? It’s too heavy! You shouldn’t have destroyed my entire Celestial Region!” Zhang Tian said dejectedly. “I will destroy my Immortal Source now in exchange for the Celestial Region’s safety. How about it?”

The Young Emperor slowly squatted down and looked at him. He said slowly, “You must die. As for the Celestial Region, I will make it an existence that will not be a threat.”

Zhang Tian shuddered and closed his eyes as if he had accepted his fate. “Prince Yan, remember what I said. One day, you’ll make the same mistake as me!”

Jian Wushuang slowly turned around and walked out of the hall, no longer looking at the scene.

The Sect Master of a Heavenly Sect, Zhang Tian, had unraveled his Immortal Source and died.

The Young Emperor stood up and turned around. He looked at Jian Wushuang with a complicated expression in his eyes.

With more than 40 Yan Immortals and countless Ancestor-level cultivators, the Heavenly Sects of the Celestial Region, which included nearly ten Heavenly Regions, had become a dead land and no longer posed any threat.

Walking on the scorched earth, Jian Wushuang did not say a word.

Just as they were about to leave, a half-grown figure suddenly ran out from a dilapidated wall. She was trembling, but she still stood firmly in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Did you… Did you destroy this place? did you kill my father?”

Chen Qing was about to wave his hand to disperse the dusty little girl, but he was stopped by Jian Wushuang.

Then he bent over slightly and looked at the little girl who was trying her best not to let her tears fall. He asked, “What’s your name?”

The little girl took half a step back and sniffed hard. “I won’t tell you. If I do, I’ll be killed.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “You have to remember that my name is Jian Wushuang. If you want to take revenge for what happened today, you can find me.”

After he finished speaking, he took Cheng Qing and the others and left the Celestial Region that had already been reduced to scorched earth. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Standing in the middle of the ruins, the little girl stared at Jian Wushuang’s back without blinking, as if she was trying to imprint all his characteristics into her mind.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ll remember this. I’ll definitely kill you with my own hands in the future!”

…

When the Immortal array formation that connected the Six Heavens Realm was destroyed, the bloody battle ended.

There were more than 60 Yan Immortals under the Young Emperor, but they only lost about 20. This was a great victory, and compared to that Heavenly Sect, the losses were almost negligible.

The victory was won so quickly by Jian Wushuang’s power alone.

According to the Young Emperor’s previous plan, the 100 Yan Immortals under him would have been almost wiped out, and they would not have been able to crush the Heavenly Sects in the Celestial Region.

However, everything changed the moment Jian Wushuang joined the battle.

He had almost eliminated a dangerous place with minimal losses. This was undoubtedly adding fuel to the fire for Prince Jiu who was far away in the Great Mi Heaven.

…

In the Heavenly Palace, on the roof.

The Young Emperor sat on the glazed tiles, looking somewhere.

A skinny purple-robed figure appeared behind him.

“Da Ban, the results are pretty good, but I’m a little worried.”
