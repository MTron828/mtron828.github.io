On the ancient battlefield, in a spacious place, Sir God Xue Dao with crimson hair in a crimson robe was standing there quietly. There was a cold-looking middle-aged man next to him.

“Xue Dao, when we see them later, what should you say, what should you do, you should know pretty well. There’s no need for me to teach you, right?” The cold-looking middle-aged man, Emperor God Shi Yu said.

“Don’t worry. I have prepared,” Sir God Xue Dao smiled.

The two of them didn’t wait for long.

Vroom. There was a breeze. Then, there was a figure that appeared in front of the two of them.

She was taller than five meters and her body was curvy. On her beautiful face, there was an indescribable coldness and elegance.

She stood there and the universe naturally focused on her.

“Greetings, Mister.”

“Xue Dao greets Great Emperor Colored Glaze.”

Looking at the incomer, Sir God Xue Dao and Emperor God Shi Yu immediately bowed and greeted.

Color Glazed Emperor, the Master of Colored Glaze Sanctuary!

One of the Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance, in sixth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme Ranking List!

Great Emperor Colored Glaze looked cold. Her pair of eyes, which were cold and without any emotion, looked down.

“Sir God Xue Dao, you should know that I have also been busy searching for opportunities in the ancient battlefield all these years. It is because you are an expert born in Colored Glaze Sanctuary and because Shi Yu recommended you, that’s why I am seeing you now. I hope whatever that you are going to tell me gives you the privilege to see me. Otherwise...”

Great Emperor Colored Glaze didn’t need to finish her sentence. It was already sufficient to make Sir God Xue Dao quiver in fear.

A Great Emperor usually doesn’t get angry, but when they do, they could easily kill an Emperor God. Let alone him, a not-so-famous Sir God, who just broke through not too long ago.

“Xue Dao, tell her everything that you know clearly,” Emperor God Shi Yu exhorted.

Sir God Xue Dao took a deep breath and said solemnly, “Great Emperor Colored Glaze, first, I have to tell you something. The person who spread the news about this ancient battlefield to Eternal Chaotic World was I!”

“Huh?” Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s beautiful eyes froze.

Emperor God Shi Yu by the side also looked at Sir God Xue Dao in shock.

He was only in charge of recommending Sir God Xue Dao, he didn’t know what Sir God Xue Dao wanted to tell Great Emperor Colored Glaze.

“So what if you are the one who spread the news?” Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s eyes remained cold, “If you were to tell me the news at the first instant but not spread it entirely, I would have rewarded you abundantly. However, now... Everyone in the world knows about the ancient battlefield, so it doesn’t matter who the person who spread the news was.”

“Doesn’t matter? No, no, Great Emperor Colored Glaze. Although I didn’t inform you about the ancient battlefield on the first instance, I found you right now naturally because I have absolute confidence in you to... I know where the biggest opportunity in this ancient battlefield lies!” Sir God Xue Dao said.

“Biggest opportunity?” Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s eyes dilated in shock.

Ninety years had not yet passed since the birth of ancient battlefield. There was a large amount of opportunity that had been found, including the four cave dwellings left behind by experts in ancient times. Although the four cave dwellings were attractive to her, a Great Emperor, everyone knew that the cave dwellings weren’t the biggest opportunity, even though they were pretty impressive.

No one would know of the biggest opportunity if one didn’t spend a certain amount of time to find and flip the ancient battlefield upside down to search for it.

But then, Sir God Xue Dao said that he knew of the biggest opportunity in the ancient battlefield?

“Tell me then. What is the biggest opportunity?” Great Emperor Colored Glaze looked down at Sir God Xue Dao.

“Green Fire World!” Sir God Xue Dao spat three words heavily.

Great Emperor Colored Glaze and Emperor God Shi Yu were confused.

“Xue Dao, what Green Fire World? Tell me clearly,” Emperor God Shi Yu said in a deep voice.

Sir God Xue Dao smiled faintly and started telling her the ins and outs.

“Green Fire World is a big world!”

“However, it is located at the core location on the ancient battlefield. It was nurtured by the ancient battlefield over the years!”

“In other words, it’s just like a child that the ancient battlefield raised and it is just like a newborn baby. It has boundless possibilities!”

“Its value is far more precious by a few folds than a sanctuary in Eternal Chaotic World. Actually, forget about a sanctuary, even if the ten sanctuaries were added up, they couldn’t even be one tenth of its value!”

“Whoever can conquer Green Fire World, the person will become the number one overlord in Eternal Chaotic World over the years. He could even rely on Green Fire World to constantly give birth to experts and build a brand new Sanctuary Alliance!”

Whatever Sir God Xue Dao said, some he heard from Emperor God Xie Xin.

Some, he took some wild guesses.

However, whatever he said clarified the unlimited possibility and value that Green Fire World had.

Great Emperor Colored Glaze couldn’t stay composed any longer after hearing what he had said.

“Xue Dao, are you serious? The ancient battlefield really nurtured a big world? And it really has such great potential?” Great Emperor Colored Glaze looked down at him and her eyes were filled with absolute might. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Yes, Great Emperor. Green Fire World does exist, there is no doubt about it. As for its actual value, although I made the guess myself, I believe you can evaluate for yourself. The ancient battlefield is amazing, so the big world that the ancient battlefield has nurtured, just how amazing could it be?”

“Most importantly, just how intense is the spiritual influence of heaven and earth in this ancient battlefield and how amazing is this cultivation environment? Plus, Green Fire World is located right at the core and its cultivation environment would be the best location in the entire battlefield. If someone were to conquer Green Fire World and the cultivators in Green Fire World had resources and guidance, just how great could Green Fire World be if one were to lead them in their cultivation and growth?”

“These points that I stated, are they not realistic?” Sir God Xue Dao asked solemnly.

Great Emperor Colored Glaze kept quiet.

She was a Geat Emperor and there weren’t many things that could make her excited and enthusiastic. However, the battlefield was doing it.

Then, Green Fire World that Sir God Xue Dao was talking about, the big world... If it was really as Sir God Xue Dao said, it absolutely had the ability to make her go mad!

“That’s not right. If Green Fire World were to really have that potential and you were the first who found the ancient battlefield and Green Fire World, you could totally conquer it on your own. Why do you want to expose this ancient battlefield to the public and tell me about Green Fire World?” Great Emperor Colored Glaze asked coldly.

“Great Emperor, to be frank with you, I wasn’t the first one who found this ancient battlefield. The first one who found it was my senior, Emperor God Xie Xin,” Sir God Xue Dao replied politely, “Just as you mentioned, Emperor God Xie Xin found out about Green Fire World and he wanted to conquer Green Fire World at the first instant. However, he met a person in Green Fire World.”

“Who?” Great Emperor Colored Glaze looked.

“Sword Emperor, Jian Wushuang!!!”
