Chapter 1882: Jealous

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Outside Emperor Sword Palace, Emperor Sword Sect Master and the others were waiting patiently.

After Jian Wushuang and the others came out from Emperor Sword Palace, they went forward to greet them.

Not long after Jian Wushuang and the others had exited Emperor Sword Palace, the entrance to Emperor Sword Palace closed. The next opening would be another one million years later.

“Gu Deng, has there been any incident in Emperor Sword Palace in the past one thousand years?” Emperor Sword Sect Master looked at a young man in a red robe.

The young man in the red robe, Real God Gu Deng, entered Emperor Sword Palace with Jian Wushuang and Luo Xianzi.

“During the one thousand years of comprehension, nothing happened. But in the end…” Real God Gu Deng reported to Emperor Sword Sect Master in all honesty.

“What? King Swords recognized Jian Wushuang as their owner and he rejected them?” The people from Emperor Sword Sect were shocked.

Emperor Sword Sect Master was staring into the void as unprecedented jealousy burnt.

One should know that King Swords’ owner recognition was a great opportunity.

In the history of Emperor Sword Sect, there was only the founder, his master, who had received a King Sword. With the King Sword, the founder of Emperor Sword Sect was extremely scary. If it were to be in the current times, he could absolutely be in the top twenty in Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. He might not even be too far off from the number one Emperor God, Underworld God.

It was a pity that the founder of Emperor Sword Sect had passed away because of a danger he had come across when he was wandering in Ancient Mystery Land many years ago.

Then, he took control of Emperor Sword Sect. However, in terms of power, opportunities, or even disposition, he was far behind his master.

He had taken control of Emperor Sword Sect for so many years, the power of Emperor Sword Sect didn’t get stronger but weaker instead.

As for King Swords in Emperor Sword Palace… His desire to get King Swords was far higher than anyone else’s.

He wanted to reach the level of his master through King Swords’ owner recognition, but it was a pity that he had failed countless times in Emperor Sword Palace.

But Jian Wushuang… King Swords took the initiative to recognize him as the owner but he had rejected them?

Emperor Sword Sect Master was, of course, jealous.

Of course, no matter how jealous he was, Emperor Sword Sect Master didn’t dare to show it.

“Sword Emperor, Luo Xianzi, Emperor Sword Palace is closed and it will be opened again in another million years. I wonder if the two of you would like to stay in Emperor Sword Sect or…” Emperor Sword Sect Master asked humbly.

“There are many things to be taken care of in Lineage of Star. I shall not trouble you further,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“I shall leave too,” Luo Xianzi looked cold.

“If so, I shall send the two of you off,” Emperor Sword Sect Master was extremely courteous.

Jian Wushuang and Luo Xianzi didn’t stay and left Emperor Sword Sect as Emperor Sword Sect Master saw them off.

In the void outside Emperor Sword Sect, Jian Wushuang and Luo Xianzi stood side by side.

“Sword Emperor, Emperor Sword Sect Master looks to be polite to you. But I can tell that he harbored hatred in him,” Luo Xianzi said.

“Hehe, I took action to corner the entire Emperor Sword Sect and I even killed one of their Sir Gods. It’d be weird if Emperor Sword Sect Master didn’t hate me,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

Not only Luo Xianzi could tell, but Jian Wushuang also saw through him. He was so readable.

Plus, Jian Wushuang knew that Emperor Sword Sect Master was temporarily fearful of his power and he didn’t dare to display his hatred. Hence, his humble behavior. But in actual fact, he was dying to suck his blood dry and eat his flesh.

Besides, Jian Wushuang was sure that when the Master of Star Palace’s death was verified in no time, all forces and experts would launch an attack on Lineage of Star with all sorts of reasons. Emperor Sword Sect would definitely hit them when they were down.

That was a definite.

However, even though Jian Wushuang knew that for sure, he couldn’t just destroy Emperor Sword Sect.

“Emperor Sword Sect, in Eternal Chaotic World, their foundation and power in Sanctuary Alliance are too solid. It’s okay if I just teach Emperor Sword Sect Master a lesson casually. Sanctuary Alliance wouldn’t care. But if I were to destroy Emperor Sword Sect directly just because Emperor Sword Sect Master made it difficult for me, it would instigate dissatisfaction in the higher-ups of Sanctuary Alliance. Plus, Emperor Sword Sect already lowered their heads before me,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

Lineage of Star was already at the heart of the struggle.

Among the higher-ups on Sanctuary Alliance, there were some who were hostile towards Lineage of Star, or even to him.

However, there were also some that anticipated and looking forward to him growing and becoming one of the major powers of Sanctuary Alliance. In other words, those who supported him.

Between the two, there should be restrictions to one another.

However, if Jian Wushuang were to destroy Emperor Sword Sect for trivial matters, although Sanctuary Alliance wouldn’t do anything to him, it was inevitable that those higher-ups who were originally on his side would become unhappy. That was not something Jian Wushuang wanted.

“In Sanctuary Alliance, all forces are complicated. Like the saying, pull one hair and the whole body is affected. To Lineage of Star now, the most important factor is the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance. The standing of the Great Emperors, he couldn’t let their standpoints waver. At least, not until after the danger period.”

“As for Emperor Sword Sect, humph, they are just clowns. Even if I don’t destroy them now, when the war explodes, I will destroy them if they dare to join the war.”

Jian Wushuang didn’t care much about Emperor Sword Sect.

In Eternal Chaotic World, among the major forces who intend to fight Lineage of Star, there were many that were stronger than Emperor Sword Sect. Even if there was really a war, forces like Emperor Sword Sect weren’t too many if there was one extra, weren’t too few if there was one less. It didn’t matter.

“Sword Emperor, as you know clearly, I shall not comment further. Goodbye,” Luo Xianzi said and then turned to leave. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Jian Wushuang watched as Luo Xianzi leave. Then, he waved and an ancient silver spaceship appeared in the void before him.

Jian Wushuang entered the cabin and it started traveling at a terrifyingly fast speed to Lineage of Star.

With the speed of the silver spaceship, he would arrive in Lineage of Star in no time.

However, the silver spaceship only traveled for half a day before it ran into mishap.

In the vast dark void, the ancient spaceship was traveling at a fast speed. However, just as the silver spaceship flew past a piece of void, the surroundings suddenly filled with blurry fog and as the spaceship continued to plunge forward, the grey fog grew thicker.

Jian Wushuang in the cabin instantly notice the changes in the void outside the spaceship. His eyes dilated in shock.

“It seems that my journey back won’t be smooth sailing.”
