Chapter 1071: The Battle Formation of Ancient Gods

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Interesting.”

Jian Nantian studied the Formation laid out before him, his eyes glimmering intently.

Gazing coldly at Jian Nantian from within the Formation, the Celestial Master Ku Xin said, “You have underestimated us of the Ancient Monster Clan, Jian Nantian. Long have our clan endured the turmoils and strifes of the Samsara Continent. Our might is unfathomable by the likes of you!”

“This invincible Protective Array will never be broken without the help of several Celestial Masters of the Exceptional Realm!”

“Did you not say that you are going to trample past our defenses and step triumphantly upon the peaks of the Heaven-ceasing Mountain? It seems that you could hardly even make it past the gates of the Ancient Monster Clan!”

The Celestial Master Ku Xin taunted proudly with brimming conceit.

The warriors of his kin who were just beside him looked as proud and arrogant as he was.

The Protective Array was one of the heirlooms of the Ancient Monster Clan since the yesteryears. Celestial Masters, be they common ones or those who were already of the Exception Realm, could never hope to be able to break the Formation on their own. With the utmost confidence in their Formation, they were assured that Jian Nantian and Jian Wushuang would be thwarted here.

“The Formation is powerful indeed.”

Jiannan Tian admitted truthfully, his chin nodding faintly as he began to smile. “Still, do you honestly believe that the Formation alone would be able to hinder me?”

As he spoke, Jian Nantian waved his hand and conjured a magical token.

“That’s…”

Everyone’s gaze instantly transfixed upon the token he held.

Everyone nearby could clearly feel the terrible power radiating from the magical token.

“Long ago, the Samsara Master took me in as his disciple. He had then presented this to me as a safeguard against perils!”

“Much I have endured through the years of my adventures here, most, if not all of them were so perilous that I could have long lost my life. Yet I have intentionally resisted from using this token. Long have I knew that I will surely encounter a conundrum like this..”

Despite speaking slowly, the echoes of Jian Nantian’s voice slowly resonating into the air.

“It may be true that the Ancient Monster Clan’s Protective Array can only be broken by the combined might of several Celestial Masters of the Exceptional Realm. But this magical token contains the strength of my Teacher’s might. The powers of my Teacher will test the sturdiness of your Formation!”

With that, Jian Nantian immediately crushed the token in his hand.

The terrible power contained within the token burst forth immediately like a surging flood.

The power, wellfar beyond the levels of Celestial Master, has reached levels where not could imagine.

Jian Nantian immediately harnessed the powers that pour forth, conjuring a gigantic silhouette in the shape of a massive quarterstaff; so huge that it might even destroy all heaven and earth. Without any warning, the mammoth silhouette fell mercilessly upon the Formation!

Watching as the silhouette of the colossal quarterstaff crashing over them, the Celestial Master Ku Xin and his warriors could only brace themselves for the worst, their breaths held absent-mindedly as fear and panic gripped them.

“Such are the powers of a single stroke by the Samsara Temple Master!”

Gasps of shock grew across the throng of warriors that lingered around in the air.

The Samsara Temple Master, a legendary entity of esteemed divinity and absolute strength, whose powers were undoubtedly beyond the leagues of Celestial Masters. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The power from a stroke from him, even if it is a careless stroke, would most unquestionably outvie even the unified might of several Celestial Masters of the Exceptional Realm.

Then again, would the universally-feared Protective Array of the Ancient Monster Clan be so easily defeated by a single stroke of the Samsara Temple Master?

Most certainly, yes.

The gigantic silhouette of the jet-black quarterstaff smashed forcefully into the diaphanous ambient gleaming over the Formation, the power of its stroke immediately bursting forth with unnerving intensity.

When struck by Jian Nantian with his sword earlier, the Formation had merely shuddered with tremors rippling from the point of his sword’s impact. Yet now, smote with such fury, the Formation trembled so strongly that it began to give way. Cracking noises could be heard from within as if something was breaking and snapping apart. With an astonishing speed, the Formation began to crumble.

The Formation was broken!

The Protective Array of the Ancient Monster Clan broke asunder before the callous stroke of the Samsara Temple Master!

The Formation collapsed, revealing the horde of the Ancient Monster Clan that cowered within, now completelyexposed before Jian Nantian and Jian Wushuang.

The Celestial Master Ku Xin and the warriors of the Ancient Monster Clan all wore a dejected expression for the failure.

Never did they expect that Jian Nantian would possess such means of undoing them.

It washardly unexpected that theFormation could not withstand the stroke of the Samsara Temple Master.

“Hmph! So you were able to break the Formation of our Clan?”

A cold voice rose into the air. It was the Celestial Master Ku Xin who had spoken. Rage was burning in his eyes like a huge bonfire.

“Never will we cower from a fight with or without the Formation!”

“The Ancient Monster Clan teems with warriors and swordsmen of power and strength. You have only the strength of you both. Why should we be afraid of you!”

“Ancient God Guardians, answer my call!”

The roar of the Celestial Master Ku Xin rumbled loudly with anger..

Nine figures leaped from the midst of the horde of warriors of the Ancient Monster Clan and stood before her.

The nine persons were all Dao Masters, the aura emanating from them showed that each of them wielded varying levels of strength between them. The most powerful of them were Dao Masters at the peak of Rank Three, while the lesser ones among them were fresh Dao Masters.

Nevertheless, it was strange that all nine men bore the very same aura of their bloodline that one could have mistaken that they were one and the same person.

“The Battle Formation of Ancient Gods!” The Celestial Master Ku Xin snarled.

The nine Ancient God Guardians standing abreast send forth a burst of their Bloodline Power. The force gushed forcefully, with all the wrath the Guardians could muster and blended as one as the nine figures of the Ancient God Guardians began to change.

“What’s that?”

“A battle formation? Or is that a magical formation?”

“What a peculiar magical formation… One what functions using Bloodline Powers?”

Surprised gasps and cries arose from the midst of warriors who were witnessing the battle from the sky.

The nine Ancient God Guardians had together formed a powerful battle formation, channeling their powers and summoned into form the gargantuan figure of a behemoth; an Ancient God that towered at more than hundreds of feet before the nine.

The Ancient God’s complexion was chiefly of silver, with only a two-tenths of his appearance blushing in gold.

In addition, at the forehead of the Ancient God, between his eyebrows, were the symbols of four Quadrangular Star that were inverted.

A Four-star Ancient God!

It was a Four-star Ancient God whose strength rivaled that of a Celestial Master of the human race!

“Buzz!”

A huge and terrifying aura radiated from the monstrous figure of the Four-star Ancient God, filling the entire space between heaven and earth immediately that many of the warriors present could not help feeling fearful at the sheer power it wield.

“What a strong and overwhelming aura!”

“The aura is of the levels of Celestial Master. In fact, the levels of one of the most powerful Celestial Masters.”

“So the nine Dao Masters form a battle formation and unify their powers to replicate the battle strength of a Celestial Master?”

“This is incredibly powerful… what is the name of this battle formation?”

Everyone was ridden with shock, amazement, and awe.

There was an enormous difference between the powers of a Dao Master and that of aCelestial Master.

The combined strength of nine Dao Masters, even if they were of the peak of Rank Three, could never be able to hope to match the battle strength of aCelestial Master.

But the nine Ancient God Guardians, despite their varying strength, were able to conjure the gigantic figure of an Ancient God whose powers were so great that it even the strength of a fresh Celestial Master paled in comparison.

What was this battle formation that wielded such power and prowess?
