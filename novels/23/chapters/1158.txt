Chapter 1159: Returning to Firmament Territory

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the dim palace, Golden Axe Holy Master stood there, looking deadly pale and trembling violently.

“It’s impossible. It can’t be!

“How did they discover my real identity? Why did they set me up?”

Golden Axe Holy Master thought and then shook his head, finding it very hard to accept the truth.

He could not figure out why the Green Fire Palace suspected him. Upon Jian Wushuang’s death, no one was supposed to know that Jian Wushuang had told him his location.

“Golden Axe!”

With an indifferent voice sounding, Sunrise Sword Emperor appeared in front of Golden Axe Holy Master.

“Aren’t you confused, shocked now?” Sunrise Sword Emperor asked, giving Golden Axe Holy Master a cold glance. He continued in a deep voice, “To be honest, you’ve remained so well hidden in the Green Fire Palace that even our late Palace Masters never doubted you. But this time, you can not deny your real identity anymore.

“Someone wanted to meet you. When you see him, your doubts will be dispersed.”

As soon as Sunrise Sword Emperor finished his words, a figure arrived suddenly and showed up in front of Golden Axe Holy Master.

“Golden Axe Holy Master, long time no see!” Jian Wushuang said with a sly smile on his face.

“You! It’s you!” Golden Axe Holy Master yelled with his eyes widely open, as if he had seen a ghost.

“It’s not real!

“You died, didn’t you?

“Red Snow King and the other kings watched you die. The news about your death has been spread in the Green Fire Palace,” Golden Axe Holy Master howled.

His howls reverberated throughout the whole palace.

The palace itself was a treasure. Golden Axe Holy Master’s voice could not be heard outside the palace. In the meantime, he could not pass messages to others.

“Of course you wanted me dead, so did the Jin Kingdom you serve. Unfortunately, I let you down,” Jian Wushuang said with a sniff. “As for the news of my death, the five Palace Masters had disseminated it on purpose to fool you and the Jin Kingdom.”

“Did Green Fire Palace use you as a bait?” Golden Axe Holy Master asked, staring at Jian Wushuang.

“Clever.” Jian Wushuang grinned.

“No, no!” Golden Axe Holy Master roared hysterically, shaking his head madly.

.

At this moment, he was desperately eager to inform the Jin Kingdom and its experts that Jian Wushuang was still alive.

That monster did not die.

In his eyes, Jian Wushuang would be the leader of Green Fire Palace in the near future, which would be the Jin Kingdom’s nightmare.

Golden Axe Holy Master longed to fill the Jin Kingdom in so that they could think of some plan to kill Jian Wushuang, even at all costs.

However, he had no means to tell them.

The Jin Kingdom was doomed to be kept in the dark.

Golden Axe Holy Master seemed to have foreseen the scene: Jian Wushuang was qualified to be the leader of Green Fire Palace years later; he joined the final battle between the Jin Kingdom and the Green Fire Palace and caused massive casualties to the Jin Kingdom.

That was a catastrophe for the Jin Kingdom.

“Jian Wushuang, what do you want me to do with Golden Axe Holy Master?” Sunrise Sword Emperor asked.

“Of course execute him directly,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“I see.” Sunrise Sword Emperor nodded and then swished his hand to summon a flash of Sword Essence which directly attacked the center of Golden Axe Holy Master’s forehead.

Golden Axe Holy Master had been limited by a Restriction, so he had no strength to defend himself. Soon he closed his eyes, and his breath vanished.

After Golden Axe Holy Master had died, Jian Wushuang had nothing to do in the Green Fire Palace. Escorted by Void Temple Master, he left Green Fire Palace privately and returned to Green Fire World.

Green Fire World was divided into two continents, and Void Continent was on top.

“Jian Wushuang, take care of yourself. You can deal with your personal matters. Keep a low profile and do not expose your identity easily. If you meet any trouble that you’re not convenient to solve in person, let me know directly,” Void Temple Master said to him.

“I will,” Jian Wushuang responded with a smile.

Void Temple Master took leave.

Jian Wushuang came to a small hall of Void Temple.

“Open the wormhole. I’m heading for Firmament Territory,” Jian Wushuang said in a grave voice.

Having observed Jian Wushuang for a while, a purple-robed servant in the palace responded, “Sir, it’s quite a long travel to Firmament Territory. Therefore, you need to pay a great number of Divine Gems.”

“How many?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“A billion,” the purple-robed servant replied.

“Using a wormhole costs a billion Divine Gems, which is equal to all the property of a common Dao Mater. Void Palace Master is a good businessman,”?Jian Wushuang thought with a smile. The next moment, he took out a token.

“Open it now,” Jian Wushuang continued.

“Yes, my lord!” The purple-robed servant nodded with respect and left to open the wormhole.

Jian Wushuang had gotten this token from Void Temple Master. In the whole Void Temple, only a few people possessed such tokens.

With this token, Jian Wushuang could take wormhole without charge.

Within a few seconds, the wormhole had gotten ready.

“My lord, this way please,” The purple-robed servant said and stood respectfully beside Jian Wushuang.

“Got it.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

He looked at the wormhole ahead of him, his eyes full of excitement and expectation.

“I’ve left Firmament Territory for long. It’s time to go back.”

Jian Wushuang stepped into the wormhole. With a flash of light, he disappeared.

The next moment, he arrived at Firmament Territory.

Although it was just a common realm in the Green Fire World, it boasted an enormous number of Warriors.

Jian Wushuang had left Firmament Territory alone about 2,000 years ago and now he finally returned to this territory.

During those 2,000 years, there was no great change in the structure of the Firmament Territory.

Among all the sects and powers in Firmament Territory, the three magnates still took the lead.

Nine top sects including Ancient Sect served the three magnates.

After Jian Wushuang came back to Firmament Territory, he visited the Ancient Sect first.

After all, he had been a disciple of the Ancient Sect.

As soon as he appeared in the Void above the Ancient Sect, he spread his Strength of Soul and saw everything within the sect clearly.

Jian Wushuang noticed a white-robed man who was standing on the top of a mountain with his hands behind him. The man had a kind, gentle air and he was looking up at the Void above with a smile. His gaze landed on the direction where Jian Wushuang stood.

Jian Wushuang took a leap and entered the world below.
