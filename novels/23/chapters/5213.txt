Chapter 5216: Unlucky Wu Zuo

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the depths of the Original Universe, True Spirit observed, a smirk tugging at the corners of his mouth and narrow eyes squinting in delight.

Ever since gaining independent will, it had developed a rather bad habit:

hoarding wealth!

Within the Qishen Temple, there were numerous fixed treasures, like the peculiar territory known as Demon Mountain. In the past, Demon Mountain held scattered treasures, not just suppressing a trace of the origin source but also numerous treasures above. All those treasures had been claimed by True Spirit and stored in his personal vault.

Inside the Qishen Temple, worlds upon worlds existed, and treasures beyond count. Although most were fixed, there were still quite a few scattered supreme treasures and legacies, all of which True Spirit had secreted away in its vault.

There were countless worlds and treasure vaults within the temple. Although most of them were fixed, there were still many precious treasures and legacies that the true spirit had hidden away.

Rubbing its beard, True Spirit’s eyes lit up, and a token appeared in its hand.

“How many Grand Yan Immortals did we startle this time?” True Spirit’s gaze never left the celestial canopy as it casually inquired.

A holographic image manifested on the token, depicting one of the temple guardians.

“My lord, nearly 1,000 Grand Yan Immortals from 16 nearby universes have been startled, just enough to meet the quota,” the guardian replied, bowing respectfully.

“Hmm, not bad,” True Spirit said nonchalantly. However, a thought crossed his mind, and he asked further, “Oh, by the way, where is that thing? Why haven’t I seen him?” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

This statement left the guardian bewildered. They couldn’t fathom what True Spirit was talking about, but it wouldn’t be appropriate to ask. So, they could only stare blankly.

“You know, that little creature that managed to survive by sheer luck. What was his name again? He was expelled not long ago. I almost forgot about him,” True Spirit rubbed his temples, feeling suddenly weary.

“Is it Lord Wu zuo?” the guardian spirit asked with some uncertainty.

“Yes, yes, that little thing. Didn’t I say it before? Let him enter the Qishen

Temple with those Emperors and get some benefits. Can’t have rumors

spreading that I’ve forgotten our roots, can we? The Old Master’s bones aren’t even cold yet, and I’m already expelling his only surviving disciple,” True Spirit said, his words dismissive. He didn’t really regard the other party as a person, referring to him as a little thing and a trivial matter.

The guardian seemed to understand his meaning and hurriedly said, “Lord True Spirit, I find Wu Zuo extremely disrespectful to you, my lord. It would be giving face to our Old Master if we were to slay him outright. How can we let such a petty person enter the Qishen Temple again?”

True Spirit’s face changed slightly as the guardian spoke vehemently. He said, slightly annoyed, “No, no matter what, he was Master’s disciple. Even if he’s been expelled, we cannot treat him differently. Let him in quickly!’

“I’ve noticed that the recent exploration of the Four Great Secret Realms hasn’t been going smoothly! These ancient species dare to rebel. It’s a good opportunity for Wu Zuo to go and explore there. The trial in the Original Universe won’t last much longer. The Four Great Secret Realms must be established before the trial in the Original Universe ends. At least the cultivation area for Grand Yan Immortals should be developed.”

True Spirit glanced down at the Sea of Origin Source below, which was the interior of the Qishen Temple and the largest world outside the Sea of Origin Source.

That was the Qishen World personally constructed by Qishen himself all those ages ago.

After so many cycles of cosmic eras, many native powerhouses had appeared in the Four Great Secrets Realms. The White Tiger Temple was already finding it hard to hold its ground, and even exploration had become incredibly difficult.

“But, Lord Wu Zuo’s strength…”

Before the guardian could finish his sentence, True Spirit interrupted, “Old Three, you must remember, even though Wuzuo has been expelled, he was once the renowned disciple of the great Qishen. He can’t be underestimated. Let him explore the Four Great Secret Realms. Go now; this is an order. Do you understand?”

“Yes!” The guardian dared not speak further and nodded hurriedly.

He had figured it out. True Spirit was determined to kill Wu Zuo. Back then, Wu Zuo had merely teased this old man’s beard a bit. Now that he had awakened and held absolute power, not only was Wu Zuo’s name expunged, but he also intended to bring him to his death!

What kind of place were the Four Great Secret Realms? It was the core of the Qishen Temple.

Although the Qishen Temple had been operating internally from ancient times until now, the puppets of the Four Great Temples suppressed various realms. The Vermillion Bird Temple presided over the Original Universe. The Original

Planets where Grand Yan Immortals were being tested were just a small part of it. The real Original Universe was vast, much larger than the Bloodthirst Continent, specially used to suppress some ancient remnants of innate gods and demons and some evil consciousness forms that had taken the shape of Great Daos.

The Black Tortoise Temple had the most puppets, and it could independently develop puppet techniques. It controlled 108 peripheral worlds, all of which were under the management of the Black Tortoise Temple.

In the past, the Qishen Temple that entered the domain of the Great Si Region was a relic left by the Black Tortoise Temple, and those who entered were all permitted by the Black Tortoise Temple.

Even the opening of the Qishen Temple this time had a significant connection with the Black Tortoise Temple. The awakening power of the revived the sleeping Tru Spirit.

The entire Qishen Temple, like True Spirit himself, was awakened from ancient times and directly opened the highest trial.

Unfortunately, too many years had passed, and the control of the four great palaces had been greatly weakened.

Only the Black Tortoise Temple could regenerate and control several great worlds.

The Azure Dragon Temple could only hide in the Bloodthirst Continent. They had too few top-notch combatants. They could control many Great Worlds, but those worlds would produce experts. Among the puppets of the four temples, only the Temple Master was at tier 6, while the other six were at the tier 5. With just a few people, they could not control too many worlds.

The Black Turtle Temple was different from the White Tiger Temple. The former created a large number of golems to manage their Great Worlds. Those golems were extremely powerful, and they could even create golems with the combat power of a tier 4 Emperor.

With these puppets suppressing one large world after another, the Black Tortoise Temple’s development was very robust, several times stronger than the Azure Dragon and Vermilion Bird Temples.

But the Vermilion Bird Temple had always guarded the Original Realm and had never gone out. If it weren’t for this highest trial, they had enough manpower.

The Azure Dragon Temple was the most unfortunate. They had always advocated integrating all the worlds within the Qishen Temple but ended up being driven to hide in the Bloodthirst Continent, not daring to come out.

If it weren’t for the native Emperors of other large worlds being unable to traverse the chaotic flows between worlds, the entire Qishen Temple would have been in chaos long ago.

As for the White Tiger Temple, although their strength was very formidable and they had recruited many local powerhouses, they guarded the Four Great Secret Realms, the core four worlds of the Qishen Temple.

Heaven, Earth, Man, and God.

These four secret realms were the main areas covered by the Qishen’s primary origin source. Each realm was very vast, although not as large as the Bloodthirst Continent, but many strong individuals were born there.

Especially the Heaven’s Muddle Secret Realm, where many tier 6 Emperors were born. Fortunately, the Master of the White Tiger Temple was ruthless enough; they subdued strong individuals for their use and directly suppressed the weak.

This was how they stabilized the situation.

However, even so, the four secret realms frequently experienced unrest.

The God’s Tomb Secret Realm was the world where the Qishen perished. There were 13 soul guardians there, guarding the God’s Tomb, and no one dared to trespass. Moreover, the beings born in the God’s Tomb Secret Realm were Special Life Forms, and they were very rare in number..
