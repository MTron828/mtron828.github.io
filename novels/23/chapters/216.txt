Chapter 217: Things Have Come to A Close

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Eldest Brother, let’s go.” Jian Wushuang said.

“OK.” Wang Yuan nodded. “Let’s take Second Brother and Fourth Sister first.”

After he spoke, Wang Yuan patted his Purple Cloud Condor and went to the Sky Valley.

Upon taking them along, they all left Sky Valley.

Above the Void, experts from the 12 dynasties and the old sects were gloatingly looking at Mo Lingtian.

Mo Lingtian’s face had turned pale.

“Alchemy School...” Mo Lingtian murmured as if in a trancelike state.

“By the way, the Grab Battle, what should we do?” a monarch suddenly asked.

“What else can we do?”

“This can’t go on any longer, it needs to be stopped.”

The other monarchs agreed.

“Let’s end it,” the monarch of the Cosmos Empire said, “this year’s Easternmost Hunting is ended and the standings will be ranked according to their current points.”

“Alright.”

“I agree!”

“Let’s run with that.”

Supported by most of the monarchs, the Easternmost Hunting was stopped at once. Those geniuses who were still in Sky Valley were called back and a new list was made according to their current points.

The rankings were as follows:

“In first place, Tianzong Dynasty, Jian Wushuang!”

“In second place, Tianzong Dynasty, Yang Zaixuan!”

“In third place, Tianzong Dynasty, Su Rou!”

“Coming in fourth, Tianzong Dynasty, Baili Chen!”

“Coming in fifth, Tianzong Dynasty, Feng Yutian!”

“Coming in sixth, Tianzong Dynasty, Mu Yingying!”

“In seventh, Ziyi Dynasty...”

Amongst the standings, the top six were all from the Tianzong Dynasty.

This was of no doubt.

The following positions were filled by the Ziyi Dynasty and the East Hill Empire.

The Cosmos Empire and The Immortals-killing Empire, the two largest empires in the 12 dynasties, had no one who ranked in the top 15.

This was because the geniuses from the Cosmos Empire were all killed by Jian Wushuang and the points of the geniuses from the Immortals-killing Empire were all grabbed by him.

It could be said that both largest empires were defeated by Jian Wushuang in the Easternmost Hunting.

With the new standings were published, this year’s Easternmost Hunting came to the close.

Near a lake in the vast Easternmost Plain, Jian Wushuang and the others stopped.

“Eldest Brother, the elixir you gave me was quite effective.” Jian Wushuang smiled, feeling that the pain in his body had been eased significantly.

The elixir which Wang Yuan gave him on the way was really effective.

“Of course, don’t you know who I am? How could the elixir I offer just be ordinary?” Wang Yuan smiled, patting his chest.

“It’s a pity that both you and Fourth Sister were severely injured, otherwise you might have been back in shape within a half day after taking them. But now, you should be fully recovered in two or three days.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Jian Wushuang looked at Su Rou who was beside him, beaming.

Su Rou’s face turned ruddy and restored some breath. Though she was still weak, she was much better than before.

This was owed to the elixir that Wang Yuan had given her.

“As for Second Brother, you...” Wang Yuan looked at Yang Zaixuan.

Though he was not so badly injured, his left arm was cut off, which was much worse than Jian Wushuang and Su Rou!

“It’s a pity I couldn’t refine the Purple Fire Body Shaping Elixir to help grow back limbs, otherwise I would have given you one,” Wang Yuan said with a faint smile, “but you can be rest assured that though I can’t give you one now, I will try to ask my father for one after I go back to Elixir School.”

Yang Zaixuan’s expression changed a little after hearing that.

The Purple Fire Body Shaping Elixir was a high-level elixir. Few alchemists in the Nanyang Continent could refine it. But it seemed that it may not be so hard to get one according to what Wang Yuan said.

“Right, Second Brother. Between you and the Cosmos Empire, what’s going on? Why did those from the Cosmos Empire crazily try and kill you?” Jian Wushuang asked.

He had wanted to ask him when they were in Sky Valley. But since they were in battle, he had no chance to ask.

“It...” Yang Zaixuan’s face fell slightly.

“Second Brother, if you are not willing to say, I will explain for you. I know it,” Wang Yuan said.

Yang Zaixuan nodded gently, and Wang Yuan continued.

“Second Brother comes from the Cosmos Empire and his identity is special!

“He is the son of King Yang, the younger brother of the Cosmos Empire’s current monarch. Years ago, King Yang and the monarch of Cosmos Empire fought for the succession to the throne. Finally, King Yang was defeated and killed by the monarch. Since then, Second Brother is a wanted man, No. 1 on the wanted list.

“This time, those geniuses from the Cosmos Empire came to him in the Easternmost Hunting because they wanted a handsome reward.”

After speaking, Wang Yuan fell silent.

“Get it.” Jian Wushuang’s face changed slightly and he looked over at Yang Zaixuan.

Yang Zaixuan frowned but did not say a word.

“Being born into a royal family, it’s hard to get away from things like this. To be wanted is something he cannot control. The monarch of the Cosmos Empire is pretty kind to have made Second Brother a wanted man only in the Cosmos Empire rather than in all the 12 dynasties,” Wang Yuan said.

Jian Wushuang let out a heavy sigh and shook his head slightly.

He did not understand it for he was not born in a royal family.

“What Second Brother faced was not so troublesome. The one who got into real trouble was you, Third Brother.” Wang Yuan suddenly turned to him. “You are in great danger now for you are targeted by that place.”

“What place?” Jian Wushuang was stunned. Then he turned over his hand and took out a light golden token, with the word “Holy” carved on it.

He received a token from Grayrobe’s Interspatial Ring after killing him.

“Eldest Brother, the place you referred to is the owner of the token, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Right.” Wang Yuan nodded. “It is one of the overlords in the Nanyang Continent, Holy Emperor Palace!”

“The Holy Emperor Palace?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and kept it in his deep heart.

“Third Brother, you were born in a small empire and I’m afraid that you have never left it. You know little about the Nanyang Continent. I will tell you more in detail,” Wang Yuan said.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly, and listened carefully.
