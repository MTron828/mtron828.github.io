Chapter 2949: Secret Domain

——

Seeing Jian Wushuang completely disappear from their sight, Long Yun and Xue Yu both looked a bit unsightly.

“He refused? How could Heavenly Sword Marquis refuse to enter the Primitive Palace?” Xue Yu frowned and seemed to be in disbelief.

“Perhaps what we said was not comprehensive enough to truly move him. We had no choice but to report this matter to the higher-ups of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and have them personally invite people to talk to him,” Long Yun said.

“Is it useful for the higher-ups to look for him?” Xue Yu was puzzled.

“I don’t know, but it has nothing to do with us. As long as we report the news of the discovery of this peerless genius, we will be able to receive a big reward,” Long Yun said.

“That’s true.” Xue Yu nodded slightly.

“The Primitive Palace, or even the Primal Chaos Palace, is like a pie falling from the sky to us, but Heavenly Sword Marquis doesn’t care at all. It’s really…”

Long Yun and Xue Yu were secretly amazed.

The 385th nest of the Heaven-slaying Alliance was also the nest Jian Wushuang had been in before.

Jian Wushuang returned to the nest after completing the assessment. In the hall, Xue Dong King was still waiting.

When he saw Jian Wushuang walk out of the inner hall, Xue Dong King immediately went up to him.

“Haha, Brother Tianhou, you came out so quickly?” Xue Dong King smiled and asked, “How about the assessment?”

“What do you think?” Jian Wushuang gently waved a token in his hand.

This token was his identity token.

“Haha, I Knew It would be a piece of cake for you to pass the assessment with your strength.” Xue Dong King laughed and was not surprised at all. “Come on, tell me, what did you encounter in this assessment?”

Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King sat down at the table next to them, and then Jian Wushuang also briefly explained the contents of the test.

“Tsk, tsk, there are actually 11 Immortal Saints alive in Black Dragon Mountain. Under such circumstances, it’s really difficult for you to think of a way to kill those Immortal Saints in Black Dragon Mountain.” Xue Dong King pursed his lips and said.

“It can’t be helped. This is the test of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Although this task is difficult, many people have passed it.” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“By the way, Brother Heavenly Marquis, since you have passed this test and you have officially become an ordinary member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, then the three-star task we talked about before…” Xue Dong King looked at Jian Wushuang with eager eyes.

“No problem. When will you set off?” Jian Wushuang asked with a smile.

He had promised Xue Dong King that he would go on an ordinary three-star mission with him.

Although it was only an ordinary mission, it was not too difficult since it had reached the three-star level.

“Haha, there’s no rush. Let’s have a drink first. In addition, I’ll tell you the details of this mission before we set off,” Xue Dong King said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang nodded and then listened to Xue Dong King’s explanation.

An hour later, Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King both accepted the mission and set off together.

The Dark Shout Realm was a medium-sized realm.

This was the location of Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King’s mission, which was also the lair of the three Saints of Shadow.

At the edge of the Dark Shout Realm, there was a huge restriction that completely sealed the entire realm.

Although the area covered by the restriction was huge, it was not very powerful. It could block ordinary Divine Masters, but to the Immortal Saint, it was just a decoration.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King had already arrived at the periphery of the restriction.

“Shadow Three Saints have already turned the Dark Shout Realm into their own paradise. Not only have they completely closed the spatial passage of this realm, but they have also used a restriction to cover the entire Dark Shout Realm. If we want to enter the Dark Shout Realm, we have to forcibly break through this restriction. Although it’s not difficult to break through this restriction, once we do, three Shadow Saints will definitely notice and know of our arrival,” Xue Dong King said.

Next to him stood a figure wearing a gray robe and a gray mask. His aura was extremely cold and evil.

This figure was Jian Wushuang.

He had changed into the unique attire of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and used the gray mask to turn himself into such a cold and evil figure.

“If you know, then you know. The three Shadow Saints are not weak. Even if they know that we are coming, they probably won’t be too afraid. After all, in their eyes, I’m just a Divine Master and won’t be a threat to them. As for you, Xue Dong King, although you’re very strong, the three of them can fight together. They won’t be so scared that they will hide or run away,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Well, in that case, let’s force our way in.” Xue Dong King nodded.

Immediately, Xue Dong King waved his hand, and the terrifying divine power immediately tore a big hole in the restriction in front of them. Then, Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King directly entered the Dark Shout Realm.

In the center of the Dark Shout Realm, there was a huge swamp.

The swamp was filled with a faint earthen yellow air current. In the deepest part of the swamp, there was a towering but huge temple.

This divine hall was the Shadow Hall where the three Shadows Saints lived.

At this moment, in the depths of the Shadow Hall, three human figures were gathered together. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Haha, one month. Just one more month and the Earth God fruit will ripen!”

“It’s been too long. Since the three of us discovered the Earth God Fruit, it’s been more than 100,000 years. During these 100,000 years, the three of us have been guarding here and haven’t left for even a moment. In order to cover up the news of this Earth God Fruit, we had to use all kinds of methods to completely seal this dark domain. We were afraid that other experts would come and discover the existence of this Earth God Fruit.”

“And now, our boring waiting days are coming to an end!”

“One month, just one more month.”

The three shadows, the three shadows, were obviously very excited.

In the outside world, it was said that the three shadows had sealed the Dark Shout Realm because of their evil natures. They wanted to turn the Dark Shout Realm into their paradise and enslave all the cultivators in this realm.

However, that was not the case.

They only had one true goal, and that was the Earth God Fruit that was about to mature in the Dark Shout Realm.

“The Earth God Fruit is an excellent treasure that cultivates the laws of the earth. Its value is shocking, and it’s enough to make many True Saints fight for it, especially those who comprehend the laws of the Earth!”

Among the three Shadow Saint, a cold old man in a gray robe was smiling sinisterly.
