Chapter 1503: Fight!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Do you still have something for me?” Jian Wushuang looked at the ugly-looking man.

“Jian Wushuang,” the ugly-looking man spoke, “I am Jiu Chou of the Purple Feather Palace!”

“Purple Feather Palace?”

Jian Wushuang shook his head slightly. There were countless sects in the ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. However, Jian Wushuang had never heard of the Purple Feather Palace. Hence, it was obvious that the Purple Feather Palace was not considered a very powerful sect.

“You might not have heard of me before. However, from today onward, you will know me! This is because I will use you as a stepping stone and get into the top twenty of the Universe God ranking list!” the eyes of the ugly-looking man Jiu Chou were burning with excitement.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. He understood that Jiu Chou’s objective was not the White Blaze Fruit that he possessed. Instead, it was to fight him.

“Before meeting you, I defeated Shi Wang who was ranked fifty-eighth and Su Ang who was ranked thirty-first in the Universe God ranking list successively. Now, I only need to defeat you so that I can challenge the ten monsters who are in the top ten of the Universe God ranking list!” Jiu Chou’s loud voice reverberated across the area.

After hearing what was said, Jian Wushuang’s gaze turned serious and his expression also turned grave.

If Jiu Chou had no fighting achievements previously and had only wanted to challenge him, Jian Wushuang would not be too concerned.

However, at the moment, Jiu Chou had already defeated two experts in the Universe God ranking list consecutively. This included Su Ang who was ranked thirty-first on the Universe God ranking list as well. Hence, Jian Wushuang could no longer take him lightly.

“Jian Wushuang, show me your full strength and let me see how strong the top twenty of the Universe God ranking list is!”

With a shout, Jiu Chou, who stood in front of Jian Wushuang, made a move.

Whoosh!

The void in front of Jian Wushuang was torn open and Jiu Chou’s body appeared immediately. As soon as Jiu Chou appeared, a shrill crimson saber light struck.

Fast. It was so fast that it was unbelievable.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes shrank. During his course of training, he had met quite a number of experts. In particular, in the Sky Sword Prison, he had fought with many experts, which included a few Real Gods, and some of them wielded a saber. However, among those experts, not many of them could use a saber with speed like Jiu Chou. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Hmph!”

Jian Wushuang gave a cold “hmph” and the Blood Mountain Sword in his hands changed into electricity and clashed with the crimson saber light with lightning speed.

During the clash, two Divine Power collided with one another. Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword and Jiu Chou’s crimson saber were pushed back to the point that they retreated slightly.

“Ten Thousand Shadows!”

Jian Wushuang gave a loud cry. Rustle! Rustle! Rustle! Rustle!

Countless sword lights burst forth and every one of them was terrifically fast. In addition, its power was frightening.

“Haha, take this.”

Jiu Chou laughed loudly. A great amount of horrifying saber essence, which could tear apart everything, rose and Jiu Chou’s body changed into a sharp saber. The saber light was like ink and it attacked instantly. The saber light which could cover the universe, was like a crimson saber river and it headed for Jian Wushuang.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

Countless sounds of weapons clashing with one another could be heard. At that instant, in less than a breath’s time, both of them had already clashed with one another hundreds of times. In such an intense battle, the crimson saber river, which was originally very dense, became even more dazzling.

“The speed of his saber skills is actually faster than mine?”

Jian Wushuang was shocked and his body moved.

Swoosh! Nine shadows appeared at the same time and Jian Wushuang’s body had already appeared magically behind Jiu Chou’s back. His shrill sword was like a crimson, glittering light which plunged across the void and headed straight for Jiu Chou’s neck.

“Piss off!”

Jiu Chou turned his hand over and struck furiously. This stroke was strong. When it clashed with Jian Wushuang’s Sword Principles, it actually forced Jian Wushuang to retreat three steps continuously.

“Jian Wushuang, as someone who is ranked twentieth in the Universe God ranking list, your abilities are only as such?” Jiu Chou’s body was filled with murderous aura and an enormous amount of saber essence was locked on to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes glowed with a fierce light. By activating his Divine Power crazily, his Reincarnation Power also activated the secret skill of the Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor.

“Ninth Heaven Stroke!”

A supreme sword essence burst forth in a great amount and shot up to the highest heavens.

At that void, the Nemesis Sword, a towering sword shadow which could destroy the world, descended.

A fearsome power was putting pressure on the void.

“Haha, good going.”

Jiu Chou’s face was filled with excitement. After laughing, the crimson saber on his hands became even redder.

A tremendous amount of crimson mist was released and the whole sky was dyed a scarlet color.

Within the center of the crimson universe, Jiu Chou looked as if he had become the emperor of the universe.

“Crimson Saber!”

Rustle!

A captivating, brilliant saber light appeared out of thin air.

The saber light was so unusually bewitching that it caused people to be charmed.

When it was launched, it was as if everything in the universe had lost its color.

In no time, the unusually bewitching saber light collided head on with the towering sword shadow that Jian Wushuang had unleashed.

Bam!

A loud sound which shook the universe could be heard. At that moment when the sound was heard, a vast amount of Divine Power had already become frightening shockwaves which swept past all areas.

Within the enormous Divine Power storm, a glittering light appeared.

Thud!

The glittering light landed on the ground directly without any hindrance and it created a big hole instantly. It was as if the land had completely subsided.

However, with a release of powerful Divine Power from the bottom of the hole, a huge amount of crushed stone was smashed into pieces. A figure then stood up again. It was Jiu Chou.

Jiu Chou had an extremely red face and his eyes were filled with dissatisfaction. As he stood on the ground, he looked at the void above. At the top, Jian Wushuang had a cold expression and he was putting his Blood Mountain Sword into its sheath slowly.

“You are indeed strong and you will not have any problems getting into the top thirty of the Universe God ranking list. However, you are still a bit lacking if you wish to get into the top twenty.”

After finishing talking, Jian Wushuang did not care about Jiu Chou’s reaction. He turned his body straight away and left.

Jiu Chou stood at his position. His body was shaking a little and he did not refute Jian Wushuang’s words.

He was very clear that the clash moments ago had decided the outcome of the match between him and Jian Wushuang.

He had lost.

“His Sword Principles were definitely not too strong. Compared to my saber skills, his Sword Principles are slightly more inferior. However, his Divine Power is unusually powerful and it is one grade stronger than mine. His comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way also seems to be stronger than mine!”

“Powerful Divine Power combined with the Power of Heaven Way. Even though his Unique Skills are slightly inferior to mine, he still managed to push me back. I am not satisfied with this loss!” Jiu Chou muttered.

However, he didn’t know that Jian Wushuang’s Divine Power was not stronger than his by much. It was because of the secret skill of the Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor that allowed Jian Wushuang’s Divine Power to rise to the next level.

As for the comprehension of the Power of Heaven Way, Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of the Reincarnation Doctrine could already allow him to clear the first level of the Doctrine Palace. As for Jiu Chou’s comprehension of the Heaven Way, he was still lacking slightly.

With the combination of these two factors, Jian Wushuang would definitely be stronger if the two of them fought one another.

“As expected. The experts in the top twenty of the Universe God ranking list would not go down so easily. Moreover, although Jian Wushuang has only just achieved the twentieth position, he is this strong. Hence, those people, whose rankings are higher than his, are definitely stronger. With that, the distance between me and them is definitely still very big.”

Jiu Chou shook his head and left soon after.
