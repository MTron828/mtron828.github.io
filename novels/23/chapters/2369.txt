Chapter 2370: Pointers (1)

Jian Wushuang knew how much the Selection meant to Yin Long. With his abilities, he really could defeat the entire Outer Court. However, out of the blue, there was someone among them who had reached the Peak Stage Chaotic Realm!

The Peak Stage Chaotic Realm was equivalent to the Great Emperor level in the Eternal Chaotic World during the previous Era.

While Yin Long was only at the Middle Stage Chaotic Realm, it was still a huge difference from the level of the God Emperor.

“As a matter of fact, Yin Long is a tragic character,” said Elder Yu Yang suddenly.

“Tragic character? How so?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“My little friend, you just arrived at Narcissus Island not long ago, so you don’t know much. But quite a lot of people knew about his background. He was the son of a big clan, but his family crossed a powerful enemy and his clan was then destroyed. He is the sole survivor.”

“One could say that he bears a deep feud and his arch-enemy is an incredibly powerful Second-Class Divine Demon.”

“He has an extremely strong desire to seek vengeance and worked very hard for it. Pity that he is of mediocre talent. Even after spending much effort to join Narcissus Island, he could only remain as an outer disciple. Although he has been standing out among the outer disciples in the past few years, with his progress speed, I’m afraid it doesn’t seem to be realistic for him to seek revenge.”

“Hence, he could only try his very best to fight for the opportunity to become a core disciple, even fighting to be under the wings of some experts.”

“And the result... You saw it yourself. He is willing to work for it, but luck isn’t on his side. His ability was truly not up to par in the last Selection, but this time, as far as I knew, he is the strongest in the Outer Court. However, Qian Xia found a Long Yang Fruit out of the blue and reached the Peak Stage Chaotic Realm after eating it!”

“A Peak Stage Chaotic Realm is that much stronger than Yin Long’s Middle Stage, hence Yin Long will have to fail the Selection once again. All he can do is to wait another three years, then he might stand a chance,” said Elder Yu Yang slowly.

“Wait for another three years?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

Three years was not a long period of time, but it was crucial for a thirty-something-year-old practitioner like Yin Long.

In three years’ time, given the environment he was placed in one could turn out one way or the other.

“In that sense, Senior Brother Yin Long’s fate is truly tragic,” said Jian Wushuang.

Elder Yu Yang shook his head. “It’s so, but one can’t help. Narcissus Island has its very own rules and he can’t break them unless he has an Elder’s Token as you do, but obviously he isn’t as fortunate.”

Jian Wushuang shrugged and soon left without continuing his chat with Elder Yu Yang. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Late at night, the bright mid sky moon was covering the entire Narcissus Island with a veil of light.

It was rather tranquil on the island.

On an empty field...

Schwing! Schwing! Schwing! Schwing!

Strips of blade light flashed one after another.

A stern-looking man in the middle of the field was entirely soaked in sweat. He had spent 70 to 80 percent of his divine power and a feeling of deep exhaustion wrapped around him.

Even so, the stern man’s eyes were still sharp as knives, swinging his battle blade nonstop, perfectly performing his set of blade forms.

He practiced very seriously and his forms were extremely forceful.

Not far from the field, Jian Wushuang held his arms together and quietly stood in an empty space.

“It’s so late at night and he’s still practicing. Senior Brother Yin Long is truly a hardworking and dedicated person,” said Jian Wushuang to himself.

He really admired people like Yin Long.

He was willing to give infinite effort for seeking vengeance and not wasting any second of his life.

He never thought of giving up even though knowing his result, position, and hope to seek revenge was faint.

“Perhaps, I could give him some pointers.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and mobilized his body. He was already on the field where Yin Long was when he reappeared.

Sensing that Jian Wushuang was there, Yin Long stopped his practice.

He retracted his blade and stood still, looking over at Jian Wushuang. “Junior Brother Wushuang, it’s already so late. Are you not resting?”

“I’m just bored and taking a walk. I stumbled upon your practice by chance and had some realization, so I came to ask you for some advice,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Advice? Do you mean try a few moves?” Yin Long was still extremely warm.

“That’s actually what I mean,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Haha! Sure, Junior Brother Wushuang. Let’s cross hands on this field. Come at me with all you have.” Yin Long stood there with a burst of hearty laughter. His tone resonated with his absolute confidence.

Jian Wushuang did not waste time on words as he turned his wrist and a regular long sword appeared in his hand.

At the same time, his divine power started spreading from his body.

“Early Stage Chaotic Realm?” Yin Long could feel the energy of his divine power and instantly smiled. “Well then, I’ll suppress my abilities and try my best to fight within the Early Stage Chaotic Realm.”

However, Jian Wushuang shook his hand. “No need, Senior Brother Yin Long. You can give your all, that’s what I really want to see.”

Yin Long raised his eyebrows and did not insist on the issue. “Is that right? Since that’s what you want, then stay alert.”

Jian Wushuang smiled nonchalantly.

Woosh!

Yin Long had taken his first move.

With a simple flash, he already appeared in front of Jian Wushuang with his battle blade silently swung out.

He was incredibly fast.

Of course, Yin Long was still holding back a little. Otherwise, he would be faster and the blade’s edge would be even colder.

They were merely trying hands and Jian Wushuang was his junior brother, he did not intend to hurt him.

However, just as he thought he could have defeated Jian Wushuang with that move, Jian Wushuang suddenly raised his head.

As he raised his head, he disappeared.

“Huh?” Yin Long’s face changed.

Right behind him, Jian Wushuang’s body appeared as Yin Long felt a burning pain on his arm. Looking at it, he realized there was a blade wound that came from nowhere and his battle blade had fallen to the ground.

“Senior Brother Yin Long, looks like I’ve won the first round.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice spoke behind him with an indifference tone.

Yin Long was a little stunned.

“How did that happen? The power that burst out of him in that instance was clearly of the Early Stage Chaotic Realm. It was weaker than mine, but how did he defeat me in an instant when we crossed blades?”
