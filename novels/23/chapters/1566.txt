Chapter 1567: The Old Floor Sweeper

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Master,” Chen Hu could not help but look at Jian Wushuang.

“Since you wish to go, go ahead. Why do you need to ask me?” Jian Wushuang laughed.

Chen Hu frowned slightly and looked at the white-robed man at once. He then said: “I can join the Rising Sun Palace. As for whether I can become a Deputy Palace Master, I am not very concerned. However, I have a condition. Please allow my Master go to the Rising Sun Palace with me.”

“Your Master?” the two experts from the Rising Sun Palace could not help but look at Jian Wushuang.

After looking at Jian Wushuang, the two of them had puzzled expressions.

They could tell that Jian Wushuang was not a martial artist and he was merely a normal person. Moreover, he was the kind of person who was about to die.

He was actually the Master of the Spear Demon who had made a name for himself in the Divine Light Dynasty?

“If you do not agree to this condition, the both of you can leave. I have said before that I will stay with my Master for my whole life,” Chen Hu said.

The two white-robed men looked at each other and one of them said soon after: “I cannot call the shots for this matter. Why don’t the both of you return to the Rising Sun Palace with us and at that time, the Palace Master will make a decision personally. If the Palace Master agrees to this, there would naturally be no problem.”

“Master,” Chen Hu looked at Jian Wushuang again.

“No problem. Let’s go,” Jian Wushuang laughed apathetically.

Under the guidance of the white-robed men, the two of them headed to the Rising Sun Palace at once.

Upon arriving at the Rising Sun Palace, Chen Hu had an audience with the Rising Sun Palace Master and he still stated his own conditions bluntly. As for the Rising Sun Palace Master, he muttered to himself many times before agreeing to allow Jian Wushuang to stay in the Rising Sun Palace. Jian Wushuang would go to the Rising Sun Palace’s Martial Arts Tower to help sweep the floor and tidy up the dust on the valuable martial arts books.

Jian Wushuang had no objection to this.

Thus, from that day on, Jian Wushuang allowed nature to take its course and stayed within the Rising Sun palace.

He would stay in the Martial Arts Tower every day to sweep the floor and it was neither good nor bad. Within the Rising Sun Palace, no one would pay attention to him; only Chen Hu would come by occasionally to visit him.

In the blink of an eye, another three years passed.

On this day, two Rising Sun Palace disciples walked toward the Martial Arts Tower.

Among the two disciples were one boy and one girl. The boy had black, long hair and he looked handsome. As for the girl, she was a young lady wearing a purple robe.

The two of them paused at the foot of the Martial Arts Tower and the black-haired handsome man asked: “Junior Sister, is the person who can help you solve the difficult martial arts problem really at the Martial Arts Tower?”

“I am not sure myself. However, Palace Master Chen Hu is the one who told me that. He said that the bottleneck that I have come across is a great threshold. Without advice from a supreme person, I might be unable to make it past the threshold forever. Palace Master Chen Hu is number one in spear skills in the Rising Sun Palace. If this is what he said, it is definitely not fake.”

“However, what I did not expect is that even though Palace Master Chen Hu and a few experts who were proficient in spear skills in the Rising Sun Palace had come down personally, none of them were able to give me the correct advice. This even caused the Palace Master to come down personally. However, he could not do anything either,” the purple-robed young lady gritted her teeth.

Martial arts bottleneck was indeed a great threshold. Moreover, the threshold that she encountered at the very moment would affect her achievements and destiny. Hence, she must think of all sorts of ways to overcome it.

“Thus, you came to this Martial Arts Tower?” the black-haired handsome man glanced at the purple-robed young lady.

“I have already thought of all sorts of ideas including going to my Master, Palace Master Chen Hu. However, even though all of them had tried all ways, they were still unable to do anything. But yesterday, Palace Master Chen Hu told me that in the whole Rising Sun Palace or even in the whole Divine Light Dynasty, there might only be one person who could help me and he is in the Martial Arts Tower,” the purple-robed young lady stared at the Martial Arts Tower with excitement.

“Let’s go there!”

The two of them stepped foot on the Martial Arts Tower.

However, after searching the whole Martial Arts Tower, they only found a normal old man who was sweeping the floor in the end.

“Junior Sister, could Palace Master Chen Hu be wrong? Where is the supreme person from the Martial Arts Tower?” the black-haired handsome man said gloomily.

“No, not possible. Palace Master Chen Hu would definitely not lie to me,” the purple-robed young lady shook her head repeatedly.

“However, in the whole Martial Arts Tower, there is only one person which is that old man sweeping the floor. Could he be that supreme person?” the black-haired handsome man frowned.

The purple-robed young lady’s expression turned icy cold. However, in the next moment, she went in front of the old floor sweeper.

They then stared at the white-haired old man who was sweeping the floor with great concentration carefully. However, no matter how they looked, they still felt that the old man was absolutely a normal person. Moreover, he might even be inferior to a normal person.

After taking a deep breath, the purple-robed young lady opened her mouth and spoke: “Greetings to elder. I am Zi Yi.”

The white-haired old man raised his head slowly and revealed an old face, “Do you have something for me?”

“I have encountered a bottleneck in my martial arts and I hope that elder can resolve it for me,” Zi Yi explained her objective directly. Of course, she did not mention that it was Palace Master Chen Hu who had told her to come.

After all, Palace Master Chen Hu had told her to absolutely not mention his name.

“Oh?” the white-haired old man shot a glanced toward Zi Yi and he exposed her straight away, “It’s that little kid Chen Hu who asked you to come, right?”

The eyes of Zi Yi and the black-haired handsome man brightened up.

They immediately understood that the white-haired old man in front of them was the supreme person who Palace Master Chen Hu mentioned.

“I hope that elder can help me!” Zi Yi greeted the white-haired old man respectfully.

“Haha. I am just a poor old man who is about to die. Yet, that little kid is still giving me trouble,” Jian Wushuang laughed indifferently and looked toward Zi Yi after that, “Great timing. I am quite tired now. Since you two little kids have come, both of you can help me to clean the Martial Arts Tower.”

“What?” Zi Yi and the black-haired handsome man were stunned.

The ‘supreme person’ in front of them did not even mention helping Zi Yi to resolve the bottleneck problem of her martial arts. Instead, he had asked the both of them to help him clean the Martial Arts Tower?

“Why? Are you unwilling to help an old man like me?” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“No, elder. Please take a rest by the side. I will take care of the rest,” Zi Yi took over the broom straight away.

“Junior Sister,” the black-haired handsome man looked over, “Are you really going to help him sweep the floor? This is manual labor to be done by servants.”

“Manual labor? Hmph, don’t even mention sweeping the floor. If it can help me to overcome the martial arts bottleneck, no matter how difficult the task is, I will not turn it down,” Zi Yi said. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“What if, after helping him to sweep the floor, he is still unable to solve your problem?” the black-haired handsome man said.

“Then treat it as me showing respect to an elderly,” Zi Yi continued to speak, “Senior Brother, if you are not willing to help, please stand by the side and not bother me.”

After finishing her speech, Zi Yi started to clean the Martial Arts Tower thoroughly.

The black-haired handsome man frowned and did not say much. He then stood by the side.

As for Jian Wushuang, he was lying down on the ground by the side. While lying down, he took out a bottle of wine and started drinking.

In the blink of an eye, more than an hour had passed and Zi Yi had cleaned up the whole Martial Arts Tower thoroughly. After that, she went to Jian Wushuang.

“Elder, I have finished helping you clean the Martial Arts Tower,” Zi Yi said, sounding tired.
