Bang!

A vigorous rumble echoed across the void. After the rumble, there was a figure that retreated rapidly. The figure constantly flipped as it retreated and finally calmed down.

“So strong!”

Jian Wushuang wiped off the blood stain at the corner of his lips as he spoke the compliment.

He performed a Dragon Roar with his all but it was suppressed by Chen Bin directly.

“He is so much stronger than I in unique skill. I would not be his match if I were to fight head on. I can only play that trick.”

Jian Wushuang’s face grew solemn as he oppressed the churning energy and blood in his body. The very next moment, he suddenly exploded and the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand suddenly shook vigorously.

“Blood!”

The long sword swept out as it revealed its earth-shaking power, and a soaring Soul Power exploded.

“Useless!”

Chen Bin’s gaze turned cold as he suddenly turned the purple long spear in his hand and let loose.

Rumble. A simple action that caused another explosion of earth-shattering power in an instant. It was an advanced rank three unique skill again.

When the two collided…

“Poof!”

Jian Wushuang spat a mouthful of blood and his face turned pale while he retreated.

As for Chen Bin, he easily collapsed Jian Wushuang’s Sword Principle, but the fierce Soul Attack in the Sword Principle caught him off guard.

However, Chen Bin was a genius at the end of the day. He had created an advanced rank three unique skill and his consciousness wasn’t weak either. He could compare favorably with an advanced Universe God in the Third Heaven. Although he was surprised by the hit of Jian Wushuang’s Soul Attack, it merely turned his face pale for a while before he recovered.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

“He deserves to be called the top genius in White Flame Palace. Even his consciousness is that fierce. Even if I perform the secret skill of Tian Yuan with my all, I might not be able to kill him. I could only severely damage him at most,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

In the void above, Lei Chao who was hanging in the air quietly suddenly contracted his pupils. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Just now, that was a consciousness attack?”

“No, it’s not consciousness, but…”

There was a flash in Lei Chao eyes and he resumed normalcy very quickly.

Swoosh!

Lei Chao appeared in the middle of the battlefield. He stole a glance at Chen Bin and said, “You saved yourself and also White Flame Palace.”

Chen Bin was stunned.

Lei Chao then looked towards Thunder Fire Sect Master, “the danger of Thunder Fire Sect has been resolved. I shall make a move.”

“Jian Wushuang, let’s go!”

“Yes.”

Jian Wushuang nodded. Without waiting for anyone’s response, the two of them made a move immediately.

…

After leaving Thunder Fire Sect, Lei Chao and Jian Wushuang moved forward. Soon, Lei Chao stopped on a remote mountain.

“Jian Wushuang,” Lei Chao looked at Jian Wushuang and asked, “Where did you get your Blood-killing Plate Armor?”

Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He had obtained the Blood-killing Plate Armor long ago but it was the first time someone had recognized it.

However, Jian Wushuang didn’t find it strange. After all, a top expert like Lei Chao was definitely knowledgeable and experienced. When he was fighting with Chen Bin, Lei Chao could recognize Blood-killing Plate Armor the moment it revealed its power.

Jian Wushuang immediately replied, “I obtained the Blood-killing Plate Armor from a Universe Master in my hometown.”

“Universe Master?” Lei Chao creased his eyebrows.

“Back then, the power that he revealed was merely Universe Master level. However, it might be because his fighting power was damaged,” Jian Wushuang said, “His name was Dao Yuanzi. He should be an expert from the Eternal Chaotic World. I don’t know why he came to my hometown and set up the great formation. The formation should be called the Life-devouring Formation. He wanted to refine all the living times in my hometown with it.”

“But I killed him in the end. So all his treasure fell into my hands, including this Blood-killing Plate Armor.”

Jian Wushuang was telling the truth and Lei Chao nodded without suspicion.

“It’s great that you got the treasure from killing him. You can continue to use Blood-killing Plate Armor but remember, don’t get involved with Holocaust Sect. Otherwise, you are making yourself an enemy with all the cultivators in the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries and the Eternal Chaotic World!” Lei Chao exhorted.

Jian Wushuang shook when he heard that.

He found out from King of Venomous Worms that the Holocaust Sect was hated by everyone in Eternal Chaotic World.

But he never thought that the experts in the Eternal Chaotic World would hate Holocaust Sect that much.

Anything that was related to the Holocaust Sect would cause one to become the other cultivators’ enemy.

“Tsk tsk,” Jian Wushuang pursed his lips and complimented.

“One more thing,” Lei Chao looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Inverse Cultivation!” Lei Chao said lightly.

The moment Jian Wushuang heard the two words, his face tremendously changed and there was surge of emotions in him.

“Why? You find it strange that I can tell you’re an inverse cultivator?” Lei Chao said coldly.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded subconsciously.

He was really shocked.

Because ever since he had started inverse cultivation, including the time he wandered in Eternal Chaotic World, it was the first time someone pointed out his identity as an inverse cultivator.

Of course, in Tian Yuan Mystery Land, the expert who gave him the secret skill of Tian Yuan would be able to tell his identity as an inverse cultivator. However, the expert didn’t reveal himself.

Then, Lei Chao talked to him face to face. Of course, Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Not just me. In the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, whoever studies Souls and knows a bit about Souls, such as experts who lit their Soul Power or prepared to light their Soul Power, could tell that it was a Soul Attack when you fought with Chen Bin earlier!” Lei Chao said.

Jian Wushuang shook.

What Lei Chao said revealed that he had studied a little about the Soul.

“You, a Universe God in the First Heaven, know a Soul Attack? Plus, your divine power is far beyond a Universe God in the First Heaven. How could an ordinary cultivator do that? Only an inverse cultivator which is rare in the Eternal Chaotic World, an existence which could light up the Soul Power during a Universe Master state could do that. Hence, I am sure that you are an inverse cultivator!” Lei Chao said faintly.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

He had been trying very hard to hide his identity as an inverse cultivator. Back then, in Dayu World, because he passed through the Inverse Cultivation Test, he had had no choice but the Master of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang recognized his identity as an inverse cultivator. However, he didn’t proactively tell anyone before.

However, he never expected that there were so many people who could recognize his identity as an inverse cultivator with the aid of his Soul within the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries.

“Inverse Cultivation is very rare. Especially rare for those who could pass through Inverse Cultivation Test. Almost one in hundreds of millions of years.”

Lei Chao continued.
