Chapter 2658: Sacred Palace Keeper

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

At the top of a grandiose and lavish black penthouse in Sacred Palace.

A slender, tall, and blonde middle-aged man sat next to a desk, reading a jade slip casually.

A silver-haired old man in a white robe entered hastily.

“Palace Keeper, we just received news that someone is coming our way through Sacred Heaven Road,” said the old man.

“Oh, the Sacred Palace is accepting a new genius disciple, that’s great.” The blonde middle-aged man answered casually, but his eyes were still on the jade slip.

“The thing is, the time he spent reaching the summit from Sacred Heaven Road was too short,” said the white-robed old man anxiously.

“Too short? How short?” The blonde middle-aged man finally put down the jade slip and looked downward.

The white-robed old man took a deep breath and slowly showed one finger.

“A year?” The blonde man nodded slightly, “If he can reach the peak in a year, that’s pretty good.”

“Not one year.” The old man shook his head.

“A month then?” The blonde man’s face began to turn serious, “Sacred Palace has countless geniuses, but those who can reach the summit in a month could be counted with one hand. Geniuses like this are worth our total support and nurture!”

“No, sir, not a month either, but...”

Before the old man finished, “Don’t tell me he only spent a day?” The blonde middle-aged man stood up suddenly, his eyes were shining.

“No. Not a day, but one hour. That man spent less than an hour on the Sacred Heaven Road to reach the peak!!” The white-robed old man finally finished his sentence.

“How’s that possible?”

Even the blonde middle-aged man—a top expert among the High-level Grand Ultimate Gods and also the respectable Sacred Palace Keeper—was shocked when he heard such news.

Reaching the summit through Sacred Heaven Road within an hour?

One had to understand that the Crimson Stone Saint had sacrificed a lot of effort when he was still alive to build the Sacred Heaven Road as a means to pick disciples for Sacred Palace.

There were incredibly difficult challenges along Sacred Heaven Road such that those who could get through within a year were considered very skillful geniuses.

If a month—a top genius.

One who spent one day was simply a super freak. There was not anyone who could reach the summit through Sacred Heaven Road in a mere day since the Sacred Palace’s establishment a long time ago.

Spending less than one hour...that was unimaginable!!

“Where’s he now?” The blonde middle-aged man seemed to be very excited.

“He has reached the summit and is now at Sacred Palace’s plaza,” said the white-haired old man wearing white robes.

“Let’s go, bring me to him,” said the blonde man immediately.

Crazy! A super freak who only spent less than one hour to reach the summit. Such a super freak was of course worth a personal greeting by the Sacred Palace Keeper.

Jian Wushuang stood there with his arms folded on the gigantic plaza at the Sacred Palace. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Numerous Sacred Palace disciples were surrounding him along with some Sacred Palace experts.

All of them were staring at Jian Wushuang while quietly discussing among themselves.

“It’s him. I was beside the Sacred Heaven Road just now and saw him stepping on the first step of Sacred Heaven Road to head upwards. He had reached the top of Sacred Heaven Road and came into the Sacred Palace in less than an hour.”

“Not even an hour? You’ve got to be joking! How come he can move so quickly?”

“Sacred Heaven Road is very difficult, especially the Consciousness Space challenge. He probably used incredible force to defeat them instead of finding a way to pass through his ten opponents. However, according to my knowledge of the last Consciousness Space thousandth step challenge—his opponents were all super strong Peak Earth Ultimate Gods. He managed to defeat them?”

“Although he’s only a High-level Earth Ultimate God, his battle strength is unheard of!”

“Monster. A monster has visited the Sacred Palace.”

The disciples had a fascinated look on their faces.

It was normal as Jian Wushuang had displayed extremely heaven-defying abilities.

However, they did not realize the abilities Jian Wushuang showed along Sacred Heaven Road was not even the tip of the iceberg.

It was indeed true he was just a High-level Earth Ultimate God, but his true battle strength was extremely strong even among High-level Heaven Ultimate Gods.

The Sacred Palace disciples would perhaps be frightened to death if he unleashed his full battle strength.

Jian Wushuang of course did not quite like to show off and would not have been acting so high profile were it not because he wanted to attract the Sacred Palace Keeper’s attention. He would have normally used the black stone to conceal his aura to disguise as having a Primary-level Heaven Ultimate God’s divine power aura so that the public would be more acceptable in the event he displayed powers slightly stronger than his supposed realm’s battle strength.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Two figures gilded speedily over and landed on the plaza in the blink of an eye before Jian Wushuang.

“Finally here?”

Jian Wushuang focused his eyesight and looked over at the blonde middle-aged man between the two.

He could sense the pressure brought to him by the blonde middle-aged man—a pressure Heaven Ultimate God could not possibly bring forth.

Only experts at the Grand Ultimate God level could bring him such heavy pressure.

It was clear who he was.

‘Is he the Sacred Palace Keeper?’ Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

The blonde man was staring at him too as he looked at him.

A powerful soul power shrouded Jian Wushuang’s entire body and he naturally also noticed Jian Wushuang’s facial disguise.

“He changed his face?” The blonde middle-aged man could see through it all, but he did not show it on his face, “Kid, welcome to the Sacred Palace. I’m Si Zhen, the Sacred Palace Keeper.”

“My pleasure to meet you, Palace Keeper Si Zhen.” Jian Wushuang bowed slightly but did not reveal his name.

“Follow me.” The blonde middle-aged man looked deeply at Jian Wushuang and did not ask any questions in front of the Sacred Palace disciples. He instead brought Jian Wushuang into the grand penthouse.

At the top of the penthouse, the blonde middle-aged man sent away the white-robed white-haired man before setting up a restrictive shield around them before he finally asked, “Kid, tell me who exactly are you?”
