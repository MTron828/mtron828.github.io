4393 Shocking Everyone

“Oh!”

Jian Wushuang looked at him expressionlessly and then walked to the Jade stone step by step in front of everyone’s eyes.

“Jian Wushuang, I’d like to see how long you’ve been cultivating!”

At this moment, Long Qing, Tian Luo Zi, and the others sneered.

“Little guy, press your hand on it.”

The Cosmos God stroked his beard and laughed.

Jian Wushuang nodded, took a deep breath, and pressed his hand on the Jade stone.

In an instant, the numbers that were originally zero began to change!

Everyone in the audience stared at the rapidly changing numbers.

Ding! Ding! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

A crisp sound was heard.

Seven…!

When the first number appeared, everyone was stunned for a moment, and then a smile appeared on their faces.

“Seven hundred chaos cycles, huh?”

“Hahaha, what sort of genius is he? he’s trained for more than seven hundred chaos cycles, even longer than I have, and yet he’s still just a trifling Omega Ruler.”

“Jian Wushuang, I’ve only cultivated for tens of millions of years, but you’ve cultivated for more than seven hundred chaos cycles. What qualifications do you have to compete with me?”

That Tian Luo Zi laughed even more insolently.

However, in the next moment.

The smile on his face froze.

Seventy!

The second number slowly stopped.

“N-no, not 700 chaos cycles. It should have been 70 chaos cycles!”

Everyone present was stunned. Seventy chaos cycles wasn’t a very long period of time. Many of the Omega Rulers had spent more time training than that.

For example, the Ninth Kalpa King had been stuck at the Ultimate Ruler Realm for dozens of chaos cycles.

“Seventy chaos cycles, huh? Hmph, that’s all there is to it.”

Tian Luo Zi squinted his eyes and sneered in his heart.

Seventy chaos cycles was indeed quite young, but compared to his age of seventy-nine million years, he was still far, far too young.

Everyone’s eyes flickered and they sneered as they continued to look at the Jade.

The next moment!

On the jade stone, Jian Wushuang’s cultivation time was completely fixed!

Seven hundred thousand years!

In an instant, the entire place fell into a dead silence.

Some of them were still holding their wine glasses, some of them were still softly discussing with the people around them, and some of them were still sneering.

However, at this moment, it was as if a spell had been cast on everyone. They were all frozen in that moment, looking at the Jade stone with a dazed expression. Their eyes were so shocked that they were about to fall out.

The whole place fell into a short silence, and then immediately burst into an uproar!

“Seven hundred thousand years? I’m not seeing things, right?”

“Hiss! What kind of concept was seven hundred thousand years? It takes me a million years to enter closed-door cultivation!”

“Impossible! Absolutely impossible! How could Jian Wushuang have only cultivated for seven hundred thousand years?”

At this moment, everyone went crazy with shock.

They looked at the clear numbers on the jade stone in shock. It was as if a storm was raging in their minds!

Long Qing, who had been high-spirited and looking down on the others, suddenly looked gloomy. The faces of others, such as Scarlet Sun Demon Master, were even uglier.

“There must be a mistake! How could Jian Wushuang have only cultivated for seven hundred thousand years? There must be something wrong with the Jade stone, or Jian Wushuang must have used some secret skill to deceive everyone! I don’t believe it!”

The Tian Luo Zi’s face turned red as he shouted.

700,000 years!

Not even a fraction of his!

“Are you doubting me?”

The Cosmos God still had a warm smile on his face, but his eyes were narrowed.

Instantly, Tian Luo Zi trembled and knelt down, saying that he did not dare to.

As for the other Supreme martial artists, including Long Qing, their expressions changed slightly when they saw this. They looked at each other and lowered their heads, not King of Day to say a word. They were as silent as cicadas in winter.

It was just a thought, but it grew in their minds like wild grass.

Jian Wushuang had only cultivated for seven hundred thousand years, yet he had already attained the body of an Ultimate Ruler and killed a Supreme. If he were to cultivate for another seven million years, seventy million years, or even tens of thousands of chaos cycles, what would he be like?

Everyone didn’t dare to think about it anymore. They only felt a chill from head to toe, and their scalps went numb.

Only Jian Wushuang remained calm.

“Child, come here.”

...

The Cosmos God smiled and beckoned Jian Wushuang to come and sit down.

“Alright,” he said.

Facing a Cosmos God, Jian Wushuang did not dare to delay any further. He quickly walked over and sat down in front of him.

In the Ling Xiao Palace, many Supreme martial artists saw the Cosmos God calling Jian Wushuang ‘child’ and asking him to sit down. Their expressions were extremely complicated.

Long Qing and the others were even more jealous.

“Blue ‘er, you told me before that you found a good seedling on the Ancient Path of Stars. He’s him, right?”

The Cosmos God looked at Bluey and asked.

“Yes, master, I’m talking about him.”

Bluey replied respectfully.

“Yes, it’s indeed not bad.”

The Cosmos God stroked his beard in satisfaction. Following which, some blood sighed and laughed, “Good, it’s been a long time since such a talent has appeared in our cosmos.”

...

After some thought, the Cosmos God looked at Jian Wushuang and smiled kindly, “Child, are you willing to take this old man as your master?”

His words were shocking!

As soon as he finished speaking, it was as if a bomb had been dropped in Ling Xiao Palace. Everyone’s body trembled, and their expressions were extremely shocked!

The Lord Cosmos God had actually spoken personally and wanted Jian Wushuang to acknowledge him as his master?

At that moment, everyone looked at Jian Wushuang with jealousy in their eyes.

Jian Wushuang might not know what the word ‘Cosmos God’ meant, but they knew that the Cosmos God was the real heaven in the universe!

Once Jian Wushuang acknowledged a Cosmos God as his master, it would be equivalent to Jian Wushuang having an immunity medallion in the universe. His status would be extremely honorable!

At that time, not to mention the dragon clan and the other six forces dealing with Jian Wushuang, they would probably immediately kneel in front of him, kowtow, admit their mistakes, and beg for his forgiveness.

In front of a Cosmos God, even if the ancestral Dragon or the Phoenix ancestor were to revive, they would not dare to act impudently, much less the Dragon race!

What was a meteoric rise?

This was called reaching the heavens in one step! Moreover, he had reached the 33rd layer of heaven in one step!

“Alliance master!”

“Jian Wushuang!”

At this moment, the Overlord cried out in alarm. Even the Ninth Kalpa King could no longer remain calm as his eyes flickered wildly.

Tian Luo Zi, who had once again been forgotten by everyone, clenched his fists tightly and gritted his teeth. He was extremely jealous!

Under everyone’s burning gaze, Jian Wushuang, the person involved, was not in a hurry to agree after a shock. Instead, a hint of hesitation flashed across his face.

There was no need to doubt that the Cosmos Gods were very powerful and had very high statuses.

Once he acknowledged a Cosmos God as his master, it could be said that he would obtain the greatest fortune in the universe. He would probably be able to get wind and rain whenever he wanted. From then on, he would be able to run amuck without fear and would have endless benefits.

Jian Wushuang understood all of this.

But…

There was a flash of hesitation in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. Then, he cupped his hands with a determined look and said, “Lord Cosmos God, thank you for your praise. It’s just that this brat already has a master.”
