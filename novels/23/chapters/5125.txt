Chapter 5126 - 5126: Return to the Battlefield

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The sound of the spear tearing through the air was like a collision of thunder!

Countless flickering black lightning surrounded the spear and Gu Yuan, its speed so fast that it reached Jian Wushuang’s forehead in an instant.

Standing beside Jian Wushuang, the young samanera suddenly opened his eyes and looked at Gu Yuan, who was like a Demon God. He was not afraid at all. He could only sigh that his strength was not enough. After 30 million years of cultivation, his strength had not even reached the peak of the Yan Immortal realm. Let alone Gu Yuan, even any corpse had the strength of a Grand Yan

Immortal realm. He was a burden on the battlefield and could not help at all.

His inner frustration and anger made the young Monk’s eyes turn bloodshot.

Now that Gu Yuan was attacking, the righteous cultivators by his side were also destined to fall. He had originally come to guide and help Yan Immortals ascend, but now he had become a burden, relying on others for protection just to stay alive.

He couldn’t understand why, given their mission to guide Transcendent Immortals, they were being attacked by these corpses. Why did several masters suddenly perish? They had even traversed the perilous Great Desolate Wilderness, so why were they falling here?

Filled with questions and frustration, he could only shout in anger, “I… I’ll stop you!”

Tears welled up in the young acolyte’s eyes. His hands, no longer in a prayer position, stood in front of Jian Wushuang’s small and delicate figure. He glared at Gu Yuan.

As if moved by lightning, the long spear paused in its tracks. The young acolyte was also momentarily stunned, looking at Gu Yuan with astonishment in his eyes. His body instinctively took a step back, bumping into Jian Wushuang behind him.

Jian Wushuang, whose consciousness had returned at an unknown moment, gently touched the young acolyte’s bald head with one hand.

“I promised your master that I would take you away.”

In the vast expanse of the cosmos, countless years were but a moment, and this was thanks to that fragment of Bodhi Heartwood.

At this moment, countless memories surged into his mind. He finally understood that it was the white-skinned monk who had summoned the Immeasurable Great Buddha to give him this Bodhi Heartwood.

Now that all the Monks had died in this starry sky, Jian Wushuang, whose state of mind had already changed, was expressionless.

He looked down at the young samanera and nodded at him.

“Kind Sir, don’t bother with me anymore. I’m just a burden. Leave me behind, and you might still have a chance to escape.”

The young Monk looked at Jian Wushuang. He did not want to burden him further, especially since his masters had all perished in this void. He had no desire to leave either.

Jian Wushuang, with a calm demeanor, gave a faint smile.

“Just hold onto my arm, close your eyes, and soon we’ll be able to break free.”

Now, he had broken through to the Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal realm. In the billions of years in the starry sky, he mastered the Ultimate Sword Dao up the the fifth level.

At this moment, even if he were to face a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, he had confidence in escaping. Of course, if that resurrected being came after him personally, then there wouldn’t be much hope.

However, based on his mental perception, that entity should not have fully revived yet. Although the blue-colored ancient hall had emerged, the corpses inside the hall clearly couldn’t be easily mobilized.

His gaze sharpened as his aura swept the surroundings.

The Wushuang Divine Sword pointed directly at Gu Yuan’s Thunder Spear, and the collision between the two produced no visible power fluctuations, but it halted Gu Yuan’s advance.

This was the terror of Heart power, battling invisibly.

“What power is this!”

Under the influence of Heart power, his body couldn’t help but tremble, and the spear in his hand fell.

Countless skeletal warriors also came to a standstill.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qian He, who stood in the distant void, looked puzzled and shouted angrily, “Go, you fools!”

“I never expected that a Three Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal could wield such power!”

Qian He’s figure was elusive, her hand held a broken knife, and she unleashed countless afterimages in a continuous series of strikes. Yet, she herself did not approach Jian Wushuang.

Immediately, she sent a message to the leader of the skeletal warriors guarding the road of Immortal bones.

“The enemy is very mysterious, hurry to support, so as not to disturb our Lord!”

In the desolate ruins of Gu Lu, countless corpses continued to resurrect and crawl out of deep pits.

The leader of the skeletal warriors, holding a giant blade in his hand, turned his head to look at the aerial battlefield.

“Youdou, Youcheng, now that you two have revived, guard our Lord here. I will go and exterminate the lackeys of Zhen Wuyang!”

The leader of the skeletal warriors slowly stood up. His figure was sturdy, and his battle armor was covered in dark bloodstains, all remnants from the ancient battles. If Gu Yuan was a maniac, obsessed with battle, then this skeletal leader was a cold-blooded butcher who could sit silently tor ten thousand years or massacre thousands of immortals with a single breath.

He was none other than the renowned ‘Xiang Bingyun’, a Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal in the Ancient Era.

“General Pang, rest assured, we will handle things here with my brother. When the Asura Temple emerges, the grand plan will be irreversible, and no one can stop us.”

Youdou and Youcheng were the guardians of the Asura Temple and the lord’s closest attendants, both perfect ninth-level Daoist Immortals.

This was the terrifying power of Emperor-level forces. In most domains, there were no Emperors, and in each era, there were only two or three Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal.

It was easy to imagine how powerful the Great Si Region had been. With five Emperors coexisting, there were dozens of Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, not to mention the countless Grand Yan Immortals.

Despite the passage of time since that battle, the Great Si Region had never been able to regain its former glory.

Xiang Bingyun’s eyes were steady, and with a single step, he arrived directly on the battlefield.

At this moment, Qian He was doing her best to hold back Jian Wushuang, while Gu Yuan’s mental state had deteriorated, causing his strength to decline significantly. However, he still refused to let go, firmly holding onto Jian Wushuang and preventing him from moving.

“Another newcomer? I don’t know which Emperor has revived this time, but I won’t be here to welcome him,” Jian Wushuang said.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang’s sword aura surged, and a faint aura of primordial energy enveloped his entire body. This was the energy that existed at the beginning of the universe, long since disappeared as the vitality of the universe had grown, but he now possessed the complete Ultimate Dao. Not only the initial universe, but even the entire cosmos was under his control.

The powerful primordial energy instantly corroded her entire body, but fortunately, it wasn’t a lethal amount, and it did not take her life.

As for the crazed Gu Yuan, he had no such luck, or perhaps he was just foolish. Instead of dodging, he chose to directly face Jian Wushuang’s attack.

Primordial energy combined with Heart power.

Gu Yuan’s figure instantly froze in place.

Xiang Bingyun, who had just entered the battlefield, couldn’t intervene in time.

“Kneel!”

Jian Wushuang’s figure flashed, and his formidable Heart power quickly eroded

Gu Yuan.

With cloudy eyes, Gu Yuan trembled and knelt down unsteadily, then respectfully called out, “Master!”
