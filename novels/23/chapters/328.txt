Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Naturally, the cold man was Yang Zaixuan.

He stood there cold and alone, attracting no attention.

Jian Wushuang glanced through the crowd, only taking notice of Yang Zaixuan. He thought that Wine Master, Lady Black, and others were probably hiding.

Dung!

A deep and grave bell sounded. Many figures slowly walked toward the platform from off in the distance. They were experts from Ice Nether Valley, led by the Valley Master.

“Is that Ye Chen?” Jian Wushuang noticed a figure in the crowd.

He was a young man in a light golden formal dress and looked dignified and handsome. He wore a gentle smile that left a kind and polite impression on people. At that moment, like Jian Wushuang, countless people on the platform stared at the young man.

After all, the young man was one of the main characters of this big wedding.

“Haha, I’m sorry to have kept you waiting,” the Valley Master of Ice Nether Valley said in a clear and loud voice, “Here, serve the wine.”

Immediately, a lot of disciples from Ice Nether Valley came forward with wine jars, pouring wine into the experts’ glasses.

Although Jian Wushuang was in the solitary expert region, he still received a bowl of wine.

“Thanks a million for coming. Please allow me to make a toast to all of you with this bowl of wine.” Ye Chen was the first one to stand up, raising up his bowl and showing a modest pose as he drank the bowl of wine.

Giving face to Ye Chen, the experts on the platform also drank the wine.

Except for Jian Wushuang, who directly poured his wine on the ground.

“Aha. It’s a pity to waste such good wine,” Chi Mei, who was beside him, laughed and said.

“I’m not willing to drink his wine,” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

Chi Mei frowned, but didn’t say anything.

“Master Ye Chen, why are you the only one at your wedding? Where is your wife?” a purple-haired elder in the Sect region asked with a bright laugh.

“Exactly. Ye Chen, you should invite your wife here.” Nie Wuxin also commented and laughed.

Hearing this, Ye Chen revealed a smile on his face and glanced at the Ice Nether Valley Master. After seeing the latter nod, he stood up again and then clapped.

Clap! Clap!

The clapping sound echoed. Then, the next moment... Dung! Dung! Peng! Peng! Boom!

The deep and grave bell, a thick and vigorous drum, the hint of a fierce gong, as well as the long and long soulful sound of an Amphion lyre, abruptly sounded throughout the area.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Suddenly, several sounds of monsters sounded and four huge monsters entered everyone’s sight.

Each of them was over three meters high, and the four monsters looked like four mountains.

These four huge monsters were a kind of spirit beast that was similar to a rhino. They had rough and thick skin with sharp horns on their forehead. They pulled a carriage made of colored glass while walking forward, through the air.

“Unicorn?”

“The extremely rare Unicorn, well-known for its dignity, is a beast at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“He actually has four Unicorns pulling the carriage. How glamorous!”

“What a grand and impressive wedding!”

Immediately, people were overjoyed and shocked by what they saw.

Inside of that carriage sat Su Rou.

Today, Su Rou was in a light pink dress, that trailed behind on the ground, with a cloud belt tightened around her slender waist, which made her seem very lithe. Her hair was tied up into a bun with a coral hairpin, which caused her gorgeous face to look even more beautiful, like a blooming flower.

Her beauty was intoxicating.

All the people had been attracted by Su Rou’s beauty.

On the forefront, stood Ye Chen, smiling. His heart was full of excitement as he looked at the absolute beauty in the Glazed Carriage.

“I have been waiting for 10 years. This day is finally here.”

“It’s almost time.”

A hint of craze spontaneously appeared in Ye Chen’s eyes.

The reason he was feeling so impatient was not that he was marrying Su Rou, but because of Su Rou’s virginity.

The Extreme Yin Body of a virgin was an absolute treasure.

While all the people on the platform were busy staring at Su Rou, Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan looked at each other, then slightly nodding their heads. The next moment, they slowly strode forward and quickly arrived at the center of the platform, blocking the path of the Glazed Carriage.

“What?” All the warriors were confounded and looked at the two in surprise.

“What are they trying to do?”

Curiosities emerged from the bottom of everyone’s heart.

“Fourth Sister, why didn’t you tell us about your wedding? That’s not very nice, is it?” Jian Wushuang’s voice echoed.

It was not until Su Rou heard this that her cold expression and the blank look in her eyes changed.

Su Rou recognized Jian Wushuang’s voice immediately, even though he covered his face with a bamboo hat.

“Wushuang? Zaixuan?” Su Rou felt astonished.

Jian Wushuang raised his head and looked at Su Rou while smiling.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

The two figures blocking the Glazed Carriage instantly moved, rushing toward the Glazed Carriage.

“What?”

“Oh no!”

All the experts in the area were shocked.

Many experts from the Ice Nether Valley stood up, and the Valley Master’s face instantly became gloomy.

“They are courting death!”

There was a man sitting on the back of one of Unicorns?that was pulling the Glazed Carriage. He was the driver of the four Unicorns. When he saw Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan rushing toward the Glazed Carriage, he snorted coldly.

The Four Unicorns possessed intelligence, so they became fierce. They raised their four single horns and violently dashed toward Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan.

They were all spirit beast at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm. Not only did they have the sharpest horns, they also possessed great power.

“Evil monsters, get out of my way!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice thundered, instantaneously radiating a mighty killing intent.

The dashing Unicorns stared with their huge eyes, but their steps instantly paused in the air and they made no further movements.

Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan appeared in front of the carriage with no one blocking them. After chopping off the chains connecting the four Unicorns and the Glazed Carriage, Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan stood on opposing sides of the Glazed Carriage and quietly began floating in the air.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

In the area surrounding them, a large number of figures appeared in quick succession.

Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan had been completely surrounded by many experts from Ice Nether Valley.
