Chapter 581: The Strongest Killing Move!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Up in the air, Jian Wushuang was still fighting fiercely with Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, which created huge energy storms.

The ground below was full of miserable potholes, as if doomsday had arrived.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

They finally separated.

Jian Wushuang and the Golden Sword Soul Phantom behind him exuded an even stronger Supreme Sword Essence.

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, as one of the three Monster Emperors, is that your real strength?” Jian Wushuang said with a hint of excitement.

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, who was covered with Amethyst Scales, stared at Jian Wushuang with his weird purple eyes.

“You’re pretty good to be able to fight with me for so long and not lose, but this is the end.”

“I’ll use my Killing Move now. Whether or not you survive depends on your luck.”

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor’s voice was cold and determined. Obviously, he had absolute confidence in his Killing Move.

“Killing Move?” Jian Wushuang stared at him.

The Temple Masters who knew a little bit about Crystal-armored Monster Emperor changed their expressions when they heard his words.

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor’s Killing Move!”

“That move!”

“Sevenfold Demonic Killing!”

The Temple Masters all shuddered at the thought of his Killing Move.

Even Temple Master Black Spirit slightly narrowed her eyes and thought,??“The Sevenfold Demonic Killing of Crystal-armored Monster Emperor is extraordinarily powerful. I wonder whether this boy can block it.”

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor started his attack.

He took a deep breath and then...

“Howl!”

A monstrous roar broke out from Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, which shook the whole area as it swept out in all directions.

Jian Wushuang was closest to Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, so he was immediately hit by this roar.

“Sound Wave Attack!”

Jian Wushuang responded seriously but without any fear.

The Sound Wave Attack hit him directly and rushed into his body, causing his blood and aura to become turbulent.

But that was all.

After Jian Wushuang made his breakthrough to the Nine-cloud Realm, his body had improved to a superb state, causing his skin, bones, and organs to become extremely tough. Therefore, this Sound Wave Attack had almost no effect on him.

But the Sound Wave Attack was just the beginning.

The moment the Sound Wave Attack spread out, Crystal-armored Monster Emperor had already moved. He was as fast as lightning and appeared right in front of Jian Wushuang.

His hands stretched out and turned into two claws, fiercely attacking towards Jian Wushuang.

“The second killing!” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor shouted in a low voice.

Before Jian Wushuang could recover from the Sound Wave Attack, the second attack of Crystal-armored Monster Emperor had already arrived. Jian Wushuang changed his facial expression and stepped backwards quickly.

“The third killing!” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor exclaimed in a cold voice. He suddenly turned around and a long tail appeared behind him. The tail was covered with Amethyst Scales and was as sharp as a saber. It targeted Jian Wushuang and swept toward his head.

“So fast!” Jian Wushuang was greatly taken aback.

The tail was so fast that he was surprised. Fortunately, his reaction was also fast. While he was stepping backwards, he stabbed the tail with his Heart-killing Sword.

Clang!

As the metal collision sounded, the tail was hit to one side.

“The fourth killing!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor growled again. The Amethyst on his body trembled as it grew to cover his whole body, giving him the appearance of an Amethyst hill as he violently rushed towards Jian Wushuang.

Once Jian Wushuang steadied himself, he had to dodge to another side immediately so as to avoid the “Amethyst hill”. It was so close that he lost his calm manner.

“The fifth killing!”

“The sixth killing!”

Two fierce attacks arrived successively. Jian Wushuang struggled to resist them, but he had completely lost his balance and had no opportunity to counterattack.

“The seventh killing!”

The cold voice once again reverberated throughout the area.

As Jian Wushuang was steadying himself and preparing to attack, a huge fist suddenly came down from above him like a thunderbolt.

The huge fist came from Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, who had turned into an Amethyst covered Demonic Beast and was releasing a ferocious aura.

It was too sudden and unexpected.

Jian Wushuang did not have time to finish his sword move. He could only struggle to lift the Heart-killing Sword.

BANG!

The huge purple fist pounded down onto the Heart-killing Sword. Its terrifying power descended and forced the Heart-killing Sword to hit Jian Wushuang in the chest. The violent power passed through the sword and still managed to strike Jian Wushuang.

Immediately Jian Wushuang shot downward like a meteorite, crashing into the ground so heavily that a huge crater, several meters deep, appeared, causing broken stones and dust to blast out.

Up in the air, a figure flickered and then Crystal-armored Monster Emperor reappeared. His indifferent purple eyes looked down towards the pit below. At this moment, the whole battlefield had become quiet.

Some of the human experts looked at the bottom of the pit while others turned towards Crystal-armored Monster Emperor in horror.

“Sevenfold Demonic Killing. This is Crystal-armored Monster Emperor’s strongest killing move, Sevenfold Demonic Killing!”?Temple Master Iceberg shuddered.

His strongest Killing Move actually consisted of seven different attacks.

Each of the seven attacks were unimpressive on their own. They were actually weaker than ordinary Martial Arts Techniques since they were just simple attacks.

However, the combination of the seven attacks created a terrifying momentum.

The seven consecutive attacks were all unexpected and incredibly powerful, not giving the opponent enough time to resist.

Jian Wushuang did not know anything about the Sevenfold Demonic Killing. Even those Temple Masters who knew the secret of the this Killing Move still could not resist it.

The seven attacks seemed to be simple since they were just outrageous ways of close combat, but they were extremely frightening when used by Crystal-armored Monster Emperor!

“Is Sword Emperor still alive?”

The human experts were staring at the bottom of the pit attentively. They had seen that the last blow from Crystal-armored Monster Emperor did not land directly on Jian Wushuang because it was blocked by the long sword. However, everyone still believed that Jian Wushuang would be dead or at least seriously injured after that attack.
