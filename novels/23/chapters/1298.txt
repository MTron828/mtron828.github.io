“You want to fight against Universe God Qing Yang?” The Master of Scarlet Island was surprised.

Jian Wushuang smiled and replied, “Universe God Qing Yang was at the top amongst the Universe Gods in the First Heaven in Dayu World. I wish to fight against such a figure, and he said that he would undergo the God Test in the Second Heaven soon. Once he undergoes the God’s Test, he will be leaving Dayu World to wander around. By then, I won’t have a way to get another chance to fight with him.”

“Now, the one and only chance is before my eyes, how could I let it go?”

“Universe God Qing Yang obviously wanted to kill you. You will still be a Universe Master one year later. Are you confident you can fight against him then?” The Master of Scarlet Island had his eyebrows tightly knitted together.

“Not now, but I might be after a year,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Might be?” The Master of Scarlet Island couldn’t accept his answer.

“Island Master, as I am brave enough to agree to fight with Universe God Qing Yang, I naturally am confident. The fight in a year’s time… even if I can’t win against him, it won’t be a problem for me to stay alive. Don’t you worry,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“As long as you can stay alive,” the Master of Scarlet Island nodded, but didn’t ask any further questions.

After sending the Master of Scarlet Island off, Jian Wushuang started cultivating in seclusion.

In the secret room, Jian Wushuang sat alone.

“I am just a Universe Master. Although I have the achievement of killing a Universe God in the First Heaven, my fighting power is merely very similar to a Universe God in the First Heaven. I’m afraid no one would believe that I am going to defeat Universe God Qing Yang in our fight one year later,” Jian Wushuang mumbled to himself, but the corner of his lips lifted into a smile.

When he accepted the challenge, he knew that there must be a lot of people who thought he had made an impulsive decision and that it was unwise.

However, who would know him better than himself?

A year’s time looked short. However, to Jian Wushuang, it was sufficient for him to digest most of his gains from his ten years of resolving the Little Scattered Stars Game. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He resolved a total of thirty-five moves in the Little Scattered Stars Game within ten years!

The Little Scattered Stars Game, every move resolved meant that the nature of swordsmanship was accumulated to a new level.

Especially from the thirty-third move onwards.

He resolved till the thirty-fifth move and his understanding towards swordsmanship reached a whole new level.

His current level was much higher compared to before. Even if he only digested half of the accumulated nature of swordsmanship, it would still lead to tremendous improvement in his power!

Although he wasn’t certain if he could defeat Universe God Qing Yang after a year, he was sure that he could survive Universe God Qing Yang’s match in a year.

As for the fact that Universe God Qing Yang wanted to kill him… He had an embodiment of Blood-killing Plate Armor, his divine body was extremely strong and he had his last card, Secret Skills of Star Palace. Hence, it was plainly nothing more than an extravagant hope of Universe God Qing Yang.

Because he knew all this, he wasn’t willing to let the chance slip. That’s why he agreed to fight against Universe God Qing Yang.

“The accumulated nature of swordsmanship from resolving thirty-five moves…”

“One year’s time…”

“Let’s begin!”

Jian Wushuang held both his fists tight and shut his eyes in the next second.

…

When Jian Wushuang was in seclusion, the Universe God Jiu Hai of Holy Prefecture came to Dayu Palace too.

In the courtyard, the Universe God Jiu Hai was seated opposite Universe God Qing Yang.

“Jian Wushuang has been in Dayu Palace but I have never found a chance to kill him. It’s great now that I don’t have to look for a chance, but you could take action more straightforwardly. In the upcoming fight, just killing him will do,” the Universe God Jiu Hai laughed happily.

“At first, I did not carry much hope. But I never thought he would accept the challenge so easily. I wonder if he was really confident or if he was just too silly,” Universe God Qing Yang sneered, but his gaze was cold, “Within a year’s time, even if he improved tremendously, how much could he really improve? Would he be able to reach Chu Xiao’s level?”

“To Chu Xiao’s level? Humph, he must be dreaming!” The Universe God Jiu Hai spat, “He is only a Universe Master. It is already unbelievable that his fighting power is at the current level and he wants to level it up more?”

“Unless he could pass the God’s Test and become a Universe God in the First Heaven. Otherwise, he doesn’t stand a chance,” Universe God Qing Yang smiled.

To Universe God Qing Yang, the only one left who qualified to bother him in Dayu World, was Jian Wushuang.

However, the reason why Jian Wushuang bothered him was that Jian Wushuang might be qualified for a fight with him if he were to undergo God’s Test and become a Universe God in the First Heaven. As it was, he wasn’t concerned about Jian Wushuang.

He wasn’t even concerned about the fight that was going to happen in a year’s time.

From what he saw, the fight was destined to be Jian Wushuang’s grave.

“Master, do you know that Lord Wu Cang has been staying in Dayu Palace,” Universe God Qing Yang suddenly said.

“Lord Wu Cang?” The Universe God Jiu Hai was astonished. He obviously knew who Lord Wu Cang was.

“Lord Wu Cang carries an important role in Snow Dojo. He seems to have authority too. Previously, regardless of if it was the chess game or the fight between Chu Xiao and I, Lord Wu Cang saw. One of the biggest reasons why I reveal my abilities in Dayu Palace was because of Lord Wu Cang,” Universe God Qing Yang said.

“You are trying to catch Lord Wu Cang’s attention and ask him for a recommendation?” The Universe God Jiu Hai squinted his eyes.

“Yes,” Universe God Qing Yang nodded in agreement, “Snow Dojo, the genius concentration camp in Snow Kingdom, also a place I have been yearning for. It’s a pity that it is too difficult to get into Snow Dojo without recommendation. This is a great opportunity for me. If Lord Wu Cang were to have his eyes on me, he could recommend me. Maybe I would be able to get into the Snow Dojo. By then, my talent could be fully into play.”

“Lord Wu Cang, has he ever looked for you?” The Universe God Jiu Hai asked.

Universe God Qing Yang shook his head, “He should have noticed me before Fairy Palace but he didn’t say anything then. Maybe I didn’t show my power enough and I have yet to impress him. I didn’t give my all when I was fighting with Chu Xiao after all. Hence, regardless of Jian Wushuang’s ability, I will give out my strongest ability when I am fighting with Jian Wushuang one year later. I will kill him smooth;y and cleanly, and let Lord Wu Cang get a good look at my abilities!”

Then, Universe God Qing Yang couldn’t help but hold his fists tight. His eyes were twinkling with an unprecedented shine too.

“Snow Dojo, I have to get in there!”

“It’s where I really belong!”

“No one can stop me!”
