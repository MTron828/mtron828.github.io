Chapter 2264 Leng Ruxue’s Appearance

While the great emperors from the Eternal Chaotic World were looking at the experts from the ancient past, the one hundred and thirty eight experts were also studying them with interest.“Are those experts from the Sanctuary Alliance?”

“Yes. The two leaders, Emperor Bai and Sword Emperor, are incredibly powerful people.”

“Humph. Incredible? Only in this Heaven and Earth. If they were in the Absolute Beginning Divine World, they would be nothing without the Restriction of Heaven and Earth.”

“Looks like Sanctuary Alliance also knows that the passageway is about to open at Heaven’s Horizon. Why are they here?”

“Who knows? They can do whatever they want as long as they do not stop us from returning to the Absolute Beginning Divine World.”

“We did follow the rules within Heaven and Earth. We did not provoke Sanctuary Alliance at all. They have no reason to stop us. Even if they want to stop us, they must have the ability to do so.”

“That is true.”

The experts from the ancient past chatted casually.

They did not hide their disdain towards the great emperors from Sanctuary Alliance.

Many of them did not even take Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang seriously.

Those experts from the Ancient Past only feared Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang due to the presence of Restrictions of Heaven and Earth. Without it, they would be nothing.

Even though the great emperors from the Eternal Chaotic World were angry at the disdainful comments, they did not dare to act out.

“The passageway is about to open, but the master of the Holocaust Sect has yet to appear,” Emperor Bai knitted his eyebrows tightly and said.

“No hurry. Let us wait patiently,” Jian Wushuang said calmly.

He had a lot of patience.

He knew that Leng Ruxue would definitely come if she were to return to the Absolute Beginning Divine World.

It would be better if she did not turn up as that meant she had definitely stayed behind and Jian Wushuang would not need to go up against the experts from the ancient past.

Right then...

Hum!!

A unique wave appeared from the black mist at Heaven’s Horizon.

Countless numbers of waves spread in all directions like ripples on the surface of a lake.

The entire dark space was filled by the unique wave.

“Is it starting?”

Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai’s irises constricted in shock.

Heaven’s Horizon on its own. This meant that the experts from the Absolute Beginning Divine World on the other side started opening the passageway.

The one hundred and thirty eight experts from the ancient past also noticed this.

They were all elated when they saw the wave gradually getting larger.

“It is starting, the overlords are opening the passageway!”

“Finally!”

“Haha. Am I really going to return to the Absolute Beginning Divine World after being in a slumber for so long?”

Elation, excitement, anticipation!

These emotions were written clearly on the faces of the experts from the ancient past.

These experts had been trapped in this Heaven and Earth for far too long.

Ever since this Heaven and Earth had been sealed off using the great formation in the ancient past, they had been completely isolated from their hometown.

Their family, friends and clans were all back in the Absolute Beginning Divine World. Who would not miss their hometown?

It was a pity they had not been able to do anything to return for such a long period of time.

Today, they had finally got their change to leave.

How could they not be elated and excited?

At the same time that the change occurred to Heaven’s Horizon, two figures appeared in this space.

Jian Wushuang immediately fixed his gaze on one of the figures.

“They are finally here,” Emperor Bai said as he too looked at the two figures.

One of them was a young lady wearing white clothes and a veil.

Even though the young lady was wearing a veil and no one could see what she looked like, many of the experts were attracted to her aura.

This young lady in white clothes was, without a doubt, Leng Ruxue!!

The man who came with Leng Ruxue was over three metres tall and was built like a mountain.

This buff man was Bing Shan.

“Lord Bing Shan, Hall Master Leng!”

The experts from the ancient past controlled their emotions and greeted the two respectfully when they saw who they were.

Bing Shan was a very powerful man, inferior to only the Master of Holy Land. Leng Ruxue was the lineal disciple of Master of Holy Land. Both had incredible backgrounds.

The experts from the ancient past should treat them with respect.

“Master has already started. If everything goes well, the passageway will be opened in half an hour. However, my Master has also told me that they can only keep the passageway open for ten breaths. There is nothing he can do if we do not leave by then,” Leng Ru Xue said.

“Ten breaths? If no one were to stop us, we could pass through the passageway almost instantly. However, if someone were to try and stop us, the situation would be different,” Bing Shan said coldly.

He looked at the experts from Sanctuary Alliance as he said so.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang was also looking at them. To be more precise, he was looking at Leng Ruxue.

“Things will not be as smooth sailing as they could be.” Leng Ruxue smiled lightly.

She met Jian Wushuang’s eyes. She knew what he was about to do.

Jian Wushuang had come for her. How could he allow her to step foot into that passageway?

He started walking from the space where the great emperors from the Sanctuary Alliance were.

“Are you going to do it now?” Emperor Bai knitted his eyebrows and said.

The best time to stop Leng Ruxue was when the experts from the ancient past were rushing towards the passageway when it opened.

At that point in time, all of the experts from the ancient past would be fixated on returning to the Absolute Beginning Divine World.

At that point in time, Jian Wushuang only had to stop one person instead of fighting them all as the experts would be selfish and would want to go back to Absolute Beginning Divine World immediately. It would be less likely they would be worrying about others if the passageway was right in front of their eyes. After all, the passageway could not last long.

Hence, the probability of success was much higher.

However, there were also other risks if they were to stop her after the passageway opened.
