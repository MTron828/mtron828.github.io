Chapter 189: Sky Valley

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The flashing cold sword light crashed against the virtual blade flash that was formed using Spiritual Power.

The cold sword light instantly crushed the blade light as easy as stepping on dead grass.

“What?” a surprised gleam appeared in Gu Changsheng’s eyes, “This Gold Core...”

He was a warrior at the Peak Profound Yin Void Realm. To resist his blade light, an ordinary warrior in the Initial Yin Void Realm would need to use their full strength.

For warriors beneath the Yin Void Realm, they wouldn’t even be able to survive.

But this Gold Core Realm warrior not only warded off, but also smashed his blade light in only an instant.

CHUU!

The sword shadow appeared in front of Gu Changsheng like a sinister viper.

Gu Changsheng sneered, and a cyan saber suddenly appeared in his hands. A strong Raging Fire Essence radiated from the saber and then slashed towards Jian Wushuang.

Clang!

During this violent fight, he had used his full power.

“What?” Gu Changsheng was shocked when he realized that he was being dominated in this fight. He was even forced to retreat several steps by the counterforce of the attack.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang quickly brandished his longsword again, as the shadow of his sword turned into a ray of flowing light.

“Selfless Sword Technique, Idealistic Form!”

Shua!

A glaring and flowing light appeared in front of Gu Changsheng, drifting through the air like a whisper. Gu Changsheng didn’t dare belittle Jian Wushuang again, continuously swinging his saber in an attempt to strike back.

However, it was already too late to?force Jian Wushuang back.

Bang!

With the collision of these terrifying powers, Gu Changsheng grunted and stepped back awkwardly.

Killing intent flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

Shua!

A streak of sword light quickly swept forward.

It moved at an incredible speed.

The move Jian Wushuang displayed just now was the ninth move of the Formless Sword Art.

Though his overall strength had not improved too much in the past two months, his level of swordsmanship and sword skill still improved, and he had already grasped the ninth move of the Formless Sword Art.

Now, the ninth move flew towards Gu Changsheng’s throat at an amazing speed.

Gu Changsheng’s eyes were full of unwillingness.

He didn’t want to lose like this, because he had not displayed his full strength yet, and he hadn’t even had a chance to.

If he could get one more chance, even if it was a straightforward battle with Jian Wushuang, he would not be afraid. But it was already too late.

Plop!

Gu Changsheng’s body dropped to the ground, while Jian Wushuang looked at his body with ice-cold eyes. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“You are so cocky, so you didn’t take me seriously.” Jian Wushuang shook his head with a smile.

With Jian Wushuang’s true strength, he could just barely fight against someone in the Exceptional Yin Void Realm, but Gu Changsheng was at the Peak Profound Yin Void Realm. Jian Wushuang’s strength was just a little bit stronger than his.

Jian Wushuang believed that he could suppress him but couldn’t kill him in a head-on battle.

After all, once a warrior in the Yin-Yang Void Realm chose to Voidwalk, Jian Wushuang would be unable to fight with them.

However, Gu Changsheng looked down on him from the beginning. He did not use his full strength to resist Jian Wushuang’s moves, and Jian Wushuang took advantage of this by using his full strength.

In just a few moves, Gu Changsheng had been killed by Jian Wushuang before he had time to show his true ability.

After killing Gu Changsheng, Jian Wushuang bent over and took the Blood Jade Armlet.

After taking the Blood Jade Armlet, Jian Wushuang smiled and muttered, “With this Blood Jade, my armlets should be enough to meet the requirement!”

“Tang Wuji, let’s go.”

Jian Wushuang just turned around and left, with Tang Wuji rushing to follow him.

They left the cold body of Gu Changsheng lying on the ground, surrounded by a group of shocked bandits.

Even the beautiful face of White Lady was full of panic.

“That was the combination of three sword essences, Gale, Raging Fire, and Waterdrop.”

“A Profound Yin Void Realm warrior was just killed by someone in the Profound Gold Core Realm!”

“That exceptional genius should be from one of the 12 Dynasties who joined the Easternmost Hunt.”

...

After claiming Gu Changsheng’s Blood Jade Armlet, Jian Wushuang believed he had reached the requirement for passing the first stage, so he didn’t want to fight with fugitives in the little bit of time that remained.

Night time quickly arrived.

“Tang Wuji.”

Jian Wushuang looked at Tang Wuji, threw him an Interspatial Ring, and said, “I’ve killed many Yin Void warriors these last few days. Everything I got from them is in that ring I just gave you.”

“Boss, what do you want me to do?” Tang Wuji looked at Jian Wushuang curiously.

“I have other things to do so it is not convenient to take you with me. Take this stuff and go back to the Tianzong Dynasty. You don’t?need to worry about the Nine Emperors Sect. They just suffered a big loss, so they don’t have the energy to try and kill you,” Jian Wushuang said.

Tang Wuji furrowed his eyebrows and looked at Jian Wushuang seriously, then he nodded his head heavily and left.

Not long after Tang Wuji left.

A Griffin landed in front of Jian Wushuang, with a black-armored sergeant riding on its back.

“Tianzong Dynasty, Jian Wushuang.”

“The five days are up and your hunting time has ended. Now, come with me,” the black-armored sergeant said in a cold voice. The aura of this sergeant was obviously in the Yin Void Realm.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang got on the griffin’s back without any hesitation. Then he rushed toward the center of the Easternmost Plain together with this black-armored sergeant.

Though the Easternmost Plain was a boundless prairie, there were still some mountains and rivers.

At the center of the Easternmost Plain laid a vast rift called Sky Valley!

It was called Sky Valley because it was a place where people could ascend to a new level.

The black-armored sergeant led Jian Wushuang to one of the entrances of Sky Valley.

“That’s the gathering place of for Tianzong Dynasty’s geniuses, please go down,” the black-armored said.

Jian Wushuang nodded and then jumped down.

A few geniuses were already waiting at the entrance of the rift, including Su Rou.

As Lu Xuan showed up at the entrance, all of them looked at him.

“Third brother.” Su Rou immediately went to stand beside Jian Wushuang.

“Fourth Sister, how many armlets did you collect during the hunt? Are you sure you have enough to pass the first stage?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Su Rou shook her head and said, “I’m not sure. I only have a few armlets.”

Jian Wushuang’s complexion changed slightly.

He had enough armlets to meet the requirement. But, unfortunately, he couldn’t give his spare armlets to Su Rou.

“The ones who have arrived shall wait here. After the geniuses of your Tianzong Dynasty have all arrived I will announce the required armlet quantity,” said a purple-robed elder who was coldly standing at the entrance.

Obviously, this elder was not from Tianzong Dynasty but from another dynasty. Otherwise, his attitude towards them would not have been so indifferent.

But Jian Wushuang and his comrades were not angry. They just waited quietly.

Soon after, all those Tianzong Dynasty’s geniuses of this hunt were gathered here.
