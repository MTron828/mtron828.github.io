Chapter 978: Unbeatable

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“It was a Consciousness Attack!”?Jian Wushuang thought in amazement.

He could do that too. If fact, he had just done that to Master Ku during their fight.

However, this Consciousness Attack was different from an ordinary one. Consciousness Attacks and phsical attacks were totally different.

Nevertheless, Master Ku’s trump card combined the two.

The two types of attacks were blended together perfectly.

Jian Wushuang was stunned, frozen in place, as the Consciousness Attack already kicked in when he saw the Blade Light, allowing him no time to react. As such, he could only see the Blade Light fly toward him at an amazing speed.

“Oh, this is bad!”

“Jian Wushuang!”

Emperor Xiao and the gang inside the imperial palace turned pale with fright and shouted.

“Is he going to die?” Experts of the three big countries were overjoyed to see what was happening to Jian Wushuang.

Ape Holy Master, West Paradise Emperor, and South Paradise Emperor were especially happy.

Jian Wushuang was unable to fend off the Blade Light that went straight for him.

“Clang!”

There was the sound of metal banging together again, and this time sparks were flying.

“Huh?” Master Ku shook violently.

“What?” Experts of the three big countries were surprised too.

Master Ku’s saber was very close to Jian Wushuang, and the terrfying Blade Light was in its prime. Nevertheless, Jian Wushuang’s armor still remained unscathed.

As such, Jian Wushuang stood there unharmed.

Experts of the three big countries were rendered speechless and could not help wondering,?“How is this even possible?

“A few days ago, when Jian Wushuang was fighting against Gu Ji Dao Master, Gu Ji failed to pierce through the youth’s plate armor. However, this Master Ku is a lot more powerful than Gu Ji.

“And this is the best move Master Ku gets. The power in it almost reaches the top level of Rank Three, and it can be felt miles away.

“How come it does Jian Wushuang absolutely no harm?

“Is his plate armor that marvellous?”

Jian Wushuang was so pleasantly surprised he was shaking a bit. He was screaming in his heart,?“This is what I’ve expected.”

“Being an Ancient God of the Three-star Imperial Kinsmen gives me an extraordinarily strong body, and with the help of the Blood-killing Plate Armor, only a few top experts of the Rank Three Dao Masters can hurt me.

“Although Master Ku has great strength, and his last attack was so disturbingly quick even the Rank Three Dao Masters couldn’t take it, his power is only close to the top lovel of Rank Three. He couldn’t have hurt me!

“And if he couldn’t even hurt me, how could he ever kill me?”?thought Jian Wushuang.

Master Ku frowned. Obviously he saw this too.

“This kid is just an expert with the Eternal Realm. How come his body is that strong? That armor of his is not to be overlooked. My best shot couldn’t even hurt him,”?Ku shook his head and sighed secretly.

“Master Ku, you’ve shown me your best move, and it’s time I returned the favor.” Jian Wushuang’s voice brought Master Ku to reality.

He looked at Jian Wushuang, his face grim.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes looked cold. The three Quadranglular Stars between his eyebrows were dazzling as his Ancient God Power flowed toward his right index finger.

“Ancient God Second Finger: Star-extinguishing Finger.”

Jian Wushaung howled as he launched the attack.

“Boom!”

A giant sinkhold appeared in the Void and a towering hologram appeared in the center of the hole. It was only a half-body hologram, and it was only about 30 meters tall, but as it pointed a giant finger toward the air, the power it brought freaked everyone out.

This was the Second Finger of the Three Fingers of the Ancient God.

Jian Wushuang had displayed this great skill in the imperial palace 1,200 years ago with the help of the Essence Blood from King Luo Zhen.

Now he could manage to use this skill without absorbing any Essense Blood, since his Ancient God Power had already reached the three-star level.

The Second Figer was much more powerful than the First Finger.

When Master Ku felt the power of the giant finger, he groaned and attacked with his saber.

“Bang!”

A loud voice could be heard, as the terrifying power formed a storm that destroyed the Void and the ground below, and it was still growing rapidly.

“Swoosh!” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

A pale Master Ku came out of the storm like a ghost, and there was blood in the corner of his mouth. It appeared that he had not taken Jian Wushuang’s attack well.

Speaking of Jian Wushuang, he was still in the eye of the storm and he could only be seen after the storm cleared.

“Jian Wushuang, you won. I’ll never speak of revenge again,” Master Ku said, realizing that there was nothing he could do.

It was true; he had no choice but to let Jian Wushuang go.

He was actually more powerful than Jian Wushuang.

He could easily defeat the youth at close combat, and there was no way Jian Wushuang could block his best move.

Neverthelss Jian Wushuang was too d*mn good at defending himself.

There was nothing Master Ku could do to harm him.

Even if Jian Wushuang stood still and never fought back, Master Ku could not hurt him.

Jian Wushuang’s out-of-this-world defense meant that he could never be defeated.

“Thanks for not killing me, Master Ku.” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“Trying to kill you isn’t my only reason here today. The Temple Master has a message for you; he wants to know if you’d be interested in joining the Void Temple,” Master Ku said out of the blue.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang was visibly surprised.

“The Temple Master? The Void Temple?”
