Chapter 430: Explode, Three Blood Gems!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Under the gaze of Jian Wushuang, the Blood Puppet collided against Deng Huo.

With a cold face, Deng Huo angrily slashed out his cyan saber, whose blade light immediately turned into a “Sun” with overwhelming power.

The Blood Puppet had condensed the power in its fist, and forcefully punched out.

It was as if two stars were colliding head on.

An intangible Blast Wave rippled out, making the main hall that was already heavily damaged, suffer even more destruction.

“The Blood Puppet consumed three Blood Gems...”?Jian Wushuang tightly stared forward with sparkling eyes.

When the two collided, that Deng Huo did not take the Blood Puppet seriously, but when the power of the fist of the Blood Puppet really erupted... Boom! The saber in his hand at that moment was hit aside, and a strong power was transmitted along his arm.

“What?” Deng Huo was aghast.

When the great power moved up his arm, he could not help grunting, followed by vomiting out a big mouthful of blood. Then, his body was forced backward in an ugly way.

As a dignified super expert at the Heaven-defying Level, he was hurt heavily by a punch of the Blood Puppet!

If Deng Huo was careless or did not try his best, it may have been understandable. Yet, he had given his full effort just now and had wielded his most powerful saber technique, yet was hurt heavily by a single punch.

Seeing this, a happy expression grew in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“As expected, the Blood Puppet consuming one Blood Gem could directly outclass Xue Luo, the overlord among experts of Stage Three; if it consumes two Blood Gems, the Blood Puppet could compete with the ordinary Heaven-defying expert; With three Blood Gems, of course the battle strength of the Blood Puppet would be more powerful than the Heaven-defying Level!”

The more Blood Gems the Blood Puppet consumed, the stronger it would be in battle.

The power of three Blood Gems was indeed far beyond the ordinary Heaven-defying Level, at least much stronger than Deng Huo.

Having heavily hurt Deng Huo with a punch, the Blood Puppet did not stop, but attacked Deng Huo again.

Its order from Jian Wushuang was to kill Deng Huo, so before finishing the task, the Blood Puppet would not stop.

“Damn it!”

Deng Huo’s countenance changed greatly when he saw the Blood Puppet rushing towards him again. With one collision, he had been frightened by the Blood Puppet.?“Where does this terrifying Blood Puppet come from? Its strength is even above mine. Even those lord experts would be hard pressed to find such a powerful puppet fighter. How could this guy get one?”

Deng Huo was in disbelief.

When the Blood Puppet rushed towards him, he was wiser and did not collide against it again. Instead, He decided to fight against the Blood Puppet with his speed and technique. However, he quickly found that the Blood Puppet was more powerful than him in strength, speed, and defense. It outclassed him in nearly every aspect.

Its only disadvantage was that it had no intelligence, so its attacks were simple, without using skills. Relying only on its overwhelming strength and incredible speed, however, the Blood Puppet had placed Deng Huo in an extremely difficult position.

“This puppet fighter is just an iron block. I slashed him with my full strength, but it was nothing to him. His strength and speed are much superior than mine. Even though my strength could become the twice of the current level, I’m afraid I would not be able to defeat it.”?Deng Huo was shocked.

He had clashed with the Blood Puppet several times. Yet, after the brief fight, he had no means to defeat it.

“My speed is lower than the puppet fighter. With his interference, I have no method to be able to kill the Swordsman and that person deploying the Formation. Instead, once the Swordsman’s Spiritual Power has recovered and he displays his Realm again, in conjunction with the puppet fighter, I’ll have no chance to survive.”?Deng Huo’s pupils slightly shrank.

When he was fighting against the Blood Puppet, he was observing Jian Wushuang not far away.

While Deng Huo was fighting against the Blood Puppet, Jian Wushuang was swallowing elixirs and quietly recovering his Spiritual Power. Now, most of his Spiritual Power had been recovered. Once it was completely recovered, and Jian Wushuang used his Realm to suppress him, it would be over. Anyway, if Jian Wushuang alone exerted his full strength, Deng Huo would be afraid.

If Jian Wushuang, at his peak status, fought together with the puppet fighter against him, he would not be able to survive at all.

“I have to leave.”

He felt helpless.

There was no other way. Jian Wushuang’s ability was far beyond his imagination. The strength Jian Wushuang desperately displayed before had already stunned him. What’s more astonishing, this puppet fighter turned up.

This puppet fighter was too terrifying!

It was absolutely the most terrifying puppet fighter Deng Huo had seen in his whole life.

With this puppet fighter alone, Deng Huo could never kill Jian Wushuang or Lady Red. There was no use for him to stay there. Naturally, he needed to leave.

Bang!

Colliding against the Blood Puppet again, Deng Huo’s face turned paler, after which, Deng Huo created some distance again from the Blood Puppet.

“You’re lucky this time.”

With a cold snort, Deng Huo suddenly turned around and rushed out of the cave mansion.

He wanted to leave, but Jian Wushuang did not agree.

“Want to run?”

Jian Wushang’s eyes were cold. “Is it so easy to leave?”

“Blood Puppet, hunt him!”

Jian Wushuang directly sent out his order. Meanwhile, 70% of his Spiritual Power had recovered!

Due to the Heavenly Creation Skill, Jian Wushuang’s Spiritual Power recovery was faster than the experts of the same rank. In addition, he had consecutively swallowed elixirs. Naturally, the recovery was very fast.

“70% Spiritual Power is too little to use the Bridge of Helplessness and would not last long, but it is enough to use the Road to the Underworld.”?Jian Wushuang smiled coldly. He focused his thoughts. Immediately, an overwhelming killing intent rolled out, and a long blood river flew out again.

The Blood River moved too quickly, and Deng Huo was covered at once. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

A powerful suppressive force was placed upon Deng Huo’s body.

Deng Huo’s face turned solemn. He glanced at Jian Wushuang behind him and shouted in a low voice, “Boy, I have decided to retreat, what are you going to do?”

“What am I going to do? Do I need to tell you?” Jian Wushuang sneered. “You have consumed three of my Blood Gems. If I let you leave, wouldn’t I lose too much?”

Vast killing intent surged in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

He wanted to kill Deng Huo!
