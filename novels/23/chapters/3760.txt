Chapter 3761: The Strangest Part

As the news of Pupil Master’s death spread, it caused quite a stir in the entire Star Field.

However, due to the suppression of heaven and earth and the complete confinement of time and space, the surrounding Principles Masters could only watch from afar. The distance was too far. Forget recording the mirror images, even the specific scenes of the fierce battle…no one knew. Therefore, they could only guess how Pupil Master was killed by Jian Wushuang and the other two.

However, they were sure that after this battle, the understanding of Jian Wushuang among the experts in the Star Field had increased by another level. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

It was normal that the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and Temporal Temple Master were not very strong, so they could not kill Pupil Master. However, Jian Wushuang had previously suppressed the Ruler Tyrant Axe and Pupil Master, in terms of strength, he was one of the strongest among the Advanced Rulers.

It could be imagined that Jian Wushuang was the absolute main force among the three people who had killed Pupil Master.

It was a mystery as to how he had killed Pupil Master.

…

In the void millions of miles away from the battlefield where they had killed Pupil Master, Jian Wushuang and the other two had stopped.

Jian Wushuang landed on the ground.

“Pupil Master has been roaming the three battlefields for many years. He has ignored his status and dignity many times to deal with the Principles Master and seize Supreme Treasures and opportunities. After so many years of accumulation, he must have an extraordinary wealth and a lot of treasures. Heaven Marquis, please check it out,” Temporal Temple Master said.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded and immediately took out the things left by Pupil Master.

The red long stick and the Supreme Treasure Armor on Pupil Master’s body were both Supreme Treasures.

Jian Wushuang did not need the long stick at all. He just took a glance at it and put it into his interspatial ring.

......

The Supreme Treasure Armor was the real purpose of the three of them to kill Pupil Master. Now that Pupil Master was dead, the Supreme Treasure Armor fell into Jian Wushuang’s hands.

After all, his body-protection ability was extremely powerful. If he had another Supreme Treasure Armor, it would be even more amazing.

“It’s not easy to refine the Supreme Treasure. It will take me some time to refine this Supreme Treasure Armor.” Jian Wushuang integrated his consciousness into the Supreme Treasure Armor, he had a general understanding of the requirements to refine the Supreme True Treasure Armor.

These requirements were not difficult for him, but it would take some time.

“There’s no rush. Let’s see what good things are in Pupil Master’s interspatial ring first.”

Jian Wushuang began to search Pupil Master’s interspatial ring with a hint of expectation in his heart.

Pupil Master was indeed a Ruler who had roamed this Star Field for so long and did not care about his reputation. There were hundreds of Supreme True Treasures in his interspatial ring.

“My God, there are hundreds of universe True Treasures. Pupil Master is really rich,” Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master could not help exclaiming.

“Although these hundreds of True Treasures are universe True Treasures, they are not too high-end. There are only three top-tier True Treasures and only a dozen top-tier True Treasures. The rest are only elementary and high-level True Treasures. He doesn’t need most of them himself, and he doesn’t have any sect forces or disciples. Why would he need so many True Treasures?” Jian Wushuang had a strange look on his face.

When one’s power reached the level of a Ruler, especially a Ruler who was extremely powerful, it would be easier to deal with him if he was a leader of a sect and had many disciples under his command, what was the use of having so many True Treasures?

Besides, most of the time, Pupil Master would lower his status to deal with some Principles Masters to get them.

He didn’t need some True Treasures at all, so why would he do that?

“Maybe Pupil Master wants to collect more True Treasures and exchange them for higher-level ones in the Nine Emperor Pavilion?” Temporal Temple Master said.

“That’s possible.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“Heavenly Marquis, what else do you see in Pupil Master’s interspatial ring besides these True Treasures?” Temporal Temple Master asked.

“There are a lot of things. There are all kinds of treasures, elixirs, and some secret skills. There seem to be several in this interspatial ring,” Jian Wushuang said as he took out the treasures and secret skills that could attract his attention, he took them out one by one.

Although some of the treasures were rare and precious, they did not attract the attention of Jian Wushuang and the other two.

On the contrary, one or two of the secret skills were not bad. For example, the secret skills that Pupil Master had used previously, which could increase one’s strength in an instant, were in this interspatial ring, they were recorded on a token.

“These secret skills are not bad. It’s a good choice to leave them for Star Palace or the Divine Beginning Realm.” Jian Wushuang smiled, then he suddenly frowned and said, “It’s strange. I killed the three Rulers of the Devil Cloud Star, so they should have more secret skills. However, they don’t have any secret skills that I like in their interspatial rings.”

“Haha, it’s easy to understand. Although the three Rulers of the Devil Cloud Star have a greater background than the Pupil Master, most of the secret skills they cultivate are already available in the Devil Cloud Star. As expected, the way they get the secret skills is through self-comprehension. They leave them directly in people’s minds. The secret skills stored in the token of the Pupil Master must have been obtained in the dangerous places in the three battlefields.”

“Many of the dangerous places in the three battlefields have great origins. However, they have lost their inheritances, so there are no restrictions on these secret skills,” Temporal Temple Master said with a smile.

“I see.” Jian Wushuang understood, then he continued, “There is another strange thing. Pupil Master’s interspatial ring contains all kinds of strange treasures, elixirs, and secret skills, but why is there no special crystal stone among them?”

“Special crystal stone?” Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and Temporal Temple Master were surprised.

“There’s not a single special crystal stone in the interspatial ring?” Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master asked in puzzlement.

“No.” Jian Wushuang shook his head. “Normally, even an ordinary Principles Master would have some special crystal stones in his interspatial ring, but the quality is different. Pupil Master, on the other hand, has roamed the Red Cloud World for 5,000 years, not to mention how long he has roamed the three battlefields.”

“In the past 5,000 years, he has killed quite a number of Principles Masters. He has even obtained their interspatial rings. Don’t tell me that there isn’t even a special crystal in their interspatial rings?”
