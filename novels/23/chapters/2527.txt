Chapter 2528: Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Oh?” The Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor was a little surprised.

He knew about the Luo Brothers’ abilities with their almost peerless joint attack techniques among High-Level Ultimate Gods. However, their opponent did not even budget.

The Governor looked at Jian Wushuang and mysteriously smiled. “Golden-robed kid, I hear you’re a swordsman. What coincidence, so am I!”

The Governor flipped his wrist as soon as he spoke and a long black sword which was glowing in a faint light appeared in his hand.

The black sword projected a gloomy cold aura with a touch of evil.

“Let’s find out who’s more skillful.” Jian Wushuang appeared calm with an undercurrent of excitement.

He would have done so long ago if he wanted to leave, but he was not in a hurry as he wanted to cross hands with the Eighteen Prefectures’ top cultivators.

His wait for a Peak Ultimate God was finally over.

“I wonder how large is the gap between a Peak Ultimate God and me at my current level?” Jian Wushuang murmured. In the next moment...

Broom~~~

An infinite golden divine power ocean began gushing out before covering Heaven and Earth.

The void was shrouded in the blink of an eye as a huge Golden Prison was formed out of thin air.

At the same time, an expanding golden divine power had formed an enormous domain that directly pressed against the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor.

The Governor was still standing at the same spot when he felt the domain’s pressure. He was slightly surprised but immediately calmed down.

“Is this the Golden Prison which you unleashed to annihilate those three prefectures? Rather powerful, huh?” The Governor looked around him. “Such a sturdy prison is perhaps difficult to break, even for a high-level Ultimate God. No wonder none of the three prefectures’ experts could escape. Moreover, it has a domain within...”

“What a pity that this domain within the prison is only a joke for me. I’ll show you what real oppression is.”

As soon as his voice faded, the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor’s eyes turned cold.

With ringing noises, a terrifying sword essence suddenly surged upward from the Governor’s body. It was such a strong sword essence.

It was strong enough to make both regular and High-Level Ultimate Gods stunned.

Even Jian Wushuang felt a sense of fear the moment he noticed the sword essence.

The sweeping sword essence immediately and completely materialized before continuing its motion toward every direction. The golden divine power ocean began to retreat under the sword essences.

In the blink of an eye, the sword essence had completely covered Heaven and Earth, forming an immense and complete Sword World!

The powerful sword essence filled every corner of that world.

The Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor was at the centermost region of that world. He was the ruler of sword principles in that world.

Jian Wushuang experienced an unprecedented great shock physically and mentally when that enormous Sword World was formed.

The shock directly affected his sword technique even had greatly decreased the gathering speed of his sword essences.

He felt like a child who just started learning sword techniques and fighting against the world’s best swordsman!

“Sword World, this is a real Sword World!” Jian Wushuang slightly shuddered.

The first stage of sword principles, Sword World!

As soon as one stepped into this stage, one had entered a new level in sword principles.

However, it was incredibly hard to reach that stage.

Jian Wushuang did cross hands with Fan Jianxian while in Wusha Wilderness who had also unleashed a Sword World, but it was only a frame of a Sword World—an empty shell with no substance—and did not help to develop his Sword World at all.

Even then, Fan Jianxian’s ’empty shell’ still indeed caused a slight bit of shock to Jian Wushuang during the battle.

Jian Wushuang was greatly shocked when he felt those heaven-shattering sword essences sweeping in from all directions. He immediately understood that the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor before him was a true sword expert who had opened up his Sword World. The Sword World which he displayed was a complete one and felt entirely different from Fan Jianxian’s.

“It’s a complete Sword World? What a strange and unique feeling.” Jian Wushuang was paying detailed attention to the sword essence around him.

He could personally feel the Sword World that surrounded him.

His understanding of sword principles had reached the completion stage with his next objective was to form his Sword World. However, even though he had received Purple Blood Saint’s understanding on top of knowing a Sword World’s structure, it was not enough to develop one on his own. It would be best if he could personally feel the Sword World.

Jian Wushuang had always wished to cross paths with a sword expert who had developed his Sword World and today’s encounter was an unexpected and pleasant surprise.

“My luck’s rather good.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining with excitement as battle intent began surging within him.

The Governor took action at that same moment.

He had casually arrived right in front of Jian Wushuang as a gloomy and evil cold black sword stabbed outward horizontally.

It produced violent wind noises as though the void was pierced through and exploded.

The stroke itself did not seem to unleash an overly powerful momentum, but Jian Wushuang could tell it was done by focusing and suddenly erupting infinite sword essences at a single point.

The instant explosion sent out terrifying energy waves.

“Hmph!”

Jian Wushuang humphed coldly and dared not be careless. Divine powers were surging violently from his body as the 3,000-meter-tall golden god shadow behind him was also projecting infinite powers.

Ring!

A sword-light appeared out of the blue.

The sword-light was incredibly attractive and bright as though it could connect Heaven and Earth.

It became the focal center of Heaven and Earth the moment it appeared.

It even became an eternity.

Space-time Sword Technique—Heaven and Earth Aligned!

However, Jian Wushuang’s pupils dilated the moment his sword-light appeared.

“How’s that possible? The energy of my stroke had weakened so much?” Jian Wushuang was extremely shocked. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

He had been under the Sword World’s oppression from the beginning.

His gathering of sword essences and the divine powers had been greatly affected by it. He had already given his all into that stroke, but the energy it projected was only at most half of what he could have performed in his peak.

How could an attack at half of his power be able to fend off Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor’s explosion attack?

Twang!

The noises of metal collisions resonated along with the Governor’s immediate explosive strike which Jian Wushuang felt was ten times stronger than a regular Ultimate God’s!

He could not withstand it at all.

Boom!

His body got blown out extremely far away and hit the wall of the Golden Prison.
