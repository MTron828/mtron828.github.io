Chapter 1275: One More Move!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Boom!”

While Jian Wushuang and Zhuge Qiu were fiercely battling, the Blaze Quicksand Realm continued to oppress the entire place.

The Blaze Quicksand Gourd was a valuable Realm Treasure, and with the breakthrough of his power, Jian Wushuang could make more use of the gourd in a fight. Even as powerful as Zhuge Qiu was, the Blaze Quicksand Realm still suppressed his power by a full 30 percent.

Without that realm, Jian Wushuang would not have been able to fight against Zhuge Qiu for so long.

“Boom!”

After another loud sound, the two were finally separated.

“Haha, I feel good!

“Zhuge Qiu, let’s start another round!”

As Jian Wushuang’s battle intent grew stronger, a sliver of light flashed through his eyes. He charged at Zhuge Qiu again after laughing loudly.

Jian Wushuang was born to be a fighter!

The same was true of the Ancient God Clan!

Back when Jian Wushuang was in the Green Fire World, he had reached the peak of that world, and after that, he chose to adventure in the Eternal Chaotic World.

He did not want to make his life easy.

What he had been carrying did not allow him to take a rest.

After he arrived in the Dayu Region and learned of its vastness, he had never gotten the chance to go all out to fight until this day.

Never!

Even Elder Li, the Universe God of the Red Water Alliance, had also failed to force him to go all out.

As for Universe God Lei Ming, that master was powerful, but he had defeated him easily all the same.

But now, Zhuge Qiu appeared…

A Universe God at the peak of the First Heaven; he was a more worthy opponent for Jian Wushuang.

Only such an expert could make Jian Wushaung excited and arouse his battle intent.

Jian Wushuang’s aura grew even stronger as the fight went on; however, for Zhuge Qiu, it was the contrary.

He frowned hard when seeing that Jian Wushuang’s aura was still powerful.

“Madman!”

Zhuge Qiu stared at Jian Wushuang while thinking,?“This boy is just a Universe Master and should be no match for me. At this point, I have consumed half of my power, but his power has even grown stronger.

“He is totally a madman!

“I am actually fighting against such a madman?”

Zhuge Qiu wanted to retreat.

As for Jian Wushuang’s Realm Treasure, he gave up his intention for it.

He even gave up getting revenge on Jian Wushuang for that dead Core Disciple of the Holy Prefecture. He decided to have other experts do that sometime later.

“Kid, you are lucky today!”

Zhuge Qiu snorted and turned around directly, wanting to leave Leopard-print Island.

The experts on the island were stunned by this scene.

“Is Zhuge Qiu trying to retreat?”

“Hmph, he can neither defeat Jian Wushuang nor take him away. What is he waiting for if he doesn’t leave now?”

“A Universe God at the peak of the First Heaven can’t defeat a Universe Master?”

Cries of surprise resounded on Leopard-print Island.

Zhuge Qiu heard those voices as well, and he looked terrible. However, he could do nothing about it but leave there at that moment. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Nonetheless, Jian Wushuang would not let him go.

“Zhuge Qiu!”

Zhuge Qiu heard a shout behind him.

He ignored the voice and kept heading away from the island, but a sandstorm suddenly appeared in front of him and blocked his path. The storm was not strong and he could break it up at will, but if he did so, his pace would be slowed.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ve decided to go. What do you still want from me?” As Zhuge Qiu’s icy voice echoed, he threw out a palm to break up the sandstorm.

“There’s nothing in this world that says one can come and go from a place as he pleases.” Jian Wushuang sneered and continued, “Moreover, you have forced me to go all out. You can’t just go like this until a winner is decided between us.”

“Until a winner is decided between us?” Zhuge Qiu’s eyes narrowed. “What, you want to kill me on this island today?”

“Yup.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Arrogant!” Zhuge Qiu was enraged.

He knew he could not defeat Jian Wushuang, so he just decided to go. But now, it seemed that Jian Wushuang did not want to let the matter drop.

He even wanted to kill him?

The experts on the island were shocked to hear Jian Wushuang’s words.

“You will know soon whether or not I’m being arrogant.” Jian Wushuang showed him a cold smile. “Zhuge Qiu, I know you have great fame. It’s said that to defeat you, one must be a Universe God at the Peak of the First Heaven, but I don’t believe it.”

“What do you mean?” Zhuge Qiu stopped his departure and frowned at Jian Wushuang.

“I have displayed most of my skills when fighting against you, but there is one move that I’ve yet to perform—a move that I’ve just created on the island. I’m confident of its power.” Jian Wushuang smiled. “If you can withstand that move, you can leave; but if you can’t, you’ll be killed.”

“One more move?” Zhuge Qiu’s expression slightly changed.

He thought that Jian Wushuang would have displayed all his moves in the fight just now, as he had done.

However, it seemed that wasn’t the case.

Jian Wushuang still had one more move to display.

“Fine, let me see how powerful your move can be.” Zhuge Qiu’s voice was full of confidence.

And he should have been confident.

He was nearly at the Peak of the First Heaven, so he was confident that he could withstand a single move, even from the powerful Universe God Chen.

As for Jian Wushuang, he was not as powerful as Universe God Chen. And even if he was, Zhuge Qiu believed that he would not be killed by merely a single move from him.

“Zhuge Qiu, watch carefully.”

Without saying another word, Jian Wushuang made his move under everyone’s gaze.

“Weng!”

A chant from the sword was heard before a sword light flashed through the air.

Everyone present could hear the chant clearly.

The moment the chant echoed, a terrifying Soul Attack was aimed at Zhuge Qiu.
