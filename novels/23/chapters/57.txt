Chapter 58: Contemptible Scoundrel

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In Tianhuan Sect, everyone was surprised to see the silver-masked man in a black robe falling down. He was as proud as a peacock just now and said that no one could stand in his way. But he was killed by someone else in only a second.

And it was a person who accepted a One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard mission.

“Swordsman, he… unexpectedly killed a Gold Core Realm expert?”

“He killed all eight people in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm and even the expert in the Gold Core Realm. He couldn’t even run away.”

“Is he the same Swordsman who could not take three moves from Dongfang Yu?”

“He can kill Innate Gold Core Realm experts, but he could not take three attacks from Dongfang Yu?”

Everyone was shocked by what they had just witnessed.

As for Dongfang Yu, his expression was extremely funny.

“How was that possible?” Dongfang Yu murmured. His eyes were empty. He simply could not believe it.

He killed eight people in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm. He even killed the Gold Core Realm expert in one move. That man didn’t even get a chance to run away. What level was his strength at?

And it was the same man that could not take three moves from him during recruitment that did it. He couldn’t believe it.

He recalled what he said to Jian Wushuang at the beginning of the mission: “You are just a waste. There are so many people in the Tianhuan Sect that can kill you.”

His words had been full of disdain! Thinking back to those words, Dongfang Yu’s complexion became very pale.

He suddenly realized that Jian Wushuang must have lost on purpose.

After killing the silver-masked man in a black robe on the roof, Jian Wushuang looked over and noticed Dongfang Yu inside the courtyard.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang moved swiftly towards Dongfang Yu, appearing in front of him in a second.

Whoosh!

An icy sword edge hit Dongfang Yu’s throat.

“Hand over your Interspatial Ring, or you will die!” Jian Wushuang said coldly without any emotion.

Dongfang Yu moved his throat, clearly sensing the icy sword edge, remembering the recent death of the man of Gold Core Realm. He had no doubt that Jian Wushuang could do it. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The four people behind Dongfang Yu had disdained Jian Wushuang earlier, but now they did not even dare to breathe.

Should I refuse? Dongfang Yu roared in mind. His small and fragile self-esteem fought with his reason, but in the end, his reason prevailed.

While trembling, Dongfang Yu handed over an Interspatial Ring to Jian Wushuang without too much hesitation.

Jian Wushuang took the Interspatial Ring and smiled. He looked Dongfang Yu up and down as if he was a contemptible scoundrel. Finally, Jian Wushuang withdrew and sheathed the Triple-kill Sword, walking away without a single word.

Dongfang Yu and the four people sighed with relief after Jian Wushuang went away. At that moment, they were totally soaked in sweat, especially Dongfang Yu. He was still trembling even now. Suddenly Dongfang Yu turned to the four people behind him.

“An Interspatial Ring was taken away by Swordsman. That means only two people can finish the task now.” Dongfang Yu looked gloomy.

Then the complexions of the four people behind Dongfang Yu turned serious.

Yin Min and Ling Tianhao were waiting in the courtyard. It didn’t take long for Jian Wushuang to arrive.

Ling Tianhao moved towards Jian Wushuang and smiled, “haha, Swordsman, Innate Gold Core Realm, a real Gold Core Realm expert was killed by you. You are so awesome!”

“You were indeed awesome, Swordsman!” Yin Min gave Jian Wushuang the thumbs-up, ” Well, the reason why your strength improved so much was because you had made a breakthrough, right?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

The reason that he was able to kill the eight in the Exceptional Spiritual Sea Realm with only one stroke and even kill the silver-masked man in a black robe, who was at the peak of the Initial Gold Core Realm, was because he made a breakthrough and reached the Ultimate Spirit Sea. As a result, his Spiritual Power improved to a level similar to an average warrior in the Gold Core Realm.

If he had not made a breakthrough, he could not have killed the silver-masked man in black robe so easily.

“We should leave here.” Jian Wushuang said.

“What about the Ring?” Ling Tianhao asked.

“Don’t worry. I took an Interspatial Ring just now.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Oh?” Yin Min and Ling Tianhao both felt surprised.

“I saw Dongfang Yu and snatched an Interspatial Ring from him just now,” said Jian Wushuang, smiling weirdly.

After hearing that, both Yin Min and Ling Tianhao showed great interest.

“Haha, Swordsman, did you confront Dongfang Yu?” Ling Tianhao looked excited.

“I don’t think Dongfang Yu has enough courage to fight with you. He must have handed over the Interspatial Ring immediately. Haha, I wonder how terrible the expression on his face was,” Yin Min said and laughed.

“Certainly, it must have been very ugly,” Ling Tianhao said and also laughed.

Both Yin Min and Ling Tianhao had some kind of beef with Dongfang Yu, so they disliked him. But they both could not contend with him. So it was reasonable for them to be so excited when they heard that Dongfang Yu suffered a defeat on Swordsman’s hand.

Jian Wushuang only shook his head and smiled.

In his eyes, Dongfang Yu was just a contemptible scoundrel and could not make a difference at all.

Outside this gigantic valley, the grey-robed elder Mr. Huo waited quietly. Some warriors in the One-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard mission had recently returned. Mr. Huo didn’t pay any attention to them though. However, when Jian Wushuang, Lin Min and Lin Tianhao came back safe and sound, everyone immediately looked in their direction.

“Swordsman!”

“Although he only reached Spiritual Sea Realm, he killed an expert in Primordial Gold Core!”

“It was too awesome!”

The people who witnessed the death of the nine black-robed men had complicated expressions while they looked at Jian Wushuang more carefully this time.

Even the grey-robed elder, Mr. Huo, gave Jian Wushuang a friendly smile.

Mr. Huo said gently, “Well done, kiddo!”

“Thanks,” Jian Wushuang said modestly.

“Please wait for a while,” said Mr. Huo with a smile.
