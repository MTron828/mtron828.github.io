Chapter 2982: Was He Really a Divine Master?

——

Outside the Dragon Flame World, in the Dark Temple.

“He has retreated. His Highness Qian Chen has chosen to retreat!”

“He has no choice. Heavenly Sword Marquis is no weaker than him. His Highness Qian Chen has already used his most powerful move, but he hasn’t been able to hurt the Heavenly Sword Marquis at all. With such an expert, how could His Highness Qian Chen have the chance to kill the experts of that team and get the corpse of the Dragon Flame Beast?”

“You’re right.”

The six black-clothed men were talking leisurely. They all knew that Prince Qian Chen had tried his best. It was not because he was not strong, but because Jian Wushuang was too strong.

“The appearance of Heavenly Sword Marquis was completely unexpected. It’s normal that Prince Qian Chen could not complete the 100% task quota. After that, we have to report this matter to the higher-ups of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and let them handle this matter in person,” the man in the triangular helmet said to himself.

“In addition, Heavenly Sword Marquis…”

…

In the Dragon Flame World, the ninth team that His Highness Qian Chen found ended in failure. However, he was not discouraged and continued to look for the tenth team.

Obviously, there was no expert like Jian Wushuang in the other teams, so there was no room for him to fight against His Highness Qian Chen. His team was directly defeated, so the Dragon Flame Beast’s corpse naturally fell into his hands.

In a flash, a month had passed.

In a remote plain in the Dragon Flame World.

“Someone from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance has sent me a message. The one-month deadline has passed. Our mission has been completed, so we can leave now,” the Barbarian King said with a pleasantly surprised smile on his face.

Everyone in the Barbarian King Team was also pleasantly surprised.

After all, the reward for the second phase of the mission was 200 million sacred elixirs!

Now that the mission was completed, the 200 million sacred elixirs would belong to their team. This was an astronomical figure for them, so they were naturally overjoyed.

“Of course, the reason why our Barbarian King Team was able to complete the second phase of the mission is mainly because of the existence of the Heavenly Marquis Brothers,” the Barbarian King added.

“Yes, it’s all thanks to the Heavenly Marquis Brothers.”

The others also looked at Jian Wushuang with awe in their eyes.

They knew very well that if it were not for Jian Wushuang, they would not have been able to complete the second stage of the mission. Even when Prince Qian Chen came to kill them, many people in their team would have died, including the strongest one, their captain, the Barbarian King, would probably die on the spot.

“Everyone, I propose that half of the 200 million sacred elixirs be given to the Heavenly Marquis Brother, how about it?” The Barbarian King said.

“No problem.”

“I agree.”

“The second stage of the mission can only be completed by the Heavenly Marquis Brother. It’s only right that he gets half of the reward.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Everyone in the Barbarian King Team nodded in agreement.

“Heavenly Marquis Brothers, what do you think?” The Barbarian King looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Since everyone is so polite, I’ll accept the 100 million sacred elixirs.”

Seeing this, the Barbarian King and the others also smiled.

“Let’s go and hand in the mission.”

The eight members of the Barbarian King Team directly headed out of the Dragon Flame World with smiles on their faces.

…

In the void outside the Dragon Flame World, in the dark shrine.

Whoosh!

A black-robed figure appeared out of thin air in the shrine.

“Welcome, Your Highness Qian Chen!”

The triangular-armored man and the six black-robed men under him had already bowed and waited.

That black-robed figure was naturally His Highness Qian Chen, who had just returned from the Dragon Flame World.

“All of you, stand up.” His Highness Qian Chen waved his hand, and everyone immediately stood up.

“You all saw the process of this mission, right?” Princess Qian Chen looked at the triangular-shaped man in the helmet.

“We saw it.” The triangular-shaped man immediately said, “This mission, because of our negligence, there were some unforeseen circumstances, which caused Princess Qian Chen to not be able to complete 100% of the mission quota. However, we have already reported the truth of what happened here. I believe that the Lords of the three palaces will reasonably determine your mission quota based on the actual situation here.”

“Yes.” His Highness Qian Chen nodded slightly. “I’m not worried about the mission quota. The less, the less. What I want to say is that Heavenly Sword Marquis is indeed quite strong, and his methods of concealing his aura are truly brilliant. I’ve fought with him for so long, but I haven’t been able to see his specific realm at all. Do you know what his realm is exactly? Is he a first or second rank True Saint, or is he a Peak False Saint like me?”

His Highness Qian Chen was indeed curious.

He had always thought that Jian Wushuang must have been concealing his aura, and he also had his own speculation about Jian Wushuang’s true realm.

In his opinion, Jian Wushuang should be a True Saint. Perhaps he was only a first rank True Saint, but it was unlikely that he was a second rank True Saint, because he could see that Jian Wushuang’s divine power was far inferior to a second rank True Saint.

However, it was also possible that Jian Wushuang was just a first-level False Saint like him. If that was the case, then Jian Wushuang’s talent was no less than his. However, in his opinion, there were very few geniuses like him who could enter the Heaven and Earth Palace of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, there were very few geniuses like him in the entire divine beginning world. It was very unlikely that a genius like him could appear anywhere in the endless territories.

Therefore, he did not think that Jian Wushuang was a Peak False Saint.

Hearing what Prince Qian Chen said, the man in the triangular helmet and the six men in black behind him looked at each other with strange expressions.

“What? Say something. Is Heavenly Sword Marquis really a Peak False Saint?” Prince Qian Chen frowned slightly. He saw the changes in the expressions of the men in the triangular helmet.

“Um, your Highness Qian Chen.” The man in the triangular helmet hesitated for a moment before he finally spoke, “According to the information we received from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, Heavenly Sword Marquis should be just a Divine Master!”

“What did you say?” Qian Chen immediately looked at the man in the triangular helmet. His eyes were filled with a strange light.

“Divine Master? You said that Heavenly Sword Marquis is only a Divine Master? Hehe, an expert who can fight me to a standstill and leave me helpless is only a Divine Master? Are you playing with me?” His Highness Qian Chen’s voice was cold, a trace of anger appeared in his eyes.

“I don’t dare, I don’t dare.”

The man in the triangular helmet shook his head repeatedly. “Your Highness, according to the information we received from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, this Heavenly Sword Marquis is indeed just a supreme being. He once participated in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s assessment as a supreme being. During that assessment, he once killed a Peak False Saint with his supreme-being level. At that time, his combat strength had already reached the True Saint-level!”
