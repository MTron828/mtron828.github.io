Chapter 3549: Red Nether Master

Jian Wushuang slowly moved forward on the black earth of the Nine Twists Demon Cave.

Because there were too many dangerous places in the Nine Twists Demon Cave, he did not dare to move too fast.

“It’s said that the monsters in the Nine Twists Demon Cave live on the black earth. Most of the time, they live underground and only come out occasionally to get some fresh air. However, I haven’t seen any monsters in the past few days, so I don’t know what they look like,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

But all of a sudden...

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang’s face suddenly darkened. He had already sensed the killing intent coming from his side, and a strange figure had appeared there.

“It actually appeared silently by my side, but my soul power did not sense it? What a good trick.” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently and immediately activated his life magic power.

The red-haired sloppy old man suddenly appeared beside Jian Wushuang. He had completely set his eyes on Jian Wushuang, even though he did not think that Jian Wushuang had the battle strength of the sixth realm of the void, however, he did not want to give Jian Wushuang a chance to kill him.

Instead, he unleashed his strongest power as soon as he attacked. A dazzling blood-red saber light with a suffocating cold aura slashed toward Jian Wushuang.

The timing of his attack was just right. In the red-haired sloppy elder’s opinion, even if his attack could not kill Jian Wushuang, it could at least severely injure him, he had a high chance of killing Jian Wushuang.

However, he did not expect that Jian Wushuang would react the moment he attacked and immediately attack.

This move was still performed with the Blood Mountain Sword. Because the time was too short, Jian Wushuang did not have the time to perform any amazing swordsmanship. It was purely a move that relied on his own brute force and his strongest power.

Clang!

The Blood Mountain Sword and the saber light collided head-on. An extremely powerful force immediately surged from the saber light and forced Jian Wushuang to retreat at once.

Jian Wushuang retreated rapidly, and it took him a long time to stabilize himself.

“Impressive. This saber alone should have the battle strength close to the advanced level of the sixth realm. There are indeed many experts in the Nine Twists Demon Cave.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, and at the same time, he saw the appearance of the person.

“This appearance...you are the Red Nether Master, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, I am.” The Red Nether Master stared at Jian Wushuang with a cold gaze. “Blood Sword Master, I didn’t expect you to be able to take my attack without being noticed. It doesn’t seem like you used up much divine power.”

“Haha, it’s my honor for you to recognize me, Red Nether Master. However, I don’t have any enmity with you. It’s not right for you to launch a sneak attack without saying anything. After all, you’re an expert of the sixth realm of the void,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Humph, I don’t care whether you have enmity or not. As long as I don’t like you, or if you have something I want, I can kill you at will,” Red Nether Master said coldly, “It’s said that you have a time-space type universe true treasure on you.”

“Blood Sword Master, hand over that time-space type true treasure and I’ll let you go. Otherwise, you’ll have to stay alive.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows, then he smiled and said, “Red Nether Master, you’re right. Cultivators who wander around the three battlefields don’t need any reason to kill each other. They can kill each other if they want to, but I’m afraid you’re not qualified to do so.”

“You’ll know whether I’m qualified or not.” Red Nether Master did not waste any time. Since Jian Wushuang did not take the initiative to hand over the time-space type true treasure, he immediately took action.

Whoosh!

A terrifying speed burst forth. Red Nether Master was clearly still some distance away from Jian Wushuang, but in the blink of an eye, he had already arrived in front of Jian Wushuang, and the dark-red saber in his hand…he struck out fiercely once again.

This strike had the ability to split mountains and break mountains, as if it wanted to cut everything in front of him into two.

Seeing this scene, Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with excitement.

“If you want to fight, then let’s fight.”

Jian Wushuang’s aura suddenly soared, and an extremely violent aura suddenly rose.

He held the Blood Mountain Sword with one hand and instantly slashed.

A scarlet sword light easily cut through the void, and with a roar like that of an ancient fierce beast, it suddenly slashed out.

It was the peerless sword technique, Xi Xiang!

It was the same Xi Xiang move, but after 50 years of practice, it had reached the level of an advanced level six absolute art.

Coupled with Jian Wushuang’s terrifying power, it instantly collided with the saber light of the Red Nether Master.

Clang!

With another loud sound, Jian Wushuang staggered and took a few steps back.

But the Red Nether Master also took a few steps back.

“Is this...an advanced level six secret skill?” The Red Nether Master looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“Haha.” Jian Wushuang just smiled faintly and then attacked again.

“Humph.” The Red Nether Master snorted, and his eyes turned cold as he went up to meet Jian Wushuang.

The two immediately engaged in a fierce battle in the Nine Twists Demon Cave.

Although the Red Nether Master was a genuine expert of the six void realms, his cultivation was only at the initial stage of the six void realms. He was still far from reaching the advanced stage of the six void realms. As for Jian Wushuang, he activated his life divine power, by relying on his advantage in basic divine power to activate the first stage of the Blood Crystal Armor, the power he unleashed was definitely stronger than that of an expert at the peak of the five void realms. He was only slightly weaker than an expert of the six void realms. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

However, Jian Wushuang could make up for this difference with his own swordsmanship.

After all, he had created a complete set of swordsmanship. These swordsmanship had reached the advanced level of level six. During the fierce battle with the Red Nether Master, each of his swordsmanship was an advanced level six absolute art, this was something that the Red Nether Master could not do.

With the advantage of the absolute art, Jian Wushuang could fight the Red Nether Master head-on.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

A low sound of collision could be heard. The two of them had fought in the void for nearly a hundred times.

Although the Red Nether Master had some advantage in these nearly a hundred collisions, he did not have much of an advantage.

“Red Nether Master, is that all you’ve got?”

Jian Wushuang suddenly stopped what he was doing and looked at the Red Nether Master.

The Red Nether Master had an ugly look on his face. He had not taken Jian Wushuang seriously before and thought that his strength was enough to crush Jian Wushuang and kill him. But now, in a real fight…he could not even completely suppress his opponent, let alone kill him.
