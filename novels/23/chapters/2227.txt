Chapter 2228 Jian Er

“I’m an Ancient Era expert, after all, I was a Chaotic Divine Demon. Even though the restrictions on this earth greatly weakened my Soul Power, but not to the extent that a Chaotic Realm could control me?” Xie Yu could not believe what was happening.He did not know that 20,000 years ago, Jian Wushuang had used the Soul Swallowing Pearl to perform the Three Divine Lights, a Soul Attack skill against Demon King Chen Yu.

In the 20,000 years of his sleep, his Soul Power had greatly improved.

His Soul Attack was naturally stronger than the rest’s.

Jian Wushuang now with his Soul Swallowing Pearl and Nether Light Scripture from the Three Divine Lights to help him with Soul Control, who could stop him?

In addition, it had already been some time since Jian Wushuang had left the Real Martial Arts Divine Church area, why did he look for Xie Yu now?

Because Jian Wushuang wanted Xie Yu to suffer just a bit more in the Blood Mountain Sword, rendering him weak and defenceless.

“No! No!”

“I will not let you control me even if it means death!” Xie Yu screamed, even about to ignite his soul.

But soon he realised the Soul Power that had infiltrated his consciousness sea had already corroded his Soul Power, controlling his consciousness.

It would be wishful thinking to attempt to ignite his soul.

“Crap!” Xie Yu’s face was dark as ash, but soon he started to calm down.

“Xie Yu’s two brothers were too strong for me to control, so I had to kill them. Xie Yu’s different,” Jian Wushuang smiled, his Soul Power was already dominating Xie Yu’s consciousness sea, wiping away his consciousness.

Within moments, the Soul Control was complete.

As Jian Wushuang waved his hands, Xie Yu appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Xie Yu at that moment was very calm.

“Master,” Xie Yu respectfully stood beside Jian Wushuang, his gaze full of fanaticism. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

This sort of fanaticism was only found when one was completely under another’s soul control.

“From today, your name shall be Jian Er,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes,” Xie Yu, now Jian Er, nodded respectfully.

“Sit down, there are some things I would like to ask you,” Jian Wushuang said.

Jian Er immediately sat down in front of him.

“Talk to me about you and your brothers in the Ancient Era,” Jian Wushuang said.

Jian Er, being completely controlled by Jian Wushuang, showed no defiance and began talking about it.

“Master, my two brothers and I were from the Ancient Era’s Divine Dream Heaven Sect, one of eight big holy sects. Although we were nothing against the Three Big Holy Land and Four Big Holy Tribes, we were good.”

“Divine Dream Heaven Sect?” Jian Wushuang nodded quietly.

He knew about Ancient Era factions.

The Three Big Holy Lands, Four Big Holy Tribes, and Eight Big Holy Sects were all elite factions and the Seven Star Black Sect!

“There were many experts within the Divine Dream Heaven Sect – us five brothers were all Chaotic Divine Demon, but we were still nothing within the Sect. Luckily, my eldest brother was the highest amongst Chaotic Divine Demons, so we were able to obtain some resources.”

“After the war broke out, the five brothers went into battle against the Seven Star Black Sect, but during then Number Three and Four fell, leaving the three of us, but in a stasis.”

“The slumber lasted a very long time... we woke up once but, realising the restrictions on this earth, went back to sleep.”

“The three of you woke up once?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Indeed, but we soon realised the era was completely different to the one we had lived in – the spiritual influence of heaven and earth was weak, and there are all sorts of restrictions. Under those circumstances, we won’t be able to restore our powers, in fact we would have lost our powers.”

“Take me, for example, I was at Chaotic Divine Demon in the Ancient Era, but when I woke up and stayed around, my maximum potential fell. Even if I reached pinnacle fighting power, it would be pinnacle Chaotic Realm,” Jian Er said.

“What?” Jian Wushuang flinched.

It was better to not wake up? Waking up would gradually shred them of their powers?

The land that they were in had that kind of power as well?

“Because of that, we had to continue to sleep to ensure our maximum potential would not drop, in hopes of eventually restoring pinnacle fighting power,” Jian Er said.

“If that’s the case, why have you all woken up once again?”

“Why within the Eternal Chaotic World?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Because the chance we had been waiting for is finally here,” Jian Er said.

“What chance?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“3,900 years later, Heaven’s Horizon!” Jian Er replied.

“What do you mean?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

“We received news. 3,900 years later, someone at the Heaven’s Horizon will establish a link between this land and our homeland, back to the Divine Dream Heaven Sect!” Jian Er said solemnly.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was full of questions.

“Back to your homeland?”

“Back to the Divine Dream Heaven Sect?” Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank. “There are other lands beside this?”

“No, not another land! This is the same land as my homeland, but someone locked it and isolated it completely!” Jian Er said.
