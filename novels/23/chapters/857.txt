Chapter 858: Ninth-heaven Sword Formation

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The middle-aged man trembled when he heard the white-bearded elder’s words.

He was very aware of the strength of his uncle. But his uncle said that the Sunrise Sword Emperor only used one sword stroke to kill a Dao Master who was even stronger than him?

How strong was the Sunrise Sword Emperor?

“The Ninth-heaven Sword Formation was indeed created by the Sunrise Sword Emperor with another expert. Its value is immeasurable. I still have some Divine Gems, but I’m not sure if it’s enough,” the white-bearded elder clenched both fists, his eyes sparkling with excitement.

At the auction, the black-robed elder looked around, not surprised at the astonishment of the Warriors.

He spoke again, “The other creator of Ninth-heaven Sword Formation was Dao Master Spirit, also known as the number one Formation Master in the Eternal World.”

“They created the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation together.”

“With Sunrise Sword Emperor’s supreme swordsmanship and Dao Master Spirit’s profound research on Formation, this sword formation is the strongest sword formation in the Eternal World!”

Once he finished his words, the auction began seething once again.

The number one Sword Cultivator in the Eternal World.

And the number one Formation Master in the Eternal World.

They created the strongest sword formation together?

Craziness!

The experts, including those who were not proficient at Sword Principle, displayed an unprecedented craziness over this sword formation.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes also lit up.

He was full of expectations towards the number one sword formation in the Eternal World.

“The Ninth-heaven Sword Formation actually consists of four sword formations, but only the first three are being auctioned today, which are the three paintings in front of you,” the black-robed elder said. His words made lots of experts in the auction feel somewhat disheartened.

Only three sword formations were up for auction. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Apparently, this was not the complete Ninth-heaven Sword Formation.

Nevertheless, even the first three sword formations were already incredibly powerful.

“The reserve price is one billion Divine Gems. Let’s start now,” the black-robed elder announced.

Those experts who were crazy about the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation immediately responded.

“One billion Divine Gems!”

“1.3 billion!”

“1.5 billion!”

The auction price was rising at an alarming speed.

Suddenly a cold voice came from a VIP room in the middle of the second floor, “Five billion Divine Gems!”

Five billion?

Did this man directly raise the auction price to five billion Divine Gems?

“Who is he?”

The experts, including those in the VIP rooms on the second floor, could not help looking toward that room where the voice came from.

“Five billion Divine Gems?” The white-bearded elder looked towards that room and frowned.

“Uncle, it seems that this man is determined to get the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation,” The middle-aged man said.

“Determined? Humph, isn’t everyone determined?” The white-bearded elder snorted and bid again, “5.5 billion Divine Gems.”

“10 billion!” The indifferent voice sounded again.

The entire auction house quieted down.

10 billion Divine Gems was a sum beyond most people’s imagination.

Those who had gone crazy over the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation took a deep breath and shook their heads, deciding to give up on bidding.

Lots of experts were attracted to this auction, including a dozen Dao Masters. However, few of them could afford 10 billion Divine Gems.

“Who? Who is that man?”

The white-bearded elder was enraged after hearing the new bid.

His clan was able to afford 10 billion Divine Gems, but he did not bring so many Divine Gems this time. Therefore, he could not continue to bid against this man.

“Go, find out that man’s identity. I want to know who this upstart is,” the white-bearded elder said with a hint of coldness in his voice.

“Yes.” The middle-aged man went to check immediately.

The lively auction finally quieted down when the cold voice announced the bid of 10 billion Divine Gems.

No one else offered to bid a higher price.

In the end, the man with the cold voice got the first three sword formations of the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation.

“Haha, everyone, since the last treasure has been auctioned off, let’s call it a day. You may leave now,” the black-robed elder’s loud voice reverberated in the auction house, after which the experts began to disperse.

While dispersing, they were still talking about the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation.

The unbelievable bid, 10 billion Divine Gems, astonished them again and again.

In the VIP room where the white-bearded elder stayed, the middle-aged man had returned.

He walked to the elder and said with a hint of horror, “Uncle, I’ve found out that man’s identity.”

“Hum, who is he?” the elder immediately looked at him.

“I’m not completely certain who he is, but I know that he comes from the Void Temple. According to the information from our clan, he is probably Master Blood Saber, one of the 18 masters in the Void Temple!” the middle-aged man replied.

“What? It’s him?” The white-bearded elder was shocked and a hint of fear flashed through his eyes.

Void Temple was a giant overload which the Tang of the East dared not offend.

A real overlord in the Eternal World.

The 18 masters, who were peak Dao Masters, had very high positions in the Void Temple. Therefore, the white-bearded elder dared not offend any of them.

The white-bearded elder had heard of Master Blood Saber, who had become a master not long ago but was extremely strong.

Master Blood Saber could definitely be ranked in the top five among the 18 Masters of the Void Temple.

“It’s said that Master Blood Saber is proficient at using the saber and that his Saber Technique is extremely cruel and fast. Why did he buy the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation? Isn’t it useless for him? Is he giving it to someone else?”

“Isn’t it said that Master Blood Saber is always alone and has few friends?”

The white-bearded elder pondered.

However, since the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation belonged to Master Blood Saber now, he dared not dwell on it anymore.

“Oh well, it’s a pity.”

He sighed slightly before leaving with the middle-aged man.
