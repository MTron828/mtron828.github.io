2293 Sword from the Heavens, Jian Wushuang!

The wail was like the rising sun. As he wailed, the snow that had been falling for nine years, nine months, and nine days, suddenly stopped.

Incineration Moon City’s snow melted instantly, and the bitter cold that once could be felt at every corner of the city was no more.

“The snow really stopped?” The people in the inner courtyard were shocked.

As the door opened, an old woman walked out with a baby wrapped in her arms.

“Congratulations Governor, it is a healthy boy,” the old lady said with a smile.

“Bring him over,” Zhuo Yunfeng said.

The old lady brought it over for Zhuo Yunfeng to check.

“It really is a boy?” Zhuo Yunfeng and Zhuo Peng gulped.

Everything the Taoist Priest Xuan Shen had said was correct.

From the time, to the snow, and even down to the gender of the baby.

“Elder, you are god-like indeed, I atone for my insolence,” Zhuo Yunfeng immediately apologised to Taoist Priest Xuan Shen.

“Elder Xuan Shen, please forgive us,” Zhuo Peng apologised as well.

They only knew about the Taoist Elder’s reputation but had never seen him perform.

But now they knew that he was a god-sent prophet.

He was beyond man.

Zhuo Yunfeng could be sure that Taoist Elder Xuan Shen was an all-knowing almighty.

At least his Rules of Fate were at astonishing levels.

“It’s nothing much, no need to worry.” Taoist Priest Xuan Shen smiled without any malice.

Zhuo Yunfeng took a deep breath, looked at the baby, and asked the Taoist Priest Xuan Shen, “Taoist Elder, please bestow a name for our little guy.”

“A name?” Taoist Priest Xuan Shen raised his eyebrow. “I’m here not just to bestow a name, I need to change his surname as well.”

“Surname?” Zhuo Yunfeng and Zhuo Peng were shocked. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

He was born in the Zhuo household, Zhuo Yunfeng’s son. But Taoist Priest Xuan Shen wanted to change his surname?

“Governor Zhuo, your son is special. His surname has been pre-destined,” Taoist Priest Xuan Shen said.

Zhuo Yunfeng frowned, but still said, “Please do so.”

“No rush, wait,” Taoist Priest Xuan Shen said as he looked up towards the dark Void.

Zhuo Yunfeng and Zhuo Peng looked up, confused, but he did not see anything.

“It’s coming,” Taoist Priest Xuan Shen said.

Right after he said that, the black Void rumbled as the darkness retreated to make way for a streak of light. The streak of light gradually lit up the place and was increasingly glaring as it approached the earth.

Xiu!

Like an asteroid, the streak of light struck the inner courtyard.

A huge hole was blown up.

Everyone in the inner courtyard, including Zhuo Yunfeng and Zhuo Peng, were dumbfounded.

As the dust settled, they saw a sword in the ground!

The sword was four chi (about 1.3m) tall with no scabbard. The blade itself was crimson red as if it was drenched in blood.

“This is...” Zhuo Yunfeng and the others stared at the sword.

The longsword looked ordinary, but Zhuo Yunfeng saw an incomprehensible hell within it. Countless bones and endless streams of blood flowed within that hell.

It was a sword of death.

“What a terrifying sword,” Zhuo Yunfeng murmured but he was even more appalled.

Because the sword had come from the heavens.

From the heavens?

“Governor Zhuo, your kid was born by the sword and should take up the Surname Jian (meaning “sword”). For his name, because he was in your wife’s womb for nine years, nine months and nine days, unparalleled in this earth. Name him Wushuang.”

“Wushuang will be his name!” Taoist Priest Xuan Shen exclaimed.

“Jian as a surname, Wushuang as his name... Jian Wushuang?” Zhuo Yunfeng flinched, but quickly responded, “Unparalleled on this earth, with a sword in hand, a good name!”

“Thank you for bestowing the name,” Zhuo Yunfeng thanked.

Taoist Priest Xuan Shen laughed, “I am here for his name only. Now that that’s settled, I shall be on my way.”

Taoist Priest Xuan Shen did not turn away immediately but instead looked at the baby. The baby’s eyes were already wide open, staring at Taoist Priest Xuan Shen.

“Little boy, we will meet again.”

Taoist Priest Xuan Shen made his way out of the mansion.

“Thank you Elder,” Zhuo Yunfeng and Zhuo Peng bowed as he left.

“Haha~~” Taoist Priest Xuan Shen laughed casually as he disappeared from the view of others in a matter of moments.

“Taoist Priest Xuan Shen really is something else,” Zhuo Yunfeng exclaimed.

“Father, are we really going to name him Jian Wushuang?” Zhuo Peng asked.

“Of course, this is the name Taoist Elder gave. You yourself saw the sword descend from above. The name is but a tag, we can call him Jian Wushuang, we can also call him Zhuo Wushuang, it’s the same,” Zhuo Yunfeng laughed.

“Of course,” Zhuo Peng nodded.

They both were extremely excited about the newborn baby.

“Oh yes, let us show your mother,” Zhuo Yunfeng said as they headed into the room.

What the duo did not notice was that the baby’s black eyes had a glimpse of shock within them. His gaze never shifted from the direction Taoist Priest Xuan Shen had left in.

“Who was that Taoist Priest?” Jian Wushuang shouted in his heart, but he could not form any words. All that came from him were the wails of a baby.

Jian Wushuang had yet to understand what had happened.

He only remembered obtaining his wife Leng Rushuang’s soul at Heaven’s Horizon and being chased down by two Masters of Holy Land. He was dying.

But the moment he woke up, everything had changed.
