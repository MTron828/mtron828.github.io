Chapter 2575: High-Level Earth Ultimate God

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

San Shanwang did not bother hiding any more since Jian Wushuang had exposed his true strength.

A majestic wave of divine power that was several times stronger than Primary Stage Earth Ultimate God’s aura which he showed previously started emanating from him!

“He’s a High-Level Earth Ultimate God!”

“It’s a High-Level Earth Ultimate God!”

Everyone in the Combat Ring shuddered at the sight.

“I smell major trouble brewing.”

Situ Yuan and many Situ Clan Elders who stood watching in the void trembled at the sight of divine power breath discharged by San Shouwang.

Jian Wushuang who stood in front of San Shouwang was unfazed.

“I’ve just used nearly seventy percent of my strength. It should at least be enough to heavily wound—if not kill you. However, you don’t seem to be affected at all. The Heavenly Treasure battle armor is pretty good indeed.” San Shouwang shot a sharp gaze at Jian Wushuang. “It’s a pity that such a precious treasure fell into your hands. Give it to me so that I can make full use of it!”

After which, San Shouwang extended his large hand and grabbed Jian Wushuang.

He was finally displaying his full strength.

A High-Level Earth Ultimate God was several times more powerful than a Primary Stage Earth Ultimate God. Even if a casually fired shot was much stronger than any techniques he had previously used.

Jian Wushuang’s expression remained unchanged.

The Stellar Strength in his body was bubbling forth as his divine power breath soared.

Hum!

Jian Wushuang casually brandished his sword and destroyed everything with his brutal sword shadow.

“This sword...” San Shouwang was startled as he sharply withdrew his hand.

Boom!

A sword-light hit below the Combat Ring’s grounds which caused a huge sword mark that spanned perfectly across the Combat Ring to instantly appeared.

It appeared as though the sword-light had divided the Combat Ring into two halves.

“You?!” San Shouwang looked at Jian Wushuang in horror.

At the same time, he felt the surging divine power breath in Jian Wushuang.

Although the divine power breath was far from his, it was much stronger than what Jian Wushuang had displayed earlier. Previously, Jian Wushuang showed the divine power breath of a Peak Ultimate God. His power then had risen to that of an ordinary Primary Stage Earth Ultimate God!

Did Jian Wushuang’s cultivation level just advance?

“What’s going on?” San Shouwang frowned.

The surrounding experts watching the battle at the Combat Ring were perplexed.

Jian Wushuang smiled coldly. “San Shouwang, you are too full of yourself. I’ve noticed how you’ve been hiding your strength when you fought with Pei Qi. You even pretended to be injured. I know your realm level is higher than what you’ve shown but since I dare to challenge you today, I will surely have prepared well. In other words, I have figured out a way to deal with you since I’ve always known you were a High-Level Earth Ultimate God.”

While Jian Wushuang spoke, a majestic divine power had begun to gather behind him.

In the blink of an eye, an infinitely huge Golden God Shadow appeared out of thin air.

He also displayed both the Seven Stars Secret Technique and Divine God of Punishment.

Jian Wushuang had also gradually improved the performance of both secret techniques along with his realm’s improvement.

He had only practiced the first scroll of Seven Stars Secret Technique earlier which helped elevated his power by half a realm.

He had since completed the second scroll of Seven Stars Secret Technique.

The second scroll was capable of even elevating an Undying Saint’s cultivation realm!

That explained why Jian Wushuang’s divine power breath had advanced from a Peak Ultimate God to a Primary-Level Earth Ultimate God.

Although Jian Wushuang did not make many breakthroughs with the Divine God of Punishment technique, it had also grown from 1,000 feet to 1,800 feet!

Improving its powers by manifolds.

Jian Wushuang was more powerful than ever after displaying the two great secret techniques!

Rumbling...

The monstrous divine aura coming off from Jian Wushuang was more powerful than San Shouwang.

“This brat...”

San Shouwang became gloomy, but his gaze was still razor-sharp.

“So what if you’re well prepared? It’s a pity you’re too late as I’m no longer the same as what you saw during the battle with Pei Qi two years ago. You’ll still die in the end no matter how powerful you are!”

San Shouwang sounded cold as the destructive divine aura in his body instantly soared to an extremely high level.

A large amount of destructive power gathered in his body and formed a huge Divine Destructive Beast in the blink of an eye.

The huge Divine Destructive Beast was a thousand feet tall. It was covered with deep purple scales with a faint purple thunder circling its scales.

After the beast appeared, a terrifying destructive aura emanated from it.

Even the world seemed to retreat in the face of such danger. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Divine Destructive Beast, Thunder Punishment!”

San Shouwang let out a stern roar under the disguise of the Divine Destructive Beast.

The thousand-foot-high Divine Destructive Beast charged forward, bringing along billions of thunder clouds with it that were packed with the power to destroy a world.

Everyone in the Combat Ring gasped when they saw the Divine Destructive Beast charge forward.

It was outrageously strong!

While the beast was taking action, the Principle World which San Shouwang displayed expanded its presence to the surrounding void. It quickly grew in power and forcefully crushed Jian Wushuang and forced his Sword World to retreat.

“It’s true that his Principle World is very strong. I believe it’s at least thirty thousand miles but it still looks like a joke before me.” Jian Wushuang sneered and no longer suppress his Sword World’s powers.

Boom!

With a full range of 100,000 miles, the most perfect Sword World between Heaven and Earth was displayed!

That was the first time Jian Wushuang had fully displayed his Sword World since open up the perfect Sword World.

He was merely displaying a part of its full potential when previously faced with the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor in the Dark Thunder Territory.

And then...

San Shouwang’s Principle World instantly collapsed.

There was no room for struggles as the Principle World was instantly trounced!

“What just happened?” San Shouwang was taken aback.

He wanted to use his Principle World against Jian Wushuang, just like how he had caught Pei Qi off guard and beheaded him.

He never expected to be the one being caught off guard instead.

His Principle World was ruthlessly crushed as Jian Wushuang’s Sword World continued to expand and began to overwhelm him with its stunning effects.
