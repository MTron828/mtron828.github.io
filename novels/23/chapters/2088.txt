Chapter 2089 A Pitched Battle

“Hmm?” Ba Su’s gaze shifted.

The many experts turned towards the source of the sound.

Below the pithole, a towering figure slowly rose. It was Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang rose without a scratch, his Divine Power could be subtly seen surrounding him. He was no different than before.

“He’s not hurt?” Ba Su was astonished.

You must know, the Golden Claws move, took Ba Su all his strength. Even if the opponent was King Chen Xing, he would have been badly hurt. But Jian Wushuang came out unscathed. In terms of the strength of their divine bodies, Jian Wushuang obviously emerged stronger.

Jian Wushuang rose once again to the Void, eyes fixed on Ba Su. “King Chen Xing was right, this Ba Su is impressive. Putting his Soul Attack aside, those Golden Claws are enough to place him on the pinnacle Second Stage Great Emperor level. If all this happened before I entered the Ancient Emperor’s Residence, I probably wouldn’t have stood a chance …”

“But now …”

Jian Wushuang let out a cheeky smile, and at that moment, Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew!

Six streaks of golden light were instantly released.

This six streaks were like six golden meteors, cutting across the sky.

It was too fast.

Ba Su, in one focused breath, blocked it with one palm.

Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!

The six streaks of golden light all bounced away, but the brutality of Jian Wushuang’s impact forced Ba Su to pace back a few steps.

The Hong Jun Golden Sword was used with Spacetime Powers.

As his understanding of Spacetime increased immensely, he was able to use the sixth Golden Sword, both its speed and attack increasing along.

The Hong Jun Golden Sword, at its full force, was enough to go against a Second Stage Great Emperor.

This were six of such Golden Swords attacking simultaneously. Even pinnacle Second Stage Great Emperor-level Ba Su dared not underestimate it.

Importantly, the Hong Jun Golden Swords were known for their speed!

Immediately after the Swords were bounced back, they stopped and started charging towards Ba Su once again.

Frenzy attacks again and again and again… the six Hong Jun Golden Swords kept on going.

Ba Su originally did not take the Swords to heart, but as he reflected the swords, and the swords kept coming back… his face darkened.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang took a sudden step.

As he started pacing himself, his body grew to nine or ten feet tall, nine heads and eighteen arms appeared as well. An earth-shattering aura of might was approaching.

The publicly recognised forte of the Ancient God Clan was its close combat abilities. Jian Wushuang obviously wanted to use this to engage in a full-on slaughter.

Hong!

Jian Wushuang held tight to his eighteen long swords, and started cutting in a frenzy.

This was together with the six frenzied Hong Jun Golden Swords.

With that and the close combat abilities, it was the perfect combination. Savage, ruthless!

Jian Wushuang’s fighting power was fully demonstrated at that moment.

“Crap!”

Ba Su was no longer composed like he’d been before. He was astonished.

Previously, he had not bothered about this newborn Ancient God Emperor Jian Wushuang, but now… Jian Wushuang’s fully released fighting power brought tremendous stress to Ba Su, especially the combination of the Swords and his close combat abilities. That swordsmanship was brutal and forceful, he could not find any openings.

His Divine Power was bursting with life, his Bloodline Power at its optimum, yet he was still suppressed by Jian Wushuang.

Completely suppressed.

He let the brutal, ruthless Jian Wushuang suppress him, he could not find any way out.

“The close combat abilities of the Ancient God Clan are too terrifying, along with his Swords…if this goes on, I’ll lose. My masterstroke then!” A fierce glare could be seen as Ba Su snarled.

As the leader of the Sky Swallowing Clan, a pinnacle Second Stage Great Emperor, of course he had more tricks up his sleeve.

On the battlefield, while Ba Su was still being suppressed by Jian Wushuang, Ba Su made a quick retreat, and flew out like a golden bat once again.

“Li!!”

It was the same ear-piercing pitch that resonated across the battlefield.

Within that cry, a strong Soul Attack was making its way towards Jian Wushuang?

“This move again?”

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened. But this time he was well prepared, using his substantive soul to build many barriers of defence.

At the same time, his Five Gem Armour started to let out a strange light.

The Five Gem Armour was placed in Jian Wushuang’s hands by the Ancient Era expert Wu Hun. Its might was formidable, despite being damaged.

Not just targeting substantive defence, it also provided a certain amount of protection against Soul Attacks.

The frenzied Soul Attack was approaching.

“Hngh.”

Jian Wushuang snorted. He felt a sharp pain in his soul, but this time he did not fall into that state of inattentiveness.

His consciousness was absolutely awake.

Immediately, he saw Ba Su’s attack approaching.

“Golden Lightning Elemental Barrier!”

Hong!

A bucket-thick golden streak of light blasted towards Jian Wushuang.

This golden streak of light was filled with Golden Lightning. One streak of it looked enough to wreak devastating havoc. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

And that golden streak of light was a flawless combination of millions and millions of flashes of Golden Lightning.

As he watched the golden streak of light approach him, Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold with death.

“Dissipate!”

One thunderous roar shook the Void.

An astonishing Sword Essence rose from Jian Wushuang, with four hands holding the same spear. This pure Divine Power, along with Nine-star Ancient Clan-leveled Bloodline Power, were all fully deployed.

Hong!

An astonishing sword light striked.

It went face-to-face with that golden streak of light.

Chi! Chi! Chi!

There was no dramatic roar or bang. It was as if the blade of a sword ran itself across a towering mountain.

That thick golden streak of light that went on for tens of feet… a clean slice from the sword light.

The power dissipated in all directions.

“What?”

Ba Su’s face changed instantly. “Golden Lightning Elemental Barrier, my strongest technique, was taken down in one strike?
