Chapter 640: The Top 20 Geniuses

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“This boy is so powerful!”

“He has an excellent understanding of the Slaughter Dao and World Dao. If he combines them perfectly... I’ll be no match for him!”

“He is too powerful. Only Qianqiu Wuhen and Gong Chao can fight against him.”

Everyone fixed their attention on Jian Wushuang.

No one dared to hold him in contempt now, even though they knew he came from the Ancient World.

He had gained their respect through his strength.

After he returned to the Drill Ground, Feng gazed at Jian Wushuang with an odd expression, saying, “Jian Wushuang, you’ve hidden your strength well.”

“The same as you.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly as he threw Feng a meaningful glance.

He had recognized that Feng had also hidden his strength in the first round of the genius battle.

Although he was considered powerful enough to enter the top 20, Feng had not exposed his true strength.

“I’m looking forward to having a head-on fight with you in the arena duels,” Feng said.

“Me too. But we can’t decide the grouping of the arena duels,” Jian Wushuang responded.

“Then let’s fight after the Firmament Territory Feast is over,” Feng suggested.

“OK.” Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile.

The arena duels went on. Soon after, Feng took the field.

Feng’s opponent was also a superior genius who was qualified to get into the top 20. He seemed to be as strong as Feng.

Everyone thought it would have to be a fierce fight, but in the end, Feng defeated his opponent with ease.

“Saber Technique.”

Jian Wushuang, who had kept an eye on this fight, nodded inwardly.

The Saber Technique that Feng displayed was terrifying. Although he had only used the Superior Rank One Secret Skill, his Saber Technique was more exquisite than his opponent’s, so he had gained the upper hand from the beginning.

Obviously, the spectators had underestimated Feng’s strength.

Huo Ying, from the Ancient World, was out of luck. He encountered an opponent who was able to rank inside the top 10, so naturally, Huo Ying lost the fight.

After two rounds of duels, aside from Jian Wushuang and Feng, the other four geniuses from the Ancient World were knocked out.

The results came in. The 31 geniuses made it through to the next round.

However, they could not match up in pairs, so the middle-aged host ordered them to assemble at the center of the Drill Ground.

“Listen up. Next, I’ll use a special method to choose the 20 geniuses who can continue the arena duels,” the middle-aged man said in a resonant voice.

“A special method?”?The 31 geniuses were all curious.

“Are you ready?”

The middle-aged man’s face fell as a terrifying aura suddenly radiated out from his body and surged toward the 31 geniuses.

Although those geniuses had been prepared for it, the mighty aura still forced two of them to kneel down.

The other geniuses, whose faces had turned red, were trying their best to withstand it.

“Aura oppression?”

Jian Wushuang calmly stood with his arms folded.

Feng standing beside him wore a solemn expression. Obviously, this stream of aura oppression did not work on him.

The experts in the Skyward Pavilion watched this with interest.

They already knew that there would be a test of aura oppression and that it emphasized one’s temperament.

The more persistent a genius was, the more easily he could withstand the aura oppression.

“As I expected, it’s easy for those two boys.” Xuan Yi smiled faintly.

The aura suppression became stronger and stronger. Some geniuses reached their limits. Even Qianqiu Wuhen and Gong Chao looked pale.

But Jian Wushuang and Feng remained composed, as if the aura suppression had not landed on them.

Both of them had experienced life-and-death trials and struggled on in the Ancient World, so they were able to simply stand there. They already had hearts of stone.

The geniuses from the Eternal World had superior cultivating conditions. But even though they were talented, most of them had not suffered a lot, so their willpower was weak.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

Geniuses fell down one by one. Aside from Jian Wushuang and Feng, the other geniuses were still struggling to keep their balance. When the 11th genius fell down, the aura oppression eventually dissipated. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

They all felt relieved.

“The top 20 geniuses are qualified to compete for the top 10. The rest of you are out,” the middle-aged man shouted in a frosty tone.

Upon hearing this, the 11 geniuses who had been forced to fall were not willing to leave, but they had no choice.

The top 20 geniuses went to draw lots to determine their opponents.

The groupings for the third round of the arena duels were quickly settled.

“Zhong Huo versus Qiu Yue!”

“Li Xiaoyue versus Huan Chong!”

“Feng Tianyi versus Wing King!”

“Feng versus Qianqiu Wuhen!

“Jian Wushuang versus Gong Chao!”
