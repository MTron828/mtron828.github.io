Chapter 731: The Militant Warrior, Jiu You!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“A Militant Warrior?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Being a Militant Warrior himself, he had never seen any other Militant Warriors during his dozens of years of adventure in the Boundless Wilds.

Wild Beasts were the only things that he had encountered.

That was because the land was so vast and the Militant Warriors on it were so few.

“And has broken through to the fifth level of the Heaven Level Test?”?Jian Wushuang wore a faint smile.

When he left the Eighth Tribe, he had also broken through to that level.

“Let’s go,” he said to Gu Lan and then headed to the Underground Palace with him.

Soon after, they arrived there and found many familiar faces among the crowd that was gathered, such as Gu Changfeng, Gu Yang, and Elder Ying.

“Jian Wushuang?”

An uproar broke out among the crowd when they saw Jian Wushuang appear.

Gu Changfeng hurriedly walked up to him and said, “Jian Wushuang, you’re back from your adventure!”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded and greeted those old friends.

“Jian Wushuang, look carefully at that man,” Gu Yang said to him with a smile while pointing at a man who was taking the Heaven Level Test on the battlefield. “He is named Jiu You, a Militant Warrior like you, and has just come back from the Boundless Wilds not long ago.”

Jian Wushuang immediately looked toward where Gu Yang pointed.

There, he saw an elegant man dressed in a loose golden robe with his chest exposed in the air. The man held a long red spear in his hand, and from the looks of it, it was an Eternal Weapon.

Though the power of Eternal Weapons could not be released fully in the Heaven Level Test, this man still forced the 100 Puppet Fighters surrounding him into a corner with his spear.

“He is indeed excellent in utilizing power.”

While looking at the man, Jian Wushuang’s became fired up.

At that point, he could tell that the man was a real expert who was good at fighting.

“This man is challenging the sixth level of the Heaven Level Test, facing 100 Puppet Fighters, who can launch extremely powerful attacks and overpower all the clansmen here, but still, he is utterly routing them.

“Every time he strikes out, in a seemingly casual way, he can catch the flaw of his opponents’ joint attack and break them. Those Puppet Fighters are now forced to keep busy defending themselves.

“This is a man of great power!”?Jian Wushuang clenched his hands while secretly praising him.

He continued watching for a while before the man ended the fight by defeating all the Puppet Fighters.

The man passed the sixth level of the Heaven Level Test!

“Bravo!”

“It’s so scary that he did it. Passing the sixth level of the Heaven Level Test!”

“His fighting skill is really impressive.”

“Is this what a Militant Warrior can do?”

The palace was inundated with the onlookers’ discussions.

Gu Changfeng held his fists tightly and secretly thought with excitement,?“He is too damn powerful!”?

Among the crowd, only Jian Wushuang still maintained a calm demeanor.

Right then, he heard Elder Ying’s voice say, “Jian Wushuang, follow me. I want to introduce you to Jiu You.”

“Ok.”

He nodded and followed her. Then, he was led to where Jiu You had just walked down to after finishing his test.

“Jiu You, please allow me to introduce this man to you. He is called Jian Wushuang, a Militant Warrior just like you,” Elder Ying said to Jiu You.

“Really?” The man looked at Jian Wushuang with surprise in his eyes. “You’re a Militant Warrior too?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded to him.

“I can see it now.” The man looked Jian Wushuang up and down before continuing. “I can feel the aura of a real expert coming from you. Something you can get only through suffering.

“But, it’s a pity that you have not awoken your bloodline and are not a One-star Ancient God yet.”

The man sighed and there was disappointment in his eyes.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang retorted confidently, “It’s true that I haven’t awoken my bloodline, but it doesn’t mean that you can overpower me.”

“Is that so?” Jiu You shot him an amazed glance.

At this, Elder Ying, Gu Yang, and the others all looked at Jian Wushuang with strange expressions.

They had witnessed how powerful Jiu You was just now and, based on his fighting skill and that he had awoken his bloodline, which had a high density, they believed that he had to be more powerful than they had seen.

Thus, they were really surprised upon hearing Jian Wushuang say that Jiu You could not overpower him.

“Interesting.” Jiu You wore a big smile and said, “I had adventured in the Boundless Wilds for many years, and during that time, I met two extremely powerful opponents, who were Militant Warriors too. And now, here you are, the third Militant Warrior.

“I don’t know why you’re so confident, but since we’re here as two Militant Warriors, why don’t we have a fight?”

“You’re right. It’s hard to meet a?Militant Warrior, and it would be a great pity if we don’t fight today.” Jian Wushuang accepted his invitation.

“Great! In order to make it fair, I won’t transform into an Ancient God during the fight,” Jiu You answered happily.

Jian Wushuang smiled while replying, “You might not want to transform, but I’ll force you to.”

“Well!” Jiu You knit his brows hard, and there was a battle intent rising in his eyes.

Jian Wushuang had the same expression. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Militant Warriors were called so because they loved to fight.

They got bored with the leisure and dull life in the clan, so they went to the Boundless Wilds for adventure.

Given that there were not many Militant Warriors even in the whole Ancient God Clan, they could rarely battle each other. That was why immediately after Jian Wushuang and Jiu You met, their battle intent became aroused.

The onlookers were not surprised that these two were going to fight each other; on the contrary, they were looking forward to seeing that.

“A fight between two Militant Warriors!”

“Who do you think is more powerful between them?”

“I think Jiu You is. After all, he has awoken his bloodline, and we all have learned about his power from the test. He has passed the sixth level of the Heaven Level Test, while Jian Wushuang had only passed the fifth level before he left.”

“I’d agree with you under the condition of Jiu You transforming into an Ancient God during the fight. But, you just heard him say that he won’t. In that case, I think Jian Wushuang stands a chance to win. He passed the fifth level 70 years ago, so he’s not weak, and he might be able to pass the sixth level now.”
