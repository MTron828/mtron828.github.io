Chapter 3642: The Fourth Heaven

After returning to the Divine Beginning Realm, Jian Wushuang did not alarm too many people. Instead, he directly headed toward the seal of the Seven Star Divine Realm under the guidance of the Temporal Temple Master.

As the Temporal Temple Master teleported again and again, it did not take long for Jian Wushuang to arrive at a hidden special space.

This special space was barren and devoid of any life. The only thing that existed was a special formation in the center of this special space.

Jian Wushuang and Temporal Temple Master came to the front of the formation.

“Is this...a space passage?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“It’s a space passage, but it only leads to one place. To open it, you need the power of a Ruler. In the Divine Beginning Realm, although I’m suppressed by the will of the Heavenly Dao, I’m still a Ruler, so I can barely open this space passage,” Temporal Temple Master said.

“Where does this space passage lead to? The Seven Star Divine Realm?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“You’ll know when you get there.” Temporal Temple Master smiled and began to open the space passage.

With the divine power of Temporal Temple Master, the space passage quickly began to operate. Complicated and mysterious secret patterns rose up, and a surge of supreme power spread out from the space passage.

“This space passage seems extraordinary?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“Let’s go in,” Temporal Temple Master said and then entered the space passage with Jian Wushuang.

There was a flash of light, and when they reappeared, Jian Wushuang found himself on a vast land.

The land was boundless, but what surprised Jian Wushuang was that there was no life in the land, and it was full of death.

“Where is this?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

“This is the Fourth Heaven of the Divine Beginning Realm!” Temporal Temple Master said.

“The Fourth Heaven?” Jian Wushuang was stunned and looked at Temporal Temple Master.

“Yes, the core of the Divine Beginning Realm is the Third Heaven. The Third Heaven is stronger than the first, especially the Third Heaven. The cultivation environment is far better than other places and it is the absolute core of the Divine Beginning Realm. The strongest overlords of the Divine Beginning Realm, such as the three Saint Realms, the four divine clans, and the Eight Directions Celestial Sect, are all in the Third Heaven.”

“But a long time ago, before the Seven Star Mysterious Sect was destroyed, there was a total of four heavens at the core of the Divine Beginning Realm. At that time, the Fourth Heaven was the core of the Divine Beginning Realm and the place with the most outstanding cultivation environment. In terms of cultivation conditions, the Fourth Heaven was several times stronger than the Third Heaven!”

“There was only one force in the Fourth Heaven, and that was...Seven Star Mysterious Sect. At that time, Seven Star Mysterious Sect was the only overlord in the Fourth Heaven. At the same time, it also represented its supreme power in the Divine Beginning Realm. Such power is far beyond the three Saint Realms now.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help revealing a shocked expression.

In the past, the Fourth Heaven, which had many times better cultivation conditions than the present Third Heaven, was completely occupied by the Seven Star Mysterious Sect. It was evident how powerful the Seven Star Mysterious Sect was.

After a pause, Temporal Temple Master continued, “However, since the battle broke out, the Seven Star Mysterious Sect was destroyed and the entire Seven Star Divine Realm was sealed. Because of the formation of the seal, not only did it absorb the vitality of countless cultivators, but it also absorbed almost all the vitality of the Fourth Heaven. In addition, the seal has been operating for countless years and still crazily devouring the vitality of the Fourth Heaven. This led to the complete abandonment of the Fourth Heaven.”

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

It used to be the core of the Divine Beginning Realm and the Saint Realm with the best cultivation conditions, but now it had become so lifeless, which made Jian Wushuang sigh in his heart.

“After the Fourth Heaven was completely abandoned, the cultivators could hardly sense the existence of the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth, so they could not cultivate. Therefore, many cultivators in the Fourth Heaven left. After all, no one wanted to stay in a place where they could not even sense the spiritual Qi,” Temporal Temple Master continued to explain.

“Because of this, the Fourth Heaven slowly withdrew from the public’s view until it was forgotten. Until now, most cultivators in the Divine Beginning Realm only know of the Third Heaven, but they never knew that there was actually a Fourth Heaven in the Divine Beginning Realm.”

“However, although the Fourth Heaven is abandoned, that seal will still be there. The Seven Star Divine Realm is still inside that seal, so others will forget about this place. However, we won’t. Moreover, because the spiritual qi here has been completely exhausted, the many spatial passages that originally existed in the Fourth Heaven have already lost their use. No one can use the spatial passage to come here again. So, I, the mysterious God, the Heaven Slayer, and the Heaven Ancestor joined hands to wipe out the connection between the Fourth Heaven and the Divine Beginning Realm.”

“This means that in the entire Divine Beginning Realm, only the space passage we took just now can lead to the Fourth Heaven. It’s almost impossible for others to get to the Fourth Heaven through normal means.”

“Is this the only space passage that can lead to the Fourth Heaven?” Jian Wushuang nodded secretly.

It was obvious that the Temporal Temple Master and the others had protected the only passage to the Fourth Heaven very tightly. The passage could only be activated by the power of a Ruler. Naturally, over the years, no one could come to the Fourth Heaven except for the Temporal Temple Master and the others. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“That’s not right.” Jian Wushuang suddenly frowned. “If no one can come to the Fourth Heaven and come into contact with the sealed Seven Star Divine Realm, how did the three masters of the Saint Realm open the seal and come to the Seven Star Divine Realm?”

In his previous life, the three masters of the Saint Realm had all come to the Seven Star Divine Realm in the last battle.

If the three masters of the Saint Realm could not come to the Fourth Heaven and come into contact with the seal of the Seven Star Divine Realm, they naturally could not come.

“I just said that it’s impossible to come to the Fourth Heaven through normal channels, but the three masters of the Saint Realm are different. After all, the three masters of the Saint Realm are supported by the power of the will of heaven. They are guided by the will of heaven. Even if they don’t use the space passage, they can still find a way to come to the Fourth Heaven and touch the Seven Star Divine Realm,” Temporal Temple Master said.

“I see.” Jian Wushuang understood.

After all, the Fourth Heaven was in the Divine Beginning Realm. As the heavenly will of the Divine Beginning Realm, it was not difficult for the three masters of the Saint Realm to reach the Fourth Heaven.
