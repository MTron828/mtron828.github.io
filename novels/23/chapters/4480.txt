4483 God Refinement Sect Master

Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!

Jian Wushuang followed behind Elder Mi Feng and quickly headed toward the highest peak of the God Refining Sect.

That was where the God Refining Sect’s Sect Master was.

According to Jian Wushuang’s observation over the past ten days, he had figured out some of the strength of the God Refining Sect.

The Sect Master of the God Refining Sect, Ba Huang, was a Six Scar Void Warrior. In terms of the Divine Power Universe realm, he was an Invincible Supreme!

Under the Sect Master Ba Huang, there were another five Grand Elders. Even the weakest of these five Grand Elders had reached the Four Scar level!

Under these five Grand Elders, there were nearly 20 ordinary Scar level Void Warriors.

This was the strength of the God Refining Sect on the surface.

In terms of the Divine Power Universe, it was similar to the Divine Life Palace, but it was much stronger than the Divine Life Palace.

This was because everyone in the God Refining Sect had a divine corpse that was similar to their own strength. In other words, it was equivalent to doubling the number of Void Warriors in the God Refining Sect!

Moreover, Jian Wushuang was certain that there was an even more unimaginable power in the God Refining Sect.

Jian Wushuang thought about it and kept comparing the God Refining Sect with the Divine Power Universe he was in.

Once the two universes went to war, the God Refining Sect would be a tough bone to chew.

Under Elder Mi Feng’s lead, the two of them were extremely fast. It did not take long for them to reach the highest peak of the God Refining Sect.

A palace that looked like it was made of countless white bones appeared before Jian Wushuang and Elder Mi Feng.

Countless yellow will-o’- the-wisps floated in the air, like fireflies, lighting up the sky.

“Wushuang, the Sect Master is inside. Please follow me in,” Elder Mi Feng turned to Jian Wushuang and said with a smile.

“Alright.” Jian Wushuang nodded. From the moment he stepped into the palace, he could vaguely feel a pair of eyes watching him in the dark.

If he was not wrong, this pair of eyes should be the God Refining Sect’s Sect Master.

If he had not converted his divine power into void power, Jian Wushuang might have been worried. However, now that he had figured out the nature of divine power and void power and had successfully converted them, he was confident that even if the God Refining Sect Master had a pair of sharp eyes, he would definitely not be able to see through his identity!

Creak.

The two black iron gates of the Sect Master’s palace opened on their own, and Elder Mi Feng and Jian Wushuang strode in.

The first to enter his sight were the Grand Elders and a group of Elders who were standing on both sides of the hall. Among them, the Elder Shen Lian was also present.

He saw Jian Wushuang walk into the hall and a sinister smile appeared on his face.

At the very top of the hall, a dignified middle-aged man in an extremely long black robe with the corners of his clothes scattered on the ground and a vertical eye between his brows sat on the main seat.

He did not need to guess to know that this person was the Sect Master of the God Refining Sect, Ba Huang!

“Sect Master, I’ve brought Wushuang.” Elder Mi Feng cupped his hands at him, then walked to the middle of the two sides and returned to his seat.

“Disciple Wushuang greets Lord Sect Master!” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and lowered his head.

“Raise your head and look at me.” A deep and majestic voice came from the God Refining Sect Master’s mouth.

“Yes!” Jian Wushuang looked up.

The God Refining Sect Master looked at him with bright eyes. His face was expressionless, and no one could tell what he was thinking.

A mountain-like pressure suddenly spread out from his body and pressed down on Jian Wushuang like a mountain.

Jian Wushuang’s body sank.

“Wushuang, I’ve heard that when you came to participate in the selection of our sect’s disciples, you accompanied three other people, right?” the God Refining Sect Master said indifferently.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head. He knew that the God Refining Sect Master was trying to manipulate him.

Or rather, the God Refining Sect Master did not completely believe in his identity.

Jian Wushuang could not help but turn his eyes slightly. He glanced around and saw that Elder Shen Lian was also looking at him with a faint smile.

The two of them looked at each other.

In an instant, Jian Wushuang understood that Elder Shen Lian must have said something behind his back.

“Do you know the identity of these three people?” the God Refining Sect Master asked again.

The pressure on Jian Wushuang suddenly became heavier.

“I don’t!” Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and replied with certainty.

“Oh? Do you really not know, or are you just pretending?” the Sect Master asked calmly as the corners of his mouth curled up.

“Sect Master, if you have something to say, you might as well say it directly!” Jian Wushuang raised his head and looked at the God Refining Sect Master seriously.

Facing the overbearing gaze of the God Refining Sect Master, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were clear and he did not have any intention to retreat.

When the God Refining Sect Master heard this, his pupils could not help but shrink.

“You little fellow, you are quite bold.” The God Refining Sect Master shook his head and continued, “Wushuang, I’ll be direct. I suspect that you are in cahoots with the three spies who want to enter my God Refining Sect. Can you allow me to use the Soul-Searching Technique?”

As he said that, the divine light in the God Refining Sect Master’s eyes grew by three inches and he stared at Jian Wushuang.

Elder Shen Lian had a mocking expression on his face.

Jian Wushuang’s heart sank when he heard this.

The divine universe also had the Soul-Searching Technique. It could enter the divine body and soul directly through the great Dharma power to see the cause and effect and see the past and the future clearly.

“Why wouldn’t I?” Jian Wushuang thought quickly and replied with a laugh.

He knew that he could not afford to show any signs of fear.

The moment he hesitated, it would only increase the suspicion of the God Refining Sect Master and increase the risk of being exposed.

...

He could only take a gamble!

He gambled that the God Refining Sect Master would definitely not use the Soul-Searching Technique on him!

This technique forcefully pried into the heavenly secrets Great Dao and was extremely harmful to the person who was being searched. It could be said that it destroyed the Dao Foundation and destroyed the target’s future.

And now, he had a rare super-grade talent in the God Refining Sect. The God Refining Sect Master would definitely not reverse the cause and effect and forcefully destroy this good seedling because of a groundless guess.

As expected, before the Sect Master could say anything, Elder Mi Feng stepped out and said anxiously, “Sect Master, you can’t do this!”

“Wushuang is a rare talent in our God Refining Sect. He has also refined the number one divine corpse in our sect. His future is limitless. If we use the Soul-Searching Technique on him, it will be the same as cutting off his path of advancement!”

The Sect Master of the God Refining Sect snorted and said, “Elder Mi Feng, the greater one’s talent is, the greater the danger. You should know better than me the identities of the three people who appeared outside the Mountain Gate selection that day, right? If this Wushuang has ill intentions and comes from the same place as those three, then our universe’s tens of millions of years of plan will be exposed and ruined. Can you bear the responsibility?”

Then, the God Refining Sect Master looked at Jian Wushuang coldly and said, “Wushuang, this matter is of great importance. We can’t allow even a one-in-a-million risk. Don’t blame me for being merciless.”

As soon as he finished his words, a large amount of void energy gathered in the hands of the God Refining Sect Master.

In an instant, Jian Wushuang’s heart sank to the extreme!
