Chapter 675: Sword Heart

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Sword Heart!”

Inside the large palace, all the experts were currently silent.

The weakest among these experts was a superior Divine Realm expert, who appeared to be so insightful and be able to could see through the swordsmanship Jian Wushuang was performing, including the great change that just occurred in his movements.

They were also well aware of the reason for the change.

It was because they knew it that they understood how incredible it was.

“How is that possible?”

“Sword Heart! It’s really Sword Heart!”

Even most of the experts in the Eternal Realm who are good at Sword Principle have not reached the level of condensing a Sword Heart. As for Divine Realm experts, a Divine Realm expert that can condense a Sword Heart is already considered to be terrifyingly successful. But, this boy… He is currently in the Skyscraping Realm.

A Skyscraping Realm expert that can condense a Sword Heart?

Even Palace Master Ming Xin, who always frowned at Jian Wushuang, was greatly surprised at the moment.

In the Firmament Territory or even the whole Eternal World, a Divine Realm expert who had condensed a Sword Heart would count as a super genius. But there were so few of them in the entire Eternal World, and the Firmament Territory had even fewer.

How could a kid in the Skyscraping Realm condense a Sword Heart?

It was unbelievable!

But Jian Wushuang did it.

He really was just in the Skyscraping Realm and he was still young, but his swordsmanship had reached the level where he could condense a Sword Heart.

All the experts there were in shock.

Like Mo Tao, who was good at meditating on the Slaughter Dao and wanted to take Jian Wushuang as his personal disciple. He said hurriedly, “Fortunately, he refused me! With my ability, I was definitely not qualified to be his Master.”

Mo Tao sighed, Even though I have a profound understanding of the Slaughter Dao, my field of vision is rather narrow. I’ve tried my best but only reached the Eternal Realm. So, I suppose I would only have wasted his talent at my level.

“In the entire Ancient Sect, I’m afraid Xuan Yi is the only one who is qualified to instruct him.”

The experts in the palace all looked at Xuan Yi.

“Congratulations, Palace Master Xuan Yi! You’ve accepted a good disciple.”

“Xuan Yi, this little fellow is so talented. With your guidance, he will definitely achieve a lot in the future.”

A kid in the Skyscraping Realm actually condensed his Sword Heart! His understanding of Sword Principle must be far higher than that of his comprehension of the World Dao and Slaughter Dao. It is indeed the best choice for him to be apprenticed to Xuan Yi.

Hearing those compliments, Xuan Yi smiled softly but said nothing. Even he felt a bit shocked deep down.

“The boy has given me two big surprises?in rapid succession!”

They really were two big surprises.

The first surprise was the burst of power that Jian Wushuang released. It was far stronger than anyone at the same level.

The second was when he condensed his Sword Heart.

“Attention, everyone. Although my disciple is still at the Skyscraping Realm, his battle strength is only slightly weaker than normal Divine Realm experts. So he is qualified to cultivate my Secret Skills,” Xuan Yi said plainly.

On hearing that, all the experts glanced questioningly at one another.

In the Ancient Sect, there were many Secret Skills which were restricted because they were closely related to the foundation of the Ancient Sect and its enormous power. According to rules in the Ancient Sect, only disciples who reached the Divine Realm could cultivate these Secret Skills. However, there was no rule that did not have an exception.

Sure, Jian Wushuang was only in the Skyscraping Realm, but his battle strength was about the same as a common Divine Realm expert.

Also, the amazing talent displayed by Jian Wushuang had completely conquered these experts.

“Yes.”

Many experts nodded. Even Palace Master Ming Xin, who was not very fond of Jian Wushuang, still nodded reluctantly.

“In addition, since he has condensed his Sword Heart, it won’t take long for him to fully grasp the third sword scar. Once he does, he will be qualified to become my personal disciple, at which point I’ll take him to cultivate at Sword Mountain,” Xuan Yi continued.

“Sword Mountain?” All the experts’ attention was immediately caught by these words, but each of them just nodded.

After seeing this, Xuan Yi smiled satisfactorily and returned to watching the image in front of him.

The current image was of Jian Wushuang continuing his journey to the next floor.

After condensing his Sword Heart, Jian Wushuang’s battle strength had improved several times. At the same time, his swordsmanship was more profound and delicate, which was completely different than before.

After passing through the 27th floor, he appeared on the 28th floor.

The ten Puppet Fighters on the 28th floor were slightly stronger than those on the 27th floor, but not much stronger. However, with his swordsmanship, Jian Wushuang easily passed through it.

The Puppet Fighters on the 29th floor were able to pressure Jian Wushuang somewhat, but only a little bit. After short struggle, he passed through the 29th floor as well.

The battle strength of Puppet Fighters on the 30th layer was another notch higher than those of the 29th floor. On the 30th floor, Jian Wushuang was forced to use his full strength. By releasing both of his Original Bodies, maximizing his Sword Heart, and using the full potential of is body, Jian Wushuang finally managed to pass through this floor.

The 31st floor.

It was also the final layer of the Ninth Heaven Road. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Reaching this floor meant that Jian Wushuang had basically reached the peak of the mountain, only one step away from the true summit.

However, this last step was as difficult as going to heaven.

In the Ninth Heaven Road, every five floors was considered a small threshold and every fifteen floors was regarded as a large milestone.

Going from the 30th to the 31st floor meant arriving at the final floor of the Ninth Heaven Road, and it was the most difficult floor by far.

The ten Puppet Fighters on the 31st floor were much stronger than those on the previous floor. Jian Wushuang was even afraid that one of the Puppet Fighters on the 31st floor could battle with the ten Puppet Fighters on the 30th floor. It felt like a single Puppet Fighter on the 31st floor was equivalent to ten Puppet Fighters from the previous floor.

The ten Puppet Fighters joined hands and work closely with each other. After only two exchanges, both of his Original Bodies had been defeated.

In the end, Jian Wushuang was forced to stop at the 31st floor.

This result did not surprise the Ancient Sect experts at all.

“The battle strength of each Puppet Fighter on the 31st floor of the Ninth Heaven Road was the same as a peak intermediate Divine Realm expert. If the ten Puppet Fighters work together, the average advanced Divine Realm expert might not even be able to win. The boy really is terrific. However, in the end, he is still only in the Skyscraping Realm, so his battle strength is weaker than an advanced Divine Realm expert.”

“Being able to make it that far already proves he is incredibly powerful.”

“If he is given a little more time to fully grasp the forth Occult of the World Dao and Slaughter Dao, and to cultivate another Secret Skill, combined with his Sword Heart, he is likely to pass through the 31st floor. But, for now, it’s still too soon.”

The experts sighed.
