4128 Disappointed?

Outside the trial field.

“Ninth Kalpa King has used his famous secret skill.”

“I heard that this secret skill has nine moves, and the further it goes, the more powerful and terrifying it will be. Back then, he used this secret skill to fight against a Supreme expert head-on. Even the Supreme expert praised this secret skill. But now, Jian Wushuang, who is fighting with him, not only has a stronger divine power than him, but his comprehension of the universe principles is also higher than his. I just don’t know if he can defeat him with this secret skill.”

“You’ll see, I’m looking forward to it now.”

Before the fight between Jian Wushuang and the Ninth Kalpa King, almost no one thought that Jian Wushuang would lose without a doubt.

But until now, Jian Wushuang had shown that his divine power was stronger than that of the Ninth Kalpa King in the trial field, and even his comprehension of the principles of the universe was higher than that of the Ninth Kalpa King, these people did not dare to think that Jian Wushuang would definitely lose this battle. Instead, there was a little more suspense.

Rumble…

The divine power was like a prison, filling the entire space of the trial field.

The shocking palm prints were so powerful that they brought more and more pressure to Jian Wushuang.

Of course, this pressure was within Jian Wushuang’s tolerance.

In the blink of an eye, nine moves palm print, Ninth Kalpa King had already performed the first Eighth moves.

The first seven moves of the Eighth moves palm print were easily blocked by Jian Wushuang’s Wuqi Divine Sword. Only the Eighth move was blocked by Jian Wushuang, but his body was slightly lowered by the impact, he looked a bit embarrassed.

But soon after, Ninth Kalpa King’s ninth palm print had begun to take shape.

The power of this palm print had reached its peak after the accumulation of the first Eighth palm prints.

The moment it took shape, even Jian Wushuang’s pupils could not help shrinking.

“This palm seems to be several times stronger than the Eighth palm. In terms of Dao comprehension alone, he is probably comparable to a Supreme-being,” Jian Wushuang thought.

Jian Wushuang’s attainments in sword principle were also very high. He had reached the completion of the first stage of the universe origin of sword principle. In addition to his continuous improvement over the past few years, he was probably one of the strongest among the Ultimate Rulers.

However, the Ninth Kalpa King had stayed at the level of an Ultimate Ruler for dozens of chaos cycles. Such a long time had not only allowed his comprehension of the universe principles to reach an extremely high level, but also his comprehension of Dao, he could even rival an ordinary Supreme-being.

Even if the ninth palm, which he had created to become famous, had not reached the Supreme-being level, it was probably not too far off.

However, the more it was like this, the brighter the light in Jian Wushuang’s eyes became.

“This is more interesting.” Jian Wushuang smiled with a hint of excitement on his face. “Well, let this palm of yours test my progress in the sword principle over the years.”

In the space of the trial field, Jian Wushuang looked up at the huge palm print that was slowly pressing down. He felt the shocking power contained in the palm print, but there was a strong power of the universe principles on his body, as a large amount of universe origin of sword principle swept up crazily, and it was obviously two completely different powers, at this moment, they were perfectly combined.

The Universe principle and the universe origin of sword principle were perfectly combined!

Jian Wushuang’s achievements in the Purple Blood Secret Manual were perfectly reflected at this moment. His five well-jointed fingers also held tightly onto the hilt of the Wuqi Divine Sword and slashed down at the Ninth Kalpa King!

This sword attack shocked the world!

No words could describe Jian Wushuang’s sword attack.

The sword spread across thousands of meters like divine lightning tearing through the dark night, splitting the entire starry sky in half. It was as bright as the sun and as if the Milky Way was hanging upside down.

Jian Wushuang had comprehended this sword principle for nearly 300,000 years. It was his most powerful sword move after being baptized by the Life Nirvana Pool!

This sword move merged with his 8,000 times strength of divine power, the first level after he broke through the Purple Blood Bible, and the perfect combination of his use of the universe principles and the sword principle universe origin!

This sword strike did not have a name, but it was Jian Wushuang’s most powerful sword strike apart from his innate divine power!

At this moment, everyone outside the Divine Hall raised their heads and looked at the boundless starry sky in the trial field in horror as if they were looking at a ghost. The astonishing sword rainbow that pierced through heaven and earth and cut across the sun and moon gradually opened its mouth wide.

The stunning sword strike directly collided with the most powerful palm strike of the Ninth Kalpa King without any hindrance.

Bang!

A terrifying explosion sounded, and the entire trial field was instantly plunged into a terrifying divine power storm.

The two terrifying powers collided crazily, destroying everything.

After a while, the dust settled.

Jian Wushuang and the Ninth Kalpa King still stood face to face in the middle of the trial field. Jian Wushuang had a strange smile on his face, but the Ninth Kalpa King’s eyes were abnormally shocked.

“You actually blocked my ninth palm?” Ninth Kalpa King looked at Jian Wushuang in disbelief.

“Your palm is very strong. In terms of absolute art level, my attack just now was not as strong as yours. However, my comprehension of the universe principles and even the use of the universe origin of sword principle are much higher than yours. That’s why you and I are evenly matched in this collision,” Jian Wushuang said seriously.

Yes, the final result of the collision was that Jian Wushuang did not lose and Ninth Kalpa King did not win. The two people’s attacks collided and were eventually annihilated. They were evenly matched.

Jian Wushuang could accept this result, but Ninth Kalpa King could not accept it.

“He has only cultivated for more than 300,000 years, but his comprehension of the universe principles is so much higher than mine. Even my famous absolute art can be countered by his swordsmanship.” Ninth Kalpa King clenched his hands, his heart was trembling.

“Ninth Kalpa King.” Jian Wushuang looked at him again. “You lowered yourself to fight with me so that you could take out two lower-grade and 200,000 origin stones to poison my middle-grade principle divine fruit. You’ve always been so confident, but if your strength is only at this level, you’ll disappoint me.”

“Disappointed you?”

Ninth Kalpa King’s face turned completely ugly, and his eyes were filled with raging anger, “Good, very good. Jian Wushuang, you’ve completely angered me. I didn’t want to use my innate divine power to fight you, a junior who has cultivated for 300,000 years, but now...”

Ninth Kalpa King’s eyes suddenly turned cold, and then he suddenly raised his head and stared at Jian Wushuang with bloodshot eyes.

The next moment!

Boom!

In an instant, an extremely violent aura exploded with Ninth Kalpa King at the center, and his whole body began to expand rapidly!
