Chapter 2677: No Chance to Survive Even Though Surrendered!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“I’ll be the new leader of the Dragon Divine Gang from today. I wonder if any of you disagree?”

Jian Wushuang’s voice rang in the ears of everyone present—making all the Dragon Divine Gang’s Heaven Ultimate Gods astonished.

A hint of anger rose from the bottom of their hearts after a brief moment of stupor.

It was not surprising they were agitated by a stranger who came out of nowhere and broke into the hall before claiming to be their new Dragon Divine Gang Master.

They would feel better if the person was a Peak Heaven Ultimate God, but Su Han who plunged into the Gang Leader’s seat was only emanating the aura of a High-level Heaven Ultimate God.

Did that person who was just a High-level Heaven Ultimate God want to be their leader?

What a joke!

“Your Excellency is too full of yourself. Although the Dragon Divine Gang is just an ordinary third-rate sect, not anyone can just barge in and bully us,” said the graceful red-clothed woman in a deep voice.

The purple-haired middle-aged man shouted in a very low voice, “Humph, you’re just a High-level Heaven Ultimate God while we still have five High-level Heaven Ultimate God here, you won’t make it into the list even if we were to vote for a new leader. Get lost!”

The others were also glaring fiercely at Jian Wushuang.

“It seems that all of you are not willing. If that’s the case...” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently and just cracked a smile. Buzz... He discharged an earth-shaking sword intent before completely displaying his 10,000 miles Sword World.

The terrifying Sword World oppressed the audience and shocked all of them.

There were nearly thirty people present with all of them being at the level of a Heaven Ultimate God, yet their expressions changed drastically under the Sword World’s shock and oppression.

“It’s Principle World!”

“What a terrifying Principle World. It’s only at Profound Realm, but gives me the feeling that it’s no less than a Complete Principle World Realm!”

“Oops, the deterrent effect of this Principle World is so strong that it has greatly restricted my strength.”

“Is Su Han going to attack us?”

All the Heaven Ultimate Gods were frightened and were ready to take action.

Jian Wushuang made a move under their gaze.

Buzz!

His figure disappeared out of thin air and reappeared next to the purple-haired middle-aged man as though he teleported.

“This speed...” The purple-haired middle-aged man’s eyes went wide. He was a dignified and honorable High-level Heaven Ultimate God, yet incapable of reacting to Jian Wushuang’s terrifying speed.

Jian Wushuang casually tapped his sword against the purple-haired middle-aged man’s divine body before his figure became blurry and faded away again.

Jian Wushuang’s phantom-like body hurtled around the hall as he appeared and disappeared next to all the Heaven Ultimate Gods like a flickering star. Those Heaven Ultimate Gods failed to capture Jian Wushuang or organize any attacking strategy.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

There was a series of low grunting sounds when Jian Wushaung’s Blood Mountain Sword tapped on all the Heaven Ultimate Gods. However, Jian Wushuang did not use his divine power—he just wanted to make them tremble.

Jian Wushuang was back in the main seat again after a while with his Blood Mountain Sword sheathed as the Sword World that flooded the hall slowly vanished. Jian Wushuang wore a faint smile and commented, “Am I qualified to be your leader now?”

The hall fell silent.

Almost 30 Heaven Ultimate Gods were staring at Jian Wushuang in horror.

It was too fast. Jian Wushuang was too fast. They were incapable of reacting in time.

In that very short time, Jian Wushuang used the body of his longsword to tap on each of them once.

They would have died in that short time if Jian Wushuang used his sword’s edge to cut their heads instead of the flat side.

“T-too strong!”

“It was too fast. He can kill us like killing chickens with this terrifying speed. Not only the Primary-level Heaven Ultimate Gods but even the High-level Heaven Ultimate Gods won’t be spared.”

“He’s only a High-level Heaven Ultimate God. How can his speed possibly be so fast?”

“It’s Space-time Strangulation. His perception of the Space-time Law must have reached the second stage Space-time Strangulation, otherwise, he won’t be so fast. In addition, he’s assisted from the great shocking effect of his Sword World...”

“Although he looked like just a High-level Heaven Ultimate God, he’s more terrifying than a genuine Peak Heaven Ultimate God. It’s not easy for a Peak Heaven Ultimate God to kill us, but he can easily kill us.”

The Dragon Divine Gang Heaven Ultimate God looked at Jian Wushuang in awe.

Experts were highly respected in the world. It was the same in Dragon Divine Gang.

They initially thought just a High-level Heaven Ultimate God such as Jian Wushuang was not qualified to be their leader, but no one dared to think as such at that moment.

“Surrender or die—choose for yourself.”

Jian Wushuang spoke again with his cold voice at that moment as a faint killing intent filled the hall.

The Dragon Divine Gang’s High-level Heaven Ultimate Gods shuddered.

“Long Shan is pleased to meet the Gang Leader!” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Long Shan—the bald old man was the first to bow down to Jian Wushuang and surrendered to Jian Wushuang.

“This old thing... didn’t he insist we should fight the Purple Beast Alliance Master just now?”

The graceful red-clothed woman and the purple-haired middle-aged man were both irritated.

They did not know that Long Shan was not courageous but only loyal to the deceased Dragon Divine Gang Master and wanted to avenge his leader who was killed by the Purple Beast Alliance Master. He was of course not willing to surrender.

However, Long Shan chose to surrender to Jian Wushuang without hesitation because Jian Wushuang had nothing to do with the Purple Beast Alliance on top of being incredibly powerful.

“Those who don’t surrender—are you seeking death?” Jian Wushuang’s cold eyes glanced at the graceful red-clothed woman and the purple-haired middle-aged man.

“Master Su Han.” The graceful red-clothed woman took a deep breath and solemnly said, “Dragon Divine Gang has always respected the strong. Anyone powerful could be the leader. Master, you are indeed qualified to be our leader based on your strength. However, do you know of the Dragon Divine Gang’s current situation?”

“Your current situation? Tell me about it.” Jian Wushuang looked down.

“Our Gang Leader was beheaded by the Purple Beast Alliance Master who gave us a one-month deadline to submit to them. Otherwise, he’ll kill all of us as he wants to wipe the Dragon Divine Gang out...” The graceful red-clothed woman did not continue her words.

“So, that’s the situation.” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently. “It’s easy. I’ll handle the Purple Beast Alliance and dismiss them when they are here.”
