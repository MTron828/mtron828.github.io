“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was interested.

If Emperor God Tian Xiao were to be wandering in the Second Lair, he had no scruples.

“How about Emperor God Tian Xiao?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Emperor God Tian Xiao has been in a commanding position in Soaring Heaven King Palace all this while. He hardly wanders in the lairs or dangerous places while his power is far weaker than Emperor God Tian Ling’s. Emperor God Tian Ling is on the top among Emperor Gods while Emperor God Tian Xiao is merely intermediate among Emperor Gods.”

“Intermediate? How about if he is compared to Emperor God Xue Gu?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“He should be weaker compared to Emperor God Xue Gu. However, Emperor God Tian Xiao has two Chaotic Divine Treasures. In particular, there is one defense armor. Hence, you can’t belittle him either,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Two Chaotic Divine Treasure? One of it is even a defense armor?” Jian Wushuang was surprised and astonished at the abundant treasure that Emperor God Tian Xiao had.

One should know that Emperor God Xue Gu only had one Chaotic Divine Treasure, which was the crimson trident.

“Besides the higher-ups, Soaring Heaven King Palace is a top force that is powerful in Eternal Chaotic World after all, you shouldn’t belittle the trump cards that they hold. If you fight with them head-on, you should be cautious,” Hall Master Yuan exhorted.

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly as he already made up his mind.

Although Emperor God Tian Xiao had two Chaotic Divine Treasure, he alone couldn’t make Jian Wushuang worried.

As for the other Sir Gods, he couldn’t be bothered. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He needed to be concerned about the trump cards that Soaring Heaven King Palace had.

“Jian Wushuang, I have to remind you that Soaring Heaven King Palace is much stronger than Lineage of Star. Although, due to the Master of Star Palace, Soaring Heaven King Palace didn’t have the guts to declare war against Lineage of Star. If we of Lineage of Star were to take the initiative to taunt them and corner them, it would be a different story. So, if you want to take revenge on Soaring Heaven King Palace, you can only do it alone. We of Lineage of Star can’t help you on the surface.”

“Of course, when it reaches a crucial moment, such as your life being threatened, I will tell the Master of Star Palace to get involved personally,” Hall Master Yuan sounded solemn. “You have boundless prospects and you are significant to Lineage of Star. If you were to be in danger, we of Lineage of Star would definitely go all-out to protect you, even if it means war against Soaring Heaven King Palace.”

“Mm, I understand,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly.

Ever since Jian Wushuang had fought with Soaring Heaven King Palace, Lineage of Star had never once had a conflict with Soaring Heaven King Palace in public. It had only been Jian Wushuang fighting with Soaring Heaven King Palace alone. It wasn’t because Lineage of Star wasn’t willing to assist Jian Wushuang but because Lineage of Star was at a difficult position.

If it wasn’t necessary, Lineage of Star wasn’t willing to get involved. The moment they got involved, they would definitely break apart with Soaring Heaven King Palace. By then, it would drag up too many affairs.

After he got to know more about Soaring Heaven King Palace, Jian Wushuang immediately departed.

…

One of the ten sanctuaries, Colored Glaze Sanctuary!

Colored Glaze Sanctuary was considered a more spacious sanctuary in the ten sanctuaries. There was a total of eight huge continents.

Among the eight continents, Soaring Heaven King Palace took up two of them.

The two continents were where the lair of Soaring Heaven King Palace was located, also the deep-rooted Soaring Heaven Land.

The other one was Sea Continent.

The original overlord of Sea Continent wasn’t Soaring Heaven King Palace but a strong force that could compare favorably to Lineage of Star. However, the force experienced an accident whereby their strongest Emperor God passed away as he wandered in the Third Lair.

Without their Emperor God, the force naturally couldn’t remain as the overlord of Sea Continent. Immediately, there was a war. As the force was destroyed, Soaring Heaven King Palace on Soaring Heaven Land got involved arrogantly and defeated the other forces in Sea Continent. Since then, Soaring Heaven King Palace had become the overlord of Sea Continent.

Soaring Heaven King Palace had even left a strong power in Sea Continent as a deterrent to all enemies. The power was concentrated in the middle of Sea Continent where Soaring Heaven Mansion was located.

As Jian Wushuang came to take revenge, he definitely had to come to the territory that Soaring Heaven King Palace had conquered.

Between Soaring Heaven Land and Sea Continent, Jian Wushuang opted for the latter.

Sea Continent, a huge bustling city that was floating in the air. The city’s name was Sea City.

On Sea Continent, it could be named as Sea City. Its importance could be well imagined. In the entire Sea Continent, only Soaring Heaven Mansion could be compared to the flourishing city favorably.

In an exquisite restaurant in Sea City, Jian Wushuang sat in his crimson robe and carried his sword on his back as he read the set of information that he had just received.

“Vientiane Tower Treasure Auction?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows, “Interesting.”

Vientiane Tower was absolutely the number one chamber of commerce in Eternal Chaotic World. They possessed boundless treasures and rare books.

Vientiane Tower on every continent in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries would throw a treasure auction every once in a while.

The treasure auction was huge. Many forces and sects on the continent, including many solo experts, would participate.

Jian Wushuang had just happened to make it in time for Vientiane Tower Treasure Auction in Sea Continent. The treasure auction was going to take place in Vientiane Tower in Sea Continent ten days later.

“I want to take revenge and I have to strike at the experts of Soaring Heaven King Palace. However, the experts are scattered all around Sea Continent. It won’t be easy to find them. However, Vientiane Tower treasure auction is such a major event, even Soaring Heaven King Palace will definitely send influential experts to participate. This happens to provide me a great chance.”

“As for how I want to do this…”

Jian Wushuang was in deep thought but there was suddenly a commotion outside the restaurant.

Jian Wushuang spread his soul power and he saw a few figures flying over from the void afar. The few of them had ferocious auras that were already at the level of Chaotic Real God. The one who was leading was a top Chaotic Real God.

The commotion outside the restaurant was stirred by their arrival.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang found out the background of the few figures via eavesdropping the conversations around him.

“Thunder Rolls Palace, a strong force in Sea Continent but they don’t have any Almighty in commanding position. The leading one among them is the top Chaotic Real God, the master of Thunder Rolls Palace,” Jian Wushuang tapped the table with his finger as the corners of his lips lifted into a smile.

When he saw the master of Thunder Rolls Palace, he already had a plan in his mind.

Then, Jian Wushuang immediately moved and got close to the few Chaotic Real Gods from Thunder Rolls Palace.
