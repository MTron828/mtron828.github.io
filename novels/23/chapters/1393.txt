He was in Tian Ling Mystery Land for almost three hundred years! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

His gains were far beyond his expectations before.

At first, he had only intended to improve his manipulation method of Soul Power and his grasp of Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack with the aid of a large number of Soul Masters in Tian Ling Mystery Land.

He thought it would be good enough if he could achieve the Initial Success stage for the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack.

But then, he was at Great Achievement stage for Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack. On top of that, the battles with various Soul Masters allowed him to accumulate an abundance of experience.

Besides, he had killed Bei Xiu and obtained the black long spear and other treasures. Not forgetting his obtainment of the consciousness attack method, Eighteen Asura Hell.

With all of that on hand, he had certainly gained a bounty.

“Oh yeah, Hall Palace Yuan. When I was wandering in Tian Ling Mystery Land, someone talked about the utmost expert in Tian Ling Mystery Land, Real God Demonic Rain. It was said that she left Tian Ling Mystery Land before to wander in the Eternal Chaotic World.” Jian Wushuang suddenly said.

“Yes, Real God Demonic Rain did wander around the Eternal Chaotic World before. Even within the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, she gained fame. Her consciousness attack was extremely terrifying. Among the Real Gods who are good at consciousness attack in the Eternal Chaotic World, she is definitely in the top five. Especially the Eighteen Asura Hell that she created… it’s extremely impressive. In terms of her overall power, she is on the list of Real Gods. Although she was slightly lower than Lei Chao, her kind of power is extremely rare.” Hall Palace Yuan explained.

“As expected,” Jian Wushuang was impressed.

The experts listed on the Real Gods list were a bunch of Real Gods that could carry out a massacre. No wonder Real God Demonic Rain had been treated so highly in Tian Ling Land.

“Real God Demonic Rain also knew that Tian Ling Mystery Land, where she was, was under the command of Lineage of Star. She didn’t dare to resist. Hence, she once made a deal with Lineage of Star with her identity as an expert in Tian Ling Mystery Land.”

“The context of the deal was that the disciples from Lineage of Star could enter Tian Ling Mystery Land for training. Regardless of any treasure that they obtained from Tian Ling Mystery Land, they can take care of them themselves. Similarly, if the disciples were to die in Tian Ling Mystery Land, we Lineage of Star couldn’t blame the cultivators in Tian Ling Mystery Land,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Oh, I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded quietly.

Jian Wushuang didn’t ask further. After having a simple understanding of Real God Demonic Rain, he returned to Sword Star.

Sword Star.

“It’s been almost three hundred years since I last came back.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. He couldn’t help but crease his eyebrows after he returned to Sword Star.

He was a disciple of Star Palace. On Sword Star, he had many maids and servants. However, it was extremely quiet on Sword Star then. When his Soul Power swept over the place, there was no one.

“What’s going on?”

Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows then took out a communication token, “Qiu Yue.”

“Mister, you came back from the mystery land?” Qiu Yue replied very quickly.

“I just got back,” Jian Wushuang replied and immediately asked, “Why, when I return to Sword Star, is no one here? Where did all of you go?”

“Mister, we are all on Tai Yuan Star.” Qiu Yue replied.

“Tai Yuan Star? Medicine Garden? What are you all going there?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

“Nothing. Mister Bai Lipeng needed some assistance and he asked for help,” Qiu Yue replied.

“He looked to you for help?” Jian Wushuang found it weird.

“Wait for me there. I will come to Tai Yuan Star now.”

Jian Wushuang told Qiu Yue and immediately departed to Tai Yuan Star.

Tai Yuan Star was the biggest star in the Lineage of Star formation.

Due to its huge area, the Lineage of Star set the medicine garden on Tai Yuan Star. Many medicinal materials for elixirs that cultivators could use were planted on Tai Yuan Star. As it was a medicine garden, it naturally required someone to look after it.

Just as Jian Wushuang appeared on Tai Yuan Star, he saw a bustling crowd in the huge medicine garden. The crowd was made of maids and servants under his command, including Qiu Yue.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang appeared in the middle of the medicine garden directly

“Qiu Yue,” Jian Wushuang’s voice was heard.

“Master!” Qiu Yue walked over.

“Master,” the maids and servants put down their tasks on hand and bowed politely at Jian Wushuang.

“You’re all my people. Why didn’t you stay on Sword Star. Why did you come here?” Jian Wushuang looked cold.

“This…” The maids and servants looked at each other but no one dared to speak.

Qiu Yue looked like she was in a difficult position.

“What’s going on exactly?” Jian Wushuang looked towards Qiu Yue.

Before Qiu Yue replied, there was a figure that plundered out from the void nearby.

“A bunch of dumbasses, how dare you be so lazy?”

The raging reprimand could be heard before the person arrived.

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and he looked at the incomer.

The incomer was a bald elderly in a green shirt. The bald elderly had ferocious features. His eyes were cold. He appeared in the void before Jian Wushaung and the rest. He looked at them with a cold gaze.

“How dare you be lazy before me. It seems like I didn’t punish you enough previously and you couldn’t remember it,” the bald elderly said coldly and took out a green long whip.

The long whip was extremely flexible. It looked just like a living cobra.

Looking at the bald elderly drawing the long whip, the surrounding maids and servants showed terror in their eyes.

Jian Wushuang saw the scene and his pupils contracted.

“Dumbasses, you’re really asking for a whipping!”

The bald elderly bellowed and swung his hand. The cobra-like green, long whip swept out and whipped at the maidservant nearest to him.

The maid servant was merely a Universe God in the First Heaven. She had no power to resist the whip held by the bald elderly.

She could only watch the long whip flying towards her body.

Just as the long whip was about to reach the maidservant’s body, buzz! A shapeless strength blocked the maidservants. That shapeless strength suddenly transformed into a two-meter tall giant. The giant swung his hand and grabbed the whip. No matter how forceful the bald elderly was, the long whip wouldn’t move an inch.

Formation with consciousness, according to Jian Wushuang’s manipulation standard of Soul Power, he could use his Soul Power and transform them into any shape anytime. It only varied in the strength of its power.

“What?” The bald elderly’s face changed and he finally noticed Jian Wushuang’s existence.

Jian Wushuang then looked extremely cold.
