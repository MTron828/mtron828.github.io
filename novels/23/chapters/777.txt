Chapter 778: The Strongest Move!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Seeing this vague sword shadow rushing over, Tian Yunzi nodded inwardly, “Its power has reached the Peak of Step Four. No wonder Yun Fan and the other two monsters could not withstand it.”

After murmuring that sentence, Tian Yunzi lifted his head suddenly. He opened his mouth slightly and uttered a word.

“Break!”

After which, a Thunderbolt immediately appeared in front of Tian Yunzi. It entailed terrifying power and instantly lashed out.

This Thunderbolt may seem small, but it contained an incredible power. After colliding into the sword shadow leashed out by Jian Wushuang, it immediately broke the latter into pieces. The force generated rippled outwards and sent even Jian Wushuang flying.

Yun Fan, Saber Master, Old Weirdo Dream were unable to resist this strike, but Tian Yunzi easily shattered it by saying a word.

Tian Yunzi’s power could not be questioned.

The spectators were astounded by his strength and sighed inwardly, “This is the real strength of a Dao Master?”

Jian Wushuang, however, was not surprised at Tian Yunzi rebutting his swordsmanship and sending him flying away. Instead, a grin spread across his face.

“Seems that I’m right, you’re just a doppelganger,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Doppelganger?” The spectators were shocked.

The Tian Yunzi in front of them was a doppelganger?

A doppelganger could smash Jian Wushuang’s powerful strike so easily?

“You not only have great talent, you also have good eyes!” The doppelganger replied with a faint smile.

After all, Tian Yunzi was a Dao Master, it was unnecessary for him to come down personally to deal with a Divine Realm expert. Hence, he sent his doppelganger here.

Although the doppelganger’s strength was far inferior to the Original Body, Tian Yunzi thought that it was strong enough to fight against Jian Wushuang.

“As I expected.” Jian Wushuang grinned.

When he saw Tian Yunzi, he immediately suspected that this was not his Original Body, no matter how unusual its aura was or how terrifying its strength was.

That was the reason why he dared to challenge Tian Yunzi.

If his opponent was Tian Yunzi’s Original Body, Jian Wushuang would not be stupid enough to fight a Dao Master.

Faced with a doppelganger, he might have an opportunity to win by playing his trump cards.

Tian Yunzi said with a faint smile, “I am indeed the doppelganger. Although I only have less than 10 percent of the Original Body’s strength, it should be enough to attack a small guy like you.”

“Come and try!”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and thought,?“What he said is true, his doppelganger has less than 10% of his strength. But he is still a Dao Master after all, even 10% of his strength is far superior to an expert at Step Four of the Eternal Realm. I’m just not sure if he is at Step Five or Six.”

“No matter what Realm he is at now, I can’t defeat him by using just the third movement of the Boundless Heaven Sword Art. There’s only one move that can help me fight against him.”

Thinking of this, his eyes lit up.

Then he moved again.

Jian Wushuang’s 15-meter figure was standing in the void with a 10-meter-long Emperor Sword in his hand. However, he waved his hand and withdrew his sword into its sheath.

The spectators were startled by the scene.

“He withdrew his sword?”

“Perhaps he knows he is unable to defeat him, so he’s going to surrender to the doppelganger?”

“After all, he is facing the Palace Master of Cloud Sea Asgard, Tian Yunzi. Even if it is just a doppelganger, it is still stronger than him. It’s no surprise to surrender to him. But if he goes to fight, it only brings disgrace on his own head.”

The spectators sighed.

In their eyes, Jian Wushuang was proficient in Sword Principle. Since he withdrew his longsword, he definitely would not attack again.

However, Jian Wushuang’s battle intent became increasingly stronger after he withdrew his sword.

He stood there with a soaring killing intent. He clenched his right fist and punched himself heavily in the chest.

“Puff!”

He spat out a mouthful of fresh blood that had a flicker of dark gold in it. After which, he held the blood tightly in his hand and a strange energy surged suddenly.

Jian Wushuang stared at the doppelganger deadly. Suddenly, he pointed to its direction with the bloody hand.

“Three Fingers of the Ancient God!”

“First Finger, Barrier-breaking!

Boom!!

A giant spiral tunnel appeared in the vast Void out of nowhere.

It had a radius of 100 feet and a length of more than 1,000 feet. It appeared so suddenly as if someone poked a huge hole in the sky.

There was terrifying power gathering in this tunnel. The next moment, a giant gold finger showed up.

This gold finger was filled with overwhelming destructive power, as if it came from ancient times.

The whole area fell dead silent.

All the spectators stared at the gold finger in terror. They all got goosebumps and felt their scalps tingle, as if their heads were about to explode.

“This, this…”

Yun Fan, Saber Master, and Old Weirdo Dream were aghast.

Although the three experts at Step Four of the Eternal Realm knew they were not its target, they still had an illusion that they would be shattered to pieces once they came into contact with the gold finger.

This finger’s terrifying strength was far beyond their expectation. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Even Tian Yunzi’s eyes bulged at the sight of it.

“What a powerful Secret Skill! He’s only at Step Four of the Eternal Realm, but the power of his Secret Skill is way greater than the experts at Step Five of the Eternal Realm. This boy has actually been hiding such a skill?”

Many people had the same question in their minds.

Jian Wushuang had shown his non-comparable heaven-defying strength. He had caused Yun Fan, Saber Master, and Old Weirdo Dream to retreat through his incredible swordsmanship.

His Red Shade Sword Move had amazed all the other Eternal Realm experts.

But who would have thought that Jian Wushuang was still able to display even more powerful and terrifying skills?
