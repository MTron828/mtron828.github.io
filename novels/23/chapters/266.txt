Chapter 267: Potential!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Dim moonlight shone over the earth.

Ling Han came to the courtyard where Jian Wushuang lived, followed by a noble and dignified young man.

“Listen, Ye Se, try your best to make that man battle with all his strength, you can invite him to fight with you, if he doesn’t agree, you can force him to do so, but do not hurt him too badly, understand?” looking at the young man, Ling Han warned.

The young man was called Ye Se, the strongest among the young generation in Daluo Heaven Sect. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

In the young generation of Daluo Heaven Sect, he was the only one who was capable of fighting with Chen Feng.

“I got it.” Ye Se nodded slightly. As he was talking, he was ready to go to the courtyard.

“Em, wait a minute!” suddenly Ling Han shouted to stop him.

“What happened?” Ye Se looked over at him.

Ling Han didn’t say anything, but his eyes had turned to the courtyard.

They could see Jian Wushuang, wearing black, practicing swordsmanship alone.

There was nothing special before, but when Ling Han saw Jian Wushuang practicing swordsmanship, his eyes narrowed by instinct.

“That is...the Origin?” Ling Han was shocked.

As a powerhouse of Half-saint Level, he had comprehended the origin and he was familiar with it.

He was not shocked that Jian Wushuang had comprehended the Origin, but that while Jian Wushuang was practicing swordsmanship, the Origin had inspired the force of the heaven and the earth.

In the courtyard, Jian Wushuang was brandishing the sword freely. The sword light was sparkling under the moonlight. Those normal sword shadows seemed to shake the heaven and the earth.

Each move inspired the Source of Heaven and Earth.

“Motivating the heaven and the earth, this is potential!” Ling Han’s eyes were full of astonishment.

“It’s weird.” seeing Jian Wushuang practicing swordsmanship, Ye Se also narrowed his eyes.

“Ye Se, go to the hall immediately, bring the Sect Master and Elders here.” Ling Han told him.

“What?” Ye Se was shocked.

“Hurry.” Ling Han spoke seriously.

“Yes.” Ye Se left, soon Daluo Heaven Sect’s Master and Elders came to Ling Han. When they arrived, they were attracted by what was happening in the courtyard.

“This is...”

“Motivating the Source of Heaven and Earth?”

“Potential, the first level of Source Enlightenment!”

“How old is he, how could he reach such a level of Source Enlightenment?”

The Sect Master and Elders were all shocked.

There were three levels of source enlightenment, the first one was “potential”.

Even though it was the first level, it was hard to reach. It would take a normal expert of the Saint Realm dozens of years to reach it.

If one reached it, he would be recognized as a powerhouse in the Saint Realm.

But now, they saw a young man, who was about 20 years old and his Cultivation of Spiritual Power was in the Initial Yang Void Realm, who had reached such a level of source enlightenment.

“Ling Han, he is the genius invited by Alchemy School?” An elder asked directly.

“Yes, he is.” Ling Han nodded seriously.

“He is just 21 years old, how could he reach such a level of source enlightenment?” the elder sighed with emotion.

Among these people, Sect Master and two Elders, who were in Divine Transcendence, both the two elders had not reached the potential level of source enlightenment.

That is to say, Jian Wushuang’s level in source enlightenment was higher than them both.

“While I’m just getting Ye Se to sound out his real strength, I saw that. Therefore, I let him bring you here.” Ling Han said.

“Well done.” the Sect Master nodded, “even though his Cultivation of Spiritual Power was in Initial Yang Void Realm, he could fight with one in Peak of the Yang Void Realm with his source enlightenment. Maybe he has other cards, perhaps he could really kill one at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm.”

Hearing that, elders around him all agreed.

“Haha, I thought he was a normal person of Initial Yang Void Realm, it turns out that I am wrong.”

“Thinking about this carefully, it’s beneficial for the Alchemy School to wipe out Wilderness Sword Sect, how could they send a normal Initial Yang Void Realm here.”

“Though his Cultivation of Spiritual Power is a little bit low, it’s hard to judge his real strength.”

After seeing Jian Wushuang’s performance in source enlightenment, those elders who were not satisfied with Jian Wushuang’s low Cultivation of Spiritual Power changed their attitude.

It was incredible for a 21-year-old youth to reach the “potential” level in source enlightenment.

Compared with that, it was easier for one in Initial Realm of Yang Void Realm to kill one at Peak of the Yang Void Realm.

“By the way, did the young man request for something when he promised to give us a helping hand?” the Sect Master asked.

“Yes, he asked for the Sword Realm.” Ling Han replied.

“Give it to him.” the Sect Master said smilingly, “give it to him now, the competition will start in three days, if he could comprehend the Sword Realm, his strength will improve and he would be much more capable of killing Chen Feng.”

“Yes, Master.” Ling Han nodded. After taking the Sword Realm, he went to Jian Wushuang.

In the courtyard, Jian Wushuang had stopped practicing, he stood there, closing his eyes.

“Potential... lift the heavy as if it is light, motivate the heaven and the earth. I was wondering how it motivated, now I know it is the Origin that motivates the Source Energy.” Jian Wushuang opened his eyes with a smile.

These days he was studying the first level of source enlightenment, “potential”.

Just now, something flashed in his brain, it happened.

People would be jealous if they knew how he got it. After all, so many powerhouses, including some experts of the Saint Realm, went to great pains but failed. However, Jian Wushuang reached it by random inspiration.

Of course, this was because Jian Wushuang had great talent in meditation. But partly also because of his Sword Soul!

Sword Soul, not only made it easier for him to comprehend Sword Essence.

But also played an incomparable role in origin comprehension.
