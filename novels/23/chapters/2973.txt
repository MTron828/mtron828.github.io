Chapter 2974: The Second Phase of the Mission

——

Twenty million sacred elixirs was indeed not a small amount.

There were eight people on their team. If they split it equally, each of them would be able to obtain two million and five hundred thousand sacred elixirs, which was already quite a large amount.

However, even though they were in the same team, the strength of the people in the team was different, and their roles in the process of killing the Dragon Flame Beast were also different. Therefore, it was definitely impossible to split the sacred elixirs equally.

For example, the Barbarian King was the leader of the Barbarian King Team and was widely recognized as the strongest. The reason why he was able to kill the Dragon Flame Beast was largely that he had suppressed the Dragon Flame Beast. He had contributed so much, so he must have received more sacred elixirs.

Secondly, Jian Wushuang, Puyu, and Xue Dong King had contributed a lot, so they naturally received more sacred elixirs.

As for the remaining four people, they did not contribute much, so they did not share much.

Therefore, it was not acceptable for the weaker Peak False Saints to take only 20 million sacred elixirs.

“Captain, isn’t there a second option?” The Peak False Saint named ‘Ah Chao’ looked over.

“The second option is to continue to complete the second stage of the mission,” the Barbarian King said in a low voice. “The reward for the second stage of the mission is 10 times that of the first stage, which is 200 million sacred elixirs!”

Hearing this number, everyone present, except Jian Wushuang, could not help exclaiming.

200 million sacred elixirs…you must know that the Divine Earth Fruit that Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King had obtained was enough for many powerful Immortal Saints who had comprehended the rules of the earth to fight for. However, if they exchanged it with Sir Tianshuo, it’s only $100 million worth of sacred elixirs.

And the reward of this second stage mission unexpectedly was two Divine Earth Fruit!

For most True Saints, such a large sum of sacred elixirs was already an astronomical figure. Many True Saints who had reached the third or fourth rank would not be able to produce so many sacred elixirs, only those above the fifth rank, in the Immortal Saint has stood in the top level of the Immortal Saint, perhaps only has this ability.

“200 million sacred elixirs?” Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

He was also a little surprised.

After all, this was only an earth-level task. Although it was a three-star task, the reward should not be so ridiculous?

With 200 million sacred elixirs, he believed that even many one-star and two-star heaven-level tasks could not have such a high reward.

There must be something wrong!

Jian Wushuang firmly believed that the second phase of the mission was not to be looked down upon for such a high reward.

Everyone in the Barbarian King Team knew this, so when they learned about the second phase of the mission’s reward, although they were excited, they did not lose their minds.

“Captain, what is the second phase of the mission?” Xue Dong King asked.

Previously, the Barbarian King had only told them about the first phase of the mission. As for the second phase of the mission, they had only heard about it from the Barbarian King. However, no one knew the details of the mission.

“This mission…” The Barbarian King frowned. “I don’t know the details of the mission. It’s just that after we complete the first phase of the mission, we will take the corpse of the Dragon Flame Beast and stay in the Dragon Flame World for another month. After that, we can leave.”

“Stay for another month?”

“That simple?”

The members of the Barbarian King Team were all stunned.

“It looks simple, but the reward for this mission is 200 million sacred elixirs. The difficulty must be extraordinary. Moreover, we don’t know the details of this mission. It’s filled with all kinds of uncertainties. That’s why I’m a little hesitant to continue with the second phase of the mission,” said the Barbarian King in a deep voice.

“Let’s discuss it together.”

The eight members of the Barbarian King Team immediately began to discuss.

They did not know the details of the second phase of the mission, so they were not confident at all.

However, the reward of 200 million sacred elixirs made them very tempted.

After a simple discussion, everyone had an idea.

“200 million sacred elixirs. If we complete it, the eight of us can split it. Each of us can get at least 20 million sacred elixirs. This is a huge amount of money. For this huge amount of money, I’m willing to give it my all.” Ah Chao was the first to speak.

“I’m willing to give it my all.”

“Haha, it seems to be the same.”

…

The members spoke one after another. They were all willing to give it their all and continue to complete the second stage of the mission.

They could not resist the temptation of 200 million sacred elixirs.

Even though they knew that this mission was no small matter, they were willing to give it a try.

“I’m willing too.” Xue Dong King also spoke.

Jian Wushuang was the only one among the eight members of the Barbarian King Team who did not express his opinion.

Jian Wushuang immediately smiled when he noticed the gazes of the people around him. “Since everyone is interested, I’ll naturally accompany you to the end.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

In the end, he would only be able to get a few tens of millions of sacred elixirs. He did not care too much about it. After all, the destruction beast statue he appraised from Lord Tianshou was worth 500 million sacred elixirs, he just did not exchange it.

The eight of them reached an agreement. Then, they began to discuss the specific plan for the next step.

…

Here was a stretch of void not far from the Dragon Flame World. In this void, there was a black shrine floating.

In the shrine, several figures wearing the same clothes gathered together.

“It’s been more than ten days since the mission started. The first phase of the mission should be almost complete. What’s the result?” A middle-aged man wearing a triangular helmet spoke. His voice was loud and clear, echoing throughout the entire shrine.

“Sir, there are a total of thirty-four teams that have accepted the mission that we issued in the Dragon Flame World. Thirteen of these thirty-six teams have completed the first phase of the mission. As for the other twenty-three teams…” A man in black beside him said respectfully.

The members of the Barbarian King Team did not know that they were not the only team that had accepted this mission. There were a total of thirty-four teams.

Moreover, these thirty-four teams were all in the Dragon Flame World right now. It was just that they had not seen each other yet.

“Of the remaining twenty-three teams, three teams were defeated by the exotic beasts on the way to the mission. The remaining twenty teams were too slow. Most of the first rank True Saint Dragon Flame Beasts in the Dragon Flame World have already been killed by the other teams.”

“Send a message to the team leaders who killed the Dragon Flame Beasts and ask them if they are willing to continue with the second phase of the mission. As for those who haven’t completed the first phase of the mission yet, tell them that their mission has failed and ask them to leave the Dragon Flame World immediately,” the middle-aged man with the triangular helmet said coldly.

“Yes.” The black-clothed man nodded and immediately sent the message.
