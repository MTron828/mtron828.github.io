Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“The sixth place on the Universe God ranking list, Xin Zhu, who was previously in the fourth place. He’s not a person to provoke,” Jian Wushuang gasped with admiration.

“Jian Wushuang, I finally get to meet you,” the cold, evil-looking young man, Xin Zhu said. He fixed his cold gaze on Jian Wushuang, “But, you’re quite a lucky man. There are so many Universe Gods who put up life-and-death fights in the cave but couldn’t even get one White Blaze Fruit, yet you alone got nine of them.”

“Nine?”

“Jian Wushuang has nine White Blaze Fruits?”

“He really has nine. He already had four White Blaze Fruits previously. The eight White Blaze Fruits that came to the world earlier, he got five of them alone.”

Although the surrounding Universe Gods had only just rushed to the place, they had seen the fight scene earlier and knew that Jian Wushuang got five White Blaze Fruits in the earlier fight.

In addition to the four that he had had before, he held a total of nine.

A total of nine White Blaze Fruits was on Jian Wushuang. The surrounding Universe Gods looked at Jian Wushuang with burning gazes.

Jian Wushuang could feel the greed in the Universe Gods’ eyes clearly.

“I have to leave immediately. Otherwise, there will be more Universe Gods that gather here. In the end, there might be a hundred or even a thousand Universe Gods that besiege me. Plus, Xin Zhu is here too,” Jian Wushuang’s face grew dim and he immediately made a decision.

One must know just how great the movement was when the eight White Blaze Fruits came to the world. There was a large number of Universe Gods rushing over from the surroundings constantly.

“Run!”

There was a flash and Jian Wushuang performed the secret skill of Flowing Light Phantom. There were eighteen shadows created simultaneously. Jian Wushuang gave full play to his speed and retreated backwards at his maximum speed.

“Want to run?”

“Move, kill him!”

“Let’s do it together. Let’s kill him!”

The surrounding Universe God launched attacks one after another.

There were bolts of fierce aura that exploded. Some Universe Gods charged towards Jian Wushuang to pound him, and some stood on the spot but launched an?attack at Jian Wushuang from afar. The attacks flooded in at the same time at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang immediately made a huge black tortoise soar from his body as his body stealthily went through and dodged most of the attack.

Even when the remaining few strikes hit him, it didn’t cause him any damage.

With that factor alone, they couldn’t stop him.

“Jian Wushuang!”

There was suddenly a low bellow. The bellow was like a drumstick that hit Jian Wushuang vigorously. At the same time, Jian Wushuang could only feel the surrounding scenery began to change.

“Dreamland?” Jian Wushuang’s face changed and he complimented Xin Zhu’s technique from the bottom of his heart.

His back was facing Xin Zhu with many Universe Gods obstructing in between. However, Xin Zhu cast dreamland on him directly through his voice.

“Break!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his teeth and an enormous amount of Soul Power erupted. He instantly shook off the phantasmagoria with his strong mental state.

He just shook it off and Jian Wushuang immediately noticed a large number of figures hemming him in. There were about twenty Universe Gods who had gathered around him and they were launching attack against him.

“Courting death!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold. He poured out his Soul Power and formed into Soul Thorns. They were instantly immersed into the twenty Universe Gods’ bodies.

More than half of the twenty Universe Gods had their consciousnesses vanish. Although the remaining few endured it, their figures were hindered.

“Consciousness attack!”

“Jian Wushuang is also good at consciousness attacks and his consciousness attacks are so powerful!”

The remaining Universe Gods looked surprised.

Vroom!

A fierce force suddenly exploded.

Jian Wushuang immediately lifted his head but he noticed that Xin Zhu had appeared somewhere above him. At the same time, there were two tall figures that had substantiated.

“Jian Wushuang, die!” Xin Zhou’s voice was cold and the two tall figures suddenly moved.

The two tall figures were two huge headless warriors. They were in black armor, holding long speed in their hands as they dove downwards. When they appeared before Jian Wushuang, the two headless warriors stabbed with the long spears in their hands and pierced two big holes in the void.

Jian Wushuang looked solemn and he suddenly exploded his divine power. The power of Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor was given full play too.

Wow! Wow! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The two lightning-like strokes collided with the longspears in the two headless warriors’ hands. There were two low thuds and Jian Wushuang’s figure shrunk by a dozen zhang.

“Such strong power.”

Jian Wushuang looked at the two headless warriors in astonishment. After one exchange, he could tell that the two headless warriors were not any weaker than a Real God.

The two headless warriors joining forces were like fighting power of two Real Gods.

Hong!

The two headless warriors continued to attack Jian Wushuang with soaring arrogance.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang harumphed coldly and the eighteen shadows moved at the same time. Taking two simple turns in the void followed by a sprint. It was extremely creepy. It shuttled through the gap between the two headless warriors and appeared before Xin Zhu.

“This martial art motion?” Xin Zhou’s face grew grave.

Jian Wushuang was staring at Xin Zhu with his bright, sparkly eyes.

“Xin Zhu flung himself into consciousness attack. Disregarding that it’s a consciousness attack, his close combat skill is definitely not strong.”

“Ten Thousand Shadows!”

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The strokes of sword light swung out at the same time.

The sky was filled with hundreds of sword shadows at that very moment, like a sea of swords. Then, it engulfed Xin Zhu within.

But then, Xin Zhu gave full play to his strong consciousness powers, which combined with his divine powers flawlessly. Suddenly, hualala. Strokes of black, flowing lights flashed like long spears and collided with sword lights that Jian Wushuang had cast.

There was a clashing sound continuously. Jian Wushuang’s Ten Thousand Shadows were blocked by Xin Zhu at ease.

“You live up to your reputation of the sixth place on Universe God ranking list. Very impressive, but I have no time to play around with you.”

Jian Wushuang smirked coldly. Then, his figure suddenly retreated. He turned around and plunge into the void far away.

“You can’t run away!”

Xin Zhu let out a roar and then there was a pair of creepy black wings that appeared from nowhere.

The pair of black wings were formed entirely by Xin Zhou’s consciousness power. His divine power spread, hualala. Xin Zhu turned into a black flowing light and pierced the void to chase after Jian Wushuang. The speed that he was plunging at wasn’t much slower than Jian Wushuang.

The two figures, one running and one chasing, disappeared before everyone’s eyes very soon.
