Chapter 954: Life-devouring Formation

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“To those peak Dao Masters, luck not only increases their chances of obtaining opportunities and treasures but their strength as well. Moreover, they can even force their way through a bottleneck if they accumulate enough luck,” Gu King said.

“These people ought to have made plenty of preparation before, using a special formation to gather all the luck of the Tang Kingdom of the East for their own use. The luck will bring them great advantages while the Tang Kingdom will meet its demise!”

“I understand now.” Jian Wushuang nodded, awe flitting across his face.

No wonder Lord of Cercis Island would accuse Emperor Leng of going against the peace of the world.

No wonder Emperor Yun would choose to station here in Emperor Xiao’s camp. It turned out that Emperor Leng had set her sights on the Tang Kingdom of the East.

After all, a country who had lost all its luck would be a country waiting for its demise.

Hovering in the Void above, Emperor Xiao and the others all appeared pale.

Emperor of Tang had founded the Tang Kingdom of the East with a certain great skill and in the many years after, they had always sought ways to expand and strengthen the kingdom.

Yet, Emperor Leng had tried to rob the Tang Kingdom of its luck for her own benefit.

Back then, Emperor Xiao had broken off any friendship with Emperor Leng precisely because he had discovered the latter’s treachery. Their relationship worsened to the point that a war broke out between them.

“You lowly bastard, how can you answer to your Master after your actions today?” Emperor Xiao said with a snort.

“Humph! It’s just a little bit of luck. Once I make a breakthrough, I’ll find a way to reinvigorate the Tang Kingdom or just directly establish a better and stronger country,” Emperor Leng replied coldly.

The experts from Emperor Xiao’s camp immediately flew into a rage after hearing his words.

Even so, Emperor Leng could no longer worry about trivialities like these. She stared at the majestic luck that was piling up with a pair of crazed eyes.

Out of nowhere…

“Hm?” Emperor Leng frowned.

“That’s…” Xia Yong’s expression abruptly shifted.

They detected a hint of a different sort of force within the flow of the majestic luck.

Not only was this development beyond their expectations, but they also noticed how special this force was.

“No! This isn’t right!” Gu King’s alarmed voice suddenly resounded.

“What’s wrong?” Jian Wushuang immediately asked. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“It’s not just the luck of the Tang Kingdom. There’s also a different kind of force. Since I can’t see the force, I believe it’s the natural power of all things in the universe. Moreover, there’s a lot of it, too many of it.” Gu King’s voice carried a hint of shock.

“Natural power?” Jian Wushuang was equally as stunned.

He appeared familiar with this so-called natural power.

Back when he just obtained the Heavenly Creation Skill in the Ancient World, he earned not only a technique but a secret skill as well. It was the Soul-devouring Secret Skill.

To him back then, the Soul-devouring Secret Skill was a skill that defied the natural order. It was used to absorb the natural power of all things in the universe.

He had depended on this skill to survive many perilous situations in the Ancient World.

Unfortunately, the skill lost a lot of its use to him after he arrived in the Eternal World.

Up in the Void, Emperor Leng and Xia Yong had already noticed that something was off. The former immediately cried, “National Master, what’s happening?”

“What’s happening? Huh! You’re only asking me now what’s happening when the situation has come to this?” Though there was a fire burning in the old soothsayer’s eyes, he was wearing an evil smile. “Emperor Leng, did you really think that the formation I prepared for you is one that gathers luck?”

“Keke! I’ll tell you honestly that the formation I prepared is one unique to my Blood Killing Sect, the Life-devouring Formation.”

“Life-devouring Formation?”

Shock swept the many Dao Masters on the battlefield.

Even if most of them had no idea what the formation was capable of, they could tell just from the name alone that it would not be anything good.

“I understand… I understand it all.” Gu King’s voice reverberated in Jian Wushuang’s heart. “I did wonder why he would have the Blood-killing Plate Armor. So he’s a member of the Blood Killing Sect!”

“Blood Killing Sect?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“It’s a nefarious sect that is a near-universal enemy. Each of its members is undoubtedly a Great Demon. They know many evil formations and the Soul-devouring Formation is one of them,” Gu King explained.

“The formation could forcefully refine all the natural power within its scope. It targets not only the natural power of the earth; it encompasses flora, fauna, and even humans. Everything that has vitality will be forcefully refined.”

“If this formation has really enveloped the entire Tang Kingdom, then this is truly the end. The Tang Kingdom is over!”

“There is not even the smallest room for struggle. Not only will the country be reduced into a dead land, but every cultivator within the scope of the formation will also die after being wrung dry.”

Jian Wushuang was startled. “What are you saying?”

The entire Tang Kingdom will be reduced into a dead land? Everyone would be wrung dry?

“Don’t doubt my words. The formation of the Blood Killing Sect is this evil. It doesn’t take much for them to refine the energy of a sole kingdom,” Gu King said.

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened significantly after hearing his words.

Emperor Leng’s face was incredibly warped. “National Master, you lied to me?”

“Keke! I didn’t lie to you. The formation can indeed gather all the luck of the Tang Kingdom but that’s not all that it will gather,” the old soothsayer said with a manic laugh.

“Don’t forget that there’s a restriction that I left in your body. Aren’t you worried that I’ll trigger the restriction and kill you?” Emperor Leng asked coldly.

“Restriction? Oh, I would’ve forgotten about it if you didn’t remind me.”

“I was heavily injured when I first met you. My strength was at its lowest, so bad that my Blood-killing Plate Armor was in a fairly battered state. Back then, I was so weak that I could only run with my tails between my legs in a confrontation with an ordinary Dao Master. Naturally, I needed an aid to help me find some natural treasures as well as 99,999 newborns for my recovery.”

“That was why I would especially look for you,” the old soothsayer said, looking at Emperor Leng with a cold glint in his eyes.

Emperor Leng was stupefied.

“99,999 newborns?”

The many experts present looked at Emperor Leng in shocked anger.

There was indeed a period of time many years ago where many newborns were kidnapped in the 36 prefectures of the Tang Kingdom of the East, which led to a great commotion. The Tang royal family had personally investigated the manner but ultimately found no clues.

Later on, fewer and fewer cases of kidnapped newborns cropped up until it eventually disappeared. No one knew what became of the incident.

It was only now that they discovered that Emperor Leng was behind the many cases of kidnapped babies!
