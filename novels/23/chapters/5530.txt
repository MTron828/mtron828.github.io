Chapter 5529 ¬†Destroy!

"None of your business. Leave now!" Jian Wushuang glanced at the Emperors seated on both sides of the hall and spoke, "Otherwise, don't blame me if you get hurt later!"

As the terrifying Destruction Origin Source unfolded, chaos ensued among the crowd.

Without waiting for him to finish, they all hurriedly left.

It's one thing to watch a spectacle, but being accidentally harmed is another matter.

Tie San's face changed. He hadn't expected Jian Wushuang to obtain the Universe Origin Source, and it was the Destruction Origin Source. If it exploded in this hall, he would undoubtedly be seriously injured.

"Jian Wushuang, you're now a prisoner. I can freely take action against you. It's best for you to be sensible and leave now. I'll pretend nothing happened!" Tie San extended his hand, speaking with a sense of righteousness.

This was because the power of the Destruction Origin Source was too terrifying. If they really fought, both he and Jian Wushuang would have an unfavorable outcome. T/his chapter is updatùìÆd by nùíêv(√™(l)biin.co/m

Jian Wushuang, being an Inheritor with Zhen Ling as a safeguard, wouldn't fall easily.

Tie San was different. If he went all out and Jian Wushuang killed him, the Zhen Ling wouldn't obliterate Jian Wushuang just for an elder.

On the contrary, if he killed Jian Wushuang, it might provoke the wrath of Zhen Ling.

Next to him, Gong Miaoyi's expression was somewhat tense.

For a moment, she couldn't tell if Jian Wushuang's words were genuine or not, and a trace of emotion appeared in her heart.

At this moment, Si Tian only wanted to leave, but a force kept restraining him, preventing him from moving.

The owner of this force was naturally Wu Zuo.

Jian Wushuang had explicitly stated that Si Tian must die.

The Beast God Weapon must be seized.

This was an excellent opportunity.

Jian Wushuang's eyes revealed immense killing intent.

"Tie San, you old dog, prepare to die!" His entire Thought power erupted instantly, and the Destruction Origin Source shot out with a resounding hum.

Tie San in the hall certainly wouldn't wait for death; he grabbed Gong Miaoyi and attempted to flee.

Now was not the time for a head-on confrontation.

"Escape!" Tie San had only one thought.

Si Tian was in a pitiful state, completely immobilized and suppressed, desperately shouting, "Save me!"

In the midst of this crisis, Tie San didn't care about Si Tian's fate; he just wanted to leave as quickly as possible.

"Everyone must die!" Jian Wushuang declared, and the Candle Dragon Wings instantly enveloped his entire body. At the same time, Wu Zuo stood in front of him.

"Don't resist; I'll make my move after a breath!"

After Wu Zuo transmitted his message, a powerful force enveloped Jian Wushuang.

Without his protection, Jian Wushuang at the core of the Destruction Origin Source would also perish.

Boom!!!

The Destruction Origin Source completely exploded, reducing the entire Longevity Hall to rubble. Then, an immense aura began to gather, forming a singular point.

It was a black hole.

This Destruction Origin Source condensed the continent where Longevity Hall stood into a black hole. The tremendous force of engulfment devoured the entire continent.

Tie San struggled within it, futilely attempting to break free. In the end, he abandoned Gong Miaoyi, attempting to escape alone, but Jian Wushuang had already charged forward.

"Not so fast!" Jian Wushuang descended, first grabbing Gong Miaoyi, then holding her hand to block Tie San in his tracks.

Looking down at the opponent, the Hall Master of Longevity Hall, once towering above all, now resembled a beaten dog.

"Jian Wushuang, I want you dead!" Tie San was thoroughly enraged, rushing towards Jian Wushuang without caring for his own safety.

Though already heavily injured, Tie San exerted all his strength from the start, even burning his Origin Source to restore his power to its peak.

"God-Destroying Palm Strike!" Tie San's peak skill, the inexhaustible God-Destroying Technique.

With a palm strike, the God-Destroying Technique instantly activated, and the Thought power around Jian Wushuang began to weaken, making it impossible to sense his location.

Once the Thought power disappeared, a cultivator became like a blind person.

In the core of the distant black hole, Wu Zuo held Emperor Si Tian.

At this moment, Si Tian pleaded, "Lord Wu Zuo, save me!"

"Save you?" Wu Zuo sneered, forcibly taking the Beast God Weapon from him, then throwing Emperor Si Tian into the vortex of the black hole.

Emperor Si Tian was full of resentment as he roared, "No!!!"

He was unwilling!

All the way, he had a harder journey than anyone else. In the Original Planet, to protect the Beast God Weapon, he provoked Jian Wushuang.

Arriving at the Grave God Mountain, he was bullied by other Inheritors. Now, after painstakingly climbing to this position step by step, how could he accept such a downfall?

But the enormous gravitational force behind the black hole annihilated his mind, and his flesh turned into countless particles, settling into sediment.

On the surface of the black hole, however, there was still the grim expression of Si Tian, now a misty mass...

After dealing with Emperor Si Tian, Wu Zuo took a step forward, reaching the core of the black hole.

"Jian Wushuang, do you need my help?"

Now that Jian Wushuang had lost his Thought power and could only hear voices, he also had a fierce determination at this moment, shouting, "I can handle it!"

According to the plan, it was supposed to be Wu Zuo dealing with Tie San, and Jian Wushuang taking care of Si Tian.

But now, it had turned the other way around.

The mighty Wu Zuo went to kill the weakest Si Tian, while Jian Wushuang chose to tackle the toughest challenge.

"Found you!" A slight smile played on Jian Wushuang's lips.

Without Thought power, he still had Life power.

As long as there was a breath of life, he could sense it.

A massive palm imprint came crashing down, and Jian Wushuang slowly drew the Jueyun Sword strapped to his back.

At this moment, his temples were lifted, his robe danced with the pull of gravity, eyes tightly shut, yet he unsheathed the Jueyun Sword, preparing to unleash his most powerful strike.

Standing behind Jian Wushuang, Gong Miaoyi looked at him as if she saw her father in him.

Because her mother had told her that her father loved carrying a long sword on his back, and that was one of the reasons they came together.

But the thought of her father made her emotional.

If Tie San were to fall, what would happen to her father? Who would he turn to?

Could she depend on Jian Wushuang?

Although Jian Wushuang was ostensibly doing it for her now, she couldn't guarantee he would definitely help her.

What if Jian Wushuang used her again and then cast her aside?

At that time, because she caused Tie San's downfall, Palace Master Chang Feng wouldn't spare her either.

Her fate was bitter!

Gong Miaoyi's eyes were slightly moist, but she couldn't make any choices and could only be at the mercy of others!

However, at this moment, Jian Wushuang's Jueyun Sword was pointed at the giant palm. Then, he turned back to look at Gong Miaoyi, and said with tenderness, "Don't worry, I can help you with your father's matter too!"

As these shameless words were spoken, Jian Wushuang instantly made his move.

"Eternal Calamity!"

The Jueyun Sword emitted a buzzing sound, a transformation of the power of Life.

Overwhelming Sword Intent descended upon the world, and a single sword strike triggered a resonance throughout the entire space!

Just the aura emanating from Jian Wushuang instantly dispersed the God-Destroying Technique, followed by a furious shout, 'Annihilation!'"
