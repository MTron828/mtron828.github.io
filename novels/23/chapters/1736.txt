Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Boom!

All of a sudden, the void in front of Jian Wushuang split open and a black-robed figure came out of it. The black-robed figure then grinned hideously at Jian Wushuang and his whole right hand from the arm to finger was scarlet in color.

“Ghost’s Bloody Hand.”

With a swing of the bloody hand, the universe was torn open. The bloody hand was just like a crimson flittering light and its fierce, strong wind was sufficient to tear a Chaotic Real God into pieces easily.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were ice-cold and he moved with lightning speed. By shaking the Blood Mountain Sword in his hands slightly, a great amount of sword essence burst forth. After that, with a swing of the Blood Mountain Sword, the shocking sword shadow split into three and sliced the incoming giant bloody hand into three parts.

At the same time as he swung his sword, there were two brilliant rays of golden light beside Jian Wushuang. They were then shot out with one of them on his left and the other on his right.

Clang! Clang!

Two clashing sounds could be heard in the void and the two rays of golden light were sent flying. However, after becoming stable again, they continued to attack without any fear of death and with an even faster speed.

“Haha, these Golden Swords are not too bad. However, it’s a pity that the two of them are too little.”

A strange laughter could be heard in Jian Wushuang’s ears and the four figures sent the two Hong Jun Golden Swords flying easily. After that, their bodies approached Jian Wushuang quickly.

After an instant, they had already appeared beside Jian Wushuang. Among the four of them, one of them used bloody claws, one of them used a saber, one of them held a giant hammer and the last person used a strange hook. They then attacked at the same time.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

There were rays of light glowing. Their speed was so fast that it was shocking.

Jian Wushuang gave a cold hum and his body expanded into a dark golden Ancient God that was a hundred feet tall instantly. At the space between his eyebrows, there were six stars. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Moreover, his huge body also started to undergo a transformation immediately. Extra heads and brawny, dark golden arms appeared. He had a total of five heads and ten arms!

Five Heads, Ten Arms!

On the five heads, the five pairs of icy-cold eyes were filled with a great amount of anger. As for the ten arms, each of them held a sword tightly and an enormous amount of Divine Power was released abruptly.

“Piss off!”

Swords that were filled with a tremendous amount of sword essence were swung out repeatedly, as though the world would be destroyed and judgement was being passed. His attack then clashed with the incoming four attacks that were moving quickly head-on.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! ~~~

Frightening booming sounds could be heard repeatedly. Every booming sound was accompanied with frightening Divine Power dissipating and this caused the dark storm which it touched to be on the verge of collapsing. A great number of dark wind blades were blown about mercilessly and they would move to the battlefield from time to time.

However, one or two dark wind blades were not even considered a threat to those top Sir Gods present.

“Little kid, accept your death.”

With a furious roar, one of the black-robed men raised the big hammer in his hands fiercely and tremendous amount of power gathered. In an instant, it looked as though the whole universe was thrown toward him.

“What a joke.”

Jian Wushuang was filled with evil energy. He then moved his five heads and ten arms madly in order to unleash his close-quarters combat abilities to the best of his abilities.

At the same time, under the control of Jian Wushuang’s Soul Power, the two Hong Jun Golden Swords attacked crazily.

Although all the four surrounding Sir Gods possessed shocking abilities and they could exert a huge pressure on Jian Wushuang when they teamed up, Jian Wushuang could remain undefeated for a short amount of time by relying on the perfect combination of his close-quarters combat abilities and Hong Jun Golden Swords.

“This little kid. His close quarter combat abilities are so frightening. With the four of us teaming up, we can only push him back slightly? Moreover, it is a situation where we have a huge advantage in our comprehension of Doctrines.”

“It’s very normal. He possesses the Ancient God Bloodline and Ancient Gods are recognized by the Eternal Chaotic World as the number one in close-quarters combat.”

“Haha, it will only be interesting like this and it will also be more fun.”

All the eyes of the four Sir Gods were scorching-hot and they were filled with excitement. Jian Wushuang’s powerful abilities had given them more stimulus instead.

At the same time, the abilities of the four were unleashed gradually and Jian Wushuang was under an even greater amount of pressure.

At the same time that Jian Wushuang was fighting intensely with the four Sir Gods, a threatening cold essence came from behind Jian Wushuang abruptly.

Jian Wushuang understood at once that the assassin, Mo Ying, who had been hiding herself in the darkness, had attacked.

“King of Venomous Worms!” Jian Wushuang bellowed.

“Leave it to me!” a deep voice echoed in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

A black hole had appeared at the void behind Jian Wushuang and a ghost-like figure had come out of it.

Just like before, her hand held a dagger and the dazzling gleam of the dagger appeared abruptly. At that moment, the dagger attacked. Be it the time where she attacked or the way she attacked, both of them were perfect.

As Jian Wushuang was besieged by the four Sir Gods, even though he had five heads and ten arms, he was still unable to block the attack.

However, all of a sudden… the muscle on the back of his huge, dark golden Ancient God body wriggled downward. After that, rustle~~~ A total of three hideous, dark red tentacles appeared abruptly.

The three tentacles were like three dark red flittering lights and they pierced the void easily. After that, they struck the incoming dagger with lightning speed.

The dagger was extremely sharp and cold. Moreover, it was also extremely powerful. Hence, it pierced more than half of the tentacles instantly. However, with the great amount of strength that the tentacles contained, the ugly-looking woman Mo Ying was sent flying.

Straight away after that, rustle, rustle, rustle~~~ The surface of Jian Wushuang’s Ancient God body wriggled crazily and a hideous worm beast came out of it.

As soon as it appeared, the worm beast’s body started to expand madly with an unbelievable speed. Thousands of feet long, tens of thousands of feet long, hundreds of thousands of feet long… in the end, it was more than a million feet long.

With the appearance of the frightening worm beast within the dark storm, the dark storm almost burst open.

Its gigantic, vast body was filled with red scales. It was also emitting extremely cold light. In addition, brawny and hideous tentacles were coming out from beside the scales.

There were so many of them that it was uncountable. By looking at it, there were probably more than tens of thousands of tentacles.

At the highest point of the red body, there was a huge, dark red head. The head only had a pair of scarlet eyes that were of the size of the sun. Moreover, there was also a large, fierce-looking mouth that had opened.

A frightening aura was released from the King of Venomous Worms’ body.

Upon seeing the huge monster in front of them, even the five Sir Gods present revealed a shocked expression.

However, Jian Wushuang understood that the body was still not the peak condition of the King of Venomous Worms. At its peak, its body could act as a giant island when it was curled up.

“King of Venomous Worms, why do you have so many tentacles now?” Jian Wushuang’s hundred-foot tall Ancient God body was standing at the top of the King of Venomous Worms’ head. When he looked at the surroundings, he revealed a surprised expression.

According to what he knew, the King of Venomous Worms was a Plenilune Centipede and he should only have thousands of tentacles. However, at present, he had brought out tens of thousands of tentacles.

“Haha. Jian Wushuang, this is all thanks to you. As you are an Inverse Cultivator as well as a Royal Ancient God, my bloodline has been affected as well.”

“After the transformation this time around, I have transformed into a supreme Full-foot Plenilune of the Plenilune Clan.”
