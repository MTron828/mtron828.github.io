Chapter 662: Jian Wushuang’s Pride

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

There were 13 Palace Masters and plenty of Vice Palace Masters in the Dao Palace. They would occasionally gather together. Right now, four Palace Masters had gathered in a pavilion to drink. Among them was Feng’s Master, Palace Master Destruction. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Destruction, how’s your new personal disciple, Feng?” A Palace Master asked casually.

“Not bad. Although his talent is only average among my personal disciples, he’s perseverant and has a stable foundation. As long as he’s taught step by step in the future, he’ll be able to make good progress. He’s even got a good chance of reaching the Eternal Realm,” Palace Master Destruction said and laughed.

“Congratulations! You’ve accepted another good disciple.”

“Among the six men Palace Master Xuan Yi brought back from the Firmament Territory Feast, Feng seems to be the best. The others are just ordinary and that Jian Wushuang... He’s too disappointing,” a black-clothed lady said, shaking her head slightly.

“Jian Wushuang?”

Hearing that, all the Palace Masters looked at each other speechlessly.

Two months ago, when they heard from Xuan Yi that Jian Wushuang had cultivated for less than 40 years and came from the Ancient World, they were astonished at Jian Wushuang’s talent.

Had they been good at the type of Dao which Jian Wushuang mediated on, they would have chosen him as a personal disciple.

However, their impression of Jian Wushuang had been ruined to some extent during the past two months.

“He should have had a wonderful prospect. Unfortunately, he’s too conceited and proud.”

The black-clothed lady said, “Even though he’s talented, he came from the Ancient World and his vision is too narrow. He has no idea how to develop himself in the future. What’s most important for him now is to look for a good Master. With a Master’s guidance and the cultivation resources in the Ancient Sect, his talent can be fully developed!”

“It’s a pity that... he is too arrogant! ”

“During the past two months, many Vice Palace Masters who are good at World Dao or Slaughter Dao have talked with him and wanted to accept him as a disciple. Even Palace Master Baiyu and Mo Tao went to talk to him in person, but all of them were rejected by him!”

“Palace Master Baiyu will master the nine Occults of the World Dao soon!”

“Palace Master Mo Tao’s comprehension of the Slaughter Dao is beyond anyone in the whole Ancient Sect.”

“Jian Wushuang should feel lucky to be a disciple of either of them. How could he reject their offer?”

“Does he think that he’s so talented that he doesn’t need any guidance?”

Upon hearing this, the other three Palace Master nodded quietly.

“He’s indeed too proud!”

“He’s too young. Feng is different, he has cultivated for 1900 years and possesses a persistent and modest personality.”

“I heard that Jian Wushuang often been staying in front of the Sword Tower over the past two months to meditate on the three sword scars left by Xuan Yi. If I haven’t guessed wrong, he does intend to choose a Master, but his target is Xuan Yi.”

“Palace Master Xuan Yi?” The black-clothed lady sneered, “Xuan Yi is indeed strong. But one should choose an appropriate Master instead of a strong one. Xuan Yi’s comprehension of World Dao and Slaughter Dao isn’t comparable to that of Palace Master Baiyu and Mo Tao. He can teach Jian Wushuang Sword Principle at most.”

“In addition, is it so easy to be a disciple of Palace Master Xuan Yi?”

“The three sword scars left by Xuan Yi are so enigmatic that no one has been able to fully comprehend them so far. The first two sword scars alone are enough to make many Sword Principle geniuses ponder for hundreds of years. When he fully comprehends the first two swords scars, he’ll have already missed his best stage of growth. The loss outweighs the gain!”

“If I were him, I would definitely choose to be a disciple of Palace Master Baiyu or Mo Tao. Then I would take my time to meditate on the three sword scars and try to be a disciple of Palace Master Xuan Yi. After all, in Ancient Sect, it’s acceptable for a genius to be a disciple of two or more experts.”

Other Palace Masters nodded their assent.

“Who knows what he’s thinking?”

“Every genius is proud. Just wait, when the Sect Competition starts in two years, he certainly won’t be able to keep his position as an inner disciple. The competition among the outer disciples is more intense. After he suffers some setbacks and learns some lessons, he’ll naturally understand how foolish his choice was and then he’ll find a way to make amends.”

“Ah, what a pity. After all, he’s still a peerless genius.”

Lots of disciples who were good at Sword Principle had gathered in the Sword Palace. When Jian Wushuang showed up, he immediately received many strange stares.

“It has already been two months. Hasn’t Jian Wushuang chosen a Master yet?”

“Hey, he’s really stupid. Does he think he can be so disdainful because of his talent?”

“Without guidance from experts, he will have to cultivate by himself. Hmph, wait and see, he’ll learn a lesson in the Sect Competition two years from now.”

Many disciples lowered their voices while talking about him, but Jian Wushuang could still hear some of their voices clearly.

However, he did not pay attention to these discussions and went directly to the Sword Tower. He quickly arrived at the stone tablet with the three sword scars on it.

Sitting down in front of the stone tablet, Jian Wushuang sighed in relief and slowly calmed down.

“Two months have passed. Feng, Huo Ying, and even Bing Shan, Xuan Ying, and Wu Huang have chosen their Masters. I’m still cultivating alone without guidance from any experts. It’s no wonder these disciples in the Ancient Sect are gossiping about me in private.”

“I’m afraid that lots of people are saying I’m conceited,”?Jian Wushuang thought with a smile. He did not care about these things though.

“They aren’t me and don’t know what I’ve been through. How can they know what I’m thinking?”?Jian Wushuang thought.

He had made his decision the moment he entered the Ancient Sect and saw the three sword scars on the stone tablet.

He would definitely choose a Master!

A Master’s guidance would help him improve faster.

However, he had never had a Master since the day he was born. Perhaps the super expert who created the Heavenly Creation Skill could barely be counted as his Master, but he had never really kowtowed to any Master.

Therefore, he would not choose his first Master easily. His Master should be able to guide his cultivation and more importantly, his personality and strength had to make Jian Wushuang genuinely admire him.

In the whole Ancient Sect, only one man was qualified, and that person was the Palace Master of Sword Palace... Xuan Yi!
