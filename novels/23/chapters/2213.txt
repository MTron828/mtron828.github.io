Chapter 2214 The Changes in the Lineage of Stars.

Jian Wushuang returned the way he came. The various defensive mechanisms were not activated.Soon, Jian Wushuang was out of Chill Wind Valley.

“Sigh!”

Jian Wushuang heaved a deep sigh after he was back on the surface.

He looked back at Chill Wind Valley as he was still in shock after what he had seen.

He knew that the owner of the head, the bold man, definitely had many incredible secrets.

It was a pity that he was too weak to even have the right to know these secrets.

During the two thousand years that Jian Wushuang had been in the gigantic head, his overall fighting power had reached a completely new level and he was very pleased with it.

“Time to return,” JIan Wushuang muttered. He flipped out a transmission token.

Hall Master Yuan just transmitted a message.

“Hall Master Yuan, what’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s nothing major. However, if you are free, you should go back and visit the Lineage of Stars,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Roger,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

He then returned to the Green Fire World.

After Jian Wushuang moved the headquarters of the Lineage of Stars, it had been growing at an incredible rate given the excellent cultivating environment Green Fire World had.

Lineage of Stars had become even stronger and more powerful, even after many top tier experts had been dying during the battle against the Three Emperors World.

Thirty percent of the territory within the Green Fire World was occupied by the different clans from the Eternal Chaotic World. Because of Jian Wushuang, Lineage of Stars had managed to secure a bigger territory compared to the other clans.

A brilliant galaxy hovered in the air.

The galaxy had completely recovered due to the abundance in spiritual influence of heaven and earth. The galaxy was even more brilliant and vast than it had been before.

The power of the formation was even more powerful as well. Using special techniques, it could help out the disciples of the Lineage of Stars greatly.

Jian Wushuang appeared within the brilliant galaxy.

“It has been a long time since I was here at the Lineage of Stars,” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He usually remained within Wushuang city. He left the matters within the Lineage of Stars to Hall Master Yuan.

After the great battle, he had been in slumber for twenty four thousand years, before he had gone to Chill Wind Valley.

As Palace Master, Jian Wushuang had not come back to the Lineage of Stars for a very long time.

The changes within the Lineage of Stars after all these years were huge.

He could feel the difference when he stepped into the vast galaxy.

“The galaxy is completely different. The number of Meta Beasts born from the galaxy is far more than before. They also have a much greater effect on cultivators,” Jian Wushuang smiled as his soul power spread out and covered the entire galaxy.

He could sense that there were many Meta Beasts within the galaxy and they were very beneficial for the disciples when they cultivated. As of now, there were several disciples trying to capture the Meta Beasts.

Jian Wushuang smiled as he walked towards the interior of the galaxy.

Soon, he appeared within the headquarters of Lineage of Stars.

After he had returned to the headquarters, he realised there were far more experts and disciples than there had been before.

Both the numbers and quality of experts had increased greatly,

Within the Lineage of stars, the disciples were separated into three levels.

Everyone started as a normal disciple before they were promoted to core disciple. Finally, they would be promoted to disciples of Star Palace.

The number of disciples of Star Palace had increased as well. There were ten disciples of Star Palace for each level in the realm of Universe God. Every one of them was a top tier geniuses. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

For Phase Three Universe God, every single disciple of Star Palace was enlightened to the Power of Heaven Way.

While Jian Wushuang was still a disciple of Star Palace, it would be difficult to find other disciples of Star Palace who were also enlightened to the Power of Heaven Way.

It seemed it’s not as difficult for a Phase Three Universe God to be enlightened to the Power of Heaven Way now.

This was due to the cultivating environment.

After Jian Wushuang entered the headquarters of the Lineage of Stars, he roamed around within the Lineage of Stars instead of going to find Hall Master Yuan.

Soon, a battle between disciples caught his attention.

This battle occurred at one of the stars. The two people battling it out were both Phase Three Universe Gods. One of them was a disciple of Star Palace, while the other was just a core disciple.

This battle attracted the attention of many other disciples as they crowded around to watch. Jian Wushuang was within the crowd.

“Both Senior Brothers are very powerful!”

“Senior Brother Tian Yi and Senior Brother Chen Feng both are enlightened to The Power of Heaven Way. However, Senior Brother Chen Feng was enlightened for a long period of time. Furthermore, he is a disciple of the Star Palace and should be stronger. Look, Senior Brother Tian Yi is already suppressed.”

“Even though Senior Brother Tian Yi is a top tier core disciple, he still has work to do before he can beat Senior Brother Chen Feng.”

Jian Wushuang heard the surrounding chatter. He shook his head slightly and said, “Tian Yi’s sword skill is not so simple. He might win this battle.”

Jian Wushuang commented casually.

Jian Wushuang could see that Tian Yi had yet to use all his sword skills considering his battle experience and how much more powerful he was.

Right after he commented, several disciples looked over at Jian Wushuang.

“You think Senior Brother Chen Feng will lose? Are you kidding?”

“That’s right. Senior Brother Chen Feng is a disciple of the Star Palace.”

“Hey, who are you, why have I never seen you before? Furthermore, what do you mean when you say Senior Brother Chen Feng will lose to Senior Brother Tian Yi?” A teenage girl in purple clothes stared at Jian Wushuang.

JIan Wushuang was stunned.

Right then, Tian Yi finally used all his sword skills. It was swift and decisive as he immediately turned the battle around.

Within moments, he had defeated Chen Feng.

“He really won?”

The teenage girl in purple clothes was shocked as they had all expected Chen Feng to win.

In the arena, Chen Feng looked at Tian Yi, enraged. “Your sword skills...”

“Senior Brother Chen Feng. Hall Master He Xiu mentored me personally. That is why I had a breakthrough in my sword skills. Otherwise, there would be no way I could beat you,” Tian Yi said.
