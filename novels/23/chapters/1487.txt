Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Green Lightning Sect, in a lofty palace.

There were two figures sitting together. One was an elegant man with long purple hair while the other was an old lady in black robe.

“Elder Qiu, is there any update from Hall Master Yuan?” The elegant man with long purple hair asked.

“Yes,” the old lady in black robe answered, “Hall Master Yuan has already arranged for his disciple to come over.”

“Do you know who the disciple is?” The elegant man with long purple hair asked.

“No idea,” the lady in black robe shook her head, “However, with Ling Dan’s ability, among disciples of Lineage of Star, there should only be the two strongest, Long Ya and Xuan Yi, who are qualified to fight against him. Hall Master Yuan should have sent one of the two. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“I hope the one who came is Senior Long Ya. He’s number fifty-one on Universe God ranking list. If he were to take action personally, he could definitely defeat Ling Dan,” the elegant man with long purple hair said.

The old lady in a black robe creased her eyebrows slightly when she heard that.

She was the deacon elderly from Lineage of Star. She watched the fight between the elegant man with long purple hair and Ling Dan clearly.

She was the one who had determined that Xuan Yi had the fighting power of one on the top forty on Universe God ranking list.

From his point of view, even if Long Ya were to fight Ling Gan, he would be out of the running.

“I wonder where did Ling Dan popped out of. I’ve never heard of him previously. However, he is so strong,” the elegant man with long purple hair clenched his fists.

He had fought with Ling Dan but he was heavily defeated.

“There are countless experts in Eternal Chaotic World and there are many geniuses that aren’t famous but very strong. Ling Dan is just one of them. However, Ling Dan has the guts. How dare he use the disciple of Star Palace as his stepping stone,” the old lady in a black robe had rage in her eyes.

She really wanted to kill Ling Dan personally.

“Just you wait. When Hall Master Yuan was talking to me earlier, he sounded rather at ease. He should have a solution for this,” the old lady in black robe said.

In a few days time.

“Mm, he’s here!”

The old lady in a black robe and the elegant man with long purple hair who were waiting in the palace stood up simultaneously.

They already sensed the existence of the disciples token on the figure outside of Green Lightning Sect.

“It is the disciple token of disciple of Star Palace. It is definitely Senior Long Ya,” the elegant man with long purple hair exclaimed in surprise.

“Let’s go. Let’s go and greet him,” the old lady in black robe revealed a smile.

The two of them immediately got up and came outside of Green Lightning Sect very soon.

From afar, they saw a figure in a crimson robe who stood calmly in the void.

“Mm? Not Senior Long Ya?” The elegant man with long purple hair creased his eyebrows.

When the two of them got closer, they finally get to see the face of the figure in a crimson robe.

“Jian Wushuang?” The elegant man with long purple hair couldn’t help but gasp in surprise.

“It’s him?” The old lady in black robe was extremely shocked.

They originally thought it would be the strongest among disciples of Star Palace, who was also the fifty-first on Universe God ranking list, Long Ya.

Even if it wasn’t, it should be Xuan Yi, who was eighty-second on Universe God ranking list.

But in the end, it was one who had no fame at all in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, one who was never listed on Universe God ranking list, one who had broken through and become Universe God in the Third Heaven. It was Jian Wushuang.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

The old lady in a black robe and the elegant man with long purple hair appeared before Jian Wushuang.

“Elder Qiu, Senior Hu Feng,” Jian Wushuang greeted them. He knew both of them.

“Jian Wushuang, Hall Master Yuan sent you?” The old lady in a black robe, Elder Qiu asked.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang smiled as he nodded.

“Just you alone? Senior Long Ya or Senior Xuan Yi isn’t here together?” The elegant man with long purple hair, Hu Feng, asked in a deep voice.

“Just me alone,” Jian Wushuang was still smiling.

“Hall Master Yuan is joking, right?” Hu Feng’s face grew grave, “Ling Dan is so powerful and he could definitely be listed on Universe God ranking list. He might even be quite high up in Universe God ranking list. If I am not his match, you have no chance, Jian Wushuang.”

“Since when did Hall Master Yuan not worry much about Lineage of Star’s reputation?”

“Senior Hu Feng,” Jian Wushuang’s face grew dim and unhappy, “Hall Master Yuan is one of the three hall masters in Lineage of Star. How could he not bother about Lineage of Star’s reputation? As he sent me, he naturally has his own intentions.”

“What intentions? Could it be that you could really defeat Ling Dan? Forget about Ling Dan, I’m afraid you won’t even stand a chance against me!” Hu Feng stared at Jian Wushuang.

“How will you know if you don’t try?” Jian Wushuang stole a glance at Hu Feng.

“Alright,” Elder Qiu finally spoke, “I believe in Hall Master Yuan. However, Ling Dan is really strong. From what I can see, he could be listed in the top forty on Universe God ranking list. Jian Wushuang, are you really confident?”

“Yeah,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“That’s great. We’ll look for Ling Dan now. How about that?” Elder Qiu said.

“Okay,” Jian Wushuang immediately agreed.

Immediately, Elder Qiu brought Jian Wushuang towards where Ling Dan was.

As for Hu Feng, although he didn’t believe that Jian Wushuang could fight evenly with Ling Dan, he followed as well.

Heavenly Fire Summit, where Green Lightning Sect fought against the disciple of Seven Planet Palace. After Ling Dan defeated Hu Feng, he stayed back at Heavenly Fire Summit and waited for the other disciples of Lineage of Star to come forth.

When Jian Wushuang came near to Heavenly Fire Summit, his Soul Power instantly sensed the existence of countless cultivators’ aura.

The number of cultivators gathered around Heavenly Fire Summit just then was definitely more than a million people.

“Why are there so many people?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

“A bunch of people are here to enjoy the excitement. They came because Ling Dan intentionally spread news to attract them,” Elder Qiu said, “Because he attracted a large crowd, we of Lineage of Star didn’t dare to flagrantly take action. Otherwise, Ling Dan would have died over and over again. However, he wouldn’t be happy for too long. When this is solved, Lineage of Star will keep watch of him. We will kill him with our own hands once we get the chance to.”

Hearing that, Jian Wushuang complimented in silence. He could feel the murderous intentions of Elder Qiu.

“Merely to gain fame and be listed on Universe God ranking list, he could have challenged whichever experts on Universe God ranking list. Of all things, he decided to tease Lineage of Star and provoke us flagrantly. This Ling Dan is so irrational. Or maybe, his provocation isn’t simply just to gain fame?” Jian Wushuang muttered.

“Who knows?” Elder Qiu pouted.

“Regardless, let’s go and meet him.”

With a smile on his face, Jian Wushuang’s figure plunged towards Heavenly Fire Summit.

“Ling Dan!”

A low bellow was heard from Jian Wushuang and it reverberated through the universe.
