Chapter 2579: Star Picking Pavilion

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In a magnificent palace within the Territorial Lord Mansion.

Jian Wushuang sat on a highly elevated throne with Xiao Tiexin standing beside him while the four Official Army commanders stood below him.

There were ten commanders in the Official Army, but the other six had been specially arranged to be sent away from the Northern Darkstar Territory by the Situ Clan and were unable to appear in front of Jian Wushuang at that instance.

Coincidentally, Jian Wushuang had met two of the four commanders in front of him before.

They were the two commanders who had invited Jian Wushuang to join the Official Army at the Shi Clan Gladiatorial Arena but were curtly rejected. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The two commanders thought that Jian Wushuang was ignorant back then. However, after...the two commanders learned that Jian Wushuang had killed San Shouwang—their heart fluttering like rogue waves at sea and stood petrified before Jian Wushuang.

They two had never thought that Jian Wushuang could make such great improvements.

In merely a few years, he was able to behead San Shouwang and took over his position as Northern Darkstar Territory’s strongest expert, and also became the Territorial Lord.

“Everyone. Although I’m now seated here, I haven’t really become the Territorial Lord so all of you need not be so tensed up when facing me.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Even though he said so, the four commanders below him remained obsequious.

Jian Wushuang was helpless before stretching out his finger and pointed at one of the commanders. “What’s your name?”

“Master, I’m Cang Heng—the Official Army’s Seventh Commander,” answered the burly commander.

“You mentioned earlier in the Combat Ring that I have to go through some necessary procedures to become the Territorial Lord. Can you explain further about that?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Master, wildernesses are the smallest territory in the Ancient God Domain. A stellar region is formed from many of these wildernesses combined. The Territorial Lord which controls the stellar region would naturally control the many wildernesses within. Likewise, many stellar regions combined to form a domain. Northern Darkstar Territory belongs to the control range of the Danyang Holy Domain which is under the control of the Crimson Stone Fort!” Cang Heng explained in great detail.

“Crimson Stone Fort has enforced different sets of rules for every stellar region within the Danyang Holy Domain which has been around for many years. The Official Army rules are also set by Crimson Stone Fort. It’s mentioned that whenever a new Territorial Lord steps up, it must be reported to the Crimson Stone Fort for them to make the final decision.

“Going by usual means, one would challenge the incumbent Territorial Lord after passing some tests from the Official Army and when the Territorial Lord is defeated, that person will naturally succeed in the position as the new Territorial Lord. All we have to do then is to inform Crimson Stone Fort of the news.

“On the other hand, if one uses other methods rather than the usual path to defeat or kill the incumbent Territorial Lord, then Crimson Stone Fort will take this matter seriously. Under normal circumstances, an inspector will be sent to inspect the situation and appoint a new Territorial Lord!

“Like your case, Master. Although you’ve killed the Territorial Lord in a one-on-one battle, it was not through the usual method. An inspector will probably be sent here to determine if you’re qualified to become the Territorial Lord once we explain the current situation to Crimson Stone Fort.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

He understood that a Territorial Lord was the ruler of a huge territory and if he did not possess the capabilities to put everything under control, the territory would be in a mess. It was no wonder the Crimson Stone Fort took the selection seriously.

‘Crimson Stone Fort. The Crimson Stone Fort’s ruler should be Su’er—daughter of Crimson Stone Saint, right?’ Jian Wushuang smiled in his heart.

In Saint’s Tomb, he promised Crimson Stone Saint that he would offer Su’er and Crimson Stone Fort help if there was an opportunity.

However, his strength at that time was still too weak to make a difference and would not be of much help at all. He had no choice but to think about offering his help only when he was sufficiently strong to do so.

“Cang Heng, you may report the matter now. How long does it usually take for the Crimson Stone Fort’s inspector to arrive?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I’m unsure of this. It takes two to three months at least. It might even take up to six months or a year, but it has never been more than a year. A territory cannot be without a leader for too long after all. I’m sure you do have to wait too long, Master,” assured Cang Heng.

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly. “Oh, six months or up to a year isn’t too bad. By the way, have you heard of Star Picking Pavilion?”

“Star Picking Pavilion?” The four commanders were rather startled to hear that.

Cang Heng immediately stepped in and said, “Master, the Star Picking Pavilion is an extremely large Chamber of Commerce. Its presence in the business industry isn’t only within our Danyang Holy Domain, but also covers the Nine Realms of Golden Crow. Therefore, it’s recognized as the first-ranked Chamber of Commerce. I can say that its strength and background is even stronger than the ruler of the Danyang Holy Domain, Crimson Stone Fort.”

“It’s that powerful?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

Danyang Holy Domain was just a realm.

The Nine Realms of Golden Crow were made up of nine realms.

The Star Picking Pavilion was indeed extraordinary to be labeled the first-ranked Chamber of Commerce in the Nine Realms of Golden Crow.

Jian Wushuang was certain that an Undying Saint might be managing the Star Picking Pavilion at that point, and they probably have more than one Undying Saint!

“The Star Picking Pavilion is indeed very strong with only a handful of forces in the entire Nine Realms of Golden Crow that are comparable to it. The only one I know of is the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion,” said Cang Heng.

“Dragon Phoenix Pavilion?” Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly. He had never heard of either the Star Picking Pavilion or the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion before.

The white-robed commander beneath him then took a step forward and said, “Master, you have come into contact with the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion before.”

“When was that?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

The white-robe commander asked, “Master, have you forgotten of the last opponent you faced in the Blood Gladiators Challenge at the arena?”

“Her?” Jian Wushuang recalled the final battle against a girl who displayed the Spear World and her amazingly powerful spear. “Could that girl be from the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion?”

“Yes, the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion only accepts elites as their disciples. The ones who can enter the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion are the cream of the crop. The Ancient Witch who fought against you and was defeated in battle is one of their disciples. She’s not as good as you,” said the white-robe commander.

“Luck was on my side on the day I defeated her.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. “Forget about the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion and let’s talk about the Star Picking Pavilion. San Shouwang told me that he has an older brother who’s the Golden Chief in the Star Picking Pavilion before passing away and seems to be quite influential. Have you ever heard about this person?”

“Golden Chief?” The commanders exchanged looks and immediately shook their heads.
