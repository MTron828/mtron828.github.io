Chapter 706: Blood Mark?

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“He made himself explode?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the haze of blood in astonishment.

“Little Brother Wushuang.” Gu Qiong and Gu Jing walked toward him.

“Little Brother Wushuang, you’re amazing. The outsider was very powerful. Even Gu Jing and I didn’t stand a chance against him, but you managed to kill him.” Gu Qiong looked surprised.

“I was lucky. He underestimated me, otherwise, I couldn’t have killed him,” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

It was the truth.

He had hidden most of his strength when he fought with Gong Chao, so Xue Guzi had underestimated him and was eager to kill him.

Although Xue Guzi was considered the weakest among the three superior Divine Realm experts from Cloud Sea Asgard, he was the Core Disciple and had various trump cards. Typically, it would not have been easy to kill him.

If Xue Guzi had taken advantage of his speed to launch an attack, Jian Wushuang would have been unable to find a chance to kill him.

Regrets were useless.

A wrong judgment had led his death.

“Gu Qiong, this little brother is...” Gu Jing looked at Jian Wushuang curiously.

“I’ve bumped into him on the road. He is Jian Wushuang from the Eighth Tribe,” Gu Qiong answered.

“The Eighth Tribe? Little Brother Wushuang, you haven’t yet made a breakthrough to the Divine Realm, right? And you also haven’t received baptism. It’s incredible that you were able to kill an outsider.” Gu Jing was full of praise.

“Haha, I thought that you had been separated from your family. Now, I know that you’ve come to train yourself by fighting those outsiders, right?” Gu Qiong said with a grin.

Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile and felt relieved. “Right, you’ve seen through me.”

It seemed that Gu Qiong had not suspected his identity although he had displayed battle strength which was inconsistent with his own realm.

For the Demon Gods, they only believed in Soul Aura, which was enough to prove Jian Wushuang’s identity.

There were many supreme geniuses in the Demon God Clan, so it was common to see some rank-skipping challenges.

At this juncture, Jian Wushuang sensed something amiss. He looked at his right arm and saw a cloud of blood fog creeping towards it. It eventually condensed into Blood Mark.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was shocked. “This is...”

Seeing this mark, Jian Wushuang eventually understood why Xue Guzi had made himself explode.

Xue Guzi wanted to leave a Blood Mark on his opponent so that the other disciples from Cloud Sea Asgard would be able to find him.

Jian Wushuang had seen it before in the Ancient World.

The Mark, like a lighthouse in the dark night, would guide his enemies to find him.

Previously, in the Ancient World, someone from the Holy Emperor Palace had left a similar mark on him. Since he had been unable to escape at the time, he had to fight to the death with the Second Holy Master.

Now he was in the same situation.

“Xue Guzi has practiced such a skill on purpose. It seems that he was prepared for it.” Jian Wushuang’s expression was frosty.

He realized that aside from Xue Guzi, the other nine disciples from the Cloud Sea Asgard might have mastered the Mark Skill.

“Little Brother Wushuang, what is this Blood Mark?” Gu Qiong asked when he noticed it on Jian Wushuang’s arm.

“The outsider left this mark on me so that the other outsiders would be able to find me,” Jian Wushuang responded solemnly.

“What?” Gu Qiong was astonished. “That means you’ll be targeted by the outsiders?”

“Right, but it’s just a few people.” Jian Wushuang replied as he fixed his eyes on the Blood Mark.

”?I wonder if my Heavenly Creation Skill can remove this mark,?” Jian Wushuang thought. He activated the Heavenly Creation Skill.

The Heavenly Creation Skill was incredibly powerful. It had been able to refine Leng Rushuang’s Icy Heart Poison, so it should be able to remove this mark.

However, the Mark was deep. Jian Wushuang estimated that it would take him three days to remove it.

The disciples from Cloud Sea Asgard would find him within that period of time. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

”?I’m in trouble,?” Jian Wushuang thought as his eyes narrowed.

Gu Qiong looked over at Jian Wushuang and said, “Little Brother Wushuang, don’t worry. This is our place, so we don’t need to be afraid of those outsiders.”

“Although most of our clansmen stay in the tribe, there have been a few fights with outsiders in this zone. If the outsiders find you, we’ll help you to kill them.”

“Right, our Demon Gods are stronger than the outsiders. And our Seventh Tribe has sent 15 squads here, which means we have 150 clansmen helping us, in addition to the clansmen from the Eighth Tribe. You don’t have to worry about the outsiders.”

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

“Right, I’m unable to fight against Wu Dao, Dao Mei, and the other disciple from Cloud Sea Asgard, but I’m now a clansman of Demon God Clan.”

“In the Eternal Zone, Demon Gods are the real masters. They’re the strongest.”

“Haha...”

Jian Wushuang could not help but laugh aloud. His eyes were filled with killing intent.

“Cloud Sea Asgard, since you want to kill me, I won’t make it easy on you.”

“This time, if I can’t set you up, I’m not Jian Wushuang!”
