Chapter 1629: Inheritance

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The Unique Skill Hall was dusky. At the end of Jian Wushuang’s line of vision, a lofty Ancient God shadow could be seen faintly.

The Ancient God shadow was more than a million feet tall and it was definitely the biggest Ancient God shadow that Jian Wushuang had ever seen. Moreover, even though it was a shadow, the aura that it released was stronger than a Seven-star Ancient God’s, like King Gu Yi or Gu Mei.

“What a large body and powerful aura. Could the owner of this Ancient God shadow be the Ancient God Emperor from the past?” Jian Wushuang exclaimed in admiration.

“It’s him,” the King of Venomous Worms nodded its head, “However, it is rumored that the body of the Ancient God Emperor is a lot larger than this shadow. Moreover, as the only emperor of the Ancient God Clan, he is the strongest expert. The Four Unique Skills and Three Secret Skills in the Ancient God Clan now had all been created by him.”

“Jian Wushuang, for the inheritance of the Unique Skills, under normal circumstances, the purer one’s Bloodline is, the easier it would be for the Unique Skills to be passed on to him. Since you are a Royal Ancient God, you should be able to inherit the Four Unique Skills completely within ten years’ time. However, you should do your best to not waste any time. Let’s begin.”

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head and sat down with his legs crossed immediately.

In no time, Memories of Inheritance appeared in his mind.

Jian Wushuang also did his best to absorb all the Memories of Inheritance.

Just like the Ancient Gods had said, with Jian Wushuang’s Royal Ancient God Bloodline, it would be very easy for him to inherit the Unique Skills.

The Four Unique Skills of the Ancient God Clan. From the Ancient God’s Finger at the start, to Universal Laws, to Nine Heads Eighteen Arms and finally Eight Divine Mountains.

The Four Unique Skills were passed on smoothly.

In the blink of an eye, eight years’ time passed.

Ling Shan had been waiting outside the Unique Skill Hall quietly.

At that very moment, the door of the Unique Skill Hall opened abruptly and Jian Wushuang walked out from it.

“You came out so quickly. Could it be that you have already fully inherited the Four Unique Skills?” Ling Shan said with surprise.

Jian Wushuang chuckled, “Lord Ling Shan, let’s go to the place of inheritance for the Secret Skills.”

Ling Shan did not ask too much and he brought Jian Wushuang to three black, ancient attics immediately.

“Gu Jian, the three attics that you are looking at now is the Lineage of Ancient Gods’ place of inheritance for the Three Secret Skills. After clearing the sixth level of the Star Moon Tower, you can inherit the Thunder Attracting Skill and Star Destruction Skill. However, you will not be able to inherit the Moon Picking Skill, which is the final Secret Skill,” Ling Shan said.

“Thunder Attracting Skill and Star Destruction Skill?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes squinted.

He had heard of the names of the Three Secret Skills from the King of Venomous Worms. However, he had never experienced how strong the Three Secret Skills were.

However, looking at it at that very moment, the Moon Picking Skill was probably the strongest among the Three Secret Skills.

“Jian Wushuang, it’s already considered not too bad for you to be able to inherit Two Secret Skills. As for the Moon Picking Skill, it is indeed the most frightening Secret Skill of the Ancient God Clan and it is known to be a very remarkable ability. Although you are unable to get it now, if there is an opportunity in the future, you can still think of a way to clear the seventh level of the Star Moon Tower. At that time, you will be able to obtain the right to inherit the Moon Picking Skill,” the King of Venomous Worms said.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

It would be great if he could obtain the Moon Picking Skill in the future. However, if he were unable to obtain it, he would also not be too concerned.

“The two attics on the left are the places to inherit the Thunder Attracting Skill and the Star Destruction Skill respectively. Similar to the Unique Skill Hall, you can stay in every attic for ten years. As for how many Memories of Inheritance you are able to obtain within ten years, it is entirely up to you. Go ahead,” Ling Shan waved his hands and said.

Jian Wushuang entered the first attic straight away.

This attic was the place used to pass on the Thunder Attracting Skill.

Jian Wushuang also started to inherit the Thunder Attracting Skill quickly.

During the process, Jian Wushuang slowly understood the Thunder Attracting Skill and the Star Destruction Skill.

The Thunder Attracting Skill was used to attract the Universal Sacred Thunder to kill one’s opponent forcefully.

It should be known that the attracted Universal Sacred Thunder could be either of the same variety as in the God’s Test, or the Life Destroying Thunder. Moreover, the stronger one’s abilities became, the more frightening the power of the attracted Divine Thunder would be.

If one’s abilities were to reach the level of King Luo Zhen’s, he would be able to attract hundreds upon hundreds of Life Destroying Thunders with earth-shaking power when he unleashed the Secret Skill with his full power.

This would definitely be an extremely frightening killing move.

As for the Star Destruction Skill, it was a Secret Skill which could allow one’s abilities to skyrocket for a short period of time.

However, this Secret Skill was a double-edged sword. Although it would make one powerful, there would be side effects to his body.

When used, it could break apart the Ancient God Star that was forming in the space between one’s eyebrows forcefully so that it would flow into the attacks of the user.

This Secret Skill would be best suited for a difficult battle. If used properly, the tides would be turned during a bad situation.

Of course, after the battle, the user’s abilities would be affected and it would require some time for it to recover. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

In all, for the Two Secret Skills, every one of them was unusually powerful and they were extremely useful to Ancient Gods.

Two attics and Two Secret Skills. If a normal Ancient God were to inherit the Two Secret Skills for twenty years, they might still be unable to inherit them completely. However, adding the time that Jian Wushuang had spent in both attics together, he only spent a total of eighteen years to obtain the complete Memories of Inheritance.

At that very moment, he had obtained both the Four Unique Skills and Two Secret Skills.

However, he had merely obtained them. If he wanted to use and also display their full power, he would need a lot of actual combat experience with them.

“Lord Ling Shan.”

Jian Wushuang appeared in front of Ling Shan, “For the next period of time, it’s alright for me to stay in the Ancient God Palace, right?”

“Of course,” Ling Shan nodded his head.

“Alright,” Jian Wushuang chuckled.

The Ancient God Palace had many powerful Ancient Gods and did not lack Six-star Ancient Gods either.

What Jian Wushuang lacked the most at that very moment was actual combat experience. Hence, the Six-star Ancient Gods in the Ancient God Palace were best suited to be his opponents.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang had relied on clearing the sixth level of the Star Moon Tower to enter the Ancient God Palace. Thus, his name had already spread through the whole of Gu King City, as well as the entire Ancient God Sanctuary a long time ago. With that, many Ancient Gods within the Ancient God Palace yearned to have a battle with him.

As such, Jian Wushuang did not need to challenge someone to a battle. By just walking around randomly in the Ancient God Palace, he would come across many Ancient Gods who were looking to battle him.

This was what Jian Wushuang hoped for.

For the next period of time, he would stay within the Ancient God Palace and battle against the Ancient Gods who came to challenge him.

The abilities of the Ancient Gods who came to challenge him were both weak and strong. The strongest was a Stage Two top Six-star Ancient God, while the weakest was a Stage One Ancient God. At the start, when Jian Wushuang fought them, he did his very best to not use techniques of human beings. He would not use the comprehension of the Reincarnation Doctrine and the Spacetime Doctrine. Instead, he would rely purely on his close-quarters combat skills and techniques of Ancient Gods to fight with them.

During the intense battles, he continued to train and familiarize himself with using the Ancient God Clan’s Four Unique Skills and Two Secret Skills.

While he was undergoing such training, time continued to pass by.
