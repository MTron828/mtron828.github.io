The reason why Jian Wushuang wanted to go back and break through to become a fifth stage Ruler was that once he broke through, not only would his divine power increase again, but more importantly, he might be able to use one-ten-millionth of the Tarot Divine Sword’s power!

At that time, even if he were to face the Ninth Kalpa King, who was a level higher than him in the Ruler realm, he was confident that he would be able to fight with all his might!

“Hmm…when I break through, I might need to borrow the power of the river of enlightenment.”

Jian Wushuang thought about the river spirit in the river of enlightenment and could not help but smile.

“I’m sure that Lord River Spirit’s expression will be very interesting when he sees me again.”

At this moment, Ninth Kalpa King, Jian Wushuang, and Divine Marquis Qingfeng did not say a word. They were all eager to return home.

Rumble!

After sixty years, the three of them finally arrived at the universe passage that led to the Divine Life Palace.

“Who are you?” The two Rulers in charge of guarding the gate saw the approaching universe boat and immediately became tense.

“It’s me.” The Ninth Kalpa King replied indifferently.

The three of them walked down from universe boat.

“Greetings, Ninth Kalpa King!”

The two Rulers relaxed when they saw this. They cupped their hands and said, “Ninth Kalpa King, Ruler Blood Wave, Supreme Giant Axe, and Supreme Gai Fu have received your message and asked us to wait here. They asked me to take you to supreme palace as soon as you arrived.”

“Oh? Why are you in such a hurry?”

Ninth Kalpa King, Jian Wushuang, and Divine Marquis Qingfeng could not help but look at each other in confusion.

Logically speaking, even if they were asked to report the remains’ situation, they would not be in such a hurry.

“Did something happen?” The Ninth Kalpa King said with a frown.

A hint of hesitation flashed through the eyes of the two Rulers guarding the door, but they still said softly in the end, “Your Excellency, Ninth Kalpa King, a hundred years ago, an honored guest came to the supreme shrine and is waiting for you.”

“What distinguished guest?” The Ninth Kalpa King’s face was filled with a touch of displeasure as he asked again.

The two Rulers took a deep breath and replied with grave expressions, “It’s the people from the Great Void Temple!”

“Great Void Temple?!”

In an instant, Ninth Kalpa King and Divine Marquis Qingfeng’s expressions changed slightly and they looked at Jian Wushuang in unison.

Jian Wushuang remained expressionless and asked, “They’re coming for me, right?”

The two Rulers could not help but bitterly smile and nod. “Yes.”

“Then let’s go and see what they want.” Jian Wushuang sneered in his heart.

He had already expected that the people from the Great Void Temple would come to find him.

He did not expect that the people from the Great Void Temple had not only come to find him, but had even come to the Divine Life Palace.

However, Jian Wushuang did not panic. This was the Divine Life Palace. The people from the Great Void Temple would not dare to do anything out of line.

“My Lords, shall we send a message now and take you to the supreme shrine?” The two Rulers asked.

The Ninth Kalpa King and the other two nodded upon hearing this. They even revealed a determined smile at Jian Wushuang, as if to say, ‘Don’t worry, we’ll take care of everything.’

A short while later, the three of them arrived at the Supreme shrine under the guidance of the two Rulers.

Within the temple.

Supreme Master Gai Fu sat at the head of the table, while Ruler Blood Wave and Supreme Giant Axe sat on either side of him.

Under the three of them, an old man with white hair and a white beard in a Taixu cloak sat cross-legged and sipped his tea.

This person was the seventh Hall Master of the Great Void Temple, the Vice Hall Master, Ruler Whitefloat! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Speaking of which, I would like to thank the three of you for your hospitality in the Divine Life Palace.” Ruler Whitefloat put down his teacup and smiled.

“Whitefloat, you’ve finished your tea. Shouldn’t you be leaving?” Ruler Blood Wave said with an unsightly expression.

“There’s no hurry. The person I’ve been waiting for hasn’t arrived yet. Ruler Whitefloat glanced at the Ruler Blood Wave and shook his head.

Pausing for a moment, the White floating Supreme martial artist continued, “Don’t worry. Once i’ve investigated the matter, I’ll naturally leave. I won’t stay for long. How can the Divine Life Palace be better than our Great Void Temple?”

“You!”

Ruler Blood Wave was enraged upon hearing this. ‘What kind of place did this Ruler Whitefloat think their Divine Life Palace was? Come and go as you please? Leave as he pleased?’

Just as he was about to flare up, Supreme martial artist Gai Fu, who was sitting at the head of the table, said, “Blood Wave, you are a guest. Don’t be rude.”

Supreme Giant Axe shook his head at him.

The Ruler Blood Wave expression wavered upon seeing this. In the end, he snorted coldly and fell silent.

Upon seeing this, the corners of Ruler Whitefloat’s mouth curled up slightly as he revealed a fearless expression.

Even though he was far weaker than Ruler Blood Wave, he was representing the Great Void Temple this time. He believed that the blood wave Ruler would not dare to do anything to him.

Pa da, pa da.

At this moment, hurried footsteps could be heard from outside. Soon after, the Ruler responsible for guarding the hall hurried in and clasped his hands. Supreme Master Gai Fu, Supreme Master Blood Wave, and Supreme Master Giant Axe, the Ninth Kalpa King has returned and are waiting outside the hall for announcement.

The pupils of the Ruler Blood Wave and the Supreme Giant Axe both shrank. As for the Ruler Whitefloat, he immediately stood up and laughed.

“Hahaha, the person I’ve been waiting for a hundred years has finally arrived!”

“Let them in,” Supreme martial artist Gai Fu nodded his head with a calm expression.

“Yes!”

The Ruler acknowledged and retreated.

Not long after, Jian Wushuang and the other two slowly walked in.

The Ninth Kalpa King stood in the middle, while Jian Wushuang and Divine Marquis Qingfeng walked on both sides. The three of them were expressionless.

“Supreme Master Gai Fu, Supreme Master Blood Wave, and Supreme Master Giant Axe.” The three of them cupped their hands.

“Yes, Ninth Kalpa King, Divine Marquis Qingfeng, please sit down.” Supreme martial artist Gai Fu nodded his head.

Then, he looked at Jian Wushuang and said, “Jian Wushuang, this is the Vice Hall Master of the seventh Hall of the Great Void Temple, Ruler Whitefloat. I called you over because Ruler Whitefloat has something to ask you. When Ruler Whitefloat asks you about it later, you must not hide anything. Do you understand?”

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang nodded and looked at Ruler Whitefloat. He cupped his hands and said, “Jian Wushuang greets Ruler Whitefloat.”

“You are Jian Wushuang? Hmph, let me ask you, in the Tarot Ruins, did you have a conflict with Qing Xuzi of the Great Void Temple?” Ruler Whitefloat squinted his eyes. He did not hold back and directly cut to the chase.

“I guess so.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head calmly.

The matter between him and Qing Xuzi was not a secret. Back in the Tarot Ruins, many people had seen Qing Xuzi chasing after him. Therefore, he had no intention of denying it.
