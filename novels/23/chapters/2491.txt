Chapter 2492: The Dust Settled

“This condition of yours...”

Yun Zhen pondered for a while and finally said, “I can promise you that after you leave Wusha Wilderness, I’ll assign experts to secretly protect your parents and make sure no harm would come to them. However, your Big Sister and Second Brother are both disciples of other sects. They are bound to train in the outside world and might even get involved with inter-sect fights. The Great Compassion Sect is unable to guarantee their safety!”

However, I promise you that I’ll warn those various sects’ experts that other than reasonable inter-sect fights, anyone who dares seek revenge on both of them due to their grudges toward you will become the Great Compassion Sect’s arch-enemy!”

Jian Wushuang was very satisfied with Yun Zhen’s answer and praised him in his mind upon hearing that.

“That’s all of my conditions since Lord Yun Zhen has agreed to them, I’ll bear no grudge against the Great Compassion Sect and shall not cause any more troubles,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Thank you. I shall have someone send over the instrument cultivation materials and three thousand pieces of Primordial Stones as soon as possible. I must bid you farewell for now as I still have many affairs to attend to,” said Yun Zhen.

“Farewell,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

Yun Zhen and the three Supreme Elders soon left.

As for those various sects’ experts, they looked at each other and felt there was nothing more they could do.

They would naturally dare not cross Jian Wushuang any further since even the Great Compassion Sect had bowed down. Many sects began to communicate with the Great Compassion Sect and discussed how they should be splitting the ‘3,000 pieces of Primordial Stones’ burden.

Other sects began to leave, but one sect stayed behind.

They approached Jian Wushuang.

“Wushuang, our young friend.”

A warm voice came from beside Jian Wushuang as a few figures appeared there. Among them were Elder Wujian, Elder Linghe, and the Seventh Elder whom Jian Wushuang was familiar.

However, the one leading them was a gentleman in a green robe who was also the Lord of Narcissus Island and an Ultimate God expert, Ling Gong!

“Ah, it’s the people from Narcissus Island. I wonder what’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang was expressionless as his voice turned even colder.

Ling Gong and the rest felt slightly awkward.

If not for their previous decisions, Jian Wushuang would have still been their disciple and called Ling Gong ‘My Lord’.

However...

“My young friend, what happened before was truly Narcissus Island’s fault for not handling it well, but it was necessary for us to make such decisions at that time. I came here in person today not to ask for your forgiveness and return to being our disciple once again. I only came to ask for you not to hold a grudge against Narcissus Island. That alone would be satisfactory. Please accept these presents that I personally prepared for you.” Ling Gong presented an Interspatial Ring to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang accepted and scanned it before nodding slightly.

There were many elixirs, natural treasures, and 500 Primordial Stones.

“Please don’t worry, gentlemen. I’m a person who remembers others’ good deeds. Other than expelling me, Narcissus Island did not wrong me in any way. I shall accept these presents and from here on, Narcissus Island and I’ll not have any relations let alone grudges. Please return safely.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

Ling Gong and the rest felt relieved.

Jian Wushuang looked at Wujian who stood behind. “Brother Wujian, it’s rare for you to come and visit me. Stay for a drink before you leave.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Well...” Wujian was a little hesitant and could not help but look at Ling Gong.

“Elder Wujian, it’s very kind of our young friend to invite you. Why don’t you stay awhile and drink with him?” Ling Gong said.

“Yes.” Wujian nodded.

“My young friend Wushuang, we shall take our leave since we’ve said all we wanted to,” said Ling Gong humbly.

“Be safe now.” Jian Wushuang’s tone sounded rather indifferent.

Those people from Narcissus Island left with the exception of Wujian.

Jian Wushuang held Wujian’s arm and went back to the Governor’s Mansion. Zhuo Yunfeng, Luo Xinqin, Zhuo Bing, and Zhuo Peng were relieved when they saw Jian Wushuang return safely.

They were constantly worried about Jian Wushuang’s safety.

After that, they threw a small banquet. Other than Jian Wushuang and his family, Wujian and the head of the Lin Family, Lin Tiefeng were both invited.

Everyone was happily drinking.

“Haha, you scared me to death Brother Wushuang! That was the Great Compassion Sect you were dealing with. Even Yun Zhen had personally shown up, but he still couldn’t do anything to you. He even accepted your conditions, tsk tsk... Of all the years I’ve been an Elder of Narcissus Island, I’ve never seen the Great Compassion Sect being so docile!” Wujian exclaimed at his seat.

If he had not witnessed it himself, he would not have believed the Lord of Great Compassion Sect would agree to Jian Wushuang’s ridiculous conditions.

Jian Wushuang only smiled faintly, “Haha, it isn’t the Great Compassion Sect being docile, they merely didn’t dare to show their tempers. That Yun Zhen was only testing my strength with his three palm strikes. In the end, he knew he couldn’t kill me. In addition to my obvious talents and potentials, I would’ve grown to a level I could annihilate the Great Compassion Sect with the flick of a finger in time. He bowed down because he had no choice.”

If he didn’t bow down, the Great Compassion Sect would’ve perished!”

“That’s true.” Wujian laughed.

Meanwhile, Zhuo Yunfeng and the others sigh in relief.

That was the Great Compassion Sect, the first-ranked sect of Wusha Wilderness. For Zhuo Yunfeng’s son to have the potential to destroy the Great Compassion Sect which forced them to bow down, such abilities were just...

Zhuo Yunfeng was just incredibly proud of his son.

“Oh yes, Brother Wujian. As I was talking to Yun Zhen, Lei Chong mentioned the Great Compassion Sect would offer the Territorial Lord a thousand Primordial Stones every millennium. Who exactly is this ‘Territorial Lord’?” Jian Wushuang asked.

The Great Compassion Sect was the dominant sect of Wusha Wilderness, but they still had to offer 1,000 pieces of Primordial Stones to the Territorial Lord every millennium.

Jian Wushuang got curious about the Territorial Lord’s identity.

Wujian’s expression turned serious. “Territorial Lord... I know about this Territorial Lord and what Lei Chong said is true.”

“Not only Great Compassion Sect but every sect in Wusha Wilderness would also have to offer a certain number of Primordial Stones every millennium including Narcissus Island. The Great Compassion Sect would gather the stones and send them to the Territorial Lord. As for his true identity, he’s the Lord of Northern Darkstar Territory.”

“Northern Darkstar Territory?” Jian Wushuang was intrigued.

The Northern Darkstar Territory was a place he read about from one of the records.
