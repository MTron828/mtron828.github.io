Chapter 2899: Purpose

——

Looking at the ancient scroll taken out by Bone Emperor, Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted.

He was very familiar with this ancient scroll because there were two such scrolls in his interspatial ring.

Undoubtedly, what Bone Emperor took out was also a scroll of heaven-sealing painting.

“The third one!”

Jian Wushuang immediately became excited.

This was normal. As Bone Emperor said, the more heaven-sealing painting scrolls there were, the more benefits he would get.

During this time, his comprehension of sword principles and rules had improved so quickly. Besides his extraordinary talent, the most important thing was that he had the help of two heaven-sealing painting scrolls, these two heaven-sealing painting scrolls had helped him a lot.

Both of them had helped him a lot. As for the third one… it was rumored that gathering three heaven-sealing painting scrolls at once was enough to obtain an extraordinary opportunity.

Jian Wushuang was filled with anticipation and curiosity about this opportunity.

Now, the third heaven-sealing painting scroll appeared in front of him.

Although he was pleasantly surprised, Jian Wushuang remained calm on the surface.

“I didn’t expect Lord Bone Emperor to have a scroll of the heaven-sealing painting,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Why? Are you interested in the scroll?” Bone Emperor smiled and said, “If you want it, I can give it to you.”

“As you said, the more scrolls you have, the more benefits you will get. I’ve benefited a lot from the scroll over the years. Now that I have a chance to get the second scroll, I can’t miss it. But what are your conditions, Lord Bone Emperor?” Jian Wushuang said.

He knew that Bone Emperor would not give him the heaven-sealing map scroll for no reason. There must be a price to pay.

He was just curious about what kind of request Bone Emperor would make.

“The heaven-sealing map scroll is of no use to me. Since you need it, I can give it to you now. As for the conditions, I do have one, but it should be a piece of cake for you,” Bone Emperor said.

“Tell me.” Jian Wushuang looked at Bone Emperor.

“Jian Yi, have you heard of the heaven-cleaving alliance?” Bone Emperor asked directly.

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Of course, he had heard of the heaven-cleaving alliance.

He had also heard of the existence of the heaven-cleaving union through Saint Crimson Rock.

Saint Crimson Rock had given him a heaven-cleaving token back then.

Now, the Bone Emperor had mentioned the heaven-cleaving alliance to him…

“You should know about it. If I’m not mistaken, it must have been the Crimson Rock Saint who told you about it, right?” Bone Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang.

“How do you know about it, Bone Emperor?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Of course, I knew it long ago. Not only does crimson rock have a heaven-sealing map scroll, but he also obtained a heaven-cleaving token by chance. Because he came to me with this token, he wanted to give it to me in exchange for what he needed. Unfortunately, I didn’t agree,” Bone Emperor said.

“Why? Is it because Saint Crimson Rock’s requirements are too high, or are you not interested in the heaven-cleaving alliance, Lord Bone Emperor?” Jian Wushuang asked.

The heaven-cleaving alliance was a giant. Although the conditions for joining were extremely harsh, it would definitely bring many benefits.

In the divine beginning realm, many powerful experts yearned to join the heaven-cleaving alliance. However, Lord Bone Emperor was so powerful that if he could get a heaven-cleaving token, he could definitely try to enter the heaven-cleaving alliance.

After hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, the Bone Emperor gave a mischievous smile, “It’s not that Saint Crimson Rock is too demanding, nor that I’m not interested in the heaven-cleaving alliance. It’s because when Saint Crimson Rock gave me the heaven-cleaving token, I was already an earth-level member of the heaven-cleaving alliance.”

“What?” Jian Wushuang was shocked, but then he understood.

No wonder the Bone Emperor rejected Saint Crimson Rock. It turned out that he had been a member of the heaven-cleaving alliance for a long time.

Since he had joined the heaven-cleaving alliance, why did he need the heaven-cleaving token?

“The heaven-cleaving alliance is indeed an unfathomable force. Its strength is far beyond the imagination of ordinary experts. Even now, I only have a glimpse of the heaven-cleaving alliance. But one thing is that after joining the heaven-cleaving alliance, I have indeed gained great benefits. Even if I can perfectly control the immortal body and impress the current level, it has something to do with the heaven-cleaving alliance!” Bone Emperor sighed.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

He yearned for the mysterious and powerful heaven-cleaving alliance.

“Jian Yi, do you also have the heaven-cleaving token?” Bone Emperor asked.

“Yes, I do.” Jian Wushuang did not deny it.

The Bone Emperor smiled. “Saint Crimson Rock should have told you about the heaven-cleaving alliance. You are very talented, and you have the heaven-cleaving token. If you want to join the heaven-cleaving alliance, it should be easy. It should be difficult for you to pass the test.”

“Maybe.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

He had heard from Saint Crimson Rock that the minimum requirement of the heaven-cleaving alliance was Divine Master.

Moreover, it was an Invincible Divine Master who was extremely strong and had already reached the top.

In other words, Invincible Divine Master was only qualified to accept the assessment, but whether he could pass the assessment and become a member of the heaven-cleaving alliance was still uncertain.

However, with his strength, if he accepted the assessment as the Invincible Divine Master, he would have at least a 90% chance of making a breakthrough. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After all, he could kill the Immortal Saint directly!

If such a heaven-defying Divine Master could not pass the assessment, who else could?

“Jian Yi, I want to know, will you use the heaven-cleaving token to participate in the assessment of the heaven-cleaving alliance in the future?” Bone Emperor asked.

“Yes!” Jian Wushuang nodded decisively. Then he looked at the Bone Emperor and asked, “Lord Bone Emperor, is your condition related to the heaven-cleaving alliance?”

“Yes.” The Bone Emperor nodded with a smile on his face. “My condition is actually very simple. When you accept the assessment, you must admit that you were recommended by me to the heaven-cleaving alliance.”

“That simple?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Just admit that you were recommended by the Bone Emperor, and that was it?

The Bone Emperor’s condition was indeed a little too simple.

“Lord Bone Emperor, as a member of the heaven-cleaving alliance, do you also receive rewards or rewards for introducing a new member of the heaven-cleaving alliance?” Jian Wushuang asked.
