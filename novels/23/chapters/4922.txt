4923 Confusing

Prince Yu’s voice resounded in the void battleground. All the kneeling Yan Immortals heaved a sigh of relief.

As long as they could verify the identity of an Imperial Prince, they would definitely be safe.

All the Yan Immortals could tell that the True Image of Emperor Zhen Wuyang had been sealed for too long, which was why he did not know of Prince Yu’s identity.

Looking at the colorful divine blood in the air, Zhen Wuyang’s True Shadow looked at Prince Yu with a serious expression.

The corner of his eyebrows twitched. The wound on his wrist was a little big in his excitement just now, causing the divine blood to not flow out slowly but spurt out like a fountain…

If this continued, he would probably be weak in a moment.

“Imperial Father, we’ll know once we investigate,” Prince Yu said nervously and reached out his hand.

Zhen Wuyang’s True Shadow no longer hesitated. He waved his hand and took out a drop of divine blood.

A drop of colorful divine blood lay in the palm condensed from an unknown aura that was above the Heavenly Dao.

Zhen Wuyang looked at the divine blood in his hand. The divine blood was like a swallow in his arms, jumping happily. In the blink of an eye, it entered the True Shadow and nourished it.

Taking back his palm, Zhen Wuyang took a deep breath and looked at Prince Yu with a much gentler gaze.

“You said that you are my third son?”

Prince Yu was overjoyed. He hurriedly cupped his hands and said, “Father, I am your third son, Prince Yu.”

When Zhen Wuyang heard this, his gentle eyes suddenly turned sharp. Like two Heavenly Daos, he pressed down on Prince Yu until he could not get up.

“Then why are you trying to kill your eldest brother?!”

Cold sweat instantly broke out again, but he quickly cupped his hands and made a bitter and hateful gesture as he said in a sad voice.

“Imperial Father, you might not know this, but although Prince Yan is the eldest brother, he has never done anything that an elder brother should do. He is extremely cruel to us six brothers.”

“Fifth brother Prince Mo was killed by him!”

“Poor Fifth Brother, his head was chopped off and his Immortal Source was shattered!”

Prince Yu stood up and said. His eyes were filled with tears, and he could not help but burst into tears.

When Zhen Wuyang’s True Shadow heard this, he was so shocked that he could not help but clench his fists under his luxurious clothes.

Then, he muttered, “I actually have seven sons?! Zheng’er actually gave birth to seven sons for me?”

“…”

Prince Yu’s mouth twitched. It seemed that Zhen Wuyang did not notice that he had been brewing so many emotions…

Soon, Zhen Wuyang’s True Shadow came back to his senses and frowned. If what he said was true and the fifth son was killed by Prince Yan, then today’s matter would be extremely troublesome.

This was a True Shadow left behind by Zhen Wuyang at his peak. He could not remain for too long and was even slowly dissipating.

Soon, Zhen Wuyang looked at Jian Wushuang, who was kneeling in the void and covered in blood, and asked, “Yan’er, what he said is the truth. Did you send the Yan Immortal to kill my fifth son?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

He had been severely injured by the supreme Heavenly Dao in the Blue Feather Bell, so much so that Jian Wushuang was still unable to speak.

When Prince Yu, who was far away, saw this scene, he hurriedly said, “Imperial Father, you are mistaken. He is not Prince Yan. The one behind you is Prince Yan!”

Zhen Wuyang was shocked. He looked behind him and saw a handsome young man standing behind Jian Wushuang.

As their eyes met, Zhen Wuyang quickly frowned.

The Young Emperor bowed slowly. “Yan’er greets Imperial Father.”

He did not say anything else and directly stretched out his palm to check between the Young Emperor’s brows.

Soon, a hint of sadness and pain flashed in Zhen Wuyang’s eyes.

There was no way to hide the uniqueness of the Young Emperor’s constitution.

“So, Yan’er, your physique…”

Zhen Wuyang could not continue. He turned around and looked at Jian Wushuang, who had already recovered. “Then, which son are you? ”

“Imperial Father, you’re wrong. He’s not an Imperial Prince, he’s Prince Yan’s Heavenly Official!” Prince Yu hurriedly corrected him.

When Zhen Wuyang heard that, he frowned and took out a drop of divine blood from Jian Wushuang’s body.

The divine blood was mysterious and ever-changing, it was a hazy color that even the Yan Immortal could not see its core.

In Zhen Wuyang’s palm, Jian Wushuang’s divine blood was also jumping. It seemed to have some unknown familiarity and probing. However, it did not merge with Zhen Wuyang’s real shadow. Instead, it kept swimming.

“Why do I feel a strong sense of familiarity?”

Looking at the divine blood in his hand that seemed to be protected by some kind of aura, Zhen Wuyang’s True Shadow could not help but try to remove the aura.

However, he soon discovered to his surprise that he could not break the restriction on this drop of blood!

Zhen Wuyang’s gaze turned solemn. He looked at Jian Wushuang and asked again, “Are you really not my Imperial Son? Why do I feel a familiar feeling from you?”

Jian Wushuang was confused. It had only been a few decades since he came to the Great Yan Domain.

Prior to this, he had never interacted with the entire Great Si Region or the Heavenly Court of Zhen Wuyang.

To be able to feel a familiar feeling from him was no different from fantasy.

Just as Jian Wushuang was about to deny it, the Young Emperor, who had not spoken for a long time, said, “Imperial Father, he is indeed not your son.”

Hearing this, Zhen Wuyang did not say anything else, but the confusion in his eyes deepened.

Jian Wushuang’s aura was too familiar to him. It was as if he could not cut off some kind of cognitive emotion.

Prince Yu, who was standing on the opposite side, could not help but feel anxious when he saw this scene.

Then, he gritted his teeth and cupped his hands again. “Imperial Father, please help Fifth Brother take Prince Yan’s Immortal bone!”

The void was deathly silent. Only this sentence resounded.

To a lesser Imperial Lord who was unable to cultivate and had no Immortal roots, the act of taking away his Immortal bones would completely strip him of his Immortal path.

Once the Immortal bone was stripped off, he would die in an extremely short period of time, and there was no way to reverse it.

Prince Yu wanted the Young Emperor to die.

After hearing this sentence, various complicated emotions flowed in Zhen Wuyang’s eyes.

In the end, he looked at the Young Emperor. “Yan ‘er, have you done that kind of thing?”

The Young Emperor smiled coldly, his gaze extremely calm. “Imperial Father, my personality has never changed since I was young. Whether you believe it or not, I would never do such a thing.”

“Even if my Immortal body is incomplete and I can’t cultivate, I still don’t acknowledge my brothers, so I naturally won’t argue with them.”
