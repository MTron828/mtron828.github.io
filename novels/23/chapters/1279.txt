Chapter 1280: The Golden-sun Sect Master

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The military camp was brightly lit as a large number of sergeants gathered around them but did not dare to approach closer.

Commander Man Yi and the four Universe Gods confronted the Golden-sun Sect Master at a distance.

“Commander.” Jian Wushuang appeared beside Man Yi.

“Jian Wushuang, are you okay?” asked Commander Man Yi.

Jian Wushuang replied gratefully, “Luckily, you came in time.”

“I thought that only the Holy Prefecture wants to kill you, so I did not expect the Golden-sun Sect to get involved in this matter.” Commander Man Yi’s face fell.

“Jian Wushuang?” The Golden-sun Sect Master glanced at Jian Wushuang, his eyes radiating a faint golden light.

Before he arrived, he had already received Jian Wushuang’s portrait, so he recognized him on sight.

“He actually discovered me in advance?”?The Golden-sun Sect Master was quite puzzled.

His concealment skill was brilliant. After he intruded into Scarlet Island, even Man Yi, a Second Heaven Universe God, had not perceived his arrival in time, but Jian Wushuang had?

“Golden-sun Sect Master, you broke into my place to sneakily attack one of our Universe Masters. Shame on you.” Commander Man Yi’s voice echoed.

Each of the cultivators from Scarlet Island was full of anger.

In their eyes, it was brazen for the Golden-sun Sect Master with such a prominent status to launch a sneak attack on a Universe Master.

Nevertheless, the Golden-sun Sect Master replied with a careless expression, “Shame? This world only respects strength. Jian Wushuang should be proud of being killed by me.”

“Oh, unfortunately, you have miscalculated,” Commander Man Yi responded with an icy smile.

The Sect Master sighed. “Actually, I didn’t expect for the boy’s psychic ability to be so good that he would able to sense my arrival in advance. It seems impossible to kill him today.”

“Golden-sun Sect Master, there has always been an intense rivalry between your sect and our Scarlet Island. Jian Wushuang is really a brilliant genius, but he has not dealt a blow to your Golden-sun Sect. You don’t have to personally come to assassinate him. Tell me, what is your purpose today?” Commander Man Yi shouted. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“My purpose?” The Golden-sun Sect Master replied with a frosty look, “Obviously, because of him!”

The Golden-sun Sect Master pointed at Jian Wushuang as he asked in a grim tone, “Jian Wushaung, how did Jin Feng die?”

“Jin Feng?”

Everyone was stunned.

They all knew that Jin Feng, the monarch of the Jin Kingdom, was an ordinary Universe God, but his status in the Golden-sun Sect was quite special.

There was a rumor that Jin Feng was the younger brother of the Golden-sun Sect Master, although neither of them had ever publicly admitted it.

.

“Jin Feng is dead?”

Commander Man Yi was astonished and then growled, “Golden-sun Sect Master, we all know that Jin Feng and you had a close relationship, but does his death have any kind of relationship to our island and Jian Wushuang?”

“Of course!” The Sect Master said, “Not long ago, Jin Feng invited Jiu Xi to go to a Secret Land. But Jin Feng and Jiu Xi died there one after the other and none of their underlings came back alive!

“No one knows the reason for their deaths. I sent my people to investigate this matter, but they found nothing. That is, until yesterday, when I received a message from the Holy Prefecture…

“The Holy Prefecture concluded that Jian Wushuang killed Jiu Xi!”

Commander Man Yi and the other Universe Gods looked at each other with frowns.

“Jian Wushuang,” the Golden-sun Sect Master looked over at the boy and asked, “did you kill Jiu Xi?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded directly.

He knew he was unable to defend himself because of the Curse Power.

Then, the Golden-sun Sect Master asked, “And what about Jin Feng? Did you kill him as well?”

He thought that Jian Wushuang had the power to kill an Advanced First Heaven Universe God. Therefore, he could have killed Jin Feng.

“Jin Feng? What Jin Feng?” Jian Wushuang shook his head. “I killed a core disciple from the Holy Prefecture, but I have never heard of the Jin Feng that you speak of!”

“Boy, you lie!!!” The Sect Master shouted in his sternest voice. “Jin Feng and Jiu Xi went to the Secret Land together and died there. And since you killed Jiu Xi, how could you not know Jin Feng?”

Jian Wushuang said indifferently, “Golden-sun Sect Master, I really don’t know who you are talking about.

“I met Jiu Xi in a dark void, instead of a Secret Land. At that time, I had just left my hometown, so I was energetic and eager to fight an expert from the Eternal Chaotic World. The first cultivator I met was Jiu Xi. I recognized that she was a Universe Master, so I challenged her and killed her.

“That’s all.”

Jian Wushuang explained it with a calm look and seemingly told the truth.

He was unwilling to confess that he had killed Jin Feng.

He had a powerful opponent, the Holy Prefecture, so he did not want any more. More importantly, he was worried that Commander Man Yi and the other Universe Masters were unable to withstand the attacks from the Golden-sun Sect Master.

At such a critical moment, he had better not provoke the Golden-sun Sect Master again.

Upon hearing this, the Golden-sun Sect Master frowned.

Commander Man Yi also spoke. “Golden-sun Sect Master, you said Jin Feng died before Jiu Xi, so there was a gap between their deaths, right?”

The Golden-sun Sect Master’s face fell.
