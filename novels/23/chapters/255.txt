Chapter 256: A fight with Two Experts of the Saint Realm

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Whoosh!

A white-robed elder with white hair suddenly appeared beside Qi Luosheng. His breath was even stronger than Qi Luosheng. Everyone knew his identity.

Divine Transcendence!

“There’s still one more person.” Jian Wushuang looked at the white-robed elder with an upset look.

If the newcomer had only reached the Peak of Yang Void Realm and even comprehended Origin, Jian Wushuang would not have minded it. However, this elder was a super expert of Divine Transcendence.

Even Qi Luosheng called him “Master”, which indicated the elder’s strength.

“He is Lin Xiaonan of Holy Emperor Palace?” Wang Yuan’s face fell when he saw the elder.

“This old monster.” Dan Yi was also shocked.

Qi Luosheng reached Divine Transcendence half a year ago, so he had just achieved the Saint Realm at the most ordinary level.

Both Wang Yuan and Dan Yi knew that the white-robed elder had been at the level of Saint Realm for dozens of years.

“The old guy has created a saintly body. He is much stronger than Qi Luosheng. Bastard!” Wang Yuan cursed in private.

The number of experts of Elixir School was comparable to that of Holy Emperor Palace.

Wang Yuan had joined this fight out of his own volition. He could not represent Elixir School, so he could not use the experts of Elixir School, but Holy Emperor Palace could.

Blood Feather Tower was the underling of Holy Emperor Palace. In order to kill Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian, Holy Emperor Palace had intentionally dispatched a superior of the Saint Realm to hide himself as a back-up, in case events that unfolded were not in their favor.

Now, the expert of the Saint Realm showed himself.

“Master Xiao Nan.” Qi Luosheng looked at the elder with respect.

“Tower Master, even though your breakthrough was recent, you’re still supposed to be a super expert of the Saint Realm. Unexpectedly, you couldn’t even defeat an insignificant person of the Yang Void Realm, and lost half of your hand. If this news spreads, you’ll lose face.” Lin Xiaonan glanced at Qi Luoshen.

The thunderous look on Qi Luosheng’s face immediately went stiff and became more distorted. “Master Xiao Nan, less nonsense, please kill the boy as soon as possible.”

“I know. Since I have come here, I won’t let him go.” Lin Xiaonan looked confident and stroked his beard.

Jian Wushuang was a little scared. Then he waved his hand and released a streak of Flowing Light towards Jian Nantian.

Jian Nantian caught the streak of Flowing Light and opened his hand. There was a brown elixir on his palm.

“Father, this is Reversal Red Scorching Elixir, which can fix your broken Dantian and enhance your strength. However, the elixir will squeeze out all of your potentials. If you eat it, you will not be able to reach the further realms.” Jian Wushuang explained the effect of the elixir.

“Oh?” Jian Nantian blinked, and ate the Reversal Red Scorching Elixir without hesitation.

Then he instantly sat down with his legs crossed.

“Give me 10 minutes,” Jian Nantian said, and closed his eyes.

“10 minutes?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

10 minutes was not long, but many fights could take place within 10 minutes.

“Fourth Younger Sister!” Jian Wushuang shouted.

Whoosh!

Su Rou immediately appeared beside Jian Wushuang.

“Please protect my father. Don’t let anyone disturb him,” Jian Wushuang said. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Okay.” Su Rou nodded heavily. She was not adept at frontal attack, but as a protector, she was stronger than all other experts.

Jian Wushuang was relieved that Su Rou could protect his father, provided that the two experts of the Saint Realm did not attack her.

“Let me deal with the two guys of the Saint Realm,” Jian Wushuang said calmly.

“Third Elder Brother, are you sure that you can handle it?” Su Rou looked at Jian Wushuang.

“I’ll try.” Jian Wushuang smiled, with a flicker of madness in his eyes.

Boom!

Emitting a terrifying wave of breath, Jian Wushuang dashed out with strong vigor.

Whoosh! Jian Wushuang struck a blow with his sword. The sword light whistled. Qi Luosheng and Lin Xiaonan dodged and let the sword light slash through the space between the two of them.

Thump... The half part of the island was cut in two by the streak of sword light.

Whoosh!

An old figure soundlessly appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. It was Lin Xiaonan. He glanced at Jian Wushuang indifferently. Shaping his hand into a claw, he struck back at a lightning speed.

Jian Wushuang twisted his body. A streak of white sword light flashed through swirling snow.

Lin Xiaonan sneered. Then he clenched his fist and smashed it toward the white light.

Clang! Jian Wushuang’s sword light collided with the fist, letting out a metal-like bumping sound.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

“I made a powerful attack. Moreover, it came from Triple-kill Sword. It was able to cut off Qi Luosheng’s hand. A layer of the black crystals could not block my stroke.”

However, his stroke could not slash into Lin Xiaonan’s fist.

“It’s a good sword but it’s wasted on you. You haven’t displayed the real power of the sword.” Lin Xiaonan sneered. Then he tried to attack Jian Wushuang with a succession of punches.

Each punch was extremely powerful.

Jian Wushuang waved his Long Sword to deflect them.

While Jian Wushuang and Lin Xiaonan were fighting with each other, Qi Luosheng took the chance to appear beside Jian Wushuang.

“Kiddo, go to hell!”

Qi Luosheng’s distorted face became more horrible. He gathered terrifying power in his remaining hand and launched an attack on Jian Wushuang.

“Ridiculous!”

Jian Wushuang did not look at Qi Luosheng, and brandished his sword towards Qi Luosheng. The latter was instantly forced to retreat.

At this moment, a giant elephant appeared behind Lin Xiaonan.

The giant elephant was as large as a mountain. Then Lin Xiaonan’s body changed into a mountain, and rushed towards Jian Wushuang.

“Hum!”

Jian Wushuang snorted. His body turned into Ghosts. Streaks of residual shadow appeared around the Void nearby. When Lin Xiaonan eventually crashed into a streak of residual shadow, the sword light immediately dashed towards him.

Jian Wushuang made this stroke with roaring battle intent and invincible momentum.

He was fighting two experts of the Saint Realm, but there was no sign that he would lose the fight.
