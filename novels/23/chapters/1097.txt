“Double the strength?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

An increase of only 10 to 20 percent was huge enough once one became a Celestial Master.

When he wasat the Ancient Monster Clan, Celestial Master Heart-withered only improved his strength by 30 percent throughthe large and exquisite spirit-gathering Spell Formation.

Yet a drop of the Ancient God Power could double a Celestial Master’s strength?

Thisalone was a testament to how miraculous the Ancient God Power was.

“That’s for ordinary warriors. It’s a different story for you,” Gu King suddenly said.

“What do you mean?” Jian Wushuang was curious.

“The Ancient God Power is the outcome of the Ancient God Clan. Therefore, only real Ancient Gods can use the full extent ofthe power.Since Celestial Mastersof Green Fire Palace don’t possess any Ancient God bloodline, it can only double their strength.But you’re the real Imperial Kinsmen Ancient God. You can improve your strength trifold or even fourfold!”

“ls it really that impressive?” Jian Wushuang’s heart was filled with joy.

“Of course, the Ancient God Powerisextremely popular inthe Eternal Chaotic World. Though it’s not as effective for ordinary experts, it can be enormously helpful for experts such as Tang Emperor andVoid Temple Master,” Gu King said solemnly.

“In addition, the Ancient God Power can’t be stored byordinary Ancient Gods. Normally, only those who are stronger than Six-star Gold-armored Ancient Gods can gather the power.”

“Therefore, it’s rare even in the Eternal Chaotic World. I’ve seen Ancient God Power in the Fire Points Exchange Office before, but I didn’t bring it up because it’s worth too many points. I never thought that Green Fire Palace would be so extravagant and present a drop of the power to every expert setting off for the battlefield!”

“Extravagant?” Jian Wushuang asked in surprise.

It was indeed extravagant if only those stronger than Six-star Gold-armored Ancient God could gather the Ancient God Power.

“If Green Fire Palace can give away the Ancient God Power so easily, I’m guessing they have plenty of it. Ask him how they collected so much Ancient God Power,” GuKing said.

Jian Wushuang nodded and inquired about this as suggested. Tang Emperor did not conceal the truth.

“There is probably plenty of the power on the huge battlefield. The Green Fire Palace experts could sometimes find some while venturing outside. How much they get depends on their luck. It varies from several drops to overa hundreddrops.” Tang Emperor smiled.

“We obtained much of it in the past but we’ve also spent a lot of it. Hence, we try to be conservative and only present a drop to those who are leaving for the battlefield. If you want to acquire more of this power, you may exchange for it in the Fire Points Exchange Office. It’s 5,000 Fire Points for each drop.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang appeared to have deepened his understanding while Gu King was shocked.

“There are that many pockets of Ancient God Power in the battlefield?Could there be top experts of the Ancient God Clan among those who fought on the battlefield?” Gu King murmured.

“Now that I’ve given you all the objects, you can decide when to depart. The battlefield is unusually dangerous. Be careful and come back alive,” Tang Emperor said, leaving him a warning.

“Thank you, Grand-teacher.”

Jian Wushuang left after expressing his gratitude.

He headed straight for the battlefield after bidding Tang Emperor farewell.

However, before doing so, he discharged his Original Body.

“Though I’m confident about my strength and defensive power, I won’t be in danger of losing my life if I keep my Original Body here.”

He also left behind some precious treasures such as the Mountain River Map and the Spaceship.

The Mountain River Map was a Chaos Divine Treasure. Mighty as it was, he could not effectively exert its power. The same could be said for hisNine-province Seal.

He dared not to use the Spaceship as danger loomed in every corner of the battlefield.

He left them all behind as he saw no use for them there.

He took only the Blood-killing Plate Armor, Blood Mountain Sword, and KillingBead with his World Body and headed for the road.

With the Green FireWorld being the center of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang reached the battlefield as soon as he stepped out of Green Fire Palace.

In the vast expanse of the ruinswere large amounts of building debris, left untouched by the wind even after hundreds of millions of years.

“The Green Fire Palace experts have searched the battlefieldnearby numerous times so there’s no need to linger here. Others would’ve found most of the opportunities available and the rest would be concealedinhard-to-find places.”

Holding the map made of animal fur,Jian Wushuang pondered for a short moment before an idea struck him.

“I’m going to explore the uncharted territories!”

The places that experts from the palace had explored were only a small part of the vast battlefield, as were the treasures andopportunities found. Most of them were still left untouched and undiscovered in the uncharted territories.

Since he was here for the treasures and opportunities, he ought to explore places that no one had ever been to.

“Thisareais still far from the closest uncharted territory. It will take me over a decade to get there even if I rush over.I need to hurry up!”?He then began running at full speed.

Since he was now at the explored area, there was no need for him to worry about natural dangers as those were clearly marked on the map. Thus, he ran unbridled.

He did not come across even a single person in the decade he spent rushing over to the closest uncharted territory. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Neither Jin Kingdom nor Green Fire Palace experts appeared on his way there.
