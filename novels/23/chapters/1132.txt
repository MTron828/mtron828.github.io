Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“He must have spread the word about the invitation. It seems that Celestial Master Malignity has made full preparation and is very confident,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Of course he’s confident,” Celestial Master Yu Ding said. “Celestial Master Malignity has become renowned for a long time ago. He’s a long-time Celestial Master of theExceptional Realm with exceptional speed. Even the Celestial Masters ofGreen Fire Palace are no match for him in terms of speed and many Celestial Masters ofthe Exceptional Realm couldn’t even defeat him because of that.”

“In addition,the fight will be carriedoutinside Oblivion Palace. It’s a vacant space without obstacles of any kind, allowing him to go full speed.”

“Speed? Celestial Master Yu Ding,are you sayingthat his speed is his forte?” Jian Wushuang’s expression turned strange.

He had just obtained the Blaze Quicksand Gourd, which could be used to control the Blaze Quicksand. It was the best weaponto restrict his opponent’s speed.

Now, there was an expert with incredible speed coming to him for a fierce battle.

It seemed like the perfect time for him to practice the Blaze Quicksand.

“Will you accept the invitation?” Yu Ding asked.

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang nodded without hesitation.

“It’s better to start early. Let’s go,” Yu Ding said.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang followed after Yu Ding. Together, they headed for Oblivion Palace.

Oblivion Palace was located on the same land as Green Fire Palace. It looked like an ordinary palace but its interior was an endless space that was enough to allow two Universe Masters to battle to their hearts’ content, let alone two Celestial Masters.

There was already a crowd outside Oblivion Palace when Jian Wushuang and Yu Ding got there.

Numerous Green Fire Palace experts stood there, talking in groups of twos or threes. When Jian Wushuang showed up, they all turned to look in his direction.

“Here comes Jian Wushuang!”

“Haha, he really showed up! See, I told you he won’t refuse the invitation!”

“Jian Wushuang is incredibly skillful. He might not necessarily lose to Celestial Master Malignity. Of course he won’t refuse it.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The experts looked on, their excitement building.

They had been worried that Jian Wushuang might not accept the invitation but it seemed like their worries were unnecessary.

“Jian Wushuang, Celestial Master Malignity has been waiting for you inside Oblivion Palace. You can go in now,” Yu Ding said.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded and then entered the palace.

It was dark and vast inside. The palace seemed boundless without an end.

A purple-haired man in a luxurious robe stood tall in the dark void. He had his arms folded as he waited quietly for Jian Wushuang’s arrival.

Before long, the scarlet-robed Jian Wushuang appeared before the purple-haired man with a sword in hand.

“So, you’re Jian Wushuang!” Celestial Master Malignity’s eyes gleamed with purple light, his gaze fixed on Jian Wushuang.

“Celestial Master Malignity.” Jian Wushuang wore a kind smile on his face.

There was no grudge between them in the first place. Celestial Master Malignity’s anger was understandable as Jian Wushuang took a spot which was supposed to be his.

“Humph! I heard that you’ve made a name for yourself on the battlefield and even earned the praise and approval of the five Palace Masters. Sunrise Sword Emperor even suggested adding your name to the World of Swords!” Celestial Master Malignity clenched his fists tightly.

“Celestial Master Malignity, I didn’t know that before…” Jian Wushuang began to explain himself.

“Stop with the nonsense.” Celestial Master Malignity waved his hand. “Since you’re so strong, show me what you’ve got.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he waved his hand again and tossed a token.

“Hm?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed as he looked quizzically at the token that Celestial Master Malignity tossed aside.

He could recognize that token. It was used to record the Mirror Image.

People outside Oblivion Palace could not see what was going on inside. If Celestial Master Malignity were to record the battle, it was evident that he wanted to make it public.

“It seems that Celestial Master Malignity hates me so much that he intends to embarrass me in front of the public.”?Jian Wushuang wore a faint smile. He was not worried at all.

Meanwhile, outside the palace, two people stood side by side.

They were evidently Sunrise Sword Emperor and Palace Master Red Lotus who had just hurried over from the battlefield.

While others could not see what happened inside Oblivion Palace, they could see through everything.

“Celestial Master Malignity has such a bad temper. Red Lotus, won’t you advise him as his Senior Sister?” Sunrise Sword Emperor frowned.

“He’s supposed to be listed in the World of Swords but Jian Wushuang stole his place. You can’t blame him for getting angry over it; anyone else would have done the same. Besides, my Junior Brother simply wants to vent his rage. He isn’t going to kill him,” Red Lotus replied coldly.

“It was my idea to give the spot to Jian Wushuang. He didn’t know about it. If Celestial Master Malignity isn’t happy with it, he can come to me anytime.”

“You’re not just a Palace Master. You’re also someone with the potential to be the future leader of Green Fire Palace. Do you seriously think that my junior brother will dare to come to you?” Red Lotus chuckled. “It’s too late to talk about this now. Jian Wushuang is as unruly as his father. Isn’t this the perfect chance to rectify his insolence?”

“Haha, can Celestial Master Malignity teach him a lesson? I don’t think so.” Sunrise Sword Emperor laughed.

“What? You think that Celestial Master Malignity can’t do anything to the kid?” “Don’t forget that his speed is ranked first among all Celestial Masters. Fighting in Oblivion Palace also gives him an advantage. Even if Jian Wushuang has the strength of a Celestial Master of the Exceptional Realm, he’ll still lose,” Red Lotus said.

“Do you want to make a bet?” Sunrise Sword Emperor glanced at Red Lotus.

“What would you like to bet?” Red Lotus asked.

“Not too long ago, I heard you acquired a Red Source Stone weighing over six kilograms from the battlefield. I might need it,” Sunrise Sword Emperor said.

“Deal. If you lose, I want you to tutor my Junior Brother for a year. You must also give him the spot for the World of Swords when it opens in 100,000 years later,” Red Lotus said.

“No problem,” Sunrise Sword Emperor answered without hesitation.

After the bet had been made, the two of them looked down at Oblivion Palace.

Inside the palace, the battle between Jian Wushuang and Celestial Master Malignity had already begun.
