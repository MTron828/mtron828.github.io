Chapter 2554: Challenging the Territorial Lord

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang sunk deeply into his studies.

The mystical Cosmic Mysteries within the Fengtian Scroll immensely helped Jian Wushuang.

In a short three-month period, he had made plenty of progress.

However at that moment...

“Mr. Jian Yi.” Xiao Tiexin’s voice transmitted from outside the secret chamber. She had to use a tiny bit of divine power to breach Jian Wushuang’s restrictive shield.

Jian Wushuang’s studies were immediately interrupted as he instantly woke up, opened his eyes, and frowned.

“It’s only been three months. The Situ Clan needs more time. What made Tiexin decide to look for me with such urgency?” He exited the secret chamber feeling puzzled.

Jian Wushuang saw Xiao Tiexin outside the chamber.

“I’m sorry to interrupt, Mr. Jian Yi.” Xiao Tiexin bowed slightly at Jian Wushuang.

“What happened, Tiexin?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Xiao Tiexin carefully spoke, “Something of utmost importance has occurred. Someone’s challenging the Territorial Lord!”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang’s curiosity was piqued.

Challenging the Territorial Lord...

As a star territory’s lord, the Territorial Lord was in control of a powerful Official Army which made him the territory’s absolute warlord.

However, a territorial lord’s position was obtained through power. This meant that as long as one was capable enough, they could challenge the incumbent Territorial Lord.

The Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord was really powerful. However, there had been three Earth Ultimate Gods who challenged him ever since he rose into that position and all of them were defeated with two being killed on the spot by him.

Due to that reason, no one truly dared to challenge the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord. Even those newly ascended Earth Ultimate Gods within the Northern Darkstar Territory would normally choose to leave the territory and seek their paths in other territories. Who was so fearless to challenge the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord?

“Who’s the challenger?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I don’t know.” Xiao Tiexin shook her head. “I only know he’s an Earth Ultimate God who easily passed all the Official Army’s tests and fulfilled those criteria to challenge the Territorial Lord. Besides that, no one knows anything about him. He left behind a message after passing the tests saying that he would meet the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord in the Combat Ring and only one of them will survive.”

“He wants to determine the winner through a deathmatch?” Jian Wushuang’s pupils contracted. “Did the Territorial Lord answer his challenge?”

“Not only did he answer but their battle will commence in three days. That’s why I came looking for you. It’s a battle between two Earth Ultimate Gods after all and the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord personally accepted the challenge. I thought you’d be interested in watching the fight,” said Xiao Tiexin.

“Hmmm, I’m indeed very interested in watching these two’s fight.” Jian Wushuang firmly nodded.

Earth Ultimate Gods... Jian Wushuang had not seen an Earth Ultimate God expert’s fight before and had no idea how strong their battle prowess would be.

In addition, it would be a fight with the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord.

The biggest reason Jian Wushuang stayed at Northern Darkstar Territory was to challenge him to obtain the Territorial Lord’s position on top of his most precious treasure—The Stately Painting! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

However, he knew nothing of the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord’s true abilities.

How could he miss such a perfect opportunity with an Earth Ultimate God’s arrival to challenge the Territorial Lord?

“Three days later?”

Jian Wushuang was really looking forward to it.

...

Three days quickly passed.

The Combat Ring was a boundless battlefield.

In such a ring, even a Heaven Ultimate God and Grand Ultimate God could freely move around without worries and fight not to mention Earth Ultimate Gods.

As long as there was a highly-anticipated duel within the Northern Darkstar Continent, it would be hosted at the Combat Ring.

At that moment, countless people gathered together in the void around the Combat Ring.

There were a few million people present.

The outcome was inevitable as a Territorial Lord’s challenge was a rare event that could only be witnessed every several ten thousand years!

As soon as word got out, countless cultivators and clans from all over were excited by the news.

Naturally, this meant there was no end to the number of cultivators who came to witness the battle.

The Northern Darkstar Continent’s clans—the top three Shi, Wu, and Situ Clan; the small and medium-sized clans—had many clan members who joined in to watch.

There were plenty of experts around.

Other than that, the Official Army deployed almost all their personnel as well to tightly surround the entire Combat Ring and also set up a restrictive shield to prevent people from running into the ring while those two Earth Ultimate Gods were battling. This was to ensure no unforeseen circumstances would happen.

Under the ten commanders’ leadership, the Official Army kept the crowd in order with nobody having the nerves to create any troubles.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang and Xiao Tiexin were gliding over from afar before being stunned by the crowd surrounding them upon their arrival at the void next to the Combat Ring.

“That’s a lot of people!” Xiao Tiexin could not resist exclaiming.

However, Jian Wushuang was very calm.

In his past life, he had seen plenty of grander sights.

“There are so many people that we can’t even find a closer place to observe the battle. What should we do?” Xiao Tiexin frowned.

“Didn’t you keep Clan Leader Situ’s Message Token? You can send him a message and ask for two seats,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Ah, that’s true.” Xiao Tiexin immediately took out the Message Token.

The Situ Clan very soon sent an expert over who led Jian Wushuang and Xiao Tiexin to the void where the remaining Situ Clan’s experts were located.

The Situ Clan was a top-tier clan and the place they were watching the battle was without a doubt one of the closest to the Combat Ring, allowing them to witness everything happening in the battle.

“Haha. I haven’t seen Mr. Jian Yi for three months. You haven’t changed the slightest!”

Situ Yuan stood up and welcomed Jian Wushuang upon seeing his arrival. Many Situ Clan’s experts also stood up and acted humbly toward him.

Although Jian Wushuang was a High-Level Ultimate God, everyone knew he was equipped with a Peak Ultimate God’s battle prowess and possessed great potential. Nobody dared to cross an expert like him.

“Clan Leader Situ, you’re really too kind.” Jian Wushuang returned the courtesy.

“Mr. Jian Yi, please sit here.” Situ Yuan waved his hand and a towering chair appeared next to him. Jian Wushuang did not even hesitate to sit down.

Many cultivators around them were perplexed upon seeing the sight before them.

“Who’s that young man? How can he’s positioning himself at the same level as the Situ Clan Leader?”

“I have no idea, but he’s not an ordinary person if the Situ Clan treated him as such.”

“Hehe, I know this guy. His name’s Jian Yi, the recently emerged Blood Gladiator in the Northern Darkstar Continent. He became a Blood Gladiator at the Early Stage Ultimate God Realm.”

“A Blood Gladiator?”

Everybody around suddenly realized who he was the moment his name was mentioned.
