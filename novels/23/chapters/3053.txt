Chapter 3054: Retreat

——

“Haha, it’s true that you don’t have any grudges against us, but it’s a pity that your luck is too bad. You just happened to run into the founding of the Blood Evil Sect, and the Blood Evil Sect has already spread the word that level one True Saints like us can join the Blood Evil Sect as long as we can kill twenty Immortal Saints in a specific area around us!”

“So, if you want to blame someone, blame yourself for staying in this particular area and fulfilling the Blood Evil Sect’s conditions.”

The hearty laughter continued to reverberate in the world.

The eleven False Saints were completely in despair.

They finally understood why the four True Saints did not hesitate to attack the moment they saw them. It turned out that it was because of the Blood Evil Sect.

Although these False Saints had some strength, they were far inferior to True Saints. Moreover, False Saints did not even have an immortal body, so their life-saving abilities were ordinary, they could not escape from the pursuit of these four True Saints.

“It’s over!”

“No!”

Amidst the shrill screams, the eleven False Saints were killed in just a moment.

This happened in front of Jian Wushuang’s team. Jian Wushuang, Jiu Luo, and the False Saints behind them all saw it clearly.

When they saw the four True Saints kill all the 11 False Saints, the false saints in the team were filled with fear.

At this time, the four true saints also looked at Jian Wushuang’s team.

“There’s still a target here.”

Their eyes were extremely cold. One of them, a middle-aged man in a purple robe, had a cold smile on his face. “There are 12 people in total. Ten of them are False Saints. As for True Saints, there are only two of them. Judging from their young appearances, they should not be very strong.”

The other three True Saints also looked at each other in dismay. Although they did not speak, their eyes flashed with a strange look, and they had already begun to communicate.

Suddenly…

“Kill!”

The purple-robed middle-aged man was the first to let out a low shout. His body shot toward Jian Wushuang’s team like a cannonball.

“Kill them all!”

The other three True Saints also rushed out with shocking killing intent.

Like the eleven False Saints they had killed, they also treated Jian Wushuang’s team as prey and attacked them without saying anything.

Seeing this, the False Saints in Jian Wushuang’s team were all shocked.

They had seen with their own eyes how easily the four people had killed the eleven False Saints. Now that the four people were coming to kill them, how could they not be terrified?

However, at the moment when the four people attacked…

“You’re courting death!”

A low shout suddenly sounded in the world.

The person who shouted was Jiu Luo, who was standing next to Jian Wushuang.

Jiu Luo had been smiling for the past three days, but now, when he was angry, his face was as cold as ice.

Boom!

A powerful aura suddenly erupted like a volcano that had been silent for hundreds of millions of years.

Jiu Luo suddenly rushed forward, and the blood-red saber on his back was also unsheathed.

Whoosh!

A demonic blood-red saber light appeared out of thin air and pierced through the void. It seemed as if the entire world had been split apart by this blood-red saber light.

The surrounding void also became completely dark.

Under the endless darkness, this blood-red saber light was very dazzling and even very intoxicating.

“This saber…”

Seeing Jiu Luo’s saber move, Jian Wushuang was also stunned.

He could instantly tell that the power of the move was extraordinary. The principles power contained in it was extremely rich. Jiu Luo’s comprehension of the principles was very high, so he must be very powerful among the rank three True Saints! His saber technique was also very powerful, so he must have used a rank three absolute art!

As for the power of divine power, Jiu Luo’s divine power had reached the limit of a rank one True Saint. It was almost close to that of a rank two True Saint.

When all these things were combined, Jian Wushuang was sure that Jiu Luo’s battle strength was comparable to a rank two True Saint, or even very strong among rank two True Saints.

“This guy is actually a genius,” Jian Wushuang could not help but say.

Jian Wushuang was strong and knowledgeable, so he could see Jiu Luo’s specific battle strength at a glance.

However, the four True Saints who came directly at him did not have as good an eye as he did.

The four True Saints did not pay much attention to Jiu Luo’s attack until the saber light landed.

Hua!

The saber light carried an earth-shaking power as it flew past the purple-robed middle-aged man. The middle-aged man opened his eyes wide, but his head was thrown away.

Jiu Luo’s body burst out again.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Three blood-red saber lights slashed out at the same time.

In just one move, the god body of the second True Saint, the cold old man with an evil aura, was destroyed. The other two people who were rushing forward were scared, squatting there.

The four rank one True Saints attacked at the same time. In just a blink of an eye, two of their God bodies were destroyed by Jiu Luo.

Most importantly, they did not use their divine bodies to rebuild their divine bodies in the first place.

To be exact, they wanted to rebuild their divine bodies, but unfortunately, they did not have the ability.

“Poison!”

Jian Wushuang, who was standing behind them, raised his eyebrows when he saw this scene.

He had prepared a lot of ‘God-burning’ poison to better kill the True Saints in the Magic Note Divine Kingdom. Although the poison was expensive, it was very cost-effective. Under normal circumstances, it only took two or three drops of god-burning poison to kill a rank one True Saint, rendering his immortal body useless. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

However, Jian Wushuang was clearly not the only one in the world who would do this.

Many experts would choose to carry some poison that could corrode their divine bodies, specifically to kill those True Saints with immortal bodies. However, such experts needed a certain background, after all, a treasure like the god-burning poison was not only expensive but also unavailable to ordinary experts.

Jian Wushuang was also a heaven-grade member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, so he could exchange for the god-burning poison from the Treasure Pavilion.

Now, Jiu Luo had easily destroyed the divine bodies of the two True Saints with his saber light, but the two True Saints could not have enough divine bodies and died immediately. It was obvious that he had smeared the poison on his saber, however, what Jiu Luo had used was not the ‘God-burning’ poison, but a different type.

In the sky, the purple-robed middle-aged man and the sinister-looking old man had both died directly after their divine bodies had collapsed. The remaining two looked at each other with a trace of shock in their eyes, and they did not dare to stop for even a moment, they directly turned around and fled.
