Chapter 1083: Took a Stand

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The five people present were from the Green Fire Palace.

Moreover, they were also the rulers who enjoyed the highest status and were most influential in the Green Fire Palace.

In other words, they were the decision makers of the Green Fire Palace.

They were very clear about the role Ji Wumeng played in the Green Fire Palace. Jian Nantian alone couldn’t rival her.

But if one more person—Jian Wushuang, was added…

“I am Jian Wushuang’s grandmaster and favor him a lot. His potential is much greater than that of?Jian Nantian. If he grows up, he might be stronger than Ji Wumeng.” Tang Emperor said smilingly.

“I admit what you have said is true. However, you should know better than anyone the risks of the Cultivation Method that boy has cultivated. After all, Emperor Qing is a good example. As an Inverse Cultivator, it’s difficult for him to grow up!” The black-robed woman snorted. Although she was not an Inverse Cultivator, she knew something about that.

After hearing the woman’s words, Tang Emperor’s face fell.

Indeed, few Inverse Cultivators survived.

His best disciple, Emperor Qing, did not survive the Inverse Cultivation.

“In any case, I always think it’s absolutely worthwhile to exchange Ji Wumeng with Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian!” Tang Emperor stated.

“If this is the case, we’d better declare where we stand. I’ll do it right now, do you agree with me?” The black-robed woman looked around at the four people.

“I don’t.” Tang Emperor took a stand first.

“I believe in my disciple, so I don’t agree with you.” Samsara Temple Master replied.

“Haha, Jian Wushuang is indeed excellent. As far as I know, he still has an extraordinary Master. Nonetheless, Ji Wumeng means a lot to our Green Fire Palace. After weighing up the pros and cons, I choose to remain neutral.” The white-robbed elder who grew a goat beard said smilingly.

He was the overlord of the Void Continent, the Void Temple Master!

“Sunrise, it’s your turn.” The black-robed woman looked at the indifferent man with a longsword on his back.

The indifferent man appeared to have integrated with heaven and earth and the space around him was transformed into a sharp sword. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He was the universally acknowledged No.1 Sword Cultivator in the Green Fire World, Sunrise Sword Emperor!

“I don’t agree with you either.” Sunrise Sword Emperor said indifferently.

“What?” The black-robed woman marvelled at his response.

She got the impression that Sunrise Sword Emperor was always selfless and practical.

As long as Ji Wumeng followed their plan as she cultivated, her strength was destined to reach that stage.

Though Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian had great potential, no one could tell what their future would be.

Given Sunrise Sword Emperor’s way of handling matters, he should be on her side. Unexpectedly, he disagreed with her.

“Like father, like son. Both Jian Wushuang and Jian Nantian are obstinate. Once they set the goal,?they will achieve it tenaciously regardless of the consequences. Knowing that there are hardships ahead, they choose to ignore them and will never be swayed by them!”

“They are real Sword Cultivators!”

“I am the No.1 in the Green Fire World on Sword Principle and haven’t met a well-matched opponent for years. Both of them are qualified to be my opponent and I believe they will not let me down.”

Sunrise Sword Emperor smiled and glanced at the black-robed woman. “Red Lotus, I know your concern and grievance. After all, you paid the greatest price for the Inheritance that Ji Wumeng attained. But you should believe that talented people appear in every generation!”

“Hmph, I will wait then. If the father and son don’t live up to your expectations, I’ll see how you guys will do then.” The black-robed woman snorted and disappeared from this Void with a quick move.

After that, Void Temple Master, Tang Emperor, and Sunrise Sword Emperor also left.

While leaving, Tang Emperor said to Samsara Temple Master, “Since the Samsara Continent is your territory, we’ll leave those nobodies for you to eliminate.”

Samsara Temple Master forced out a wry smile and left the next moment.

In the Void not far from the habitat of the Ancient Monster Clan, a few figures in black gathered there.

Four black-robed men assembled in the Ancient Monster Clan and fixed their eyes on Ji Wumeng.

With special methods, they figured out that Ji Wumeng possessed the Heavenly Monster Bloodline.

“How pure her bloodline is!”

“I believe the purity of her bloodline is the only one of its kind in the Ancient Monster Clan!”

“Hmph, we were fooled by the Ancient Monster Clan and the Green Fire Palace previously!”

The leader of the four people said coldly, “We always thought that the one who obtained that Inheritance is Dao Master Nine Sword, after all, the Ancient Monster Clan treats him like a treasure. Furthermore, he had reincarnated once. Coupled with that he rarely went out of the Ancient Monster Clan, we were certain about our speculation and even planned to assassinate him…”

“But now it seems that the one who gained that Inheritance is the woman in front of us!”

“Dao Master Nine Sword is merely a deceptive puppet designed by the Ancient Monster Clan and the Green Fire Palace.”

“The one who really threatens us is this woman who has been imprisoned in the Heaven-ceasing Mountain!”

“Be quick, immediately report this message to our monarch!”

The leader shouted out and just as he prepared to send the message, a bulky man suddenly appeared in front of them.

Wearing a black armor, the man stared at them with bulging eyes.

The four black-robed men shook and were seized with terror. As they prepared to transmit the message, they discovered that the space they were in had been sealed completely, not knowing when. This resulted in them being unable to deliver the message.

“Samsara… Samsara Temple Master!”

The leader of the black-robed men let out a sad and shrill cry. In the next moment, Samsara Temple Master waved his hand.

He did that casually, but like a black mass of cloud, his palm covered the four black-robed men completely. After four loud bangs, they turned into blood fog.

With a flick of his sleeve, Samsara Temple Master dissipated the blood fog.

“Hmph, a group of cowards.”

Samsara Temple Master snorted and then left directly. This Void calmed down again. Nobody knew that four genuine Dao Masters were just killed by Samsara Temple Master here.
