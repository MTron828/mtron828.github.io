Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

On Saha Island, that shocking battle had finally come to an end.

The process and result of this battle were personally witnessed by many top experts. It spread like a violent storm across the entire Divine Beginning Realm.

The entire Divine Beginning Realm was shaken by this battle!

There were even people who specially named this battle the battle of the Heavenly Sword Marquis. This was because the true protagonist of this battle was Heavenly Sword Marquis. Moreover, this Heavenly Sword Marquis was the most dazzling person in this battle, he was the most incredible existence.

He refreshed the understanding of all experts toward the Immortal Saint.

No one had ever thought that an Immortal Saint could be this powerful.

However, although the heat of the battle had lasted for a long time, it gradually subsided as time went by.

The Divine Beginning Realm also regained its calm.

In a flash, 20 years had passed since the end of the battle.

On Saha Island, a large amount of gray airflow surrounded the independent space-time, covering every corner of this space-time.

In the center of this space-time, Jian Wushuang’s consciousness finally began to slowly wake up.

“What am I...”

Jian Wushuang lay on a black crystal that emitted a strange aura, and his eyes had already opened to look around.

He wanted to stand up at once, but a feeling of powerlessness immediately arose in his body. His body moved, and he was in extreme pain.

As for his divine power, he did not have any left, just like an ordinary person.

“Little guy, you’re awake.” A calm and gentle voice came from the side.

Jian Wushuang immediately saw the silver-haired elder standing beside the black crystal.

“Greetings, Temple Master.” Jian Wushuang could only speak, but he could not stand up and bow.

“Since you can see my identity at a glance, it seems that your consciousness has not been affected,” Temporal Temple Master said.

“How long have I been in a coma?” Jian Wushuang asked.

He remembered that he had used up all the power that Blood Wave had given him during the battle, including 99% of his divine power. Then that power had rebounded crazily, causing his consciousness to fall into a coma, what happened next was completely unknown to him.

“It hasn’t been long, just 20 years,” The Temporal Temple Master said.

“20 years?” Jian Wushuang was stunned, but then he smiled bitterly. “I’ve been in a coma for 20 years, and it will take more time for my body to recover to its peak condition.”

“Little guy, just be content.” Temporal Temple Master smiled. “Don’t forget that in the previous battle, you were forcibly imbued with a power comparable to that of a ruler. That level of power was only yours. If it had been any other cultivator, it would have been some clan experts with powerful divine bodies, or even some ordinary special lifeforms. The principles would have been that they would have been forced to explode, and they would have died without a doubt!”

“Although your injury is very serious and you need a long time to recover, at least your life is saved, and it won’t affect your overall foundation and consciousness. This is the best result, what else are you not satisfied with?”

“Uh...” Jian Wushuang was stunned, and then he smiled helplessly.

Indeed, before Blood Wave gave him the power, he had told him about the risks he had to take to obtain the power.

The risks were too great.

Ordinary cultivators and even some lower-level special life forms could not withstand the power at all and could only be stuffed to death.

However, because he was a perfect level life form, he forcefully endured it. He just needed some time to recover. Of course, he was much better.

“The power of a ruler...” Jian Wushuang still recalled the power he had in that battle.

That power was so strong that it could make one’s hair stand on end!

“Unfortunately, that power doesn’t really belong to me.” Jian Wushuang could not help sighing.

“What’s a pity? With your potential and talent, it won’t be difficult for you to have the power of a ruler in the future.” Temporal Temple Master looked over.

Jian Wushuang smiled, then he said, “Temple Master, I’ve been curious about what the ruler level is. How can you reach the ruler level? And how can the three masters of the divine realm in the Divine Beginning Realm compare to the ruler level?”

Jian Wushuang knew that above the Principles Master was the ruler level!

However, he was very unfamiliar with the ruler level. He did not know how to be considered a ruler level.

“The ruler-level is just a short name. The true name of this level is the ruler of chaos!”

“As the name implies, the ruler of chaos is the ruler of a Primal Chaos World. It can also be said to be the ruler of the Primal Chaos World. For example, our Divine Beginning Realm is a complete Primal Chaos World. And the ruler of chaos is equivalent to the strongest overlord in this Primal Chaos World. It can be said that he is the strongest existence in this world.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Even in the vast universe, the ruler-level is a true expert, enough to dominate the universe.”

“As for how to become a ruler-level, as well as the difference between a ruler-level and a Principles Master, it’s actually very easy to understand.”

The Temporal Temple Master patiently explained.

“Little fellow, you’ve been in the third sky for quite some time already, and the level you’ve come into contact with is also very high. You should already understand the level division between Principles Masters. From the first level of the void to the six levels of the void, these six levels are all determined by the will power they control. For example, the six levels of the void have six portions of the will power.”

“Most experts who have reached the sixth realm of the void have already fused three rules. Compared to the Principles Masters of the sixth realm of the void, a ruler-level expert only needs to fuse four principles.”

“You can become a chaos ruler by fusing four rules?” Jian Wushuang was stunned. He clearly felt that this process was too simple.

“Little guy, you may think that it’s easy to fuse four principles, but it’s actually very difficult. It’s very difficult to fuse principles. The more principles you fuse, the more difficult it will be. For example, if a Principles Master has finally fused two principles, the difficulty of fusing the third rule will be tens to hundreds of times more difficult than fusing two principles!”

“As for fusing four principles, it’s tens to hundreds of times more difficult than fusing three principles!

“It’s thousands to tens of thousands of times more difficult than fusing two principles. Do you understand the concept?” Temporal Temple Master looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile.

Jian Wushuang was a little dumbfounded.
