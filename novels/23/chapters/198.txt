Chapter 199: Attacked Again

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

They had already fought with the team from the Tianzong Dynasty once.

The team was strong enough to battle them to a standstill.

“If we only depend on our team, it will be impossible to kill Yang Tian. Xiao Xiao, contact another team and ask them to join us,” Gu Yan said and looked at a black-robed woman. Although her was the weakest in their team, her status was very high.

“Okay,” The black-robed woman nodded. A flying insect rushed out from her sleeve as she waved her hand, and flew into the surrounding jungle.

Gu Yan and the others stayed where they were. After about half a day passed, another team from the Cosmos Empire rushed there, guided by the flying insect.

“Gu Yan, what do you want us to do?” asked a brown-haired man. The team also had seven people, and the brown-haired man was the leader, who was 6th on the Rankings, Zhang Kong.

“Where is Ling Xueyu?” Gu Yan muffled his voice.

“That guy likes doing everything by himself, so we separated three days ago,” Zhang Kong said.

“Hum, that’s great. He won’t be able to claim this lucky opportunity,” Gu Yan said and smiled coldly.

“An oppportunity?” Zhang Kong asked while looking at him in surprise.

“The truth is...” Gu Yan began to narrate.

After a few moments of time had passed.

“What? Yang Tian!” Zhang Kong was surprised after hearing what Gu Yan said.

“Yeah, it’s Yang Tian. It’s a great opportunity,” Gu Yan said with a smile, “the team from the Tianzong Dynasty is very powerful. We can’t beat them by ourselves, so we wanted to work together and kill Yang Tian.”

“Okay,” Zhang Kong nodded without hesitance and his eyes were filled with frenzied light.

“Xiao Xiao, can you track the location of that team from the Tianzong Dynasty?” Gu Yan asked.

“Yes, I left a tracking sent on them when we were battling,” said the black-robed woman as she nodded and raised her eyebrows. Then, the previous flying insect flew out again.

“Follow it and kill them!”

Gu Yan smiled coldly. Subsequently, the 14 warriors from the two teams all rushed to where Jian Wushuang and his team members were staying.

Shortly after, they caught up with Jian Wushuang and his five team mates.

Jian Wushuang and the others were trudging through the dense jungle. Suddenly, a violent wind-breaking noise sounded out. They turned to look and found a swarm of warriors rushing towards them.

“Shit!” Jian Wushuang’s face changed.

“The Cosmos Empire!”

“So many people?”

“It’s two teams working together!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The expressions on the faces of Baili Chen, Yang Zaixuan, and the others, immediately changed.

After all, the Cosmos Empire was a large empire. If there was only one team, they could fight back.

However, if the two teams worked together, there was no chance of them putting up a fight.

Up in the air, the Monarchs from those dynasties and the experts from the old sects all sighed while watching this take place.

“The team from Tianzong Dynasty is finished!”

“It’s extraordinary for a team from a small empire to persist this long, but they’ve reached their limit.”

“Hah, the two teams from the Cosmos Empire actually had to work together to fight with six people from the Tianzong Dynasty...”

Di Xi frowned keenly this time.

In the dense forest,

“Hurry and escape!”

As the leader, Jian Wushuang immediately ordered them to retreat.

Because of the huge difference in strength, their only chance was to escape.

“Haha. Do you think you can escape?” Gu Yan roared with a lower voice.

“Gu Yan, which of them is Yang Tian?” Zhang Kong asked with a low voice.

“He is...” Gu Yan said, while his eyes focused on Yang Zaixuan, who was quickly escaping.

“It’s him.” Zhang Kong’s eyes flashed a cold light. “Kill him!”

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

A cascade of figures simultaneously rushed forward at a high speed. Eleven out of the fourteen warriors from the Cosmos Empire teams were rushing toward Yang Zaixuan.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was surprised, “So many people want to kill second brother?”

Without any hesitance, Jian Wushuang turned around and appeared beside Yang Zaixuan.

“Get out of my way!”

Jian Wushuang roared, as the Triple-kill Sword embedded with three combined sword essences radiated a towering aura. A streak of sword shadow chopped out, as if separating the sky from the earth.

The third move of the Selfless Sword Technique, Sky Isolating Form!

This move he just comprehended was Jian Wushuang’s strongest killing move.

“Only by yourself?”

Gu Yan sneered and glanced at Jian Wushuang, striking out like a thunderbolt with his giant axe.

“Bang!”

They collided and then Jian Wushuang and Gu Yan were both pushed back at the same time.

“En?” Gu Yan was shocked. Last time, he could overpower Jian Wushuang in pure strength. But now, their strengths were almost equal.

Although Gu Yan was blocked by Jian Wushuang, the other 10 warriors appeared in front of Yang Zaixuan at this time.

A profusion of attacks began.

“Second bro, Watch out!” Jian Wushuang shouted suddenly.

At that moment, Yang Zaixuan had a very serious expression. Seeing a barrage of attacks rushing towards him, his eyes also flashed with a frenzied light.

Boom!

A horrifying aura suddenly began radiating from Yang Zaixuan. The power of this aura was greater than anyone present. At the same time, a gust of fierce Golden Spiritual Power flooded the area.

The Golden Spiritual Power covered Yang Zaixuan’s whole body, making him look like a god from heaven at the moment

Subsequently, Yang Zaixuan roared and brandished his saber.

He swung his saber three continuous times, chopping through the air and causing the whole area to be filled with rippling waves.

Rumble~

Another fierce roar sounded and the heaven and the earth seemed to be overshadowed.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Many figures were forced to rush away, appearing in the treetops. After regaining their stances, they all looked toward the figure covered in the Golden Spiritual Power.

That figure was Yang Zaixuan!

“It…”

Jian Wushuang, Su Rou, and the others were all looking at Yang Zaixuan with surprise plastered all over their faces.

Because, at this moment, the aura radiating from Yang Zaixuan was too strong, much stronger than Jian Wushuang. And the layer of Golden Spiritual Power that covered his body was also formidable.

“High Heaven Technique!” Gu Yan’s pupils shrank as he said, “Yang Tian, it’s you!”

“Hum,” Yang Zaixuan snorted, and looked over at Jian Wushuang and the others behind him, “They are after me. Third bro, you should take them run!”

“Leave you here and run away? What are you saying?” Jian Wushuang did not move and his gazes grew cold.

“No one can leave,” Gu Yan roared and the warriors from the Cosmos Empire rushed forward again.

“Kill them!” Jian Wushuang roared and was the first to rush forward. He fiercely fought with Gu Yan, who was the strongest among them.

Baili Chen, Su Rou, and the others also moved.

War broke out again.
