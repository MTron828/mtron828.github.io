Failed to live up to the expectations of Qishen.

Speaking of this, Bai Yi started talking again. The last words of Qishen, back in the day, entrusted him with taking care of the surviving seniors. Now, he has to trouble Guanzmu Tianzun, which is a great disrespect to Qishen.

Even Guangmu, unyielding as he is, couldn’t help shedding hot tears upon hearing this.

In ancient times, Qishen was truly unparalleled.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

When Guangmu was weak, his hometown was destroyed, and he wandered into another realm. The first force he joined was the sect under Qishen’s command.

He later became the sect master and eventually entered the service of Qishen.

He had always been proud to be the true direct descendant and the core of Qishen.

But now, the atmosphere inside the Qishen Temple is so uneasy; how can he turn a blind eye to it?

He stood up immediately.

“Brother Bai Yi, these years have been tough on you!” Guangmu’s eyes were very sincere.

Bai Yi didn’t know if he was truly moved or if the grievances in his heart were too great, but he also burst into tears.

Two peerless powerhouses, the pinnacle figures in the Qishen Temple, two big men cried like little girls.

Their bond gradually deepened over time, and they talked for a long time before slowly getting up.

“l never expected that such a thing would happen in Flowing Province, hunting down inheritors. It seems that this force is deeply hidden in the Four Great Secret Realms!” Guangmu’s eyes changed, regaining a sharp look. Bai Yi paused before speaking, “Ah, it’s all my fault for not taking good care of the Four Great Secret Realms over the years. So many troubles have arisen.

That force is like a shadow; no matter how hard we try, we can’t eliminate it.”

He had been investigating that force for years, setting up the Tianzi No.l secret script. Unfortunately, every time he was about to discover the truth, it would suddenly disappear from the world. No matter how many powerhouses he mobilized to investigate, it was always in vain.

The Shadow Sect in the Earthly Realm, the Ghosts in the Heavenly Realm, and the Divine Master Cult in the Human Realm.

None could be completely eradicated; they were like a persistent patch.

On the surface, these people might appear to be high-ranking members of various sects, but in secret, they were members of different organizations. After investigating for such a long time, he had identified two tier 6 Emperors, but no matter how much he pressured them or even probed their memories, he couldn’t uncover the mastermind behind them.

Their memories had been severed by the person behind them.

No clues could be found at all.

Guangmu Tianzun shook his head and consoled, “It’s not your fault. I’ve heard a rumor. When the Four Great Secret Realms were built, many different beings were suppressed underground, including some formidable ones. Perhaps these alien races are causing trouble behind the scenes.”

The construction of the Qishen Temple almost tore apart a considerable section of the river of time, causing the destruction of several universes.

Of course, these destroyed universes belonged to some alien races.

Bai Yi nodded in agreement, saying, “l thought of that too initially. However, according to the list left by the master, there were no abnormalities in the areas where they were suppressed. They shouldn’t have escaped! Could it be that someone among them broke through?”

Thinking of this, the two exchanged glances, a chill running down their spines.

If that were the case, this matter was not a trivial one.

“This pursuit of the successor is an opportunity for us to investigate,” Guangmu decided.

The previous group’s goal was to establish communication between the Four Great Secret Realms and then spread news about the God’s Tomb.

Now, for the successor, it was likely a different group of people.

Perhaps this was an excellent opportunity.

For them to break through the barrier, they had never been this crazy before. Now, for a Dao Lord successor, they were going to extremes.

Easily slaying a tier 6 Emperor indicated at least pinnacle strength.

Even Wuzuo’s avatar had been killed, showing a strength comparable to

Guangmu’s.

Someone this powerful was making a move.

Perhaps they would soon unravel the truth behind the scenes.

“Let’s go!’

The two immediately left the main hall.

Bai Yi was secretly delighted, not expecting that Guangmu would indeed join the fray.

In Zhangzhou, there was only one city, established by outsiders, located near the border of Zhangzhou and Liuzhou.

Through Jian Wushuangs aura, Bai Yi communicated with the headquarters of the Heaven Realm’s Divine Temple, quickly pinpointing Jian Wushuangs location.

Now, he was frantically fleeing towards Zhangzhou.

However, Yang Sanmu from the Elder Palace was not with Jian Wushuang at the moment. Now, Jian Wushuang was on the run alone, being pursued by others.

“The people from the Tianmoo Sect!” Bai Yi looked at the information on the identity token and took note of this super sect.

To ordinary people, the Tianmo Sect was a super sect, but for him, a sect that could be wiped out by a single incarnation was considered insignificant even in ancient times.

After this incident, he vowed to annihilate the Tianmo Sect.

“Brother Guangmu, we’ll hide here. I’ve already figured out the identity of the person in Liuzhou. He’s an old and familiar character. Based on their speed, if we wait in this city, we definitely won’t go wrong,” Bai Yi said confidently.

At the same time, he also dispatched a group of elite warriors from the White Tiger Temple, all of whom he had supported and nurtured.

Over the years, he had cultivated many elite warriors, and there were still quite a few outstanding talents among the Four Great Secret Realms.

He didn’t have many treasures that were too heaven-defying, but he had a lot of treasures for nurturing Emperors.

Controlling the Four Great Secret Realms, except for Zhu Yi, he was the wealthiest.

Moreover, Zhu Yi’s treasures were not truly hers.

If one were to consider personal treasures, he was the wealthiest.

Every day, the amount of divine stones he earned through the teleportation array was astronomical.

Over the years, not to mention the accumulated wealth, he had treasures and hidden treasures from various places that he couldn’t even exhaust.

If it weren’t for frequent disturbances in various regions, his treasures would never be spent.

Once, he directly dispatched five peak-level tier 6 Emperors, each a formidable powerhouse capable of rivaling the top experts.

This was an extremely secretive force, with each member having their own sects. They wouldn’t usually contact him, but in the face of major emergencies, they would disguise their identities and rush to his aid.

Swoosh!

In less than 15 minutes, this inconspicuous city was suddenly graced by the presence of five peak-level experts.

Normally elusive tier 6 Emperors, all gathered at this location.

However, the inhabitants of the city remained oblivious to the presence of these tier 6 Emperors. The strongest individuals within the city were nothing more than ordinary tier 5 Emperors.

These five tier 6 experts, each concealing their identities with wide, thick

black robes from head to toe, had significantly altered their auras.

Seeing Bai Yi on a loft in the city, they nodded in acknowledgment, then took their seats in a tea house opposite the loft.

Five peak-level Emperors, along with his own avatar and Guangmu Tianzun personally overseeing the situation.

Even if the opponent possessed unparalleled strength, they would have to stay today.

Now, they just needed the bait to bring that heavy rain.

Buzz!

As soon as they took their seats, a terrifying aura emanated from the teleportation array. Two tier 6 Emperors, accompanied by over a hundred tier 5 Emperors, abruptly emerged..
