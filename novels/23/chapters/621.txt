Chapter 622: Xue Feng

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“You are Sword Emperor?” The red-robed woman standing in front of Jian Wushuang asked in a voice tinged with excitement.

“Lady Red, the scarlet scythe, you are Xue Feng?” Jian Wushuang stared back at the red-robed woman.

After three days of frenzied killing, strong experts had risen to fame.

Everyone now knew Jian Wushuang as Sword Emperor. His strength was acknowledged on this battlefield and he was ranked in the top 30.

Xue Feng had also become an expert during the three days. She had comprehended the Raging Fire Dao and her strength was extremely terrifying. She had killed at least hundreds of Skyscraping Realm and was ranked in the top 30.

“These three days, I’ve killed more than 300 Skyscraping Realm, but their strength was mediocre, so I could beat them easily. But now, meeting you, finally...” Xue Feng licked her lips and said, “Hope you are good enough to challenge me!”

“I feel the same,” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly, his eyes reflecting his strong battle intent.

He had also killed numerous Skyscraping Realm in the last three days but no one had caught his attention.

Now, he had finally met a decent opponent. Deep down, Jian Wushuang was full of anticipation for the fight.

“Let’s start!”

Xue Feng blinked and transformed into a Blood Shadow which flew through the Void. Her speed was so fast that ordinary Skyscraping Realm experts would only see a shadow.

The Blood Shadow suddenly popped up in front of Jian Wushuang and the scarlet scythe hacked towards him.

The scarlet scythe looked like a beautiful scarlet moon as it split the Void and rushed towards Jian Wushuang.

The tremendous power compressed the air and produced successive explosions.

“So powerful,”?Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Although he hadn’t fought against the scarlet scythe, he could sense its great power based on this attack. Fortunately, they were in the Eternal World. If this had happened in the Ancient World, the scarlet scythe would have split the Void into two parts.

Jian Wushuang proceeded with caution. His killing intent surged and his Heart-killing Sword was shaken because it sensed a strong opponent nearby. Jian Wushuang started his first attack.

His sword impaled the Void, boom~ ~ an immaterial wave spread out.

The first level of the advanced Secret Skill, Heaven-breaking Technique!

Jian Wushuang’s World Body had been cultivated in the World Prison with the support of Emperor Xiao for three years.

At the same time, with the guidance of Di Jing, his Slaughter Body had fought with thousands of ‘Crazy Demons’ in the Slaughter Zone. During those fights, his comprehension of Slaughter Dao had improved significantly and he had created his own Secret Skill.

The Heaven-breaking Technique which was created by his Slaughter Body had already reached the first advanced level.

Peng!

A loud bang made the battlefield tremble.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang and Xue Feng were forced to retreat because of the explosion.

None of them had an advantage in this round.

“The Sword Principle manual is great. Obviously your comprehension of the Slaughter Dao is not as good as mine, but the power of the Secret Skill that you have created is stronger than mine,” Xue Feng stared at Jian Wushuang with a hint of respect, “Sword Emperor, you are the only Skyscraping Realm expert who has managed to withstand?my previous attack in these three days. Now, I will try my best to fight.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang sneered, but deep down he thought,?“Xue Feng is indeed strong, but her strength is still not good enough to let my World Body join the fight. I can beat her with my Slaughter Body!”

Jian Wushuang’s two Original Bodies.

The Slaughter Body was weaker than the World Body.

Since the start of the first round, he had only fought with his Slaughter Body. Even for this encounter with Xue Feng, he didn’t plan to use his World Body.

“Let’s fight!”

Jian Wushuang and Xue Feng resumed their fierce fight.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

The two figures both transformed into shadows. They flew through the Void with ease at extreme speeds.

Then they exchanged blows.

Xue Feng’s scarlet scythe transformed to three Blood Shadows and hacked towards Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang easily dodged the attack and then swept his sword light outwards with powerful killing intent.

As they fought, hundreds of huge holes appeared in the ground.

The loud noises from the fight also drew the attention of experts nearby, but they did not dare to approach closer to watch.

“Sword Emperor and Xue Feng?”

“The two of them are fighting now?”

“Both of their battle strengths are ranked in the top 30, so they can easily pass the first round. It’s not necessary for them to fight now.”

“Maybe they have been unbeatable in the Ancient World for a long time, so they are eager to have a fierce fight when they meet a worthy opponent.”

Many experts were discussing among themselves.

At this moment, in front of the numerous Mirror Images outside the battlefield.

“Number 315 image, Sword Emperor and Xue Feng are fighting!”

“Both of them can enter the second round. They are definitely the top Ancient World warriors this time. Since they are fighting now... record the Mirror Image carefully, don’t miss any details.”

The cold voice issued the command and the fight was completely recorded by the Mirror Image.

On the battlefield, the two experts were still fighting to death and both were evenly matched.

“I’ve exploited the Dao comprehension well, but I still can’t defeat him or even take any advantage!” Xue Feng frowned.

Jian Wushuang had a cold expression on his face as he thought,?“Xue Feng is much stronger than all the other Skyscraping Realm experts I have met. If I want to defeat her with my Slaughter Body, I should either use the Spiritual Power or Physical Power which are much stronger than the average level, or... I need to use that trick!”

Jian Wushuang pondered over his options.

He had cultivated the Heavenly Creation Skill, so he had a perfect foundation which made his Spiritual Power and Physical Power much stronger than the ordinary Skyscraping Realm. This was his biggest advantage. However, Emperor Xiao had cautioned him against showing his perfect foundation, so he couldn’t really use it.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
