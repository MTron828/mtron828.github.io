Chapter 1354: Fairies Meeting

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Disciple from Star Palace?”

The long-haired middle-aged man who was like a statue finally opened his eyes. There was a flash of purple light in his eyes, just like a purple gemstone.

“There are only a few disciples from Star Palace in the Lineage of Star. Since when do we have another one?” The long-haired middle-aged man spoke with a low voice.

“He said that he passed through the test passed down from Star Foggy Sea in his hometown. He has yet to become the disciple of Star Palace,” the elderly in white robe said.

“Star Foggy Sea?” The long-haired middle-aged man creased his eyebrows, “Would that be the one that the Palace Master left behind?”

Then, the long-haired middle-aged man replied to his message and asked.

Soon, there was an outcome.

“I asked the Palace Master. He did leave it in Star Foggy Sea and he felt it was not long ago that there was someone who passed the test. It should be this Universe God. Oh yeah, what’s the young man’s name? Which level is he in?” The long-haired middle-aged man asked.

“His name is Jian Wushuang. He is a Universe God in the First Heaven now and the message he sent showed that he was on the other side of Ancient Star Sea. He came from a place called Snow Kingdom. He just arrived at the East Royal Sanctuary,” the elderly in white robe replied.

“The other side of Ancient Star Sea? That would require him to pass through two dangerous places, Ancient Star Sea and the boundless void. He, who is just a Universe God in the First Heaven could pass through them? Not bad. He lives up to his reputation as a genius who passed through the test that the Palace Master set up,” the long-haired middle-aged man smiled faintly and immediately gave a command, “Tell Vientiane Tower to send him a reply that we of the Lineage of Star are going to send an expert to receive and lead him immediately. We should arrive within ten years’ time and tell him to wait right there.”

“Yes,” the elderly in the white robe responded. He then turned around and left.

The long-haired middle-aged man muttered to himself, “The elderlies in the Lineage of Star have work on hand. Who should I send to bring the young man over?”

“Oh yeah!”

The long-haired middle-aged man exclaimed and sent a message out.

Soon enough, a handsome man in a loose black robe appeared in the cave dwelling.

“Yuan, are you looking for me?” The handsome man looked calm. Even though the long-haired middle-aged man was a highly positioned person in Lineage of Star, second to the founder of Lineage of Star, which was the Palace Master, the handsome man could call him by his name directly.

The long-haired middle-aged man smiled and said, “I have something for you to handle.”

“What is it?” The handsome man looked rather cold.

“Head over to East Royal Sanctuary. There’s young man from Lineage of Star, he is also a disciple from Star Palace. He just got there from his hometown after going through some difficulties. He just sent a message to request us to send an expert to bring him.” The long-haired middle-aged man said.

“That simple?” The handsome man creased his eyebrows, “For such a simple task, you could have sent any deacon elderly to get it done.”

“Although that’s true, our deacon elderly have tasks on hand and they couldn’t free themselves from them. On top of that, the young man passed through the test that Palace Master set up then became a disciple from Star Palace. He was not ordinary. I want you to see him and instantly determine his power.”

“Besides, most importantly…” The middle-aged man paused and looked at the handsome man. “All these years, you have been wandering at that place and you finally came back. You should be relaxing, don’t stress yourself out.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Fine, I’ll go,” the handsome man didn’t say much but left right after he agreed.

The middle-aged man noticed and let out a sigh.

…

East Royal Sanctuary, in Vientiane Tower.

Jian Wushuang had been waiting for two days and the Vientiane Tower’s attendant, the beautiful lady came in.

“Mister, the message that you sent earlier, there’s a reply,” the beautiful lady smiled.

“What did they say?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The Lineage of Star replied that they already sent an expert over. He should be here within ten years. They told you to wait here for the time being,” the beautiful lady smiled and said.

“That’s great.” Jian Wushuang was beaming with joy.

“As your matter has been taken care of, go ahead and do as you please,” the beautiful lady said and left.

Jian Wushuang left the Vientiane Tower soon and found a place to stay temporarily.

“Jian Wushuang, in another ten years, you will enter Lineage of Star officially. When you arrive at Lineage of Star, your talent could be put to full play,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Ten years…” Jian Wushuang clasped his hands together and he was looking forward.

Eight years passed by very quickly.

But in the ninth year…

“Have you heard? The fairies meeting that happens once every ten thousand years in this Blood Jade Land just started.”

“I heard about it long ago. It’s one of the highest standard meeting of Blood Jade Land. I heard that many top geniuses participate. For instance, Universe Gods who are famous from Purple Heart Mansion are all taking part in it.”

“Tsk tsk. The fairies meeting is a great opportunity to rise to the top. It’s a pity that I’m too weak. Otherwise, I’d like to give it a try too.”

In the hotel, many cultivators were gathered there but they were all talking about the fairies meeting.

In one of the corners in the hotel, Jian Wushuang was drinking quietly while he listened to their discussion.

“Fairies meeting?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

The fairies meeting should be something similar to the Firmament Territory Feast that he came across when he stepped foot in Green Fire World. It was something for all parties to select geniuses.

To those geniuses, it was really a place for newcomers to come to prominence. It was a great opportunity to rise to the top.

However, the fairies meeting was obviously much grander in scale.

Jian Wushuang found out from King of Venomous Worms that the entire East Royal Sanctuary was extremely huge, bigger than any kingdom. East Royal Sanctuary was segregated into nine pieces of land. In every land, there was the existence of various mansions. It was a structure on the surface but there were various powers between every mansion, which was fairly complicated.

For instance, he was currently in Purple Heart Mansion on the Blood Jade Land in East Royal Sanctuary.

In the Blood Jade Land, besides Purple Heart Mansion, there were a hundred and eighty-seven other mansions. Every mansion had countless cultivators, which meant that naturally, there would be countless geniuses.

“Jian Wushuang, the fairies meeting sounds great. Do you want to give it a try?” King of Venomous Worms casually said.

“I? I am already a disciple under Lineage of Star. It’s not necessary,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

If he didn’t become a disciple under Lineage of Star, it would really be a good choice to join the fairies meeting for him to come to prominence after he arrived at East Royal Sanctuary. However, just then it was really unnecessary.

“Regardless, head over and take a look. You just got to the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, you should see more of the geniuses here. It’d be beneficial for you too,” King of Venomous Worms said.
