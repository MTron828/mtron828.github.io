1926 Emperor Thirteen

Jian Wushuang was truly a sword cultivator.

He possessed high comprehension level in Sword Principle.

Then, when he saw the sword principle that the arrogant man in the white robe had performed, Jian Wushuang could only feel a brand new sword principle appeared before him.

He had never thought that a stroke of sword could make all living things in the universe, including spacetime, disperse.

A sword was a sword after all, a sharp weapon to kill enemy.

But then… a sword wasn’t as simple.

The experts at the scene were attracted by the sword principle that the arrogant man in the white robe had used.

The sword light was like the core of the universe.

Looking at the sword light, there was a burst of light from Emperor Bai’s eyes. Then, his face grew solemn as well.

Rumble. There was an aura that soared up from Emperor Bai.

The aura was overlooking everything in the universe.

It was an aura that was high above the masses. It belonged to the strongest person in the universe.

Emperor Bai was an expert in Eternal Chaotic World, it was an aura that belonged to him.

At the same time, a huge golden shadow appeared from his body.

The golden shadow was a golden Emperor.

He was ninety nine thousand zhang tall and three thousand zhang broad. His golden eyes looked at everything as though it was nothing. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

His gaze looked as though the universe should yield to him.

Emperor Bai attacked.

He slowly lifted his slender arm, then he clenched his fist tightly and punched.

The golden Emperor shadow punched too.

His punch was powerful enough to push away Chaotic.

However, regardless of if it was Emperor Bai’s punch or the arrogant man’s sword light, there was no overflow of power.

It felt so ordinary. The power control of both parties were at a shocking level.

Then, the two parties collided directly.

Once they collided, boundless power swept out.

The surrounding tens of billions of miles were engulfed by boundless power.

However, even though the power was appalling, there wasn’t any loud bang, only noises that were made of compressing energy.

The experts who were watching from afar thought they were far enough away. However, when the two attacks collided and let out their true power, boundless power affected them too. There was a strong gale that could tear the sky and no one could open their eyes under such strong wind.

If there was one who could open his eyes, that’d only be Purple Moon Emperor.

Purple Moon Emperor then looked terrified.

“Too strong, too strong!”

“Merely the power of the peripheral was already so strong, just how strong could the core power be?”

Purple Moon Emperor muttered. As a Great Emperor, he couldn’t see the core scene on the battlefield. However, merely the power of the subsidiary was terrifying enough.

He knew that if he were to be in the core of the battlefield with his power, he wouldn’t be able to survive under such terrifying power.

Vroom. A terrifying power lasted for more than a dozen breaths and finally dispersed.

The surrounding experts then opened their eyes and looked at the core of the battlefield.

At first glance, everyone felt their scalps go numb as though everything was going to explode.

On the battlefield, the void covering hundreds of millions of miles disappeared entirely.

Everything vanished.

There was only boundless darkness and a terrifying black hole that swallowed everything.

The black hole was still expanding at a terrifyingly fast speed.

“Spacetime disappeared?” Jian Wushuang muttered.

In the expanse hundreds of millions of miles, everything turned into nothing in an exchange of blows.

The outcome of the battle between Emperor Bai and the arrogant man in the white robe.

Scary!

Such terrifying battle power was unbelievable to Jian Wushuang.

Maybe only the scene that he was seeing before the huge coffin in the independent space in the Eighth Lair, the scene of ancient war could compare with its power favorably.

“Too powerful!”

The surrounding people exclaimed in surprise. Every one of them was in unprecedented shock.

In the expanse that turned into nothing, at the location in the middle, there were two figures that towered there.

“To be able to take one of my strokes, you’re not too shabby,” the arrogant man in the white robe looked at Emperor Bai but his gaze remained cold.

Emperor Bai squinted his eyes but he looked solemn.

With one exchange of blows, he obviously could tell how powerful the other party was.

Forget about the fact that it was the second era, even if it were the first era, no one would be that powerful.

Just like the supreme experts from the first era, Sword Emperor Dugu was known to be the first in Sword Principle in the first era. However, in Emperor Bai’s eyes, even Sword Emperor Dugu at his peak wasn’t as scary as the mysterious arrogant man in the white robe in front of him.

“The first era collapsed many years ago and only I survived. I am much stronger than before. If Sword Emperor Dugu appears in front of me again, I am confident enough to defeat him. However, the person in front of me, I am not sure at all!”

“This person…” There was a commotion in Emperor Bai’s heart.

“You are Emperor Bai, right?”

The arrogant man in the white robe’s voice rang again, Although you’re only of Chaotic Realm, to explode power far beyond Chaotic Realm under the circumstance of being restrained, you are qualified to know my name. Listen, my name is… Emperor Thirteen!”

“Emperor Thirteen?”

“The mysterious expert’s name is Emperor Thirteen?”

There were countless experts who were impressed and also remembered the name in their hearts.

The owner of the name was a super expert that could fight against Emperor Bai directly.

Emperor Bai’s face was cold but he didn’t speak.

He had never heard of Emperor Thirteen. He had never heard of it after the first era. Hence, there was no doubt that Emperor Thirteen was definitely from ancient times!

“The secret skill that you just performed, although it was powerful, it is a pity that it isn’t complete. I happen to have the complete set of the secret skills. If you want it, I can give it to you,” Emperor God Thirteen said coldly.

Emperor Bai’s gaze was fixed.

“Of course, the condition would be that you have to look after this little guy for me for the time being. For no time. Ten thousand years at most,” Emperor Thirteen pointed at Jian Wushuang behind him.

“Sure,” Emperor Bai nodded.

Then, Emperor Thirteen’s cold face revealed a faint smile. He then turned and vanished into thin air.

“This is…” Emperor Bai saw and his eyes dilated in shock, “It’s consciousness embodiment!!!”
