Vroom!

He waved and a large dark cloud pressed at Jian Wushuang.

The dark cloud covered the sky and the power that it contained was far stronger than an Emperor God.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were bloodshot while a terrifying sword intention swept out from his body. Among his eighteen arms, there were four that were holding a sword at the same time.

The swords were naturally Blood Mountain Swords.

Then, Blood Mountain Sword was roaring for blood in madness. It contained boundless unyieldingness.

“King Sword Principle, first move!”

“Slash!”

He was just like a monarch high and above as he raised the sword in his hand.

When the sword slashed, there would be hundreds of millions of heads that would fall to the ground.

Kuang!

A terrifying sword light was instantly magnified and engulfed tens of thousands of miles when it was slashed out.

The sword light was shimmering in gold, looking rather eye-catching.

It immediately hit the dark clouds above that were pressing down.

Hong!

The sword light pierced it.

Then, the large dark cloud immediately dispersed.

“Huh?” Abysmal Saint Master looked at Jian Wushuang in shock.

He could tell that Jian Wushuang’s power had reached the level of a Great Emperor.

He had never used the Secret Skill of Star Palace nor did he break any ancient star. But his sword principle itself had reached such level?

Of course, the King Sword Principle was originally fierce. As Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of sword principle increased, the power of his sword principle naturally became even stronger.

The stroke was Jian Wushuang’s strongest stroke.

After that stroke, although Abysmal Saint Master’s attack was blocked, Jian Wushuang didn’t let loose but he flicked his wrist and a scroll painting appeared in his hand.

Then, he threw the scroll painting in the air and the scroll painting blended into the void. Suddenly, the sky above immediately churned.

A captivating world of mountain and river appeared in the sky.

“Mountain river as palm and nine-province as seal!”

“The Third Move, Overwhelm the Rain!”

Rumble.

A vast land descended mightily.

With Jian Wushuang’s power, he performed the seal of Overwhelm The Rain without holding back. The power of the descending land barely reached the threshold of a Great Emperor.

Looking at the descending land, Abysmal Saint Master’s gaze was cold and a few dark lights suddenly burst out.

Hong! Hong! Hong! Hong!

A few dark lights piercing the land and the entire lofty land immediately shattered into a few pieces.

“Boy, your skills are not too shabby. However, too bad, it’s useless,” Abysmal Saint Master’s voice was cold.

Jian Wushuang’s face grew dim.

King Sword Principle!

Nine-province Seal, the third seal.

They were both his strongest attack skills.

However, even though he had performed with his all, he had barely reached the threshold of a Great Emperor. Compared to a true Emperor, he was nowhere near one.

Just then...

“Abysmal, what are you doing? Why don’t you hurry up and suppress that boy?” There was a low bellow from the surrounding battlefield.

The one who had spoken was naturally Great Emperor Colored Glaze.

Great Emperor Zi Xu and herself were held back by the five godly spirits and Jian Yi. In a short time, it would be difficult to defeat their opponents.

The only breaking point was with Abysmal Saint Master.

Only if Abysmal Saint Master suppressed Jian Wushuang and then he had an extra hand to join forces with them, Jian Yi and the five godly spirits could be defeated in an instance. By then, the battle would end.

However, Abysmal Saint Master had yet to take Jian Wushuang down since the beginning of the war.

Hearing Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s roar, Abysmal Saint Master’s corner of his lips twitched. He couldn’t help but resented.

However, he couldn’t do anything to Jian Wushuang. He was a top Great Emperor on the top three on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. Even though he had yet to recover fully from his injuries, he was still much stronger than many other Great Emperor. He was far beyond Jian Wushuang as well.

Most importantly was that he held scruples when he fought with Jian Wushuang.

He was afraid that he might kill Jian Wushuang by accident if the hit was too powerful.

Hence, he held back when he attacked.

But in the end, because he held back, he couldn’t take down Jian Wushuang.

“Son, look at how I am going to trap you in!”

Abysmal Saint Master’s voice was cold but he had finally revealed his true power.

There was boundless darkness that swept over and formed a huge black chain. The black chain was extremely sturdy but they extended from all corners of the void without any symptoms, especially in the void around Jian Wushuang. There were dark whirlpools that appeared from nowhere. The black chains were moving to entangle Jian Wushuang simultaneously. Jian Wushuang’s face changed and the sword lights continuously swept out from him. His fighting power exploded to its extreme limit, he wanted to break apart those chains that were flying towards him.

However, the chains were too flexible, too fast and too plentiful.

One slash after another extended over again and again.

In a short while, the black chains formed a huge prison to seal off the spacetime that Jian Wushuang was in.

It naturally trapped Jian Wushuang within as well.

“Sh*t!”

Jian Wushuang looked shocked and the sword intention swept out to slash the surrounding prison. However, no matter how he attacked, the black prison didn’t move.

When he performed King Emperor Skill again, it could only shake the dark cover but it was not enough to break it.

After Jian Wushuang was trapped in the darkness prison, Abysmal Saint Master had the free time to fight elsewhere.

Swoosh!

Abysmal Saint Master’s body moved and he obviously moved to where the other two battles were.

“Sh*t!”

Jian Wushuang suddenly thought and the seven ancient stars in-between his eyebrows lit up.

He knew that as soon as Abysmal Saint Master had the bandwidth to join other battles, he would be defeated.

Hence, he had to perform his trump card to break the darkness prison and keep Abysmal Saint Master occupied again.

He had two kinds of trump cards, the Secret Skill of Star Palace and the Star Destruction Skill.

The Secret Skill of Star Palace was extremely important but it had yet to reach the time to really perform it.

He naturally could only perform Star Destruction Skill.

Just as Jian Wushuang was preparing to break his ancient star to increase his power...

“Hehe, it’s so noisy here.”

There was a burst of faint laughter from the nearby void.

The voice contained a special power. When it spread over to the battlefield, everyone who was fighting ferociously stopped instantly.

Abysmal Saint Master, who had been hurrying to the other two battlefields, also stopped his footsteps to look at the direction of the source of the voice.

Jian Wushuang also looked in the direction of the source of the voice. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

In the void, there was an enchanting woman in a tight red robe leaping over.

Her footsteps were very slow but every step she took leaped over a very long distance. Merely after a few steps, she appeared on the battlefield.

The moment she appeared, her beautiful eyes looked at Jian Wushuang directly.

“Jian Wushuang, long time no see. Do you need help?”
