4666 Frost Crow Lady

The two figures, one old and one young, roamed the universe.

The universe was huge and the rules were uncountable. Although each Heavenly Domain coexisted, they were independent existences.

This naturally made it more difficult for Jian Wushuang and Old Master to find the clay idol.

From then on, their journey would no longer be counted in the thousands of years. The most optimistic estimate was that it would probably take a million years.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang was also a little curious. From the fight a million years ago, the Ancestor realm clay idol was ruthless and brutal. There was no reason for it to be isolated and not have any rumors about it.

Jian Wushuang was confident that even if the Ancestor realm clay idol only released its aura for a moment, he would be able to sense it instantly.

However, a million years had passed and the clay idol did not leak any aura. Jian Wushuang began to suspect that the clay idol had died or was sleeping. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

If it was the latter, Jian Wushuang could not imagine what kind of energy he was accumulating and what kind of damage it would cause to the Divine Power Universe.

Therefore, no matter what, he had to find and kill the Lu Ding clay idol within this one million years. Otherwise, when the Path of the Heavenly Gate ended, he would have to delay for a while.

With Jian Wushuang and Old Master’s speed, even if they searched countless star Fields and Domains in the next 10,000 years, they still could not find any aura of the clay idol.

However, in many Star Fields, he found some Void Masters who had almost exhausted their void power and were about to die.

After killing them mercilessly with a wave of his hand, the two of them continued to move forward.

None of the ancient Star Fields were left behind.

“Old Master, how long do you think it will take for us to find that clay idol?”

In a bustling market somewhere in the vast ancient world, Jian Wushuang and Old Master were sitting by the window in a teahouse.

Old Master took a sip of the tea on the table and said indifferently, “At least a hundred thousand years, perhaps a million years, and at most ten million years.”

“Why is it at most ten million years?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Old Master said, “Because when the time comes, his blood essence will dry up, and he won’t be able to hide it anymore.”

“That’s true, but it’s been quite a long time for us.” Jian Wushuang touched his chin and frowned, “I have to think of a way…”

While the two of them were chit-chatting, there was a rough noise in the market on the street.

Dozens of men in tight-fitting leather armors walked out from the corner of the street, each of them exuding a powerful cultivator’s aura.

And in the middle of these men, a prison cart wrapped in black cloth was being pushed forward.

Jian Wushuang, who was sitting by the window, used his divine power to probe and saw that there were nearly 30 to 40 thin and small bodies squeezed in the prison carriage. He unconsciously wanted to go forward and check it out.

Old Master said calmly, “This universe is so big that what’s happening now is just a flash in the past. Even if you save them, it’s meaningless.”

Jian Wushuang sat back in his original position. Old Master’s words made sense. These people were just a moment in reincarnation. Even if he saved them, he could not change anything.

Although this was what he imagined, his mind still followed the cultivators and looked over.

In the middle of the street, a group of more than ten people stopped. The burly man in the lead looked extremely tired, and there was even a hideous wound on his exposed left shoulder that had not yet healed.

With a ‘whoosh’, he directly lifted the black cloth on the prison carriage and revealed the contents inside.

Perhaps it was because of the light, but the prison carriage was restless.

More than 30 dark-skinned women with black wings on their backs looked at the cultivators in fear.

These bird-like women’s entire eyeballs were covered by a turbid membrane, and they could barely see anything. They lived in the deep mountains and swamps all year round and rarely came into contact with other living creatures even when they died.

After seeing what was inside the carriage, most of the cultivators’ eyes dimmed and they retreated without hesitation.

The eyes of a small group of cultivators lit up and they quickly began to chat.

“What’s the price?” some cultivators asked.

The brawny man in the lead said tiredly, “10 Heaven Crystals. Anyone who wants to bargain can get lost.”

The cultivators were reluctant to pay the price, but there were very few cultivators from the Frost Crow clan who would catch them. If they missed it, they did not know when they would find it again. In the end, they still handed over dozens of Heaven Crystals.

For low-level cultivators, things that could improve their bodies were far more important than a secret technique.

The heads of the Frost Crow clansmen had a pearl that could enhance the five senses, which was why they could be sold at a high price.

With the Heaven Crystal that contained extremely pure divine power in his hand, the muscular man ordered the others to open the carriage and quickly pick the women.

The burly man cut the skull of the chosen Frost Crow woman with his finger and took out a dark bead from her head. Then, he handed it to each cultivator.

Once the condensed pearl was removed, the Frost Crow woman would not be able to survive and would die immediately.

The petite figures in the prison carriage were also decreasing in number.

Just as the burly man was busy stripping the condensed beads, a slightly intimidating voice sounded from among the cultivators.

“I’ll buy the rest.”

As far as the eye could see, a young cultivator dressed like a Ranger squeezed through the crowd and walked over with a dozen Heaven Crystals.

The burly man glanced at him, then looked at the prisoner carriage and said, “There’s only one left. If you want it, 8 Heaven Crystals.”

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and gave him nearly 20 Heaven Crystals. “I want this one alive.”

The sturdy man raised his eyebrows and smiled. Many descendants of aristocratic families had their own hobbies, so he did not want to interfere too much.

He pulled the iron chain and dragged out the last scrawny Frost Crow lady. Then, he handed her to Jian Wushuang.

“These demon beasts are the most durable. You just need to feed them a mouthful of water and dry food for a few months,” the sturdy man added considerately.

However, at this moment, another impatient voice rang out, “I, Xiao Wang, want this last one.”

Jian Wushuang, who was about to leave, was surrounded by more than ten low-level cultivators.

A domineering and gloomy-looking young man in luxurious clothes quickly came in front of him and stretched out his hand to snatch the Frost Crow girl.

In the next moment, what welcomed the young man in luxurious clothes was a powerful and heavy kick.

With a miserable cry, the young man in luxurious clothes was sent flying before he could even release the energy in his body. His huge head and neck were almost kicked severed by the sheer force of the kick.

“Where did this wild dog come from?” Jian Wushuang said indifferently. Then, he left slowly with the lady from the Frost Crow clan. No one dared to stop him.
