Chapter 802: To Find Him!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Humph, few experts have the Cercis Token on Cercis Island. Jian Wushuang is from the Ancient World and came here from the Firmament Territory. He is a total stranger on this island. He couldn’t borrow or buy one. It must be because of his 10 consecutive victories in the Blood Battle Arena,” Lei Xin analyzed.

“With his strength, it’s easy for him to win 10 fights in a row in the Blood Battle Arena.”

Then he turned his furious eyes on an expert from the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion beside him, and demanded, “Go and find out who has won 10 fights in a row in the Blood Battle Arena recently. You’ve got to find him anyway.”

“Yes,” the expert replied and immediately went to investigate what Lei Xin had asked for.

As one of the six biggest forces on Cercis Island, the intelligence capability of the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion was excellent. And It didn’t take long for the results to be found.

“Swordsman who came to the Blood Battle Arena three days ago?”

“He defeated 10 superior Divine Realm experts in succession, one of whom possessed the battle strength close to the strongest Divine Realm expert! And he beat these experts with only one blow each! With such excellent swordsmanship, he must be Jian Wushuang.”

Then the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion found the mansion where Jian Wushuang had lived for the last three days.

Lei Xin went to the mansion himself, but when he got there, Jian Wushuang had already gone.

“He’s so smart.”

Lei Xin stood dumbfounded where Jian Wushuang had been not too long ago, his eyes gleaming sharply. “Don’t think I can’t find you!”

Then he called, “Protector Yu.”

A black-robed man who followed him immediately came forward and replied, “Yes, Elder Lei Xin.”

“Do you know the purpose of me calling you for this occasion?” Lei Xin asked while throwing the black-robed man a glance.

“Yes, rest assured, Elder. The tenant had left the mansion, but there are many remnants of his auras here. These are enough for me to trace him with my Secret Skill. As long as he hasn’t left Cercis Island, I’m sure I can find him,” the black-robed man responded with confidence.

In the Eternal World, there was a myriad of experts, as well as tons of kinds of Secret Skills.

Protector Yu was proficient in a very special Secret Skill for tracking. As long as a person left enough auras, he could use that Secret Skill to find out where the person was in a certain range.

After a while Protector Yu came to a conclusion.

“Elder Lei Xin, I’ve found out where he probably is. He’s still on Cercis Island. Come with me.” he said to Lei Xin.

Then he led Lei Xin to a specific direction on the island.

In an ordinary restaurant on the edge of the island, Jian Wushuang sat at a table, wearing a silver wicked mask. He had also changed into a white robe, and even his longsword on his back was now a huge axe instead. His temperament had become extraordinarily aggressive and domineering.

At first glance, he looked like a completely different person.

And he was sure that Su Ming would not recognize him when they met again.

“Heavenly Cloud Pavilion is like an overlord on Cercis Island. With their power, they could find my mansion as easily as drinking water. In all likelihood, Lei Xin has taken his men to my rented mansion by now.” Jian Wushuang speculated. And his face covered by the silver wicked mask was quite somber at the moment.

“I miscalculated!”

Jian Wushuang gripped the cup.

He had truly miscalculated.

He had no idea that Su Ming was not only publicly guarded, but that he had a lifesaving item on him, which worked automatically when he encountered a life-or-death crisis.

That kind of lifesaving item was priceless. It was the equivalent of giving its carrier an extra life.

Lei Xin could only get one of such precious items. And this one really saved his disciple’s life.

“After the assassination attempt, Su Ming will surely be more cautious. That will make it harder for me to kill him.”?

Jian Wushuang thought, squinting.

At this point…

BUZZ…

A band of mighty pressure suddenly came and covered the restaurant that Jian Wushuang was in.

“What’s going on?” Jian Wushuang wondered, looking up with a frown.

He saw two men coming slowly out of the void, and the front man, completely covered by Purple Thunderbolts, was clearly Lei Xin.

Jian Wushuang immediately realized that the mighty pressure that covered the whole restaurant emanated from Lei Xin.

Behind him was a man in a black robe. The man looked at Jian Wushuang with blazing eyes and laughed, “Elder Lei Xin, that man is the one you’re looking for.”

Lei Xin also turned his eyes on Jian Wushuang.

“Damn it!” Jian Wushuang’s face clouded at once.

He was not expecting that Lei Xin could find him even though he had deliberately disguised himself and changed his temperament.

“Heavenly Cloud Pavilion really has terrific means!”?Jian Wushuang sighed helplessly.

“Young man, do you think I can’t find you just because you wear a mask?”

Lei Xin’s angry voice echoed through the air like thunder, and it carried a Sound Wave Attack that came directly at Jian Wushuang.

Knowing he was already exposed, Jian Wushuang no longer bothered hiding. With a move, he was already in the void, right in front of Lei Xin.

His mask had been removed and with the Emperor Sword in his hand, his temperament had returned to its former overwhelming sharpness.

“You’re worthy of being the Guest Elder of Heavenly Cloud Pavilion. You have such a brilliant skill to keep finding me.” Jian Wushuang sneered, without the slightest fear.

“Humph, my skill is beyond the imagination of a brat like you,” Lei Xin said in a stentorian voice, “Cut the crap. Now that you dared to assassinate my disciple, you must die today!”

As these words were spoken, a purple Stone Staff materialized in Lei Xin’s hand, which was circled around by a mess of Purple Thunderbolts. As Lei Xin swung it out, it struck at Jian Wushuang like a bolt.

Rumbling…

It looked as if the whole world was about to be split open by the attack.

That strike carried so much power that it would frighten an expert at Step Four of the Eternal Realm, not to mention a Divine Realm expert
