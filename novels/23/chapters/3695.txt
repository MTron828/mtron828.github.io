Chapter 3698: Number One in the Divine Beginning Realm

??

The Three Great Saint Realms had been destroyed.

This news was like a huge storm. In just a few days, it had swept through the entire Third Heaven, and even the entire Divine Beginning Realm.

The entire Divine Beginning Realm, countless forces, countless sects, and countless cultivators were all shocked by this news.

It could not be helped. To many people, this news was simply too shocking.

The Three Great Saint Realms...had been aloof in the Divine Beginning Realm for too long.

They were like three giants, looking down on everything.

The three lofty Saint Realm Masters were invincible existences in the hearts of almost everyone.

It was even rumored that the Three Saint Realm Masters were the representatives of the Heavenly Dao of the Divine Beginning Realm. They represented the Heavenly Dao of the Divine Beginning Realm.

However, just like that, the Three Great Saint Realms, which had three invincible masters of the Saint Realm, were completely destroyed. It was as if the Heavenly Dao of the Divine Beginning Realm had been completely reversed. It was simply too unbelievable.

Therefore, when many people first received this news, they scoffed at it and did not believe it at all.

It was not until later, when this news spread wantonly, and even the mirror image of the battle spread out, that this news was completely confirmed.

The Three Saint Realms had indeed been destroyed.

And the reason for this result was largely because of the existence of one person.

That person was Heavenly Sword Marquis!

100,000 years ago, he had killed a Principles Master as a saint realm expert. At that time, he had fought against a Saint Realm Master and was known as the number one genius in the history of the Divine Beginning Realm. At that time, Jian Wushuang revealed his talent, it was truly terrifying.

Countless people in the Divine Beginning Realm were shocked by his talent.

However, no matter how shocked they were, talent did not represent his true strength.

For example, there had been many amazing geniuses in the Divine Beginning Realm. These geniuses had shocked people for a time, but in the end, very few of them were able to walk on the path to the peak.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang’s existence at that time was only remembered by many people. Most sects and powers did not really take him seriously.

But now…

The super genius who shocked everyone 100,000 years ago had displayed incredible strength. He had killed three masters of the Saint Realm in the battle that destroyed the Three Saint Realms, at the same time, he had killed three masters of the saint realm experts who had been invited by the Three Saint Realms.

Such terrifying strength had truly shocked everyone.

After all, masters of the saint realm, including Rulers, were almost invincible in the Divine Beginning Realm.

This had long been recognized by everyone.

However, Jian Wushuang had killed three masters of the Saint Realm and Rulers at the same time. What did this mean?

It meant that Jian Wushuang’s battle strength in the Divine Beginning Realm was far stronger than that of a master of the saint realm, or even an ordinary Ruler. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It was certain that his battle strength in the Divine Beginning Realm was much stronger than the leaders of the three Freedom Alliances, including the Heaven-cleaving Alliance master, the Temporal Temple Master, and the Heaven Ancestor.

Therefore, after the battle, Jian Wushuang’s strength was recognized by countless cultivators as the number one person in the Divine Beginning Realm!

This matter was quickly spread to the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, the Temporal Temple, and the Heaven Ancestor Daoist Sect. However, neither the Heaven-cleaving Alliance master, the Temporal Temple Master, or the Heaven Ancestor came forward to refute, but chose to acquiesce.

It was very normal. First of all, these three people had a very good relationship with Jian Wushuang, and they were all on the same side.

Secondly, Jian Wushuang’s battle strength was indeed much stronger than the three of them in the Divine Beginning Realm alone, because they would be greatly restricted in the Divine Beginning Realm, but Jian Wushuang was not.

As for the Universe Battlefield, Jian Wushuang’s battle strength was also at the advanced Ruler Realm. Among them, perhaps only the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master could fight.

In that case, it was well-deserved to say that Jian Wushuang was the number one person in the Divine Beginning Realm.

The tacit agreement of the three Rulers completely confirmed Jian Wushuang’s title as the number one person in the Divine Beginning Realm.

Soon, the name of Heavenly Sword Marquis resounded throughout the entire Divine Beginning Realm.

This time, his fame and status in the Divine Beginning Realm had completely surpassed those ancient Rulers.

The number one expert in the Divine Beginning Realm, Heavenly Sword Marquis, was completely implemented.

…

The vast universe was boundless.

In a territory that was a certain distance away from the Divine Beginning Realm, although it was still at the edge of the universe, it was no longer a barren place in the universe.

There were hundreds of astral worlds in this territory alone, and there were a total of six grade two astral worlds.

One had to know that there was not a single grade two world star in the star domain where the Divine Beginning Realm was located.

Among the six grade two world stars, there was a world star that was surrounded by a large amount of black fog. It was like a Devil Cloud that was constantly rolling.

This star world was the Devil Cloud Star.

In front of the dark purple grand hall, there was a burly man who was over three meters tall. His hair was messy and his entire body was dirty. He was extremely slovenly. Behind him, there was a snow-white demonic wolf that was crawling on the ground.

The man and the beast were leaning against each other. They looked relaxed and satisfied.

“I wonder when this day will end.” The burly man muttered. He flipped his hand and took out a wine flask. He raised his head and took a big gulp.

However, he did not have the time to put down the wine flask.

“Hmph!”

A cold snort suddenly exploded in this world.

This cold snort carried a trace of anger.

Hearing this cold snort, the burly man jumped in fright. The wine flask in his hand almost fell out. He and the demon wolf immediately stood up.

“Tell the Ice Mist King that I will give him another thirty thousand years at most. If he does not meet my requirements within thirty thousand years, I will immediately flatten his ice mist astral world.” A cold and domineering voice sounded in this world.

“Yes, sir.” The burly man immediately bowed and accepted the order.

After the voice gradually disappeared, the burly man and the demon wolf beside him finally let out a sigh of relief.

“What’s going on? Didn’t the Star Master give the Ice Mist King 100,000 years? Why did he only give him 30,000 years?”

“According to what I know, the Ice Mist King has been following the Star Master’s orders all these years. Did he not disobey the Star Master’s orders?” The burly man muttered.

“Who knows. In any case, since the Star Master has given his orders, the Ice Mist King can only obediently follow them.” The Demon Wolf spoke in the human voice.

“Tsk tsk, 30,000 years. To meet such a requirement, the Ice Mist King is in trouble this time. I wonder why the Star Master is so angry.” The burly man smiled faintly.
