Chapter 5481 ¬†This World Is Vast

Jian Wushuang stood up, indifferent as he said, "1,000 taels of gold, quite a high price!"

"Big brother, what are you saying? With your skills, how could you be caught by the City Lord's Mansion's lousy men!" Liu San'er consoled.

He, however, paid no mind.

Just found it somewhat amusing. The last time he was wanted, it was in the Western Sea.

Back then, it was 100 billion godstones.

Thinking about it, Jian Wushuang seemed to understand something.

This scene seemed somewhat familiar.

Back then, he had Gong Miaoyi and Bai Junwang by his side, and now he had Thirteen Niang and Liu San'er.

Wasn't this too coincidental?

If it wasn't a coincidence, the one behind must know his details very well.

"Divine General Moyin shouldn't be so lame, right? So, which old monster planned all this?!"

The Demon-Sealing Space had been transformed like this, what was the purpose?

When passing through the first bridge, it corresponded to the soul. The second bridge, if he guessed correctly, tested the mind.

Jian Wushuang didn't think much more, turned around, and entered the house.

Those people outside wouldn't find him for a while, but with the guidance of the person behind him, it was only a matter of time.

Instead of benefiting others, it's better to give this 1,000 taels of gold reward to Thirteen Niang and Liu San'er.

Although he couldn't see through the intentions of these two, it wouldn't last too long.

He had only just met Liu San'er, who turned out to be a gambling rogue. Meanwhile, Thirteen Niang was a worldly woman. Who wouldn't be tempted by 1,000 taels of gold?

As Jian Wushuang pondered over other matters, Liu San'er followed suit and leaned in, whispering to him, "Big Brother, I think something's not right with that girl. How about..."

Liu San'er gestured by mimicking a throat-slashing motion.

Jian Wushuang displayed a slightly indulgent expression, nodding ever so slightly.

"Alright, I'll go buy some good meat. I still have some silver on me!" Liu San'er shouted, as if afraid others wouldn't hear.

After Liu San'er left, Thirteen Niang entered with a somewhat unpleasant expression. She said to Jian Wushuang, "Where did you meet Liu San'er!"

"At the gambling den!" Jian Wushuang replied.

Thirteen Niang's expression turned even more grim. She quickly walked over, grabbed Jian Wushuang, and started walking out, saying as they went, "Hurry, he must have gone to the authorities to report on you."

"You underestimate him too much!" Jian Wushuang pulled out his arm, coming to a stop.

Liu San'er was a gambler, faced with the choice between 1,000 gold and silver taels, he would surely choose the former, even if it meant taking a risk.

This time, he wasn't going to the authorities; instead, he was preparing to drug him.

What he didn't expect was that Thirteen Niang would actually warn him.

Could it be that the one orchestrating this wanted this woman to captivate him?

That would be underestimating his determination.

The debt of saving a life would be repaid!

If he could leave this place, he would spare no effort to meet her, pull her out of this timeline, and give her a chance at a new life.

But in this place, one plus one equals two; he wouldn't hesitate to act.

Even if it meant destroying this city, he would do it without hesitation.

"If you know what he's doing, why arent you running?" Thirteen Niang said in surprise.

Jian Wushuang shook his head and spoke, "Have you ever left this place?"

"No!" Thirteen Niang didn't understand what Jian Wushuang meant.

Indeed, she had never left. The outside world was a vast wilderness, and apart from leaving Qingshan City, she had nowhere else to go. The farthest she had been was to the outskirts.

"Have you ever thought about going to the outside world? This place is too small." Thirteen Niang narrowed her eyes, looking at Jian Wushuang and asked, "Are you suggesting that you want to take me away?"

"Yes!" Jian Wushuang nodded.

Thirteen Niang continued, "If we leave Qingshan City, where would we go?"

"Anywhere!"

The world is so vast; every place is a home.

Why confine oneself to a single flower?

Qingshan City is too oppressive; since he arrived, Jian Wushuang has not encountered anything good. The sky was gradually darkening, and he wondered what this mundane world had experienced in the past.

Without waiting for Thirteen Niang's response, Liu San'er returned with wine. He carried two jars of wine and held a few packages of snacks.

"Big brother, the wine is here!" He even exchanged a glance with Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang smiled knowingly.

It was time to hit the road.

Regardless of what these two thought, Jian Wushuang didn't blame them.

After all, being manipulated throughout their lives, they had no choice.

In the small courtyard, the three sat down.

There were not many words, and the atmosphere was as oppressive as the weather in the city.

"Come on, let's have a toast!" Jian Wushuang, sensing the tension in the air, slammed the bowl down, and took a sip.

Seeing Jian Wushuang drinking so heartily, Liu San'er smiled and raised his wine bowl, joining in.

Drinking, a pursuit that becomes more enjoyable the more you indulge. FOlloow ùíèewest stories at nùíê(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Not long after, two jars of wine were completely consumed.

Liu San'er's murderous intent surged as he glanced at Jian Wushuang. Suddenly, he stood up and, from behind, gripped Thirteen Niang's neck.

"You..." Thirteen Niang's face turned crimson from being choked. Despite her attempts to speak, she kicked over the table in resistance. After a short while, she ceased to react.

It was Liu San'er's first time killing someone. Even though Thirteen Niang showed no signs of life, he was reluctant to release his grip, fearing she might not be completely dead.

Jian Wushuang stood up, patted his shoulder, and said, "Enough, she's already dead!"

"Phew!" Liu San'er breathed heavily, releasing his arm.

Thirteen Niang turned around, falling to the ground face-up, staring with wide eyes.

Startled, Liu San'er plopped down on the floor.

Jian Wushuang crouched down, patted his shoulder, and then asked in a low voice, "Do you want to come with me, or do you want 1,000 taels of gold?"

Upon hearing these words, Liu San'er hastily retreated, looking at Jian Wushuang with fear.

Only now did he remember... Jian Wushuang should have fainted by now, right? Did the drug not work?

In Jian Wushuang's bowl, he wiped a layer of soft tendon powder.

"I..." Liu San'er didn't know how to respond. His recent actions had raised suspicions in Jian Wushuang's mind, and he was at a loss about what to do now.

Jian Wushuang looked at him and said calmly, "I understand. Come with me."

Then, holding Liu San'er, they left the small courtyard.

Outside the courtyard, dozens of constables had gathered. Seeing Jian Wushuang coming out, they drew their swords one after another.

"No need for trouble. Just give him the money! I'll go with you." Jian Wushuang threw Liu San'er directly to the ground.

The other party had made some moves, how could he not know? Even if he became a mortal, he wasn't a fool!

Any drug or poison in the wine he had just drunk was dissipated by Thought power as soon as it went down. How could he fall into the hands of a mortal?

Liu San'er got up from the ground, hastily threw himself at one of the constables, and pointed at Jian Wushuang, shouting, "It's him! He killed Li Si!"

The constable pushed him away, sneering, "Thanks for that."

As the words fell, a knife swung down, and Liu San'er's head rolled on the ground. The constable shouted loudly, "Jian Wushuang, I have now killed your accomplice. Surrender quickly!"

What a joke. 1,000 taels of gold‚Äîhow could it be shared with a gambler? Catching Jian Wushuang meant 1,000 taels of gold for them.
