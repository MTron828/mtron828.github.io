Chapter 1277: Shock

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

While Jian Wushuang was waiting on Leopard-print Island, the officers and the Universe Gods of Scarlet Island were in an uproar.

“What? One of our Divine Generals killed a Universe God?”

“Succeeded in a rank-skipping challenge? And killed his opponent?”

“Who is the Universe God that was killed? How powerful was he?”

“Zhuge Qiu from the Holy Prefecture? How could it be possible?”

Those Universe Gods were astonished upon receiving the news.

If it were a normal or weak Universe God that Jian Wushuang had killed, those officers would not have been so astonished, but it was Zhuge Qiu, an advanced Universe God in the First Heaven and near the peak of that realm.

Such a person was killed by a Universe Master?

“Are you kidding me?”

“Is it true?”

“We have such a super genius on our Scarlet Island?”

“It’s true.” The commander who brought the news to the officers smiled. “This Divine General is named Jian Wushuang and he has joined us not long ago. When he went to destroy the Red Water Alliance, he killed a Universe God of the alliance. But that was a weak Universe God who had just passed the God Test, so I did not pay much attention to Jian Wushuang at that time. Now, he has actually killed Zhuge Qiu on Leopard-print Island.

“I learned this from Universe God Qian Luan. Besides her, all the people on the island had witnessed it that day, including the cultivators and two Universe Gods from the Xiu State. I reckon that this news will spread throughout the entire region soon.

“There has never been such a Universe Master who could kill an advanced Universe God in the First Heaven in our history.”

The commander was excited as he spoke.

He was overjoyed to see such a genius on their island.

“But now, Jian Wushuang is in big trouble.” . The commander continued, “Before joining us, he had a grudge with the Holy Prefecture because he killed a core disciple of theirs. And because of that, Zhuge Qiu had tried to kill him this time.”

“A grudge with the Holy Prefecture?” Those Universe Gods all frowned at those words.

If it were in the past, they would not fear the Holy Prefecture at all and would gladly meet them head-on in a battle. But now, they were in a fierce battle with the Golden-sun Sect on the Nine Star Sea. If the Holy Prefecture stepped in at this moment, they would bring trouble as well.

“Man Yi.”

The commander received a message.

. “Yes, my lord,” the commander immediately answered.

The commander was in a high position among the entirety of Scarlet Island, and all the experts there addressed him as “commander”. Only one person would call him by his name—the Lord of Scarlet Island.

“I already know about this matter. Jian Wushuang is indeed a genius. Although he has just joined us, we should try our best to protect him as he now is one of us. Even if it is the Dayu Palace that he has offended, we should help him all the same.” The lord’s voice was majestic.

“I agree.” The commander nodded.

. “Where is Jian Wushuang now?” asked the lord.

. “He is still on Leopard-print Island with Qian Luan,” the commander immediately answered.

. “He has just killed Zhuge Qiu. The Holy Prefecture must be furious after learning about it and will have some experts to kill him. Send him a message telling him to come back now,” the lord continued.

“Understood, my lord.” The commander took the order.

He immediately sent a message to Jian Wushuang.

…

.

While the officers of Scarlet Island were astonished by Jian Wushuang’s power, the officers of the Holy Prefecture also received some news from the Xiu State.

From it, they all learned that Zhuge Qiu had been killed by a Divine General of Scarlet Island.

In a towering palace, a good 10 Universe Gods of the Holy Prefecture were gathered together with a milky-eyed, white-haired elder as their leader.

This elder looked like a fairy, but his aura gave off a feeling of chill and despair to all those who looked at him.

He was one of the four Mansion Masters of the Holy Prefecture—the famous Universe God Jiu Hai—a person who had passed two God Tests, as well as a Universe God in the Second Heaven.

.

Among the entire Dayu Region, there were no more than 20 Universe Gods in the Second Heaven, and Universe God Jiu Hai was one of them.

“Did you check it out?” Universe God Jiu Hai looked down with cold eyes.

. “Yes,” a Universe God standing above him answered. “The Divine General who killed Zhuge Qiu is named Jian Wushuang, and he is indeed a Universe Master who joined Scarlet Island not long ago.

“In addition, we have confirmed from the Xiu State that Jian Wushuang does have a grievance from our core disciples, and he also admitted to his crime. Zhuge Qiu had planned to bring Jian Wushuang back to our Holy Prefecture; however, Jian Wushuang is so powerful that he killed Zhuge Qiu with a rather strange strike.”

“A Universe Master killed a Universe God near the peak of the First Heaven?”?. There seemed to be a blazing flame burning in Universe God Jiu Hai’s eyes, and he then asked, “Who is the Core Disciple that Jian Wushuang had killed?”

The Universe God standing below him answered again, “We can’t tell who the disciple is from the grievance with Jian Wushuang, but according to what the expert of the Xiu State has said, the grievance is extremely strong, so that Core Disciple must have been killed not long ago. Recently, there is only one Core Disciple who has been killed—Jiu Xi, your personal disciple.”

“Sure enough!”

Universe God Jiu Hai’s aura became violent on hearing that answer. “Ever since Jiu Xi went to adventure in a Secret Land under Universe God Jin Feng’s invitation, she had been missing. I didn’t know that she was killed until I found her Life Core broken several days ago. I tried to ask Jin Feng her whereabouts, but he was killed as well.

“Since both of them are dead, I could do nothing more about it. It turns out that Jiu Xi did not die in that Secret Land but was killed by Jian Wushuang! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Now, he’s even killed another Universe God of our Holy Prefecture. He must die!!!” .
