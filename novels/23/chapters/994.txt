Chapter 995: The Sale

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“The Jiuqu Dragon Fruit has only limited uses especially for a Rank Three Dao Master such as him. It is most likely that he wants the Fruit to brew a Dragon Heart Elixir.” The Gu King continued.

“The Dragon Heart Elixir does not have much use for common warriors. But it is extremely useful to draconic Exotic Beasts.”

“This would imply that the Dragon Wing Governor possesses the bloodline of a tribe descended from dragons. He needs a Dragon Heart Elixir made of the extract of the Juqu Dragon Fruit to awaken the potential of the bloodline he bears..”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood finally as he smiled. “Things will be much easier if that’s the case.”

Jian Wushuang turned immediately towards the largest store in the Dragon Wing City.

It was called Wan Xuan Tower. Soon after he walked in, a steward came to greet him.

“How may I help you, Sir?” The steward, draped in robes of silver color asked with a smile.

“I have an elixir that I hope you will be able to help me sell.” Jian Wushuang spoke indifferently.

“An elixir?” The silver-robed steward’s eyebrows cocked, his interest fading rapidly. “Of course we can. But the items that we brokered to sell are normally extraordinary and valuable. Would you divulge the nature of your treasure, Sir?”

“It is a Dragon Heart Elixir. I wonder if it’s valuable enough for you.” Jian Wushuang produced a golden elixir as he remarked with feigned nonchalance.

“I-Is that… an Emperor-leveled elixir?” The steward got hardly believe his eyes as the sight of the extraordinarily rare elixir.

As was the classification of magical weapons, elixirs and concoctions were also divided into different levels.

Magical weapons are divided into Eternal- and Emperor-leveled magical weapons, whilst some elixirs of extreme rarity were classified as Emperor-leveled elixirs.

However, Emperor-leveled elixirs were very much rare than Emperor-leveled magical weapons, making these elixirs the highest grade in addition to being treasures of extreme rarity across the entire Green Fire World.

Yet even amongst all other Emperor-level elixirs, the Dragon Heart Elixir was still one of the most outstanding of medicinal brews ever.

“Do you have any requirements as to the manner of the sale, Sir?” asked the steward.

“You will only need to spread the word of my offer. Any interested prospects may come to me directly.” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Very good, Sir. And once the deal is done, you’d only need to pay us a thousand Divine Gems for our services.” said the steward in silver robes.

“Good.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “I heard that there’s a large arena in the city. I shall be staying there during my wait. Anyone who is interested in procuring the elixir can find me there.”

“Very good, Sir.” The Servant replied.

Completing his arrangements, Jian Wushuang headed to the arena.

The steward then immediately began spreading the word of the Wan Xuan Tower’s offer of the Dragon Heart Elixir for sale.

Still, the Dragon Heart Elixir was hardly an elixir for common remedies and use. Despite its powerful potency, it was an elixir sought only by those few who really required it.

Thus, the spread of the news did little to cause alarm in the Dragon Wing City.

However, the news of the Elixir resonated strongly with one person: the Dragon Wing Governor.

Sitting quietly within the fastness of a secret chamber in the Governor’s mansion, was a man with brown hair, handsome and stern, in his armor of black. He was seated upon the floor, cross-legged, and his eyes shut.

Strands of energies swirled around the man with brown hair; churning energies channeled by the man that laced with slivers of his Bloodline Power.

His skin burned as his powers stirred, channeling as he mustered his spiritual powers.

Sadly, it was a sensation that faded as swiftly as it came. The energies disintegrated into nothingness as everything simmered down.

The man opened his eyes, disappointed as his face paled from his exertions.

“I can’t. I can’t utilize my Bloodline Power. Even with the help of the Secret Skill, I still have troubles channeling the Power.”?The brown-haired man shooked his head, dejected. “I need a way to draw upon more of my Bloodline Power, that’s the only way.”

“A Dragon Heart Elixir, only a Dragon Heart Elixir can increase my Bloodline Power!”

“Alas… Long I have labored to accumulate the many ingredients for the brewing of a Dragon Heart Elixir. But still, I lack the Jiuqu Dragon Fruit? How long do I have to wait until it shows itself to me?”

The brown-haired man exhaled, his heart full of regrets.

The Secret Skill he had acquired was imperative to his success. When his training was done, he would be able to leap up into a whole new level. Still, he needed strong Bloodline Power to fully use the Skill, a requirement that he lacked severely. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Governor, I’ve got great news for you.” A message came suddenly.

“Great news?” The man’s face changed at once. Immediately he asked his servant, “What news? Have you found news about the Jiuqu Dragon Fruit?”

“No, Sir. It is news about a Dragon Heart Elixir! Right in this Dragon Wing City!” It was a warrior; one of his men who had come with the message. Even he was evidently excited about this news. “I had just received the news moments before. Someone had requested Wan Xuan Tower to broker the sale of a Dragon Heart Elixir!”

“What?” The brown-haired man was first stunned before rushes of joy and ecstasy surged within him. “Is it really a Dragon Heart Elixir?”

“It is true!” His subordinate confirmed.

“Hahaha! This is a good blessing indeed!” The Dragon Wing Governor’s eyes flashed with excitement.

Much he had spent: efforts, influence, and all other resources he could ever field in his painstaking forage for a Jiuqu Dragon Fruit,?all for the want of brewing a Dragon Heart Elixir.

Still, the rare Fruit remained elusive.

Through thick and fen he had delved in vain, yet now, someone had come with the offer of selling a Dragon Heart Elixir right before him?

“Where is this person now?” The brown-haired man eagerly asked.

Finding out that the person with the Elixir would be waiting at the arena in the city, the Governor set off immediately.

The arena of the Dragon Wing City was so huge that it occupied nearly a quarter of the city.

A large, empty space reigned in the center of the arena; the ring of sand where the slaves fought to their death to the amusement of the audience mob, who would watch the bloody carnage from their seats at the side of the ring.

Thrilled by the fights, the audiences would also place their bets on the bloodbath taking place within the ring.

The yearn for thrill and the hunger for bloodthirstiness prevailed over the entire arena.

Contrary to the fervor and delirium dominating the arena, Jian Wushuang lounged in a solitary chamber at the edges of the arena grounds, still clothed in crimson red as he sipped at his wine

A steward came to his door and spoke to him. “We have a patron from Guest Room 3 who requests your company, Sir.”

“So it begins…” Jian Wushuang mused, the edges of his lips curling into a smile.
