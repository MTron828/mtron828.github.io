Chapter 2955: Peak Stage One

——

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly. The Blood Mountain Sword in his hand moved the boundless sword tree, which was 33,000 feet tall, and instantly, a huge sword shadow slashed out. The sword shadow directly cut the giant earthy yellow palm into two halves.

The power of the Earth rules spread out in all directions.

“Oh?”

Star Sea Saint raised his eyebrows and looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise. “A divine master was able to block my attack head-on. No wonder you two worked together and killed the three Shadow Saints. However, your strength is far from enough.”

“I’ll give you one last chance. It’s still one million saint elixirs per person. Get lost immediately, or else…”

A cold light appeared in the Star Sea Saint’s eyes.

Xue Dong King’s expression changed, he said in a low voice, “Star Sea Saint Lord, are you forcing us?

“Humph, although you are the number one expert in the surrounding territories and a True Saint expert, I and the Heavenly Sword Marquis might be able to fight you.”

“Really?” A sneer suddenly appeared on the corner of Star Sea saint’s mouth. “Stupid, you underestimate me too much. Well, since you two want to die, I’ll fulfill your wish!”

As soon as he finished his words, Star Sea Saint moved.

At the moment he moved, a terrifying divine power burst out from Star Sea Saint’s body. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This divine power was shocking enough to change the color of heaven and earth.

“This divine power…” Jian Wushuang’s pupils suddenly shrank.

“Damn it!” Xue Dong King’s expression also changed greatly.

They all felt that the divine power emitted by the Star Sea Saint was not only superior to that of a False Saint but also extremely powerful among True Saints.

“Level two? No, he hasn’t reached the level of a level two True Saint yet, but he’s at least at the peak of level one. We’re in big trouble,” Xue Dong King said in a low voice.

“Peak of level one True Saint?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed.

They were both level one True Saints, but there were differences in strength.

Judging from the divine power of the Star Sea Saint, he was much stronger than the level one True Saint, Saint Hong, who had fought with him in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

Such strength…

“Xue Dong King, be careful!” Jian Wushuang shouted.

However, the Star Sea Saint was too fast.

As soon as he revealed himself, he had already appeared in front of Xue Dong King like a ghost.

Although Xue Dong King was shocked, he immediately reacted and waved the cyan long saber in his hand. The cyan long saber turned into a huge cyan phantom and directly slashed out with boundless divine power, Xue Dong King had already unleashed his strongest strength at this moment.

“Ridiculous.”

The Star Sea Saint sneered and slapped his palm forward.

This slap was like a huge world pressing down. The huge cyan phantom instantly dissipated, and even the cyan-colored long saber in Xue Dong King’s hand was sent flying.

“Puff!”

Xue Dong King spat out a mouthful of blood and shot backward in a sorry state.

With just one strike and one palm, Xue Dong King, who was at Peak False Saint realm and was infinitely close to the True Saint realm, was seriously injured.

“You have to die too!”

The Star Sea Saint’s eyes were filled with monstrous malice. After severely injuring Xue Dong King with one palm, he moved again and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Whoosh!

The same palm struck out from above and ferociously slammed down on Jian Wushuang.

Rumble! The endless power of the Earth’s rules immediately formed a towering mountain in the void and pressed down on Jian Wushuang.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang’s face darkened. “The power of the attack is so strong just by relying on divine power and the power of the earth’s rules.”

Although he was shocked, Jian Wushuang still waved his hand.

A shocking sword shadow wanted to tear the sky and earth apart, but it could not completely split the mountain. Then the towering mountain continued to crush Jian Wushuang.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang was also forced back, but his divine body was not damaged.

“Brother Heavenly Sword Marquis.”

Xue Dong King, who had already retreated far away, immediately looked at Jian Wushuang.

“I’m fine. Don’t worry about me. Stay away from me. Leave this guy to me,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Leave him to you?” Xue Dong King could not help but be startled.

The Star Sea Saint did not make a move, but the moment he did, he was immediately frightened.

The battle strength of a True Saint at the peak of rank one was too terrifying for him to contend with.

In his opinion, even if he and Jian Wushuang joined hands, the possibility of fighting against the Star Sea Saint was slim.

But now… Jian Wushuang wanted him to fight against the Star Sea Saint alone?

Was that possible?

“A True Saint at the peak of the first rank is a good opponent.” Jian Wushuang looked at the star sea saint with excitement in his eyes.

He really wanted to fight with a real expert.

Only by fighting with experts could his strength increase and become stronger.

However, most of the cultivators he met were too weak. For example, in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s assessment, his strongest opponent was only a Peak False Saint. He could not force out his true strength.

Now that a powerful True Saint at the peak of rank one was born in front of him, he naturally did not want to miss it.

“I want to see how strong you are as the number one expert in this territory,” Jian Wushuang said coldly. The surging divine power on his body slowly rose.

“Battle intent?” Star Sea Saint looked at Jian Wushuang with a strange expression.

He admitted that Jian Wushuang was not weak. During the fight, Xue Dong King was seriously injured by his attack, but Jian Wushuang was not injured at all.

But that did not mean that a Divine Master could fight him head-on?

“I’m also looking forward to what tricks you can play,” Star Sea Saint sneered, not taking Jian Wushuang seriously at all.

The majestic golden divine power on Jian Wushuang’s body began to condense, and in the blink of an eye, a 30,000-meter-tall Golden Emperor Phantom appeared behind him. The Golden Emperor’s eyes were cold as he looked down at everything in the world.

At the same time, his aura also soared, and a layer of dark golden armor appeared on his body.

Seven-star secret skill, divine punishment, nine luminaries star armor… The three secret skills had been used at the same time.

Jian Wushuang’s strength reached its peak in an instant.

“Splash!” A huge blood-red river gushed out.
