The ordinary cultivators in Snow Scared World had heard what the Taoist-robed woman said and they didn’t find it strange but the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom’s heart skipped a beat.

He knew the Taoist-robed woman’s capability. But she had said that three of herself combined wouldn’t be the crimson-robed man’s match.

Just how strong was the crimson-robed man?

“Almighty. He must be an Almighty and he must be a super expert among Almighties!” The Monarch of the Snow Kingdom’s facial expression changed.

“Little friend, let’s find a place and continue to chat,” the Taoist-robed woman said.

“Sure,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Snow, lead the way,” the Taoist-robed woman glanced at the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom.

The Monarch of the Snow Kingdom immediately led the way in front but didn’t bother with his identity as the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom

Just as Jian Wushuang and the others left, it immediately stirred a hubbub among the crowd.

All the cultivators were discussing Jian Wushuang and the Taoist-robed woman’s identities.

…

In a lofty hall, Jian Wushuang sat side by side with the Taoist-robed woman.

As for the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom, He Xiu and Qiu Yue sat below.

“Wushuang, the last time I saw you, you were in my Tian Yuan Mystery Land. You were only a Universe God then. In the blink of an eye, you already became the top existence in Eternal Chaotic World and you are even listed in Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. I am really impressed,” the Taoist-robed woman, Sir God Tian Yuan, said.

“I am just lucky,” Jian Wushuang smiled humbly.

He roughly knew the Taoist-robed woman.

Sir God Tian Yuan was a Sir God expert that was good at soul attacks. She wasn’t famous in Eternal Chaotic World but her soul attack was unusually fierce. It was said that she could even pose as a threat to the top Sir Gods.

For instance, although Jian Wushuang’s fighting power was strong, his soul strength wasn’t strong. If Sir God Tian Yuan were to launch a full soul attack, it could put him into a threatened position too.

“Speaking of Tian Yuan Mystery Land, Sir God Tian Yuan never revealed yourself and you didn’t even know me, but you gave me an opportunity. This favor, I remember it by heart. If you need anything in the future, if it’s within my capability, I’ll never refuse to help,” Jian Wushuang said.

Jian Wushuang was very grateful for what Sir God Tian Yuan had done.

Back in Snow Sacred World, Jian Wushuang had joined the ranking battle as a disciple from Snow Doho and had won himself a chance to enter Tian Yuan Mystery Land for cultivation for ten years.

In the ten years, not only did Jian Wushuang’s soul power increased tremendously, most importantly, he had received an opportunity from Sir God Tian Yuan… Secret Skill of Tian Yuan!!

Even though the secret skill of soul attack was nothing much to Jian Wushuang, he could even get any other stronger secret skill of soul attack easily. However, back when Jian Wushuang was still weak, the secret skill helped him a lot.

There were even many times when Jian Wushuang had run into danger. He had resolved it through Secret Skill of Tian Yuan.

The secret skill was extremely helpful when he had still been a Universe God. Although Jian Wushuang didn’t know who had provided him the secret skill in Tian Yuan Mystery Land, he remembered the favor in his heart.

He was a person who attached importance to friendship and emotions. He was also a person who made a clear distinction between kindnesses and wrongs.

He would definitely take revenge if there was resentment.

And repay if there was a favor.

Sir God Tian Yuan had done him a favor. Hence, when he passed by Snow Sacred Land, he wanted to express his gratitude to Sir God Tian Yuan personally.

“Haha, back then I noticed that you were an inverse cultivator and carried the bloodline of an Ancient God. I happen to be friends with a seven-star Ancient God. So, I gave the Secret Skill of Tian Yuan to you to befriend you. I never thought you could reach such a level today,” Sir God Tian Yuan smiled. “A favor to an expert on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. I made a great investment.”

“Without the opportunity that Sir God Tian Yuan provided me, I might not be able to achieve what I have today,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The Secret Skill of Tian Yuan that Sir God Tian Yuan gave him helped him to head off disasters many times. Jian Wushuang repaid the favor, as was only right and proper.

“Oh yeah, little friend, you came to Snow Sacred Land today just for me?” Sir God Tian Yuan asked.

“There are two purposes of my visit to Snow Sacred Land. Mainly to express my gratitude to Sir God Tian Yuan. Secondly, to meet an old friend,” Jian Wushuang said.

“You have a friend in Snow Sacred Land? I wonder who it is,” Sir God Tian Yuan asked.

The Monarch of the Snow Kingdom immediately looked.

After he had found out about Jian Wushuang’s power, the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom had been thinking of ways to curry favor with him.

However, with Jian Wushuang’s identity, no matter how much effort he put into it, he couldn’t be in contact with him. But if it was Jian Wushuang’s friend, it would be different.

“No matter who your friend is, Snow Kingdom will try our best to be on friendly terms with him,” the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom said.

“I only have one friend in Snow Sacred Land, his name is Wu Cang. Forty-thousand years ago, he was a Golden Deacon in Snow Dojo. I wonder how he has been,” Jian Wushuang said.

Wu Cang… He had brought Jian Wushuang to Snow Sacred Land and joined Snow Dojo back then.

On the way there, Wu Cang had taken care of him and he shared a good relationship with Jian Wushuang.

“Hold on,” the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom immediately sent a message to the information department of Snow Kingdom.

Very soon, there was a reply.

“Mister, Wu Cang doesn’t hold a position in Snow Dojo anymore and he left Snow Sacred Land,” the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang looked at the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom and realized that he didn’t look too good.

“Humph!”

There was a cold humph and a divine might spread from Jian Wushuang’s body and pressed onto the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom.

The Monarch of the Snow Kingdom felt as though the sky was falling and his internal organs were going to break apart. At the same time, he felt his body unable to endure it and he knelt down.

“Snow, what’s going on?” Sir God Tian Yuan looked at him.

To Jian Wushuang and Sir God Tian Yuan, who was high above the masses, a Monarch of a Holy Kingdom was a nonentity. If they wanted to, they could have killed the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom easily and appointed another person to be the Monarch.

“Something happened,” the Monarch of the Snow Kingdom said anxiously, “Thirty thousand years ago, Wu Cang had a fight with a lineal disciple of mine. Then, Wu Cang was forced to leave by the lineal disciple and he was told to never enter Snow Sacred Land ever again.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“Humph!”

Sir God Tian Yuan looked at Snow coldly, “Snow, your lineal disciples made an impressive show of power, huh? They relied on your might as a Monarch and cornered Jian Wushuang’s friend?”
