Chapter 1672: Seven Star Picture, Eta Ursae Majoris!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The huge Seven Star Picture was displayed before Jian Wushuang in a unique way. Jian Wushuang looked at the seven stars in the picture but he didn’t understand anything from it.

“Lord Long Qi, this picture is…” Jian Wushuang asked subconsciously.

“This is the Seven Star Picture that only Seven Star Black Sect has. The experts of Seven Star Black Sect use it to comprehend the order of heaven and earth, and also rules of auxiliary treasure.

“The order of heaven and earth? The rules?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

“Of course, these things for you, who are in Pure Sun Realm, are too far beyond. However, considering the fact that you were quite respectful when you greeted Master just now, I will give you an opportunity to comprehend. After all, one who cultivates the Secret Skill of Seven Star is hard to come by. Someone who was related to Master came, I can’t let them leave empty-handed,” Long Qi said.

“An opportunity to comprehend?” Jian Wushuang was filled with excitement.

Although he didn’t know what was so special about the Seven Star Picture, the picture was useful to the experts in ancient times, so he believed it was definitely useful.

“Lord Long Qi, how do I comprehend this Seven Star Picture?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“In Seven Star Picture, there is a total of seven stars. The seven stars are Alpha Ursae Majoris, Beta Ursae Majoris, Gamma Ursae Majoris, Delta Ursae Majoris, Epsilon Ursae Majoris, Zeta Ursae Majoris and Eta Ursae Majoris. Every star has a unique orbit and evolution. Among the seven stars, Alpha Ursae Majoris’s orbit and evolution is the most unfathomable, while Eta Ursae Majoris has the easiest orbit and evolution. With your current power, you can only barely comprehend Eta Ursae Majoris.

“Remember this. You only have this one chance to comprehend. As for how much you can comprehend, that comes down to your capability. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Long Qi said and moved towards the last star on Seven Star Picture.

Suddenly, the other six stars disappeared while the star that Long Qi tapped on was quickly magnified in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“Cherish this opportunity.”

Long Qi drew back his palm before he turned and walked out of the hall.

In the hall, there was only Jian Wushuang alone with the huge star before him.

The star was extremely huge. Jian Wushuang looked at the star as though he saw a huge world. His entire mind and body were immersed into the star.

At the beginning, the star had yet to complete and was under the breeding process. As time flew past, the star began to perfect and grow slowly.

Just like a human, from growing on the placenta, to being born and growing up. From a baby that grew up into a teenager, a young adult and finally entered adulthood.

The evolution of the star was the same. However, the time taken was longer than a human by a few folds.

A star would take at least tens of millions of years to be born.

“This is a star’s orbit and evolution?”

“Too unfathomable, too magical.”

Jian Wushuang was in unprecedented shock.

He knew that he needed to comprehend but the orbiting and evolution of star was far beyond his imagination. He couldn’t feel the thing at the depths but he could only feel a rough orbit.

But even though Jian Wushuang could only feel something rough, it was a drastic transformation.

The time flew past.

Since human birth till adulthood, and in the end, growing old and dying.

The star followed a similar fashion.

After a star was born, until it became perfect, it would have to face a breakdown and an extermination in the end.

With the aid of Seven Star Picture, Jian Wushuang saw the progress of a star’s birth to extermination clearly.

The entire process took more than hundreds of millions of years, but comprehension in reality only took ten years.

Ten years later, the star broke down and turned into dust. The comprehension of Seven Star Picture ended as well. However, Jian Wushuang continued to sit in the hall. His consciousness was still indulged in the transformation process of the star and he continued to understand and comprehend.

Three months later, Jian Wushuang slowly came back to reality.

“Phew!”

Jian Wushuang let out a breath of relief and there was shock in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“It’s too magical. The transformation progress of the star is too magical. It’s a pity that I could only see something so superficial,” Jian Wushuang found it a regrettable matter.

He had once been to many unique places and comprehended some magical things.

However, anything that he had comprehended previously couldn’t be compared favorably with Seven Star Picture.

Even the twenty-seven scroll paintings in Fairy Palace in Sanctuary Alliance were too different from Seven Star Picture.

“Mm, my comprehension towards Reincarnation Doctrine has heightened!”

Jian Wushuang suddenly looked surprised. He could feel that he had used the power of Reincarnation and it had improved tremendously. He reckoned that his Reincarnation Doctrine could possess the power to pass through the fifth level in Doctrine Palace.

As for Spacetime Doctrine, it was the same too.

Although his comprehension of Spacetime Doctrine had yet to pass through the sixth level in Doctrine Palace currently, he wasn’t far from it. Out of the twenty-seven scroll paintings in Spacetime Fairy Palace, he had definitely already comprehended sixteen paintings. Even the seventeenth painting, he had comprehended more than half of it.

In merely ten years of comprehension, he had merely comprehended the evolutionary process of Eta Ursae Majoris, which was the lowest in Seven Star Picture, and he could merely see the superficial things. But in the end, his comprehension towards doctrines had improved tremendously.

What Jian Wushuang found unbelievable was that not only did the ten years of comprehension helped him to improve the power and comprehension towards the power of Heaven Way, but he had also improved tremendously in soul power via comprehension.

“My current soul strength should have reached the level of Chaotic Real God and the extremely strong kind of Chaotic Real God!”

Jian Wuhsuang clenched his hand and felt the soul fire in the sea of his consciousness.

The soul fire was much bigger than before.

In terms of size itself, it was three times bigger.

One should know that Jian Wushuang’s soul power was at the standard of an ordinary Eternal Real God.

With one time of comprehension, it had instantly increased so much?

The Seven Star Picture…

“It lives up to the reputation of a treasure that helped superb experts in ancient time in comprehension!” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Jian Wushuang sighed and slowly got up to walk out of the hall.

Just as he walked out of the hall, Jian Wushuang saw Long Qi, who was waiting for him while leaning against a crystal pillar.

Long Qi opened his eyes and looked at Jian Wushuang, “Young man, you look like you have gained quite a bit, huh?”

Jian Wushuang smiled at his comment.

His reward was not only quite a bit, it was great.
