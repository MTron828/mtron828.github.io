Chapter 2567: Take Action

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Mr. Jian Yi, are you going to take action against San Shouwang?” Xiao Tiexin looked at Jian Wushuang closely, eager to know his answer.

Jian Wushuang nodded. “Yes.”

“Are you confident?” Xiao Tiexin was a little worried.

In the battle between the San Shouwang and Pei Qi, the strength they displayed was impressive and had completely surpassed the capabilities of Peak Ultimate Gods.

According to Jian Wushuang, San Shouwang had reserved some of his strength during the battle.

“Don’t worry. I’m confident when I decide to make a move.” Jian Wushuang smiled. “However, the current problem is that after the battle with Pei Qiyi, San Shouwang began his seclusion and announced that he won’t be accepting any duel challenge in the next thousand years. If that’s the case, I won’t be able to challenge him.”

He had certain authorities as a Stellar Region Territorial Lord.

Even if an opponent challenged the Territorial Lord, the Territorial Lord could choose to accept the challenge within a thousand years. Having said that, there was a possibility it could be delayed for up to a thousand years.

San Shouwang had publicly announced that he would like to cease all battles for a thousand years, therefore even if Jian Wushuang decided to exhaust all conditions to challenge San Shouwang, there was a possibility it would only happen after a thousand years.

That was far too long for Jian Wushuang in his current life.

He did not have time to wait around for a thousand years.

“Indeed, now that San Shouwang has avoided the invitations for battles, he can just simply ignore you. Even if you force his hand by leveraging on your strength, it’s still quite impossible. He has control over a powerful and formidable Official Army after all.” Xiao Tiexin looked straight at Jian Wushuang.

“Although they’re just ordinary gods, they’re extremely large in number. The most important matter is that they are a complete battalion with unique military formation methods. Under normal circumstances, a battalion consisting of a thousand soldiers united to deploy strategic military formations is usually enough to compete against the average Earth Ultimate God.”

“There are ten thousand soldiers in the Official Army grouped into ten battalions. That’s equivalent to the strength of ten Earth Ultimate Gods. Mr. Jian Yi, although you’re powerful, you may not be able to single-handedly defeat all ten military formations.”

Jian Wushuang simply nodded.

He had heard about the Official Army’s strength.

Normally, the Official Army would not interfere if San Shouwang wanted to accept any challenges or fights.

However, San Shouwang had announced that he would not be accepting any challenges at the moment. The Official Army would step in should Jian Wushuang insist on a forceful move.

“It won’t work if I issue a challenge to him or force my way to his location. I’m left with the last option which is to lure him out of his seclusion and make him initiate the flight with me,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Perhaps an irresistible benefit or a piece of treasure will fish out his insatiable greed. He’ll be out for sure so long there’s something he’s interested in. Such a treasure...” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes as he thought about his options.

He possessed a piece of treasure befitting the descriptions.

Nonetheless, there would be some risks he would have to handle due to it.

Furthermore, the Official Army was another issue he had to be mindful of.

“By the way, have there been any major events in the Northern Darkstar Continent during my absence? How’s the Situ Clan?” Jian Wushuang suddenly asked and changed the subject.

“Mr. Jian Yi, you’ve only been away for more than a year so nothing major happened. However, the Situ Clan’s situation is becoming worse,” said Xiao Tiexin.

“Oh, what happened?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I’ve been staying in the Northern Darkstar Continent during this period and kept in touch with the Situ Clan. I can see that the Situ Clan has become tenser during this period as the outside world’s pressure has built up. There’s news that San Shouwang was about to take action against the Situ Clan, so the Situ Clan has probably been quite apprehensive,” explained Xiao Tiexin.

“So San Shouwang is really going to do something to the Situ Clan, huh?” Jian Wushuang secretly nodded.

The Situ Clan was a powerful clan and the fact that it lacked an Earth Ultimate God was like a huge cake being placed in front of San Shouwang. It was too enticing!

San Shouwang would probably try his best to restrain himself from exposing the ugly side of his voracious greed. However, he would chow down that piece of cake!

“The Situ Clan has helped me a lot. I’ll go over and have a look.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Jian Wushuang took Xiao Tiexin to the Situ Mansion.

Situ Yuan, the Situ Clan Leader personally greeted him at the door when he knew that Jian Wushuang visited.

The two of them were soon sitting at the Situ Mansion’s Discussion Hall. Besides Situ Yuan, several Situ Clan Elders were also present. The Peak Ultimate God Realm Elders were the Situ Clan’s members with the highest cultivation level.

“Mr. Jian Yi, I haven’t seen you for ages but you look great as usual,” Zhuge Yuan took the initiative to greet him.

“I’ve been well. The Situ Clan Leader and everyone from the Situ Clan must have been feeling quite troubled recently, I assume?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Situ Yuan and the Situ Clan Elders were startled.

“Mr. Jian Yi, what do you mean?” Situ Yuan looked over.

“Well, Clan Leader. We know what’s going on. Although I haven’t been in the Northern Darkstar Continent recently, I’m aware of what’s been going on here. San Shouwang couldn’t wait to take action against the Situ Clan, could he?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Situ Yuan’s eyes widened as he said, “Mr. Jian Yi is right. Judging from the Official Army’s activities during this period, San Shouwang has been showing his eagerness to take action against the Situ Clan and we’re not sure if we’ll be able to survive the disaster this time around.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang saw the worry written across the faces of Situ Yuan and the Situ Clan Elders.

That was understandable. They saw what had happened to the Xiao Clan after all. The Situ Clan’s overall strength was not much different to the Xiao Clan with their only advantage of having a few more allies.

Nonetheless, the Situ Clan would suffer the same plight if San Shouwang made up his mind to topple their clan.

“Clan Leader, let’s be frank. I’m here because the Situ Clan was kind to me before so I’d like to offer my help to resolve this crisis.” Jian Wushuang offered up his services to them.

Situ Yuan and the elders exchanged looks before standing up and thanking Jian Wushuang upon hearing that. “We’re extremely grateful that Mr. Jian Yi is willing to help us who are in trouble.”

“Clan Leader, don’t thank me too early. You should listen to the reason why I’ve offered my help,” said Jian Wushuang mysteriously.

“Your reason?” Situ Yuan looked over quizzically. “What is it?”

Jian Wushuang did not answer immediately. Instead, he looked wearily at the surrounding Elders.

Situ Yuan understood what Jian Wushuang meant and assured him, “Mr. Jian Yi, don’t worry. These Elders are the Situ Clan’s pillars. They know everything that I know. There’s no need to hide anything from them.”
