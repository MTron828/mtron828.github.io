Chapter 2997: Heaven Rank Two-Star Mission

——

“That little guy… I went to see him before and even invited him personally. But for some unknown reason, he rejected me,” Mo Shan said.

“Rejected?” The one-horned tall man could not help but be startled. “Entering the Primal Chaos Palace is the dream of countless top geniuses in the Divine Beginning Realm. Many people paid an unimaginable price, but they still couldn’t reach the threshold to enter the Primal Chaos Palace. This little guy actually rejected such a great opportunity?”

“Who says so? Perhaps he really has some special reasons,” Mo Shan said with a bitter smile.

“Mo Shan, are you still paying attention to that little guy?” The green-haired woman looked over.

“Yes.” Mo Shan nodded. “Not long ago, I found out that he completed three Earth rank three-star missions by himself and has already become a heaven-grade member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. However, recently, he has disappeared without a trace and hasn’t accepted any new missions. It seems that he has gone into seclusion to cultivate.”

“Humph, the junior is too arrogant. He actually rejected a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and is unwilling to join our Primal Chaos Palace. He does not have the resources and conditions to nurture him. If he cultivates by himself, his talent is the highest and his achievements are definitely limited.” The one-horned tall man said.

“What a pity for such a genius.” The three-eyed man and the green-haired woman sighed.

Mo Shan shrugged but did not say anything.

…

Time passed quickly.

In a flash, Jian Wushuang had been in closed-door cultivation for 120 years.

Finally, Jian Wushuang walked out of the secret room.

“120 years…” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself, “The Gold-Splitting Secret Manual has been of great help to me. In the past 120 years, I have been comprehending the space-time rules, sword principles, and swordsmanship with the help of the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual. So far, I have made great progress.”

“In terms of the laws of space-time, I should have reached the limit of the second stage. The number of blades of space-time I have condensed is close to 1,000. If I take another step forward, I will reach the third stage…

“In terms of the way of the sword, I have also improved by a large level. The infinite sword tree in my body was only 3,300 meters tall before, but now it is 6,600 meters tall. It has doubled in height. When I urge the infinite sword tree to execute its sword arts, its power has also increased tremendously.

“As for swordsmanship, after 120 years of constant study and comprehension based on the void swordsmanship in the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual, I finally created the two sword styles, ‘Night Vision’ and ‘Star Dream’. Among them, ‘Star Dream’ has completely reached the standard of the embryonic form of swordsmanship!”

“Now, I seem to have reached the limit of my realm in all aspects. If I want to go further, I’m afraid I have to break through to the Saint-level first.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining.

He had not broken through to the Immortal Saint-level yet.

But he was very confident in himself because he had reached the true limit in all aspects. He was only one opportunity away from breaking through.

As long as the opportunity came, he could breakthrough at any time.

“This opportunity is not something I can find by staying in the secret room and continuing to cultivate in seclusion. I have to go on adventures. It’s best if the outside world can give me some stimulation, such as giving me a sense of crisis and pressure,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Now he was ready for everything except the last step.

And the last step would give him a higher chance of success under great pressure.

“Go and do the task.”

Jian Wushuang let out a sigh and quickly set off.

…

In the hall of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

Jian Wushuang held a task list and carefully looked through it.

The task list he was looking at was naturally a heaven-level task list. There were all kinds of heaven-level tasks on the list, with varying degrees of difficulty.

Jian Wushuang first looked at the one-star heaven-level tasks.

The one-star heaven-level tasks were suitable for experts who had just become heaven-level members. Under normal circumstances, such tasks could be completed as long as they had the battle strength of a second rank True Saint.

If it were 120 years ago, before Jian Wushuang went into closed-door cultivation, these one-star heaven-level tasks would have put a little pressure on Jian Wushuang. But now, there were very few one-star heaven-level tasks that he cared about.

Soon, Jian Wushuang turned his attention to the two-star heaven-level tasks.

The two-star heaven-level tasks were much more difficult than the one-star tasks. To complete the two-star heaven-level tasks alone, most of them required the battle strength of a peak stage two-star or even a stage three True Saint.

This kind of task was also somewhat challenging for Jian Wushuang.

“This time, I chose this task specifically to break through to the Immortal Saint realm. The task is not too difficult, but it can not be too low. Although the ordinary two-star heaven-level tasks are somewhat challenging for me, if I’m lucky, I’m still very confident that I can complete them. Therefore, if I want to choose, I will choose the more difficult two-star heaven-level tasks!”

“For example, this one!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Jian Wushuang looked at a two-star heaven-level task on the list.

It was also a two-star heaven-level task, but the reward of the task Jian Wushuang was looking at was extremely high, 150 million sacred elixirs!

The location of the task was an extremely prosperous place in the endless territories, where there were many experts.

Most importantly, the mission did not have a time limit.

In other words, even if you accepted the mission now, you could wait for decades or even hundreds of years to complete it. Naturally, it was not a big deal for you to delay for a while during the mission.

“This mission looks very difficult and risky, but it gives me a lot of leeway and opportunities to deal with it without counting time.” Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “This is it!”

Jian Wushuang made up his mind and quickly went to accept the task.

After accepting the task, he made some preparations and immediately set off.

…

Magic Note Divine Kingdom!

The Magic Note Divine Kingdom was formed by a combination of 38 different realms.

The territory where the Magic Note Divine Fruit was located was a relatively prosperous place in the endless territories. There were many more experts than ordinary territories.

And the Magic Note Divine Kingdom was able to combine 36 realms here to form the Magic Note Divine Fruit. One could imagine its strength.

The Magic Note Divine Kingdom was passed down by the Magic Note King. It was said that this Magic Note King had reached the level of a fourth-level True Saint many years ago. As for now, it was even more unfathomable.

In the endless territories, a fourth-level True Saint was definitely the most apex existence.

After all, anyone who was a rank five True Saint was qualified to be called a Peak Immortal Saint.

There were many rank-five True Saints in the vast third sky, but they were extremely rare in the endless territories. Naturally, with the rank four True Saint strength of the Magic Note King, he could dominate an area.
