Chapter 2251 Slaughter

Hong long long ~~Boundless Divine Power covered every single corner of the land and turned into an apocalyptic storm.

In such an apocalyptic storm, zoom!

A figure burst out.

It was Chen Qi.

His face was slightly pale, but his fighting power was not affected.

He stood in the nearby Void and looked towards the core of the battlefield. Old Monster Jiao was already tangled with the giant golden hand that emerged from the golden Divine Power Sea. The spacetime he was in had been completely sealed up as well. He had no way to escape.

“Old Monster Jiao’s in trouble,” Chen Qi murmured.

Without a doubt, Old Monster Jiao was in trouble.

He knew it, but Chen Qi had no intention of saving him.

“That Emperor Bai and Sword Emperor are strong. They only let me off because they wanted to focus on Old Monster Jiao. If I don’t appreciate that, they’ll do their best to take me down as well,” Chen Qi thought.

He knew that Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai had many tricks up their sleeves.

Neither of them had demonstrated Secret Skills of Star Palace yet.

If they were to demonstrate that, they would be perfectly able to taking down both him and Old Monster Jiao.

What worried Chen Qi was that if he were to help Old Monster Jiao, he may be stepped on him instead for him to escape. There was no way he could regret his decision then.

“I promised to help Old Monster Jiao, not fight to the death for him,” Chen Qi had made his decision.

“Mister Jiao, I’ve tried my best, now you’re on your own,” Chen Qi said and left. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Damn it!” Old Monster Jiao’s expression changed as he saw Chen Qi leave while he himself was still stuck within the golden Divine Power Sea.

Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai smiled.

Just as they had expected, Chen Qi was only invited by the Old Monster Jiao, and had left when he sensed danger.

With Chen Qi gone, they could focus on killing Old Monster Jiao alone.

“His powers are much stronger than that of the Ancient Era experts I just took down, makes me excited,” Jian Wushuang smiled with bloodlust. “Emperor Bai, I tackle him head-on, you find a chance to kill him.”

“Okay,” Emperor Bai nodded.

Jian Wushuang made his move and drifted towards the golden Divine Power Sea where Old Monster Jiao was still struggling.

The great sword essence could be felt before he even arrived.

Hu!

The enormous Divine Power storm seemed to be affected by the sword essence.

Immediately, the boundless Divine Power storm changed its direction and headed for Old Monster Jiao.

Endless power, complete suppression on the Old Monster Jiao.

Jian Wushuang pulled out his sword.

A move like strong wind with the momentum of rainstorm!

It was Sword Principle Xuan Luo’s Blast Rainstorm!

As Jian Wushuang had improved immensely on his Sword Principle, his Sword Principle Xuan Luo had become much more powerful in terms of both power and sword essence.

The horrifying sword shadow was going straight for the Old Monster Jiao.

Old Monster Jiao could feel the entire earth pressing down on him, making him breathless.

“You wanna kill me, you?” Old Monster Jiao completely morphed into that black monster, and boundless spiteful aura rolled over the lands.

That spiteful aura was so intense that it pushed the golden Divine Power Sea back.

The Old Monster Jiao broke free of his shackles and gripped his right hand. Boundless black Divine Power was concentrated on it and punched out like a great mountain.

Peng!

A deafening roar rose.

The boundless black Divine Power went spreading in a frenzy, and Old Monster Jiao was blasted out as well.

“Damn it,” Old Monster Jiao’s eyes were bloodshot, reluctant to accept the fact.

He had heinous power but was not able to demonstrate it due to the restrictions placed upon the earth, yet Jian Wushuang’s powers were easily at Chaotic Divine Demon levels.

Even if he went all out, he would still be suppressed by Jian Wushuang.

The collision blasted him out, yet Jian Wushuang merely moved slightly and continued with his attack.

Xiu!

A blood shadow burst out.

It was a crimson sword shadow.

The sword shadow looked as if it was made out of pure concentrated blood, and in the blink of an eye, it was in front of Old Monster Jiao.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo... Sanguis Extremus style!

Old Monster Jiao had not completely stopped, but he could still defend himself and was preparing to block Jian Wushuang’s blade.

But suddenly, boom!

A terrifying soul attack struck Old Monster Jiao’s consciousness sea directly.

Old Monster Jiao’s brain was in a fuzz as if his soul was being knocked by a large drum.

An unprecedented pain then came.

The pain had the Old Monster Jiao gritting his teeth, but his consciousness did not come to a stop, and barely stretched his arm to block that crimson sword shadow.

The crimson sword shadow, that cold blade landed directly on Old Monster Jiao’s arm.

At that moment, a terrifying power was released.

The terrifying portion of Sword Principle Xuan Luo’s Sanguis Extremus style was that explosive power.

It seemed normal, but the level of power it could release at that last moment was terrifying.

Peng!

Old Monster Jiao’s arm had been directly ripped off, forming a huge hole on his torso, but the Blood Mountain Sword did not stop and kept going for Old Monster Jiao’s holy body.

“Hngh!” Old Monster Jiao let out a muffled snort. His chest now had a hole in it the size of a bowl, but it had not blasted through his entire body.

“Go away!” Old Monster Jiao let out a roar, and immediately a black light beam was gunning for Jian Wushuang from the black monster he had morphed.

With a close look at the black beams one would realise that they were all Divine Powered fists.

Every single fist had earth-shattering power.

Jian Wushuang took one step back and retreated 10,000 miles. He casually waved his Blood Mountain Sword, and streaks of sword light appeared, dissipating all the black fists.

At that moment...

Hua lala ~~~ That boundless golden Divine Power Sea was heading for Old Monster Jiao once again.
