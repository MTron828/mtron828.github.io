Chapter 928: Number One of the Eternal World

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Buzz…” More sword shadows flew out.

An additional 36 One-meter Swords joined the existing 36 swords.

72 of them formed a new lavender lightsaber in the Void.

This was the Second Sword Formation of Ninth-heaven Sword Formation!

“Kill!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes glinted with killing intent as the lavender lightsaber pierced the Void.

Xia Mang stood in the Void with five huge fierce beasts standing behind him. He readied himself to make another Killing Move but before he could do so, a lavender Flowing Light cut through the void without hindrance and directly pierced him.

It was so fast.

The Flowing Light was too fast.

The Second Sword Formation was much faster and more powerful than the first.

Xia Mang had merely survived the First Sword Formation.

However, the Second Sword Formation was rumored to travel ten thousand miles in a second.

This might be exaggerated but it demonstrated how terrifyingly fast the Second Sword Formation was.

Xia Mang had no time to resist such a high-speed attack.

“Snap!”

The jade that Xia Mang had been always wearing shattered and produced a transparent halo that enveloped him entirely. The lavender Flowing Light hit the halo with great force, piercing it. The resulting strong wind sent a violent shock through Xia Mang’s body and he was pushed backward by several steps.

Though Xia Mang was in a very pathetic state, he nevertheless survived the Flowing Light.

Xia Mang’s face was as pale as a ghost. When he managed to regain his footing, he quickly retreated far into the Void.

Silence fell over the drill ground.

Everyone was horrified to see what was happening.

“Xia Mang lost?”

“He’s really defeated this time!”

“He almost got himself killed.”

Everyone outside of the Restriction layer began fervently discussing the battle.

Everyone could see that Xia Mang would not have survived Jian Wushuang’s attack had the jade not cast such a strong barrier.

“I almost died?”?Xia Mang was similarly stunned and frightened.

He had experienced several crises since he began cultivating but never had he come so close to death.

“I would’ve died if not for my Ancestor’s jade!”

“How is this even possible?”

He did not know that Jian Wushuang had a special talent. When Jian Wushuang was just a Divine Realm expert, he already possessed Seventh-level battle strength equivalent to that of an ordinary Dao Master. When he entered the Eternal Realm, there was an even more unimaginable growth in his strength.

A Rank One Dao Master was nothing to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s strength in the Everlasting Realm was one that defied the natural order. His Second Ninth-heaven Sword Formation could easily crush a Rank One Dao Master.

There was a lot of exclamations coming from the audience.

“Did Xia Mang really lose?”

“Xia Mang is an authentic Dao Master who has opened up a Dao at the Creation Level! His strength is also at the top of Rank One Level!”

“To think that an Eternal Realm expert defeated and almost killed a top Dao Master…”

“Jian Wushuang is the Number One of the Eternal World! He’s also the Number One genius! Xia Mang is indeed a joke in front of him!”

The experts in the audience exclaimed with admiration.

Everyone acknowledged Jian Wushuang’s strength.

Only Jian Wushuang deserved the title “Number One of the Eternal World”.

“Xia Mang’s totally out of Jian Wushuang’s league.”

Xia Yu was upset to hear all the compliments for Jian Wushuang and yelled, “You bastard, how dare you use killing moves!”

“So what?” Xue Lingtian replied coldly, speaking in place of Jian Wushuang. “Xia Mang was the one who challenged my Junior Brother first. It was also he who suggested the fight for life. We all witnessed it. It’s clear who really has the killing intent.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The top experts looked over at Xia Yu with a hint of mockery in their eyes.

No one was a fool.

It was obvious that Xia Mang was the one who wanted to kill Jian Wushuang in the first place. Since it was he who challenged Jian Wushuang’s life first, it would be his own fault even if Jian Wushuang had killed him during the fight.

Xia Yu blushed, momentarily speechless.

Xia Mang, having escaped to the edge of the drill ground, stared at Jian Wushuang in awe. He dared not fight Jian Wushuang anymore.

After all, he only had one jade.

With his jade broken, nothing could save him from another of Jian Wushuang’s killing move.

He had lost this battle!

Jian Wushuang had defeated him so quickly and thoroughly in front of so many people.

His confidence in his strength was completely crushed.

Now, he felt only fear.

“Your Highness.”

Xue Lingtian stood up from the audience to address Emperor Leng. “This battle is over and it’s obvious who the winner is. Your Highness, please announce the name of the Emperor’s son-in-law.”

Everyone turned to Emperor Leng with complicated expressions.

.Jian Wushuang had prevailed in terms of wedding gifts and strength.

He was the rightful winner according to the rules of the Selection Ceremony.

He was rightfully Leng Rushuang’s future husband.

This ought to be the result of the contests.

However, it was hard to say whether Emperor Leng would acknowledge this outcome.

After all, everyone knew that the purpose of this Selection Ceremony was for the marriage alliance with the Xia Clan. It was something that Emperor Leng had already promised the clan.

This ceremony was just a process.

The plan was to have Xia Mang excel in the Selection Ceremony and become the Emperor’s son-in-law in the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land. That way, Leng Rushuang would be forced to face the reality.

It was beyond anyone’s expectations that Jian Wushuang would come into play and even thoroughly defeat Xia Mang.

This outcome was not within the plans of Emperor Leng and the Xia clan.

The experts in the audience were curious about the choice Emperor Leng would make.

Would she announce that Jian Wushuang would be the Emperor’s son-in-law in accordance with the results of the two contests of the Selection Ceremony?

Or would she still choose Xia Mang without fearing the ridicule of so many people?

The choice was up to her.

Everybody waited for her to make her decision.
