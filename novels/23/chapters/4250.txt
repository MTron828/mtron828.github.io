4252 The Killing

Kill!!!

For a moment, the sound of battle filled the air as spell techniques and sword glows surged up into the sky!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

From the beginning of the battle, it had entered a state of white heat.

!!

Mountain Shaker went straight for the heavily-armored commander from the Da Feng Divine Kingdom, who was holding a halberd.

The two of them were almost invincible Rulers. As they fought, they turned the area within a thousand feet into a forbidden area, and the aftermath of their battle swept in all directions!

“Splitting the heavens and splitting the earth!”

“Die!” The Da Feng Divine Kingdom’s commander shouted coldly. The heavenly halberd in his hand instantly swept across the sky, bringing with it a heavy force as it struck down on Commander Mountain Shaker!

“Unmoving as a mountain!”

Looking at the halberd light that seemed to be able to cut off the sun and moon, Commander Mountain Shaker’s face sank. His entire body glowed with a faint golden light, and his feet seemed to be rooted to the ground. The cold halberd light was unable to move him at all.

“Do you only know how to get beaten up?”

The commander of the Da Feng Divine Kingdom stomped his right foot with an apathetic expression and immediately hacked at the man with his halberd!

…

On the other side.

“Die!” Ruler Grotto Profound wielded that strange-looking Turtledove blade and charged through the Da Feng Divine Kingdom’s camp!

There were no rules to this battle. It was a head-on battle between the two Ultimate Rulers!

Peng, peng, peng, peng!

Countless divine arts and techniques exploded. If this was the outside world, the battle between the two forces would be enough to blow up a galaxy. Even in the Ancient Path of Stars, where there were rules and space was extremely stable, it was still like a disaster had descended. The earth trembled and countless huge pits were blasted.

Jian Wushuang followed behind Ruler Grotto Profound, so he was not in any danger. From time to time, he would casually slash out a sword light to help Ruler Grotto Profound block the hidden arrows that came from all directions.

“Blood Sword, it seems that you’re not bad.” Ruler Grotto Profound turned to look at Jian Wushuang and laughed.

“It’s so-so.”

Jian Wushuang smiled.

At this moment.

“Go to hell, you little bastards under the Overlord!”

A bare-chested man with a mustache, wielding a large saber, slashed down at Ruler Grotto Profound!

The terrifying blade light mixed with the laws of the universe roared in the sky!

“Remember, the one who killed you is a subordinate of the fourth Army of the Da Feng Divine Kingdom, commander barren. He is Ruler Cold Disaster!”

Ruler Grotto Profound’s face instantly turned grave.

He had noticed this person a long time ago. In the Da Feng Divine Kingdom’s camp, he was an expert only below the commander. In just a short while, he had killed no less than three of the Overlord’s Ultimate Rulers!

“Blood Sword, hide behind me. Be careful!”

Ruler Grotto Profound took a deep breath and tightened his grip on the dagger. He growled, “Thunder slash!”

“BOOM!”

The turtledove blade in Ruler Grotto Profound’s hand immediately began to coil with lightning snakes, and balls of lightning began to condense at the tip of the blade!

Slash!!!

“Die!” Ruler Grotto Profound’s expression was solemn as he stomped down with his right foot, sending his entire body soaring into the air as he slashed down with his saber at Ruler Cold Disaster!

The two blade auras collided with each other!

Bang!

The lightning exploded and a light wave spread out from where the two of them fought!

“Retreat!” Ruler Cold Disaster’s body trembled, while Ruler Grotto Profound was forced back ten-some steps.

“Oh? You’re pretty good.”

Ruler Cold Disaster raised an eyebrow in surprise.

Ruler Grotto Profound had a solemn expression on his face. He didn’t say anything, only stared at Ruler Cold Disaster.

He understood that he had to hold this person back. Otherwise, once he charged into their camp, no one would be able to stop him!

In group battles like this, a single expert was enough to tilt the tide of the battle. Commander Mountain Shaker and Commander Barren Creek were currently locked in a stalemate. If they could not stop Ruler Cold Disaster, the consequences would be unimaginable!

“However, that’s all there is to it.”

Ruler Cold Disaster laughed coldly as he raised his saber and charged forward once more!

The cold black blade light was like a sun-devouring snake, instantly turning into thousands of blades and attacking like a storm!

“Blood Sword, be careful!”

Ruler Grotto Profound gritted his teeth, turned around, and warned Jian Wushuang. then, he braced himself and charged at Ruler Cold Disaster!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

“Bang bang bang bang!”

The two of them exchanged thousands of blows in an instant. The cold saber light and the lightning on the turtle-head ring saber collided, causing the ground to rumble. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

One could tell that in terms of battle-power, Ruler Grotto Profound was slightly weaker than Ruler cold. Under the saber-light of Ruler Cold Disaster, he could only continuously retreat. He was only able to defend, not fight back.

Fortunately, however, Ruler Grotto Profound had a deep foundation of divine power. Ruler Cold Disaster really wouldn’t be able to do anything to him for a while.

This was also Ruler Grotto Profound’s goal.

He didn’t hope to kill Ruler Cold Disaster. He only wanted to stall him for a while so that Commander Mountain Shaker could decide the outcome of the battle. At that time, the outcome would be decided!

Ruler Cold Disaster clearly understood this as well. His eyes flashed, and he laughed coldly. “Little brat, I’ll get even with you after I’ve killed the other trash under your Overlord.”

After saying that, his eyes flickered as he searched for a new target.

Then, he fixed his eyes on Jian Wushuang.

“Oh? There’s still a piece of trash here who’s trying to fish in troubled waters. In that case, I’ll start with you.”

“Hehe!” Cold Disaster laughed and stomped his foot, turning into a black light. He flew past the panting Grotto Profound God and charged at Jian Wushuang!

“Blood Sword, be careful!”

Ruler Grotto Profound’s expression changed and he shouted at Jian Wushuang behind him.

The thing he was most worried about had happened.

It was already extremely difficult for him to deal with Ruler Cold Disaster. How could he have the energy to save others?

“It’s you, kid, go to hell!”

“Hehe!” Cold Disaster grinned hideously. The saber in his hand turned into a black python that could devour the world as he slashed down at Jian Wushuang!

Ruler Grotto Profound’s face instantly turned extremely ugly to behold.

In the distance, Commander Mountain Shaker had also noticed this scene.

“Kid, if you want to survive in the back eight cities, this is something you have to go through. You’re on your own.”

Commander Mountain Shaker muttered to himself as he shook his head. He then once again engaged in battle with commander Huangchuan.

Jian Wushuang looked at the incoming saber light and suddenly let out a sigh.

“Why do you want to kill me?”

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s right hand shook slightly and the Wuqi Divine Sword appeared in his hand.

Then, Jian Wushuang raised his right hand and looked at the grinning Ruler Cold Disaster. He calmly said, “Split open the sky.”

As soon as he finished speaking, there was no brilliant sword light or soaring sword intent.

“Die!” A calm streak of sword-Qi shot out from Wu Qi toward Ruler Cold Disaster.

After breaking through to the fourth level of the origin of sword principle, Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship had suddenly returned to the state of simplicity.

“Hahahaha, this soft sword Qi, is it an embroidery needle?”

“Hahaha!” Ruler Cold Disaster laughed disdainfully. He didn’t care about Jian Wushuang’s sky-splitting strike at all.
