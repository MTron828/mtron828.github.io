Chapter 459: Something Unforeseen

Translator:?Transn?Editor:?Transn

Black Yuan Lord only began to look around after doing all these.

“Demon Soul Lord.”

The latter was the first person he looked toward. His voice, which was broad and seemed to contain a special magical power, rang out on the battlefield.

“This Dao Weapon is now in my hands. If you’re not happy about that, come at me as you will. I’ll be glad to entertain.”

After he finished speaking, the lords from Marquis Cangyue’s camp could not but become silent, and their facial complexions became rather unsightly.

They were well aware that if the Dao Weapon was in Loftiness Lord’s hands, they would have some hope of obtaining it by fighting. However, now that it had fallen into Black Yuan Lord’s hands...

They would have to kill him in order to obtain the weapon. However, not only was he extremely strong, but his body was acknowledged to be number one among both camps. Even if the two Marquises personally worked together, they would not have absolute confidence about killing him.

And without the Marquises, they were utterly incapable of killing him, and naturally would not be able to take the weapon.

“Black Yuan Lord.” Demon Soul Lord spoke, clenching her teeth. “You ought to know that my Marquis considers the long spear to be a magic weapon. The Dao Weapon you just received suits him perfectly.”

“I know.” Black Yuan Lord nodded slowly. “I’ll eventually pass this Dao Weapon to Marquis Piaoxue. Your Marquis shall have to discuss it with him.”

Demon Soul Lord’s face sank, and she said little else.

The lords from Marquis Cangyue’s camp were now gathered together. Although most of their attention was focused on Black Yuan Lord, some of them would look at Jian Wushuang from time to time.

“It’s all because of that little fella!”

“If not for his Realms, we would certainly have killed Loftiness Lord and seized the Dao Weapon before Black Yuan Lord arrived!”

“It’s the Realms’ fault!”

Lords from Marquis Cangyue’s camp glared at Jian Wushuang with resentment.

Marquis Piaoxue’s camp had a different reaction.

“Haha, our young swordsman friend.”

“Swordsman brother, your strength is truly outstanding.”

Many lords clustered beside Jian Wushuang. Every one of them treated him warmly and no longer put on the airs of a lord.

After all, Jian Wushuang’s use of strength during the battle had already proven that he was no weaker than a lord though he was only a Saint Realm expert, and thus he naturally won the respect of every lord.

Jian Wushuang laughed and acknowledged the warmth being shown by the lords.

Suddenly...

Booom... the cave mansion, which had already quietened, abruptly began to tremor violently.

The earth trembled and the mountains swayed. The entire cave mansion seemed as though it was going to cave in completely.

“What’s going on?”

The lords from both camps frowned, revealing blank and puzzled looks.

Even Black Yuan Lord was currently looking around in bewilderment.

The entire cave mansion was shaking badly. Amidst the reactions of the lords, a large aura began to spread gradually.

Though it was clearly still a considerable distance away from the lords, they were nonetheless horrified by its impending arrival.

Furthermore, it spread upward at an astonishing speed such that it reached an entirely new height in only a short time.

It pervaded the entire cave mansion including the outer layer, causing experts in every corner of the cave mansion to feel its presence. The tremors gradually began to dissipate.

Silence!

The battlefield, where more than 50 lords and experts from the two large camps were gathered, fell into a dead silence.

It took a while before some people began to talk.

“What... what exactly was that?”

“What a widespread aura. Could it mean the creation of some treasure?”

“Well, if this cave mansion even has a Dao Weapon, then it’s not surprising there are other treasures.”

“The source of the aura is... that way.”

Everyone looked toward the direction from which the aura originated.

“Let’s go!”

“Hurry up and get over there!”

Without any hesitation, the lords from both camps rushed in the direction of the aura’s source.

Black Yuan Lord and Demon Soul Lord also got moving.

“Swordsman and Silver Wing Lord, let’s go too.” Iron Saber Lord instructed.

Jian Wushuang and Silver Wing Lord nodded earnestly and followed the crowd.

Although the lords from the two camps had been fighting against each other just a while ago, they now had a tacit understanding to put a hold on the conflict.

On the way toward the aura’s source, Myriad Islands Lord walked up beside Demon Soul Lord. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Demon Soul Lord.” Myriad Islands Lord kept his voice low so that only the former could hear his words.

“What’s the matter?” She asked.

He put on a rather serious expression. “Demon Soul Lord, you should be able to tell that the current situation is extremely unfavorable to our camp.”

“Yes, I can tell.” She nodded.

Prior to the arrival of Black Yuan Lord, Marquis Cangyue’s camp was already at an absolute disadvantage in the tussle for the Dao Weapon. After his arrival, the gap between the two camps only grew.

“All this is because of that Saint Realm fella named Swordsman.” Demon Soul Lord’s chilly eyes involuntarily looked toward Jian Wushuang.

“Yes, it’s all because of him,” Myriad Islands Lord muttered. “His Realm Technique is very powerful, much more so than the Formations which I set up temporarily. If he remains in Marquis Piaoxue’s camp going forward, he’ll be a huge problem for us in future tussles over treasures!”

Demon Soul Lord’s expression turned solemn.

They were not overly concerned with Jian Wushuang’s strength. Even if it compared favorably to that of an advanced lord’s, it would not mean much to either camp. However, his Realm Technique was truly something else.

Such a level of Realm Technique was always going to be a problem for either camp if possessed by the opposing camp.

“Demon Soul Lord, your strength is currently the greatest among the lords of Marquis Cangyue’s camp. I came to find you to tell you to kill the swordsman when there’s an opportunity,” Myriad Islands Lord said in an indifferent tone.

“You want me to kill the swordsman?” Demon Soul Lord frowned. “We may know that the swordsman is important, but so does Marquis Piaoxue’s camp. They’ll definitely do everything possible to protect him. Even if it’s me trying, chances of success are slim.”

“Don’t worry and just do your best. It doesn’t matter if you don’t actually kill him. All you need to do is make Marquis Piaoxue’s lords focus their attention on you. Leave the swordsman to me.” Myriad Islands Lord assured confidently.

“Oh?” Demon Soul Lord glanced astonishedly at Myriad Islands Lord and subsequently nodded in agreement.
