Chapter 2538: Murderous Intention

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Did he just completely ward off my saber?” Tu Ying looked surprised.

“That’s enough.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold. His body concurrently transformed into seven apparitions from not wanting to waste time mucking around with Tu Ying.

He was faster than before while his sword skills had also improved to be more seamless and flitting.

His strength was slightly revealed.

He instantly switched from defense to offense.

On the contrary, Tu Ying strenuously started madly warding off Jian Wushuang’s sword attacks and barely able to hold on any longer.

‘I’m going to lose.’ Tu Ying was aware and tried to distance himself from Jian Wushuang when he could no longer resist those attacks.

“It’s amazing you can concurrently produce so many apparitions. Your understanding of Space-time law is certainly quite high. Not to mention your outstanding swordsmanship,” said Tu Ying admiringly.

“Thank you,” said Jian Wushuang as he withdrew his Blood Mountain Sword.

Suddenly...

Boom!

Tu Ying’s blood started boiling. He was gearing up to perform his most powerful secret technique.

His speed had increased by several folds in an instant, and he appeared in front of Jian Wushuang in a crazy forward dash. He held a saber in his hand which was shining with a cold light and he was aiming it at Jian Wushuang’s head.

He was moving swiftly all of a sudden.

The spectators were convinced that Tu Ying had given up, but who would have thought that he would make a comeback shot.

He was acting so humble and polite before, but his face now turned distorted in scowls of rage.

His gaze became inhuman with strong desires to kill.

“Idiot, the rules clearly state that the battle is only over when one party leaves the Gladiatorial Arena. I was pretending earlier. Do you really think that I’ve really lost?” Tu Ying sneered.

He was the trump card among their Primary-Level Ultimate Gods after all.

He was chosen not only because he was extremely powerful, but also due to his cunning nature.

The secret technique he was using ramped up his powers not to mention he also had a killing blow which he spent a long time cultivating. He was convinced it would threaten a High-Level Ultimate God’s defenses and eventually kill them.

That was why when he told the elegant lady in the room that he only had a 40 percent chance of winning if he were to duel with Jian Wushuang, but was 70 percent sure he could kill Jian Wushuang.

It was indeed true that he was not Jian Wushuang’s opponent in a one-on-one fight.

Life-or-death battles in the Gladiatorial Arena did not limit their participants to winning via frontal fights only. All kinds of methods including sneak and poison attacks were also acceptable.

Tu Ying did not violate any rules of the Gladiatorial Arena.

“Go to hell!

“Don’t blame me! Blame yourself for being stupid and naive.”

Tu Ying grinned slyly. His blade was less than a foot away from Jian Wushuang’s head.

A large hand suddenly grabbed the saber to his surprise.

The saber’s powers surged as Tu Ying was trying his best to completely discharge his divine powers into the saber. However, the saber stayed motionless under the large hand’s tight grip.

“How is that possible?” Tu Ying stared at Jian Wushuang in bewilderment as he realized the large hand belonged to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had his eyes fixed on Tu Ying sternly like he was staring at a clown or an ant.

“Y-you...” Tu Ying was shocked and speechless.

“Actually, I didn’t plan to kill you but you brought it upon yourself. Go to hell,” murmured Jian Wushuang who seemed to be muttering to himself.

Hum!

The icy-cold sword-light flashed passed and instantly killed Tu Ying as it penetrated his body without giving him even a second to react.

Tu Ying’s eyes widened with disbelief look on his face as the last breath escaped his body.

This was Jian Wushuang’s first kill since the many battle rounds he had.

He merely defeated and subdued his previous three opponents without killing them.

However, he had a murderous intent toward Tu Ying.

Jian Yi should be declared the victory party which brought an end to the battle as soon as Tu Ying died.

Usually, tumult would break out from the spectator’s seats from cheers for the winner. Instead, it was dead silence.

Many spectators were dumbfounded and looked blankly at the scene in the Gladiatorial Arena.

Everyone thought Jian Wushuang was going to die when Tu Ying executed his mysterious killing blow sneak attack, but...it was Tu Ying who died in the end.

His death was tragic as he initially thought of himself as being the strongest and capable of killing Jian Wushuang with his ultimate blow, but the reality was that his attack had been stopped by his opponent with just one hand.

The audience did not expect this.

The silence did not last long and was soon replaced by an earth-shaking roar.

In an exquisite room within the inner circle of the Gladiatorial Arena.

“Bastard!”

The graceful woman stood up and stared at Jian Wushuang, who was seemingly unscathed on the Gladiatorial Arena. Her complexion became extremely ugly.

“Jian Yi has been hiding his real strength from the beginning,” said the graceful woman solemnly.

“Are you saying he’s not a Primary-Level Ultimate God? Could he be a High-Level Ultimate God or even above that but was just masking his true divine powers?” The black-robed old man looked over in surprise.

“No, the breath of his divine powers seems normal. There’s no trace of disguise, but he’s powerful indeed. The average High-Level Ultimate Gods have no chance to survive Tu Ying’s killing blow but we saw that not only was Jian Yi uninjured, but he could also even grip the saber with his bare hands!

“In order to grab a top Primary-Level Ultimate God expert’s most powerful attack with his bare hand alone, he must be a High-Level Ultimate God on top of having an extremely powerful divine body. I’m not surprised if his true strength is better than what he has shown us now.” The graceful woman’s eyes became stern.

The black-robed old man asked, “What should we do now? The Blood Gladiators Challenge has five rounds in total and he has won four of them. Who do we send for the final battle? There is no one more powerful than Tu Ying among the Primary-Level Ultimate Gods.”

The graceful woman waved her hand. “Don’t be flustered. Let Jian Yi wait while I report this situation to the Shi clan’s head and seek for his decision.”

“Hmm.” The black-robed old man nodded. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The graceful woman would usually have made up her mind, but the bet was 160,000 Primordial Stones.

Such a huge amount of Primordial Stone had exceeded the graceful woman’s authority and the Shi clan head must be alerted for a decision to be made.
