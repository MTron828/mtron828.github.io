Chapter 571: A Broken Finger

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Temple Master Black Spirit was known as the most powerful expert in the Monster-exterminating League.

So, it was only natural that she took charge of the relic on the fifth floor of the Earth Core Palace.

And, because this relic was in her possession, the monsters did not dare to push them too hard.

If Temple Master Black Spirit was not here or if she ever left the Monster Continent for dozens of years, there would be no Huaman Territory on the Monster Continent.

While Jian Wushuang was heading for the fifth floor of the Earth Core Palace, an angry roar could be heard echoing out from a huge ancient forest in the Monster Territory.

“Trash, a group of trash!”

“A Monster King and eight Rank Nine Monsters failed to kill a human who only Divine Emperor battle strength. You all are good for nothing!”

“I have waited here for more than two months and this is the result I get. Hum, damn it!”

In this ancient forest, there were many Demonic Beasts, including some powerful Rank Seven, Rank Eight, and Rank Nine Monsters, along with even some Monster Kings. However, all of them were terrified by this snarl.

They all knew who let out it. It was the overlord of their monster population and the supreme existence they all held in awe.

“Command...”

The resonant roar became cold and rang out again. “All of my people assemble, right now!”

“Our target is the Human Territory!” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The order caused a commotion throughout the monster population.

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor was the overlord of the monster population.

The Crystal-armored Monster Clan was one of the top three monster groups in the whole Monster Continent. As it was so powerful, many monster groups were affiliated with it and obeyed the orders from Crystal-armored Monster Emperor.

The affiliated monster groups instantly assembled and formed into a mighty Monster Army. They were led by Crystal-armored Monster Emperor as they swarmed towards the Human Territory like hornets.

“This compass is related to the Ancient World Token. No matter what it takes, even if I have to start a war with the humans, I’ll get it!”

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor was determined to obtain it!

Jian Wushuang arrived at the fifth floor of Earth Core Palace by using the token Temple Master Black Spirit had given him.

The fifth floor was different from the first four floors because they were filled with secret chambers. However, this floor was a completely open area.

“Oh?”

Jian Wushuang carefully tried to sense the surroundings.

”?The Origin Energy here seems to be denser than that on the fourth floor.?” Jian Wushuang sighed in private.

The deeper someone went in the Earth Core Palace, the denser the Origin Energy would be.

The fifth floor, where the relic was stored, represented the core of the Earth Core Palace, so it was only natural that the Origin Energy was denser.

”?I wonder what the relic is,?” Jian Wushuang thought with a hint of curiosity while looking around.

This was a dim open area with only a gleam of faint light.

It was a streak of red light.

Jian Wushuang was unable to see the surroundings clearly, so he could only walk toward the red light.

The closer he approached, the brighter the red light became. It even became somewhat dazzling.

When he was dozens of feet away from the red light, he finally saw it clearly. Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded and felt as if his scalp would burst.

This streak of red light, the only light on the fifth floor, turned out to be... to be a scarlet finger.

Right, it was a broken finger, the same as human’s, but it was much larger.

It was 10 feet long, as large as a normal human.

“Such a big finger, and it’s just a broken one?”

Jian Wushuang was shaken. He also realized that it was the broken scarlet finger that represented the core of the fifth floor and the source of everything.

The Origin Energy here, which was countless times denser than in the outside world, radiated from this broken finger.

It meant that this broken finger was the relic that supported the entire human population.

This broken finger was the relic!

“I had been guessing at what the relic could be, but now...” Jian Wushuang sighed.

He did not expect a broken finger to be the relic. Because of this broken finger, the Earth Core Palace appeared and the human population had survived, even under suppression of Demonic Beasts.

“For a broken finger to have such an amazing power. Who is the owner of this broken finger??” Jian Wushuang wondered.

He was not clear about its origin, but he was definitely sure that its owner must have come from somewhere outside of this Ancient World.

He breathed deeply, recovering from his shock, and looked over at the broken finger.

“What’s the special nature of this broken finger?”

Jian Wushuang was deep in thought. He sat before this broken finger as his consciousness began to sweep toward it.

Once he finished covering with his consciousness, he felt a response from the broken finger. Buzz... a stream of overwhelming information was transmitted over.

“This is!” Jian Wushuang widened his eyes.

“Inheritance, this is an Inheritance!”

He was greatly taken aback.

An Inheritance was a sort of way in which someone instilled his knowledge in others. Jian Wushuang had heard of it, but he had not experienced before.

Jian Wushuang immediately knew what the content was.

“The Inheritance is the Bone Fusion Technique and it seems to be a complete Inheritance,” He murmured.

Then he closed his eyes and began to truly inherit Bone Fusion Technique.

It started from the first level.

Then it progressed to Level Two, Level Three...

He had mastered Level 10 of the Bone Fusion Technique, so he did not take it seriously. What he really cared about was the last two levels of the Bone Fusion Technique.

“Level 11!”

Jian Wushuang thought with expectation. Now he was inheriting the Level 11 manual.

Level 11 was far more complicated than Level 10. Furthermore, he realized that not everyone was able to receive it.
