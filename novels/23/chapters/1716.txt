Chapter 1717: He Xiu Shows Himself

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In a flash, another eight years passed.

From the time that He Xiu had escaped into the Hong Ming Mountain to the present, more than twenty years had passed.

With over twenty years of time as well as so many experts searching crazily in the Hong Ming Mountain, He Xiu was still not found. Hence, quite a number of people could not help but wonder if He Xiu was still inside the Hong Ming Mountain.

Or perhaps someone had already found He Xiu, killed him, snatched the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas away and escaped stealthily after that.

Although there were some suspicions, many experts still did not give up.

…

In a gorge of the You Ming Mountain, there were many buildings. This place was a lair of a big group of bandits.

Within a secret room, ten figures were gathered together and the person sitting at the highest point was a hunchbacked old man with an extremely evil aura.

The hunchbacked old man had gloomy eyes. However, his expression was a bit pale.

“During this period of time, You Ming Mountain has not been very peaceful and even our men feel a bit restless.”

The hunchbacked old man slammed his supporting chair and his indifferent voice resounded within the secret room. After that, he looked at a crafty-looking, black-haired youth, “Xue He, I have gotten you to observe the movements of Second Brother and Third Brother closely. How has it been?”

“Long Ye, for this period of time, the Second Leader and Third Leader have been having secret conversions frequently and they are extremely secretive. Our people are totally unable to mix in with them and we have no idea what they are discussing. However, from their movements, they are probably preparing to take action,” the black-haired youth answered.

“Hmph, they are really preparing to rebel!” the hunchbacked old man’s eyes were filled with fury and his aura roused, causing the whole secret room to be filled with a cold frost.

“The Second Leader and Third Leader have been restless for many days. But on normal days, due to your abilities, they did not dare to act recklessly. However, this time around, as you are injured… they found an opportunity,” the black-haired youth said.

“Two thankless wretches. If I had known that this would happen, I would have killed the both of them back then,” the hunchbacked old man bellowed loudly and he was filled with hatred.

He was an extremely powerful Real God who stood at the top of the Void Real Gods and on normal days, he stood by his words within the group of bandits.

Even if the two Leaders under him were to have some small motives, with him suppressing them, they did not do anything that was out of the ordinary. Hence, he did not take action against the both of them.

However, this time around, many experts were looking for traces of He Xiu in the You Ming Mountain. Hence, bandits like them were implicated. Not long ago, some experts came to their territory. As those few experts wanted to search the Qian Kun Rings of all the Universe Gods under him, they ended up in a conflict with them and a big fight broke out as a result.

Although those few experts were repelled in the end, he was seriously injured and to date he had not even recovered fifty percent of his abilities.

Hence, this allowed the two Leaders under him to find an opportunity.

The hunchbacked old man was discussing with everyone how to deal with the two Leaders. However, all of a sudden, the big door of the secret room was kicked open. After that, a big group of people came in and the people right in front of them were the two Leaders.

“Second Brother and Third Brother, both of you are really going to rebel?” the hunchbacked old man smote the table and stood up in anger.

“Haha, we have been unable to stand an old bastard like you since long ago. Since we have an opportunity this time around, how can we let it go? Since everyone happens to be here, we shall kill of you together!”

With an order from the two Leaders, many of the bandits under them charged in immediately.

A great battle burst forth instantly.

On the battlefield, the hunchbacked old man’s side was definitely at a disadvantage and it was very one-sided. Under the siege of the two Leaders, the hunchbacked old man himself was also in imminent danger. Thus, the people under him were probably in a worse condition.

Swoosh!

A strange figure was shuffling back and forth in the battlefield. This person was the crafty-looking black-haired youth known as Xue He. Although he looked ugly, his abilities were outstanding. The black knife that he held in one of his hands was either swung from time to time or swung cunningly with an extremely fast speed and it swept past the bodies of many Universe Gods.

After just a short amount of time, Xue He had already killed six Universe Gods.

“Little kid, your abilities are not too bad. No wonder you have such a high position after joining for only ten years. However, it’s a pity that you have followed the wrong person. Brothers, kill him!”

After a purple-clothed man bellowed loudly, a total of ten bandits besieged Xue He immediately.

Those bandits were all Universe Gods and there was a total of five Universe Gods of the Third Heaven among them. With all of them teaming up and besieging Xue He, he could only retreat again and again in defeat.

“No, I won’t be able to last any longer!” Xue He’s eyes were cold and he was looking at the situation around him.

Those bandits had surrounded him from all sides and he could not find any opportunity to escape unless he could kill all of them.

However, with that…

“I have no choice!” All of a sudden, Xue He’s eyes turned cold and his aura changed greatly in an instant.

Originally, he had looked crafty and wretched. However, at that moment, it was just like the hell-killing gods.

All of a sudden, a Crimson Sword swept past the area and many rays of crimson light appeared in the void repeatedly.

The rays of crimson light were like crimson lotuses which had blossomed. The sad, beautiful scenery then attracted the attention of many Universe Gods around the area.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! ~~~

The sounds of the cutting edge of a sword piercing through bodies could be heard repeatedly.

In an instant, the throats of the ten bandits who had besieged Xue He were pierced and their lives dissipated.

Such a scene then caused those surrounding bandits who were fighting to be extremely shocked.

“How is this possible?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“He killed ten Universe Gods, including five Universe Gods of the Third Heaven, with one stroke. This Xue He is actually so strong?”

“No, that’s wrong. Xue He has always used a black knife as his weapon. When did it change into a sword? Moreover, his fighting capabilities are so strong?”

The surrounding people were so astonished that they were stunned.

Even the hunchbacked old man, Long Ye, who was fighting, as well as the two Leaders, looked over.

“This is…” Long Ye opened his eyes wide.

They were not idiots. Xue He has obviously been hiding his abilities intentionally. Moreover, he had even hidden the weapon that he used.

The most important thing was that even his own aura had changed completely.

This was a group of bandits and there was absolutely no need to hide anything. However, Xue He had hidden himself so deeply. By thinking of the Crimson Sword that he used as well as when he joined the group of bandits…

“He Xiu!”

“He is He Xiu!”

Long Ye was the first person to roar.

“He Xiu!”

The two Leaders also cried out in alarm.

At the next moment, the three people who were originally fighting stopped and three pairs of eyes which were burning with excitement looked at ‘Xue He.’

It was not fake that they were having an internal fight for the sake of their own benefit. However, these benefits were considered nothing compared to the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas that He Xiu possessed.

“Kill him!”

“Capture him.”

Many of the bandits who were originally fighting madly buried the hatchet instantly and headed toward ‘Xue He.”

“Run!”

‘Xue He’ also did not hesitate in the slightest and he started to run away crazily at once. While running, he no longer concealed any of his abilities.
