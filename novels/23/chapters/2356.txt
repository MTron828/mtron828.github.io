Chapter 2357: Commandery Governor

“Even though that was a very casual finger, a tier three Chaotic Divine Demon will find it difficult to stop it. However, this little one could stop it head-on. He is much stronger than what I have heard from others. He might have the fighting power of tier two Chaotic Divine Demon!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“And he is only in the Chaotic Realm? Furthermore, he is not even twenty years old yet!!!”

“I have never heard of someone so insanely talented ever since I started cultivating. As compared to him, the Twelve Young Kings from the Wusha Barren Region seemed like ordinary cultivators!”

The elder man with red eyebrows looked at Jian Wushuang. His eyes sparkled with desire like never before.

He soon hid the desire away.

He gathered himself and said to Jian Wushuang, “Little one. You have killed one of the disciples from the Water Fairy Island. By right, I should kill you. However, considering that the disciple provoked you first, I will spare you life, on the condition that you will go to the Water Fairy Island with me.”

“Go to the Water Fairy island?” Jian Wushuang was stunned. He soon thought of the reason why.

The elder with red eyebrows never wanted to take revenge for the disciple he killed. He was here to recruit him!

“What is going on? Didn’t Jian Wushuang kill one of the disciples from the Water Fairy Island? Why doesn’t this tier one Chaotic Divine Demon from the Water Fairy Island seem like he is going to punish him?” Xiang Yi knitted his eyebrows and said.

“It is normal.” Qian Yuan shook his head and smiled. “If I am not wrong, the disciple that Jian Wushuang killed was an ordinary in the Water Fairy Island hence they would not care even if some of them died. They will only send in experts to resolve the problem as a way to protect their reputation. However, a tier one Chaotic Divine Demon came down personally. He is definitely not here to take revenge for the dead disciple. He probably came to recruit Jian Wushuang.”

“Even though Jian Wushuang killed three junior brothers from the Golden Cauldron Sect, I still have to admit that he is an incredibly talented cultivator with potential so great it is beyond our wildest imagination. It will be weird if the Water Fairy Island does not want to recruit such an incredibly talented teenager. Since the ordinary disciple already died, they will just forget about it as Jian Wushuang is far more valuable.”

Xiang Yi nodded his head after he heard what Qian Yuan said.

“This is bad. If Jian Wushuang agrees to go to the Water Fairy Island with the tier one Chaotic Divine Demon, he would be one of the most influential cultivators there given his talent. The Water Fairy Island will definitely pay greater attention to him as compared to the Twelve Young Kings. How will the Golden Cauldron Sect kill him when he is under the protection of the Water Fairy Island?” Xiang Yi said coldly.

Qian Yuan knitted his eyebrows before waving his hands and said, “Do not panic. Let’s see what happens.”

Within the Lin Mansion, many of the people understood the purpose behind the elder man’s visit after hearing what he said.

The experts within the Lin Mansion, including Zhuo Yunfeng and Lin Tiefeng, heaved a sigh of relief.

“I thought that the expert from the Water Fairy Island was here to take revenge. It seems like I worry too much.” Lin Tiefeng sighed softly.

“Wushuang is incredibly talented. It is normal that the Water Fairy Island will pay heavy attention to him. Now, I am afraid that Wushuang will continue to be stubborn and reject the offer. Since young, he prefers to cultivate freely, without any restrictions at all.” Zhuo Yunfeng said.

“Reject? The Water Fairy Island is one of the top ten clans in the Wusha Barren Region, he will reject their offer?” Lin Tiefeng was shocked.

Zhuo Yunfeng shook his head lightly. After today’s battle, he was sure that the deduction his wife, Luo Xinqin, made was true.

Jian Wushuang was highly likely a top tier expert who reincarnated.

If this was true, he knew that Jian Wushuang would not join any clan from the Wusha Barren Region, even the Water Fairy Island. Jian Wushuang would not be bothered to join it.

Jian Wushuang said, “I do not like restrictions. I will not go to the Water Fairy Island.”

“Little one, it is not up to you.” The elder with red eyebrows said with absolute confidence.

“It is not up to me? I do not think so.” Jian Wushuang said as he raised his eyebrows.

The elder with red eyebrows squinted his eyes.

“Wu Jian. Since the little one is not willing to go to the Water Fairy Island, are you going to bring him there by force?” A playful laugh was heard out of nowhere.

Suddenly, a figure appeared in the air above the Lin Mansion.

It was a handsome and calm man. He wore a simple green shirt. He stood there and radiated a warm aura.

When this man appeared, Lin Tiefeng and the head of the Xiang Family, Xiang Zong, widened their eyes in shock.

In the next moment, they greeted the man in unison.

“Greetings, Lord Commandery Governor!!”

The identity of the man was revealed after the greeting.

Commandery Governor!

The most powerful and authoritative man in the Anjiu Prefecture, the Commandery Governor!

“It is him.” Jian Wushuang looked at the man. He was not surprised.

Before he started fighting the experts from the Golden Calderon Sect, his soul power could detect a faint aura hiding in the dark.

Jian Wushuang had a much more powerful soul power sensory ability as compared to the rest. If not, he would not have detected the Commandery Governor.

Jian Wushuang knew immediately that there was a top tier expert hidden in the dark.

Jian Wushuang also guessed that this top tier expert was likely the Commandery Governor of the Anjiu Prefecture.

After all, his job was not only maintaining peace and tranquility in the Anjiu Prefecture.

He would also take note of certain geniuses, especially the very talented geniuses. If he felt that these talented geniuses had great potential, he would recommend them with his position as a Commandery Governor to the suitable clans for cultivation.

If the clan was satisfied with the expert, they would reward the Commandery Governor handsomely.

Jian Wushuang was already well known for his name. Furthermore, the legendary Taoist Priest Xuan Shen gave him the name personally. Jian Wushuang predicted that the Commandery Governor had been observing him for a very long time.

However, Jian Wushuang always remained lowkey and never displayed his incredible talent. This made it difficult for the Commandery Governor to make an accurate judgment of his true abilities.

However, after Jian Wushuang showed his true power, during the fighting three months ago when he killed two Chaotic Divine Demons while he was only in the Chaotic Realm, the Commandery Governor would definitely know of it.

This time, Jian Wushuang was in grave danger. Hence, the Commandery Governor had to interfere.

From the start, the Commandery Governor had always been in the dark, observing. Even if Jian Wushuang did not show his true power and defeated the Chaotic Divine Demons from the Golden Calderon Sect, there was no way Xiang Yi would kill him as the Commandery Governor would definitely save him.
