Chapter 2410: Safety Token

“Senior Brother Ling Dan, I know what I am doing. You don’t have to tell me what to do.” Zhuo Bing gave a sideway glance at Ling Dan.

“Junior Sister, I am doing this for your own good. This is the only Safety Token you have which Elder Kang painstakingly got it from the Temple Master. How can you simply give it away to an outsider?” said Ling Dan.

“Since the Temple Master has given it to me, it’s now mine. I shall decide on how it’s used. Besides, I’m not giving it away to an outsider. He is my brother, not an outsider,” said Zhuo Bing coldly.

“Brother?” Ling Dan was shocked. He subconsciously glanced at Jian Wushuang and found the latter looking at him with a smile.

“He... He is your brother?”

From that moment onwards, Ling Dan looked very differently at Jian Wushuang.

He was initially a little cold and wary of Jian Wushuang. However, his expression softened, and even had a gentle smile on his face after realizing who Jian Wushuang was.

“I see. May I know your name, brother?” asked Ling Dan with a smile.

“Jian Wushuang.” Jian Wushuang uttered his name.

“So you are Brother Wushuang.” Ling Dan smiled.

“Brother?” Jian Wushuang was startled that his expression was even weirder than before.

He could notice Ling Dan was interested in his elder sister, but he seemed a little muddle-headed.

“The Saint’s Tomb is a dangerous place. It’s indeed a risky place for Brother Wushuang who is of Chaotic Realm. It’s necessary to have a Safety Token for protecting your life, but instead of using Junior Sister’s, I’ll give you mine.” Ling Dan took out his Safety Token and gave it to Jian Wushuang.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his brows and glanced at Ling Dan in surprise.

‘Although this guy is a little stupid, he seems to have a good heart. This Safety Token is equivalent to an additional life in the Saint’s Tomb, yet he is willing to give away such an important item on behalf of my big sister. It seems that he really is sincere to my big sister.’

Zhuo Bing was also a little surprised, but she curtly turned Ling Dan down. “I will just give my Safety Token to my little brother. Brother Ling Dan need not be worried.”

“It’s alright, it’s just a Safety Token. It’s kinda useless to me,” said a confident-sounding Ling Dan.

What he had said was true. As one of the Twelve Minor Kings, he could still put up a good fight even if he encountered Peak Divine Demons. An expert like him would be safe within Saint’s Tomb as long he was careful.

Zhuo Bing frowned.

Jian Wushuang spoke, “Big Sister, Brother Ling Dan, I understand your kindness. Actually, I don’t need the Safety Token.”

“Stop fooling around.” Zhuo Bing glared at him. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Big Sister, what I said is the truth. Your little brother is actually not as weak as you think. I really don’t need the Safety Token. Although there is danger everywhere in the Saint’s tomb, I have Brother Zhong Yi with me. I’ll just be careful and not contest for the final six seats. In that case, I think I’ll be fine,” said Jian Wushuang.

Zhuo Bing was still a little worried, she took a deep look at Jian Wushuang and asked, “Will you really give up competing for those six seats?”

“Of course, Big Sister. Think about it. Am I not seeking death if I’m to fight for those six seats as a Chaotic Realm? I haven’t lived long enough.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

What he said to Zhuo Bing was merely perfunctory.

Giving up the fight for those six seats?

What a joke! He was there for those six seats!

“In that case, forget it.”

Zhuo Bing did not insist any further and took back the Safety Token. “Brother, you must be careful in the Saint’s Tomb. Don’t be aggressive. Don’t make a fool of yourself.”

“That’s for sure.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“No. I’m still worried, so you should just stay with me from now on,” said Zhuo Bing.

“No need for that.” Jian Wushuang rolled his eyes. “Senior Brother Zhong Yi takes care of me. He kept wanting me to stay by his side before. With Senior Brother Zhong Yi and the others, I won’t be in any danger.”

Zhuo Bing pondered for a moment hearing that and finally nodded. “Well, then you should be extra careful.”

“Zhong Yi, thank you for taking care of my little brother,” said Zhuo Bing.

“Miss Zhuo Bing can rest assured, Junior Brother Jian Wushuang is from the same school as us. I’ll definitely do my best to protect him,” said Zhong Yi assuringly.

“Thank you. The Black Thunder Pavilion and the Cold Blood Palace have been eyeing your group. Although they have temporarily retreated, it’s not guaranteed they will just simply let you off. After all, both your groups are near to each other. It’s easy for them to attack you, so I think it’s better for you to go earlier into the inner area to restore your state of power and realm.” Zhuo Bing looked around at the several Narcissus Island disciples whose powers were extremely weak now.

Especially Wei Qing, his face was pale.

If they faced another attack from Black Thunder Pavilion and Cold Blood Palace, it would be difficult for them to parry off the attack.

“Understood, we will consider it.” Zhong Yi nodded slightly.

“We will make a move first.”

Zhuo Bing and Ling Dan did not linger around. After giving advice to Jian Wushuang, the Ancient God Temple’s party left.

Zhuo Bing wanted to bring Jian Wushuang along but Jian Wushuang refused. Moreover, she was also responsible for the Ancient God Temple disciples who might not want to stay with Jian Wushuang, who seemed like a burden. She had to eventually give up on her idea.

After Zhuo Bing and the others left...

“Jian Wushuang, I didn’t expect the famous Ice Queen to be your big sister?”

“Ice Queen, her behavior is crazy and domineering as her name suggests, and she is really powerful. You have seen her combat skills, haven’t you? Tang Xiao was nowhere her match.”

The fellow Narcissus Island core disciples were raving about the Ice Queen.

Jian Wushuang did not say much and just casually smiled.

He was actually very surprised.

After a while, Narcissus Island disciples were back in focus.

Zhong Yi and Su Tong stood together.

“In the previous battle, all five of us have suffered varying degrees of injuries, especially Junior Brother Wei Qing, whose injuries are serious. Our combat powers are less than 10 percent of our normal state. It’s indeed not suitable for us to wander in this outer area,” said Su Tong.

“Well, what Miss Zhuo Bing said just now is correct. We have to depart ahead of time toward the inner area. There should be no one in the inner area at this time. We can go there to restore our divine powers and realm state first.” Zhong Yi also nodded.

Initially, their plan was to stay in the outer area for ten days and collect more Purple Amulets before heading into the inner area, but they had to change their plans.
