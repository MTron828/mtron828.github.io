Chapter 2525: Furious

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Earlier, when he was breaking through from the Second-Class Divine Demon to the First-Class Divine Demon, Jian Wushuang used almost 10,000 Primordial Stones and the entire Divine Power Ocean in Saint’s Tomb. At that time, he had reached a certain level in Second-Class Divine Demon and he had also been cultivating to improve his divine power. All in all, he probably needed 20,000 Primordial Stones to make a breakthrough from Second-Class to First-Class Divine Demon.

Hence, if he wanted to make a breakthrough from First-Class Divine Demon to Peak Divine Demon, he would need multiple times more divine power.

Jian Wushuang estimated he would need at least 100,000 Primordial Stones to make a breakthrough to the next level, hence having only around 90,000 Primordial Stones were not sufficient. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Unless...he would destroy another prefecture.

However, Jian Wushuang shook that thought off his mind.

“Can’t do this anymore,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

He knew his successes in destroying the Demonic Moon Prefecture, Heaven Poison Prefecture and Underworld Prefecture were because of two main reasons.

First of all, those three prefectures were the weakest in strength among the Eighteen Prefectures as they were ranked the bottom three. Not only were their combat prowess much weaker than other prefectures, but so were their techniques. The formations protecting and shielding their prefectures were so weak that Jian Wushuang could easily annihilate those formations just by relying on the Prison of Punishment.

On the other hand, the other prefectures were different as they had stronger combat powers and more advanced techniques. It would not be as easy for Jian Wushuang to handle them.

Secondly, he was able to succeed one after another because of his fast pace while not allowing time for the prefectures to react and plan their counterattacks.

Ten days had passed since he started with the first prefecture and ended with the third. The other prefectures would have gotten news by now and came up with strategies to protect themselves.

Jian Wushuang guessed the remaining 15 prefectures were probably boiling in rage and were already discussing how to deal with him should he seek them out.

Under such circumstances, it was unlikely for him to succeed in destroying another prefecture.

He could not stay in the Dark Thunder Territory any longer as well.

“Tiexin, let’s go,” said Jian Wushuang.

...

Just as Jian Wushuang had anticipated, his deeds in the past ten days spread like wildfire and caused a huge sensation in the entire Dark Thunder Territory.

The remaining 15 prefectures were furious.

Those Eighteen Prefectures had internal conflicts and struggles but they had always been united against any outsiders that were against any of them.

The other 15 prefectures had reacted immediately upon the destruction of those three.

In a magnificent palace, many experts from those 15 prefectures had gathered. Although not all of them were their prefecture’s governor, all of them were powerful Ultimate Gods.

“I’ve already figured out the culprit. It’s this golden-robed man with a sword who did that to Demonic Moon Prefecture, Heaven Poison Prefecture, and Underworld Prefecture,” said a purple-clothed old man.

Despite Jian Wushuang performing the Prison of Punishment Technique to prevent bandits from escaping, that technique could not prevent those bandits from communicating with others through sending messages. Therefore, information about Jian Wushuang’s appearance, characteristics, strength, and skills had been leaked.

“This golden-robed man is good with the sword on top of having a profound understanding of Space-time Law which he can produce eleven apparitions at the same time. His command of the Space-time Law is no less than a Peak Divine Demon’s and he’s extremely clever with his techniques. Though his combat prowess is only at the Primary-Level Ultimate God, he’s able to kill High-Level Ultimate Gods. When he attacked the three prefectures, he first created a Golden Prison which prevented those experts from escaping before performing domain techniques to suppress those trapped experts before killing them directly.”

“There were many experts in the three prefectures with nearly thirty Primary-Level Ultimate Gods and three High-Level Ultimate Gods, but all of them were killed!”

“The problem is we don’t even know the golden-robed man’s origins. We don’t even know his name. We only know he appeared along with the Xueya Escort Team. According to our intelligence, the Xueya Escort Team has already left the central area.” The purple-clothed old man frowned.

“Hmph, it doesn’t matter what’s his origin or whether he’s with the Xueya Escort Team. We must not allow him to leave the Dark Thunder Territory alive since he launched an attack on our Eighteen Prefectures and wiped out three prefectures in one go. Otherwise, how will the eighteen... No, Fifteen Prefectures show ourselves to the world? From now on, those clans in Northern Darkstar Territory will think we are weak and they can bully us, ” commented a burly middle-aged man.

“Yes, whoever attacks us must die!”

“According to our intelligence, although this golden-robed man can destroy three prefectures with his own powers, he mainly relied on his Golden Prison which prevents experts from escaping. As for his true combat strength, he’s actually only at the High-Level Ultimate God. There are many of us amongst the Fifteen Prefectures that can kill him!”

Inside the palace, the faces of the experts were stern and somber with their eyes flashing in anger.

At that instance...

A red-haired woman suddenly looked up and said in a deep voice, “There’s news. I just got news from my subordinates about the golden-robed man. He’s currently around Firmament Mountains while someone is keeping an eye on him.”

“Firmament Mountains?” The purple-clothed old man seated in the higher position had a grim look, “The Infernal Heart Prefecture—one of the top three prefectures was not far away. Send a message immediately to the Governor of Infernal Heart Prefecture and ask him to take action and kill the golden-robed man. Besides, the Blood Light Prefecture is closest to Firmament Mountains. The Luo Brothers of Blood Light Prefecture are very powerful. They might not be able to kill the golden-robed man, but it shouldn’t be a problem to stop him. Send both of them a message as well so that they can take action as soon as possible.”

“No matter what’s the price, the golden-robed man must be killed!”

The experts in the palace had strong murderous intent.

...

Firmament Mountains was an ordinary mountain in the center of the Dark Thunder Territory.

Jian Wushuang did not know the mountain’s name. He was soaring above the Firmament Mountains alone.

He was not moving fast nor did he hide. In short, he was just swaggering in the void.

He was also using a message token to communicate with Xiao Tiexin while moving about.

“Tiexin, how are you doing with your escort team?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“We’ll be able to leave the central area soon. There are bandits who often drop by to spy on us but they didn’t stay for too long,” said Xiao Tiexin.

“That’s normal. I think they have their eyes on me now and will probably not pay much attention to you,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.
