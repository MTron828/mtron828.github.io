Chapter 1381: Hatred

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“How can be it possible?”

The man in the golden mask was shocked.

So were other members in the Hungry Wolves Clan and Xue Feng’s group.

Jian Wushuang not only was a level-three Soul Master with formidable power, but had other formidable skills??

He had defeated a three-level Divine General?

Seriously?

No one could believe their eyes.

Even Jian Wushuang was surprised to see that he was powerful enough to blast the man out with only one sword.

But he soon realized why.

Soul Masters were more powerful than Divine General of the same level, not because Soul Masters were geniuses, but because Divine Generals were relatively weak in the whole Tian Ling Mystery Land.

Jian Wushuang knew that at the beginning of the battle.

Although the man was a level-three Divine General, equivalent to a Universe God in the Third Heaven of the Eternal Chaotic World, but he was absolutely not as powerful as he was supposed to be.

Jian Wushuang grinned, “I think his Divine Power was no more than the level of a Peak Universe God in the Second Heaven. I guess he doesn’t even know what secret skills are.”

“Go!”

The gold-masked man chose to escape.

But Jian Wushuang didn’t give him any opportunity.

He waved his sword as fast as a flash, using Soul Attack that the man couldn’t resist at all.

The sword stabbed through the man’s throat.

The man died. Seeing this, his members were scared to death and ran away as fast as they could.

Jian Wushuang didn’t follow them.

Everything became peaceful again.

Xue Feng and Xue Feng went to Jian Wushuang with fear.

“Thank you, Master Wu Shuang.” Xue Feng showed his respect. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Other members except Xue Feng didn’t even dare to look at him.

Jian Wushuang was so formidable for them.

“Are you OK?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes. Without your help, we couldn’t escape from death.” Xue Feng said gratefully, “All the cultivators will respect and admire you if they know you have killed a vicious gang for us.”

“It’s just a little help, worth nothing.” Jian Wushuang said, “Let’s set out again.”

“OK.”

Soon they went on with the journey.

But on the journey, everyone was silent, continuously recalling what had happened.

When they left the forest, Xue Tong, after a long time of consideration, said to Jian Wushuang, “Could I be your disciple? I can serve you for my life.”

Jian Wushuang felt surprised.

Xue Feng also said sincerely, “My sister is gifted in consciousness and she works hard. We will be grateful if you could accept her.”

After all, few talents were as powerful as Jian Wushuang.

And Xue Feng and Xue Tong didn’t want to miss the chance.

Jian Wushuang showed his hesitation.

Xue Tong looked at Jian Wushuang with great eagerness.

But Jian Wushuang said, “Sorry, I can’t.”

He had to refuse.

First, he would leave the Tian Ling Mystery Land soon.

Second, and more importantly, he was not qualified to teach her.

His control on consciousness was actually not as good as Xue Tong.

So he had no other choices.

Xue Tong felt disappointed.

So was Xue Feng. But he continued to say, “Or, could you please introduce another Soul Master to us?”

Jian Wushuang became unhappy about Xue Feng’s requirement.

Even Xue Tong was annoyed by her brother.

He shouldn’t ask for that much.

After all, Jian Wushuang had saved them but it was not his responsibility.

“Sorry.” Xue Feng realized he was imprudent.

“Why do you want to find a master for you sister so urgently?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Xue Feng paused for a while and said, “To be honest, it is because we have to take revenge for our parents, our family members, and all others in our tribe, who were killed by our enemies.”

“However, I lost the opportunity to cultivate to be a talent. So all the hopes fall on my sister.”

“She is gifted in consciousness. If she can learn from a talent and be an excellent Soul Master, we could take revenge!”

Xue Feng clenched his hands.

Jian Wushuang also saw the hatred in their eyes.

The scene resonated Jian Wushuang.

Since he had started to journey of cultivation, he also had been bearing such a hatred.

Just like Xue Feng and Xue Tong.

It was the hatred that led him to make such great progress.
