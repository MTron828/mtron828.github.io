Chapter 2836: Departure, Dragon-Phoenix Sacred City

——

“Actually, this agreement is very simple. Without the consent of the Bone Emperor, those sector lords are not allowed to set foot in other realms. In this way, even if the eight realms want to fight, only the Great Divine Masters and the Army of Divine Masters can fight. However, unless those undying saints have a deep hatred, they will not really fight to the death. This is also to ensure the combat strength of the Undying Saints of the Golden Crow Nine Realms.”

“After all, there are external enemies in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. Once they encounter an external enemy, the Divine Master’s battle strength is almost useless. It’s all because of the Immortal Saints,” Yin Su’er said.

“Is this the agreement?” Jian Wushuang’s expression was rather strange.

“Don’t underestimate this agreement. If it weren’t for the existence of this agreement, our Pill Sun Sacred World would have been destroyed by the Heavenly Void World or other realms,” Yin Su’er said.

Jian Wushuang also understood.

Indeed, if the realm lords of other realms could freely enter and exit the Sacred Sundan World, the Immortal Saint would have personally arrived. After the Sacred Sundan World lost the protection of Saint Crimson Stone, it would have been completely destroyed.

The Heavenly Void World did not need to send such a large army.

Moreover, the Heavenly Void World had suffered a great loss in Jian Wushuang’s hands. Therefore, even if they wanted to take revenge, it would be difficult.

“Lord Mo is in the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City. So it seems that I have to go to the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“When will you leave, Mr. Sword One?” Yin Su’er asked.

“I’ll go back to the Sword Alliance and make some arrangements. Then, after that, I’ll leave directly,” Jian Wushuang said.

“There is a passage leading directly to the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City in the Pill Sun Sacred World. Please inform me when you leave. I’ll order someone to open it,” Yin Su’er said.

“Okay.” Jian wushuang nodded and left.

...

In the Lofty Hall of the Sword Alliance, many high-level officials gathered together.

“Listen up. Although the Sword Alliance is extremely powerful and can threaten the status of Crimson Rock Castle, we have always been allies with Crimson Rock Castle. In the future, you must obey this rule and not take the initiative to become enemies with Crimson Rock Castle. In the future, the Sword Alliance will live in the current situation. Without my instructions, it can not continue to expand,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

Upon hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, the experts of the Sword Alliance changed their expressions and felt a little unwilling.

The current Sword Alliance had far surpassed the Crimson Rock Castle in terms of overall strength and prestige. Therefore, it would be too easy for them to replace the Crimson Rock Castle at this time. Even if they could not replace Crimson Rock Castle, it would be good if they could continue to expand. However, Jian Wushuang had given such an order.

“Master, will the Sword Alliance live in the current situation peacefully from now on?” Xiao Tiexin looked over with a frown.

“For now, but not in the future,” Jian Wushuang said, looking around. “Don’t worry, just bear with it for a while. At least a few decades, at most a hundred years. After that, I will give you a platform to expand as you wish.”

Hearing this, the eyes of the people of the Sword Alliance lit up again.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand to signal them to leave, leaving Xiao Tiexin alone.

“Xin ‘Er, I will leave the Pill Sun Sacred World for a while. After I leave, I will leave the matters in the Pill Sun Sacred World to you,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes.” Xiao Tiexin nodded respectfully.

She had been by Jian Wushuang’s side for many years. Since the founding of the Sword Alliance, she had been the chief supervisor here. Usually, she had been taking care of many things. Although her strength was not high, she did have great prestige in the Sword Alliance, and many people believed in her.

“Take this interspatial ring.” Jian Wushuang flipped his hand and handed an interspatial ring to Xiao Tiexin.

After taking it, Xiao Tiexin scanned it with his consciousness, but his eyes suddenly widened.

“Young master, this, this is...”

“It’s the corpse puppet army.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“I’m leaving this time because I want to explore the Golden Crow Nine Realms more. The corpse puppet army is of little use to me. I’ll leave them with you to manage them. On the one hand, it will help you better control the Sword Alliance. On the other hand... Although the Pill Sun Sacred World has temporarily calmed down, it’s hard to guarantee that there won’t be any more changes. If anything happens, I might not be able to come back in time. With the corpse puppet army, I can be slightly relieved.”

“That being said, there’s no need for you to keep all the corpse puppets, young master. Why don’t you bring a few more with you in case you need them?” Xiao Tiexin said.

“The blood-armored corpse puppet is powerful and useful to me. So I can take it with me. As for the other corpse puppets, I don’t need them.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

After saying a few more words, Jian Wushuang set off.

...

Dragon-phoenix Sacred City was the core of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow and one of the four most prosperous sacred cities.

Although it was only a sacred city, in fact, the territory of the sacred city was no smaller than that of the Danyang Continent in the Holy Sundan world.

There were countless cultivators from various realms in the sacred city, and the quality was very high.

In the south of Dragon-phoenix Sacred City, there was a vast open space with many huge spatial passages in the void.

These spatial passageways led to different realms. People often used these spatial passageways to return to their own realms. Naturally, cultivators from different realms also used these spatial passageways to come to the Sacred Dragon and Phoenix city.

At this moment, the light from one of the spatial passageways had already lit up.

In this open space, there were some soldiers wearing unique red battle armor standing guard. When the spatial passageways lit up, some of the soldiers looked over.

“Someone is coming again.”

“This space passage should lead to the Pill Sun Sacred World.”

“Pill Sun Sacred World?”

“I heard that the Realm Lord of Pill Sun Sacred World died a long time ago. There hasn’t been a second Immortal Saint born there. The Great Divine Masters in Pill Sun Sacred World have been fighting among themselves. Their overall strength has been greatly weakened. They have long become the weakest sacred world in the Golden Crow Nine Realms.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Hehe, this was a long time ago. I just heard that the internal conflict in the Pill Sun Sacred World has ended.”

The soldiers in red armor were chatting casually.

They were responsible for guarding the teleportation point in the spatial passage and were very well-informed. Most of them knew about the major events that happened in the various realms.

Buzz!

The light gradually faded, and a human figure walked out of the spatial tunnel.

This person wore a golden robe and carried a long sword on his back. His face was extremely young, and the aura that he emitted was that of a senior Great Divine Master.
