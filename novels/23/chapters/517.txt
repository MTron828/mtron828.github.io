Chapter 518: Blood Kylin Leather Armor

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang wandered around the third floor.

Many treasures were present, but Jian Wushuang realized that nearly half of them were used to strengthen the body. Jian Wushuang even saw Purple Heaven Thunderbolt and Ninth Heaven Thunderbolt.

Two valuable body-enhancing thunderbolts.

Many of these treasures were new and unknown to Jian Wushuang. Luckily there was a brief introduction for each item on the shelf.

Suddenly he was attracted by one.

“Blood Kylin Leather Armor?”

Jian Wushuang was reading the description on the shelf.

“Blood Kylin Leather Armor, refined from hides of Blood Kylin Demonic Beast of Rank Eight and corundum, has an amazing defense which reduces impact forces. Its price is eight million Raw Gems.”

Jian Wushuang was interested.

He had seen defensive armors, but none of them were convenient to wear. Besides, this had an amazing defense.

“Hides of Blood Kylin Demonic Beast at Rank Eight and corundum?” Qing Huo was shocked when he read that.

Rank Eight was equal to Eighth-cloud Realm. Rank Eight Monsters were peak monsters and only Rank Nine Monsters or Monster Kings rarer.

Blood Kylin Demonic Beast was a terrifying species among Rank Eight Monsters. They were good at defense. Their hard hides were so tough that only Divine Emperors could destroy them.

And corundum was the hardest ore Qing Huo knew.

An armor made of hides of Blood Kylin Demonic Beast of Rank Eight and corundum, how could it not be strong in defense.

“My strong body plus the Blood Kylin Leather Armor would surely improve my defense capability by a lot.”?Jian Wushuang squinted and thought.

The Blood Kylin Leather Armor was useful to him in strengthening his life-saving skill.

“Eight million Raw Gems,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

Just like in the Divine Land, people on the Monster Continent traded with Raw Gems.

But an ordinary First-grade Divine General on the Monster Continent could only have two million raw gems, far less than what a marquis in the Divine Land had.

In the Divine Land, there were only a few marquis experts. Each one was a top expert with a huge territory, surely they had more gems.

Even the weakest marquis in the Divine Land had more than ten million Raw Gems.

Jian Wushuang killed Marquis Nanyu and took his Interspatial Ring. So he was able to afford this.

“Fellow Wushuang, are you interested in the Blood Kylin Leather Armor?” Qing Huo looked towards him.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Keep its name in mind and pay for it at the counter downstairs.” Qing Huo said. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

They looked around some more, then went downstairs after not finding anything else they wanted.

At the counter of the hall on the first floor of Heaven Wing Pavilion.

“I want Blood Kylin Leather Armor,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Wait a moment.”

A purple-haired elder behind the counter nodded. Soon he brought a blood colored but thin armor to Jian Wushuang.

“Blood Kylin Leather Armor, eight million Raw Gems.” The purple-haired elder said.

“I don’t have that many Raw Gems, may I pay for it with other treasures?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“Okay.” The purple-haired elder nodded, “Heaven Wing Pavilion purchases all treasures at 90% of their selling price.”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. Not caring too much, he was going to take out some to buy the Blood Kylin Leather Armor.

Right at the moment...

“Wait!” A voice echoed.

Jian Wushuang turned and saw a red-haired man bearing a saber on his back walking towards him.

“It’s him?” Jian Wushuang recognized that it was Jin Ling, the other Second-grade Divine General from this assessment.

Jin Ling stepped forward and said to the purple-haired elder at the counter, “I’ll take it!”

Then he took out an Interspatial Ring.

Jian Wushuang’s face fell.

The purple-haired elder at the counter frowned and said, “Lord, I’m sorry but the Blood Kylin Leather Armor has already been bought by this Divine General.”

“I know. I just want to buy it and give it to him.” Jin Ling said with a smile and kindly looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Give it to me?” Jian Wushuang felt awkward.

They didn’t know each other well. It was just that both of them had passed the test and become Second-grade Divine Generals.

Why did Jin Ling want to give the Blood Kylin Leather Armor to him as a gift?

Eight million Raw Gems, only a few of the Second-grade Divine Generals on the Monster Continent could afford this.

“Jin Ling, why?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Just to make friends.” Jin Ling said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang didn’t believe this. Was he really so generous as to give him a Blood Kylin Leather Armor worth eight million Raw Gems as a friendship gift?

After paying, Jin Ling passed it to Jian Wushuang.

“Thanks,” Jian Wushuang thanked him and took it.

“Qing Huo, let’s go,” Jian Wushuang said. Then they walked out of the Heaven Wing Pavilion.

“Wait,” Jin Ling shouted.

Jian Wushuang stopped and looked back to Jin Ling, “Jin Ling, anything else?”

Jin Ling’s mouth curled up.

Why did he give it to him if he had no request?

“There is one thing. Brother Wushuang, I know Emperor Fengxiao gave you a Jade Slip!” Jin Ling said with a smile and called him brother.

“Yes?” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“The thing is, the Jade Slip Emperor Fengxiao gave you is important to me. Therefore, I hope you can sell it to me. I promise to give you a good price.” Jin Ling said earnestly.

“Buy the Jade Slip from me?” Jian Wushuang looked at Jin Ling with an interesting smile.
