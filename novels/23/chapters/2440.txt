Chapter 2441: The Target of All

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“We from Narcissus Island will not offer a resolution!”

Elder Linghe said with absolute firmness and she had enough reasons to do so.

It was because Narcissus Island was on the side of reason, that she could stand her ground.

“Linghe, what do you mean by that? Are our sect geniuses meant to just die in vain?” Hanyun growled softly.

“It’s a shame that your disciples died, but they’re to be blamed for not being skillful enough. Narcissus Island can’t take the blame. After all, they were the ones who took the initiative to snatch Jian Wushuang’s position tokens. He couldn’t just not defend himself and present his head to the others, could he?” Elder Linghe said.

Hearing her words, they could not argue even though those experts were angry.

The fact that they were coveting for what another person had obtained and tried snatching it away, but only to get killed instead due to their own technical deficiencies. That was not something they could blame the other person for.

“You’re right, Linghe. The competition for position tokens has always been something we leave up to fate. Our disciples died from their own undoing and could only blame themselves. If that’s the case since Jian Wushuang possesses three position tokens, that would mean it’s equally feasible for our Great Compassion Sect disciples to kill him during the tokens snatching process,” said Hanyun.

“Of course, it’s a battle of opportunities and there are bound to be occurrences of deaths,” said Elder Linghe.

“Very well then, we’re glad to have your word. Let’s go!” Hanyun waved his hand before those experts from the Great Compassion Sect turned around and left.

As for the remaining other sects’ experts, they could do nothing else but to follow suit after seeing that the Great Compassion Sect leaving despite still feeling dissatisfied.

Elder Linghe, Elder Wujian, and Seventh Elder gathered immediately upon the departure of those experts.

“Second Elder, it’s apparent that Hanyun wants Jian Wushuang to die in Saint’s Tomb from his words. Why didn’t you stop him?” Elder Wujian frowned.

Elder Linghe’s voice lowered, “Stop him? How to stop him? Jian Wushuang had a run-in with so many sects at once and got into such a big trouble. It’s fortunate that this happened over the fight for opportunities and it wouldn’t implicate Narcissus Island. However, if we still force our way through and defend him, how do you suppose we could negotiate with sects like the Great Compassion Sect?”

“Are we to just watch the Great Compassion Sect destroy Jian Wushuang?” Elder Wujian was not having it.

“It’s something that can’t be helped. He was the one who got himself into that mess and will have to bear the consequences. We from Narcissus Island could help him within our means. As for whether he could overcome this ordeal, it really depends on himself,” said Elder Linghe.

Elder Wujian kept quiet upon hearing that.

Indeed, that was too big of an issue, making it impossible for Narcissus Island to completely defend Jian Wushuang. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Wujian, you have the best relationship with Jian Wushuang among us three and also the only person who has his message token. Go ahead and have a good talk with him. Tell him what just transpired here, just so that he has some prior preparation,” said Elder Linghe.

Elder Wujian nodded slightly and took out Jian Wushuang’s message token.

“Jian Wushuang,” Elder Wujian immediately sent him a message.

“Elder Wujian, I knew you would immediately look for me.” Jian Wushuang replied very soon with his absolutely calm tone.

“You’ve got into a big mess. Why are you not worried at all?” Elder Wujian surprisingly said.

“Wasn’t that about killing just one or two genius disciples? What’s the big deal?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“What do you mean one or two? You’ve killed a total of 70 to 80 geniuses from close to 20 sects. That aside, the most important part is that you even killed Pang Tao! He’s from the Great Compassion Sect and the personal disciple of Fan Jianxian,” said Elder Wujian.

Jian Wushuang remained smiling. “What’s done is done, it’s useless to regret. Elder Wujian, perhaps the reason you sent me a message is that you’ve been pressured by those other sects and the Great Compassion Sect, am I right?”

Elder Wujian nodded. “Yes. Just a while ago, the Great Compassion Sect and those others came up to us. Even though we had sent them off, Narcissus Island can’t forcibly protect you. After this, the Great Compassion Sect and their lot will find every means to make a move on you in Saint’s Tomb and avenge their disciples. Especially the Great Compassion Sect!”

You have to know a total of 30 Great Compassion Sect disciples have gone into Saint’s Tomb. Among them are nine First-Class Divine Demon, which includes Long Zishan and Yu Aoqing who are both listed in the Twelve Minor Kings. They will definitely join forces to avenge Pang Tao’s death.”

Aside from that, I’m afraid every sect’s disciples in Saint’s Tomb has already caught wind of the three position tokens in your possession by now. Even if they have no enmity against you, they will still seek you out just to snatch those position tokens from you.”

Which means that you have probably become everyone’s target in Saint’s Tomb.”

“Everyone’s target, huh?” Jian Wushuang reacted but without any sense of surprise.

Setting the sects’ grudges aside, it was only natural that he would have become everyone’s target for just having three position tokens in his hands.

“Jian Wushuang, you need to constantly be careful in Saint’s Tomb from here on. We from Narcissus Island can’t help you too much. You can only rely on yourself. If push comes to shove, just give up on those three position tokens. If the situation is worse than that, just use Pang Tao’s Safety Token and protect yourself. Although that would mean missing your chance to access the most precious opportunity in Saint’s Tomb, it’s always better than throwing your life away,” said Elder Wujian.

Jian Wushuang nodded. “Understood. Oh yes, there’s something I would like to ask Elder Wujian for help. It’s about my parents...”

“Uh-huh, you’re right. The tactics that these sects used are sometimes not exactly honorable. If they couldn’t get you out in the open, they might play dirty like making a move on your parents. Don’t worry, I shall send people to relocate your parents just to ensure they’re alright,” said Elder Wujian.

“Well then. Thank you for your efforts, Elder Wujian.” Jian Wushuang was relieved.

He was not worried about his own safety, but of his current lifetime’s parents. As long as his parents were protected, he would feel more settled.

Inside Saint’s Tomb...

All the disciples of Narcissus Island and Ancient Star Temple gathered around.

“How was it, Little Brother?” Zhuo Bing and the rest looked at him.

They knew that Jian Wushuang was communicating with an Elder from Narcissus Island.

“It’s as I predicted. Those sects couldn’t involve Narcissus Island on this issue, but they would do whatever it takes to seek me for revenge. In addition, news of me possessing three position tokens has gone out. For the remaining period, I’ll become the target of all in Saint’s Tomb. My every move will be a difficult one,” said Jian Wushuang.
