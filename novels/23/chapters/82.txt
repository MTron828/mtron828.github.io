The purple-clothed lady quickly finished practicing her swordsmanship, finally placing her sword back into its sheath.

“Mei’er, come here.” Ye Rufeng lightly beckoned her.

The purple-clothed lady immediately ran to Ye Rufeng and said, “Father.”

“Father?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“Brother Swordsman, this is my daughter, Ye Mei. Today she accepted a Two-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard mission in the Gold-Dragon Subsidiary Palace,” Ye Rufeng said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang smiled silently. He immediately understood what Ye Rufeng wanted to request from him.

“Mei’er, this is Swordsman, a brother of mine. Since you insist on doing the mission, I asked Swordsman to accompany you. That way, he can take care of you on the way,” Ye Rufeng said to Ye Mei.

“Him?” Ye Mei looked at Jian Wushuang coldly, and said, “He is just a warrior in the Spiritual Sea Realm. He has not even reached the Primordial Gold Core Realm. It’s not him taking care of me, but me taking care of him!”

An expert of the Gold Core Realm possessed a distinctive aura, so one glance was enough for Ye Mei to know that Jian Wushuang did not have a Gold Core.

“You don’t understand. Brother Swordsman is a disciple of Dragon Palace,” Ye Rufeng replied.

“A disciple of Dragon Palace?” Ye Mei was a little bit shocked and gave Jian Wushuang another glance. But what followed was her sneering again before saying, “So what? Even if he has a lot of talent, he is still only in the Spiritual Sea Realm. If he uses his full strength, he is only the equal of someone in the Initial Gold Core Realm. How is he qualified to take care of me?”

No sooner than the words had been uttered by Ye Mei, she directly left the secret chamber, not even speaking one more word to Jian Wushuang and Ye Rufeng.

“She is…” Ye Rufeng looked a little bit awkward, and then he quickly apologized, ” Sorry brother Swordsman, my daughter was very impolite.”

“It’s ok,” Jian Wushuang shook his head and replied. He was not mad at all.

“Mei’er is such a stubborn and arrogant girl. But, it’s my fault,” Ye Rufeng said, then lightly sighed.

“Her mother died when Mei’er was a child. Being her father and a Golden Dragon Messenger, I spent most of my time dealing with public affairs. Because of that, I failed in taking care of her well. Over the years, she has taken care of herself on her own. I guess that helped create her current personality.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded and then asked, “Ambassador Ye, your purpose in coming was just to help her with the mission?”

“Yes.”

Ye Rufeng continued, “Mei’er is too arrogant. She is anxious to become a Two-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard, but she only achieved the Primordial Gold Core Realm half a month ago. What’s more, the location for the mission is the Innumerable Huge Mountains, which is extremely dangerous on the inside. Considering she could have an accident, I tried to stop her, but she would not listen to me. However, at that time, you arrived.”

Ye Rufeng looked at Jian Wushuang and pleaded, “Brother Swordsman, since you are going to the Innumerable Huge Mountains for the same mission, I want you to do me a favor and with Mei’er, to watch out for her on the way.”

“Okay, no problem.” Jian Wushuang agreed without hesitation.

“Ha-ha, that is great. I am relieved that I can leave her to you,” Ye Rufeng said with a smile.

He knew Jian Wushuang’s strength well. He could easily kill experts in the Initial Gold Core Realm even before he was a disciple of Dragon Palace. Now he had spent time in a Holy Place for cultivators like Dragon Palace for three months, so his strength should be much greater than before.

…

The next day. Outside Moon Heart City.

The eight people who accepted the Two-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard mission had all arrived. Among them, only Jian Wushuang was in the Spiritual Sea Realm. So naturally he stood out from the crowd.

“Why is there a Warrior in the Spiritual Sea Realm here?”

“Who brought him here?”

“Taking a Two-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard mission with someone in the Spiritual Sea Realm. Is this a joke?”

Several eyes that were as sharp as a blade glared at Jian Wushuang. A few of them even shouted at him.

It was common knowledge that Two-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard missions were extremely risky. Even if they were all in the Primordial Gold Core Realm, the mission would still be quite a challenge. Not to mention now, with someone in the Spiritual Sea Realm dragging them down.

“Hey boy, who allowed you to take this task. Get out of here!” a heavily built man with whiskers howled angrily. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Jian Wushuang gave the man a glance and said, “Idiot. Why can’t warriors in the Spiritual Sea Realm accept a Two-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard mission?”

“Boy, what are you talking about?” the whiskered man shouted in rage.

“All right, everybody shut up!” A yell was heard, coming from a black-robed man.

The black-robed man was the only Two-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard among the eight people who were present. He was also the initiator of this mission. While the remaining seven were just One-Clawed Golden Dragon Guards. Among the eight there were obvious disparities in strength. Two had achieved the Profound Gold Core Realm, including the black-robed man. One was a warrior in the Spiritual Sea Realm, which was Jian Wushuang. The other six were all in the Initial Gold Core Realm.

“Boy, no matter how you got the Two-Clawed Gold-Dragon Guard mission, I have to inform you that it’s not a mission that just anyone can easily accomplish. Also, opportunism will not work on this mission,” the black-robed man stared at Jian Wushuang and rumbled.

“In addition, this mission was initiated by me. So I can tell you guys clearly, although you seven accepted the mission simultaneously, only five at most can accomplish the task. That is to say, two of you are doomed to fail this mission.”

“And you will have to rely on your own strength to decide if you can be one of those five who accomplish the task .”

Hearing this, everybody present looked serious, except for Jian Wushuang.

“Did you hear that, boy? Only five can accomplish the task. You are only at the Spiritual Sea Realm. Do you think you can accomplish the mission? How ridiculous!” the heavily built man with whiskers shouted and sneered.

“It’s not something you get to decide!” Jian Wushuang replied, without even giving him a glance.

“Hem, what an arrogant boy. Just wait, you will have your chance to be arrogant once the mission begins,” the whiskery man said coldly.

“If everybody is ready, then let’s go.” No sooner than the black robe man uttered this, the eight warriors left for the Innumerable Huge Mountains.

On the way, the purple-clothed lady, Ye Mei, walked up to Jian Wushuang.

“Didn’t I tell you I don’t need anyone to take care of me?” Ye Mei whispered.

“I owe your father a favor. What’s more, I am also taking this mission, so I just have to watch out for you at my convenience,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“With only your strength? You should give priority to your own safety, since I don’t want you to run to me once you are in danger,” Ye Mei said, then sneered.

“Don’t worry. If I was in danger, then you would have already died long before that,” Jian Wushuang said.

Hearing what Jian Wushuang said, Ye Mei half closed her eyes. Her dislike for Jian Wushuang grew stronger.

“I can not believe that the legendary disciples in Dragon Palace are as arrogant as you.”

Having finished her words, Ye Mei quickened her pace and glided ahead of Jian Wushuang.
