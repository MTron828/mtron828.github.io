2053 Left Three-Emperors World

Demon King Chen Yu and the others left. Jian Wushuang’s danger naturally was resolved.

Then, the four of them plunged out of Three-Emperors World.

In Eternal Chaotic World, in the vast, dark void, the dark millstone that was a few times bigger than a Holy Kingdom in size had already stopped spinning.

In an unnoticeable corner of the dark millstone, there were a few figures that pushed through layers of prohibitions and came out.

“Haha, we’re out!”

“We are finally out!”

Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao looked at the surrounding dark void and they looked overjoyed.

Jian Wushuang was filled with excitement too.

Over the years, they had been wandering in Three-Emperors World. In Three-Emperors World’s land, they had to be cautious and alert at all times. Any careless mistake and they would be doomed forever.

They had finally returned to the Eternal Chaotic World.

As they returned, they were the masters and they could finally relax.

“The Emperor Supreme Rock was destroyed and the dark millstone has been stopped entirely. Our mission was a complete success,” Abysmal Saint Master said in surprise.

“Thanks to Sword Emperor! If it wasn’t him, the few of us might not even have been able to destroy the Emperor Supreme Rock,” Emperor Jiu Qiao smiled.

Jian Wushuang shrugged and let out a breath of relief, “It’s a pity that Zhi Luo won’t be able to walk out of Three-Emperors World with us. Otherwise… Our mission could have been considered perfect.”

Hearing Great Emperor Zhi Luo’s name, Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao became quiet.

Among the four-member expert troop, the three of them had survived but Great Emperor Zhi Luo would forever stay in Three-Emperors World.

“Zhi Luo died for Sanctuary Alliance. Sanctuary Alliance and also the entire Eternal Chaotic World won’t forget about her,” Emperor Bai said.

Jian?Wushuang, Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao nodded.

“This aside, Mister Emperor Bai, how’s the situation at Bronze Heart Region?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Just as we thought, Three-Emperors World has sent experts to wait for your arrival there. Earlier, they fought with our Great Emperors from Sanctuary Alliance, but I sent them a message asking them to return not long after they started fighting. I reckon they will leave Three-Emperors World soon too,” Emperor Bai smiled.

The dark millstone stopped spinning and the great formation collapsed. Hence, the messages could go to and fro in the Eternal Chaotic World and Three-Emperors World without any hindrance. It was unnecessary to rely on Emperor Jiu Qiao’s doppelg?nger to send a message anymore.

“It’s really working as such?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes with a tinge of coldness.

“Jian Wushuang, your plan was wonderful. Not only did you escape from Three-Emperors World, you also verified something for Sanctuary Alliance. That is that our enemy’s spy is among the higher-ups of Sanctuary Alliance,” Emperor Bai said.

“However, although we know that there’s a spy, it is hard to determine who the spy is exactly.” Emperor Bai asked in a deep voice, “Jian Wushuang, Abysmal, Jiu Qiao, who do you think is suspicious?”

Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao exchanged a glance then both shook their heads.

“There is a total of thirteen Great Emperors. There are fourteen, including Jian Wushuang. Putting the four of us aside, for now, there are ten other Great Emperors and the spy is hidden among the ten of them. As long as they didn’t give themselves away, I don’t think it’ll be easy for us to determine,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

“That’s true. At least I won’t be able to gauge who the spy is. As for a suspect, I don’t have anyone in mind either,” Emperor Jiu Qiao said.

Needless to say, among the fourteen Great Emperors, it was impossible for Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai to be spies.

Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao had known of the plan beforehand, while Three-Emperors World fell right into Jian Wushuang’s trap. Hence, the two of them naturally weren’t suspects.

They could eliminate the four of them but there were still ten Great Emperors left.

“Among the ten Great Emperors, Red Dragon, Tian Chen, Zi Xu, Colored Glaze… I feel like none of them are,” Abysmal Saint Master creased his eyebrows. He obviously couldn’t think of anyone suspicious.

But then, Jian Wushuang was in deep thought. Suddenly, he spoke, “Well, I suspect someone.”

“Who?” The three of them immediately looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Great Emperor Zi Xu,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Zi Xu?” Abysmal Saint Master and Emperor Jiu Qiao creased their eyebrows.

Great Emperor Zi Xu was an extremely ancient Great Emperor in Sanctuary Alliance. He never questioned any worldly affairs. Plus, his temperament and reputation was good too.

Could he be a spy?

“Jian Wushuang, tell us your reason,” Emperor Bai said.

“I am not certain that Great Emperor Zi Xu is a spy, but I find him suspicious. I have two reasons. Firstly, Real God Wu Bei’s death!” Jian Wushuang said.

“Wu Bei?” They looked surprised at the answer.

“I know about Real God Wu Bei. Although he is an inverse cultivator, his talent and comprehension level are ordinary,” Abysmal Saint Master said.

“Yes, Real God Wu Bei’s talent and comprehension level are so-so. However, due to the fact that he is an inverse cultivator, if he were to really step foot in the seventh step of inverse cultivation, he would also possess the fighting power of a Great Emperor. He would even stand a chance to become a top Great Emperors, equal to you, Abysmal Saint Master,” Jian Wushuang said.

“However, he only reached the sixth step before he died. The person who killed him was Demon Heart Kingdom Monarch, which is widely known!”

“However, when my power reached a certain level and I went to kill Demon Heart Kingdom Monarch to take revenge on behalf of Real God Wu Bei, Demon Heart Kingdom Monarch said that the reason he killed Real God Wu Bei was that Great Emperor Zi Xu had commanded him to behind his back. Judging from the situation then, I don’t think he was lying.”

The three of them were surprised to hear the story.

Great Emperor Zi Xu had commanded Demon Heart Kingdom Monarch to kill Real God Wu Bei.

From what they knew, Real God Wu Bei had never come across Great Emperor Zi Xu, let alone had dealings with him.

On top of that, even if Real God Wu Bei had really offended Great Emperor Zi Xu, he could totally have killed him directly. There was no need to go through the trouble of getting Demon Heart Kingdom Monarch to kill Real God Wu Bei on his behalf. He had even told Demon Heart Kingdom Monarch to be tight-lipped.

There must be a reason behind it.

“Jian Wushuang, what you mean is that Great Emperor Zi Xu was worried that Real God Wu Bei might step foot onto the seventh step of inverse cultivation and become one of the Great Emperor fighting powers of Sanctuary Alliance. Hence Zi Xu killed him in secret?” Emperor Bai guessed.

“That is the only possibility,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Mm, that’s possible,” Abysmal Saint Master suddenly said, “Mister Emperor Bai, Sword Emperor, speaking of Zi Xu, I do find him strange.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai looked at Abysmal Saint Master.

“Sword Emperor, you know this best. Back when you had yet to step foot in the seventh step of inverse cultivation, there were some Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance, including myself, that didn’t wish to see you grow. I even found ways to kill you then,” Abysmal Saint Master took a glance at Jian Wushuang solemnly.
