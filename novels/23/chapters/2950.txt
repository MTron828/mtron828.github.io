Chapter 2951: Looking Down on Me?

——

“Haha, three Shadow Saints, allow me to meet you.”

Maniacal laughter reverberated in the air.

A terrifying aura erupted from Xue Dong King’s body, and he dashed out, a long green saber appearing in his hand.

Following the sound of rushing wind, the long green saber slashed out like a bolt of green lightning with mighty momentum.

“Attack together and kill him!” The leader of the three Shadow Saints, the cold old man, shouted.

Instantly, three auras at the level of Immortal Saints rose up.

None of these three auras could compare to Xue Dong King, but at this moment, the three of them were working together.

Moreover, the three Shadow Saints had lived together for a long time, fighting and fighting together. Their cooperation had reached an extremely tacit level. When they worked together, they were not afraid of any top False Saint.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

A low sound of collision and explosion was heard in the void.

Each time they collided, a violent wave of air swept out crazily in the surroundings.

Jian Wushuang stood at the edge and looked at the battlefield in front of him. He had no intention of attacking.

“As I expected, Xue Dong King had hidden a lot of his strength when he fought with me. His real combat strength is definitely the strongest among the top False Saints. He is infinitely close to an ordinary True Saint. However, the strength of the three Shadow Saints is not weak. If the three of them were to split up, their combat strength would only be at the level of an ordinary Immortal Saint. However, with the three of them working together, they can fight head-on with Xue Dong King.” Jian Wushuang praised.

He could clearly see that on the battlefield, the Xue Dong King and the three Shadow Saints had already used all their strength, but the two sides were evenly matched.

In terms of advantage, the Xue Dong King barely had an advantage, but this advantage was negligible. Moreover, the three Shadow Saints seemed to have a trump card that they had yet to use.

“Haha, Xue Dong King, I admit that your strength is tyrannical. In the many surrounding domains, other than that Lord who has already reached the True Saint-level, I’m afraid that no one is your match. Unfortunately, your strength is only about the same as the three of us brothers. Do you want to kill us? You’re simply dreaming.” The gloomy and cold old man laughed loudly.

Xue Dong King’s face darkened, but he also shook his head and felt helpless.

“Indeed, I can’t do anything to you three alone, but I’m not the only one here.” Xue Dong King grinned and looked at Jian Wushuang. “Brothers of the Heavenly Marquis, let’s kill them together.”

The three shadows immediately looked at Jian Wushuang with disdain in their eyes.

From the beginning to the end, they did not take Jian Wushuang, a Divine Master, seriously.

However, Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and thought to himself. “These three brothers are not weak. If I fight them head-on, I’ll have to spend some means to kill them. In that case… I won’t waste time with them. I’ll just kill them one by one!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a sharp light. He instantly turned into a stream of light and shot out. The Blood Mountain Sword had already appeared in his hand.

“A mere Divine Master dares to participate in a fierce battle at the level of the Immortal Saint. He’s courting death!” A trace of contempt flashed through the bald youth who ranked third. With a wave of his hand, a majestic divine power gathered in front of him and formed a huge fist that attacked Jian Wushuang.

“Oh, are you looking down on me?”

Jian Wushuang curled his lips slightly. He did not even bother to wave his sword as he looked at the incoming fist. With just a thought, an invisible sword shadow instantly condensed in front of him and then burst out. The sword shadow crushed the fist that had gathered divine power, it directly tore the fist into pieces.

Jian Wushuang’s figure was not hindered at all. He had already appeared in front of the bald young man.

“Third brother, be careful!”

“Dodge!”

The cold Elder and the black-haired skinny man were shocked because they had already seen a beautiful sword light.

The sword light was so beautiful that it was intoxicating.

It was incredibly fast.

“What?”

The bald young man widened his eyes and looked at the beautiful sword light coming toward him, but he could not react at all.

“Chi!”

The beautiful sword light brushed past the bald young man’s neck, and the bald young man’s entire head flew out.

“The first one.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and appeared next to the black-haired skinny man.

“Whoosh!”

It was also an extremely beautiful sword attack, but it directly created a huge sword net. The sword net was like a ferocious beast that opened its bloody mouth, wanting to swallow the black-haired skinny man completely.

“Second brother, run!” The cold old man not far away shouted.

The black-haired skinny man had already reacted.

If the three of them worked together, their battle strength would indeed be tyrannical. Unless they met a True Saint, they would not have any scruples.

But if the three of them were to be disintegrated and killed one by one, they would only have the battle strength of an ordinary Immortal Saint.

Now that the bald youth had been killed on the spot, the three-man alliance had been broken, leaving only the two of them to escape.

“Run!!” The black-haired skinny man instantly burst out his fastest speed, wanting to escape the sword net before it completely covered him.

However, at this time, Jian Wushuang suddenly raised one of his palms and pointed in his direction.

The power of the space-time rule immediately burst out.

The space-time where the black-haired skinny man was was immediately frozen.

It was so heavy that it was almost negligible. However, in such a short time, the sword net had completely enveloped the black-haired skinny man and a large number of sword lights attacked him, the black-haired skinny man did not even have time to scream before his divine body was crushed into pieces.

“No!”

Seeing this scene, the cold Elder’s eyes became bloodshot and crazy.

It was too fast. Jian Wushuang was too fast.

At first, none of the three brothers thought much of Jian Wushuang as a Divine Master. However, Jian Wushuang killed the third brother, the bald youth, in an instant, and then the second brother with a thunderbolt, that was the black-haired skinny man.

The cold-faced Elder saw everything, but he could not help them in time. He could only watch as his two brothers were mercilessly killed by Jian Wushuang.

“Your two brothers are already dead. Now, it’s your turn.” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly.
