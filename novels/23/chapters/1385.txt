Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Jian Wushuang, I will send your examination result to the higher ups. Wait for a while here,” Feng Tao said.

“Alright,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Feng Tao and Huo Yi walked towards the huge, palatial buildings in the depth of Soul Island while Jian Wushuang stood there waiting.

In the lofty palace, there were three figures seated on three thrones.

The three figures had a thick aura and they were obviously experts at the Real God level.

Right in the middle of the palace, there was a mirror and it was, of course, showing the process of Jian Wushuang sitting for the examination.

“Dark purple brilliance. His consciousness strength has reached a Peak three-starred. There’s no doubt about it!”

“Black tortoise? The defense power of the black tortoise is terrifying. The demonic dragon too! This is crazy. Even Feng Tao’s green giant was defeated so easily.”

“Mm, his usage of consciousness is not too shabby.”

Only a short while passed before the three Real Gods made a decision.

“Go ahead and pass him this arm-band. From today onwards, he is one of the members of Soul Master Hall.” One of the Real God threw an arm-band to Feng Tao.

Feng Tao took it and there was a flash of strange look.

Then, Feng Tao and Huo Yi immediately left.

“Jian Wushuang, congratulations.”

Feng Tao and Huo Yi appeared before Jian Wushuang again. Then, Feng Tao passed the arm-band to Jian Wushuang.

“This is… Peak three-starred Soul Master?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Your consciousness strength has reached the level of a Peak three-starred. Of course, you’ll be a Peak three-starred Soul Master,” Feng Tao smiled and revealed an envious expression, “Although there were many Soul Masters on Soul Island, there aren’t many who have reached the level Peak three-starred.”

Jian Wushuang kept quiet but he didn’t really care.

“Oh yeah, is it common for Soul Masters to fight against each other to learn from one another on Soul Island?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course, and it is rather common,” Feng Tao smiled, “Why? You want to fight against someone?”

“I have been practicing in the mountains to improve my consciousness strength but I have never once fought against someone. Now that I have the chance, of course, I’d like to learn from the other Soul Masters,” Jian Wushuang smiled and replied.

“That is simple. There’s a designated battleground on Soul Island. There are many Soul Masters that fight against each other there. Let me take you there.”

Feng Tao immediately brought Jian Wushuang to the battleground.

…

Soul Island, in a lofty palace.

Bang!

The door of a secret room suddenly opened and a vicious youth who was naked from the waist up and barefooted walked out of the secret room slowly.

There were servants who waited outside the secret room moved forward to help the vicious youth with his robe.

“The seclusion this time took a thousand and eight hundred years. It’s been so long,” the vicious youth smiled maliciously, “However, although the time taken was longer, I finally performed that technique. If mother were to know, she should be very happy.

“Master, you’re dressed,” the servant next to her spoke softly.

The vicious youth looked at his robe and then walked out from his palace.

“I have not stretched for a thousand and eight hundred years. Let’s go take a look at the battleground first.”

The vicious youth walked towards the battleground in Soul Island directly.

Soon, the vicious youth arrived at the battleground. He had just appeared and there were many Soul Masters that noticed him in the battleground. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Mister Bei Xiu!”

“Greetings, Mister Bei Xiu!”

Many Soul Masters, including some three-starred Soul Masters, bowed humbly at the vicious youth.

Even the two Real Gods nearby looked at the vicious youth with good intentions.

The vicious youth, Bei Xiu, had became the focus of the place quietly. However, he only glanced at everyone around him casually and came to sit down in an inconspicuous place. His gaze was fixed on the battleground below.

On the battleground, there were four of them fighting. It was three versus one.

“Oh? Black Tortoise?”

Bei Xiu looked towards the youth in the crimson robe who was covered by the huge black tortoise.

The youth in the crimson robe was wearing an arm-band of a Peak three-starred Soul Master and his aura was fierce. The people around him were three beginner three-starred Soul Masters. At that very moment, the three of them were hemming him in with their all. They performed all kinds of consciousness attacks. Such as a huge saber derived from consciousness, a huge cobra and also a single-eyed giant.

The black tortoise around the youth in the crimson robe didn’t move an inch but let the consciousness attack hit him. He wasn’t affected at all.

“Not too shabby,” Bei Xiu looked at the sight before him.

“Master Bei Xiu, this person is called Jian Wushuang. He just arrived at Soul Island yesterday. The moment he arrived, he chose to come to the battleground to fight. For days, he continuously fought ten over battles. He wasn’t defeated even once yet. Not long ago, even Master Jin Ang fought against him personally, but he didn’t defeat him,” a purple-dressed elderly who was next to Bei Xiu said.

“Jin Ang took action but he didn’t defeat him?” Bei Xiu raised his eyebrows.

Jin Ang was a Peak three-starred Soul Master who was powerful. His power was about his level.

“Mainly because this boy’s defense power was extremely strong. The black tortoise that he formed using his consciousness was unassailable. Although Master Jin Ang is much stronger than him in terms of attack, it was very difficult for him to break the black tortoise’s defense. Then, the battle was left unsettled,” the purple-dressed elderly said.

“It turned out that he relied on the shell,” Bei Xiu then loosened his tightly knitted eyebrows.

At that very moment, Jian Wushuang stopped defending and took action directly in the battleground below.

“Crane cry!”

A huge crimson phoenix flapped its wing and swept out.

A terrifying aura formed a blast that spread across.

“Crimson Phoenix?” Bei Xiu lifted his eyebrows but remained unconcerned.

However, after the crimson phoenix, there was another roar. Jian Wushuang used his Soul Power and transformed them into a few purple tigers.

“Purple tigers?” Bei Xiu squinted his eyes.

If it was merely Black Tortoise and Crimson Phoenix, he wouldn’t care. But then, the appearance of purple tiger shocked him.

Then, it was followed by… Roar!

There were three Demonic dragons with murderous intentions that appeared on the battleground.

“Demonic Dragon!!!”

The vicious youth, Bei Xiu, who was watching by the side of the battleground, suddenly stood up and he looked extremely surprised.

“Black Tortoise, Crimson Phoenix, Purple Tiger, Demonic Dragon!”

“There’s one left. The last one left. The very last one should be Divine Ape!!”

There was an unprecedented brightness in Bei Xiu’s eyes. He fixed his gaze on Jian Wushuang on the battleground. He was looking forward to Jian Wushuang performing Divine Ape.

It was a pity that even though the battle was extremely ferocious, he would never see Jian Wushuang perform Divine Ape.

“Unless it was because he wasn’t powerful enough that he couldn’t perform Divine Ape?”

“That must be it!”

“Black Tortoise, Crimson Phoenix, Purple Tiger, Demonic Dragon. The four beasts are out and the method is rather similar. Even if it were to be a coincidence, it shouldn’t be that similar!”

“Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack… Mother talked about it before. She once saw the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack in the boundless universe!”
