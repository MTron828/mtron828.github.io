Chapter 2488: The Lord Pays a Visit

The Lord of Great Compassion Sect, the true leader of the Great Compassion Sect.

The three Supreme Elders, Lei Chong, An Junzhu, and Fan Jianxian also held extremely high status in the Great Compassion Sect. However, the true and sovereign leader of the Great Compassion Sect was ultimately the Lord. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He was also recognized as the strongest expert in the Wusha Wilderness, a genuine High-Level Ultimate God!

The Lord had spent many years in retreat such that most daily management of the Great Compassion Sect was handed over to the three Supreme Elders.

The Lord had finally returned from his retreat.

It happened right after the three Supreme Elders of Great Compassion Sect were defeated head-on by Jian Wushuang. The true reason for the Lord’s return was clear.

On the second day of his return, he and the three Ultimate Gods left Great Compassion Sect and headed towards Anjiu Commandery.

News traveled and caused an uproar in Wusha Wilderness.

...

In Anjiu Commandery, hidden in an underground dark palace.

Several figures headed by Governor Bai Yue, stood waiting respectfully.

Behind Bai Yue were patriarchs of the six top families in Anjiu Commandery. Some of which Jian Wushuang knew such as Lin Tiefeng—head of the Lin family, Zhuge Yuanchong—head of the Zhuge family, and Xiang Zong—head of Xiang family. Those people including Bai Yue were all waiting for someone. They stood there patiently waiting with none dared to complain of any dissatisfactions they may have.

After a long period of time, a bright light lit up at the palace’s center and a spatial wormhole slowly came into sight.

“They are here.” Bai Yue’s expression became more alert and respectful than before.

The light gradually dimmed and four figures stepped out of the spatial wormhole.

Among those four people was a handsome middle-aged man who was dressed in a loose long robe, apart from Lei Chong, An Junzhu, and Fan Jianxian.

This middle-aged man had stubbles on his chin and was giving off the impression of someone with a warm personality.

“I’m Anjiu’s governor, Bai Yue. It’s my pleasure to meet all of you.” Bai Yue and the six family heads behind him immediately bowed and saluted.

“Are you the Governor?” The handsome middle-aged man glanced at Bai Yue.

Bai Yue shuddered under his gaze as if he was fully exposed.

“Lead me to Jian Wushuang,” said the handsome middle-aged man casually.

“Yes, please follow me.” Bai Yue immediately led the way.

The six top family heads were grim and proper.

They knew the identities of those four people very well.

Anyone of those four people could easily wipe out the six top families and even the entire Anjiu Commandery with just a wave of their hand!

Under the guidance of Bai Yue, it took them some time before arriving at the Blazing Moon City where Jian Wushuang was.

“My lord, this is Blazing Moon City. Jian Wushuang’s father is the city’s governor. Jian Wushuang is currently staying in Blazing Moon City,” Bai Yue reported.

The handsome middle-aged man nodded slightly, but his eyes were examining the surrounding void.

“Haha, quite a few people are here.” The handsome looking middle-aged man faintly laughed, but his voice could be heard throughout the void.

Behind the handsome middle-aged man, those three Ultimate Gods including Lei Chong looked extremely cold.

As an Ultimate God, his perception abilities were extremely sensitive and he naturally felt the presence of those people hiding in the void.

Most of those people were spies from various sects. Some of which were the sects’ experts and even a few sect lords were among them.

“Oh, that person’s here too?” The handsome middle-aged man was surprised.

As far as his soul power could reach, he could see an elegant green-robed man standing in the void not far away. Behind the elegant green-robed man were Narcissus Island’s elders such as Elder Linghe and Elder Wujian. The elegant green-robed man was no other than the remarkable Ling Gong, Lord of Narcissus Island!

“Jian Wushuang was from Narcissus Island, what a pity...” The handsome middle-aged man secretly shook his head.

“My Lord, Jian Wushuang is in the Governor’s Mansion. I’ll bring him out now,” said Bai Yue.

“No need.” The handsome middle-aged man waved his hand and turned serious.

“Yun Zhen from the Great Compassion Sect is here to visit my friend, Jian Wushuang.” A magnificent voice came from the handsome middle-aged man which echoed throughout the entire Blazing Moon City.

Anyone who was at any corner of Blazing Moon City could clearly hear the voice.

In the Governor’s Mansion, Jian Wushuang’s family had gathered together. Jian Wushuang was holding a cup of tea in his hands.

When the handsome middle-aged man’s voice echoed throughout Blazing Moon City, Jian Wushuang’s eyes focused as he put down the teacup.

“Little Brother, Yun Zhen is...” Zhuo Bing frowned and looked over.

“If I’m not mistaken, he should be Lord of Great Compassion Sect.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly.

Earlier, he received a message from Wujian about the Lord of Great Compassionate Sect had come out from his retreat and was heading over to meet Jian Wushuang.

“The Lord of Great Compassion Sect?” Zhuo Bing, Zhuo Peng, and Zhuo Yunfeng were taken aback.

The Great Compassion Sect was the recognized top sect in Wusha Wilderness.

It was not hard to imagine the status Lord of Great Compassion Sect had.

“Shuang’er.” Luo Xinqin looked at Jian Wushuang worriedly.

“He’s just a High-Level Ultimate God, it’s no big deal. Father and Mother, just wait here for a while. I’ll be back. Big Sister, Second Brother, please stay by Father and Mother’s side,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Sure.” Zhuo Bing and Zhuo Peng both nodded their heads. They knew they were unable to help Jian Wushuang at all.

After Jian Wushuang made the arrangements, he departed towards the void above Blazing Moon City.

Two apparitions flashed past, and Jian Wushuang soon appeared before the Great Compassion Sect Lord in the blink of an eye.

Jian Wushuang studied the handsome middle-aged man.

‘Is he the Lord of Great Compassion Sect?’ Jian Wushuang stared at the handsome middle-aged man while his eyes rolled around in deep thoughts.

In any case, he could see the other party was a High-Level Ultimate God, which is incomparable to ordinary Ultimate Gods like Lei Chong and Fan Jianxian.

“Are you Jian Wushuang?” That handsome middle-aged man also stared at Jian Wushuang. His eyes were flashing with a strange luster as he attempted to read Jian Wushuang’s expression but unfortunately failed.

Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently. “Yes, I am. Is Lord Yun Zhen here to give me an explanation?”

“The Great Compassion Sect is the recognized top sect in Wusha Wilderness. If you want us to give you an explanation, you must first prove your strength. It’s useless even though you have previously defeated the three Supreme Elders,” said Yun Zhen solemnly.

“I wonder how Lord Yun Zhen wants me to prove myself?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“It’s very simple.” Yun Zhen raised his hand and stretched out three fingers, “Just accept three of my palm strikes.”
