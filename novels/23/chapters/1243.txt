Chapter 1244: Nirvana!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

At the center of the battlefield, the monarch of the Jin Kingdom threw the longspear out of his hand, and his whole Divine Power suddenly burst forth.

“Unique skill! Immortality God,” he shouted.

Roar!

With a sudden violent roar, a massive Thunderbolt gathered on the fierce golden spear. In an instant, it formed an enormous golden Thunderbolt Exotic Beast.

This golden Thunderbolt Exotic Beast was more than tens of thousands of miles in size. Its whole body was covered with golden Thunderbolt. Once it was formed, it opened its bloody mouth and rushed directly at Jian Wushuang. Its horrible power would terrify the entire universe.

Everyone around the battlefield was also horrified to see the golden Thunderbolt Exotic Beast that appeared out of nowhere.

“Immortality God!”

This was the strongest move that the monarch had performed in this battle!

“Universe God! Unique skill!”

When Gu King saw this, he was shocked.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and then turned back to look over toward the experts of the Green Fire World.

“Five million years!” Jian Wushuang murmured.

“It’s been five million years of fights, and our Green Fire World has lost too many experts!”

“The grievances between the Green Fire World and the Jin Kingdom must be settled today!”

Then Jian Wushuang looked at the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

The power of the Blood Mountain Sword surged. And the Sword trembled with skyrocketing Sword Essence.

“The next sword attack…It is not for the sake of revenge for the many experts who died in the past five million years. It is not for letting out the endless anger of our Green Fire World. It is for the future of our Green Fire World and for our future generations!” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

“It is to completely end this war, to let my green fire be reborn, and to usher in a new era!”

“The name of the next sword attack is…Nirvana!”

Jian Wushuang spoke very slowly so that everyone in the place could hear it clearly.

At this moment, his vast force had been integrated into the Blood Mountain Sword. The three strongest Sword Principles combined. Jian Wushuang’s understanding of the Sword Principles had also increased to the highest point. An intoxicating sword light suddenly appeared on the Blood Mountain Sword and became more and more resplendent.

“Go.”

Jian Wushuang talked to the sword light, which then suddenly burst out.

Since the Stroke of Dawn, the second unique skill created by Jian Wushuang, Nirvana, had also come to the world!

The Stroke of Dawn was created by him when he had opened up the two strongest Sword Principles.

Now he had opened up all three strongest Sword Principles and integrated them. When he was fighting fiercely in the decisive battle, he had a lot of deep understandings of the Sword Principles. With all of these prerequisites, he created the second unique skill, Nirvana.

Jian Wushuang created this move in order to create a new era for the Green Fire World.

It represented the future of the Green Fire World! It was also the hope of the Green Fire World!

At the moment when the sword light was plucked, everyone could not help but be attracted to it.

While the huge golden Thunderbolt Exotic Beast was rushing in, the sword light went directly into its bloody mouth.

The two collided.

Buzz!

There was no violent crashing sound as expected, but only the slight sound of tremors.

However, the next moment the vast world began to tremble wildly.

The earth below…

The land that had been stained with blood was crushed immediately; dust and gravel were crushed into powder.

A huge sinkhole, hundreds of thousands of miles wide and more than three hundred meters deep, appeared in the ground.

At the same time, the collision also formed a Blast Wave, sweeping out in all directions.

The experts in the two camps at the perimeter of the battlefield were swept by the Blast Wave for the first time.

Puff! Puff! Puff!

There were sounds of vomiting blood one after another. The experts were all hit by the impact. The remaining Dao Masters of the Green Fire World were all blown away.

“Go hide behind the Battle Fortress!”

The Tang Emperor immediately issued an order.

The Dao Masters of the Green Fire World hurriedly fled to the Battle Fortress.

In the middle of the battlefield, the two powers were still squeezing and slamming onto each other. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

But the stalemate had only lasted for a moment. And then the sword light became more brilliant.

Walla…The golden Exotic Beast’s bloody mouth was immediately cut open by the Thunderbolt, and then the Beast disappeared.

“What?”

The monarch of the Jin Kingdom was shocked.

His strongest move was completely crushed by Jian Wushuang!

Om!

After defeating the golden Exotic Beast, the brilliant sword light appeared in front of the monarch.

The monarch had no time to resist.

Boom!

The sword light carried an endless power and hit the monarch in his chest. The defense skill of the monarch was immediately crushed, and then his chest exploded.

Woosh!

The monarch transformed into a golden Flowing Light and stumbled tens of thousands of miles backward before he could regain his stance.

After he stopped, the people around the battlefield immediately looked over. And then everyone was horrified.

The experts of the Jin Kingdom could not even believe their eyes.

The golden robe of the monarch was ruined and stained with blood, and his hair was disheveled.

The most striking thing was the bowl-size hole of blood in the chest of the monarch.

This blood hole nearly penetrated the monarch’s chest completely.

How miserable it was!

“How, how can this be?”

“The monarch actually lost?”

“The invincible monarch has lost to a Universe Master of the Green Fire World?”

“How is this possible!!!”

There were terrible screams from the camp of the Jin Kingdom.

The Universe Masters of the Jin Kingdom could not believe what they had seen.

The monarch of the Jin Kingdom was a Universe God.

He was a genuine expert even in the Eternal Chaotic World. How could he lose to a Universe Master?

They really could not accept this fact.

Contrary to the Jin Kingdom, the Green Fire World rejoiced.

“Victory!”

“His Highness has defeated the monarch of the Jin Kingdom!!”

“Kill him, Palace Master Wushuang. Kill him!”

The voices full of killing intent rang through the sky. Everyone in the Green Fire World looked at the monarch of the Jin Kingdom. Their eyes were filled with endless resentment!
