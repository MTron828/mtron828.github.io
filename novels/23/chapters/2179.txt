Chapter 2180 Emperor Bai and the Blood Emperor

Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang stood side by side in the middle of the battlefield.The Blood Emperor stood not far away, arms crossed.

There was a trace of surprise on his ferocious face. “I had completely destroyed his Holy Body, but he recovered all the same. Interesting, this Inverse Cultivation of yours.”

Emperor Bai and Jian Wushuang had their serious faces on.

It was no understatement to call them immortal after having obtained the Perfect Chaotic Holy Body via the seventh Inverse Cultivation step. Under normal circumstances, Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai would never have exposed their powers, but now their hands had been forced.

“Jian Wushuang, this is not a battle you can win. Step to one side,” Emperor Bai said.

Jian Wushuang flinched, but he could do nothing.

It was true, Blood Emperor was too strong for him.

If not for his Perfect Chaotic Holy Body, he would have died.

“Emperor Bai, can you face him alone?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I don’t know, but I have to try,” Emperor Bai replied solemnly.

Jian Wushuang frowned but said no more, and retreated to the nearby Void.

“So, you intend to fight me alone? You? Are you even worthy of fighting against me?” Blood Emperor laughed.

Emperor Bai said nothing, but the golden armour on him shined more brilliantly than normal. At the same time, a unique power swept out of his body, covering him.

The power was Star Power!

Emperor Bai had practised Secret Skills of Star Palace as well.

The Secret Skills of Star Palace is one of his strongest trump cards, and he intended to use it directly.

“Hngh!” A sneer was made, and Emperor Bai made his move once again with the help of Star Power.

The gigantic golden shadow behind him started glowing – a large fist was raised, instantly becoming a golden sun.

The golden sun was dazzling, glaring.

Everyone’s gaze could not help but be attracted by it.

Blood Emperor looked up as well and squinted slightly.

“Seven Star Black Sect? Secret Skill of Seven Star?”

“Haha, it is a good secret skill. But you lack the ability. You will only multiply your powers by reading the first script, what would that do to me?” Blood Emperor had a hint of contempt in his words.

He gave a direct slam.

The slam was followed by an ancient bell resonating around.

A gigantic crimson Divine Demon appeared out of thin air, different to his consciousness embodiment. The Divine Demon had completely formed, and destructive aura way beyond Chaotic Realm levels could be easily felt.

The huge palm smacked.

It smacked against the golden sun.

Peng!

With a loud bang, everything fell quiet.

Endless power stirred the heavens and earth, forming a storm of Divine Power like never seen before.

The storm swept everything around it. Jian Wushuang and the other Eternal Chaotic World experts had retreated far from the battlefield, yet the storm was so strong that they could barely open their eyes.

At the core of the storm of Divine Power.

Emperor Bai’s face was awfully white. Once again, he held onto brutal power in his hands.

Instantly, another giant golden sun was formed.

Punch after punch formed golden suns, bombarding the enemy like mad, each punch enough to destroy a Great Emperor.

Yet Blood Emperor was still not taking it seriously. Now, he used both palms.

Each of his palms, like enormous crimson mountains, blocked the golden suns entirely.

Within a breath, Emperor Bai and Blood Emperor collided about ten times.

Xiu! Xiu! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Emperor Bai burst back into retreat, whereas Blood Emperor took a step back as well.

“You made me move?” Blood Emperor looked at Emperor Bai once again and smiled coldly.

“Guess I need to take you a bit more seriously.”

Saying that he flipped his palm, and a demonic crimson spear appeared in his hands.

The spear exluded terror itself.

The density of its aura was stronger than any divine weapon Jian Wushuang had ever come across.

Without a doubt, the spear meant death!

The Blood Emperor had never used a divine weapon, even as his consciousness embodiment.

Now, he took out his crimson spear.

“Come, Emperor Bai, let’s try this again.” Blood Emperor smiled faintly and threw out his spear at lightning-speeds towards Emperor Bai.

It looked normal, the spear.

But the moment he thrust out, a large crimson vortex appeared out of nowhere, swallowing everything in its path. Even a good Great Emperor would be devoured in an instant against such a vortex.

Emperor Bai used both of his hands.

Wong!

Another large golden sun appeared out of thin air once again.

Regardless of size or presence, the golden sun was much stronger than ever before.

The collision between the golden sun and the crimson blade was not as dramatic as expected. Only the sounds of dense forces being pushed around.

Emperor Bai’s face suddenly darkened. A terrifying force passed through his arm, causing him to retreat.

“Haha!” The Blood Emperor was not affected at all and went straight for Emperor Bai. His crimson spear did not stop.

Each thrust was fast beyond imagination.

No one around could catch up with that speed.

The crimson spears kept coming. It was hard for Emperor Bai to defend while retreating, a complete mess.

Not long after, his body was stabbed several times.

Though the holes were soon repaired, Emperor Bai was indeed being suppressed.

“After the Secret Skills of Star Palace, increasing his powers tenfold, Emperor Bai is still being suppressed?” Jian Wushuang and the other Eternal Chaotic World experts were in dismay.
