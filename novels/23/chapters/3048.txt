Chapter 3049: Exhortation

——

“Of course there are.”

Xue Bei said with absolute certainty, “I don’t know about other powerful warriors, but what I know can make the will of Heavenly Dao retreat. There are three people that I don’t dare to offend. These three people are the founder of the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect, the Divine Ancestor, the Temple Master of the Temporal Temple, and the mysterious Alliance Master in the legends of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance!”

“These three people have already reached an astonishing level of strength. They don’t even need to fight. They just stand there and form their own world, which is not something the will of the Heavenly Dao can touch. As long as they are in their place, the power of the will of the Heavenly Dao will not exist.”

“So powerful?” Jian Wushuang was shocked, but at the same time, he immediately thought of his master, Xuan Yi.

Xuan Yi was the first perfect chaotic creature in the world.

His strength was also shocking. Jian Wushuang had been lucky enough to see a scene in which the power of the will of heaven could not do anything to Xuan Yi, and could only retreat, he wondered who was stronger, the founder of the Divine Ancestor Daoist sect, the Temple Master of the Spacetime Temple, and the Alliance Master of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance compared to his master, Xuan Yi.

“By the way, Senior Xue Bei, you just said that the rulers of the three Freedom Alliances are supreme in the third heaven. Shouldn’t the three masters of the Saint Realm make the will of heaven retreat?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Masters of the Saint Realm?” Xue Bei shook his head. “I don’t know if the three masters of the Saint Realm can make the will of heaven retreat, but I do know that they are not as powerful as they seem.”

“What do you mean?” Jian Wushuang looked at him.

“I don’t know the details. After all, I’m not qualified to be in contact with some secrets of that level. But I heard from the leader of the Blood Ancestor’s Bloodline that the three masters of the Saint Realm were just lucky and favored by the Heavenly Dao. If they were not favored by the Heavenly Dao, they would not be as strong as him,” Xue Bei said.

“He’s just lucky and favored by the Heavenly Dao?” Jian Wushuang was stunned. “From the leader of the Blood Ancestor’s Bloodline, it seems that he looks down on the three masters of the Saint Realm?”

“I guess so, but so be it. Although the three masters of the Saint Realm are no match for the Blood Ancestor, they wouldn’t be able to kill him alone. Moreover, the Blood Ancestor is the leader of one of the great sects of the Divine Ancestor Daoist sect and the founder of the Divine Ancestor Daoist sect. The three masters of the Saint Realm don’t have the courage to deal with the Blood Ancestor,” Xue Bei said.

“In other words, the founder of the Divine Ancestor Daoist sect is stronger than the three masters of the Saint Realm?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“That’s for sure.” Xue Bei nodded. “I’ve heard that any one of the three masters of the Saint Realm has to be respectful to the founder of the Divine Ancestor Daoist sect.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help but sigh in his heart.

He had always thought that the most terrifying people in this world were the three masters of the Saint Realm in the third heaven, but now it seemed that this was not the case.

The founder of the Divine Ancestor Daoist sect, the Temple Master of the Temporal Temple, and the mysterious Alliance Master of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance might all be stronger than the Three Great Saint Realm Masters.

“Little Fellow, you were just about to ask how many enemies you have in this world. I can tell you now that since it is an anomaly of the Heavenly Dao, other than being careful of the power of the will of the Heavenly Dao, you only need to be careful of the Three Great Saint Realm Masters and the forces under them. As for the other forces, you don’t need to care about them. For example, the three great Freedom Alliances are not on the same side as the will of the Heavenly Dao, especially the Heaven-cleaving Alliance!”

Xue Bei’s expression became serious, “The Heaven-cleaving Alliance is the strongest force among the three Freedom Alliances and has the deepest foundation. Just from its name alone, you can see that the Heaven-cleaving Alliance has always been in a state of hostility with the Heavenly Dao will. The experts under the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and the Three Saint Realm Masters often have all sorts of fights and even fights. This has long been known by everyone.”

“As you said, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance has invited you twice. If you want to cultivate in the three palaces, you don’t have to worry about it. You can just agree to it directly. When you get to the three palaces, the fact that you are an extraordinary figure may not be exposed. Even if it is exposed and the Three Masters of the Saint Realm know about it, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance will do its best to protect you.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

According to what Xue Bei said, his previous concerns were unnecessary.

However, he was just being cautious. Now that he knew that the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and the will of Heavenly Dao were enemies, he did not need to worry about the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

“Little guy, I have answered your question. In addition, I have another word for you.” Xue Bei’s voice was solemn, “You have great talent and great potential. Your achievements in the future should be limitless. But you must remember that no matter what level you reach in the future, you must always remain in awe of this world. That is to say, the heart of awe!”

“Heart of awe?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

“This world is too big and vast. You can’t imagine how vast it is. Even what I know is just a drop in the ocean. Take the will of heaven as an example. For ordinary cultivators, the will of heaven is superior and can not be challenged. However, for those who stand at the top of the Divine Beginning World, such as the founder of the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect and the Temple Master of the Spacetime Temple, the will of heaven is nothing.

“However, even super existences like the founder of the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect, the Temple Master of the Spacetime Temple, and the Alliance Master of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance still have something they need to fear in this world. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“In short, there is always someone better than you. No matter what, you should always be in awe. For example, I was too careless and underestimated this world. That’s why I ended up dead. I hope you won’t follow in my footsteps in the future,” Xue Bei said.

“I will definitely remember senior’s teachings,” Jian Wushuang nodded solemnly.

Jian Wushuang also deeply remembered Xue Bei’s advice.

In fact, even if Xue Bei did not mention it, Jian Wushuang’s awe of this world had never disappeared. Moreover, the higher his strength increased, the greater the awe.

Now, through his conversation with Xue Bei, he had a deeper understanding of this world. Jian Wushuang’s awe of this world had reached an unprecedented level.

Of course, what he feared was this world, but not the will of the Heavenly Dao. The two were not the same thing.
