4812 Comprehending the Liu Ya Heavenly Emperor Runes

He had decided that Cheng Qing would stay in the Six Heavens Realm.

As Chun Qiu and Cui Jing had eaten quite a number of supreme grade pills sealed by Emperor Liu Ya along the way, they had advanced to different degrees. It was only a matter of time before they became Yan Immortals, so the two of them were left to guard.

Jian Wushuang only decided to bring Di Qing along with him on this trip to the Great Mi Heaven controlled by Prince Jiu.

After making his decision, he went to the square outside the hall to recuperate and recover.

Chen Qing and the others also went into meditation to regulate their breathing. Ever since the destruction of the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture, they had suffered extremely serious injuries, so much so that they had not fully recovered their strength even after returning to the Six Heavens Realm.

If Jian Wushuang had not obtained Emperor Liu Ya’s comprehension inheritance, his power would definitely not have recovered to its peak.

Although he said that he was recuperating and recovering, he was actually starting to examine the Liu Ya Heavenly Emperor Runes that was sealed in his body and in his divine sense.

Di Qing followed him closely, the desire in his eyes almost overflowing.

Jian Wushuang shook his head helplessly. He did not care about Di Qing and started to investigate the Liu Ya Heavenly Emperor Runes.

Di Qing also became nervous and concentrated, even more nervous than him.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang, who had looked like an old monk meditating, suddenly said slowly, “What is your relationship with Prince Mo?”

“Ah.” Di Qing was stunned for a moment, and then he responded after a moment of contemplation.

“Actually, we can be considered to have some kind of beneficial relationship, but we are far from being friends. After all, we are both taking what we need.”

At this point, Di Qing touched his nose awkwardly. “He wants my protection, and I just want some of his Imperial Father’s fate energy.”

“Prince Mo’s Imperial Father? Why do you need the fate energy of Zhen Wuyang?” Jian Wushuang looked at him and said.

Di Qing did not hide anything. “Every one Hua Year, Prince Mo will give me a wisp of Emperor Zhen Wuyang’s fate energy for me to comprehend, but the effect is minimal. I’m still stuck at the rank nine and can’t comprehend the mysterious Imperial Emperor’s fate energy.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang said, “Above the Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal is the Emperor?”

Di Qing shook his head. “Emperors belong to the Grand Yan immortal realm, but the Grand Yan Immortal is by no means equal to the Emperor. It can even be said that they are two completely different existences.”

“To become an Emperor, one has to comprehend and derive one’s own Imperial Emperor fate energy. Only then can one create the Heavenly Court and control the Daos of countless Heavenly Region.”

“I’ve been trapped as a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal for a long time, so long that I’ve almost forgotten the past.”

Fatigue flashed across his eyes. “If I didn’t tell you, you probably wouldn’t have believed me. I’m actually from the same era as the Great Si Region’s Emperor, Zhen Wuyang.”

“But when he was a Five Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, he comprehended and derived Imperial Emperor’s fate energy, while I have been trapped in Nine Revolutions for countless years, but I have still been stagnant and have not been able to sense even a trace of fate energy.”

He sighed as he said this.

Jian Wushuang understood a little after hearing it. He said slowly, “In the end, the cultivation is about the comprehension and control of the way of heaven and fate energy. These mysterious things can’t be comprehended by talent. The only thing you can do is to comprehend and be appropriate. Although what I said is a little empty, it is the truth.”

“Your Dao and your fate energy might appear in your heart one day in the future.”

Di Qing was silent. He began to reflect on the meaning of Jian Wushuang’s words, as if he was thinking about something. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Jian Wushuang did not say anything more. He fell into deep thought and started to work on the Emperor Liu Ya’s runes in his divine sense.

Liu Ya Heavenly Emperor Runes were the last Comprehension inheritance of Emperor Liu Ya. It was impossible for Jian Wushuang to not be tempted.

He had a feeling that even if he comprehended just a little bit, it would be an earth-shaking change for his current situation.

However, Comprehension was not like treating a guest to a meal. It was only natural for a guest to have a meal, and there were unknown variables involved.

This was the first time Jian Wushuang had come into contact with a Great Dao that belonged to an Emperor. Naturally, he was extremely nervous.

In his divine sense, the Liu Ya Heavenly Emperor Runes showed a unique brilliance, making people feel a sense of respect and pilgrimage, and even more revealing an ancient aura.

Jian Wushuang turned into a phantom and walked in his consciousness.

After tens of millions of years of cultivation and growing step by step from insignificant to present, his consciousness had long reached perfection at Ancestor-realm, becoming a constantly changing sky sea.

With his vast and boundless divine sense, he could go to any corner he wanted in an instant.

The Liu Ya Heavenly Emperor Runes occupied more than half of the space in his divine sense, and it looked like a sleeping bird in the clouds.

The closer he got to the comprehension, the more unbearable the heat swept over him. It burned the clothes that Jian Wushuang’s shadow was wearing, revealing his solid chest.

After the arm that was severed by the Liu Ya Imperial Emperor was remade, a terrifying aura surged out from the skin of his entire arm, as though dark green blood was flowing.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang also felt that the Ancestral Phoenix blood that Feng Qi, the Matriarch of the Phoenix clan, had left in his body in the divine power universe, had become full from its original weak state.

Everything seemed to have been done by the Liu Ya Heavenly Emperor Runes.

Jian Wushuang’s chest was bare, and his long hair that was tied behind him had been untied. It was flying in the air, and the brilliant divine patterns were flowing in his hair.

He walked forward slowly, facing the dormant cloud with the power of the ancient world, and reached out a finger to touch it.

In an instant, the mountains and seas were destroyed, the great sun withered, and the entire divine sense was set off with a great momentum.

Then, the hazy cloud materialized into a flying bird.

The dark green bird had six horns on its head, each of which was a different color, beautiful and mysterious.

It opened its eyes and its pure golden pupils seemed to see through Jian Wushuang in an instant.

Their eyes met, as if they were separated by an entire era. There was a desolate and ancient aura that he could not bear. He felt that every cell and pore in his body was under a heavy pressure and began to break apart.

“Return to where you’ve come from. This is not fate that you can control now. You can only have it when the great catastrophe is coming,” the bird with six horns and millions of feathers looked at Jian Wushuang and said.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang could be considered to be suffering in silence. He stood still on the spot and could not move at all. His entire body was completely captured by the aura.

Wisps of comprehension aura that were like wisps of mist all wanted to enter his body without caring about anything. At this moment, he could not run even if he wanted to.
