4428 Killing a Half-Step to Unrivaled Expert

“Boom!”

It was like the sound of spring thunder!

The Four Seasons sword technique suddenly changed again. The cold winter melted and turned into a warm spring that nourished everything silently.

Chi Chi Chi.

The cold wind and snow that filled the sky gradually faded away. What was left was a soft drizzle that fell from the sky.

Midwinter, warm spring, scorching summer, and cold autumn.

The four great solar terms were the four sword essences contained in the Four Seasons sword technique!

Its complexity and profoundness were beyond one’s imagination!

Warm spring wasn’t a sword move that specialized in killing among the Four Seasons sword intent, but it was the most dangerous sword move!

The solar term of spring brought about the revival of all living things. Under the peaceful surface, there was brutal killing and plundering!

“Rumble!”

In the universe, it was as if the entire starry sky had disappeared at this moment. There was a continuous spring rain and thunder, as if it was playing a divine song of destruction.

Ruler Jade Cauldron held his horsetail whisk as he stared at the world around him.

The rain falling from the sky was sword Qi, the rumbling Thunder was sword Qi, and even the gentle wind was sword Qi!

One after another, the sword Qi filled the entire world!

There was no way to avoid it, and it was an ambush from all sides!

In just half an incense’s time, Ruler Jade Cauldron’s divine body was cut apart by countless sword Qi, and a rain of blood fell. He was like a bloody man.

His hair was disheveled and his Daoist robe was in tatters. He was in an extremely sorry state.

“Jian Wushuang, do you really want to fight to the death with me?”

Jian Wushuang looked at him indifferently and replied, “If you can survive this strike, I’ll spare your life. What’s the harm in that?”

“Good! Jian Wushuang, is this the reason why you weren’t afraid when you faced me? However, don’t forget that you’re not the only one in the world who has a trump card. I, Jade Cauldron, also have one!”

Ruler Jade Cauldron took a deep breath, and the look of contempt in his eyes was replaced by a grave expression.

The next moment.

He said word by word, “Supreme Divine Art, Nine Cauldrons suppress the world!”

“Break!!!”

In an instant, Supreme Jade Cauldron’s body began to glow with divine light, and countless true intents of the great Dao appeared in his eyes.

His already powerful aura rose sharply again!

In the void, nine huge cauldrons were formed!

These nine huge cauldrons were ancient and magnificent. As soon as they appeared, they were like the ocean-stabilizing godly needles that suppressed the raging sea, instantly freezing the overturned heaven and earth!

One hundred thousand rays of sword Qi, which were constantly emitting cold light and turning into spring rain, collapsed at the same time!

This remarkable power was Supreme Jade Cauldron’s most powerful technique, and he had once relied on this remarkable power to instantly kill a half-step unparalleled Supreme!

His title of Supreme Jade Cauldron originated from this divine ability!

Kachacha.

The void seemed to be unable to withstand the nine Cauldrons as it shattered inch by inch. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Explode!”

Ruler Jade Cauldron shouted with all his might.

In an instant, the nine Cauldrons were like divine dragons rising into the abyss. They spun and rose into the sky!

The nine Cauldrons were connected to each other, and muffled sounds kept coming out of them, as if the war drums of the ancient heavenly court were being beaten, deafening everyone!

BOOM!

In the next moment, the nine Cauldrons exploded at the same time!

An indescribable magnificent force exploded and turned into a destructive shock wave that swept in all directions!

Under this power, no matter if it was the continuous spring rain, the surging spring breeze, or the rolling Thunder, the wind and clouds were all blown away.

At the same time, they were all crushed!

“Good skill!”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and took half a step back. He opened his fists and his fists emitted a bright golden light. The purple ” River ” character between his eyebrows became more and more dazzling, as if the God of War had descended!

“Come!”

Jian Wushuang struck out with his fists and the shock waves that were sweeping toward him were continuously destroyed.

Peng peng peng!

Each punch was extremely powerful and had the power to blow up a planet!

Jian Wushuang was like a warrior on the shore who was facing the tide. No matter how the shock waves hit him, he broke them one by one!

The Four Seasons sword Qi that Supreme Jade Cauldron had destroyed didn’t dissipate. Instead, it began to evolve again!

Winter turned to spring, spring turned to summer, summer turned to autumn, autumn turned to winter!

The four solar terms were endless and formed a cycle!

Once the Four Seasons sword Qi was formed, it would be a life and death situation!

...

This was the most powerful aspect of the Four Seasons sword Qi!

It was not like daybreak and dusk, where all the power of the attack would burst out at the same time and cause a destructive blow. It was like a millstone, moving slowly but constantly obliterating the enemy’s vitality.

After a few breaths.

A blazing sun rose up, and a scorching and violent force pounced on them!

The entire starry sky began to turn dry and red.

As for Supreme Jade Cauldron, his entire body began to emit white smoke. Like a withered flower bud, his skin gradually became dry and dry, and his hair began to fall off one by one.

His entire body seemed to be roasted into a human jerky. His blood began to boil and then turned into smoke.

A sense of great terror at the moment of life and death grew in his heart!

“Jian Wushuang, stop!!”

“I apologize to you! I shouldn’t have meddled in the matters between you and the King of Day!”

“Let me go! From now on, wherever you are, I, Jade Cauldron, will avoid you and respect you like a god!”

...

“Let me go!!!”

At this moment, all of Supreme Jade Cauldron’s pride and dignity had been shattered. All that was left was the fear of death and the desire to live!

He looked at Jian Wushuang in despair, his face full of pleading.

“Now you want to beg for mercy?”

Jian Wushuang looked at him indifferently and shook his head, “I’m sorry. I, Jian Wushuang, have always been a vengeful person. I will kill anyone who wants to kill me!”

“Die!”

In the next moment, Jian Wushuang stretched out his five fingers and grabbed at the void!

Bang!

In an instant, the blazing sun formed from the Four Seasons sword Qi shot out with a loud bang and ruthlessly crashed into Supreme Jade Cauldron!

In an instant, Ruler Jade Cauldron’s face turned ashen.

With an earth-shattering explosion, the Tarot Divine Sword stabbed into Supreme Jade Cauldron’s chest. In the next moment, Supreme Jade Cauldron’s body and soul were destroyed.

The half-step unrivaled Ruler Jade Cauldron had fallen!

He was also the one with the highest cultivation who had died at Jian Wushuang’s hands!

Whoosh!

The Four Seasons world formed by the Tarot Divine Sword gradually collapsed. The Tarot Divine Sword turned into a golden light and flew back into Jian Wushuang’s hand.

The entire starry sky turned deathly silent.

As Jian Wushuang held the Tarot Divine Sword, he felt a connection with it.

“Eh? You’ve become stronger?”

Jian Wushuang could vaguely feel that the Tarot Divine Sword had become stronger and more demonic after killing Supreme Jade Cauldron.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang recalled what Martial Sword Immortal had said to him at the banquet in the Divine Life Palace.

The most terrifying part of a Supreme great ancestral weapon was that it could continuously grow stronger!

As for the Tarot sword, it was the one that was in charge of killing.

“Killing…can it make the Tarot Divine Sword stronger?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a hint of thought. He immediately pulled out his sword and inserted the Tarot Divine Sword into the Tarot scabbard, letting the scabbard nurture the Tarot Divine Sword.
