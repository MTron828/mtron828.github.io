4146 The Ninth Kalpa King’s Desire

“The birth of a divine medicine?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

When this godly medicine appeared, it caused a huge commotion and attracted many experts. Among those experts who rushed over, some of them recognized this godly medicine and said that this Supreme-grade godly medicine can be refined into a divine pill that can increase the chances of breaking through to the Supreme-being realm! The peak-Level Ultimate Ruler said.

“What did you just say?” The Ninth Kalpa King’s eyes suddenly burst out with a bright light.

Both Jian Wushuang and Divine Marquis Qingfeng were shocked. They looked at each other in shock.

Supreme-grade divine medicine was rare.

In particular, this kind of divine medicine that could increase the chances of an Ultimate Ruler breaking through to the Supreme-being realm was extremely rare in the universe.

Jian Wushuang was still a Ruler of the fourth level, so he was not in a hurry to use the divine medicine to break through to the Supreme level. However, it was a different story for the Rulers of the ultimate level.

That was breaking through to the Supreme-being realm!

This was something that every Ultimate Ruler dreamed of.

Even if this divine medicine could only slightly increase the chances of one breaking through to a higher level, it would be enough to drive all of the Ultimate Rulers crazy!

Just like the Ninth Kalpa King!

The Ninth Kalpa King had always been recognized as the number one genius in the Divine Life Palace, at least before Jian Wushuang’s arrival.

However, over the years, the Ninth Kalpa King’s status in the Divine Life Palace had been getting lower and lower. It was because he had stayed at the level of an Ultimate Ruler for too long and the Divine Life Palace had given him enough resources and a price, but he had still not broken through to become a Supreme. This had disappointed many higher-ups of the Divine Life Palace.

All these years, the Ninth Kalpa King had been enduring silently. Even though he had comprehended a terrifying killer move like the divine Kingdom of one thought, he had never revealed it. This was because he knew that only by breaking through to the Supreme level would he truly rise to a whole new level. Otherwise, everything else would be useless.

It could be said that among the many Ultimate Rulers in the Divine Life Palace, the Ninth Kalpa King’s desire to break through to the Supreme level was the strongest!

After all, he already had the battle strength of a Supreme and had control of the One Thought Divine Kingdom. Once he broke through to the Supreme-being realm, he would definitely have the battle strength of a top-tier Supreme-being, and his future potential would be boundless.

However, the crucial point was that he had been unable to break through after so many years. Even he himself was somewhat uncertain if it was possible for him to break through and become a Supreme martial artist.

And now, there was a huge opportunity in front of him.

It was the godly medicine that had just appeared!

This was a divine herb that could be refined into a divine pill, a divine herb that could increase the chances of breaking through to the Supreme-being realm!

Even if it only increased the chances of a breakthrough by 10%, it was definitely enough to make the Ninth Kalpa King go crazy.

“Is what you said true?” The Ninth Kalpa King’s eyes were burning as he stared at the five people in front of him.

“Of course it’s true. Now that the news has spread, I reckon that many Rulers have already rushed there. However, it should take some time for that godly medicine to appear. If you rush over now, you might be able to make it in time.” The peak-Level Ultimate Ruler said.

“Let’s go! Let’s hurry over!!” The Ninth Kalpa King growled in a low voice, and his speed instantly burst out.

Jian Wushuang and Divine Marquis Qingfeng looked at each other and followed without hesitation. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The Tarot Ruins were vast and boundless, and many Rulers of the universe had been wandering in the ruins for tens of thousands of years. Many places in the ruins had been named.

For example, the Fengyang Canyon was the place where the Fengyang Divine Fruit had appeared.

The Fengyang Divine Fruit was a rare treasure.

However, he did not expect that an even more precious Supreme-grade divine medicine would appear in the Fengyang Canyon not long after the Fengyang Divine Fruit appeared.

Fengyang Canyon was not far from where the three of them were. With their speed, they arrived at Fengyang Canyon in less than an hour.

The air above the huge Fengyang Canyon was already filled with people. Countless Rulers were confronting each other, their swords drawn and bows bent. The air was filled with the smell of gunpowder.

Jian Wushuang and Ninth Kalpa King were not in a hurry to show themselves. Instead, they hid in a void and watched the scene from afar.

“There really are many experts.”

Jian Wushuang looked at the countless Rulers that had gathered in front of him. Almost all of them were Ultimate Rulers, and many of them were already at the top of the Ultimate Rulers.

There were more than ten Rulers who were almost invincible like Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and the Ruler Violet Eye.

Moreover, they had already shown their faces. Many others were probably like them, hiding in the surrounding void, waiting for an opportunity.

“The godly medicine is still there.”

The Ninth Kalpa King’s eyes shone with unprecedented fierceness as he stared at the void in the middle of the canyon. There was a blood-colored divine medicine that was emitting a unique aura.

The Ninth Kalpa King did not recognize this divine medicine at all. However, there were so many experts present, many of whom had extremely high attainments in natural treasures or some divine medicine. They were all so greedy for this divine medicine.

Clearly, it was true that this godly medicine could increase the chances of Rulers breaking through to the Supreme realm after being refined into a divine pill.

“It seems like we’re not late. However, there are so many Rulers present, including the Ruler teams from the Great Void Divine Hall and Blood Sky Hall. It won’t be easy to get the divine medicine under the eyes of so many people.” The Ninth Kalpa King narrowed his eyes.

Although he was arrogant, he was not blindly conceited or stupid. The Ruler’s teams under the major powers of the universe had many extraordinary strengths. He naturally did not fear them one on one, but if they worked together, he would have a headache.

One had to know that the Rulers sent by the top powers of the universe could not be weak.

“Ninth Kalpa King, your old friend, the Ruler Silver Roc, is also there.” Divine Marquis Qingfeng looked at the hook-nosed youth standing at the entrance of the valley and joked.

He was rather relaxed. From the start, he knew that it was impossible for this godly medicine to fall into his hands.

Therefore, he did not think about fighting for it.

The Ninth Kalpa King snorted coldly and did not speak.

Jian Wushuang looked at the peak Ultimate Rulers in Fengyang Canyon from afar and sighed. These Ultimate Rulers could wander in the ruins for tens of thousands of years without being plundered or killed, so they were not weak.

For example, if he went all out, his fighting power could rival that of a top ultimate master. He could even fight with Ultimate Masters like Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and purple-eye Ruler who were almost invincible. However, such power was obviously not at the top in Fengyang Canyon.

“Eh? Divine Emperor Thousand Leaves and the rest didn’t come?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Suddenly, he was startled.

“If you guys don’t want this godly medicine, then I’ll take it!”

A sharp laugh suddenly sounded in the sky.
