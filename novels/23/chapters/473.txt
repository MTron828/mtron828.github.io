Chapter 474: The World Scroll

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Mr. Swordsman, here you are.” The courier gave an Interspatial Ring to Jian Wushuang.

“Thanks,” Jian Wushuang said and then let him leave.

“Bing Huo.” Jian Wushuang gave him a glance.

“Lord,” Bing Huo replied respectfully. Ever since Jian Wushuang visited the Magic Flame Territory and made Magic Flame Lord relinquish the Dragon Blood Gem Mine, all the generals had become obedient to Jian Wushuang.

“I need to do a closed-door meditation. Don’t interrupt me unless it’s something very important,” ordered Jian Wushuang.

“Okay.” Bing Huo nodded respectfully.

Soon after, Jian Wushuang arrived at a secret chamber in the Lord Mansion.

He sat with his legs crossed and turned his hand over, where a scroll then appeared.

“World Scroll!”

Jian Wushuang looked at the scroll with a flicker of anticipation in his eyes.

He had exchanged 80,000 battle achievements for it in the Treasure Vault of the Marquis Piaoxue Camp.

There were numerous treasures in the Treasure Vault. Some treasures were very helpful for experts to comprehend the Origin, like the World Scroll, which was considered the most valuable among the treasures related to the comprehension of the World Origin.

Jian Wushuang was able to afford a treasure valued at 80,000 battle achievements because he had contributed the most in the Puppet Master Cave Mansion and received 120,000 battle achievements.

He opened the World Scroll and then started studying it.

Meditating for a while, Jian Wushuang opened his eyes with a smile on his face.

“This scroll contains a whole world indeed,” Jian Wushuang said.

The World Scroll was similar to the Cottage World that he had encountered in the Beimo Cave Mansion, but more delicate than the latter.

An expert could only meditate on the Cottage World once and his talent determined how long he could meditate on it. However, an expert could meditate on the World Scroll at any time.

“It’s a pity that I could only meditate on the Cottage World once, but now, this World Scroll is more exquisite than the Cottage World. Moreover, I can meditate whenever I want. There’s no time limit.” Jian Wushuang nodded with satisfaction.

The World Scroll was very useful to him.

He took a deep breath and moved his mind. Then a blood-red figure appeared beside him.

The figure wore a scarlet robe and a wicked scarlet mask. He was Jian Wushuang’s Slaughter Doppelganger.

In the Nanyang Continent, Jian Wushuang’s Slaughter Doppelganger had gotten killed once. Soon after that, his Slaughter Doppelganger formed again, but he rarely used it.

Now, his Slaughter Doppelganger could help him a lot.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and gave Slaughter Doppelganger the Six-story Pagoda that he obtained from the Puppet Master Cave Mansion.

The Six-story Pagoda contained six Slaughter Restrictions. The first Restriction held 999 types of Slaughter Occult, which were a shortcut to the Slaughter Dao.

The Six-story Pagoda was precious to a warrior who was meditating on the Slaughter Origin.

The World Scroll was only designed for comprehension of the World Origin.

“From now on, I will focus on meditating on the World Scroll and World Origin, and my Slaughter Doppelganger has started meditating on the first Restriction and Slaughter Occult,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

His true self and his doppelganger worked separately. And with the help of two treasures, he was yielding double the results.

As he stayed in his secret room, quietly perceiving through meditation, time passed by.

In the Marquis Piaoxue campsite, Spirit Lord stood respectfully on the top of a huge pagoda.

In front of him, a young man in a long silver robe casually sat on the step, supporting his forehead with his hand.

“Spirit Lord.” The young man spoke in a warm voice.

“Marquis.” Spirit Lord looked at the young man.

The young man was Marquis Piaoxue, one of the 72 Marquises in the Divine Land.

“100 years have passed. Sword-suppression Valley will open again. Su Ming has sent invitations and invited many Sword Principle experts to take part in this meeting. As one of the 72 Marquises, I also received the invitation. Master Su Ming asked me to recommend three experts, but it’s not easy to find three Sword Principle experts,” Marquis Piaoxue said in a low voice.

“Sword-suppression Valley? Master Su Ming?”?Spirit Lord raised his eyebrows.

He had high status and knew a lot, so he knew about Sword-suppression Valley.

“Marquis, Master Su Ming asked you to choose three Sword Principle experts, so the three experts should not be too mediocre, or Sir Su Ming will get angry,” Spirit Lord said.

“You’re right.”

Marquis Piaoxue spread out his hands. “Our camp has lots of experts, but as for those who are qualified to go to Sword-suppression Valley, I thought for a good while and can only assign two experts.

“One is Hunjian Lord. He has awakened his Sword Soul, so he’s qualified for it.

“The other is Tianming Lord. Though he hasn’t awakened his Sword Soul, he is remarkable in Sword Principle and adept at varied first-grade sword techniques. He even created a powerful Sword Skill.

“Those two lords are excellent. As for the third one, I’ve thought of several experts, but I feel that none of them are strong enough to go to Sword-suppression Valley.”

On hearing this, Spirit Lord said with a smile, “Marquis, if the last expert has not been determined, I can recommend one.”

“Who?” Marquis Piaoxue looked at him.

“Blood Sword Lord, Swordsman,” Spirit Lord said with a smile.

“Swordsman?” Marquis Piaoxue was a bit surprised. “Last time, you talked about the fight in the cave mansion of the Inner Area and seemed to mention Swordsman. I remember you spoke highly of him.”

“Yes.”

Spirit Lord nodded. “He is amazing. Though he is a Saint Realm expert, his battle strength is superior to many intermediate lords’. More importantly, he is proficient in Sword Principle and has awakened the Double First-grade Sword Soul!”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
