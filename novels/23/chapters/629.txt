Chapter 630: Qianqiu Wuhen!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Bang! Bang! Bang!

On each of the platforms, a fierce battle was taking place as the sounds of intense combat continuously echoed throughout the area.

Among the five battles, two of them were settled in a short moment. Beicang King and Zhuge Qing, from the Ancient World and the Eternal World, were kicked out the battlefield by the Puppet Fighters.

As for the other three battles, they lasted a little longer than the first two, but they still ended with the three challengers failing in less than 15 minutes.

In short, the first batch of challengers all failed!

The geniuses all forced a bitter smile after seeing the results.

“The Puppet Fighters are so incredible, I don’t think I can hold on for even three breaths against their attacks.”

“There’s no way I can survive the second round.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Even though we can’t make it to the next round, we should try our best to prolong the battle and draw attention from the sects.”

Most of the participants knew that their failure in this round was certain, but they still wanted to do their best.

“The second batch of challengers...” The host read out five more names.

The moment their names were called, those people immediately went onto the platforms to fight.

As time went by, batch after batch, the geniuses went forward faced the challenge, but most of them lost the battle while only some really powerful ones made it to the next round, and all of them were from the Eternal World.

So far, one-third of the participants from the Ancient World had tried their luck on the platforms, but none of them had won.

Xue Feng, who had previously been defeated by Feng with one strike, had managed to hold on for a moment when fighting against a Puppet Fighter as powerful as Feng, but she failed in the end without a doubt.

“Now, it’s time for the 41st batch!

Feng.

Kang Yuan!

Xue Hou!

Xuanyuan Wudao!

Yi Jie!”

At this time, another five geniuses walked onto the platforms.

The geniuses from the Ancient World all looked up towards one of the platforms, only for the reason that their number one expert, Feng, was on it.

In no time, Feng was locked in a fierce battle with the Puppet Fighter.

Just like the five Puppet Fighters, Feng had comprehended the first level of the Destruction Dao. He had even made some progress in the second level which resulted in him having a better comprehension of the Dao than the puppets.

Not only that, the saber technique he displayed was so forceful and domineering that it overpowered the puppet’s spear technique. With all this combined, he was able to gain the upper hand in the battle and suppress his opponent completely.

The battle lasted over 15 minutes like this, which really astonished many geniuses from the Eternal World.

Sure enough, Feng survived this round.

The experts in the Skyward Pavilion had also witnessed Feng’s performance.

“Even though Feng is from the Ancient World, he is highly gifted in the Destruction Dao. Go find him and tell him that we’d love to accept him as an outer disciple.” The voice came from the room of the Thousand Star Sect.

“Tell him there is a spot for him as an outer disciple.”

Many top sects hurriedly sent their invitations to Feng, but all of them only offered the position of outer disciple.

As for the three magnates, Feng was still beneath their notice.

Meanwhile, on the Drill Ground, the battles continued.

From the Eternal World’s group, a red-robed man with red hair caught some eyes. As he walked forward slowly, even his eyes had a red shine to them.

The moment he stepped out from his group, he attracted everyone’s attention, including the three magnates and the experts in the Skyward Pavilion.

“It’s him!”

“Good lord!”

“He is Qianqiu Wuhen, a peerless genius who has the ability to be in the top five among all the challengers in the Firmament Territory Feast.”

Some of the geniuses from the Eternal World frowned at this red-robed man with a hint of fear in their eyes. After all, this man was the most outstanding one among the super geniuses that had drawn the crowd’s attention in the first round.

Of course, Feng, Huo Ying, Bing Shan, and Jian Wushuang could be called super geniuses as well, but only within their own group.

In the first round, Qianqiu Wuhen demonstrated his power by defeating his opponents like a storm of lightning.

No one knew exactly how powerful he was, but they knew that he was terrifying.

“With his level of power, he can directly beat the Puppet Fighter down.”

“Yes, he can, but I wonder how long it will take him to do that.”

“I bet he can do it within 10 breaths.”

Geniuses from the Eternal World were discussing the matter with interest.

In the rooms on the top floor of the Skyward Pavilion, the three magnates kept a close eye on Qianqiu Wuhen.

They were all looking forward to seeing his brilliant performance.

Under all those eyes, Qianqiu Wuhen moved onto a platform.

“Start!”

As soon as the words were heard, the Puppet Fighters all made their moves.

Qianqiu Wuhen acted at almost the same moment.

He stretched out his hand and punched toward his opponent in a gentle and casual way.

“Boom!”

The puppet moved back rapidly as the sound rang out.

A moment later, another palm carrying a formidable power landed on the puppet.

“Boom!”

The powerful Puppet Fighter was smashed into pieces under the force.
