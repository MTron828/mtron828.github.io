Chapter 610: Nine Levels of Dao!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“First of all is the comprehension of Dao!” Emperor Xiao stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Dao is evolved from the Origin source. The kind of the Origin you cultivate will determine the kind of Dao you comprehend. Like many warriors you have encountered, nearly all of them have combined the Weapon Dao with the Origin, and that’s how they comprehend their Dao.”

“However, the Origin Dao is the Origin Dao, while the Weapon Dao is the Weapon Dao. They are completely different concepts. They have forcefully combined two different natures together. Although they have comprehended Dao, their Dao is unfocused nor complete. Strictly speaking, it can not be classified into any type of Dao.”

“The warriors who comprehend Dao in this way, would be destined to stay at the Skyscraping Realm and would never raise their strength, unless they could get an experts’ guidance.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He had encountered a lot of Daos, from Su Ming’s Illusory Sword Principle, to Blind Emperor’s Heart Sword Principle, to Emperor Fengxiao’s Waterdrop Sword Principle, to Emperor Golden Snake’s Phantom Saber Principle, etc, but all of them were Daos comprehended through the combination of the Origin and Weapons.

In the beginning, Jian Wushuang felt that these principles were very weird. Later, as he really comprehended the Slaughter Dao, he found the power of his Slaughter Dao was much more powerful than those Daos.

Only now did he finally understand it.

The Illusory Sword Principle, Heart Sword Principle, Waterdrop Sword Principle, and Phantom Saber Principle were all Daos comprehended through an incomplete way. Naturally there were far inferior than Jian Wushuang’s pure and perfect Slaughter Dao.

“Kid, I know that you have comprehended two Origins. Among them, your comprehension of the Slaughter Origin is higher, and you have comprehended the Slaughter Dao.” Emperor Xiao looked over to him. “However, it’s a pity that I am not good at the Slaughter Dao. Hence, I have to ask Di Jing to teach you.”

“Senior Di Jing.” Jian Wushuang looked at Di Jing immediately.

“Little guy, I specialize in the Slaughter Dao. Although there were some accidents and I nearly died, I have recovered now. With my comprehension of the Slaughter Dao, I could even be the Master of an expert in the Eternal Realm. There’s no problem to teach you, of course.” Di Jing smiled. “By the way, the Six-storey Pagoda, actually... It was given to you by me.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes shone. He had guessed the truth.

The Six-storey Pagoda was full of magic power. Even the Restrictions of the first storey were incomparably abstruse. After breaking through the first storey, Jian Wushuang directly comprehended the Slaughter Dao. Yet, there were more profound Restriction in the other five stories. It was so great! Could it belong to a Puppet Master?

There was only one answer, and it was that Di Jing gave the Six-storey Pagoda to him through the hands of the Puppet Master.

Hum! A figure rushed out from Jian Wushuang’s body, and it was his Slaughter Body. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Then, in the next three years, I, the Slaughter Body will rely on you, Senior Di Jing.” Jian Wushaung’s Slaughter Body bowed and said.

Jian Wushuang could only shrug his shoulders.

He was not good at or fond of teaching disciples, but as long as it was Emperor Xiao’s order, he had to obey.

“Although I am not good at the Slaughter Dao, I am good at the World Dao.” Emperor Xiao spoke again.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang looked towards Emperor Xiao with expectant eyes.

Di Jing was Emperor Xiao’s subordinate. Undoubtedly, Emperor Xiao’s strength was much stronger than Di Jing’s, and the former’s personal instruction was better than the latter’s.

Without saying anything, Emperor Xiao just waved his hand. Immediately, gusts of World Energy gathered and an incomparably huge khaki prison appeared in the garden.

“This is?” Jian Wushuang looked at the khaki prison in surprise.

“This is the World Prison.” Emperor Xiao explained, “This World Prison was formed by the gathering of World Energy. If you stay inside the World Prison, you can clearly sense the surrounding World Dao, and the World Prison will put pressure upon you and bring suffering to you. What you have to do is to comprehend the World Dao as soon as possible, and then you can break the World Prison completely.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed, and then his eyebrows slightly raised.

He needed to completely break the World Prison?

Although he had not actually entered the World Prison to cultivate, standing outside of it, he could see how solid the World Prison was. Let alone him, even the Dark Emperor, whose offensive power was No. 1 in the Ancient World and who had created a Secret Skill, could not dream of breaking the prison, could he?

“There are nine levels of Dao!”

Emperor Xiao said again, “In this world, there are many types of Dao, but each kind of Dao has nine levels of understanding. Every level is incomparably abstruse. You, and numerous warriors who have comprehended Dao, have just stepped across the threshold of Dao. Your comprehension of Dao is very low. Let alone the nine levels, even the first level is incomparably difficult for you!”

“Even the first level is incomparably difficult?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“Yes,” Emperor Xiao continued, “Let alone your Ancient World, even in the Eternal World, a warrior of the Skyscraping Realm who could completely comprehend the first level of the Occult of a Dao is very rare. Those people are really geniuses even in the Eternal World, and many sects would fight to get them. The World Prison in front of you could only be broken when the first level of the Occult of the World Dao is comprehended completely.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang became silent.

According to what Emperor Xiao said, the warrior who could comprehend the first level of the Occult were top geniuses even in the Eternal World. He, however, had never comprehended the World Dao at all, and was far away from the comprehension of the first level of the Occult of the World Dao. What’s more important, he only had three years.

Could he break the World Prison in three years? Emperor Xiao thought too highly of him.

“Kid, don’t worry. I don’t expect you to break the World Prison in three years, but I hope you could try your best to break it, it doesn’t matter how much you can achieve. Any comprehension of the first level of the Occult of the World Dao is an achievement.” Emperor Xiao said.

“That’s good.” Jian Wushuang let out a sigh of relief.

“All right, you can go into the World Prison and try.” Emperor Xiao said.

Jian Wushuang nodded and then directly stepped into the World Prison without hesitation.

As soon as Jian Wushuang entered the huge World Prison, he immediately sensed the extremely dense World Energy, which had become a physical substance according to special laws and thus created the incomparably solid World Prison.

“How magical! How amazing!”

Jian Wushuang looked around with a sense of astonishment in his eyes.
