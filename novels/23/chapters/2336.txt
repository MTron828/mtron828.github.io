Chapter 2337: Shocked

Shocked!

Zhuo Yunfeng was completely stumped. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Moments ago, he had declared that Jian Wushuang had no rights to be there with just his Chaotic Realm cultivation base. He should remain in the Purple Virtue Hall with Luo Xinqin while looking for an opportunity to flee.

Immediately after, Jian Wushuang had engaged Zhuge Yun in an intense battle and held his own well. In fact, he had the edge.

If Jian Wushuang had no right to participate in this battle, wouldn’t he be doing worse?

Dang!

The sound of metal clashing heavily rang.

Jian Wushuang was knocked back several steps but he regained his footing swiftly.

“In terms of the intensity of strength, I’m still a notch weaker,” Jian Wushuang mumbled to himself.

“Junior!”

Zhuge Yun’s haggard face had became extremely hideous. Flames of anger were raging in his eyes.

Jian Wushuang’s talent had made him feel fear.

He was just an Early Stage Chaotic Realm and yet his grasp of the Sword Principle was so profound. He was even able to match evenly against a Chaotic Divine Demon with his Early Stage Chaotic Realm cultivation base.

This made Zhuge Yun want to kill him even more.

“Die now!”

After a deafening roar, Zhuge Yun seemed to morph into a white glowing sword.

Dazzling white light illuminated heaven and earth. It was as though there was a white sun that had come out of nowhere.

Shocking sword essence swept towards Jian Wushuang with overwhelming momentum.

“He’s using his ultimate move now?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes but let out a chuckle soon after. “Lin Family is in a hugely disadvantageous state. I can’t play around with them further. It’s time to finish him off.”

Hu!

That glowing white sword flushed towards Jian Wushuang relentlessly.

Endless sword essence sliced through the air and shot expeditiously towards Jian Wushuang.

It was so fast that even a real Chaotic Divine Demon could not react to it, let alone a Chaotic Realm or Half Step Divine Demon.

“Junior, you should be proud to die from my strongest sword technique.” Zhuge Yun’s face was twitching and a chilling voice came from him.

“Shuang!!!”

Zhuo Yunfeng’s complexion was deathly pale.

He saw that Jian Wushuang’s body was being pierced by that glowing white light of Zhuge Yun. Subconsciously, he assumed Jian Wushuang had been killed by Zhuge Yun.

However, his penetrated figure split into two and dissipated into thin air.

“What?” Zhuge Yun was astounded. “He dodged it? How could it be? Even a real Chaotic Divine Demon couldn’t avoid my strongest strike.”

“You don’t understand? It’s really simple. It’s because my understanding of the Spacetime Rules of Order is way deeper than you imagined.” A mocking voice rang in Zhuge Yun’s ears suddenly. Zhuge Yun turned around immediately and only saw a brilliant light flashing across.

That brilliant sword light was mesmerizing and intoxicating.

When he swung that strike, even the void space was affected as ripples reverberated through.

The surrounding spacetime seemed come to a halt at that moment.

That was the Spacetime Sword Principle that Jian Wushuang had created, Snow Cleave!

Zhuge Yun stood there blankly, only seeing the strike before his eyes. This was the last time he would see anything at all.

Pfft!

The sword light sliced through mercilessly as Zhuge Yun’s head was tossed into the sky.

The publicly-recognized number one sword cultivator and a Chaotic Divine Demon had been killed on the spot!

“Dead? He’s dead?”

“Shuang killed Zhuge Yun?”

When Zhuo Yunfeng saw Zhuge Yun’s head before him, he couldn’t believe what he was seeing.

Several people in the vicinity witnessed this scene as well.

“How could this be possible?”

“Ancient Elder is dead?”

“It’s Jian Wushuang! He killed a Chaotic Divine Demon?”

Regardless of if it was the Zhuge Family, Lin Family, Xiang Family, or the numerous experts that had been hired by both parties, they were all dumbfounded at this juncture.

A Chaotic Divine Demon could definitely be overbearing in Anjiu Prefecture. In fact, he would be a first-rate expert in the entire Wusha Barren Region.

In the battle today, Chaotic Divine Demon was undoubtedly the strongest battle force. The intense battle till now had resulted in lots of Chaotic Realm experts losing their lives. Even several Half Step Divine Demons had been killed. However, all Chaotic Divine Demons were intact and both parties had not seen the death of a Chaotic Divine Demon yet.

Even when Lin Family was in an absolute disadvantageous state, the four Chaotic Divine Demon still didn’t pose a life-threatening threat to him.

And now, the first Chaotic Divine Demon had fallen and the one who had killed him was only a Chaotic Realm.

“How is this possible?”

“It cannot be!”

“No matter how amazing a Chaotic Realm talent is, there’s no way he could kill a Chaotic Divine Demon in a direct battle!”

Everyone was in disbelief.

However, Jian Wushuang was still composed after killing Zhuge Yun. It was as though killing a Chaotic Divine Demon was an insignificant thing for him.

Moreover, he didn’t slow down. He moved and charged into the battle beside him.

Weng!!

A figure had moved to the side of a blue-haired lady silently.

The blue-haired lady was one of the three Chaotic Divine Demons from the Xiang Family.

She was going all out and was about to kill a Half Step Divine Demon from Lin Mansion when the figure appeared...

“What?”

The blue-haired lady got a big scare and didn’t care about killing the Half Step Divine Demon anymore. She dodged to one side and thrusted her black spear in the direction Jian Wushuang had charged to.

“Your reaction is pretty impressive.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. Moving his wrist slightly, the sword essence in his hand changed instantly.

The silent strike that aimed to slice the lady through her waist changed abruptly into a strike with the overwhelming momentum of a thunderstorm.

Peng!

The Blood Mountain Sword happened to clash with the tip of the long spear and deflect it slightly. Immediately after, Jian Wushuang took a huge stride forward before thrusting his Blood Mountain Sword forward. He circled the black long spear and went for the head of the blue-haired lady directly.

The blue-haired lady was astonished. However, she was quick to retract her long spear. Before Jian Wushuang could reach her head, she had pulled back the long spear to defend herself against the sword.

Dang!

A crisp collision sounded and the blue-haired lady was knocked back several steps.

Killing intent gleamed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

RUMBLE~~~

Terrifying swords explode like collapsing mountains and endless sword figures emerged and had the blue-haired lady completely surrounded.

“Shit!” The blue-haired lady was flabbergasted.

It was then a huge purple staff came from the side.

That purple staff crashed in dominantly and smashed Jian Wushuang’s countless sword shadows to the brink of collapse.

Huh?

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes, moved and dodged to the side.

The blue-haired lady recovered her composure and two figures appeared beside her at the same time.

Those two figures were none other than the other 2 Chaotic Divine Demons, one of which was the family head of Xiang Family, Xiang Zong.
