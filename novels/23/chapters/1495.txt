Chapter 1496: Emergency Summon

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

After he had shared everything he knew about the mysterious white fruit, the silver-armored old man took the two hundred million Chaos Gems and left.

After that, he and his two brothers found a concealed place to hide. For a hundred thousand years, they would be off the trail.

In a lofty tower, Tower Master Qi Fu, who had only revealed his consciousness shadow in Vientiane Tower’s sub-branch previously was standing there in person.

“White Blaze Fruit!”

“It’s really White Blaze Fruit. According to what the Universe God said earlier, the place where he got the White Blaze Fruit is most likely a cave dwelling that was left behind by an expert!”

There was light shimmering in Tower Master Qi Fu’s eyes. He thought for a while and he took out one token after another.

“Holy Emperor Jiu You, weren’t you looking for a White Blaze Fruit all this while? Vientiane Tower found one for you.”

“Emperor Chi Yun, let me tell you good news. It’s about White Blaze Fruit!”

“Owner of Sky Sword Mountain…”

Tower Master Qi Fu sent out a dozen messages in a short while.

The people that he sent messages to were all top experts on high positions in Eternal Chaotic World.

For instance, Holy Emperor Jiu You, Emperor Chi Yun, Owner of Sky Sword Mountain. They were all Almighties!.

After they received the messages, the dozens of Almighties were all excited.

“The news has spread. Vientiane Tower has already received enough advantages. As for how the Almighties want to fight for it, that is their concern,” Tower Master Qi Fu smiled maliciously.

“Go ahead and fight. The fiercer the fight, the more ferocious the fight, the better.”

“Vientiane Tower will be here watching all of you fight!”

“Haha.”

…

In Lineage of Star, after the battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace ended, Jian Wushuang entered Real God Hall to cultivate.

In the blink of an eye, four months’ time flew past.

The door of Real God Hall opened and Jian Wushuang walked out slowly.

When he walked out of the Real God Hall, Jian Wushuang was obviously smiling and he was rather delighted.

“At first, during the time of comprehension of four months, I wanted to improve my comprehension level of Reincarnation Doctrine. Who would have guessed… I didn’t improve much on Reincarnation Doctrine but achieved beginner level in Spacetime Doctrine!” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Back when he had entered Real God Hall to comprehend the doctrine for the first time, he could feel that his response towards Reincarnation Doctrine was the clearest. It was also the easiest to comprehend. Hence, he had fully concentrated and comprehended Reincarnation Doctrine for one month. In turn, he had mastered a slight bit of Power of Reincarnation.

However, besides Reincarnation Doctrine, the other clearest response he had received was towards Spacetime Doctrine.

During the four months’ time of comprehension, he was finally at the beginner level of comprehension of Spacetime Doctrine and he had mastered a slight bit of Power of Reincarnation.

In other words, he then understood both Reincarnation and Spacetime Doctrines simultaneously. He had mastered two Power of Heaven Way at the same time.

“Spacetime Doctrine is about spacetime. It is unfathomable. Although I have only mastered a slight bit of Power of Spacetime and it is far behind my understanding towards Reincarnation Doctrine, the slight bit of Power of Spacetime is sufficient to increase my moving speed, swordsmanship, and many other aspects tremendously. Even in terms of power, when the two Power of Heaven Way are amplified together, it will also increase madly!” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists.

Comprehension of an extra doctrine no doubt brought about a huge improvement in his overall power. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Spacetime Doctrine could cover many different areas and lead to an increase in power in various aspects.

“Previously, I was not confident enough to compete with the ten monsters in the top ten on Universe God ranking list. But now…” Jian Wushuang lifted the corners of his lips while he gave a chilly smile.

“Jian Wushuang.”

A hoary voice was heard and the one who spoke was the deacon elderly who guarded Real God Hall, “Hall Master Yuan sent me a message earlier and commanded me to inform you to see him immediately after you came out of Real God Hall. He is looking for you for an urgent matter.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

For the past four months, he had stayed in Real God Hall for cultivation and Hall Master knew about it. Hence, Hall Master Yuan didn’t send any messages to him or bother him but told the deacon elderly to inform him instead.

Jian Wushuang, of course, didn’t delay any further but immediately departed to the cave dwelling that Hall Master Yuan resided in.

In the cave dwelling made of unique crystals.

“Jian Wushuang, how did the cultivation in Real God Hall for four months go?” Hall Master Yuan smiled and asked Jian Wushuang.

“Not bad. My power has increased compared to before,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Your power increased again?” Hall Master Yuan looked delighted and he continued, “That’s great. There’s something that I need you to do. The stronger you are, the higher the chance.”

“Hall Master Yuan, what is it about?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The story starts from a unique treasure. The treasure is a fruit, named White Blaze Fruit. Have you heard of it?” Hall Master Yuan looked down.

“White Blaze Fruit?” Jian Wushuang shook his head but King of Venomous Worms in his body was caught by surprise, “White Blaze Fruit? There’s a White Blaze Fruit?”

“King of Venomous Worms, you know about White Blaze Fruits?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course, it is a very precious and rare treasure,” King of Venomous Worms sounded excited.

Hall Master Yuan continued, “This White Blaze Fruit is very precious. Even to Almighties, it is rather useful. There are countless genius treasures in Eternal Chaotic World, but out of all of them, White Blaze Fruit is absolutely in the top ten!”

“What?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

One that could be in the top ten among all genius treasures in the entire Eternal Chaotic World?

Extremely useful to Almighties.

The White Blaze Fruit was so precious?

“The more precious and the more useful a treasure is, the more difficult it is to nurture. During an ancient time that was far away, there was once a White Blaze Fruit Tree. The White Blaze Fruit Tree ripened and fell in various corners in Eternal Chaotic World. Later on, the White Blaze Fruit Tree was destroyed. Since then, White Blaze Fruit has been near to extinction. Over the years, we found one or two occasionally, but very rarely.

“A few thousand years ago, in a unique environment, there was a brand new White Blaze Fruit Tree and it was only a sapling…”

“Once the news spread, it immediately attracted a large amount of experts, including many Almighties. They participated in the fight for the sapling of the White Blaze Fruit Tree. After a ferocious battle, the sapling of the White Blaze Fruit Tree was won by Real God Wu Bei in the end.”

“Real God?” Jian Wushuang was shocked, “A battle among many Almighties but the sapling had fallen into the hands of a Real God? How was that possible?”

“If he was an inverse cultivator?” Hall Master Yuan looked at Jian Wushuang and said.

Jian Wushuang stunned.

Inverse cultivation was beyond comparison with one on the same level.

A Real God who was an inverse cultivator taking the treasure from the hands of many Almighties… it wasn’t impossible.

“Real God Wu Bei happens to be an inverse cultivator on the Real God level. He was extremely strong and no weaker than the Almighties. After the battle, he took the sapling of the White Blaze Fruit Tree under the watch of all Almighties. The Almighties couldn’t do anything to him,” Hall Master Yuan said.
