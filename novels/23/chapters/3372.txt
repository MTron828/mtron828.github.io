Chapter 3373: Suppression

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Is this...space-time imprisonment?”

Zhu Xin Master, who was fleeing frantically, sensed the changes in the surrounding space-time immediately and was shocked. “How is this possible? How did you master space-time imprisonment so quickly after cultivating for so long?”

“There are many things you don’t know.” Jian Wushuang smiled and appeared in front of Master Zhu Xin and Han Xin in the blink of an eye. Then, he waved his hand and an ancient blood-red tower appeared out of thin air, it expanded rapidly, and a majestic aura spread out from the bottom of the tower.

“A true treasure, a suppression type true treasure!” Zhu Xin Master and Han Xin were immediately terrified.

‘They were Principles Masters after all. Although they knew that their strength was inferior to Jian Wushuang, they thought that it would be very difficult for Jian Wushuang to kill or suppress them. However, with the help of a suppression type true treasure...it was completely different.

Suppression type true treasures were used to suppress experts.

Under normal circumstances, as long as the difference in strength between the two sides was huge, the stronger side could completely rely on the suppression type true treasure to suppress the weaker side.

“So what if you have a suppression type true treasure? Although you’re stronger than me, you’re not much stronger. As long as I have enough divine power, how can you suppress me?” Zhu Xin Master said coldly.

“Haha, Zhu Xin Master, I’m afraid you’ve made a mistake. Although I’m the one who took out this suppression type true treasure, I’m not the one who uses it.” Jian Wushuang laughed loudly.

“What?” Zhu Xin Master was stunned. The next moment, she saw the person controlling the blood tower.

The person controlling the blood tower was the sloppy old man who had previously made her feel unfathomable.

This sloppy old man was naturally the Demon Master Chen Huo. He was an existence at the peak of the sixth level of the Void. Now that he was in control of the blood-colored tower, a world-shaking might burst forth from it, in almost an instant, the blood-colored tower had already covered both Zhu

Xin Master and Han Xin.

“No, impossible!”

“How can this be?”

Zhu Xin Master and Han Xin struggled madly under the blood-colored tower. However, no matter how hard they struggled, they were unable to break free of the blood-colored tower.

In the end, the blood tower opened its bloody mouth like a beast and swallowed them.

‘The two Principles Masters could not resist at all and were suppressed in an instant.

As for the Peak Saints, Jian Wushuang did not let them go. He also suppressed them with the suppression-type holy treasure in the hands of the invincible saint-level helmet.

After doing all this, Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chen Huo gathered again.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, your suppression-type holy treasure is quite powerful. It should have reached the level of an advanced supreme treasure. Its value is extraordinary. How did you get such a precious treasure?” Demon Master Chenhuo returned the blood-red tower to Jian Wushuang, at the same

time, he asked.

“got this blood-red tower from a rule master i killed,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

He was telling the truth. More than 400 years ago, the battle on Saha Island had been earth-shaking. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Many Principles Masters had died in that battle, and Jian Wushuang had killed some of them with his own hands.

For example, the four flame divine guards around the Flame Saint Master and the Tianyou Master, who had reached the peak of the fifth void realm and was one of the top officials of the Destruction Saint Realm, had all been killed by Jian Wushuang after he had received the power from Blood Wave.

‘The four flame divine guards, which were treasures left behind by Tianyou Master and the others, naturally fell into Jian Wushuang’s hands.

‘The suppression-type supreme treasure, the blood tower, which Jian Wushuang took out was from Tianyou Master.

In fact, he had obtained many supreme treasures from the previous battle, and several of them were useful to him, but he did not have the time to use them. It was not until today that he gave them to Demon Master Chen Huo, that he handed them over to Demon Master Chen Huo to use.

“Zhu Xin and Han Xin have been suppressed. Now, Valley Master Longyu from the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley can’t refuse to meet me.” Jian Wushuang sneered and glanced at the blood-red tower in his hand, then, he kept the blood-red tower in his arms.

In the blood-red tower, Zhu Xin and Han Xin were trapped inside. Although their strength was not restricted or restricted, and they were constantly bombarding the surrounding towers, no matter how they used their skills...they were unable to shake the blood tower in the slightest.

“I’s useless. This tower is a suppression type true treasure, and it is estimated to have reached the level of a high-level true treasure. With such a true treasure, just the two of us won’t be able to move, much less destroy this tower.” Zhu Xin Master attacked a few times, he shook his head helplessly.

“Uncle-master, Heavenly Sword Marquis did not kill us immediately. Instead, he suppressed us within this blood tower. What is he trying to do?” Han Xin asked with a frown.

“He is trying to...” Zhu Xin narrowed her eyes. She swallowed the words that were about to come out of her mouth, “Don’t worry about what his motive is. In short, Heavenly Sword Marquis isn’t trying to kill us. He is just trying to use the two of us to threaten our Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley. If

nothing goes wrong, the Valley Master already knows that the two of us are being suppressed by Heavenly Sword Marquis. He will definitely come out to rescue us.”

“How to save him?” Han Xin asked again.

“Negotiate with him. Valley Master will definitely negotiate with Heavenly Sword Marquis, but we don’t know how to negotiate with him. We’ll wait in this tower.” Master Zhu Xin sighed, she did not feel good about it.

More than a thousand years ago, when she first saw Jian Wushuang in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, he was not even a saint. At that time, Jian Wushuang was just an ant, even worse than an ant, she did not take Jian Wushuang seriously at all.

However, in the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang had grown to such an extent. Moreover, when they met again, she was suppressed by him without any ability to fight back.

The contrast between them was so great that it was hard for him to accept for a moment.

On the other side, in the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, as what Master Zhu Xin had said, Valley Master Longyu and the top management of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley had already learned that Master Zhu Xin and Han Xin had been suppressed by Jian Wushuang.

“How dare he! How dare he suppress the elders of the valley!”

“How dare he? If he didn’t have the courage and courage, he wouldn’t have fought with the three Saint Realms. To be honest, he’s not even afraid of the three Saint Realm Masters, so he doesn’t care about the valley.”

“Suppressing the elders of the valley is no longer a challenge to the valley, but a declaration of war!”

The Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley’s highest-level Principles Masters were all extremely furious at this moment!
