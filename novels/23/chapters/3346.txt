Chapter 3348: Mission

Translator: EndlessFantasy TranslationEditor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Immediately?” Jian Wushuang frowned. “Lord Ba Cang, the Master True Eyes will only be imprisoned in the boundless prison for 100 years. There’s no need for another Principles Master to come, right?”

“If your patrol team is fine, there’s no need to be anxious. But now…Heavenly Sword Marquis, your patrol team will have a mission soon. Since there’s a mission, it’s natural to ensure the integrity of the patrol team,” Ba Cang said.

“There is a mission so soon?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

As far as he knew, the patrol team was responsible for fighting for the Temporal Temple. However, because the Temporal Temple was one of the three Freedom Alliances in the Divine Beginning Realm, it was an absolute overlord, and few people dared to provoke it, naturally, there was less competition.

Usually, the patrol team did not have too many things to do, and they would only go on missions occasionally.

Now that he had just taken over as the patrol inspector, he immediately had a mission. It could only be said that he was very lucky.

“Yes, there is a mission. Moreover, this mission is probably not easy, so I have asked the Sword Dragon Master to rush over as quickly as possible. He should be able to reach you in less than half a day. You can gather the patrol guards now and set off as soon as the Sword Dragon Master arrives,” Ba Cang

said.

“Where is the mission location?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s in the second heaven. As for the details of the mission, I’ll explain it to you later. You can gather the guards now,” Ba Cang instructed.

Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

As soon as Jian Wushuang gave the order, the experts of the patrol team gathered again.

The 100 Superior Saints and the nine Principles Masters soon arrived.

Sword Dragon Master was an ancient and powerful Principles Master. In terms of strength, he was considered very strong among the three void realms. He could take over the position of Master True Eyes, the combat strength of the patrol team did not weaken at all.

After Sword Dragon Master arrived, Jian Wushuang ordered everyone to head to the Second Heaven.

On the way to the Second Heaven, Ba Cang also told Jian Wushuang the details of the mission.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you are going to the Amethyst Fog Sea of the Second Heaven. Long ago, the Amethyst Fog Sea was the base of the Amethyst Demon Sect, the overlord of the Second Heaven. At its peak, the Amethyst Demon Sect was comparable to the Octagonal Heaven Sect of the Third Heaven,

or even stronger.”

“However, for some unknown reason, the Amethyst Demon Sect provoked the Flame Saint Realm, one of the three great Saint Realms. Under the leadership of the Flame Saint Master, the Amethyst Demon Sect was completely annihilated, and the entire sect was reduced to a wasteland. Almost all of the

experts of the Amethyst Demon Sect were killed. However, although the Amethyst Demon Sect was annihilated, the various resources and treasures that the Amethyst Demon Sect had accumulated over the years were not obtained by the Flame Saint Realm. Instead, they completely disappeared with the

destruction of the Amethyst Demon Sect.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Pausing for a while, Ba Cang continued, “There are rumors that the Amethyst Demon Sect’s many treasures were taken away by the surviving experts of the Amethyst Demon Sect. However, there are also rumors that the treasure of the Amethyst Demon Sect is hidden in the Amethyst Fog Sea. It’s just that

it’s too secretive, and no one has found it yet. Because of this rumor, experts often venture into the Amethyst Fog Sea in the Divine Beginning Realm to try their luck. However, they haven’t found much.”

“But not long ago, a few Immortal Saints from the Temporal Temple obtained a special token by chance. They recognized that it was related to the destroyed Amethyst Demon Sect, so they took it to the Amethyst Fog Sea. Unexpectedly, they found a secret realm hidden in the Amethyst Fog Sea!”

“Mystic realm of heaven and earth?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

The resources and wealth accumulated by the Amethyst Demon’s doctrine over a long period of time have never been found, and now the several Immortal Saints of the Temporal Temple have found a secret realm of heaven and Earth in the Amethyst Fog Sea through the keepsake, this secret realm of

heaven and earth! It’s probably where the treasure is!

“What happened after that? Did the Immortal Saints from the Temporal Temple enter the secret land of heaven and earth to investigate?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Not yet,” Ba Cang said. “Although they found the secret realm, it would take at least two or three Principles Masters to open it. They are just Immortal Saints, so how could they do that?”

“So they sent a message to the Temporal Temple at once. But when the temple was about to send Principles Masters to open the secret realm, the major force around the amethyst fog sea, Xiao Yao Mansion, got the news from God knows where. They sent a large number of experts and occupied the secret

realm. They also chased away the little guys from the Temporal Temple.”

“Xiao Yao Mansion? That name sounds familiar,” Jian Wushuang murmured, suddenly, his expression changed. “I remember. It’s Master Xiao Yao. He came from Xiao Yao Mansion, and I heard from Temple Master Bai Xing that Xiao Yao Mansion is a powerful overlord in the Second Heaven.”

“Yes, Xiao Yao Mansion is a top force in the entire Divine Beginning Realm. Since the Amethyst Demon Sect was destroyed, the territory around the Amethyst Fog Sea has been under its control. No one from the sects in the Second Heaven dares to provoke Xiao Yao Mansion, so it’s considered a great

overlord. However, Xiao Yao Mansion has offended the Temporal Temple this time. It’s not tactful,” Ba Cang said coldly.

Jian Wushuang also nodded secretly.

Although the carefree mansion was an overlord in the Second Heaven, it was nothing compared to the Temporal Temple.

Usually, the Temporal Temple kept a low profile and would not take the initiative to provoke other sects. However, it was not something that ordinary sects in the Divine Beginning Realm could easily provoke. For example, this time, the carefree mansion took the initiative to provoke the Temporal

Temple, it was indeed overestimating itself.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, the Immortal Saints of the Temporal Temple are waiting around the Amethyst Fog Sea. You will lead the patrol team to take back the secret realm of heaven and earth. If the people of the carefree mansion know what’s good for them, then let’s teach them a lesson. The Temporal

Temple is not a place that they can provoke,” Ba Cang said in a deep voice.

“Tsee.” Jian Wushuang understood.

The Temporal Temple did not seek hegemony, but it did not mean that it was easy to bully.

On the contrary, the Temporal Temple was never at a disadvantage. In the Blood Wave Realm, when Temple Master Bai Xing learned that the three Saint Realms had attacked Jian Wushuang, he immediately thought of ways to kill the Principles Masters of the three Saint Realms in the universe battlefield.

This time, the carefree mansion had become the target of the Temporal Temple.
