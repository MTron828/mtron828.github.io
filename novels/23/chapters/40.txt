Chapter 41: The Sword Essence

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Ping!”

A cold sword shadow, at a very tricky angle, stabbed directly toward the Golden Gibbon, which was more than two meters tall. Covered in greenish black scales, it dashed toward the shadow, using its giant arms that were notorious for their outrageous strength.

The moment that the sword shadow was smashed and scattered, another three sword lights flashed almost simultaneously…

It had already been six days since Jian Wushuang entered the Dark Forest. During his search in the Dark Forest over the past five days, he had undergone dozens of battles. Some of which were fiercely dangerous, especially when battling against spirit beasts in the Profound Transforming Sea Realm and the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm.

Compared to five days ago, his swordsmanship appeared much sharper and he had gained much more fighting experience.

Except for the one battle in the Gladiator Arena, Jian Wushuang had grown up training in Sword Marquis Mansion. He had no previous fighting experience with anyone before that. But now, his previous disadvantage in experience was being made up for.

“Clang!”

The fleeting and flickering shiny Sword Edge eluded the Golden Gibbon’s eyes, directly puncturing its throat with an amazing piercing force.

Rumbling… Its blood continued to spew out as its huge body instantly fell down.

“Great, that is the seventh spirit beast in the Profound Transforming Sea Realm that you have killed these last few days,” said Sima Bu, walking up with a smile. “Your Spiritual Power still needs to improve some more before it can reach the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm, but your swordsmanship has become more refined after several days of fighting.”

“I still have a long way to go,” said Jian Wushuang, shaking his head without any sense of pride. “I’m still far from having enough fighting experience. By virtue of my mastery in swordsmanship, I can now get rid of some inexperienced spirit beasts in the Profound Transforming Sea Realm. However, I have to flee instantly once I encounter stronger spirit beasts because I’m still unable to use my strength to the fullest.

“If only I were more experienced in battle and more adept at swordsmanship…” said Jian Wushuang, holding his hands tightly.

“Don’t aim too high. After all, you are not even in the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm, yet you already have such awesome battle strength,” said Sima Bu. Then he suddenly added, “These days, I’ve noticed that you’re highly gifted in swordsmanship, and I have something that might be useful to you. I am giving it to you for Ji Wuyue’s sake.”

Sima Bu immediately turned his right hand upward, unfolding a yellow wire-bound book.

“What?” said Jian Wushuang with a little surprise, then he stared at the gold ring that was always on the ring finger of Sima Bu’s right hand. “Is that an Interspatial Ring?” he asked suspiciously.

Just as its name suggested, an Interspatial Ring contained a separate space for holding things.

There was nothing else in his hand, but how did the book appear as he flipped his hand over? It went without saying that it must have been an Interspatial Ring.

“You’re right, it’s an Interspatial Ring,” said Sima Bu with a smile. “Presented by Gold-Dragon Palace, called the Gold-dragon Ring, and symbolizing the Gold-dragon Guard. If you’re interested in this and go there by any chance, you’ll be given a Gold-dragon Ring by Gold-Dragon Palace only after you complete the task to become a Gold-dragon Guard. ”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang became excited.

“Anyway, I obtained this book by chance. First, you should read it carefully, as you can benefit from what this expert in Sword Principles had learned. By the way, he is a Supreme expert in the Yin-Yang Void Realm,” said Sima Bu.

“Insight into Sword Principles from an expert? And left by a Supreme expert?” asked Jian Wushuang with a serious look.

The Seven Ranks of the Spirit Path, the Transcending Sea Realm, the Primordial Gold Core Realm, and the Yin-Yang Void Realm… Among these, the Primordial Gold Core Realm already linked to the strongest, the Yin-Yang Void Realm, and a Supreme expert, who was also rare in the whole Tianzong Dynasty.

Was it Sword Principle insights left by such a Supreme Expert?

Jian Wushuang immediately took the book and began to read it carefully.

It did not mention the name of the Supreme Expert, but it spoke of his insights in Sword Principle, as well as his views related to swordsmanship.

Sword Principle can be broken into two parts. Sword Arts, which are merely the form of swordsmanship, and Sword Essence, which is required for real swordsmanship. Combining both will give you insight into Sword Principle.

In fact, that book respectively introduced Sword Principle, starting with the Sword Arts chapter, then progressing to the second chapter, Sword Essence.

Jian Wushuang first absorbed the Sword Arts Chapter.

“If a swordsman depends on sophisticated, but formal and stiff, Sword Arts, there is no difference for him between normal and average Sword Arts. While an expert can easily surpass his rivals. Even if they are thousands of times stronger than him, as long as he is more adept at using his Sword Arts, and even if his Sword Arts are of a lower class.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The pages of the Sword Arts Chapter could be counted on one’s fingers. And all they spoke of was the common sense of Sword Principle. But what made the book different, lay in the fact that its creator seemed to despise all Sword Arts in the universe. He even held the belief that Sword Arts were insignificant to Sword Principle.

“This senior seems biased against Sword Arts. Admittedly, I do agree with his view on various Sword Arts, but not on his thoughts that Sword Arts mean nothing to a Warrior and can be ignored,” Jian Wushuang thought.

His training began with Sword Arts at an early age, and he believed that it very helpful to a Warrior.

After all, it was Sword Arts that had defeated Jian Meng’er and Ye Mo in the Sword Marquis Token Battle.

And, it was also Sword Arts that helped him battle spirit beasts of the Exceptional Transforming Sea Realm in the Dark Forest, even making it possible to kill those beasts in the end.

Without Sword Arts, he would, at most, have only been a match for spirit beasts at the Peak of the Profound Transforming Sea Realm by virtue of his unique Heavenly Creation Skill. Even then, it is uncertain who would have won.

Shaking his head secretly, Jian Wushuang turned his eyes to the Sword Essence Chapter instead of the Sword Arts Chapter.

“Sword Essence was divided into two sections as well. In one, Sword Principle was used to accompany and enhance one’s swordsmanship—Stronger swordsmanship means stronger Sword Essence.

“In the second section, Sword Essence was used to shape the Essences of Heaven and Earth through comprehension.

“There many Essences in the universe, including the immense Earth, raging flames, and the wind, everywhere in our lives… They are all part of the strength of the universe and nature. These Essences can be shaped by using one’s Sword Essence and greatly sharpening one’s swordsmanship through comprehension. Upon reaching a high enough level, any move with his sword can surpass both First-class Sword Arts and even Legendary Sword Arts.

“There are many different kinds of Sword Essence, such as the Sword Essence of Gale, the Sword Essence of Raging Fire, the Sword Essence of Earth, and Sword Essence of the Waterdrop…”

The contents of the Sword Essence Chapter were more sophisticated and detailed than the plain introduction in the Sword Arts Chapter. And, Jian Wushuang was totally immersed in its contents.
