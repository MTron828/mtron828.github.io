Chapter 2282 Soul!

Jian Wushuang cast his strongest trump card, Secret Skill of Star Palace.Once he had cast the third scripture of the Secret Skill of Star Palace, star power surrounded his body as his overall power skyrocketed by a thousand times!!

His power indeed increased by a thousand times. Of course, without the support of Emperor Thirteen’s blood essence, he could only use this power for a single attack.

However, this single attack was more than sufficient for Jian Wushuang.

“Get lost!”

Jian Wushuang roared as he swung his sword fiercely.

This sword formed a vast ocean of sword essence.

Under the frenzied assault of the ocean of sword essence, the white light that lit up the area covered in black mist disappeared.

The white spear that was headed for Jian Wushuang was also deflected.

“What?”

“No!”

The bald man and the woman in crimson clothes turned pale.

The bald man was especially shocked. He was a Master of the Holy Land. Within the area covered with black mist, the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth were much weaker and he could use the power of a Divine Demon. Under these circumstances, he attacked an expert in the Chaotic Realm.

No matter how unbelievable an expert in Chaotic Realm might be, the bald man though the expert would be stopped easily.

He had not taken Jian Wushuang seriously.

He had never expected that Jian Wushuang could deflect his attack head on.

After deflecting the white spear, Jian Wushuang did not stop at all. He continued chasing Leng Ruxue as he appeared behind her almost instantly.

Now it was impossible for even the two Masters of the Holy Land to stop him.

“Damn it!”

Leng Ruxue turned pale. She could see that Jian Wushuang had made a majestic mountain using the sword in his hand.

At the bottom of the mountain, there was a dark hole that had a large amounts of secret restrictions. The mountain was headed for her.

She had already cast Golden Flame thrice. With her current condition, there was no way she could do anything to resist Jian Wushuang.

She was about to be completely suppressed.

Suddenly...

“Jian Wushuang, look at this!!!”

Leng Ruxue turned around as a unique ball of light appeared out from her body.

This ball of light appeared in front of her and she held it tightly in her hands.

When Jian Wushuang saw the ball of light, his irises constricted. His actions stopped for a brief moment.

He stared at that ball of light.

He sensed a familiar aura that he had been dreaming of for a very long time.

A soul was within the ball of light!!

“Don’t you want the soul of your wife? I shall give it to you, catch.”

Leng Ruxue roared as she threw the ball of light into the space at the side. At the same time, a grey energy burst forth from her other palm, heading for the ball of light, trying to destroy it and the soul of Leng Ruxue.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang turned pale.

He forgot about suppressing Leng Ruxue as he dashed towards the ball of light, trying to catch it.

The moment he caught the ball, Jian Wushuang’s heart trembled slightly. He blocked the grey energy with his divine body.

Jian Wushuang stood there looking at the ball of light in his hands, sensing the soul within it.

It really was his wife’s soul.

“Rushuang, I have finally, finally found you!!” Jian Wushuang felt an excitement and joy like never before.

It was a pity that Leng Rushuang’s soul was in deep slumber. She could not detect Jian Wushuang’s presence and had no reaction at all.

Jian Wushuang was not worried. As long as he had Leng Rushuang’s soul, he could find a way to wake her up from her slumber. It would not be difficult for him to find her another body.

Under her veil, Leng Ruxue’s face was extremely cold as she looked at Jian Wushuang, who was overjoyed.

Unless absolutely necessary, she would never give Leng Rushuang’s soul up.

After all, Leng Ruxue and her had originally been one. They were still connected in many ways and had yet to completely separate from one another.

If Leng Rushuang’s soul were to die, or to leave her body, there would definitely be effects on her unique constitution and foundation.

This was why after so many years, Leng Ruxue had kept Leng Rushuang’s soul safe from all harm. When she broke through to the level of an almighty, Leng Rushuang’s consciousness evolved into a soul.

Leng Ruxue planned on returning to the Absolute Beginning Divine World to ask her master for help to cut the connection between her and Leng Rushuang. This way, removing her from her body would not have any negative effects on her anymore.

But now...

She had been forced by Jian Wushuang to break her connection with Leng Rushuang’s soul.

If she did not do this, she might be suppressed by Jian Wushuang.

If not, she would be at risk of being suppressed by Jian Wushuang.

Once she had been suppressed by Jian Wushuang, her life and death would be controlled by Jian Wushuang.

“Do you think both of you will have a happy ending when you rescue her soul? I won’t allow it,” Leng Ruxue said coldly. She turned to the two Masters of the Holy Land and said, “Lords, please kill him!!”

“I would have done it even without you asking.” The bald man wiped the smile off his own face. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The woman in crimson clothes also looked at Jian Wushuang coldly.

Jian Wushuang had almost managed to suppress Leng Ruxue due to their mistake.

They felt ashamed as Jian Wushuang had managed to suppress someone whom the both of them, as Masters of the Holy Land, wanted to protect.

Jian Wushuang’s actions angered both of the Masters of the Holy Land.

“Young one, you are too cheeky!”

The bald man looked at Jian Wushuang before dashing forward.

Jian Wushuang saw a flash of white light. Before he could react, the bald man appeared beside him.

“What kind of speed is this?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He knew that he achieved his goal by getting Leng Rushuang’s soul. He did not know if he could leave here safely.
