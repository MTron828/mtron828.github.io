Chapter 3552: Unforeseen Circumstances

A battle maniac who liked to fight immediately chased after him after hearing about him from the Red Nether Master. Of course, his purpose was to fight with him.

“Blood Sword Master, Red Nether has a high opinion of you. Don’t let me down,” said Xue Kong.

“I’ll try my best,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile. Then, his figure flashed. He appeared directly in front of Xue Kong. With the Blood Mountain Sword in hand, he slashed out with his sword. A brilliant blood-red sword light filled the air. This blood-red sword light carried an extremely violent aura.

It was the Peerless Sword Manual, Xi Xiang!

“Not bad. It’s indeed an advanced level six secret skill.”

Seeing Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship, Xue Kong was delighted. With a flip of his hand, a black stone stick appeared in his hand. This black stone stick looked ordinary, but the aura it emitted was extremely shocking, it was also a powerful advanced universe supreme treasure.

With the stone stick in his hand, Xue Kong waved it.

This swing seemed simple and did not have any fancy moves, but it was such a simple and direct stick skill, and it gave people a feeling of being unstoppable.

“Bang!”

The long stick hit the Blood Mountain Sword, and the explosive power suddenly burst out. Jian Wushuang’s body slightly shook, and then he immediately retreated.

“Blood Sword Master, I heard from Red Nether Master that you have a high-level offensive magic weapon. Take it out and don’t hide it,” said Xue Kong. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“As you wish.” Jian Wushuang did not hesitate and immediately changed to the Absolute Shadow Divine Sword.

With the Absolute Shadow Divine Sword in hand, the power of Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship instantly increased to a whole new level.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s figure turned into a ghost and flashed out like lightning. In the blink of an eye, he was engaged in a fierce battle with Xue Kong, and his swordsmanship was completely unleashed.

Xue Kong, on the other hand, had always looked relaxed and comfortable. He had only casually attacked Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship, but he had completely blocked it, it even caused a certain impact on Jian Wushuang’s power.

After dozens of collisions, Jian Wushuang’s expression had become serious.

“Just as the information said, this Xue Kong Master is much stronger than the Red Nether Master I met before,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

The Red Nether Master was only at an ordinary level among the Principles Masters of the preliminary six realms. The Xue Kong Master was also a Principles Master of the preliminary six realms, but his strength…he was definitely very strong among Principles Masters in the sixth realm. He was probably not far away from the advanced sixth realm.

Jian Wushuang could slightly suppress the Red Nether Master when he used his ultimate shadow sword in the battle with the Red Nether Master. But now, he also used his ultimate shadow sword and displayed the strongest power other than the heaven-cleaving skill, in the end, Xue Kong Master was still able to resist his sword skill.

Judging from Xue Kong Master’s relaxed look, it was obvious that he had not used all of his strength.

“Blood Sword Master, I heard from Red Nether Master that you have also created an absolute art at the peak of stage six. Can you show it to me?” Xue Kong Master said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and said in a cold voice, “In that case, you’d better watch carefully.”

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate at all. A powerful destructive will swept out.

Jian Wushuang also slashed out with his shadow-exterminating divine sword. A terrifying sword light that covered the heaven and earth, with a monstrous fighting will that would not give up, directly slashed toward Xue Kong.

“This sword.”

Seeing Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship, Xue Kong’s eyes flashed with a bright light.

“Haha, this is interesting.” Xue Kong was still laughing, and his aura suddenly soared. A layer of black air current swept up from his body, this black air current was formed after the power of the destruction principles had materialized.

Xue Kong was a Principles Master who had completely mastered the destruction principles. Moreover, his level of application and understanding of the destruction principles was frighteningly high.

The black airflow completely covered the long staff in his hand. The long staff shook slightly and then smashed out with a rumble.

Although this staff was only at the advanced stage of the sixth rank, the power of the staff shadow was definitely not weaker than Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship.

Bang!

A shocking boom.

The whole world seemed to be about to explode. The air wave formed by the crazy collision of the two attacks swept up crazily and lifted up a large number of gravel below.

However, at this moment, a sudden change occurred.

“Roar!”

A sudden angry roar suddenly sounded in the world.

On the black ground below, one of the ground directly caved in. Soon after, a huge creature climbed out from the ground.

This huge creature was over five meters tall. Its entire body was as black as ink, and its body was strange and strange. Its body was about the same size as its head, and on its huge head, which proved that it was incomparably huge…it had three eyes and a big bloody mouth, but it did not have a nose. It also had thick arms, four arms, and on one of its arms was a giant Silver Axe.

Such a monster suddenly emerged from the ground, and as soon as it appeared, a hair-raising violent aura filled the air.

“This is...” Seeing this huge monster suddenly emerge from the ground, Jian Wushuang’s expression changed drastically.

“Oh no, it’s a monster, a nine-curve monster unique to the Nine Twists Demon Cave!” Xue Kong was also shocked. He could no longer care about the outcome of the battle with Jian Wushuang and immediately retreated.

However, the monster emerged from the ground below them, and it happened to be the closest to Xue Kong. As soon as it appeared, the monster immediately pounced toward Xue Kong.

Although the monster was big, its speed was shockingly fast. It was even faster than the speed of an ordinary expert of the sixth realm. It pounced in front of Xue Kong almost instantly, at the same time, the four arms also returned to Xue Kong.

“Evil creature!”

Xue Kong was extremely shocked and furious. He immediately swung the stone rod in his hand and smashed it at the monster.

This hit blocked three of the monster’s arms, but there was still the best arm that could not block it. The last arm happened to be the one holding the giant Silver Axe. The giant Silver Axe swung out from the monster’s hand, without any hindrance, it directly hit Xue Kong’s body.

Hua la la! The true treasure armor on Xue Kong’s body was slashed with an extremely long white mark, and sparks flew in all directions.

Fortunately, he was protected by the true treasure armor, and the monster did not know how to use any axe techniques. It only relied on brute force, so the axe did not cause much damage to him. Without the true treasure armor, or the treasure armor level is not high enough, can not withstand this power, blood empty this time will definitely be seriously injured.
