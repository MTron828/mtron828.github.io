Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Blood Sword, show me your full strength. If I am satisfied with your strength, I may spare your life.” Nine Whiskers stood there and said indifferently.

“Spare my life? How arrogant.” Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Me too. If you disappoint me, you don’t have to leave here alive.”

“Haha, interesting.” A smile appeared on Nine Whiskers’s face.

He was an extremely arrogant person, and his strength was indeed outstanding. Because of this, he was arrogant and said that he would spare Jian Wushuang’s life, but he did not expect Jian Wushuang to be so arrogant.

It was obvious that both of them were eager to fight with stronger opponents. In this regard, they were very similar. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Without any more nonsense, Nine Whiskers had already made his move.

He slowly raised his right hand and pointed in Jian Wushuang’s direction.

This finger instantly formed a dazzling cyan light beam. The cyan light beam carried a destructive aura and directly shot toward Jian Wushuang through the void.

“Such powerful power.”

Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted when he saw Nine Whiskers’s attack.

Jian Wushuang had fought with several Rulers of the fourth level, including Star Ruler Mo Yun and Star Demon ancestor. He was very impressed, but now he could see it with just one glance, the terrifying power contained in Nine Whiskers’s finger.

In terms of divine power, Nine Whiskers had definitely reached the peak of the fourth level. He was at least much more powerful than Ruler Mo Chen, who was at the peak of the fourth level.

“I’m afraid that Nine Whiskers can crush most Rulers of the peak of the fourth level with just his brute force,” Jian Wushuang thought. However, his movements were not slow at all. With a flip of his hand, the Wuqi Divine Sword appeared in his hand.

Above the void, Jian Wushuang waved his sword.

The sword light swept across the galaxy, as if it was about to be cut in half.

The sword light collided with the green beam of light. The terrifying power burst out, but in the end, the sword light and the green beam were destroyed.

“Yes, although the power of divine power is only at the level of an ordinary fourth-level Ruler, your comprehension of the origin of the sword principle universe is indeed very high. What you are holding in your hand should be a Principle supreme treasure, right?” Nine Whiskers stared at the divine sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand.

“Nine Whiskers, where is your weapon?” Jian Wushuang stared at Nine Whiskers.

He knew very well that Nine Whiskers had just casually attacked with his finger, relying purely on the power of divine power.

“Haha, I, Nine Whiskers, have roamed the universe for several chaos cycles and challenged countless experts. Even a Ruler at the peak of the fourth level must have fought with thousands of people. However, there are very few who are worthy of my weapon. If you don’t have enough strength, you are not qualified to ask me to take out my weapon.” Nine Whiskers laughed heartily.

“How arrogant.” Jian Wushuang sneered.

However, Ruler Mo Chen, who was at the edge of the battlefield, knew clearly that Nine Whiskers was not arrogant, but he did have the right to do so.

When Nine Whiskers first came to the Purple Micro Galaxy, he defeated many top experts in the Purple Micro Galaxy with his brute strength and few of the pirate forces in the galaxy, at that time, Mr. Nine Whiskers was empty-handed and did not take out his weapon.

However, even if he did not take out his weapon, Nine Whiskers was still able to sweep through everything. For example, in the Nihility Star, Ruler Mo Chen had joined hands with his two brothers, but he easily defeated Mr. Nine Whiskers empty-handed.

It was precisely because Mr. Nine Whiskers was so ridiculously strong that Ruler Mo Chen thought Mr. Nine Whiskers had the ability to kill Jian Wushuang, so he specially invited Mr. Nine Whiskers.

“Humph, how much of your strength can you display without using your weapon?” Jian Wushuang snorted. He did not bother with Nine Whiskers. If he did not take out his weapon, he would attack with lightning speed.

In an instant, Jian Wushuang’s body split into three. Three figures charged toward Mr. Nine Whiskers from three different directions at the same time.

At the same time, the Wuqi Divine Sword in his hand burst out with a shocking sword essence! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Terrifying Sword Shadows attacked from three different directions at the same time.

Fast, incredibly fast!

Not only fast, but also extremely strange.

Although Mr. Nine Whiskers was extremely powerful and his soul perception was extremely sharp, he could not completely distinguish which of the three shadows was Jian Wushuang’s because in his eyes…the three shadows were exactly the same.

“It’s so fast to create three different illusions purely by relying on movement techniques. This movement technique is even more bizarre.” Nine Whiskers exclaimed, but he still did not show any intention of taking out his weapon. His body shook, green light rose from the sky, and he seemed to be bathing in a green ocean.

From the green ocean, terrifying green light beams shot out one after another.

Jian Wushuang relied on three figures to attack from three directions at the same time. However, the green ocean formed by Nine Whiskers was extremely vast. It could attack from all directions at the same time. Moreover, the green light beams that shot out were all extremely powerful, they were all extremely powerful.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The dense sounds of collisions were heard in the galaxy. Ruler Mo Chen, who was at the edge of the battlefield, was already terrified.

“It’s too powerful. This Blood Sword is too fast, too strange, and its swordsmanship is extremely powerful.”

“However, Mr. Nine Whiskers seems to be even more powerful. It’s obvious that he’s just casually attacking and hasn’t shown his true abilities. However, the cyan ocean formed by him is already terrifying enough.”

Ruler Mo Chen was a Ruler at the peak of the fourth level. However, he felt suffocated by the strength of either of the two who were fighting on the battlefield.

At this moment…

“Break!”

Jian Wushuang suddenly shouted. In the center of the battlefield, a shocking sword essence suddenly burst out.

The entire galaxy was completely covered by this shocking sword essence. Then, an extremely violent and monstrous sword light with endless sword principle universe origin slashed down directly.

The sword light directly cut into the cyan ocean formed by Nine Whiskers. Immediately, the entire cyan ocean rippled wildly, and the cyan light dissipated. A moment later, a cyan figure condensed in the void next to him.

“You actually defeated my move head-on. Your sword skill is really amazing.”

Nine Whiskers’s eyes emitted a layer of bright light as he stared at Jian Wushuang. There was a trace of excitement on the corner of his mouth. “Haha, Blood Sword, I admit that you are qualified to make me take out my weapon!”
