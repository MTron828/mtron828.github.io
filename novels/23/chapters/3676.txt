Chapter 3677: Shock and Awe

“Kid, you first forcefully woke me up from my deep sleep, and then I didn’t see you kneeling or bowing when I saw you. That’s fine, I didn’t want to argue with a junior like you for the sake of Xuan Yi, but now you actually want me to listen to your arrangements? What a joke.”

Xuan Yan’s eyebrows were cold.

“It seems that you are as self-righteous as your master Xuan Yi. However, Xuan Yi is dead and can’t discipline you. Today, I will discipline you on behalf of Xuan Yi.”

As soon as he finished his words, Xuan Yan’s body was immediately covered with large white flames. These white flames contained extremely terrifying temperature. The moment they rose, they immediately burned the void crazily, it caused the surrounding void to shatter.

The white flames were still spreading crazily and had already spread toward the void where Jian Wushuang was.

Upon seeing these white flames, the cultivators of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect all revealed a look of shock.

As for the so-called ‘Rulers’ in the Eternal Chaotic World, even the White Emperor’s face was pale at this moment.

The white flames were too terrifying in their eyes. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Even a little bit of it could easily burn them to ashes, not to mention the sea-like waves of flames.

However, in the face of the surging white flames, Jian Wushuang only smiled faintly.

“Destroy!”

A simple word was spat out, and in an instant, a terrifying power spread out.

This power was not only Jian Wushuang’s own power, but also contained the power of the will of heaven that he had gained after refining the Eternal Chaotic World.

Boom!

Under the impact of the power, the white flames that rushed toward him like a tide were instantly extinguished as if they had met their nemesis.

In the blink of an eye, the white flames had disappeared. The power that swept out from Jian Wushuang’s body filled the surrounding void and covered Xuan Yan’s entire body, although Xuan Yan was a Ruler Realm expert, he was in his current state. He had no room to resist the power.

He stood there and wanted to use his power. However, as soon as his power rose, it was mercilessly destroyed by the surrounding will power.

This scene made his face extremely ugly.

“Mr. Xuan Yan, you may not know this, but I was able to come back from the Divine Beginning Realm because I had completely refined this world and called it my Secret Realm. Even the will of the Heavenly Dao in this world has been controlled by me. Now, I am absolutely omnipotent in this world. Since you are in this world, you will naturally be bound by me.”

“In this world, I am the God. Even if your strength is at its peak, as long as you come here, I can still easily suppress you. I hope you can understand this,” Jian Wushuang said.

“You’ve completely refined this world and even refined it into your own Heaven and Earth Secret Realm?”

Even Xuan Yan was quite shocked when he heard this.

The experts of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect were also shocked.

Although this world was now called the Eternal Chaotic World, it was once the most prosperous Seven Star Divine Realm in the Divine Beginning Realm.

Jian Wushuang had actually refined the Seven Star Divine Realm into his own Secret Realm?

“It seems that I’ve underestimated you.” Xuan Yan narrowed his eyes and stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Don’t worry, Mr. Xuan Yan. As long as you follow my arrangements, I guarantee that you will be able to enter the Divine Beginning Realm smoothly and recover your strength to the peak in a short time,” Jian Wushuang said.

“What guarantee do you have?” Xuan Yan looked at him.

“It’s very simple.” Jian Wushuang smiled, then with a flip of his hand, a token appeared in his hand.

As a stream of divine power entered the token, a blurry figure slowly rose from it.

“Xuan Yan, Di Shisan, and everyone, long time no see.” A magnificent voice came from the blurry figure.

“Eh?” Xuan Yan was shocked when he saw the blurry figure clearly.

“Sect Master?”

The people of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect were shocked at first, but then they bowed in unison. “Greetings, Sect Master!”

“All of you, stand up.” The Xuan God waved his hand, and everyone from the Seven Star Mysterious Sect stood up.

“Xuan Yan, looking at your unconvinced face, could it be that you just fought with Heavenly Sword Marquis?” The Xuan God looked at Xuan Yan with interest.

Xuan Yan’s face darkened, and he did not answer.

Since he did not answer, he naturally tacitly agreed.

“Haha, you really fought with Heavenly Sword Marquis.” The Xuan God immediately laughed out loud, “Xuan Yan, I’m not the one who said that after so many years, your arrogant personality has not changed. You don’t know anything about the strength of young friend Heavenly Marquis, yet you dare to fight with him?”

“What do you mean?” Xuan Yan looked over.

“To tell you the truth, don’t look at young friend Heavenly Sword Marquis now as a Principles Masters, but he is the same as Xuan Yi back then. He is at the level of a perfect being. Although he is only a Principles Masters, his combat strength is not weaker than an ordinary Ruler. In addition, young friend Heavenly Sword Marquis has had some great fortuitous encounters over the years. His strength is already comparable to a high-level Ruler.”

“In the entire Divine Beginning Realm, other than Zhan Tian, who has the hope of fighting him to a draw, none of us Rulers are his match. And your strength is slightly weaker than mine. All these years, you’ve been sleeping in the Seven Star Divine Realm. I’m afraid that you have no chance to improve, not to mention that you’re still in a weakened state!”

“How dare you provoke my young friend, the Heavenly Sword Marquis? You are lucky that you are one of us. If it were anyone else, you would have died.” Xuan Yan smiled brightly.

Xuan Yan was stunned after hearing Xuan God’s words.

The people of the Seven Star Mysterious Sect looked at Jian Wushuang in shock.

Jian Wushuang had the battle strength of an advanced Ruler?

“Xuan Yan, is what you said true?” Xuan Yan was still in disbelief.

“Of course, why would I lie to you?” Xuan Yan sneered.

“That was before. Now that the Heavenly Sword Marquis has refined the Seven Star Divine Realm into his own Heaven and Earth Secret Realm and attracted the universal principles, he must have gained more benefits. His strength has already reached a higher level. Even I don’t know what level he has reached. But I’m sure that he is invincible in the Divine Beginning Realm. In the Seven Star Divine Realm, he is equivalent to the Heavenly Dao.”

“You actually dare to take the initiative to provoke him in this Seven Star Divine Realm. I don’t even know where you get your courage from.”
