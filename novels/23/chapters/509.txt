Chapter 510: Admiration

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“As I expected, my body is stronger than Qing Huo’s after I reached Level Four of the Bone Fusion Technique,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

Although Qing Huo had reached Level Five of the Bone Fusion Technique, Jian Wushuang already had a heaven-defying body before it was strengthened by the Bone Fusion Technique, so he was able to fight against Seven-cloud Realm experts from the Divine Land just by using body strength after he reached Level Four.

Qing Huo was inferior to the young man in body strength.

“Next, I’ll use 80 percent of my strength,” Jian Wushuang said with a gush of killing intent in his eyes. He charged forward once again.

Qing Huo swung his huge fist with his full strength and punched at the young man.

Peng!

This time, they were both forced to retreat.

“Come on!” Jian Wushuang said with a hint of excitement in his eyes.

He dashed forward and attacked with 90 percent of his strength.

Peng!

As for the third confrontation, Qing Huo retreated awkwardly. That meant Jian Wushuang had the upper hand.

“Master Qing Huo, you are unable to defeat me with only your body strength. Use your full power.” Jian Wushuang spoke confidently.

“Use my full power?” Qing Huo was intrigued and nodded. “OK, be careful.”

A Seven-cloud Realm aura suddenly swept out as a black longspear appeared in the Divine General’s hand.

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly as an overwhelming aura flowed out and radiated from him. His Triple-kill Sword also appeared in his hand.

Shua! Shua!

Two streaks of light flashed across the sky as they battled again.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

The fierce confrontation caused loud booms to reverberate through the entire Drill Ground as violent waves of power flowed outward.

It shook the entire tribe. Countless clansmen walked out of their tents to watch this fight.

“Uncle Qing Huo is fighting with the newcomer, Jian Wushuang.”

“How is that possible? Jian Wushuang is just a Saint Realm expert. How is he qualified to fight Uncle Qing Huo? He even seems to be holding the upper hand.”

“Master Qing Huo is losing ground?”

Those clansmen were dumbfounded when they saw that Qing Huo was at a disadvantage even though he was using his full power.

“Big Brother Wushuang is so powerful? My father is unable to beat him?” Qing Hu grasped his longspear while staring at them.

Wu Yu also widened her eyes and watched the fight.

Hua!

A brilliant streak of sword light rushed forward, carrying a decisive and unwavering intent. It was the second move of Heart-killing Sword Technique, Desperation!

Qing Huo instantly brandished his longspear and violently stabbed towards the incoming attack.

Clang!

The two strikes crashed, causing an immaterial wave to flow out. Qing Huo was beaten back once again.

“Stop, stop,” Qing Huo said with a wry smile.

He withdrew his longspear and stopped fighting.

Jian Wushuang followed him and landed on the ground.

“Wushuang, you’re very powerful. You have my admiration,” Qing Huo said, then sighed.

“Master Qing Huo, I appreciate your kindness.” Jian Wushuang responded modestly but he was delighted in his heart.

He gained a lot from this fight and also had a better understanding about the strength of Warriors from Monster Continent as well as his own. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Human Warriors from the Monster Continent really were more powerful than Warriors from the Divine Land.

Qing Huo was a Seven-cloud Realm expert, but his battle strength could be compared to Marquis Zizhong, who had reached the Eight-cloud Realm and had a Dao Weapon.

Although the longspear Qing Huo used was just a first-grade magic weapon, his body was stronger than Marquis Zizhong, so Qing Huo would be evenly matched with that marquis.

“My body strength improved greatly after I reached Level Four of the Bone Fusion Technique. I was able to gain ground just using my strength and swordsmanship, but there are more skills that I still haven’t displayed!”?Jian Wushuang thought.

Once he used the power of his Sword Soul, his strength would reach a new level, let alone his Asura Secret Skill, Realm techniques, and the Heart-killing Sword.

“I don’t?need to fear battling with an Eight-cloud Realm Divine General, even if it’s a real fight,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

“Wushuang, can I talk with you alone?” Qing Huo spoke.

Jian Wushuang nodded even though he did not know what Qing Huo wanted to discuss. “Sure.”

“Please!” Qing Huo and Jian Wushuang walked toward the tent.

After entering the tent, they both sat by a long narrow table. Qing Huo waved his hand and took out some wine and fruits.

Jian Wushuang poured himself a drink, then sniffed it and was about to drink.

“My little friend, if my guess is right, you don’t belong to our Monster Continent, right?” Qing Huo asked casually.

Jian Wushuang froze and looked over at the Divine General in astonishment.

Qing Huo guessed his origin so easily?

“Hey hey.” Qing Huo smile faintly. “You have a powerful body, but you had not practiced a Body Reshaping Technique before you came to our tribe, which is impossible for any Human Warrior from our continent.

“You’re not a Demonic Beast, but you can’t tell me about your circumstances. So I guessed that you must have come from outside of our continent.”

As a Divine General, Qing Huo had never been anywhere outside of the Monster Continent, but he had heard that there were other plane worlds out there.
