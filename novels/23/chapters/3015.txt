Chapter 3016: It Was Him!

——

The vast world was covered in a layer of faint gold due to the existence of the dragon imprisoning compass array.

In the void, sou! Sou! Sou! Sou!

Four figures sped past.

These four people were not fast. At the same time, they had released all of their soul power, clearly searching for something.

The four of them were the four experts from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom. Two of them were True Saints, while the other two were False Saints.

The four of them were chatting as they searched. As they conversed, there were some complaints.

“We have been searching like this for decades, but we haven’t found a single strand of hair on that person. From what I see, that person should have escaped from this region long ago.”

“I think so too. However, this is such a large territory, and so many people have been searching carefully. Even the 200,000 Magic Note Army has been dispatched. We’ve been searching for decades, but we still haven’t found him. That person is definitely not here.”

“Hehe, I heard that not long ago, someone in Blood Dipper City saw someone who had broken through to the level of an Immortal Saint. Moreover, because of the huge commotion and the divine might he emitted, they thought that the Immortal Saint who had just broken through was the person we’ve been looking for all this time?”

“How is that possible? We are looking for an existence with tyrannical strength that can match a third-level True Saint. How could he have just broken through to the level of an Immortal Saint? It’s fine if these people can’t be found, but why are they looking for excuses?”

“Who says so? Sigh, we don’t know when the search will end like this.”

The few of them chatted casually, and they were clearly dissatisfied in their hearts.

“Alright, all of you shut up!”

A low shout suddenly sounded. The person who spoke was a cold and arrogant middle-aged man who was walking at the front.

This cold and arrogant middle-aged man was a rank one peak stage True Saint. He was the strongest among the four, so his status was naturally the highest.

“Seal off this area and order us to search every corner. It’s Lord Wu. Furthermore, he believes that the Immortal Saint who has just broken through is the person we are looking for. It’s also Lord Wu. Do you have the guts to question Lord Wu’s orders?” The cold and arrogant middle-aged man glanced at the three people behind him.

The three of them jumped in fright and did not dare to say another word. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, other than the king, only the gold and silver kings would dare to ignore Lord Wu. Only the others held great respect for Lord Wu, and the few of them were no exception.

After berating him, the cold and arrogant middle-aged man’s voice softened. “Speak less. Actually, compared to the Magic Note Army and those who have been searching underground, the four of us are already considered rather lucky. Be content.”

Hearing this, the three people behind nodded in unison.

Indeed, although they had been searching for decades, they were still searching above the ground, so it was easy and fast for them to use their soul power to search.

But searching underground was different.

They needed to use their soul power to store and search, and they needed to maintain their soul concentration. It was fine for a short period of time, but for decades, it was torture.

Compared to those people who were investigating underground, they were indeed lucky.

At this moment…

“Huh?”

The cold and arrogant middle-aged man suddenly raised his head and looked forward. “There is someone in front, and judging from his aura, it seems to be an Immortal Saint?”

“Immortal Saint?” The three people behind were startled, and immediately spread their soul power over.

“He is indeed an Immortal Saint. Moreover, his aura is quite unfamiliar. Who could it be?”

The four of them were puzzled as they continued to fly forward.

Soon, they saw an ice-cold figure at the end of their line of sight.

He was wearing a black robe and a gray mask. He stood coldly in the air. The Aura that he emitted was dark and extremely cold.

“This, this person…”

When they saw the gray-robed figure in their line of sight, the four Immortal Saints of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, including the cold and arrogant middle-aged man, were shocked.

Gray robe, gray mask. This was the unique attire of the members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance!

In this completely sealed area, there was a person who emitted the aura of a True Saint, wore a gray robe, and wore a gray mask?

Without a doubt, this person before them was the person they had been trying so hard to find for decades.

“It’s him! He’s the one we’re looking for!”

The expressions of the cold and arrogant middle-aged man and the other two became exceptionally interesting.

“Quick, quickly send a message to Lord Wu. Tell him that we’ve found him!” The cold and arrogant middle-aged man shouted.

The True Saint behind him did not hesitate at all and immediately took out a token to send a message.

In just a moment, the message had been sent out.

“Is the message finished?”

A cold voice suddenly sounded.

The cold and arrogant middle-aged man and the other two men were shocked. They looked at Jian Wushuang in astonishment.

“How is it possible? He was at the end of our line of sight just a moment ago. How could he be in front of us in just a moment?” The cold and arrogant middle-aged man’s body was shaking crazily. “How fast is he?”

“Let me ask you, has the message been sent out?” Jian Wushuang’s cold voice sounded again.

“Yes, it has been sent out,” The arrogant middle-aged man said subconsciously.

“Very good.” Jian Wushuang suddenly smiled. His smile was very sincere because the arrogant middle-aged man and the others had already helped him do what he wanted to do.

“Since the message has been sent out, then you guys are useless. Die,” Jian Wushuang said faintly. His body swayed strangely, and immediately, streaks of silver light burst out.

The arrogant middle-aged man and the other three were still standing there, unable to react in time.

Chi! Chi! Chi! Chi!

Four sounds rang out at the same time. The protective armor on their bodies had been cut open, and the blade had entered their divine bodies.

The two False Saints among the four were the first to die.

As for the two True Saints, although they had mastered the immortal body, Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword was coated with the god-burning poison. After consuming only five drops of the god-burning poison, the two True Saints died instantly.

In the void, Jian Wushuang put the treasures left by the four into his interspatial ring with a flip of his hand, but he did not leave directly. Instead, he stood there and waited quietly.

“Since the four of them have already spread the news, the experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom will come here as soon as possible. I’ll wait for them here.” Jian Wushuang smiled, but under the mask, there was a hint of expectation.

In order to break through, he had to flee and hide in the face of so many experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom.

But now, with his breakthrough to the Immortal Saint realm and the increase in his strength, he was looking forward to meeting the experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom.

“I hope they won’t disappoint me!”
