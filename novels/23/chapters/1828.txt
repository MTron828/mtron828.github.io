Chapter 1829: Deluge Fortress

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Not long after Jian Wushuang killed Emperor God Jin Ming and Emperor God Fan Yuan, Sir God Xuan Bing and Sir God Qian Ren announced to the world that they had joined the Soaring Heaven King Palace!

In no time, the Sanctuary Alliance was in an uproar again.

Jian Wushuang also caught wind of the information immediately.

“They have actually gone and sought refuge with the Soaring Heaven King Palace?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

Sir God Xuan Bing and Sir God Qian Ren were the experts in his name list. Before Jian Wushuang could find them, they had quickly found someone to back them up.

In actual fact, it was not just those two Sir Gods. There were also the remaining experts in the name list as well as some experts who were not in the name list but who had a huge grudge with the Lineage of Star. After they became aware of Jian Wushuang’s crazy massacre, they knew that they were in danger and they naturally thought of ways to protect themselves.

“Palace Master, you do not need to go to the Holy Kingdom of White Fog anymore. The Vientiane Tower has just spread news that the Sir God who stayed near the Holy Kingdom of White Fog has already left,” Hall Master Yuan messaged.

“Left? Did the Vientiane Tower find out where he has gone?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“They have found out about it. This Sir God has gone to the Abysmal Sanctuary and it’s not just him. Quite a number of the Sir Gods in the name list that I have given you have also gone there,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“The Abysmal Sanctuary?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

The Abysmal Sanctuary was one of the Ten Sanctuaries and it was very close to the Lineage of Star. At this stage, why had those experts gone to the Abysmal Sanctuary?

“Could it be that they want to come together and fight the Lineage of Star head-on?” Jian Wushuang asked in a cold voice.

“That looks to be what is going on. Moreover, the Vientiane Tower has also found out that these people have gone to the Deluge Fortress,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“The Deluge Fortress? Fortress Master Hong Tian?” Jian Wushuang’s expression turned grave.

The Abysmal Sanctuary was within the Ten Sanctuaries and there were many peak powerhouses as well as experts who travelled alone in it.

As for the Deluge Fortress, it was neither a powerhouse nor a sect. Instead, it was a place where an expert who travelled alone lived. However, the Deluge Fortress had a huge reputation in the Abysmal Sanctuary as well as the whole Eternal Chaotic World.

Fortress Master Hong Tian, the founder of the Deluge Fortress, was ranked thirty-sixth on the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list and he was a genuine Emperor God who stood at the top!

It should be known that the Star Palace Master was ranked thirty-first on the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. Hence, Fortress Master Hong Tian was extremely close to the Star Palace Master.

“Could it be that Fortress Master Hong Tian has a grudge against the Lineage of Star as well?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

“That’s right,” Hall Master Yuan nodded his head earnestly. “However, Fortress Master Hong Tian does not have a grudge against the Lineage of Star. Instead, he has a grudge against the Star Palace Master. I have heard that Fortress Master Hong Tian has fought a close quarter battle with the Star Palace Master twice and every close quarter battle was extremely intense. However, as their abilities are not too not far away from each other, there has never been an outcome.”

“If this is the case, why did you not place Fortress Master Hong Tian on the name list?” Jian Wushuang asked with a frown.

“Palace Master, Fortress Master Hong Tian is a Peak Emperor God. Even with the Star Palace Master alive, it is still impossible to kill him. Hence…” Hall Master Yuan had not finished talking yet.

However, Jian Wushuang had already understood.

The sixteen experts on the name list that Hall Master Yuan had given him were all experts who travelled alone. Moreover, they were experts who Jian Wushuang could kill.

However, experts which would involve those big powerhouses, as well as Peak Emperor Gods like Fortress Master Hong Tian, were not included on the name list.

After all, be it the experts of those big powerhouses or Peak Emperor Gods, none of them could be killed easily.

“Looking at it now, Fortress Master Hong Tian probably wants to gather those experts who have a grudge against the Lineage of Star. After that, they will team up and go against our Lineage of Star,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Go against us? Them alone?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with coldness.

For the remaining experts on the name list, apart from a small number of them joining some big powerhouses, the rest of them had gone to the Deluge Fortress. With that, Jian Wushuang had no way to continue his massacre and he returned to the Lineage of Star at once.

…

Abysmal Sanctuary, Deluge Fortress.

In a vast palace, there were more than ten thrones standing tall and upright. At the same time, there was a total of twelve people.

Among the twelve people, a good number of them were people on Jian Wushuang’s name list. As for the remaining people, although they were not on the name list, they had a grudge against the Lineage of Star as well.

For example, on a throne, there was a purple-robed old man who was three meters tall… Jiu Gong.

“Jiu Gong, long time no see. You have actually made a breakthrough already. Congratulations,” a Sir God beside him laughed.

“Real God Jiu Gong. No, now you should be called Sir God Jiu Gong. The Jiu Gong Holy Kingdom under you is not too far away from the Ten Sanctuaries. Even so, during Jian Wushuang’s massacre, he actually did not look for you. Your luck is really not too bad,” some other people said.

Jiu Gong’s expression changed slightly and he said: “Jian Wushuang’s targets are obviously Almighties. As for Real Gods who have grudges against the Lineage of Star, they are massacred by the two other Sir Gods of the Lineage of Star wantonly. Although I have already made a breakthrough, this news remained confidential and no one knew about it. With this, I was able to remain alive.”

As Sir God Jiu Gong spoke about that, he was really glad. He was glad that the news of his breakthrough was not made public.

If not, the name list that Jian Wushuang had would probably have had his name on it as well. With the massacre, he would probably be dead already.

“Hmph, that Jian Wushuang, a junior who has trained for merely tens of thousands of years, actually forced us to such a stage!”

“Not only is he just a junior, he is also a Real God. A Real God-level Inverse Cultivator.”

“Even as a Real God, he is already so frightening. If he were to make a breakthrough and become an Almighty in the future, he would definitely have the fighting capabilities of a Great Emperor.”

“According to Jian Wushuang’s personality, since he has already taken action, he will definitely want to kill all of us. If we are unable to take action in time to kill him and he makes a breakthrough to Almighty in the future, then we can only escape to the remote regions in the Eternal Chaotic World and hide ourselves for life.”

“This Jian Wushuang must absolutely be killed!”

In the palace, a clamorous voice.

Just then, buzz~~~ A figure came into shape slowly on the throne at the highest point of the palace.

It was a hale, bald-headed old man. His deep eyes then looked around the area.

“Greetings to Fortress Master Hong Tian.”

When the twelve Almighties below saw the person who had come, all of them stood up and greeted him.

“Please take a seat,” Fortress Master Hong Tian waved his hands and the Almighties sat down again. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Fortress Master Hong Tian said loudly: “All of you should know my motive for gathering you here this time around. The Lineage of Star has been threatening us and it obviously wants to kill all those people who have once made enemies with them. To date, quite a number of Sir Gods as well as two Emperor Gods have already died in Jian Wushuang’s hands. Moreover, the Lineage of Star’s Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Shi Yun have also taken action personally to kill quite a number of Real Gods.”

“At this stage, if all of us were to not team up, we would be killed by the Lineage of Star one by one. By then, even I would be worried about my life.”
