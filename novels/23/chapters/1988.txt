Chapter 1989 Sword Geek

“Losers are always in the wrong?”

Sir God Xue Dao trembled and he couldn’t help but lower his head. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He lifted his head at the next moment but then he shouted hysterically, “Jian Wushuang, you are great, but don’t get too carried away. I am going to die at your hand. But in no time, you will absolutely die at another person’s hand!!!”

“It is only a matter of time. You will have to die!!”

Sir God Xue Dao was frenzied.

Jian Wushuang saw and shook his head. There was sympathy in his eyes, “Don’t worry, I won’t torture you. Go in peace.”

Jian Wushuang said and then pointed casually. There was a ray of light that pierced Sir God Xue Dao’s head straight away.

Sir God Xue Dao died on the spot.

Jian Wushuang’s face turned cold at the sight.

“Maybe you are right. It is only a matter of time until I die by someone else’s hand. However, as long as the day has yet to come, I will try my best to improve my power, I will try my best to protect everything around me,” Jian Wushuang muttered and there was determination in his eyes.

Just then…

Vroom!!

There was a loud whistle from the sword.

Jian Wushuang immediately looked at Blood Mountain Sword on his back and he realized that Blood Mountain Sword was quivering vigorously.

Jian Wushuang was connected to Blood Mountain Sword at heart. At that very moment, he could feel how excited Blood Mountain Sword was.

It was definitely because something impressive had appeared.

“What happened?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows, “Ever since I received Blood Mountain Sword from my master, this is the first time Blood Mountain Sword is acting this excited. It isn’t even a fierce fight but it got excited without showing any sign. If I’m not mistaken, it should have sensed the existence of something.”

Jian Wushuang thought for a while, then he took out a token to ask.

Very soon, he found out the reason behind it.

Earlier, when had he killed Sir God Xue Dao, there had been an ancient cave dwelling that had come into the world in the nearby ancient battlefield.

In the ancient battlefield, there was a variety of opportunities.

There were naturally many cave dwellings that had been left behind by experts from ancient times.

In the three thousand years that Jian Wushuang had cultivated in seclusion, more than a dozen of cave dwellings were discovered in the ancient battlefield.

Every time an ancient cave dwelling came into the world, it would stir up a fight among the experts. However, the opportunities in the cave dwellings, some were taken away but most of them remained in the ancient cave dwellings. It wasn’t because the experts from Eternal Chaotic World didn’t want the opportunities, but because they couldn’t get them.

The ancient cave dwellings contained a test. The tests were mostly very strict and no one could pass them. Hence, the opportunities that came along with the tests were naturally untouched.

In the ancient cave dwellings that had just come into the world, there were a few experts that had actually gone in by accident previously and obtained some opportunities. However, as the opportunities were taken, the cave dwelling finally came into the world and it stirred up a shocking commotion.

Especially towards Sword Principle cultivators.

When the ancient cave dwelling came into the world, not only Jian Wushuang, but also all sword experts who were wandering on the ancient battlefield, their divine weapon sensed it and naturally notified their masters.

“Jiu Jue Sword Mansion ? The ancient cave dwelling is named as Jiu Jue Sword Mansion?”

Jian Wushuang went through the information that he had just obtained from Sanctuary Alliance.

The first batch of experts who found the ancient cave dwelling naturally had a basic understanding of the ancient cave dwelling. They knew the origins of the cave dwelling and they also knew the opportunities within.

Jiu Jue Sword Mansion contained boundless variations of Sword Principles.

The Sword Principles were stored on nine sword steles in a peculiar way. The nine sword steles contained Jiu Jue Sword Mansion’s biggest opportunity.

However, the nine sword steles were scattered in nine corners of Jiu Jue Sword Mansion. It wouldn’t be that easy to get them. In the beginning, the experts who discovered Jiu Jue Sword Mansion had found a sword stele by accident. Hence, it had led to the birth of Jiu Jue Sword Mansion.

“It is obvious that Jiu Jue Sword Mansion is aimed at sword cultivators. The nine sword steles contained a large amount of Sword Principles. These Sword Principles are all from ancient times,” Jian Wushuang licked his lips and he was obviously tempted.

His power had reached such a level. Although he could rely on himself to create a sword unique skill that was powerful, it was limited. Compared to the shocking sword principle from ancient times, his unique skills were inferior.

Hence, if he were to master a few Sword Principles from ancient times, it would absolutely raise the power of a sword cultivator.

Just like the number sword cultivator in the first era, Sword Emperor Dugu!

Although he was gifted with Sword Principle and he had created a Sword Principle that was suitable for him, his biggest trump card was still King Sword Principle!!

It was his true power that swept all obstacles away and enabled him to march over the first era unhindered.

King Sword Principle originated from ancient times.

Although Jian Wushuang had already mastered the Sword Principle, it wasn’t easy to perform it. On top of that, he had only mastered the first move. So, he could only use it as his trump card. The Sword Principle from Sword Mansion Jiu Jue was different.

The nine sword steles… combined large amounts of Sword Principle from ancient times. Every sword stele contained a large amount of ancient Sword Principle.

To Jian Wushuang, it was extremely attractive.

“Jian Yi,” Jian Wushuang called.

“Master,” Jian Yi’s figure appeared next to Jian Wushuang.

“Have you heard of a sword expert named Jiu Jue from ancient times?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Jiu Jue? Sword Geek Jiu Jue?” Jian Yi looked surprised.

“It seems like you heard of him. Tell me about him,” Jian Wushuang was interested.

“Master, I have heard of Jiu Jue. Among solo experts in ancient times, he was considered as a top-grade sword expert. Unless it was necessary, the top forces in ancient times wouldn’t offend such an expert casually. Besides, Jiu Jue was known as Sword Geek!”

“He truly was geeking out over swords!”

“He was passionate about gathering sword principles and he wasn’t interested in ordinary sword principles, only in sword principles that were exquisite and brilliant. For that, he often challenged the sword experts in ancient times. When he challenged them, he liked to bet with rare sword principle books. If his opponents lost, they had to hand him their strongest sword principles. Over the years, he collected many powerful sword principles.”

“That is also the story of how got his name, Sword Geek. In ancient times, he might have been the one who was proficient in the most sword principles. Many sword experts who were more powerful than him didn’t know as many sword principles as he did.”
