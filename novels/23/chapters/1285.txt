Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After the Lord of Dayu Palace and Wu Cang had retrieved the Blaze Quicksand Gourd, they left quickly.

“Jian Wushuang, this is your Guest Token. With this token, you can access most of the cultivating resources. I will arrange a residence for you. Please enjoy cultivating in the following days.” The white-clothed Universe God said as he handed a Guest Token to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took it.

The identity of Dayu Palace’s guest was important in Dayu World.

“Jian Wushuang, enjoy your cultivation in Dayu Palace. I have to go. See you.” The Lord of Scarlet Island said to him.

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang nodded. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Lord of Scarlet Island left too.

“I will show you around and take you to your residence. Let’s go.”

The white-clothed Universe God began to show Jian Wushuang around.

Dayu Palace was extremely large. It had a lot of places for trial and also Treasure Pavilions.

Inside the Treasure Pavilion, there were countless treasures and manuals.

Jian Wushang visited these places under the guide of the white-clothed Universe God. Because he was a guest, he had access to some cultivating resources in the Palace.

The white-clothed Universe God showed Jian Wushuang around for a long time. Finally, they came to Jian Wushang’s residence. It was a large yard in the middle of a mountain.

“You can start your cultivation, Jian Wushuang. Contact me directly if you have any questions. Eighty years later, I will inform you in advance if our master is about to give a lesson.”

“Thanks a lot.” Jian Wushuang said gratefully.

As a senior Universe God in Dayu Palace, the white-clothed Universe God had started following the Lord of Dayu Palace long ago. In a way, the lord trusted no one more than him.

The Lord of Dayu Palace had little time to handle the affair, so the white-clothed Universe God was responsible for them.

Having seen him off, Jian Wushuang began to make a plan for his eighty-year cultivation.

He intended to make good use of the rich cultivating resources in Dayu Palace.

Eighty years seemed short, but it was enough for Jian Wushuang to improve his strength to a new level.

Poof! A figure suddenly appeared in the yard where Jian Wushuang lived.

It turned out to be a scarlet-robed young lady who was beautiful and valiant. Her aura spread quickly the moment she appeared.

“Hi! Who are you?” Jian Wushuang asked in puzzlement as he came to her.

“I am Su Dan, an inner disciple from Dayu Palace.” Her eyes sparkled with battle intent, “You must be Jian Wushuang. I’ve heard of you. Not so long ago, you killed Zhuge Qiu from Holy Prefecture head-on. The elders of our Palace, including the white-clothed Universe God, felt amazed. They called you a true genius. They believed you were comparable to Universe God Qingyang from Holy Prefecture. Maybe you are even stronger than him!”

“Now that you are in our palace, I want to take this chance to battle you. Are you ready for it?”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang chuckled. He finally understood that Su Dan meant to challenge him.

“I’m ready.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Well, this is good. There it is!” A glimmer of excitement flashed in Su Dan’s eyes. Suddenly a jet-black long staff appeared in her hand.

Bang!

As a vast aura surged from Su Dan, she immediately attacked.

Su Dan was confident in her strength. She was a Universe God at the First Realm who had gone through the first God Test. Although she was at the elementary level, her Staff Technique was extremely aggressive, enabling her to confront an ordinary advanced Universe God at the First Realm.

However, she was far less stronger than Jian Wushuang.

In an instant, her jet-black long staff was hit away.

“You lost.”

With the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand, Jian Wushuang stood before Su Dan with a smile.

It took Su Dan a long time to calm down. She looked back at him and said, “When I heard you killed an advanced Universe God at the First Realm as a Universe Master, I thought it was merely by chance. But now I know I’m wrong.”

“My strength is worse than you indeed, but don’t get cocky. I rank last among all the inner disciples. A lot of people are stronger than me. What’s more… I come to challenge you because I met the white-clothed Universe God just now. I’m the first one to challenge you!”

“In the span of a few days, the news that you live here will spread throughout the inner palace, even the whole Dayu Palace. So many disciples of my inner palace have already heard of you and Universe God Qingyang. I’m sure they will come to challenge you one after another!”

“Jian Wushuang, a great many disciples in our palace are powerful. Not to mention there are ten peak Universe Gods at the First Realm. Things are gonna get much harder for you!”

Su Dan glanced at him mercifully and left. Jian Wushuang stayed where he was, confused.

“The inner disciples will come to challenge me one after another?” Jian Wushuang felt strange but soon understood.

The disciples of Dayu Palace, particularly the inner disciples, are geniuses with talents. Because Dayu Palace enjoyed a high status in Dayu World, it was rare for them to be evenly matched.

As strong as these inner disciples were, they were never famous in Dayu World.

Jian Wushuang did not hear of any geniuses in Dayu Palace. Instead, he and Universe God Qingyang from Holy Prefecture gained much fame in Dayu World. So these talented inner disciples became defiant.

Since Jian Wushuang arrived at Dayu Palace and lived there, they would certainly be able to have a chance.

It was normal for them to challenge him one after another.

“Dayu Palace was acknowledged as the top palace in Dayu World. It has much more powerful experts than the three overlords. Besides, a group of talented disciples gathers in the inner palace. There are lots of strong Universe Gods at the First Realm. There are even 10 peak Universe Gods at the First Realm!” Jian Wushuang said, becoming excited.

“Come on, come to challenge me!”

“The more the better!”

“The stronger the better!”

“I’m ready!”
