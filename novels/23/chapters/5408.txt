Chapter 5407 ¬†Exposed

In the realm of the Origin Source Dao, Kun Tai was just an ordinary tier 5 Emperor, and his spatial origin was nothing special compared to Jian Wushuang. It was solely due to the Eternal Treasure that his combat strength reached the top level of the fifth tier.

Faced with the purple spear emanating thunder, Jian Wushuang didn't dare to block it. The power was too overwhelming; even a slight touch could lead to his demise.

The divine body was diminishing rapidly, now less than twenty thousand times its original size. Against the Eternal Treasure, this divine body was insufficient, forcing his avatar to step forward and face certain death.

The spear pierced through Jian Wushuang's avatar as if it were tofu, unable to offer any resistance.

Heaven's Punishment!

Before the avatar shattered completely, a towering giant sword emerged from the depths of the sea, intercepting the spear.

Kun Tai was stunned! He hadn't expected that the tier 4 Emperor before him could withstand the Eternal Treasure. This was beyond his expectations.

Seizing the still-vibrating spear, he easily broke through the Heaven's Punishment Sword Strike with a casual move.

However, this delay allowed Gong Miaoyi to escape a considerable distance.

"What?"

Kun Tai was astonished. Even his Thunderous Space was broken. Without caring about anything else, Gong Miaoyi and Bai Junwang fled with urgency.

Purple thunder, bound by blood-red lines, twisted like serpents.

"Eternal Treasure?"

"A top-level Eternal Treasure!" Luo Chuan, observing from a distance, exclaimed.

¬†His knowledge was extensive, having witnessed his master use a top-level Eternal Treasure in the past.

Typically, only tier 6 Emperors possessed such high-quality Eternal Treasures!

Obtaining an Eternal Treasure is not an easy feat for an ordinary tier 5 Emperor without a background.

Warriors like Kun Tai, after years of countless battles and significant achievements, were granted an Eternal Treasure.

The Eternal Treasures used by regular tier 5 Emperors are usually of common quality.

Higher-grade Eternal Treasures are not available for sale; even in auctions like those held by the Heavenly Court, they rarely make an appearance.

And if they do, their prices are exorbitant.

Not to mention the top-tier Eternal Treasures, which are seldom possessed by tier 6 Emperors.

The appearance of such treasures often leads to clashes among tier 6 veterans eager to seize them.

At such times, tier 5 Emperors become inconspicuous.

Not only did Kun Tai covet this opportunity, but at this moment, Luo Chuan also cast aside everything.

He unleashed 12-fold strength, swiftly maneuvered, and headed straight for Gong Miaoyi and Bai Junwang.

He didn't spare a glance for Jian Wushuang.

Revenge could wait; opportunities like these were rare. If not seized now, one might regret it for a lifetime.

As Kun Tai had said to Luo Chuan, what they didn't possess, they had to strive to obtain. Right now, it required giving it their all, and with maximum effort, success was within reach.

Two tier 4 peak-level Emperors couldn't stop him.

The exquisite Eternal Treasure was within easy reach.

"What a fool!" Jian Wushuang gritted his teeth, eager to unleash a barrage of curses.

That purple thunder didn't even require the use of an Eternal Treasure; couldn't they just fly out slowly? Why go to the extent of using the Bloodfall Crystal to rupture the space?

Now things were different.

Targeted by that tier 5 Emperor, Jian Wushuang was in no immediate danger.

However, Gong Miaoyi was the most significant gain of this journey and couldn't be abandoned.

Boom!

Nine Heaven's Punishment swords surged from the depths of the sea, directly blocking Kun Tai's path.

Facing the Heaven's Punishment swords, Kun Tai erupted in fury.

He hadn't expected Jian Wushuang to dare to intervene. If he wasn't hindered, Jian Wushuang could have escaped.

Jian Wushuang sneered and said, "You want to leave without killing me?"

As he spoke, a myriad of sword illusions emerged behind him.

Supreme Technique Formation!

Immortal Trap Trial.

The current Immortal Trap Formation was no longer considered basic. Jian Wushuang had improved it significantly from start to finish, making it quite usable.

Having the strength of an Emperor, he had not focused much on cultivating sword techniques. He hadn't created any sword-related Ultimate Supreme Techniques himself.

The Ultimate Supreme Techniques, the seventh level of the Sword Dao, the Heaven's Punishment Sword, though at its peak, had a power that, among Emperors, could only be considered average.

Eliminating some tier 4 opponents was challenging.

Now, his divine body and physical form were more potent than his sword techniques. However, facing a tier 5 Emperor, he didn't dare to engage in close combat.

With his divine body currently unstable, he feared it might not withstand a close-range attack.

This Immortal Entanglement Formation was suitable for dealing with a tier 5 Emperor. It could trap the opponent, buying time for Gong Miaoyi and Bai Junwang.

The phantom swords filled the sky, forming countless trails.

9.8 million!

Each sword could annihilate an Emperor.

This was the limit of the Ultimate Dao.

"Go!" Jian Wushuang pointed his finger, shouting, "Immortal Trap!"

9.8 million swords erupted with unparalleled Sword Qi, gradually forming a hexagonal, 88-sided sword formation, trapping Kun Tai within. The Sword Qi inside boiled, but harming Kun Tai was still improbable.

The upper limit was there. The seventh layer of the Ultimate Dao could be combined, but the power was limited.

Critical was that he didn't combine Dao.

A singular Sword Dao, reaching this level during the Dao Lord realm, was already the limit.

Even Hu Qing, coming down from the Grave God Mountain, would find it challenging to kill a tier 4 Emperor, not to mention confronting a tier 5 one.

This Immortal Trap Formation could easily strangle a tier 4 Emperor.

As Dao Lord advanced to this level, even Qishen would have to show off.

Unfortunately, good times didn't last!

The opponent was, after all, a tier 5 Emperor.

With a roar, Kun Tai raised his single hand, and a purple thunder burst from his palm, directly splitting the vast sea millions of miles deep.

In the dim underwater world, the outer sky became visible.

This commotion alarmed the surrounding powerful beings, even though the Immortal Trap Formation remained unbroken.

Jian Wushuang held on desperately.

Thunder flickered, the sword shadows dimmed, and the powerful Sword Qi erupted became chaotic.

"Petty skills, and you think you can trap me!" Kun Tai once again thrust his palm.

At the moment the Immortal Trap Formation broke, a fist condensed into a singularity, broke through the shattered formation, and thundered towards Jian Wushuang.

This fist had no shadow, no aura; it was just a pure point.

Jian Wushuang was shocked, attempting to retreat but had no time.

The Candle Dragon Inner Armor instantly condensed on his chest, and the Candle Dragon Wings enveloped him.

He didn't hesitate to activate the Beast God Domain, causing his divine body to once again increase to 30,000-fold.

Boom!

Upon contact with Jian Wushuang, that singularity erupted instantly.

Starting weakly, the explosion became boundless.

The shocking burst made Jian Wushuang retreat a million miles, hindered by the resistance of the seawater.

Despite the double protection of Candle Dragon Wings and Candle Dragon Inner Armor, Jian Wushuang's physical body shattered repeatedly before reconstituting.

The 30,000-fold divine body withstood this blow, although the inner armor and wings were reduced to an extremely weak state, and the divine body suffered severe damage, plummeting to below 10,000-fold.

Fortunately, the Extreme Dao Origin Source was transforming into the sea, and this punch hadn't harmed his Origin Source yet.

Gong Miaoyi and Bai Junwang, who were escaping in the distance, also noticed the situation.

Bai Junwang's face changed, turning to Gong Miaoyi with a cold voice, "If you dare to play tricks again, I will definitely kill you!"
