Chapter 1867: Frightening Everyone

“I see,” Jian Wushuang understood, “I am proficient in Sword Principles. In other words, this Emperor Sword Palace will be of great use to me.”

“That’s right. Even to Great Emperor-level experts who are proficient in Sword Principles, the Emperor Sword Palace that Sword Emperor Dugu has left behind would be extremely useful. Hence, it would naturally be even more useful to you, Hall Master Wushuang.” Hall Master Yuan laughed, “However, this Sword Principle Inheritance Token is extremely rare. Emperor God Jiu Yin, how did you obtain it?”

“I was able to obtain it as I was lucky,” Emperor God Jiu Yin grinned, “Before Sword Emperor invited me to the Deluge Fortress, I got to know that a Sir God possessed a Sword Principle Inheritance Token by coincidence. Back then, I was not too concerned with it. However, after I was recruited by you, Sword Emperor, I thought about it. Hence, over the past few years, I found that Sir God and used some methods to obtain this Sword Principle Inheritance Token easily.”

“Is that so? Your luck is not too bad,” Hall Master Yuan gasped.

“Emperor God Jiu Yin,” Jian Wushuang looked in the direction of Emperor God Jiu Yin, “Thank you very much. I shall accept this Sword Principle Inheritance Token.”

“Haha, there is no need for you to be so modest. Although this Sword Principle Inheritance Token is valuable, it is still comparable to a Chaos Divine Treasure-level defense armor.” Emperor God Jiu Yin laughed heartily, “Oh right. From what I know, the Emperor Sword Palace will open up again in another three hundred years’ time. If you wish to go there, you had better hurry.”

“In another three hundred years’ time?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

With three hundred years of time, he would be able to make it in time. However, the most important thing was that the Lineage of Star was in great danger. At such a stage, wouldn’t he not be able to make time to go there?

“Hall Master Wushuang, you may set your mind at ease and go.” Hall Master Yuan could tell that Jian Wushuang was worried and he laughed immediately. “After teaching the Abysmal Palace a lesson, for a short period of time, the experts from the powerhouses in the Sanctuary Alliance will probably not have the guts to attack the Lineage of Star again.”

“Even if they were to really attack us, it would probably only be after another thousands of years. According to what I know, every time the Emperor Sword Palace opens, one can only stay inside for one thousand years’ time and you will definitely be able to make it back in time. The only troublesome thing is the Emperor Sword Sect as they might not let you enter the Emperor Sword Palace.”

“Why?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

He was confident that he had asked Hall Master Yuan before in the past. Hence, he already knew the big powerhouses that had a grudge against the Lineage of Star.

For example, the Divine King Island, the Real Martial Arts Divine Church and the Highest Heaven Emperor Mansion all had a huge grudge against the Lineage of Star.

However, among those big powerhouses, the Emperor Sword Sect was not included.

Since there were no grudges between them and Jian Wushuang really possessed the Sword Principle Inheritance Token, why would the Emperor Sword Sect not let him enter the Emperor Sword Palace?

“There are indeed no huge grudges between the Lineage of Star and the Emperor Sword Sect. This is not fake and at the very least, no experts from either side have died at the hands of the other. Even if there were, both sides do not know about it. However, although there are no huge grudges, there are small conflicts. For example, when Palace Master (Star Palace Master) was travelling in the Second Lair in the past, he fought with the current Sect Master of the Emperor Sword Sect for his own benefit. Moreover, he also caused the Emperor Sword Sect Master to suffer huge losses and he lost all his face in front of everyone.”

“Although this was only a small episode and it was not at the stage where both of them would take action to kill each other, the Emperor Sword Sect Master still remembered it. Now, since you wish to enter the Emperor Sword Palace, you definitely have to obtain the approval of the Emperor Sword Sect first. Perhaps the Emperor Sword Sect would not take action to attack you, but they would probably make things slightly more difficult for you,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang understood. “Let’s not care about this Emperor Sword Sect. After all, I still have three hundred years of time. During this period of time, I will stay in the Lineage of Star and take a look at the reactions of all the powerhouses in the Sanctuary Alliance. If there are really no movements from them, I will go to the Emperor Sword Sect three hundred years later.”

“Alright,” Hall Master Yuan nodded his head in approval. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Emperor God Jiu Yin, this is the first day where you have become the Guest Elder of the Lineage of Star. I will get people to prepare a banquet immediately and during the banquet, I will announce this to everyone,” Jian Wushuang said. “Please go ahead.”

Emperor God Jiu Yin did not stand on ceremony. Under Jian Wushuang’s personal guidance, he took a step into the Universe Galaxy.

…

With Palace Master Wu Luo leading them personally, the large number of experts from the Abysmal Palace fought their way into the Star Land, attracting a lot of attention. However, in the end, before they could reach the doorstep of the Lineage of Star, they were defeated by the experts of the Lineage of Star who Jian Wushuang led and were forced to escape.

Among the eighteen Almighties, a total of nine of them were killed on the spot!

Even Emperor God Dan Tu, an Emperor God-level genius, died in that battle.

The moment this piece of news spread, the Sanctuary Alliance burst into an uproar.

It should be known that previously, when they had gotten to know that the Abysmal Palace was going to attack the Lineage of Star, the experts of all the powerhouses in the Sanctuary Alliance had thought that it would be the end of the line for the Lineage of Star.

However, who could have expected the end results to be as such?

Moreover, during that battle, the large number of trump cards that the Lineage of Star had unleashed had caused the experts of quite a number of powerhouses to be extremely terrified.

Those thirty bronze-armored Dao soldiers!

Although Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Shi Yun were merely Sir Gods, they actually possessed Chaos Divine Treasures?

In the end, the most shocking thing had been the frightening fighting capabilities that Jian Wushuang had revealed.

“Eighth level. This Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine has actually achieved the standard needed to clear the eighth level of the Doctrine Palace?”

“Even though his level of comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine is so high, he still hid it all the while. This Jian Wushuang has really hidden his abilities so deeply!”

“Since his level of comprehension of the Spacetime Doctrine is so high, the golden swords that he controls will become extremely frightening. Just three of them alone were able to give Palace Master Wu Luo a great amount of pressure. With four of them, even Palace Master Wu Luo was completely suppressed. When further combined with the Ancient God’s Secret Skills that Jian Wushuang unleashed, he actually defeated Palace Master Wu Luo head-on!”

“Previously, I thought that it was a bit too much to put Jian Wushuang in the top thirty of the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. However, looking at it now, after this battle, his ranking will definitely rise again. At the very least, he will have a higher ranking than Palace Master Wu Luo. However, I wonder what his ranking will be?”

Countless experts were chatting enthusiastically.

As for those powerhouses who were restless and wanted to attack the Lineage of Star, they became quiet again.

There was no choice. The results of this battle were something that they had never expected.

Originally, they had thought that with the Abysmal Palace taking action personally, it would be enough to force the Lineage of Star to its limit and the Lineage of Star’s situation then would be revealed.

However, in the end, after the battle, the Lineage of Star had become even more unfathomable.

Because, to date, they still did not know how those Dao soldiers and Chaos Divine Treasures were obtained. On top of that, they were unable to confirm whether the Star Palace Master was dead or alive. Hence, they did not dare to act recklessly.

In no time, the rankings in the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list underwent some changes again.

At that point, Jian Wushuang, who was originally ranked thirty in the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, was ranked… twenty-two!
