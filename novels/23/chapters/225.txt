Chapter 226: The Bloodline of Sword Ancestor

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang was a little bit surprised.

Different types of Origin had different properties.

World Origin was naturally comprehended by Jian Wushuang after he combined the four sword essences.

World Origin contained everything in the heaven and earth. It was a source of energy that was perfect in all aspects and without flaws.

However, Slaughter Origin was an Origin that was extremely cruel.

Slaughter Origin was specialized in attacking and killing. In terms of killing power, it was much stronger than World Origin.

But in all other aspects, it was no better than World Origin.

It was extremely cruel and focused on the offense, so it was very hard for people to manage it.

The absolute beauty said, “The second stage of the test was to test your mentality.

“Although Slaughter Origin is mainly on killing, the decision to kill must be followed by the conscience. Even if you need to commit a murder, you need to be reasonable and have a clear conscience!

“You killed many people in Illusory Realm of Slaughter, but you still held your original mind and was not lost in the killing, so you passed the second stage. Then you entered the final stage of the dreamland, Cliff of Repentance!

“The third step was the most important one as it was a test of comprehension of the Origin!

“Slaughter Origin was originally comprehended gradually through killing. The purpose of the second stage was not just testing, but it also allowed you to slowly store up the killing intent at the same time. In the third stage, the killing intent would suddenly be activated when you confronted a guardian in the dreamland!

“The moment when the killing intent broke out, was the best time for you to fully comprehend Slaughter Origin and hopefully succeed as well.”

The absolute beauty was smiling.

However, hearing this, Jian Wushuang had an odd expression on his face.

He did not expect that the first test on the Ancestor’s Land included so many complicated steps, and all with astonishing difficulties. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The tests of the mind and mentality were very difficult for him. Any hesitation could bring him into a disastrous state.

The final stage was even more difficult to overcome.

It was known that Origin was extremely powerful, so it was not something that can be easily comprehended.

After he got the four sword essences combined step by step, Jian Wushuang luckily comprehended a slight fraction of Origin.

However, he had never learnt about Slaughter Origin, neither did he comprehend the killing sword essence. Therefore, it would be even more difficult for him to comprehend Slaughter Origin through the first test.

Fortunately, the dreamland had been gradually enhancing his killing intent. He finished all the steps except the last one.

The last one was the most important. Jian Wushuang made it in the end.

“Were the tests that my father passed before similar to mine?” Jian Wushuang looked towards the Absolute Beauty and asked.

“Yes.” The Absolute Beauty nodded. “He comprehended Slaughter Origin in the Illusory Realm of Slaughter, same as you did. The difference was that he spent four months on it, while you just spent three. To a certain extent, you are even stronger than your father.”

“Three months?” Jian Wushuang’s face changed.?“Did I stay in the dreamland for three months?”

He knew that the amount of people he had killed in the dreamland was considerable but he didn’t know how exactly many people he had killed, and how long he had been there.

Now he knew.

“Young man, since you have passed the first test of the Ancestor’s Land, you have become a disciple of the Bloodline of Sword Ancestor since today,” the absolute beauty said.

“Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“Let’s talk about it outside.” The absolute beauty walked outside the palace with the strong man.

Jian Wushuang followed them at once.

The absolute beauty led Jian Wushuang to an altar. The altar looked old, and nothing could be seen there except few stelae. In the right front of the altar, there was a chain bridge.

The iron bridge was extremely long and it extended to the deep into the Ancestor’s Land. Standing at the altar, Jian Wushuang overlooked the far end of the chain bridge, without any objects obstructing his sight.

“Young man, what’s your name?” the absolute beauty looked towards Jian Wushuang and asked.

“Jian Wushuang,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Jian Wushuang? I am Jin Ling.” Then the absolute beauty pointed to the strong man next to her and said, “This is my second brother, Mu Shan.”

“I believe you’ve already known that my brother and I are not humans.”

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

Since Jian Wushuang entered the Ancestor’s Land for the first time and glanced at the strong man Mu Shan, he had already known that Mu Shan was not a human being.

“Actually, we are Puppet Fighters,” said Jin Ling.

“Same as what I expected.” Jian Wushuang took a deep breath.

Though he had guessed Jin Ling and Mu Shan’s real identities long time ago, yet now he was still shocked lightly after Jin Ling confirmed it.

It was known that normally Puppet Fighters never had intelligence. They just obeyed their master’s orders unconditionally like tools.

However, despite being Puppet Fighters, they were no weaker in intelligence than humans.

He had never heard a Puppet Fighter like this before. Needless to say, such Puppet Fighters should be of extremely high level.

“Not sure about the level of their fighting capabilities.”?Jian Wushuang pondered.

“I can tell that you have a lot of questions right now. Go ahead to ask me. Now you are the disciple of the Bloodline of Sword Ancestor, so you are qualified to know some things,” said Jin Ling.

“I want to know what the Ancestor’s Land is, and what is the relationship between it and me?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The Ancestor’s Land is the cemetery for the Sword Ancestor!” Jin Ling looked at Jian Wushuang. “As for the relationship between you, it is simple. You are the descendant of the Bloodline of Sword Ancestor.”

“The descendant of a Sword Ancestor?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Jin Ling explained. “You are indeed the descendant of the Sword Ancestors. Your identity can be reflected through your awakening of the Sword Soul, so you don’t need to doubt it.

“Many years ago, there was a person of tremendous power existing both in the heaven and earth. He was the Sword Ancestor, the ancestor of the Sword Principle. He was the recognized number one in terms of the Sword Principle comprehension!

“Sword Ancestor built the Bloodline of Sword Ancestor, and made it into a super powerful force. At the peak of the Bloodline of Sword Ancestor, the strength they had far exceeds your imagination.

“However, a thousand years ago, Sword Ancestor suddenly died without a reasonable explanation!

“After Sword Ancestor died, the Bloodline of Sword Ancestor collapsed instantly. It was uprooted by another force, and the disciples there suffered cruel treatment from their enemies. Finally, only a few disciples survived and they fled here later on.

“But they were unable to bring back the Bloodline of Sword Ancestor again, so finally they were just killed. And afterwards, the Mansion of Sword Marquis emerged!

“Actually, the predecessor of the Mansion of Sword Marquis is the Bloodline of Sword Ancestor.

“The disciples of the Mansion of Sword Marquis are all descendants of the Bloodline of Sword Ancestor.”
