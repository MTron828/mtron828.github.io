Chapter 604: The Strongest Expert In The Ancient World!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Although in overall strength, the Darkness Temple was weaker than the Bone Dragon Emperor’s force, it had a strong and tyrannical Temple Master.

He was called Dark Emperor!

In the Ancient World, Dark Emperor, Bone Dragon Emperor and Sir Ming were the top three experts.

Each of them was much stronger than Level Three experts at Skyscraping Realm. They were considered to have reached Level Four.

As one of the top three, even Bone Dragon Emperor could do nothing to Dark Emperor. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Temple Master Black Spirit of Human League in the Monster Continent was an exception.

Her own strength was at Peak of Level Three, nearly as strong as Sword Ancestor at his Peak. But she possessed a relic from the Monster-exterminating League, a half broken finger of God Hong.

To use the broken finger placed a great burden on Temple Master Black Spirit’s body, so she could at most use it twice. Once used, she could easily kill Bone Dragon Emperor and Dark Emperor.

That’s why Temple Master Black Spirit was feared on the Monster Continent. Even Bone Dragon Emperor dared not push her too much, worried that if she used the broken finger, at least one of them would be killed.

Because of the broken finger, Temple Master Black Spirit was counted as one of the strongest in the Ancient World.

“Jian Wushuang, Dark Emperor is arrogant, selfish and strong. The Darkness Temple’s overall strength isn’t the most powerful, but Dark Emperor indulges them by allowing them to be arrogant in the Ancient World. Since Su Ming has joined the Darkness Temple, Dark Emperor surely wouldn’t allow you to kill him.” Bone Dragon Emperor said.

“Is there anything I can do?” Jian Wushuang frowned and asked.

“There is.” Bone Dragon Emperor looked at him and said, “Ask my master for help. Dark Emperor is as strong as me, but compared to my master, he is nothing.”

“Ask master Di Jing for help?” Jian Wushuang shook his head, “No hurry, it’s better not to trouble him unless there is no other way.”

“Okay, then maybe you can offer him a treasure he is interested in, that way he will not stop you because of his greedy nature; ” said Bone Dragon Emperor.

“A treasure he is interested in?” Jian Wushuang had a sudden idea.

“Is there another way?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Or you could improve yourself to become as strong as me, then the Dark Emperor would be unable to stop you. I believe it will not take you long.” Bone Dragon Emperor said.

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He left this option aside.

Although it would not take him long to be strong as them, he had no time. He wanted to resolve his issues as soon as possible, so that he could go to Emperor Xiao and prepare for the Firmament Territory Feast.

“Jian Wushuang, what do you think?” Bone Dragon Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Let’s visit Dark Emperor first, I have a treasure and I don’t know whether he is interested in it. If not, I will send a message and ask master Di Jing for help.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Okay, I will lead you there.” Bone Dragon Emperor immediately set off.

The Darkness Temple was in the Dark Continent, one of the many plane worlds of the Ancient World.

A boundless dark palace sat in mysterious dark fog.

In a hall, deep in the palace, three people sat at a long narrow table and drank together.

Among them, there was an evil man who was even more beautiful than many women. He was the man Jian Wushuang had been wanting to kill–Su Ming–a traitor of the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor!

“Ninth Saint Master, are you still thinking about Jian Wushuang?” A regal lady in rich robes looked at Su Ming.

“Kind of.” Su Ming said.

“Don’t worry. Jian Wushuang may have killed many Skyscraping Realm experts, but those people had no or small backgrounds and they were normal Skyscraping Realm experts. You are different.” The lady said with a smile.

During the last two months, the news that Jian Wushuang and Bone Dragon Emperor killed 14 Skyscraping Realm experts had spread in the Ancient World.

Many people in the Ancient World had heard of Jian Wushuang, including people in the Darkness Temple. Su Ming was the person Jian Wushuang wanted to kill the most, so he was also aware of this.

“Ninth Saint Master, you’re a Saint Master of the Darkness Temple. My husband will protect you. Even if Jian Wushuang comes, what can he do?” The lady laughed.

“I hope so.” Su Ming nodded, but his face was still cold.

“I didn’t expect Jian Wushuang had improved so much in less than a year. He is nearly as strong as that old guy at?his peak.?Hehe, what a talented junior brother!”Su Ming thought.

But he did not care too much.

He was the Ninth Saint Master of the Darkness Temple now. If Jian Wushuang wanted to kill him, he had to get through the Dark Emperor first.

Besides, he had a trump card, which he believed would save his life.

“Junior brother, you better be aware of the situation, otherwise... If you push me too much, I will use it.”

Su Ming’s insidious face smiled.
