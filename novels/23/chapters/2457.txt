Chapter 2458: Drawing The Line

Yu Aoqing recounted everything she knew.

The many experts around fell silent.

“Junior Sister Aoqing, you meant that when you joined forces with Zishan and the others, not only did all of you fail to kill Jian Wushuang, but were also defeated by Jian Wushuang. What’s worse was that Junior Brother Yan and the others died in Jian Wushuang’s hands?” Tu Qiancheng furrowed his brows tightly.

“Yes.” Yu Aoqing nodded slightly.

“Bastard!” Tu Qiancheng was infuriated.

“Jian Wushuang! Oh, Jian Wushuang!” Han Yun and the few Peak Divine Demons of the Great Compassion Sect were also furious.

Exasperated, the others around were secretly clicking their tongues.

Earlier on, Jian Wushuang had killed Pang Tao. He then killed four other First-Class Divine Demons disciples of the Great Compassion Sect. Their hatred was growing.

Everyone continued to wait.

Not long after, several figures appeared at the same time. All of those people were some of the sects’ First-Class Divine Demons genius disciples.

Their appearance attracted the experts’ attention present. Thereafter... Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Many more figures emerged.

Around 20 people had left the tomb using their Safety Token.

“What’s wrong?”

Those experts were taken aback.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Two more figures emerged.

“This is...Huan Chen? Huo Yang?”

“Both of them also left the tomb?”

“What’s the matter?”

Everyone was still trying to figure out what had just happened. A light flickered and Long Zishan from the Great Compassionate Sect emerged from the tomb.

Han Yun immediately stepped forward and asked, “Zishan! What the hell is going on? Didn’t you guys besiege Jian Wushuang together? Why are you out now? Where is Jian Wushuang?”

“Elder Han Yun, Senior Brother Qiancheng, we are incompetent. We did team up to besiege Jian Wushuang, but Jian Wushuang was simply a huge freak. He had no weak points and we could not do anything to him. At last, he used a special domain-type method to trap and subdue all of us before killing us one by one. Those of us who besieged him were either forced to crush the Safety Token or die in his hands.” Long Zishan poured out bitterly.

“In other words, nearly 50 First-Class Divine Demons who joined forces were single-handedly defeated by Jian Wushuang?” Han Yun looked over in disbelief.

“Yes,” Long Zishan bowed his head in shame when he answered.

On the glade, all the other sects were also asking some of their disciples who came out of the tombs about what had happened. All of them received a unanimous answer.

Many genius disciples joined in the mob attack but failed to kill Jian Wushuang. In return, all of them suffered a miserable defeat.

There were around 50 First-Class Divine Demon genius disciples and nearly half of them were beheaded by Jian Wushuang. The rest were forced to crush their Safety Token and reappeared on the glade.

Many sects present were angry when informed of the result!

In a corner of the glade.

“Second Elder, did you hear that?” Elder Wujian looked charged.

Elder Linghe nodded with his eyes narrowed. “I heard it. I didn’t expect this kid to survive under the siege of so many First-Class Divine Demon disciples. He even defeated those First-Class Divine Demons in a head-on battle. That’s really incredible.”

However, that also means he has offended even more sects. Those sects must have hated him even more,” said the Seventh Elder that was standing aside coldly. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Indeed, although Jian Wushuang had killed many before, most were only Second-Class Divine Demons, not the best genius disciples of the sects.

On the other hand, around 20 First-Class Divine Demons were killed in the recent battle.

Those 20 First-Class Divine Demons were seen as their sects’ treasures. It was no doubt that the sects would develop deep hatred and hostility against Jian Wushuang.

On the glade, the three Narcissus Island Elders could see that many sects were gnashing their teeth. Their eyes filled with the burning flames of hatred and anger.

“I will report this to the Lord, and he shall decide on what to do,” said Elder Linghe who immediately left off.

After some time, the Lord of Narcissus Island responded.

“The decision is made,” announced Elder Linghe solemnly.

Both Elder Wujian and the Seventh Elder immediately turned to look at Elder Linghe.

Elder Linghe took a deep breath before standing up to face the many experts.

“Can I have your attention, please?”

The magnificent voice of Elder Linghe echoing over the entire glade.

All the experts gave Elder Linghe their attention. Their eyes were cold as they stared at Elder Linghe.

That was understandable. After all, Jian Wushuang who was from Narcissus Island had killed so many genius disciples in the tomb. With that, he had gotten on the wrong side of those sects. It was obvious that those sects would channel their anger and hatred towards Narcissus Island.

Elder Linghe pulled himself up taller and solemnly said, “Everyone, although Jian Wushuang comes from Narcissus Island, he has not been with us for a long time. He has always been very low-key, not showing much of his capabilities. We don’t know that he’s capable of being so cruel and committing such heinous acts. Such a person is not worthy to be a disciple of Narcissus Island, hence after discussing with the Elders, we have decided to expel him from Narcissus Island.”

From now on, Narcissus Island will no longer be held accountable for his conduct and behavior. We would not be responsible for his life or death.”

We would also like to humbly apologize for all the troubles and pains that he has caused in the Saint’s Tomb. We are sorry for the losses that all of you have encountered due to his frantic killing.”

All the experts scoffed in their hearts after hearing Elder Linghe’s words. They squint their eyes dismissively.

“At least, Narcissus Island is sensible.”

“The Lord of Narcissus Island is not stupid. Knowing that Jian Wushuang has caused public outrage, he would be gambling the fate of Narcissus Island if he chooses to defend Jian Wushuang. That would’ve taken a toll on Narcissus Island’s foundation. The Lord doesn’t have the courage to do so.”

“I heard that Jian Wushuang is just an outer disciple of Narcissus Island. He doesn’t have much sense of belonging to Narcissus Island. Of course, Narcissus Island will not be so stupid as to offend many sects for the sake of an outer disciple.”

“Since Narcissus Island has drawn a clear line with Jian Wushuang, then just let them off. Otherwise... Huh!”

Those experts were secretly discussing with each other. None of them thought that Narcissus Island had made the wrong move and showed no contemptuousness over the decision made.

In fact, they were no longer holding grudges against Narcissus Island after the announcement was made. They would be after Jian Wushuang for what he had done.

Jian Wushuang was quite pitiful. After he was pulled into the catastrophe, Narcissus Island, which should have given him protection, did not hesitate to abandon him.
