4113 Nirvana Pool of Life

The higher the level of life, the more difficult it was to develop one’s innate advantage, which had long been recognized.

These newcomers thought that Jian Wushuang’s development of his innate advantage was not as good as theirs, which was reasonable. However, they forgot that Jian Wushuang was a perfect life. Even if he only developed 50-60% of his innate advantage, he was still much more powerful than these initial, universe, or even creation-level life-forms who exploited 100% of their innate advantage.

Whoosh!

A figure suddenly appeared in the open space. It was none other than Supreme Gu Yi, who was in charge of managing the Life Nirvana Pool.

After Supreme Gu Yi arrived, he first glanced at Jian Wushuang with a smile in his eyes before looking around.

“Is everyone here?” Supreme Gu Yi asked.

“My Lord, all the special life forms who have joined the Life Palace during this period of time are here. There are 438 of them, including one in the perfect life level, four in the creation level, 161 in the universe level, and 272 in the initial level,” said the man and woman who had led Jian Wushuang here, the red-clothed woman said.

“Yes.” Supreme Gu Yi nodded and waved his hand. Immediately, a spatial passage appeared in the empty space in front of him.

“Remember, after you enter the Life Nirvana Pool, your body will begin to transform. This transformation will take a long time. You can cultivate your life divine power while transforming and develop your innate advantages as much as possible. As long as your transformation ends, you can come out of the Life Nirvana Pool. Since the transformation has stopped, no matter how hard you try, you can’t improve at all,” Supreme Gu Yi instructed.

“Yes.” The rookies on the open ground, including Jian Wushuang, nodded in unison.

“Alright, let’s go in.” Supreme Gu Yi said.

Immediately, the rookies on the open ground rushed toward the universe passage, and Jian Wushuang stepped into the universe passage.

Soon, all the rookies on the open ground had entered the Life Nirvana Pool.

As soon as they entered, whoosh. A figure suddenly appeared beside Supreme Gu Yi.

“Ruler Blood Wave.” Supreme Gu Yi looked at the newcomer and bowed slightly.

“Gu Yi, those little guys have already entered?” Ruler Blood Wave looked over.

“Yes, including the little guy named Jian Wushuang, who you think highly of. He has also entered the Life Nirvana Pool. This little guy has only cultivated for 300,000 years and reached his current level. He has even comprehended a trace of the universe principle and is extremely talented. If nothing goes wrong, he can at least develop 70% of his innate advantage in the Life Nirvana Pool.” Supreme Gu Yi said with a smile.

“Seventy percent?” Ruler Blood Wave narrowed his eyes slightly, then asked with a smile, “How much of the lifeforce in the Nirvana Pool is left?”

“It wasn’t too long ago that the lifeforce was put into the Nirvana pool. Although we went through more than ten baptisms, we should still have about a quarter of it left,” Ruler Gu Yi said.

“A quarter?” Ruler Blood Wave frowned. “That’s too little. Let’s get a new lifesource.”

“A quarter is too little?” Ruler Gu Yi was startled.

The lifesource was the most important treasure used to form the Nirvana Lake.

The enormous Nirvana Lake was able to help special lifeforms develop their innate advantages. The lifesource was the main reason why it was so useful.

And the source of life was extremely precious in the universe.

Under normal circumstances, a complete source of life could allow the Life Nirvana Pool to undergo dozens of baptisms.

For example, the recent baptism of life was more than ten times. Because there were more blessed-level life forms coming for the baptism, there were even a few peak blessed-level life forms, so the cost was much more. However, after more than ten baptisms…only three-quarters of it had been used up.

There was still a quarter of the lifeforce left. Logically speaking, it should be able to support several more baptisms of life.

“Don’t forget, this time, there is a perfect lifeform coming for the baptism of life, and this little fellow has great potential. Who knows how much lifeforce he can absorb in the nirvana lifepool, so there is no harm in making more preparations. In any case, if this lifeforce is put into the nirvana lifepool in advance, its effects won’t be weakened.” Ruler Blood Wave said.

“That makes sense. Alright, I will add a new life source into the Life Nirvana Pool.” Ruler Gu Yi waved his hand and tore through space, entering the Life Nirvana Pool.

The Life Nirvana Pool was called a pool, but it was actually a vast green sea. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The newcomers who entered the Life Nirvana Pool entered the green sea and immediately entered the endless green sea.

They all knew that the most important thing in the Life Nirvana Pool was the cyan sea water. The cyan sea water contained an extremely unique medicinal power, which was formed by the Life Palace at a great cost.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate and directly rushed into the cyan sea. The moment his body flew into the sea, he immediately felt waves of scalding strange power surging toward his body.

“So hot.”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and felt his whole body suddenly become hot. The waves of hot strange power flowed through his pores and his whole body was instantly stimulated by the strange power, the hidden power in his body also began to be gradually stimulated.

What was stimulated was Jian Wushuang’s innate advantage.

The innate advantage of a perfect life was far beyond the imagination of ordinary cultivators. However, the power had been hidden in his body for a long time, so he could not activate it, he could not use it.

The purpose of the green seawater in the Life Nirvana Pool was to fully activate the hidden power.

“What a special feeling.”

Jian Wushuang had already felt that as the hidden power in his body was gradually being developed, the process of development was very comfortable, and his body was also undergoing a transformation during the process of development.

“The function of the pool of life has begun to show. I can’t waste time and begin to cultivate the second volume of the Divine Power of life.” Jian Wushuang’s heart moved, and he immediately began to cultivate the second volume of the Divine Power of life.

He had already cultivated the first volume of the Divine Power of life a long time ago and had the experience of cultivating the first volume. Now, he was very familiar with cultivating the second volume.

In less than half a day, he had already cultivated the second volume of the Divine Power of life. As soon as he finished cultivating the second volume of the Divine Power of life, Jian Wushuang’s body trembled. The hidden power in his body…had also been greatly developed at this moment.
