Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. Then two towering Sword Soul Phantoms rose behind him.

Each of the Sword Soul Phantoms was almost 100 feet tall and contained a mighty Sword Essence.

The experts by the entrance could not help marveling at it.

“How about it?” Jian Wushuang asked while looking at the cyan-dressed man.

“Sir, please wait a moment.” The cyan-dressed man immediately went to open the Formation.

After a while, Jian Wushuang saw a hole appear in the Formation, so he walked in through it.

The cyan-dressed man stepped forward and said, “Sir, I’m An Feng and have guarded this area for many years. If you have any problems, you can ask me.”

“OK.” Jian Wushuang glanced at the cyan-dressed man and nodded slightly.

“Sir, please come with me.” The cyan-dressed man immediately led Jian Wushuang into the mansion.

As a marquis cave mansion, Beimo Cave Mansion covered a vast stretch of land, with a long channel connected to the entrance. Jian Wushuang was walking in the channel while inspecting some of the guards in it. Most of the guards were at Stage Two.

He even saw some experts that were at Stage Three. Obviously, the security here was much more powerful than that at Jiushe Cave Mansion.

Jian Wushuang sensed two streams of faint but terrifying auras. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Obviously, there were two lords guarding this mansion.

“It’s worthy of being a marquis cave mansion. Two lords actually guard it.”?Jian Wushuang sighed in private.

“Sir, we’re arriving at the inner layer of this mansion. There are three opportunities in this mansion. I will show you later,” An Feng said.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

They quickly arrived at the inner layer of Beimo Cave Mansion and entered a huge secret chamber.

The chamber was as large as a small Martial Arts Practice Field, with only a statue standing on the ground.

It was like a human being, except for the fact that it had no aura.

“A Puppet Fighter.” Jian Wushuang immediately knew that it was a powerful Puppet Fighter as soon as he saw it.

Behind the Puppet Fighter, there was a long narrow table with an Interspatial Ring suspended in the middle of it. The ring, which was covered by a layer of gray energy, easily drew his attention.

“Sir, this Interspatial Ring is the first opportunity in Beimo Cave Mansion!” An Feng whispered to Jian Wushuang, “The ring Marquis Beimo left is filled with countless precious treasures, most of which even lords would like to possess.

“No one knows how many treasures this Interspatial Ring holds. Ever since our camp conquered this place, we’ve tried to take this ring away, but even Marquis Piaoxue did not succeed, let alone binding it to himself.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was surprised, but he immediately understood.

According to the information he received, Marquis Beimo was extremely powerful, and much stronger than an ordinary marquis. It was not surprising that such a super expert left a special spell on his Interspatial Ring so that not even Marquis Piaoxue could break it.

“Though you can’t take it away, you will be given a chance to receive some treasures from it,” An Feng continued, “The only way to obtain treasures is to pass a test given by this Puppet Fighter.”

“Test?”?Jian Wushuang thought with some expectations.

Commonly, opportunities were accompanied by tests.

Just like the Ancestor’s Land...

There were a large number of opportunities in the Ancestor’s Land, but in order to get receive the benefits, one needed to pass three tests.

“As for the test, Sir, as long as you fight this Puppet Fighter for 10 breaths of time, which means that the Puppet Fighter doesn’t kill you or drive you out of the secret chamber, you will have passed,” An Feng said.

“Fight for 10 breaths of time?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

“Sir, this Puppet Fighter has reached the lord level,” An Feng replied.

Jian Wushuang frowned.

“There must have been other experts that came here before me and took this test, right?” he asked.

“Right.” An Feng nodded. “Since the time our camp conquered this place, lots of experts have come here and passed this test. Each of them gained a treasure from the Interspatial Ring.

“However, they were all lords!”

“As I expected.”?Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Entering Beimo Cave Mansion would cost an expert 100,000 battle achievements. An ordinary Saint Realm expert could not earn 100,000 battle achievements, so it was only possible for them to be lords.

Jian Wushuang had the opportunity to come here because he received a special reward.

“I wonder if I can hold on for 10 breaths of time.”?Jian Wushuang thought with a hint of expectation in his eyes.

“Sir, I will wait outside of the secret chamber. Good luck,” An Feng said.

Then he walked out of the secret chamber and closed the door.

The Puppet Fighter suddenly opened his eye and coldly looked at the young man.

Jian Wushuang’s expression became solemn. As he watched the Puppet Fighter, which was emanating a mighty aura, he directly performed Road to the Underworld and Tenfold Realm, causing the Blood River to spread out and cover the whole chamber.

Then Jian Wushuang pointed at the edge of Blood River and the colossal Bridge of Helplessness stretched out over it.

While covered by a scarlet armor, he was standing on the bridge like a peerless Asura.

Then two towering Sword Soul Phantoms rose behind him.

“Come,” Jian Wushuang said with a cold look in his eyes.

He held his Triple-kill Sword while exuding a soaring aura.

His strength had reached its peak.

The Puppet Fighter looked at the young man. He slowly lowered his crossed forearms and clenched his hands. As a streak of light flashed faintly, a surge of terrifying power began to gather in his hands.

The Puppet Fighter instantly moved!
