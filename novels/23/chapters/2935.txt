Chapter 2936: Gathering

——

“Sword Heavenly Marquis, what do you think of this task? Do you want to do it?” Xue Dong King looked over.

“If I pass the test in a year, I will complete this task with you,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Haha, that’s great.” Xue Dong King immediately smiled, “Although the three Shadow Saints are not very strong individually, they stay together all year round and have a tacit understanding. If the three of them really work together, I, a top False Saint, am not absolutely sure that I can kill them. But if I work together with you, I am absolutely sure.”

Jian Wushuang just smiled faintly.

Then, the two of them waited quietly.

Although they said they were waiting, in fact, Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King had a casual exchange for a while before they went to cultivate.

He was extremely talented. Although the year was short, he could still make some progress.

…

In the blink of an eye, a year passed.

“Sword Heavenly Marquis, come with me,” the Elder called Jian Wushuang.

“Brother, I wish you good luck. I’ll wait for your triumphant return here,” Xue Dong King said with a laugh.

Jian Wushuang followed Elder Qiu toward the Inner Hall.

Soon, Jian Wushuang arrived in front of a huge wormhole.

“What’s this?” Jian Wushuang looked at the wormhole in front of him in confusion.

“On the other side of the wormhole is the gathering point. Every 10 years, nearly 100 nests, or nearly 100 territories, will be located there. Take your Heaven-cleaving token and go there directly. When you get there, someone will tell you what to do,” Elder Qiu said.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. Without any hesitation, he stepped into the wormhole in front of him.

With a flash of light, Jian Wushuang appeared on the top of a towering mountain.

Around the top of the mountain was an endless sea, with waves constantly sweeping over.

When Jian Wushuang arrived, there were already many people gathered in the open space on the top of the mountain.

At a glance, there were nearly 20 people. These people were either standing or sitting alone. No one spoke.

When Jian Wushuang appeared, a few people glanced at him.

“Another one…”

“His aura is very unique. I can’t tell his specific realm. Is he the Immortal Saint?”

Some people muttered in their hearts, but they only muttered a few words. Jian Wushuang’s appearance did not attract the attention of others.

Jian Wushuang looked around at the people around him and said, “Didn’t Elder Qiu say that nearly a hundred people from the surrounding lairs are gathered here? Why are there only so few people?”

Jian Wushuang was surprised, but he soon understood.

The Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s assessment was held once every ten years. Ten years was very short for ordinary Divine Masters, not to mention Immortal Saints.

Although the assessment was conducted in nearly a hundred nests at the same time, most nests would not have people take the assessment for ten years. Therefore, there were at most 20 to 30 people taking the assessment each time.

Among the nearly 20 people in front of him, Divine Masters accounted for more than half of them. As for the Immortal Saint, there were only four people on the field.

“It seems that the assessment is conducted by Divine Masters and the Immortal Saint at the same time. I wonder what the content of the assessment is?” Jian Wushuang muttered. He did not take the initiative to talk to them. Instead, he found a place to sit down casually.

…

Jian Wushuang waited here for about two hours. There were more than 30 people gathered on the top of the mountain, but there were only five Immortal Saints.

At this time, whoosh!

An old man with a goatee suddenly appeared in the void above the top of the mountain.

The old man with a goatee had a pair of narrow and strange eyes with a faint, cold luster. He looked down at the people below.

“Are all the participants here?” The old man with the goatee said coldly, “Five Immortal Saints and twenty-seven reverends. Tsk tsk, I hope that half of them will survive after this mission.”

Hearing this, the twenty-seven reverends and the five Immortal Saints below trembled.

All of them were quite powerful. For example, the twenty-seven reverends were all unrivaled reverends. There were many unrivaled reverends who had reached the second stage or even the third stage. They had great confidence in their own strength.

It was because of this that they dared to participate in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s assessment.

However, when the goateed old man saw them, he directly said that it was already good enough for half of them to survive?

This instantly caused a trace of pressure to appear at the bottom of their hearts.

“Don’t be nervous. Although there will be a large number of people who fail the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s assessment, as long as you are strong enough and careful enough, surviving is not a problem.” The goateed old man gave a strange smile.

“Sir, may I ask what the content of the assessment is? When will we start the assessment?” A deep voice sounded. The one who spoke was one of the five Immortal Saints.

“Don’t be anxious. The assessment hasn’t started yet. When it really starts, I will naturally tell you the content. As for now, let’s wait for a while. There is still a special person who hasn’t arrived yet.” The goateed Elder said. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Special person?”

The expressions of the people who came to participate in the test all changed. Then, they quietly waited.

After waiting for another hour, finally, a ray of light flashed. Then, a fiery figure appeared in front of everyone’s eyes.

Everyone immediately looked over.

The person who came was over two meters tall and graceful. Obviously, it was a woman.

However, the woman was wearing the same gray robe as the members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. She also wore the same gray mask.

“Let me introduce you. This is the heaven-rank member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, Yao Yu.” The old man with a goatee said with a smile.

“Yao Yu?”

“Heaven-rank member?”

The people below were shocked. They looked at the masked woman with respect.

The members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance were far from each other, and there was a huge difference in strength.

The ordinary members were mostly composed of Divine Masters and some Immortal Saints who had just broken through from Divine Masters and had not had the time to complete the promotion mission. For example, Xue Dong King was an Immortal Saint who had not had the time to complete the promotion mission, he was only an ordinary member now.

The weakest earth-level member should be a top False Saint, while most of them had already reached the True Saint-level or even a rank two True Saint. For example, the overlord of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, Bone Emperor, was supreme in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, Saint Hong of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion was also a rank one True Saint, but he was still weaker than Bone Emperor. Therefore, Jian Wushuang estimated that Bone Emperor should be a rank two True Saint, but Bone Emperor was only an earth-level member.

Generally, the weakest heaven-level member was a rank two True Saint, and the stronger one was a rank four or five True Saint.
