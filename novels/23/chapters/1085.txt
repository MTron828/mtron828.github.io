Chapter 1086: Eyebrows

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“An Eternal Realm rookie?”

The two elders had a look of surprise on their faces.

“When does the threshold for joining the Green Fire Palace become so low? It even allows an Eternal Realm rookie to join!”

“Although he is just at the Eternal Realm, perhaps he is the ruler of a powerful force, right?”

“It makes sense, haha…”

They talked to each other without paying attention to Jian Wushuang and Celestial Master Yu Ding.

“They…” Jian Wushuang’s expression turned solemn.

He could figure out that they were formidable and should have reached the advanced Celestial Master Level.

“They are the Celestial Masters of our palace and they became famous top experts in the same era—five million years ago.” Celestial Master Yu Ding explained.

“The one in black is Celestial Master Zhong and he was previously the ruler of a powerful force. But for some special reasons, the experts in that force had almost been annihilated by others. So, he chose to stay here and allow that force to run its own course.”

“The one in white is Celestial Master Xiao Ming, a solitary expert.”

Jian Wushuang could not help having deep admiration for them in his heart.

The two Celestial Masters coming out of nowhere had lived for more than five million years. This proved that they were really too old.

“Jian Wushuang, I want to show you someplace, follow me.”

Soon, they came to the top of a lofty pavilion.

They saw an open space in front of them and in its center, a gray light bead floated quietly in the air.

This bead was dotted with layers of abstruse, mysterious cracks on its surface.

“What’s this?”?Jian Wushuang asked as he stood in front of the gray light bead.

“Jian Wushuang, since you have joined the Green Fire Palace, you are entitled to know our secret. You’ll know that once you touch the bead. However, before touching it, you must take a Mortal Oath that you will never leak our secret to anyone else.” Celestial Master Yu Ding said grandly.

“Mortal Oath?” Jian Wushuang froze.

The Mortal Oath must be sworn on one’s Essence Blood. He would not pay a heavy price even if he broke it. Nonetheless, Heart Demon would grow inside him and it would have a great impact on his future cultivation. Therefore, under normal circumstances, no one would easily break the oath.

“I, Jian Wushuang, swear…” Jian Wushuang immediately swore the Mortal Oath.

“Fine, go and touch it.” Celestial Master Yu Ding said.

Jian Wushuang nodded and slowly extended his hand toward the gray light bead.

The moment he touched it, a huge picture appeared in his mind.

“What’s this?” Jian Wushuang thought and looked solemnly.

What he saw was a boundless world.

Its broadness was completely beyond his imagination.

Obviously, this world was divided into two different continents.

“Is this the Green Fire World?”?Jian Wushuang frowned.

The complete world he saw now turned out to be the Green Fire World.

He did not know how vast this world was previously. Nevertheless, this bead enabled him to have a panoramic view of it, including different territories and dangerous places.

“Celestial Master Yu Ding, what’s this?” Jian Wushuang asked with a look of doubt on his face.

“Don’t hurry. Just continue to sense it.” Celestial Master Yu Ding answered.

Jian Wushuang closed his eyes again to feel it attentively.

Soon, he saw a wider world outside the Green Fire World.

“The world outside the Green Fire World?”

With doubt in mind, Jian Wushuang began to observe it.

Without doubt it was much bigger than the Green Fire World. More and more things came into Jian Wushuang’s sight.

He caught sight of a land that was countless times larger than the Green Fire World, and the Green Fire World was just like a pebble on this land…

Most important of all, it was in ruins!

“Battlefield!!!”

Jian Wushuang’s heart knocked.

He instantly made out that it actually was a battlefield that had been existed for countless years and untold traces of fighting could be seen there. The Green Fire World was right here on the battlefield.

He was seized by shock.

The immensity of this battlefield far exceeded his imagination.

It was damn vast.

Vast as the Green Fire World was, it was merely a drop in the ocean compared with this battlefield.

Jian Wushuang continued to feel it and he beheld a dense cluster of mountains. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

They were lofty and every and each one of them was millions of feet tall!

“This, this…” Jian Wushuang was completely stunned by the scene he saw.

However, he could not see anything further.

Jian Wushuang slowly took his hand back from the gray light bead. His eyes popped because he was seized by an unprecedented shock.

He had never seen such an incredible scene in this lifetime.

And he had never witnessed such an amazing battlefield.

“Jian Wushuang, the Green Fire World is out of the ordinary!”?Gu King’s affirmative voice rang out in Jian Wushuang’s heart.

Gu King, as a parasitic insect, was connected with Jian Wushuang’s heart blood. Thus, he saw everything Jian Wushuang had observed through the gray light bead.

Though he knew a lot about the world, he was taken aback as he saw the battlefield.

“There are untold experts in the Eternal Chaotic World and their battles are incredibly crazy. When some top experts with formidable skills kill each other, their actions might result in the collapse of a world. Even so, such a battlefield cannot form easily!”?Gu King said in a deep voice.

“In addition, have you noticed that the shape and distribution of the mountains on the edge of the battlefield resemble something?”

“What?”?Jian Wushuang asked subconsciously.

“A person’s eyebrows!”?Gu King said seriously.

“What!”?Jian Wushuang was greatly frightened, but he immediately reacted to it.

Those mountains did resemble a man’s eyebrows.

How great the mountains were!

The area they covered was even broader than the Green Fire World.

However, they just looked like a man’s eyebrows!
