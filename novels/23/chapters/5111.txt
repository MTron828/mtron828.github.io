Clang! Dong! Whoosh!

“Attack!”

With a rumble, a thunderous shout erupted from the void.

Sounds from the ancient past filled the air, like the resonating echoes of a long, ancient blade. Their grey, weathered armor had long since fallen into disrepair, but in this moment, their decaying bodies seemed to rekindle the essence of ancient times.

Jian Wushuang, expressionless, gazed at the approaching phantoms of the Immortal skeletons. His body was enveloped by the gentle yet incredibly sharp Buddhist light emitted by the five Monks, even affecting the karmic calamity within him.

“Kind Sir, seize this opportunity to break free. We shall protect you; there’s no need to worry.”

The burly Monk, with a sudden burst of golden light behind him, may have only been a Three Revolutions, but the Buddha Image Form behind him was as strong as a Six Revolutions warrior. The combined strength of the five Monks created an unmatched force.

“You’re all sacrificing yourselves!” Jian Wushuang’s voice trembled. These Monks were indeed as stubborn as Yu Chang had described; they were determined to protect him and the young samanera, charging through the army of skeletons and into the Great Si Region.

He was originally a Yan Immortal from the Great Si Region, tasked with repairing the boundary wall in the Great Desolate Wilderness. Even if they managed to break through the front lines of the skeletal army, they would still face the boundless desolation. Without Yu Chang’s guidance, it was a dead end.

Moreover, beneath the piles of skeletal corpses lay a truly unbeatable existence. The explosive aura of Yan power in the Great Desolate Wilderness was something they could not contend with.

“You have already saved my life. I promise to fulfill your request. There’s no need for you to sacrifice yourselves to protect me.”

Jian Wushuang’s Sword Intent surged, and his Yan power suddenly manifested, restoring him to his peak strength. At this moment, his combat power was no less than that of the five Monks combined.

In the void, there suddenly arose a series of roars!

“Zhen Wuyang! Zhen Wuyang! Zhen Wuyang!”

Heart-wrenching shouts echoed, causing the skeletal army in the void to pause and turn towards the direction of the voices, kneeling down.

“We humbly welcome our Lord!”

“We humbly welcome our Lord!”

“We humbly welcome our Lord!”

Just as the skeletal army knelt, Jian Wushuang’s sharp eyes flickered. He immediately transmitted, “Now is the time! Follow me!”

The five Monks, who had initially prepared to face death, hesitated briefly, then followed Jian Wushuang, swiftly disappearing into the void.

They moved at an incredible speed, causing ripples in the void.

During their escape, the burly Monk had already concealed his Buddhist Image Form and furrowed his brows as he asked, “Kind Sir, why are we fleeing in the opposite direction? Ahead lies our Heaven-Reaching Buddhist Realm.” The young samanera held onto Jian Wushuang’s arm and looked up at him.

“We came from the Heaven-Reaching Buddhist Realm and traversed the entire Great Desolate Wilderness. It’s fraught with danger, and a significant portion of the undead army is clearly on this side.”

The Monks all wore anxious expressions. They weren’t afraid of death, but they feared dying without purpose. Even if all of them died while ensuring one person survived, it would be worthwhile. However, if they followed Jian

Wushuang and died in the boundless wilderness while fleeing towards the Heaven-Reaching Buddhist Realm, it would be a grave sin.

They had originally come from the Heaven-Reaching Buddhist Realm, bound for the distant Great Si Region, to perform the supreme merit of converting and enlightening Yan Immortals. Now, abandoning countless eons of cultivation just to stay alive was a complete deviation from their path. Unconsciously, Jian Wushuang had led them astray, causing them to feel uneasy.

But when they thought of the countless undead army they had encountered earlier, they knew that no matter which way they ran, their chances of survival were slim.

Jian Wushuang, with little young samanera in tow, looked back with a fierce expression, then continued to dash towards the Great Desolate Wilderness with undiminished speed.

“Have you not sensed a powerful pressure awakening nearby?”

The Monks showed signs of alarm. They were all third-level Grand Yan

Immortals, with strong sensory abilities, but the pressure they felt was elusive.

“No, that pressure isn’t coming from the undead army, nor the formidable armored warrior.”

The clean-shaven Monk, trembling, said, “Second brother, I’ve sensed it. It’s emanating from the void in the direction of the Great Si Region, beneath the undead.”

The group gasped. The oppressive aura from the terrifying being awakening was comparable to the countless undead, indicating its immense power.

“Such terrifying pressure… It’s as strong as nature itself, with grand ultimate power. W-we’re very fortunate that we have your guidance, Kind Sir. Otherwise, encountering such a being, we would have been instantly obliterated.”Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

When the Monks looked at Jian Wushuang again, they were certain he was a top-level cultivator from the Great Si Region, at least as powerful as a Six Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal.

Crack!

Shortly after their amazement, in a brief moment of silence, one of the undead, comparable to a Grand Yan Immortal, suddenly turned its neck and looked at the fleeing group. Its jet-black eyes instantly turned crimson. In an instant, all the kneeling undead turned their heads.

The leading skeletal warriors’ eyes shifted.

“I will wait here for my Lord, and you all go ahead and exterminate the lackeys of Zhen Wuyang. Don’t let a single one escape.”

“Yes!”

Below, countless skeletons stiffly moved, but the terrifying aura that erupted afterward shattered the entire void.

The hideous crack in the boundary wall was also expanding rapidly, although it couldn’t completely tear apart the entire boundary wall, it became severely damaged.

Countless skeletons surged forward, attacking Jian Wushuang and the others.

The leader was a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals with a severely damaged head, with only a crimson eye and a few pale fangs remaining.

“Obey orders, kill the traitor!”

Boom!

A skeleton warrior held a broken armor spear, with black bloodstains still visible on top.

As they looked at the fleeing group, he tilted his body backward and then hurled the spear heavily towards Jian Wushuang and the others.

The horrifying gray-white spear, in the void, unleashed its power. It shattered the mirror-like void at first, then broke through the shattered void like a mirror, appearing in front of the group in an instant.

Jian Wushuang, holding the young samanera in one hand, abruptly stopped his movement. He stood tall in the void, holding his sword in reverse. His long disheveled hair covered his eyes, but he still saw the spear that was now right in front of him.

His sword instantly struck out, unleashing furious Sword Qi, but it was unable to block the fierce attack of the spear.

“Kind Sir, I’ll assist you!”

The rugged Monk raised his hand and a gigantic golden palm appeared with a burst of golden light. It first entered the void and then shattered it.

In this moment, the rugged Monk exerted all his strength, knowing that now was not the time to hold back.

First one palm, then another, in just an instant, countless palm prints covered the entire void. They overlapped one after another, millions of palms facing the oncoming spear.

“Thousand-Hand Union of the Buddhist Sect.’

“This is the Great Freedom!”

In this moment, the rugged Monk unleashed an unprecedented aura..
