Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

Such a huge power directly sealed the space-time around the Mountain Thunder Fort, creating a shocking disturbance. Naturally, the Lord of the Mountain Thunder Fort was the first to be alarmed.

“Who is it? who dares to seal the space-time around my Mountain Thunder Fort?” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

A low shout suddenly exploded in the world. Following that, a figure rushed out from the depths of the Earth and appeared in the void outside the Mountain Thunder Fort.

A green-clothed Mountain Thunder Fort Master with long hair fluttering in the wind had an aura that had reached the limit of a True Saint. He was a genuine Invincible Saint, and his strength was extremely tyrannical.

However, when he appeared in the void outside and saw the three figures at the end of his line of sight, the Mountain Thunder Fort Master’s face instantly turned extremely pale.

“Prin-Principles Master?”

“And there are a total of three of them?”

Mountain Thunder Fort Master stared at the three Principles Masters in front of him in great astonishment, feeling his head rumbling.

Although he was indeed an Invincible Saint, an Invincible Saint could only be invincible among the Immortal Saints. However, compared to a true Principles Master, he was far, far inferior. Mountain Thunder Fort Master had some confidence in his own strength, however, this confidence had not reached the point where he dared to face a Principles Master head-on.

What’s more, there were three Principles Masters in front of him.

“Mountain Thunder pays his respects to the three lords. May I know why the three lords have come?” The Lord of the Mountain Thunder Fort said respectfully.

“Mountain Thunder?” The three Principles Master stared at Mountain Thunder with interest. They had never heard of the name Mountain Thunder. As for the strength of that Invincible Saint, Mountain Thunder, they did not put him in their eyes at all.

“My lords, my master is the Lord of Thunder Bugs. He has quite a bit of contact with some of the major figures of the three great saints. If Mountain Thunder has offended you in any way, I hope that you will spare him on account of my master.” The Lord of Mountain Thunder Fort lowered his head, his attitude was extremely low.

He had no idea why these three Principles Masters had come. But since they had already come and sealed spacetime, they definitely were not just passing by casually, thus, Mountain Thunder Fort Master had brought out his backer from the very beginning.

He, Mountain Thunder Fort Master, had been able to roam freely in the First Heaven for so long and had been doing whatever he wanted. He was still alive and well, not only because he was strong, but also because his backer, the Thunder Bug Master, was really amazing, he was quite famous in the Divine Beginning World.

“The Thunder Bug Master?”

The three Principles Masters looked at each other and could not help but smile.

They did know the Thunder Bug Master. After all, the Sorcerer God’s Sect had a close relationship with the three holy regions, and the Thunder Bug Master had a good relationship with the three holy regions.

“The three of us didn’t come here for you. Moreover, the three of us will give your master some face. So as long as you listen to us, we won’t make things difficult for you and your Mountain Thunder Fort,” said the handsome red-haired man.

“Thank you, my lords. What can I do for you?” The Mountain Thunder Fort Lord immediately became attentive.

“The three of us came here to find a person. If nothing unexpected happens, this person will hide in your Mountain Thunder Fort. How about this, you ask everyone in the Mountain Thunder Fort to come out first.” The red-haired handsome man said.

“Yes, my lords. Please wait a moment.” The Mountain Thunder Fort Lord immediately gave the order for all the cultivators in the Mountain Thunder Fort to come out.

The Mountain Thunder Fort was very big, and there were many cultivators in it. Most of them were captured alive by this Mountain Thunder Fort Lord. Now, under the orders of the Mountain Thunder Fort Lord, these cultivators all appeared in the void in front of the ancient castle, there were actually thousands of cultivators standing there densely.

“So many people?”

The red-haired handsome man frowned.

Although the three of them could sense the general location of the Heavenly Sword Marquis from the blood-red talisman they got from the prophet, they could not find him.

Now, they followed their senses and came to the Mountain Thunder Fort. However, there were so many cultivators in the Mountain Thunder Fort, so they could only slowly search for him.

“I saw the scene of Heavenly Sword Marquis fighting. His realm is only at the rank four True Saint Realm. Even if he used a secret technique, he could only reach the rank five True Saint Realm…” The red-haired handsome man pondered for a moment, then, he ordered, “Tell all the rank four and rank five True Saints to step forward.”

“Yes.” The Mountain Thunder Fort Master nodded.

Under his order, all the cultivators of the Mountain Thunder Fort who had reached the rank four and rank five True Saint stepped forward.

There were nearly 100 cultivators of the rank four and rank five of Mountain Thunder Fort, including Jian Wushuang, who had disguised himself as a tough man.

“Something’s wrong!”

Jian Wushuang stood in the crowd and narrowed his eyes.

At first, he thought that the strong enemies were here to cause trouble for the Mountain Thunder Fort, but now it seemed that they were not!

“They are not here to cause trouble for the Mountain Thunder Fort, but to find someone in the Mountain Thunder Fort, and the person they are looking for is between a rank four and a rank five True Saint… There are three Principles Masters who have personally taken action and used great means to directly seal space and time. With such a big arm, they are just looking for a rank four or rank five True Saint. Are they really here to find me?” Jian Wushuang was also nervous.

“All of you, step forward one by one.” The red-haired handsome man held a scarlet token in his hand and coldly glanced at the nearly 100 rank four and five True Saints in front of him.

These rank four and five True Saints did not dare to disobey him at all and immediately stepped forward one by one.

The red-haired handsome man held the scarlet token in his hand and tested them one by one. As a result, the scarlet token did not change at all when the rank four or five cultivators passed by.

After dozens of cultivators passed by, it was finally Jian Wushuang’s turn.

“I hope they are not looking for me, or else…I’ll be in big trouble!”

Jian Wushuang muttered in his heart. On the surface, he took a deep breath and slowly walked toward the three Principles Masters in front of him.

Just as he walked to the red-haired handsome man, the result was…

Buzz!

The blood-red token in the red-haired handsome man’s hand suddenly burst with blood light. A large amount of blood light even showed signs of covering Jian Wushuang.

“What?” Jian Wushuang’s face suddenly changed.

“It’s him!” Countless cultivators in the Mountain Thunder Fort, including the Mountain Thunder Fort Master, also locked their eyes on Jian Wushuang.

“Haha, I finally found you, Heavenly Sword Marquis!” The red-haired handsome man also stared at Jian Wushuang with burning eyes and laughed.

“Damn it! They really came for me.” Jian Wushuang’s face had become extremely ugly.

As for the many cultivators in Mountain Thunder Fort, they were all shocked when they heard the red-haired handsome man call out his name..
