Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation¬†¬† Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

‚ÄúDamn it!‚Äù Zhen Wuyang cursed angrily. The current situation was far from favorable for them. Dongyan was on the verge of collapse, and Feng MO on this side was struggling to lift its head. He couldn‚Äôt unleash his true strength in such a short time.

This was Liu Ya‚Äôs Dao Arena. While fighting against Liu Ya here, he was constantly rejected by the Dao of the Great Desolate Wilderness, suppressing his power by 30 percent.

Meanwhile, Heaven-Reaching Buddha sat above, calm and composed. The power of the Thousand Treasures Kasaya was enough to rival 16 Divine Generals.

There were only a few among them who were at the middle tier 3. If it were not for the Qishen Hall, Heaven-Reaching Buddha would have killed them in an instant.

‚ÄúWuliang, Dongyan is in dire straits. Hurry and send reinforcements,‚Äù Heaven-Reaching Buddha said calmly, still leisurely allowing Wuliang, a tier 3 Emperor, to deal with the tier 4 Emperor Daogong.

The allure of the Qishen Temple was immense. Just a few pieces of information from Zhen Wuyang were enough to throw the entire original universe into chaos. They were only the first batch; he had never thought of breaking the Qishen Temple now. He would wait until everyone gathered and then explore the temple together.

From the initial stage of the original universe, he had come to the Qishen Temple in the Great Si Region. It was not that simple. There was probably someone behind all of this.

Even though he guarded the Heaven-Reaching Buddhist Realm all year round, he was well-informed. The tier 5 Emperors had all left the original universe for the River of Time and Space. There was an even greater secret within. The origin of the original universe had started to dissipate when it was born, and now, countless chaos cycles had passed, and the origin was almost depleted.

Inside the Primitive Universe was a powerful being, the Forbidden Demon Lord, who had once dominated the River of Time and Space. If the origin were depleted, and the Forbidden Demon Lord emerged, the original universe would have no choice but to migrate.

The Forbidden Demon Lord was a powerful life form born from the River of Time and Space. It appeared in every cycle of time. In the previous cycle, it appeared in their original universe, swallowing the entire universe. The Forbidden Creature was suppressed to the core of the original universe by the Supreme Rules.

This information was known to very few, only a few tier 5 Emperors and a handful of tier 4 Rulers were aware of it.Follow the latest novels ùíêùíè nùíê/velbin(.)com

The being who created the Buddhist Sect left the original universe after the fragmentation of the Celestial Realm. When he left, he left behind this Cycle Reincarnation Scripture.

That being deduced the future, used the Eye of Heavenly Mechanics to see the future of the original universe. In the future, the original universe was a

traceless starry sky. The entire universe was devoured by the Forbidden Creature, and the Emperors in the universe fled with the Great Yan Immortals. All other life was obliterated.

Even with foresight of the future, that being left the original universe. For that being, this universe would soon perish, not worth staying here.

The Forbidden Creatures were terrifying existences that all experts feared in the River of Time and Space.

For a universe without a master, it represented destruction.

Now, with the sudden appearance of the Qishen Temple, could it be a chance bestowed by the supreme rules, allowing the original universe to overcome this calamity?

Tongtian Buddha pondered this, his gaze sweeping over the many emperors in the Qishen Temple, then shifting to Daogong and Liuyan.

In the end, he shook his head.

Among this group, none were saviors.

What Tongtian Buddha didn‚Äôt know was that the Buddhist leader who foresaw the future in those years was eventually killed by the supreme rules and then reincarnated.

Fate was shackled, and the supreme rules left a glimmer of vitality.

Eventually, the Qishen Temple drifted through countless cycles in the river of time and arrived in the original universe.

This grand gift was a chance given by the supreme rules to the original universe. If grasped, it could give birth to a universe master in this era. If not, be prepared to escape!

The slim chance left by the supreme rules, apart from a universe master, no one could drive away that forbidden devil lord. Thus, there was a great possibility of a universe master emerging in this era.

Tongtian Buddha, who had comprehended all this, squinted his eyes. In his view, among all the people present, only Zhen Wuyang had a slight chance. No matter how he looked at others, they were not beings destined to achieve the great path.

Everything had its predestined outcome!

The Qishen Temple would definitely not leave the original universe, so there was no need for him to stay above.

But watching the tigers fight from above was leisurely for him. As for the small fry below, the more deaths, the better, saving him from dealing with those opportunistic fellows.

The many Emperors outside the Qishen Temple, under the protection of Donglin, could only watch a few fourth-tier Emperors battle. He never imagined that in the current great war, even third-tier Emperors couldn‚Äôt intervene.

As for Heaven-Reaching Buddha‚Äôs words about rescuing Emperor Dongyan, they pretended not to hear. Who would be foolish enough to battle a fourth-tier Emperor now?

Even though Daogong was at the bottom among the fourth-tier Emperors, those at the third-tier were far from being his match.

Liu Ya, as the Dao Ancestor of the Great Desolate Wilderness, had been watching closely. Not only did he single-handedly bring Feng MO to the brink of collapse, but he also had the energy to deal with Zhen Wuyang. If they dared to show themselves, they would probably be instantly killed by Liu Ya.

In the distance, Emperor Dongyan couldn‚Äôt hold on any longer. The power of the whisk seemed limitless, steadily rising. At first, he was relaxed, but as time passed, the force of the whisk grew, compressing his own strength bit by bit. In this contest, he quickly couldn‚Äôt endure it anymore. The defensive formation around the eye of the array began to shatter. Without the protection of the formation, he couldn‚Äôt hold out against Daogong for more than a few breaths.

The Yan Divine Array had nine eyes of the array, and he was hiding in one of them. However, the Great Desolate Wilderness indeed had Dao Ancestors, and Liu Ya directly found his position. He ordered Daogong to kill him. Once he died, the other eyes of the array would naturally be easily destroyed.

Emperor Dongyan now regretted not breaking the Whisk Array himself. Then, he could have used instant movement to escape.

‚ÄúAh! Ah! Ah!‚Äù Endless pressure enveloped his body. Emperor Dongyan couldn‚Äôt hold on any longer. He never expected that he would be trapped by his own formation, creating his own tomb.

Boom!

The eye of the array‚Äôs defensive formation was shattered, and Emperor Dongyan‚Äôs true body was revealed. Just as he was about to beg for mercy, he was enveloped entirely by the whisk.

‚ÄúThose who spy on the Qishen Temple, die!‚Äù Daogong shouted angrily.

The power of the Feather Duster surged again. Without defensive formations, Emperor Dongyan was like thin paper, instantly crushed.

This was the difference in strength!

Although Dongyan was a top third-tier power, facing a fourth-tier Emperor, even Daogong, who was at the bottom of the fourth-tier, had no difficulty defeating him.

Fighting above one‚Äôs tier might happen in the realm of Grand Yan Immortals, but it absolutely did not occur among Emperors.

In the realm of Grand Yan Immortals, there might be instances of fighting above one‚Äôs tier due to some external treasures. However, after becoming Emperors, their strength relied on their comprehension of the Dao.

Those who could fight above their tier among Emperors were unheard of in the original universe.

Perhaps the ancestors of the Ancient God Clan could achieve this, but that old fellow became a fourth-tier Emperor the moment he became an Emperor. At that time, the original universe didn‚Äôt even have fifth-tier emperors..
