4667 Coffin-Carrying Cultivator

By the time nearly 1,000 cultivators barged into the teahouse, the tea had already gone cold.

This small incident ended with the departure of Jian Wushuang and the others.

As for the Frost Crow lady, who had been redeemed, he stayed by his side out of compassion.

After leaving the star area, Jian Wushuang did not stop and went to the other worlds to look for possible clues.

No one knew how long this seemingly endless search would last.

Jian Wushuang had also made up his mind. If he could not find Lu Ding’s clay idol within a million years, he would stop the matter and rush back to the Cloud Palace.

The extremely weak Frost Crow lady followed him, and her lifespan, which was only 1,000 years, was extended. At the same time, she broke through the shackles of fate and embarked on the path of cultivation.

100,000 years later, three black-robed figures stood under an extremely remote starry sky, looking at the dead silent and cold Star Field.

Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice, “Han Ya, are you sure this is the place?”

The Frost Crow woman, whom he had saved and given a simple name, had her eyes tightly shut. Her five senses were spreading throughout the world.

A moment later, Han Ya opened her eyes and nodded firmly. “My Lord, the aura of death came from here.”

There were thousands of Great Dao, and the Frost Crow’s perception of living creatures’ aura was far superior to the other races. This was why the condensed bead in the Frost Crow clan’s head had become a spirit treasure that cultivators were after like crazy.

Jian Wushuang had discovered this by chance, which saved him a lot of time.

Since the Lu Ding clay idol did not show its shape, Jian Wushuang changed his way of thinking and began to search for the Star Field with the heaviest death Qi.

After searching for a while, he found that more than 100 major heavenly regions had been turned into dead regions.

Without saying anything more, the three figures stepped into the Star Domain that was filled with death Qi.

“Eh, something’s not right. The death Qi here is so dense, but why don’t I see any dead spirits? Instead, it’s as prosperous as an ordinary market?”

As he landed on the street, Jian Wushuang looked at the crowd of cultivators and could not help but wonder.

“Han Ya, are you sure the death Qi is the densest here?”

Han Ya was confused as well. “S-Sir, I can clearly feel that this is the place. How can there still be so many living people?”

Jian Wushuang was also puzzled. Could it be that this place was the same as the God-Refining Sect in the Voido Universe, where death Qi was used as the foundation for cultivation?

He seemed to have noticed something and glanced at the cultivators on the street.

They seemed to be surrounding him?

Although Jian Wushuang was a little puzzled, he was already on guard.

The next moment, a clear voice sounded above the three of them.

“I say, you barged into this place without permission. Don’t you want to live?”

Looking over, they saw a young cultivator carrying a coffin on his back on the roof of a tavern, looking at them lazily.

After that, the young cultivator suddenly jumped up, picked up the extremely exaggerated coffin on his back, and smashed it down!

The coffin, which contained a violent divine power, smashed down and sent the dense group of cultivators around him flying nearly a hundred meters away.

At the same time, the young cultivator stepped on the coffin and shouted, “Come with me if you want to live. Otherwise, your lives will be in danger.”

With that, the young cultivator picked up the coffin that had fallen to the ground and acted as the vanguard to smash the cultivators who had surrounded him again.

All the cultivators who were hit by the coffins were scattered like dirt and disappeared.

At that moment, even the Han Ya sensed that something was wrong. It turned out that these cultivators, who were no different from living people, had no divine souls.

Jian Wushuang and Old Master looked at each other and confirmed for the first time that Lu Ding’s clay idol might be hidden in this Star Field.

In order to avoid alerting the enemy, they did not release their respective powers. Instead, they quickly followed behind the young cultivator who was holding the coffin like a hammer.

Jian Wushuang had a whole new level of respect for him because of his power at the Ultimate Ruler realm. After all, it was an amazing thing to cultivate to such a realm where divine power was extremely thin in a Star Field so far away.

In the hands of that cultivator, the huge coffin seemed to have become a powerful weapon that had never failed. Every time it smashed down, nearly a hundred cultivators who had lost their souls were annihilated.

In the next half a day, the young cultivator showed his might and quickly eliminated all the cultivators in the area.

Just in case, the three of them sat on the roof under his instructions.

“Tell me, how did you get here? I don’t see that your realm is very high. Could it be that you’re also the survivors of this place like me?” the young cultivator looked at the three of them and asked with a gloomy expression.

Jian Wushuang did not answer his question. Instead, he asked with a puzzled look, “What happened here? Why is the death Qi so dense? Why did those cultivators attack us?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

When the young cultivator heard this, he could not help but sigh. “That’s because everyone here is dead, including the cultivators who attacked you just now. They’re all dead.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang had a clear idea. “Then do you know what happened in this realm, the cause and effect?”

“Of course I do. Although it has been hundreds of thousands of years since it happened, I still remember it clearly.” The young cultivator said, “Do you want to know?”

“Please explain, this is a matter of great importance.”

“It’s no big deal. I haven’t talked to an outsider for more than 100,000 years. It’s just to relieve my boredom.”

The young cultivator heaved a sigh of relief and began to explain.

“A few hundred thousand years ago, this place could be considered to be in the prime of cultivation, and all the sects were at their peak. It’s not like now, where it has become a dead zone. It was all because of that day.”

As if reminiscing, the young cultivator’s eyes were filled with fear.

“That day, the entire sky was replaced by darkness. Even the sun was swallowed up, and then a strange, ferocious face replaced the entire sky.”

“The moment that hideous face opened its mouth, all the divine power in the world and the aura of living beings were sucked away by it. Not a single cultivator could escape from it.”

“I only realized that a grand robbery was coming when I saw them turning into empty shells without their souls.”

“Because the dharmic formulation I’ve learned is extremely unique, it can barely change life and death. It’s because of this that I hid in the coffin and escaped this calamity.”

“Speaking of which, I’ve only awoken from my coffin in recent years and have been living alone in this world until now.” The young cultivator’s face was expressionless, as if he was narrating someone else’s story.
