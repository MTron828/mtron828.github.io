“Strong!”

Jian Wushuang stared at the Fire Puppet. He had not yet fully recovered from the shock.

“Our fight is brief, and during the fight, I even did not have a chance to strike back. This Fire Puppet is indeed much stronger than me,”?thought Jian Wushuang.

“Gu King, you’ve just told me that this Fire Puppet’s battle strength is close to that of a top-notch Universe God.” Jian Wushuang groaned. “But during the previous fight, I felt that its levels are far above those of a Universe God. This Fire Puppet is much more powerful than the monarch of the Jin Kingdom.”

“There’s an amazing gap between the top-notch Universe Gods and the ordinary ones. The top-notch Universe Gods can easily finish off a bunch of ordinary Universe Gods. In terms of battle strength, the monarch of the Jin Kingdom is only a middle level and much weaker than those top-notch gods, but this Fire Puppet has almost steped into the Peak Realm of a Universe God. No doubt it’s a much tougher opponent than the monarch,” Gu King explained.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang responded.

As a Martial Arts cultivator, he quickly understood that.

“Jian Wushuang.” The monarch’s voice was heard again. “You do have an impressive talent in cultivation. I’ve never met a cultivator more gifted than you in the Eternal Chaotic World. But unfortunately, you can not take my life.

“I lost the fight today, but I hope that you’ll never naively think that the Green Fire Palace can occupy this vast battlefield forever. Do not forget that I’m from the Eternal Chaotic World and I’m an influential figure there. It’ll not take long before I invite several of my good friends here. At that time, let’s see how you’re going to stop us.”

With these words, the monarch of the Jin Kingdom laughed loudly.

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned colder and sharper.

“He must die!”?Jian Wushuang gave off a strong sense of killing intent.

He knew that the Green Fire World would never be in peace as long as the monarch of the Jin Kingdom was alive.

To kill the monarch, he must get rid of this Fire Puppet first.

Considering his current strength, he thought that there was only one way to achieve that goal.

“Boom.” Jian Wushuang’s aura began to swell and flow. Meanwhile, another unique power inside his body was surging.

“Jian Wushuang, are you going to use that technique?” Gu King asked.

“Yeah,” Jian Wushuang nodded gravely. “Only in this way, can my strength be suddendly increased by ten times. With that strength, I’ll be able to get rid of the Fire Puppet and finish off the monarch of the Jin Kingdom.”

“It’s feasible, but you can not maintain that strength for a long time. You’ll have to hurry up,” Gu King warned.

“I know,” Jian Wushuang responded, his eyes sparkled with resolution. The next moment, a unique power hidden inside him burst out.

This was the Stars Power.

Jian Wushuang was exerting Secret Skills of Stars!

Only disciples of Lineage of Star from Star Palace who had passed the ultimate trial on Star Island were qualified to practice this overwhelming Secret Skills of Star Palace.

The Secret Skills were recorded in three volumes, and now Jian Wushuang was displaying the techniques in the first one.

As soon as the Secret Skills of Stars took effect, Jian Wushuang felt the increased powers.

“I have to finish this within ten breaths!”?Jian Wushuang clenched his fists.

“Kill!”

Without any hesitation, Jian Wushuang dashed toward the monarch.

“Fire Puppet, stop him!” the monarch of the Jin Kingdom commanded.

Fire Puppet came at Jian Wushuang with its silver long spear.

Jian Wushuang confronted it, his Blood Mountain Sword in his hand emitting blazing light.

Fire Puppet had outclassed Jian Wushuang in their previous fights.

Nevertheless, now Jian Wushuang was not weaker than the Fire Puppet. Instead, he even seemed a little bit stronger than it. Besides, Jian Wushuang was also versed in the use of a sword.

Puppet Fighter was just a puppet.

Although puppets boasted impressive strength and defensive power, they lacked flexibility and techniques in fighting compared to human cultivators. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Now they were well-matched regarding battle strength. However, with resorting to his extraordinary sword skills, Jian Wushuang had only spent four-breath time throwing Fire Puppet away.

“Only six breaths left!”

Jian Wushuang gazed at the monarch of the Jin Kingdom, his eyes filled with a strong killing intent. As soon as he got rid of the Fire Puppet, he came at the monarch.

“That’s bad!”

The monarch of the Jin Kingdom panicked when he saw Jian Wushuang rapidly approaching him. He understood everything from the murderous look in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“Run. I have to escape now!”

The monarch turned around and fled away. At the same time, he gave orders to the Fire Puppet, “Hurry! Stop him. Stop him now!”

However, after taking the blow, the Fire Puppet was now far away from Jian Wushuang. When it stood up and came at Jian Wushuang again, it was already too late for it to stop him.

Jian Wushuang was faster than the monarch of the Jin Kingdom. Now with the assistance of Stars Power, his speed boosted up.?Although the monarch was on the run with his full strength, Jian Wushuang still managed to get closer and closer to him.

50,000 killometers!

45,000 kilometers!

40,000 kilometers!

The monarch used to be at least several thousands of kilometers away from Jian Wushuang, but now Jian Wushuang was catching up quickly.

Time fled away when Jian Wushuang was hunting down the monarch.

His Secret Skills of Star Palace could only last ten breaths. It had taken him four breaths to get rid of the Fire Puppet. Now he had only six breaths left.

During the process of pursuing, he was secretly counting down the breaths he had.?“Five, four, three!”

At last, Jian Wushuang caught up with the monarch of the Jin Kingdom.

Now, he was left with only one-breath time before the Secret Skill of Stars lost its effect.

“One breath is enough!”?thought Jian Wushuang.

He stared at the monarch’s back, a strong killing intent flickering in his eyes.

“Spell of Disturbance!”

“Whirring… ” Fierce gales enveloped the monarch.

Jian Wushuang brandished his sword with his full strength.

Spell of Disturbance was not a unique skill. However, once the practitioner used it properly, it could be more formidable than a unique skill.

Besides, Jian Wushuang had used the Secret Skills of Stars at the same time.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Streaks of sword light were shot out, and they quickly covered the monarch.

“No!!!”

The monarch gave off a sad, shrill roar while desperately warding off those sword lights.

However…
