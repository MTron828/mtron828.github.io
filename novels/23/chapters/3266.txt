Outside the Blood Wave Realm, in another base of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

In the gray void, a barefoot, child-like person stood in front of a huge crystal.

On the crystal, there were densely packed words. These words were a list of experts, and this child-like person was writing this list. However, during this process, his brows suddenly furrowed, his hands stopped moving.

“Lord Tong.”

A loud voice rang out, and a two-meter tall bald old man appeared in the gray void.

“Chi Huo.” The child raised his head and glanced at the bald old man. “How come you have time to come here?”

“I just happened to pass by here, and I saw you looking rather distressed. Why? Did you run into trouble?” The bald old man looked at the child.

“Isn’t it because of the True Saint List?” The child curled his lips, he said, “The Blood Wave Realm has opened, and countless top saints have gone to fight for the opportunities within. Many experts on the True Saint List have also participated in it. After fighting for it again and again, new experts have appeared one after another. Naturally, the rankings on the True Saint List have to be updated frequently.”

“Since the Blood Wave Realm opened, I’ve updated the True Saint List several times. It’s not a big deal, but this time, there’s a person’s ranking. I don’t know how to arrange it.”

The True Saint List had been issued by the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, the number one Freedom Alliance of the Divine Beginning Realm, for a long time. Moreover, it had always been very authoritative. As long as a new True Saint List was released, almost no one would question the rankings on it.

And as Tong Jun, who was in charge of gathering intelligence and updating the True Saint List, of course, he would be extremely cautious about changing the ranking on the True Saint List.

“Who is it that you don’t know how to arrange?” The bald old man asked.

“Other than Heavenly Sword Marquis, who else?”

Tong Jun’s voice was low and deep, “This Heavenly Sword Marquis is very strange. Although he has relied on his invincible life-saving ability and the number one assassination ability to make many Immortal Saints in the Blood Wave Realm fearful, his true combat strength is only at the level of an Invincible Saint. Such a person shouldn’t be ranked on the True Saint List. However, not long ago, Heavenly Sword Marquis suddenly went crazy and killed the Nine Temples Saintess, who was ranked fifth on the True Saint List!”

“Nine Temples Saintess couldn’t even be killed by the Light King, but Heavenly Sword Marquis did. So I don’t know how to identify him. He killed Nine Temples Saintess, so it doesn’t make sense for him not to be ranked on the True Saint List. But if he is ranked on the True Saint List...based on the terrifying sword attack he used to kill Nine Temples Saintess, he is even more terrifying than Light King. He can definitely be ranked first, but his strength is obviously not at that level!”

Tong Jun was indeed troubled.

It was because Jian Wushuang was not very strong himself, but only had a strong trump card.

But a trump card was also a kind of strength.

Just like the Old Valley Master of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, the Old Valley Master was not very strong herself, but because she had mastered the supreme divine skill of the Supreme Emotion-forgetting Valley, if she really went crazy...even the three Supreme Saint Masters of the three Saint Realms would have scruples.

Jian Wushuang was obviously in this delicate state. He was not very strong, but his trump card was even weaker than that of the Light King.

Because of this, it was even more difficult to rank him.

“Haha, it’s actually not difficult.” The bald old man laughed, “With the Heavenly Sword Marquis’ methods, he should be on the True Saint List. However, you don’t have to rank him first. Instead, based on his battle record, didn’t he kill the Nine Temples Saintess, who was ranked fifth on the True Saint List?

“Then why don’t we just let him replace the Nine Temples Saintess and rank him fifth?”

“Rank fifth?” Tong Jun’s expression changed, and then a smile appeared on his face. “Good idea. The ranking on the True Saint List is largely determined by one’s battle achievements. Take an ordinary person’s challenge as an example. If a person who is not on the True Saint List were to defeat an expert on the True Saint List, he would naturally be able to occupy the position of an expert on the True Saint List. Now that Heavenly Sword Marquis has killed the Nine Temples Saintess, he would occupy the fifth position of the Nine Temples Saintess. There’s no problem!”

Tong Jun smiled and soon began to write on the crystal.

After he finished writing, a new ranking on the True Saint List was immediately spread throughout the Blood Wave Realm.

In a temporary cave mansion in the Blood Wave Realm, Jian Wushuang, Emperor Ming, and Tie Ta were sitting at a stone table. There was wine on the table, and the three of them were drinking and laughing.

Suddenly, Emperor Ming’s expression changed. He looked at Jian Wushuang and said, “Congratulations, Brother Heavenly Marquis!”

“Congratulations on what?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“The new True Saint List has been released. Not only are you on the new list, but you’re also ranked fifth!” Emperor Ming said.

“Fifth on the True Saint List? Isn’t that the ranking of the Nine Temples Saintess?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Yes, it’s her ranking. In fact, I think it’s too low for you to be ranked fifth,” Underworld Emperor said.

“Don’t praise me. I know very well how strong I am.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Although you’re only ranked fifth, the evaluation of you on the list is quite high. You can take a look first,” Tie Ta said at this time.

“Really?” Jian Wushuang asked.

The changes in the rankings of the True Saint List were especially important to the experts in the Blood Wave Realm. Therefore, every time the new True Saint List was released, the Chaos Master would immediately pass it on to the people of the Temporal Temple, Jian Wushuang also received a complete True Saint List.

The first four rankings on the new True Saint List remained unchanged. However, the fifth position, which used to be the name of the Nine Temples Saintess, had now become Heavenly Sword Marquis. The following introduction about Heavenly Sword Marquis was plentiful.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, a special life form, a super genius rarely seen in the Divine Beginning Realm for hundreds of millions of years!”

Jian Wushuang was a little surprised by the first sentence.

“A special life form? A super genius rarely seen in hundreds of millions of years?” Jian Wushuang could not help touching his nose.

He was not surprised by this special life form. After all, whether it was his attack in the outside world or his amazing performance in the Blood Wave Realm when he was surrounded and killed by the experts of the three Saint Realms...it was enough to explain the uniqueness of his physique. Through that battle, the experts of the various forces in the Divine Beginning Realm could guess that his life-level was not ordinary. It was almost certain that he was a special life-form.

It was normal for the information of his ranking to announce that he was a special life-form.

As for the super genius who was rarely seen in billions of years, it was even more normal. After all, his ability to cross realms was there. At least, no one in the Divine Beginning Realm could have this talent.
