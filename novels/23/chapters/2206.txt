Whoosh! Whoosh!

Emperor Thirteen and Jian Wushuang appeared on this floating land.

Once he set foot on the land, Jian Wushuang looked up and saw a platform.

This platform was extremely big. There were ninety-nine-thousand nine-hundred-and-ninety-nine steps leading up to the platform.

At the end of the steps, at the top of the platform, stood a throne. There was a figure sitting on this throne.

It was a bold man with sharp eyebrows. His eyes looked as though they were the sun and moon. He sat there, looking down at everything with dignity. It was as though everything in this world submitted to him and he was the sole ruler of this world!

“Hehe...”

Jian Wushuang stared at the bold man on top of the platform.

That man looked familiar as his facial features were the same as the gigantic head.

Without a doubt, this was the owner of that gigantic head.

Suddenly, the man who sat on the throne looked down at Jian Wushuang. His eyes were moving slowly as though they were a galaxy. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Under that stare, Jian Wushuang felt that the world lost its colours.

The surrounding scene started to change quickly.

He was looking at the highest point in this world.

Here, it was as though he was standing beside Heaven.

Here, he saw the same bold man.

This man was unimaginably large.

“Is this how big he really is?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

The size of the head was already gigantic.

Green Fire World was at the centre of the forehead, but its size was negligible compared to the rest of the head.

If the head was already this big, then how big was his whole body...?

Jian Wushuang looked at the complete divine body of this bold man. He was amazed.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang noticed that this place was surrounded by thunderous clouds as a unique aura gathered and started to suppress him. It tried to tear him apart and annihilate him.

This aura was Heaven’s Will!

This bold man was making an enemy with Heaven’s Will!

Suddenly, the bold man looked up and his eyes burned with determination.

“I will fight the heavens, I will fight the earth. I will fight this world just to attain the Ultimate Doctrine!”

“If the heavens were to stop me, I would tear them apart!”

“If the earth were to stop me, I would split it apart!”

“If everyone in this world were to stop me, I would kill everyone!”

His majestic words forced the surrounding Heaven’s Will back a great distance.

You could hear the angry roars and shoutings, but none dared to continue their suppression.

“This...”

Jian Wushuang was stunned.

His head was dizzy at this unbelievable scene.

The man’s words were ringing in his ears.

“If the heavens were to stop me, I would tear them apart!”

“If the earth were to stop me, I would split it apart!”

“If everyone in this world were to stop me, I would kill everyone!”

How domineering was that?

How much confidence did that man have?

A single look forced back the Heaven’s Will!

In front of him, even Heaven’s Will had to give way!

Boom~~~

Jian Wushuang was still in shock as the scene changed.

This time, it was the scene of a vast battlefield.

The battle had long started on this battlefield.

The entire sky was tinted crimson red. The Heavens at the highest point of the battlefield had many cracks as water was leaking out from it. It was evident that there was a hole in the Heavens.

On the ground below, worlds started to crumble as infinite amounts of living things were annihilated and died instantly.

Many super powerful experts died in this battle. Many of their bodies turned into mountains or seas of blood.

This was the Ancient Battlefield, and this was the Ultimate Battle that had caused the end of the ancient past era.

The battle was nearing the end.

Many of the experts who were battling it out crazily stopped.

At the centre of the battlefield stood a humongous, bold man. A spear pierced through his chest and heart. This spear contained an incredible corrosive power which continuously corroded his divine body.

This injury should have been fatal.

However, he stood tall even though there was a spear through his body. The Heaven’s Will continually suppressed him from above. He scanned his surroundings. Everything within his vision subsided.

Aside from the suppression from Heaven’s Will, trillions of experts in the Divine Demon Realm and countless experts stood there, staring at him with great killing intent.

There were three people at the front.

The first man was a bald man in white cloak. He was constantly smiling and was barefooted. He stood there in the sunlight as white light flashed off his skin. He gave off a peaceful and holy vibe.

The second person was a woman in a crimson cloak. She had an extremely cold vibe and felt like no one could compare to her. She was just standing there, but many of the experts in the Divine Demon Realm wanted to bow down to her.

The last man was a demon king of his era. He wore purple armour and had a very big body. He held a crimson spear and was standing on top of his crimson dragon. He radiated a demonic aura.

These three experts fixed their gazes on the bold man with great killing intent. They were ready to deliver the killing blow.

Right then, the bold man said majestically.

“I lived my life proudly. How can I die at the hands of mere mortals like you?”

“Die... Along with me!!”

As soon as he finished speaking, his incredibly gigantic divine body started to crumble, starting from his limbs. Only his head was left.

Then, a terrifying power swept forth in all directions. The entire Ancient Battlefield threatened to crumble.

Heaven’s Will dissipated and Heaven cracked into pieces. The entire earth shattered.

It was an apocalypse!
