Chapter 5217: I’m Tianji, My Opportunities Are Limitless

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Between the Four Major Secret Realms, there was no chaotic flow of energy. The four great worlds were interconnected, and over the years, many formidable individuals from the other three realms had entered the Divine Tomb. Fortunately, the 13 guardians possessed peak-level strength at the tier 6 and could suppress these intruders at any moment. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Now, in order to initiate the trial, True Spirit immediately summoned eight guardians, instantly reducing the defensive power of the God’s Tomb Secret Realm to its lowest.

They were born to protect the Divine Tomb, but their former master had instructed them to obey True Spirit in all matters.

This left them with no choice but to comply.

“Alright, hurry! Don’t worry about the Divine Tomb; I’ve got everything under control!” The corners of True Spirit’s mouth twitched as his whiskers floated, his entire body bathed in the sea of origin source, thoroughly content.

While the guardians dared not openly rebel, their faces were ashen, and in their hearts, they sighed in silence. Their master hadn’t been dead for long, and True Spirit was already all-powerful, disregarding even their master’s physical remains, only concerned with enjoying himself in the sea of origin source.

A single strand of the universe’s origin source could make tens of thousands of Emperors feel saturated. This was the sea of origin source!

Even a pig could become a Grand Yan Immortal just by sleeping here.

Casually plucking out a strand of origin source could turn a pig into the origin source sea of an Emperor. Every time they came here, this old guy hurriedly rushed them away, not allowing them to stay a moment longer.

The guardians swallowed their grievances and continued to speak politely. “Yes! Your Excellency must be tired from your hard work. We won’t disturb you any longer.” Gradually, the guardians’ figures vanished within their tokens, disappearing without a trace.

The true spirit squinted his eyes and observed Hu Qing in the celestial canopy, a faint smile playing on his lips.

“Almost there, little one. You must keep striving!’

Among all the practitioners in the Original Universe, he could only find fewer than ten worth considering. What an honor it was.

If Jian Wushuang knew that he was the one the old man detested most in the Original Universe, he would probably be utterly disgusted.

In the celestial canopy, Hu Qing was drenched in sweat, the drops trickling down his smooth forehead.

He had lost track of time; the golden aura had been surrounding him all along.

But no matter what he tried, he couldn’t subdue it.

He had mastered every technique in this heritage, but that particular aura eluded his control.

“Reincarnation!”

Hu Qing murmured. This heritage was about reincarnation. He couldn’t remember how many times he had undergone it, but success still eluded him. What was true reincarnation? His divine body had been transformed according to the heritage, turning into a reincarnation divine body. Originally a mere hundredfold divine body, it had now escalated to ten thousandfold. Still, he couldn’t withstand that aura.

A 10,000-fold divine body—only Chishui in the Emperor category possessed such a unique Special Life Form. Among the Grand Yan Immortals, there were a few who had grown into 10,000-fold divine bodies. Each one rivaled the Grand Yan Immortals following the Ultimate Dao, possessing the strength of a half- step Emperor.

Huiqing was originally on the Ultimate Dao. Now, due to the reincarnation heritage, his divine body had reached the 10,000-fold level. When these two aspects merged, his future growth would definitely surpass those Special Life

Forms with 10,000-fold divine bodies. He would even outshine fellow practitioners of the same level and truly match an Emperor.

This kind of power and potential was precisely why True Spirit had high hopes for him. If he gave this heritage to someone else, they might not be able to handle it. Only Hu Qing could.

Because he was reincarnation incarnate; the heritage of reincarnation belonged to him and no one else.

The Qishen Temple had many heritages, but few were suitable for these practitioners. It wasn’t that the heritages were lacking, but rather, the practitioners were inadequate.

Even when given guidance step by step, they couldn’t accept it.

The inheritance that Hu Qing now accepted was incredibly suitable for his origin source, but it was extremely challenging, let alone for others.

Buzz!

A ripple surged in his origin source, making Huiqing tremble.

“Haha, little one, you can’t resist me. Originally, you were just a thread of my origin source reincarnated. Now it’s time for you to welcome your true self,” a voice echoed.

A thought crossed Hu Qings mind, and memories suppressed deep within him fused together, forming a man in a red robe who looked exactly like Hu Qing.

He had a red mark on his forehead, and his whole body was cloaked in red, even his eyes were crimson.

Hu Qings eyes snapped open. Since he couldn’t suppress it, he let that memory turn into an independent consciousness. It was time to settle this, ahead of schedule.

Whoosh!

In Hu Qings inner world, two versions of himself appeared.

One was the red-robed Hu Qing, a consciousness formed from memories, and the other was Hu Qings original consciousness. The two stared at each other from a distance.

“Virtuous!” sighed Huiqing.

The red-robed Huiqing snorted, “l am Tianji, with endless opportunities!”

The memory-formed Hu Qing understood, comprehending his past lives, but he chose not to dwell on them. He was born in this life, and he intended to sever all ties with his previous existence.

After giving birth to this life, he would completely cut off his connection with his previous life!

“You are not Tianji!” Hu Qing shook his head.

His clear eyes recalled the past, causing his expression to change dramatically.

Then he shouted, “Tianji is already dead, he’s gone!”

“Tianji, along with the ancient Heavenly Realm, dissipated into countless fragments. You are just a stray thought, daring to claim to be Tianji!’

Hui Qngs tone changed, becoming resolute and domineering, his voice resonating like a bell, emanating a sinister aura.

“You!” The red-robed Hu Qing was astonished. He hadn’t expected the other to know about Tianji!

Previously, during the revival of the Great Desolate Wilderness, the suppressed memories in Hu Qing’s heart were because of him. It was because of him that Hu Qing took the first step on the Dao again, reclaiming the Zen Great Dao.

In his view, Huiqings consciousness and soul realm should have been nothing more than a small fry, not even a match for a Grand Yan Immortal. How had he suddenly become so resolute? Moreover, the more he looked at Huiqing, the more he felt that the other was the true core. This shocked him greatly!

Hu Qing was right; he was not the main body of Tianji. He was just a stray thought formed from consciousness.

His luck wasn’t as good as Hu Qings. He successfully reincarnated, awakening after countless cycles.

Although there were opportunities in the Great Desolate Wilderness and his behind-the- scenes efforts, it was still the Emperor who talked about fortune!

Without fortune, where would all these opportunities come from?

“Little one, it seems you know quite a bit. However, don’t forget, your current strength is because of me. So, obediently let yourself be devoured!” The red-robed voice was cold. He had waited through countless cycles for this moment after Hu Qing suppressed him.

He wouldn’t give up, especially after being suppressed by Hu Qing. He knew that as Hu Qings strength grew, the suppression would increase. It was difficult for him to turn the tables. However, now that Hu Qing was no longer suppressing him due to accepting the inheritance, this was his last chance.

“I’ve said it before; 1 am not Tianji. Tianji is dead. Since you dare to claim the title of Tianji, then you shall die!” Hu Qings eyes were icy. As he spoke, the two figures clashed like gods and demons, their bodies unmoving while their consciousness transformed into swords and spears, engaging in a fierce battle as intense as anything in the outside world..
