Chapter 1541: Jian Wushuang and Real God Wu Bei

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the open space, many Universe Gods were looking at Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng with puzzled expressions.

Both of them had passed the third test. However, there was only one White Blaze Fruit tree for this test. Hence, how could it be split?

“I don’t really care. The White Blaze Fruits is useless to me; you can have it,” Duan Lingfeng said.

“How can you do this?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

The White Blaze Fruit tree was indeed useless to Duan Lingfeng. However, he could give the White Blaze Fruit tree to the Almighties as they would definitely be willing to pay a high price for it.

“There’s no changing my mind. If you think that you owe me, then I shall treat it as you owing me a big favor. If I were to ask you for help if I am ever in trouble, it’s will alright as long as you don’t decline,” Duan Lingfeng said.

“Of course,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head immediately, “If you, Duan Lingfeng, were to be in trouble in the future, as long as it doesn’t go against my intentions, I, Jian Wushuang, will definitely do my best or even put my life on the line to help you.”

“I am contented with this,” Duan Lingfeng nodded his head and it was obvious that he was still uninterested in the White Blaze Fruit.

On this matter, Jian Wushuang could not do anything.

In fact, even if there was no White Blaze Fruit tree, considering his friendship with Duan Lingfeng, if Duan Lingfeng were to ask him for help in the future, he would definitely not decline.

“The third test has ended. Apart from the two people who managed to win the treasure, everyone else can leave.” When Real God Wu Bei, who was at the highest point of the cave, waved his big hand and space passages which led to outside the cave appeared on the void by the side immediately.

There were over a hundred thousand Universe Gods on the open space. However, although most of them were a bit dissatisfied, they did not feel any attachment to the cave. Hence, they moved their bodies and left. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Jian Wushuang, this is my transmission token. If you come across any trouble in the future, you can use this token to contact me. Of course, if I need your help, I will also use this token to contact you,” Duan Lingfeng handed a token over to Jian Wushuang.

After receiving it, Jian Wushuang nodded his head and laughed: “We will see each other again soon.”

Duan Lingfeng’s body moved and he left the cave via the space passage as well.

In no time, everyone had left. Only Jian Wushuang and the God Destroying King remained.

Both of them were the ones who had obtained the final treasure.

“Jian Wushuang, I applaud you. You have obtained two out of the three White Blaze Fruit trees,” the God Destroying King stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Didn’t you get one White Blaze Fruit tree as well?” Jian Wushuang giggled.

The God Destroying King also revealed a smile.

Indeed, he had also obtained a White Blaze Fruit tree which was enough for him to report the completion of his task to the person backing him.

At that moment, the dim shadow of Real God Wu Bei, which was at the highest point of the cave, descended in front of the both of them.

“It’s very difficult to move the White Blaze Fruit tree. Hence, I must do it one by one for the three trees. You shall follow me first,” Real God Wu Bei shot a glance toward the God Destroying King.

“Understood.”

The God Destroying King followed Real God Wu Bei to a special space to move the White Blaze Fruit tree at once. As for Jian Wushuang, he waited quietly.

After some time, both of them came out of the special space. The moment they walked out, the God Destroying King’s eyes were filled with delight. It was obvious that the tree had been moved successfully.

“All right, you can leave already,” Real God Wu Bei said apathetically.

The God Destroying King nodded and left via the space passage.

In the huge cave, only two people remained.

They were Jian Wushuang and the dim shadow of Real God Wu Bei.

At that moment, the two of them were facing one another. Real God Wu Bei’s shadow also came together gradually and became a black-clothed middle-aged man with the an evil-looking forehead.

His penetrating eyes stared at Jian Wushuang with lightning speed and he only started to speak after quite a while.

“Little kid, you are called Jian Wushuang?”

During the three tests previously, he had got to know Jian Wushuang’s name from the other Universe Gods’ discussions.

“You should know that the reason I purposely let the God Destroying King leave first is so that you will be left here alone, right?” Real God Wu Bei’s voice was a bit cold.

“I know,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head, “Because I am the same as you. We are both Inverse Cultivators!”

“Haha, glad that you know,” Real God Wu Bei laughed evilly, “The appearance of my cave has attracted many Universe Gods. However, I didn’t expect an Inverse Cultivator like you to also be within the Universe Gods. Moreover, if I didn’t see wrongly, you should still be a the Universe God of the Second Heaven, but you have a special treasure which allows you to conceal your aura.”

Jian Wushuang possessed a treasure that had been manufactured by the founder of the Lineage of Star, and this treasure allowed him to hide his aura and even his Soul Power. Hence, normal experts and even normal Almighties would not be able to see through him.

However, Real God Wu Bei was also an Inverse Cultivator and they were inside his cave. As such, he was able to see through Jian Wushuang clearly.

“Even though you are only a Universe God of the Second Heaven, your abilities have reached such a level. In addition, you are also ranked third on the Universe God ranking list. You are even stronger than I was back then when I was in your shoes,” Real God Wu Bei exclaimed in admiration.

He had also grown up step by step, starting from being a weak person himself.

He had also experienced the stage of being a Universe God. Back then when he was still a Universe God of the Second Heaven, he could only barely make it into the top twenty of the Universe God ranking list at his peak. There was no way for him to get stronger as well. After all, there was lot of restriction with regards to the Unique Skills. However, Jian Wushuang was in the top three and it was obvious that Jian Wushuang was more outstanding than him.

“Real God Wu Bei, since you know my identity, you should also be certain that my motive for coming to this cave is not only for the White Blaze Fruit and its tree,” Jian Wushuang said seriously.

“You wish to get Real-God level Inverse Cultivation Techniques from me, right?” Real God Wu Bei looked at Jian Wushuang with interest.

“That’s right. That’s my main objective,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head earnestly.

Back then, when he came to the Wu Bei’s cave, helping the Lineage of Star to fight for the White Blaze Fruit and its tree was his secondary objective.

The most important thing was still himself.

He needed Real God-level Inverse Cultivation Techniques.

It was only with the necessary cultivation techniques that he could make a breakthrough and become a Real God-level Inverse Cultivator.

Without the cultivation techniques, he would stay at the level of Universe Gods for the rest of his life.

“Indeed, I know the Real God-like Inverse Cultivation Techniques and I can even give them to you. However, there is a condition,” Real God Wu Bei said.

“What condition?” Jian Wushuang questioned at once.

“I want you to help me kill someone, a personal enemy of mine,” Real God Wu Bei’s eyes turned cold.

“Your personal enemy?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed, “Who is your personal enemy and how strong is he?”

“He is the Demon Heart Kingdom’s monarch, an Almighty who rules many Holy Kingdoms,” Real God Wu Bei said in a low voice: “He and I have a huge score to settle. When I was alive, there were numerous times that I wanted to kill him. However, I couldn’t do it as his abilities were slightly stronger than mine. Moreover, his background is powerful. Until the day I die, I still haven’t managed to find any opportunities!”

“An Almighty?” Jian Wushuang was shocked, “Real God Wu Bei, even when you are at your peak, you are still unable to kill the Demon Heart Kingdom’s monarch. Yet, you want me, a Universe God, to kill him?”
