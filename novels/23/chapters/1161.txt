Chapter 1162: Jian Xiaoyao of Sword Marquis Mansion!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Tianzong Dynasty was one of the many dynasties in the Nanyang Continent.

Small and weak as it was, it was undoubtedly one of the most ancient dynasties in the continent. No one dared to look down on it.

When it came to the dynasty, what most people would think of first was not their Imperial House. Instead, it was a particular faction.

That faction was Sword Marquis Mansion!

Sword Marquis Mansion had existed for over 2,000 years.

In the beginning, Sword Marquis Mansion was just a small force in Tianzong Dynasty. It gradually became the overlord and now enjoyed higher prestige than the Imperial House. It even saved the dynasty from hostile occupation 1,000 years ago.

Sword Marquis Mansion left other factions and dynasties in the Nanyang Continent in awe.

It was said that Sword Marquis Mansion owed its prestige to its extraordinary founder born 2,000 years ago.

The Patriarch’s insurmountable power and contributions to the Mansion was a legend in itself.

Bashui Commandery.

The entire Bashui Commandery was now under the control of Sword Marquis Mansion. The base of Sword Marquis Mansion was located in its capital.

It was a busy street full of people, making for a boisterous scene.

Inside one of the taverns that lined the street.

Two warriors sitting opposite each other were chatting over food and drinks.

“Have you heard? Half a month ago, the genius from Sword Marquis Mansion joined the Easternmost Hunt and claimed the first place among all the talents from 10 dynasties. Rumor has it that this genius won with ease and didn’t even use his full power.”

“Of course! Everyone has heard of it. He truly deserves his title as the top-notch genius of Sword Marquis Mansion. I remember that he’s called Jian Xiaoyao. But if he’s that strong, why isn’t he on the Earthly Dragon List that Tianzong Dynasty issues?”

“Earthly Dragon List? That list only focuses on Tianzong Dynasty. It’s not a big deal. I heard that Jian Xiaoyao made a name for himself in a large empire and even ranked first among the geniuses there.”

“He’s amazing!”

“Of course! Sword Marquis Mansion is also powerful. Their geniuses are all excellent!”

No one overheard their conversation as the two of them occupied a private room. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Yet, a scarlet-robed young man who was sipping wine by the window heard their conversation loud and clear.

“The liquor here isn’t as good as those in the Green Fire World but there’s a unique taste to it. I like it,”?Jian Wushuang thought, smiling. Then, he shouted, “Waiter, bring me a hundred jars of this liquor!”

“Yes, sir!” a waiter immediately replied.

Jian Wushuang continued to savor the fine liquor but his mind was busy pondering over the two warriors’ words.

“Jian Xiaoyao, a genius from Sword Marquis Mansion?”

“Since I left 2,000 years ago, I worried that it might have been destroyed. Not only has it survived, but it’s becoming even more prosperous. It must be thanks to Uncle Xiao.”

Through his Soul Power, he had long detected that there was a Puppet Fighter inside a deeply-hidden secret chamber inside Sword Marquis Mansion.

It was a Puppet Fighter of the Divine Realm. It was undoubtedly a terrifying existence in the Ancient World.

It was unlikely that Sword Marquis Mansion acquired the Puppet Fighter on its own. It must be Emperor Xiao’s doing. After all, Jian Wushuang had asked him to take care of Sword Marquis Mansion.

The owner of the tavern, with several waiters following behind him with jars of liquor, walked up to Jian Wushuang.

“Sir, here is the liquor you asked, a hundred jars in total. Would you like to pay it with Spiritual Liquid or elixirs?” the owner asked, smiling.

Jian Wushuang was stunned. It occurred to him that he had just arrived in the Nanyang Continent and he did not keep any of the Spiritual Liquid or elixirs that were used as currencies here. Though he possessed plenty of treasures, they were from the Green Fire World. He did not know if the tavern owner would recognize them.

Even if the tavern owner knew them, Jian Wushuang would not trade them for his liquor. Those treasures were so precious that any of them would bring the owner great trouble.

“Could you excuse me for a moment? I’ll pay the bill later. Of course, I’ll be leaving my sword as a pledge for the time being,” Jian Wushuang said, handing the owner the Blood Mountain Sword.

“But…” The owner furrowed his brows as he looked at the sword that Jian Wushuang had placed a layer of Restriction on to seal its aura. He used his will to make the sword reveal a hint of its power.

Even the faint hint of power frightened the owner.

The owner immediately said, “Sir, there’s no need to pledge your sword. Just take the liquor.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised an eyebrow. “Well, thanks. Don’t worry. Someone will come here and pay for my liquor soon.”

He waved his hand and the liquor disappeared. He then excused himself with a smile.

The owner heaved a sigh of relief after watching him leave.

“Boss, is that lad an expert? Why did you let him go without taking his sword?” a waiter asked in a whisper.

“Expert?” The owner replied, narrowing his eyes, “You’re right. He is an expert, a genuine one. He must be in the Primordial Gold Core or Yin-Yang Void Realm at least. I’m sure about this. But why would such a top-notch expert fail to pay for his liquor?”

Confused as the owner was, he did not give much thought to this.

However, he was clueless to the fact that the young man was tens of thousands times stronger than he had imagined.

Jian Wushuang walked toward Sword Marquis Mansion after leaving the tavern.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re really something to even attempt leaving your Blood Mountain Sword behind as a pledge for your bill. If your Master finds out, he would probably die of anger,” Gu King joked.

Jian Wushuang laughed cheerfully. “Well, the situation called for it.”

Just then, a group of people riding Wildebeest Beasts appeared at the end of the street and slowly strode toward him.

A grim-faced young man was in the middle of the group. Young as he looked, his eyes were exceptionally sharp. He had evidently undergone lots of ordeals and troubles.

He carried a longsword on his back.

Jian Wushuang recognized that longsword at once.

“Triple-kill Sword?”

“Looks like he’s that incredible genius from Sword Marquis Mansion.”
