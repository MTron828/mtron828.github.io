Chapter 1808: Crimson Lightning Region

“Disciple, this is a Sword Principle that I specially created for you according to the sword intention that you grasped. There is a total of three moves in this Sword Principle but every move could be evolved into thirty-three sword stroke. Before you break through and become a Real God, study this Sword Principle and it should be enough,” Jian Wushuang passed his communication token to his lineal disciple, Lin Lan.

“Thank you, Master,” Lin Lan took it gratefully.

“From today onwards, you shall stay in Wushuang City for cultivation. There are many opportunities in Wushuang City and Sword Principle took up the most. You must work hard,” Jian Wushuang exhorted. Then, he looked at He Xiu, “He Xiu, from now on, you shall cultivate in Wushuang City as well. There are two mystery lands that I created personally. It will be helpful for you too. At the same time, there will be a test in the two mystery lands. I will give you three thousand years time. Within the three thousand years, if you can pass any one of the tests, I will take you in as my lineal disciple.”

“I will definitely work hard for it,” He Xiu was filled with excitement.

“Besides, as your swordsmanship is at a higher level than your senior’s, if you were to be free during the years when you are cultivating in Wushuang City, help your senior along the way,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes,” He Xiu nodded.

“Junior, sorry to trouble you,” Lin Lan said.

“Senior, don’t mention it,” He Xiu smiled.

Jian Wushuang saw the scene. Although it wasn’t shown on his face, he sighed in his heart.

Although Lin Lan and He Xiu were his disciples and Lin Lan was his lineal disciple, in terms of talent, Lin Lan was born in Eternal World. She was considered decent in Green Fire World but she couldn’t reach the peak. Compared to He Xiu, she was far behind.

Even with Jian Wushuang’s guidance, specially created Sword Principle, and the assistance of resources in Wushuang City, she would at most reach Real God level and only be a Void Real God.

It required luck to a certain extent to become a Void Real God. As for Eternal Real God, unless one received an opportunity, one wouldn’t stand much chance.

As for He Xiu, he was God’s favored one. Not only was he talented, but his disposition was mature. He was under Jian Wushuang and he had only been a registered disciple but he was never anxious or impatient, nor did he complain. Even when he saw that Lin Lan was Jian Wushuang’s lineal disciple, He Xiu wasn’t jealous at all. Jian Wushuang appreciated this the most.

If it was said that Lin Lan could only become a Void Real God at most, He Xiu definitely had the potential to become an Almighty. Of course, to reach that level required a lot of time and effort.

“However, I have always been casual when it comes to taking in disciples. Regardless of talent, as long as I click with someone, no matter what their achievement is, they are my disciples,” Jian Wushuang smiled and waved his hands.

“Go ahead.”

He Xiu and Lin Lan walked to Wushuang City right away. Not just them, but as Wushuang City was built, Green Fire World had already started filtering geniuses.

Actually, to be frank, it was a genius assembly. The genius assembly would happen every one thousand years from then on. The ones who had performed outstandingly would stand a chance to cultivate in Wushuang City. Of course, the threshold to enter Wushuang City was naturally high.

It was also to increase the intensity of competition between all forces in Green Fire World.

After Jian Wushuang had settled everything in Green Fire World, he went to Ancient Worlds’ Divine Land alone.

However, it was a pity that to Ancient Worlds had gone through drastic changes in tens of thousands of years. When Jian Wushuang returned to Divine Land, he felt foreign.

In the end, he only found Sword Marquis Mansion’s man with the assistance of Ancient Sect.

As ten of thousands of years passed, Sword Marquis Mansion no longer existed but only a few descendants were left behind and scattered around. Jian Wushuang had mentally prepared for it long ago.

“It is good enough that their bloodline has carried on.”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. Back when he had entrusted Ancient Sect to take care of Sword Marquis Mansion, he had told them to ensure that Sword Marquis Mansion would carry on the bloodline. As for the rise and fall of Sword Marquis Mansion, it didn’t matter.

Even the great forces in Eternal Chaotic World would fall one day, let alone Sword Marquis Mansion in Ancient Worlds.

Jian Wushuang didn’t stay for long in Ancient Worlds and he left right after.

Then, Jian Wushuang went to the ancient battlefield at the border.

Jian Wushuang was also attracted by the bloodline inheritance of ancient tribe experts.

Under the lead of Dao Yuanzi, Jian Wushuang arrived at a region where it was covered in crimson lightning.

“If I’m not mistaken, this should be Crimson Lightning Region?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes, “Dao Yuanzi, the ancient tribe dead body that you mentioned is really in here?”

“My life depends on your whim. How could I lie to you?” Dao Yuanzi said.

Jian Wushuang’s face became solemn.

He knew of the territory in front of him.

Over the years, a large number of experts from Green Fire Palace had wandered in the battlefield. Hence, the region that they had explored was nothing compared to the entire battlefield. There were some places that were explored, just like the region that was covered by the flashes of crimson lightning. Green Fire Palace had kept a record of it and named it… Crimson Lightning Region.

Crimson Lightning Region wasn’t huge but merely an expanse of about a few hundred thousand miles in circumference.

In the expanse of about a few hundred thousand miles, it was engulfed in crimson lightning. The flashes of lightning were extremely powerful and it formed an ocean of lightning. With the coverage of crimson lightning, there was naturally no one who could step foot in Crimson Lightning Region.

At least, Green Fire Palace didn’t have anyone who had entered Crimson Lightning Region all these years. Those who had barged in were struck by the flashes of crimson lightning and turned into ashes. Hence, no one knew what was in Crimson Lightning Region.

“The Crimson Lightning Region is interesting. It could seal off my soul power. However, I could feel that although the flashes of crimson lightning in Crimson Lightning Region could kill a Real God, it would be insufficient to cause any effect on my divine body,” Jian Wushuang kept quiet for a while, then he made a decision.

He slowly moved closer to Crimson Lightning Region.

The moment he stepped foot into Crimson Lightning Region, the surrounding flashes of crimson lightning hemmed Jian Wushuang in instantly. The power that the flashes of crimson lightning contained felt like it was going to break Jian Wushuang into pieces.

However, Jian Wushuang had a shield made of divine power and blocked the crimson lightning off entirely while he continued to approach the depth of Crimson Lightning Region.

In a short time, he had already flown past more than half the distance but he hadn’t encountered any danger. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Isn’t it too smooth?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

The flashes of crimson lightning covering Crimson Lightning Region gave Jian Wushuang a unique feeling. From what he saw, he thought it shouldn’t be that easy to shuttle to and from the ocean of lightning but he didn’t feel any hindrance until then.
