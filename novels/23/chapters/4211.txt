4212 Ruler Bone Armor

“Oh?”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. After a moment of silence, he said with a faint smile, “You don’t want me to challenge Ruler Bone Armor?”

“Yes.” Divine Lord Mu Chong nodded and replied sincerely, “Blood Sword, there’s something you don’t know. Ruler Bone Armor isn’t from the First City. He’s just an important figure from the city behind us who had intentionally placed him in the First City. He’s far more powerful than we are. If you go find Ruler Bone Armor and lose, it’s fine, but if you win, you’ll automatically strip him of his position as City Lord. At that time, it’s hard to avoid the great figure behind him from bearing a grudge against you.”

Divine Lord Mu Chong said those words from the bottom of his heart. He said those words because Jian Wushuang had stopped at the last moment and spared his life.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and asked with a smile, “Is this Ruler Bone Armor strong?”

“He is much stronger than me,” Divine Lord Mu Chong replied.

Jian Wushuang smiled and did not reply. Instead, he extended his hand and patted Divine Lord Mu Chong’s shoulder. He then turned around and strode toward the last palace in the First City!

Jian Wushuang had come to the ancient path of stars with the intention of fighting with experts. How could Divine Lord Mu Chong’s words make Jian Wushuang back down?

In the deepest part of the First City, an extremely large and Grand Palace stood tall!

This palace was much larger than the other palaces. Looking at it from a distance, one could not help but feel a sense of submission.

The two words ‘bone armor’ were carved into the ceiling of the palace. This was where the first-ranked Ruler Bone Armor was located!

“Ruler Bone Armor…I hope it won’t disappoint me.” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself. Then, he raised his head and looked at the huge palace with a flash of light in his eyes.

The next moment, Jian Wushuang strode toward the huge palace.

Behind him, the people who had been defeated by Jian Wushuang looked at each other and then followed Jian Wushuang.

When Divine Lord Mu Chong saw this, he gritted his teeth and walked into the crowd.

At the same time, on the stone tablet outside the First City.

The words ‘Divine Lord Mu Chong’ that had been engraved on the second row flashed with golden light and vanished.

It was replaced by the words ‘Blood Sword’!

First City, second place, Blood Sword!

“Second place!”

“The Blood Sword is in second place!!”

“Even Divine Lord Mu Chong is no match for the Blood Sword?!”

“The Blood Sword is about to reach the pinnacle of the First City!”

At this moment, countless people outside the First City’s city gates burst into an uproar.

Divine Lord Mu Chong’s position as second in the First City has never wavered. No one has been a match for him in the past ten thousand years and he’s even known as the First City’s chosen with the most potential!

But today, this genius had been defeated by a younger fifth stage Ruler!

“This is the rise of a chosen!”

“I’m sure that among the last eight cities, there will definitely be a seat for Blood Sword in the future!”

“Although Blood Sword’s cultivation is only at the fifth level, his battle-power, in my opinion, is enough to fight against peak Rulers, or even the nearly invincible Ultimate Rulers!” Zhao Feng’s eyes flashed.

“If the Blood Sword is at the Ultimate Ruler realm, it’ll probably be able to fight against the most monstrous geniuses in the universe, right?”

At this moment, countless people were looking at the two golden words ‘Blood Sword’ on the stone tablet. They were fanatical and fascinated.

In just one day, they had watched Jian Wushuang rise from the last place to the second place in the First City!

They had seen many people successfully pass the First City and enter the Second City. However, it was rare to see someone like Jian Wushuang, who started from the last place and challenged all the way to the second place without taking a break.

For a fifth stage Ruler to be able to do this was unprecedented!

“This is how a man should be.” An Ultimate Ruler sighed.

“Do you guys think that Blood Sword will continue down this path and challenge the Ruler Bone Armor to complete the First City’s grand slam? Or will they pass by Ruler Bone Armor and head directly to The Second City?”

“In my opinion, based on Blood Sword’s personality, I’m afraid he’ll choose to ascend to the top of the First City. You must know that it’s a Grand feat to ascend to the top of the First City as a mere stage five great emperor.”

“It’s hard to say. The Ruler Bone Armor wasn’t from the First City to begin with. He’s just an important figure from the last eight cities who had been specially sent to the First City. His power is far greater than that of the First City’s people. Even if the Blood Sword can win against him, I’m afraid it won’t be an easy battle. It’ll affect his future.”

“That’s right. Even though I’d love to see the Blood Sword ascend to the top of the First City, I’d rather the Blood Sword avoid the Ruler Bone Armor. Otherwise, if the Blood Sword were to fight to the death with the Ruler Bone Armor in the First City, it’d be extremely disadvantageous to the other cities.”

“That’s right, the Blood Sword is destined to belong to the people of the later cities. We shouldn’t waste too much time and energy in the First City.”

At this moment, countless people looked at the ranking of ‘Blood Sword’ on the stone tablet with anticipation and some worry.

What they did not know was that Jian Wushuang had already arrived at the governor’s residence in the First City.

This palace was much more majestic than the other palaces. It was filled with scarlet lanterns and it appeared rather eerie in the desolate and dark First City.

Thump thump thump.

“I’m here to experience it.” Jian Wushuang was thin and tall. He took off the wooden token hanging on the mansion and said lightly.

“Alright,” he said.

A hoarse voice came from the City Lord’s mansion.

Creak! Creak!

Then, they saw the gate of the City Lord’s mansion open slowly, letting out an old and unpleasant sound.

In the endless darkness of the City Lord’s mansion, a hunchbacked and thin old man in a blood-red robe walked out step by step.

A cold and gloomy aura was emitted from his body. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Ruler Bone Armor!”

“Bone Spine City Lord!”

The eyes of the Ultimate Rulers behind Jian Wushuang narrowed.

The Ruler Bone Armor was a nightmarish existence in the First City. Almost no city trespasser would challenge him.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. The Ruler Bone Armor seemed to be much stronger than the people he had met before.

A gust of cold wind blew past, ruffling the Ruler Bone Armor’s blood-red robes and revealing his shriveled, pitch-black skin. “Blood Sword, right? I know you. You killed two of my Rulers at the entrance to the ancient path of stars.”

Jian Wushuang did not deny it. He nodded and replied, “Not bad.”
