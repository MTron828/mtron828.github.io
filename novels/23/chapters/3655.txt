Chapter 3657: Farewell to Xue Bei

“Mr. Xue Bei, Elder Gu, how have you been?”

When Jian Wushuang appeared in front of Xue Bei and Elder Gu, they were shocked, especially Elder Gu.

He was the spirit of the Secret Realm, so he knew everything that happened in the Xue Bei Secret Realm. But now, someone had come to the Xue Bei Secret Realm and appeared in front of them, how could he not notice it?

When Xue Bei and Elder Gu saw who it was, they were even more shocked.

“You are the little guy from before?” Xue Bei looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise.

“Yes, it’s me. It’s been more than 100,000 years. I didn’t expect that your consciousness was still there, Mr. Xue Bei.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“It’s just consciousness. It doesn’t matter whether it exists or not. As for you, even I can’t see through you when I see you again after 100,000 years. Moreover, you were able to enter the Secret Realm quietly and appear in front of me. Your current strength should be extraordinary. I wonder what level you have reached?” Xue Bei asked.

He was really curious about Jian Wushuang’s current strength.

Because he could not see through Jian Wushuang at all.

However, he was a Principles Master of the void five realm when he was alive, so he could not see through Jian Wushuang’s strength. At the very least, Jian Wushuang’s strength should not be lower than his at his peak.

“I just became a Principles Master not long ago, so I am only a Principles Master in terms of realm. However, my battle strength is slightly stronger than my realm, so I can barely match a Ruler,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

He did not hide it.

He had nothing to hide from a person who was already dead and only had a trace of consciousness left.

“Match a Ruler?” Xue Bei stared at him.

Elder Gu, who was standing beside him, was also shocked.

If it were anyone else who said that his battle strength was comparable to a Ruler’s, they would definitely not believe it. However, it was Jian Wushuang who said it.

100,000 years ago, when Jian Wushuang came to the Xue Bei Secret Realm, he revealed his incredible talent and the shocking secrets he contained.

At that time, Xue Bei knew that Jian Wushuang’s background was extraordinary.

Such a person, who had reached the level of a Ruler in terms of battle strength at the level of a Principles Master, was still somewhat convincing.

However, they were still shocked.

After all, he was a Ruler.

How many Rulers were there in the entire Divine Beginning Realm?

It could be counted on one hand, right?

“I was just unwilling to die in obscurity, so I gave all the opportunities to you. I also wanted to use you to make my name known in the Divine Beginning Realm again. I didn’t expect that my actions back then would actually create a monster that could rival a Ruler at the level of a Principles Master.” Xue Bei sighed, he was also a little excited.

He knew that Jian Wushuang must have put in a lot of effort to get to where he was today. As for the opportunity that he gave to Jian Wushuang, it might have helped him a little, however, it was impossible for Jian Wushuang to get to where he was today by relying on his opportunity.

Even if it was not so, it was still worthy of Xue Bei’s excitement and pride.

After all, Jian Wushuang had once obtained his good fortune and also received his favor. To put it bluntly, it was indeed a matter of pride for Jian Wushuang to have played a part in his growth.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis...” Xue Bei had just opened his mouth when he paused and said, “Is it okay for me to call you that?”

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

In fact, Jian Wushuang’s battle strength was already at the level of a Ruler, and Xue Bei was only a Principles Master of the five void realms at his peak. In terms of strength, Xue Bei would bow to Jian Wushuang, it would not be too much to bow to him.

However, Xue Bei had died a long time ago, and he owed Jian Wushuang a favor. Jian Wushuang could accept him calling him by his name.

“When I gave you the opportunity, I asked you to do something for me. How did it go?” Xue Bei asked.

“I’ve done what you asked. I gave your interspatial ring to the experts of the Blood Ancestor lineage of the Heaven Ancestor Daoist Sect, and I helped you regain your position in the Heaven Ancestor Daoist Sect. Although the Blood Clan is not the strongest among the sects in the Heaven Ancestor Daoist Sect, at least other sects don’t dare to provoke them,” Jian Wushuang said.

“As for the leader of the Blood Clan, the Blood Ancestor...It’s a pity that the Blood Ancestor has been wandering in the Universe Battlefield. Although I have been to the Universe Battlefield, I have never met him. Therefore, until now, I have never met him.”

Jian Wushuang had read about the Blood Ancestor when he was wandering in the Universe Battlefield.

The Blood Ancestor was a powerful Principles Master who had reached the pinnacle of the six realm. When Jian Wushuang went to the Heaven Ancestor Daoist Sect, the Blood Ancestor was trapped somewhere in the Universe Battlefield, Jian Wushuang knew that the Blood Ancestor had been trapped in the Witch Desert Region, one of the three battlefields.

However, when he stepped into the Universe Battlefield, the Blood Ancestor had already escaped from the Witch Desert Region. He had been wandering there all these years, but Jian Wushuang had never been to the Witch Desert Region, naturally, he did not have any contact with the Blood Ancestor.

“Although I don’t have any contact with the Blood Ancestor, the leader of the Heaven Ancestor Daoist sect, the Heaven Ancestor, has a special relationship with me.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly in his heart.

“I’m already very grateful that you were able to complete my task and bring the news of my death and the things I left behind to the Blood Ancestor’s bloodline, not to mention that you helped the Blood Clan’s bloodline regain its position.

“As for Brother Heaven Ancestor...it doesn’t matter whether you’ve seen him or not.” Xue Bei’s voice was indifferent. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“By the way, you just said that you’ve also been adventuring in the Universe Battlefield. Have you been to the star map that I gave you previously, the special space-time where the star map is located?” Xue Bei suddenly asked.

“Yes. It’s precisely because I’ve been to that special space-time that my strength has improved by leaps and bounds. Of course, I’ve also stayed in that special space-time for 97,000 years. Speaking of which, it’s considered to be a narrow escape,” Jian Wushuang said.

“What exactly is in that special space-time?” Xue Bei could not wait to ask.

He had entered that special space-time by chance. He had obtained some opportunities in that special space-time, but he did not dare to go too deep. He only chose to leave halfway, he did not really come to the high platform where the 18-ultimate formation was located, so he naturally did not know the real secret of that space-time.

He had given the star map to Jian Wushuang in the hope that he would go to the special space-time to explore. As expected, Jian Wushuang had been there and had come back alive.
