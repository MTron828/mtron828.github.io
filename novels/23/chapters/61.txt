Chapter 62: Peerless Genius Yang Zaixuan

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Okay. This is the Dragon Gate.”

Ye Rufeng led Jian Wushuang to a towering golden pavilion. At a glance, the pavilion appeared to have 13 levels.

At the moment, many people were standing in front of the golden pavilion. The two most prominent people were an old man wearing a black robe and a graceful woman dressed in white.

Even though Ye Rufeng was an expert, upon seeing these two people he bowed to pay his respects and said, ” Greetings, Palace Master Black and Palace Master White.”

“Ye Rufeng.” The graceful woman in white looked at him and Jian Wushuang, then said with a smile, “You brought this little guy to go through the Dragon Gate?”

“Yes,” said Ye Rufeng with a nod.

“You will have to wait a minute. Someone else is already going through the Dragon Gate now,” said the graceful woman in white, then she turned her head immediately.

Ye Rufeng and Jian Wushuang had no choice but to wait quietly.

Jian Wushuang lifted his head and looked at the towering golden pavilion. The lowest six levels of this 13 level golden pavilion were shining. Jian Wushuang knew it meant that six levels had been passed by the genius that was currently going through the Dragon Gate.

Currently, the genius was making his way through the seventh level.

Suddenly, the seventh level of the golden pavilion also burst out with a golden light.

“He passed the seventh level!” Ye Rufeng shouted out in shock. Many others outside of the golden pavilion also shouted out in surprise.

“Sir Ye, is it amazing that he passed the seventh level?” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help asking.

“Amazing. It is really amazing.” Ye Rufeng nodded seriously and said, “I have told you that moving through the Dragon Gate is based on your comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth. It’s likely that you could make it through the third level with your comprehension of the Sword Principle of Gale. But it’s hard to say if you could make it through the fourth level.”

“As for the seventh level, it’s a huge bottleneck. Generally speaking, only someone with comprehension equal to an expert in the Yin-Yang Void Realm can make it through.”

“In other words, if someone gets through the seventh level, it means that his comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth is not less than an expert in the Yin-Yang Void Realm?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

How strong was an expert in the Yin-Yang Void Realm? How high was an expert’s comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth?

Jian Wushuang could not imagine it. However, he knew that the amount of time he spent comprehending the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth was short. Although he reached a certain level of understanding, there were numerous people whose comprehension was higher than his just among experts in the Gold Core Realm. As for the Yin-Yang Void Realm, he was too far away from them.

“If going through the seventh level is amazing, how about the eighth level?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Suddenly, the eighth level of the golden pavilion immediately burst out with golden light.

He passed through the eighth level!

“The eighth level.” Ye Rufeng had a shocked expression.

“No wonder the two Palace Maters of Dragon Palace came, a marvelous new member has appeared. Even before cultivating in Dragon Palace, he can already pass through the eighth level of the Dragon Gate. There’s no doubt that he’ll make greater progress after cultivating in Dragon Palace. His achievements will be even more spectacular.”

“He is really a peerless genius!”

Ye Rufeng was full of praise, but Jian Wushuang only gave a shrug after listening to his explanation.

He was just good in the eyes of Ye Rufeng, but the genius going through the Dragon Gate was praised by Ye Rufeng. With this, it’s easy to see how amazingly talented he was.

Going through the Eighth Level of Dragon Gate represented that his comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth had surpassed many experts of the Yin-Yang Void Realm. It also induced a burst of surprise outside of the Golden Pavilion. However, the eighth was the limit. The ninth level of the Golden Pavilion did not light up in the end.

Jingle!

The gate of the Golden Pavilion opened. Wearing a blood-red robe, with a blood-red saber on his back, a young man slowly appeared before the eyes of the crowd.

Everyone looked at the young man for the first time, including Jian Wushuang.

He was slender and handsome with a hint of indifference and pride on his face, a glimmer of an unyielding will was hidden in the deep of his eyes, and he emanated an aura of coldness.

“The man… is cold.” Jian Wushuang frowned secretly.

“Haha, little guy. Welcome to Dragon Palace.” The Black and White Palace Masters, as well as the nearby experts of the Dragon Palace, all greeted him with a smile.

“Little guy, what’s your name and how old are you?” Palace Master White asked with good intentions.

“Yang Zaixuan, 21,” he replied in a cold voice.

Everyone who heard him was immediately surprised.

“21?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“He is only 21 years old, yet his comprehension of the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth is already so high!”

“He managed to pass through the eighth level of the Dragon Gate. The most dazzling talent in Dragon Palace only made it through the eighth level.”

“Awesome! Our Dragon Palace will become boisterous. Bai Cheng finally has a rival.”

Many disciples of Dragon Palace that were present were talking about that.

A 21-year-old man had gone through the eighth level of the Dragon Gate. Even in Dragon Palace, it was incredible. He was the most exceptional one among all the exceptional geniuses.

After all, previously, there had only been one person that made it through the eighth level of the Dragon Gate. And he was known as the number one genius in Dragon Palace, Bai Cheng!

“Yang Zaixuan is amazing,” Ye Rufeng said, then sighed with emotion.

Having sighed for a while, the black and white Palace Masters looked at Ye Rufeng and Jian Wushuang.

“Ye Rufeng, you can let this little guy you brought go through the Dragon Gate now,” Palace Master White said, completely ignoring Jian Wushuang.

The Palace Masters had a high status, so the geniuses who had gone through the Dragon Gate were only worth a glance to them.

Only a peerless genius like Yang Zaixuan could excite the two Palace Masters and receive their enthusiastic treatment.

“Little guy, you should go. Remember, you should try your best to go to the highest level you can reach,” said Ye Rufeng.

“Okay,” said Jian Wushuang, then he nodded and went straight towards the Golden Pavilion without paying attention to the gazes of the people around him. He quickly entered the Golden Pavilion.

The first level of the Dragon Gate.

A red-haired man was sitting cross-legged on the empty ground. When Jian Wushuang walked inside, the man suddenly glared at Jian Wushuang and said, “Little guy, if you beat me, you can go to the next level.”

“Come on!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the red-haired man began to brandish his large axe, which was surrounded by a blast of invisible airflow. In an instant, the large axe slashed toward his opponent.

Jian Wushuang immediately swung his Triple-kill Sword to block the blow. Then he directly took the chance to strike back, scratching the garment of the red-haired man. Obviously, the red-haired man was defeated.

He made it through the first level.
