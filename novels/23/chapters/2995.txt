Chapter 2996: Cultivation Time

——

“The Gold-Splitting Master is really good. He dissected an extremely complicated and profound rule in such a detailed and clear manner,” Jian Wushuang praised. “It’s much easier to comprehend such a detailed principle than we usually do!”

“If I had obtained the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual earlier, it would have been much easier for me to comprehend the space-time principle with the help of the heaven-sealing painting scroll. My comprehension of the space-time principle would have been much higher than now.”

Jian Wushuang looked at the information on the space-time principle on the scroll.

In each stage of the space-time principle, not only the first stage of the space-time illusion body but also the second stage of the space-time blade and the third stage of the space-time principle were dissected in great detail, however, the fourth stage… This scroll did not mention anything about the fourth stage of the space-time principles.

However, there was nothing he could do about it.

After all, he had only obtained the first volume of the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual. After all, the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual had a total of four volumes.

“My comprehension of the space-time principles is still at the second stage, which is the level of the space-time blade. I’m still far from the limit of condensing 1,000 streaks of space-time heat. With my own comprehension speed, it would take me a long time, even with the help of the three heaven-sealing scrolls. But now, with the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual, I can dissect the space-time principles of the second stage in such detail. It will be much easier for me to comprehend it.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Then, he looked at the other contents of the secret manual.

For example, the sword principle…the secret manual also contained a complete dissection of the sword principle.

From the first stage of the sword principle, the sword world, to the second stage, the limit of the infinite sword tree, there was a complete dissection.

However, the third stage of the infinite sword tree was not mentioned.

The infinite sword tree was already considered an extremely high level. Many powerful Immortal Saints only stayed at this level. As for those who could develop the infinite sword tree to its limit, they were all top-notch existences among the Immortal Saints.

It was already good enough that the first volume of the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual could dissect the infinite sword tree completely.

In addition to the space-time rule and the dissecting of sword principle, the secret manual also contained the comprehension of the Gold-Splitting Master, as well as some of his experience in combining the space-time rule with his own swordsmanship. It was of great help to Jian Wushuang. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

In addition, there was void swordsmanship…

“Void swordsmanship, the strongest swordsmanship created by the Gold-Splitting Master.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled as he carefully browsed through it. However, he was soon disappointed.

It was true that void swordsmanship was included in the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual, but some of it was only the basic framework. The framework was not complete, and it was not even the embryonic form of swordsmanship.

Although the framework was of some help to Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship, it was very limited.

“The void swordsmanship created by the Gold-Splitting Master has a total of six moves, but the main tearing and cutting moves seem to have a total of three moves.” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He had heard from Mo Shan that the void swordsmanship created by the Gold-Splitting Master mainly focused on tearing and cutting. As for the other three moves, they were just to perfect his swordsmanship so that he would have no flaws.

Each of the six moves was ridiculously strong.

Unfortunately, he could only see a basic framework.

“Having a basic framework is equivalent to having a model. It will be of great help to me in creating a prototype of my own swordsmanship in the future. Also, the dissection of the space-time principles and sword principle will be of great use to me. Not to mention the insights left behind by the Gold-Splitting Master, as well as the cooperation and application of the space-time principles and sword principle.”

“In short, although I used 800 million sacred elixirs in the first volume of the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual, its true value to me is not even comparable to 8 billion sacred elixirs.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, feeling rather excited.

As Mo Shan had said, the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual was of great use to him. It was definitely the secret manual that he needed to learn the most at this stage.

The Gold-Splitting Secret Manual could help him greatly in his comprehension of space-time rules, sword principle, and how to create his own sword art prototype.

“Let’s begin…”

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath, and his heart had completely calmed down.

Soon, he was immersed in cultivation and comprehension.

Time slowly passed.

Jian Wushuang, who was immersed in cultivation and comprehension, had completely forgotten the passage of time in the outside world.

He closed his eyes, completely immersed in the Gold-Splitting Secret Manual and his own comprehension.

In a flash, 100 years had passed.

100 years was nothing in his previous life, but in this life, it was definitely the longest time Jian Wushuang had secluded himself to cultivate.

He was still immersed in cultivation.

In the deepest part of the third heaven, in a chaotic void, several ancient and powerful existences gathered together…

They were drinking fine wine, which emitted a refreshing fragrance. Whether it was the comprehension of the rules or the understanding of the Dao, it had a great effect, and it also contained great energy.

To put it bluntly, if an ordinary Divine Master realm cultivator’s understanding of the laws and the Dao could keep up, this wine would easily allow him to rise to the level of a Peak Great Divine Master with just a single drop.

However, this wine, which was supposed to be priceless, seemed to be completely worthless in front of these ancient existences. They drank cup after cup.

While drinking, these ancient existences were also chatting.

“The three of you, what do you think of that little fellow called ‘Cang’?” A tall man with a horn on his forehead and many silver scales on his face said.

“Not bad. It’s only been two hundred years since entering the Chaos Palace, and he has already passed through the seventh level of the Tower of Fortune. His future is boundless!” The three-eyed man who was over three meters tall and had bronze skin all over his body nodded and praised.

“His talent is indeed not bad. In this era, the most outstanding genius in the Primal Chaos Palace should be him. Even in the entire Divine Beginning Realm, his talent in this era should be ranked in the top three. If he can continue to comprehend like this, he should be able to completely comprehend and control a set of laws within three thousand years at most. He should be able to stand on equal footing with us.” The jade-haired woman also nodded slightly.

“Haha, I personally brought this little fellow here. It’s a pity that he’s too arrogant and isn’t willing to acknowledge me as his master. Otherwise…” The one-horned tall man sighed, “Let’s not talk about him for now. Didn’t the three of you say that you’ve discovered an incredible genius who has a chance of joining the Chaos Palace? Why is there no news?”

Hearing this, the three-eyed man and the green-haired woman could not help but look at the white-haired old man, who was also Mo Shan.
