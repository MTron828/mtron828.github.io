“This Heavenly Sword Marquis is so bold and courageous. He’s just a mere rank four True Saint, yet he dares to fight the Purple Cloud Pavilion head-on?”

“Indeed. If it were us, after knowing that the Purple Cloud Pavilion had issued the kill order, we would definitely try to find a place to hide. We might even flee to the endless territories so that the Purple Cloud Pavilion wouldn’t be able to find us. We would wait for a few hundred thousand years before returning. However, this Heavenly Sword Marquis clearly knows that the Purple Cloud Pavilion wants to kill him, yet he still took the initiative to run into the territory controlled by the Purple Cloud Pavilion and kill as he pleases. Tsk tsk…”

“This Heavenly Sword Marquis is really something. He is only a rank four True Saint, yet he can kill so many experts of the Purple Cloud Pavilion in such a short time. He can even kill a rank six True Saint or even a rank six Peak True Saint. This is too terrifying. He is simply a monster.”

“Monster?”

“Humph, so what if his talent is heaven-defying? His actions now clearly indicate that he wants to fight to the death with the Purple Cloud Pavilion. However, the Purple Cloud Pavilion is such a huge monster. How can a mere rank four True Saint be able to fight against it? Just wait and see. Before long, the people of the Purple Cloud Pavilion will find him and kill him.”

“Yeah, I think so too. After all, the Purple Cloud Pavilion is the overlord of the First Heaven. It has been deeply rooted for so many years, and its strength is no small matter. After so many years, no one in the First Heaven dares to challenge the Purple Cloud Pavilion head-on. Other than Dao Dragon, there is no one else who can survive. Although this Heavenly Sword Marquis is talented, in terms of strength, he is still far from Dao Dragon!”

“Stupid!”

“Stupid! Heavenly Sword Marquis is too stupid.”

Countless experts were discussing this matter.

These experts had different attitudes toward Jian Wushuang. Some admired Jian Wushuang’s courage and courage, some admired his strength and talent, but there were also many who thought he was too stupid, he should not have chosen to fight head-on with the Purple Cloud Pavilion.

But no matter what they thought, it had nothing to do with Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang insisted on walking his own path. He knew what he was doing.

Time passed…

Jian Wushuang still roamed around the territory controlled by the Purple Cloud Pavilion, killing experts everywhere.

The Purple Cloud Pavilion was also trying to find him and kill him, but Jian Wushuang was very cunning. His whereabouts were always erratic, and because he was a heaven-grade member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, he could get detailed information from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, the Purple Cloud Pavilion had set traps for him several times, but he did not fall for it.

In a flash, 60 years had passed!

Jian Wushuang had killed for 60 years in the territory controlled by the Purple Cloud Pavilion, but he was still alive and well.

“During these 60 years, I killed countless experts in the Purple Cloud Pavilion. Killing and attacking again and again made my strength improve a lot, but the improvement is not too great.” Jian Wushuang stood in the void, his eyes were extremely cold as he stared at the information he had just received.

The information said that half a month later, a new king of the Winter Snow Kingdom under the Purple Cloud Pavilion would take over. The Purple Cloud Pavilion sent an elder of a rank seven True Saint to participate.

“A rank seven True Saint…” Jian Wushuang muttered.

With his current strength, it was indeed easy for him to kill an ordinary rank six True Saint or even a rank six Peak True Saint.

Even if several rank six Peak True Saint experts joined hands, he could easily kill them. In the past 60 years, he had killed many rank six True Saints in the Purple Cloud Pavilion.

It was not difficult for him to kill a rank six True Saint.

If he wanted to train and use the Purple Cloud Pavilion as a whetstone, he naturally had to find someone stronger.

That was why he had his eyes on this rank seven True Saint.

“With my current strength, it’s not difficult for me to contend with an ordinary rank seven initial True Saint. As for whether I can kill him or not, I’m not sure. But even if I can’t kill this rank seven True Saint, I can leave at ease.” Jian Wushuang smiled, he had already made up his mind.

“In half a month, the Winter Snow Kingdom!”

…

Half a month soon arrived.

The Winter Snow Kingdom was one of the many kingdoms under the Purple Cloud Pavilion. The Winter Snow Kingdom’s territory was quite vast. In the First Heaven, it was already a large kingdom with many experts, there were six rank six True Saints, but there was not a single rank seven True Saint in the entire kingdom.

Today, the new king of the Winter Snow Kingdom had ascended to the throne, and the Winter Snow Kingdom had specially invited an elder of the Purple Cloud Pavilion to attend.

The inauguration ceremony was extremely lively and grand. After the ceremony was over, a huge banquet was held, and countless experts were boisterous.

Only after the banquet was over did everyone start to disperse.

“Lord Bai Yuan, this is just a small token of my appreciation. I hope that when you return to the Purple Cloud Pavilion, you can put in a few good words for my Winter Snow Kingdom.” A middle-aged man dressed luxuriously smiled, he gave out an interspatial ring.

The white-robed old man called Bai Yuan ended up with the interspatial ring. After scanning it with his consciousness, he smiled and nodded. “Don’t worry, Your Highness. The Winter Snow Kingdom has long been under the command of our Purple Cloud Pavilion. Moreover, they have been following the lead of our Purple Cloud Pavilion all these years. Naturally, the Purple Cloud Pavilion will not forget.”

“In that case, thank you, Lord Bai Yuan. Please take care.” The middle-aged man dressed in luxurious clothes said.

Bai Yuan turned around and prepared to leave.

Whoosh!

A figure suddenly appeared in front of everyone without any warning.

Bai Yuan and the middle-aged man immediately looked up.

“My name is Heavenly Sword Marquis!” Jian Wushuang said softly.

He said it casually, but when the people around heard the name, their faces changed!

“Heavenly Sword Marquis!”

“He is Heavenly Sword Marquis? The rank four True Saint who has been fighting with the Purple Cloud Pavilion for 60 years and still hasn’t been killed?”

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you actually came to the Winter Snow Kingdom?”

A lot of exclamations sounded at the same time.

Bai Yuan’s face turned completely gloomy.

“Boy, how dare you!” Bai Yuan’s voice was cold, and he had secretly sent a message to the Purple Cloud Pavilion.

He knew that Jian Wushuang was very strong. He was only an initial rank seven True Saint. Even if he could suppress Jian Wushuang, he would not be able to kill him. Therefore, the Purple Cloud Pavilion had to send more experts.

After receiving the message from Bai Yuan, the Purple Cloud Pavilion’s higher-ups immediately ordered three experts at the rank seven Peak True Saint Realm to rush over.

Three experts at the peak of rank seven were enough to kill a rank seven True Saint of the same level. Killing a rank four True Saint like Jian Wushuang would be a piece of cake.

Jian Wushuang guessed that Bai Yuan had sent a message, but he was not in a hurry. He had already received detailed information about the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and had already calculated it.

“Although the Winter Snow Kingdom is a large-scale kingdom under the Purple Cloud Pavilion, the Purple Cloud Pavilion does not have a direct space passage to the Winter Snow Kingdom. If the experts of the Purple Cloud Pavilion want to rush here, they need at least 30 breaths of time!” Jian Wushuang muttered in his heart! Jian Wushuang murmured to himself..
