Chapter 3075: Peak Rank Four

_______________

Time passed quickly. In a flash, Jian Wushuang had stayed in the Young Divine Sect for 30 years.

In the manor, Bai Jue and Iceberg were sitting together, drinking tea.

“Iceberg, how many times has Heavenly Sword Marquis looked for you in the past 30 years?” Bai Jue asked.

“Three times,” Iceberg replied.

“Only three times?” Bai Jue raised his eyebrows. “That shouldn’t be the case. With your knowledge and cultivation of Sword Dao, it should be more than enough for you to guide Heavenly Sword Marquis. If it were any other genius of Sword Dao, with your painstaking guidance, they would definitely come to you frequently. In the past 30 years, it would be normal for them to come to you for guidance a hundred times, but he only came to you three times?”

“Sir, Heavenly Sword Marquis is very arrogant. In terms of Sword Dao, if it’s an ordinary question that he can’t understand in a short period of time, he will first try to study it himself and comprehend it in various ways. If he really can’t comprehend it in a short period of time, he will come to me for guidance.” Iceberg said.

“Is that so?” Bai Jue nodded slightly. “This little fellow doesn’t want to rely too much on the guidance of others. That will cause him to become lazy. Only when it’s truly important and crucial will he come to ask me.”

“That’s right. Furthermore, he came to look for me three times. The first time was during the second year that we stayed in the Young Divine Sect. The second time was during the fifth year, and the third time was during the tenth year. However, from the tenth year until now, a full twenty years have passed, and he still hasn’t come to look for me,” Iceberg said.

“Then, did you see anything from your three-pointers?” Bai Jue asked.

“Well…” Iceberg frowned. “A little, but not much.”

“What do you mean?” Bai Jue looked over.

“After three-pointers, I can be sure that the Heavenly Sword Marquis’ understanding of sword principle and swordsmanship is indeed much better than what he showed us back then.” Iceberg’s voice was heavy.

“Take swordsmanship as an example. When we fought before, he only displayed one sword style. That sword style was called the ‘instant of life and death’. After this sword style was displayed, he stopped. At that time, he said that this sword style was the only one that he could show off. However, after three times of guidance, I discovered that he had created at least two other sword styles that were not inferior to ‘instant of life and death’. Moreover, those two sword styles each had their own characteristics and were also very amazing.”

“Oh?” Bai Jue’s expression changed. “It seems that my guess is correct. This little guy is indeed hiding his skills and talent.”

“What else? What else did you come up with?” Bai Jue continued to ask.

“Nothing else.” Iceberg shook his head. “That Heavenly Sword Marquis is very cautious. He came to me for guidance only because of some problems in swordsmanship and swordsmanship. However, he only gave me guidance three times. Moreover, he has been hiding his skills all this time, so I didn’t see too much of him.”

“Is that so?” Bai Jue’s expression changed slightly. “Now he comes to you for advice less and less. If you want to see his real strength through his advice, I’m afraid it’s impossible. I have to think of another way.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Another way?” Iceberg looked over.

“In a real battle, a real battle or a fight is enough to see a lot of things.” Bai Jue smiled and then ordered, “Iceberg, go and call your disciple over.”

“Yes.” Iceberg nodded.

…

In the courtyard where Jian Wushuang lived, Jian Wushuang stood alone, holding the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

He closed his eyes, his breath was steady, and there was no movement at all.

At this moment…phew!

A breeze came, but Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes. Instantly, two electric lights shot out from his eyes.

The Blood Mountain Sword in his hand moved at the same time.

Whoosh!

The sword swept across, and a scarlet sword shadow burst out.

The sword shadow was like the setting sun, the red light illuminating the world.

But the ‘setting sun’ was obviously incomplete.

Wushuang Sword Manual…Canyang!

Buzz!

The sword light swept across the void in front of him, instantly creating a large area of spatial ripples, which were all red in color.

However, suddenly, rumble! An endless killing power swept up. A huge space-time storm formed in an instant and began to crazily annihilate everything in the void.

In just an instant, everything in the void in front of Jian Wushuang was annihilated without leaving a trace.

Jian Wushuang had spent a lot of time comprehending and studying each of the seven sword techniques in the Wushuang Sword Manual. Many of the sword techniques were the inspirations he had found from studying countless profound and unfathomable sword techniques in the Bodhi World.

For example, there were nine sword techniques in the ninth heaven of the illusory sword, which seemed to be performed at the same time. Each move was faster and stronger than the last. It was a wonderful sword technique that used speed to suppress the opponent.

As for the sword technique of Canyang, it was the result of Jian Wushuang’s perfect combination of his swordsmanship and the comprehension of the space-time principles.

He had reached the third stage of the comprehension of space-time principles. At this stage, he had mastered space-time annihilation.

The ‘afterimage’ was a perfect combination of swordsmanship and space-time annihilation, complementing each other.

The swordsmanship was powerful, while the space-time annihilation was hidden in the swordsmanship. It could burst out a terrifying power in a short period of time and deal a devastating blow to the opponent.

“I almost didn’t use my own divine power in this sword attack. I only relied on swordsmanship and space-time principles, but it still caused such a big commotion.” Jian Wushuang looked at the space in front of him that had been completely annihilated, his eyes flashed with a hint of surprise.

He did not use his divine power.

Once his divine power was fully unleashed, his move could definitely destroy the world.

“Judging from the power of my swordsmanship, the first move of the setting sun should have reached the peak of the fourth rank by now,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

He had stayed in the Young Divine Sect for thirty years. During these thirty years, he had been focusing on studying the Gold-splitting Secret Manual. After thirty years of studying it, he had achieved remarkable results. Not only had his comprehension of space-time principles improved greatly, but his swordsmanship had also improved greatly, in addition, his swordsmanship had also improved greatly.

There were seven sword techniques in the Wushuang Sword Manual, including Xi Xiang, Star Dream, Canyang, Emperor’s Blood Kill, life and Death Instant, Ninth Heaven of illusionary sword, and finally, Blood Asura, previously, these seven sword techniques had just reached the level of a fourth-level absolute art. However, in the past 30 years, all seven sword techniques had made breakthroughs.

Now, these seven sword techniques had reached the level of a peak fourth-level absolute art, and their power had improved a lot. This meant that his own strength had also improved a lot.

“In just 30 years, I have made such great progress not only because of the Gold-splitting Secret Manual but also because of the three-pointers from Sword Saint Iceberg. He has helped me a lot,” Jian wushuang said with a smile.

At this moment…

“Mr. Heavenly Marquis!”
