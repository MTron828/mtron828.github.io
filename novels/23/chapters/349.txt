Chapter 350: The Gray Waterdrop Transforms!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

It was silent. All the spectators felt pity for Jian Wushuang.

Second Holy Master was suspended in the air, coldly staring at the huge pit.

It had been quite a while since Jian Wushuang had fallen, so everyone thought he must have died.

“Finally, I killed him?” Second Holy Master murmured.

He looked at himself and thought.

“If the other three masters see my current appearance, they would think I had a tough fight with the boy and laugh at me.”

He shook his head and looked toward where the Triple-kill Sword landed.

“I heard his sword is a first-grade magic weapon!” Second Holy Master’s eye lit up. Then he went to claim the sword.

But, right at this moment...

Buzz... A surge of invisible energy suddenly appeared.

“Hum?” Second Holy Master stopped and looked at the pit again.

Many spectators above the nearby space also looked toward it.

Boom!

The whole area seemed to shake for an instant, then the ground started to violently vibrate as if it was roaring.

In the huge pit, lots of stones began floating up. Then a figure slowly flew out.

“Jian Wushuang!”

Everybody stared at him in shock.

His clothes were dyed red by blood. His arms were a mess of blood and flesh, with even his bones being slightly visible.

His eyes were closed and his black hair fluttered.

A stream of aura spread out and began growing stronger and stronger.

As he moved to stand above the area... Rumble! It sounded like the whole world cracked. A great amount of Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy madly surged toward Jian Wushuang from all directions.

The Spiritual Power whistled through the area, surrounding Jian Wushuang in an instant and creating a great Spiritual Storm that radiated out 100 meters.

“Jesus!”

“That’s Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy!”

Lots of experts could not help but widen his eyes.

The Spiritual Storm was quite grand.

Jian Wushuang immersed himself in it.

A large amount of Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy was devoured by him. Owing to it, his aura became stronger and stronger. Previously, his aura had withered to a point where it might completely disappear, but now it had reached a new level, much stronger than before.

The aura kept soaring.

Swish!

The Triple-kill Sword trembled and then flew toward its owner, returning to Jian Wushuang’s grasp again.

His eyes were still closed, but at this moment, the two Sword Souls were radiating a brilliant light within his sea of consciousness.

Rumble... Two spectral images suddenly appeared behind his back.

The two spectral images looked the same as Jian Wushuang, but much bigger than him. Now they kept the same posture as their owner, with the Long Sword in their hands and their eyes closed.

Sword Soul Phantoms!

Two Sword Souls created two Sword Soul Phantoms.

Their Sword Essence was powerful.

“The boy is still alive!”

Second Holy Master’s face fell. Then a hint of killing intent flashed in his eyes. Whoosh! With one stride, Second Holy Master appeared before his opponent.

A surge of power gathered in his hand and he swung his Giant Hammer, which emitted an enormous energy. The moment it smashed forward, an explosive power swept out.

“Go to hell!”

Second Holy Master’s face was distorted. He did not know what his opponent was doing. However, he was frightened, so he would not give the boy any opportunities.

This attack was stronger than the previous one.

Jian Wushuang still had his eyes closed and did not seem to notice, but his two Sword Soul Phantoms opened their eyes, shooting out two streaks of light.

Like a sword strike, the lights swept out, causing two huge sword scars to appear in the sky and cracks to form in the ground.

At this moment, the Triple-kill Sword directly lashed out.

A casual stroke!

It contained no swords skills or tricks.

This simple stroke collided with the Giant Hammer. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Peng!

With a loud boom, Second Holy Master was blasted backwards, as if he had been hit by a bomb.

Boom! Boom! His body flew across the sky, humming violently.

After regaining his balance, Second Holy Master gasped while in shock.

All the spectators were petrified.

He had repelled Second Holy Master with a casual strike.

Jian Wushuang still kept the same posture, as if he had not launched an attack.

The great Spiritual Storm remained there and he was crazily devouring the Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy as if he would never be full.

As his aura soared, his face became ruddy. He had almost recovered, and his bloody arms seemed intact.

His bones, muscles, and even the tiny parts of his body were changing under the influence of the gray waterdrop.

Improve!

Transform!

With every breath, his body was being strengthened as much as dozens of times.

His aura became increasingly stronger.

“What, what on earth happened?”

“He was dying, but now...”

“He made a breakthrough at the last moment?”

Breakthrough?

All of them thought of this possibility.

After all, Jian Wushuang was at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm. He was a peerless genius, so he might be able to make a breakthrough.
