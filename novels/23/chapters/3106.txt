Chapter 3107: Proper Training

——

Xiu! Xiu!

Two scarlet rays of light were instantly thrown in front of the Four God and the rest, and then boom! Boom!

Following two earth-shaking booms, these two scarlet rays of light directly exploded, and a terrifying might suddenly erupt.

These two scarlet rays of light were actually two refined divine lightning of destruction. When either of them exploded, it was comparable to a rank four True Saint’s self-detonation.

When the two claps of thunder exploded together, the power of the explosion was extremely terrifying. It naturally had a certain impact on Four God and the others.

“Your Highness, let’s go!”

Yuan Chong threw out the two destructive divine claps of thunder and immediately turned to flee.

Prince Qing’s reaction was not slow, so he fled immediately.

“This Yuan Chong is quite smart.”

Jian Wushuang followed behind Yuan Chong and Prince Qing.

“You want to escape? You’re dreaming!”

A roar suddenly echoed in the void. Many figures struggled out of the mighty divine storm. They were the experts under the Third Prince.

The two destructive divine claps of thunder would only hinder them at most, but it was not realistic to harm them. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Now that they had escaped from the divine power storm, they immediately began to chase after them.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh

The sound of rushing wind was heard, and the figures were extremely fast.

While they were fleeing, whether it was Prince Qing, Yuan Chong, or Jian Wushuang, they all found that the distance between them was getting closer and closer.

In fact, with Jian Wushuang’s speed, he could leave as he pleased. The fourth level of the divine realm could not catch up with him at all. Yuan Chong was a True Saint at the peak of the fourth level. If he tried to run with all his might, it would not be easy for those people to catch up with him later.

The reason why the distance between them was getting closer and closer was that Princess Qing was too slow.

Although Princess Qing had some talent, she was only a rank one True Saint and was not very good at speed. Naturally, she could not compare with the rank three True Saint experts behind her.

“Princess Qing, I’ll carry you,” Yuan Chong suggested.

“It’s useless.” Jian Wushuang shook his head. “Mr. Yuan Chong, although you’re fast, he should be good at speed. He just hasn’t used his strength yet. Once he explodes his strength, Mr. Yuan Chong, you won’t be able to escape with Prince Qing!”

Yuan Chong’s face darkened.

He had worked with Shen Si, so he knew that Shen Si was very fast, but he was not willing to give up.

“At this point, there is only one way for Prince Qing to leave.” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold, but his body suddenly stopped in the void. “Mr. Yuan Chong, you take Prince Qing and leave. As for the people behind you, I will think of a way to stall them for a while.”

“You?”

Yuan Chong and Prince Qing were both stunned.

Behind them were a rank five True Saint, a dozen rank four True Saints, and many third rank experts.

There were so many experts, and Jian Wushuang was obviously only a rank three True Saint.

Was it possible for him to hold them off for a while?

Was it possible?

Although he knew it was impossible, Yuan Chong still nodded and said, “Please!”

“Thank you!” Prince Qing also gave Jian Wushuang a deep look.

Yuan Chong carried Prince Qing on his back and continued to run forward without stopping.

Jian Wushuang had already turned around and looked at Four God and the others. A subtle smile appeared on his lips.

On the surface, he stayed to help Prince Qing and Yuan Chong escape, but in fact, he stayed for himself.

After coming out of the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, he knew that his strength was at its peak. At this time, he needed to cultivate in peace. The outside world must temper him. Previously, he stayed in the mansion of the Sixth Prince to cultivate in seclusion, he already had peace.

But now, the 30 experts in front of him were at least at the level of a rank three True Saint. It was a suitable training for Jian Wushuang!

“After cultivating in seclusion for six years, my swordsmanship has improved a lot. Today, I can use these people to test my swordsmanship,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

He stood alone in front of nearly 30 experts like Shen Si, who sensed that Jian Wushuang only had the aura of a rank three True Saint and did not think much of him.

“Leaving a rank three True Saint here as cannon fodder? Do you want him to stop us? What a joke!” Shen Si smiled coldly. “You two stay here and kill him. The rest of you continue to chase after him.”

Shen Si gave the order, and his speed slowly began to increase.

Most of the experts ignored Jian Wushuang and directly passed by him, including Shen Si. Only two of the stronger rank three True Saints came to kill Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang watched Shen Si and the others pass by him, but he did not show any intention of stopping them.

“Boy, die!”

A low voice suddenly came from the front. The two rank three True Saints had already attacked Jian Wushuang.

Seeing that their magic weapons were already in front of him, Jian Wushuang moved.

Buzz!

A silver light suddenly flashed like a ghost.

The two men’s attacks passed through Jian Wushuang’s divine body, but they missed.

Whoosh!

A sword shadow suddenly lit up.

It was a cold and beautiful sword shadow that felt like a dream.

The sword light was dull, but it was incredibly fast.

It was too fast!

It was too fast!

At least for the two rank three True Saints, it was faster than they could imagine.

Chi! Chi!

The sword shadow first swept past the neck of a rank three True Saint, and the protective armor that this rank three True Saint was wearing was torn apart by the sword shadow like a piece of paper. The sword shadow passed through the neck and slashed toward the second rank three True Saint, the same scene appeared again.

In just one exchange, the heads of the two rank three True Saints were thrown away.

The venom of the evil god on Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword instantly invaded the divine bodies of the two rank three True Saints. The two rank three True Saints did not even have time to scream before they died.

On the other side, God Four and the others were still chasing after Prince Qing and Yuan Chong. God four rushed at the front, but suddenly…boom!

A vast and majestic aura suddenly burst out in the void, and then they found that a huge barrier had appeared in the void in front of them. Not only in front of them, but also in the surrounding void, the same barrier also appeared in the surrounding void.

The barrier was like a huge iron box, locking everyone in the center.

“The ruler seal rules over space and time. In this space and time, I…am the ruler!” Jian Wushuang stood where he was and murmured softly.
