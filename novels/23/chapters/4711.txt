4713 Destroying Jingchuan

Jian Wushuang was speechless. He had thought that he could call the three Emperors to end the battle when they left, but he did not expect that this Young Emperor would come back. This made Jian Wushuang’s firm state of mind loosen a little, but he felt helpless.

Looking at his exhausted appearance, just as he was considering whether to kick him away, another two or three powerful auras appeared.

Cheng Qing and the skinny purple-robed man caught the Young Emperor on both sides.

Chen Qing said awkwardly, “Brother, I’m sorry. We have to leave with the Young Emperor.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh of relief and quickly said, “Leave quickly.”

Cheng Qing nodded and prepared to leave with the Young Emperor.

“No, I can’t leave.” The Young Emperor struggled.

Jian Wushuang said helplessly, “I’ll be there soon.”

“Really?”

“Of course.”

The Young Emperor nodded in satisfaction and passed out.

Then, Chun Qiu arrived and smiled. “Brother Jian, it’s time to fight side by side again.”

Jian Wushuang smiled in return and looked back at the Young Emperor and the others who had gone far away. He secretly heaved a sigh of relief and opened the lid of the Boyang Bottle with one hand. “Emperors, I need help.”

“Damn, Boy, you’re actually so calm. I’m in this bottle, and even I can’t hold it in anymore!” The True Shadow of a long-bearded old man appeared from the bottle.

Then, an old man with strange polycoria followed closely behind, and the tall and thin old man was the last.

Along with the three True Shadows wearing tattered Emperor clothes, the entire Jingchuan was on the verge of collapse.

Their appearance had almost instantly reversed the situation in Tian City.

The brows of the leading Yan Immortals twitched at the same time. The figures that came out of nowhere had strange ripples on their bodies.

“Why do these guys have a familiar aura?” the tall and thin old man said.

“Who cares who they are, let’s kill them all first!” the awe-inspiring old man shouted domineeringly and immediately flicked his sleeves. The supreme pressure pressed forward almost instantly.

The power that belonged to another level directly withstood the pressure of nearly 1,000 Ancestor-level experts, which made Jian Wushuang relax and free up his hands.

The three Emperors attacked at the same time, and the outcome was almost decided.

The force was easily broken, and the three Emperors charged forward with ferocious smiles. With every wave of their hands, a group of Ancestor-level cultivators was destroyed, and even the few Yan Immortals could not resist them.

If Jian Wushuang could barely keep these True Souls in check, then with the appearance of the three Emperors, he would be reassured.

Ever since taking these three Emperors away from the Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes, Jian Wushuang had felt that it was unreal. He had gotten the help of the three Supreme almighties in a muddled state, which had almost allowed him to have the most terrifying trump card in the Great Yan Domain.

Jian Wushuang could not imagine how powerful the True Soul could be to kill a top cultivator so easily.

Looking at the three Emperors who had been destroyed so easily, Chun Qiu, who had been waiting for death, opened his eyes wide. Then, he looked at Jian Wushuang and smiled bitterly. “Brother Jian, when we went to the Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes, we were lucky that we didn’t use force. Otherwise, we would have been in trouble.”

Jian Wushuang agreed. If they had destroyed Yang Jun’s True Shadow, the tall and thin old man’s True Shadow, they would not be standing here in one piece.

At the same time, it could be seen that the Young Emperor sent them into the Heaven of Ten Thousand Eyes eyes to get rid of them through the hands of the three Emperors.

In this way, Jian Wushuang’s image of the Young Emperor became worse.

He was already planning to escape with Chun Qiu after eliminating the enemies in front of him.

No matter how powerful the Young Emperor was, could he possibly extend his hand to the entire Great Yan Domain?

After making up his mind, Jian Wushuang did not hesitate any longer. He activated his Yan power and his aura surged, turning into the sharpest long sword, piercing forward.

This extremely brutal battle eventually turned into a one-sided massacre with the arrival of the three Emperors.

With a miserable howl, the last Yan Immortal’s Immortal Source was crushed by the old man!

At this point, there were less than a hundred Ancestor-level experts left in the mighty army!

“Let, let us go…” The black-robed Ancestor-level expert in the lead retreated slowly, his eyes filled with despair.

Jian Wushuang looked at him coldly and clenched his fist in the air. The black-robed Ancestor clutched his neck in pain and struggled.

“Who sent you? Why are you trying to kill the Young Emperor?”

The two consecutive questions caused all the surviving black-robed Ancestors to reveal expressions of fear. If they were to reveal the truth, it would be no different from an immediate death sentence.

“Speak!” Jian Wushuang’s sharp brows furrowed and he increased the strength in his hand.

Feeling the horror of life and death that could not be any more real, the Ancestor-level expert in black robe was gasping for breath with difficulty. He no longer dared to hide anything. “I-I’m not sure either. It’s the P-Prince…”

Before he could finish his sentence, a strange black light burst out from his chest and burned his life source!

When the remaining black-robed Ancestors saw this, their faces were filled with horror as they scattered and fled in all directions!

Looking at the figures that were shooting in all directions, the dual-pupiled old man snorted coldly. The four pupils in his eyes started to spin in a strange manner.

In the next moment, the entire sky turned pitch black. Along with the darkness, countless strange eye rings that looked like the sun appeared!

All of the fleeing black-robed Ancestors felt as if they had entered a swamp, and the air around them began to stagnate.

Then, they subconsciously looked up at the sky and stared at the countless sun-like eyes.

It was as if something was being rapidly stripped away from their bodies, and at the same time, their long, almost endless lives began to flow backward…

Every top cultivator’s pupils turned from fear to listlessness, and finally to death. Then, they fell to the ground like pools of mud.

Jian Wushuang saw it clearly. When the top cultivators died, streams of origin flowed into the chakra in the sky.

This kind of power should be the sacred technique of the elder with polycoria.

“You’ve killed again. It’s a sin, a sin. Old man Su He, come and reflect with me,” The tall and thin old man said with a serious expression as he pulled the dual-pupiled old man. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The dual-pupiled old man retracted his sacred technique and pouted in disdain. “Stop it. The two of you have killed Yan Immortals. I’m afraid even the Heavenly Court can’t handle them. How dare you call it the karma of killing?”

“Look, your killing intent is almost covering up your True Heart. It seems that I will have to guide you in the future.” The tall and thin old man pouted.

“That’s enough,” the awe-inspiring elder said and then looked at Jian Wushuang, “What’s your next plan?”
