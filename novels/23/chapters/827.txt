Chapter 828: Preliminary

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Three months later, outside the Blood Hades City.

It was the day on which the Royal Guard would recruit new members. Numerous superior Divine Realm experts rushed there from the all corners of the Blood Hades Prefecture.

As the prefecture was a vast land full of experts and the Royal Guard was the most elite troop with a nice remuneration in the country, a great number of experts were gathered outside the Blood Hades City.

As a result, when Jian Wushuang arrived there, he could see a sea of faces. The amount of people there was estimated to be over one hundred thousand.

“There are so many people.”

Though he had expected there to be a crowd, he was still amazed by the scene.

One hundred thousand superior Divine Realm experts! More than all such experts in the Firmament Territory adding together, this was the turnout of candidates for a trial in the Blood Hades Prefecture.

As one of them, Jian Wushuang waited silently at the edge of the crowd.

In the void above the crowd were many sergeants in scarlet armors, their aura was chilling, they were the soldiers of the Blood Hades Prefecture. A well-built tall man and a blue-haired lady acted as their leaders.

These two were the commanders of the prefecture.

“This is a huge crowd,” said the tall man to the blue-haired lady while looking downwards.

“Yes, just as the previous years. Though people know there is a strict standard to join the Royal Guard, they still come here in droves. The participants standing before us are over one hundred thousand, but, no more than fifty of them will make it to the end,” the lady responded.

You’re reading on Thanks!

“I agree.” the tall man nodded and added, “Though the ordinary soldiers in the Royal Guard are superior Divine Realm experts, they are the elite among them, as powerful as the top Divine Realm experts.

“The soldiers of our prefecture are elites too, evenly matched to the Cercis Army of the Cercis Island, but they are inferior to the Royal Guard.”

“You’re right. But now it’s time to start the selection.” the blue-haired lady spoke.

The man observed the sky and nodded. He looked toward the crowd as he shouted.

“Attention everybody, !” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

His dignified voice immediately silenced the crowd. All participants all stood to attention as they looked at the man in awe.

“Listen up, many of you will not be able to join the Royal Guard, the best troop in the country.”

“Even the most ordinary soldier in the Royal Guard is chosen through a strenuous selection process, means that only one in every one thousand will make it.

“Next, you’ll have to go through the preliminary round held by our Blood Hades Prefecture.

“Get ready…”

The man’s booming voice reverberated throughout the area.

On hearing his voice, the superior Divine Realm experts among the crowd all took a deep breath to reach their peak.

In a moment, they prepared themselves for anything.

“Let’s begin!”

A sharp light escaped the man’s eyes as he shouted. Just then, an overwhelming force swept away from him.

It pressed the experts standing below him like a huge mountain on their shoulders.

All the experts looked as though they were struck by lightning.

“Puff!” “Puff!” “Puff!”

More than half of them could not resist coughing up a mouthful of blood and fell to their knees with a pale face under the pressure of the force.

As for those who remained standing, their face turned red with pain, and they were struggling to keep their balance.

“Is this an aura suppression?”

Among the crowd, Jian Wushuang was also under the man’s pressing aura.

As soon as he felt the aura, he knew that the tall man was a top Six Steps expert.

An expert of such strength, if he was to unleash the full power of his aura, he could explode a normal superior Divine Realm expert in an instant.

Though the tall man was trying to suppress one hundred thousand people at the same time, his aura was still unbearable to many experts.

Just in a short time, more than half of the experts had collapsed under the man’s aura.

Though the aura was powerful, Jian Wushuang was strong enough to bear it.

He might be only a Divine Realm expert, but, he was able to battle a Six Steps of the Eternal Realm expert. Even if the all the power of the tall man’s aura was on him, he would not be afraid.

All the superior Divine Realm experts struggled to hold on under the man’s aura.

As time went by, the aura grew stronger, bringing the experts to their breaking points. One after another, many experts tumbled to the ground, some fell to their knees and within a short time, less than eight hundred people remained standing.

Just then…

The blue-haired lady finally spoke up, “That’s enough.”

On hearing this, the tall man raised his eyebrows and restrained his aura. The struggling experts immediately felt the suppressing force on them disperse, and they all let out a sigh of relief, breathing heavily.

Right then, a scarlet-armored soldier walked to the tall man and reported to him. ” Commander, among all the participants, six hundred and eighty of them made it to the end standing under your aura.”

“That’s really a small number, isn’t it?” The tall man frowned.

“Not bad actually. In the previous years, less than six hundred of the participants made it to the end.” the blue-haired lady replied with a smile.

“Alright.” the tall man turned to the soldier and ordered, “have those six hundred and eighty people stay and tell everyone else to go back where they come from. They will not be able to join the Royal Guard as they couldn’t even pass the preliminary.”

“Yes, sir.” The soldier left to give the order.

As the order reached the participants, those who were informed that they did not pass the preliminary were unwilling to accept the results.

However, no matter how reluctant they were, they had to wait another one hundred years for the next selection of the Royal Guard.

With most of the participants’ leaving, the place became more spacious and relaxed.
