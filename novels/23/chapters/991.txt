Chapter 992: An Eye for An Eye!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“To pay?”

Jian Wushuang felt his face flushed with anger as rage was brewing in his heart.

With no ties with the Heavenly Ape Clan, he had not any intentions of intervening in the massacre. But everything is different, now that the Bone Devil Clan had dared incur his wrath.

“To your death, young man!”

With his face glowering and his eyes flaring with malice, the red-robed elder lunged at Jian Wushuang, appearing before him in the blink of an eye as his palms, adorned with similar runic markings on his skin, threatened to smash into his face. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The force of his stroke tore the fabric of Space asunder.

With this very stroke, the red-robed elder had fully unleashed his powers as a Rank One Dao Master in its fullness.

“Do you still intend to kill me?”

Harnessing his rage and aggression, Jian Wushuang channeled the Ancient God Powers he wielded and concentrated them upon his palms.

Grasped tightly into a fist, Jian Wushuang swung his arm forward, releasing the destructive forces that he had mustered.

It was a stroke that could even invoke a terrifying storm.

“Bam!”

Jian Wushuang’s fists crashed into the elder’s palms. A huge deafening boom ensued… followed by the sickening crunch of shattering bones.

“What?”

The elder’s eyes widened with panic. Stricken with fear and panic, he could hardly believe the sight of his entire arm erupting into an explosion of blood and flesh as shreds of his sinews and viscera scattered around.

The blow from Jian Wushuang’s fists was hardly weakened, transmitting straight into the torso of the elder.

“Hmph!”

With a painful grunt, the red-robed elder’s face paled instantly and he was suddenly thrown back as he staggered to maintain his balance. But he had barely steadied himself when a ghost-like apparition appeared beside him. With a giant fist glowing in a deep shade of gold, the figure reached for the neck of the temporarily incapacitated elder.

The elder in red, a powerful Dao Master of his tribe, was held in a vice-like grip by a giant hand like a filthy piece of rag.

“You were demanding that I pay the price of laying my hands on your kin, old man, were you not?” A deathly stare shone with extreme coldness from Jian Wushuang’s eyes as his bloodthirsty craving for the elder’s blood emanated strongly, blocking out completely what was left of the older man’s aura.

Frozen with fear, the elder could hardly move a finger as his eyes were filled with shock and terror.

Never did he expect that a young warrior of the Eternal Realm could pummel him into such a humiliating defeat.

“Help! Help!”

In the midst of his terror-struck hysteria, the red-robed elder immediately relayed a distress message, calling for help from the rest of his Clan.

“Stop!”

A sudden roar reverberated from the air and three figures sped from the site of the massacre far away with blinding speeds and stopped near Jian Wushuang.

The newcomers were two men and a woman, three of whom radiated whose aurae as strong as the crippled elder who was now held in Jian Wushuang’s grip. These were clearly powerful Dao Masters of their Clan.

“Please release the Elder Scorpion of our Clan, Young Sir.” The only woman of the three, who was dressed in a blue robe, first spoke. She had the strongest aura of the three, a Dao Master who was very close to reaching the level of Rank Two.

“Amusing indeed! And why should I listen to you?” Jian Wushuang snorted as his grip on the elder’s neck tightened. Helplessly incapacitated, the face of the older man was slowly turning purple.

“You dare defy us of the Bone Devil Clan?” The woman in blue shouted anxiously.

“The Bone Devil Clan?” The edges of Jian Wushuang’s curled into a vicious smirk. “Never have I meddled in your affairs. But it was your kinsmen who had offended me and tried to attack by viewing me as one of the Heavenly Ape Clan. Therefore I have decided to intercede on their behalf. We shall see what will you do with that.”

Jian Wushuang was, after all, a firebrand with a short fuse.

Even when he was but a young fledgling, he had the courage to challenge the strongest of the overlords of the Nanyang Continent.

With his current prowess as one of the strongest warriors of the Green Fire World, he would now have hardly any reservations in using his fists to subjugate anyone who dared offend him.

As a firm believer of the adage “An eye for an eye”, he was not one to forgive and forget since it was the Bone Devil Clan who had dared rouse his anger.

There would be no room for any leniency.

“Please! Elder Apricot! Save me!” The immobilized Elder Scorpion, who was held by Jian Wushuang, managing only the few words as best he could.

“Quiet!” The woman in blue snapped at him, swiftly turning into a more amicable and gentle demeanor as she tried to reason with Jian Wushuang. “I confess that it was our folly to have angered you, Young Sir. Please accept our humblest apologies. I beseech upon your kindness for the release of our Elder Scorpion.”

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang cocked an eyebrow and snorted indignantly as he loosened his grip. The frail figure of Elder Scorpion immediately slipped out of Jian Wushuang’s hand. With what was left of his strength, he scurried miserably to the side of the woman in blue, with fear and terror still lingering upon his face.

“My deepest thanks.” The woman said as she let out a sigh of relief.

Never before had the Bone Devil Clan been forced to surrender their dignity in such an ignominious manner. Then again, the blue-robed woman had learned that Jian Wushuang had defeated and crippled Elder Scorpion with merely one stroke.

The strength of Jian Wushuang was evident with his effortless defeat of Elder Scorpion, who was a Rank One Dao Master himself.

“He’s at least a Rank Two Dao Master, or even a Rank Two warrior who has reached the pinnacle with great brute strength.”?The woman in blue thought quietly to herself.

The strength and power that a Rank Two Dao Master wielded was sufficient to strike fear into the Bone Devil Clan. More so with the powerful display of Jian Wushuang’s strength which had disheartened the woman from uttering any objections, effectively smothering whatever ounce of defiance left in her.

“Word of the purge of the Heavenly Ape Clan was delivered to all other tribes and clans in the vicinity ten days ago, Young Sir. Therefore we had not expected any strangers or bystanders to be nearby. With our humblest regrets for offending you, we hope that you will leave us be with our business and withdraw from this area.” The woman said all the cordiality she could muster.

“Very well. But I will take that two with me.” Jian Wushuang spoke as his finger traced into the distance ahead of them.

It was the middle-aged man who had been running away from the site of the battle with his child in his arms. He had tried his best to put as much distance as possible, yet it was still hardly impossible for a Dao Master to catch up to him and slaughter them both.

In the midst of his panicked flight from the site of the battle, the middle-aged man had noticed what was happening behind him. But knowing that he could ill-afford any glance to his back, he chose to run as fast as he could.

“Very well.” The woman in blue nodded, her teeth gritted with unwillingness.

Releasing a pair of survivors of the Heavenly Ape Clan was hardly too expensive a price for the Bone Devil Clan.

“That’ll do.” Jian Wushuang began to turn around and shot a fleeting glare at the woman in blue. “You’d would best discipline your kinsmen and practice some humility and respect. Thank the stars for your fortune this time.”

With that, Jian Wushuang turned and left.
