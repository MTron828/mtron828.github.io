Chapter 2629: The Embarrassed Green Flame Territorial Lord

“Protect it? I’ll have to thank you then, Green Flame Territorial Lord,” replied Jian Wushuang.

“You don’t have to. The Northern Darkstar Territory and our Green Flame Star Territory are connected geographically—we should be helping each other,” teased the Green Flame Territorial Lord.

“In this case, you won’t have to protect the Blood Gem mineral vein anymore now that I’ve returned. You may now leave,” said Jian Wushuang.

“That won’t do.” The Green Flame Territorial Lord shook his head. “I’ve reported to Crimson Stone Fort about the Blood Gem mineral vein on your way back here. The Crimson Sone Fort has also dispatched some experts to retrieve this and had specifically ordered us to take good care of it before their arrival. Therefore, all of you will have to wait for Crimson Stone Fort’s representatives.”

Jian Wushuang’s expression turned cold after hearing that. “It seems the Green Flame Star Territory isn’t going to leave. I can only use a little trick to make you leave if that’s the case.”

“Did you ask me to leave? You’re quite confident, but I don’t know where your confidence is coming from,” the Green Flame Territorial Lord sneered and could not care less about Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was not angry but merely flipped his palm slowly.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!

Nine black Infernal Crimson Divine Swords appeared out of thin air in the void before Jian Wushuang. Those nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords each carried an infinite amount of Transmigration Strength.

“Are you going to fight? With that?” The Green Flame Territorial Lord said disdainfully.

“Master.” Cang Heng and the other commanders frowned.

However, Jian Wushuang merely smiled faintly before those nine black Infernal Crimson Divine Swords instantly transformed into nine huge meteorites and fiercely slammed toward the Green Flame Territorial Lord ahead.

The Green Flame Territorial Lord stood calmly on the spot until the nine huge meteorites appeared in front of him. His eyes narrowed slightly when the meteorites’ power spread out.

“These nine black swords seem quite powerful...”

The Green Flame Territorial Lord immediately took a shot and slammed the nine swords with a sledgehammer that appeared in his hands.

A Peak Earth Ultimate God’s divine power completely exploded with shocking power.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang...

After nine continuous clanging sounds, the nine huge meteorites transformed from the Infernal Crimson Divine Sword were sent flying out. The meteorite’s terrifying power then collided with the Green Flame Territorial Lord and was forced to retreat a few steps backward.

“This kid seems to be much stronger than an ordinary High-level Earth Ultimate Gods.” The Green Flame Territorial Lord held his hands together and prepared to make a move.

Suddenly...

“Congeal!”

Jian Wushuang only said a one-word command before the nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords instantly overlapped at an astonishing speed and caused a huge endless Reincarnation Passage to appear out of nowhere. A black divine sword encased in Transmigration Strength shot out from the end of that channel.

The black divine sword was the result of a perfect sword formation made from the nine overlapping Infernal Crimson Divine Swords.

Boom!

The black divine sword was like a huge awl with a terrifying power that penetrated the void and instantly appeared in front of the Green Flame Territorial Lord.

“T-this power...”

The Green Flame Territorial Lord was shocked upon feeling the power contained therein the black divine sword that was much stronger than him executing a blow with his full strength.

He was so horrified that he did not have much time to think and could only spontaneously swing the large hammer in his hand as the ripples spread out before firing a series of attacks.

Boom!

There was a loud noise as terrifying powers erupted from the black divine sword and the large hammer broke away from the Green Flame Territorial Lord’s hand for the first time. The black divine sword did not stop but continued to bombard the Green Flame Territorial Lord’s divine body.

“Puff!”

The Green Flame Territorial Lord shook slightly before spewing out a big mouthful of blood. His complexion instantly paled along with his body’s divine power breath dropped to an extremely low level.

Buzz!

The Transmigration Sword Formation formed from the nine overlapping Infernal Crimson Divine Swords returned to Jian Wushuang.

“Green Flame Territorial Lord, I’ll give you a chance—ten breaths. You and your people are to immediately return to the Green Flame Star Territory within just ten breaths of time. Otherwise, you’ll lie here forever.” Jian Wushuang folded his hands behind his back with his extremely cold gaze as he stared at the Green Flame Territorial Lord.

His mighty voice reverberated throughout heaven and earth.

The Green Flame Territorial Lord was trembling as he met Jian Wushuang’s gaze. Though his eyes were filled with resentment, they were filled with even more fear and reverent awe!

Jian Wushuang had just displayed a terrifying strength level which was too strong.

The Green Flame Territorial Lord was perplexed as he could see that Jian Wushuang was only a High-level Earth Ultimate God, yet Jian Wushuang’s sword formation defeated him in an instant. The Green Flame Territorial Lord would probably be dead had Jian Wushuang not held back his strength. He knew that Jian Wushuang’s strength level was far beyond his own.

He dared not defy Jian Wushuang’s command for him and his people to leave within ten breaths.

“Let’s go!”

The Green Flame Territorial Lord immediately ordered the Green Flame Star Territory Official Army to retreat. The Green Flame Territorial Lord along with his official army quickly left within a few breaths toward the Green Flame Star Territory.

The commanders of the Northern Darkstar Territory watched in awe and were completely stunned.

They were just saying that Jian Wushuang would not be able to change anything due to his inferior High-level Earth Ultimate God battle strength against the Peak Earth Ultimate God Green Flame Territorial Lord even if he returned.

Jian Wushuang surprisingly made a boldly lighting-fast shot and defeated the Green Flame Territorial Lord in the blink of an eye. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The strength gap was too wide apart.

Jian Wushuang’s strength completely exceeded their expectations.

“Our territorial lord has instantly defeated the Peak Earth Ultimate God Green Flame Territorial Lord. He’s so powerful!”

“I remember he was far from being this powerful when he fought San Shouwang not long ago. It didn’t take long for him to improve until this level, right?”

“He’s s-so powerful!”

The commanders looked at Jian Wushuang with deep awe and reverence.

“Cang Heng.” Jian Wushuang glanced at Cang Heng. “Bring some people to take over the mineral vein and try to figure out in the shortest time possible the quantity of Blood Gem we have in the mineral vein since the Green Flame Star Territory’s people are gone.”

“Yes.” Cang Heng obeyed the order and immediately left with some people to do the surveying before presenting the results quite soon to Jian Wushuang.
