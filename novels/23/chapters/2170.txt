Chapter 2171 Rematch With Demon King Chen Yu

Emperor Bai was in golden armour and stood there in the space in front of the blood-red formation. He had reached the fighting power of a stage four great emperor.He displayed his terrifying combat power and suppressed everything around.

It was extremely difficult for Kaiser Blood to stop Emperor Bai alone, hence Lord Fen had stepped up to help him.

Lord Fen was surrounded in a special aura which allowed it to have peak stage three great emperor fighting power. It seemed that he had cast a secret skill which allowed him to stop Emperor Bai together with Kaiser Blood.

Even though Emperor Bai was powerful, he could not spare any attention to attack the Opposing Blood Formation.

The Opposing Blood Formation was running slowly as its radius increased slowly.

Jian Wushuang and everyone around noticed this.

“Emperor Bai was stopped. We need to find a way to stop the Opposing Blood Formation.” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

“Tian Chen, do you still have the Emperor Token?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Emperor Token?” Ancestor Tian Chen was stunned.

The emperor token that contained the power of an attack by Emperor Bai?

“We used two just now to save some lives against the experts from Three Emperors World who went into the demonic state. We are only left with one.” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

“Pass me the last Emperor Token.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Roger.” Ancestor Tian Chen nodded his head.

The final Emperor Token was passed to Jian Wushuang.

“Be careful.” Ancestor Tian Chen warned.

“Yes. All of you should take this time to recover.” Jian Wushuang said.

Abysmal Saint Master, Ancestor Tian Chen, Underworld God and the remaining experts nodded their heads.

Even they as great emperors were severely injured after the self-destruction of the great emperors from the Three Emperors World.

Even though they had already drunk elixirs, it was impossible to reach their peak again in a short period of time.

However, their peak fighting power was not needed. All that was needed was their normal fighting power.

There were more than two thousand experts and several great emperors. A stage three great emperor also could not stop so many experts if they allied together.

Jian Wushuang held the emperor token in his hand and felt the terrifying power inside.

“Jian Yi, lets go!” Jian Wushuan moved.

Jian Yi followed him closely.

Both of them speeded forward. They were not headed to the battlefield Emperor Bai, Kaiser Blood and Lord Fen were in. They skirted the area and headed for the Opposing Blood Formation.

The Opposing Blood Formation was their target.

Even though Jian Wushuang did not know where the formation originated or its functions, he was becoming more and more uncertain as the Opposing Blood Formation continued to run.

No matter what, this Opposing Blood Formation had to be destroyed!

Right when Jian Wushuang moved, Demon King Chen Yu rushed over immediately.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Two figures burst forth.

They were Demon King Chen Yu and Ba Su. Leng Ruxue stood there motionless and was not moving.

“Jian Wushuang, if you want to destroy the formation, you will have to pass through me.” Demon King Chen Yu yelled as he attacked Jian Wushuang.

Ba Su stared at Jian Wushuang with emotions raging through his eyes. He wanted to kill Jian Wushuang as badly as Demon King Chen Yu did.

Jian Wushuang ordered Jian Yi to stop them immediately.

“You opponent is me.” Jian Yi stopped Ba Su in his tracks and said coldly.

“A mere stage two great emperors dares to stop me? Die!” Ba Su yelled as he started his fight with Jian Yi.

Jian Yi used all of his might to stop Ba Su.

In terms of realm, he was at a disadvantage.

Ba Su was a legitimate stage three great emperor. Even though he had barely made it into stage three and was not powerful compared to his peers, he was still much stronger than any stage two great emperor.

On the other hand, Jian Yi was just a peak stage two great emperor.

However, Jian Yi came from the Ancient Past and knew certain special techniques. He could not be compared to any stage two great emperors.Even though he was completely suppressed by Ba Su, if it was not possible to kill in within a short period of time.

Jian Yi kept Ba Su occupied as Jian Wushuang focused his attention on Demon King Chen Yu.

“Jian Wushuang, you will not advance anymore since I am here.” Demon King Chen Yu erupted in size as eight arms grew out of his body.

Each of his arms held a different type of divine weapon.

“What a joke.” Jian Wushuang mocked Demon King Chen Yu.

The first time he fought Demon King Chen Yu, Demon King Chen Yu was far stronger than him. All he could do was to run away.

The second time they fought at the Heaven Repairing Palace, he was only at a slight disadvantage.

He was slightly stronger than Demon King Chen Yu when they fought at the Imperial City for the third time.

But now, this was their fourth time… Jian Wushuang had managed to control the legitimate Hong Jun Golden Sword and hence was even stronger than before. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Furthermore, he no longer needed to hide certain techniques and could use them.

“Piss off!” Jian Wushuang yelled as he cast Blast Rainstorm using his Blood Mountain Sword.

As the sword light appeared, the seven Hong Jun Golden Swords burst forth at the same time.

Seven golden beams flew incredibly quickly and each had the power of an attack by a stage three great emperor.

Demon King Chen Yu swung one of his arms and just managed to block the sword lights. Right then, the seven Hong Jun Golden Sword appeared in front of him.

“Humph!” Demong King Chen Yu grunted as all of his arms swung the weapons they were holding outwards.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

Following seven loud collisions, the terrifying force pushed Demon King Chen Yu back.

“This brat. Did the power of his Hong Jun Golden Swords really get stronger?” Demon King Chen Yu knitted his eyebrows and thought.

In the next moment, the seven Hong Jun Golden Swords which he had deflected away trembled in mid-air before they dashed towards him once again.

The speed was the same as before.

“Damn it!.” Demon King Chen Yu cursed.

He knew about the power of the Hong Jun Golden Swords. They were incredibly fast and powerful. He knew clearly that Jian Wushuang could beat him in a head-on fight just by using these seven swords.

Furthermore, Jian Wushuang possessed incredible close combat abilities and swordsmanship.
