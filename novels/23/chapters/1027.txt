Chapter 1028: Generosity

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Sunrise Sword Emperor was a myth in the Green Fire World, a bloody one.

Though he became famous later than Empyrean Patriarch, he was far more powerful than him.

Most important of all, he was a capricious loner. He killed others to his liking without any scruples at all.

Like Samsara Temple Master and Void Temple Master, Empyrean Patriarch admired their strength but did not fear them too much.

After all, they were detached and had quite a?lot of things to worry about. Thus, they would never kill him unless he crossed the bottom lines of the Green Fire World. But Sunrise Sword Emperor was different.

If he destroyed the Rock Demon Clan today and annoyed him,?it was perfectly possible for him to kill him and leave him no chance to escape.

“It was Jian Wushuang who killed my son. If I exterminate this population in order to vent my anger but offend Sunrise Sword Emperor, that’s definitely not a good thing for me.” Empyrean Patriarch murmured and produced a result.

“Let’s go!”

He waved his hand, turned around, and left.

The 10 Protectors behind him were greatly surprised at this.

They thought that Empyrean Patriarch would eliminate the Rock Demon Clan, however…

They followed Empyrean Patriarch and did not dare to ask more questions.

“Empyrean Patriarch, please forgive me for not seeing you out.”

God Hong and other experts finally sighed with relief after Empyrean Patriarch left. Then, God Hong took out a token.

“Jian Wushuang, Empyrean Patriarch did cause me trouble and even planned to wipe out my clan personally. But as you told me, I took him to that valley and declared that we have friendly relations with Sunrise Sword Emperor but are unfamiliar with you. He then left directly.” God Hong sent out such a message.

Jian Wushuang, who still stayed in somewhere in this territory that was even not far from the Rock Demon Clan, received this message. A smile crept over the corners of his mouth.

“It’s exactly as I expected.” Jian Wushuang laughed gently.

He conjectured that given Empyrean Patriarch’s character, there was a good chance that he would vent his anger on the Rock Demon Clan. So when leaving there, he had a word with God Hong and told him to take Empyrean Patriarch there.

This result lived up to his expectations.

“Though Empyrean Patriarch is intractable, he must fear Sunrise Sword Emperor. He is not so foolish to risk offending Sunrise Sword Emperor in order to eliminate the Rock Demon Clan.” Jian Wushuang murmured.

“Hmph, that’s owed to Sunrise Sword Emperor’s deterrence. What if Empyrean Patriarch is not afraid of him? What should you do then?” Gu King suddenly snorted, “Don’t think that I don’t know you could have left this territory a few days ago, but you choose to stay here. Obviously, you are worried about the Rock Demon Clan. If he really attacks that clan, you will immediately show up, right?”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang smiled helplessly and did not say much.

He did prepare to turn up to divert Empyrean Patriarch’s attention if he really attacked the Rock Demon Clan.

Of course, he would only use his Slaughter Body and would not be so foolish to put his life in the hands of Empyrean Patriarch.

“Jian Wushuang, I won’t stop you from doing so in the Green Fire World. But I must warn you that you mustn’t incur unnecessary trouble and get involved in something that doesn’t concern you when you are in the Eternal Chaotic World. Don’t forget how my last master, King Luo Zhen, died!” Gu King said solemnly.

“I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded in agreement. Later, he looked up at the Void in front of him.

“It’s time to go to the Divine Monster Territory.”

“I have just created the third Sword Principle—Scarlet Yang Sword Principle, but I haven’t contrived any swordsmanship that matches it. Furthermore, there are also many shortcomings in the Ruthlessness that I designed for the Coalescence Sword Principle. I need to study hard.”

Jian Wushuang finally set off.

It was a long way from where he was now to the Divine Monster Territory and it would take him a dozen years even if he moved at top speed. Moreover, he would delve into his Sword Principles and swordsmanships on the trip. Thus, he would spend more time on the journey. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

He was not in a hurry because he had enough patience.

During the stop-and-go journey, he made some progress in Sword Principles.

And in the third year that he left the Rock Demon Clan, he received two messages in one day.

They were from Dragon Wing Governor and Dao Master Dreamless. The contents of the two messages were almost the same.

“Jian Wushuang, Empyrean Patriarch went mad. He offered a reward of 20 Chaos Gems for capturing you on the entire Samsara Continent. Whoever finds your trail and sends him the message will get 20 Chaos Gems!”

“In addition, he deliberately stated that you are at the Eternal Realm but your battle strength reaches the Peak of Rank Three Dao Master Level. By the way, he told everyone that you are a Warrior major in Sword Principle. Presently, all populations on the Samsara Continent and some solitary experts went bananas. A lot of people began to track you.”

“Jian Wushuang, you must be very careful. Apart from that, don’t act rashly. Once you reveal your battle strength, others can recognize you as easy as pie.”

Dragon Wing Governor had a good relationship with Jian Wushuang. Moreover, Jian Wushuang saved him, and he appreciated that a lot.

And Dao Master Dreamless was a friend of Jian Wushuang.

As soon as they knew this, they immediately informed Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded after receiving the news.

“Offer a reward of 20 Chaos Gems for capturing me?” He looked shocked and could not help but exclaim, “How generous he is!”

That was not exaggerating!

Everyone knew that a Chaos Gem was almost worth the fortune of a Rank Three Dao Master.

A Peak Rank Three Dao Master possessed four to five Chaos Gems at most. However, Empyrean Patriarch took out 20 Chaos Gems at a time.

Furthermore, he did not mean to kill Jian Wushuang with the 20 Chaos Gems. Whoever informed him Jian Wushuang’s trace could obtain them. Jian Wushuang believed once the news spread, there must be numerous experts on the Samsara Continent searching for him crazily.
