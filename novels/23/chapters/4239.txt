Inside the Great Void Temple, the black Spire stood upright like a sword and Thunder rumbled in the sky.

The seven Hall Masters of the Great Void Temple all stood respectfully below the spire. They bowed their heads and cupped their hands, their expressions solemn.

“Rumble!”

A thunderbolt suddenly exploded in the sky!

A middle-aged man in a royal robe walked down from the sky.

This middle-aged man was the founder of the Great Void Temple, Divine Emperor Tai Xu!

“Greetings, Sir divine Emperor!”

The seven hall masters knelt on the ground and spoke at the same time.

The middle-aged man’s entire body was bathed in lightning, with lightning snakes circling around him. He nodded indifferently and said, “You may rise.”

“Yes!” The seven hall masters stood up.

“I’ve returned this time to discuss two things.” Divine Emperor Tai Xu stood with his hands behind his back and spoke indifferently.

The seven hall masters did not say a word and listened to Divine Emperor Tai Xu’s words.

“Firstly, I will no longer be the Emperor God of the Great Void Temple. I have already chosen the person who will take over the position of Emperor God.” Divine Emperor Tai Xu spoke indifferently.

As soon as these words were spoken, the palace masters of the seven palaces burst into an uproar!

“Sir Divine Emperor, you must not do this!” Immediately, a few Palace Masters walked out from among the seven Palace Masters and cupped their hands in greeting.

“When has it ever been anyone’s turn to dispute the things I’ve decided?” Divine Emperor Tai Xu looked at them indifferently.

Immediately, the hall masters trembled and did not dare to say anything more. They only had many thoughts in their minds.

However, before they could think further, Divine Emperor Tai Xu continued, “After I leave, the first hall master, Bing Ye, will be in charge of becoming Emperor God Taixu. The seven halls of the Great Void Temple will have to listen to Hall Master Bing Yi’s command. Do you understand? ”

The seven hall masters of the Great Void Temple looked at Hall Master Bing Ye with complex expressions.

Hall Master Bing Ye’s expression did not change much upon hearing this. He merely cupped his hands and said, “Celestial Emperor, don’t worry. I will definitely manage the Great Void Temple well and not let you down.”

Divine Emperor Tai Xu nodded his head in satisfaction after hearing that. then, he changed the topic and continued, “The second thing is that it’s time to remove the seal on Qiu Long and let him rule the Ancient Path of Stars.”

“What? That madman is about to be released?”

“I don’t know if it’s a good thing or a bad thing to let this madman out.”

The hall masters of the seven halls frowned. However, they also knew that with the death of Divine Son Qing Xu, the only way for the Great Void Temple to obtain a position on the Ancient Path of Stars was to release Qiu Long and head to the Ancient Path of Stars.

Divine Emperor Tai Xu’s eyes flashed and he turned to look at the black tower behind him.

He waved his hand, and the black iron gate of the Black Tower behind him slowly opened.

Behind the door was endless darkness. Gusts of old dust were blown out of the door along with a cold wind.

Then, they heard heavy panting coming from the iron gate, as if a monster was about to break out.

Chi…chi…chi…

Chi…chi…chi…

The sound of iron chains rubbing against the floor was heard. A moment later, a hunched monster gradually walked out of the darkness of the minaret.

The monster’s skin was green, and there was a row of spikes on its back. Its hands and feet were shackled with black iron.

“The taste of freedom.” The monster raised its head and sighed, slowly opening its eyes.

There were only the whites of his eyes, no eyeballs.

He turned his head to look at the seventh Palace’s Palace Master and laughed hideously, “Seven hall masters. It’s been ten chaos cycles, I suppose. Long time no see.”

When the seven Hall Masters heard this, they coldly snorted without any expression.

The monster wanted to continue speaking but Divine Emperor Tai Xu said indifferently, “Qiu Long, I let you out this time because I have something for you to do.”

“Hehe, I knew it. You guys definitely need me for something.” Hearing this, Qiu Long chuckled and then pouted, “Isn’t this your usual way of doing things? when you need me, you release me. After you’ve used me, you’ll seal me.”

Divine Emperor Tai Xu frowned when he heard that and said indifferently, “After you’ve done this, I can truly set you free.”

“Oh?” Qiu Long’s pupils shrank, and a trace of suspicion flashed through his eyes.

“Divine Emperor, are you serious?”

“When have I ever lied to you when I speak?” Divine Emperor Tai Xu replied indifferently.

“Alright!” Hearing this, Qiu Long rolled his eyes and said, “Divine Emperor, speak. What do you need me to do this time?”

“I let you out this time because I want you to represent the great void immortal sect and head to the last city on the Ancient Path of Stars to compete for the chance to participate in the myriad clan Grand meeting in the universe.” Divine Emperor Tai Xu said.

“The Ruler Ancient Path of Stars? But…a Ruler?” Hearing this, Qiu Long sneered in disdain, and a flash of ruthlessness flashed in his eyes.

Divine Emperor Tai Xu waved his right hand and the shackles on Qiu Long disappeared.

All of a sudden, an earth-shaking aura surged with Qiu Long as the center!

Qiu Long slowly straightened his back and twisted his neck, making cracking sounds.

Not long after, Divine Emperor Tai Xu left the Great Void Star area.

Just as Qiu Long was about to head for the Ancient Path of Stars, Supreme Bing Ye suddenly called out to him.

“Qiu Long, after you go to the Ancient Path of Stars, help me kill someone.”

“Oh?”

Qiu Long raised his eyebrows and became interested, “Kill who?”

Supreme Bing Ye flipped his right hand and a Mystic Light mirror appeared in his hand. He handed it to Qiu Long and said,

“Let’s kill this man in the mirror.”

Qiu Long lowered his head and looked at the mirror. He saw a cold-looking young man in a black robe holding a blood-red divine sword.

“Who is he?”

Asked Qiu Long with a frown.

“Blood Sword.”

Supreme Ying Ye spat out these two words indifferently.

…

Meanwhile, back on the ancient path of the starry sky…

Jian Wushuang and Ruler Hao Jin stepped into the Tenth City.

“Lord Blood Sword, in front of us is one of the nine overlords, Lord Blue.”

Ruler Hao Jin said as he pointed at the largest castle in the Tenth City. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Lord Blood Sword, the first ten cities are different from the last eight cities on the Ancient Path of Stars. The City Lord of the Tenth City is also known as the pass suppression envoy. If you want to go to the last eight cities, you must obtain the pass-through document from the pass suppression envoy. Lord Blue is the pass suppression envoy of the Tenth City.”

Jian Wushuang nodded and replied, “Let’s go. Let’s go and meet that Lord Blue.”

The two of them walked toward the fortress.

Along the way, many people fixed their eyes on Jian Wushuang.

“This person…the Blood Sword?”

“As expected, I knew that the Blood Sword would come to the tenth city and enter the last eight cities.”

“There are many good friends of Heavenly Snake Playboy in the last eight cities. I’m afraid that trouble will come one after another when the Blood Sword enters the Eighth City.”

“I just don’t know if he can pass Lord Blue’s test.”

Jian Wushuang was expressionless, as if he had not heard the discussion. He walked closer to the huge fortress.
