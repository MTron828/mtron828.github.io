Chapter 2200 Master Wang

“Master Wang, I have prepared all the materials needed to make the Fiery Purple Dragon Howl Elixir, including the blood essence. You see…” The elder man with brown hair said.“Fiery Purple Dragon Howl Elixir is a high level elixir. Even though I can make it, it will not be easy,” Wang Yuan said lazily.

The elder with brown hair was an emperor god and understood what Wang Yuan meant and smiled. “Don’t worry Master Wang. I have prepared millions of Doctrine Gems and other special materials as thanks for your service, Hall Master Yuan.”

Hall Master Yuan waved his hand as a Qian Kun Ring appeared.

This ring had been prepared by the elder man in brown hair and he passed it to Hall Master Yuan and asked him to bring it into Wushuang City. This place was part of the Green Fire World and the elder man could not enter personally. He could only send a consciousness embodiment in. A consciousness embodiment could not bring a Qian Kun Ring in.

Doctrine gems were packed densely within this ring and stacked as high as a mountain. There were also many other treasures.

These were high level treasures which were required to make many high level elixirs.

Wang Yuan scanned the Qian Kun Ring casually before he continued, “It is not easy to make the Fiery Purple Dragon Howl Elixir. I will try my best to make one for you since you are so sincere. However, I cannot be sure I can make it in one try. If I fail, the set of materials will go to waste. Hence… You will need to prepare a few more sets of raw materials.”

“Master Wang, you are right. I have thought of this, hence I prepared three sets of raw materials,” The elder man replied.

“Three sets? That is too little. I need at least five sets of materials and I can guarantee you one Fiery Purple Dragon Howl Elixir,” Wang Yuan said.

“Five?” The elder man’s face twitched.

The Fiery Purple Dragon Howl Elixir was of a very high level, on par with the Ice Soul Elixir.

The materials of these elixirs were not cheap.

He did not have the ability to throw in tremendous resources to search for the raw materials, unlike Sanctuary Alliance in order to help Jian Wushuang to awaken from his slumber. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Even so, there were insufficient raw materials. Wang Yuan could make around ten of such elixirs with one set of raw materials thanks to his ever-improving and professional alchemy skills.

This elder man was a mere emperor god. It took him tremendous effort to search for these three sets of raw materials.

Two more sets…

The elder man looked at Wang Yuan with his fists clenched.

He knew clearly that the Fiery Purple Dragon Howl Elixir was of a similar difficulty level to the Ice Soul Elixir. With Wang Yuan’s alchemist skills, he could definitely make at least one elixir with three sets of materials.

Him wanting three sets meant that he wanted to reap more benefits.

Even so, there was nothing he could do.

He desperately needed the Fiery Purple Dragon Howl Elixir. Even though within the Eternal Chaotic World, there were ways passed down from the ancient past to make this elixir, few alchemists could make it. He tried to ask another alchemist to make this elixir for him. The other alchemist too asked for great amounts of resources and treasures. Furthermore, the other alchemist asked for ten sets of raw materials to guarantee the return of one elixir.

Wang Yuan’s request seemed decent given that other alchemists had asked for even more benefits to make the same elixir.

The elder man looked at Hall Master Yuan pleadingly.

Hall Master Yuan smiled subtly before he said, “Mr Wang Yuan, Emperor God Jin Luo took tens of thousands of years to gather three sets of raw materials. It would be difficult for him to find another two more sets. Hence…”

“Understood. Give me four sets of raw materials. I should be able to make one Fiery Purple Dragon Howl Elixir if I give it my all.”

Hearing this, Hall Master Yuan nodded his head and said no more.

The elder man knitted his eyebrows.

It would not be easy for him to gather even one more set of raw materials.

“If you cannot prepare four sets of raw materials, I am sorry to say that I cannot help you,” Wang Yuan said.

“No, no. I just need some time. I will go prepare now,” the elder man said.

“Once you are done with the preparations, pass the materials to Hall Master Yuan. I will inform you once I am free and successfully make your elixir. Nowadays, I am busy making the Ice Soul Elixir for my brother. The faster you prepare, the faster I can plan my schedule,” Wang Yuan said.

“Yes,” The elder man nodded his head in a hurry, afraid that Wang Yuan would regret his decision.

“Oh yes. Leave the Qian Kun Ring behind,” Wang Yuan said.

The brown hair elder man left the ring behind and left, distressed.

After the elder man left…

“Mr Wang Yuan. You have just made an excellent deal. With your alchemist skills, one set of raw materials is more than enough to make one Fiery Purple Dragon Howl Elixir. Now you will get four sets, with an additional one million Doctrine Gems and numerous treasures. I am afraid no one within the Eternal Chaotic World can match your speed in obtaining resources and treasures,” Hall Master Yuan smiled.

“Haha. Back in the Ancient Worlds with my brothers, my family ran a trading corporation. I know how to maximise the benefits for myself in a trade,” Wang Yuan laughed.

He was not afraid that the elder man would not meet his conditions.

In the Eternal Chaotic World, no one would dare to call themselves the best alchemist if they declared themself second.

It was because he received a big opportunity in the ancient battlefield. He had managed to get the legacy from the Ancient Past and he knew how to make many elixirs from the ancient past.

After this news spread, his life had been very smooth sailing.

There would be almighties, even great emperors who would find him and ask him to make some elixirs for them, though it came with a great price.

Wang Yuan and Hall Master Yuan chatted casually, unaware that there was a man behind them listening to whatever they said.

“Wang Yuan. You are leading quite a good life.”

A gentle voice appeared as Jian Wushuang walked out, smiling.

“Of course. My life is…” Wang Yuan replied instinctively before he stopped. His eyes widened in surprise.

This voice sounded very familiar.
