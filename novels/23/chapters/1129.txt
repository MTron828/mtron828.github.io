Chapter 1130: The Blaze Quicksand Gourd

“He is very likely to become a Universe Master and definitely will become a Celestial Master. That means if he doesn’t die, he is destined to be the leader of the Green Fire Palace!”

The barefoot bald man’s eyes surged with killing intent.

“I cannot allow him to become a Celestial Master!”

“Deliver my order! Ask ‘Axe’ to fix his eyes on Jian Wushuang and do his utmost to figure out his trump cards. Then contrive a method to cooperate with other experts from the Jin Kingdom to kill him. If necessary, kill him at the risk of exposing himself!”

The command of the bald man was quickly conveyed.

Jian Wushuang did not know that the senior officials of the Jin Kingdom had already targeted him. He headed toward the Green Fire Palace after leaving the area where the Dan Xin Palace was at.

It took him more than 20 years to return to the Green Fire Palace.

“I’m back!”

Jian Wushuang felt so good after returning to the Green Fire Palace.

For the first time, he spent less than a hundred years on that giant battlefield, but he had gained considerably. In terms of strength, he was much powerful than he was when he newly entered the battlefield.

“Jian Wushuang, go to the Fire Point Exchange Office,”?asked Gu King.

“Ok.”?Jian Wushuang nodded. He was planning to go there as well.

“I have acquired a lot of Life Elixirs outside the Dan Xin Palace. They are all Fire Points.”

Jian Wushuang soon came to the Fire Point Exchange Office and immediately took out the Life Elixirs he had obtained.

He had attained 29 Life Elixirs and each one of them was worth 10,000 Fire Points. He left four Life Elixirs in case of emergency and exchanged the rest for Fire Points. So, he now owned a total of 250,000 Fire Points.

“I exchanged the treasures Dao Yuanzi left earlier but only gained 13,800 Fire Points. Their value is inferior to two Life Elixirs.”?Jian Wushuang sneered.

“Hmph, you are lucky and just happened to encounter the appearance of the Dan Xin Palace, otherwise, there would be no chance for you to earn so many Life Elixirs. Moreover, these Life Elixirs are less valuable in the Eternal Chaotic World.”?Gu King sneered,?“In the Eternal Chaotic World, a drop of the Ancient God Power is much more expensive than a Life Elixir. But it is only worth 5,000 Fire Points here.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Hmm…”?Jian Wushuang was speechless.

He also knew that the reason why Life Elixirs had such a high value was that the Green Fire Palace badly needed them currently. Nonetheless, although the Ancient God Power was rarely seen in the Eternal Chaotic World, it was much easier to be discovered on this battlefield. And that explained why its value would be so low.

“All right, forget about that. Now that you possess enough Fire Points, there’s something that you can exchange,”?asked Gu King.

“What?”?Jian Wushuang asked.

“Look at those special treasures.”?Gu King answered.

Jian Wushuang immediately fixed his eyes on them. There were numerous treasures of all sorts with different functions in the Fire Point Exchange Office.

“Look at the special treasure whose value ranks the second—the Blaze Quicksand Gourd.”?Gu King answered.

“Oh?”?Jian Wushuang scanned the Blaze Quicksand Gourd.

“The Blaze Quicksand Gourd… contains a lot of Blaze Quicksands and a Secret Skill. It can form a Realm to suppress your enemy and trap him. It costs 210,000 Fire Points.”

“It’s so expensive!”?Jian Wushuang gasped in shock.

He sold 25 Life Elixirs and only received 250,000 Fire Points. But this Blaze Quicksand Gourd would cost him 210,000 Fire Points.

Even a Chaos Magic Treasure would not demand such an exorbitant price.

“There are a few good things in the Fire Point Exchange Office. I have observed them and discovered the Blaze Quicksand Gourd when you first came here. Unfortunately, It costs too many Fire Points and you couldn’t afford it before, so I didn’t mention it. Now, however, you can exchange it since you own enough Fire Points,”?

asked Gu King.

“It should be a treasure that uses Realm to suppress others from its introduction. It indeed is useful to me, but don’t you think it demands an excessively high price?” Is it really worth of so many Fire Points?”?Jian Wushuang could not help but ask.

“Yes, of course!”?Gu King continued,?“Boy, although you haven’t been to the Eternal Chaotic World, you know that Chaos Gems are the transaction currency there. Normally, the whole fortune of a Celestial Master is about 20 Chaos Gems.”

“I know.”?Jian Wushuang nodded.

He killed Dao Yuanzi and attained a few Chaos Gems.

“But do you know how many Chaos Gems does the Blaze Quicksand Gourd cost in the Eternal Chaotic World?”?asked Gu King.

“How many?”?Jian Wushuang asked.

“At least 400,000 Chaos Gems. Even if someone is willing to pay a high price for it, there are simply not so many Blaze Quicksand Gourds on the market.”?Gu King answered.

“What?”?Jian Wushuang was astonished.

He had never been to the Eternal Chaotic World and did not have a throughout understanding of the value of the Chaos Gem. But he could judge its value from the total fortune of a Celestial Master.

A Celestial Master’s fortune was worth around 20 Chaos Gems. 400,000 Chaos Gems were 20,000 times of that!

“The Blaze Quicksand Gourd is indeed very precious, like the Jin Kingdom… Although its monarch is powerful, even if you sell him, he isn’t worth 400,000 Chaos Gems, under normal circumstances. However, the Green Fire Palace and the Jin Kingdom have obtained plenty of opportunities and treasures on this giant battlefield, and thus, their wealth cannot be judged by common sense.”

“But in any case, using 210,000 Fire Points to exchange the Blaze Quicksand Gourd is absolutely worthwhile!”?asked Gu King.

“That will be good.”?Jian Wushuang smiled.?“My strength meets a bottleneck now. If I want to improve it, I can only make a breakthrough in Sword Principles. I’m required to advance the first Sword Principle to the highest level and become a Dao Master. I assume there won’t be any external treasures that enable my strength to increase by leaps and bounds.”

“In terms of defensive ability, I possess the Blood-killing Plate Armor and the Golden Image Secret Skill. So, this aspect cannot be improved either. Now the only thing I can promote is the special skill used for self-saving and killing enemies.”

“The Blaze Quicksand Gourd suits me well!”

Neither Jian Wushuang’s attack nor his defense could be improved presently. Naturally, he could only perfect the special skills that enabled him to kill enemies.
