Chapter 2291 Incineration Moon City, Nine Years of Snow

The core of the earth... the Absolute Beginning Divine World.Incineration Moon City, a normal city in the Absolute Beginning Divine World.

It was an afternoon of early summer. The skies were supposed to be clear, but instead, snow was falling all over the city.

Snow fell from the sky like goose feathers, coating the entire Incineration Moon City in a layer of silver.

Strangely, the snow did not fall for only a day or two. It had started a long time ago and had not stopped since. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The streets were crowded. Despite the harsh weather, people wore thin layers of clothing, not one bit afraid of the cold.

Occasionally, armoured soldiers would walk pass and melt the accumulated snow on the streets with their pure Divine Power.

Thank the heavens for those soldiers. Without them, the city would have long been buried in snow.

In a tavern, many cultivators gathered for drinks and laughs.

“What is wrong with this weather? Ever since I entered this city, the snow has not stopped!” a burly man with a battle sabre complained as he watched the snow fall from the comfort of the tavern.

“Haha, you must be new,” a purple-haired elder looked over and said, “Stay a while longer and you’ll get used to it.”

“Get used to it?” the burly man was confused and asked, “Brother, what do you mean? It’s early summer now, how can it be snowing for days?”

“Days? Haha, wrong. The snow has been falling for years,” the purple-haired elder replied.

“Years? You’re kidding, right?” the burly man was shocked.

“I’m not. I’ve been here for the longest time, the snow has been falling for about ten years. Nine years and nine months, to be specific, and it has never stopped,” the purple-haired elder said.

“How is that possible?” the burly man was amazed. “Perhaps there is an elite expert behind the snow? Artificial snow?”

To him, that was the only logical explanation.

No snow could possibly go on for nine years and nine months naturally.

“Haha, I knew you would think that way. But I can assure you that the snow is natural. Sure, it’s weird, but there’s a reason behind it,” the purple-haired elder laughed heartily.

“Reason? What reason?” the burly man asked continuously.

The other cultivators gathered as well. They knew that the snow had lasted for nine years and nine months, but no one knew why, and they all wanted to know.

“The reason...” the purple-haired elder was baiting them.

The burly man took out two bottles of good wine from his Qian Kun Ring and placed it in front of him. “Brother, tell us.”

The purple-haired elder smiled at the sight of wine. “It’s a rumour around the city. I cannot confirm the legitimacy of it either.”

He continued, “Apparently, when our Incineration Moon Governor Zhuo Yunfeng’s wife had her third child nine years ago, the snow started and has never stopped since.”

The burly man frowned and said, “Brother, this is obviously fake. How can someone being pregnant have anything to do with the snow? It is simply a coincidence.”

The other cultivators felt similarily.

But the purple-haired elder smiled, “What if the child has yet to be born till now?”

“What?”

That unsettled everyone.

Pregnant for nine years, till now?

It couldn’t be.

“That’s the rumour. Ever since Zhuo Yunfeng’s wife Luo Xinqin fell pregnant, the snow has fallen. Nine years and nine months have passed, and yet the child is still unborn. No coincidence there.” The purple-haired elder smiled.

The burly man and the other cultivators in the tavern nodded in agreement.

It was indeed weird.

The snow was weird.

The unborn child was weirder.

It could not be a coincidence for both to happen concurrently.

“People are saying its a demon. Its been long rumoured in the Incineration Moon City that Luo Xinqin is pregnant with the devil, a monster,” the purple-haired elder added.

The others agreed.

An unborn creature for nine years and nine months had to be a monster.

But at the Absolute Beginning Divine World, where power triumphed over all, a monster could be a good thing instead.

After all, monsters would have their advantages, and many sects in the Absolute Beginning Divine World would undoubtedly want one under their wing.

Governor Zhuo Yunfeng had a good reputation in the city as well. Even though people were talking about Luo Xinqin and her child, no one pointed it out and had no contempt or disgust for it.

The burly man felt content after paying two bottles of fine wine for an interesting story. After some ruckus, the crowd dispersed.

Incineration Moon City, within the Governor’s palace.

Governor Zhuo Yunfeng was a man of his word, and a very fair man as well. He was deeply respected within the city.

In the conference hall of his huge manor, a silver-robed, powerful middle-aged man with a little stubble was discussing issues with a guard commander under him. He was Zhuo Yunfeng.

A maid hurried in.

“Sir, sir.”

The maid shouted for him as she ran in.

Zhuo Yunfeng frowned and asked, “What is the rush?”

The maid saw the guard commander and realised that Zhuo Yunfeng was discussing business and so she apologised.

“Speak, what is it?” Zhuo Yunfeng asked calmly.

“Sir, Ma’am is about to give birth,” the maid replied.

“What?”

Zhuo Yunfeng flinched, then rushed over towards Luo Xinqin’s room excitedly, disregarding the guard commander.
