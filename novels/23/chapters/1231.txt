“This, this is…”

Everyone present widened their eyes and looked at the sky above in horror.

They were looking at the huge World Scroll.

This world had mountains and waters and beautiful sceneries.

The most striking thing was the nine continents that spread over nine different places, all of which looked real.

A horrific and tremulous power spread, the Jin Kingdom monarch shouted. “Divine Treasure! This is a Chaos Divine Treasure!”

The Jin Kingdom monarch also looked unprecedentedly shocked.

Even in the Eternal Chaotic World, only super experts could have one of them.

At his level, under normal circumstances, he could only see one or two of the Chaos Magic Treasures.

Now, the World Scroll appeared above him was obviously the power of a Chaos Divine Treasure.

“Humph, so what if it’s a Chaos Divine Treasure?” It’s just someone in the Eternal Realm, even if he has a Chaos Divine Treasure, he can’t display its full power. I’m afraid he can’t depend on it to destroy the Enduring Samsara Formation!” Jiu Xi shouted coolly.

Indeed, a Chaos Divine Treasure was indeed strong, but the owner must be capable enough to play its full power.

If one could not play the full power, it would still be as useless as eye candy.

And just as everyone was in shock, Xuan Yi, who floated in the Void above the Battle Fortress, smiled slightly. Then, with a flick of the wrist, he threw a strange bead that was as dark as ink.

This bead seemed mysterious, and all the people present, including the experienced Gu King, failed to recognize it.

Then, the black bead immediately merged into the World Scroll.

Immediately, the scroll changed!

Boom…

The huge World Scroll let out a sudden roar.

In the four directions of the World Scroll, there were four spiraling huge vortexes. After the vortexes stabilized, the energy within them formed four giant hands. Then, the hands stretched from within the vortexes toward the Enduring Samsara Formation lightning fast.

“This is?” Jian Wushuang looked at it all in amazement.

He has already claimed ownership of the Mountain River Map and was familiar with the ability of the Mountain River Map.

As far as he knew, the most terrifying thing in the Mountain River Map was the Nine-province Seal formed by the nine continents.

But what Xuan Yi displayed was not something that belonged to the Mountain River Map. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Jian Wushuang thought it might have something to do with the bead Xuan Yi threw out.

Four giants hands suddenly came to the core of the black and white vortex, and seized the four most important positions of it.

These four positions were exactly where Jian Wushuang, Sunrise Sword Emperor, and Jian Nnantian stood when they set the Quadruple Supreme Sword Formation.

This was where the core of the Enduring Samsara Formation laid, but now it was caught by the four giant hands.

“Damn!”

The glamorous woman, Jiu Xi’s expression changed dramatically.

When she saw Xuan Yi take out the Chaos Divine Treasure, she did not pay much attention. But now the four giants had grasped the four most important parts of the Formation, she became anxious.

“Master Jin Feng, quickly, destroy these four hands!” Jiu Xi shouted repeatedly.

“Alright.”

The Jin Kingdom monarch that hid at the core of the black and white vortex immediately nodded.

He also realized that these four giants were really something. If he allowed them to continue, this Formation would be in jeopardy.

“Kill!”

He shouted coldly, and terrifying power gathered on the spear. Immediately, the spear turned into an lightning and directly slammed against the giant hand closest to him.

Bam!

With a bang, majestic power suddenly broke out and formed a Blast Wave, ruthlessly sweeping in all directions.

The whole world even seemed trivial in front of this strong power.

However, when the bang died own, the black giant hands still firmly clung to the Void. Their sizes and power stayed the same as before.

“How can it be?” Tthe Jin Kingdom monarch was shocked.

When he struck, he already went all out, but why did he still fail to destroy the black giant hands, or even not weaken them in the least?

“I won’t accept it!”

The Jin Kingdom monarch looked cold. His golden robe fluttered in the wind, and his eyes flashed with intense lights.

Then, swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

Three consecutive lights struck the black giant hand in the same spot.

Bam! Bam! Bam!

After three loud noises had died down, the black giant hand was still intact.

“What…”

He was stunned. He did his best and still failed to destroy this black giant hand?

Then, he immediately understood that he could not stop the four giant hands.

When the four black giants seized the four Voids, bam! Roars sounded one after another. The Heavens and Earth were shaking, and the four dark giant hands burst out terrifying power to try to move the Enduring Samsara Formation!

“Gosh!”

“Isn’t that crazy!”

In the Battle Fortress, countless Green Fire World experts who had witnessed this scene all looked shocked.

The Enduring Samsara Formation had been expanding and developing for a year, it had exceeded tens of millions large.

It was a huge thing, but now Xuan Yi actually tried to move this big Formation.

“Master, what is he going to do?” Jian Wushuang was in shock.

Gu King inside his body stared and exclaimed. “Jian Wushuang, your master isn’t breaking it!”

“What?” Jian Wushuang was shocked. “He isn’t? Then what’s he doing?”

“He, he tries to refine it. He wants to refine the Enduring Samsara Formation!” Gu King sounded shocked.

Jian Wushuang widened his eyes.

Refining the Formation?

Refine the Enduring Samsara Formation that had already filled tens of millions of miles?

“This, how is this possible?” Jian Wushuang was completely shocked.

Not only him, Palace Master Yun who discerned Xuan Yi’s intent also froze.

“He didn’t break the Formation, but chose to refine it straight? How can he do this? This is simply crazy!” Palace Master Yun was roaring madly in his heart.

At the core of the black and white vortex, Jiu Xi looked completely in disbelief.

“To destroy it by refining it?”

“How does an Eternal Realm try to refine my Enduring Samsara Formation?”

“Where does this crazy come from?”

Jiu Xi and Palace Master Yun were both confident of the Formation.

However, Xuan Yi’s method of breaking the Formation was completely beyond their imagination, even beyond their understanding of the Formation.
