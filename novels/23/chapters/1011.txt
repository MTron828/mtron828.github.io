In a grand hall, many experts of the Black Python Clan gathered together. Everyone looked quite excited.

“We’ve finally come to this day after preparing for so long.”

The leader of the Black Python Clan was an insidious man with a little black snake coiling on his shoulder. He looked around with ice-cold eyes like vipers and said, “we are going to do it today, follow everything by the plan. This time, we must make them pay a heavy price and leave them to go to the dogs!”

“Yes.” One after another, the experts of the Black Python Clan around him nodded excitedly.

After fighting against each other for so many years in this territory, the enmity between the Black Python Clan and the Rock Demon Clan had long gone into a situation in which they would fight to the death.

The two populations would trample the other side underfoot downright without hesitation given a chance.

And this time, for the Black Python Clan, it was definitely a now-or-never chance.

“Master Di Yan, later when God Hong shows up, I will have to bother you to deal with him.” The insidious man looked towards a black-robed elder sitting next to him and said with a hint of modesty.

On hearing this, the black-robed elder raised his head slightly and unfolded his skinny old face. Black mysterious cracks could be seen all over one of his cheeks.

If Jian Wushuang was there, would have recognized him at a glance. The black-robed elder was Di Yan, the expert from the Sky-devouring Clan who worked with Jin Yu to ambush Dragon Wing Governor and him outside of Jin Yu’s castle back then.

Di Yan came from the bloodline of the Sky-devouring Clan and liked to devour the essence blood of all kinds of exotic beasts. He once had his eye on Dragon Wing Governor. However, he had to give up because Jian Wushuang got in his way. After that, he traveled along and happened to come to this territory as well. Then he accepted the invitation from the experts of the Black Python Clan and came to help them defeat the Rock Demon Clan.

“The Rock Demon Clan has been known for powerful body defensive ability. God Hong had awakened a part of the bloodline and reached the level of Rank Three Dao Master. Even I am not totally sure that I could kill him for good, but I could manage to wound him badly.” The black-robed elder Di Yan said.

“It will be enough as long as you can inflict serious injuries on him and hold down his battle strength for a short while. If the plan works, the overall strength of the Rock Demon Clan will be severely cut down, and God Hong will also be unable to use his strength. Then our Black Python Clan could unite the experts to wipe out the whole Rock Demon Clan!” The insidious man said in a low voice.

“In this way, the Black Python Clan should be the only advanced population over the territory ever after.” Di Yan laughed and said.

“Haha, I still have to bother you to help us achieve that, Master Di Yan.” The insidious man laughed along and said.

Soon the experts of the Black Python set off.

In the rift of the territory of the Rock Demon Clan.

Buzz, buzz… The whole rift was full of Sword Essence. Yet Jian Wushuang, who was in the very center of Sword Essence, stopped and slowly put back his sword.

“After digging for so many years, I finally completed this move.” Jian Wushuang said with a delightful face.

“Jian Wushuang, the talent you have got on Sword Principle is undoubtedly marvelous. You can create such a weird swordsmanship. ” Gu King spoke to his mind. “Your Sword Principles are just at the common level, but the move you created is tremendous. Even those experts who have created Sword Principle at the Universe Level won’t necessarily be capable of working it out.”

“I have to thank Sunrise Sword Emperor for leaving these nine sword scars. Besides, I am also grateful to Master Ku, who guided me at the beginning.” Jian Wushuang laughed and said.

After Jian Wushuang created the second Sword Principle of his own named Swordplay of Aurora, he spent eight years digging into swordsmanship. By now, he had finally made a great achievement on swordsmanship and fulfilled his goal.

“While this Original Body of mine was indulged in the study of swordsmanship, the other one has been meditating on the connotation of the strongest Sword Principle. Thus I have come to some understandings in which I feel that I am quite close to creating my third Sword Principle.” Jian Wushuang smiled and said.

People would surely be deeply shocked if they were told about someone who had created two Sword Principles successively in just a few decades and was about to create the third one. After all, Sword Principles were unimaginably profound. There was no way they could be created at will.

But Jian Wushuang was different.

He got a great gift in Sword Principle along with many treasures and opportunities that facilitated him. Most important of all, he had the strongest sword heart!

The rule that the strongest sword heart must be metamorphosized from the Strongest Sword Soul played an essential role in the meditation on Sword Principles.

In comparison to other warriors of Sword Principles, Jian Wushuang got a much greater innate advantage!

Even Gu King said that Jian Wushuang should at least create one of the strongest Sword Principles before he became a Dao Master.

Yet how many cultivators of Sword Principle would dare to set their goal to achieve the strongest Sword Principle in the whole Green Fire World?

But for Jian Wushuan who had the strongest sword heart, achieving the strongest Sword Principle was merely a starting point.

Jian Wushuang was murmuring, but suddenly… Boom!

A dreadful roar came down from the distant void with a rush, carrying a horrible aftermath that spread to the whole Rock Demon Clan.

“Ha ha!!!”

“From today on, the Rock Demon Clan will no longer exist on the Samsara Continent!”

A loud and cold laughter came through the air like a heavy thunder, echoing in the entire residence of the Rock Demon Clan.

In an instant, the whole Rock Demon Clan was startled.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Numerous experts of the Rock Demon Clan rushed towards the residence of the Rock Demon Clan with astonishment and anger on their face.

“What happened…?”

Jian Wushuang glided to the void above the rift. Overlooking to the distant void, he could see the edge of his vision where several grand auras were approaching slowly. There were eight auras in total, and all of them belonged to the real experts at Dao Master level.

And most importantly, the eight Dao Masters all came with tremendous killing intent. Apparently, they were not from the Rock Demon Clan.

“What happened?” Jian Wushuang said doubtfully.

“Master Wushuang, Master Wushuang.” As there came an anxious voice, Qing Bin glided to Jian Wushuang hurriedly.

“Qing Bin, what happened? Why would there be some people directly intruding the residence of the Rock Demon Clan?” Jian Wushuang frowned and asked.

With ten Dao Masters, led by God Hong who was a Rank Three Dao Master, the Rock Demon Clan was someway an advanced population. Within this territory, no one dared to mess with them except for the Black Python Clan.

Although the strength of the Black Python Clan was slightly greater and the fight between the two populations was a bit crazy, the Black Python Clan wouldn’t dare to assault the city of the Rock Demon Clan if there was no specific treasure that they coveted so much.

“Something happened. Something serious happened.”

Qing Bin growled in a low voice, and his eyes turned red. He said, “The Black Python Clan set us up. A medium population was bribed by them and joined their conspiracy. Four elders of us who went out for business all fell today.”
