Chapter 2967: Destruction Beast God Statue

——

“Among the endless creatures, there are all kinds of bloodlines and races!”

“In the absolute Beginning Divine Realm, the four divine races are the most famous. They can be called the four most powerful races with very strong bloodlines. However, although the bloodlines of the four divine races are strong, they are still made up of a great race. In the absolute Beginning Divine Realm, the special life forms have the highest bloodlines or life levels,” Lord Tianshuo said.

Jian Wushuang’s heart skipped a beat.

It was not the first time he had heard of a special life form.

“What is special about a special life form?

“It is unique between heaven and earth. Their innate talent can not be matched by ordinary bloodlines. Even the most ordinary special life form can be dozens or even hundreds of times stronger than human cultivators if they are in the same realm as humans!”

“And among these unique creatures, there are some famous ones. Among them is the Destruction Beast God!”

“This Destruction Beast God was born very early in the absolute Beginning Divine Realm. It has already fallen. Although it has fallen, no one dares to forget how terrifying it is.”

“The Destruction Beast God was born for destruction. It is a favored child of the law of destruction. Since it was born, it had an extremely high level of understanding of the law of destruction. Moreover, this kind of understanding makes it so that it doesn’t need to cultivate. As it grows, it will naturally improve.”

“The Destruction Beast God can completely comprehend the destruction rules as soon as it reaches adulthood and become the master of the destruction rules,” Sir Tianshuo said.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He could completely comprehend a complete destruction rule as soon as he reached adulthood and become the Master of the destruction rules?

This talent…

“No wonder it can be called the Master of the destruction rules,” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

After all, he was a perfect chaotic creature, and his life level was far above that of many special creatures.

However, even he did not have the ability to become a rule master when he reached adulthood. He also needed to cultivate and improve himself slowly.

The natural talent of the Destruction Beast God was simply terrifying.

“Many years ago, the Destruction Beast God roamed the Divine Beginning World with astonishing combat strength and left a great reputation. However, because it was too talented in the destruction rules, some experts refined treasures based on its divine body and even left behind its corpse, scales, and bones. These treasures all contained the destruction rules.”

“At the same time, there are people who refine special treasures to comprehend the destruction rules, such as stone tablets and statues, which are imitated from the divine body of the Destruction Beast God. However, they can only imitate its actions, but not its god. The statue you are taking out is imitated by the Destruction Beast God. The charm contained in it is probably less than one-thousandth of that of the Destruction Beast God at its peak,” Sir Tianshuo said.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood and frowned. “It’s only one-thousandth of its charm, but it still contains such a strong power of destruction rules?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Of course it’s strong.” Lord Tianshuo smiled faintly, “The Destruction Beast God, at its peak, is on par with the top super existences in the Divine Beginning World. It can be said to be one of the strongest people in the Divine Beginning World. Even if it’s only one-thousandth of its charm, it’s enough for many powerful Immortal Saints to study it for a long time.”

“The statue in your hand is definitely a once-in-a-lifetime treasure for cultivators who have comprehended the destruction rules. The Earth Divine Fruit is much more useful for cultivators who have comprehended the earth rules, so its value is naturally more shocking.”

Jian Wushuang was delighted.

He knew that the black beast statue was extraordinary. Now it seemed that it was indeed so.

“I didn’t expect that the black beast statue would be the most precious of the three special treasures from the secret realm,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, the Destruction Beast God statue should be of little use to you. You can choose to sell it to me. As for its value, I can give you 500 million sacred elixirs with your authority as an earth-level member. How about that?” Lord Tianshou looked over.

“500 million!” Jian Wushuang’s heart skipped a beat.

The Divine Earth Fruit had only sold for 100 million sacred elixirs, and in the end, it was split equally between him and Xue Dong King.

However, the Destruction Beast God statue could sell for 500 million sacred elixirs!

He owned 500 million sacred elixirs alone.

“There’s no rush for this statue.” Jian Wushuang shook his head. “I’m still weak, and I’ve already obtained most of the resources I need. I won’t exchange for this statue for the time being. When I need to exchange for sacred elixirs, it’s not too late for me to do so.”

“In that case, I won’t force you. Go.” Lord Tianshou waved his hand.

Jian Wushuang bowed respectfully to Lord Tianshou, then turned and left.

After coming out of the secret nest, Jian Wushuang was still quite excited.

“With the Destruction beast God statue worth 500 million sacred elixirs, I have a huge amount of money in my hands. I must use this money in the most reasonable way to maximize its value.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, “There’s no rush. I just reached the realm of Peak Great Divine Master not long ago, and now I have the four-layered sword formation of the Samsara Sword Formation. Let’s see the power of the four-layered sword formation first.”

Jian Wushuang immediately found a hidden void.

Jian Wushuang temporarily opened a cave mansion in the void, and then he began to comprehend the fifth-layered samsara sword formation.

The first level of the Samsara Sword Formation was called the horn of heaven, the second level of world sink, the third level of Samsara drunk, and the fourth level of ice and snow world!

The fifth level of the sword formation was called…saint slaying!

Jian Wushuang did not know why Sword Master Tongxin named the fifth level of the sword formation. However, one thing was that the power of the fifth level of the sword formation was much stronger than the fourth level of the sword formation. It was a completely different concept, the difference between heaven and earth.

Of course, the power of the fifth sword formation was so strong that it was naturally more complicated and difficult to comprehend. Most importantly, it had a higher requirement for the comprehension of the Samsara rule.

After Jian Wushuang comprehended it, he soon learned that if he wanted to truly use the fifth sword formation, his comprehension of the Samsara rule had to be at least at the True Saint-level!

A True Saint was not an ordinary False Saint.

Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of the space-time rule and the reincarnation rule was only at the False Saint level. He had just reached the true saint level, but there was still a big gap between him and a True Saint.
