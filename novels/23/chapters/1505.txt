Chapter 1506: Soft Persimmon

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the void, as the breeze howled, the air seemed to freeze.

Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold as he fixed his eyes upon Universe God Xiong Fu.

“In Wu Bei’s cave, many Universe Gods were fighting one another madly for White Blaze Fruits. The one who was killed in the fight could only blame himself for being weak. He can’t blame anyone else.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold, “Universe God Xiong Fu, if Long Ya were to seize the White Blaze Fruit and be unwilling to give it to you, I could understand if you were to kill him. However, Long Ya gave you the White Blaze Fruit, but you’re still coming after him to kill him. Isn’t this a little ridiculous?”

“Ridiculous?” Universe God Xiong Fu lifted the corners of his lips and smiled, “In this world, there’s no right and wrong. There’s only strong and weak. As I am stronger than him, so what if I am being ridiculous? Jian Wushuang, you should be glad that your ranking on the Universe God ranking list isn’t low. I am not confident that I can kill you. Otherwise, not only Long Ya, but also you, with a White Blaze Fruit, will have to die here today.”

Universe God Xiong Fu knew Jian Wushuang had a White Blaze Fruit too.

However, Jian Wushuang wasn’t weak. Although he was at the ninth place on Universe God ranking list, it was not definite if he could kill Jian Wushuang.

“If so, I am really lucky,” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly and his gaze turned cold too, “But, I’d really like to know just how amazing the ninth place on Universe God ranking list is.”

“Why? Want to try?” Universe God Xiong Fu smirked and looked at Jian Wushuang in disdain.

He wasn’t sure if he could kill Jian Wushuang, but in terms of power, he didn’t see Jian Wushuang as his match. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After all, between the top ten and the top twenty on Universe God ranking list, there was a vast difference.

Just as the two of them were going to launch an attack, there was a huge crowd that appeared in the void before them.

Those people were the Universe Gods who were fighting over the White Blaze Fruit with Long Ya earlier. But as their speed wasn’t fast enough, they only caught up then. Including the Universe Gods who were attracted by the chase, there was a total of almost a hundred people.

With almost a hundred Universe Gods, although there weren’t any experts on the Universe God ranking list, if they were to join forces, it would still be a rather fierce fighting force.

“Universe God Xiong Fu and Jian Wushuang?”

The Universe Gods who caught up looked at the two of them in astonishment. Especially when they saw Jian Wushuang, the Universe Gods looked shocked.

Jian Wushuang was holding a White Blaze Fruit.

Then they noticed Long Ya, who was extremely weak, standing behind Jian Wushuang.

“Long Ya, pass us the White Blaze Fruit!”

“Pass us the White Blaze Fruit. Otherwise, you have to die!”

Continuous roars were heard one after another. The Universe Gods locked gazes on Long Ya.

Long Ya clenched his teeth and roared, “The White Blaze Fruit that I’ve gotten is in Universe God Xiong Fu’s hands.”

“Huh?”

The Universe Gods looked at Universe God Xiong Fu again.

“He’s right. I do have a White Blaze Fruit in my hand,” Universe God Xiong Fu smiled maliciously, “However, I’m not the only one with a White Blaze Fruit on hand. Jian Wushuang has one too. So, you’d better think it through if you want the White Blaze Fruit in my hand or the one in Jian Wushuang’s hand. Or maybe, you can figure out a way to make the both of us stay back.”

Universe God Xiong Fu obviously sounded bold in his speech.

The surrounding hundred Universe Gods immediately drowned in deep thoughts.

One on one, they definitely weren’t Jian Wushuang or Universe God Xiong Fu’s match. They definitely had to join forces. Even if they were to join forces… A hundred Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven joining forces, although their fighting power would be fierce, it would be unrealistic to make both Jian Wushuang and Universe God Xiong Fu stay.

Hence, they could only choose one.

Universe God Xiong Fu and Jian Wushuang, one was ninth on the Universe God ranking list and the latter one on the twentieth. Even an idiot would know how to choose.

“Jian Wushuang, give us the White Blaze Fruit,” an elderly in a red robe who obviously had a stronger aura compared to the other Universe Gods roared.

The other Universe Gods looked over at Jian Wushuang at the same time and their gazes were cold.

On the other hand, Universe God Xiong Fu looked at the sight with interest but didn’t intend to get involved.

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes slightly.

“It seems that they are treating me like a soft persimmon,” Jian Wushuang muttered, “Well, Universe God Xiong Fu is in the ninth place on Universe God ranking list which is a higher rank than mine. Under normal circumstances, his power should definitely be stronger than mine.”

“Jian Wushuang, give us the White Blaze Fruit and we will let you leave with Long Ya. Otherwise, both you and Long Ya have to die here!” The elderly in red robe continued.

“With all of you?” Jian Wushuang stole a glance at the elderly in red robe.

“You’re courting death!” The elderly in red robe was raging with anger. He bellowed, “Go, kill him!”

“Kill!”

The surrounding hundred Universe Gods instantly erupted with a terrifying murderous intention and the figures plunged forward simultaneously.

Normally, if only a few of them ran into Jian Wushuang alone, they definitely wouldn’t dare to make a plan on Jian Wushuang’s White Blaze Fruit.

But then, they weren’t afraid.

After all, there were almost a hundred of Universe Gods and they were all Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven. Although there weren’t any experts on Universe God ranking list, with them joining forces, even Universe God Xiong Fu who was on the ninth place on Universe God ranking list could only avoid them, let alone Jian Wushuang.

“Die!” These Universe Gods were soaring with murderous intention.

But then, Jian Wushuang’s face was extremely cold.

“I do not want to carry out a massacre. But this time, you are the one courting death,” Jian Wushuang gave a chilly glare and a boundless Soul Power swept out instantly.

The bolt of Soul Power turned into a crimson phoenix in the void directly.

The crimson phoenix flapped its wings then it turned into flowing lights and rained. As the crimson phoenix’s feather turned into crimson flowing lights, they immersed into the almost hundred of Universe Gods’ bodies without hindrance. Then, they pierced through the Universe Gods’ sea of consciousness like sharp thorns.

Almost a hundred Universe Gods were soaring with murderous intention earlier, but then, more than half of them revealed a terrified expression. Then, their gazes grew dim.

Hualala.

Just like rain, out of almost a hundred of Universe Gods, sixty of them fell to the ground straight away.

There was over thirty remaining Universe Gods. Although they forcefully endured the Soul Attack, they could feel the piercing pain from their consciousnesses.

Then, Blood Mountain Sword already appeared in Jian Wushuang’s hand.

Looking at the remaining thirty Universe Gods before him that were still in astonishment, there was a flash of murderous intention in Jian Wushuang’s eyes as his figure suddenly became illusionary.
