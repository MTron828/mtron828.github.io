Chapter 2406: Coerce

“Zhong Yi, you’re laughing now but you won’t be able to soon.” Tang Xiao stared closely at Zhong Yi.

“What, you’re here looking for trouble with just you and your people from Black Thunder Pavilion?” Zhong Yi’s eyes turned frosty.

“Haha, that surely wouldn’t be enough, but do you think we’re the only ones who have beef with you?” Tang Xiao burst out laughing.

Just as his voice faded, there were a few dark figures appearing in the void not far away and arrived in front of everyone in a blink of an eye.

There were five of them and the group leader was a bald man with a violent aura.

“You are Yu Shi of Cold Blood Palace?” Zhong Yi’s expression changed.

“Zhong Yi, Su Tong, I’ve long been hearing your names. We finally met.” The bald man Na Shiyu cracked open his mouth and smiled—it was a cold smile.

“Na Shiyu, what does Cold Blood Palace want? Do you want to become enemies with Narcissus Island?” said Zhong Yi coldly.

Back where Tang Xiao was from, Black Thunder Pavilion had a general strength that was not far behind Narcissus Island. Zhong Yi could not use Narcissus Island to coerce him.

However, Cold Blood Palace was far from comparable to Narcissus Island which was evident through the fact that there were only five of their disciples who got into Saint’s Tomb. [1]

Once Zhong Yi saw the arrival of five Cold Blood Palace disciples, he mentioned Narcissus Island’s name at the very first moment.

“Becoming enemies with Narcissus Island? This is nothing but competition between the disciples. We have no intention of antagonizing Narcissus Island. Besides, the last time Saint’s Tomb was open, we had a few disciples who died in Narcissus Island disciples’ hands and it was due to a fair fight, thus we didn’t say anything. Now that we just arrived, you’re already accusing us of antagonizing Narcissus Island?” Na Shiyu gave Zhong Yi an insulting look.

“Na Shiyu, don’t waste your breath talking to him. Let’s do it,” said Tang Xiao right after.

“Alright then.” Na Shiyu nodded.

The disciples from both sects immediately activated their attack.

“Oh no!”

All of Narcissus Island’s disciples looked troubled.

They could handle the attacks if they were only facing Black Thunder Pavilion, but now that there was also Cold Blood Palace...

It was important to remember that there were ten disciples from Black Thunder Pavilion. If the five disciples from Cold Blood Palace were added on, there were a total of fifteen opponents with the weakest ones all being Second-Class Divine Demons and a total of three First-Class Divine Demons with two First-Class Divine Demons from Black Thunder Pavilion and Na Shiyu which was one more than Narcissus Island.

That caused a huge total strength gap between Narcissus Island and its opponents.

If they fought...

“Careful!”

“Block them!”

All disciples from Narcissus Island began to take action, establishing the battle against Black Thunder Pavilion and Cold Blood Palace within moments.

An intense fight had immediately broken out.

Zhong Yi unsheathed his battle blade while Su Tong also joined in with her spear and both their faces looked grim.

“This is the outer area, there is no obvious fight for opportunities. The men from Black Thunder Pavilion and Cold Blood Palace wouldn’t dare to kill!” said Zhong Yi.

Su Tong nodded. “True. However, they could still heavily injure us even if they don’t dare to kill us, making us lose our battle strength in the short time, so that we can’t fight for the final six positions.”

“Let’s all be careful and try not to get hurt. I’ve sent a message to the Second Elder, requesting her to look for people from Black Thunder Pavilion and Cold Blood Palace!” Zhong Yi announced.

“Haha. Zhong Yi, you better worry about yourself for now!”

With a hearty laugh, Tang Xiao had already appeared before Zhong Yi with Na Shiyu next to him.

“Na Shiyu, we’ll work together. Let’s teach Zhong Yi a good lesson today,” said Tang Xiao.

“No problem.” Na Shiyu smiled.

Both of them simultaneously attacked, dashing at Zhong Yi like flashes of lightning.

Two against one!

Su Tong was also entangled in a fight with another First-Class Divine Demon from Black Thunder Pavilion.

When it came to abilities, Zhong Yi was the strongest individual amongst everyone in the battle. If it was a one on one fight, neither Tang Xiao or Na Shiyu could have the upper hand, though the difference was small.

When it came to two against one, he was totally overpowered.

“Tang Xiao, what are you two exactly up to?”

Flames of rage were burning in Zhong Yi’s eyes as he was crazily swinging his battle blade, already releasing his strongest battle strength. Even so, he could merely block their attacks and gradually lose his stand.

“Haha, what do we want to do? You still don’t know? How did you treat me more than ten years ago? I want to pay you back in full!” Tang Xiao laughed hard, but his eyes were extremely cold.

“Funny, do you think I would be worried about you if we fought one on one?” Zhong Yi growled deeply and immediately looked over at Na Shiyu. “Na Shiyu, what would make Cold Blood Palace willing to retreat?”

“It’s easy if you want me to retreat. Give me thirty Purple Amulets and we will leave right away,” said Na Shiyu.

Zhong Yi was shocked, hearing those words.

Purple Amulets were the most commonly seen items in Saint’s Tomb, almost every genius disciple could find a few if they made a detailed search in the outer area.

Narcissus Island disciples had gained quite a harvest in the passing five days.

However, there were only less than a total of forty Purple Amulets pieces among the ten Narcissus Island disciples and Na Shiyu was asking for thirty of them?

That was a robbery!

“Na Shiyu, you’re asking for too much!” shouted Zhong Yi.

“Too much?” Na Shiyu’s face turned cold. “Looks like you haven’t yet understood the situation. Tang Xiao, let’s go in harder!”

“Sure.” Tang Xiao was very excited.

Both of them carried out a frenzied offense and Zhong Yi was being pressured to the point that he lost all his temper. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Not only Zhong Yi, but the rest of Narcissus Island’s disciples were also completely on the passive side in the battles.

They were all Second-Class Divine Demons, but Narcissus Island was clearly outnumbered.

On the battlefield, Jian Wushuang had also taken action.

The one fighting against Jian Wushuang was a strong blonde man. He was incredibly vicious at waving his weighty and powerful giant axe.

However, he noticed that Jian Wushuang was merely at Chaotic Realm, hence he did not dare to unleash his full strength as he worried that he might kill him by accident. If someone from Narcissus Island died, the nature of their battle would completely alter.

As long as the opponent did not get killed, it was not a problem to injure or cripple him.

“Boy, you have some guts coming to Saint’s Tomb as a mere Chaotic Realm fighter. Are you seeking death? See how I teach you a lesson.” The strong blonde man viciously grinned and swung his axe directly at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang had a long sword in his hand, but not the Blood Mountain Sword. It was only a regular sword.

Facing the incoming axe, he raised his sword to block and easily ward off the attacks.
