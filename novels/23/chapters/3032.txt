Chapter 3033: Return to the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow

——

“Take it.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

He had a certain friendship with Xue Dong King, but it was not very deep.

But this time…when he sent a message to Xue Dong King asking him to send him some god-burning poison, he told him in detail about his situation, including the fact that the surrounding area was completely sealed and he was only allowed to enter and not leave, in the end, Xue Dong King did not hesitate at all and directly agreed. This made Jian Wushuang feel very touched and grateful.

A friend like Xue Dong King was worth making a deep friendship with. Therefore, Jian Wushuang was not stingy and directly took out 100 million sacred elixirs. The extra 60 million sacred elixirs were his gratitude to Xue Dong King for taking the risk for him.

Looking at the interspatial ring in his hand, Xue Dong King did not hesitate and said, “Okay, I’ll take it.”

Xue Dong King had seen Jian Wushuang slaughter many experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom. Many True Saint experts had died at Jian Wushuang’s hands, and those True Saint experts were all rich. Therefore, Jian Wushuang had gained a lot of wealth, in addition to the reward for this mission, it could be said that he had made a lot of money, so he was not too unreasonable.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, what are your plans next?” Xue Dong King looked at Jian Wushuang.

“I still have some private matters to deal with,” Jian Wushuang said.

“In that case, let’s split up again. I’ll go to the Barbarian King Team. Brother Heavenly Marquis, if you have any problems in the future, like this time, you can look for me at any time,” Xue Dong King said.

“Okay.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Soon, they separated.

Jian Wushuang was already planning his next move.

“I’ve already reached the Immortal Saint realm, and I’ve just reached the rank one True Saint Realm. Logically speaking, my strength is still rising. As long as I have the opportunity, my strength can be greatly improved in a short time.”

“Opportunity…”

“In the secret realm, I promised the spirit of the secret realm that when I reached the Immortal Saint Realm, I would go to the secret realm again to accept the test left by the master of the secret realm. Now that my realm has reached, I should fulfill my promise,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a glimmer of light, but he had an idea in his heart. Then, he directly set off.

The endless territory was vast and boundless.

The Magic Note Divine Kingdom occupied a total of 36 territories, which was already an extremely large Divine Kingdom. However, compared to the entire endless territory, it was only a drop in the ocean. The Magic Note Divine Kingdom was also very far away from the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow.

Fortunately, Jian Wushuang was now a member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, and he was also a heaven-level member. His authority was not small, and the secret nests of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance were scattered all over the Divine Beginning World, there was also a secret lair of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance around the territory of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow.

Through the spatial passage, Jian Wushuang appeared directly in the secret lair of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance around the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow.

After that, Jian Wushuang spent some sacred elixirs and obtained an intelligence report.

This intelligence report was about the changes that had occurred in the years since Jian Wushuang left the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow.

It had been nearly 300 years since Jian Wushuang left the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow.

These 300 years were a long time for Jian Wushuang in this life.

In the vast void.

Jian Wushuang flew while carefully reading the piece of information in his hand. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“As expected, after I left, a large number of mysterious experts arrived, including many principles masters.”

Looking at the information in his hand, Jian Wushuang secretly praised.

In order to get Leng Rushuang back from the Supreme Emotion Valley, he had used his last trump card, the life-level pressure, and even used the heaven-cleaving skill to kill several disciples of the Supreme Emotion Valley at the True Saint level.

However, because of this, he was targeted by the power of the will of heaven. If not for Daoist Xuan Shen’s help in secret and the teleportation token he had obtained from the secret realm, he would not have been able to escape that day.

After he left, a large number of top experts from the third heaven arrived.

According to the information provided by the Heaven-slaying Alliance, there were many experts who had arrived. They searched wantonly and almost turned the entire Nine Realms of the golden crow upside down, especially the places that Jian Wushuang had been to and the Pill Sun Sacred World where he was born, they searched the entire place several times.

Moreover, anyone who had a certain connection with Jian Wushuang had been interrogated, but in the end, they still could not find any trace of Jian Wushuang.

Not only the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow but also a large number of surrounding territories had also been searched by those experts.

However, after searching for more than a hundred years without any news, those experts still left.

By now, the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow had calmed down again.

“Humph, although the information from the Heaven-cleaving Alliance says that all the experts have left, I’m afraid that it’s not absolute. If I’m not wrong, although the experts have left on the surface, I’m afraid that there will still be a few experts left in the dark. However, they won’t be searching as recklessly as before. Instead, they will go into hiding and wait for me to appear,” Jian Wushuang said with a cold snort.

He knew very well how terrifying his enemies were

The three Great Saint Realm experts, the four great divine clans, and the eight directions celestial sect — how terrifying were any of them?

Any one of them was enough to shake the entire Divine Beginning Realm.

Such a super force had countless experts under their command, and their desire to kill him was even more intense.

Even though they had searched for hundreds of years without finding any trace of him, these forces would never give up. They would definitely be willing to let some experts stay here and wait for tens of thousands of years, they would be willing to wait for hundreds of thousands of years.

After all, these super forces should not lack experts.

As for the will of the Heavenly Dao..

Jian Wushuang could not help looking up.

Although the world seemed calm, Jian Wushuang knew that the power of the will of the Heavenly Dao in this territory was much stronger than before.

As expected, the will of the Heavenly Dao had been keeping an eye on this territory. He had just stepped into this territory, so it was not a big deal.

However, once he fought in this territory and revealed his powerful strength or revealed his trump card, the power of the will of the Heavenly Dao would immediately be sensed, the experts hiding in this territory would definitely come to kill him at the first moment.

“Fortunately, my purpose of returning to the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow is only for the opportunity in the secret realm. I don’t want to have any friction or fight with others. At most, I just want to walk around. As long as I don’t make a move, the power of the will of heaven and the experts hiding in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow will never know that I have returned.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly, put on a strange smile.
