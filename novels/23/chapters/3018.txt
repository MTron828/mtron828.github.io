“Argh!”

Gold King’s angry roar reverberated between heaven and earth.

The golden spear in his hand had been thrust straight out.

With this thrust, a huge ‘golden sun’ appeared between them in an instant.

This ‘golden sun’ was extremely dazzling. It released billions of golden rays of light that illuminated the surroundings, making the surrounding experts unable to open their eyes.

Jian Wushuang stood in front of the golden sun and felt a majestic and extreme power.

This power was much stronger than the spear technique that Gold King had used before.

“A rank three absolute art, at least an advanced rank three absolute art!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes shone with a fierce light, and his fighting spirit instantly soared.

Buzz, buzz, a large amount of divine power surged crazily. At this moment, Jian Wushuang had unleashed all the power of his divine power.

100% divine power!

Jian Wushuang burst out with all his strength.

He held the Blood Mountain Sword with one hand, holding the endless power in his hand, and suddenly slashed out.

A dazzling sword light suddenly lit up.

The sword light was also silent, but the moment it lit up, it roared. A roar of a fierce beast echoed in the world.

It was a sword light, but in the blink of an eye, it turned into a huge and ferocious beast head.

Space-time swordsmanship…Xi Xiang!

The two strongest swordsmanships that were created by Jian Wushuang.

The first move of Star Dream was a rank three absolute art, and it had already formed the embryonic form of swordsmanship.

As for Xi Xiang, it was only a rank two absolute art, and it was not perfect, so it could not form the embryonic form of swordsmanship.

But the power of Xi Xiang was heavy!

The power of Star Dream was heavy tearing and cutting!

Now it was a head-on collision between the two, so of course, Jian Wushuang used the move of ‘Xi Xiang’.

The huge and ferocious head of the exotic beast collided with the ‘golden sun’ which carried a shocking power in the blink of an eye.

It was a collision between a rank three and a rank two secret skill, so Gold King should have been able to crush Jian Wushuang.

But in the end…bang!

After a loud sound, Jian Wushuang and Gold King were both sent flying, but Jian Wushuang was sent farther away.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang regained his balance and looked up at Gold King, feeling extremely excited.

“As expected of an expert who has comprehended the principles of gold. He is strong and powerful, and he used an advanced third-level skill, which is much stronger than my Xi Xiang move. My divine power is much stronger than his, but I’m still at a disadvantage in a head-on collision,” Jian Wushuang thought.

Gold King was also very surprised.

“How can this be? He’s clearly only using a rank two ultimate art, how can he only be at a disadvantage in a head-on clash with me?” Gold King found it hard to accept.

However, he quickly understood.

“It’s divine power. His divine power’s power hasn’t been fully unleashed before. I estimate that he’s only used 70-80% of it.”

“He’s just a rank one True Saint. He’s only using 70-80% of his divine power’s power, but he’s actually able to fight me to a draw?

“Now that he’s using his full strength, even if his absolute art can’t be compared to mine, his divine power is not much weaker than mine. This guy…” Gold King’s face was a bit ugly.

“I don’t believe it!”

With a low shout, Gold King attacked again.

Jian Wushuang was fearless and directly went up to meet him.

In the void, the two exchanged blows again and again. Each time they exchanged blows, they directly displayed their ultimate skills.

Naturally, Jian Wushuang displayed the move of ‘Xi Xiang’, while Gold King also displayed the ‘Golden Sun’.

Without any particular technique, Jian Wushuang did not even bother to display his speed advantage. He directly confronted him head-on!

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

A low sound of collision was heard in the world.

Each time they collided, their divine power formed a terrifying shock wave, which swept out in all directions.

Under the shock wave, the gale in the world raged, and the entire void roared crazily.

The head-on collision only lasted for a moment, and Jian Wushuang pulled away from Gold King again.

“Boy, why are you running? Are you afraid?” Gold King shouted when he saw Jian Wushuang retreat.

“Afraid?” Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “I’m sorry, I just feel that your strength is weaker than I expected and you can’t put too much pressure on me, so I don’t want to continue fighting with you.”

“What did you say?” Gold King was furious.

He was a rank three True Saint, and he was almost at the peak of rank three. He was fighting with a rank one True Saint, but his opponent said that he was weak and did not pose much of a threat to him?

This was a slap to his face, and he was fighting in front of so many experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom. How could he not be angry?

How could he not be angry?

However, he did not know that Jian Wushuang was not deliberately provoking him. He said this because he had such a feeling when he fought with Gold King.

“Gold King is indeed very strong, but it’s a pity that even if he uses his strongest spear to fight me, he is only slightly in the upper hand. He can’t even suppress me. I haven’t even used my speed advantage.” Jian Wushuang laughed in his heart.

With his current strength, he did not need to use any secret skills. He only needed to use his speed and silver light movement skills. He was confident that he could suppress Gold King.

In such a situation, how could Gold King give him any pressure?

“I won’t waste time with him. I’ll just attack and defeat him.” Jian Wushuang’s expression became serious, and his eyes flashed.

Rumble…

A large amount of golden divine power began to gather behind Jian Wushuang.

The divine power was as vast as the sea, and in the blink of an eye, it formed a huge Golden Emperor Phantom behind Jian Wushuang.

The Golden Emperor Phantom was 30,000 feet tall, wearing golden armor and shining with golden light. Its pair of golden eyes had a sense of arrogance that was above all things in the world. It looked down and intimidated everything below.

In the surrounding void, there were many experts from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom gathered there. At this moment, they saw the existence of the 300,000-foot-tall Golden Emperor Phantom.

At the same time, they also sensed the golden eyes of the Golden Emperor Phantom. The golden eyes seemed to contain a special demonic power as they swept across the surrounding void.

With this sweep, everyone present was stunned. It was as though they were being stared at by an ancient emperor. They could not help but feel their hearts palpitate.

Even the Gold King’s pupils shrank when he saw the 30,000 feet tall Golden Emperor Phantom.
