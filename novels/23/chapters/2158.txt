Chapter 2159 Killing Spree

Jian Wushuang attacked.

His understanding of the Spacetime Doctrine was at the ninth level of the Doctrine Palace. He was extremely fast.

He moved around agilely in the space and the Ancient Blood Beasts who were at the power level of emperor gods could not catch up to him.

He swung his Blood Mountain Sword at these beasts.

Each swing was casual.

Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! Pfft! ~~

Sounds of the sword penetrating the bodies of these exotic beasts reverberated in the air. The self-defense mechanism these beasts had were sliced apart like paper.

Within moments, Jian Wushuang swung eight times. Eight heads came off and fell to the ground.

Even though the beasts attacked, they were not even close to touching Jian Wushuang.

After this short exchange, the eyes of the remaining seven exotic beasts turned even more sanguine as they looked up and howled.

“Arhwooo!””Arhwooo! “Arhwooo!”

The piercing sounds radiated out in all directions.

“What is this?” Jian Wushuang thought to himself before realising why these beasts were howling.

Instantly, many more blood-red figures appeared in space.

Many of them came from every corner possible and within moments, more than hundreds of them had gathered there. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This was only within the immediate vicinity. Jian Wushuang could see that there were even more of such beasts rushing over from further away.

“Oh my. How many of such beasts are there in the forbidden ground?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

One single exotic beast was already scary enough.

If hundreds or even thousands of them gathered, this force would be something to reckon with even if the army from Eternal Chaotic World was there.

While Jian Wushuang was in disbelief, the large amounts of Ancient Blood Beasts stared at Jian Wushuang with their bloody, cold eyes, which were radiating gloom.

At the next instant, these beast attacked.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Almost every exotic beast there pounced at Jian Wushuang.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang was facing at least hundreds of these exotic beasts.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang grunted as his monstrous aura exploded.

However, his aura was not sufficient to stop these exotic beasts.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang controlled his seven Hong Jun Golden Swords using the power of spacetime as they burst forth as beams of golden light simultaneously.

These seven swords were far too fast and powerful.

The seven swords appeared in front of seven of such exotic beasts and penetrated their bodies without any obstructions.

Then, the seven swords changed their targets and attacked seven other exotic beasts.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang grew in size. Heads and arms started to grow out of his body.

Eighteen arms grew, each holding a sword. Waves of terrifying sword essence radiated out of him.

“Kill!””Kill!””Kill!”

Jian Wushuang started his massacre.

Every sword light was incredibly wild and powerful. These exotic beasts who were at the mere level of emperor god died instantly when they came into contact with the sword lights. On the other hand, Jian Wushuang continued to swing the eighteen swords he was holding in his hands. This meant that at any point in time, eighteen sword lights would come out of his sword and attack these beasts.

Additionally, there were seven Hong Jun Golden Swords assisting him…

How scary would that be?

Dead bodies could be seen falling down towards the ground.

Within seconds, the first ten exotic beasts that had attacked Jian Wushuang were killed.

However, behind these exotic beasts, more of them started to pounce towards Jian Wushuang.

“Haha. Bring in on! I want to see how many of you I can kill.”

Jian Wushuang laughed wildly.

He started a killing spree as he made use of his close combat abilities and the seven Hong Jun Golden Sword.

Large numbers of Ancient Blood Beasts were mercilessly killed before they could even put up a fight.

Within moments, two larger exotic beasts appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang slashed at them casually.

The two exotic beasts too slashed out fiercely.

Clang! Clang!

Sounds of metallic collisions rang in his ears as he saw the two exotic beasts flew back. Jian Wushuang also took a step back.

“Huh?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the two exotic beasts in surprise. “They are at the great emperor level?”

Furthermore, there were seven more ancient blood beasts that looked significantly bigger than the remaining exotic beasts.

“There are seven more, which means there are nine exotic beasts at the power level of great emperors?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Nine beasts at the power level of great emperor and hundreds of others at the power level of emperor god surrounded him.

This force was very powerful.

“This force is slightly stronger than even the Special Tribes Alliance. This forbidden ground is really terrifying.” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

Luckily, Emperor Bai had sent him to come and scout personally.

If it had been any other great emperor, they would probably have died when facing these beasts.

It definitely deserved its title of being the most dangerous land in this world.

“These beasts stopped attacking. What are they planning to do?” Jian Wushuang surveyed the area coldly.

After the two beasts with power levels of a great emperor were forced back by Jian Wushuang, the remaining beasts stopped in their tracks.

They simply stared at Jian Wushuang with great killing intent.

Right then…

“Arhwooo!”

The same howl was heard, but this one was much lounder, deeper and more powerful.

After the howl, a gigantic figure appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“There is an even stronger being?” Jian Wushuang thought as he was finally taking things seriously.
