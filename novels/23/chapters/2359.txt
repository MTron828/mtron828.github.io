Chapter 2360: Jian Wushuang’s Choice

“Little one, have you decided whether you will go with me to the Great Compassion Sect or go with him to the Water Fairy Island?” Bai Yue smiled as he looked over at Jian Wushuang.

Bai Yue was absolutely confident of Jian Wushuang’s choice.

The Great Compassion Sect and the Water Fairy Sect were both top tier clans within the Wusha Barren Region. However, the Great Compassion Sect was definitely the most powerful clan here.

Furthermore, the most powerful sword cultivator, Brahman Sword Fairy wanted to take him in as a lineal disciple.

He believed that Jian Wushuang was not dumb and how to make a proper decision.

The people around looking at Jian Wushuang also seemed to have guessed Jian Wushuang’s decision.

“Brother Wushuang will choose the Great Compassion Sect, right?” Lin Yan said softly at one corner.

“Definitely the Great Compassion Sect.” Lin Tao nodded his head. “Even though the Water Fairy Island is powerful, it cannot be compared to the Great Compassion Sect as it is inferior in terms of overall power, foundation, and the number of talented geniuses. There are four Twelve Young Kings in the Wusha Barren Region within the Great Compassion Sect, and the strongest of them all, Zhu Qiancheng, is also there!”

“And now, the Great Compassion Sect is recruiting him to become a lineal disciple of an ancient elder. Anyone will take up this offer without hesitation.”

The people from Thunder Sound Sect thought this way.

Right then, Jian Wushuang smiled lightly and said, “Lord Commandery Governor. I thank you for your goodwill but I want to go to the Water Fairy Island with this lord right here.”

“Huh?” Bai Yue was stunned.

Wu Jian was overjoyed.

“Little friend Wushuang, you are serious about going to the Water Fairy Island with me?” Wu Jian could not believe his own years. The way he addressed Jian Wushuang changed as well.

“Of course, but under one condition.” Jian Wushuang said.

“What is it?” Wu Jian was excited.

He was prepared to agree to Jian Wushuang’s condition as long as it was not too excessive that the Water Fairy Island could not fulfill or be heavily disabled in order to fulfill his condition.

He knew that it was worth it for the Water Fairy Island to strive for what Jian Wushuang wanted as it would definitely be worth it.

“My condition is very simple. I want to be an outer disciple in the Water Fairy Island.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Outer disciple?” Wu Jian was stunned.

The people around were also stunned when they heard what Jian Wushuang said.

“He rejected my offer of going to the Great Compassion Sect and the chance of becoming the lineal disciple of the most powerful sword cultivator in the Wusha Barren Region so that you can become an outer disciple in the Water Fairy Island? This little one is interesting.” Bai Yue looked at Jian Wushuang with great interest.

“Little friend Wushuang. With your talent, it is easy for you to become a core disciple or even a lineal disciple of one of the most powerful experts within the Water Fairy Island. On the other hand, the amount of resources you will get as an outer disciple is very little. It will be nurtured to the fullest, you...” Wu Jian opened his mouth and said.

Jian Wushuang waved his hands and interrupted Wu Jian, “I only want to be a normal disciple without any restrictions. Does my lord accept my condition? If not, I will go and join another clan.”

“Yes, of course. It is just that...” Wu Jian nodded his head quickly.

He was about to continue but he stopped himself.

Jian Wushuang had already said that he did not want too many restrictions. He did not bother if he was a core disciple or if he was an ordinary disciple.

Wu Jian could not force Jian Wushuang to listen to him.

“If that is the case, can my lord stay in the Lin Mansion for a few days? Once I am ready, I will go to the Water Fairy Island with you.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes.” Wu Jian agreed.

“Haha. It seems like I wasted my trip here.” Bai Yue laughed awkwardly.

“Sir Bai Yue, little friend Wushuang grew up in the Anjiu Prefecture. During all these years, I am sure that you have helped him in many ways. Since he became one of the disciples of the Water Fairy Island, we will prepare a generous gift for you.” Wu Jian smiled.

“Oh, thanks a lot.” Bai Yue smiled a little and he seemed to be in a better mood. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He wanted to introduce Jian Wushuang to the Great Compassion Sect and obtain great rewards from this “transaction”.

Now that his plan was disrupted, his hard work would not go to waste if the Water Fairy Island would give him a generous gift.

“Little one, even though I suggest that you go to the Great Compassion Sect, the Water Fairy Island is a good place as well. I hope that you will grow and realize your full potential. We will meet one day in the future.” Bai Yue smiled and left.

“Goodbye, Lord Commandery Governor!”

“Goodbye, Lord Commandery Governor!”

The experts in the Lin Mansion bid Bai Yue goodbye.

After Bai Yue left.

“Little friend Wushuang, I have heard that you have encountered some trouble within the Anjiu Prefecture. Some people even threatened you. Do you need me to settle this for you?” Wu Jian looked at the experts from the Golden Cauldron Sect with killing intent in his eyes.

The experts from the Golden Cauldron Sect felt a chill down their spine when they met Wu Jian’s gaze.

Even though the experts from the Golden Cauldron Sect were not weak, Wu Jian could definitely kill them right here.

“They are just a bunch of jokers. Ignore them.” Jian Wushuang smiled lightly.

The experts from the Golden Cauldron Sect heaved a sigh of relief.

“Let us go!”

Even though they were embarrassed, Qian Yuan and Xiang Yi did not dare to stay any longer and left immediately.

At the same time, they knew that there was no way they could take revenge on Jian Wushuang anymore.

They no longer had the chance and ability to do so anymore.

After the experts from the Golden Cauldron Sect and the Xiang Family left, the Lin Mansion turned peaceful once again.

“Little friend Wushuang, when will we leave for the Water Fairy Island?” Wu Jian asked gently. He was a tier one Chaotic Divine Demon, yet he did not put up a front at all.

“Within ten days.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Alright. I will wait here for ten days.” Wu Jian was elated.

He was willing to wait for months just so that Jian Wushuang would return to the Water Fairy Island with him.

“Everyone, I have already prepared accommodation for all of you. You can rest there.” Lin Tiefeng came up and said respectfully.

“That is a good idea, head of the Lin Family. I will take up that offer.” Wu Jian said.

“My lords, this way please.”

Lin Tiefeng said enthusiastically.
