Chapter 1412: State of Mind

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Ten years is really too short!”

“In such a short period of time, even if you picked a suitable secret skill from the Scripture Depository, you wouldn’t have time to cultivate it,” Hall Master Yuan creased his eyebrows.

The four secret skills in Lineage of Star, every single one of them was impressive.

If Jian Wushuang were to cultivate the other secret skills under the prerequisite of the secret skill of Star Palace, the possibility of passing the Inverse Cultivation Test would definitely increase tremendously.

It was a pity that he didn’t have enough time!

After all, the stronger the secret skill, the tougher it was to cultivate.

Just like the few secret skills in Scripture Depository, no matter how brilliant a genius one was, no one could expect to learn the fundamentals without a dozen years of training. Hence, ten years wasn’t enough.

“Forget about the secret skills. You can’t prepare too many things in ten years. The most important part is understanding the second Inverse Cultivation Test more and being mentally prepared. That will heighten the possibility of passing,” Lei Chao said.

“You’re right,” Hall Master Yuan nodded in agreement.

If it were just an ordinary cultivator’s God’s Test, they wouldn’t need to be so worried over the fact that they only had ten years to prepare.

The most crucial point was that Jian Wushuang was going through an Inverse Cultivation Test.

They weren’t familiar with Inverse Cultivation Tests. They didn’t know what Jian Wushuang would come across during his second Inverse Cultivation Test.

The unknown is always the scariest.

“Jian Wushuang, you’ve been through your first Inverse Cultivation Test. Tell us what you have been through during your first Inverse Cultivation Test. We shall help to predict,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Jian Wushuang immediately described his experience of First Inverse Cultivation briefly.

After that, both Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao both looked terrified.

“The first Inverse Cultivator Test has a total of nine Sacred Thunder? And the very last one was a combination of thunder test, fire test and mind test altogether?”

“Oh my God!”

The two experts were astonished.

“Just the very first Inverse Cultivator Test already combined thunder test, fire test and mind time. I really couldn’t imagine what you would come across during your second Inverse Cultivator Test,” Hall Master Yuan looked at Jian Wushuang.

“I can’t tell either,” Lei Chao shook his head, but he beamed with joy and said, “We can’t tell because we don’t really know much about Inverse Cultivation, we seldom once see people passing Inverse Cultivation Test. However, the Palace Master is powerful and knowledgeable. Who knows? He might know something about the second Inverse Cultivation Test.”

“Palace Master?” Hall Master Yuan too was delighted.

Palace Master of Star Palace, the founder of Lineage of Star, the supreme expert on the top of the pyramid in Eternal Chaotic World was an ancient existence who had lived for god knows how long.

Such a supreme expert must know more about inverse cultivation than they did.

“Let me ask Palace Master now,” Hall Master Yuan immediately sent an inquiry through the communication token.

Soon, there was a reply.

“The Palace Master said that the inverse cultivators are the most unique existences in the Eternal Chaotic World. It is too rare in the Eternal Chaotic World. Even he didn’t know much about the Inverse Cultivation Test. However, he once talked to another Almighty many years back. The Almighty brought up inverse cultivation and also the Inverse Cultivation Test. The second Inverse Cultivation Test seems to focus not on the power but on mind!” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Mind? State of mind?” Jian Wushuang’s pupils contracted.

“Isn’t it like a mind test then?” Lei Chao looked over.

“Different.” Hall Master Yuan shook his head, “It’s another test aimed at one’s mind. However, Inverse Cultivation Tests are much scarier than mind tests!”

Jian Wushuang looked solemn.

State of mind…

State of mind and consciousness, they were entirely different.

The strength of consciousness constantly improved along with the improvement of cultivators’ power. However, state of mind would only improve continuously through life encounters. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Some had it smooth sailing all their lives until they reached the top. Even if they were extremely powerful, their state of mind might not be strong.

But some people were very weak in strength, their state of mind was extremely strong, as they been through many tough experiences.

Jian Wushuang belonged to the latter group.

Ever since he had risen up from the Ancient World, he encountered countless frustrations and hardships. He struggled again and again on the verge of life and death. Through such situations, he had been strengthened.

His heart was so firm and tenacious that it was never shaken.

However, he was dealing with an Inverse Cultivation Test after all. He couldn’t be definite that his state of mind could pass through the Inverse Cultivation Test.

“As we know that the second Inverse Cultivation Test focuses on state of mind. We will figure some methods out over the next few training years,” Hall Master Yuan squinted and continued, “In Eternal Chaotic World, there are many mystery lands and unique places that could give good training to one’s state of mind.

“You only have ten years. You don’t have to go to those mystery lands, but you can try in this one place.”

“Where?” Jian Wushuang looked.

“Dark Phoenix Pavilion!” Hall Master Yuan replied.

“Dark Phoenix Pavilion is second to Lineage of Star in Star land. There are many experts and even Real God experts. The one thing lacking was that they didn’t have an Almighty in charge. In Dark Phoenix Pavilion, there’s a training ground called Mind Cliff. It focuses on training state of mind. It is quite famous on Star land, even throughout the entire Purple Moon Sanctuary. If you were to train for a few years on Mind Cliff, it should be helpful to you.”

“Mind Cliff?” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Lineage of Star has always been revered by Dark Phoenix Pavilion. If I were to talk to their Pavilion Master personally and send some treasures over, it shouldn’t be a problem for you to train for a few years on Mind Cliff,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“If so, sorry for the trouble Hall Master Yuan,” Jian Wushuang expressed his gratitude.

“No big deal. Plus, you performed well in the battle. Theoretically, you should be granted many things. These are just extras. Consider it the price to pay for Dark Phoenix Pavilion,” Hall Master Yuan smiled and instructed again, “Lei Chao, you will bring this young man to Dark Phoenix Pavilion personally then.”

“Alright,” Lei Chao nodded.

“During the years you are in Dark Phoenix Pavilion, I’ll have people clear up Firmament World as a place for you to pass through your Inverse Cultivation Test,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Firmament World was an independent space. There were no cultivators or living things in it. Although Lineage of Star controlled the world, it was useless normally. If it were to be used as a venue to pass through an Inverse Cultivation Test, it’d be the best option.

It was a place cut off from external worlds. Regardless of how great the power and movement Jian Wushuang’s Inverse Cultivation Test was, no one would notice.

“Go ahead!”

Hall Master Yuan waved.

Soon, Jian Wushuang headed to the Dark Phoenix Pavilion with Lei Chao.
