4674 Besieging and Killing Devouring Emperor (2)

Devouring Emperor stared at Jian Wushuang and said, “You will regret it, but there is no room for regret from now on.”

After he said that, the starry sky began to collapse. Nearly 10,000 Star Fields collapsed at the same time, and countless lightning snakes fell from the ancient void.

A unique energy that did not belong to the Void Universe was born and strengthened Devouring Emperor.

The Great Daos belonging to the Void Universe could not withstand it at all and collapsed on their own.

For some reason, Jian Wushuang felt a sense of familiarity when he sensed the unique energy around Devouring Emperor.

Old Master’s usually calm face finally furrowed its brows at this moment, and the hand holding the black scepter of power tightened.

“Wushuang, take them back to the Divine Power Universe,” Old Master said slowly.

Jian Wushuang nodded. Obviously, he also felt that there was something unusual about this. “Okay, you come with us.”

Old Master shook his head. “Don’t worry about me. Leave quickly!”

Without waiting for Jian Wushuang to speak, Devouring Emperor, who was standing in the void, waved his hand and released a dark halo, which enveloped everyone.

“All of you should stay. There’s no turning back,” Devouring Emperor said in a deep voice as he slowly opened his arms. The mighty energy he released made the Great Dao collapse.

Jian Wushuang smiled, “Since we can’t leave, let’s kill him!”

The pure and sharp Sword Intent rose like a reverse river, and the Ancestor realm divine power broke through the siege and fought against Devouring Emperor.

Old Master, who was standing next to Jian Wushuang, followed the river of Sword Dao and chased after Devouring Emperor.

With a wave of his hand, layers of divine punishment descended. The ethereal secret text was like thousands of arrays, stopping Old Master’s figure.

In the next moment, Jian Wushuang held an Invisible Sword in his hand and rushed forward.

The mighty divine punishment was shattered by the Sword Intent, allowing Old Master to face Devouring Emperor!

The black scepter of power transformed into a massive palm that blotted out the sky, and it continued to smash toward him.

With a smile, Devouring Emperor retreated quickly. From the broken sky, a giant ugly face suddenly appeared and bit Old Master.

“Die!” A cold shout that seemed to come from another world resounded. The Tarot Divine Sword turned into a slash that split the sky and easily destroyed the ugly face.

The two black-robed figures attacked Devouring Emperor together.

Although the power was still terrifying, it could not cause any serious injuries to Old Master or Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took the opportunity to use all his divine powers in an instant, trying to severely injure him!

Devouring Emperor barely managed to turn around to suppress Old Master’s full-power attack, but his back was now exposed to Jian Wushuang.

Transcendence Heavenly Gate, Extreme Darkness Heavenly Gate.

Wushuang Sword Dao, Star River Lake Sea Sword Intent. He unleashed everything he had on Devouring Emperor’s back.

It was as if the galaxy in the sky was surging, directly covering the entire shattered starry sky.

Jian Wushuang and Old Master retreated quickly and looked at the starry sky with serious expressions.

Only when the vast Sword Intant completely dissipated did a figure slowly appear.

The black and gold clothes on his body were mostly torn, and the Tarot Divine Sword was stuck in his chest.

Emperor Devourer’s face darkened. He reached out his hand and straightened the crown on his head with difficulty, then pulled out the Tarot Divine Sword from his heart.

“My Lord!”

The remaining six members of Devourers surrounded him.

Devouring Emperor let out a wry smile. He shook his arm, and the Tarot Divine Sword, one of the Supreme Ancestral Weapons that could cut through everything, was broken into two.

Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank. The Tarot Divine Sword that had accompanied him for millions of years and killed by his side to this day was actually broken!

Devouring Emperor threw the hilt of the Tarot Divine Sword in front of Jian Wushuang.

He reached out his hand and caught the hilt of the sword. He could no longer suppress his anger. He raised the Invisible Sword high and slashed at Devouring Emperor!

At the same time, Old Master also moved, and a world-shaking Black Water phantom form came over.

Devouring Emperor’s eyes glowed with black light. He waved his arms, and two rays of black light expanded in the wind, lashing at the two.

After cutting the black light, Jian Wushuang attacked again. At the same time, Old Master’s attack also came down.

Jian Wushuang’s strongest attack broke the strange energy around Devouring Emperor and the Black Water image suppressed it.

Rumble…

The endless energy turned into a rolling tide, devouring everything. The six members of the Devourers who could not escape in time were all swallowed up.

The starry sky collapsed on a large scale, revealing the ancient and dead void.

Jian Wushuang stood still and gasped for breath. His entire right arm was cracked and divine blood gushed out.

When the energy tide slowly receded, Devouring Emperor showed up in an extremely miserable state.

He suddenly coughed out a mouthful of divine blood. Even though he was in a sorry state, he still looked majestic.

“You’ve lost,” Jian Wushuang stepped forward slowly and said in a cold voice.

“I… lost?” Devouring Emperor seemed to be saying to him, but it also seemed to be saying to himself, “How can I lose?”

Devouring Emperor raised his head and looked at him and Old Master. “How can I lose?” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

With that, a vast black light surged from his raised palm and entered the ultimate void.

Buzz…

The black light, which was like a giant pillar that held up the sky, did not dissipate for a long time. Layers of dim halos spread out in the void like waves.

Jian Wushuang did not understand what this meant, but Old Master’s expression changed.

Seeing Old Master’s face change, Devouring Emperor laughed as if he had vented his anger. “How can I be defeated? How could I possibly lose?!”

“Since you want me to die, don’t even think about having an easy time. I think they will soon sense my aura and lock onto this place.”

“I want all of you to be buried with me!” He coughed out another mouthful of divine blood. Devouring Emperor had gone mad.

“However, there’s one more way. The choice is in your hands. Let me go, and I will never let them find this place.”

Jian Wushuang looked at Old Master and he had a clear idea.

“Do you know what I hate the most?” A deep voice came from Old Master’s mouth, and his eyes gradually turned cold. “I hate threats the most!”

In the next moment, the black scepter suddenly stopped, and thousands of Black Water chains wrapped around Devouring Emperor, dragging him toward Old Master.

The birth and death of all living things were reflected in its pitch-black pupils, and even time was in its desolation.

“No! You can’t kill me!” Devouring Emperor finally cried out in fear.

“Jian Wushuang, if I die, Xuan Yi will definitely not agree!” Devouring Emperor looked at Jian Wushuang as if he was looking at his last life-saving straw.

Jian Wushuang’s heart trembled when he heard the name, “How much more do you know about him?”

“I-I know a lot, as long as you let me…” Before he could finish, Old Master had already killed him completely, not even leaving behind his divine soul.
