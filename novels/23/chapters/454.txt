Chapter 455: The Fighting Between the Lords

Translator:?Transn?Editor:?Transn

Demon Soul Lord was fighting with Loftiness Lord, a lord from Marquis Piaoxue’s camp.

“It’s amazing that Loftiness Lord is managing to hold his own against that old witch.” Silver Wing Lord was surprised.

“Pay attention to the weapon he is using.” Iron Saber Lord looked solemn as his eyes fixed on the blood-red spear Loftiness Lord was using.

The spear was conspicuous because it possessed a daunting aura that couldn’t be found in other weapons.

“It’s a Dao Weapon!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were sparkling. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Just now, he had learned something about these two lords who were busy fighting.

Demon Soul Lord was extremely powerful among superior lords, only a step away from becoming a marquis.

However, Loftiness Lord was just an advanced lord.

He should be no match for Demon Soul Lord, yet he was currently holding on in a close fight, only because he had a Dao Weapon.

“Is this the power of a Dao Weapon? Can it enable an advanced lord to challenge a superior lord?” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

“It can be much more powerful than this when it’s in the hands of a marquis. Loftiness Lord can’t display its full power,” said Iron Saber Lord.

Jian Wushuang was in awe. The Dao Weapon aroused his interest despite the fact that he was only good with swords, not spears.

“Swordsman, Silver Wing and I won’t be able to look at for you the whole time, so keep away from those lords and don’t expose yourself to them.” Iron Saber Lord shot Jian Wushuang a glance and then quickly turned to Silver Wing, “Let’s join the fight.”

“Ok.” Silver Wing Lord responded with a nod.

Immediately, two flowing light shot forward as the two lords dived directly into the fight.

“Two more fighters!”

“It’s Iron Saber Lord and Silver Wing Lord!”

“Merely an advanced lord and an intermediate lord! Hold them off!”

As soon as the order was issued, some experts from Marquis Cangyue’s camp immediately came forward to battle Iron Saber Lord and Silver Wing Lord.

Except for their opponents, the two lords had not attracted the attention of anyone else because there were already dozens of lords fighting.

After all, experts from both sides were continuously joining the battle.

“There are more and more lords coming.”?Jian Wushuang stood still at the edge of the battlefield, remaining uninvolved.

To him, it was a rare scene. The battlefield was constantly expanding as the number of lords increased.

In a short while, the number of lords that were fighting had exceeded 50, but the number of lords from each side was close, causing both sides to be locked an intense fight.

“Only a Dao Weapon can cause so many lords to fight like this,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

The fighting had already lasted for a long time without the loss of too many lords. Most of the experts from the two sides were equal in strength, so the number of lords that died was not large.

Right then...

Swish!

From one of the outer tunnels, a figure charged out and entered the battlefield.

The presence of this figure caused a stir on the battlefield.

“Myriad Islands Lord!”

“Haha, Myriad Islands Lord has arrived.”

“Damn, it’s Myriad Islands Lord.”

The lords from both sides showed different expressions due to this new arrival. Those from Marquis Cangyue’s side were delighted, while those from the other side looked worried.

Myriad Islands Lord was well-known in his camp, Marquis Cangyue’s camp.

However, it was not for his power as a lord, but his fame as an excellent master in Formations. After all, he was just an advanced lord, so he did not surpass very many of the people here.

“Hump!”

Myriad Islands Lord snorted as he entered the battlefield, then he waved his hands twice and released two light beams that swept through the area. The lights quickly turned into two wide Formations.

“He set up two Formations so easily?”

“He must have been prepared for this.”

“We’re in big trouble!”

The lords from Marquis Piaoxue’s camp frowned. They knew, even though the Formations had been set up casually, the power behind them had to be extraordinary. It didn’t take long for their worries to turn out to be true.

“I’m regaining my Spiritual Power!”

“So am I! I can feel it, I’m regaining my Spiritual Power at a threefold rate.”

“So am I, and it’s even more than that, I can sense that my power has been strengthened.”

“Yes, I felt that too!”

The experts on Marquis Cangyue’s side realized how the Formations worked.

One of the Formations could help the experts regain their Spiritual Power, and the other one could enhance their attacks to a certain extent. The Formations elevated the strength of Marquis Cangyue’s camp a lot.

“Haha, Myriad Islands Lord is so helpful.”

“With these two Formations, we no longer need to be afraid of anyone.”

“Kill them all!”

The lords on Marquis Cangyue’s side gained courage and began launching attacks, one after another.

The balance between the two camps had been broken by Myriad Islands Lord and his Formations. Now, Marquis Cangyue’s side had gained the upper hand.

“Shit!”

“Damn it!”

“That horrible Myriad Islands Lord!”

The experts of Marquis Piaoxue’s side looked grave, but they still tried their best to hold their opponents back.

At the center of the battlefield, as the Formations were set up, Loftiness Lord began to experience even more pressure than before. After all, the only reason he could stand up against his opponent, the more powerful Demon Soul Lord, was because of the Dao Weapon.

“Loftiness, you know that my marquis is a spear-user, so this Dao Weapon is very important to him. I advise you to give it up now, before you get yourself killed,” Demon Soul Lord said in a warning tone.

“Hmph! You will only get it over my dead body,” Loftiness Lord said and snorted.

“You’re courting death!” Demon Soul Lord charged at Loftiness Lord in a rage.
