Chapter 1411: A Sudden Change

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The deacon announced the results of the battle that Ling Feibai had won.

This result, originally within the public’s expectations, wouldn’t be surprising to the many disciples who had watched the battle.

But the result caused a stir.

Many disciples began to talk about it.

“Ling Feibai almost lost!”

“He wouldn’t have lost the battle if he hadn’t used the skills from the Golden Pavilion.”

Everyone couldn’t help exclaiming about Jian Wushuang’s power and skills, which had caused great difficulties to Ling Feibai.

The Supreme Heaven that Ling Feibai had used was one of the four secret skills of the Lineage of Star. Only cultivators reaching the third level of the Stat Tower could learn and use it.

Now, among the Universe Gods of the Second Heaven, only Ling Feibai had reached the third level of the Star Tower. It was reasonable and fair to use it in this battle.

Jian Wushuang also admitted that Ling Feibai was indeed stronger than himself.

“I’m looking forward to battling with you next time.” Ling Feibai looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Me too.” Jian Wushuang nodded with a smile.

Jian Wushuang was quite respectful to Ling Feibai after battling with him, especially when Ling Feibai had voluntarily conceded the battle.

He decided to challenge Ling Feibai again when he improved his skills later.

Jian Wushuang and Ling Feibai became good friends.

But at that moment, an astonishingly loud sound suddenly burst out.

Boom!

An astonishing power of destruction, without any forewarning, spread directly all over the endless Galaxy.

It was accompanied by a resounding roar.

“What’s happening?”

“What’s this?”

Everyone in the Titanic Star raised his head. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Hall Master Yuan and the other deacons also raised their heads to see what was happening.

Oh!

A brilliant, dazzling thunderstorm suddenly came, shocking everyone.

“This is… a God Test? ” Even Hall Master Yuan Palace was shocked, “A God Test without any signs?” And the attack even penetrated the inherently powerful defense system of our Lineage of Star?

Everyone was shocked and horrified.

The thunderstorm crossed all the barriers and struck one figure.

The figure was Jian Wushuang.

Boom!

The dazzling thunder burst apart over the divine body of Jian Wushuang, with a sweeping destructive power.

Jian Wushuang stayed unscathed and calm.

When the thunder had completely dissipated, Jian Wushuang looked at the sky, feeling suprised.

“The second God Test is coming so early?”

“Unexpectedly fast!”

Jian Wushuang tightened his hands with worry.

In the middle of the Galaxy, Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao looked at each other face to face, and they already understood why the thunder had suddenly come.

This is a sign of Jian Wushuang’s second Inverse Cultivation God Test!

The first sign of Jian Wushuang’s God Test was only a thundercloud.

But now the sign of the second test had directly transformed into a thunderstorm!

Obviously, the second God Test would be way more difficult than the first.

At this time, Hall Master Yuan ordered, “Jian Wushuang, leave here with me. Everyone else, continue your battles.”

Then Jian Wushuang left the place with Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao.

The disciples and deacons in the Titanic Star were confused without knowing what was going on.

“Is Jian Wushuang’s third God Test coming?”

Many disciples speculated.

But they knew that it had nothing to do with them so they soon continued their battles.

…

After a while, Jian Wushuang arrived at the crystal palace with Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao.

They started to talk about the God Test.

“Jian Wushuang, the Sacred Thunder should be the sign of your Inverse Cultivation Test.” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Oh my god, the mere sign of your God Test equals other’s Inverse Cultivation Tests.” Hall Master Yuan couldn’t help exclaiming.

“Jian Wushuang, how soon will your Inverse Cultivation Test be?” Lei Chao asked.

“Ten years.” Jian Wushuang answered.

“So soon?!” Both Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao were shocked.

After all, ordinary practitioners had a relatively long period of time to prepare for their God Test, at least a few hundreds of years, or even thousands of years.

But now, Jian Wushuang only had ten years to prepare for his Second Inverse Cultivation Test.

“It’s too short indeed.” Jian Wushuang agreed.

Before his first God Test, he was given 120 years to prepare, but now there was only ten years… On that trajectory, Jian Wushuang’s third Inverse Cultivation Test would come directly without any preparation time.

“It’s difficult to prepare in only ten years.” Lei Chao frowned.

“Indeed.” The master of YuanDian looked over and said, “But, fortunately, since you have an amazing performance in the battle, you can get a bonus. Besides, you have passed the nineteenth level of the Illusionary Mind Sea. According to the rules of our Lineage of Star, you can go to the Scripture Depository and choose another secret skill to practice.”

“The second secret skill?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Among the four Great Secret Skills, the most famous were Secret Skills of Star Palace, which were admired by all the disciples in the Lineage of Star.

But if you wanted to practice the second secret, you needed to meet certain conditions. You needed to break through the third floor of the Star Tower.

But only the one who had passed the third level of the Star Tower could cultivate another Secret Skill. Only Ling Feibai did.

Why was Jian Wushuang also eligible to do so?

“Apart from passing the third level of the Star Tower, the other condition is for a Universe God in the Second Heaven to pass above the eighteenth level of the Illusionary Mind Sea. As you have passed through the nineteenth level, you are qualified to practice the second secret skill.”

Hall Master Yuan said, “I intended to tell you about it after you finished the battle, but now it’s time to let you know.”

“The preparation time is only ten years. You should get the second secret skill as soon as possible”
