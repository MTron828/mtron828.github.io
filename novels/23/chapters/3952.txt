Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang and Demon Master Chenhuo exchanged casual greetings, but at this moment, he noticed two figures next to him.

“Elder Dark Bone, Ming Yun?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed as he walked forward.

“Blood Sword Master.” Both Elder Dark Bone and Ming Yun were extremely humble.

“You two are here too. Dark Bone, have you also broken through to become a Ruler?” Jian Wushuang looked at Elder Dark Bone and could sense the aura of a Ruler emanating from him.

“To tell you the truth, I have already become a Ruler a long time ago,” Dark Bone said. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“My Dear Heavenly Marquis, Dark Bone has been on my side for a long time. It’s just that no one knows about it,” Daoist Xuan God said.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood.

No wonder Dark Bone had been helping him in the past. It turned out that he was on his side from the beginning.

“After all, the Divine Beginning Realm is our hometown. Although I, Dark Bone, am not very capable, I will not turn a blind eye to the desperate situation of my hometown.” Elder Dark Bone laughed, “As for Ming Yun, he and I are good friends. He came with me this time. Although we can not help much in this battle, we can at least contribute.”

Jian Wushuang nodded.

The great battle was about to begin. The experts of the Divine Beginning Realm were united.

Only in this way could they have a chance of winning the battle with Devil Cloud Star.

At this moment, Ruler Chenyun suddenly sent a message.

“Blood Sword Master, I have bad news.” Ruler Chenyun’s voice was a little low.

“Bad news?” Jian Wushuang frowned. “What happened?”

“Blood Sword Master, when I sent you a message, I told you that the universe boat on Devil Cloud Star stopped for a while when it passed by a Star Field. Before, the Nine Emperor Pavilion did not know why the universe boat stopped there, but now, we have figured it out.” Ruler Chenyun paused, he continued, “Devil Cloud Star’s universe boat stopped in that Star Field because of an expert from that Star Field, Shi Hua Divine Emperor.”

“Shi Hua Divine Emperor?” Jian Wushuang remembered the name.

“That Shi Hua Divine Emperor is a fourth-level Ruler. Although he is only at the elementary level of the fourth-level, he is very famous in many Star Fields nearby. Moreover, he is very familiar with Devil Cloud Star Master and they seem to be on good terms. This time, when Devil Cloud Star passed by the Sea of consciousness of that Star Field, he was invited to come to this Star Field with him,” Ruler Chenyun said.

“What did you say?” Jian Wushuang’s expression immediately changed. “Are you saying that in the universe boat that Devil Cloud Star is currently on, besides Devil Cloud Star Master, there is also a fourth-level Ruler, Shi Hua Divine Emperor?”

“That’s right.” Ruler Chenyun nodded slightly.

“Damn it!” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, but he could not help cursing in his heart.

Devil Cloud Star Master alone was already very difficult to deal with.

Although he had prepared many methods over the years, which gave him some confidence to face Devil Cloud Star Master, he was still not absolutely sure that he could win this battle.

But now, in addition to Devil Cloud Star Master, there was also an Shi Hua Divine Emperor?

They were both fourth-level Rulers. If Shi Hua Divine Emperor made a move, his battle strength could completely influence or even change the entire battle situation.

“Ruler Chenyun, can you confirm the relationship between Devil Cloud Star Master and Shi Hua Divine Emperor? If it comes to a critical moment, will he definitely make a move?” Jian Wushuang asked immediately.

“Of course, I can confirm the relationship between them. They are indeed good friends. Some experts in the surrounding Star Fields have heard about this, but I can’t guarantee that Shi Hua Divine Emperor will not make a move when the battle begins,” said Ruler Chenyun.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed.

Shi Hua Divine Emperor and Devil Cloud Star Master were good friends. Now that they were on the universe boat in Devil Cloud Star, Shi Hua Divine Emperor would most likely attack when the war began if Devil Cloud Star’s side was defeated. In other words, in this war…they had another enemy who had reached the level of a fourth-level master.

It was indeed bad news.

“Fortunately, although Shi Hua is also a fourth-level master, he is not very strong. The three most powerful experts of our camp should be able to fight him easily. The real threat to our camp is Devil Cloud Star Master,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Shi Hua’s arrival was beyond Jian Wushuang’s expectations and brought him some pressure, but it was still within his range.

“Blood Sword Master, the universe boat that Devil Cloud Star is on has arrived in this Star Field. It’s rushing to the Divine Beginning Realm as fast as it can. I think it’ll take at most half a day,” Ruler Chenyun said.

“Half a day?” Jian Wushuang’s expression was cold. “All the experts in the Divine Beginning Realm are ready and are ready to die. Now, we’re just waiting for them to arrive!”

In the void where countless experts gathered, a solemn atmosphere had already gathered.

As the news of the arrival of the Devil Cloud Star army spread, a large number of experts in the void were ready. Countless Principles Masters rose up, they had already formed one huge battle formation after another.

The numerous Principles Masters within the battle formation were also gathering their strength and waiting for the next big battle.

Half a day later, under the gaze of hundreds of thousands of great beings from the Divine Beginning Realm camp, an ancient and incomparably huge universe boat slowly sailed over from the universe void space at the very front.

This universe boat was too big. It was at least ten times bigger than the universe boat that Stone Ruler Spark had obtained back then.

On this ancient universe boat stood countless great beings. In the depths of the universe boat, there was a powerful and even terrifying aura circling.

“The Devil Cloud Star Army has arrived.”

In a nearby universe void space, three figures stood there calmly.

These three figures were the three Pavilion Masters from Nine Emperor Pavilion, and the leader was dark cloud Ruler.

When the three of them saw the enormous universe boat descend and appear in the void space, they were secretly amazed.

“Devil Cloud Star is a level two star world after all. It has countless experts under its command, and there are close to a hundred Rulers. Devil Cloud Star Master previously took over a star world, and now, he has broken through to the level four realm. In addition, he has an existence called Shi Hua Divine Emperor with him. I wonder if the Divine Beginning Realm will be able to withstand such a lineup…”
