Chapter 2914: Could Not Be Stopped

——

“Humph!”

Saint Hong’s divine power burst out.

The dark-gold long stick turned into a dark-gold bolt of lightning and struck out rapidly. In an instant, it collided head-on with the Black Divine Sword.

The Black Divine Sword was still sent flying by the collision, but Saint Hong himself staggered and took three steps back. Each step was heavy and powerful.

“It seems that there is not much difference in strength between them.” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly. Then, under his control, the Black Divine Sword shot out again.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The Black Divine Sword and Saint Hong’s dark golden long staff collided again and again. Each time, Saint Hong had a slight advantage, but it was only a tiny advantage.

Do not forget that the sword formation was controlled by consciousness and soul. Therefore, the recoil from the collision did not affect Jian Wushuang at all. On the contrary, the power of the reincarnation sword formation was directed at Saint Hong’s divine body again. This situation was disadvantageous to Saint Hong.

“Sorry to trouble you.” Saint Hong frowned slightly.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang, who was in the void in front of him, waved his right hand, and a streak of golden light immediately burst out and merged with the surrounding void.

Buzz, buzz, the world shook.

A natural scroll world appeared in the void above.

There were mountains and rivers in the scroll world, and the most eye-catching ones were the nine towering continents.

“Thousand treasures great world, Sword Principle World!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Jian Wushuang shouted in a low voice, and the world began to change in an instant.

They were initially in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, in a huge ancient sect, but they had appeared on a desolate land in the blink of an eye.

There were all kinds of divine swords stuck in the empty land. However, there was no doubt that each of these swords had an extremely powerful aura. There were hundreds of thousands of them.

This was a sword tomb, a giant sword tomb!

Sensing the changes in the surrounding world, Saint Hong’s pupils could not help shrinking.

Immediately, the sword essence emitted by Jian Wushuang became much more powerful with the appearance of the sword tomb. It was even stronger than before!

“Swish!”

The Black Divine Sword shot out again, and its power was much stronger than before.

“The world will be changed. But, in this world, will the strength of cultivators who are good at sword principle be greatly improved?” Saint Hong’s eyes focused. He already knew the function of the sword tomb.

After the appearance of the Sword Principle World, the corner of Jian Wushuang’s mouth curled up, and his body directly floated out!

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The Black Divine Sword formed by the fourth reincarnation sword formation, the world of ice and snow, was still as fast and fierce as before, crazily attacking Saint Hong again and again.

Saint Hong also waved the dark golden long stick in his hand again and again.

But at this moment, a cold and gloomy sword light suddenly appeared in the surrounding void.

This sword light was very weak, but it was extremely fast. As soon as it appeared, it appeared less than a meter away from Saint Hong.

Saint Hong’s pupils constricted. When he collided with the Samsara Sword Formation, his soul power had been staring at Jian Wushuang, so Jian Wushuang’s actions could not be hidden from him. For example, Jian Wushuang’s sudden swordsmanship… he had also noticed it, but the speed of this sword was a little faster than he had expected.

Saint Hong’s figure blurred and quickly brushed past the edge of the sword light.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang was not discouraged. He flicked his right wrist and swung the Blood Mountain Sword. Whoosh! Sword shadows burst out, forming a huge sword net that wrapped around Saint Hong.

Saint Hong held a dark golden long stick in both hands. This time, he swept the sword net with overwhelming divine power and shattered it.

However, the moment the sword net shattered, the Black Divine Sword formed by the reincarnation sword formation appeared in front of him once again.

Upon seeing this Black Divine Sword, Saint Hong’s expression sank.

“The power of this sword isn’t weak. His close combat ability is also powerful. In this world of Sword Dao, even if he were to fight me in close combat, I wouldn’t be able to take too much advantage of him. However, the key point is that he still has the perfect cooperation of the reincarnation sword formation. One is close combat, while the other is long-range. When the two are used together, even if I have the combat power of a true saint, I would only be able to defend against him passively.” Saint Hong felt helpless in his heart.

He was very strong. According to the realm of the Immortal Saint, he had reached the true saint level and had completely mastered the immortal body. He was completely different from Long Xingzi, Chu Yong, and Realm Lord Tian Qu. However, Jian Wushuang, who had used many trump cards to guide the Sword Essence in the Blood Mountain Sword, was as strong as a true saint. Moreover, he was not much weaker than Jian Wushuang.

Most importantly, Jian Wushuang’s close combat ability and the Samsara Sword Formation perfectly complemented each other. As a result, he was helpless and could only passively resist.

“Although I still have my ultimate moves and killer moves, he has an immortal body. So it’s impossible to kill him.” Saint Hong sighed secretly.

He already knew that he could not kill Jian Wushuang.

Because of this, he had hoped that Jian Wushuang could retreat on his own so that he could avoid a big battle.

After Jian Wushuang refused, he wanted to rely on his absolute strength to make Jian Wushuang retreat. However, he did not expect that Jian Wushuang’s real battle strength was not weaker than his and was even slightly more potent than his.

Now, he was forced by Jian Wushuang into a problematic situation.

In such a situation, he could not do anything to Jian Wushuang.

“If he was outside the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, with the protection formation of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, I could easily shut him out. But now, he has entered the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. The protection formation of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion focuses on defense, but its offensive ability is not strong, so it can’t do anything to him. And if I continue to fight with him, there will be no result. On the contrary, if I force him, if he starts a massacre in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, I’m afraid no one can stop him.”

Saint Hong had many thoughts in his mind.

In the end, he had no choice but to compromise.

He had no choice. This was the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s headquarters. Jian Wushuang did not want to make things too difficult for the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, so he did not kill them. However, if he pushed Jian Wushuang to the brink and started killing wantonly, the consequences would be too severe.

“Jian Yi, stop!” Saint Hong said.

Jian Wushuang immediately stopped what he was doing.

“I can’t do anything to you, and I can’t stop you. If you take Xiaofeng away, neither the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion nor I will stop you. But whether you can take her away, in the end, depends on your ability,” Saint Hong said.
