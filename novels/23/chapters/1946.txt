1947 Cultivator?

“So magical!”

“The ancient battlefield is too magical,” Emperor God Xie Xin muttered.

After he had wandered in the ancient battlefield for over twelve thousand years, he knew the place better.

There was no doubt that the ancient battlefield was more precious than the ancient mystery land!

Not only because it was an ancient battlefield, it was much broader and vast than ancient mystery land. There were more opportunities as well. Most importantly, there was no one else wandering in the ancient battlefield.

For instance, the ancient mystery land had opened countless times in the second era, let alone the first era. Countless times of opening and large numbers of experts would search for opportunities each time. Hence, many opportunities had been unearthed.

Those that had yet to be revealed should be hard to obtain by others as well.

However, the ancient battlefield was entirely different. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Boundless opportunities contained were completely on display and there were too many opportunities around.

“It’s a pity that I am weaker in power and my defense power isn’t strong enough. There are many places with great opportunities but I dare not wander. Otherwise, I could achieve even more,” Emperor God Xie Xin clenched his hands.

He was very careful, very cautious.

Once he noticed that something was not right, he would immediately leave. He’d rather not get the opportunity than taking a bigger risk.

Because he was cautious, he had survived for over twelve thousand years.

Otherwise, the ancient battlefield that contained huge dangers would’ve killed him many times.

Emperor God Xie Xin thought. Just then…

“Huh?” Emperor God Xie Xin was surprised.

He suddenly noticed the few auras within his soul power’s sensory range.

“These are… cultivators?”

Emperor God Xie Xin was shocked.

He thought that there was no one who knew the ancient battlefield and there was only him alone who had the advantage.

But then, he noticed other cultivators on the ancient battlefield.

Although the few cultivators were not powerful.

“Let’s take a look first.”

Emperor God Xie Xin squinted his eyes as he moved in the direction of the few cultivators.

In the void, there were four figures flying forward slowly.

There was a mixture of men and women. They looked really young and they were only giving out Universe God auras. The one leading them was a brown-haired young man who was Universe God in the Third Heaven.

“We are reaching Purple Flame Realm soon. Be careful. Remember what master said,” the brown-haired young man urged.

The other three people nodded faintly and there was a tinge of excitement in their eyes.

The four of them were from Green Fire World. They were cultivators that came for training in the ancient battlefield. They were also from the same sect.

Green Fire World then was different from before.

There were many Real Gods and also Universe Gods.

There were so many cultivators who wandered in the surrounding battlefield looking for opportunity. It was naturally much easier to find opportunities on the battlefield.

For instance, on the skull where Green Fire World was located, there was more than half of the territory that Green Fire World had probed and found more mystery land. Purple Flame Realm was one of them.

“Purple Flame Realm has a total of three levels. The danger on the first level is enough to kill many Universe Gods. As for the second levels, it is simply courting death if a Universe God enters. Even when our master enters the second level, he has to be cautious and not reckless. As for the third level…”

“The third level of Purple Flame Realm, in the entire Green Fire World, only the legendary Wushuang City Master could go in. Anyone else, including our masters or even our master’s master, will definitely die once they enter!”

The brown-haired young man looked at the other three Universe Gods, “The four of us can only challenge the first level in Purple Flame Realm at most and we have to be extremely careful. As for the second level, don’t even think about it. Understand?”

“Yes, Senior Qing Hao,” the other three nodded simultaneously.

The four of them were chatting casually but they didn’t know that their conversation was being eavesdropped on by Emperor God Xie Xin who was hidden in the dark.

“Four Universe Gods from the same sect?”

“In their conversation earlier, they brought up about Purple Flame Realm and also Green Fire World?”

Emperor God Xie Xin had creased his eyebrows earlier.

He had heard and he instantly knew that Purple Flame Realm would be a unique place in the surrounding battlefield.

The four Universe Gods should be wandering in Purple Flame Realm.

However, Green Fire World… Emperor God Xie Xin didn’t understand.

“Regardless, I’ll know when I ask.”

Emperor God Xie Xin smirked coldly and immediately walked forward.

The four Universe Gods went in the direction where Purple Flame Realm was, under the brown-haired young man’s lead. But suddenly, Emperor God Xie Xin, who was malicious-looking, blocked their way.

The four Universe Gods immediately stopped and four pairs of eyes fixed upon Emperor God Xie Xin.

“This person…” The brown-haired young man’s eyes dilated in shock. Although Emperor God Xie Xin before him didn’t give out much aura, the brown-haired young man still felt extremely pressured. The pressure was much stronger than when he faced his own master.

The brown-haired young man took a deep breath and immediately bowed, “Greetings Senior, I am junior Qing Hao.”

The brown-haired young man beckoned and bowed at Emperor God Xie Xin.

Immortal Palace was one of the top nine major forces in Green Fire World. They were very famous.

The brown-haired young man, Qing Hao, should be a big figure in Immortal Palace. Theoretically, as long as the other person was experienced in Green Fire World, they should have heard of his name.

However, Emperor God Xie Xin blinked and seemed confused.

He had been in Eternal Chaotic World for so long but he had never heard of a sect named Immortal Palace.

“I have something I’d like to ask you,” Emperor God Xie Xin looked at the four of them in front of him.

“Yes, senior. The four of us will tell you everything we know,” Qing Hao seemed rather calm.

“I heard your conversation earlier and you talked about Green Fire World and also Immortal Palace that you brought up yourself. I wonder if you could tell me in detail?” Emperor God Xie Xin smiled and asked.

“Senior, you don’t know about Green Fire World or Immortal Palace?” Qing Hao stared and his suddenly put his guard up.

The other three disciples from Immortal Palace looked terrified as well.

If the other party didn’t know about Immortal Palace, it might be understandable. After all, Immortal Palace was established after the drastic change in Green Fire World. It had only been less than twenty thousand years. Those who cultivate in seclusion most of the time during the year, it was normal if they didn’t know about them.

However, he didn’t even know about Green Fire World.

Obviously, he wasn’t an expert from Green Fire World.

“Master, Master, I met a mysterious expert on the ancient battlefield. He is from outside Green Fire World!”

Qing Hao didn’t move but he sent a message to his master in secret.
