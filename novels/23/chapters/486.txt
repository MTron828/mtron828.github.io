Chapter 487: Killing Intent

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

It was indeed huge trouble.

As the first Sword Principle magic weapon of killing in the Divine Land, just how many people coveted it?

Among this group of Sword Principle experts alone, nine out of ten were eager to obtain it, except that they did not have the capability to do so. And now, it had recognized Jian Wushuang as its owner right in front of them.

How could they not be jealous and goggle-eyed?

“The strongest among these people are only of superior lord level. This poses no threat to me at present.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“There’s only one person who’s a serious threat to me.”

With chilly eyes, Jian Wushuang looked right over at Su Ming.

The latter was standing upright in the Void in his usual lofty pose. He too looked back at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang could vaguely detect the killing intent welling up in Su Ming’s eyes despite their dull facade.

“Indeed.” He laughed coldly. He was not in the least bit surprised.

Su Ming had suppressed the Heart-killing Sword for over a thousand years, throughout which he held a Sword Principle Meeting every 100 years when the sword was in a state of agitation. Though this seemed to be an act of kindness, the reality was that deep down, Su Ming had long treated the sword as if it was his possession.

Now that it had recognized Jian Wushuang as its owner instead, the real surprise would have been if Su Ming did not want to kill him.

“I’d planned to wait a little longer, when my strength has increased some, before taking him on. But it now seems that things have to be brought ahead.” Jian Wushuang murmured to himself.

Su Ming was a traitor of the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor!

The decline of the bloodline was inextricably linked to Su Ming. As a descendant of the bloodline, it was Jian Wushuang’s duty to clean things up on behalf of his ancestors if he had the strength to.

It was only a matter of time before he challenged Su Ming. Now, the Heart-killing Sword had simply brought things forward by a little.

The crowd of experts too looked at Su Ming in anticipation of his reaction.

However, contrary to everyone’s expectation, Su Ming did not fly into a rage. Instead, keeping his eyes on Jian Wushuang, he calmly asked, “Your Excellency’s methods are truly awesome to have fused three Sword Souls into one. May I know thy name?”

Jian Wushuang first thought about answering “swordsman” when he heard Su Ming’s inquiry, but after thinking for a bit, he replied, “My name is Jian Wushuang!”

“Jian Wushuang?” Su Ming muttered it in repeat. “It literally means to have matchless Sword Principle. You certainly live up to such a fine name.”

“False praise.” Jian Wushuang was unflattered.

“That Heart-killing Sword has remained here in this valley for over a thousand years. I’d tried many ways for it to recognize me as its owner but was never successful. Today, however, it has offered itself to Your Excellency, whose capability certainly puts mine to shame,” Su Ming said.

“It was just luck,” Jian Wushuang replied casually.

“Luck? Maybe.” Su Ming’s lips raised a corner. “But after all, as the first Sword Principle magic weapon in the Divine Land, it has been eyed by many people. Your Excellency must be careful. Don’t get killed so shortly after receiving it, or you mightn’t even get to use it.”

“Thanks so much for the tip, Master Su Ming.” Jian Wushuang coolly acknowledged.

“All the best.” Su Ming laughed callously, then turned and departed.

The Sword Principle experts were astounded by what had they just seen.

“Gone? He left just like that?”

“He didn’t even try to seize back the sword? Is he really willing to let it fall into Jian Wushuang’s hands?”

“Willing? That’s impossible! The entire Divine Land knows that Master Su Ming is crazy over the Heart-killing Sword, or he wouldn’t have spent a good thousand years suppressing it.”

“My view is that Master Su Ming chose not to act here to save face. This is the Sword-suppression Valley after all, and the fact is he’d personally invited Jian Wushuang here.”

“Plus, the sword submitted itself to Jian Wushuang, who neither actively snatched it nor violated any of the valley’s rules. It would be beneath Master Su Ming to tussle for the sword in the valley, and his reputation would be ruined if news spread!”

“Of course, this only holds true in the valley. Things may be different outside.”

The experts chatted freely among themselves. Though they tried to keep their volumes down, Jian Wushuang could clearly hear what they were saying.

In response, he laughed indifferently.

He was certainly aware of the theory that Master Su Ming chose not to act out right here only so as to not tarnish his reputation, but would be unable to restrain himself once outside the valley.

Inhaling a deep breath, Jian Wushuang kept the Heart-Killing Sword in an Interspatial Ring before he slowly walked forward.

“Swordsman.”

Hunjian Lord and Tianming Lord were both looking at Jian Wushuang with somewhat complicated expressions.

“The two of you may leave first,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Sorry, Swordsman. The two of us are of little help,” Hunjian Lord said with some bitterness.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded with genuine empathy.

The person he needed to face this time was Su Ming, against whom even their leader Marquis Piaoxue, let alone them, was of no match.

He walked up to Jian Nantian once again.

The latter carried a flask of wine in his hand and was busy drinking to himself. His face was its usual indifference, and he only looked around when he saw Jian Wushuang coming toward him. “I’d thought I’d caused enough trouble during my time, but it has turned out to be a lot less than what you’ve done.”

“Father, stop teasing me.” Jian Wushuang laughed mildly.

“Su Ming will certainly not let you off for taking the Heart-killing Sword. I fear that he’ll try to murder you upon the very first step you take out of Sword-suppression Valley. Say, what are your plans?” Jian Nantian uttered in a deep voice.

“What else can I do but take such measures as the situation calls for? The sword has already recognized me as its owner, and I surely cannot return it to him. Besides, it was originally the Sword Ancestor’s magic weapon. Su Ming doesn’t deserve to have it,” Jian Wushuang responded.

Of course, although he claimed he would simply take such measures as the situation called for, he did have a few plans deep down.

At the very least, he had a life-saving trump card in his hand.

“You do seem to have quite the open mind.” Jian Nantian glanced at his son and lowered his voice before continuing, “I’ve already sent word for a helper to come forth. He’ll need some time to get here, however. You just have to find a way to delay things a little.”

“A helper?” Jian Wushuang looked in puzzlement at his father.

He was going to be acted upon by none other than one of the Nine Sovereigns, Su Ming. What kind of helper would be able to stop such a person?

“Don’t worry. The helper whom I asked for is very powerful and should have no problems stopping Su Ming.” Jian Nantian laughed easily.

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help lifting his eyebrows.

He might not have to resort to his final trump card if the helper was truly that capable.

Incidentally, he did not really want to use that card.
