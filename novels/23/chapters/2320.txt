2321 Execution!

From the beginning, although Yan Que had made his move as well, he had only suppressed Lin Yi with his Demonic Dragon.

But as a genuine Half Step Divine Demon that had already understood some Rules of Order, he had more up his sleeve.

Finally, Yan Que was giving it his all.

“Little Wushuang, watch out. Half Step Divine Demon experts are strong,” Lin Yi reminded him.

Lin Yi had some grudges.

Why couldn’t Jian Wushuang simply agree to Yan Que’s request?

From Lin Yi’s perspective, many geniuses are rushing to join big sects like the Water Fairy Island, but Jian Wushuang had discarded the opportunity.

During such a crisis.

If he had agreed, there would have been no more trouble.

But now, they had to go against a Half Step Divine Demon expert giving his all.

“We can only hope that the Lin clan experts reach us in time,” Lin Yi clenched his fists.

He had already transmitted for help when they were intercepted, but reinforcements needed time to arrive.

“A Half Step Divine Demon is indeed strong, but with my own powers, and the help from Little Wushuang, we should be able to hold on,” Lin Yi thought.

But at that moment, Jian Wushuang looked at Lin Yi. “Uncle Lin Yi, I cannot handle a Half Step Divine Demon, I’ll leave it to you.”

“Leave it to me?” Lin Yi was stunned and thought, “If you knew you couldn’t handle him, why were you so arrogant?”

Jian Wushuang naturally knew what Lin Yi was thinking, and smiled. “Don’t worry. Is only a Half Step Divine Demon. With your abilities, you can kill him easily.”

“I...” Lin Yi was even more furious.

Killing a Half Step Divine Demon? Easy?

What a joke.

Jian Wushuang whispered something. “Uncle Lin Yi, listen to me, just demonstrate your deadliest sword move.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Hmm?” Lin Yi looked at Jian Wushuang, confused, unaware of his motives.

He only wanted to tangle with Yan Que for a while longer while reinforcements came. He needed to preserve Divine Power.

But Jian Wushuang wanted him to use his strongest sword move?

He had his doubts, but he made a decision and chose to listen to Jian Wushuang.

“Let’s try it then. If I can’t fight it I can still escape, and it is Jian Wushuang that will die.” Lin Yi hesitated no more.

Weng!

A powerful sword essence swept the area as the shapeless sword essence formed a huge sword essence storm.

Lin Yi was at the centre of that storm, turning into a sharp sword himself.

The swordsmanship had not been performed yet, but the sword momentum was there.

Lin Yi squinted his eyes as he looked extremely cold. The Void around him turned chilly.

“Such a great sword essence, it’ll be strong,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He could feel that Lin Yi’s sword move was going to be extraordinary, and thus he made preparations as well.

Jian Wushuang did not move, and nor did his Blood Mountain Sword, but in his mind, a great Soul Power was precipitating.

After reincarnation, even though Jian Wushuang had had to re-train his cultivation base, his soul was intact.

His soul was not damaged, and its power was still at Chaotic Realm pinnacle levels, perhaps even Half Step Divine Demon.

As long as his cultivation base was restored to Chaotic Divine Demon levels, his Soul Power would ascend accordingly.

Half Step Divine Demon’s Soul Power was being mobilised by Jian Wushuang.

In the Void, Lin Yi’s sword was finally formed and charged.

A bright sword light could be seen, so glaring and dazzling people could not help but close their eyes.

The move was so powerful it could have split the earth.

After it left Lin Yi’s hand, the sword cut through the Void and appeared in front of Yan Que.

The huge sword essence storm followed the sword light as well.

It was a powerful sword.

From Jian Wushuang’s perception, it was as strong as a Half Step Divine Demon’s full blow.

It should have been easy to kill Peak Chaotic Realm experts, but not Half Step Divine Demons directly.

At least to Lin Yi, his direct blow could not do much.

Yan Que laughed in disdain as he saw Jian Wushuang make his move as well.

“A firefly like you dares to contend with the light of the sun?” Yan Que said coldly, and released his Divine Power, preparing to destroy Lin Yi’s sword.

But at that moment, Jian Wushuang in the Void had a sudden murderous intent in his eyes.

“Soul Secret Skill, Three Divine Lights!”

Xiu!

A golden beam completely precipitated from Soul Power and rushed over at an incredible speed.

The golden beam was murky – no one could have spotted it if one did not look closely.

It was demonstrated slower than Lin Yi’s sword, but before the sword struck, the murky sword light had already struck Yan Que.

The Soul Power within that golden beam struck Yan Que’s soul directly.

Yan Que was a Half Step Divine Demon with strong Soul Power, but without any precautions, his soul was deeply hurt as well.

“Ah!”

A painful scream was let out by Yan Que as the Divine Power he had gathered now dissipated. Yan Que’s eyes were in a frenzy, hands over his head. It was obvious that the person was in great pain.

Yan Que was no longer able to dodge Lin Yi’s sword light.

Hong!

The terrifying sword light struck Yan Que’s holy body without obstruction.

Yan Que was a Half Step Divine Demon, but without demonstrating any ways to block it, it was impossible to block such a terrifying sword directly.

Yan Que’s holy body blasted open and started collapsing.

After a moment, the Half Step Divine Demon from Water Fairy Island was dead!
