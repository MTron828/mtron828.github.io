Chapter 1741: The Fourth Wave Of Attack!!!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Not good!”

“How is this possible?”

The remaining four Sir Gods were extremely terrified and they no longer had a relaxed expression like before.

It should be known that they had even used the trump card Killing Formation of Nine Cuts that they had prepared. However, in the end… Jian Wushuang had killed Mo Ying in the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts.

“How can this happen? How can he disregard the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts and kill Mo Ying?”

“What kind of technique is this?”

The four Sir Gods were filled with doubt.

However, they did not know that the Moon Picking Skill that Jian Wushuang had used was the strongest Secret Skill of the Ancient God Clan and it was a really a very remarkable ability.

This Secret Skill made use of the power of the universe, space and time. Moreover, no matter where it was, as long as space and time existed in the piece of void, Jian Wushuang could use it.

The Killing Formation of Nine Cuts could indeed block all kinds of attacks. However, these attacks were merely material-based attacks.

As for the Moon Picking Skill, which was a Secret Skill which made use of the universe, space and time, the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts was totally unable to block it.

With the death of Mo Ying, the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts had collapsed and the Devil Nine Cuts with a great amount of murderous intent and power had dissipated at once.

Jian Wushuang glowed with murderous intent.

“Die!”

With a shrill cry, the two Hong Jun Golden Swords which Jian Wushuang controlled turned into two shooting stars and moved with frightening speed. They then pierced the void and headed to the four Sir Gods with lightning speed.

Upon seeing that, the four Sir Gods revealed terrified expressions in succession.

Even the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts had been broken through. As such, the fighting capabilities of Jian Wushuang, who had gone all-out, were not something that the four of them could stop.

“Run!”

Without hesitation, the four Sir Gods started to escape.

After all, they were all Sir God experts. Moreover, they were considered outstanding among the Sir Gods. If the four of them really wanted to escape, it would be difficult for Jian Wushuang to get all of them to stay.

Even though it was not possible to get the four Sir Gods to stay, there was one person that Jian Wushuang absolutely had to keep.

This person was Lei Chao!

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang’s body moved crazily and his dark golden eyes stared persistently at Lei Chao, who was standing in the void. At that time, Lei Chao did not have a fearful expression at all.

Since his soul had been controlled, he did not have his own consciousness since a long time ago. Hence, he was no different from being dead.

“Lei Chao!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Jian Wushuang clenched both his fists tightly and grief flashed in his heart. However, even more determination flashed in his heart.

“I will definitely avenge you. Please leave peacefully.”

Jian Wushuang spoke softly and pointed out one of his fingers from his right hand. A flittering light shot out and its speed was so fast that it was not an attack that Lei Chao could dodge.

Moreover, Lei Chao did not dodge at all. The flittering light pierced through the space between Lei Chao’s eyebrows and took his life.

Jian Wushuang appeared beside Lei Chao. With a swing of his hands, he put Lei Chao’s lifeless body into his Qian Kun Ring.

After finishing that, Jian Wushuang sighed deeply and his heart felt extremely heavy.

As Lei Chao’s consciousness had been controlled, he was as good as dead.

If he were to continue living like a puppet, it would be a humiliation and torture to him. As such, after knowing that, Jian Wushuang had made up his mind a long time ago to free Lei Chao!

“Acheron Palace!” Jian Wushuang clenched both his fists tightly and his eyes were filled with an infinite amount of murderous intent and fury.

“Jian Wushuang, the world has always been cruel. Please try to get over this. Moreover, now is not the time for you to grieve,” the King of Venomous Worms’ voice echoed in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

“I know,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head and his eyes were icy-cold.

The King of Venomous Worms was right. The current moment was not the time for him to grieve.

Because he himself could be killed by someone at any time.

“The Acheron Palace’s way of doing things has always been very secretive and they will not take action easily. However, the moment they take action, they will definitely have absolute confidence.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes squinted, “However, what I have come across so far is unable to force me into a hopeless situation. The Acheron Palace has definitely arranged for something else.”

Since entering the dark storm, Jian Wushuang had encountered three waves of danger.

The first wave was the assassination attempt by the ugly-looking woman at the start. The assassination was extremely frightening and Jian Wushuang was almost killed.

The second wave came from Lei Chao where he tossed two God Destroying Pearls abruptly. Fortunately, Jian Wushuang had always been careful and he was prepared for it. If not, he would have ended up in an extremely miserable state.

As for the third wave, it was the five Sir Gods attacking at the same time and they even had used the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts.

These three waves of danger were extremely perilous and they had indeed forced Jian Wushuang to go all-out by making him unleash many of his trump cards and techniques.

However, such an extent was still not considered perfectly safe.

Hence, Jian Wushuang could confirm that the Acheron Palace still had the fourth wave of attack!

The fourth wave of attack would be even more dangerous than the three waves of attacks from before.

“What will the fourth wave of attack be?” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

In no time, he knew about it.

Jian Wushuang was still standing at the battlefield from before, which was inside the dark storm. As for the four Sir Gods who deployed the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts to kill him, they had escaped originally. However, at that time, they headed toward Jian Wushuang again.

Moreover, it was not just the four of them. At the center of the four of them, there was a shadow which was covered by a crimson robe.

Under the escort of the four Sir Gods, the crimson-robed man walked out slowly and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang openly. After that, he stopped moving.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang’s expression became unusually ugly.

“An Emperor God!”

“An Emperor God expert!”

The corners of Jian Wushuang’s mouth were a bit distorted and he could not help but exclaim in admiration. As expected of the Acheron Palace.

They would not take action easily. However, if they were to take action, they would definitely not fail. This rumor was really true.

After sending five Sir Gods to team up and deploy the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts, it was still not enough. They had actually secretly arranged for another Emperor God!

It was an Emperor God!

It was the level of the Star Palace Master as well as King Luo Zhen who was an Eight-star Ancient God.

Although there seemed to be only one step between an Emperor God and a Sir God, the gap between them was not smaller than the gap between a Real God and Sir God.

For example, the Devil Nine Cuts from before, which was only just created with five Sir Gods teaming up under the aid of the Killing Formation of Nine Cuts, possessed the fighting capabilities of an Emperor God.

However, the Devil Nine Cuts had only achieved the level of an Emperor God in terms of strength, power and other areas. However, when comparing close-quarters techniques, trump cards and Secret Skills, it was completely incomparable to an actual Emperor God.

However, even though that was the case, it was still not something that Jian Wushuang could fight with. He could only rely on his own close-quarters’ combat abilities to deal with the Devil Nine Cuts. After that, he had found an opportunity to kill Mo Ying, who had deployed the formation. With that, the Devil Nine Cuts had dissipated by itself.

As for a real Emperor God expert, he was many times stronger than the Devil Nine Cuts.

Moreover, the Emperor God in front of him did not look normal.

“Looks like this time around, it will not be as simple as just going all-out.”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and with a flip of his palm, a picture scroll appeared in his hands.

As Jian Wushuang tossed the picture scroll into the void, the big universe started to undergo changes right away.
