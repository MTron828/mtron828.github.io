1937 Recommendation

In the blink of an eye, a year flew past.

In the past one year, Jian Wushuang and the troop hadn’t come across any hindrance and the people from Soul Snatching Palace hadn’t barged in either.

In the dark void, the ancient silver spaceship continued to travel forward.

On the deck of the silver spaceship, a purple-haired youth wielded a saber.

Kuang! Kuang! Kuang! Kuang!

There were saber lights that swung out from his hand continuously.

The saber lights were extremely brilliant and they brought along boundless hatred. Every single stroke contained extreme hatred!

“Die! Die! Die!”

The purple-haired youth had billowing murderous intention. The saber skills that he performed were definitely massacre-worthy.

It brought about billowing hatred that would stop at nothing.

Just as he was performing a saber skill, the entire void was engulfed in utter murderous intention and hatred.

His saber skills were ferocious!

The realm was shocking!

“The young man named Luo Tianhong is pretty good.”

In the cabin, King of Venomous Worms commented casually.

“Mm, he’s not bad,” Jian Wushaung nodded faintly as well.

For the past one year, although he hadn’t spoken much with Luo Tianhong, he had seen the hard work that he had put in for the past one year.

Different to the other disciples of Luo royal family, Luo Tianhong took painstaking efforts to cultivate and constantly developed his saber skills and improve his power.

At any time, he would be thinking about improving his power and taking revenge!

“Using boundless hatred as motivation, just like when I was young,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Plus, what shocked Jian Wushuang was that not only was Luo Tianhong hardworking, he was also extremely talented.

Not only was his talent displayed with saber skills, it was also shown in his comprehension level.

“A Universe God in the Third Heaven and he should have just passed the third God’s test not too long ago, but he is already at the beginner level of Massacre Doctrine and his comprehension is ridiculously high. He has already reached the second level of Doctrine Palace,” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

The second level of Doctrine Palace. Even among the top ten in Universe God ranking list, there were very few who achieved that.

Luo Tianhong’s talent was much stronger than many geniuses that Jian Wushuang had met before.

Jian Wushuang, even though his lineal disciple, He Xin, was slightly weaker than him in terms of comprehension.

“It’s a pity that Luo Tianhong isn’t good at swords. Otherwise, maybe you could take him in as a disciple,” Jian Yi looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Disciple?” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

If it wasn’t necessary or he didn’t truly favor one, he wouldn’t take on a disciple easily.

Although Luo Tian Hong was talented and he might even be more talented than He Xiu, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t take him as his disciples even if he was good at swords.

“Although I wouldn’t take him on as my disciple, I could recommend him to a good master,” Jian Wushuang flashed a strange smile. Then, he took out a communication token, “Duan Lingfeng, long time no see. How have you been?”

“Oh, the infamous Sword Emperor? What reminds you of me?” Duan Lingfeng replied very soon and he made fun in his reply. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Haha, b*stard…” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Duan Lingfeng was Jian Wushuang’s best friend, a brother that was hard to come by.

Back in Real God Wu Bei’s cave dwelling, Duan Lingfeng and he had gone through trials and tribulations together. Plus, their powers were similar then and they were known as the top experts.

The two of them were best friends, also an opponent that was hard to come by.

They had been competing with one another all this while.

However, ever since Jian Wushuang had broken through and become a Real God, his power had instantly increased tremendously because of the advantage of being an inverse cultivator. Naturally, Duan Lingfeng was left far behind him. Then, Jian Wushuang was already at the top of Eternal Chaotic World.

The seventeenth place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, right below the Great Emperors and Underworld God.

Such power wasn’t one that Duan Lingfeng could compare to favorably. After all, Duan Lingfeng had yet to break through and become an Almighty.

However, although he didn’t become an Almighty, Duan Lingdeng had already broken through to Chaotic Real God level. With his gifted talent and saber skills, he was listed as the first place in Real God ranking list and there was no other arguable match. That itself was impressive.

“Duan Lingfeng, I found you a great disciple. Would you like to come and see?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Disciple?” Duan Lingfeng shook his head directly, “My goal now is to break through soon and become an Almighty, to stand side by side with you. I am not in the mood to take in any disciple.”

“Don’t refuse so soon. Come here and take a look at him. Maybe he’s suitable for you?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Alright. Where are you now? I’ll come over now,” Duan Lingfeng said.

“I’ll arrive at Holy Kingdom of South Plume soon. Hurry up,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Don’t worry. I’ll take a spacetime wormhole. I’ll arrive in ten years’ time,” Duan Lingfeng said.

After he talked to Duan Lingfeng, Jian Wushuang lifted the corners of his lips and revealed an interesting smile.

The purple-haired youth, Luo Tianhong, was extremely talented from Jian Wushuang’s point of view. Plus, he was good at saber skills and his talent with Massacre Doctrine was unbelievably high.

As for Duan Lingfeng, he happened to be good at saber and had comprehended Massacre Doctrine as well.

In addition to Luo Tianhong’s hard-working character and his temperament, Jian Wushuang believed that Duan Lingfeng should appreciate him too. If he were to miss the disciple, it might be difficult to find such outstanding disciple in the future.

Suddenly…

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang suddenly moved and he immediately revealed a playful mocking smile, “They’re finally here?”

…

Right before the spaceship that Jian Wushuang and his troops were in, there were dozens of figures standing there in silence.

The dozens of figures were all in black robes and their aura were fierce. There were more than ten Real Gods.

“The remaining members of Luo royal family is in front?” A redheaded elderly squinted his eyes and he looked, “Hehe, these rats are good at running. But no matter how they run, it’ll be useless. There’s a unique mark that I left on their bodies which they don’t know about.”

“From today onwards, Luo royal family will finally be wiped out.”

Next to the redheaded elder, there were a few figures in black ferocious masks.

The few of them with masks had a cold aura and there were faint massacre auras spreading from their bodies.

Hearing what the redheaded elder said, the leader of the masked men said coldly, “Don’t be too confident. Ever since the remaining members of Luo royal members fled, we have been after then for tens of years and attacked them multiple times but we couldn’t wipe them out. I hope there won’t be anyone who escapes this time.”

“Hehe, don’t worry. Previously, there were too many of them. The moment the massacre happens, they will flee in all directions. It is inevitable to have a few escape. However, it is different this time. Luo royal family only has a dozen of them left. There is definitely no possibility of escaping,” the redheaded elder insisted.

“Save the bullshit and attack!” The masked man said in a deep voice.
