Chapter 1522: Zi Dongwang Who Was Unwilling To Accept Defeat

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

On the second level of Wu Bei’s cave.

Zi Dongwang stood side by side with Zin Zhu. As for Universe God Liu Ying, he wasn’t in the same troop as Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu originally. Hence, after fighting a battle against Jian Wushuang, he left on his own.

“Zi Dongwang, did you know you would be defeated by the white-robed swordsman?” Xin Zhu asked with his eyebrows tightly knitted.

“He has the upper hand just by a slight bit. To really defeat me, he doesn’t have the ability!” Zi Dongwang bellowed.

Xin Zhu raised his eyebrows but didn’t comment further. However, he sneered in his head.

Regardless of if Zi Dongwang was willing to admit it, he wasn’t the white-robed swordman’s match. That was a fact. If the new Universe God ranking list were to be released, the white-robed swordman’s ranking would definitely be before Zi Dongwang’s.

“Humph, this won’t end so easily,” Zi Dongwang harumped coldly.

“What are you planning to do?” Xin Zhu looked at him.

“Isn’t the white-robed swordsman strong? I can do nothing about him, but someone else can. When I was fighting against him, I left a tracing mark on him. He can’t escape so easily!” There was a gleam of light in Zi Dongwang’s eyes. The very next moment, he plunged towards the void on the other side.

Although Xin Zhu was confused, he followed anyway.

The fight for the White Blaze Fruits continued.

Occasionally, there’d be births of White Blaze Fruits. There were only two pieces to three pieces at one goal, not like the previous time when eight White Blaze Fruits had come to the world at the same time.

Even so, the massacre was still mad and there were more deaths that followed.

In the blink of an eye, a few days passed .

The fifty pieces of White Blaze Fruits on the second level of the save came to the world and they had their respective owners too.

Vroom. In the void, Real God Wu Bei’s blurry image, which was formed by his consciousness, reappeared.

“The fight for White Blaze Fruits on the second level of the cave has already ended, I will give you another one month’s time. A month later, the third level will be opened!”

“On the third level, which is also the last level, there isn’t any White Blaze Fruit but… there’s a White Blaze Fruit Tree!”

Then, the blurry image that had been formed by Real God Wu Bei’s consciousness vanished into thin air again.

In the lofty palace in the cave, there was a great commotion.

“As expected, there is really a third level!”

“This mad man… He saved the White Blaze Fruit Tree for the last level?”

“White Blaze Fruit Tree, that is the most precious thing in the cave. Those White Blaze Fruits were just fruits that were grown on the White Blaze Fruit Tree.”

Various experts, including Almighties were all hot with excitement.

White Blaze Fruit made various Almighties drool, but a White Blaze Fruit tree made all the Almighties go insane.

Many years ago, many Almighties had gotten into a crazy fight and bloody massacre to get the saplings of the White Blaze Fruit Tree. However, it fell into the hands of Real God Wu Bei in the end.

But it was a mature White Blaze Fruit Tree this time and it was even more precious.

One month…

The Universe Gods in the cave started preparing themselves.

The air was filled with the atmosphere of massacre. The chilliness in the void was bone-piercing. A scrawny, pale-looking young man who looked like a sickly person walked forward slowly.

His appearance was extremely frail but when he walked and passed by the countless Universe Gods, whoever saw him wanted to immediately run away without hesitation in shock.

No one dared to be within a thousand mile range of him, let alone block his way or challenge to for a fight.

Ever since the young man had come to Wu Bei’s cave. He almost never took action but he had got three White Blaze Fruits.

Just then…

“Huh?” The pale young man lifted his head.

In the void before him, there were two figures charging towards him. Very soon, they stopped before him.

The two figures that descended were Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu. However, Zi Dongwang, who normally assumed a haughty air, looked rather humble. The way he looked at the young man seemed to have a tinge of reverence too.

“God Destroying King, long time no see,” Zi Dongwang greeted.

“God Destroying King,” Xin Zhu greeted too.

God Destroying King!

The young man who looked pale and extremely frail was the one in the first place on Universe God ranking list, God Destroying King!

He was the number one among Universe Gods without a doubt in Eternal Chaotic World.

“Zi Dongwang, Xin Zhu, what’s up?” God Destroying King glanced at both of them.

“Something’s up,” Zi Dongwang replied, “I know that you came to Wu Bei’s cave because of the Almighty behind incited you to, and the Almighty promised you something too on the premise that you would get sufficient White Blaze Fruits. But you only have three White Blaze Fruits on hand. It should have yet to reach the criteria that the Almighty requested, right?”

“True,” God Destroying King nodded, “However, as long as I can get the White Blaze Fruit Tree on the third level, it’ll do.”

“White Blaze Fruit Tree?” Zi Dongwang smiled faintly, “There’s only one White Blaze Fruit Tree but there are so many Universe Gods who want to fight for it. God Destroying King, although you are powerful and you are the number one among all Universe Gods, the other Universe Gods will not be passive. Most likely, the Universe Gods will join forces to force you out. Hence, the possibility of you getting the White Blaze Fruit Tree, in the end, isn’t high either.”

“Don’t beat around the bush. Get straight to the point,” God Destroying King’s gaze was cold.

“Let me be frank with you then. I’d like to invite you to join forces with the two of us to fight against Jian Wushuang and the white-robed swordsman. You only need to kill the white-robed swordsman. If you really can’t kill him, just tie him down. As for Jian Wushuang, Xin Zhu and I will take care of him. Jian Wushuang has a total of nine White Blaze Fruits to hand,” Zi Dongwang said.

“You lost to the white-robed swordsman and you want to get rid of him with my hands?” God Destroying King glanced at Zi Dongwang.

Zi Dongwan’s gaze faltered but he didn’t deny it.

He had the intention of killing Duan Lingfeng.

He was arrogant and boastful. He had no choice before God Destroying King. He could only submit to him.

But besides God Destroying King, he wasn’t willing to accept that there was another Universe God who was stronger than him.

“Nine White Blaze Fruits… I want five of them,” God Destroying King said straightforwardly.

“Five pieces?” Zi Dongwang’s facial expression changed but he nodded anyway, “Deal.” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Do you know Jian Wushuang and the white-robed swordsman’s current location?” God Destroying King asked.

“Of course I know. We can get there in one day with our traveling speed,” Zi Dongwang replied.

“If so, let’s depart,” God Destroying King sounded cool.

Very soon, the strongest formation, made up of God Destroying King, Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu, was charging in the direction where Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng were at.

However, Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng had no idea about it.

Duan Lingfeng knew that Zi Dongwang left a tracing mark on him and he started to remove it but he still needed more time.

As for Jian Wushuang, he was at his most critical period.
