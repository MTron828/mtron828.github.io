Looking at the Saint Ascension Elixir in front of her, Yin Su’er’s eyes immediately became extremely hot.

“I promised Saint Crimson Rock that I would try my best to help you breakthrough, and this Saint Ascension Elixir is the limit of what I can do. As for whether you can really break through to the Immortal Saint Realm after obtaining the Saint Ascension Elixir, it depends on your own luck and luck. It has nothing to do with me,” Jian Wushuang said, then he waved his hand and threw the elixir to Yin Su’er.

Yin Su’er took the elixir, but her mind was in a daze.

“Mr. Sword One, are you sure you want to give this elixir to me?” Yin Su’er was in disbelief.

The Saint Ascension Elixir was such a precious treasure!

She believed that if the news of the Saint Ascension Elixir spread, the entire Golden Crow Nine Realms would be shocked. Countless top-tier Great Divine Masters, including a few Invincible Divine Masters, would immediately rush to Pill Sun Sacred World to fight for it.. The elixir was of great use to the Great Divine Master.

But Jian Wushuang gave such a precious elixir to her?

After all, Jian Wushuang was only a Great Divine Master now. He would try to break through to the Immortal Saint realm sooner or later. The elixir would be of great use to him, right? Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Mr. Sword One, don’t you need the Saint Ascension Elixir in the future?” Yin Su’er could not help asking.

“My situation is a bit special, so the elixir won’t help me much. Besides, if I meet the requirements to become an Immortal Saint, I can easily make a breakthrough even without the elixir,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

What he said was the truth.

His potential was too great, far beyond Yin Su’er’s imagination.

Previously, he had relied on the elixir and primordial stone to improve his realm. As long as he had enough divine power, he could easily make a breakthrough without any obstacles. The reason why he could do this was that he had too much potential.

As long as he met the conditions, he could easily break through his level.

If it were other experts, even if all the conditions had been met, there would still be some twists and turns in breaking through. Some might even encounter bottlenecks, but Jian Wushuang did not.

He did not know how to break through from the divine master level to the Immortal Saint level, nor did he know how to break through from the Great Divine Master level to the Immortal Saint level.

In addition to the uniqueness of the perfect chaotic creature, he really did not need it.

“In that case, I’ll take it. Thank you, Mr. Sword One,” Yin Su’er said gratefully.

“You’re welcome. After all, your father, Saint Crimson Rock, has already paid you.” Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Oh, there’s one more thing I need to tell you.”

“What is it?” Yin Su’er asked.

“You’re the ruler of Crimson Rock Castle. You should be more aware of the situation in the Pill Sun Sacred World than I am. Although Crimson Rock Castle has regained control of the Pill Sun Sacred World, there is still a special existence in the Pill Sun Sacred World, which is the Sword Alliance...” Jian Wushuang said.

Hearing this, Yin Su’er’s expression changed slightly.

She already knew what Jian Wushuang wanted to say.

That was the position of the Sword Alliance.

The Sword Alliance had been an ally of Crimson Rock Castle until now. It could even be said that Crimson Rock Castle had relied on something to a great extent. By relying on Jian Wushuang, the prestige of the Sword Alliance had surpassed that of Crimson Rock Castle to a certain extent.

Especially in the battle with the Heavenly Void World, it was Jian Wushuang who had turned the tables.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang’s personal strength and the strength of the corpse puppet army under his control had been proven.

As for the position of the Sword Alliance, which controlled such a powerful force, in the Pill Sun Sacred World, was it to stand on equal footing with Crimson Rock Castle and share the Pill Sun Sacred World, or would the Sword Alliance be willing to live under Crimson Rock Castle, or... it was possible for Jian Wushuang to directly step forward and replace the Crimson Rock Castle.

It could be said that the current situation of the Pill Sun Sacred World and the survival of the Crimson Rock Castle were actually in Jian Wushuang’s hands. It was up to him to decide.

Yin Su’er also knew this, so she had always been very humble to Jian Wushuang and never took the initiative to expose this matter. After all, the red stone castle was in a weak position, and once it was exposed, the risks it had to take... Yin Su’er could not afford it.

But now, Jian Wushuang took the initiative to talk about this matter.

“The Sword Alliance is too special in the Pill Sun Sacred World. Many forces and countless experts are watching our Sword Alliance. Although I have restricted the experts under the Sword Alliance so that they can not expand, there is no room for two tigers on a mountain. If this continues, there will be trouble sooner or later. I believe that the experts in your Crimson Rock Castle are also wary of our Sword Alliance, right?” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes, there is.” Yin Su’er nodded slightly. “There are a few experts in Crimson Rock Castle who have warned me about the Sword Alliance many times. They even suggested sending some experts to infiltrate the Sword Alliance. However, I rejected them. I completely believe in you, Mr. Sword One.”

“Completely?” Jian Wushuang looked at Yin Su’er with interest and then smiled. “Well, actually, I’m not interested in creating a powerful force in the Pill Sun Sacred World or the Nine Realms Golden Crow Worlds. My ambition is far beyond the Nine Realms Golden Crow Worlds. As soon as I’m strong enough, I’ll leave here and go to a more vast place.

“As for the Sword Alliance, I created it to help you as much as possible. I had good intentions, but I didn’t expect that the situation would stabilize and become a threat to Crimson Rock Castle. Now, many people in the Sword Alliance also want to destroy Crimson Rock Castle and replace it.”

Yin Su’er was shocked.

“Don’t worry, I’ve suppressed these people for the time being. As long as I stay in the Golden Crow Nine Realms, no one in the Sword Alliance will dare to disobey my orders. But if I leave the Golden Crow Nine Realms and go somewhere else, it might not be the case,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile, “So, I need you to give me some time.”

“Time?” Yin Su’er was puzzled.

“I need some time, but I don’t know how long it will take. At least a few decades, at most a hundred years. I will continue to stay in the Golden Crow Nine Realms for these years, and I will find a new territory for the Sword Alliance. By that time, the Sword Alliance will go to that territory, and naturally, there will be no friction with Crimson Rock Castle.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“But are the experts of the Sword Alliance willing to go there?” Yin Su’er asked with a frown.

“If it’s the same size, most of the experts of the Sword Alliance wouldn’t want to go there. But what if it’s very big?” Jian Wushuang said with a strange smile.
