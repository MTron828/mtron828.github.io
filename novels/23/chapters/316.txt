Kicked out?

Jian Wushuang was startled.

21 large prefectures, 21 Mansion Masters with great strength. As for the Lord of Ditian Prefecture, Jian Wushuang knew he was indeed a super expert who ranked third on the Bloodmoon List.

Even though Tan Feng had mastered a Second stage Domain, he only ranked ninth on the Bloodmoon List. So, the Lord of Ditian Prefecture, who ranked third, was definitely much stronger.

Jian Wushuang deduced that the Lord of Ditian Prefecture was likely to have reached the pinnacle of the Origin he comprehended.

“As long as I’m alive, Holy Emperor Palace will spare no effort to kill me. Although I am quite powerful, I’m still not strong enough to protect myself. But the Wrath of Gale and Thunder is of great use, so I want to learn it.”?Jian Wushuang looked dignified. “It seems that I must visit the Lord of Ditian Prefecture in person.”

“Are you going to visit the Lord of Ditian Prefecture?” Hei Lin asked in a surprise.

“Can’t I? ” Jian Wushuang asked indifferently.

“It’s nothing. But it is said that the Lord of Ditian Prefecture has an odd temper. Be careful when you meet him, Mansion Master,” Hei Lin said.

“An odd temper?” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly, showing that he did not care.

The next day, Jian Wushuang left for Ditian Prefecture.

...

Ditian Prefecture was one of the 21 large prefectures, but it had an extremely high status among them.

the Lord of Ditian Prefecture was recognized as a super expert who ranked top three in the whole Tang Dynasty, which caused other experts?to revere him.

Dressed in a bloody robe and wearing a wicked bloody mask, Jian Wushuang appeared in the air above the Ditian Prefecture.

“Stop.” Several shadows appeared in succession above the Ditian Prefecture, headed by a young man with bloody hair.

“Would you please tell your lord that Nan has come to visit him?” said Jian Wushuang.

“Nan? The one ranked ninth on the Bloodmoon List, who killed Tan Feng and took his place as the Ninth Heaven Mansion.” The young man with bloody hair was shocked.

News that Jian Wushuang killed Tan Feng and became the new Ninth Heaven Mansion Master had already spread throughout the Tang Dynasty. His new rank was updated on the Bloodmoon List. So it was only natural that the guards in the Ditian Prefecture knew about it.

“Please wait a moment, Sir. I will inform the Mansion Master right away.” The young man with bloody hair slightly saluted him and went to deliver the message.

A few moments later.

“Sire, come in and have a talk.” A vigorous and forceful voice was heard coming from the mission.

Jian Wushuang smiled and strode forward without any hindrance from the guards. Jian Wushuang quickly made his way to the meeting hall.

In the main position of the hall, a white-haired elder stood calmly with his arms folded. He stood there like a sculpture, motionless and with no breath.

a light flashed through Jian Wushuang’s eyes as soon as he entered the hall and saw the back of this white-haired elder. It reminded him of someone he had seen before.

At that moment, the sculpture-like white-haired elder began to move and turned around.

Once Jian Wushuang was able to see the real appearance of the white-haired elder, his eyes suddenly widened in astonishment.

“Senior, is it you?” Jian Wushuang asked with a hint of surprise.

“Senior?” The white-haired elder stroked his white beard while smiling, then said, “Have you met me before?”

Jian Wushuang smiled and said nothing. After remembering that he was wearing the wicked bloody mask, Jian Wushuang took the mask off and revealed his own appearance.

“Junior Jian Wushuang greets Senior Wine Master!” Jian Wushuang saluted solemnly.

Wine Master!

The elder in front of Jian Wushuang was the Lord of Ditian Prefecture who ranked top three in the Tang Dynasty. Jian Wushuang had only seen him once, when the elder took Yang Zaixuan as his personal disciple.

Wine Master left a deep impression on Jian Wushuang, not only because he was the first expert of the Saint Realm that Jian Wushuang met, but also because he was the master of Yang Zaixuan.

What he didn’t expect was that Wine Master was the Lord of Ditian Prefecture.

“Oh?” Wine Master looked at Jian Wushuang and instantly remembered Jian Wushuang once he heard his name.

“Jian Wushuang? Nan?” Wine Master smiled and said, “Several days ago, I heard that Tan Feng was killed. I was curious about who did it, but I never thought it was you.”

“The first time I met you, you were merely a young guy in the Gold Core Realm. You have made great progress in such a short time. Compared to you, that disciple of mine is far behind.”

“You flatter me, Senior.” Jian Wushuang was very modesty and asked, “Where is Yang Zaixuan?”

There was a hint of expectation deep in Jian Wushuang’s heart.

Jian Wushuang hadn’t seen Yang Zaixuan for a long time. Previously, in the Easternmost Hunt, Yang Zaixuan’s arm was chopped off. Jian Wushuang wondered whether he had taken the Purple Fire Body Shaping Elixir and recovered.

“A few days ago, he was bitterly defeated by someone. After recovering from his injury, he immediately went into seclusion. He might finish it in several days,” Wine Master answered.

“Yang Zaixuan was defeated by someone? Who was it?” Jian Wushuang asked with curiosity.

“Haha, the one that defeated him was the same Tan Feng who you just killed,” Wine Master laughed.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was really surprised, “Yang Zaixuan had a competition with Tan Feng?”

“Senior Wine Master, what the hell is going on?” Jian Wushuang immediately asked.

“Some time ago, that Ninth Heaven Mansion Master, Tan Feng, came here to meet me and wanted to trade for the Divine Wood of Gale and Thunderbolt, but I refused.”

Jian Wushuang listened to him seriously.

“The reason I refused was not that I was reluctant to part with the Divine Wood of Gale and Thunderbolt, nor was his treasure not valuable enough. On the contrary, he was sincere enough to bring very valuable treasures. They were definitely worth exchanging for a piece of Divine Wood of Gale and Thunderbolt. In truth, it was my disciple, or to be precise, you, that caused me to refuse.” said Wine Master.

“Because of me?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“The news that the Holy Emperor Palace offered a reward for your arrest was spread throughout the whole Nanyang Continent. I couldn’t possibly don’t know about it. However, one month ago, I heard that Tan Feng killed you and he got the reward from the Holy Emperor Palace.” Wine Master looked over at Jian Wushuang.

“My disciple is close to you. When he heard Tan Feng was here, he immediately tried to take revenge. It was a pity though, he was not strong enough and was defeated by Tan Feng. Because of my disciple, I naturally can’t give the Divine Wood of Gale and Thunderbolt to Tan Feng, so I kicked him out.”

“That’s it?” Jian Wushuang asked while smiling faintly.

He had heard from Hei Lin that Tan Feng failed to exchange for the Divine Wood of Gale and Thunderbolt in the Ditian Prefecture, and was kicked out by the Lord of Ditian Prefecture. At first, he was very curious why. But now, he realized that he himself was the reason.

“And my disciple suffered a lot after being defeated by Tan Feng, so he immediately entered seclusion. But I arranged it for him. Not surprisingly, after he finishes his seclusion, he will barely be able to contend with Tan Feng,” Wine Master said confidently.
