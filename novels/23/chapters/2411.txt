Chapter 2412: The Sword Principle Trial

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In terms of insights enlightenment, Jian Wushuang had received insights of Space-Time Law and Transmigration Law back at the Narcissus Mansion in Narcissus Island.

Those two insights were incomplete and were at a very low level. Despite that, they were a great help to Jian Wushuang to understand the two major laws of time, space, and transmigration.

Lying before his eyes now was the swordsmanship skill left by a sword cultivator at the Undying Saint-level!

“Even though I understand the sword principle, my speed will naturally be slower if I’m blindfolded as I have been exploring it on my own. If I have a complete set of sword principles, I’ll know what to explore next and how to explore further. It’ll definitely be helpful in improving my swordsmanship faster!”

“The sword principle insights left by this Purple Blood Saint is particularly important to me!” Jian Wushuang clasped his hands tightly together.

Not only did the Purple Blood Saint leave his sword principle insights, but also created the Purple Blood Swordsmanship.

For Jian Wushuang, what attracted him was the insights. Although the Purple Blood Swordsmanship was useful to Jian Wushuang, it was not as useful as the sword principle insights.

“I guess I’ll give it a go. Not sure if I can pass this trial bridge,” mumbled Jian Wushuang secretly.

The sword principle and Purple Blood Swordsmanship left behind by the Purple Blood Saint were available only after he passed the trial bridge. He would not get either of them if he failed to cross the bridge.

On the eighth trial bridge, Jian Wushuang had taken his first step.

The moment he took his first step, he saw different sceneries in front of him.

It was a dark void. Jian Wushuang stood in the very center of the void and in front of him was a shadowy figure.

Jian Wushuang could not clearly see the hazy figure which was holding a longsword in his hand. He had a pair of weird eyes that were looking straight at Jian Wushuang. “This space has 81 floors. You are currently on the first floor. After you defeat me, you will enter the next level and meet a stronger opponent than me.”

“You have ten days. If you pass all 81 floors within ten days, you are considered to have passed the test.”

The hazy figure spoke monotonously, but Jian Wushuang could hear him clearly.

Jian Wushuang shook his right hand and noticed that his power had been suppressed to the level of an ordinary Third-Class Divine Demon.

“So, the power remains at the level of an ordinary Divine Demons and we are competing purely with our swordsmanship?” Jian Wushuang raised his brows.

The trial bridge reminded him of the Sword Principle Trial Tower where he had been in his previous life for thousands of years.

The Sword Principle Trial Tower was an opportunity given to him by Emperor Thirteen. During the thousand years he spent in the Sword Principle Trial Tower, he had a new understanding of sword principle, and his swordsmanship cultivation was greatly improved.

The trial bridge’s test was very different from the Sword Principle Trial Tower, but its essence was similar.

It was basically a swordsmanship competition with the only difference being his opponent’s swordsmanship and sword principles understanding constantly improving with each test level.

“Only ten days? I don’t have time to waste.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and immediately started attacking.

Buzz!

Fuzzy sword light flashed.

Jian Wushuang was fighting against the first floor’s hazy figure.

In just a split second, Jian Wushuang’s sword pierced through the hazy figure and passed the first floor.

“The first floor is easy.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and went onto the second floor.

Soon, he passed the second floor, followed by the third and fourth floors. It did not take long for Jian Wushuang to pass the first ten floors before carrying on.

While Jian Wushuang was working through the eighth trial bridge, Su Tong stood with her eyes closed on the fifth trial bridge.

They were both in a darkened space, but Su Tong was fighting against eleven people instead of one.

Those eleven people were all Black-Armored Sergeants. All of them were wielding black spears and were extremely skillful. They worked seamlessly with each other, which brought a lot of pressure to Su Tong.

Most importantly, the number of sergeants increased as time went by.

Su Tong’s face remained emotionless as she wielded her spear with both skill and dexterity, silently sweeping across like a phantom. The Black-Armored Sergeants advanced towards her one after another, but she managed to ward them off with her spear and single-handedly fought those 11 Black-Armored Sergeants while remaining on the advantageous side.

However, good times did not last long and in the dark void, two Black-Armored Sergeants appeared out of thin air.

There were now a total of 13 sergeants against Su Tong.

Su Tong’s face sank, but she calmly dealt on.

She tried her best in the dark space and improved herself in the process of fighting with those Black-Armored Sergeants. Her set of spear skills became more nimble and flexible during combat.

No one from the outside knew about the scene.

Like other Narcissus Island’s disciples, they only saw her standing on the trial bridge, but could not see what she was facing.

Right at the deepest part of the tomb, a consciousness hidden in an independent space covered the entire inner area and even the entire Saint’s Tomb.

Whether it was the outer area or the inner area of the Saint’s Tomb, everything that happened in every corner was clearly visible to this consciousness.

What Su Tong and Jian Wushuang were facing on the trial bridges were clearly seen by the consciousness.

At that moment, the consciousness focused all its attention on the fifth trial bridge.

“This young lady is pretty good.”

A vague figure was floating in the hidden independent space and muttering to himself.

“Although at the beginning she didn’t have a very good understanding of spear combat skills, after entering the trial bridge and being tested in a battle with the Black-Armored Sergeants, she was able to continuously improve her skills. Her speed of improvement was remarkable. She is now obviously better than when she first entered the trial tower!”

“She is very talented in using a spear.”

The vague figure was admiring Su Tong.

However, he was only admiring her but did not have a high expectation. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

He knew fully well that even though Su Tong was skillful with the spear, and her comprehension ability was also outstanding, there was still a gap from his expectations.

Su Tong might be able to hit the second half of the fifth bridge’s tests, but it was not realistic for her to completely pass it.

True to his assumptions, as the number of Black-Armored Sergeants increased alongside their more tacit teamwork, Su Tong was placed under a lot of pressure.

She was nervous as compared to the calm demeanor that she started with.

Su Tong was defeated when the number of Black-Armored Sergeants almost reached 30.
