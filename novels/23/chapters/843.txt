Chapter 844: Promotion!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In the An Yong Prefecture, one of the 36 prefectures of Tang of the East, there was a huge mansion in the center of a city. The mansion’s owner was called Master Han.

He was powerful with a great reputation throughout the prefecture.

Under the dim moonlight, a figure in a scarlet cloak appeared in the void near this huge mansion.

This scarlet cloak had been transformed from Blood-eagle Armor, and its owner, naturally, was Jian Wushuang.

He stood in the void and took out his task scroll.

“There are total of 10 targets, each of whom is an expert at Step Six of the Eternal Realm. I only need to think of a way to kill three of them, then my mission is done.”Jian Wushuang clenched his fists.

It was extremely difficult to kill experts at Six Steps of the Eternal Realm, but Jian Wushuang had to kill three such experts by himself.

“The so-called Master Han in this mansion is not weak, but his life-saving ability is not good. I do have an opportunity to kill him!”

As he thought, Jian Wushuang turned over his hand, and in it appeared his Emperor Sword.

At the same time, he had activated his Bloodline Power and instantly turned into a 15-meter-tall Gold-armored Ancient God.

Now his terrible, irrepressible aura spread out, causing commotion around him.

“Who is that?”

A burst of shots rang out from the mansion. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“First, I’ll use the Emperor Sword to grapple with him for a while and then use the Blood Mountain Sword to kill him,” Jian Wushuang thought, his eyes sparkling with killing intent.

“Kill!”

He shouted and then glided toward the huge mansion.

Soon, a terrible battle broke out.

After a month’s cultivation in the Divine Sea, Jian Wushuang had improved dramatically. Even without the Blood Mountain Sword, he was powerful enough to fight against an expert at Step Six of the Eternal Realm, like now…

With his swordsmanship, Jian Wushuang had managed to keep Master Han down right from the beginning. After fighting for a while, he had the advantage. Then he easily killed his mighty opponent with his Blood Mountain Sword.

After finishing the first target, Jian Wushuang immediately headed for his second one.

…

A month later, when Jian Wushuang in Blood Eagle Armor appeared in the Eagle Hall, the other Blood Eagle Guards could not help but stare at him.

“That Blood Mountain, I heard that he took the Death Level mission alone, how is it going now?”

“Not bad, he’s managed to survive. As for the task, let’s see how it goes. In any case, the time limit for a task is generally very long. He can wait until he gets stronger in the future.”

“But our rule is that if a task has not been done, there is no way for him to take other tasks, right?”

“It’s true, but who is to blame for this? He can only blame himself for being too arrogant.”

Even though they were very quiet, Jian Wushuang clearly heard the surge of jeering voices.

Jian Wushuang ignored them and walked straight to the counter.

“I’m here to submit my task,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

“What?”

“Submit his task? Did I hear correctly? Did he say he will submit his task, and not abandon it?”

“He’s here to submit the task, which must mean he has already finished his Death Level task?”

The other Blood Eagle Guards were shocked.

Jian Wushuang quickly submitted the mission. After receiving the corresponding points for the mission, he took the second Death Level task and left.

It caused a commotion in the Eagle Hall.

“Really? Is this for real?”

“Blood Mountain actually finished a Death Level mission alone? And it only took him a month?”

“One month? How is it possible?”

“Even a Two-clawed Blood Eagle Guard is unable to complete a Death Level task in just one month, right?”

“Maybe it’s luck?”

These Blood Eagle Guards marveled at this.

But Jian Wushuang did not care at all what these guys thought of him. He immediately went to carry out the second Death Level mission, and like just before, by himself.

Autumn arrived. It had been a year since Jian Wushuang joined the Blood Eagle Guard.

Over the past year, Jian Wushuang had taken on three Death Level tasks by himself.

It was difficult for an ordinary Two-clawed Blood Eagle Guards to complete a Death Level task. If he carried it out alone, there was a 50 percent probability that he would make it, and it was still fraught with danger. However, it was easy as pie for Jian Wushuang.

The three Death Level missions were completed by him alone.

Each Death Level task was accompanied by rich rewards. After he completed all three missions, he had enough points to become a Two-clawed Blood Eagle Guard.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang was naturally promoted to Two-clawed Blood Eagle Guard. His status and authority had greatly improved.

When he was only a One-clawed Blood Eagle Guard, the highest level of task he could take on was only Death Level. However, now as a Two-clawed Blood Eagle Guard, he was able to take on Catastrophe Level tasks.

Jian Wushuang carried on this way for a while: taking on a task, completing it, and handing it over.

He had still taken on Death Level tasks, but now he had to deal with harder and more demanding Death Level tasks, and he still carried out them alone. What was more, he still had an astounding completion rate.

Of course, some tasks were great challenges for him. Sometimes, it took him several years to achieve a goal, and several times he was even put in danger after something unexpected had happened.

But in the end, Jian Wushuang kept his head and turned the tables by using his skills.

Time passed by as Jian Wushuang continued his crazy task escapade.

Before he knew it, Jian Wushuang had been a Blood Eagle Guard for 15 years.
