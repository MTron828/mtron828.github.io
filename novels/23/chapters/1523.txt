Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the void, there was a purple-haired elderly casually traveling forward casually and he happened to pass the nearby void where Jian Wushuang and the others were at.

“That’s it…”

The purple-haired elderly noticed the five figures in the void and suddenly looked surprised.

“Zi Dongwang, Xin Zhu, White-robed Swordsman, Jian Wushuang… The last one is, it’s God Destroying King! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“My God!”

The purple-haired elderly was astonished at the sight. He could tell that the five people in the void before him were obviously in two teams.

God Destroying King, Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu were in one.

Jian Wushuang and White-robed Swordsman were in another one.

“Breaking news! Breaking news!”

“This is definitely the pinnacle of all the fights in Wu Bei’s cave!”

The purple-haired elderly was excited and he instantly spread the news.

In an instant, the entirety of Wu Bei’s cave was astonished.

In the lofty palace in the outside world.

“I knew it. I knew Zi Dongwang would just give up easily. As expected!”

“Zi Dongwang even invited God Destroying King?”

“God Destroying King, he is widely recognized as the number one Universe God. He’s… supernatural!”

“God Destroying King, Zi Dongwang, Xin Zhu teamed up. It is definitely the strongest team in Wu Bei’s cave. White-robed Swordsman and Jian Wushuang are really in danger this time.”

The experts gasped with admiration yet sighed emotionally.

In the cave, countless Universe Gods received the news and were filled with all kinds of thoughts and emotions.

Those who were near to the battlefield immediately rushed over at their fastest speeds.

A team made of God Destroying King, Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu against Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng, both could be known as the strongest team in Wu Bei’s cave.

Naturally, everyone was dying to witness the clash of the two strongest teams with their own eyes.

In the void, the air was still and frozen entirely.

After God Destroying King, Zi Dongwang and Zin Zhu appeared, they didn’t speak. However, Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng knew their purpose of their visit.

“Duan Lingfeng, as you are looking forward to fight against God Destroying King, I shall leave the chance to you,” Jian Wushuang looked at Duan Lingfeng, “Are you confident?”

“No, but I can give it a try,” Duan Lingfeng looked cold as he withdrew the saber from the scabbard behind his back. A terrifying Sword Intention spread instantly and it was growing more and more intense.

Duan Lingfeng locked his gaze onto God Destroying King.

“You want to challenge me? Come on, let’s do it.”

God Destroying King looked cold too. As he spoke, he took a huge stride forward and his aura instantly soared to the peak.

Just like a primeval beast, he pounded Jian Wushuang and Duan Lingfeng.

“This aura is pretty impressive,” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

As the aura burst out, a golden long spear appeared in God Destroying King’s hands. The golden long spear was covered in unique golden dragon print. As he wielded it, there was a faint roar of the dragon that reverberated. The entire heaven and earth seemed to be under his feet.

The golden long spear was called Bellicose Spear.

God Destroying King had an overbearing manner.

“Fight!”

Duan Lingfeng’s eyes were glistening with sharpness. He roared and took a sudden step. The void under his foot instantly cracked.

“The thirteenth!”

Duan Lingfeng gripped the saber in his hands tightly. Under the flow of divine power, vroom. One towering crimson shadow appeared in the void.

A total of thirteen crimson blade shadows appeared and every one of them was ferocious. They were strong enough to strike fear into the experts in the top thirty on Universe God ranking list.

But at that very moment, after the thirteen crimson blade shadows appeared, they suddenly condensed and blended together. They formed a bright, glaring crimson moon.

The crimson moon suddenly swung out in silence.

Instantly, it spurred the entire heaven and earth to pressure God Destroying King.

God Destroying King saw the scene but his gaze was still as cold as before. Just as the crimson moon was slashing down against his body, the golden Bellicose Spear in his hands suddenly stabbed.

It was a casual stab, but it was earth-shattering.

Bellicose Spear contained an extermination aura. Even Jian Wushuang, Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu who were standing far away were palpitating.

“This is God Destroying King!”

“Any casual move or technique brings about boundless Extermination Intention. His level of comprehension of Extermination Doctrine is too high.

Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu saw the scene and gasped in admiration, especially Zi Dongwang.

He was arrogant and boastful and he was never willing to admit defeat. However, before God Destroying King, he had no courage to compete at all.

It wasn’t because he didn’t want to challenge God Destroying King, but because their difference was just too vast.

Bang!

A loud thud.

The void where the vigorous battle was happening instantly shattered and formed a scary void storm.

In the void storm, Duan Lingfeng shook his body and at that moment, it was as though he became three people and the three Duan Lingfengs were wielding his saber all at the same time.

God Destroying King was still standing there coldly but he gripped and the Bellicose Spear instantly turned into a cyclone and flew out like lightning.

Dang! Dang! Dang!

Duan Lingfeng moved backwards but the power in his bladelight also made God Destroying King take a step back.

“You can make me move backwards? With that alone, you are much stronger than Zi Dongwang,” God Destroying King said coldly.

Duan Lingfeng didn’t talk nonsense but looked at God Destroying King solemnly.

Suddenly, vroom. A boundless divine power revolved and suddenly exploded from Duan Lingfeng’s body. His body increased in size twofold. He was three meters tall and there were faint black ripples spreading from him. The entire universe was engulfed in darkness.

The originally ferocious aura in Duan Lingfeng went more intense by a notch at that very moment.

Zi Dongwang was shocked by the sight.

“Bastard. When he was fighting with me previously, he never performed these techniques!” Zi Dongwang’s face was distorted in anger.

When Duan Lingfeng was fighting against him, he suppressed him with only swordsmanship and his comprehension towards doctrines.

He never performed the secret skills that he was seeing then.

It was obvious that Duan Lingfeng held back some power when he fought with him

Swoosh!

Duan Lingfeng launched another attack.

“The Fourteenth!”

Vroom. In the void covered in darkness, there was a total of fourteen crimson blade shadows that appeared from nowhere.

The fourteen crimson blade shadows suddenly overlapped one another and straightaway slashed.

With the flawless combination of Massacre Doctrine and Darkness Doctrine among the Nine Heaven God Doctrines, Duan Lingfeng already burst out his strongest fighting power.

“Duan Lingfeng, he is really powerful.”

Jian Wushuang looked at Duan Lingfeng who was going all out and gasped with admiration. Then, he immediately glanced at Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu before him.

“Duan Lingfeng and God Destroying King are fighting so ferociously. I can’t be so relaxed.”

Jian Wushuang slightly lifted the corners of his lips. Blood Mountain Sword had already appeared in his hands.
