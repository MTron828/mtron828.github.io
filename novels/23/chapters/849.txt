“If Blood Mountain had used his full strength, do you think that you are still alive?”

Commander Hong’s words tingled Zi Diao’s heart.

“I, I…” Zi Diao hemmed and hawed for a while, but could not say half a word at all.

Even if he was unwilling to accept it, he was unable to deny what had just happened.

If Jian Wushuang had not shown any mercy, Zi Diao would have died already.

“Humph!”

Commander Hong snorted and yelled, “lost is lost, but you still want to defend yourself? Do you think that you’ll win if Blood Mountain didn’t use a consciousness attack skill?”

Zi Diao was stunned and immediately looked over at his opponent.

Jian Wushuang still looked indifferent.

The other Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard shot a scornful glance at Zi Diao.

All of them were experts at the Peak of Step Six, so they had seen this fight clearly.

Jian Wushuang had always been resisting Zi Diao’s attack in a calm manner.

They all knew that Jian Wushuang had not used his full strength.

Jian Wushuang seemingly won the fight because of the consciousness attack. In fact, he was unwilling to expose too many skills, so he chose the simplest way.

Even if Jian Wushuang had not done consciousness attack, Zi Diao was still unable to defeat him.

“Blood Mountain is very powerful!”

“He is strong indeed. In fact, he has been defending in the fight, and have not shown all his strength. But he easily defeated Zi Diao with a casual attack. I’m afraid, his real strength ranks in the top five among us.”

“Top five. I don’t think so. Maybe top three.”

“Zi Diao lost, but he is not convinced? It’s ridiculous.”

Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards chatted freely, so Jian Wushuang and Zi Diao were able to hear them.

Zi Diao flushed, his face turning pig liver color.

Jian Wushuang still had an indifferent look.

It was not a big deal for him to defeat Zi Diao.

15 years ago, he was able to compete against experts at Peak of Step Six using the Blood Mountain Sword, after a month of cultivation in the Divine Sea.

Over the past 15 years, his strength greatly improved through the task training.

His Sword Heart had reached Level Four.

Even without the Blood Mountain Sword and the Mind-controlling Secret Skill, Jian Wushuang was confident enough to fight against Zi Diao. Therefore, he easily won this fight.

“All right.” Commander Hong spoke.

The entire hall became quiet.

“As you said, those who are powerful should be respected and qualified to take the Hell Level mission. Now you have now lost to Blood Mountain, but if you are not convinced, you can go to challenge Jiu Zui, Ling Long, Shui Jin. As long as you can beat any of them, you still have the opportunity to perform this Hell Level mission,” Commander Hong said indifferently.

Upon hearing this, Zi Diao’s face started to twitch.

The 17 Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards had also sparred with each other, so there was also a general ranking of strength about them. Zi Diao ranked 11th while Jiu Zui, Ling Long, and Shui Jin…

Jiu Zui ranked first.

The other Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard had to confessed that they could not match him. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ling Long ranked third, and she was known as the most horrible one as she had countless skills. Even Jiu Zui did not dare to challenge her.

Shui Jin ranked eighth, three levels higher than Zi Diao.

Five guards stood out at the same time. The reason why Zi Diao let Jian Wushuang give up was that the other three were stronger than him, so he had to bully Jian Wushuang.

He did not expect that Jian Wushuang was a tough one.

In that case, Zi Diao had no opportunity to take this task.

“So, you are not going to challenge them?” Commander Hong stared at Zi Diao while asking.

Zi Diao gritted his teeth, but eventually, he shook his head with a wry smile.

“In this case, the four people who will perform the Hell Level mission this time have already been determined, Jiu Zui, Ling Long, Shui Jin, and Blood Mountain.” Commander Hong announced the result. “As for the other guards, go to carry out your previous tasks.”

“Yes, I do.”

The Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guards who did not accept the Hell Level mission quickly left.

Commander Hong stood on the steps while looking at the four guards. “This mission is not the same as before. Four of you have good strength, but you’d better do mental preparation for it.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang and the other three guards became serious.

Commander Hong glided forward and waved at them. “Follow me.”

“Commander, where are we going?” Jiu Zui could not help but ask.

Commander Hong replied, “This Hell Level mission is personally released by Empress Leng. I don’t know the content of the mission. Therefore, I’ll take you to see Empress Leng.”

“Empress Leng?”

Four of them were all struck dumb.

Empress Leng?

One of the four emperors in the heyday of the Tang of the East?

The real ruler of the Tang of the East?

Empress Leng who had great fame and deterrence in the Eternal World?
