Chapter 1637: Lovesick

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The whole universe had quietened down.

At the center of the universe, King Gu You and King Gu Tong were looking at each other and even the air froze.

After a long time, King Gu Tong laughed apathetically, “Seems like I really cannot do anything about you.”

“I’ll be waiting for you in the Gu King City,” King Gu You said.

“Alright,” King Gu Tong nodded his head.

He was a very proud and aloof person.

Even though he had lost, it was not that he was unwilling to lower his head.

Instead… he felt ashamed to see King Gu You, his elder brother. As such, he remained at his current location and did not return to the Gu King City.

This was a kind of stubbornness. However, it could also be said to be a kind of pride.

It was not until that moment, when King Gu You appeared and swallowed his pride completely to appear as his elder brother to persuade him, that King Gu Tong finally accepted his offer.

Upon seeing King Gu Tong nodding his head, King Gu You revealed a smile. After that, his eyes moved and he looked at Jian Wushuang, “Little kid, you are Gu Jian?”

“Gu Jian is my alias. My real name is Jian Wushuang,” Jian Wushuang said with respect.

“Jian Wushuang?” King Gu You raised his eyebrows, “For you to be able to clear the sixth level of the Star Moon Tower, you are not too bad.”

After talking, King Gu You’s body turned vague and he disappeared from this piece of universe.

It was only after King Gu You left that the atmosphere at their location eased up completely.

“King Gu Tong.”

The leader of the Asura Tribe, Gu Luo, said with respect, “The matter this time round was planned by King Gu You secretly and my Asura Tribe was merely following his orders. If we have offended you in any way, we hope that you can forgive us.”

“I shall treat this matter as though it never happened. You may leave now,” King Gu Tong waved his hands.

“Thank you very much,” Gu Luo heaved a sigh of relief. After that, he brought the Ancient Gods under him along with him and left straight away.

Atop the void, under the gazes of many clansmen, King Gu Tong raised his head and looked up at the sky. It was only a long time later that he sighed.

“All of you are to make your preparations. We will return to Gu King City three days later,” King Gu Tong instructed.

In a split second, the clansmen of the whole tribe rejoiced.

Upon seeing that, Jian Wushuang laughed indifferently.

Three days later, the whole tribe of King Gu Tong’s lineage relocated into the Gu King City.

After reaching the Gu King City, they moved to the place that King Gu You had pre-arranged a long time ago. Moreover, King Gu Tong also returned to the Gu King City. Even though his abilities had deteriorated, he was still one of the overlords of the Gu King City. With his position, no one could touch him.

As for Jian Wushuang, he naturally returned to the Ancient God Palace.

For the next period of time, he would continue to stay in the Ancient God Palace to train so that he could familiarize himself with the Ancient God Lineage’s Four Unique Skills, as well as the Two Secret Skills.

For the past few years, although he had grasped the Four Unique Skills and Two Secret Skills during the intense battles he had had, he had only grasped them in their early stages. As such, there was still much room for him to improve.

Time was merciless and it continued to flow.

Jian Wushuang had already lived for tens of thousands of years. To experts of the Eternal Chaotic World, Jian Wushuang was still considered very young. To Jian Wushuang, who had lived for quite a long period of time, thousands of years of time were considered nothing.

In a flash, Jian Wushuang had already come to the Eternal Chaotic World for a thousand and seven hundred years.

In front of a stone table in a giant garden in the Ancient God Palace, there was a golden-haired youth sitting alone and drinking wine.

“Gu Zhen.”

A voice could be heard and Jian Wushuang appeared within the garden.

“Why are you drinking wine alone here?” Jian Wushuang wore a smile.

He had participated in the same Ancient God Palace assessment as Zhen Gu. After that, for the past few years in the Ancient God Palace, their relationship was still considered not too bad.

“Gu Jian, you have come at the right time. Come and drink with me,” Gu Zhen waved his hand and another wine cup appeared on the stone table at once.

Jian Wushuang did not stand on ceremony and sat down beside the stone table straight away.

“From your look, could it be that you are thinking of someone you love?” Jian Wushuang asked randomly.

“Haha, you have guessed correctly,” Gu Zhen laughed, “I am thinking of her and I really, really miss her.”

“If that’s the case, why don’t you look for her?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

“Of course I wish to look for her. However, there’s no use. Even if I went, I would not be able to see her. She’s a real genius and her background cannot be compared to mine. For the past few years, I trained extremely hard so that I could catch up with her one day. However, looking at it now, the distance between me and her is getting even wider. Even though we have feelings for each other, it’s unsure whether we will really be together in the end. Now, I’m merely feeling lovesick and enduring the pain of this lovesickness,” Gu Zhen laughed at himself.

“Love will find a way. As long as you work hard, you will definitely end up with the person you love,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Haha, love will find a way? You actually believe those words?” Gu Zhen shook his head and laughed. All of a sudden, he looked at Jian Wushuang, “Oh right. Jian Wushuang, do you have someone you love?”

“Me?” Jian Wushuang was stunned. However, he could not help but raise the wine cup in front of him, “I have a beloved wife.”

After talking, he drank the wine in his wine cup down in one gulp.

“A wife? I’m really envious of you,” Gu Zhen gasped in admiration. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Envious of me?” Jian Wushuang glanced at Gu Zhen and his expression turned a bit unusual.

Gu Zhen was envious of him. However, in actual fact, he was envious of Gu Zhen.

At the very least, Gu Zhen knew where his beloved person was and how she was doing. Hence, he could continue to work hard for her.

But what about him?

At that very moment, he did not even know where his wife was. He had been doing his best to find her in the Eternal Chaotic World. Although he had finally managed to find her once and she was already very close to him, in the end, he could only look on as she left him.

He knew that her aura and consciousness were in a completely sealed state and that they might disappear at any time. Moreover, there was another evil consciousness occupying her body and committing evil deeds all around the Eternal Chaotic World. However, he was unable to do anything about it.

“You have merely experienced the pain of lovesickness. As for me, I have been suffering all the while!” Jian Wushuang forced a smile. However, his eyes were filled with unprecedented resolve and determination.

He had never given up on his wife.

All the effort that he had put in up to that moment had been for his wife.

“Shuang’er…”

“Wait for a while more. I will definitely find you and bring you back in one piece to our hometown happily!”

“Definitely!!!”

Jian Wushuang clenched both his fists tightly. His fingertips had already cut his flesh and blood flowed from it.

However, at that very moment, Jian Wushuang’s body shook fiercely.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes shrank, “This, this kind of feeling. Could it be…?”

Jian Wushuang was delighted.

“Gu Zhen, you can continue drinking. I have an urgent matter to attend to and I cannot drink with you anymore.”

After Jian Wushuang spoke, he left quickly.

Gu Zhen was still sitting beside the stone table. As he looked at Jian Wushuang, who had left abruptly, he had a doubtful expression, “We had been having such a great conversation. How can he just leave like that?”

Although he was in doubt, Gu Zhen did not give chase. Instead, he continued drinking alone.

In the Ancient God Palace, Jian Wushuang came to a secret room in the hall which he stayed in. After that, he placed a seal around the secret room to stop people from coming in to disturb him.

Straight away after that, he sat down with his legs crossed immediately.

After taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were overflowing with delightfulness.

“Jian Wushuang, your chance has come and you must not miss it at any cost. Instead, you must make the best of it,” the King of Venomous Worms’ voice echoed in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

Jian Wushuang could tell from the King of Venomous Worms’ voice that he was over the moon at that moment as well.

As he had been living in Jian Wushuang’s body, he was knowledgeable about Jian Wushuang’s current state.

He knew that Jian Wushuang… was about to make a breakthrough!
