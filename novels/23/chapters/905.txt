Chapter 906: The Answer!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Is it me?”

Jian Wushuang asked himself.

He didn’t know.

“Third brother, will you participate in the Selection Ceremony in three years time?” Wang Yuan asked Jian Wushuang with interest.

Jian Wushuang fixed his eyes slightly, pondered for a while, then nodded heavily. “I will.”

“Haha…” Wang Yuan laughed. “Third brother, it seems that I am right. You really do like Leng Rushuang, otherwise you would never have taken such a risk to find the Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit in the Stellar Fog Sea.

“Tell me, when did you become interested in Leng Rushuang?”

Wang Yuan turned his gaze, looking forward to Jian Wushuang’s answer.

Jian Wushuang put on a bitter smile, but his eyes became blurry.

“Leng Rushuang…”

As early as the first time he had seen her in the Ancient World, the cold pride in Leng Rushuang’s bones had made him throb slightly.

This kind of throb spread slowly in his body like a spider web.

The next month when Jian Wushuang was living in the Nature Residence, Leng Rushuang had played the Chinese zither every day. Jian Wushuang had practiced his swordsmanship to this melody.

For Jian Wushuang, it could be said that this had been his most relaxing month. Although he had not seen Leng Rushuang for a long time after that, she was still on his mind, leaving a very deep memory that could never be erased.

“Have I really fallen in love with Leng Rushuang??” Jian Wushuang asked himself.

“Yes, I have.”?Jian Wushuang confirmed the answer in his heart.

He felt good around her!

From the beginning of his cultivation, step by step, he had been surrounded by countless women of varied character. However, the only one who stayed in his heart forever was Leng Rushuang.

This feeling could not be wrong.

As early as in the Ancient World, as early as in the Nature Residence, Jian Wushuang had already loved her.

After so many years had passed, the impression Leng Rushuang left in Jian Wushuang’s heart, had not weakened. It had become even stronger.

When he saw her afflicted with the Icy Heart Poison, Jian Wushuang had also felt a piercing pain in his heart.

When Jian Wushuang learned that the Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit could stop the poison, he had broken into the Stellar Fog Sea without hesitation.

Perhaps he could not treat this love like Jiu Zui did, asking for nothing in return, without any selfishness, only pure love.

But true love was give and receive!

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath, looked at Wang Yuan and asked, “Elder Brother Wang Yuan, if I go to the palace, can I see her?”

“You can’t,” Wang Yuan answered, shaking his head. “Ever since the Selection Ceremony was announced, Empress Leng has blocked all outside connections. No matter who it is, if they want to see her, they have to get Empress Leng’s personal approval.”

“Really?” Jian Wushuang wrinkled his eyebrows.

“Actually, I really admire the Empress for being so sultry and heartless,” Wang Yuan said in an appreciative tone. “She is the one who knows Leng Rushuang’s condition best, however, at this point, instead of trying to find a way to save her life, she is squeezing out the last bit of her daughter’s value by making her marry the Xia Clan to achieve her purpose. Leng Rushuang is unfortunate to have such a mother.”

“Leng Rushuang is being used as a chip?” Jian Wushuang said. His eyes turned cold.

Jian Wushuang had seen so much during these years that he could extrapolate many things from Wang Yuan’s words.

“It appears I need to meet Master Mubai of the Xia Clan and Empress Leng,” Jian Wushuang said in a cold voice. Then he took out the Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit and handed it to Wang Yuan.

“Elder Brother Wang Yuan, this is the Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit I brought back from the Stellar Fog Sea. As for the Crape Myrtle Elixir, I’m counting on you.”

“The Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit? You really got it?” Wang Yuan said with a surprised smile. He nodded heavily. “Don’t worry, with the Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit, I can guarantee that the Crape Myrtle Elixir can be refined within three months. When you join in the Selection Ceremony in three years’ time, you will have to prepare a few wedding gifts. The Crape Myrtle Elixir is unique and would have a great effect on Leng Rushuang. It’s absolutely appropriate to be one of the wedding gifts.”

“Wedding gifts?” Jian Wushuang repeated with a silent smile. “By the way, I have a few things to show you.”

Jian Wushuang took out the five Bodhi Fruits he’d been given by Lord Spirit Sound.

“This is…” Wang Yuan stared at the Bodhi Fruit in Jian Wushuang’s hands, and a light suddenly flashed in his eyes. “The Bodhi Fruit, this is the Bodhi Fruit!”

“You know it?” Jian Wushuang asked with a smile. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Of course I know the Bodhi Fruit. The Bodhi Fruit is known to almost every alchemist who has attained certain accomplishments in refining elixirs.”

Wang Yuan said in an excited voice, “The Bodhi Fruit is the most important material in refining the legendary elixir, Bodhi Dan. Countless top class alchemists dream of obtaining a Bodhi Fruit in order to refine the legendary elixir. Unfortunately, the Bodhi Fruit hasn’t been seen in the Eternal World for a long time. The last Bodhi Fruit was found five million years ago.

“Third brother, how did you get five Bodhi Fruits?”

“Please don’t ask me about the source of the Bodhi Fruit. Just tell me whether you can refine the Bodhi Dan with them,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Refine the Bodhi Dan?” Wang Yuan had a bitter smile. “Third brother, I have been studying with the Master and I’ve improved a lot in my refining elixir skill. I can barely take a seat as one of the chief alchemists in the Tang of the East, but when it comes to refining the Bodhi Dan…

“The Bodhi Dan is a legendary elixir that gives someone a 90 percent chance of breaking through from the Eternal Realm to Dao Master. In the whole Eternal World, there can’t be more than three alchemists who can refine this kind of elixir. I don’t have the ability yet.

“But don’t worry, my Master can refine it.

“I’ll give my Master a message to ask him to refine the Bodhi Dan immediately. This is a once in a blue moon opportunity that he certainly won’t refuse. With his ability, five Bodhi Fruits can be refined into four Bodhi Dans at least.”

“Your Master?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. “Please send my appreciation to him. If he needs any special materials, just tell me. I will collect them as soon as possible. The only requirement is to make sure to refine the Bodhi Dan in three years.”

“Three years? Third brother, you want to…” Wang Yuan looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Didn’t you say I should prepare wedding gifts for the Selection Ceremony? One Crape Myrtle Elixir may be not valuable enough, but if I add four Bodhi Dans, allowing the Tang of the East to have four more Dao Masters, as wedding gifts, the wedding gifts shouldn’t be taken lightly!” Jian Wushuang said.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were full of brilliance.
