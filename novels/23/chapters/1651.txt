1652 The Purpose of Demon Spiri

“It’s me,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Humph, a Void Real God dares to wander in the Eighth Lair and come into the inner layer. You really have guts.”

Real God Can Yang harrumphed coldly and there was a flash of a strange light in his eyes. He thought to himself, “This Jian Wushuang, although he is only a Void Real God, he is the most outstanding disciple of Lineage of Star and he is an inverse cultivator. Under normal circumstances, a top genius like him definitely received many opportunities and he definitely has quite a bit of possession. He might have more than a Chaotic Real God. If I were to kill him here…”

Real God Can Yang thought and immediately shook his head.

“Jian Wushuang isn’t an idiot. He dared to come to wander in Eighth Lair, so he definitely has a backer. Forget about the fact if I could kill him, even if I were to be lucky enough to kill him… the void that I’m in isn’t cut off from the outside world, he could totally send out a message before he dies and have Lineage of Star take revenge on his behalf.

“I am merely a solo Chaotic Real God. If I were to really be watched by Lineage of Star, it would be difficult for me to move around Sanctuary Alliance and even the entire Eternal Chaotic World. Forget about it.

Real God Can Yang made a decision in his mind.

“Young man, the Eighth Lair isn’t like any other place. You are only a Void Real God… I hope you can stay alive for a while,” Real God Can Yang said and then he turned to leave.

Jian Wushuang stood there as he watched Real God Can Yang leave, but he squinted his eyes slightly.

“If I’m not mistaken, Real God Can Yang should have had the idea of killing me before. But in the end, he gave up the idea,” Jian Wushuang muttered. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The change of Real God Can Yang’s expression earlier, although it was greatly concealed, Jian Wushuang’s soul power was spread out at all times and engulfed Real God Can Yang within. He could even see Real God Can Yang change his expression a slight bit. He naturally noticed Real God Can Yang’s glimpse of murderous intention.

“He should be worried about the Lineage of Star that is backing me up. He was worried that he couldn’t kill me there and then. He was also worried that I would send out a message before I die. After all, the void around here isn’t cut off from the outside world. He could only give up the idea,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

The Eighth Lair was a special space.

In most places, space and the outside world could keep in contact and they could send messages to one another.

However, there were also many spaces that were cut off from the outside world. There was an area in the space that couldn’t send out any messages.

The place that Jian Wushuang was at then belonged to the former.

“It seems that Hall Master Yuan is right. When I am wandering in the Eighth Lair, not only must I be careful of the Star Demon Clan and some natural danger, but I also must be careful of other experts who are wandering in the lair,” Jian Wushuang said to himself.

On the way to the Eighth Lair, Hall Master Yuan exhorted him about this.

Sanctuary Alliance looked like an entire entity. But after all, it was united by huge forces and solo experts.

The internal power of Sanctuary Alliance was complicated and they were in a constant fight. War and massacre between themselves were very common. They naturally weren’t of one mind.

Even when they were in the Eighth Lair, the experts in Sanctuary Alliance would fight and scheme against one another. As long as there was interest, they would massacre and fight.

About that, the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance could do nothing about it but gave free rein.

“I am the most outstanding disciple of Lineage of Star and I am an inverse cultivator. I must have received many opportunities. The experts in Sanctuary Alliance definitely know that and it is inevitable that they will have wicked ideas,” Jian Wushuang lifted the corner of his lips but his gaze grew cold.

“Regardless, I’ll do what I need to do. I do not find trouble with others. But if there were to be people who dared to make trouble with me, there would be no need for me to be polite.”

Then, Jian Wushuang didn’t continue to stay but started wandering in the surrounding dark void.

In the inner layer of the eighth lair, it was much bigger. The scattering of Star Demon was more densely populated. Jian Wushuang let out his soul power and wandered in the inner layer. He could find Star Demons with ease.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang’s soul power formed into a soul storm and covered the dozens of Star Demons before him.

Among the dozens of Star Demons, there was only one adult Star Demon with a horn.

Faced with Jian Wushuang’s soul attack, only the Star Demon with a horn among the dozens of Star Demons withstood it. The other Star Demons were killed.

Just as Jian Wushuang moved, he creepily appeared next to the adult Star Demon. A sword light swept out and it cut off the adult Star Demon’s head.

Then, Jian Wushuang started searching for demon spirit and demon core.

In a short while…

“Not bad, I found nine demon spirit and one demon core,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“The Star Demon Clan, although they are the only magical creature that knows how to destroy and massacre, the demon spirit in their bodies is an extremely pure strength. The strength is extremely useful to a cultivator,” Jian Wushuang spread his hand and there were nine extremely pure unique currents. The nine currents were the nine demon spirits.

Besides, he also had a black crystal. The crystal was a magic core. In the magic core, there was a vast and pure strength.

“The demons spirit and the strength in the demon core… are so pure!” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but compliment.

He could feel it clearly that demon spirits were an extremely high-end strength with no impurity.

Such strength was put before him and Jian Wushuang had the idea to swallow and absorb it.

“Let’s give it a try.”

Jian Wushuang took in the first demon spirit into his body without hesitation.

He raised the demon spirit and it was immediately absorbed into his divine body.

“Mm, what’s going on? Why can’t I feel anything?”

Jian Wushuang was shocked. With confusion, he continued to absorb the second demon spirit, the third demon spirit, and the remaining eight demon spirits altogether.

He took in nine demon spirits in one but Jian Wushuang didn’t feel any difference in his divine body.

“Mm, that’s not right,” Jian Wushuang’s expression suddenly changed, “There’s nothing different with my divine body but my divine power… it seems to have improved!”

“Yes, it improved. My ultimate divine power feels like much more than before.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes twinkled with joy.

“I understand, I understand now!”

“This demon spirit is absorbed and transformed into a cultivator’s divine power. The speed of transformation is extremely fast. In other words, as long as one can absorb a large number of demon spirits, the divine power in cultivator’s body will increase tremendously. There isn’t a need to accumulate divine power through cultivation.”

Then, Jian Wushuang was filled with excitement.
