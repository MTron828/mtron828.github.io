4473 Choosing the Divine Corpse

Inside Coffin Mountain, Corpse Qi filled the air.

A black mist that had condensed into a physical form shot up into the sky, covering the sun and the moon.

Wooden coffins, stone coffins, bronze coffins, and other coffins of different shapes lay quietly in Coffin Mountain, waiting for someone to come and choose.

Elder Mi Feng stood in the air with his hands behind his back as he watched Jian Wushuang pick the coffins indifferently.

!!

“Wushuang, the divine corpses in the coffins are everywhere. These divine corpses had different cultivation levels when they were alive. From ordinary Star-level Void Warriors to Scar-level Void Warriors and even Five Scar Void Warriors like me, you can find them all in this Coffin Mountain.”

“The cultivation of the divine corpse was indeed an important part worth studying. After all, it would determine the divine corpse’s future growth to a large extent.”

“However, you must remember not to choose the divine corpse just based on his cultivation level. Compared to the divine corpse’s cultivation level when he was alive, the degree of compatibility between you and the divine corpse is more important.”

“In the past, there were many new disciples who had just entered the God Refining Sect. They only chose the corpses of the gods with high cultivation levels. In the end, not only did they fail to refine the corpses, but their cultivation levels also stagnated. Most importantly, they were devoured by the corpses and lost their lives in vain.”

“Wushuang, you should understand what I mean.”

“Thus, Wushuang, the most important thing when choosing an divine corpse is the degree of compatibility with you. As for how you look at it, I can only say that it’s completely based on your first instinct.”

“Degree of compatibility?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up and he immediately walked toward the first coffin.

It was a wooden coffin lying quietly in front of him. As soon as he got close to it, Jian Wushuang felt a majestic killing intent coming from the golden spear!

In an instant, Jian Wushuang felt as if he had fallen into a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood. A burly man wearing armor, a black iron helmet, and a silver mask stood in the universe, slaughtering and trampling on all directions!

Elder Mi Feng could feel the murderous aura emanating from the wooden coffin. He nodded and said, “Wushuang, this man is Wu Kang, the top general of the Grand Moon Divine Dynasty. He uses martial arts to refine the void. Although his cultivation is a little low, only at 8-Star and not yet at the Scar level, he has a lot of combat experience. He has killed and fought countless battles in his life. If you can refine him into a divine corpse, you will definitely have a general to protect you in the future!”

Jian Wushuang nodded. Without much hesitation, he removed his hand from the lid of the wooden coffin and walked to the second coffin.

Although the purpose of Jian Wushuang’s trip to the Void Universe this time was to help the Cosmos Gods gather information, he would naturally not miss out on the method to increase his power. Thus, he ended the matter easily.

According to Jian Wushuang’s conversation with Elder Mi Feng along the way, he learned that once the divine corpse in the coffin was refined, the divine corpse would never betray him unless it was under extreme circumstances.

On the path of cultivation, regardless of whether they were close relatives or good friends, there was a possibility that they would fall out and fight to the death for an opportunity or fortune.

However, the divine corpse in the coffin would not do that. It could be said that once the divine corpse was refined, it would be equivalent to one’s most powerful avatar!

The second coffin was a bamboo coffin.

Just as Jian Wushuang placed his hand on the sword, Elder Mi Feng said, “The divine corpse in this bamboo coffin was the current Holy Maiden of the Bright Moon Immortal Sect 1,000 void eras ago. Her seduction skills were superb, and she once created the magnificent feat of seducing and killing a Scar-level Void Warrior with her cultivation of 8-Star!”

“Wushuang, if you can refine this divine corpse, it’ll also be a great improvement for you, and you can use it as a hidden chess piece.”

However, Jian Wushuang shook his head after feeling it carefully. He moved his hand away and walked toward the third coffin.

“Still not satisfied?” Elder Mi Feng frowned. In his opinion, the two divine corpses were more compatible with Jian Wushuang. Firstly, their cultivation levels were not too high, so Jian Wushuang could easily control and refine them. Secondly, the two divine corpses were extremely talented when they were alive. Even though they had died a violent death, they had much strength to be desired.

If Jian Wushuang could refine it now, he would definitely become Jian Wushuang’s right-hand man in the future.

However, he did not know that Jian Wushuang, in fact, was already a Scar-level Void Warrior if the realms of the two universes were converted.

To Jian Wushuang, the two corpses could not provide him with any help even if he refined them.

Jian Wushuang stopped briefly at the five coffins in a row. Then, he shook his head and walked past them without hesitation.

An hour later, Jian Wushuang reached the middle of Coffin Mountain.

In the five coffins, there were Heaven’s Favorites who had amazing talents but were killed. There were also top battle gods who fought in all directions. However, Jian Wushuang did not pay any attention to them.

Elder Mi Feng’s brows furrowed even more tightly upon seeing this.

“Wushuang, don’t underestimate your opponent!”

Finally, Elder Mi Feng could not take it anymore and chided him in a low voice.

“Hmm!” Jian Wushuang turned to look at Elder Mi Feng, then touched his nose and said, “Elder Mi Feng, I know what I’m doing.”

“You know what to do?” Elder Mi Feng could not help but laugh in anger when he heard this. “Alright, I’d like to see what kind of divine corpse you’ll choose!”

With this in mind, Elder Mi Feng decided not to say anything more. He closed his eyes and allowed Jian Wushuang to choose.

Time slowly passed.

Jian Wushuang had already reached the halfway point of the mountain. At this point, there were fewer and fewer Heaven’s Favorites who had shone brightly in the universe but were killed due to various reasons. In their place, there were some almighty experts who were invincible in the universe, the Scar-level Void Warriors!

In terms of fighting power, this universe was slightly higher than Jian Wushuang’s home universe and had more experts. However, a universe at the Scar level was still a universe master who could command the wind and clouds in the universe and control a Star Field!

Jian Wushuang’s speed slowed down. He no longer just touched the coffins, sensed the cultivation of the divine corpse in the coffins, and chose to leave.

He began to think.

Just as Elder Mi Feng thought that Jian Wushuang would choose some divine corpses from this spot, Jian Wushuang continued to walk up.

One Scar level…

Two Scar level… Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Jian Wushuang did not stop.

“You greedy idiot!”

Elder Mi Feng was instantly infuriated and his impression of Jian Wushuang dropped.

One should know that Jian Wushuang was choosing the divine corpse. In fact, from another perspective, the divine corpse was also choosing Jian Wushuang.

Previously, the cultivation of the divine corpses was still low, so Jian Wushuang could choose any one he wanted and refine them.

In the middle of Coffin Mountain, although Jian Wushuang’s realm was much higher than that of the One Scar and Two Scar divine corpses when they were alive, he should not have been able to refine them.

However, Jian Wushuang was extremely talented. He was able to shoot out black light and was comparable to the founding ancestor of the God Refining Sect. It was possible that Jian Wushuang could refine These Scar-level divine corpses.

But looking at Jian Wushuang, it was clear that he was going to reach the top!

If this was not stupidity, then what was?
