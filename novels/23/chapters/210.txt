Chapter 211: Give me an explanation!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Origin, is very enigmatic!

There were many powerhouses with Yin-Yang Void Realm at the present, including a lot of powerhouses who reached the top of Yang Void Realm.

But none of them comprehended the Origin.

Now, Jian Wushuang, a guy just in the Primordial Golden Pill Realm, comprehended the Origin.

The people stared at the figure below with fear who was slowly flying towards them.

Despite seeing Jian Wushuang walking on air, they didn’t feel surprised.

After all, Jian Wushuang was able to comprehend the Origin, even though he was on the level of Golden Pill, it is believable for him to be able to fly due to it.

The next moment, he had already appeared in front of the top experts.

Jian Wushuang, with an indifferent expression, floated on the void, staring at the experts from the Twelve Northwestern Dynasties and the old sects.

“Your Excellencies of Twelve Northwestern Dynasties, I demand an explanation.” Jian Wushuang said in an extremely cold voice with fierce fire burning in his eyes.

The Easternmost Hunting was held in Sky Valley by the Twelve Northwestern Dynasties, so Jian Wushuang knew that experts of the Twelve Northwestern Dynasties must watch it in the Void nearby.

At this time, killers of the Blood Feather Tower intruded on the battlefield of the Easternmost Hunting to assassinate him, yet the experts of the Twelve Northwestern Dynasties did not react to this intrusion.

How could Jian Wushuang not be angry?

The Twelve Northwestern Dynasties held the Easternmost Hunting in this way?

They really could not protect the geniuses attending the Easternmost Hunting and let them be killed by others freely?

After hearing what Jian Wushuang said, the monarchs of the Twelve Northwestern Dynasties looked embarrassed. They even didn’t dare to look straight at Jian Wushuang, because they clearly knew that they should be responsible for it.

They should give Jian Wushuang an explanation indeed.

“Jian Wushuang.”

A mighty voice sounded. It was the monarch of the Immortals-killing Empire, the frivolous man. However, he was not as arrogant as before, looking toward Jiang Wushuang apologetically at this moment.

“For what happened today, we, the Twelve Northwestern Dynasties, apologize wholeheartedly, but we must explain that we had nothing that we could have done to prevent this.

“We can’t give you an explanation that would satisfy you! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“What I can tell you is, the force that wanted to kill you is far beyond our endurance range. The Twelve Northwestern Dynasties are like ants in front of that force. It can make us perish without a sweat.

“The force wanted to kill you and we weren’t capable to stop it.”

After saying that, the flippant man let out his breath and directly closed his eyes.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help but squint.

He understood something from what the monarch of the Immortals-killing Empire said.

It was not only the Blood Feather Tower who wanted to kill him but now another force, a much more dangerous one had the same goal.

The force was so horrible that the Twelve Northwestern Dynasties were extremely frightened by it. Therefore, even though the Blood Feather Tower intruded on the field of the Easternmost Hunting to assassinate him, they did not dare to stop the event.

“There really is a more horrible force behind Blood Feather Tower,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

He had guessed that Blood Feather Tower was not as simple as it had appeared.

His guess was now finally confirmed.

However, what Jian Wushuang didn’t expect was that the force behind Blood Feather Tower was so powerful.

Even the Wilderness Sword Sect, one of the eight top sects in Nanyan, could not frighten the Twelves Northwestern so much that they were incapable to retaliate.

After thinking about that, Jian Wushuang understood why the Twelve Northwestern Dynasties didn’t help him. He turned his sight towards Di Xi.

Di Xi still sat on the seat, looking at Jian Wushuang. His eyes were full of apologies and embarrassment.

Jian Wushuang nodded at Di Xi slightly.

He knew that Di Xi was forced not to help him.

“Apparently, there are so many people in the world wanting to kill me,” Jian Wushuang sneered and said.

“Hmm, did you realize that only now?” A cold voice came from the void beside him. It was Grayrobe who was speaking.

Jian Wushuang looked over at the man in a gray robe, narrowing his eyes and said, “If I didn’t guess wrong, you are Sir Grayrobe of Blood Feather Tower?”

Grayrobe said coldly, “You flatter me. Jian Wushuang, it was out of my expectation that your strength had advanced to such a high extent. Even though we had sent all the elite killers, they collapsed at the first blows.

“If I have known that you would reach such a level, I wouldn’t have underestimated you and killed you personally.”

“Hmm, well it’s too late to be regretful now,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Not too late. I can get rid of you right now.” When Grayrobe said that, a blood-red blade appeared in his hand. Meanwhile, a blast of aura of the Yang Void Realm burst out strongly.

The soaring aura spread out.

The Yang Void Realm was much stronger than the Yin Void Realm.

Jian Wushuang perceived the blast of aura, the battle intent rising in his cold eyes.

“Good, I want to see how strong an expert in the Yang Void Realm is.”

After finishing his words, Jian Wushuang stepped forward fiercely. He had combined four kinds of sword essence and simultaneously comprehended Sword Way Source. Therefore, he emanated the roaring sword essence at this moment.

The fearful sword essence formed a huge storm between the sky and ground, not scattering for a long time.

...

While the fighting in the battlefield of the Easternmost Hunting had only started raging on, dozens of purple-robed figures spared no efforts to rush from the void of the Easternmost Plain to the Sky Valley.

At the center of these purple-robed figures, a man sat on a Purple Cloud Condor. It was Wang Yuan.

“Wretch! The force behind Blood Feather Tower is so powerful. I should have known that they won’t easily let off the third younger brother.

“Indeed, Blood Feather Tower has taken action, and chose to kill him in the Easternmost Hunting.

“But it’s lucky that the killers are from Blood Feather Tower and experts of that force haven’t stepped in this battle. The third younger brother has a chance to survive.

“I hope the third younger brother can hold on.”

Wang Yuan looked worried.

He originally stayed comfortably in Dragon Palace, but suddenly received a message that a large number of experts set out for the Easternmost Plain. Wang Yuan immediately presumed that Blood Feather Tower was aiming at Jian Wushuang.

Therefore, he brought his experts over here at once.

“I don’t know why Holy Emperor Palace wants to kill the third younger brother.

“The third brother is just a warrior in the Primordial Gold Core Realm now. What’s more, his ancestors were born in the Mansion of Sword Marquis in the Tianzong Dynasty. How did he offend Holy Emperor Palace?”

Wang Yuan murmured confusingly to himself.

He clearly knew that the horrible force behind Blood Feather Tower was Holy Emperor Palace.

Even he and his sect were exceedingly fearful of Holy Emperor Palace.

“How could such a horrible overlord want to kill Jian Wushuang, a man just of the Primordial Gold Core Realm?”

“It’s unreasonable.”

No matter how confused Wang Yuan was, that was what Holy Emperor Palace did.
