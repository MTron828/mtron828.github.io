Chapter 3323: Nine Dragons Killing the Heavens

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

——

There was no doubt that the Yimo was very terrifying.

Whether it was its killing methods, speed, and self-healing ability, it was very terrifying. Except for its low intelligence, it had almost no weaknesses.

However, the Yimo that Jian Wushuang had summoned through the hungry ghost path was not at its peak. Its strength had not yet reached its peak, and it was not so invulnerable. Now, it was being corroded by the Sorcerer God’s blood voodoo poison, the internal part of the Yimo’s body was greatly affected. Its strength and speed were greatly weakened.

As time passed, the weakening continued to increase.

Originally, the Yimo that Jian Wushuang had summoned could suppress the Flame Saint Master head-on. However, under the continuous corrosion of the blood voodoo poison, it could no longer keep up with the Flame Saint Master’s speed. In addition, the Sorcerer God was also attacking from the side, the Yimo was completely crushed. If its self-healing ability had not been greatly affected, the Yimo would have probably been killed by the Flame Saint Master’s powerful attack.

“This Yimo no longer has any battle strength.” Jian Wushuang sighed lightly and then waved his hand. In the void next to the Yimo, the void gate appeared again, and the Yimo received Jian Wushuang’s order, it rushed toward the void gate and wanted to leave the battlefield.

“You want to leave?” The Sorcerer God’s pupils shrank when he saw this. “It’s not easy to meet a Yimo. How can I let you leave so easily?”

The Sorcerer God’s speed reached its peak. Before the Yimo was about to step into the void gate, the long spear in his hand burst out with endless dark light. It directly stabbed the Yimo’s arm and then slashed with force, one of the Yimo’s sharp claws was actually torn off by him.

After which, the Sorcerer God waved his hand and kept the sharp claw into his interspatial ring. Although the Yimo had lost a claw, its body was not obstructed. It still rushed into the void gate...it disappeared along with the void gate.

“Sorcerer God, are you interested in this monster?” Flame Saint Master stood beside the Sorcerer God and could not help but ask.

“Haha, it’s rare to meet a mantis demon, so I left a claw as a memento,” the Sorcerer God said casually.

It seemed that he really did it casually, and Flame Saint Master did not ask too much.

“Well, this mantis demon has been dealt with. Next, it’s Heavenly Sword Marquis’s turn!” Flame Saint Master’s eyes flashed with strong killing intent.

The Sorcerer God stared at Jian Wushuang with a strange light.

“Kill!”

Flame Saint Master shouted. The purplish-gold flames covering his body formed a huge purplish-gold sea of fire and surged toward Jian Wushuang, Flame Saint Master’s aura also reached its peak. He held the long scarlet-gold staff in one hand and charged toward Jian Wushuang.

As for the Sorcerer God, he moved slightly and silently approached Jian Wushuang.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang’s face darkened slightly.

“After using the nine-region seal, the frigid hell, and the lonely hell consecutively, more than half of the power that Elder Blood Wave gave me has been consumed. Now, I have to face both Flame Saint Master and the Sorcerer God at the same time...I have no choice but to use the last move!” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands.

In the sky above, the huge scroll world shook slightly as if it was responding to Jian Wushuang.

“Mountain River map...nine-dragon heaven-killing formation, open!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a sharp light. The remaining power in his body had been used up by one-third at this moment.

Boom!

The world shook violently. In the scroll world above, the nine huge continents in the scroll world were bursting with dazzling golden light!

These nine continents were the vast nine regions that existed within the Mountain River Map!

Nine regions were originally the nine worlds of outstanding people, but later on, they were forcefully refined and placed into the Mountain River Map. Not only were these nine regions vast and tyrannical, but most importantly, each of the nine regions had already formed a dragon spirit!

The nine dragon spirits and the nine regions had always been trapped within the Mountain River Map.

The Mountain River Map was a top-tier universal treasure, and the secret skill contained in it was extremely powerful.

From the beginning of the nine provinces seal to the thousand treasures great world, they were all unique and powerful secret skills.

However, Jian Wushuang had come into contact with the nine provinces seal and the thousand treasures great world a long time ago. Although he had not been able to unleash the true power of these two secret skills, at least he could use them through the Mountain River Map, however, the Mountain River Map did not contain only these two secret skills.

On the contrary, the nine-region seal and the thousand treasures great world were the two simpler secret skills in the Mountain River Map, and the threshold for cultivating these two secret skills was not high.

However, there were more powerful secret skills in the Mountain River Map that required a very high threshold to cultivate. This secret skill was the formation contained in the Mountain River Map...the nine-dragon heaven-killing formation!

This was the most terrifying killing move of the map. It was much more terrifying than the nine-region seal and the thousand treasures great world.

Jian Wushuang was too weak before and had not been able to master this move. It was not until his strength improved greatly in the Blood Wave Realm that he finally reached the threshold to cultivate this secret skill, therefore, when he knew that there was an inescapable net outside the Blood Wave Realm, he deliberately found Blood Wave and asked him to delay it for three days.

During these three days, he had been focused on researching this killing move, and in these three days, he had successfully grasped this move.

And now, with the help of Blood Wave, he temporarily possessed the power of a ruler, and he could fully unleash the power of this move.

“Roar!”

A dragon’s roar suddenly sounded from the scroll world in the nine heavens.

The sound shook the heaven and earth.

The countless experts present, including Flame Saint Master and Sorcerer God, all raised their heads and looked up. They could see that among the nine continents that were emitting golden light in the scroll world above...the golden light that erupted from one of the continents was the most dazzling.

And under everyone’s gaze, this towering continent also began to slowly materialize. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Materialize!

This continent seemed to have come to life completely. It was originally a huge and majestic continent, but in a moment, it actually slowly turned into a huge object!

This was a dragon!

A five-clawed golden dragon with a body that was hundreds of thousands of feet long and covered in golden scales!

It had a noble and majestic body, and it also had a life aura that surpassed all living creatures.

It appeared from the scroll world and directly descended into the world.

Nine dragon heaven-killing formation, nine dragon spirits that had been transformed from the nine regions, had now descended!

“One dragon heaven-killing formation!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with killing intent, and the 10,000-meter golden dragon that had descended into the world instantly attacked.
