4358 Planet Tianhuang

In the desolate universe, Jian Wushuang drove universe boat and headed towards the center of the savage barren land.

In the 10000 years he had been wandering in the universe, he had collected four of the innate five elements Qi. He only needed the third Earth Qi to complete the collection.

Fortunately, before he went to that unknown star field, he managed to find out some information about the third Earth Qi from a group of Pirates who had robbed him.

It was said that the soil of breath was born on Planet Tianhuang, and it was where the essence of the earth was.

A piece of breathing earth was only the size of a palm, but it could grow freely and never be reduced. Often, where the breathing earth appeared, it meant that the third Earth Qi was stronger there.

As for whether or not it had the chaotic innate third Earth Qi, it was unknown.

“If I can find the innate Earth Qi, I will be able to completely mobilize the five elements chaotic force in the cauldron. By then, my strength will increase by a huge margin.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered as he thought about it and rushed toward Planet Tianhuang.

When he was in the Divine Life Palace, his strength was only one level lower than that of a beginner Supreme. During these years of wandering in the universe, Jian Wushuang had not slacked in condensing his super power. He had become more and more mature every day and night. Now, he had completely pushed the sword move ‘daybreak’ to the initial realm.

If this was only a small increase in his strength, then the great Dao of protection that he had opened up in the unknown star area a few days ago had completely transformed his divine power and allowed him to take a big step forward!

He might not have undergone a ‘qualitative’ transformation, but it was definitely at a height that he could not have reached in the past!

Therefore, Jian Wushuang, who had not met an enemy for a long time, did not know how strong he was.

….

Infinite region was the largest and most famous region in the universe.

This place was bustling all year round with all kinds of people. It was like a crossing, and countless cultivators who wanted to go to the depths of the universe would head to the universe passage here.

Therefore, this had created a prosperous and dazzling scene on Planet Tianhuang.

There was no single force that could dominate Planet Tianhuang. It was made up of countless sects and families. These sects and families fought against each other constantly, but they were united against outsiders. Any top force that wanted to conquer Planet Tianhuang would be attacked by them together.

Even the Nine Emperor Pavilion, which had opened all over the universe, had tried to extend their hands many times, but they had been strictly rejected by these clans and sects. In the end, the Nine Emperor Pavilion had no choice but to retreat.

There was no other reason than the fact that they were the three great Rulers who lived on Planet Tianhuang, a small planet in the universe!

Although the three great Supremes were all ordinary Supremes, and it was said that the strongest one was only an advanced Supreme, even a top Supreme would find it difficult to deal with them when they joined forces.

Therefore, Planet Tianhuang had become the most uncultured place in the universe!

At this moment, on a small island in the South Sea of Planet Tianhuang, countless powerful cultivators were gathered for a grand event.

“This piece of breathing earth was discovered by our Feng clan, so it should belong to us!”

“Humph, the most valuable treasures in the world belong to the strongest. The Feng family is only a second-rate family on Planet Tianhuang, and you want the soil of breath?”

“Well said. The three great families haven’t said anything. Is your Feng family qualified to speak?”

On the biggest Island of the Spratly Islands, the Spratly Islands, were filled with powerful cultivators from Planet Tianhuang. There were also powerful cultivators from other nearby planets.

What they were discussing was the soil of breath that had recently appeared!

The Feng family head who had discovered the breathing earth was an expert who was almost unrivaled. When he heard the commotion around him, his face immediately flushed red.

“Hmph, fine. We’ll decide the ownership of the soil of breath after the three great clans arrive!”

The Feng family’s patriarch flicked his sleeve angrily and sat down with an ugly expression.

This soil of breath had clearly been discovered by the Feng family, but now they had no choice but to take it out for everyone to split. It was truly aggrieving.

The others laughed and nodded. They were all discussing in low voices, waiting for the arrival of the three great families.

Even though everyone on Planet Tianhuang was doing things their own way, the three great families still had the most say!

On Planet Tianhuang, the three great families were the gods who held the power of life and death. They had supreme authority!

At this moment, before the three great clans had arrived, a thin young man in a black robe and a white antelope mask had already stepped onto the beach of Spratly sand island.

“No wonder it’s the most prosperous star field in the desolate area of the universe. There are no less than a hundred peak ultimate Rulers and more than two hands of unparalleled Rulers.”

The young man with the White Antelope mask looked around and smiled.

He was naturally Jian Wushuang, who was steering universe boat and speeding over.

Because there were Rulers on Planet Tianhuang, Jian Wushuang’s ordinary appearance-changing skills were no longer effective. The Rulers could see through him with one glance, so he wore the white antelope mask.

The antelope mask was not used for anything else, but it could perfectly cover Jian Wushuang’s aura. Even a Supreme would not be able to recognize Jian Wushuang, so it was perfect for him.

As for Leng Rushuang, she was naturally kept in the heaven suppressing monument. With so many ultimate Rulers and Supreme Divine Realm experts on Planet Tianhuang, Jian Wushuang did not dare to be careless.

After a while, Jian Wushuang gathered his thoughts and walked towards the center of the island.

In the center of the island, there was a tall platform. On the platform, there was an apricot-yellow flag. On the flag, there was a large ‘wind’ character. Under the apricot-yellow flag, a middle-aged man in luxurious clothes sat with a gloomy expression.

Jian Wushuang listened to the discussions around him and squinted his eyes.

Looking at the situation, the Feng clan must have discovered the breathing earth. The Feng clan had wanted to hide it secretly, but someone had leaked the news. Now, everyone knew about it and had gathered here.

The Feng family head had no choice but to discuss selling the breathing earth today.

“It seems that I was just in time. If I had been a little later, I’m afraid that the soil of breath would have disappeared.”

Jian Wushuang smiled. If there was any innate Earth Qi here, it must be in the breathing earth. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Just as Jian Wushuang was hesitating whether to enter the Feng family directly. When he went to intercept the breathing earth, he suddenly heard a burst of surprised voices.

“Don’t abandon you?”

“What?”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and looked back. He immediately revealed a faint smile.

Behind him, two young men and women wearing the same white robes and swords at their waists waved at him excitedly.

“What are you guys doing here?”

...

Jian Wushuang walked over slowly and said with a smile.
