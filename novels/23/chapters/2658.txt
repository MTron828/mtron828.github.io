Jian Wushuang smiled plainly and slowly bowed upon seeing the blonde middle-aged Palace Keeper Si Zhen sitting down. “I’m Jian Yi. A pleasure to meet you, Palace Keeper Si Zhen.”

Palace Keeper Si Zhen suddenly stood up in surprise. “Jian Yi? You’re the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord?”

Jian Wushuang did not answer, but his facial muscles began to twitch before reverting to his true form after a short moment.

Si Zhen had seen Jian Wushuang’s portrait before as one of Crimson Stone Fort’s highest authorities and naturally recognized his face right away. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“It’s really you?” Palace Keeper Si Zhen was rather shocked but soon shook his head. “It can’t be. The Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord should be a Peak Earth Ultimate God According to our intelligence, but your cultivation level...”

“The cultivation level those people previously sensed was due to my divine power aura being masked with a special method. My true level is only at the High-level Earth Ultimate God.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“However, I’ve heard you concurrently withstood three Heaven Ultimate Gods by yourself and wasn’t even at a disadvantage. In other words, you already have the battle strength no less than that of a Heaven Ultimate God as a High-level Earth Ultimate God?” Si Zhen slightly squinted.

“That’s indeed true,” admitted Jian Wushuang directly.

However, the fact remains that he was merely a Primary-level Earth Ultimate God when he withstood three Primary-level Heaven Ultimate Gods by himself and had only made a breakthrough to High-level Earth Ultimate God after obtaining some Divine Elixir Pills later which was what Palace Keeper Si Zhen was witnessing.

Jian Wushuang would not take initiative to mention that of course.

“No wonder you have only spent less than an hour in the Sacred Heaven Road to reach the summit! The Sacred Heaven Road challenges are set in accordance with one’s cultivation level. The challenges you experienced should be set at that level as well since you’re only a High-level Earth Ultimate God. Your opponents in the thousandth step Consciousness Space were only Peak Earth Ultimate Gods with stronger abilities, so there’s no way they could compete against you.” Si Zhen gazed solemnly at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang smiled plainly, “Palace Keeper Si Zhen, you overly flattered me. You know my current situation well with both the Life and Death Tower, Divine Demon Sect, and many others enthusiastically looking for me to obtain the Interspatial Ring on me. I’ve been concealing my true identity all these years while traveling to Danyang Continent from Northern Darkstar Territory just because I want to pass the Interspatial Ring to the Crimson Stone Fort Master.

“However, perhaps it’s not so easy for someone of my status to meet the Fort Master, hence I can only come to Sacred Palace and make a fuzz to lure you into personally meeting me.”

“I can understand your intentions and shall transmit a message to the Fort Master.” Palace Keeper Si Zhen nodded slightly and immediately took out a message token.

An answer was received about a minute later.

“The Fort Master is currently discussing something with Grand Elder Yun Shan and said she’ll come to meet you immediately right after the discussion,” said Palace Keeper Si Zhen.

“I shall wait here for a little while in that case.” Jian Wushuang smiled patiently.

The wait took almost half a day and finally... Ring!

A figure slowly appeared before Jian Wushuang after a light beam flashed.

It was an extremely beautiful slender and tall woman with a rosy cheek clad in an ice blue long dress. She even possessed a majestic air perhaps due to her high status. Although she did not purposely let out a strong divine power aura, one would not dare think of committing any blasphemy acts toward her as she stood there.

“Is she Crimson Stone Saint’s daughter, Yin Su’er?” Jian Wushuang calmly looked at the beautiful lady.

“You are Jian Yi?” Yin Su’er also looked toward Jian Wushuang.

“A pleasure to meet you.” Jian Wushuang modestly bowed as a sense of respect toward an expert.

“Is the Interspatial Ring still with you right now?” Yin Su’er’s voice was incredibly cold.

Jian Wushuang turned his hand to show the Interspatial Ring that Scorpion King had tossed at him before dying.

There was not even a missing Blood Gems as he had never touched it at all ever since he carefully guarded the Interspatial Ring.

He simply passed the Interspatial Ring into Yin Su’er hand in its complete and original form.

Yin Su’er quickly scanned through the Interspatial Ring when she took it and nodded. “three billion and seven hundred million pounds of Blood Gems is truly a great wealth. It’s unfortunately I’ve lost one of my right-hand men—Scorpion King—due to these Blood Gems. It’s only a matter of time before I find Life and Death Tower and Divine Demon Sect to seek vengeance after cleaning up those factions in the Crimson Stone Fort!”

Jian Wushuang’s expression remained the same upon hearing that despite agreeing with her in his mind.

Life and Death Tower and Divine Demon Sect had the guts to make their move on Scorpion King under so many people’s watchful eyes because they were not afraid of Yin Su’er seeking revenge. Yin Su’er indeed currently did not possess the capabilities to get back at them by merely relying on the powers she could maneuver which was not comparable with either Divine Demon Sect or Life and Death Tower at that point.

However, it was not something that could be easily achieved unless she could unite all the power within Crimson Stone Fort.

Yin Su’er gazed at Jian Wushuang again. “Scorpion King communicated with me earlier and mentioned you before. He said you possess a token from my father.”

“Indeed.” Jian Wushuang took out the token that Crimson Stone Saint gave him.

Yin Su’er who was extremely familiar with Crimson Stone Saint and Palace Keeper Si Zhen immediately recognized it as soon as the token was shown.

“It’s real.”

Yin Su’er and Si Zhen looked at each other with a strange light shining in their eyes.

Yin Su’er continued, “Scorpion King told me before that you aren’t a personal disciple of my father, so this token...”

“The token is indeed given to me by Crimson Stone Saint. You can personally go to Saint’s Tomb and ask as it’s because of a deal I made with him,” said Jian Wushuang.

“What kind of a deal?” Yin Su’er asked.

“It’s a very simple deal. I promise him to help you resolve your current crisis once I possess sufficient abilities before helping you to make a breakthrough into the Undying Saint realm if possible in return for the Fengtian Scroll,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Fengtian Scroll? My father had given his Fengtian Scroll to you?” Yin Su’er was shocked.

She knew the Fengtian Scroll’s origin. It was an extremely rare treasure.

After Crimson Stone Saint died, many experts knew that he had left behind a residential tomb with the Fengtian Scroll located there. Therefore, those experts were attracted by it and wanted to enter his tomb and explore. Unfortunately, Crimson Stone Saint had set up multiple layers of restrictive shields to the extent that one would not be able to enter by force unless they had the capabilities of an Undying Saint. Fengtian Scroll had thus been left inside his tomb.
