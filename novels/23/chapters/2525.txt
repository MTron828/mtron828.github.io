Chapter 2526: In For The Kill

Not long ago, Jian Wushuang parted ways with Xiao Tiexin who then joined a crimson-class escort team which she had encountered and left the central area with those escorts.

The Fifteen Prefectures were keeping an eye on him while Jian Wushuang swaggered and appeared around Firmament Mountains, hence Xiao Tiexin could safely leave.

“Mr. Jian Yi, you should quickly go. The remaining fifteen prefectures aren’t that easy to handle,” said Xiao Tiexin.

“I know, but it’s not easy to leave. They have already marked me and probably won’t let me leave this central area,” said Jian Wushuang.

“What can I do?” Xiao Tiexin asked.

“It’s okay. I have my own ways to deal with it. You can find a place to stop and wait for me after getting out of the central area. I’ll find you soon,” said Jian Wushuang casually.

“Okay.” Xiao Tiexin nodded.

Jian Wushuang ended the communication and his eyes darted around and scanned the area.

His soul powers had sensed many bandits in the void surrounding him.

Those bandits were probably there mainly to keep an eye and prevent him from escaping as they were not sufficiently powerful to fight against him.

Jian Wushuang estimated it would not be long before someone from the Fifteen Prefectures appeared to kill him.

“The Fifteen Prefectures have many powerful experts, but they are scattered in different corners. It’s impossible to unite their high-level forces to kill me in a short period. I wonder which prefecture will come for me first?” Jian Wushuang mumbled to himself and looked forward to it.

Half an hour passed by very quickly.

Jian Wushuang was still sauntering around Firmament Mountains.

Suddenly...more than ten tyrannical auras appeared out of thin air within the range of his soul power.

“Have they arrived?” Jian Wushuang raised his head and looked at the nearby void where more than a dozen black spots had appeared. In just moments, those dozens of black spots appeared in front of him.

The weakest among them were exuding an Ultimate God’s aura as they stood before Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang ignored the Primary-Level Ultimate Gods and looked at those two people in the centre.

The divine powers emanating from both of them had reached the High-Level Ultimate God and were very powerful, at least much stronger than Demonic Moon Prefecture Governor and even stronger than Great Compassion Sect’s Yun Zhen.

Besides, apart from both of them having similar divine powers, even their faces were identical.

Both of them were burly and sturdy with cold stern faces. Each was also carrying a gigantic axe behind them.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and figured those two’s identity. “Twin brothers? Seems like they are the Luo brothers from Blood Light Prefecture.”

Jian Wushuang heard Xiao Tiexin talking about the strength of various prefectures, as well as some of their powerful experts.

The Luo brothers were quite famous among the Eighteen Prefectures in Dark Thunder Territory. They were only slightly weaker than the three Peak Ultimate Gods of those three top-ranked prefectures.

The Luo brothers were indeed twin brothers with both of them having cultivated and acted together since young. They had progressed simultaneously in strength and were equally talented. Both of them were close to being Peak Ultimate Gods and their combat prowess were extremely powerful. It was still fine to fight against one of them, but when the two joined forces... Their combat power would skyrocket!

According to Xiao Tiexin, both brothers worked extremely well together and had even developed powerful fusion attack techniques to complement each other. The two of them joined forces to double up their strength such that even those very high ranking Ultimate Gods would avoid confronting them together.

“Golden-robed youth, you continuously wiped out Demonic Moon Prefecture, Heaven Poison Prefecture, and Underworld Prefecture. You have completely disregarded the Eighteen Prefectures. We’ll kill you today!” roared the older brother, Luo Hai.

“You can’t just use lip service to kill me,” Jian Wushuang sneered.

“Of course, we’ll crush you with our powers.” Luo Hai’s face was cold. “Brother, let’s attack!”

“Okay.” The younger brother, Luo Bao nodded.

The two brothers had a tacit understanding and fired their shots almost at the same time.

They were extremely violent and drew the big axes on their backs which were swinging around in accordance with their bodies.

Hum!

The giant axe in Luo Shan’s hands was heavy and forbidding like a giant mountain as it went crashing down on Jian Wushuang with its almighty strength.

Whoosh!

The second brother, Luo Hai waved his big axe that caused ripples to immediately spread out. It gave one the impression as if they were plunged into the sea waves and repeatedly being hit by the ripples.

“The two brothers might be equal in strength, but their laws and axe skills are completely different!” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

He had also moved along and transformed into 11 apparitions. His terrifying speed had saved him from Luo Shan’s powerful axe strike.

Swoosh!

As his Blood Mountain Sword flicked, a cold sword-light seemed to tear apart everything in the world.

The sword-light tore apart Luo Hai’s axe rippled before shooting toward Luo Hai.

Luo Hai let out a cold snort before discharging an infinite amount of divine power, like a giant wave in the middle of the sea. Multiple waves were sent out by his axe’s swinging motions which all of them were aimed at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang used his Samsara driven sword-lights to repeatedly crush those waves. However, there were even more waves coming his way.

On the other side, Heaven and Earth violently shook as Luo Shan charged at Jian Wushuang with an axe at hand. His movements were intense as if the Heaven were being slashed apart.

“These two brothers are really strong!” Jian Wushuang exclaimed as the Stellar Strength in his body started to surge.

Buzz... Majestic divine powers began condensing behind Jian Wushuang. It was the early signs of him forming his a-thousand-feet-tall Golden God Shadow.

The Golden God Shadow was towering over the Earth with its height as divine powers in Jian Wushuang’s body continued to build up.

He simultaneously performed the Seven Stars Secret Technique and Divine God of Punishment!

“Get lost!”

Along with his stern shout, the Blood Mountain Sword’s power soared while his eyes were filled with a burning hatred.

Hate! hate! Hate!

The feeling of hatred filled the entire world!

Transmigration Sword Skill, Third Form—Hateful Path Toward Heaven!

Boom!

Heaven shattering sword intents swept across and smashed into the endless waves ahead. The axe which Luo Shan was waving around had also been frontally repelled.

The two Luo Brothers’ bodies were sent retreating backwards.

“Big Brother, he’s very strong. Let’s use our Fusion Attack Techniques,” said Luo Hai in a low voice. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Yeah.” Luo Shan also solemnly nodded.

The very next moment, a glimmer of light was shining from both of them.
