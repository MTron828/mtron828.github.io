Chapter 5345: Firefox Palace

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“No need!” Jian Wushuang replied calmly.

The Foxfire Palace was a brothel frequented by cultivators, often visited by Dao Lords and Emperors for indulgence.

The young fox enchantresses, well-trained and submissive, could even captivate an Emperor.

Of course, the prices were exorbitant.

A fox maiden at the Mahayana realm would cost thousands of divine crystals, and for those at the Earth Immortal realm, the price would soar to tens of thousands.

After all, nurturing a fox enchantress to the Mahayana realm incurred extraordinary expenses.

The existence of the Foxfire Palace not only prevented the suppression of the fox clan but also earned them a county city, aiding the Great Xia in guarding the borders against the MO Luo Kingdom.

Speaking of which, this fox clan was originally subdued by Xia Mang Guanyu’s grandfather.

Whenever he visited the Foxfire Palace, he received the highest treatment.

Even an Immortal Fox Maiden worth hundreds of thousands of divine crystals was beyond an Emperor’s means; he only needed to beckon, and several would come.

He nearly forced himself upon a legendary Emperor-level Fox Holy Maiden, but unfortunately, she proved too formidable, thwarting Xia Mang Guanyu’s intentions.

Since then, that saintly maiden never dared to step foot in the capital again. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In Jian Wushuangs memories, that scene lingered, and a hint of peculiarity flashed in his eyes.

In less than a quarter of an hour, he arrived at the Foxfire Palace from his memories.

His visit wasn’t just a result of Xia Mang Guanyu’s habits; Jian Wushuang indeed had other matters to attend to in this place.

He needed the treasure, and it had already been teleported to him.

The agreed-upon location was the Foxfire Palace.

Situated by the bustling lakeside, the Foxfire Palace was a towering nine- story pagoda. As the sky gradually darkened, the tower was illuminated with lights. “Your Highness, you could nave at least Informed us before arriving.” Even before entering, a seductive voice reached his ears.

As the voice faded, a charming woman in a flowing red fairy dress emerged. She was the palace lord of the first three levels of the Foxfire Palace, a formidable Emperor-level figure.

According to the descriptions in his memory, this Palace Master had a

connection with Xia Mang GuanYu.

So, when the soft body of the other party approached, he boldly groped a few times, then with a teasing look, he said, “As usual, the room with the ‘Heavenly Character’ number one.”

“Your Highness, why go straight to the sixth level upon arrival? Why not start with the ground level and have some fun with your servant first!”

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang shivered, especially from the softness transmitted through his arm.

“Hmph!’

His mental state was mighty; how could he be confused by such schemes?

“No need. I’ve arranged to meet someone here for a chat.” Jian Wushuang pulled away his arm and entered a room behind a large door with the woman.

The palace lord was somewhat embarrassed because the ‘Heavenly Character’ number one had already been reserved by someone else. However, it wasn’t under her jurisdiction, leaving the trouble to the supervisor of the third level.

On the sixth level, it resembled a massive courtyard.

He recognized the Palace Master of the third level, but the acquaintance was only superficial.

Because the Palace Master here was a peak existence among the tier 4 Emperors, and there were rumors that the Palace Master here had a

connection with the crown prince.

The current crown prince had just successfully merged the Dao, reaching the tie 3 emperor status, with formidable combat strength.

Naturally, his influence was vast. Despite relying on the power behind his mother to be domineering, he still fell short in front of the crown prince.

He was like a toothless wolf facing a dragon.

Clap!

After reaching the sixth floor, everyone headed straight for the room labeled

‘Tianzi One’.

“Hmm?” Jian Wushuang hadn’t reached the door yet when he noticed someone was already inside.

If it were his usual self, he would have chosen another room if someone was already occupying it. However, the temper of the Ninth Prince was not so accommodating.

If there was someone inside, it was necessary to first see who it was. If it was a low- status wandering cultivator, they would be directly kicked out.

Clap!

Jian Wushuangs palm had just touched the door when it opened from the inside.

“l pay my respects to His Highness, the Ninth Prince,” the one opening the door was the Palace Master of the third floor, ‘Du Shiniang.

Jian Wushuangs gaze shifted slightly, and a strand of thought power entered the room, instantly understanding the situation.

It turned out that his elder brother, the crown prince, was seated inside.

No wonder he was stopped below; there was someone inside!

According to the descriptions in his memory, the crown prince rarely visited this place. Whenever he did, he would always have Du Shiniang accompany him.

Seems like a breakthrough had occurred, and he wanted to experience the elegance of this place.

“Ninth Brother, since you’re here, let’s dine together!” Inside the room, the crown prince’s voice carried a hint of laughter.

However, Jian Wushuang furrowed his brows slightly, revealing a slightly troubled expression. Then, calmly and unhurriedly, he said, “l apologize for bothering Your Highness. However, I have some matters to attend to, so I won’t join in this time. I will visit the Eastern Palace to have a chat with Your

Highness on another day.”

Leaving behind these words, Jian Wushuang cast a glance at Du Shiniang. Indeed, as described in his memories, she was breathtakingly beautiful.

No wonder someone as talented as the crown prince would set aside his dignity to come to this worldly place.

When Jian Wushuang left room Tianzi One, he instructed Bai Junwang to inform the tier 4 Emperor to switch to Room Seven.

In reality, all the rooms were the same, but individuals like them, arrogant and proud, cared about appearances.

Once inside, it was a completely private space. In the forefront, below the skylight, a group of enchanting fox maidens danced gracefully, resembling startled swans.

“Leave, none of you are allowed in without my command,” Jian Wushuang gestured, and after giving the order, he sat directly on the soft throne.

His entire being relaxed against the backrest, his gaze tenderly fixed below. “What’s the matter? Since you’re here, why not have some fun with the fox clan maidens?” Bai Junwang teased.

Since possessing Jian Wushuang, he discovered that Jian Wushuang was like a eunuch, only focused on cultivation, and a particularly unique kind at that.

Everything for the sake of ascending in resources.

It had been a long time since Jian Wushuang felt so relaxed. He self-deprecatingly smiled, “Women only distract the sword!”

While the two chatted casually, an old man with cascading white hair entered the adjacent room to Jian Wushuang.

Upon entering the room, he noticed the guards beside him, and for a moment, they were stunned. Wasn’t this his grandson’s attendant? How could he be here?

Could it be?

He found it hard to believe.

However, he didn’t show any expression.

The guards recognized him, “Xuanyuan Dapan.”

The Ninth Prince’s grandfather, the current God of War, a resounding name in battle.

The pillar figure of the Xuanyuan family, known as the Fifth Lord Xuanyuan, fifth in the peer hierarchy but first in strength. A peak tier 5 power, and many tier 5 Emperors had fallen at his hands.

This Firefox Palace was established because of him.

This Fifth Lord had a hobby—dual cultivation.

The entire Firefox Palace seemed to be built for him, and he appeared almost every year. Usually, he went to the ninth floor, where there was a complete cauldron at the Dao Lord level. It was unknown why he was at the Tianzi One today, and next to his grandson’s room.

The guards didn’t dare to ask too much. After respectfully greeting him, they fell silent..
