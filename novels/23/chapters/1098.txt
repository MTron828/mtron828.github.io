Chapter 1099: Golden-armored Man Underneath the Stone Pillar

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

A scarlet-robed figure holding a longsword flitted across the air above the battlefield.

Jian Wushuang held a wine pot in hand, drinking from it as he flew.

“It has been over a decade and I haven’t seen a single person. How boring.” He shook his head.

Though there were a number of experts adventuring on this huge battlefield, the chances of meeting them were very low.

He had not met even a single person in the past dozen of years.

It was natural for him to feel a little upset as he had not cultivated for long and had never been through these many dull days like this.

“Jian Wushuang, you will soon enter uncharted territories. Be careful,” Gu King warned.

“Got it.” Jian Wushuang nodded and put aside the wine pot. With a shake of his body, the smell of wine completely dissipated.

Half a day later, he reached the uncharted territories.

He slowed down and became even more cautious than before.

There, all he saw was still endless battlefield ruins.

“Didn’t you use to cultivate the Scarlet Eye Secret Skill of the Ancient God Clan? You can put it to use now,” Gu King said.

“Scarlet Eye Secret Skill?” Jian Wushuang was doubtful.

That skill could be used to see through all illusions. It would have been useful if the battlefield was shrouded in mist that limited his vision. However, he could see clearly without any obstacle whatsoever here.

“It’s not just for looking through nihility and Illusion Skills, but also for seeing things more clearly.”

Gu King continued, “You’re on a battlefield that houses many treasures. Look at the ruins. They may seem ordinary but they might turn out to be treasures. You can’t see the treasures with the naked eye but the Scarlet Eye Secret Skill can increase your chances of finding them.”

“I see.” Jian Wushuang agreed.

He immediately used the Scarlet Eye Secret Skill.

He began to gain a broader view as well as a clearer and more accurate vision.

Jian Wushuang continued to venture in the uncharted territories at a leisurely pace.

Just like that, two years passed in the blink of an eye.

“Hmm?”

Jian Wushuang, who had been moving ahead, halted abruptly.

“What’s wrong?” Gu King asked.

Instead of replying, Jian Wushuang pinpointed a direction and rushed toward it. After a moment, he arrived in the space above a desolate ground.

He overlooked the ground while beaming joyously.

He had a clear view of the ground while suspended midair. There were longspears scattered all over the ground, all of which were covered in a layer of dust. Their power was also constrained, making them seem ordinary. If someone passed by without looking carefully, he might not be able to detect these longspears. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Since Jian Wushuang was using the Scarlet Eye Secret Skill, he immediately recognized them.

These longspears were magic weapons, or more precisely, Emperor Weapons of Peak Level! There were even so many of them here, to boot.

Jian Wushuang waved his hand at the ground, summoning a wind that blew through and cleared the dust on the longspears. The longspears were restored to their original appearance.

The black longspears were made of a material that Jian Wushuang had never seen before. Since they were identical in shape and size, he assumed that they were systematically-made magic weapons. There were over 120 of them.

“Top-grade Emperor Weapons are worth 10 Fire Points in the Fire Point Exchange Office. That means there are about 1,000 points here!”

1,000 Fire Points were equivalent to one-fifth of the Ancient God Power. Considering the minimal effort he had put in to obtain these longspears, of course he would be delighted.

He then collected all the longspears with a wave of his hand and continued on his way.

An ancient bronze stone pillar towered over the fringe of ruins left in between two bare mountains.

The pillar was huge with a height of over 10,000 feet and the width of a house.

Patterns of golden dragons and phoenix lined the pillar, lending it an air of magnificence. The most attention-grabbing detail was an ancient, grandiose word carved in the center of the pillar.

The word was “Kill”!

The word imbued the magnificent stone pillar with an impressively potent Killing Intent.

An elegant man in golden armor sat under the pillar, his eyes focused on the word”Kill” on the pillar. He was so transfixed that he could not look away.

The man had remained under the pillar for hundreds of years.

Suddenly…

“Eh?”

The man’s expression changed and his eyelids flew open, revealing a pair of eyes that glinted with sharp golden light. He then got up and passed through the wall beside him.

A scarlet-robed figure was flying over from the opposite direction that the armored man had gone.

“That is…”

The moment Jian Wushuang arrived at the huge pillar, he also saw the man in golden armor under it.

“I finally found someone after having traveling through this battlefield for so long.” Though he was smiling, his heart felt heavy.

The token that could sense his allies was not responding. That meant he had come across a Jin Kingdom expert!

“Golden armor? Peoplefrom the Jin Kingdom wear golden armors. It might be a kind of systematically-made magic weapon usedfor defense.”

“Swoosh!”

The man in golden armor turned illusionary as he charged toward Jian Wushuang.

“Be careful, he’s an advanced Celestial Master!” Gu King said.

“He’s an advanced Celestial Master? The same level as Patriarch of Empyrean Glory?” Jian Wushuang’s pupils contracted in shock and his expression became serious. However, he did not entertain thoughts of escaping.

Before entering the Green Fire Palace, he would have immediately fled in such a scenario.

Things were different now.

“I finally met someone on the battlefield and he’s from the Jin Kingdom to boot…” Jian Wushuang thought. “This is my first encounter and fight with a Jin Kingdom expert. I’ll definitely not retreat from this battle!”
