Chapter 3559: Severe Injury to Red Eye

Swish!

Jian Wushuang’s figure disappeared into thin air. When he reappeared, he was already behind Red Eye Master.

At the same time, a brand-new sword mark appeared on the supreme treasure armor on Red Eye Master’s body.

The Peerless Sword Manual...was a moment of life and death!

“This, this...” The Red Eye Master was a little confused.

She had just been severely injured by Jian Wushuang’s sword and lost more than 30 percent of her divine power. Before she could react, Jian Wushuang had slashed her again, and the power of this sword was still extraordinary.

Jian Wushuang’s killing intent soared. The Shadow Sword in his hand turned into purple lightning in an instant, and sword lights instantly enveloped the Red Eye Master.

“No!”

“Shi Yan, save me!”

The Red Eye Master screamed hysterically.

Not far away, Shi Yan Master had just arrived when he saw Jian Wushuang rushing toward the Red Eye Master. However, he did not expect Jian Wushuang to be so fast and decisive.

When he came to the side of the Red Eye Master, Jian Wushuang had already slashed out five times with his ninth firmament illusionary sword.

“Get lost!”

Shi Yan Master roared, and the huge axe surrounded by raging fire rushed toward Jian Wushuang.

The terrifying aura completely suppressed Jian Wushuang, making it impossible for him to strike out with the remaining four strikes.

“Retreat!”

Jian Wushuang pushed back without hesitation and dodged Shi Yan Master’s strike.

Then Jian Wushuang glanced at Shi Yan Master and sighed softly, “It’s a pity that I didn’t kill her directly. But it’s time to teach them a lesson. It’s time to leave.”

Jian Wushuang did not linger and turned to leave.

Due to the concern for Red Eye Master, Shi Yan Master did not chase after him. She could only watch as Jian Wushuang disappeared from his sight.

“Red Eye, are you okay?” Shi Yan Master asked.

At this moment, Red Eye Master still looked fearful. She only let out a long sigh after Jian Wushuang had completely left, “I lost nearly 70% of my divine power. Fortunately, you came in time. Otherwise, I would have been killed by Blood Sword Master!”

She was telling the truth.

She did not want to fight head-on. Faced with Jian Wushuang’s terrifying swordsmanship, she was helpless and could only take the beating passively.

The key point was that Jian Wushuang’s strength had been too terrifying. In just a moment, he had destroyed nearly 70% of her divine power. If stone loathe master had been a little slower…her life would have been in danger.

“What happened to Blood Sword Master?” Shi Yan Master asked.

“I don’t know. It is said that his battle strength is only at the initial stage of the sixth realm. Because he knows a special escape technique and has a time-space type true treasure, his life-saving ability is a little stronger. But when he attacked me just now, his strength was definitely at the pinnacle of the six realm!” Red Eye Master’s eyes were cold. “There’s another point. He was able to withstand my soul attack without being affected at all?”

“How is that possible?” Shi Yan Master frowned. “Even I don’t dare to ignore your soul attack, especially your soul attack. It’s one of your killing moves, and I have to go all out to deal with it. How can he not be affected at all?”

“I don’t know,” Red Eye Master said. “But there is one possibility. He has a soul defense true treasure, and to completely ignore my soul attack, a normal soul defense true treasure can’t do it. At the very least, it has to be a top-tier universe true treasure, or even a top-tier universe true treasure.”

“A top-tier soul defense true treasure or a top-tier universe true treasure?” Shi Yan Master widened his eyes.

In the universe, universe true treasures had different values due to their different uses.

True treasure armors were much more valuable than ordinary attack true treasures, and domain type and space-time type valuables of the same level were naturally more valuable than true treasure armors. As for soul type true treasures…they were far more valuable than true treasure armors.

A soul-defending universe true treasure at the top-tier level would not be less valuable than a top-tier universe true treasure.

If it was a top-tier soul-defending universe true treasure, its value would be even more shocking, and it would definitely attract countless great beings to fight over it.

“It seems that we have all underestimated this Blood Sword Master,” Shi Yan Master said with a serious expression. “Although it is rumored that he only has the power of a low-level six-level true treasure, it is very clear that he has hidden quite a bit of his power, or rather, he has hidden some trump cards. At the very least, he has the power of a peak six-level true treasure within a short period of time. In addition, he has a soul defense true treasure that is at least a top-tier top-tier true treasure. Therefore, he did not choose to continue fleeing just now. Instead, he directly turned around and attacked us!”

“If I’m not wrong, he must have intentionally fought with me before. Moreover, he had deliberately found the right spot. After he collided with me, he used the rebound force to get close to you at the fastest speed. After that, he instantly unleashed his trump card and attacked you. He had guessed that your soul attack would not be of much use to him. However, as long as he got close to you and instantly unleashed his strongest strength, he would have a chance to kill you.”

“Just as he expected, he severely injured you.”

“Well, it seems that Blood Sword Master has hidden himself well.” Red Eye Master narrowed his eyes slightly.

They had already determined that Jian Wushuang had hidden his strength or means. Moreover, they also believed that Jian Wushuang must have a soul-defense true treasure above superior grade.

At the same time, they also understood that Jian Wushuang’s attack just now was deliberately planned and calculated. His purpose was probably to kill the Red Eye Master. Even if he could not kill him, he could at least severely injure the Red Eye Master, it could be considered as venting his anger.

As for Shi Yan Master, Jian Wushuang did not have any thoughts about it.

“A cunning guy. I almost fell and injured him again.” The Red Eye Master’s eyes were cold, and he looked like he was gnashing his teeth.

“Red Eye, don’t worry. We won’t let today’s matter go,” Shi Yan Master said. “Besides, this Blood Sword Master doesn’t only have a high-level space-time universe that I need, but he also has a soul-defense true treasure at the lowest level, which is at the top-tier level. With these two precious true treasures, it’s worth our North Sea Palace taking action.”

“You mean...” Red Eye Master immediately looked at Shi Yan Master.

Shi Yan Master smiled coldly. “I will report this matter and our speculations. After that, North Sea Palace will deal with him and seize his true treasure. We just need to wait for the news.”

“Okay.” Red Eye Master nodded slightly.
