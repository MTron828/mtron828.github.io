Chapter 1054: The Summons

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Supreme Council of the Blood Asura Clan, the most important council which convened every one thousand years, began the following day.

Sitting the courtyard of the lodging perched at the middle of a hill, Jian Wushuang was alone, enjoying his wine as a smile broke out on his face.

“Never have I thought that the Chaos Gold Bead would have such powers! It is not even two hundred years, and yet, I have already achieved the peak strength of the Three-star Ancient God!” Jian Wushuang reveled jubilantly.

“Hmph! That is a Chaos Gold Bead, an extremely invaluable treasure even in the Eternal Chaotic World. And even that alone could not fully illustrate its greatness. Then again, I myself did not expect that you could reach the pinnacle of the Three-star in just two centuries! It must have something to do with the methods in which you trained.” The Gu King muttered. “The methods of Inverse Cultivation is really unique indeed that it is completely of another level.”

“Most other Three-star Ancient Gods would have needed at least one millennium to fully consume a Chaos Gold Bead. To think that you took only two centuries and you are almost at the end of your undertaking.”

Jian Wushuang smiled without saying anything.

Out of the few treasures that he had acquired from Dao Yuanzi, the Chaos Gold Bead was the most effective item that has been a great boon to his improvements.

In the past century, Jian Wushuang has been absorbing the essence of the Chaos Gold Bead to enhance his Ancient God Power.

Now, Jian Wushuang has absorbed two thirds ofall essence of the Chaos Gold Bead. His Ancient God Power has risen to the pinnacle of Three-stars.

The level of the Three-star Ancient God ranked atop common man and Ancient Gods, wielding strength greater than even that of the Dao Masters at the peak of Rank Three.

“I have been meticulously studying the Sword Principle manuscripts of the Blood Asura Clan for the past century. There have been breakthroughs in my mastery of swordsmanship. Added with the improvements of my Ancient God Power, my overall strength is a lot greater now.”

“Despite still being of the level of the Eternal Realm, I believe I might even have the strength to compete with a Holy Master.” Jian Wushuang added with a smile.

“You jest. Although I can only speak for myself, but you can hardly be viewed as one of the Eternal Realm any more. Even in the Eternal Chaotic World, you will also be treated as a Dao Master. Then again, there are many more practitioners and warriors whose powers could easily dwarf yours in the wide domain of the Eternal Chaotic World.” The Gu King remarked indignantly.

“That I know too. Surely there is no need for such harsh words,” Jiang Wushuang smiled and replied.

Leeching himself into Jian Wushuang’s body, the Gu King and Jian Wushuang had become the best of friends. Thus their conversations discussed many things, bringing them closer than ever.

“Ah, yes. I know that I have to discover a path of my own to reach the level of Dao Master and I now possess the necessary requirements to achieve the breakthrough whenever I want to. But what are the differences between the levels of Dao Master and Holy Master, Gu King?” Jiang Wushuang asked his companion.

With only enemies of the Holy Master level wielding enough strength that would pose as threats to him now, Jian Wushuang would definitely want to know as much as he could about the level of the Holy Master.

“Holy Masters are also Dao Masters in essence. But Holy Masters have to apply their each individual paths of awareness into the shaping of their very own Dharmic Bodies of true invincibility.”

“To apply one’s own singular path unto oneself to shape one’s own Dharmic Body of true invincibility?” The revelation had Jian Wushuang taken aback by surprise as he remembered of the two Holy Masters he once fought against.

During his battle against the Patriarch of the Xia Clan, Xia Yong, and the Empyrean Patriarch, they had employed the use of two distinctly varying types of energies. Yet the two energies were able to fuse and coalesce perfectly together.

That might have been the effects that had followed after one had embodied two different paths of martial awareness.

“Everything will have to return to the initial when you have reached the level of Holy Master. The many Sword Principles which you have devised on your own and the two Original Bodies of yours will all be embodied as one singular existence of you.” The Gu King said to him.

“What?” Jian Wushuang uttered in surprise.

“Even my two Original Bodies will have to be fused together?”

His two Original Bodies have been a great help to him all these while.

It was hardly a surprise that Jian Wushuang would feel sorry for not having them both anymore.

“This is a step both necessary and unavoidable.” The Gu King commented dryly.

Jian Wushuang gave a bitter laugh for he himself was also aware of that.

There was no other option for him. He would have to embody both of his Original Bodies as one in order to achieve greater heights.

Just then…

“Whoosh! Whoosh!”

Two shadowy figures appeared out of nowhere, landing within the courtyard.

“Jian Wushuang.”

The strangers were fully cloaked in grey. From their aura, Jian Wushuang could sense that they have reached the level of Dao Master. Clearly, theywere amongst the greatest warriors of the Blood Asura Clan.

“How can I help you, Masters?” Jian Wushuang turned and looked at them.

“The Great Elder of our Clan, Lin Li has summoned for your presence at once.” A cold, masculine voice came from one of the two disguised strangers.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang’s brows raised quizzically.

For a hundred and twenty years, Jian Wushuang has resided quietly and undisturbed in this abode of peace. No one has ever come to disrupt that peace, save for Su Rou who has been coming to visit him occasionally. But suddenly today, the Great Elder Lin Li has sent for him?

Despite his suspicions, Jian Wushuang rose to his feet nevertheless.

“Lead the way, gentlemen.” Jian Wushuang assented with a smile.

Led by the two cloaked figures, Jian Wushuang began walking towards a hill which sat at the center of the city of the Blood Asura Clan.

Roosted upon the great mound of the hill was a great hall. At its top alighted a handsome and richly chamber which was black in color and oval in shape. This chamber was the venue where the Supreme Council convened.

The two cloaked strangers led Jian Wushuang into the expanse of the black chamber.

“We have Jian Wushuang, Great Elder.” The male voice came again and the two strangers retreated out of sight.

Jian Wushuang stood alone in the middle of the space, as he took in the sight before him with interest.

There was a huge round table before him. About twenty figures, obscured by shadows, seated at the table, each of them wielded strong and powerful auras.

Yet, it was evident to him that the figures were separated into three different cliques.

One of them was led by Su Rou, the Asura Lord of the Clan. It was a group of six to seven people.

There was another faction, led by the Great Elder Lin Li with also the same number of supporters.

The final clique of people would appear to be a faction not aligned to either side. But they had the most number of members at close to ten.

Having extensive experiences himself, Jian Wushuang could immediately see that this was an internal strife between different factions of the Blood Asura Clan.

“Third Brother,” Su Rou glanced at Jian Wushuang.

He gave her a smile and walked towards her. In a hushed voice, he then asked her, “What is happening?”

Su Rou gave him no verbal answer, instead, she indicated to Lin Li with her head.

Lin Li had been observing Jian Wushuang, the ends of her lips curling into a wicked smile. In an icy tone, her voice rumbled, “That is Jian Wushuang beside you, Your Majesty? I believe you are aware of his identity?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Of course.” Su Rou nodded.

“Hmph! And why have you kept him here in the Clan when you have been aware of his identity?” Lin Li growled menacingly. “For all these years, the Ancient Demon Clan have been hostile towards us of the Blood Asura Clan. That is all because he is here! Moreover, there is also the Empyrean Patriarch…”
