Encountering Special Life Forms allowed for resistance and escape, but when facing the guardians of the burial ground, there was no escaping. The only options were either to be sealed or suppressed.

They were simply not opponents.

However, the treasures within the God’s Tomb were too tempting. When the passage was first opened, many tier 4 Emperors entered, and upon leaving, each had ascended a level.

There were even those who entered with tier 4 strength and emerged as tier 6 Emperors.

The temptation was overwhelming.

It was said that a tier 4 Emperor at that time went to the Grave God Mountain, cultivated there for billions of years, and returned as a peak tier 6 Emperor.

This story contributed to the long-lasting legend of Grave God Mountain.

Now that the Xia Mang Clan’s foundation was established, the ancestral figure could venture out without the need to guard the Great Xia.

Within the imperial palace, with the protection of senior figures through major battles, there was no one who could threaten the Great Xia Imperial City.

This was their confidence.

The entire array in the Great Xia Imperial City was boundlessly powerful and incredibly strong.

Even ten tier 6 Emperors couldn’t break it.

In the mortal realm, an influence possessing ten tier 6 Emperors was probably nonexistent.

In the Heavenly Court, there were only seven well-known tier 6 Emperors.

The Nalan family alone had three, making them the foremost family in the entire Tiannan and the most influential in the Heavenly Court.

That’s why Nalan Ci had the audacity to host an auction in the Great Xia alone.

It wasn’t just because of her formidable strength but also her astonishing background!

This meant that no one would come to disrupt the event.

Xia Mang Yunxing couldn’t figure it out and decided not to dwell on it.

He had also pondered whether, one day, the Xia Mang clan could dominate the entire Tiannan like the Nalan family.

The auction for the map was intense, with several tier 6 Emperors refusing to back down.

“Hmph, let it go this time. Knowing the Heavenly Court’s style, this map is definitely not unique. It will be auctioned again next time!”

Some tier 6 Emperors had already started to step back.

Indeed, as they thought, the jade slip containing the map was not a single copy; it could be endlessly duplicated.

When the map was leaked, the initial price for the first copy was exorbitant, and as the auction progressed, the prices for subsequent maps became cheaper.

Although some people withdrew, the final map was auctioned for an astronomical price of 6.3 trillion, making it the most expensive item in this auction.

Xia Mang Yunxing wondered why the Heavenly Court placed it in the top ten?!

Could there be something even more expensive later?FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The powerful individual who bought the map was also curious. He privately inquired and, upon learning about the upcoming auction items, his eyes twitched.

Exploration slots for the Forest of Eternal Secrets!

A total of nine slots!

Compared to the God’s Tomb, the Forest of Eternal Secrets might not be much, but it was not as dangerous as the God’s Tomb.

Almost anyone who entered could make a fortune. Although the Heavenly Court had already entered, there were still some tough treasures that they couldn’t handle alone, so they decided to send a few more people in to profit.

The price for these nine slots ranged around 2 trillion godstones each, totaling even more than the map.

However, obtaining the map made everything worthwhile.

Although the first one was expensive, being the first to enter greatly increased the chances of obtaining more treasures.

The remaining slots were quickly sold, with the Great Xia Imperial Family buying one slot, and the rest taken by the tier 6 Emperors.

The Great Xia Imperial Family’s purchase of a slot was obviously for the preparation of the Great Xia Ancestor.

Wuliang Buddha stood aside, showing no interest in any of this.

In his eyes, the places where inheritors could freely come and go required a hefty price for these native Emperors to enter, creating a tremendous sense of superiority.

In the era dominated by the Tongtian Buddhist realm, he had never experienced such a feeling.

As the auction neared its end, another grand spectacle unfolded.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Outside the Great Xia Imperial City, a burly giant, adorned in a blue dragon-shaped armor, was stopped by the imperial city’s grand array.

The moment he sensed the threat, Xia Mang Yuxing soared into the sky, heading towards the northern gate.

Just after the conclusion of the auction, millions of powerful individuals had gathered in the city. At this moment, they were all curious about who dared to disrespect the Xia Mang family’s face and forcefully break through the formation.

Everyone left the auction house, including Nalan Ci. Although she sensed that aura, it seemed ordinary to her, so she didn’t pay much attention. Folding up the Heavenly Court’s auction, she left an empty space and led the Heavenly Court’s personnel towards the northern gate. Perhaps they could witness a free showdown between tier 6 Emperors.

At the Grand Xia ancestral temple and the Great Xia Imperial Palace, powerful auras erupted simultaneously.

The one in the ancestral temple was the patriarch of the Xia Mang family, while the one in the imperial palace was the old eunuch.

In terms of seniority, the old eunuch was even higher than the Xia Mang family’s patriarch.

During the mundane era of Great Xia, the old eunuch had served as the eunuch protecting the royal lineage in the imperial palace.

In the present day, the ancestors of the Great Xia have long since passed away, the exact duration of their demise lost to time.

The founding ancestor of Great Xia, once a mere imperial prince, was recognized by an old eunuch for his spiritual roots, setting him on the path of cultivation.

As time unfolded, the founding ancestor of Great Xia surpassed his own achievements, his prowess now exceeding the previous generation.

The two figures exchanged a glance, nodded, and then disappeared into the northern city in an instant, but the city walls were already crowded with people.

A tier 6 Emperor presided over, and the military stationed to guard the city, though seemingly formidable, was merely for show. Only tens of thousands safeguarded the safety of the imperial city, with a tier 5 Emperor leading the charge. In such a confrontation of this level, the tier 5 Emperor couldn’t even find an opportunity to intervene, let alone participate.

Now, the entire city wall was gathered with dozens of tier 6 Emperors, a scene unprecedented in its magnitude.

Although ten of them were mere spectators, the imposing presence on the side of Great Xia had reached its peak.

“Brother Xia Mang!” Nalan Ci smiled faintly, observing the arrival of the elderly man in dragon robes who came to witness the spectacle.

As for the old eunuch, she didn’t recognize him, only having heard of him, not even knowing his name. She could only nod in acknowledgment.

The ancestral patriarch of Great Xia was the sole surviving member of the Xia clan in the mundane Great Xia royal family.

After Great Xia was established as a cultivation realm, he used his own name to create the Xia Mang clan.

“Today is a bit rushed, I must properly entertain Daoist Nalan next time!” Xia Mang patriarch said with a slight smile.

“Don’t bother with me. Just take a look at the newcomer. If you need help, you can contact the Bloodblade Hall.” Nalan Ci didn’t forget to recommend her own faction.

The Xia Mang patriarch smiled faintly, thanked her, and then left the imperial

The current Emperor of Great Xia is only a tier 5 Emperor, and he dares not leave the city. What if the incoming tier 6 Emperor is hostile and annihilates him? Who would he turn to for justice?

Even if Xia Mang patriarch could avenge him, what use would it be?

The old eunuch also followed Xia Mang patriarch out of the imperial city.

Outside the city!

The giant man in green battle armor stood proudly in the void, indifferent to everything.

Inside the city, except for Wuliang and Hu Qing, no one recognized him!

That man…

He was Long Yi!

Wuliang knew him because all the Emperors were in the Bloodthirst Continent at the time, and they had some discord back then..
