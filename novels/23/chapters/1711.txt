Chapter 1712: Taiqing Ancient Panacea

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Jian Wushuang and Sir God Mad Dog left Sir God Luo Sha’s. As for Sir God Luo Sha… She had already informed the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance.

There would definitely be a negotiation and trade between her and the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance. In short, Sir God Luo Sha definitely wouldn’t continue to occupy Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning alone.

“Jian Wushuang, you have stayed in Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning for at least ten years. How did it go?” Sir God Mad Dog asked casually.

“Not bad,” Jian Wushuang smiled but there was a tinge of regret in his heart.

He really regretted it.

If he were to be given another two to three years, the ultimate divine power in his body would reach his extreme limit and he could finally break through and become stage three Ultimate Real God.

It was a pity because the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning was severely damaged and he couldn’t continue to absorb the power.

“How much more divine power do you need to accumulate for you reach your extreme limit?” Sir God Mad Dog seemed to be asking casually.

“Not much, but if I were to have to accumulate it slowly on my own, it should require another ten of thousands of years,” Jian Wushuang said.

“So long more?” Sir God Mad Dog squinted his eyes. He thought for a while and finally made a decision, “Boy, as you are quite polite to me, I shall share something with you.”

“Something?” Jian Wushuang was confused.

“You should know that I have been staying in Thunderbolt Island all this while, but I suddenly left Thunderbolt Island and headed to Holy Kingdom of Dark Light. There definitely must be a reason,” Sir God Mad Dog said.

“Not long ago, I received news. In Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu, someone who found Sir God Dan Hong’s cave dwelling.”

“Sir God Dan Hong is an ancient Sir God and he passed away long ago. As for how he died, no one knows. It is said that although Sir God Dan Hong wasn’t powerful and he was on the bottom of the list, the elixirs that he refined are extraordinary. He is known to be extremely capable in elixir making, which is hard to come by in Eternal Chaotic World!”

“He once refined many kinds of high-level elixirs and some of the elixirs are extremely useful to Sir Gods. He also once refined an extremely unique elixir called Taiqing Ancient Panacea.”

“It is a very unique elixir and only he could refine it. It contained a shocking amount of divine power. It is said that a Sir God that exhausted his divine power could recover to his peak in a short period of time if he consumed a Taiqing Ancient Panacea. Even an Emperor God could at least recover half of his divine power after taking the elixir.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes shimmered with joy when he heard that.

If Taiqing Ancient Panacea contained such a shocking amount of divine power, it should be quite useful to those Sir Gods and Emperor Gods. If they were to run into trouble, it would be extremely useful.

To Jian Wushuang, Taiqing Ancient Panacea contained such boundless divine power and he could absorb it directly.

“In Eternal Chaotic World, there is a variety of elixirs that contains pure divine power. However, one that contains such shockingly high amount of divine power, there aren’t many, besides Taiqing Ancient Panacea. Even if there is, they are extremely rare. One who couldn’t play a certain kind of trick wouldn’t be able to get them.”

Jian Wushuang nodded faintly as he understood that too.

Previously, it was not that he had never considered precipitating his Ultimate Divine Power Droplet via consumption of elixir that contained pure divine power, it was just that the elixirs were extremely pricey and also, the divine power that they contained was nothing compared to the one hundred drops of Ultimate Divine Power Droplet.

To rely entirely on elixir or Natural Treasure for him to accumulate divine power to his extreme limit, even Lineage of Star couldn’t afford the price.

Hence, he had come to the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning.

“Because such elixirs are too rare and too precious, Sir God Dan Hong’s cave dwelling is extremely attractive. After all, Sir God Dan Hong might have left a lot of elixirs in his cave dwelling. There might even be some Taiqing Ancient Panaceas.” Sir God Mad Dog smiled.

“When the news spread, it attracted the attention of many Almighties’ in Sanctuary Alliance. However, it’s a pity that Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu is Sir God Liu Yin’s territory. Sir God Liu Yin isn’t weak among Sir Gods. He also has a high position in Sanctuary Alliance. He came out personally and took action for the Almighties in Sanctuary Alliance to give up the idea.

“They gave up, but I didn’t. I still want to try the taste of Taiqing Ancient Panacea. So, I came out from Thunderbolt Island to go to Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu. Who knew I would run into you and bring you to Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning.”

“So what happened to Sir God Dan Hong’s cave dwelling?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s interesting,” Sir God Mad Dog smiled, “I received news saying there are many elixirs left in Sir God Dan Hong’s cave dwelling and more than ninety percent of the elixirs went to Sir God Liu Yin. However, somehow or other, the most important Taiqing Ancient Panacea among all elixirs, of which there is a total of nine, fell into the hands of a Universe God.”

“Universe God?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

Something that an Almighty was eyeing fell into the hands of a Universe God?

Was this a joke?

“I don’t know what happened exactly but Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu is in chaos. There are many people who are looking for the Universe God but they have yet to find even now,” Sir God Mad Dog smiled.

“Jian Wushuang, as you need to accumulate divine power, the nine Taiqing Ancient Panaceas should be helpful to you. Of course, you must first figure out a way to get the nine Taiqing Ancient Panaceas.”

“Thank you Sir God Mad Dog for telling me. I shall depart to Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu now,” Jian Wushuang said. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Go ahead. It’s not too far from here to Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu. If you were to rush over now, you should be able to get there in time,” Sir God Mad Dog waved his hand. He himself wasn’t interested in Taiqing Ancient Panacea anymore.

After all, he only wanted to eat Taiqing Ancient Panacea and to try the taste of it. It wasn’t like he needed it.

However, it was different for Jian Wushuang.

When Jian Wushuang found out about Taiqing Ancient Panacea, he immediately went to Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu.

He was really interested with Taiqing Ancient Panacea.

After all, the divine power contained in Taiqing Ancient Panacea was shockingly enormous. It was extremely useful to his accumulation of divine power and there were nine of them.

If he could get the nine Taiqing Ancient Panaceas and consume them, he reckoned that even if the divine power in his body couldn’t reach its extreme limit, it shouldn’t be too far away from precipitating the one hundred Ultimate Divine Power Droplets.

Jian Wushuang hurried his journey at his maximum speed in the spaceship. He merely used a dozen years time before he arrived at Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu.
