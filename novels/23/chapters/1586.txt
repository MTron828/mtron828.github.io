Chapter 1587: Inverse Cultivator?

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Oh?”

Many experts within the big hall revealed a surprised expression and one of them spoke straight away: “Real God Chi Huo, Duan Lingfeng is definitely a genius. However, he has only just made a breakthrough to a Real God. Hence, no matter how impressive he is, it’s still not possible for him to be stronger than you, right?”

“Haha. Many of you are clueless. Within the Burning Demon Region back then, as soon as Duan Lingfeng made a breakthrough, he fought with me straight away. Moreover, it was a close-quarters battle and I did my best. In the end, in just a short amount of time, at best two or three breaths’ time, he forced me into a miserable state and even cut half my palm off,” Real God Chi Huo said.

“That…” the experts within the big hall had puzzled expressions.

“When I fought Duan Lingfeng, I could tell that he had a high comprehension of the Massacre Doctrine and Darkness Doctrine. If I’m not wrong, they have both reached the stage where they could clear the second level of the Doctrine Palace. Moreover, his saber skills are very shocking and his secret skills are extremely powerful. I am indeed not his opponent,” Real God Chi Huo said. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

No one could help becoming silent.

Real God Chi Huo was an Eternal Real God and he would definitely feel a bit arrogant. Thus, he would naturally not lie and acknowledge that he was inferior to someone who had just made a breakthrough to a Real God.

“In actual fact, compared to Duan Lingfeng, that Jian Wushuang… is more frightening!” Real God Chi Huo said.

“Eh?” the experts looked over immediately.

” Jian Wushuang is merely a Universe God. However, his abilities are so strong that they have achieved the level of an Eternal God as well. This is very impressive as he has completely exceeded the realm of a Universe God. If my guess is not wrong, Jian Wushuang should be an Inverse Cultivator!” Real God Chi Huo said earnestly.

“What?”

No one in the big hall could remain calm and a few people stood up directly.

Even the intimidating purple-robed man, who was at the highest part of the big palace, looked at Real God Chi Huo immediately.

“Chi Huo, you said that Jian Wushuang is an Inverse Cultivator? On what basis?” the intimidating man questioned.

“It’s just my own prediction. I have a video of Jian Wushuang fighting in the Burning Demon Region. All of you can take a look as well,” Real God Chi Huo took out a token and with a thought, the video that the token recorded appeared at the center of the big hall immediately.

The high-level experts of the Four Symbol Mansion were also watching carefully.

The first thing they saw was Jian Wushuang fighting with four Peak Void Real Gods. In the end, after facing each other twice, one of them was killed and three of them were forced to retreat.

After that, many Void Real Gods of the Four Symbol Mansion besieged Jian Wushuang at the same time. However, they were massacred by Jian Wushuang mercilessly.

Next, it was Jian Wushuang fighting with Real God Xue Wu and finally, with one against two, he fought against both Real God Chi Huo and Real God Xue Wu at the same time.

After watching the video, the big hall became completely silent.

It was deathly silent!

Completely silent.

The high-level experts of the Four Symbol Mansion were completely stunned.

It could not be helped. Even they were unable to believe what had happened in that video.

A Universe God had massacred a big group of Void Real Gods easily and also pushed back an Eternal Real God.

Finally, with one against two, he had fought against two Eternal Real Gods fiercely and was only at a disadvantaged position?

Was that really a Universe God?

“Looking purely at his abilities alone, Jian Wushuang has definitely exceeded the realm that it was thought he could achieve. Over the many years in the Eternal Chaotic World, apart from a few Inverse Cultivators, there has never been a Universe God with abilities that have achieved such a level. However, from just this point alone, we still cannot say for sure that he is an Inverse Cultivator. There is also a possibility of him getting a very huge opportunity which will result in his abilities surpassing all the Universe Gods in history,” the intimidating man said.

“From this point alone, we are indeed unable to confirm for sure. However, not to forget, not long ago, Jian Wushuang was reduced to a disabled person?”

“Not long after going through the fight in Wu Bei’s cave, news of him being poisoned by a potent poison and losing all his abilities was spread. This piece of news had been confirmed a long time ago. Moreover, there were even quite a number of people who had seen with their very eyes that Jian Wushuang was merely a white-haired old man and he did not have any Divine Power in his body at all.”

“After that, there was a rumor that he went to a mystery land where ordinary people lived and it seemed like he had planned to stay in that world forever. That was definitely his most miserable period of time and he stayed in that state for more than twenty thousand years. It is only in the present day that he reappeared in front of us. However, when he reappeared, not only did his abilities recover, his abilities also skyrocketed. What does this mean?”

Real God Chi Huo’s eyes looked around at the surroundings.

“Inverse Cultivation Test!” The intimidating purple-robed man, who was at the highest part of the big hall, squinted his eyes slightly.

“That’s right. It’s the Inverse Cultivation Test!” Real God Chi Huo laughed coldly, “The Lineage of Star said that some people had plotted against Jian Wushuang and caused him to be poisoned by a potent poison. However, who has heard of such a matter? It must have been made up by the Lineage of Star themselves. Moreover, even if he were to be poisoned by a potent poison, why would he lose all his abilities and be reduced to a normal old man? I have never heard of such a poison before. Even if it does exist, it must be an extremely frightening and high-level poison in the Eternal Chaotic World that has disappeared a long time ago.”

“However, if it’s really that kind of poison, how did the Lineage of Star cure it for him? Not to mention raise his abilities greatly as well.”

“Hence, there is only one possibility that caused him to lose his abilities completely and that is the Inverse Cultivation Test!”

“As for him recovering his abilities, that’s because he cleared the Inverse Cultivation Test and made a breakthrough. With that, his abilities would naturally skyrocket as well!”

“In other words, back then when he had been roaming around in Wu Bei’s cave, Jian Wushuang was only a Universe God of the Second heaven and it was only until not long ago that he made a breakthrough to become a Universe God of the Third Heaven.”

Everyone at the big palace looked at one another and nodded their heads.

It was obvious that they agreed with Real God Chi Huo’s words.

Only the Inverse Cultivation Test could explain everything that had happened to Jian Wushuang. With this, it was enough to explain why a Universe God like Jian Wushuang would possess such frightening abilities. It was because of the fact that he was an Inverse Cultivator and it was not something that could be explained with normal understanding.

“The Lineage of Star actually has a disciple who is an inverse cultivator? Moreover, he has already grown to such a level. They have really hidden him well,” the intimidating purple-robed man spoke with a low voice.

“Hmph!”

With a cold hum, the intimidating man stood up straight away and his eyes were extremely cold.

“Originally, the Lineage of Star had no connection with us. However, this time round, their disciple has killed more than thirty of our Real Gods. Therefore, we cannot let this matter pass just like this.”

“Isn’t Jian Wushuang an Inverse Cultivator? With just that point alone, there should be many people in the Eternal Chaotic World who want to kill him, especially those who see the Lineage of Star as their enemy. After all… everyone knows how much potential an Inverse Cultivator has. As such, we shall let all these people take care of Jian Wushuang!”

“Make the news of Jian Wushuang being an Inverse Cultivator public immediately!”

“I want to let the whole Eternal Chaotic World, including those dark powerhouses who are hidden in the darkness, know about this piece of news!”

“I will make sure that he will not dare to take even half a step out of the Lineage of Star ever again!!!”
