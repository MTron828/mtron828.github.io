Chapter 2167 Self-Explosion

“Emperor Bai, order our men to retreat immediately!” Ancestor Tian Chen yelled.“It’s too late. This battle is too intense and our experts are spread out all over the place. It is impossible to retreat now.” Jian Wushuang said.

This was the deciding battle!

One side had to die!

Both sides were mentally prepared to fight till then end and defeat their enemies.

The experts from both sides were spread out all over the battlefield.

Under these circumstances, it was basically impossible for any expert to retreat unharmed.

Furthermore, the experts from the Three Emperors World had entered a demonic state. They could not differentiate friends from foes. They became even more powerful and attacked all they saw in a frenzy.

Under the frenzied attacks, one would have to pay a huge price in order to back off.

“Jian Wushuang is right, it is too late to retreat. We should find a way to kill all of these demonic experts! They have entered a demonic state and cannot think properly. We will exploit the fact that they cannot differentiate friends from foes and make them fight amongst each other!” Emperor Bai said coldly.

“Yes.” Ancestor Tian Chen nodded his head as he gave the order.

“They are so fast. Quick, let’s work together and defeat them!”

“Let’s not be so anxious about killing them. Keep our trump cards and let these demons fight amongst themselves first. We will clean up after they are weakened!”

“Protect yourself well and do not act on impulse. Think clearly!”

The experts from the Eternal Chaotic World executed their plan immediately.

The experts from the Three Emperors World who had fallen into a demonic state were extremely powerful. However, they fought head on without any technique, and so they were destined to die.

On the other hand, the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World merely worked with each other to keep themselves safe. The best plan for them was to?allow the demons to fight among themselves.

On the battlefield, the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World worked together as one.

Under their influence, the experts from the Three Emperors World started to battle amongst themselves.

The situation on the battlefield was once again under control.

“Is the situation finally under control? We shall wait for these demons to be severely injured, then our men will attack and kill them all.” Ancestor Tian Chen heaved a sigh of relief.

“It might not be that easy.” Jian Wushuang said as he shook his head.

Emperor Bai, who stood beside him, looked grim.

No matter if it was Jian Wushuang or Emperor Bai, they weren’t looking at the battlefield. Both of them were looking at the leaders of the Three Emperors World who were standing at the edge of the battlefield.

“What are they trying to do?” Emperor Bai wondered.

“They are really evil and heartless to make their subordinate fall into this demonic state and kill others heartlessly.” Jian Wushuang clenched his fist as a unique emotion flashed across his eyes.

This was because one of the few leaders of the Three Emperors World was Leng Ruxue.

“This is probably their trump card.” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

“There should be more than this. After all, there is no way they can win if they simply make their experts turned into this demonic state and try to kill other people. They must be up to something.” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Kaiser Blood, Lord Fen and Demon King Chen Yu simply stood there coldly as they watched their subordinates fight.

“The leaders of the Eternal Chaotic World are smart. They ordered their men to protect themselves and will wait till our experts get severely injured before cleaning up the battlefield.” Kaiser Blood smiled.

“Humph. They think that’s all there is to our plan?” Lord Fen smirked in disdain.

As time passed, the demonic experts started to get stronger.

Their power became even more violent and crazy.

This power filled the entire battlefield.

What followed was… Boom! Boom! Boom!

The entire space was basically a storm of energy after the explosions.

The radius of the storm was so large that many experts from the Eternal Chaotic World were caught in it.

In an instant, at least ten experts were dead, and many others got severely injured.

This scene made the experts from the Eternal Chaotic World turn pale.

“Self-explosion?”

“These demons chose to cast self-explosion?

“On no!”

“Watch out!!”

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!~~

What followed were numerous explosions as the sound made nearly deafened people in the immediate vicinity.

One would only cast self-explosion only when one knew that they were definitely dead and wanted to do the most damage to their opponents. This would cause them to release a terrifying amount of energy and destroy everything in the way.

In reality, everyone here was in the Chaotic Realm. They were top tier experts that had cultivated step by step until they got where they were today.

Unless there was no hope left, who would be willing to cast self-explosion?

Furthermore, the power of self-explosion would be around twice the power of their strongest attack. The power would not be concentrated and the amount of damage it could deal was limited. No matter if it was in the Eternal Chaotic World or the Three Emperors World, it was rare for an expert to cast self-explosion.

However, the expert from the Three Emperors World who entered the demonic state had chosen to cast self-explosion one by one.

The amount of energy within these experts was at the peak as the diving power raged violently. This caused the power of their self-explosion to be ten times more powerful.

For example, when a sir god cast self-explosion, the power level would be around that of a top-tier sir god.

In their demonic state, a sir god’s self-explosions would be equal to an emperor god.

If an emperor god chose to cast self-explosion, it would reach the power level of a great emperor.

If a great emperor cast self-explosion… That would be even more terrifying. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

There were around eight hundred experts from the Three Emperors World, ten of which were great emperors and hundreds of which were emperor gods.

All of these experts had chosen to cast self-explosion under the demonic state?

Devastating!

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! ~~~

The sounds explosion reverberated throughout the battle as divine power swept the entire battlefield.

Those experts who were at the centre of the battlefield were baptised by this wave of violent energy.

Many shrill screams and yells could be heard everywhere around the battlefield.
