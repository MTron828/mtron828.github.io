Chapter 3058: Memory Erasure

——

“Mirage Water, evil master, what do you think?” The muscular man asked.

“This is the white bone region, and the Blood Crow Organization is one of the overlords here. The three of us have destroyed one of their strongholds, and this is no longer just a provocation to the Blood Crow Organization, but a slap in the face. Once the Blood Crow Organization finds out about this, they will immediately send their experts to kill the three of us. It is because of this that we specially sealed off this region with a restriction to prevent the news from leaking out!”

“But these people saw what happened just now. Once they spread the news, it will be very difficult for the three of us to leave the bone region safely. So…I suggest that we kill all of them,” the young evil master said directly.

The evil master did not deliberately suppress his voice, and his words were clearly heard by Jian Wushuang and the others.

Immediately, the False Saints in Jian Wushuang’s team turned pale with fright and became nervous.

“Gentlemen, we are indeed just passing by, and we promise that we will not spread the news of today’s event. We hope that you can show mercy,” Jiu Luo said.

Jiu Luo was usually careless, but he was very sensible. When it was time to lower his head, he knew to lower it.

“Guarantee? What’s the use of just empty words?” The evil master laughed mockingly.

“Enough.” The burly man waved his hand and then turned to look at the silent Mirage Water. “Mirage Water, with your research on the soul, you should be able to directly access part of the other party’s memories, right?”

“If they don’t resist, it’s fine,” Mirage Water said.

“That’s good.” The burly man said in a deep voice, “It is true that the three of you do not have any enmity with us. However, you have seen something that you should not have seen today. For the sake of safety, the three of us should have killed all of you. However, I can give all of you a chance now. All of you should give up resisting. I will get Mirage Water to erase the portion of your memories that you have just seen. After that, all of you can leave.”

“Erase their memories?” Jiu Luo and the rest were shocked, but they immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

“Mountain King, you are really merciful.” The evil master glanced at the burly man and did not say anything.

“Mirage Water, go ahead.” The burly man Mountain King said.

Mirage Water nodded and prepared to go forward…

“Sorry, I refuse.” An indifferent voice suddenly sounded.

In an instant, everyone looked at the source of the voice.

The one who said this was Jian Wushuang, who had been standing silently by the side.

“What did you just say?” Mountain King stared at Jian Wushuang with an invisible pressure.

Facing this pressure, Jian Wushuang was calm and natural. “I used to know soul attacks, so I know some things about the soul. Under normal circumstances, an expert who is good at soul attacks wants to erase a person’s memory, which is equivalent to reading all the memories of that person. I don’t want others to see some things, so I refuse!”

Upon hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, Mountain King’s expression turned cold.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis,” Jiu Luo said anxiously, “It’s true that erasing your memory means that you will search through your own memory. It’s normal that you don’t want others to know about your secrets, but you have to save your life first!

“Nothing is more important than your own life.”

“That’s right!”

“Lord Heavenly Marquis, don’t be rash.”

The False Saints at the back also spoke.

Jian Wushuang smiled. “My life is important, but there are things more important than my own life in this world. If I don’t resist and let them erase my memory, not only will all my secrets be spied on, but my life will also be in their hands. I don’t like the feeling that my life and death are in their hands.”

“Besides, these three are not qualified to make me wait for my death.”

Jiu Luo and the others were shocked.

Jian Wushuang’s words clearly offended the three geniuses.

Sure enough, except for Mirage Water, the other two geniuses’ expressions changed.

“Mountain King, you are indeed merciful today, but unfortunately, some people still don’t appreciate your kindness,” the demonic young evil master said with a strange smile.

“Well…” Mountain King nodded slightly. “In that case, let’s kill him, Mirage Water!”

As soon as Mountain King finished his words, Mirage Water, the white-robed woman, looked directly at Jian Wushuang with her clear eyes.

A strange light flashed in her eyes.

A powerful soul power instantly covered Jian Wushuang.

“Brothers of the Heavenly Marquis.” Jiu Luo was shocked.

When the three of them were fighting with the experts of the Blood Crow Organization, the white-robed woman was extremely terrifying. At first glance, those rank one and two True Saints had died instantly. Her terrifying methods were amazing.

Now, the white-robed woman looked at Jian Wushuang and used the same method.

However, Jian Wushuang still stood there calmly in the face of the white-robed woman’s soul attack. His expression did not even change.

“Mirage Water, what happened?” Mountain King looked at him in surprise.

“I have already used my soul attack, but this person… he blocked it forcefully and easily,” Mirage Water said.

“Oh?” Mountain King was surprised.

“Soul attack is good, but it’s useless to me.” Jian Wushuang was telling the truth.

Since he had become an Immortal Saint, his soul had greatly increased. Although his soul strength was still at the rank one True Saint, it was much stronger than that of a True Saint of the same level. In addition…he also had the pagoda of delicacy.

After becoming an Immortal Saint, his pagoda of delicacy had reached the third level, which was extremely powerful. The white-robed woman’s soul attack had been used on the pagoda of delicacy, but it could not shake it at all.

Since the pagoda of delicacy could not be shaken, it naturally could not affect Jian Wushuang at all.

“It’s good that you can resist the soul attack of fantasy water so easily, but it’s a pity that you met us, the evil master. Kill him,” Mountain King said.

“Haha, leave it to me.” The evil master revealed an excited smile, and his figure flashed in an instant.

His terrifying speed burst out, and a ghostly figure appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. A random purple light lit up. It was the cold purple spear.

The spear was unbelievably fast. It pierced through the void and made a crisp sound of air explosion.

“It’s too fast!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Jiu Luo and the other False Saints widened their eyes.

Jian Wushuang was still standing in the same place. He did not move at all, as if he had given up resisting.
