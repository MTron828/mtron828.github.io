Chapter 2925: Empty Buildings

——

“Go find him!”

“Even if we have to turn this territory and the surrounding territories upside down, we must find that brat’s existence!”

“Not only him, but also his family members in this life. Everyone related to him must be arrested and interrogated. We must find him at all costs!”

Although the white-robed bald man was still gentle, his voice was as cold as ice.

The ten Rule Masters and hundreds of Immortal Saints behind him all nodded solemnly and followed the many experts to search at the fastest speed possible.

In the void below, the consciousness clone of the Supreme Emotion Forgetting Valley’s Rule Master watched this scene with great astonishment.

“As expected, the original body of the Rule Master has arrived, and he brought a total of ten Rule Masters and hundreds of powerful saint realm experts… that kid is too powerful.” The shadowy figure was secretly shocked. Yet, at the same time, the words that Jian Wushuang said when he left echoed in her mind.

“If Shuang Er loses a hair or suffers any grievance, I’ll wipe out your entire clan from now on!”

At first, the shadowy figure did not take these words to heart, but now, she did not dare to underestimate them.

“I hope this Saint Stage Master can find and kill that kid. Otherwise, I’m afraid my Supreme Emotion Valley will not be able to rest in peace in the future.” The shadowy figure sighed lightly, and her consciousness clone had already begun to dissipate slowly, as for Leng Rushuang… when the white-robed bald man set up the formation, she had already instructed the cold and arrogant woman to bring Leng Rushuang back to Supreme Emotion Valley.

She did not want to get involved in what happened next, nor did she dare to get involved.

The news of the arrival of the third firmament experts, the core of the absolute beginning divine realm, had created a storm that swept through the entire Nine Realms of the Golden Crow.

At first, the experts of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow were baffled. They even had some doubts.

However, when the powerful Immortal Saints and even the legendary Masters of Laws started to roam the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, the experts of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow immediately believed them.

Especially when they knew that these experts were all coming for Jian Yi, they were all shocked.

After all, Jian Yi was only a Divine Master.

A mere Divine Master had such great power that he had sent out more than 100 Immortal Saints and 10 Rule Masters from the third heaven to hunt him down.

There was even news from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion that Jian Yi had violated the Heavenly Dao and was not tolerated by the Heavenly Dao.

In the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, the power of the Heavenly Dao had personally descended to kill Jian Wushuang, but he was saved at the last moment.

This news also shocked countless people.

In short, the name of Jian Yi once again resounded throughout the Golden Crow Nine Realms.

…

Crimson Rock Castle in the Pill Sun Sacred World!

Dozens of Immortal Saints and several Rule Masters appeared in Crimson Rock Castle at the same time.

The experts in Crimson Rock Castle felt the terrifying auras and were so scared that their legs went numb.

Even the Fort Master of Crimson Rock Castle, Yin Su’er, who had already broken through to the Immortal Saint-level, was stunned.

Oh my God, she was an Immortal Saint after all. Although she had just broken through, her strength was still there.

However, among the dozens of people in front of her, any one of them, even if it was just a vague aura, made her feel like she could not resist it.

This was especially so for those at the very front. The aura of any one of them was enough to cause her to feel despair. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Are you the Realm Lord of this world?”

At the very front of these experts, the white-robed bald man suddenly turned to look at Yin Su’er. His eyes flickered with a strange light.

Before Yin Su’er could react, her gaze had already turned hollow.

In the blink of an eye, Yin Su’er had been entirely controlled by the bewitching spirit. After that, she could no longer resist.

“Tell me everything you know about Jian Yi,” the white-robed bald man ordered.

“Yes.” Yin Su’er nodded dully and then told him everything she knew in detail.

She told him everything, including Jian Wushuang’s origin and the connection between him and Crimson Rock Castle.

Yin Su’er also mentioned the Beiming Starfield and the witch desert region where Jian Wushuang’s move was born!

“Witch desert region!”

After learning that the witch desert region was where Jian Wushuang was born and that he had relatives in this life, the white-robed bald man’s eyes lit up, and he immediately left.

In less than six hours, the white-robed bald man and the others had arrived in the witch desert region.

However, when they arrived, they knew that Jian Wushuang’s relatives had been taken away by three mysterious experts not long ago, and they were nowhere to be found.

In other words, Jian Wushuang’s relatives were all gone!

“All three of them are wearing simple gray robes and gray masks. They are… members of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance!” The white-robed Bald Man’s heart sank.

“Bastards!”

The white-robed bald man was a little angry, but he was helpless.

The Heaven-cleaving Alliance was the most mysterious and terrifying in the absolute beginning divine realm. Their strength and methods were unfathomable.

Moreover, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance was not like the holy region that he controlled. His sacred region had an endless amount of resources within the third sky. Therefore, it could be said that it could control everything.

However, outside the third heaven, his subordinates did not have much power.

Just like in the Golden Crow Nine Realms, he did not have the slightest bit of power involved. Therefore, if he wanted to mobilize experts, he could only temporarily open a space passage under the coordination of the will of the Heavenly Dao and let the experts in the third heaven descend, however, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance was different.

No matter which territory in the absolute beginning divine realm, no matter which corner, as long as the Heaving-cleaving Alliance wanted to, they could mobilize several experts above the Immortal Saint realm as soon as possible. This was what the Heaven-cleaving Alliance was good at, its strength was spread across every corner of the divine beginning world. Although it was scattered and not completely concentrated, it was still extremely terrifying.

“Since that kid can ask the experts of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance to transfer his family members… with the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s methods in the endless territories, they can casually transfer his family members to some hidden territories. Even I can’t find out, and neither can he.” The white-robed bald man’s face had become a little ugly.

If Jian Wushuang was on his own, he would not care if he was on the run with his own strength. As long as he knew Jian Wushuang’s approximate location, he could join forces with the power of the will of heaven, he would try to find Jian Wushuang through all kinds of means.

But if Jian Wushuang used the power of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, or if he joined the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, he would have nowhere to go.
