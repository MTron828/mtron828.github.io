Chapter 1019: Dragon-trapping Array

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Well, let’s set off now!” Di Yan suggested.

“Sure.” Dao Master Dreamless nodded. “But I must clarify this, I will only deal with Jian Wushuang. I won’t intervene in the war between Black Python Clan and Rock Demon Clan.”

“Of course.” Both Di Yan and Mo Lin gave an easy smile.

Jian Wushuang was the reason why Black Python Clan could not defeat Rock Demon Clan.

If Dao Master Dreamless managed to get rid of Jian Wushuang, whom Rock Demon Clan had been dependent on, Rock Demon Clan will inherently be at Black Python Clan’s mercy.

Moments later, Dao Master Dreamless appeared from a Void before Rock Demon Clan’s residences.

Di Yan, Mo Lin, and other experts followed behind the Master.

“Jian Wushuang!”

Dao Master Dreamless’ powerful voice could be heard by the entire Rock Demon Clan.

The intensity of the voice shocked even Rock Demon Clan.

In the valley, Jian Wushuang was practicing his swordsmanship in solitary.

“I’m almost there!”

“What’s the last component?”

Brows knitted, he racked his brains for an answer.

He had assimilated the Coalescence Sword Principle and the Aurora Sword Formation. The third Sword Principle was nearly integrated as well.

But Jian Wushuang could not overcome the final step to achieve full assimilation.

Suddenly…

“Jian Wushuang!”

The powerful voice which had rang throughout the entire Rock Demon Clan reached the little valley where Jian Wushuang was.

Jian Wushuang looked up in the direction of the sound.

“Brother Wushuang!”

Along with Rock Demon Clan’s experts, God Hong hurried into the valley.

“Brother Hong, what’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s the Black Python Clan, they’re here again. They brought someone to help them this time.” God Hong looked worried.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang nodded. He wasn’t surprised, he had fully expected that Black Python Clan would not let the matter rest. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Who did they bring along?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I don’t know.” God Hong shook his head. “All I know is that he is good at spears and has a strong aura that is stronger than most experts at the peak of Rank Three. But he is not a Celestial Master.”

“Not a Celestial Master?” Jian Wushuang smirked.

Jian Wushuang is well aware of his defence skills. To pose as a threat to him, one must be a Celestial Master. Since the person who Black Python Clan had brought along was not a Celestial Master, he had nothing to worry about.

“Gu King, is there anything that can hinders one’s movement among the treasures that Dao Yuanzi had left behind?” Jian Wushuang doubted.

“There is. What are you going to do with it?” asked Gu King.

“The nine sword scars are losing their power, and I don’t intend to stay here anymore. If I can, I’d like to get rid of the Black Python Clan once and for all.” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Dao Yuanzi left a large collection of treasures, there are ones which prevents one from running away. Though the only one you’ll find helpful will be the Dragon-trapping Array.” Gu King added.

“Dragon-trapping Array?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The Dragon-trapping Array is an ordinary spell formation in Eternal Chaotic World, but it’s an impressive one in Green Fire World. The spell formation will cast a temporary defensive cover once it’s set up. Save for the spellcaster, anyone trapped within the defensive cover will have their speed of movement reduced.”

“The enemies can’t escape within a short period of time. With their speed of movement significantly reduced, you are presented with the opportunity to kill them,” Gu King continued, “Dao Yuanzi left behind a complete set of Dragon-trapping Array which you may set up secretly. But some Chaos Gems will be required to cast the spell formation.”

“How many Chao Gems are needed?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It depends on how long you need the formation to last for. On average, to maintain the formation for 15 minutes, you would need 10 Chaos Gems.” Gu King answered.

“10 Chaos Gems for 15 minutes?” Jian Wushuang repeated, eyes glowing.

For an expert like Jian Wushuang, 15 minutes was sufficient to engage in several rounds of battle. With some extra effort, he will be able to destroy the entire Black Python Clan in less than 15 minutes.

“I’ll take the Dragon-trapping Array.” Jian Wushuang made the decision and summoned his Slaughter Body.

“Take care of them for me.” Jian Wushuang ordered, passing an Interspatial Ring to his Slaughter Body.

“Okay.” The Slaughter Body nodded slightly and left with the lightness and fluidity of a ghost.

“Jian Wushuang, what are you…” God Hong and the others couldn’t understand what was happening with the appearance of Slaughter Body.

“Brother Hong, let’s go and meet Black Python Clan.” Jian Wushuang merely smiled, and headed towards the Void.

In the Void before the residences of Rock Demon Clan, Dao Master Dreamless headed a group of soldiers while holding long golden spears. The Master emitted a strong aura.

Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!

In a flash, numerous figures flew before Dao Master Dreamless, floating in the air.

“Is that the person who Black Python Clan is engaging help from?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes at Dao Master Dreamless.

He could feel the pressure that Dao Master Dreamless is giving him. He experienced similar level of pressure when facing Emperor Xiao or Emperor Yun.

“He is likely to be a match for Uncle Xiao.”?Jian Wushuang thought.

“So, you are Jian Wushuang?” Dao Master Dreamless returned the stare.

“I am.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“I’m Dao Master Dreamless, Heaven-level Law Executor of Samsara Temple. Not long ago, You killed our Gold-clothed Deacon Jin Yu. Today, I’m here to take your life.” The Dao Master declared in a deep tone.

The Master’s words were a shock to Rock Demon Clan’s experts.

“He’s from Samsara Temple?”

“Did Master Wushuang kill a Gold-clothed Deacon of Samsara Temple?”

“Damn, a Law Executor from Samsara Temple, this means trouble.”

The faces of God Hong and others turned white in distress.

Jian Wushuang simply wore a faint smile and asked the Master. “Dao Master Dreamless, may I know how are you going to take my life?”

“I’ll kill you right here!” The Dao Master retorted coldly and darted towards Jian Wushuang.

Shoo!

A terrifying noise resonated throughout the Void.

Dao Master Dreamless shifted from his original position to where Jian Wushuang was in an instant. His long golden spears were aggressively directed at Jian Wushuang.
