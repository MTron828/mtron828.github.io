Chapter 816: The Number One Divine Realm Expert Xia Yan

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Xia Yan’s words carried an absolute confidence and impressed many warriors in the Blood Battle Arena.

He planned to fight with three experts at once and claimed to be able to defeat them within 15 minutes.

“Humph, he’s really arrogant!”

“I said you would be fighting one-on-one, so you will fight one-on-one. Zong Yuan,” Lin Wan replied in a deep voice while looking at Xia Yan.

Swoosh!

A stalwart figure immediately came flying out of the audience and appeared on the arena.

The man was more than two meters tall, and his huge body gave off a terrifying aura which made him seem like a wild beast.

“He’s your first opponent,” Lin Wan said to Xia Yan.

Everyone in the Blood Battle Arena looked at the beast-like man and quickly recognized him.

“I know him!”

“He’s Zong Yuan. He has won 100 successive fights against Divine Realm experts in the Blood Battle Arena. He’s a peak expert!”

“He is indeed a Divine Realm expert, but it is said that his battle strength is more terrifying than an expert at Step Three of the Eternal Realm.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The auditorium was abuzz with discussion.

Xia Yan also took a glance at Zong Yuan and a cool smile played across his mouth. Then, he moved and appeared on the arena.

The whole Blood Battle Arena quieted down once again.

“Master Xia Yan, please!” Zong Yuan said flatly.

“Just go,” Xia Yan replied, still looking graceful, indifferent, and proud.

“Humph.”

You’re reading on Thanks!

Zong Yuan said nothing more. After a cold snort, he ran straight towards Xia Yan, like a big Demonic Ape.

There was a Giant Hammer in his hand, which seemed to weigh as much as a mountain. When he reached Xia Yan, invisible ripples immediately began to spread from the Giant Hammer.

Then, he swung the hammer at Xia Yan hard.

Instantly, there was a violent sonic boom from inside the arena.

“His power is truly impressive!”

The audience was shocked.

Obviously, Zong Yuan’s offensive power had surpassed the ability of a Divine Realm expert and was even superior to that of a Step One or even Step Two Eternal Realm expert.

However, in the face of such an overwhelming attack, Xia Yan was still standing there in a relaxed manner. Only when the Giant Hammer was less than a meter from him and about to hit him did he reach out slowly.

In the instant that he reached out, a dark blade light swept straight out.

The blade light, which was as dark as ink, shot towards Zong Yuan soundlessly.

And, it moved too fast to allow Zong Yuan to react.

Zong Yuan was the first to swing his hammer, but before his hammer could land on Xia Yan, Xia Yan’s dark saber had already cut into his body.

Swish!

He watched in disbelief as the blade light passed. The next moment, he fell straight down with the power of his hammer already dissipated.

Within seconds of making his move, Zong Yuan had died.

In the Blood Battle Arena, everyone’s eyes widened in disbelief.

“He’s too powerful!”

“This is the strength of the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World?”

“Zong Yuan could rival an expert at the peak of Step Three of the Eternal Realm, but he was killed in a single move. Is Xia Yan really a Divine Realm expert?”

All the people present were secretly amazed.

Although they had heard about Master Xia Yan’s battle results, they initially doubted its truth since they had not seen him fight before.

But now, the fearsome battle strength Xia Yan had just displayed completely dispelled their suspicions. Not only that, they even suspected that he may be stronger than the rumors said.

Standing in the audience, Lin Wan paled and clenched her teeth when she saw that Zong Yuan was actually killed by Xia Yan with a blow. Then, she called out another name, “Mo Ling.”

Whoosh!

A demonic man appeared on the arena. He was the second Divine Realm expert Lin Wan had sent.

He was slightly better than the first Divine Realm expert, Zong Yuan. He was skilled in speed and he moved mysteriously, so he should be very difficult to deal with.

But when he fought against him, Xia Yan moved even faster than him. In the end, Mo Ling was also killed by Xia Yan with one blow.

Now Xia Yan had successively killed two powerful Divine Realm experts, each with one blow. The eyes that were looking at him were full of shock and admiration.

No wonder he was called the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World!

“Xia Yan is worthy of being an expert that the Xia Clan cultivated meticulously. Like his elder brother, he is truly an exceptional genius,” the Lord of Cercis Island said with a smile, and then he turned to Lin Wan. “Wan’er, it’s time to stop.”

“I still have one more expert to fight with him, so there’s no rush to stop,” Lin Wan said in a low voice.

The Lord of Cercis Island and the glum elder of the Xia Clan both smiled casually at her response.

In their eyes, what Lin Wan did was just a girl’s mischief, so they did not care.

“The last one, Swordsman!” Lin Wan called out again.

In a corner of the auditorium, Jian Wushuang, who was sitting side by side with Yang Zaixuan, stood up slowly.

“Xia Yan really is powerful. Be careful you don’t mess up,” Yang Zaixuan told him in a casual manner.

“I know,” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. Then he flew into the arena and stood there for a second.

“Swordsman, I’m counting on you,”?Lin Wan said in her heart, clenching her hands and fixing her eyes on Jian Wushuang.

Countless members of the audience, including the Lord of Cercis Island, that glum elder of the Xia Clan, and other Dao Masters, all cast a glance towards Jian Wushuang as well.

“It’s him?”

The Lord of Cercis Island and the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master had seen him before and knew his strength, so when they saw him appear on the arena, they exchanged a glance with each other and their expressions changed.

“Unexpectedly, Wan’er asked him for help,”?the Lord of Cercis Island thought, stroking his beard while gazing at Jian Wushuang.

“This is going to be interesting,”?the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master secretly said as his brows lifted.

He knew that Xia Yan, as the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World, really was formidable.

His strength had been proven when he killed Zong Yuan and Mo Ling in succession, but Jian Wushuang… He had killed Lei Xin head on!

The Lord of Cercis Island and the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master had both watched Jian Wushuang fight against Lei Xin, so they knew Jian Wushuang was not weaker than Xia Yan.

But the others in the Blood Battle Arena didn’t know it.

“Tut, tut, one more person has doomed himself.”

“Is he a fool? Didn’t he watch Xia Yan kill the two powerful Divine Realm experts in a row, each with only one blow? Yet he still dared to come up?”

“Perhaps the Miss has offered him something irresistible. He knows he is going to die, but he still wants to try. It’s a pity that he has overestimated himself.”
