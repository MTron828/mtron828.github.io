“Let’s try it first.”

With a hint of nervousness, Jian Wushuang slowly walked toward the two 30-meter-long sarcophagi.

He walked toward the first sarcophagus first, but just when he was 10 meters away from the sarcophagus.

“Stop.”

A gentle voice suddenly sounded.

Although the figure was gentle, it carried an unquestionable pressure, as if what he said was the truth and could not be disobeyed.

Jian Wushuang stopped in his tracks. It was not that he did not want to continue moving forward, but a huge force came from ahead and stopped him.

“What a strong will. It’s at least ten times stronger than the Immortal Saint’s will!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with shock. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The difference between the Principles Master and the Immortal Saint was like the difference between heaven and earth.

Although the many Immortal Saints in the cemetery stood at the top among the Immortal Saints when they were alive and could be said to be invincible, no matter how strong and invincible they were among the Immortal Saints…they were still far from being comparable to a real Principles Master.

Jian Wushuang could crush the power of the Immortal Saint’s will by force.

However, the will from the corpse of the Principles Master was so strong that he could not crush it by force.

“My Emperor’s Order clone must have the body of the Principles Master as a carrier. I must get the body of the Principles Master!” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and activated the star power in his body.

Rumble! A large amount of golden divine power quickly condensed on Jian Wushuang’s body. In the blink of an eye, it had formed a huge Golden Emperor Phantom. The Golden Emperor Phantom was so tall that it had long surpassed the height of the cemetery.

A layer of dark gold armor also appeared on his body.

The third volume of the seven-star secret skill, the Punishment Divine Realm, and the Nine Luminaries Star Armor, the Heavenly Armor Chapter, had all been used.

Jian Wushuang’s strength instantly rose to the top, and his aura also soared.

“Retreat!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold, and a surge of supreme sword essence suddenly swept out.

This sword essence came from the supreme sword essence in the Blood Mountain Sword.

As Jian Wushuang’s understanding of sword principle greatly improved, the boundless sword tree grew to a height of 99,000 feet, and the sword essence in the Blood Mountain Sword that he could guide was even more amazing, now, he could guide almost one-tenth of the sword essence.

With the support of this sword essence, Jian Wushuang’s strength could reach a whole new level.

Moreover, this sword essence was extremely fierce and dominated everything. The will that came from the corpse of the Principles Master was also greatly impacted.

Then, Jian Wushuang slowly lifted his foot and took a step forward with great difficulty.

This step had shaken the will of the Principles Master. Then, Jian Wushuang moved even faster. The will of the Principles Master was no longer hindered. Finally…Jian Wushuang arrived in front of the sarcophagus.

“I can’t accept this!”

A mournful voice sounded, but the will on the body of the Principles Master began to dissipate.

Finally, it completely disappeared.

“Has it been defeated?”

Seeing that the sarcophagus had completely calmed down, Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh of relief. After a long while, he waved his hand and put the 30-meter-long sarcophagus and the body of the Principles Master into his interspatial ring.

After taking in the body of the Principles Master, Jian Wushuang felt relieved.

Then he looked at the second sarcophagus with the body of the Principles Master. He also wanted to take the body of the second Principles Master into his interspatial ring.

However, when he approached the body of the Principles Master…

“Get out of my way, or I’ll die!”

A cold shout suddenly exploded in Jian Wushuang’s mind, making his head sink and a trace of horror flashed in his eyes.

He was dozens of meters away from the sarcophagus where the Principles Master’s body was, but no matter what he did, he could not get any closer. He could not even step forward again.

“The remaining will of the Principles Master is much stronger than the one just now.” Jian Wushuang was secretly shocked.

The will of the Principles Master just now was also very strong, but he managed to break it with all his skills.

However, the will of the Principles Master was not something he could shake.

“They are both Principles Masters, but their strength is also different. The will of the Principles Master is so strong, so his strength must be even more amazing when he was alive,” Jian Wushuang murmured, feeling a little regretful.

He wanted to take away the bodies of the two Principles Masters, but it seemed that he could only take one at most.

“Well, one Principles Master’s body is enough. But just to be safe, I’ll take a few more Immortal Saints’ bodies.” Jian Wushuang immediately began to work in the cemetery.

The remnant wills of the Immortal Saints in the cemetery did not pose any obstruction to Jian Wushuang. He easily took five Immortal Saints’ bodies and was ready to leave.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, during the 100 years when you entered the Bodhi World to meditate, Master told me that if you reach the peak of the Immortal Saint or have already broken through to become a Principles Master, you can come here again. After all, Master opened this secret realm when he was alive. After his death, this secret realm became ownerless. When you become a Principles Master in the future, you must also open your own secret realm. You can come here and refine this secret realm directly.”

“After refining it, you can use this secret realm as a reference to create your own secret realm. This will save you a lot of effort,” Elder Gu said.

Hearing Elder Gu’s words, Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up again.

“Thank you, Elder Gu,” Jian Wushuang said gratefully.

“You don’t have to thank me. You should thank master properly.” Elder Gu waved his hand, and a space passage opened beside Jian Wushuang. “Go.”

Jian Wushuang bowed to the deepest part of the secret realm, which was the palace where Xue Bei was. Then he stepped into the space passage.

Jian Wushuang stood calmly in the void outside.

“I have entered this secret realm three times. Each time, I have obtained extraordinary opportunities, especially this time…” Jian Wushuang sighed and felt quite happy.

This was normal. After all, he had obtained too many benefits in this secret realm.

“I’ve already obtained the opportunities in this secret realm. In the future, unless I reach the level of a Principles Master and open my own secret realm, I’m afraid I’ll never come back here again. And then…”
