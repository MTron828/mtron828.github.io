Chapter 2322 His Words

“Dead, he’s dead?” Lin Yi froze there completely. He could not believe that the Half Step Divine Demon Yan Que had died under his sword.No matter how strong his sword was, the Half Step Divine Demon expert could not have stood there and simply absorbed the hit without any resistance.

But that had just happened.

“It’s a Soul Attack, Yan Que was stuck with a terrifying Soul Attack, and it came from...” Lin Yi looked at Jian Wushuang.

It was because Jian Wushuang’s Soul Attack had immobilised Yan Que, giving him the opportunity to kill him.

“How? Little Wushuang is only a Pure Sun Realm, how did he manage to do such a terrifying Soul Attack?” Lin Yi was shocked.

What he did not know was that Jian Wushuang was indeed a Pure Sun Realm expert in terms of cultivation base, but his Soul Power was stronger than that of a Peak Chaotic Realm like him.

A sudden Golden Light Scripture from the Three Divine Lights performed by Jian Wushuang was what caught Yan Que by surprise.

“It’s a pity that the Soul Swallowing Pearl did not follow me through reincarnation. If not, that Soul Attack would have done much more than injure,” Jian Wushuang said quietly.

In his previous life, his Soul Attacks had been extremely powerful and had had his Soul Swallowing Pearl to complement it.

The Soul Swallowing Pearl was powerful and had helped with Jian Wushuang’s Soul Attacks immensely.

Unfortunately, when his master had sent him down the reincarnation passage, only his soul, the Blood Mountain Sword, and the Mountain River Map had followed. Even now, he had no clue where the Mountain River Map was.

Other treasures like the Five Gem Armor, the Soul Swallowing Pearl, the Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror and more, were all left back at the Eternal Chaotic World.

“Uncle Lin Yi, Yan Que’s dead, but he’s a Half Step Divine Demon, after all. Check the Qian Kun Ring,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Qian Kun Ring?” Lin Yi’s eyes lit up.

A Half Step Divine Demon from a big sect like the Water Fairy Island was bound to possess lots of treasures.

But Lin Yi frowned immediately, and said, “Little Wushuang, I did not do much in killing Yan Que. It was your Soul Attack. The items in Yan Que and the other four Chaotic Realm experts’ Qian Kun Rings should belong to you.”

“No, I’m only a Pure Sun Realm, I cannot kill a Half Step Divine Demon. Yan Que was killed by you only. The other four as well, you understand, Uncle Lin Yi?” Jian Wushuang looked at Lin Yi right in the eyes.

Lin Yi understood what Jian Wushuang was trying to do.

Jian Wushuang did not want too much attention.

After all, a Pure Sun Realm taking down four Chaotic Realm experts with one sword, and seriously injuring a Half Step Divine Demon with one Soul Attack, would bring attention not only from Anjiu Commandery but from the entire Wusha Barren Region.

Jian Wushuang had already gained much attention within the Anjiu Commandery for his name. If word of what had just happened spread, countless experts would have their eyes on him.

“Understood, I know what to do. I won’t spill a word about what happened today. Even if the Lin Family Head asks, I’ll insist I did it alone,” Lin Yi said.

Jian Wushuang had helped his sword principle achieve a breakthrough previously. Lin Yi was grateful to Jian Wushuang.

He knew that Jian Wushuang was in a tough spot, of course, and he would help Jian Wushuang wherever he could.

“Thank you, Uncle Lin Yi,” Jian Wushuang smiled. “For Yan Que’s and the other four experts’ Qian Kun Ring, the items inside all belong to you. If I could have some elixir that boosts Divine Power, or some Natural Treasures, that would be great.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“No problem,” Lin Yi nodded.

Immediately, he searched through the Qian Kun Rings.

He sorted them out with Jian Wushuang. Experts from big clans like the Water Fairy Island Yan Que indeed possessed much richer treasures. There were three Nature Treasures in total. Lin Yi was elated upon its discovery, but Jian Wushuang could not have cared less.

Jian Wushuang only wanted the elixirs that improved Divine Power.

Soon they sorted out the treasures.

“Little Wushuang, let’s wait, the reinforcements will arrive soon,” Lin Yi said.

“Okay,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

They waited quietly along the mountain range.

Xiu!

Xiu!

Xiu!

Countless flowing lights arrived at amazing speeds and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and Lin Yi.

“Head,” Lin Yi said.

“Lin Yi, what happened? Weren’t you being intercepted by Zhuge Family experts?”

“Where are they?” Lin Tiefeng asked.

“Head, we were indeed intercepted. The opponents were four Chaotic Realms and one Half Step Divine Demon. But the Half Step Divine Demon was not as strong as I thought. The enemy was too reckless, and died under my sword, including the four Chaotic Realms,” Lin Yi said directly.

Those were the words he had thought of previously.

Without a doubt, Lin Tiefeng began questioning him. “You mean you killed the Half Step Divine Demon?”

Lin Tiefeng would believe he had killed those four Chaotic Realms.

But Lin Yi alone, taking down a Half Step Divine Demon? He could never believe that.

“Yes,” Lin Yi replied.

He knew Lin Tiefeng would not believe it, but he said it anyway.

Jian Wushuang added, “Uncle Lin, the Half Step Divine Demon indeed died by Uncle Lin Yi’s hand. He achieved a breakthrough in Sword Principle after the meditation, crossing over the threshold of Sword Principle. He already has Half Step Divine Demon powers. The opponent underestimated Uncle Lin Yi from the very beginning.”

Although he had his doubts, as Lin Tiefeng looked across the battlefield, the Void had been filled with Lin Yi’s sword essence. Along with Jian Wushuang’s testimony, Lin Tiefeng finally managed to believe some of it.
