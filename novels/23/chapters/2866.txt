Chapter 2867: Fierce Battle

——

“This saber light…”

Jian Wushuang looked at the dark saber light that was slashing toward him in surprise.

It was the same dark saber light, but this saber light was several times stronger than the first and second saber light!

“The ultimate skill, and it’s a terrifying ultimate skill. In terms of power, it’s much stronger than the ultimate skill, blood coagulation claw, created by my thousand-square-shaped light and the Marquis of Three Yin,” Jian Wushuang praised. He immediately placed the Blood Mountain Sword in front of his chest. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Bang!”

The terrifying power completely exploded from the saber light.

The boundless dark air current crazily surged toward Jian Wushuang, drowning him in the blink of an eye.

“Is he dead?”

Standing in the void not far away, Young Master Qu revealed a cold smile when he saw this scene.

Black Blood Emperor’s expression was also extremely cold. Nevertheless, he had absolute confidence in his own strength, especially his saber skills.

Each of the three saber strikes was an ultimate skill, especially the third one. When the power of the third saber strike was strong enough to withstand the previous two saber strikes, he believed that even if Jian Wushuang was an Invincible Divine Master, even if he did not die, he would at least be severely injured.

Hum hum hum hum the terrifying saber light and the darkness in the sky finally disappeared, and the void where Jian Wushuang finally appeared in front of Black Blood Emperor.

However, looking at the scene in front of him, Black Blood Emperor immediately frowned.

In the void not far away, Young Master Qu’s expression changed. “He didn’t die, what is he doing?”

Jian Wushuang was still standing in the void. There was a layer of purple barrier on his body, which was naturally formed by the Purple Emperor Bell.

Jian Wushuang was covered by the Purple Emperor Bell. There was no injury on his body, nor was he in a sorry state. Even his aura was at its peak.

It was obvious that Jian Wushuang was not injured at all.

“Black Blood Emperor, I’ve long heard that you’re very strong. You’re already at the second stage among the Invincible Divine Masters. Now it seems that it’s true.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. He had already recognized Black Blood Emperor’s strength, and it was indeed, as the rumors said, it was even slightly stronger than the rumors said.

“It’s true that you’re strong, but it’s a pity that the person you’re meeting today is me.”

Jian Wushuang laughed strangely. At the same time, his aura soared at an astonishing speed.

He was originally at the level of a Junior Great Divine Master. Under the cover of the black stone, he emitted the divine power aura of a Peak Great Divine Master.

But now, as he used the seven-star secret skill, his realm instantly rose from a Junior Great Divine Master to a Senior Great Divine Master. His divine power aura also soared, and he had also reached the Invincible Divine Master level. He was even stronger than Black Blood Emperor.

“With the help of the seven-star secret skill, my divine power has increased by several times. And then…” Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold. He suddenly rushed forward and appeared in front of Black Blood Emperor in the blink of an eye.

He waved the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

He swung the sword in an overbearing manner. It seemed that he was going to use his power to suppress his opponent.

Black Blood Emperor was not afraid at all. He stepped forward, condensed his endless saber essence, and slashed out.

In an instant, the sword shadow and the saber light collided head-on, and the power of the two completely exploded.

“What?”

Black Blood Emperor’s face suddenly changed.

“How can it be? The power of sword one has become stronger? And so much stronger?”

Black Blood Emperor was shocked. When he fought with Jian Wushuang just now, Jian Wushuang’s strength and power were on par with his. But now, when they fought again, he felt the power from Jian Wushuang’s sword. It was much stronger than his.

It was at least several times stronger!

“Haha, Black Blood Emperor, Let’s compete in strength.”

Jian Wushuang laughed. He did not care about fighting skills anymore. He just swung his Blood Mountain Sword.

He swung his sword at the Black Blood Emperor again multiple times, each of which contained a power that shocked even an Invincible Divine Master like Black Blood Emperor.

“Damn it, how could he be so strong?” Black Blood Emperor’s expression changed drastically.

His comprehension of the rules was much stronger than Jian Wushuang’s, and the ultimate skill he created was obviously stronger. Even so, under Jian Wushuang’s overwhelming strength, he could barely hold his own against Jian Wushuang.

However, at this moment… Jian Wushuang waved his left hand.

“Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!”

Streams of black light shot out like black lightning.

These black streams of light were extremely fast and powerful. In an instant, they appeared in front of Black Blood Emperor.

Black Blood Emperor was shocked. Immediately, a majestic black airflow burst out from his body and turned into saber shadows. They collided with the black streams of light and sent them flying.

After the black streamers were sent flying, they soon floated in the void in front of Jian Wushuang. It was then that they could clearly see that the black streamers were black magic swords emitting a powerful aura and the power of reincarnation.

The black magic swords were arranged in a row and floated in the air. There were a total of 18 of them!

The 18 underworld blood magic swords, which had reached the level of a superior divine treasure, floated in the air. With a thought from Jian Wushuang, the 18 black magic swords condensed together at an amazing speed.

Buzz!

A faint hum, like the sound of a sword, slowly sounded in the world.

A brand-new, five-meter-long black divine sword with a very thin body suddenly appeared in the world.

The eighteen black divine swords condensed into one!

“Black Blood Emperor, try the power of my sword formation.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and pointed in the direction of the Black Blood Emperor.

“Go!”

In an instant, the five-meter-long black divine sword, which was emitting a shocking power, pierced through the void and shot out.

The black divine sword left a perfect arc in the void, giving people the feeling that it was a beautiful black sword light.

The sword light was absolutely beautiful and intoxicating.

It was the third level of the Samsara sword formation, samsara intoxication!

When Jian Wushuang was only at the Peak Divine Master level in the Pill Sun Sacred World, he had relied on the third level of the sword formation to fight against the Marquis of Three Yin.

Now that he had broken through from the Peak Divine Master level to the initial Great Divine Master level, the power of the sword formation had been greatly enhanced.
