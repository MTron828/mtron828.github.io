Chapter 626: The Three Magnates

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Tens of thousands of people from our Ancient World participated in the battle, many more than that of the Eternal World.

“Nevertheless, our overall level of power is less than theirs.

They possess superior resources for cultivation, so they have a great advantage over us, allowing them to gain more power.

The 900 winners of the first round are the top talents among them and it’s true that only a hundred of us could be their match.”

Jian Wushuang sighed in private.

“The host was right, it’s a fair battle.”

In less than half an hour, all those who failed the first round had left.

The number of those who remained in the two Drill Grounds amounted to about a thousand.

They stood on two opposing sides, the people from the Eternal World on one side, while those from the Ancient World were on the other side. However, the next round would be different from the first round because they would encounter opponents from both sides.

“Listen.”

The host spoke again. “All of you are definitely geniuses of the Firmament Territory since you have survived the first round, but the second round will take place in 10 days. Please prepare yourselves.”

“In 10 days?” The geniuses were surprised.

“I’ll give you the information on all the sects in the Firmament Territory so you can consider which one you want to join while you are preparing for the following battles. Of course, you should know that your performance in the upcoming battles will decide whether you can achieve your wish or not. So, geniuses, show your power as much as you can and it may result in you receiving an invitation from the sects.”

An intense discussion immediately broke out among the geniuses when the words fell.

“Sword Emperor.”

Xue Feng walked over to Jian Wushuang.

“Xue Feng.” Jian Wushuang gave her a smile.

“I heard that you managed to survive Feng’s attack,” Xue Feng said with a strange expression.

“I was just lucky,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“I don’t think it’s luck that you created a Superior Secret Skill.” Xue Feng curled her lip and continued, “It looks like I have to watch my back if I meet you in the future rounds.”

“Well.” Jian Wushuang forced a smile. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Right then, both Jian Wushuang and Xue Feng felt several disdainful eyes fall on them.

“Those guys...”

Xue Feng gritted her teeth and looked toward the geniuses of the Eternal World. That was where she felt the stares coming from.

“They are really arrogant! How annoying!” She growled.

“Yes, they look down on us from the bottom of their hearts since they have more advantages than us.” Jian Wushuang echoed her thoughts while frowning.

“But we have to admit that they are more powerful than us. Even Feng, the strongest one among us, is probably no match for the top 10 experts among them,” Xue Feng said dejectedly.

Her conclusion made Jian Wushuang narrow his eyes.

He had learned of Feng’s incredible power, so it was really astonishing to know that Feng, who had defeated Xue Feng with one attack, could not make it into the top 10.

“Maybe it’s true.”?Jian Wushuang sighed in secret.

While the geniuses were chatting with each other, someone came and handed them a file containing detailed information on all the sects.

The geniuses immediately started reading through the information as soon as they received it.

After all, the 100 geniuses from the Ancient World knew very little about the Eternal World and the sects, so they read the files with their full attention.

Jian Wushuang was no exception.

“The Firmament Territory covers a large area in the Eternal World and it’s home to numerous sects and forces, both strong and weak ones.

“Among the forces, there are three magnates—Cloud Sea Asgard, the Immortal Dynasty, and the Boundless Demon Sect!

“Those three sects possess the best resources and have the most disciples in the Firmament Territory. Men of talent appear there in large numbers with every generation. In short, they are the most powerful sects in the whole territory.”

As the geniuses were reading, the descriptions about the three magnates caused their eyes to light up.

They knew that the stronger a sect was the more resources it could provide them.

All they wanted from the Firmament Territory Feast was to join a powerful sect, so it was obvious that the three magnates would be their best choices.

However, the strong sects always had a higher standard for their disciples. Normal geniuses would never enter their eyes, only the truly exceptional ones could win their favor, like the top 10 geniuses.

“It’s too hard for me to reach the standards of the three magnates. I should just give up.”

“As for what has been written in the file, only the very best will be accepted as inner disciples. Even becoming an outer disciple requires one to enter the top 50. Obviously, I’m far from their requirements.”

“Take it easy. There are other sects besides the three magnates. We may still have some hope.”

The Drill Ground was abuzz with discussion.

After carefully reading through the information of the magnates, Jian Wushuang turned to the nine other top sects.

Those sects might not be as powerful as the magnates, but they still possess a certain level of strength.

The best of them was a sect called the Ancient Sect.
