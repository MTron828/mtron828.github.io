Chapter 1063: Supervisor

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Jian Wushuang, Celestial Master Lei Yi, please explain yourselves.”

Silence fell over the drill ground after Ding Mo finished speaking.

The experts present waited to see what would happen next.

The pale-faced Lei Yi shot Jian Wushuang a cold glare before gritting his teeth and saying, “Elder Ding Mo, the crowd can be my witness. Jian Wushuang was the one who attacked me first.”

“Is that true?” Ding Mo turned to Jian Wushuang.

“I’m the one who attacked first,” Jian Wushuang said, acknowledging his fault in an indifferent voice.

There was nothing worth denying over. This was the truth.

“Jian Wushuang, you started a fight and reduced the drill ground to ruins in the inauguration ceremony of our new Supervisor. How dare you belittle our Supervisor and Samsara Temple like this?” Ding Mo asked in a reproachful tone.

While Ding Mo admired Jian Wushuang’s talent, he couldn’t just turn a blind eye to what he had done. Today, Jian Wushuang’s rash act did offend their new Supervisor.

“I did act recklessly today. I’d like to pay for what I have done.” Jian Wushuang apologized with a serious expression as he looked at Ding Mo. “But I’d never regret my actions. Since I now have the intention to kill, I’ll never quit until I die!”

“Celestial Master Lei Yi, I might not be able to end your life in the inauguration ceremony today but remember that I’ll go after you once the ceremony is over. I’ll hunt you down wherever you run and hack you into ten thousand pieces. Even if you hide in the Ancient Demon Clan forever, I’ll wait until I become a Dao Master and slaughter the clan to find you. When that happens, you’ll be as good as dead!”

Jian Wushuang’s words that were full of strong Killing Intent reverberated throughout the drill ground.

It startled the experts from the different forces.

Lei Yi’s face turned pale.

He hadn’t taken Jian Wushuang seriously before their fight and his words earlier were intended to humiliate the latter. More importantly, he had wanted to agitate Jian Wushuang so that he could get a chance to take him out.

He did manage to infuriate Jian Wushuang enough to attack him. His plan had succeeded.

But he was surprised to find Jian Wushuang to be this strong.

Jian Wushuang had defeated him in a direct confrontation.

He couldn’t help quaking in his boots after hearing Jian Wushuang’s threat.

Jian Wushuang’s strength was above his and to make things worse, he also had great potential. If such a dangerous man made up his mind to pursue him, it would definitely be his nightmare.

“Hunt me down? You better worry about how to save yourself after offending our Supervisor in public. Did you think you can easily placate him?” Lei Yi snorted.

He was an irritable and conceited person.

He might fear Jian Wushuang but he was unwilling to bow down to him.

“Jian Wushuang, no one can challenge the Supervisor’s prestige,” Ding Mo added. “Of course, it depends upon his mood. If he’s in a good mood, he’ll spare you with just an apology. Otherwise, he might just take your life in a fit of anger. Take care.”

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes but showed no anxiety on his face.

He was stronger now. Even if the Supervisor did not forgive him, he could still keep himself safe.

He did not have to act cowardly now that he was equipped with profound cultivation and skills.

Besides, it was Celestial Master Lei Yi who pushed his buttons.

“Little lowborn bastard with weak bloodline, the son of nobody from the Ancient World?”

“Not only did he humiliate me, but he also degraded my father!”

“He deserves to die!”?Jian Wushuang growled.

Just then…

“Here comes the Supervisor!”

The sudden loud sound caused a commotion in the drill ground.

Most of the experts looked in the direction of the voice.

So did Jian Wushuang and Lei Yi. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“The Supervisor is here. I’d like to see how this fellow dies!”?Lei Yi snorted.

A silver-haired man, escorted by dozens of golden-robed servants and two Elders, slowly walked up to them.

He was dressed in a rugged indigo-colored robe and emanated no special aura. He appeared utterly ordinary upon first glance.

Many experts were surprised when they saw the man in the indigo-colored robe.

“Such a distinguished temperament!”

“How unworldly!”

“Is he the new Supervisor of the Samsara Temple? He’s extraordinary, as expected.”

These experts had met countless big shots in their life and the moment they saw the indigo-robed man, they could tell that he was a remarkable figure.

His disposition distinguished him from the rest.

He looked aloof as if he was completely removed from any worldly affairs.

The insignificant mortals, overlords, experts or Celestial Masters from the Samsara Continent seemed to make no difference to him.

His exceeding composure was far beyond anyone’s reach.

The indigo-robed man who stood in the center of the drill ground was on the receiving end of the crowd’s attention. With a wave of his hand, a black throne emerged out of thin air behind him. He took a seat in a carefree manner and looking at the crowd with his profound eyes.

Those met his eyes were left in awe.

The man was able to make others yield to him with his indifference and unworldly disposition without taking action or deliberately emanating his aura.

“I heard that this new Supervisor is the source of many legends and that it took him only some 2,000 years to reach the ninth phase of Reincarnator. He’s the only one to achieve that in such a short amount of time!”

“Only 2,000 years? How is that even possible?”

“It’s true! I also heard that the Samsara Temple Master deeply favors this Supervisor. Rumors even have it that the Samsara Temple Master has taken him as his personal disciple!”

“The Samsara Temple Master’s personal disciple? That’s…”

The crowd continued discussing the new Supervisor.

However, the indigo-robed man wasn’t interested in their compliments. He swept his gaze through the experts before finally settling on Jian Wushuang.

When he found Jian Wushuang, a profound, elusive smile appeared on his face.

Jian Wushuang remained still while meeting the indigo-robed man’s stare. The man was the only one reflected in his eyes.
