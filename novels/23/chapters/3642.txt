Chapter 3647: Arrived in the Demon Realm

“Under normal circumstances, when the Heaven and Earth Secret Realm is destroyed, the power of the will given to it will completely collapse. This is certainly an unprecedented heavy blow for an ordinary Principles Master, but for you, a perfect life, it’s nothing more than the loss of some divine power. However, you have gained the experience of refining the Heaven and Earth Secret Realm. Next, you will come here and refine this small astral world. It will be twice the result with half the effort,” Xuan Yi said.

“I see. In that case, I’ll come here after refining a Heaven and Earth Secret Realm,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Go.” Xuan Yi waved his hand.

Jian Wushuang bowed respectfully and returned to his original body.

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes again outside the huge seal formation.

“My young friend, how is it? Can you break the seal formation?” Temporal Temple Master looked over immediately.

“Yes, I can, but there are still some steps to be taken.” Jian Wushuang told them about how he saw Xuan Yi’s remnant soul in the seal and their conversation.

After hearing this, both Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master and Temporal Temple Master were shocked.

“No wonder Xuan Yi told us to find a way to keep the seal working before he died. I see.”

“The purpose of the seal formation is not only to protect the experts left behind by the Seven Star Mysterious Sect, but also to allow you to better possess the Divine Beginning Realm.” Temporal Temple Master sighed quietly.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, you’re looking for an ownerless Secret Realm to refine, right?” Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master looked over.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“It’s easy. Although it’s difficult to find an ownerless Secret Realm under normal circumstances, since you need it, we can find a Principles Master who has opened the Secret Realm and kill him. Then we can forcibly take his Secret Realm,” the Heaven-cleaving Alliance Master said.

“No need.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand. “I happen to know where there is an ownerless Secret Realm that is suitable for me to refine. I once promised the owner of the Secret Realm that I would do something for him. Although I have done all these things, I haven’t returned to give him an answer. It’s a good time for me to go there.”

Jian Wushuang was talking about the Xue Bei Secret Realm!

Back then, he had obtained a great opportunity in the Xue Bei Secret Realm. He had indeed promised Xue Bei to help him go to the bloodline of the Blood Ancestor in the Heaven Ancestor Daoist Sect to accomplish some things. He had already done that. At that time, Xue Bei had told him to go back there and refine the Xue Bei Secret Realm, after he became a Principles Master, he could go back there and refine the Xue Bei Secret Realm.

Now that Jian Wushuang had become a Principles Master and his strength was comparable to a Ruler, the Xue Bei Secret Realm was no longer attractive to him. However, now that he needed to refine a Secret Realm to accumulate experience, the Xue Bei Secret Realm became his first choice.

He could also go back and give an answer to the Xue Bei Secret Realm.

“The Xue Bei Secret Realm is in the Endless Territory. Since I’m going to the Endless Territory, I might as well go to the Third Heaven and pick up my parents,” Jian Wushuang thought.

His parents, Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin, originally came from the Endless Territory. They were forced to come to the Third Heaven because of him. It had been more than 100,000 years, Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin definitely wanted to go back to the Endless Territory and visit their hometown.

“My young friend, since you already have a Heaven and Earth Secret Realm that you can refine, you can go. With your current strength, you can do whatever you want in the Divine Beginning Realm. There’s no need for us to remind you anymore,” Temporal Temple Master said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. Soon, he left the Fourth Heaven and headed toward the Third Heaven.

In the Divine Beginning Realm, Jian Wushuang’s every move was watched by the will of heaven. When Jian Wushuang arrived at the Third Heaven, the will of heaven immediately informed the three masters of the Saint Realm about it.

The three masters of the Saint Realm immediately looked as if they were facing a great enemy.

“My lords, Heavenly Sword Marquis has already arrived at the Third Heaven. It is very likely that he has come directly to the three Saint Realms.” The three masters of the Saint Realm stood there respectfully, their faces full of anxiety.

“What are you three worried about?”

The three masters who were sitting high above looked down with cold eyes. “Even if Heavenly Sword Marquis’ power isn’t restricted in the Divine Beginning Realm, he’s only one person. His battle strength is at most comparable to an ordinary primary Ruler. With his battle strength, even if the three of us are restricted, as long as we work together, we can still suppress him.”

“You’re right. If Heavenly Sword Marquis is alone, there’s no need to worry at all. If he comes and the three of us work together, he definitely won’t be able to gain any advantage. If he’s a bit careless and I find an opportunity to use that divine weapon, I might even be able to kill him.” The white-haired elder smiled.

“You can leave now. Just keep an eye on Heavenly Sword Marquis. There’s no need to make a fuss.” The evil-looking young man waved his hand.

The three masters of the Saint Realm were still worried, but they had no choice but to leave.

The three masters of the Saint Realm were worried that Jian Wushuang’s purpose in coming to the Third Heaven was to attack the three Saint Realms. However, they did not know that Jian Wushuang had no intention of attacking the three Saint Realms directly. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After arriving at the Third Heaven, he headed straight for the Demon Realm.

The Floating-fire City was one of the eight cities in the Demon Realm that could be called the ‘Pure Land’!

When Jian Wushuang first came to the Demon Realm, his parents in this life, as well as his eldest sister and second brother, all lived in the Floating-fire City.

However, when he came to the Floating-fire City again, he did not find any trace of his parents.

“They are not in the Floating-fire City?” Jian Wushuang was not surprised.

He had heard from Temporal Temple Master that one of the biggest changes in the Divine Beginning Realm over the years was the rise of the Nine-tailed Clan in the Demon Realm. The rise of the Nine-tailed Clan was unstoppable, forcing the other three peak clans to join forces, they could only fight together.

The eight cities in the Demon Realm were still ‘Pure Land’ on the surface, but in the dark, the Nine-tailed Clan and the other three peak clans were in charge, now that the Nine-tailed Clan was fighting with the three peak clans, it was no longer safe for his parents to stay in the Floating-fire City.

Therefore, if nothing went wrong, his parents, his elder sister, and his second brother should be in the Nine-tailed Clan and protected by them.

“Let’s go to the Nine-tailed Clan.”

Jian Wushuang immediately flew toward the Nine-tailed Clan.
