Chapter 878: Sword Heart, the Fifth Level

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The palace of Yin Thunder, located in the north of Star Island, was almost uninhabited.

When Jian Wushuang took the token and came here, he was amazed at what he saw.

It was far from a palace. Instead, it was more of a vast Thunder Sea.

At the sight of this, he saw the whole palace inside was crowded with black Thunderbolts. It was a Thunder Sea, a dark Thunder Sea.

Each of those black Thunderbolts in the Thunder Sea was astonishingly horrible and powerful.

“Good boy! How could it possible for me to go into the Thunder Sea and produce my first Divine Yin Thunder by being devoured by numerous Thunderbolts and absorbing the power of them?” Staring at the Thunder Sea, Jian Wushuang felt a bit breathless.

The technique of cultivating Divine Yin Thunder was very wild, but people still stood a good chance of acquiring it.

“Whoosh—”

“Okay, go!”

Jian Wushuang breathed out softly as he hovered into the dark Thunder Sea.

Upon entering the Thunder Sea, he was being attacked by the black Thunderbolts. Thwack! Thwack! The Thunderbolts, one after another, throbbed on his body with a flow of violent power permeating inside him.

When he entered the Thunder Sea, his body got frozen up and couldn’t move at all. At the same time, an ever-increasingly sharp pain grew violently inside his body.

“Psst…”

Jian Wushuang grimaced painfully as his eyes seemed extremely calm. Under such a sharp pain, he began performing the technique of Divine Yin Thunder.

As the technique was performed, the violent power inside Jian Wushuang’s body was pinned down. Although it was likewise violent, Jian Wushuang obvious felt less painful.

One day later, some power of Thunderbolt was added in Jian Wushuang’s body.

This power of Thunderbolt was feeble. It was hard to preserve it into his body, let alone to stimulate the attacking power.

“Is it Divine Yin Thunder?” Jian Wushuang just felt weak power of Thunderbolt, but a smile gradually grew on his face. “Although it’s weak, and there is a major gap exists between it and a complete Divine Yin Thunder which can be used to attack, it can be considered a starting point at least for now.”

Even with the help of Thunder Sea, one can’t cultivate Divine Yin Thunder in one day. It took a lot of time.

It took time to gradually transform the power of Thunderbolt inside.

In the dark Thunder Sea, an odd look came into Jian Wushuang’s eyes and then his Slaughter Body immediately appeared behind him.

His World Body would stay at Thunder Sea to cultivate Divine Yin Thunder, while his Slaughter Body would go to Star Jade Wall meditating the swordsmanship.

The two Original Body collaborated with each other so that the progress had been fast.

Behind Star Jade Wall, Jian Wushuang found a good place to sit down with his eyes staring at the profound swordsmanship patterns on the wall.

Jian Wushuang carefully observed every one of the 16 patterns and explored the spectacular swordsmanship included in the patterns.

After skimming through them, Jian Wushuang’s eyes focused on one pattern.

It seemed to be the most profound and appealing swordsmanship for him.

Jian Wushuang looked at it again.

The pattern changed.

It was in a dark, vast Void.

All the same, there stood a middle-aged man who wore a straw rain cape and a bamboo hat and held a cyan longsword on his hand.

In front of him, there was a gigantic red Exotic Beast, more than 300 meters tall.

That middle-aged man was like an ant compared with the Exotic Beast.

At this moment, he suddenly drew his sword.

An ordinary strike of sword.

A plain strike was steadily wielded.

It seemed to be a very usual, uncomplicated strike, without stirring up any waves around the Void.

After such a strike came out, the red Exotic Beast gave out an angry growl of fear with its eyes glaring like bells. A sword light somehow had appeared before its Head without giving the red Exotic Beast any reaction time, chopping down its Head as a whole.

Then the pattern vanished.

“what’s going on?”

“What’s going on with the sword just now?”

“Although I did see his movement, I didn’t feel any power of that movement and any sword lights bursting out. Just one sword light bursting out didn’t give the Exotic Beast any chance to escape and killed it on the spot.”

“How did the sword light appear?”

Jian Wushuang was lost in thought.

Each of the 16 patterns on the jade wall was amazing, but Jian Wushuang found this one most intriguing and inscrutable. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

From then on, his Slaughter Body had been staying before the Star Jade Wall, observing and exploring the inscrutable sword on the pattern.

As he observed and explored, he gradually found out some extraordinary qualities of the pattern.

He recognized the reason why the sword light didn’t appear at the very beginning was that sword performed by the middle-aged man had exceeded the limit of space.

Or, that sword ignored space.

Such a sword which could ingnore space was undoubtedly the fastest sword.

His Slaughter Body was entirely aborsbed in meditating the sword, while his World Body still stayed at the palace of Yin Thunder, cultivating Divine Yin Thunder.

Half a day has passed in a blink of an eye.

Unde the Star Jade Wall, Jian Wushuang, who had been sitting before the pattern carefully meditating the sword, suddenly paused and a suprised look grew in his eyes.

“It’s been a while… Have I made a break through?” Jian Wushuang clasped both his hands as he could hardly contain the excitement inside of him.

At the moment, the sturdy Sword Heart had began metamorphosizing again in his sea of consciousness.

He had made a break through in his Sword Heart!

When he worked his way up in fog sea and battled with those Exotic Beasts, his Sword Heart had reached the summit of Level Four and was even likely to reach Level Five at any time.

After coming to Star Island, his Slaughter Body had been staying under the Star Jade Wall meditating. As he meditated, he had developed a deeper understanding of Sword Principle. Untill now, he had finally made a break through and managed to start Level Five.

After the break through, the power of Sword Heart he could produced had also improved greatly. Apparently, his comprehensive strength also enhanced by a notch.

However, such an improvement was far enough to help him pass through the second trial of black tower. He had to try harder to become stronger.
