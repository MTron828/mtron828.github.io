Chapter 484: Holy Sh*t, Three Sword Souls Joined as One!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The deeply mysterious thousand sword salute provided a massive opportunity.

Many of the Sword Principle experts in Sword-suppression Valley cherished this type of opportunity to the highest degree and were thus meditating in full concentration. Those whose comprehension levels were as high as Jian Wushuang’s entered an epiphany in little time.

An epiphany was a once in a lifetime experience, and the benefits were huge upon going through one. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

As time passed, the scarlet longsword, which emitted an unsurpassed Sword Qi of Killing beneath its bloody light, finally cooled off.

The Sword Qi of Killing vanished.

The terrifying Sword Essence, which had been charging non-stop in all directions, began to dissipate gradually.

One after another, the thousands upon thousands of weapons which participated in the salute stopped moving.

Even the bloody light which filled the sky began to fade. Finally, the scarlet longsword returned to normal, and, with a fierce roar, slowly headed back to its abode at the bottom of the mountain hole.

Everything became peaceful again.

Within Sword-suppression Valley, everyone opened their eyes, save for a small number of Sword Principle experts who remained in a state of epiphany.

There was a look of pleasant surprise yet also a little regret in the eyes of those who opened theirs.

The pleasant surprise was because they all received huge benefits from the opportunity provided by the deeply mysterious thousand sword salute that just passed.

Conversely, the regret was because the opportunity lasted way too short for them to enter an epiphany.

In any case, the opportunity was over.

“It’s over.”

Sighing softly, Hunjian Lord turned his eyes toward Tianming Lord by the side. Right at this moment, a 60-feet tall Sword Soul Phantom appeared behind the latter.

“Congrats, Tianming Lord,” he said.

“Haha.” The latter looked pleasantly surprised too. “I’d thought it impossible to awaken a Sword Soul in this life. It’s wonderful that I’ve finally awakened one, even if it’s only second-grade.”

Tianming Lord had indeed awakened a Sword Soul during the opportunity that just passed.

“Both of us have benefited considerably, but the people who benefited the most are those who remained in the secret chamber. By being nearest to the Heart-killing Sword, they felt the most and thus benefited the most,” Hunjian Lord commented.

“That’s true. I’m jealous of them,” Tianming Lord replied praisingly.

The Sword Principle experts who entered an epiphany began to come round one after another, and each of them looked pleasantly surprised beyond compare.

Subsequently, some of the dozen or so experts in the secret chamber walked out of said chamber.

Within a short while, most of the Sword Principle experts were gathered together once again.

“Where’s the swordsman?” There was a look of astonishment on Hunjian Lord’s face.

All of the Sword Principle experts, including Su Ming and Jian Nantian, had stepped out of the secret chamber, leaving Jian Wushuang as the only person in there.

“The benefits he received must be huge.” Hunjian Lord could not help remarking.

All of a sudden, boom... a voluminous Sword Essence gushed from one of the secret chambers.

Broad and imposing, it contained a boundless murderous intent as it swept across.

The experts gathered in Sword-suppression Valley quickly detected the presence of the Sword Essence and immediately looked toward the secret chamber which Jian Wushuang was in.

What they saw were three towering Sword Soul Phantoms.

Every one of them was close to a hundred feet tall and stood side by side like peerless Sword Masters.

The broad and imposing Sword Essence had originated from their bodies.

“Three Sword Souls?”

“Three Sword Souls standing side by side, every one of them majestic in height and first-grade!”

“Who was it that awakened three first-grade Sword Souls?”

The Sword Principle experts who witnessed this scene were shell-shocked.

They had already been shocked when Jian Nantian awakened three Sword Souls previously. However, back then, there was only one first-grade Sword Soul, with the other two being second-grade. That was nothing compared to the astoundment of seeing three first-grade Sword Souls.

“It’s the swordsman. They came from the secret chamber he’s in.” There was a glimmer in the eyes of both Hunjian Lord and Tianming Lord.

To awaken three first-grade Sword Souls was considered an incredible feat in Divine Land, throughout the history of which only a handful of people had been capable of awakening three first-grade “souls”.

“Three first-grade Sword Souls!”

As one of the Nine Sovereigns, even the lofty Su Ming revealed a hint of amazement on his handsome face.

It should be known that, to someone who is called Sword Demon, this had ONLY been the awakening of three first-grade Sword Souls.

To awaken three first-grade Sword Souls could be considered monstrous.

But if so, the Sword Ancestor’s awakening of six first-grade Sword Souls should be considered monstrously beyond monstrous.

It was precisely because the Sword Ancestor had defied the natural order that he earned his name as the ancestor of the Sword Principle.

Though the appearance of the three Sword Souls had captured everyone’s attention, this was but the beginning. The following scene would cause everyone’s, including the Sword Principle experts’ and Master Su Ming’s, hair to stand on their ends.

Within the secret chamber, the three Sword Soul Phantoms, which had been standing side by side, closed the distance between themselves and began to fuse together.

“A fusion of Sword Souls?”

“Impossible!”

“How can Sword Souls fuse?”

Many of the Sword Principle experts were so dumbstruck that their mouths were agape and their eyes were filled with astonishment.

A fusion of Sword Souls?

Since ancient times, there had been countless experts who had awakened “souls”, and among them had been many talented experts who awakened two or three “souls”, while a select number of exceptional geniuses had awakened four or even five.

The Sword Ancestor, who had awakened six Sword Souls, was considered a monster among monsters.

However, regardless of how many “souls” these monsters had awakened, nobody had ever fused several Sword Souls together.

It had never happened or even been rumored to have happened before.

Throughout the history of the Divine Land, various experts had attempted to do so. However, because every awakened “soul” was unique, they could never be fused together regardless of what the experts tried.

Nobody had ever managed to do it.

Even the Sword Ancestor, who awakened six Sword Souls, could not.

But now, in the secret chamber, the three Sword Soul Phantoms behind Jian Wushuang were fusing together at a speed which allowed the process to be visible. Within Jian Wushuang’s sea of consciousness, they had already fused together into one completely.

The fusion was complete!

Sure enough, the three first-grade Sword Souls had fused completely.

Infusing the Sword Souls, Jian Wushuang had done what nobody in the Divine Land’s history had done before.

The crowd of Sword Principle experts, including Su Ming and Jian Nantian, stared fixedly at the secret chamber.

A perfect fusion of three first-grade Sword Souls!

“H...holy sh*t!”

A series of cries began to reverberate throughout the valley.
