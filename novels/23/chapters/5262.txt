Chapter 5261 - 5261: Heavenly Emperor Wan Xing‚Äôs True Combat Strength

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Raising the divine seal, he wielded control over all directions.

A mountain range spanning millions of miles descended abruptly, crashing into the midst of a million Devouring Demons. One man stood against a million 3-Star Devouring Demons, and he did so effortlessly, not even revealing his supreme techniques.

‚ÄúThis lad, he‚Äôs actually concealing his true strength. He wields the aura of an

Emperor without resorting to his supreme techniques. Impressive. The Dao

Lords within the Four Great Secret Realms aren‚Äôt much better, I suppose!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes! He can now be compared to those indigenous Dao Lords!‚Äù Zhu Yi nodded approvingly.

These Grand Yan Immortals would be under her control in the future, until they successfully merged their Daos and left the Vermilion Bird Temple.

Just as there were experts that True Spirit favored, she also had people she favored.

Wan Xing was one of them!

Within the Qishen Temple, merging Daos wasn‚Äôt particularly difficult. Back then, a mere subsidiary hall of the Black Tortoise Temple allowed Liu Ya and Daogong to become Emperors through devouring. That still held true now.

As long as Wan Xing succeeded in merging his Dao, he could undoubtedly dominate within the Four Great Secret Realms.

Even if he left the Vermilion Bird Temple, as long as he remembered her kindness, he would harbor good feelings toward the Vermilion Bird Temple in the future.

This was a candidate for a future tier 6 Emperor. Zhu Yi quietly noted it down and then contemplated the distribution of treasures, considering what Wan Xing lacked so she could tailor the rewards accordingly.

Ever since True Spirit brought these people back from the Four Great Secret Realms and included them in the trials, the originally rushed second stage of the trials had become even more chaotic.

Especially in the allocation of treasures, it could be changed at will.

Just now, Qiuhuang and Yang Sanmu were discussing in her presence which wave of treasures to give to Jian Wushuang. These two individuals had high hopes for Jian Wushuang. There was a high probability that they would be valued greatly once they settled in the Four Great Secret Realms. True Spirit no longer trusted the core members of the Four Temples or, to put it more

accurately, didn‚Äôt approve of the puppets crafted by the Qishen Temple back then.

Their own people had now been divided by these old fogeys. Although they were unwilling deep down, they couldn‚Äôt say anything on the surface. After all, these people were the ones True Spirit had fished out.

‚ÄúJian Wushuang has finished on his end too. His path is well-suited for this trial!‚Äù Yang Sanmu‚Äôs third eye flickered with a faint power outside the eastern city wall.

Jian Wushuang unfolded a pair of wings, one black and the other crimson, and darted like lightning amidst millions of Devouring Demons.

His sharp Candle Dragon Wings completely sliced through the battlefield.

The crimson third eye continued to emit its scarlet hue, his Beast God Domain pushed to its utmost limit.

Charging into the midst of the Devouring Demons, Jian Wushuang seemed like a Shura, and this was his battleground. Those Demon Lords were like little devils in purgatory to him.

Jian Wushuang was the relentless reaper of lives.

A few Devouring Demons that managed to break through were swiftly slain by the people guarding the city wall. Dao Lord Si Tian knew he couldn‚Äôt contend with Jian Wushuang, but he also feared being plotted against once he left the city. So, with righteousness on his side, he stood atop the city wall, jointly defending it with tens of thousands of Grand Yan Immortals.

Hiss!

Thousands of Devouring Demons rushed up the city wall. A peak-level Grand

Yan Immortal, heavily wounded and unable to resist, hastily retreated. Facing these evil and grotesque Demon Lords, this peak-level expert felt utter despair.

Just then, Dao Lord Si Tian‚Äôs claw tore through the sky, killing thousands of Devouring Demons in an instant. His figure landed in front of the peak-level Grand Yan Immortal.

Looking at the towering figure, the peak-level Grand Yan Immortal couldn‚Äôt help but kneel down and pay his respects.

‚ÄúThank you Dao Lord, for lending a helping hand!‚ÄùY√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

Dao Lord Si Tian turned slightly, revealing only half of his face, a faint smile playing on his lips. He said calmly, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all comrades. No need to thank me.

Hurry and go restore your spiritual essence in the rear!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù The peak-level Grand Yan Immortal responded excitedly.

Whoosh!

Dao Lord Si Tian left the area, heading towards other breaches caused by the scattered Devouring Demons.

These small groups of 3-Star Devouring Demons posed no real threat to him; he could easily slaughter them with a casual wave. However, the peak-level Grand Yan Immortals were struggling a bit.

Even in the face of hundreds of Devouring Demons, they found it hard to hold their ground.

Jian Wushuang intercepted nearly 600,000 3-Star Devouring Demons. Only 400,000 of them managed to assault the Grand Yan Immortals on the city walls.

Combined with dozens of extreme-level Grand Yan Immortals and those half- step Dao Lords, they managed to withstand about half of the onslaught, leaving only 200,000 to reach the city walls.

Tens of thousands of top-level Grand Yan Immortals, along with over 1,000 peak-level ones, were unable to stop even 200,000 Devouring Demons.

The ninth wave consisted of tens of millions of 3-Star Devouring Demons. Even if Jian Wushuang could hold off six million, who would stop the remaining four million?

Now, even the peak-level Grand Yan Immortals were starting to fall. The next to fall would be the extreme-level Grand Yan Immortals and those half-step Dao Lords.

Facing tens of millions of three- star Devouring Demons, not even tearing the sky apart seemed to instill much confidence in resisting. Only Jian Wushuang remained capable of resisting head-on.

As Jian Wushuang continued his slaughter, the number of three- star Devouring Demons dwindled. First, the sixty thousand he intercepted were annihilated singlehandedly, then he went on to help others by killing the remaining smaller groups of Devouring Demons one by one.

Exhaling deeply, Jian Wushuang retracted his Candle Dragon Feather Wings on his back. Standing atop the city wall, he looked at the bodies of the Grand Yan Immortals that had been ravaged by the Devouring Demons. He felt a pang of regret.

100,000 Grand Yan Immortals.

First, the Nine Revolutions were eliminated early, leaving just over 80,000. Then, in the seventh wave, many top-level Grand Yan Immortals perished. Of course, in the seventh wave, there were only 100,000 3-Star Devouring Demons, and Jian Wushuang left them with only 30 to 40,000. Even so, some still fell.

This time was even more exaggerated; nearly 10,000 people perished directly.

These individuals had all become top-level Grand Yan Immortals through the enhancement of treasures, and even some peak-level Grand Yan Immortals had fallen.

These people found themselves trapped here. Caught between a rock and a hard place.

Retire? Unwilling!

But in this wave alone, they gained hundreds, even thousands of treasure points.

Especially those peak-level Grand Yan Immortals, they obtained tens of thousands of treasure points. Naturally, they wouldn‚Äôt retreat. Even if there was a risk of falling in the next battle, they would fight on.

‚ÄúAh, let‚Äôs go. My strength was mediocre to begin with, and now I‚Äôm injured,‚Äù a despondent top-level Grand Yan Immortal sighed. He glanced back at the ruined land beyond the city walls. This was his last glimpse of the Original Universe. He wouldn‚Äôt have another chance.

Swoosh!

He crossed the barrier and entered the City Lords Mansion.

At the same time, many top-level Grand Yan Immortals chose to retire.

In an instant, half the people on the city walls were gone!

There were less than 40,000 remaining.

Some retired due to insufficient strength, while others, having broken through, chose to stay.

With the treasure points obtained in the previous wave, weaker Grand Yan Immortals spent all they had. If they broke through, they stayed; if not, they retired.

On the edge of the city wall, six people sat in meditation, both men and women.

‚ÄúFourth Brother, let Sixth Sister go!‚Äù the leader, a senior figure, had a sorrowful look in his eyes.

‚ÄúBig Brother! ‚Äù

Fourth Brother‚Äôs eyes glistened with tears.

‚ÄúGo! Third Sister has already fallen. I don‚Äôt want to see anyone else die.

Without peak-level power, staying means certain death!‚Äù

Originally, there were nine of them, all from a vast world, just from different sects..
