Chapter 2848: Eighth-Grade

——

“This sword essence...”

Jian Wushuang carefully felt the sword essence. He could see that it had completely integrated into the Blood Mountain Sword and became a part of it.

As the master of the Blood Mountain Sword, he could naturally use this sword essence.

Jian Wushuang immediately tried to communicate with the sword essence, trying to guide it.

But in the end, he only managed to guide a bit of the sword essence.

“This sword essence is too extraordinary. With my current comprehension of sword principle, it seems very difficult to guide this sword essence.” Jian Wushuang frowned but soon relaxed. “There’s no rush. This sword essence has just merged with the Blood Mountain Sword. I’ll study it when I have time.”

Jian Wushuang exhaled slightly, but a smile appeared on his face.

In general, he was very satisfied with the transformation of the Blood Mountain Sword.

Especially the supreme sword essence in the Blood Mountain Sword. Jian Wushuang had a feeling that it would be very useful to him.

After briefly checking the changes in the blood mountain sword, Jian Wushuang looked at Lord Mo again.

However, at the sight of Lord Mo, Jian Wushuang’s expression became strange.

After the refinement and the transformation of the Blood Mountain Sword, Lord Mo closed his eyes and stood there without moving.

It seemed that he had understood something.

Jian Wushuang also knew this, so he just stood quietly by the side and did not disturb him.

After a long time, Lord Mo, who was standing motionlessly, suddenly opened his eyes. The moment he opened his eyes, an unprecedentedly fierce light turned into two bolts of lightning and suddenly shot out.

Lord Mo’s expression also instantly became pleasantly surprised.

“Haha!”

“I finally made it. After so many years, I finally made it!”

“God really treats me well!”

Lord Mo laughed loudly with a hint of madness in his voice. This madness was completely caused by surprise and joy.

Jian Wushuang stood aside and listened, but his expression changed.

He could see that Lord Mo was so pleasantly surprised because he had made a breakthrough.

And the breakthrough was not about strength, right?

“Lord Mo, what are you...” Jian Wushuang said.

“My friend Sword One, I have to thank you and the magic weapon in your hand.” Lord Mo smiled and said, “I have become a seventh-grade weapon refiner and even reached the peak of the seventh-grade. I haven’t had the chance to advance for many years.”

“It has been too long. I have dreamed of taking that step and becoming a true eighth-grade weapon refiner. After all, the path of weapon refining is different from cultivation. The peak of the eighth and seventh grades may seem like a step away, but they are two completely different levels. They are two completely different worlds.”

“Hundreds of thousands of years ago, I once met a true eighth-grade weapon refiner. At that time, I was completely convinced by his weapon refining methods. I even wanted to become his disciple, but that person was only a low-grade eighth-grade weapon refiner.”

“I really yearned for that level, but unfortunately, that step is extremely difficult. Other cultivators encounter their own bottlenecks, and it is much more difficult. Moreover, there are no shortcuts. I have been stuck on this step for so many years. I originally thought that I would never be able to break through again in this lifetime, but today... Haha! I broke through!”

“I finally took that step and became a true eighth-grade weapon refiner!”

Lord Mo’s laughter reverberated throughout the entire open space. It was indeed filled with joy.

Jian Wushuang nodded secretly when he heard it.

He guessed that Lord Mo’s breakthrough was not due to his own strength. Perhaps his strength had also improved, but what truly made him so ecstatic and even made him disregard his status at the peak... it could only be a breakthrough in the weapon refining Dao.

As expected, Lord Mo was a top seventh-grade weapon refiner, and he had truly reached the eighth grade.

Eighth-grade weapon refiner was an extremely respected figure even in the vast third heaven, not to mention in the remote territory of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow.

“Congratulations, Lord Mo,” Jian Wushuang said, congratulating him.

“This time, I can advance one step further by refining again. Thanks to your help, you don’t need to call me Master Mo anymore. My name is Mo Tao. If you don’t mind, you can call me brother Mo,” Mo Tao said.

“This...” Jian Wushuang was a bit surprised.

“What? Do you think I’m not good enough for You?” Mo Tao pretended to be unhappy.

“I wouldn’t dare, Brother Mo.” Jian Wushuang quickly changed the way he addressed him.

“Haha, that’s more like it.” Mo Tao smiled again, feeling very happy.

In fact, if it was an ordinary person, even some powerful Immortal Saints, Mo Tao’s strength and identity might not be taken seriously. As for calling him brother, it was even more impossible.

The reason why Mo Tao was willing to make friends with Jian Wushuang in such a way was that Jian Wushuang had indeed helped him a great deal this time, which made him very surprised.

Secondly, he also saw that Jian Wushuang was extraordinary.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

From the beginning when Jian Wushuang took out the drop of blood essence, which made him think that it was the blood essence of a special life, he had already seen that Jian Wushuang, an Advanced Great Divine Master, was not simple.

However, when Jian Wushuang took out the Blood Mountain Sword, Mo Tao felt even more incredulous.

As for what really shocked him, it was the three drops of blood essence that Jian Wushuang took out one after another during the refining process.

The three drops of blood essence were completely beyond Mo Tao’s understanding.

However, he could see that the three drops of blood essence did not come from any other place, but Jian Wushuang’s own blood essence.

Who was Jian Wushuang to have condensed such incredible essence blood that was completely beyond his knowledge?

Mo Tao did not know. He could not even guess it, but he knew that Jian Wushuang’s origin must be shocking.

Under such circumstances, how could he dare to put on any airs?

Similarly, he did not dare to put on airs, which was why this scene happened.

“My friend Sword One, after refining, absorbing three drops of your blood essence and so many treasures, your sword must have changed a lot. How does it feel?” Mo Tao asked.

“It’s a big change, and it feels good, but how much has changed? I have to find time to study it.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Your sword has an amazing origin and great potential,” Mo Tao said with a sigh, “I have refined many divine weapons for many years, including many natal divine weapons. The natal divine weapons I have refined can at least become supreme-grade holy treasures in the future. If I’m lucky, they might even become supreme treasures in the future...”
