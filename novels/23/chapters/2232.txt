2233 Why the First Era Collapsed Part II

“Perish together?” Jian Wushuang was amazed.

“Indeed, both sides perished. Countless First Era cultivators and many Great Emperors died on the same battlefield, leading to the collapse of the First Era. But only three experts that came from the Absolute Beginning Divine World survived,” Emperor Bai said.

“Three?”

“Were they...” Jian Wushuang suddenly glared.

“You guessed it. It’s Blood Emperor, Lord Fen, and Demon King Chen Yu,” Emperor Bai said.

“It really is,” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

He had always thought Blood Emperor, Lord Fen, and Demon King Chen Yu were Ancient Era experts that had woken up slightly earlier than others.

Unexpectedly, those three people had not slept since the Ancient Era.

Perhaps they had fought in the Ancient Era, then escaped, and come back once again during the First Era. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“They survived since the First Era but did not stop. Rather, they continued to expand their sphere of influence for the upcoming battles. Therefore, the beginning of the Three Emperors World, Holocaust Sect, and the Acheron Palace. They only managed to maintain their abilities with large amounts of resources and treasures,” Emperor Bai said.

Jian Wushuang finally understood, but his face turned sour. “The last time the link passage at Heaven’s Horizon opened, experts from the Absolute Beginning Divine World came down. Will the same thing happen this time?”

“That is what I worry about,” Emperor Bai replied. “There were many experts in the First Era to go against the Absolute Beginning Divine World experts, but they had no choice but to perish with them. The Second Era does not nearly have so many experts, along with the injuries we inflicted during the battle against the Three Emperors World... if the Absolute Beginning Divine World experts were to come down, we wouldn’t stand a chance!”

Jian Wushuang’s face was extremely sour.

He knew how big the ability gap was compared to the First Era.

Emperor Bai and he may have been strong, but if a large number of Third Stage Great Emperors were to gang up on them, there was not much they could do.

“Do not rush this first, we still have 3,900 years. Furthermore, we cannot be sure if any experts will come down or not,” Jian Wushuang said, and took out a transmission token.

“Emperor Thirteen was the strongest during the Ancient Era, he should know more about the formation placed on this land, I’ll go ask him.”

“Emperor Thirteen,” Jian Wushuang immediately called him.

“What is it?” Emperor Thirteen quickly replied, his voice cold as usual.

“It’s like this, ” Jian Wushuang talked about the link passage opening 3,900 years later, and many Ancient Era experts awakening. He also talked about the Eternal Chaotic World’s current predicament.

“Link passage?” Emperor Thirteen thought for a moment, and replied, “Don’t worry about that. The formation is not as simple as it looks. If those old bastards managed to open a space tunnel back then and send their experts over, then the formation’s restrictions would have been much stronger now.”

“Even if all of them at the Absolute Beginning Divine World were to join forces, they would still need some good treasures to open a link passage, and it’ll only last for a moment. There is no way they could open it!” Emperor Thirteen said with unprecedented confidence.

Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh of relief.

“Emperor Thirteen was a supreme expert back at the Absolute Beginning Divine World and knows the most about the formation. If he dares say that, I’m sure no one from the Absolute Beginning Divine World will come down once the link passage opens 3,900 years later,” Jian Wushuang said.

“That’s great,” Emperor Bai was delighted. “As long as they don’t come down, we only need to deal with Ancient Era experts that recently woke up. A lot of them will be busy maintaining their powers as well, there won’t be many attacking us, which should make our job much easier.”

“Right,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Without any experts coming down from the Absolute Beginning Divine World, they only needed to deal with the Ancient Era experts. It may have been hard for the Eternal Chaotic World as of then, but not impossible. After all, Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai were invincible in the world.

Unless another supreme expert like Emperor Thirteen appeared.

But supreme experts like Emperor Thirteen should have been able to escape during the Ancient Era battle then. Based on Jian Wushuang’s calculations, only experts of Blood Emperor’s level remained.

Without the Opposing Blood Formation, Blood Emperor’s fighting power was only at Half Step Divine Demon levels, easy enough for Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai to deal with.

Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai were still discussing it.

But at that moment...

“Hmm?” Emperor Bai’s gaze moved.

“What is it?” Jian Wushuang immediately looked over.

“It’s Red Dragon, he just transmitted a message to me. He says the Black Water Dragon has appeared again, many cultivators in another city have disappeared. I’ve instructed Abysmal Saint Master and Underworld God to help him, but the three of them together may not be enough against the Black Water Dragon, and the Ancient Era expert behind it,” Emperor Bai said.

“True, for us to kill it or the Ancient Era expert behind it, both of us must go down personally,” Jian Wushuang said.

“If that’s the case, let’s go now,” Emperor Bai said.

“Right,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Soon, Jian Wushuang and Emperor Bai made their way to the Red Dragon Sanctuary.
