Chapter 1746: Armageddon

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Bang!

The shockingly loud bang wasn’t the noise from Jian Wushuang being eaten by the ancient flood dragon, it was the noise of a fierce hit on the flood dragon’s head. It then immersed itself under the sea.

“What?”

Jian Wushuang, who was originally hopeless, opened his eyes widely and watched everything that happened before his eyes in shock.

He saw a blurry figure in the void before him. The figure was about ten thousand zhang tall. It was enormously huge. Although he couldn’t see the appearance clearly, he reckoned that it should be an elderly from the outline of the figure.

But who was the elderly?

When did he appear?

“Roar!”

An angry roar that sounded like a dragon’s roar shook heaven and earth vigorously.

It stirred up billowing waves in the entire surface of dark sea region and the ancient flood dragon revealed itself. Its huge body was not only one size bigger than King of Venomous Worm, the huge head was extremely ferocious, while its faint grey pupils were covered in coldness and murderous intention and it was looking at the huge shadow that was ten thousand zhang tall.

“Hehe, little thing. You do not deserve to make me take action personally. Let the one behind you come out,” the blurry shadow that embodied an elderly let out a hearty laugh. His laughter was heard from all directions and it contained a unique magic power.

As his voice stopped, crack!

In the vast void, there was suddenly a huge black hand that pierced through. It was huge and towering like a boundless mountain. Then, a shadow that was ten thousand zhang tall stepped out of the black hole and stood opposite the blurry elderly in the distance.

The moment the black shadow appeared, the ancient flood dragon that was giving out a chilliness immediately became tame.

Obviously, the black shadow was the master of the ancient flood dragon.

“This, these… What are all these?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He knew clearly that the ancient flood dragon could kill an Emperor God easily and it was not something he could match evenly.

But then, there were suddenly two blurry shadows that were ten thousand zhang tall and much scarier than the ancient flood dragon.

The two shadows were obviously substantiated with consciousness but not their original bodies. However, as they stood there, Jian Wushuang felt that besides Long Qi and his master that he had come across in the independent space in the Eighth Lair back then, there was no one in the whole world that could win against him.

But why would the shadows of the superb existences suddenly appear in Buddhist Demon Sea?

Jian Wushuang was quivering in fear and he stayed behind the shadow of the elderly. He didn’t dare to move an inch. King of Venomous Worms in his body was frightened and remained silent too. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“One-Star Man, you old man, you are awakened too!” The blurry shadow said under black armor while the ancient flood dragon stayed by his side. His deep voice reverberated in Buddhist Demon Sea and it stirred stormy waves all over Buddhist Demon Sea.

“Haha, in the same region, as you are awakened, how can I continued to stay asleep?” The blurry shadow that the elder took the form of, also known as the One-star Man, burst out into a hearty laugh.

“So what if you woke up? I’m killing these few non-entities, what does it have to do with you?” The shadow in black armor asked coldly.

“You can kill anyone else but the young man behind me has Mountain River Map and he knows the secret skill of Seven Star, he definitely shared a relationship with Seven Star Black Sect. Do you think I’ll let you kill him?” One-star Man laughed.

“You won’t, and I can’t, kill him?” The shadow in a black armor let his murderous intention bellow. As he finished his sentence, he took a huge stride forward.

With just one step, Jian Wushuang felt as though he had traversed two different eras.

The shadow in black armor appeared in front of the blurry shadow that the One-star Man took the form of. Then, he simply punched.

On the other hand, One-star Man waved his hand casually.

Bang!

There was a loud bang and the universe broke apart.

The huge sea that covered an expanse of tens of millions of miles instantly sunk in and it sunk all the way down to the bottom of the sea. It even revealed the reefs in the seabed.

There were countless tsunamis and every single wave was more than a million zhang high as it dispersed in all directions madly.

Jian Wushuang was right in the middle of the tsunami and he felt the tsunami shattering everything like breaking dead wood. It stirred a commotion up in his heart as well.

Merely a brief hit had caused such unbelievable power… Just how strong were the two people that were fighting?

“The experts of Great Emperor level in Eternal Chaotic World were nothing?!” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Plus, the two of them hadn’t come in person but merely in the form of shadow that they had substantiated temporarily!

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The roars spread over continuously and every roar came with boundless waves. The vigorous battle between the two made the universe seem to pale into insignificance.

If one wasn’t the level of Great Emperor, he couldn’t even think of getting involved in such a vigorous battle.

Just like Jian Wushuang, forget about getting involved, he couldn’t even open his eyes when he was in the boundless tsunami. He could only feel the boundless power explode madly.

“One-star Man, you really want to go against me?!” An angry voice roared through the universe.

“Haha, so what if I go against you? It’s not like we never fought before. Not only do I want to keep this young man alive, I also want to provide him with an opportunity to let him grow stronger faster,” One-star Man’s voice was loud and clear.

“Young man, look closely.”

Jian Wushuang, who was in the boundless tsunami, forced his eyes open.

As he opened his eyes, he happened to see a huge hand.

A huge hand that seemed to press the entire sky, the entire universe.

The huge hand was grey and it was blurry. Besides the boundless divine power that it contained, there was another kind of energy. The energy was the power of Reincarnation!

“Constellation Theurgy… Extermination Palm of Reincarnation!!!”

Rumble. The huge hand descended magnificently.

Jian Wushuang was dumbfounded at the sight. He stared at the huge hand and the huge hand continuously appeared in his head and continuously magnified in size. In the end, it was completely sealed in his memory.

Hong!

The power of the huge hand exploded and the shadow in black armor knelt down from the slap. The shadow dispersed slightly.

“B*stard!”

A roar with boundless rage spread and the shadow in black armor substantiated again.

“Black Scale, kill that boy!”

The shadow in black armor roared while the ancient flood dragon that was fighting alongside him suddenly let out a chilly gleam. Then, the chilliness turned into an air current and froze the void. Then, it bypassed One-star Man’s huge shadow and shot at Jian Wushuang.

“Be careful!” One-Star Man roared.

Jian Wushuang’s face changed.
