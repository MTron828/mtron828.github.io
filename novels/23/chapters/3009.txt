Chapter 3010: Underground

——

“The higher-ups of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom are quite smart. They know how to use the divine power test stone to determine my realm and cultivation. If I really used a secret skill to hide my realm, I would definitely be detected by the divine power test stone. Unfortunately, they are doomed to miscalculate.” Jian Wushuang smiled secretly.

All the higher-ups of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom had assumed that he was an Immortal Saint and had only concealed his aura.

However, they had never expected that Jian Wushuang had not concealed his aura at all. His realm and cultivation were that of a genuine divine master!

A genuine Divine Master cultivator would only get one result after using the divine power testing stone to test his cultivation.

“All of you, come forward and take the test.” The purple-clothed woman’s voice was cold.

The Divine Masters and Great Divine Masters in front of them did not hesitate and went forward to take the test.

The test results were naturally Divine Masters and Great Divine Masters.

Before long, it was Jian Wushuang’s turn.

“Next,” the purple-clothed woman said. Her cold eyes looked directly at Jian Wushuang as if she wanted to see through him completely.

Jian Wushuang was obviously frightened by the purple-clothed woman’s gaze. He did not dare to look directly into her eyes.

He walked forward with fear and poured his divine power into the divine power testing stone in front of him.

The divine power testing stone immediately burst out with a dazzling light.

The light was much more dazzling than the other Great Divine Masters, but the color was still the same silver.

“A Peak Great Divine Master?”

“And the light is so dazzling. I’m afraid that he’s an Invincible Divine Master.”

The purple-clothed woman looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise, but she did not care.

They were looking for a super existence who could kill two second-level True Saints, Tian Mound King and Stone Saint, in one move, not just a Great Divine Master.

“Next,” the purple-clothed woman continued to shout.

Jian Wushuang quickly retreated.

In less than an hour, more than 200 cultivators above the Divine Master level in the city had been tested.

“It seems that the person is not hiding in the city,” the purple-clothed woman said.

“Yes, it should be.” The tall man nodded. “Let’s go to the next city.”

The tall man, the purple-clothed woman, and the others quickly left, and the city became quiet again.

As for Jian Wushuang, he returned to the secret room.

“It’s just as I thought. Even if I stand in front of the experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, they won’t recognize me.” Jian Wushuang smiled and felt completely relieved. Then he continued to cultivate and prepare.

In the blink of an eye, the area had been sealed for a year.

During this year, the experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom had searched every corner of the area. They had almost turned the area upside down, but they still could not find the ‘important criminal’.

“We have searched all the places, and we used soul power to search carefully. How could we not find him?” When Lord Wu heard the result, his face immediately turned gloomy.

“Lord Wu, our people have indeed searched very carefully, but that person seems to have vanished into thin air. There’s no trace of him at all. Could it be that he has already left this territory?” A True Saint beside him said.

“Impossible!” Lord Wu immediately denied it, “The moment I received the news, I immediately ordered my people to close the spatial passage and then used the dragon imprisoning compass to seal off the world in the shortest amount of time. Furthermore, the area sealed off is already extremely vast. Unless this person’s comprehension of the laws of space and time has reached an inconceivable level and he can use teleportation, it’s absolutely impossible for him to escape from this region.”

“As for teleportation, many top-notch immortal saints have never mastered it. If he had mastered it, even the king would have been easily killed by him. Why would he need to run for his life?”

Lord Wu said firmly.

He was sure that Jian Wushuang was still hiding in this sealed area, but they had never found him.

“Then could he be hiding deep underground?” The True Saint asked again.

“Underground?” Lord Wu’s face changed.

Underground was the best place to hide.

After all, the underground was much wider than the outside world, and it was more difficult to explore.

If a cultivator was good at hiding his aura and hiding underground, even a simple scan with soul power might not be able to find him. Only by using soul power to carefully explore every inch could they find him.

But if that happened, it would be much more complicated.

In the past year, the experts from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom had indeed searched the entire sealed area, but they had yet to enter the underground.

This was because it would take too much time and effort to search underground.

“From the looks of it, that person is most likely hiding deep underground.” Lord Wu said with a cold expression.

“If that’s the case, then it will be much more difficult for us to find others.” The True Saint beside him said.

“That’s the case, but even so, we still have to find him!” Lord Wu growled, “This person has already killed nine True Saints of my Magic Note Divine Kingdom, including Holy Lord Huocang, Tian Mound King, and Stone Saint, these three-second level True Saints. The king is already furious, so this person must die!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Pass down my orders. From today onward, everyone will dive underground and use their soul power to store and investigate. I will control the dragon imprisoning compass and use the array formation to reduce the range of activity underground to within a thousand kilometers!”

“A thousand kilometers underground?” That True Saint’s expression sank. “My Lord, a thousand kilometers underground is different from a thousand kilometers in the void. It is too difficult to investigate a thousand kilometers underground. Can you think of a way to reduce it, for example, within a hundred kilometers underground?”

“No.” Lord Wu shook his head. “I can limit the range of movement of the underground. Although the dragon imprisoning compass can do it, it is not under the control of the ruler personally. I do not have the means of the ruler. Being able to limit it to 1,000 li is already my limit.”

“There’s no other way. I can only probe a depth of a thousand kilometers underground. Of course, such a probe can not only rely on the True Saints of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom. Send the order and summon the ten great Magic Note armies over. The cultivators of the Magic Note armies are all cultivators above the Divine Master level. There are a total of 200,000 of them. Let them search carefully. Even if they can not find him in a year or two, I do not believe that they will not be able to find him within 10, 20, or even 100 years!”

Lord Wu clenched his hands, his eyes cold and determined.
