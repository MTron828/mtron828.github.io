Chapter 1460: The Only Weakness

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

There were a total of nine illusionary figures that were hemmed in. They launched an attack simultaneously, waving their claws, landing heavy punches, or giving out brilliant lights from the tip of their fingers. Every single hit was real while Universe God Long Xiu’s body moved swiftly among the illusionary figures and appeared in every corner, surrounding Jian Wushuang to perform a vital hit.

Even Jian Wushuang found it hard to catch up with Universe God Long Xiu’s martial art movements in terms of speed.

“He deserves to be acknowledged as the one with top martial art movement Sky Sword Prison. That’s so terrifying.” Jian Wushuang exclaimed, but he was not anxious at all.

Although he couldn’t follow Universe God Long Xiu’s martial art movements, his Soul Power had locked Universe God Long Xiu long ago. Regardless of how creepy Universe God Long Xiu’s martial art movement was, Jian Wushuang could respond in time and also could withstand Universe God Long Xiu’s attacks.

In the void, Jian Wushuang put his close combat power into full play. In collaboration with his swordsmanship and the Power of Reincarnation, he fought against Universe God Long Xiu face-to-face. Although he was playing defense, he never once looked in a fix.

Bang!

A loud thud and the nine illusionary figures surrounding Jian Wushuang suddenly dispersed and Universe God Long Xiu’s real body appeared somewhere far away.

“Jian Wushuang, the experts in Sky Sword Prison categorize you as an intermediate standard in the third level. From what I can see, your power could be at the top of the third level and you could totally see through my martial art movement. That’s rather impressive.” Universe God Long Xiu said. He felt rather complicated at the bottom of his heart.

He was fast and his divine body was extremely strong. His martial art movement was widely recognized as the top in Sky Sword Prison.

However, his power was actually not too strong. He had only created an ordinary Real God unique skill and he had never once comprehended the Power of Heaven Way. His true power was merely at the intermediate standard of the third level, but because of his terrifying martial art movement, he was listed at the top of the third level.

But then, Jian Wushuang saw through his martial art movement, so it was rather difficult for him to put his greatest advantage to full play. He naturally couldn’t do anything about Jian Wushuang.

“It’s a pity that I’ve never once understood the Power of Heaven Way. Otherwise, I would be confident of killing him,” Universe God Long Xiu took a glance at Jian Wushuang and immediately shook his head, “Jian Wushuang, you’re lucky. See you again soon.”

Then, Universe God Long Xiu moved and he retreated to the back.

However, he had just started. Vroom. A boundless blazing quicksand erupted. Suddenly, it covered the entire universe and engulfed Universe God Long Xiu within.

When the blazing quicksand took effect, Universe God Long Xiu’s speed was affected. He started frowning.

“Jian Wushuang, what are you trying to do?” Universe God Long Xiu roared.

“What am I trying to do? Hehe, I told you earlier. If it’s possible, I’d like to take your head down. You thought I was kidding?” Jian Wushuang smiled and moved forward to him.

“Kill me? Haha. That’s funny. The entire Sky Sword Prison, besides Heartless King, who was one of the four kings, who else could kill me? Jian Wushuang, I suggest that you stop wasting time,” Universe God Long Xiu sneered at him.

“Only the Heartless King could kill you? Hehe, I’m sorry. From today onwards, there will be a second person. This person will be me.” Jian Wushuang smirked.

Universe God Long Xiu’s face grew dim.

“Universe God Long Xiu, the reason you are afraid of Heartless King is that the Heartless King is good at consciousness attacks, right?” Jian Wushuang’s laughter continued to spread.

He had read information about the four Kings in Sky Sword Prison. Heartless King was one of them and also the only Real God who was good at consciousness attacks in the entire Sky Sword Prison.

Universe God Long Xiu was extremely fast and known to be the top in martial art movement. His divine body was extremely strong too. In terms of material attack, he had almost no weaknesses.

Among the four Kings, the other three were good at material attacks. Hence, they couldn’t kill him.

However, Universe God Long Xiu’s consciousness wasn’t strong.

Compared to his divine body, speed, and martial art movement, his consciousness was his only weakness!

“Universe God Long Xiu, try to take this!”

Jian Wushuang’s voice was heard again. At that very moment, there was a strong crimson light from his eyes.

The crimson light was like a crimson sun, extremely harsh to the eyes.

Eighteen Asura Hell descended directly.

As Jian Wushuang’s soul strength reached the limit of a Universe God, the technique was even scarier than before.

Although Universe God Long Xiu was back facing Jian Wushuang, as long as he was shined on by the crimson light, he would fall into a phantasmagoria.

“No!”

Universe God Long Xiu’s expression grew grave. He who was trapped in dreamland immediately went insane and started struggling.

“Break!”

“Break!”

Universe God Long Xiu bellowed in madness and his consciousness was quivering.

Actually, Universe God Long Xiu’s consciousness wasn’t weak. Among Peak Universe Gods in the Third Heaven it could be considered as impressive and he was only one step away from the limit of a Universe God.

However, such a level of consciousness was obviously insufficient before Jian Wushuang.

Rumble.

Universe God Long Xiu was raging with anger and his heart was extremely cold. Along with the bellow, he finally shook off from Eighteen Asura Hell.

Before he could be surprised, he immediately saw a dark light before him.

The dark light was actually a black longspear that gave out mysterious strength. The longspear appeared less than one meter away from her.

At such a close distance, he wouldn’t be able to dodge in time even if his martial art movement was amazing. He could only rely on his strong defense power to endure the black longspear.

Clang!

The black longspear hit his armor which was transformed from the robe that he was wearing and made a metal crashing sound but didn’t pierce it.

Just as Universe God Long Xiu wanted to let out a breath of relief, he realized the terrifying power from the longspear had pierced through his sea of consciousness. It was an Inextinguishable Light that Jian Wushuang performed with his all.

The Inextinguishable Light, with the support of the spear, was like a storm. It suddenly tore Universe God Long Xiu’s consciousness into pieces.

Universe God Long Xiu’s consciousness slowly dispersed. Before he died, he seemed to look in disbelief and be unwilling to admit defeat. He never thought that when the other three Kings in Sky Sword Prison couldn’t kill him he would die at the hands of a Universe God. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Besides, there was a look of relief in Universe God Long Xiu’s eyes.

Jian Wushuang stood there in silence as he watched Universe God Long Xiu fall. His eyes were cold.

“Being imprisoned in Sky Sword Prison, you and I have no choice but to seek our way out with our all!”

“Before I kill you, I want to say that you have killed many other experts, so you can’t blame me!”

Jian Wushuang muttered. Then, he appeared before Universe God Long Xiu’s dead body. He took away Universe God Long Xiu’s Qian Kun ring and the treasures on him. Then, he immediately took a look inside the Qian Kun ring. Very soon, Jian Wushuang was beaming with joy.

“Found it!”

“Universe God Long Xiu’s secret skill of martial art movement, Flowing Light Phantom!”
