Chapter 2756: Destroy The Heavenly Blood Alliance!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Won’t taking action against the Heavenly Blood Alliance means we’re acting against the Divine Demon Sect?” The entire hall fell into a brief silence after Xiao Tiexin spoke.

The Heavenly Blood Alliance alone was not too scary and with its current strength. The Sword Alliance was qualified to challenge the Heavenly Blood Alliance. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

However, the Divine Demon Sect was different.

It was one of the five top-tier forces in the Danyang Continent.

There were around a dozen first-rated forces with uncountable second-rated and third-rated forces in the Danyang Continent. However, there were only five pinnacle forces.

Those five pinnacle forces were deeply rooted and extremely strong. Those pinnacle forces would only fight among themselves under normal circumstances. Which other forces would dare to provoke them?

However, the Alliance Master wanted to take action against the Divine Demon Sect at that moment?

“Master, are you serious?” Xiao Tiexin looked toward Jian Wushuang.

“Of course, when I say we’re taking action against the Heavenly Blood Alliance—we’re taking action against it. There is nothing for our Sword Alliance to fear even if the Divine Demon Sect comes to cause us troubles later on.” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently before directly giving orders.

“Long Shan, immediately gather the Divine Sword Army and depart for the Heavenly Blood Alliance’s territory. You might travel past the territories of several forces on the way. If they are only second-rated or third-rated forces with no Grand Ultimate Gods personally attending to them—wipe them out to clear the path!”

“Dong Xue, get ready to completely take over the Heavenly Blood Alliance’s territory.”

“Yes.” Long Shan and Dong Xue nodded seriously.

“Master, what do you plan to do now...” Xiao Tiexin looked at Jian Wushuang.

“I’ll rush toward Heavenly Blood Alliance with Old Snake and our guest elders before the Divine Sword Army arrives. We’ll get rid of their three Grand Ultimate Gods,” said Jian Wushuang.

All those who were present were surprised when they heard that.

Alliance Master was going over at that moment to wipe out the Heavenly Blood Alliance’s Grand Ultimate Gods?

There were three Grand Ultimate Gods and one of them was even a High-level Grand Ultimate God?!

In addition, they only heard of an Elders’ Palace in the Sword Alliance but there was only one elder at that moment who was Old Snake, since when did the Sword Alliance have Guest Elders?

Jian Wushuang did not explain to them and directly made a move after giving his orders. Those traveling with him included Strange Old Tong, Jue Xin, Old Snake, An Ying, and Lan Junzhu.

The six of them traveled quickly and rushed toward the Heavenly Blood Alliance’s territory.

The six of them had already arrived in the skies above the Heavenly Blood Alliance’s lair in less than a day.

“Heavenly Blood City... The Heavenly Blood Alliance’s lair. Alliance Master Su Han, do you plan to take action against the Heavenly Blood Alliance?” Jue Xin looked toward Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang immediately nodded.

Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin frowned. “Are you joking? Alliance Master Su Han, don’t you know that the Heavenly Blood Alliance is being secretly supported by the Divine Demon Sect? There’s even a spatial passage in the Heavenly Blood Alliance that connects to the Divine Blood Sect’s lair according to rumors such that the Divine Blood Sect can immediately send experts over via the spatial passage once something happens to the Heavenly Blood Alliance.”

“Even if that’s true, so what? Is Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin afraid?” Jian Wushuang glanced at Jue Xin with a smile.

“I’m not afraid. It’s not difficult for us to wipe out a Heavenly Blood Alliance based on our strength, but I feel the more important matter is that we need to face the Divine Demon Sect thereafter. Is Alliance Master Su Han well prepared for that?” Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin asked.

Jian Wushuang smiled softly. “Don’t worry. I’m naturally prepared to face the Divine Demon Sect since I dare to take action against the Heavenly Blood Alliance. All of you have nothing to worry about. In addition, the Divine Demon Sect isn’t as scary as you guys imagined.”

“That’s right, it’s just a Divine Demon Sect. It’s not like I’ve never gone against them previously.” On the other hand, Strange Old Tong was completely fearless with excitement filling his eyes instead.

He had a huge grudge against the Divine Demon Sect from the beginning and was extremely excited when he heard they were taking action against the Divine Demon Sect.

“Alliance Master Su Han, we’ll fight whole-heartedly for the Sword Alliance since we’ve accepted your invitation. However, we’d need to warn you first that if we’re really placed in a terrible position—we won’t die for your Sword Alliance,” said Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin.

Jian Wushuang said with a smile, “I understand. All of you don’t need to worry as you’re just employees of my Sword Alliance. I won’t stop you from leaving if we’re at the brink of life and death. However, we should take action and get rid of the Heavenly Blood Alliance first.

“It’s not difficult to wipe out the Heavenly Blood Alliance as long as we have taken precautions against the Divine Demon Sect’s experts rushing over... Old Tong, can you sneak into the Heavenly Blood City and find where the spatial passage is? Please destroy the spatial passage the moment we take action.”

“Sure.” Strange Old Tong nodded as his figure had already skimmed toward the Heavenly Blood City’s entrance.

“Let’s wait here for a moment,” said Jian Wushuang.

Jue Xin, Old Snake, An Ying, and Lan Junzhu stood behind Jian Wushuang as they waited in silence.

Less than half an hour later, Strange Old Tong sent a message saying he had already found the spatial passage’s location and was hiding nearby—prepared to take action at any moment.

Jian Wushuang smiled when he received the message.

“Let’s go, it’s time for us to take action.” Jian Wushuang waved his hands as the group of five directly went toward the huge hall floating amid the void located at the heart of the city.

There was a thin layer of crimson light surrounding the hall which was a magic formation. It appeared to be quite unusual when they looked at it with their eyes hence it could be concluded to certainly be quite strong.

“Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin, I heard rumors about how you’re able to fight two High-level Grand Ultimate Gods while as just a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God. Your strength must have increased by leaps and bounds now that you’ve made a breakthrough. You’re the strongest among the six of us apart from Strange Old Tong. We shall rely on you to resolve this magic formation,” said Jian Wushuang with a smile.

“Sure.” Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin glanced at the crimson magic formation before nodding and took his battle saber out of its sheath.

Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin instantly moved and appeared in front of the crimson magic formation as he held the battle saber in his hands high.

A special essence started to slowly spread.

Heaven and Earth seemed to turn indistinct and lonely in an instant.

The void also became obscure as Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin’s figure could be faintly seen in the hazy area.

Whoosh!

A saber-light was directly sent forward.

The saber-light was extremely fascinating and dazzling yet also extremely elusive at the same time.

The saber-light skimmed past the void before a huge saber river appeared out of nowhere in the blink of an eye. It was as though an elusive region was being drawn.

The void was then swallowed by a wave of silence.

The saber-light wave had already cut onto the crimson magic formation.

Boom!!

A loud explosive sound could be heard before the crimson magic formation immediately brightened and revealed its powerful strength.

Endless crimson lights appeared and crazily endured the incomparable yet elusive slash.

The entire magic formation trembled crazily which already startled those many Heavenly Blood Alliance’s experts within the magic formation.
