Chapter 2432: Purple Light Phantom

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

The blinding sword-light flashed again. Obviously, Pang Tao had no mercy towards a lady as he completely exerted his sword skills. His speed had reached its very limit along with his non-stop attack strokes raining down on Zhuo Bing. Facing such sword skills, Zhuo Bing could only give her all to ward off those attacks, but it was incredibly difficult.

“Junior Sister, I’ll block him.”

Ling Dan rushed over and immediately blocked Pang Tao. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Are you sure you can?” Pang Tao chuckled, suddenly the power and speed of his hands surged even more.

Zhuo Bing and her coalition were already under immense pressure with only Pang Tao himself, not forgetting to mention that Pang Tao was not the only person she had to worry about. There were other disciples around who also wanted to take her down.

Zhuo Bing and the rest could not hold on much longer under their collective assaults.

“No, we can’t hold on much longer,” growled Su Tong quietly from the side.

“Damn! Do I really have to forgo the token that I have already acquired?” Zhuo Bing’s face turned frosty.

The position token right then was kept inside her Interspatial Ring. She would surely not want to give up something that she had already obtained.

However, the four of them had already fallen inside a deadly circle which was almost impossible to break out. In such a situation, if she did not release the token, she would perhaps have to break the safety token and leave Saint’s Tomb.

Even if they escaped, they would still have to leave the position token behind.

“We have no choice. Junior Sister, give it up for now. Let’s wait for another chance to take it back.” Ling Dan sent a message to Zhuo Bing.

He was the one who had to endure the biggest pressure among the four of them, as he had already taken some injuries when he tried helping Zhuo Bing to obtain the token. After that, he not only had to face Pang Tao, but another First-Class Divine Demon from the Great Compassion Sect was also targeting him. He was being completely overpowered and was just barely hanging on. If this continues for another short moment, he would have no choice but to break the safety token.

Seeing that was the case while still feeling extremely unwilling, Zhuo Bing gritted her teeth and made up her mind.

As long the verdant hills remained, there would be no shortages of firewood1.

Zhuo Bing had made up her mind to let go of the Position Token.

However, just as Zhuo Bing and her coalition were being pushed to the edge, no one realized that Jian Wushuang had already disappeared from where he stood outside the battlefield.

Jian Wushuang was already in the middle of the crowd at the battlefield’s center when he reappeared, standing right behind Zhuo Bing.

“Big Sister, need help?”

Without any fair warning, Jian Wushuang’s voice sounded next to Zhuo Bing’s ear.

Zhuo Bing shuddered and looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Little Brother, what are you doing here?” Zhuo Bing was shocked.

She had advised him many times not to get involved in the fight for the positions, not to even get too close to the battlefield in order to avoid giving Pang Tao any opportunity to attack him.

Jian Wushuang promised her during that time as well.

If that was the case, Why did Jian Wushuang directly appear on the battlefield?

“Go! Leave now!” Zhuo Bing yelled.

However, Jian Wushuang did not move.

On the side, Pang Tao had also noticed Jian Wushuang’s arrival.

“Haha! This kid came into the battlefield like an idiot, trying to help his big sis?” Pang Tao could not hide his excitement. “Right on! I was still wondering when I could kill him, and now he presented himself as a gift? Just as the saying goes, ‘You choose not the paved path to Heaven, but break into a gateless Hel1l’.”

Pang Tao’s eyes were also shining with a thick light of greed.

He immediately made up his mind after seeing Jian Wushuang.

“You two, keep Ling Dan busy,” instructed Pang Tao.

The other two First-Class Divine Demons from Great Compassion Sect immediately went up and kept Ling Dan in a tight web of attacks. With his hands being free, Pang Tao went straight to Jian Wushuang.

“Pang Tao, stop! I’ll give you the position token!” Zhuo Bing shouted.

Pang Tao sneered, “Position token? The position token would need time to fight over it, but Jian Wushuang is standing right in front of me.”

Pang Tao had no hesitation in his mind.

He had already calculated that there would still be enough time to fight for the position token after killing Jian Wushuang and obtaining Purple Blood Saint’s relics.

“Little Brother, run! Run now!”

Zhuo Bing shouted in a frenzy after seeing Pang Tao charging at Jian Wushuang with full ferocity.

However, Jian Wushuang did not have any intention to escape. He looked straight at Pang Tao.

The Blood Mountain Sword had appeared with a flip of his palm. Jian Wushuang then immediately shifted his figure and took the initiative to charge at Pang Tao.

“You wanna die!”

Not only did Pang Tao not feel any anger, but he also laughed in return wich his facial expression becoming vicious. “Boy, you’re the one who’s seeking death, don’t blame me.”

“Die!”

With a ring, a blinding sword-light lit up.

It was like a little sun, shining across the lands.

Many people around shut their eyes because of the sword’s brightness.

That stroke had contained Pang Tao’s killing intent and hatred, which were absolutely terrifying. Most importantly, his speed was incredibly fast.

It was so fast that nobody around could offer assistance.

“Little Brother!”

Zhuo Bing opened her eyes wide, feeling desperate.

However, Jian Wushuang who was floating calmly had also moved the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

Schwing~ A poignantly beautiful sword-light flashed.

The sword-light contained a mild purple that looked incomparably gorgeous as it sliced through the void.

The purple sword-light was not blinding, but incredibly demonic, as if the shadows of a purple-colored phantom flying by.

The energy from it was calm and leisurely, not as devastating as Pang Tao’s stroke.

However, it was such a stroke that made Pang Tao’s pupils slightly shrink when the beautiful purple light flashed by. “This stroke doesn’t seem usual.”

Right when Pang Tao noticed something...

Slash!

Jian Wushuang and Pang Tao had passed by each other.

Jian Wushuang stood behind Pang Tao with his sword in one hand.

“Sword like shadows. Sword like spirits.”

Drive the sword with shadows. Drive the sword with spirits. So very beautiful like the shadows and spirits!”

In the Purple Blood Sword Principle that Purple Blood Saint created, the third form—Purple Light Phantom—is actually the most beautiful stroke.”

Jian Wushuang wore a mild smile on his face and mumbled to himself as blood was dripping on the tip of his Blood Mountain Sword.

As if time and space were frozen.

The many genius disciples, including Zhuo Bing, Ling Dan, Zhong Yi, and Su Tong had all stopped their motions and looked at his direction.

Shocked filled their eyes.

Many people did not see clearly what actually had happened, they could only see that Pang Tao stood like a statue in one place, frozen. His eyes were hollow but filled with absolute horror and with even more disbelief.

“I, I...”

He opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but those two words were all he could let out.

Phew!

A gust of wind blew by and a sizable head went flying.
