Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Make all Sword Principle Warriors envious?” Jian Wushuang smiled silently and then nodded his assent.

Sword Soul determined one’s gift in Sword Principle.

Jian Wushuang’s Strongest Sword Soul represented that he had the strongest gift in Sword Principle, which was sufficient to fill any Sword Principle Warrior with envy and admiration.

“Even though you’re just my nominal disciple, I’ll try my best to guide you,” Xuan Yi looked at Jian Wushuang and asked, “In the past half year, you spent most of your energy meditating on the three sword scars. But I guess you’ve also improved your comprehension of the Dao, right?”

“I did improve it to some extent,” Jian Wushuang nodded and said, “I’ve been comprehending the World Dao and Slaughter Dao simultaneously. I’ve fully comprehended the second Occult of the World Dao and have a basic understanding of the third Occult. I also comprehended the second Occult of the Slaughter Dao a few days ago.”

Half a year.

In the past half year, Jian Wushuang stayed in the Sword Tower to meditate on the sword scars in the daytime and returned to Enlightenment Mountain to comprehend the Dao at night.

His comprehension of the Dao while at Enlightenment Mountain was three times quicker than it would be outside. With the talent endowed by the Heaven-treading Realm, his two Original Bodies had made amazing progress in just half a year.

For example, after Feng became the disciple of Palace Master Destruction, he received personal guidance from Palace Master Destruction and some cultivation resources which Palace Master Destruction acquired for him. However, he had only comprehended the second Occult of the Destruction Dao, which was slower than Jian Wushuang.

“Without any instruction and cultivation resources, it’s very impressive for you to have made such progress with only the use of Enlightenment Mountain in the past half year,” Xuan Yi nodded slightly and then said solemnly, “I’m not proficient in the World Dao or the Slaughter Dao. I can’t compare with Palace Master Baiyu and Mo Tao in terms of comprehension on these two Daos. Nevertheless, my vision is far broader than them.”

“There are many resources in the Ancient Sect that could be of great help to your cultivation, but very few of them actually suit you!”

“I’ll apply for a batch of cultivation resources for you according to your actual situation. Go back to Enlightenment Mountain and wait. I’ll have those resources delivered to you soon.”

“Thank you, Master,” Jian Wushuang expressed his gratitude.

“Go back and continue your cultivation. Don’t disgrace me in the Sect Competition which is being held one and a half years from now,” Xuan Yi said.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded solemnly and left.

Xuan Yi sat alone in the Sword Tower.

He thought,?“This little boy is extremely talented. He’s reached this level in the World Dao and Slaughter Dao while comprehending Sword Principle. Among the treasures which are suitable for him, which ones should I choose?”

He began to select resources for Jian Wushuang.

As he said, he might not have the same understanding towards the World Dao and Slaughter Dao as Palace Masters Baiyu and Mo Tao did, but his vision was extremely broad. He knew which treasures were useful and beneficial for Jian Wushuang, as well as which ones were a waste.

He quickly made up his mind.

“The Nine-world Picture, which dissects the nine Occults of the World Dao into various world essences, is the most suitable resource for this little boy to comprehend the World Dao.”

“In terms of Slaughter Dao, the Slaughter Book, left by Zhuo Ming, should be sufficient.”

“As for Sword Principle… he has a deep comprehension of Sword Principle now. If he wants to go further, he has to condense his Sword Heart. It’s too difficult, so it’s impossible for him in a short period of time. He doesn’t need any resources for the cultivation of Sword Principle right now. Listening to the lectures or meditating on the third sword scar is enough for him.”

“I’ll give him a Dao Origin Fruit. That will be sufficient for him to keep cultivating for a while.”

…

Not long after Jian Wushuang returned to Enlightenment Mountain, he received the cultivation resources which Xuan Yi acquired for him.

Nine-world Picture, Slaughter Book, and a Dao Origin Fruit?

He was shocked at the cultivation resources.

They were all useful for his comprehension of the Dao. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The Nine-world Picture and Slaughter Book were used to assist his cultivation in the World Dao and Slaughter Dao. As for the Dao Origin Fruit…

Jian Wushuang was no stranger to the Dao Origin Fruit. During the Firmament Territory Feast, the first prize of the third-round arena battle was 1,000,000 Divine Gems and, more importantly, a Dao Origin Fruit.

It was a precious treasure which could help in comprehending the Dao.

Even in a top Sect like the Ancient Sect, where there were numerous Dao Origin Fruits, they were still highly valued.

Jian Wushuang was allocated a Dao Origin Fruit because of Xuan Yi and his own amazing talent. Especially the fact that he comprehended two of the sword scars within half a year had shocked the whole Ancient Sect, so the high officials agreed to give him a Dao Origin Fruit after discussing it.

Under normal circumstances, even personal disciples of Palace Masters could not receive a Dao Origin Fruit if they had not shown amazing talent.

As for the Nine-world Picture and Slaughter Book…

The Slaughter Book was the record of the Slaughter Dao comprehension experiences of an Eternal Realm expert named Zhuo Ming, who had completely comprehended the nine Occults of the Slaughter Dao.

Each of the 101 words in the Slaughter Book contained concepts related to the Occults of the Slaughter Dao.

Jian Wushuang could comprehend the Slaughter Dao by reading each word in the book.

“The Slaughter Book is similar to the Six-story Pagoda that was given to me by Elder Di Jing. The Six-story Pagoda is more complicated and involves a wider range. The Slaughter Book is simpler, but every word is extremely profound…”?Jian Wushuang thought with a surprised smile on his face.

He already had the Six-story Pagoda to help him comprehend the Slaughter Dao. Now, he also had the Slaughter Book, which would make his comprehension even easier.

As for the Nine-world Picture…

The Nine-world Picture was even more wonderful. It contained nine pictures, a flower, a tuft of grass, a stone, a tree, a lake, a mountain, a piece of cloud, a drop of water, and a person.

They all seemed to be simple and ordinary. However, after careful observation, Jian Wushuang discovered that each picture was a complete world.

Nine pictures that were equal to nine complete worlds and were full of concepts on the Occults.
