4730 The Seven Sons Fighting for the Peach

The six Princes were all on the move. Although they all had friendly smiles on their faces, there was already an undercurrent.

This was the best time to show off. It was directly related to their position in the hearts of Emperor Zhen Wuyang and the 100 Elders.

In the past few fights for the Peach, Prince Jiu had become an existence that stood above everyone else. Even the Elders had taken a liking to him and had the intention of replacing the Young Emperor.

Therefore, all the Princes tried their best to push their cultivation to the peak. After all, they could only get more attention by reaching the end.

Just as all the Yan Immortals finished their preparations and were heading down to the Heavenly Realm, a calm voice rang out in the Heavenly Court. “Imperial Father, I’ll participate in the battle for the Peach this time.”

The Zhen Wuyang and all the Yan Immortals in the Heavenly Court were stunned for a moment, and then they all looked at him.

The Young Emperor stood up slowly and glanced at the group of Yan Immortals.

“Yan’er, Are you sure?” Zhen Wuyang also stood up, and there was a hint of joy in his eyes.

“I’ve never participated in it before, which is why some people have ignored my existence. This time, I just want them to know what’s important and what’s not.” The Young Emperor’s voice was low and majestic as he looked at the Yan Immortals below him without hesitation.

The six Princes looked at each other at the same time, and their expressions were completely different.

Prince Jiu did not speak, but his hands were tightly clenched under his sleeves. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Good. Yan’er, it’s been a long time since I’ve seen your cultivation level. Today is a good opportunity for me to take a look.” Zhen Wuyang laughed heartily. At the same time, he waved his sleeve and said, “Someone, tell Cheng Qing to get his ass in here. Tell him to accompany Yan’er to the event.”

“No need, Imperial Father. I don’t need Cheng Qing this time,” the Young Emperor said and looked at Jian Wushuang.

Their eyes met. He said, “Brother Jian, can you come with me?”

All the Yan Immortals looked at Jian Wushuang again.

Zhen Wuyang also looked at Jian Wushuang. The divine consciousness of an Emperor was beyond imagination and could easily see through everything he wanted to know.

Soon, he was a little confused. This kid was only in the Yan Immortal stage. Other than his amazing talent, his physique seemed to be a little unique. Even he could not see through him.

At the same time, he had an indescribable feeling. Even though this youth’s Yan Immortal realm was not that profound, he looked extremely comfortable, as if there was some unknown level of connection.

Zhen Wuyang retracted his divine consciousness and nodded. “Go, Yan’er.”

To the silent and shady Eldest Prince who never liked to reveal his talents, once he had decided on something, even as an Emperor, it was difficult for him to change his mind.

The Young Emperor suddenly came in front of Jian Wushuang and said, “Let’s go. It seems that they can’t wait any longer.”

Without much hesitation, Jian Wushuang nodded and walked out of the Heavenly Court.

The skinny purple-robed man suddenly grabbed Jian Wushuang’s arm. He seemed to want to say something to Jian Wushuang with his cloudy eyes, but in the end, he only said in a low voice, “I’ll leave the Young Emperor to you.”

The Young Emperor walked forward and patted the thin purple-robed man’s shoulder before walking out of the Heavenly Court with Jian Wushuang.

The flowing clouds swirled, and the power was vast.

Standing outside the Heavenly Court, all the Yan Immortals scattered down. The six Princes also brought their respective companions and descended to the Heavenly Realm.

The fight for the Peach, which involved over 300 Yan Immortals, began.

Emperor Zhen Wuyang, who was sitting in the Heavenly Court, waved his hand, and an ethereal picture scroll formed by Yan power was reflected in the hall.

The scene within the scroll was the brilliant Heavenly Realm.

“Everyone, guess who will be the winner of this battle for the Peach?” Zhen Wuyang asked.

“It should be Second Prince.” A long-bearded old man stroked his beard and laughed.

Another black-robed Elder retorted, “The Fourth Prince is not weak either.”

“The Third Prince is the one who might be able to take the Immortal Peach. If I’m not wrong, he has a basic understanding of the immortal style.”

The hundreds of Elders in the Heavenly Court all expressed their opinions, but they all pointed to the Second, Third, and Fourth Princes.

Zhen Wuyang seemed to have another answer. He looked at Uncle Yu, who was standing next to him like a statue, and said, “Yu Chang, what do you think?”

Uncle Yu raised his head and looked at the sky with his dark and deep eyes, as if he could see through the clouds.

“The little guy beside the Young Emperor is not ordinary.”

“So you also think that he’ll win the Immortal Peach this time?”

“The Young Emperor is a calm and composed person. He won’t do anything he’s not confident in. Once he makes a move, everything will be set in stone.”

After hearing what Uncle Yu said, Zhen Wuyang stopped talking. Together with the other Elders, they carefully looked at the painting.

Among the vast clouds, two black-robed figures dressed as Rangers sat upright in the clouds. They did not seem to be in a hurry to fight for the Immortal Peach, but rather seemed to be traveling.

The Heavenly Realm that carried the entire Heavenly Court was completely formed by rivers and rivers, and it was quite mysterious and vast.

“How confident do you think we are to make it to the end of this?” The Young Emperor shouted on the empty flowing cloud as if he was afraid that Jian Wushuang could not hear him.

Jian Wushuang replied, “I don’t know. I’ll try my best.”

“Then what if my brothers come to kill us again?”

“That’s easy. We’ll just kill our way back. But I think they’ll be more restrained in the Heavenly Court. At most, they’ll just do some small tricks.”

“No matter what, I’m going to get the Immortal Peach this time. There can’t be a single mistake.”

“You’re so confident? I can feel that your disciples have a deep resentment towards you. Perhaps they will join forces to surround you.”

“What, are you scared?” The Young Emperor raised his eyebrows and asked.

“Of course I’m scared. I’ve been dragged into this for no reason. I still want to live for a few more years,” Jian Wushuang said leisurely as he lay in the clouds.

The Young Emperor pouted. “Those who can become Yan Immortals don’t care about longevity. You, an old monster who has lived for God knows how many years, are also so attached to Immortality?”

Jian Wushuang felt very helpless. It had been less than ten million years since he started cultivating, but now he was called an old monster, which added to his old age for no reason.

Moreover, he could not explain it as there were too many implications. It was extremely likely that he would cause unnecessary trouble because of a slip of the tongue.

Even the Yan Immortals of the great Yan domain would find it hard to imagine a Yan Immortal with a lifespan of only a few million years.

After some perfunctory talk, the Young Emperor pulled the two of them into the Heavenly Realm.

In the roaring and surging water, two figures were moving forward.

A Yan Immortal who was also participating in the fight for the Peach passed by. He only glanced at them and quickly dodged.

Until the very last moment, none of the Yan Immortals were willing to fight with the Princes of Emperor Zhen Wuyang.
