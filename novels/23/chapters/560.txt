Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Currently, there was a frigid atmosphere in the hall.

Temple Master Iceberg stared at Jian Wushuang with a grim look and Jian Wushuang looked him directly in the eye. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Fine.” After a long time had passed, the master finally spoke. “Since you don’t have the compass, just leave.”

Jian Wushuang retreated without hesitation.

While watching Jian Wushuang walk away, Temple Master Iceberg had a vicious look in his eyes and he clenched his fists so tightly that his fingernails almost pierced his skin.

“Jian Wushuang, since you’re being stubborn, don’t blame me for being merciless.”

After exiting Temple Master Iceberg’s palace, Jian Wushuang let out a sigh of relief.

“Luckily, even though Temple Master Iceberg is desperate to get that compass, he didn’t go crazy and try to kill me inside the Holy Place.”?Jian Wushuang thought.

Just now, he had been worried that the master would really try to kill him. If so, he had no confidence in his ability to survive.

“He let me go this time, but I’m sure he won’t hesitate if he ever gets the chance to kill me.”

Jian Wushuang had spotted the killing intent in Temple Master Iceberg’s eyes.

“Compared to Emperor Golden Snake, Temple Master Iceberg is a more difficult opponent. He’s completely overbearing and hypocritical.

“Emperor Golden Snake tried to kill me to get revenge for his son. At least that was reasonable. As for Temple Master Iceberg...”?A chilling light flashed in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

“If only I was stronger than him!”

Jian Wushuang growled silently, unwilling to accept the fact that he was still too weak.

Because of him, Jian Wushuang had been forced to risk his life in the battle with Emperor Golden Snake, and even now, he was being pushed into a corner again. Yet, he had to bare it all because he was too weak.

Currently, he had hit a bottleneck and the only way to greatly improve his power was by condensing the nine Origin Marks so that he could reach the level of Flying to the Ninth Heaven.

Other than that, any improvement in the Bone Fusion Technique and Sword Principle might be helpful as well.

With that in mind, Jian Wushuang immediately went to the Monster-exterminating Pagoda and exchanged for the 10th Level of the Bone Fusion Technique.

The tenth level was very precious, so purchasing it required a lot of Monster Cores. Luckily, Jian Wushuang had gained enough cores from Emperor Golden Snake’s Interspatial Ring, enabling him to purchase it.

As for the highest levels, the 11th and 12th levels could not be acquired using Monster Cores.

Those two Levels were of great value and could not even be found in the Monster-exterminating Pagoda.

The only way to obtain them was to go to the fifth floor of the Earth Core Palace, where the relic was stored, and comprehend them directly.

However, there was a high requirement for cultivators to enter that floor, and even Jian Wushuang, who was a Divine Emperor, did not meet that requirement for the time being.

After going back to his residence, Jian Wushuang started to practice the 10th Level of the Bone Fusion Technique.

The further he progressed, the harder it became. It had taken him a half month to master Level Nine.

Obviously, it would take him more time to master the 10th Level.

Time went by slowly.

In the monster spies’ information center, an elder had just finished reading a message and began to frown.

“Why hasn’t Sword Emperor left the Holy Place even once during the last two months?”

The elder was using every source available to him in the Human Territory to keep an eye on Jian Wushuang.

Therefore, he knew Jian Wushuang’s every action.

“Sword Emperor acquired the 10th Level of the Bone Fusion Technique two months ago, and it seems that he has been cultivating ever since then. I thought he would leave the Holy Place and enter the military camp or Monster Territory after he became a Divine Emperor. However, I was wrong. I’m afraid that he won’t come out until he has mastered the 10th Level.

“Few Temple Masters have managed to master the 10th level and he is only in the Saint Realm, so I don’t know how long we’ll have to wait for him to come out,”?The elder pondered.

In the past, it wouldn’t have bothered him at all to wait. But now, it was a direct order from Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, and he was very eager to get the compass, so he had already urged the elder to seize it three times.

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor will be mad if I don’t present the compass to him within the near future.”

“There is no use waiting for him to leave the Holy Place willingly. I have to find a way to draw him out,”?The elder thought. He picked up a file from the desk, on which everything Jian Wushuang had done since he came to the Monster Continent was written in detail, including how he had been saved by the Wu Yan Tribe.

“Wu Yan Tribe...”?The elder raised his eyebrows.

“According to the file, Jian Wushuang lived in Wu Yan Tribe for over a month, and in order to disguise his identity as an outsider, he claimed to be one of them after he left there, so he must have a good relationship with them.

“Let me make some trouble for the Wu Yan Tribe.”?The elder smiled coldly.?“If the tribe gets into danger, Sword Emperor will definitely leave the Holy Place to save them.”

The elder immediately issued his order.

Three days later, in the Green Hillock Tribe of the Human Territory.

The Green Hillock Tribe bordered Wu Yan Tribe. When Jian Wushuang was in Wu Yan Tribe, they had once caught a spy from the Green Hillock Tribe.

It was night, and the whole area was completely silent.

Five figures slowly approached the Green Hillock Tribe.

“Listen, our mission is to eliminate the Green Hillock Tribe. Do it as quickly and as cruelly as possible. We have to scare the Wu Yan Tribe and force their leader to ask Sword Emperor for help.”

“Understood.”

The five figures discussed their plans in a low voice before finally arriving at the entrance to the Green Hillock Tribe.
