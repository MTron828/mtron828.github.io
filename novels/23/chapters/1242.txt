Chapter 1243: Summit Battle!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The harsh wind was whistling, and the golden longspear pierced through Jian Wushuang’s head like lightning, but it appeared not to have touched the flesh.

“Is it a residual shadow?” The monarch of the Jin Kingdom was shocked.

A ghostly figure appeared beside the monarch of the Jin Kingdom, and with a slight chuckle the voice rang out, “Sir, you’re too slow!”

Immediately after these words, the sword lit up.

“Spell of Disturbance!”

“Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!”

Thousands of sword shadows instantly appeared.

After the three strongest levels of the Sword Principle were integrated, the swordsmanship of Jian Wushuang had been instantly metamorphosized and upgraded.

The current Spell of Disturbance was at least dozens of times stronger than before.

Thousands of sword shadows were coming down toward the monarch of the Jin Kingdom. And before the sword shadows arrived, Jian Wushuang’s horrible Soul Attack had already been in full force.

Jian Wushuang had just killed nearly two thousand Holy Masters of the Jin Kingdom by means of Soul Attack, which demonstrated just how strong his Soul Attack was.

His Soul Attack had been used for a wide range earlier, but now it was focused on one person.

When the Soul Attack came, the monarch of the Jin Kingdom felt a slight sting in his mind.

And this stinging was getting stronger and stronger with the unceasing swordsmanship attacks from Jian Wushuang.

“Humph!”

The monarch of the Jin Kingdom grunted and repeatedly attacked with his longspear.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

The continuous crashes resounded through the air; the sky was rocked by each crash. There were nearly one hundred crashes per second.

In other words, there had almost been one hundred head-on impacts between Jian Wushuang and the monarch within such a short time.

“This, this speed…”

At the perimeter of the battlefield, the experts of the two camps were staring with terror at the center of the battlefield broken into pieces.

They could feel the power of the impact, but their strength was not enough for them to clearly see the details of the fight between Jian Wushuang and the monarch.

Too fast!

Both Jian Wushuang and the monarch of the Jin Kingdom were too fast.

Even the Universe Masters were unable to see clearly.

“If I was in a battle with such speed and power, I would have already died,”?thought the Redsnow King of the Jin Kingdom with a shocked face.

He had been aware of the strength of the monarch of the Jin Kingdom, and therefore he was not surprised at his battle strength.

But he did not know that Jian Wushuang could also be so powerful.

About two thousand years before, he had been sent to assassinate Jian Wushuang with several other Universe Masters of the Jin Kingdom. At that time, Jian Wushuang could not compete with them at all and escaped.

But now, Jian Wushuang was able to compete with the monarch, who had always been supreme in the eyes of the Redsnow King.

“This is power at the level of Universe God!”

Long Xu King of the Jin Kingdom was also standing on the battlefield. His body was trembling, and he had an extremely complicated look on his face.

He had always wished to become a Universe God, even in his dreams. But unfortunately, he was still far from it.

He was not surprised at the monarch’s powerful strength because the monarch was a Universe God. But he wondered why Jian Wushuang was also so powerful.

“Although he has made a breakthrough, he is only a Universe Master. How is it possible that a Universe Master is able to compete with the monarch?” Long Xu King was shocked.

There were many invincible Universe Masters in the Eternal Chaotic World, and he was one.

However, an invincible Universe Master was only invincible among Universe Masters. He would always be inferior to a Universe God.

He had never heard of a Universe Master competing with a Universe God in the Eternal Chaotic World.

But today, he had seen it.

A Universe Master had really contended with a Universe God, and their strength was quite equal.

At the center of the battlefield, Bang! Bang! The figures of Jian Wushuang and the monarch crashed into each other fiercely again and again.

“Red Shadow!”

The Divine Power was rolling in the hands of the monarch and then gathered onto the longspear.

The spear had not yet been thrust, but the world around it had already rocked madly.

The power of the longspear accumulated and finally burst out, leaving only a phantom in the Void.

The longspear shot out like lightning.

Jian Wushuang gritted his teeth and disfigured his face. Then the Blood Mountain Sword instantly flew out from his hand.

“The unique skill of swordsmanship! The Stroke of Dawn,” Jian Wushuang shouted.

The two terrifying attacks collided.

For a time, the sky and the earth were shattering.

After this impact, the monarch obviously could not resist the force. He could not help but fall back a few steps before he could regain his stance.

“His strength is even more powerful than My Divine Power?”??The monarch could not believe it.

He did not know that Jian Wushuang had an Inverse Cultivation. Although Jian Wushuang was just a Universe Master, Inverse Cultivation could upgrade his strength to a higher level.

In other words, a Universe Master with Inverse Cultivation was almost as powerful as a Universe God.

More importantly, Jiang Wushuang’s Inverse Cultivation had been integrated with the strongest three levels of Sword Principle. Moreover, Jiang Wushuang was a Four-Star Imperial God at the highest level.

In addition, Jian Wushuang also had the Blood-Killing Plate Armor, which could burst out Stage Two power and cause his offensive power to skyrocket again.

All of these had made the current Jian Wushuang extremely powerful. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Jiang Wushuang was not inferior to a Universe God with Divine Power.

As a Universe Master in defiance of the natural order, he could overwhelm a Universe God.

It was because Jian Wushuang was a Universe Master in defiance of the natural order.

“He is not only better than me in terms of power, but his speed is also faster than mine. As for the defense…”

The monarch could not help but think of the scene where Jian Wushuang had taken his longspear with bare hands.?“If I was facing a longspear like that, I would never have had the guts to take it with bare hands,”?he thought.

“Jian Wushuang must have a very strong Divine Body that is beyond my imagination.”

“He is just a Universe Master, but he is better than me in terms of strength, speed, and defense,”?the monarch asked himself.

He raised his head and cast a look to Jian Wushuang like a fierce beast.

“If I cannot have the upper hand in terms of strength, speed, and defense, then I must resort to my unique skills.”

The monarch screamed, and his Divine Power was tumbling. Immediately there was a huge ocean formed by the Divine Power spreading around.

His whole body was filled with a horrible aura, and his eyes became scarlet.

A golden Thunderbolt was rising slowly from his golden longspear.

The experts of the two camps around the battlefield were all horrified. Everyone held his breath and looked over to the monarch.
