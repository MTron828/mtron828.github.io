Chapter 502: The Wu Yan Tribe

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

There were numerous plane-worlds in the Ancient World.

The world with the Divine Land at its center was just one of those plane-worlds.

Outside the Divine Land, there were a large number of places with a considerable number of warriors, who were as powerful as those in the Divine Land or even more powerful than them.

The Monster Continent was one of those places and was more vast than the Divine Land.

A purple crescent moon hung high in the sky, and the world was bathed in its blurry moonlight.

In a desolate land, the void was suddenly cut open. And from the crack, a figure shot out, who eventually fell to the ground battered and exhausted.

That figure was Jian Wushuang. And after he crashed to the ground, he found the pain inside him even more unbearable.

“My body!”

Jian Wushuang’s face flushed red in great pain.

When he had tried to defeat Su Ming, he displayed the third movement of the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill.

That movement had put too heavy a burden on his body. In addition to that, he had been severely crushed by the space inside the wormhole, which made his wound even worse. As a result, he passed out not long after falling to the ground.

The next morning—

“Hurry! Uncle Dragon must be waiting for us. He will blame us for being late.”

“Brother Qing Hu, wait for me.”

“Haha, let’s see who will be the first one to get to Uncle Dragon.”

A group of teenagers was running quickly and cheerfully.

There were seven of them in total. The older ones were 14 or 15 years old, while the younger ones were eight or nine.

Children as they were, they still moved so fast that they could cross hundreds of meters in the blink of an eye.

Among them, a round-faced girl with a ponytail followed behind the boys. She was only eight and was the youngest one.

Suddenly, the girl stopped running, attracted by someone lying off to the side.

“Little Yu, what are you doing?” An older boy who wore an animal skin turned back toward the girl.

“Brother Qing Hu, look, there is someone lying on the ground,” the girl said to him.

“Huh?” The boy came over and said, “He’s alive, but it looks like he is badly wounded.”

“Brother Qing Hu, we must save him,” the girl suggested. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Ok.” The boy, Qing Hu, nodded. He turned to the other boys who had gathered around, saying, “You guys go to see Uncle Dragon yourselves. Little Yu and I have to go back now. Please apologize for us to Uncle Dragon.”

“Sure,” they replied to him.

Then, Qing Hu said, “Little Yu, let’s take him home.”

The girl nodded. She walked over to Jian Wushuang and held him over her head by his back with both hands.

Though Jian Wushuang was not strongly built, he was a tall and robust adult, weighing over 70 kilograms.

However, the girl held him up without any effort.

“Let’s go!” Qing Hu called out.

The girl immediately started running while carrying Jian Wushuang.

The people in the Divine Land would have been stunned beyond words if they had witnessed this scene.

When Jian Wushuang finally regained consciousness, two days had passed.

He woke up to find himself in a camp with a round-faced girl about eight or nine years old looking at him.

Upon seeing Jian Wushuang open his eyes, the girl beamed and cried out, “Dad, he’s woken up!”

A burly man who was making tea in the center of the camp immediately walked over to them.

“Brother, you’ve finally woken up.” The burly man spoke gently even though he looked rough.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed at the sight of the man.

“He is not only a lord, but a superior lord, and may even be more powerful than that,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

He had reached that conclusion because he could feel the man’s aura constricting him.

“Where am I?” Jian Wushuang asked while looking around.

“You’re in the Wu Yan Tribe, and I’m the leader of this place. You can call me Wu Yuan, and she is my daughter, Wu Yu,” the burly man answered. “Two days ago, my daughter found you on the back of our mountain and brought you here.”

Jian Wushuang took a look at the girl. A bit fat but lovely, the girl blinked her large dark eyes.

Seeing Jian Wushuang stare at her, she gave him a smile.

“Thank you so much for saving my life,” Jian Wushuang said gratefully.

“You’re welcome. We’re both human beings and should help each other.” Wu Yuan smiled. “By the way, what’s your name, brother? Which tribe are you from?”

“Tribe?” Jian Wushuang then realized that he was in a place that had many tribes.

“I’m Jian Wushuang.” He told them his real name.

Since he was no longer in the Divine Land, there was no need to conceal his name from others.

But Jian Wushuang decided to make up a story. “My tribe... was extinguished by other tribes.”

In his opinion, being that this place consisted of tribes, it would not be a surprise to learn that a tribe had fallen in a conflict with another one.

But to Jian Wushuang’s surprise, Wu Yuan looked grave when hearing this answer. He could see anger in the man’s eyes. The man shouted, “Bastards! How can those tribes still fight against each other for their own benefits while we human beings are oppressed by Demonic Beasts?”

Jian Wushuang was stumped for words.

“Human beings are oppressed by Demonic Beasts?

“What Demonic Beasts?”

Jian Wushuang was confused.

“Chieftain! Chieftain!”

Suddenly, someone shouted from outside. Wu Yuan regained his previous manner. He looked at Jian Wushuang and said, “Brother, you’re seriously wounded and need a good rest. You can stay here for a while, just tell Yu’er what you need. I’ve got to go now.”

After saying this, Wu Yuan walked out of the camp.
