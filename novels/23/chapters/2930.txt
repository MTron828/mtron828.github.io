Chapter 2931: Jian Wushuang and Xue Dong King

——

The void near the Scarlet Castle was above a vast sea.

The endless sea water was flowing slowly, and the entire sea surface seemed very calm.

But this calm was quickly broken by someone.

“Xue Dong King, I asked you to make the first move,” Jian Wushuang stood there and said grandly.

“Haha, you’re so confident. In that case, I won’t stand on ceremony.” Xue Dong King laughed loudly and immediately took out a long saber. A majestic aura rose from his body.

Xue Dong King suddenly rushed forward.

At the same time, his body split into two, turning into two identical figures.

“Well, this is…” Jian Wushuang could not help being surprised.

When he saw the two figures, Jian Wushuang immediately understood that they were just illusions that Xue Dong King had used a special method.

However, these illusions were extraordinary, and even he could not tell which one was real.

It was not until Xue Dong King appeared in front of him and raised the long saber in his hand that Jian Wushuang was able to determine which one was real.

Buzz!

Xue Dong King struck out with his saber straight.

The saber light was dazzling and extremely domineering. It immediately formed a huge saber river in the void and spread toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang only smiled faintly. Divine power surged in his right hand. He raised the Blood Mountain Sword and directly faced the long saber.

When the long saber and the Blood Mountain Sword collided head-on, an extremely domineering power contained in the long saber immediately came into effect.

“This power…”

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. He staggered, but he could not help taking a few steps back.

The long saber took advantage of the situation and slashed toward Jian Wushuang’s head.

Jian Wushuang was surprised, but he immediately dodged to the side and dodged the saber.

“Your strength is not bad.” Jian Wushuang looked at Xue Dong King.

Xue Dong King’s strength was indeed impressive.

In that moment of collision, an extremely powerful force came from the long saber. It was much stronger than that of an ordinary Immortal Saint. Although it was not as strong as a True Saint, the gap between them was very small.

“Xue Dong King is indeed worthy of being a member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance at the Divine Master level. Now that he has reached the Immortal Saint-level, his strength has soared again. Although he is not comparable to a True Saint, he is definitely a top false saint,” Jian Wushuang thought.

There were two kinds of Immortal Saints.

False Saint and True Saint.

The False Saint was the most common type of Immortal Saint. Although his cultivation had indeed reached the Immortal Saint-level, he had not truly mastered the immortal body and could not fully display his strength.

True Saint, on the other hand, had completely mastered the immortal body and could perfectly display his strength. Such a True Saint was much more powerful than a False Saint.

For example, the Immortal Saints in the Golden Crow Nine Realms were almost all False Saints with different strengths.

As for True Saints, there were only two of them. One was the Bone Emperor, and the other was the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s Saint Hong.

Moreover, even if they were True Saints, there were differences in strength. Moreover, in the absolute beginning divine realm, True Saints were divided into seven levels, which represented seven different levels. These seven different levels could be based on their understanding of laws and Dao, there were also unique skills that showed that Saint Hong was only a rank one True Saint.

As for Bone Emperor, the publicly acknowledged number one expert in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, there were rumors that he had long reached the pinnacle of a rank one True Saint. There were also rumors that he had broken through to become a rank two True Saint, but no one knew how he did it.

“A top False Saint is indeed very powerful in the Inkstone Realm. No wonder the Evergreen Realm Lord was a little afraid of Xue Dong King.” Jian Wushuang chuckled.

The Evergreen Realm Lord and the other three Realm Lords in the Inkstone Realm were only False Saints and had average strength.

If it was a one-on-one fight, no one would be a match for the Xue Dong King.

“A Divine Master was able to block one of my strikes. You are qualified to be called a monster just because of that. Next…” The blood-thirsty smile on the Xue Dong King’s face was followed by his figure floating out again, two identical figures appeared at the same time.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

The two figures flashed one after another and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang in the blink of an eye.

Xue Dong king raised the long saber in his hand again and swung it at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang did not show any weakness. He had exerted his divine power and swordsmanship to the fullest.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

The low sound of metal colliding rang out continuously. Blood Mountain Sword and the long saber collided again and again. Each time, a large amount of power swept out and affected the sea surface below.

Huge waves immediately rose up from the calm sea surface.

Each of these huge waves was over a hundred feet tall and incomparably majestic. The entire sea seemed to be roaring and shrill due to the fierce battle between the two.

“Jian Yuan, is this all you’ve got?” Xue Dong King shouted in a low voice during the fierce battle.

He did not use his full strength, but even so, he still had an absolute advantage in the battle with Jian Wushuang, which made him somewhat dissatisfied.

Upon hearing Xue Dong King’s words, Jian Wushuang could not help but smile.

“After all, the opponent is a top false saint, and he is infinitely close to a True Saint. If I don’t use my secret skill or some other means, it will be a little difficult to fight.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly. The star power in his body… had been directly activated.

The seven-star secret skill had been used.

This secret skill instantly raised his realm from Advanced Great Divine Master to Peak Great Divine Master, and his divine power suddenly soared.

“Xue Dong King, now you and I will fight again.”

Jian Wushuang grinned and moved forward. The Blood Mountain Sword suddenly turned into a bolt of lightning and slashed out.

This sword move was extremely swift and fierce.

“Huh?”

Xue Dong King immediately sensed that Jian Wushuang’s sword move seemed to have increased in power. A trace of excitement flashed in his eyes, and he immediately brandished his long saber to meet it.

Clang!

There was a loud sound, but this time, both of them retreated at the same time. Xue Dong King’s right hand, which was holding the long saber tightly, was still a little troublesome.

“How can a Divine Master be so powerful?” Xue Dong King was shocked.

He did not know that Jian Wushuang had only used the seven-star secret skill. He had not used the divine punishment expert or the nine luminaries star armor.

He had not really guided the sword essence in the Blood Mountain Sword.

Even so, Jian Wushuang’s divine power was no weaker than his.

Once Jian Wushuang went all out, his battle strength would be at the True Saint level. Although he was not the best among the first stage True Saints, he was definitely not weak.
