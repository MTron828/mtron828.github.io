Chapter 178: Six Purple-masked Killers

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Ye Rufeng blocked the way of Upper Elder in Nine Emperors Sect, leaving him no chance to help. Meanwhile, inside the Sect, the situation was still one-sided.

“Go to hell!”

With towering sword essence, Jian Wushuang’s Triple-kill Sword formed a flowing light and fiercely pierced towards an expert of the Profound Yin Void Realm in the Nine Emperors Sect.

This expert had been badly wounded during the sneak attack. Now, only 70 percent of his strength was left.

However, when he saw Jian Wushuang’s attack coming towards him, his eyes glistened coldly.

“You are just of the Primordial Gold Core Realm! How dare you fight with me! Go to hell.”

While shouting, the expert of the Profound Yin Void Realm made a vast current of Earth Essence Realm issue from the raven-black long spear he held in his hand. He then aggressively jabbed the spear towards Jian Wushuang.

It seemed that even the void was pierced.

The power was monstrously strong.

The flowing light formed by the sword essence also violently slashed forward.

Clang!

The two horrible strengths collided and did battle. But it was obvious that the flowing light of sword essence had the absolute advantage, completely outclassing the other.

“What?” The warrior of the Profound Yin Void Realm was stunned, and he retreated awkwardly.

“Be careful. The fellow you were fighting with should be Jian Wushuang, who performed excellently in this year’s selection battle. He has been ranked first on the Earthly Dragon List.” Qu Nan, who was engaged in battle with two Golden Dragon Ambassadors beside him, couldn’t help shouting.

The Nine Emperors Sect had not participated in the selection battle this time, due to the lack of disciples ranking on the Earthly Dragon List.

Qu Nan had not recognized Jian Wushuang earlier. But he had heard about him before, and now that he had witnessed Jian Wushuang’s strength, he realized who he was.

“No.1 warrior on the Earthly Dragon List?”

The warrior of the Profound Yin Void Realm, who had been defeated by Jian Wushuang, looked cold with violent killing intent. “The first place on the Earthly Dragon List? So what? He is just of the Profound Gold Core Realm. I don’t believe that I can’t kill him.”

With a cold snort, this warrior of the Profound Yin Void Realm fiercely glided towards Jian Wushuang again.

Jian Wushuang curled the corners of his lips, sneering. Three sword essences were combined on the Triple-kill Sword and the strength suddenly burst out.

“The second move of Selfless Sword Technique!”

“Solipsistic Form!”

Boom!

Jian Wushuang had just displayed his strongest unique skill.

A fierce sword light raged out with overweening and monstrous momentum.

The man of the Profound Yin Void Realm pierced through the Void with his dark long spear and ruthlessly jabbed towards Jian Wushuang again.

But the disparity in strength was more obvious this time.

The sword light landed on the dark long spear. Horrible strength burst out, causing the spear to fly off. The sword light did not diminish, and continued its ruthless slash towards the body of the warrior of the Profound Yin Void Realm.

This man of the Profound Yin Void Realm was killed without even having a chance to struggle.

“Profound Yin Void Realm?” Jian Wushuang coldly sneered.

Normally, the top 20 geniuses on the Earthly Dragon List were on par with warriors of the Initial Yin Void Realm. The top 10 had battle strength near the Profound Yin Void Realm. An example was Ouyang Haotian who had battle strength matching that Profound Yin Void Realm.

But Jian Wushuang had killed Ouyang Haotian with a single slash.

Although the warrior of the Profound Yin Void Realm in front of him was more powerful than Ouyang Haotian, Jian Wushuang has still killed him with ease.

“What an idiot...”

Seeing these events unfold before him, Qu Nan could not help cursing secretly. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He had already warned the warrior of the Profound Yin Void Realm to be careful, but he had not heeded his advice and had ended up dead.

There were not many Yin Void experts in Nine Emperors Sect. Now, one more had perished. This made their situation worse. They were getting nearer to collapse.

Above the Void, the black-clothed Upper Elder of Nine Emperors Sect saw the events that had transpired below. He frowned and shouted in a deep voice. “Mr. Ghost Tiger, please take action, or our Nine Emperors Sect is over.”

“Ghost Tiger?” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened. At the same time, he noticed several vigorous breaths suddenly rising from the direction of the Nine Emperors Sect.

“Jian Wushuang, you chose to break into hell where there is no gate, when there were roads in heaven that you could have taken instead. Don’t think about going back alive today.” The cold laughter echoed. Six black spots suddenly appeared on the Void not far away.

The six black spots glided quickly and soon appeared in front of everybody.

The six figures were in black robes, and were wearing purple masks.

Undoubtedly, they were purple-masked killers from Blood Feather Tower.

With the appearance of the six purple-masked killers, Jian Wushuang, Yang Zaixuan, Su Rou, and several other Golden Dragon Ambassadors visibly paled.

“Six purple-masked killers, five of whom have reached the Exceptional Yin Void Realm, and there is one of the Peak of the Yin Void Realm.” Jian Wushuang frowned.

Jian Wushuang was aware that Blood Feather Tower valued his father and would have secretly dispatched many experts to guard him, so he was not surprised to see them.

However, he had not expected that their strength was so immense!

Among the six people, one was at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm, and the remaining five were all of the Exceptional Yin Void Realm!

Such a battle formation, together with the remaining Yin Void experts of the Nine Emperors Sect, could completely outclass them on overall strength.

The six purple-masked killers were standing on the Void with violent killing intent. Among them, the leader Ghost Tiger, who was at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm, looked below coldly. Finally, he fixed his eyes on Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang... and Golden Dragon Ambassadors, none of you can get away today!” Ghost Tiger said coldly, “Kill!”

Once he gave the order, the six purple-masked killers took action.

At this moment, a giant hand condensing vast power suddenly slapped towards the six purple-masked killers.

“Huh? There is a hidden expert?” Ghost Tiger was stunned, and then he sneered. “You are just at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm.”

On finishing his words, he thrust out a bloody light. The giant hand was broken into pieces.

“Go, go!”

Shui Minghao suddenly appeared above the Void. The giant hand had been created by him just now to hinder the six purple-masked killers.

“Jian Wushuang, the opponents’ strength is greater than we thought. We should retreat right away,” Shui Minghao shouted without stopping.

The Golden Dragon Ambassadors agreed and violently nodded.

They had wanted to retreat as soon as they saw the experts from Blood Feather Tower.

Yang Zaixuan and Su Rou looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang would decide whether they should retreat or continue to fight.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were icy.

“Six purple-masked killers, one at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm, five of the Exceptional Yin Void Realm...”

“With my current Cultivation of Spiritual Power at the peak of the Profound Gold Core Realm, I could enhance my power to the Initial Yin Void Realm if I use Soul-taking Secret Skill. Together with Supreme Gold Core, my strength will be powerful enough to match the Exceptional Yin Void Realm. In addition, my comprehension of sword essence is...Matching or outclassing an ordinary man at the Peak of the Yin Void Realm won’t be a problem.”

Jian Wushuang pondered over his options and made a decision.
