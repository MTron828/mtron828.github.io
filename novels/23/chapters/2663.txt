Chapter 2664: Be Mine!

“My divine power has skyrocketed again after making a breakthrough to Peak Earth Ultimate God realm. I should now be able to fight head-on with any Peak Earth Ultimate God I met when coupled with the improvement on Space-time Law.” Jian Wushuang clasped his hands tightly.

“Oh, right...”

Jian Wushuang was suddenly reminded of something and flipped his hand to take out a baby’s fist-sized golden stone.

Jian Wushuang stared strangely at the golden stone.

It was the golden stone he bought from the Star Picking Pavilion auction for the price of 5,000,000 Primordial Stones.

Jian Wushuang bought it despite no one being interested in the golden stone at the time because he felt faint traces of the Space-time fluctuation within the golden stone due to his familiarity with the Space-time Law.

He carefully looked into it after his purchase and was certain of the golden stone’s extraordinaire, but his understanding of Space-time Law was too low for him to find out more about the golden stone at that time.

He thought of trying again once his Space-time Law understanding had greatly improved.

Jian Wushuang sat down cross-legged, closed his eyes, and sent his soul power into the stone.

He soon sensed the space-time fluctuations in the golden stone again which was clearer this time.

He gradually formed a connection with the golden stone through those sensations.

The connection established was like a key to unlocking the secret chamber’s door as he finally discovered the mystery within the golden stone.

Rumbling...

Jian Wushuang felt his world turn and head buzzing.

He found himself in a huge Space-time Storm in the blink of an eye.

Huhuhu! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The Space-time Storm flooded all corners of the world with strangulation powers far more powerful than Jian Wushuang’s Space-time Blade.

Moreover, space-time was frozen in many places within the Space-time Storm’s coverage.

There were also pieces of space that were constantly being shattered up and reorganized.

It was indeed a huge Space-time World just like the Space-time World created by Jian Wushuang in Thousand Treasures Grand World.

However, its features and strength were much more powerful and impressive!

An extremely tall magnificent-looking golden palace gate was located right in the center of the Space-time Storm with a hint of mystery inside it. Jian Wushuang could sense the vast space-time powers within it which seemed to lead toward a different space-time.

Jian Wushuang was standing under the golden palace.

He raised his head to look at the awe-inspiring palace gate before him and was shocked to feel a great level of pressure.

“Where is this place?” Jian Wushuang was scanning his surroundings.

He knew he was inside a consciousness space.

Consciousness Spaces were simulations and the fact that it felt so real only meant the void existed in the real world!

A similar special space existed within the Ancient God Domain that had the same magnificent golden palace gates just like the one in front of him.

“So the magnificent golden gate before me is the mystery within this golden stone?” Jian Wushuang murmured.

Suddenly...

Buzz!

A primitive yet attractive breath of aura permeated from within the palace gates.

A mighty voice also came from the other side of the palace gate.

“Come through the Space-time gate, enter my Space-time Palace, and become one of my people!”

The voice seemed to contain some special magical power as it reverberated in Jin Wushuang’s ears again and again—refusing to go away for a long time.

Jian Wushuang stood under the golden palace gate and was completely startled.

He had inferred the golden stone’s true purpose.

The golden stone was a standard trial that would bring one’s consciousness into the golden palace gate’s Consciousness Space as long as they could sense the Space-time fluctuations in the golden stone and form connections with it. On the other side of the golden palace gates was the Space-time Palace mentioned by the voice!

Space-time Palace... There was also a Space-time Palace within the Sacred Palace housing a Space-time Beast in it which had helped him make great progress in understanding the Space-time Law.

Jian Wushuang could see that the Space-time Palace before him was unusual from its golden gate to the crazy Space-time Storm and astounding tactics coupled with the mysterious golden stone!

It was very likely made by some true top powers within the Ancient God Domain—the likes of Sacred Palace or even the Nine Realms of Golden Crow could be compared to.

Besides that, he could see from the name Space-time Palace to the tactics exposed to him—the palace was all about Space-time!

Jian Wushuang was able to arrive in that space with the golden stone’s help due to his familiarity with Space-time Law.

There were two paths laid before him.

“To go in or not?”

Jian Wushuang was hesitating.

According to the voice he heard, he would be a member of the palace once he crossed the golden palace gates. However, he knew nothing about the palace or what it did and also had no idea which camp he should be in.

Even if the Space-time Palace was in the same camp as the Three Great Sacred Realms in Ancient God Domain, it would be interesting for him to get into the Space-time Palace which might be guided by the Head of Three Divine Realms.

In addition, there was an important point in which he did not know where the strength of the Space-time Palace lay and whether it would be controlling the experts reporting to it.

He did not dare to enter the palace due to these considerations.

If he refused to enter the palace... Not everyone was able to appear in the space or stand in front of the golden palace gate and enter the gate to become a member of the Space-time Palace. Judging from the golden stone he possessed, it was a great opportunity for him to improve in understanding the Space-time Law.

He was tempted with such a great opportunity presented before him.

Jian Wushuang hesitated for a long time in front of the golden palace gates before finally raising his head.

“Let’s take a chance.”

There was a sparkle of anticipation in his eyes.

“Such a great opportunity is in front of me. I can’t waste it as I can’t be bothered too much about the position and nature of this Space-time Palace. Even if the Space-time Palace is in the same camp as the Three Great Sacred Realms—the enemy of the Seven Stars Black Sect—I’ll find a way to escape after growing stronger.”

Jian Wushuang finally decided after taking a deep breath before stepping out and entering the golden palace gates.
