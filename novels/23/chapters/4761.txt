4762 Killing Intent at the Banquet

Cheng Qing laughed secretly again. “This isn’t a groundless rumor. There have been rumors for a long time that Prince Mo likes men. He once captured all the young geniuses in the entire Commandery and sent them to his Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture. He said that he was nurturing them, but in fact, they were all taken care of by him so that he could enjoy them at any time.”

“For example, these handsome young men who came out may be the male pets he is taking care of.”

Although Jian Wushuang was still expressionless, he was actually disgusted.

Looking at the 20 or so handsome youths who had walked out, each of them had an imperceptible gentleness between their brows, which seemed to indirectly prove that what Cheng Qing had said was true.

“Whatever he likes has nothing to do with us. We’ll immediately withdraw after we find the Heaven-patterned Bone Armor and try not to have any disputes,” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

Chen Qing and Chun Qiu nodded and did not say anything more.

The three of them were now Celestial Prefecture guards on duty in the heavenly hall. In addition, they had disguised themselves to look extremely ordinary, so they were almost unnoticeable in a crowd.

Therefore, they stood by the two giant pillars on both sides of the hall, acting as guards.

Originally, Jian Wushuang had no intention of entering the giant hall. Instead, he was going to walk around the heavenly hall. However, his plan was disrupted by Goddess Yin Ling.

Standing on one side of the giant pillar, he cast his gaze to the center of the hall, where a group of handsome youths were currently performing the sword dance with all their heart.

The so-called sword dance was more of an aesthetic than a practical one. Although each of them had a steady sword momentum, they lacked decisiveness and fierceness, so it was obviously for the sake of viewing.

Although these handsome young men were all rare sword talents, Jian Wushuang obviously did not have any appreciation for them. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

If one wanted to cultivate the way of the sword, the most important thing was to have the innate Qi in one’s heart since childhood. It was the foundation.

In the end, all things were vast, and all kinds of Dao techniques emerged one after another. Although the Sword Dao was special, it did not escape the rules of the Great Dao. Naturally, the seedlings of the way of the sword would also be born with the flow of time.

All these naturally did not affect Jian Wushuang’s state of mind at all.

Hugging the soft Yin Ling, the drunk Prince Mo watched the sword dance performance with a smile. He seemed to be extremely satisfied.

“Extremely boring, it’s really too boring,” Yin Ling, who was sitting at the head of the table, said unhappily.

Upon hearing this, Prince Mo looked away. “What’s the matter, Yin Ling? Are you not satisfied?”

Yin Ling pursed her lips. “Of course not. Do you know how many times I’ve watched it? why don’t you change it to something new?”

“Alright, alright. We’ll do as you say,” Prince Mo said dotingly.

Yin Ling pouted as if she was thinking of something new, and then she glanced into the hall.

Oh no! Jian Wushuang exclaimed in his heart. Before he could even withdraw his body, he heard an excited voice.

“It’s you then. That stupid fellow from before, step forward.” Yin Ling stood up and pointed at him with her slender hand.

Jian Wushuang was speechless. He had no choice but to walk to the center of the hall.

The haziness in Prince Mo’s eyes faded away. He looked at the ordinary-looking young guard standing in the middle of the hall and felt that he had met him before.

However, he did not think too much about it. After all, at this time, the most important thing was to win Yin Ling’s favor.

After pointing at Jian Wushuang, Yin Ling looked around slowly and finally found a young guard who was also not too conspicuous.

“It’ll be the two of you. I can feel that both of you have extraordinary skills. Why don’t you practice martial art here?” The corner of Yin Ling’s mouth curled up into a smile. At the same time, she waved her sleeves, and two strips of cloth fluttered. She pulled out two True Swords and threw them at the two.

Jian Wushuang caught the True Sword and frowned. He did not like this feeling, especially the feeling of being ordered around.

If it were not for the urgent matter at hand, Jian Wushuang would have wanted to kill her.

He collected his emotions and looked at the young guard who had also been called out.

Jian Wushuang did not see any emotion in his eyes. It was as if he could not remember anything.

“Let’s begin. Please do your best. If it’s not exciting enough, there might be punishment.” Yin Ling covered her mouth and chuckled.

Cheng Qing, who was hiding next to the giant pillar, gritted his teeth and said, “Damn it! If I have no other choice, I will kill this woman first!”

“Count me in.” Chun Qiu’s eyes were cold. He seemed to be ready to attack when Jian Wushuang gave the signal.

At that moment, there was only Jian Wushuang and the young guard in the grand main hall.

He stood tall like a mountain, holding his sword. The aura around him was restrained, like a supreme Sword Intent that was hiding its edge and waiting to be activated.

In the face of any potential enemy, he would always go all out. This was a habit that Jian Wushuang had developed during his long cultivation journey.

Even in this sparring, he did not relax in the slightest.

The young guard, who was also standing with a sword in his hand, stood in the distance. His clear eyes, which should have belonged to a young man, suddenly showed an extremely old look.

Naturally, Jian Wushuang saw the change.

However, without waiting for him to think, the young guard was the first to burst out and slashed down with his sword.

Jian Wushuang raised his sword to deal with it. The two blades made contact and a crisp sound was heard.

It was only an instant of exchange, but a thick Sword Intent spread out in all directions!

Although it was only one exchange, they had already exchanged thousands of blows in an instant!

Jian Wushuang was secretly shocked. Since when could an ordinary Yan Immortal’s sword principle be evenly matched with his?

The young guard did not even have time to think. He raised his sword and slashed. There was an undetectable ruthlessness in his indifferent face.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold as he managed to force him back several steps with a stroke of his sword.

The young guard’s killing intent, which was hidden under his indifferent expression, was slowly emerging.

At this point, he began to be somewhat certain that the young guard in front of him was definitely not a guard of the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture!

In other words, this guy should be the same as Jian Wushuang and the other two, who had sneaked in under a fake identity.

An uncertain thought rose in Jian Wushuang’s mind.

The two True Swords collided once again. The aftershock of the explosion that was produced at the point of collision swept away all the clouds and smoke in the entire heavenly hall.

Jian Wushuang exerted all his strength on the True Sword in his hand and approached the young guard.

“No matter what your goal is, you’d better not have any ideas about me.”

The young guard was slightly stunned. He quickly looked at Jian Wushuang with a pair of cloudy eyes that were filled with doubt and scrutiny. Then, he suddenly retreated more than 100 feet away.
