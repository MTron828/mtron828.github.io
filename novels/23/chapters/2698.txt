Chapter 2699: Time For Our Talk

The surrounding void was silent!

The many experts including Shi Mo and Gu Mo from the Corpse Palace; the two Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods from the Star Fort; Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master had widened eyes with disbelief written all over their faces.

“Dead? Fo Wu died?”

“Fo Wu—the top ten Heaven Ultimate Gods in the Danyang Continent—was killed by Su Han?”

They were slightly stunned as huge waves of emotions surged through the bottoms of their hearts.

At the same time, they had deep doubts about the occurrence.

“What are those skills Su Han used just now?” They could see the scene moments ago.

They saw Jian Wushuang pointing from a distance and Fo Wu rendered unable to move. His immobility had allowed Jian Wushuang to directly kill him.

Such a scene had occurred twice with Fo Wu heavily wounded the first and directly killed in the second time.

However, they had no idea what skill Jian Wushuang had used.

They also had no idea how Jian Wushuang managed to stop an extremely strong Peak Heaven Ultimate God from moving in such a short amount of time.

However, they knew that the technique Jian Wushuang used was horrifying.

At that moment...

“Fo Wu is dead. All of you’ll be next.” Jian Wushuang’s cold and emotionless voice could be heard echoing between heaven and earth.

Corpse Palace experts’ faces including Shi Mo and Gu Mo immediately darkened.

How could they block his attack if even Fo Wu could not withstand Jian Wushuang’s techniques and was directly killed?

Boom~

The violent golden divine power sea once again surged as Jian Wushuang’s aura seemed as though it had reached the heavens. His eyes looked at the Corpse Palace experts with a strong intent to kill.

“Attack together.” Shi Mo shouted as a huge amount of Death Law strength crazily burst outward. He wanted to gather the four Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods’ powers and worked together with Gu Mo and the two Star Fort’s Peak Ultimate Heaven Gods to fight Jian Wushuang.

Gu Mo and the other two Star Fort’s Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods also wanted to work together.

However, Jian Wushuang pointed his finger again before the others could approach him.

A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique!!

It was the same technique but he used it on Shi Mo at that moment.

Fo Wu had died and the strongest person was none other than the Corpse Palace’s Shi Mo, hence Jian Wushuang naturally focused on him first.

Even Fo Wu could not withstand that ‘A Finger Pointing Heavenly’ technique. Although Shi Mo had a high understanding of the Death Law, his understanding was not on Space-time Law. The Space-time he was located immediately froze with him altogether and rendered Shi Mo immobile.

Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang’s body suddenly shook.

His figure appeared in front of the frozen Shi Mo as though he had teleported.

He then waved his Blood Mountain Sword.

The sword was beautiful in a sad way. It was so beautiful that it could break a person’s heart.

There was even a hint of perplexity which caused people to be intoxicated by it.

The surrounding experts in the voids were uncontrollably attracted by that sword-light and soon intoxicated by it as it swept away.

Although it was slightly uncomfortable, there was an endless aftertaste as though they had gotten drunk after having several drinks.

The Space-time Sword Technique’s seventh form—Enchanted!

Under the poignant and intoxicating sword technique, the frozen Shi Mo did not have any capabilities to fight back and was instantly beheaded. Two Space-time Blade was activated at the same time before smashing Shi Mo’s divine body into powder.

Shi Mo immediately died.

“Big brother!” Gu Mo stopped moving after shrieking loudly. He glanced at Jian Wushuang coldly but turned to escape the next moment. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

He was not the only one as even the two Star Fort’s Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods had also started escaping with a crazed attitude.

They knew clearly that if Shi Mo was still alive, they might have an opportunity to fight against Jian Wushuang if the four of them worked together.

However, only three were left after Shi Mo’s instantaneous death. There was no room for them to fight back anymore.

Therefore, they could only escape!

They did not have the time to even care for the Corpse Palace.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned cold when he saw the three of them escape. He then pointed his finger again.

Among the two Star Fort’s Peak Heaven Ultimate Gods, one of them was frozen on the spot without any warnings.

Jian Wushuang’s body slightly moved and easily killed that Peak Heaven Ultimate God.

However, Gu Mo and the other Peak Heaven Ultimate God had already escaped beyond the range of Jian Wushuang’s secret technique while he was killing the Peak Heaven Ultimate God. Jian Wushuang could no longer chase after them so he could only let the two of them escape.

Those two had managed to escape but their location was the Corpse Palace which meant that Gu Mo had completely given up his territory.

As for the Corpse Palace experts, they attack once Jian Wushuang gave the order.

Jian Wushuang had not given any orders. However, the Divine Sword Army Commander, Long Shan, could perceive huge changes in the Corpse City and knew there was a crazy battle between experts occurring, hence he directly attacked without waiting for Jian Wushuang’s orders.

Unfortunately, they still arrived late.

They saw many Corpse Palace experts surrendering to Jian Wushuang when they arrived.

That scene caused many Divine Sword Army’s soldiers to be flabbergasted as they wondered what had happened.

It looked like their alliance master had wiped out the Corpse Palace from their observation.

However, their alliance master was alone?

“Long Shan, I’ll hand these people in the Corpse Palace to you. In addition, send a message to ask Dong Xue and Hei Yan for personnel to take over the Corpse Palace’s territory,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Long Shan nodded solemnly.

Jian Wushuang turned his line of sight after speaking over toward Sheng Long and the Purple Dress House Master at the void beside them.

“It looks like it’s time for our talk.” Jian Wushuang smiled mysteriously.
