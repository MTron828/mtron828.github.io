Chapter 2942: Jian Wushuang’s Goal

——

Jian Wushuang first looked at the identity tokens.

There were many identity tokens. Jian Wushuang checked the list one by one and finally got the result.

“11,700 points?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

It had only been two days since the 10-day deadline for the mission, but the vicissitudes of life Elder had already obtained 11,700 points.

All of these points came from the Divine Masters of Black Dragon Mountain, but not the Immortal Saint.

Obviously, the vicissitude elder only intended to deal with the Divine Masters of Black Dragon Mountain, but not the Immortal Saint of Black Dragon Mountain.

Moreover, the reason why he could get so many points in just two days was not only because he had killed the experts of Black Dragon Mountain, but also because he had killed the other participants on the way.

Just now, if Jian Wushuang was not strong enough, he would have had no choice but to flee in embarrassment when facing this weathered Elder. Even whether he could escape or not was a different matter.

“There are no restrictions in this assessment mission. The participants can not only get points by killing experts of Black Dragon Mountain, but also kill people from the same camp. The speed of getting points will be faster.” Jian Wushuang understood this point.

He had killed three groups of experts from the Black Dragon Mountain in a row and did not let any of them go. He only got more than 5,000 points.

But now, he killed an Elder from the same camp and got 11,700 points in one go. It was easy to imagine how fast he got points.

“I’m only a Divine Master. The standard for passing the assessment is only 10,000 points. I’ve completed the assessment, and now…” Jian Wushuang’s expression became strange.

He had already met the criteria for passing the assessment, so there was no need for him to continue killing.

However, after killing the hunchbacked Elder, he saw great benefits.

Yes, benefits!

The Immortal Saint was not only powerful, but he was also worth a lot.

For example, after killing the hunchbacked Elder, Jian Wushuang had obtained countless resources, and there were no less than 600,000 saint elixirs!

He needed saint elixirs!

After all, his current realm was still that of an Advanced Great Divine Master. He had not reached Peak Divine Master yet, so there was still some room for improvement. To improve his realm, he needed saint elixirs.

“Normally, in the outer territories, many Immortal Saints either occupied their own territories or were under the command of a great force. They did not actively provoke me, so it would not be easy for me to deal with them. But now, it’s different here,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Black Dragon Mountain was in the middle of a massacre.

The two camps, or even the same camp, were engaged in a fierce battle.

In such an environment, Jian Wushuang did not care about the number of people and tried to plunder more resources.

“Forget about the Divine Masters in Black Dragon Mountain. If I kill them now, it’ll be too much of a bully. My target is the Immortal Saints in Black Dragon Mountain.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, his eyes shining.

“There are 11 Immortal Saints alive in Black Dragon Mountain, and two of them are top-notch False Saints. Each of them has a lot of resources. I can get a lot of benefits from killing one of them.”

“In 10 days, I’ll see how many I can find and kill.”

Jian Wushuang smiled wickedly, and soon he set off again.

…

The land where Black Dragon Mountain was located was not big. If an Immortal Saint traveled at full speed, he could cross the entire land in two or three days. Jian Wushuang was traveling alone in this land at an extremely fast speed, his soul power swept out unscrupulously.

Along the way, he also sensed many auras.

Unfortunately, what he sensed were only the Divine Masters of Black Dragon Mountain. Although there were many of them, Jian Wushuang did not plan to attack them. Instead, he passed by them. What Jian Wushuang was looking for… were the eleven Immortal Saints of Black Dragon Mountain.

The eleven Immortal Saints were absolutely confident in their strength. Because of the death of the ancestor of Black Dragon Mountain, they were also very angry. Therefore, among the eleven Immortal Saints, most of them were wandering around like Jian Wushuang and the others.

The Immortal Saints and 27 Divine Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance were trying to hunt down the experts of Black Dragon Mountain.

The Immortal Saints of Black Dragon Mountain were also hunting down the Divine Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

Jian Wushuang searched all the way until he met an Immortal Saint of the Black Dragon Mountain on the fourth day of the mission.

“The boy of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance was met by me, Jin Shan. You’re dead. I’ll kill you to avenge the deaths of the many cultivators of the Black Dragon Mountain!” The burly man of the Black Dragon Mountain looked at Jian Wushuang with bloodshot eyes, he stared at Jian Wushuang with a giant ax in his hand.

“If you want to kill me, just do it.” Jian Wushuang smiled slightly and waved at Jin Shan provocatively.

“Die!” In his fury, Jin Shan charged forward like a prehistoric beast.

His steps were extremely heavy as if each step weighed hundreds of millions of pounds.

After several steps, he appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. Then, he swung the huge ax in his hand.

In an instant, a mighty shadow of the ax appeared and covered the entire void.

Jian Wushuang chuckled and also struck out with his sword. As soon as the two came into contact, two terrifying forces burst out at the same time.

Jian Wushuang’s body shook and he took two steps back, while Jin Shan took several steps back.

“Your strength is not bad. You are much stronger than the hunchbacked old man that I killed before, but…” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed with a cold light. With a strange move, he appeared beside Jin Shan, and the Blood Mountain Sword carried a beam of demonic light, he silently attacked Jin Shan.

“So fast.” Jin Shan was shocked and quickly blocked it.

With a clang, Jian Wushuang appeared on the other side, and the same sword light attacked again.

“Too slow, your speed is too slow!” Jian Wushuang shouted.

“Ahhh, boy, go to hell!” Jin Shan was like an angry beast, crazily swinging his huge ax, trying to suppress Jian Wushuang.

However, Jian Wushuang did not confront him head-on.

“Your speed is too slow. You can’t touch me at all. Be my target!” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The endless sword light had completely enveloped Jin Shan.
