Jian Wushuang could study the spear techniques of illusionary spear king and the secret skill of Emperor Jin carefully.

What they left behind could only be considered ordinary in the True Martial Mystic Realm.

“There are so many principles left behind by the principles master… This is a great help to me in the rules of space-time. It’s definitely more helpful to me than the Time-space Beast God!” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, his heart full of surprise.

“You can come here to cultivate in the True Martial Mystic Realm later. I’ll take you to the next place first.” After saying that, Temple Master Bai Xing led Jian Wushuang to the Mystic Realm.

After leaving the Mystic Realm, Temple Master Bai Xing led Jian Wushuang to an exquisite black tower.

The tower was not very tall. It was pitch-black and exuded an extremely ancient aura.

The entire tower had three floors, and each floor was about the same size.

“This is the tower of time and space. It’s a special treasure refined by Temple Master Bai Xing,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“What’s so special about this tower?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“You’ll know once you enter.” Temple Master Bai Xing led Jian Wushuang to the first floor of the tower of time and space.

After entering the tower, Jian Wushuang saw nothing but a pitch-black void. There was nothing in front of him.

However, walking in the pitch-black void, Jian Wushuang slowly frowned.

“The space-time here seems to be a little different,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

He carefully sensed the power of the space-time around him, and his frown deepened.

He did sense that there was a difference between the space-time around him and the outside world, but he was not sure what the difference was.

“You only know that the space-time is different, but you don’t know what the difference is?” Temple Master Bai Xing glanced at Jian Wushuang, then smiled and said, “Let me remind you, the flow of time!”

“The flow of time?” Jian Wushuang was stunned at first, but then he was shocked. “The flow of time? The flow of time in this void is different from the outside world?”

Jian Wushuang immediately realized this.

He also sensed that the flow of time in this void seemed to be much slower than that in the outside world!

“How is this possible?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

“Nothing is impossible,” Temple Master Bai Xing said indifferently. “The space-time principles is the combination of time and space. Your comprehension of the space-time principles is still too low, and you have just started to touch the flow of time. Of course, you will find it incredible. But in fact, when a person’s strength has reached a certain level or his comprehension of the space-time principles has reached a certain level, his control of the power of time and space is no longer limited to what you know.

“For example, many people who have reached an extremely high level in the application of the rules of time and space can change the flow of time. For example, I can do it. However, even if I try my best, I can only slow down the flow of time in a small void by three times. This is my limit!”

“But this tower of time and space was personally refined by the Temple Master!”

“What is the flow of time here?” Jian Wushuang could not help asking.

“There are three levels in the time tower. You are now on the first level. The flow of time here is ten times slower than in the outside world. In other words, you have been cultivating here for ten years, but only one year has passed in the outside world,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“Ten times?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes widened. Then he immediately asked, “The flow of time on the first level is ten times slower. What about the second level and the third level?”

“On the second level, the flow of time is 100 times slower!”

“The most powerful one is the third level. The flow of time is 1,000 times slower!” Temple Master Bai Xing’s voice was solemn.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was a little confused.

It was one thing for the flow of time to be 10 times slower, but it could actually be 100 times slower? 1,000 times slower?

What an earth-shaking method was this?

Had the Time Temple Master, who had refined the space-time tower, reached such an incredible level in his comprehension and application of the power of time and space?

“Actually, it’s not too difficult for some rule masters who have comprehended the rules of time and space and are powerful machine guns to master the flow of time. What’s really difficult is time reversal,” Temple Master Bai Xing said. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Time reversal?” Jian Wushuang was stunned again.

“Yes, if you can master time reversal, you can reverse time and space and change things that have happened in the past. For example, some dead people can be resurrected by reversing time and space,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“Reverse time and space and resurrect!” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He was no stranger to reversing time and space.

In his previous life, his Master Xuan Yi reversed time and space and resurrected his soul. Then, he sent his soul into the reincarnation passage and sent it to the Divine Beginning Realm.

Since his master could do this, his strength was naturally earth-shaking.

“Temple Master, you can also reverse time and space?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course, but although you have this ability, you rarely use it. For example, since the beginning of the Divine Beginning World, the Temporal Temple has produced many talented experts and lost many of them. However, over the years, Temple Master has only used reverse time and space once and resurrected one person. That person was a personal disciple of Temple Master a long time ago. He was also his favorite disciple!”

“Unfortunately, the disciple of the Temple Master was very talented, but he was unlucky. After he was resurrected by the Temple Master, he went to the universe battlefield and died again!”

“After his second death, the Temple Master did not resurrect him,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

Jian Wushuang was secretly amazed.

Reverse time and space was an incredible method.

However, it seemed that it was not easy to use this method, or there were some restrictions, so Temple Master Bai Xing did not dare to use it recklessly.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, the space-time tower is not very helpful for you to comprehend the space-time principles. However, if you need a lot of time to cultivate or to study secret skills in the future, you can consider coming to the space-time tower. If you want to cultivate in the space-time tower, except for the time flow, everything else is the same. This will save you a lot of time.”

“Of course, if your comprehension of the space-time rules reaches an extremely high level in the future, you can also come to the space-time tower to control the flow of time,” Temple Master Bai Xing said.

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang nodded and then asked, “Temple Master Bai Xing, can I enter all three levels of the space-time tower?”
