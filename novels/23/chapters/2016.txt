2017 The Terrifying Jian Wushuang

Rumble. A lofty continent descended.

“Be careful!” The six Great Emperors looked solemn.

“I’ll take care of this,” the beast-like bald man took a stride forward. His body began to change the moment he walked forward. His originally human appearance turned into a beast in an instant.

The beast was tall and huge, and it had human palms. He was holding a black battle-axe.

He instantly wielded the battle-axe.

It flashed past the void like a bolt of lightning.

Vroom!

The descending lofty continent broke from that stroke. A large amount of divine power turned into an ocean of divine power as they flowed out to fill the universe.

Jian Wushuang saw and he couldn’t hold back his compliment, “Amazing!!”

After that, he waved and the world of mountains and rivers in the sky became a scroll painting that fell in his hand.

Then, Jian Wushuang rid along the boundless ocean of divine power and retreated.

“Let’s go!”

Jian Wushuang bellowed.

Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zhi Luo, Emperor Jiu Qian naturally didn’t hesitate but instantly went into the space tunnel while Jian Wushuang followed closely behind.

After the four of them entered the spacetime tunnel, it vanished into thin air.

In the void that was covered by the golden great formation, the ocean of divine power finally dispersed.

The six Great Emperors stood side by side. Their faces grew grave then.

“The six of us in peak Chaotic Realm, including Mister Ling Zong, took action personally. But in the end, we couldn’t catch the four of them?!”

“Forget that there were four of them, we couldn’t even catch one!”

“Most importantly, Sword Emperor… he is too scary!!” A Great Emperor couldn’t help but say.

“Scary?” The other Great Emperors became silent at that remark.

That’s true. He is really scary.

In terms of power, any one of them could match with Jian Wushuang. Some of them might even be stronger than him. The beast-like bald man, Ling Zong, could easily suppress him. However, he could only suppress him, not kill him.

Jian Wushuang’s defense power was too terrifying.

Under the besiegement of six Great Emperors alone, he lasted for eight breaths’ time. In the end, he wasn’t even hurt.

What was that?

That was merely the first scary part. The second scary part was Jian Wushuang’s calmness.

At such a critical moment, he could still set a route of retreat for himself but he looked as though he were prepared to face death unflinchingly.

“His defensive power was terrifyingly powerful, just like an unkillable monster. His mind and intelligence was like a monster’s too. Such a person…” The old lady in a red robe took a deep breath and continued, “Hurry up and report what happened here. On top of that, be frank about Sword Emperor so they know how terrifying Jian Wushuang is. Then, remove him from the picture as soon as possible. Otherwise, he will definitely become our greatest obstacle in the future.

The few other Great Emperors nodded simultaneously.

The beast-like bald man, Ling Zong, had a savage look in his eyes, “Sword Emperor, Jian Wushuang… I remember your name and it will be merely a matter of time until you die by my hand. I will definitely kill you by myself!!!”

…

Leng Ruxue, the savage man and the blood man sat in the boundless void.

“Six peak Chaotic Realm took action against the four Great Emperors from Sanctuary Alliance but they watched the four of them escape before their eyes. Humph. What’s up with this Ling Zong?” The savage man roared and there was anger in his eyes.

“We can’t blame them. We took action hastily and only arranged for six Great Emperors to team up for attack. On top of that, our information is inaccurate,” the blood man said.

“Inaccurate? Were the four people who entered Three-Emperors World different or were their recorded abilities different?” The savage man asked.

“The recorded abilities are inaccurate,” the blood man continued, “Of course, Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zhi Luo, Emperor Jiu Qiao are as recorded in the information. Only the Sword Emperor, Jian Wushuang, was much more impressive than we imagined him to be.”

The blood man immediately shared the report from Ling Zong and his team.

“Six Peak Chaotic Realm, including Ling Zong, besieged Jian Wushuang for eight breaths of time but didn’t hurt him at all. How is it possible?” When the savage man heard that, he was astonished.

“Although it is unbelievable, Long Zong and the others have no reason to lie to us. Hence, the truth is as such,” the blood man said.

“Sword Emperor’s defense power is this powerful?” The savage man muttered.

Just then… Leng Ruxue who was seated by the side suddenly spoke, “Maybe it isn’t because his divine body is strong but due to another reason. Jian Wushuang was an inverse cultivator after all. An inverse cultivator is unusual and entirely different from an ordinary cultivator. He had already broken through to the seventh step of inverse cultivation skill. It might be a new skill that he just mastered.”

“Inverse cultivator? What inverse cultivator? I have never heard about it,” the savage man said with disdain.

“Don’t belittle an inverse cultivator. Although the inverse cultivator first appeared in the first era and didn’t originate from ancient times, an inverse cultivator is scary. For example, the strongest one who is widely acknowledged in Eternal Chaotic World, Emperor Bai, is an inverse cultivator as well. As for his power, hehe, if I were to be rude, I’m afraid even Demon King would not be his match, Leng Ruxue chuckled maliciously.

“I’m not his match? Little girl, you must be kidding,” the savage man’s gaze grew cold and he glared at Leng Ruxue.

One should know that he was a top expert from ancient times. Although he wasn’t at the top of the pyramid in ancient times, he was considered one of the best. Although he was restrained in the second era and he couldn’t put his peak power to full play, he shouldn’t have been compared with Emperor Bai from the first era.

“I am not joking. I have proof,” Leng Ruxue scoffed, “Mister Demon King, you know that Lord Fen from Holocaust Sect has been in seclusion for many years. But did you know why he is in seclusion and has yet to come out from seclusion?”

“Why?” The savaged man looked. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Because, many years ago, Lord Fen fought with Emperor Bai and he was severely injured. When he returned, he had to recover in seclusion,” Leng Ruxue said.

“What? The old man was severely injured by Emperor Bai?” The savage man asked in shock. Then, he asked closely, “How about Emperor Bai?”
