Chapter 2455: Golden Prison

Those First-Class Divine Demon disciples stopped their attacks.

Although they wanted to stop, Jian Wushuang did not.

Boom!

Jian Wushuang’s energy surged into the sky as he charged directly toward a few First-Class Divine Demons and swung his Blood Mountain Sword.

They were startled and resisted with all their might but were immediately blasted backward.

“Jian Wushuang, we have stopped. What more do you want?” yelled one of the First-Class Divine Demons.

Jian Wushuang chuckled. “What more do I want? You fight whenever you want and stop as you wish. There is no such thing!”

Don’t all of you want to kill me? If so, let me have an old hearty fight. You either kill me or die under my sword one by one.”

Jian Wushuang stuck out his tongue and licked his lips while wearing a crazed expression on his face.

“Madman.”

The First-Class Divine Demons could not help but curse at him in their minds with their rage-filled hearts.

“Jian Wushuang, do you really want to fight until both of us suffer great losses?” Huan Chen shouted.

Jian Wushuang sarcastically said, “Both suffer great losses? I won’t die, but none of you should expect to live!”

All those First-Class Divine Demons were shocked with their rage burning even brighter.

It was true that they could not kill Jian Wushuang, but he could not do much to them either. However, Jian Wushuang said they should not expect to live?

Where did he get the confidence to say that?

However, right at that moment, a surging wave of divine powers was unleashed from Jian Wushuang’s body.

The giant golden Divine God hologram behind him was glowing with an even brighter golden light as well.

As Jian Wushuang waved his hand, a few palm silhouettes clapped at the void.

“Prison of Punishment!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes glowed and as soon as his voice died out, a huge amount of gold-colored divine powers extended out of the Divine God hologram.

The golden divine powers expanded far and wide, forming a large ocean of golden divine powers. It soon filled the entire place and covered the whole battlefield in it.

The golden divine power ocean very quickly concentrated and solidified, turning in a gigantic golden prison.

“This...”

The First-Class Divine Demons’ faces changed when they saw that gigantic golden prison which surrounded them.

“Domain tactic?”

“It’s not merely a domain, but a complete prison. It has completely imprisoned us.”

“Hmph, blast it open!”

Some First-Class Divine Demons immediately started taking action, hoping to break open the golden prison.

However, after a few rounds of attacks, nobody could shake the golden prison a bit, even when the attackers included Huan Chen, Long Zishan, Huo Yang, and more.

Jian Wushuang stood at the center of the golden prison, looking at those First-Class Divine Demons trying to break out of it without any intention of stopping them.

“Prison of Punishment. This is a complete and true-to-the-definition Prison of Punishment,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

Prison of Punishment was a tactic within the Divine God of Punishment secret technique.

In his Eternal Chaotic World’s past life, he had seen Emperor Bai using it.

However, the Divine God of Punishment that he learned was incomplete and so was the Prison of Punishment that he used. When Emperor Bai used it, it only formed the golden divine power ocean which acted as a domain and tied an opponent’s hand. The Prison of Punishment’s true function was to imprison the opponent.

Golden prison was the complete stage of Prison of Punishment. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Following Jian Wushuang’s upgraded cultivation level, in addition to increasing another half a stage with the help of Seven Stars Secret Skills, he could finally perform Prison of Punishment.

Once he did it, the humongous golden prison locked every First-Class Divine Demon inside.

As for Jian Wushuang who unleashed the Prison of Punishment, he had become the golden prison’s master!

Rumble~~~

With a tiny tweak of his mind, the overpowering golden divine power ocean unfolded and affected every First-Class Divine Demon in the prison.

Those First-Class Divine Demons felt a titanic mountain pressing on them.

“Damn, it really is a domain!”

“A very strong domain. Under this domain, my abilities are suppressed by at least 30%!”

“This Jian Wushuang could actually think of such a tactic?”

The many Divine Demons who were imprisoned in the golden prison were feeling uneasy.

However, they only knew that their own abilities were suppressed under the effect of the golden divine power.

What they did not know was the Prison of Punishment’s domain causes one’s suppression to become the other’s gain.

As the Prison of Punishment’s master, Jian Wushuang’s abilities were enhanced quite a bit as their abilities were being suppressed.

“The slaughter...begins.”

Jian Wushuang smiled cruelly as his figure... Whoosh!

In a flash, with the golden divine power filling the space, the many First-Class Divine Demons around could not clearly see Jian Wushuang’s figure. All they saw was the sudden flash of a sword-light.

“Careful!”

Screams of horror filled the air, but the warning clearly came too late.

As the sword-light dimmed, a total of four First-Class Divine Demons could not even react before being instantly killed.

Whoosh!

Another beam of sword-light appeared in another corner.

There were seven First-Class Divine Demons at that corner who immediately reacted when they saw the sword-light.

They acted right away, wanting to block the beam of sword-light.

Ring!

A gigantic sword-light appeared out of nowhere.

The sword-light was incredibly attractive and bright as though it could connect the sky and earth together.

The moment it appeared, it became the focal center of Heaven and Earth.

It even became an eternity.

Throughout nine oceans and eight wilderness, Heaven and Earth Aligned!

The seven First-Class Divine Demon’s faces still had the shocked look although their divine bodies had already been penetrated by the sword-light, forever losing signs of life.

Prior to unleashing Prison of Punishment, even if Jian Wushuang used ‘Heaven and Earth Aligned’ with all his power, as long as seven or eight First-Class Divine Demons joined forces, the attack could be resisted. However, within the Prison of Punishment where one’s suppression became the other’s gain, a huge gap appeared between Jian Wushuang’s abilities and theirs.

Now, when Jian Wushuang utilized that move, even seven First-Class Divine Demon joined hands could not resist it.

With just one stroke, another seven First-Class Divine Demon perished.

This scenario shocked all the surrounding First-Class Divine Demons.

“Quick! Think of something to break down this golden prison. If we stay here, we would only be chased and slaughtered by Jian Wushuang!”

“Quick, blast the prison.”

The First-Class Divine Demons attacked with everything they had.

However, they underestimated the golden prison’s sturdiness.

Precisely speaking, they had underestimated one of Seven Stars Black Sect’s strongest secret techniques.

Seven Stars Black Sect was the Ancient God Realm number one sect. For the Divine God of Punishment to be acknowledged as one of the strongest secret techniques of such a sect, it enjoyed great fame in the Ancient God Realm.

The Prison of Punishment move within it was also especially famous.
