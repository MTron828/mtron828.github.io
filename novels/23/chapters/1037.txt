Chapter 1038: I’ve Earned, I’ve Earned!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Of course, even though I was tough and muscular and I also had the protection of the Blood-killing Plate Armor, it’s still insufficient to withstand the attack of a real Celestial Master; if there were more attacks like that just now, I would have been unable to hold on,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

He shook his head and then looked toward the battle happening at his side.

The other battle was still raging on while Jian Wushuang and Jiu Xiu were locking horns. The two guards of the latter had seen their leader in danger and wanted to come to his rescue, but unfortunately, Army Saber and Rakshasa were keeping them occupied; there was no way they could free themselves up.

The shock on their faces was evident when they witnessed Jiu Xiu being suppressed by Jian Wushuang.

“Release Dao Master Nine Sword quickly, or the Ancient Monster Clan will hunt you to the ends of the earth and make sure there’s nothing left of your body,” roared the barbarian wielding the giant axe.

“Hehe, to the ends of the earth? Talk to me again when you can really do that,” giggled Jian Wushuang before tossing an Interspatial Ring in Army Saber’s direction.

“This is your balance payment, Army Saber. I hope you can keep them occupied for a while longer,” said Jian Wushuang.

The killer received the ring and gave it the once-over. “Both of us can delay them for another 15 minutes; the experts of the Ancient Monster Clan will arrive shortly after that time and both of us have to leave before that happens,” he replied, nodding.

“That’s enough,” said Jian Wushuang, smiling slightly. He then turned and dashed toward the vast space toward their back, not giving any further attention to the other people present.

“Bastard, don’t flee if you dare!” shouted the barbarian after Jian Wushuang.

“Fool, he’s already captured Dao Master Nine Sword. Do you mean that he should remain behind like an idiot for the experts from your clan to arrive?” replied Army Saber sarcastically.

“Accursed!” shouted the barbarian, his expression extremely unpleasant. He and the other Peak Rank Three Dao Master had very much wanted to shake Army Saber and Rakshasa loose and chase after Jian Wushuang, but they were evenly matched, and furthermore, both killers were especially skilled at holding their opponents up.

They could not hope to go anywhere as long as Army Saber and Rakshasa kept coming at them.

The two killers stuck to their promise and tangled with their opponents for exactly 15 minutes more. After the allotted time was up, their figures began retreating.

“Now that 15 minutes is up, Army Saber and I will not stop both of you from going where you want,” Rakshasa said as she laughed demurely.

“You two bastards!”

The two Dao Masters looked extremely grim, and even though they were free to move now, they had already lost the motivation to chase after Jian Wushuang.

After all, 15 minutes had already gone by.

It was a short period of time, but their strength enabled them to fight for many rounds during this period. It was also enough time for Jian Wushuang to have fled thousands of kilometers away, and without proper guidance, it would be pointless to chase after someone at such a far distance away; they would just be lost.

“The Ancient Monster Clan will remember what happened today, Army Saber and Rakshasa. If anything happens to Dao Master Nine Sword, the entire Blood Saber Organization will accompany him in death!” growled the barbarian.

“Humph, do you think that will scare us?” replied Army Saber, entirely disregarding the warning.

“Even though the Ancient Monster Clan is strong, our organization is no pushover either. If you guys really want to come after us, I can’t say what will happen to us, but your clansmen will only be able to remain indoors for the rest of your lives; we’ll assassinate anyone that steps outdoors,” added Rakshasa in a chilly tone.

It made the barbarian even angrier.

“Fine. We shall see!”

“Let’s go,” the barbarian said.

He then left with the other Dao Master.

They were already in no mood to exterminate the Bone Clan.

Army Saber and Rakshasa were standing side by side in the Void above the Bone Clan District.

“This time, the Ancient Monster Clan must be mad with rage,” said Army Saber coldly.

“Hehe, after all, something did happen to Dao Master Nine Sword, their precious darling. It would be weird if they didn’t go berserk,” giggled Rakshasa. “I’m more curious about our client than the reaction of the Ancient Monster Clan. Earlier on, when he told us to hold the two guards, I thought that he would assign another expert to handle Dao Master Nine Sword. Who would have thought that he would do it by himself?”

“Furthermore, he succeeded in suppressing Dao Master Nine Sword! When the Dao Master unleashed his trump card—the Celestial Master’s attack—he actually survived!”

“Only one person in the entire Samsara Continent, nay, the entire Green Fire World, could be an Eternal Realm expert and yet have such ability.”

“Jian Wushuang!” exclaimed Army Saber as he squinted slightly.

Both killers had guessed their client’s identity after watching him suppress Dao Master Nine Sword.

The answer was so obvious that not much guessing was really required.

Jian Wushuang was the only Eternal Realm expert in the Green Fire World that possessed so much skill and tactics that defied the natural order of things.

“I didn’t expect our client to be the Jian Wushuang who was so famous of late,” said Rakshasa as she laughed softly.

“He’s really daring. Previously, he killed the only son of Empyrean Patriarch, leading him to place a bounty of 20 Chaos Gems on his head. It resulted in everyone wanting a piece of him, but now, he wants to go against the even scarier Ancient Monster Clan, and even managed to offend them so greatly, tsk, tsk…” Army Saber added, secretly admiring Jian Wushuang.

“Oh yes, his whereabouts are worth 20 Chaos Gems. Should we…” started Rakshasa, but she was soon cut off by her partner.

“I’ve already reported the entire matter, and whatever those old fellas decide on has nothing to do with us. Our task is completed, and it’s best for us to leave,” said Army Saber.

“Right.”

Rakshasa nodded, and both of them immediately prepared to leave.

Only the experts of the Bone Clan remained, and every one of them was puzzled. They had not managed to figure out the entire chain of events up till now.

In the same isolated shop in the Emperor Heart City, the skinny elder that had served Jian Wushuang had now received the message transmitted back by Army Saber.

“Oh? So, that kid’s Jian Wushuang?” said the skinny elder. He was surprised at first, but soon, he began to understand. “Actually, I should have thought about it earlier. How could any ordinary Eternal Realm expert hand over 28 Chaos Gems just like that?”

“To think that Empyrean Patriarch was hell-bent on finding him. Who would have guessed that our Blood Saber Organization would be the first to know where he is,” he continued, a slight smile forming on his lips. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He then took out a token and informed Empyrean Patriarch about Jian Wushuang’s whereabouts.

“This mission, although offended the Ancient Monster Clan, but got 28 Chaos Gems, plus 20 more from Empyrean Patriarch, nearly fifty, haha, earned, I earned!”
