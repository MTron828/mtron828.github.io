“Ask for help with a Symbiotic Insect?”

Dan Jiu smiled coldly. Ignoring the purple-masked killers, he turned towards Jian Wushuang.

“Master Wushaung, Master Yang and Miss Su Rou, these killers of Blood Feather Tower will surely be stopped by my people. Now you three, come with me to find whom you want to save,” Dan Jiu said with a smile.

“Thank you so much,” Jian Wushuang said gratefully. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“You’re welcome. We are just following orders,” said Dan Jiu with a smile. Then, he made his way to the hinterland of the Nine Emperors Sect together with Jian Wushuang and the others.

Just as Jian Wushuang and the others were setting off, Ghost Tiger, leader of the six purple-masked killers, while being watched by the purple-robed persons on top of the void, immediately shouted,”So Jian Wushuang, you’ve come here to save your father?”

“Haha, but too bad you’re destined to be disappointed!”

“Your father, is indeed at the Nine Emperors Sect. Unfortunately, you won’t be able to save him!”

“You can’t save him. You’re doomed to return with nothing. Haha!”

Ghost Tiger’s laughter resounded through the entire Nine Emperors Sect and Jian Wushuang left with a heavy heart. But he did not give up and instead, began to search the Nine Emperors Sect.

The Superiors of the Yin Void Realm from the Nine Emperors Sect were heavily dealt with or killed. Even those from the Blood Feather Tower were now surrounded by the eight purple-robed persons and were no match for Jian Wushuang. No one in the Nine Emperors Sect could stop him.

“The Nine Emperors Sect is, after all, one of the most bountiful. It would take too much time to search the courtyard lofts one by one and maybe there are some secret chambers,”?Jian Wushuang thought with cold eyes.

“Mr. Dan Jiu, could I trouble you to catch one of these Nine Emperors Sect officials?” said Jian Wushuang.

“No trouble at all,” Dan Jiu replied with a smile as his gaze turned to the side. “Well, there’s one right there.”

The man who caught Dan Jiu’s eyes was Ma Qinghai, who just arrived at the battlefield, and was struggling against a Golden Dragon Messenger.

“Whoosh!”

Dan Jiu’was surrounded by a purple light and summoned in front of Ma Qinghai.

“What t-the?”

Even before he could react, Dan Jiu slapped a shocked Ma Qinghai

An overwhelming power fell over Ma Qinghai’s body, and he was swatted onto the ground like a housefly. The ground had torn apart, leaving a large hole.

Ma Qinghai struggled to get up from the hole, especially wit a foot on his chest.

With a determined look in Jian Wushuang’s eyes, he coldly stared at Ma Qinghai.

“Tell me, where is my father?” Jian Wushuang said in a low, serious tone.

“Your father?” replied Ma Qinghai, slightly stunned.

“My father is Jian Nantian,” Jian Wushuang said. “He is locked up in the Nine Emperors Sect. You are a high ranking official of the Yin Void Realm at Nine Emperors Sect, one of the top few. You must know where he is. Tell me the truth. Then maybe, I can still keep you alive, or else...”

As Ma Qinghai detected the seriousness in Jian Wushuang, he cleared his throat while nodding his head and said, “I know where your father is, and I will take you there. I will take you there now.”

“Lead the way.”

Jian Wushuang lifted his foot, allowing Ma Qinghai to stand up. Then Ma Qinghai led the way ahead.

Though Ma Qinghai was powerful among those of the Yin Void and could walk on air, Jian Wushuang was not worried that Ma Qinghai would escape as Dan Jiu kept a close eye on him.

Guided by Ma Qinghai, it didn’t take long for Jian Wushuang and the others to arrive at the courtyard near the hill.

There in the courtyard was Ma Changfeng. Beside him was Jian Nantian, whose face was faint and hair was white, drinking quietly.

Jian Wushuang appeared in the courtyard with his eyes sweeping the area. At once, he saw the white-haired man seated in the middle, on a stone bench and drinking.

Jian Wushuang was in shock.

They hadn’t met each other in years...

His hair was already silver...

His face was fainter than before...

However, Jian Wushuang could still recognize that the white-haired man was Jian Nantian, his dignified father who brought him up. The one who taught him swordsmanship and how to be a real man.

“Father,” Jian Wushuang said, with trembling voice.

Jian Nantian, the white-haired man drinking alone, looked towards Jian Wushuang. A light of recognition flashed across his eyes, but soon calmed down like a pool of stagnant water.

“You are here,” Jian Nantian said calmly, “Come here to sit.”

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and sat down on a stone bench in front of Jian Nantian. Taking a closer look at Jian Nantian, he was startled.

“Father, your breath...” Jian Wushuang noticed that Jian Nantian had no spiritual power. Jian Nantian looked like any ordinary person. Only those whose Dantian had been destroyed and had their spiritual power taken away appear like this.

“Haha, it’s nothing serious. My Dantian was just broken,” Jian Nantian smiled with ease. He was very philosophical about this.

“B*stard!” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but curse.

For a warrior, it is a nightmare for the Dantian to be destroyed and have their spiritual power dissipated!

His father’s Dantian was somehow destroyed?

“Calm down. Though my Dantian was destroyed and the spiritual power lost, there are other ways of survival,” Jian Nantian still smiled. He then took out a pot of wine and said, “Have a drink with me.”

Jian Nantian handed the wine pot to Jian Wushuang.

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang took a swig of the wine.

“Not bad. Despite not having seen you for seven years, you’re all grown up.” Drinking another mouthful, Jian Nantian continued, “I heard you are ranked first on the Earthly Dragon List now?”

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Is your Sword Soul completely awakened?” Jian Nantian asked.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded again.

“The Ancestor’s Land, have you been there?” Jian Nantian asked calmly.

“I spent two years in the Sword Tomb of the Ancestor’s Land. Unfortunately, I’m not strong enough to accept the test there,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“It’s normal. Generally, those who have reached the Yin Void Realm are qualified to accept the tests in the Ancestor’s Land. I could accept the test with just Fulfillment of the Golden Pill Realm because I was far stronger than the others at the same level,” Jian Nantian said.

Jian Wushuang understood what he meant.

“By the way, father, I got to see younger aunt,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Wuyue?” Jian Nantian looked over, “I saw her three years ago. How is she?”

“She is dead,” Jian Wushuang answered.

The glistening pupils of Jian Nantian’s calm eyes riffled, but in the next moment he sneered and said, “Wuyue is also gone...”

“Shuang’er, do you know you bear a bloody feud?” Jian Nantian suddenly asked.

“I do” Jian Wushuang answered coldly.

“If you know, you have to remember...” looking at Jian Wushuang seriously, Jian Nantian said a few words icily.

“Blood debt, must be repaid with blood!”
