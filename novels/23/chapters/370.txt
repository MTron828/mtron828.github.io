Chapter 371: Icy Heart Poison

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“I once tried to cure you with Icy Heart Force when you were chased by Tan Feng and mortally wounded. However, as soon as the Icy Heart Force entered your body, it was devoured by a more powerful force,” Leng Rushuang looked at Jian Wushuang and said.

Jian Wushuang stared at her.

Surely it was because of Heavenly Creation Skill.

“At that point, I realized that your Cultivation Method was extraordinary.” Leng Rushuang said coldly, “Since it can devour Icy Heart Force, I suspect that it may also work on the Icy Heart Poison that is formed by the Icy Heart Force.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“You mean, you want me to drive the Icy Heart Poison out of your body?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Yes.” Leng Rushuang nodded, “The idea occurred to me when I realized you have an extraordinary Cultivation Method, but you were not strong enough at the time. Now that you have reached the Saint Realm, I think you can do it.”

“What should I do?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Instead of answering him, Leng Rushuang extended her hand and rolled up her sleeve, showing him her white arm. There was a piece of milky-white skin near her shoulder.

The ghostly skin was a hideous white, just like a bone.

Leng Rushuang raised her head and looked at Jian Wushuang, “You just need to use your Cultivation Method and force it out my arm.”

“That’s it?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Of course not,” Leng Rushuang said, “Icy Heart Poison is the strongest poison known to man. An ordinary person will die if they even touch it, but you need to absorb it into your own body and then refine it, which means my Icy Heart Poison will be transferred to you.”

“Your Cultivation Method is strange. It easily devoured my Icy Heart Force, so it should be able to refine the Icy Heart Poison as well. However, this is just a guess, so I’m not sure. Once you begin, if you can’t refine the Icy Heart Poison, you will die.”

Jian Wushuang was astounded.

He had just asked if it was simple, but now he realized it wasn’t simple at all. He was walking the path to Hell.

If he was even slightly careless, or if he couldn’t refine the Icy Heart Poison, the only thing awaiting him was death.

“With that said, you should take this time and carefully think about whether you’re willing to try. If you don’t want to help me, I will not force you,” Leng Rushuang said.

“I don’t need to think about it, I’ll do it.” Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate.

“Are you sure?” Leng Rushuang looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise. It was dangerous and no one knew what would happen. Anyone else would have taken time to think about it, but he didn’t even frown.

“I’m sure,” Jian Wushuang said with a laugh.

He was confident because of his Cultivation Method.

The Heavenly Creation Skill had never disappointed him.

Moreover, he owes Leng Rushuang a favor.

“Let’s start.” Jian Wushuang urged.

Leng Rushuang took a deep look at Jian Wushuang and nodded.

Jian Wushuang immediately began to circulate the Heavenly Creation Skill. Spiritual Power gathered in his palm and then spread out to cover the ghostly white skin on Leng Rushuang’s arm.

The instant his Spiritual Power came into contact with her skin, Jian Wushuang felt a white energy wiggling around like billions of worms. This white energy was the Icy Heart Poison.

“What a frightening poison!”

Seeing the white energy, Jian Wushuang couldn’t help feeling terrified.

He had some minor experience with poison in the past, but compared with the Icy Heart Poison, they were insignificant.

The terrifying, ice-cold white energy in Leng Rushuang’s arm was slowly spreading.

Jian Wushuang believed that even a little bit of this white energy could easily freeze a Saint Realm expert and turn them into powder.

It was just a tiny portion of the Icy Heart Poison. Most of it had been sealed by Leng Rushuang.

“Be careful,” reminded Leng Rushuang.

It made Jian Wushuang feel strange.

He thought of Leng Rushuang as someone who was always cold as ice. But today, perhaps because he was willing to help her, Leng Rushuang was treating him much better.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath, then concentrated on the white energy. He began circulating his Spiritual Power according to the Heavenly Creation Skill, while slowly moving towards the white energy. As soon as they made contact with each other, it was like his Spiritual Power took a bite of the white energy and swallowed it.

It was only a small portion, about the size of a fingernail. However, when it entered Jian Wushuang’s body, he immediately felt as if his body was frozen. For a moment, even his breathing and his heartbeat stopped.

“Refine!”

“Hurry, refine it!”

Jian Wushuang quickly circulated the Heavenly Creation Skill and a surge of Spiritual Power rushed towards the Icy Heart Poison.

Fortunately, the Heavenly Creation Skill did not let him down. The Icy Heart Poison was tyrannical, but the Heavenly Creation Skill was even more domineering.

Although the Icy Heart Poison in his body fought back violently, it was quickly suppressed before eventually being refined.

“Did it work?” Leng Rushuang stared at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and winked at Leng Rushuang as a smile spreading across his face.

A moment later, Jian Wushuang carefully extended his hand. There was a drop of ghostly white liquid floating in his palm.

This was the refined Icy Heart Poison.

Jian Wushuang flipped over his other hand and took out a jade bottle, then dropped white liquid into the bottle.

However, as soon as it entered the bottle... Bang! The jade bottle exploded.

His mouth spasmed

That jade bottle was made of Spiritual Jade. Not only was it valuable, it was also the highest quality bottle he owned.

However, it could not endure the terrifying coldness that radiated from the poison.

“Use this one.”

Leng Rushuang flipped her hand over and took out a transparent jade bottle, then handed it to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and accepted it. This time, when he dropped the white liquid into the jade bottle, nothing happened.

Seeing that, a twinkle flashed in his eyes.

“A good bottle.”

Jian Wushuang broke into a smile.
