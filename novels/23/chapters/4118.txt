4119 Divine Power Test

“Is this magic formation used to test the strength of divine power?”Jian Wushuang looked at the magic formation and asked, “Senior Blood Wave, what should I do?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“It’s very simple. After you enter the magic formation, don’t use any secret skills. Just rely on your own divine power and fight with the puppet fighters in the magic formation. The magic formation can naturally determine the strength of your divine power,” Ruler Blood Wave said.

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang nodded and stepped into the formation without hesitation.

Inside the formation, Jian Wushuang did not use any secret skills or even the principles of the universe. He quickly fought with the puppet fighters with his own brute strength.

It was a fight, but in fact, it was just a simple collision with the puppet fighters. After only a few collisions, the puppet fighters stopped.

Jian Wushuang also walked out of the formation.

“Is it over?” Jian Wushuang looked a little strange.

“It’s done. As for the result, look here.” Ruler Blood Wave pointed at a transparent crystal standing next to the formation.

Although the transparent crystal was next to the formation, Jian Wushuang could clearly sense that it was the core of the formation.

“There are scales on this crystal. In a while, you will see the scales and colors on this crystal. A golden scale represents 1,000 times divine power, a silver scale represents 100 times divine power, and the lowest white scale represents 10 times divine power. You are a third-level Ruler, and the strength of your divine power will be many times stronger than an ordinary third-level Ruler. It will soon appear on the scale of this crystal,” said Ruler Blood Wave.

Jian Wushuang watched with anticipation.

“Don’t be so nervous. Since you’ve awakened your innate ability, you must have developed more than 70% of your innate advantage. In other words, your basic divine power is at least 7,000 times that of an ordinary cultivator. If I’m not mistaken, there will be at least seven golden scales on the transparent crystal later,” Ruler Blood Wave said with a smile.

“I know, but I have a feeling that my basic divine power is more than 7,000 times that of an ordinary cultivator,” Jian Wushuang said seriously.

“More than 7,000 times?” Ruler Blood Wave’s expression changed, and then he smiled and said, “Can it be 8,000 times?”

“Maybe more,” Jian Wushuang said again.

“Oh?” Ruler Blood Wave looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise, but he found that Jian Wushuang’s eyes were burning with excitement.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang was indeed very excited.

The Life Baptism in the Life Nirvana Pool had greatly transformed his body, and the strength of his divine power was much stronger than before.

Now, he only felt that his entire body was filled with power. Jian Wushuang did not know how strong this power was.

But he felt that his current basic divine power should be more than 7,000 times that of an ordinary cultivator.

It was even more than that…

“It’s coming,” Blood Wave suddenly said.

Jian Wushuang immediately went too far.

Sure enough, a light began to shine on the transparent crystal.

And the first light that lit up was the golden light that represented 1,000 times divine power.

The dazzling golden light filled the entire transparent crystal and instantly occupied the first few scales of the transparent crystal.

In just an instant, the five scales were filled with a rich golden light.

This meant that Jian Wushuang’s basic divine power was already 5,000 times that of an ordinary cultivator.

But this was obviously just the beginning. The golden light continued to spread, and then it occupied the sixth and seventh scales, and then it completely occupied the Eighth.

“It’s 8,000 times.” Ruler Blood Wave’s eyes focused. “But the golden light continues to extend. Well, it’s 9,000 times, and it hasn’t stopped!”

“Could it be…” Ruler Blood Wave suddenly thought of something, and a look of shock appeared on his face.

As expected, after the golden light filled up the ninth tick on the translucent crystal, it immediately filled up the tenth tick. A short moment later, it filled up the tenth tick as well.

The first ten tick on the translucent crystal were completely filled up by the dazzling golden light.

“10,000 times!”

“10,000 times what? To fully develop the innate advantage?”

Ruler Blood Wave was shocked.

He had told Jian Wushuang before that it was too difficult for special creatures to perfectly develop their innate advantage.

Since the creation of the Life Palace, there had only been less than 10 people, and most of them had lower life levels, so it was easier to develop them.

As for the perfect life level, it had never been fully exploited since the creation of the Life Palace.

Because of this, Ruler Blood Wave had told Jian Wushuang not to expect him to exploit his innate advantage perfectly, but in the end…

The scene before him was a slap to Ruler Blood Wave’s face.

It was equivalent to a divine power foundation 10,000 times that of an ordinary cultivator. Was this not something that could only be achieved by a perfect life form that had developed its innate superiority to the extreme?

“No, that’s not right!”

Ruler Blood Wave’s body shook violently, and his eyes were fixed on the transparent crystal in front of him.

When he saw that the first ten scales of the transparent crystal were filled with golden light and that the golden light continued to spread toward the eleventh scale, even with Ruler Blood Wave’s knowledge, he could not help but widen his eyes at this moment, an extremely exaggerated expression appeared on his face.

“Impossible!”

Ruler Blood Wave stared at the transparent crystal in front of him. He could already see that the eleventh scale on the transparent crystal had also been filled with dazzling golden light.

However, this was not the end. The golden light continued to spread out, and in the blink of an eye, the twelfth and thirteenth scale had been filled.

After the thirteenth scale was completely filled up, the rich golden light began to slowly calm down. But even though the golden light had calmed down, a rich silver light immediately rose up.

The silver light represented a hundred times divine power.

The silver light rose crazily, and in the blink of an eye, it filled up five scale points in succession, and then immediately dimmed.

At this point, the crystal finally calmed down and no other light appeared.

Ruler Blood Wave and Jian Wushuang stared at the scales filled with light on the crystal.

13 scales filled with golden light.

Five scales filled with silver light.

The golden light represented 1,000 times divine power, and 13 represented 13,000 times.

Together with the five silver scales representing 100 times divine power, Jian Wushuang’s basic divine power was 13,500 times that of an ordinary cultivator!

It was an exaggerated number that even exceeded Ruler Blood Wave’s imagination.

Judging from Ruler Blood Wave’s expression, he was obviously stunned.
