Chapter 2504: An Important Guest

The second form of the Primordial Void Celestial Body which merely increased Jian Wushuang’s divine powers by threefolds did not help much in increasing his attack powers. It was because he had to convert the divine powers into the attack powers before manifesting it. Such power conversion reduced the power’s efficacy and finally resulted in only about 30 to 40 percent of an increase in Jian Wushuang’s overall strength.

As for Nine Sparkle Stars Armor, the star guided attack mechanism directly intensified the attack power which Jian Wushuang manifested. His overall strength was doubled up, hence the two techniques were incomparable.

“The Black Armor alone has doubled up my overall strength. I can try to cultivate the Gold Armor with my current realm level.” Jian Wushuang was electrified.

He began to sit cross-legged and continued meditating upon the Gold Armor chapter.

Time flew and half a month passed in a flash.

Jian Wushuang was still sitting in the chamber when suddenly a layer of bright golden light appeared on the surface of his divine body. The golden light was like a gold armor covering his entire body. Jian Wushuang had his eyes closed while his Blood Mountain Sword quivered in his hand.

Hum! A bloody sword shadow intent swept across the entire area and instantly filled the chamber with an ocean of sword intent. A shrill sound resonated across the chamber.

“It’s done!”

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes. He could not contain his excitement which was shone through his shining bright eyes.

“The Gold Armor chapter has been cultivated. My attack power has increased by three times from the Gold Armor’s guidance which means that my overall strength has also increased by threefold,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

Tripling his overall strength was undoubtedly a huge improvement.

Before Jian Wushuang cultivated the Nine Sparkle Star’s Armor Secret Technique, his combat prowess had already surpassed the early stages of Divine Demon. His combat prowess was close to a High-Level Ultimate God, but still not enough for him to engage in a duel with Yun Zhen.

With his overall strength increased by three times, Jian Wushuang would be able to fight against Yun Zhen. Although it was still uncertain if he could defeat Yun Zhen, he knew he was sufficiently strong to be a threat toward Yun Zhen. On the other hand, there was absolutely no hope for Yun Zhen to defeat Jian Wushuang.

The only reason why Jian Wushuang was not absolutely certain over winning Yun Zhen was that Yun Zhen might hold a trump card. If nothing was hidden, Jian Wushuang was confident he could defeat Yun Zhen in a duel based on Yun Zhen’s combat prowess at the time they besieged and killed Strange Old Feng.

“It’s a pity I’m only in the Divine Demon realm. The highest level I can cultivate the Nine Sparkle Stars Armor is at the Gold Armor chapter. If I can proceed to the third level which is the Previous Armor chapter, not will it improve my overall strength but upon full achievement, I’ll be able to manifest the special techniques in Nine Sparkle Stars Armor,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

Some powerful secret techniques were accompanied by special action techniques.

For instance, the Divine God of Punishment had two special action techniques—Prison of Punishment and Extermination of Criminals. Both were killer moves.

The Nine Sparkle Stars Armor also had special techniques but its threshold was higher. Only after cultivating the Treasure Armor chapter could one its first special technique—the Star Armor Domain!

The Star Armor Domain was initiated by the Star Armor itself. Not only was the domain power extremely terrifying, but also had no conflicts against any other domain methods.

Jian Wushuang imagined the day when he crossed over to the Ultimate God realm, achieved a breakthrough in his swordsmanship, and gained control over a Sword World. He will first subdue his opponent with the Sword World before applying both Prison of Punishment and Star Armor Domain on his opponent.

That action would be equivalent to three great domain techniques superimposed on his opponent. ‘How strong would its effect be?’

Unfortunately, he was still very far from his aspirations.

“Anyway, my life-saving ability has improved greatly with the Nine Sparkle Star Armor Secret Technique. My overall strength has also increased by threefolds. It’s a great overall achievement. At least my efforts to source for instrument cultivation materials to make the Life Armor didn’t go to waste.” Jian Wushuang smiled feeling pleased.

He was happy to have cultivated the Gold Armor chapter.

His happiness did not last long...

“Shuang’er.” His father in his current life, Zhuo Yunfeng sent him a message.

“Father, what’s the matter?” Jian Wushuang answered while trying to suppress his joy.

“Shuang’er, please come back quickly if you are free now. We have a special guest at home,” said Zhuo Yunfeng.

“Special guest?” Jian Wushuang was startled.

Jian Wushuang had proven his extraordinary strength to which elevated his status. He was no longer inferior to many people and even the lords of many sects.

Zhuo Yunfeng was fully aware of that.

Under such circumstances, who could possibly be considered as a special guest to him?

“Father, who’s the guest?” Jian Wushuang asked curiously.

“It’s Daoist Xuan Shen!” Zhuo Yunfeng answered solemnly. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Jian Wushuang’s eyes widened!

‘Daoist Xuan Shen... The one who arrived at Blazing Moon City after I was born and gave me the name Jian Wushuang upon careful calculation of my birth date?’

For Jian Wushuang, Daoist Xuan Shen was the only person in Wusha Wilderness which Jian Wushuang was curious and envious of.

However, Jian Wushuang did not see Daoist Xuan Shen as his enemy.

“Daoist Xuan Shen showed up once when I was born and gave me my name before disappearing. I have never heard from him all these years and he miraculously appears again at this point in time.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

“Father, do you know why Daoist Xuan Shen visited?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I don’t know, but he’s here for you. After arriving at our mansion, he bluntly said he wanted to see you and told me to send you a message,” replied Zhuo Yunfeng.

“I got it, Father. Please ask Daoist Xuan Shen to stay for a while. I’ll be back soon,” said Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang dared not neglect the mysterious and unpredictable Daoist Xuan Shen. He thought the Daoist might even know everything.

After Jian Wushuang got the news, he rushed home as quickly as possible.

Not long after, Jian Wushuang had returned to the Governor’s Mansion in the Blazing Moon City.

In a large greeting hall, Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin were seated there with a few servants standing right behind them. As for Zhuo Bing and Zhuo Peng, they had returned to their respective sects long ago.

Beside the hall was a barefooted old man in a plain green robe with white hair and a beard. His eyes were squinted while sitting there waiting.

On a chair beside the barefooted old man was a piece of canvas with the characters—’Psychic’ and ‘Fortune Telling’.

“Is he Daoist Xuan Shen?”

Jian Wushuang walked into the hall, saw the barefooted old man at first glance, and was rather amazed.

Looking at the barefooted old man, Jian Wushuang was fascinated as he was unable to read that old man at all.

Just as Jian Wushuang had thought, the barefooted old man was unpredictable like an infinite ocean!

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and headed towards the old man.
