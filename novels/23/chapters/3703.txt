Chapter 3704: Swordsmanship System

Di Shisan attacked again, but this time, hua! Hua! Hua! Hua! Hua!

One after another, dazzling sword lights whistled out.

Each sword light was so dazzling and eye-catching.

Each sword light was so tyrannical.

However, there were dozens of such sword lights from Di Shisan’s hands.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

The spectators were shocked when they saw the sword essence from Di Shisan’s hands.

“How could this be?”

“Those sword skills are so powerful. I feel that every sword move is an absolute art at the Ruler Realm!”

“He has used so many absolute arts at once?”

Everyone was shocked.

An absolute art at the level of a Ruler was extremely powerful.

It was not easy to use an absolute art at this level.

Even though Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of sword principle was very high, and he had even created an advanced level seven absolute art, he still had to use an elementary level seven absolute art one sword at a time, unlike Di Shisan, he used dozens of sword lights in one breath, each of which was comparable to an absolute art at the Ruler Realm.

“It’s because of this sword principle domain.”

Jian Wushuang’s face darkened, but he was not afraid at all when he saw the sword lights coming at him.

He moved his body to meet them and waved the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

A series of clashing sounds rang out as Jian Wushuang blocked the dozens of sword lights.

However, they were all absolute arts at the Ruler level. It was very difficult for Jian Wushuang to block them. After dozens of collisions, he was forced to retreat a great distance.

Seeing this, Di Shisan’s eyes were still cold. Then, he waved his hand again.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

One after another, dazzling sword light swept out like a storm. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The onlookers were completely stunned by this scene.

They did not expect that Di Shisan could use a sword skill at the Ruler Realm so easily. It was as if he could do it with ease.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes darkened, and then a shocking sword essence burst out.

This sword essence was filled with hatred that would not rest until death.

“An absolute art at the level of a Ruler!”

It was also an offensive sword art, but it was much more powerful than the one created by Jian Wushuang.

If the move was the most common level seven absolute art, then the move would not rest until death was the best level among the level seven absolute arts.

Boom!

With a violent boom, a huge hole was blasted open in the void.

In the hole, a terrifying power swept out with a hatred that would not rest until death. It swept in all directions and instantly crushed all the brilliant sword lights unleashed by Di Shisan.

Jian Wushuang also took a step forward and appeared in front of Di Shisan.

Whoosh!

The violent power and endless flames rose in an instant.

It was an advanced level seven skill, star fire burning the sun!

Boom!

It was like a volcano that had been silent for hundreds of millions of years suddenly exploded. This sword attack contained extremely terrifying power and completely exploded in front of Di Shisan.

Seeing this, Di Shisan’s expression was still very calm.

The moment the sword light slashed over, the longsword in his hand was stretched out straight.

“Hidden sword!”

The two words were light, but there was a unique sword essence sweeping up.

At this moment, the void where Di Shisan was seemed to have begun to undergo a huge change.

It was clearly a vast void, but it suddenly formed a storm eye. A terrifying vortex-like eye with a diameter of more than 1,000 meters appeared.

The terrifying thing was that the eye of the storm was completely formed by sword essence.

Jian Wushuang’s sword skill, which contained explosive power, displayed its full power in the eye of the storm. However, it was completely destroyed by the power contained in the eye of the storm in a moment, there was nothing left.

Buzz!

With the change of sword essence, the huge vortex-like eye of the storm suddenly disappeared. Di Shisan appeared in front of Jian Wushuang again with a calm expression. Even though he took Jian Wushuang’s terrifying sword attack head-on, there was no change at all.

Obviously, Jian Wushuang’s sword attack had been easily blocked by Di Shisan. Not only did he not suffer any damage, but he did not even take a step back.

How could Di Shisan not move after receiving Jian Wushuang’s most powerful sword attack 30 years ago?

“What a terrifying sword art. It actually weakened the power of the Starfire Burning Sun in an instant. Di Shisan, you actually created such an amazing defensive sword art.” Jian Wushuang stared at Di Shisan in shock.

“Jian Wushuang, your sword art is indeed very powerful. At least in terms of attack and killing, the explosive power of your sword art is far greater than my most powerful sword attack. However, sword principle is not just about attack and killing power,” Di Shisan said calmly.

“Do you know the difference between you and me?

“In terms of swordsmanship, I have created a complete swordsmanship system. With the sword world as the core, my swordsmanship evolved into the Emperor Sword, which can continuously attack, and the hidden sword, which can defend against all kinds of attacks. In addition, there are all kinds of swordsmanship that can be used to tie down enemies and instantly kill them!

“This is a complete swordsmanship system. It can be used to attack, defend, advance, and retreat. It also complements each other. In fact, in this sword world, the consumption of my swordsmanship is very low!

“However, your swordsmanship is different. Although your swordsmanship includes all aspects, all of these aspects are used to attack and kill. In other words, your swordsmanship only pursues attacking and killing, but in terms of defense, advance, and retreat, you are far inferior to me!

“Today’s battle, you are in my sword world. Even if you use all your swordsmanship, you can’t break my hidden sword. But against my swordsmanship, you don’t have any means of defense. Therefore, you will definitely lose this battle.”

Di Shisan’s expression was still extremely cold, but his words were full of absolute confidence.

He was indeed full of confidence in his swordsmanship system. It was because of this that he was so confident that he could defeat Jian Wushuang in sword principle.

It turned out that his confidence was not groundless. In the short exchange just now, Jian Wushuang had already used an advanced level seven secret skill. It should be the strongest move that Jian Wushuang had created, however, he still could not break his hidden sword.

As long as he could not break his hidden sword, Di Shisan would be invincible in the sword world.
