Chapter 1748: Enemies On A Narrow Road

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Jian Wushuang had just stopped moving and he immediately groaned, “Ugh!” Then, he spat a mouthful of blood.

He had forcefully performed the second seal of Nine-province seal, hack the earth, earlier and it was overloading his body so his divine body was damaged. Then, the ancient flood dragon attacked him with chilliness to the point where his organs turned bad and his divine body was?heavily injured.

Then, he was thrown out by One-star Man. Although he did that to save him and let him leave the battlefield, the power he had used was terrifying. During the process, his injury went from bad to worse.

By then, he was in a miserable situation.

Jian Wushuang resisted the sharp pain from his body as he looked around.

After he looked around, his eyes dilated in shock.

“This is… Outside of Buddhist Demon Sea?” Jian Wushuang found it unbelievable.

One should know that the triangle island that had sunk and disappeared which he was on, although it wasn’t the inland sea of Buddhist Demon Sea, was quite deep in the open sea. With Jian Wushuang’s travel speed, from the triangle island to the outside of Buddhist Demon Sea, he would at least require one to two years’ time.

But then, it was just one throw!

The power of one throw threw him out of the battlefield and out of Buddhist Demons Sea directly!

What kind of power was that?

Which level of technique did he perform?

“One-star Man.”

Jian Wushuang remembered the name clearly.

He knew that the reason why he could escape by the skin of his teeth was because of the assistance from One-star Man.

Otherwise, he would have been eaten by the ancient flood dragon long ago.

“I wonder who the senior is. Judging from his looks, he seems to be related to Seven Star Black Sect and the person that was fighting with him… He might be an enemy of Seven Star Black Sect,” Jian Wushuang muttered, “Regardless, this favor has been engraved in my mind.”

One-star Man had saved him and he had even given him an opportunity.

The palm that he performed sealed in Jian Wushuang’s brain. The palm would provide Jian Wushuang with immeasurable help.

Jian Wushuang was still in deep thought but suddenly… There were three flowing lights traveling over from the void afar.

“Mm?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows. When he saw the three figures clearly, there was a chilly gleam in his eyes.

Among the three persons, Jian Wushuang knew two of them.

Sir God Qian Lan and Real God Han Quan, the two experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace, both of them had had conflicts with him in the Eighth Lair in the past.

Jian Wushuang had gained fame by stepping on the two experts’ shoulders.

Then, outside of Buddhist Demon Sea, both parties had crossed paths again.

“Enemies on a narrow road,” Jian Wushuang looked cold.

The three figures hailed and looked at Jian Wushuang who was floating quietly in the air. Sir God Qian Lan and Real God Han Quan quivered at the sight.

“Jian Wushuang!” Sir God Qian Lan clenched his fists.

“It’s him!!” Real God Han Quan revealed a terrified expression.

In the battle in the Eighth Lair back then, Jian Wushuang had injured Sir God Qian Lan badly and captured Real God Han Quan. In the end, Soaring Heaven King Palace had paid a great price in exchange for him.

Sir God Qian Lan was angry with Jian Wushuang while Real God Han Quan was fearful of him.

Although Real God Han Quan was also a Real God and an expert in the first few places on Real God ranking list, he had no courage to fight Jian Wushuang.

“The flowing light that burst out from Buddhist Demon Sea earlier, could it be him?” Sir God Qian Lan muttered.

“Sir God Qian Lan, let’s go,” Real God Han Quan said fearfully.

Sir God Qian Lan nodded faintly. He had fought with Jian Wushuang before and he had suffered a great loss. If there wasn’t any reason, he naturally didn’t intend to fight with Jian Wushuang again.

But just as the two of them turned to leave…

“Hold on,” Real God Ying Yun at the side, who had never spoken earlier, called them.

“Sir God Qian Lan, Real God Han Quan, didn’t the two of you realize that Jian Wushuang’s aura seems to be very weak?” Real God Ying Yun said.

“Weak aura?” Sir God Qian Lan and Real God Han Quan looked at Jian Wushuang carefully.

The two of them looked and they were surprised.

It was true. Jian Wushuang then, his aura was weak. To be exact, his aura was extremely weak.

They could even feel that Jian Wushuang’s aura might possibly vanish anytime.

“What happened?” Sir God Qian Lan creased his eyebrows, “He just came out of Buddhist Demon Sea. Did he run into any danger in Buddhist Demon Sea and get severely injured?”

“Very likely,” Real God Ying Yun nodded and smiled, “When he came out of Buddhist Demon Sea earlier, he didn’t fly out on his own but in an uncontrollable condition. It was as though he was thrown out. If I’m not mistaken, he definitely ran into some kind of trouble in Buddhist Demon Sea and got severely injured. As for his power, it definitely decreased tremendously.”

“Sir God Qian Land, this is a chance hard to come by for us.”

Sir God Qian Lan’s face grew cold when he heard that.

The feud between Jian Wushuang and Soaring Heaven King Palace was deep-rooted!

Jian Wushuang had made Soaring Heaven King Palace suffer a great loss and they had even become a laughing stock once. Such deep-seated grudge, Soaring Heaven King Palace naturally wasn’t willing to let it slip, but because Jian Wushuang was extremely powerful and he had Lineage of Star as his backer, it wasn’t easy to kill him.

But then… They were in the Sixth Lair, there was no one from Lineage of Star who could come to the rescue, and Jian Wushuang was severely injured.

This chance was truly hard to come by.

“Such a great opportunity, we shouldn’t miss it,” Sir God Qian Lan clasped his hands together and there was light shimmering in his eyes, “Han Quan, Ying Yun, the two of you retreat to a place far away. Don’t let Jian Wushuang get any chance to catch the two of you.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Yes,” Real God Han Quan and Real God Ying Yun nodded.

With the previous lesson of Real God Han Quan’s experience, the two Real Gods naturally retreated to somewhere far away as they were going to launch an attack.

As the two Real Gods retreated, Sir God Qian Lan walked towards Jian Wushuang slowly.

“Jian Wushuang, how do you do?” Sir God Qian Lan flashed a malicious smile.

“I see. It’s Sir God Qian Lan from Soaring Heaven King Palace. We just fought not too long ago. I never thought we were going to see each other so soon,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and he looked like he couldn’t be bothered. “Why? Your previous injury recovered so quickly?”

“Humph!” Sir God Qian Lan humped coldly.

He had been severely injured by Jian Wushuang as he had bee careless and it had established Jian Wushuang’s name. To him, it was a humiliation.

“I was careless last time. As we have met again today, I’d like to regain my name,” Sir God Qian Lan’s voice was bright and clear. He flipped his wrist and a red rod appeared in his hand while a fierce aura soared from Sir God Qian Lan’s body.

“Want to fight?” Jian Wushuang smirked and waved his hand. Then, two rays of golden light suddenly lit up.
