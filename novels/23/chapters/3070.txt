Chapter 3071: The Order

“Senior Mo Shan is here? Is he here for me?” Jian Wushuang had a strange look on his face.

In his opinion, Mo Shan’s invitation was the second time.

According to the rule of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, only two invitations could be given to the same genius. If both invitations were rejected, the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces would not invite him for the third time. Then the high-level experts of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces would not, should not have come looking for him.

But now…

After knowing the identity of the person who had come, Sect Master Si Lan did not dare to reject him. She immediately went to personally bring him in.

Very quickly, the white-haired Elder Mo Shan appeared in front of everyone.

“Oh, is this place quite lively?”

The moment Mo Shan arrived, he saw the existences of Bai Jue, Iceberg, and the others.

“Master Bai Jue, you are actually here as well?” Mo Shan looked at Bai Jue with a strange gaze.

“Mo Shan, long time no see. How have you been?” Bai Jue’s expression was somewhat unfriendly.

“Haha, it has been many years since we last met. The last time we met, you suffered a small loss at my hands. Looking at you, I’m afraid you still hate me, right?” Mo Shan laughed heartily.

“Hmph.” Bai Jue snorted and said, “I can’t be bothered to argue with you about the past. Tell Me, why did you come to the Young Divine Sect today? Could it be because of this little fellow?”

“You guessed correctly. I came for this Heavenly Sword Marquis.” Mo Shan directly said.

“How can that be? Although this little fellow’s talent isn’t bad, if he joins the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, he would most likely be able to join the Heaven and Earth Palace. As for whether he would be able to join the Primordial Palace or not, it is still unknown. Such a genius shouldn’t be worth it for you, the high and mighty Principles Master, to personally make a trip, right?” Bai Jue frowned and said.

“Aren’t you a Principles Master as well? Didn’t you also appear here?” Mo Shan said with a playful tone.

“I’m different from you. I have some friendship with the founder of the Young Divine Sect. I’m just passing by to take a look,” Bai Jue said.

“It doesn’t matter what you think, but I’m indeed here today for this little fellow,” Mo Shan said.

“Even so, everything must come first, right? This little fellow was discovered by my Dao Palace first, and he was also the first to be invited by my Dao Palace. Even if you have a motive, you have to wait for him to refuse to join my Dao Palace first,” Bai Jue said in a low voice.

“No, no, no, master of Bai Jue, I’m afraid you’re wrong about one thing.” Mo Shan gave a strange smile. “The Heaven-cleaving Alliance has long discovered this little guy called Heavenly Sword Marquis, because he is a heaven-level member of our Heaven-cleaving Alliance. When he was in the endless territories, our Heaven-cleaving Alliance had invited him to join the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. We even invited him twice, but he just refused.”

“If you don’t believe me, you can ask the little guy yourself.”

Bai Jue immediately looked at Jian Wushuang.

“The Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces did invite me twice, and the second time was personally invited by Elder Mo Shan,” Jian Wushuang said with a straight face.

“See, even if it’s first come, first served, it’s not your Dao Palace’s turn,” Mo Shan sneered.

“Humph, so what?”

“You said it yourself, the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces have invited this little guy twice, but he refused. According to the rules of the three Heaven-cleaving Palaces, they won’t invite him for a third time, right?” Bai Jue stared at Mo Shan.

“No, of course not.” Mo Shan shook his head directly. “According to the rules of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, any genius will only invite him twice at most. This is an iron law set by the Alliance Master, and no one can violate it. However, I’m not here today to invite this little guy to join the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, but I have another matter.”

“What’s the matter?” Bai Jue asked.

“It has nothing to do with you. Why are you in a hurry?”Mo Shan glanced at Bai Jue, then walked up to Jian Wushuang.

“Little guy, I’m here to convey the orders of the three Palace Masters of the three palaces,” Mo Shan said seriously.

“Three Palace Masters?” Bai Jue’s expression immediately changed.

He was a high-ranking official of the Dao Palace, and the Dao Palace usually had exchanges and competitions with the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. Therefore, he naturally knew about the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces.

They were the three Principles Masters who stood at the peak of the Divine Beginning Realm. They held an important position in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, and they were only second to the mysterious Alliance Master of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

The three of them had given an order? And this order had something to do with Heavenly Sword Marquis? 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Jian Wushuang also looked at Mo Shan solemnly.

“The three Palace Masters have said that you are extremely talented and have unlimited potential. Your future achievements are limitless. Although you are unwilling to join the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces because of personal problems, the three Palace Masters still hope that you can receive the most training. Therefore, after a discussion, they decided to make an exception and allow you to enter the Heaven-cleaving secret realm once! Heaven-cleaving secret realm!” Mo Shan said, his expression was solemn.

“Heaven-cleaving secret realm?” Jian Wushuang was puzzled.

The experts and disciples of the Young Divine Sect were also puzzled.

Even Sect Master Si Lan, Bai Xiao, and the other Dao Palace disciples did not know what the so-called Heaven-cleaving secret realm was.

Only Bai Jue and Iceberg were shocked when they heard the words ‘Heaven-cleaving secret realm’.

Bai Jue, as a Principles Master, was so shocked that his eyes almost popped out.

“How is this possible?!”

“This is impossible!”

Bai Jue let out two roars and stared at Mo Shan. “Mo Shan, are you kidding me? How could the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces give such an order?”

“This is impossible. The Heaven-cleaving mystic realm is an incredible opportunity. Countless geniuses in the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces drool over the Heaven-cleaving mystic realm. However, there are only a few spots in the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces every ten thousand years. Why would they give a spot to an outsider?”

Bai Jue was very clear about what the Heaven-cleaving mystic realm represented.

It was because he knew that it was impossible.

At least from what he knew, the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces would never be so generous.

“You don’t believe me?” Mo Shan glanced at Bai Jue and then smiled playfully. “This matter has nothing to do with you. I don’t care whether you believe me or not. In short, I’m here to pass on the orders of the three Palace Masters.”

“You…” Bai Jue stared at Mo Shan, but no matter how he looked at him, he could not tell that Mo Shan was joking.

“Did the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces really give such a generous order?” Bai Jue could not help murmuring in his heart, “But even if the three Palace Masters were really generous, they should have given these opportunities to a truly amazing genius. But Heavenly Sword Marquis…”

Bai Jue looked at Jian Wushuang again.
