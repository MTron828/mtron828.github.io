Chapter 807: An Eternal Realm Puppet Fighter

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

In fact, from smashing the shop to suppressing Su Ming, Jian Wushuang had done all these in a split second.

He acted so quickly that the surrounding experts of the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion had no time to react, but Su Ming had already been suppressed.

After all these, Jian Wushuang waved his hand slightly. The giant towering mountain began to shrink and returned to his hand, instantaneously turning into a scarlet sword.

“Now that my purpose has been achieved, I’m leaving.”

Jian Wushuang grinned, then he immediately turned and flew away.

These experts certainly would not allow him to leave. However, Jian Wushuang, who had turned into an Ancient God, was as formidable as Lei Xin. The strong experts in the streets of Heavenly Cloud Pavilion were only at Step Three or Four of the Eternal Realm. Even if they joined hands, they could not stop him.

In the end, Jian Wushuang’s Slaughter Body calmly left.

At this time, Lei Xin and Mr. Wu were still in pursuit of his World Body.

His World Body fled all the way, and finally left Cercis Island to the endless waters outside the island.

“Humph, he’s courting death!” Lei Xin’s complexion was cold.

“If he stays on Cercis Island, I’ll still have some scruples because of the Cercis Army. Now that he has left the island, where there is neither shelter nor restraint, I will kill him in whichever way I want!”

“Don’t drop your guard.”

Mr. Wu turned to Lei Xin and reminded him, “From his previous actions, he is wise enough to know that to leave Cercis Island is to lose his refuge. Now that he has left the island, maybe he has a plan or even set a trap to get us here on purpose.”

“A trap?” Lei Xin said in disdain, “He has just come here from the Firmament Territory and does not know anyone here. What kind of trap could he have? Unless… ”

His face abruptly changed. He thought of a possibility.

This had been a trick to lure the tiger from the mountain!

“Damn it!” Lei Xin cursed.

He quickly took out his Message Token and wanted to inquire about the situation in the shop. At this moment, Jian Wushuang, who had been scurrying ahead, suddenly stopped and turned to look at Lei Xin.

“You two chased me out for so long and even out of Cercis Island. Aren’t you tired?” Jian Wushuang smiled, looking emboldened.

This scene made Lei Xin and Mr. Wu look worse.

By this time, Lei Xin had received news about the situation in the shop and discovered that Su Ming had been suppressed and taken away.

“Is it a doppelganger?”

“You’ve actually cultivated the Doppelganger Secret Skill?” Lei Xin cried, shooting Jian Wushuang a frosty look.

He knew it was Jian Wushuang who had taken his disciple away from the shop, and now there was another Jian Wushuang in front of them.

To have two bodies concurrently, obviously, Jian Wushuang had cultivated the Doppelganger Secret Skill. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Haha, it’s too late for you to know now.” Jian Wushuang’s mouth curved into a smile. “Your disciple has fallen into my hands. He can’t live.”

“Humph, if my disciple is dead, then you’ll have to go down with him!” Lei Xin snarled.

“Go down with him? Really?”

Jian Wushuang sneered and pointed his Emperor Sword at him from afar. “Lei Xin, I know you want to kill me, so I’ll give you a chance.”

“The Cercis Army interrupted our fight earlier. Now, let’s fight again!”

“Haha, that’s ridiculous. I have Mr. Wu to help me. Do I really need to fight one-on-one with you?” Lei Xin sniffed.

“Mr. Wu?”

Jian Wushuang looked over at the old man shrouded in the black robe beside Lei Xin. Then he said, “Well, you’re only from the Eternal Realm. Which step have you reached?”

If an Eternal Realm expert did not exert his power, no one else could tell by the mere appearance of his aura which step he had reached, not even Jian Wushuang.

“I’m a worthless old man. I’m only at the peak of Step Five, just like Elder Lei Xin,” Mr. Wu said bluntly.

“Two experts at the peak of Step Five?” Jian Wushuang’s brows arched.

He had thought that Lei Xin was his only opponent, so Mr. Wu’s appearance was totally unexpected, but he could still deal with him.

“Mr. Wu, I want to fight Lei Xin alone today, so you stay out of our fight,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile. Then he waved his hand, and a strong figure of three-meter high appeared in the void.

The burly figure looked indifferent without any emotion, and its eyes were abnormally cold.

“It’s a Puppet Fighter?”

The complexions of Lei Xin and Mr. Wu changed. They could see from a glance that it was a Puppet Fighter of a high rank.

Actually, that Puppet Fighter was a present given to Jian Wushuang by his second Senior Brother Purple Mountain during their first meeting.

Initially, Purple Mountain said that if the Puppet Fighter exerted all his strength at the cost of millions of Divine Gems, he was equivalent to that of an expert at the peak of Step Six of the Eternal Realm.

The Puppet Fighter was one of Jian Wushuang’s trump cards. It was the first time he had taken it out in front of others.

“Second Senior Brother said that although this Puppet Fighter is powerful, it consumes incredibly large amounts of Divine Gems. I have some Divine Gems, but I cannot afford to waste them,” Jian Wushuang reflected for a while before he pointed to Mr. Wu and ordered the Puppet Fighter, “Hold him. Don’t let him interfere with my fight.”

“Yes.”

The three-meter high Puppet Fighter nodded dully and then darted out.

He passed the void like a flash of thunder and appeared in front of Mr. Wu. Then his right hand clenched into a fist, gathering a terrifying force, and bombarded Mr. Wu.

An Interspatial Ring was worn on a finger of the Puppet Fighter’s right hand, of which there were tens of millions of Divine Gems. It was all the Divine Gems Jian Wushuang had collected.

As he attacked Mr. Wu with his fist, hundreds of thousands of Divine Gems in the Interspatial Ring immediately turned into dust.

This was when Jian Wushuang deliberately asked him not to play to his full strength. If he did his best, a single blow would cost millions of Divine Gems, and of course, it would generate more power.

BOOM!

With this blow, several space rifts immediately spread out in the void.

The alarming power had turned Mr. Wu pale, and the next moment he took out a black sickle.

He wielded the sickle and swung out, carrying powerful knife essence, which collided with the Puppet Fighter’s blow.

BANG!

There was a loud noise. Mr. Wu was smashed and flew out. Nonetheless the Puppet Fighter’s power did not decrease at all, and he aggressively pursued Mr. Wu.

He soon overtook Mr. Wu, and it was clear that he had the upper hand. Mr. Wu was completely subdued and had no chance to fight back.

Jian Wushuang smiled coldly at their fight. Afterwards he turned his eyes on Lei Xin again.

“Now it’s just the two of us left!”
