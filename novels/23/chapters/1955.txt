1956 Enthusiastic, Madness! Part 1

“That’s true but we’d better be extra cautious.”

Ancestor Tian Chen didn’t dare to act recklessly but asked, “How did the forces, sects and also solo experts in Sanctuary Alliance respond to it?”

“How else? They’re mad!” East Royal Emperor said directly, “It is a brand new ancient battlefield. It is different from the one in ancient mystery land. The ancient mystery land was found in the first era and the experts in first era already searched through it once. When it comes to the second era, many of our experts are still enthusiastic about it.”

“However, this is a brand new ancient battlefield. Its value is far more precious than ancient mystery land by a hundred times, a thousand times, or even ten thousand times!”

“Forget about the experts and forces in Sanctuary Alliance, even I, if it isn’t because the two dark forces are at the verge of action and Sanctuary Alliance needs to take charge of the overall situation, I would have been on my way to the brand new ancient battlefield.”

East Royal Emperor absolutely didn’t exaggerate.

A brand new ancient battlefield was far more valuable than ancient mystery land by a hundred or a thousand times!

“If you feel so, I think the other few couldn’t sit still either,” Ancestor Tian Chen sighed.

“Of course, they can’t. I already heard that Red Dragon King, Abysmal Sanctuary, Colored Glaze Emperor, Purple Moon Emperor have already departed. I reckon the others will leave soon as well. As for the forces and experts under Sanctuary Alliance, most of them have already received the news and prepared to depart. As for those forces and sects that received the news first, I think a large number of experts have already reached the space gap located in the ancient mystery land.”

“Besides, the people that Sanctuary Alliance arranged among the special tribe sent updates too. The higher-ups and experts among the special tribe seem to have received the news too. They are getting ready too.”

“Even the special tribes are taking action?” Ancestor Tian Chen was surprised.

Eternal Chaotic World was huge.

Besides human cultivators, there were many special tribes, including Ancient Gods.

The special tribes lived in different territories and they had hardly crossed paths with human cultivators. However, it didn’t mean that they weren’t well-informed.

Once a major incident took place in Eternal Chaotic World or when there was huge opportunity, not only human cultivators but special tribes would be startled.

“It is the first time we have experienced the birth of a brand new ancient battlefield in the second era. It would be impossible for it to not stir any commotion. However, the ancient battlefield didn’t appear earlier nor later but right now. It appeared at the most unstable times in Eternal Chaotic World. I wonder if it’s a blessing or disaster,” Ancestor Tian Chen muttered.

The birth of a brand new ancient battlefield would signify a major transformation and opportunity to countless cultivators in Eternal Chaotic World.

However, Ancestor Tian Chen was very worried.

“Oh yeah, does Emperor Bai know about this yet?” East Royal Emperor asked.

“I already sent a message to report to him. He simply asked a few questions but didn’t comment much,” Ancestor Tian Chen said.

“Will he be heading over to the brand new ancient battlefield?” East Royal Emperor was curious.

“I have no idea. But I think so,” Ancestor Tian Chen made a wild guess.

…

The experts from various forces in Eternal Chaotic World went crazy just as East Royal Emperor had expected.

The birth of a brand new ancient battlefield was too attractive to many Almighties.

There was no one who could resist such temptation.

Naturally, there were countless experts preparing to depart to the ancient battlefield.

Abysmal Palace.

“Sanctuary Master!”

Palace Master Wu Luo’s face was fixed on Abysmal Saint Master, who was engulfed in darkness in front of him.

Twelve thousand years ago, in the war with Lineage of Star, Abysmal Saint Master had been severely injured by a mysterious Emperor Thirteen with one stroke. He had nearly lost his life.

Although he had spent the past twelve thousand years in recovery, Abysmal Saint Master had gotten better but he still looked rather pale.

“The birth of a new ancient battlefield was a huge land of opportunities. I, Abysmal Palace, can’t miss it. Get ready now and depart soon. I’ll make a move first,” Abysmal Saint Master said in a deep voice.

“Yes.”

Palace Master Wu Luo immediately took the order and went to get ready immediately.

After Palace Master Wu Luo left, Abysmal Saint Master flipped his hand and took out an elixir. The elixir was of an extremely high standard and it was from the ancient battlefield.

Abysmal Saint Master swallowed the elixir and his face became rosy after a while.

“I already took seven of the elixirs. I only have a total of nine. However, I have recovered less than seventy percent!” Abysmal Saint Master’s gaze turned gloomy as hatred filled his heart.

“The birth of a new ancient battlefield is a chance hard to come by. As long as I receive a huge opportunity, I will have a chance to match evenly with Emperor Thirteen and Emperor Bai, or even be above them!”

“Emperor Thirteen, Emperor Bai, just you wait!!”

Abysmal Saint Master immediately departed. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

…

Soaring Heaven King Palace.

In the lofty hall, Soaring Heaven King Palace’s two founders, Emperor God Tian Ling and Emperor God Tian Xiao, sat side by side.

As for the bottom, there were a few Almighties left from Soaring Heaven King Palace but there were only six of them. Among them, there were two who Soaring Heaven King Palace had paid a great price to pull them in.

“The birth of a brand new ancient battlefield is really a huge opportunity. However, the ancient battlefield has yet to be verified and no one is certain that that ancient battlefield will not have great danger. Just in case, I will make a trip to the ancient battlefield alone,” Emperor Tian Ling’s cold voice resounded.

“Tian Xiao, you stay put at Soaring Heaven Land and wait for my update. Wait until the ancient battlefield is verified, then, send the experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace.”

“Yes, brother,” Emperor God Tian Xiao nodded and reminded, “The brand new ancient battlefield has great opportunities but carries danger too. You’d better be careful.”

“Don’t worry. I know my limits,” Emperor God Tian Ling nodded faintly.

Then, Emperor God Tian Ling went to the space gap in ancient mystery land alone.

As for the other experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace, no one had moved yet.

…

Real Martial Arts Divine Church.

Since the war in Lineage of Star, Real Martial Arts Divine Church had suffered a great loss. Their master had been killed in the war as well. Hence, their overall power had diminished.

Then, with all Almighties in Real Martial Arts Divine Church added up, there were only fifty percent left and there was only one Emperor God left.

Then, the Emperor God’s eyes were showing joy as he looked at the surrounding four Sir Gods.

“We, Real Martial Arts Divine Church, suffered great losses after the war with Lineage of Star. On top of that, Lineage of Star has been cornering us over the years and we are in a desperate situation. If this continues, we of Real Martial Arts Divine Church will be wiped out by Lineage of Star one day and become history.”
