Chapter 3068: Master Has Arrived

_____________

Is he stronger than them?

No one dared to deny this.

“The most important thing is that the Heavenly Sword Marquis only used one sword attack. Although he said that it was the only sword attack he could use, we have no idea how strong his talent in Sword Dao is. It’s still unknown, and we have no way of testing it out,” the black-robed youth said.

“That’s why it’s so troublesome. But no matter what, just the talent he’s displaying right now should be enough to make the Dao Palace take him seriously,” the red-haired man said.

“Bai Xiao, this is within the Young Divine Sect. The Heavenly Sword Marquis is also a guest in your sect. What do you think we should do?” The beautiful woman in golden armor looked at Bai Xiao.

“I’ve already reported this matter to my master,” Bai Xiao said directly.

“Lord Bingfeng?” The red-haired man and the other two immediately looked over.

“It’s a coincidence. Master happened to be visiting his old friend in the first heavenly layer. He rushed over from where he was and will be here in less than three days. Once master arrives and personally meets the Heavenly Sword Marquis, we can decide what to do then,” Bai Xiao said.

“Yes, Master Iceberg is an Invincible Immortal Saint and one of the higher-ups of the Dao Palace. We can’t find out the truth about the Heavenly Sword Marquis, but he will be exposed in front of Master Iceberg. At that time, we will see how talented he is. At the same time, we can decide how much we have to pay to recruit him,” the red-haired man said.

There was no doubt that Dao Palace would be interested in a sword principle genius like Jian Wushuang.

As for how much it would cost Dao Palace to recruit him, it would depend on Jian Wushuang’s specific talent and strength.

…

Deacon Wan arranged a place for Jian Wushuang and Jiu Luo before leaving.

Jiu Luo stayed with Jian Wushuang.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to do that,” Jiu Luo said apologetically.

“I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He knew that Jiu Luo did not mean to do that, so he did not blame the latter.

However, after this collision with Bai Xiao, he was afraid that he would encounter some trouble.

Of course, it was not a big trouble, and it would not pose any threat to him.

“Bai Xiao and the others are from the Dao Palace of the Divine Ancestor Daoist sect, and the nature of the Dao Palace is the same as the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. Now that I have shown some tricks in front of Bai Xiao and the others, they will certainly report this matter to the higher-ups of the Dao Palace. Perhaps the higher-ups of the Dao Palace already know about it and have sent people over,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

The experts sent by the Dao Palace must have come to rope him in.

“Whatever, I’ll just take it one step at a time.” Jian Wushuang did not think about it anymore.

Then, he temporarily settled down in the Young Divine Sect.

In the blink of an eye, three days passed.

Outside the mountain gate of the Young Divine Sect, two figures slowly walked over from the distant void.

They were clearly still quite a distance away from the Young Divine Sect, but in just a few steps, the two of them had already arrived at the entrance.

“Lord, we have already arrived at the Young Divine Sect.” A white-robed man with an ice-cold aura spoke with a hint of respect.

“Mn.” The one who replied was a white-haired elder with a child’s face. This elder was thin and weak, and his eyes were extremely small, like the eyes of a mouse.

The elder with a child’s face and white hair looked down at the ancient sect below, but his expression slowly changed.

“The Young Divine Sect… The one who founded the Young Divine Sect back then still has a certain degree of friendship with me. We even went to a dangerous place to explore together. Unfortunately, his ambition was too great, and he wanted to search for a great opportunity in the cosmic battlefield. In the end, he died in the cosmic battlefield.” The elder with a child’s face and white hair sighed softly, his voice was also rather deep.

“Iceberg, isn’t that disciple of yours in the Young Divine Sect? Send a message to him,” the white-haired elder instructed.

“Yes.” The iceberg-like white-robed man nodded slightly. He then took out his token and sent a message to Bai Xiao.

After sending the message, the two of them waited here for a short while.

The mystic realm where the Young Divine Sect was located suddenly shook. Soon after, the mountain gate opened, and dozens of figures came out to welcome them.

These dozens of figures were led by a middle-aged man in a loose robe. Behind him were the many elders of the Young Divine Sect, and Bai Xiao and the three geniuses from the Dao Palace were also among them, soon, they arrived in front of the white-robed man and the white-robed elder with a child-like face and white hair.

“Haha, our Young Divine Sect is truly honored to have Mr. Iceberg come personally.” The middle-aged man in the loose robe let out a hearty laugh. However, he suddenly noticed the white-robed elder with a child-like face beside the ice peak.

This elder exuded an extremely unique aura, and his entire person seemed to be incompatible with the surrounding space and time.

“This is…the Principles Master!” The eyes of the middle-aged man in the loose robe suddenly narrowed.

“It’s Lord Bai Jue!” Bai Xiao and the three Dao Palace disciples immediately recognized the white-haired old man. “Lord Bai Jue actually came personally?”

“Sect Master Si Lan.” The iceberg-like white-robed man, Iceberg, looked over at the middle-aged man in the long robe. “This is Lord Bai Jue. He happens to be in the first heavenly layer this time, so he came with me.”

“Young Divine Sect’s Sect Master Si Lan greets Lord Bai Jue.” Young Divine Sect’s Sect Master and the elders behind him immediately bowed.

Although the Young Divine Sect was one of the twelve divine sects in the first sky, the strongest expert in the divine sect right now was only a peak rank seven True Saint. In terms of strength, he was far inferior to Iceberg, facing a Principles Master, he was naturally trembling with fear.

“No need for formalities.” Bai Jue waved his hand, he said, “The founder of your Young Divine Sect has a certain relationship with me. This old man received news that a good Sword Dao Genius has appeared in your sect, so I came over to take a look with Iceberg.”

“Lord has a relationship with my sect?” The Sect Master of the Young Divine Sect, Si Lan, was delighted.

“Sect Master Si Lan, please lead the way,” Iceberg urged.

“Please follow me.”

Si Lan immediately led Bai Jue and Iceberg into the sect.

Soon, they arrived at the place where Jian Wushuang and Jiu Luo lived.

“Bai Xiao, go and ask him to come out,” Si Lan instructed.

“Yes.” Bai Xiao immediately walked forward.

Meanwhile, Iceberg asked, “I received a message from Bai Xiao earlier. I know that a Sword Dao genius has appeared in your Shaotian Sect, but according to what Bai Xiao said, this person is not a disciple of your Shaotian Sect?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“That’s indeed the case. This little fellow called Heavenly Sword Marquis is merely a guest in our Shaotian Sect. He has nothing to do with our Shaotian Sect, so no matter what choice he has, our Shaotian Sect can not force him,” Si Lan said.
