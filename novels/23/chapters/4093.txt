Chapter 4094: Sensing

“Although the Nine Luminaries Great Star Field does have quite a few connections with the experts of some of the major powers in the depths of the universe, the side that attacked this time was able to send out a Supreme-being. Naturally, their strength wouldn’t be too far off. At the very least, they should be one of the top powers in the universe. Logically speaking, there shouldn’t be any need for such a top-tier power to hide. It’s just a grand celestial domain. If it wasn’t destroyed, it would’ve been destroyed. There shouldn’t be a need for us to escape in advance,” A gentle female voice said from within the storm.

“It’s strange indeed. The people who attacked us were extremely fast. However, when they sensed that we had arrived, they immediately left without leaving any traces behind. This way of doing things doesn’t seem to be the work of those big forces in the universe. Instead, it seems to be the work of those people.” An aged voice sounded.

“Those people?”

The super existences in the storm instantly became solemn.

“If those people really did it, then there must be a big secret hidden in the Nine Luminaries Great Star Field. The reason why they want to wipe out the Nine Luminaries Great Star Field is probably to cover up that secret,” said the arrogant man.

The people around also nodded in unison.

They were all top existences in the universe, and each of them had an extraordinary background. Naturally, they knew more about the secrets of the universe.

And the style of the group of experts who attacked the Nine Luminaries Great Star Field this time did indeed remind them of a mysterious organization.

If it really was that group of experts who attacked, then this Nine Luminaries Great Star Field was definitely not ordinary.

“Unfortunately, we came a little late. This Nine Luminaries Great Star Field has been almost destroyed. Those people have also escaped long ago, leaving no trace behind. If we want to find that secret, I’m afraid it won’t be that easy,” said the ancient voice.

“Even if we can not find it, we must find it. We can not come here in vain.” A gentle female voice sounded.

While these few Rulers were conversing within the storm.

The expression of one of the human figures, the wild and arrogant man whose eyes were as sharp as an eagle, changed at this moment.

“Huh?”

“This kind of sensing, could it be…”

A trace of surprise flashed across the wild and arrogant man’s eyes. “There is clearly a great distance from me, yet this sensing is still so intense?”

“This is interesting.”

The untamed man gave a strange smile and looked around at the people around him. “Everyone, it wasn’t easy for me to make this trip. I don’t intend to return just like this. I’ll just wander around the Nine Luminaries Great Star Field. If there’s anything, just send me a message.”

After the untamed man finished speaking, he directly turned around and left.

Most of the other Rulers in the storm didn’t feel anything wrong when they saw the arrogant man leave. However, one of the Rulers, a yellow-robed old man, cast a glance in the direction the arrogant man had left.

“This guy is usually very lazy. This time, he probably came to the Nine Luminaries Great Star Field because he received orders from the higher-ups. Given his personality, if those people had already left, he wouldn’t have bothered to look for them. Instead, he would have returned. However, why does he have so much free time today to wander around this great star area?” The yellow-robed old man narrowed his eyes.

Soon, the yellow-robed elder left in the same direction as the arrogant man.

…

In the dark, cold void of the universe.

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged, recovering his divine power.

As for Leng Rushuang, Devil Flame, and Eighth, they stood in the surrounding void and did not disturb him. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Jian Wushuang had lost too much divine power in this crisis, so it would take a long time for him to recover.

Even if he recovered his divine power, Jian Wushuang did not dare to enter some Star Worlds. Although there were still many Star Worlds left in the Nine Luminaries Galaxy, because of the frenzied slaughter of those people, Jian Wushuang still felt that it was safer to recover his divine power in the dark void of the universe.

However, what Jian Wushuang did not expect was that even though he was in the dark void of the universe, someone still found him.

Whoosh!

A stream of light suddenly flashed in the surrounding void and disappeared. A figure slowly appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and the others.

The figure was not very tall and looked very ordinary. However, the most noticeable thing was that he had a pair of eagle-like sharp eyes. After he came to this void, his sharp eyes spread out, his eyebrows were full of arrogance.

“Is it you?” The arrogant man asked, but his eyes were completely fixed on Jian Wushuang.

“Who is it?”

Devil Flame, who had been protecting Jian Wushuang, rushed over at the first moment and stared at the arrogant man with vigilance.

At the peak of Devil Flame, he was an Ultimate Ruler and had traveled in the depths of the universe. Naturally, he had a broad vision. Although he could not see the specific strength of the arrogant man in front of him, he knew intuitively that…this unruly man was not someone to be trifled with.

“I’m looking for him, not you. It’s best for you to leave,” the unruly man said with a faint smile. He did not even make a move, but as soon as he finished speaking, a powerful pressure pressed down on him.

Under this pressure, Devil Flame’s body suddenly trembled, and he immediately fell to his knees. No matter how hard he struggled, he was unable to stand up.

“Supreme expert!” Devil Flame’s eyes were full of fear.

Leng Rushuang and Eighth, who were in the void, were also shocked.

In the void in front of them, Jian Wushuang, who had been concentrating on recovering his divine power, also sensed the movement and opened his eyes immediately.

“Another Supreme expert?”

Jian Wushuang raised his head and looked at the arrogant man with an extremely ugly expression.

Supreme-being was the pinnacle expert in the universe.

Even in the depths of the universe, where experts were as numerous as clouds, Supreme-being experts were Supreme existences. It was usually very difficult to meet them, let alone at the edge of the universe.

But today, in the Nine Luminaries Galaxy, in just half a day, he had met a total of three Supreme-beings!

The first one was the one who had crushed the Dusty Rain Star Field and almost killed him.

The second one was the Ruler of the giant face who had saved him at the critical moment. He was the Supreme-being expert hiding in the Nine Luminaries Galaxy.

And the arrogant man in front of him was the third one!

In half a day, he had met three Supreme-beings. Since when did a Supreme-being expert become so worthless?

“My Lord, are you looking for me?”

Although he was a little nervous, Jian Wushuang still asked calmly.

“Yes, I’m looking for you.” The arrogant man smiled, but then he extended his right hand and pointed at Jian Wushuang.
