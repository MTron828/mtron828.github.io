Chapter 3521: 600 Years

It was quiet in the Star Palace.

Jian Wushuang was alone in his courtyard, cultivating and no one came to disturb him.

He could feel at ease comprehending the destruction principles and studying swordsmanship at the same time.

Time passed quickly. In the blink of an eye, 600 years had passed.

In a secret pavilion in the Star Palace, several high-level experts of the Star Palace gathered together and were sorting out some information about the Universe Battlefield during this period.

“Everyone, take a look at this information.” Axe One Master waved his hand, and immediately, a piece of information appeared in everyone’s line of sight.

The content of the information was that an advanced universe true treasure armor had appeared on Blood Rock Mountain battlefield, which had caused a lot of competition, and this advanced universe true treasure armor had been obtained by Gold Master in the end.

“Gold Master? Isn’t this old guy adventuring in Quicksand Demon Realm? When did he go to Blood Rock Mountain?” Star Saint Master said.

“He probably went there in the near future. My Star Palace hasn’t heard anything about him, but I’m sure he’s lucky. He got an advanced universe true treasure armor not long after he arrived,” a red-clothed girl said with a smile.

This red-clothed girl was one of the higher-ups of Star Palace, Seven Emotions Master.

To be able to become a higher-up of Star Palace, this red-clothed girl was also a Principles Master who had reached the sixth level of the void realm Realm.

“Tsk, tsk,” said Marquis Duan Yu. “This Golden Crow Master’s combat power is already extremely powerful, and he’s already considered quite strong among the Principles Masters of the sixth level of the void realm Realm. Now that he has obtained an advanced universe true treasure armor, his combat power will definitely be stronger than before. In the future, he’ll be even more difficult to provoke.”

“Who cares?” Seven Emotions Master said, “Anyway, there’s no enmity between Golden Crow Master and my Star Palace. Whether he’s strong or not has nothing to do with us. In the future, we just need to pay a little attention to him. There’s no need to pay too much attention to him.”

“Compared to Golden Master, I’m more concerned about that God Fei Master who appeared in Devil Smoke Valley recently!”

“God Fei Master?”

Hearing this name, the expressions of the people present immediately became solemn.

“This God Fei Master is indeed worthy of being taken seriously. After all, ever since he appeared in Devil Smoke Valley, he has been killing experts in a frenzy. Furthermore, his killing spree is extremely frenzied. Regardless of who the other party is, regardless of what background the other party has, which faction he comes from, or even whether he is weak, as long as he meets him, he will not hesitate to kill him with all his might.”

“Most importantly, he is terrifyingly strong. From the strength he displayed previously, he should have already reached the peak of the sixth level of the void. Such a powerful madman would be a huge headache for any power.” Axe One Master said.

“Indeed. I don’t know where this God Fei Master came from. Before this, he didn’t have any fame at all. Now that he has appeared, he is slaughtering maniacally. Furthermore, his survival abilities are extremely strong. Previously, he angered an expert at the pinnacle of the sixth level of the void, but in the end, he easily escaped from the hands of that expert. This proves that to kill him, at the very least, a ruler-level expert would have to act personally.”

“But how many ruler-level experts do we have in this territory? If we don’t reach a certain level, why would we lower our status to deal with a Principles Master?” Marquis Duan Yu asked.

A ruler-level expert was high and mighty, something a Principles Master could not compare to.

However, because a ruler-level expert was too aloof, they would not lower their status to deal with a Principles Master personally unless the other party really offended them too harshly.

However, in ordinary small fights, for example, the current God Fei Master wantonly massacred in Devil Smoke Valley. However, he massacred experts from all sorts of factions and was not a single faction, so he did not cause too much of a loss to any faction, a ruler-level expert would not personally appear.

“According to my estimations, this God Fei Master shouldn’t be an expert from our territory. He might be from another territory. When he heard that we have three great battlefields here, he specially rushed over. We’ve already encountered quite a few madmen like him who have no background and are incomparably powerful. All of them are extremely difficult to deal with. The best way to deal with such madmen is to stay at a respectful distance. Send a message to all the experts under my Star Palace who are adventuring in Devil Smoke Valley to be extremely careful of this God Fei Master. The moment they see him, they will immediately flee for their lives.”

“Although this God Fei Master is powerful and his life-saving abilities are exceptional, his methods of pursuing and killing others aren’t necessarily that brilliant. As long as we don’t let him get too close, the Principles Masters within our Star Palace will have a very high chance of escaping,” Axe One Master said.

“Mm, that’s all we can do.”

Everyone present nodded.

And at this moment…

“Oh?” Axe One Master’s expression suddenly changed.

“Axe one, what’s wrong?” Marquis Duan Yu looked over.

“It’s my little friend, the Heavenly Marquis. He just sent me a message saying that he’s going to Devil Smoke Valley to explore,” Axe One Master said.

“My little friend, the Heavenly Sword Marquis?” Seven Emotions Master’s expression changed. “The little friend you’re talking about, could it be the Immortal Saint called Heavenly Sword Marquis sword that you brought from the Divine Beginning Realm?”

“It’s him.” Axe One Master nodded.

“This little fellow, has he gone mad? He is an Immortal Saint, but he actually said that he wants to go to Devil Smoke Valley?” Seven Emotions Master said in surprise.

“That might not be the case.” Marquis Duan Yu smiled. “Seven Emotions Master, you might not know this, but although Heavenly Sword Marquis is only an Immortal Saint, his combat strength has long surpassed that of an ordinary Principles Master. Back then in the Great War of the Nine-tailed Clan in the Divine Beginning Realm, I personally saw him kill a Principles Master of the fourth level of the void realm by himself. Therefore, in terms of combat strength, he is at least at the peak of the fourth level of the void realm and is at the fifth level of the void realm.”

“In addition, his talent is extremely shocking. After cultivating in my Star Palace for six hundred years, his strength must have improved. Now that he says he wants to explore Devil Smoke Valley, he must have a certain degree of confidence.”

“An Immortal Saint killed a Principles Master of the fourth level of the void? Is this true?” Seven Emotions Master was in disbelief.

“This is absolutely true. Axe One Master, Star Saint Master, and I saw it with our own eyes,” Marquis Duan Yu said.

“It is true.” Axe One Master and Star Saint Master nodded.

“Even if it is true, he is still an Immortal Saint. It would be too ostentatious for him to venture into Devil Smoke Valley,” Seven Emotions Master said.

“That’s why he’s sending me a message now. He wants me to think of something, such as finding him a supreme treasure that can hide his godly power aura.” Axe One Master smiled. “There’s an obvious difference between the Principles Master and the Immortal Saint. It’s nothing more than his godly power aura. As long as there’s a treasure that can hide his godly power aura, naturally no one will know that he’s the Immortal Saint.”
