Chapter 2135 Shocking the Three Emperors World

Dan Clan was exterminated.Even though the Chaotic Realm experts had managed to rush back from the Imperial City in time, it did not change the fact that they were exterminated.

Over ninety percent of the experts from the Dan Clan were killed. Only the lucky few escaped.

The Dan Clan disappeared within moments.

The one who had caused this was the Old Monster Hong Chen who had disappeared over a million years ago.

This news spread like wildfire across the entire Three Emperors World.

Many of the experts and clans were surprised and were all commenting on the incident.

“Old Monster Hong Chen is alive after all these years?”

“Not only is he alive, he has become even stronger? He must have encountered great opportunities during the time he was gone and become a top tier Middle Stage Chaotic Realm.”

“This old monster is still so fierce and heartless. The first thing he does when he comes to light is to exterminate a clan. He is not even affected after killing so many cultivators.”

“He is called Old Monster Hong Chen for a reason. He was never a kind man. Back then, it was the Dan Clan that caused him to almost die. Now that he has finally recovered some power, what is stopping him from taking revenge?”

Many of the experts in the Three Emperors World were talking about this incident.

No one doubted his true identity, no matter what their opinions on the matter were.

There was nothing to be suspicious of.

Everyone believed that the one who had exterminated the Dan Clan was Old Monster Hong Chen, who had disappeared a million years ago.

However, within a city somewhere in the Three Emperors World, an elderly man in red clothes was in disbelief when he got news of this.

“Who? Who is impersonating me?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

This elderly man in red clothes was the real Old Monster Hong Chen.

He had been hiding his true identity all this time as he was afraid of the Dan Clan.

Now… Dan Clan had been exterminated. Most importantly, he was the one who had exterminated it?

He was still an Early Stage Chaotic Realm expert. How could he exterminate the Dan Clan alone?

Without a doubt, there was someone using his identity.

“Why did he impersonate me? What is his goal?” Old Monster Hong Chen muttered to himself. He then shook his head and continued, “It does not matter. He helped me exterminate Dan Clan and avenged me.”

“I shall let him use my name to do whatever he wants.”

Old Monster Hong Chen did not plan on exposing Jian Wushuang. Even though the Dan Clan had been exterminated, he would never use the identity of Old Monster Hong Chen ever again.

Old Monster Hong Chen’s name had become well known in the Three Emperors World after the Dan Clan was exterminated.

Jian Wushuang had achieved his goal.

“Now I can enter the Imperial City confidently.” Jian Wushuang smiled as he headed toward the entrance of Imperial City.

At the gate of Imperial City, it was guarded tightly. The elder in grey clothes who had stopped Jian Wushuang from entering was still standing there.

Hum~~~

An extremely evil and gloomy aura could be felt from the space far away.

This aura was flamboyant. Even though the person was still far away, the elderly man in grey clothes noticed it.

“What an evil aura. Who is that?” The elderly man in grey clothes knitted his eyebrows.

Soon, the owner of the aura appeared at the entrance and revealed his face. It was an elderly man with red hair and clothes.

“Huh. It has been so long since I was last here. The Imperial City feels different.” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself casually.

“May I know who you are?” The elderly man in grey clothes asked Jian Wushuang.

“I am Ancestor Hong Chen.” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Ancestor Hong Chen?” The elderly man in grey clothes turned pale. The actions of this devil were widespread across the Three Emperors World.

According to some, this devilish man had been meditating in a secluded cave until some real gods chanced upon his cave and woke him up.

He had then immediately exterminated the Dan Clan, which caused quite a commotion.

Now, he was here at the Imperial Palace.

“Oh. So why are you here at the Imperial Palace?” The elder man in grey clothes asked.

“Hehe. I have reached the peak of Middle Stage Chaotic Realm. I am very close to Peak Chaotic Realm. Why do you think I am here?” Jian Wushuang smirked.

“You are here to use the resources within the Imperial Palace to break through to Peak Chaotic Realm.” The elder man in grey clothes understood his intentions and was not suspicious at all.

“Hey old fool, are you going to let me through?” Jian Wushuang said impatiently.

The elder man in grey clothes knitted his eyebrows.

Even though Old Monster Hong Chen was infamously known to be a?devil, he still had the right to enter the Imperial Palace as long as he was an almighty.

“You can enter. I have to remind you to control your temper and not break any rules inside the palace. Even though you can exterminate the Dan Clan alone, there are still many experts within the palace who can kill you easily.” The elder man in grey clothes said.

“I do not need someone like you to remind me of these things. Scram and stop blocking my way,” Jian Wushuang roared as he headed into the palace.

The elder man in grey clothes knitted his eyebrows lightly but did not stop him.

“It took some effort, but I finally made it in.”

Jian Wushuang smiled as he looked around within the Imperial Palace.

Since he had made it into the Imperial Palace, what followed would be much more simple.

“This is Emperor Summit? The protecting formation is gone?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up when he saw the magnificent summit in the distance.

The Imperial Cabinet was located at the top of that summit.

He remembered he had only managed to successfully enter the Emperor Summit after winning the qualification battle.

Now, the Emperor Summit was completely open to the public.

Beside the Emperor Summit, there were three large statues which stood tall and proud. There had originally been a golden vortex in the middle of the three statues. Now that the Supreme Emperor Stone was destroyed, the vortex had disappeared too.

Many people were meditating in front of the three statues.

Within a bar inside the Imperial Palace, Jian Wushuang sat there drinking wine. He was also listening in to the people around talking about the changes to the Imperial Palace.

According to what the waiter was saying, the changes to Imperial City had happened about ten years ago. Someone had ventured into the Emperor Summit and destroyed the Sacred Stone (Supreme Emperor Stone).

The people in the Three Emperors World called the man who had destroyed the Supreme Emperor Stone the Devil!
