4760 Night

The old customers who had concealed their sword principle auras gave Jian Wushuang a very strange feeling.

However, he did not think too much about it. After all, he was in the vast Northern heaven celestial continent, and it was possible that there were Sword Immortals.

After a brief discussion, the three of them returned to their rooms to rest.

Under Cheng Qing’s strong request, the three of them squeezed into a side room.

Jian Wushuang turned over and sat on the window sill in comprehension. He shook his head helplessly.

He gradually discovered that when he was together with Cheng Qing, he was more and more like when they started from insignificance and wandered in the mortal world.

Eating, drinking, and sleeping, these bad habits should be stopped in time.

After taking another big gulp of the so-called ‘mouth-chewed wine’, Chen Qing laid down on the bed and began to sleep.

After Chun Qiu’s previous battle where he could not even retaliate, he had been cultivating even more desperately.

Right now, other than the extremely powerful eight arm Arhat, he had no other magical power. Even if he was facing an ordinary Yan Immortal, he would be in a very passive position.

It was urgent for him to reach the Yan Immortal realm. Otherwise, he would never be able to catch up with Jian Wushuang.

For ordinary top cultivators, reaching the Yan Immortal stage might be a wild imagination, but the Chun Qiu was different. The blood of the Emperor flowed in his body. Even if the Emperor’s fate energy that he brought had declined to the extreme, it was enough for him to step into the Yan Immortal stage.

The entire Immortal abode pavilion was unusually quiet, and even the Heavenly City seemed to have fallen into silence.

Among the vast clouds, the sun that was shining down on the entire celestial province gradually dimmed.

The night that belonged to the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture was about to arrive.

Jian Wushuang sat on the windowsill and began to meditate.

Although he appeared to be meditating, his five senses were still keenly observing his surroundings.

As the clouds gradually thickened, just as Jian Wushuang was about to concentrate and enter deep meditation, a subtle voice made him open his eyes again.

He was very familiar with that sound. It was the sound of a sword being sheathed.

Inexplicably, Jian Wushuang thought of the mysterious seven swordsmen he had met earlier.

As if to confirm his guess, several gusts of wind suddenly rose.

Jian Wushuang looked up subconsciously and saw seven figures flying up and disappearing into the clouds in an instant.

He seemed to have sensed something and hurriedly woke up Chen Qing and Chun Qiu. Then, he leaped and flew into the Nine Heavens.

Soaring to the top of the clouds, accompanied by the sun and stars, but missing the Qi of the seven figures just now.

“Brother Jian, did you find something?” Chenq Qng and Chun Qiu also followed closely behind, standing on the clouds.

Jian Wushuang did not speak. Instead, he used his divine consciousness to deduce shrinking earth, mountains, and rivers. Soon, he looked at the sky behind him.

“There was something strange about those seven figures. Let’s follow them and investigate,” he said quickly and then took the lead.

As expected, after traveling for hundreds of thousands of miles, Jian Wushuang detected the seven swordsmen’s auras in the clouds.

With the presence, everything became simple.

The three of them followed the aura in the clouds and flew forward.

The vast Heavenly Cities were left behind, but this was just a corner of the vast Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture.

As he moved forward, the Yan power became more and more dense and pure. Jian Wushuang began to have doubts.

He had a premonition that the place the seven swordsmen were heading to was similar to them.

When the water parted, the moon could be seen. When the clouds parted, the sun could be seen.

When they passed through the layers of clouds, the auras of the seven swordsmen suddenly disappeared, and a magnificent Celestial Prefecture came into view.

The Celestial Prefecture, which had a diamond-shaped base, hung high in the sky. From every corner, there was a jade belt waterfall that hung down from the sky.

On one side of the Celestial Prefecture, there was a huge green tree that reached the sky. A golden cage was hanging on the branches of the tree.

Inside the golden cage, a red bird with a halo on its back illuminated the entire Celestial Prefecture.

Such a magnificent scene might not be comparable to the Heavenly Court where Zhen Wuyang was, but it was no exaggeration to call it a small Heavenly Court.

“This place can’t be where Prince Mo is staying, right?” Hidden within the clouds, Cheng Qing mumbled as he stared at the Celestial Prefecture.

Jian Wushuang nodded and said, “I don’t think anyone else has the ability to live in such a celestial province except for Prince Mo.”

Cheng Qing frowned slightly. “If this is really Prince Mo’s residence, I’m afraid that he is already plotting something.”

Looking down at it, this magnificent and magnificent Celestial Prefecture, whether it was in terms of its layout or the arrangement of imprisoning the Golden Crow as a pet, had the intention of matching the Heavenly Court. Anyone with discerning eyes could probably guess the ambition behind the master of this Celestial Prefecture.

“It seems like I have to vent the anger for the Young Emperor.” Chen Qing unconsciously tightened his grip on the True Sword at his waist, killing intent already appearing in his eyes.

“I advise you not to do it. Even if Prince Mo deserves to die, you can’t interfere. Don’t forget that his father is Zhen Wuyang,” Jian Wushuang said calmly. Then, he added, “Unless you have no other choice.”

Cheng Qing grinned, “Understood.”

“Let’s sneak in first, then we’ll make plans,” Jian Wushuang said, then he walked forward to the small Heavenly Court.

In the vast Immortal world, there were many Yan Immortals on duty in front of the gate of the Celestial Prefecture.

However, these guards all looked drowsy. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The three ghostly figures plunged into the Celestial Prefecture in an instant, bringing with them a gentle breeze.

“These clothes are really tight. I’m afraid that they’ll burst when we fight later.”

On the road paved with bluestone, three guards wearing the same uniform were walking side by side.

Jian Wushuang, who was the leader, changed his appearance from a middle-aged man to a young and valiant guard.

Cheng Qing and Chun Qiu also changed into the faces of the guards who had been knocked out.

Cheng Qing, who was more than three meters tall, was grumbling while carefully protecting the tight guard uniform on his body.

In the tranquil Celestial Prefecture, Jian Wushuang carefully sensed the possible unexpected situations around him.

At this moment, a cold shout suddenly sounded from behind. “Stop right there.”

The three of them were frozen on the spot. Cheng Qing had already placed his hand on the hilt of the sword at his waist. He was only waiting for the situation to go awry, and then he would burst out and kill.

Jian Wushuang turned around slowly and looked at the patrol guards fearlessly.

“You’re all on duty outside. Why are you heading to the Fifth Prince’s Heavenly Palace now?” one of the middle-aged patrol guards asked.

“We finished our duty outside. We’re going to be on duty at the Fifth Prince’s Heavenly Palace now,” Jian Wushuang answered.

After that, the middle-aged patrol master asked a few more questions, and he answered them fluently before letting them leave.

“Brother Jian, you’re really good. How did you know about these questions?”

“I was just guessing. Fortunately, I didn’t give myself away. Let’s go.”

“…”
