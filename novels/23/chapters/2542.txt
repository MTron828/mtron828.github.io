Chapter 2543: Failure

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

In a magnificent hall inside Shi Clan’s mansion.

Shi Qianhan waited quietly in this hall after returning from the Gladiatorial Arena.

A burly old man with green eyes was also in the hall. This green-eyed old man was a High-Level Ultimate God in the Shi clan.

“Elder You, you’ve traveled far. Were there troubles in your journey?” Shi Qianhan asked.

“Thank you for your concern. It’s a rather smooth journey albeit minor troubles when passing through Dark Thunder Territory but those bandits immediately flee after I mentioned our Shi Clan.” The green-eyed old man smiled.

The Shi Clan was one of Northern Darkstar Continent top-tier clans and considered the second-largest force in the entire continent after the Territorial Lord. They were undoubtedly extremely powerful.

Amidst Dark Thunder Territory’s rampant robberies, even the Eighteen Prefectures had to give the Shi Clan some face.

The green-eyed old man suddenly asked, “By the way, I hear something happened in the Gladiatorial Arena?”

Shi Qianhan coldly said, “Well, something did happen. A Primary-Level Ultimate God with unknown origins challenged the Blood Gladiators and won. He went wild with his bet and finally took home one hundred and sixty thousand Primordial Stone. Nonetheless, I’ve already asked the Third Elder to personally deal with this matter. I’m sure the Third Elder will return soon with the one hundred and sixty thousand Primordial Stones and that kid’s corpse.”

The green-eyed old man gave an understanding look.

At that very moment...

“Third Elder has returned,” reported a Shi Clan’s servant.

“Haha, he’s back!” Shi Qianhan happily exclaimed. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Third Elder who Shi Qianhan sent to deal with Jian Wushuang soon walked into the hall.

He did not appear to be in a good mood.

“Third Elder, did you kill Jian Yi?” Shi Qianhan immediately asked.

The Third Elder took a deep breath and answered with a low tone, “I’m incompetent as I’ve neither killed Jian Yi nor brought back the one hundred and sixty thousand Primordial Stones.”

“What?!” Shi Qianhan was shocked and deeply furrowed his brows. He pondered momentarily before asking, “He has helpers? Is that why you failed to kill him?”

“No.” The Third Elder shook his head. “I have four High-Level Ultimate Gods while he’s alone.”

“Then, why didn’t you bring back those Primordial Stones?” Shi Qianhan asked quizzically.

“We offered Jian Yi to join the Shi Clan as per your instructions when we found him, but he refused without hesitation. After that, the five of us concurrently attacked him with intentions to kill, and although we managed to suppress him we couldn’t kill him,” said the Third Elder.

“You couldn’t kill him?” Shi Qianhan was surprised.

The Third Elder was one of Shi Clan’s five Peak Ultimate Gods!

A Peak Ultimate God joined forces with four other High-Level Ultimate Gods, yet was unable to kill a Primary-Level Ultimate God?

How could this be?

“Jian Yi is much stronger than what we thought. He had shown only bits and pieces of his actual strength in the arena while keeping his true powers hidden. In the beginning, I watched from the sideline as the four High-Level Ultimate Gods battled against him. He was able to subdue the four by himself without giving them a chance to unleash their attacks on him,” said Third Elder.

“He’s indeed only a Primary-Level Ultimate God but is comparable to a top-tier High-Level Ultimate God when his divine power erupted. In addition, his swordsmanship and Law understanding are also at the Peak Ultimate God level. The secret techniques which he executed are also extremely powerful.”

The third Elder recalled Jian Wushuang’s secret techniques in the battle earlier.

The thousand-foot-high Golden God Shadow was mighty with ocean-like golden divine power currents sweeping through while the huge golden prison could lock up everything within Heaven and Earth.

There was also the golden armor strapped onto his body which enhanced his combat prowess.

Not forgetting his myriad of secret techniques!

“I tried my best and performed my strongest moves, yet was unable to hurt him at all. He probably knew we couldn’t do anything to him so he merely entertained us in the battle. He fought head-on against us for some time before deciding to leave via his enormous divine powers.

“There’s no way we could catch up with him. He could’ve left much earlier but deliberately stayed on to make a sport of us before leaving unfazed.” The third Elder narrated the whole battle ordeal and even added in some of his assumptions.

Shi Qianhan was perplexed after listening to the Third Elder.

“How come? How’s that possible?

“He’s merely a Primary-Level Ultimate God and you’re saying that he deliberately faced a strong lineup consisting of one Peak Ultimate God and four High-Level Ultimate Gods before calmly retreating?” Shi Qianhan found the truth hard to digest.

The green-eyed old man’s expression suddenly changed while sitting next to Shi Qianhan.

The green-eyed old man asked, “Third Elder, what does this Jian Yi look like? What are some of his noticeable traits? Was he using any particular secret techniques?”

“I cannot describe his look well, but I’m sure someone from the Gladiator Arena would’ve recorded him using an Image Token. It’ll be easy to find him. He wears a golden robe and appears to be very young. He’s exceptionally good with the sword with a high understanding of Space-time Law. He’s also able to concurrently discharge eleven apparitions,” said Third Elder.

“Golden robe, good with the sword, and a high understanding of Space-time Law?” the green-eyed old man murmured and suddenly sprang up from his seat, “It’s him. Yes, it’s him!”

“Elder You, do you know him?” Shi Qianhan looked at the green-eyed old man.

“No, I don’t personally know him but I’ve just heard of him from some of the Eighteen Prefectures’ bandits when passing through the Dark Thunder Territory,” said the green-eyed old man.

“Oh? What’s the matter?” Shi Qianhan asked.

“Not long ago, there’s a sudden shift among the Dark Thunder Territory’s Eighteen Prefectures. They’re no longer the Eighteen Prefectures and can currently only be referred to as the Fifteen Prefectures because three prefectures had been completely ruined by someone formidable.” The green-eyed old man filled in the detail.
