Chapter 5401 ¬†Fourth Prince

Bai Junwang couldn't help but feel a bit distressed watching from the side. The infusion of countless forces of nature seemed too wasteful for the task at hand. Killing a tier 4 Emperor was a simple matter, why go to such lengths?

Boom!

In the end, Yan Changqing couldn't bear it any longer, and his Origin Source, after expanding to the extreme, began to collapse.

Jian Wushuang pondered in his heart.

The collapse of the Origin Source, the move he had just thought of, didn't seem impractical after this experiment. To others, it might seem a bit extravagant.

But he had too much force of nature within him, allowing him to squander it as he pleased.

This was an experiment on the collapse of a tier 4 Emperor's Origin Source. If he used this move when casting the One Thought Universe, causing the universe to collapse, the Origin Sources of the powerhouses within the One Thought Universe would collapse along with it.

The ruthlessness of this move exceeded the imagination of outsiders because no one had ever been this crazy before!

Gong Miaoyi also saw through the personalities of the two.

One was reckless and impulsive, and the other was ruthlessly decisive.

Both were not insignificant figures, and their beauty had no effect at this moment.

"You, should have some grievances with the Mo Luo Kingdom!" Gong Miaoyi directly voiced her speculation.

Bai Junwang was first stunned, then turned to look at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang tapped the armrest of the throne, not too surprised, and praised, "Still quite clever!"

From their first meeting, he felt that this person was extraordinary. A tier 3 Emperor who managed to attract several tier 4 Emperors, whether it was because of appearance or methods, was not simple.

Swish!

Jian Wushuang teleported directly in front of Gong Miaoyi, his gaze fixed on her unparalleled beauty.

In the flickering depths of Gong Miaoyi's eyes, there was a trace of charm.

"What is your relationship with Mo Luo? Tell me everything!"

The Eye of the Candle Dragon activated, guiding Gong Miaoyi to reveal everything about the affairs of the Mo Luo Kingdom.

Upon learning everything, Jian Wushuang felt somewhat disappointed, but a hint of joy appeared when he heard about Turtle Spirit Island.

The eldest prince, Luo Sha, is there!

"Having a tier 7 Emperor is somewhat troublesome!" Jian Wushuang pondered, then turned to Bai Junwang and said, "When will the physical divine body arrive?"

Bai Junwang shook his head. "There's no reply for now, but it should be soon."

"Nonsense!" Jian Wushuang's expression darkened.

He had no prior knowledge that Luo Sha, the eldest prince of the Mo Luo Kingdom, was a disciple of the Turtle Spirit Island Lord. With a tier 6 peak strength, he had to wait for Luo Sha to come out; attempting to kill his way through would be seeking death.

However, once Bai Junwang obtained the physical divine body and fully restored his peak, everything would become feasible. Unfortunately, there was still no precise time on Bai Junwang's side.

"Sir, why not cooperate with this young lady? The Fourth Prince of the Mo Luo Kingdom is likely already waiting outside with his forces. If I fall, you will be trapped here, and even if you manage to escape, it'll be challenging to survive at the hands of the Fourth Prince, Luo Chuan!" Gong Miaoyi calculated, holding on to her last bargaining chip.

Jian Wushuang's eyes lit up. The Fourth Prince of the Mo Luo Kingdom!

Now the bait in hand is not enough. Jian Wushuang can only catch a Fourth Prince. If he can capture the external Luo Chuan, he might be able to lure out Luo Sha.

The two are real brothers, and he should come to rescue him. Jian Wushuang contemplated.

However, what if the Island Lord of Turtle Spirit Island personally comes? Bai Junwang's current strength is good enough to fight against a tier 5 order Emperor. At that time, let alone seizing the Beast God Weapon, it might be difficult for him to survive.

If it were other forces, he wouldn't be afraid.

But there are only a few disciples on Turtle Spirit Island.

Luo Sha's strength is also at the peak of tier 4. He may not come to the rescue, and even if he does, he may bring several tier 5 Emperors with him. The other party controls a batch of elite armies from the Mo Luo Nation.

He needs some preparation. The Fourth Prince outside is a good bargaining chip.

"Forget it, let's cooperate next time!" Jian Wushuang reaches deep into his hands, directly grabbing Gong Miaoyi's jade neck, ready to understand her.

Bai Junwang, standing on the side, reveals a strange look, but seeing Jian Wushuang's determination to kill, he dare not oppose it, only feeling regretful.

However, when Jian Wushuang's palm touches Gong Miaoyi, there is a hint of surprise in his eyes.

He found a faint commonality in the other party's body or the Origin Source.

Related to the Ultimate Origin Source.

His Ultimate Sword Dao was currently stuck at the seventh level, not even reaching the peak. The breakthrough seemed elusive, and he wondered when it would happen. On the contrary, the breakthrough in the realm of the Extreme Dao had a clear direction, with his avatar constantly contemplating within the black hole, advancing rapidly.

The realm of the black hole was a shortcut to the perfection of the Extreme Dao, an opportunity that his once most confident swordsmanship had never encountered.

After reaching the seventh level, what the swordsmanship pursued‚Äîpurity and perfection‚Äîbecame a dilemma for him.

The diversity of the Extreme Dao, encompassing all things without discrimination, contradicted the purity sought by the Ultimate Sword Dao, which aimed for the utmost simplicity and unity.

These two paths fundamentally differed, and it was already quite challenging for Jian Wushuang to cultivate both to such an extent.

Originally, he had planned to take it step by step. He wouldn't abandon the improvement of the Extreme Dao just because his Sword Dao was stagnant. Such a practice would be foolish.

As long as there was still room for improvement in the Extreme Dao, he wouldn't let go of any opportunity.

The same applied to his Sword Dao.

Now, however, he saw the Ultimate Dao opportunity, where the taste of the Ultimate Dao was present.

This was the first time Jian Wushuang encountered the aura of the Ultimate Dao in the Four Great Secret Realms.

In the Four Great Secret Realms, he couldn't even find a complete path, but now he encountered the Ultimate Origin Source. This shocked him!

He slightly loosened his grip on Gong Miaoyi's hand.

Unable to catch her breath, Gong Miaoyi found Jian Wushuang releasing his hold and sensed an opportunity. She trembled as she said, "Sir, spare my life, and I will reward you generously with treasures worth tens of billions of godstones. I am willing to offer them with both hands."

"Tens of billions?" Jian Wushuang shook his head. He didn't really care about that. He just wanted to know how the other party cultivated this Origin Source.

But this wasn't the place to consider these things. They had to get out first, and they could study later after leaving.

After releasing her iron-clamp-like grip, Gong Miaoyi took a step back, her chest heaving. Just moments ago, she had come dangerously close to death at the hands of Jian Wushuang, and now she dared not employ any clever tricks.

She had thought that Jian Wushuang, upon hearing about the treasure, had set aside his murderous intent. She quickly stabilized Jian Wushuang. Visitt novùíÜlbin(.)cùíê/m for the lùíÇtest updates

"Sir, I will activate the inheritance within the hall now. It will only take a day, and all the treasures will be yours. I only ask for my life!" Gong Miaoyi said as she bowed deeply.

From the looks of it, it was clear that she wanted Jian Wushuang to provide her with a guarantee.

Bai Junwang, standing on the side, remained silent. He could see clearly and understand Jian Wushuang's character. Since he chose to spare Gong Miaoyi, there must be some reason for it.

Otherwise, given Jian Wushuang's decisive and ruthless nature in combat, he would not have spared her.

Jian Wushuang saw through her intentions with just one glance and said coldly, "You can access the inheritance, but I will inspect it. Don't play any tricks, and your life will be spared."

With this promise, Gong Miaoyi wasted no time. She stood up and began to activate the inheritance.
