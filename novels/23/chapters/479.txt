Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The purple-clothed woman stared at the white-haired man for a long time before saying, “Sir, If I’m not mistaken, you are the famous Jian Nantian, aren’t you?”

“He is Jian Nantian?”

The name caused an uproar among the experts. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“This is beyond my expectations!”

“I heard that he killed all three of Blood Mountain Marquis’s sworn-brothers and enraged him. The lord is looking all over the place for him.”

“I heard that too. What’s more, the lord also said that whoever brings him Jian Nantian’s head will be given a Dao Weapon.”

“No wonder the three dead lords had wanted to kill him. They were after the reward, and maybe Jian Nantian’s longsword as well since it’s also a Dao Weapon.”

“That’s to say, killing him can earn us two Dao Weapons!”

“Well, I really admire his courage. He has enraged one of the top two Marquis, but he still dares to participate in this public meeting.”

“If I were him, I would hide somewhere or simply leave the Divine Land and become a local lord in the outside world.”

Discussions were heard continuously, mixed with wondering words.

Many people at present had heard of Jian Nantian before. Those who had not finally known?about him more or less from the discussion. When they learned that they could gain two Dao Weapons by killing Jian Nantian, their eyes betrayed their frenzied desire to kill him.

“Father.”

Jian Wushuang looked at the white-haired man in surprise.

The man was none other than his father, Jian Nantian.

It had been five years since he last saw his father. Now, they had finally met again.

However, Jian Nantian kept drinking in silence and did not seem to care about the discussions all these people were having on him.

The purple-clothed woman was not annoyed at the man’s cold manner and said with a smile, “Since you were forced to do so, I will have to let it go then.”

She looked around and continued, “Ladies and gentlemen, as all of you were invited here as my lord’s guests, so be a guest. Whoever makes trouble during the Sword Principle Meeting will be my lord’s enemy.”

The words echoed through the valley and intimidated the experts, forcing them to calm down.

They finally realized that they were at a place ruled by Su Ming and anything that crossed the line would be regarded as a challenge against the Lord’s authority.

Despite this, not everyone could ignore the temptation of two Dao Weapons. For the sake of Su Ming, they would put the desire aside until the meeting was over, but after that, they would not hesitate to kill Jian Nantian.

“Well, the Sword Principle Meeting will begin tomorrow, so everyone should go back and rest well.” Having said this, the women was the first one to leave with her group.

The experts headed back as well.

“Let’s go back too,” Hunjian Lord said to Jian Wushuang.

“Sorry, you go first. I have something to do here,” Jian Wushuang replied.

Hunjian Lord shot Jian Wushuang a surprised glance, but he didn’t say anything more and left with Tianming Lord.

Soon, the valley was quiet again.

A bright moon was high in the sky, causing the ground to be slightly illuminated by the moonlight.

Under the moon, Jian Nantian sat alone on the roof, drinking. His shadow was long and his hair was waving with the wind, giving him an ethereal look.

A figure approached him from behind.

Jian Nantian looked back and saw Jian Wushuang. The emotionless man finally showed a smile.

“Father,” Jian Wushuang called in a soft voice.

“Come here, take a seat.” Jian Nantian threw the wine to Jian Wushuang and added, “Have a drink with me.”

Jian Wushuang caught the wine and sat beside his father.

“You’ve grown a lot during the last few years.” Jian Nantian stared at Jian Wushuang with a grin.

“Not as much as you have, Father,” Jian Wushuang said and smiled.

He knew very well that even though he had made good progress and was considered an expert in the Divine Land, he still could not hold a candle to his father.

At least, he could not display an attack as fascinating as the one his father had just shown.

“Currently, without external forces, I can battle an advanced lord, but there is a long way to go before I can kill a superior lord and two advanced lords with one strike, as father has done,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

“I thought it would be ten years before I saw you again, but it’s only been less than half of that, hasn’t it?” said Jian Nantian.

“Yes, Father.” Jian Wushuang answered and smiled.

“Holy Emperor Palace has been destroyed, right?” His father asked.

“Yes, it was destroyed three years ago,” Jian Wushuang answered.

“Really?” Jian Nantian raised his brows, “That means it only took you two years to destroy it after I left. Well done, son. Much sooner than I had expected.”

“Not bad.” Jian Wushuang grinned.

The father and the son chatted while drinking under the moon.

When in front of strangers, Jian Wushuang was always aloof and would only be more sociable to his friends. However, at this moment, with his father, he was unrestrained and behaved like a child.

As for his father, Jian Nantian, who took nothing heart except his sword, he regarded Jian Wushuang as being more important than himself and his sword.

“Father, Why did they say that you offended Marquis Xuefeng?” Jian Wushuang suddenly changed the topic.

“Marquis Xuefeng?” Jian Nantian answered while smiling, “There is no need to be afraid of him. We should pay more attention to Su Ming.”

“Su Ming?” Jian Wushuang looked grave.

“Is he really the person who betrayed the Sword Ancestor?”
