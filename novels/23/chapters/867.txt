Chapter 868: A Newcomer?

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

It was in the depths of the Stellar Fog Sea.

Woosh!

A stream of light passed through the fog, and before long, it stopped in the void.

Jian Wushuang heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that the Exotic Beasts were gone, and put away his Dragon Blood Secret Skill.

The Dragon Blood Secret Skill increased his speed by burning his Spiritual Power, which would cost a lot. Although he had only used it for a short time, it already consumed nearly half of his Spiritual Power. But at least he got rid of those Exotic Beasts.

“The Dragon Blood Secret Skill that the Master gave me is very unique. It saved my life at a critical moment. It’s really great!”?Jian Wushuang thought.

In fact, Jiu Zui, Ling Long and Shui Jin all had life-saving means, but unfortunately, they were not very useful in the crisis they had just had.

“I didn’t expect that there would be such a terrifying Exotic Beast rampage in this Stellar Fog Sea!” There was a hint of terror in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

No one except a Dao Master export could fight against so many strong Exotic Beasts working together.

Although Jian Wushuang was strong, he could only run for his life in the face of this kind of Exotic Beast rampage.

“Shui Jin is dead, and I don’t know whether Jiu Zui and Ling Long can escape. I hope they will be lucky.”?Jian Wushuang sighed to himself.

He lingered there for the time being. He began to take an elixir to restore his health and Spiritual Power.

One day later, he had returned to his peak.

“From today, I can only rely on myself in the Stellar Fog Sea.”

Looking around at the vast void enshrouded in a mass of gray fog, Jian Wushuang clenched his fists and set off to wander around alone.

There was trouble everywhere in the Stellar Fog Sea.

The chance of an Eternal Realm expert being killed was too high if he wandered around alone in the Stellar Fog Sea.

If he came across some vicious Exotic Beasts, he might not be able to get away.

Jiu Zui and Ling Long had good strength, but the chances of them surviving were extremely low if they wandered around alone in the Stellar Fog Sea.

But Jian Wushuang was different.

He was the strongest among the four of them, and he could easily kill a common Exotic Beast. Even if he came across a few Exotic Beasts at the same time, he could kill them by virtue of his Ninth-heaven Sword Formation.

If he bumped into another rampage, he could also escape with his Dragon Blood Secret Skill.

He was extremely capable of surviving in the Stellar Fog Sea.

He was still wandering around the boundless Stellar Fog Sea. If he ran into an Exotic Beast, he would make his move and use it to hone his swordsmanship.

He had no idea when he could reach the end or walk out of this Stellar Fog Sea, he only knew that the stronger he was, the higher his chance of surviving was.

Two years flew by.

Adding together these two years and the year he wandered around with the other three, Jian Wushuang had been in the Stellar Fog Sea for three years.

Jian Wushuang was wearing a scarlet robe which was his blood-eagle armor, and carrying a longsword on his back as he walked slowly through the foggy void.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang stopped abruptly and looked straight ahead with the blood-red eye between his eyebrows.

An island was in sight, floating in the void.

The island was so huge that he could not see all of it with his naked eye.

He felt the island had a strong and magnificent aura.

He was very familiar with these auras. They were not the violent auras of those Exotic Beasts, but the Spiritual Power auras of human experts.

“There are people?”

Jian Wushuang was delighted, and he darted straight towards the floating island.

The edge of the island was completely paved with jade, and on it lay a chubby, bald teenager, half drunk, with a jug in his hand, his eyes blurred and his face flushed.

Woosh!

A scarlet-robed figure suddenly appeared beside him.

The bald teenager noticed and looked up to cast a glance at the figure, but what he saw was a very strange face.

At the sight of this strange face, the bald, blurry-eyed teenager suddenly became sober. His body shook, and the smell of wine vanished in a moment as he quickly got up.

“You are a newcomer? Haha!” The bald teenager looked at Jian Wushuang with burning eyes.

“Newcomer?” Jian Wushuang frowned, but did not answer.

But the bald teenager had apparently already decided Jian Wushuang was a ‘newcomer’. He shouted, “Quick, come quick, there is a newcomer.”

The bald teenager had a loud, sonorous voice, ringing throughout almost half of the island.

Hearing the shouting, this island that had been floating in quiet for many years was instantly in a state of commotion.

“Haha, there is a newcomer?”

“How long has it been? Three thousand years? There is a newcomer at long last.”

“The last newcomer who came here seemed to be called ‘Hei Qi,’ and he had good strength. But he was too stubborn to believe that people can’t leave the Stellar Fog Sea. He left us soon after he came to the island, and he has probably been killed by those Exotic Beasts by now.”

“Haha, it’s a rare newcomer. We should take good care of this young man.”

A lot of voices sounded from all directions and a lot of people were quickly rushing over. Just moments later, hundreds of people had appeared around Jian Wushuang.

They surrounded him, and he was in the center. They all looked at him with burning eyes.

“These people?” Jian Wushuang looked at these Human Warriors with a frown.

He could feel that the auras of these people were particularly strong. They were all in the Eternal Realm, and most of them were at peak Eternal Realm.

But what concerned him most was the way these people looked at him.

Their eyes were burning.

They were like beggars who had been hungry for several days and had just seen a delicious chicken leg. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Such hot gaze made Jian Wushuang extremely uncomfortable.

“Hey, this kid looks really handsome.”

Among the crowd, a burly man stuck his tongue out, licked his lips, and stared at Jian Wushuang with hot eyes. “Let’s follow the old rules. I’m first,” the burly man said to the others.

He then stood up.

“Brat, fight with me. If you win, no one on the island will make things hard for you. But if you lose, haha, then you have to hand over all of your treasures. In addition, you will have to make tea, beat our legs and serve us for the next thousand years.” The burly man wore a grim smile.
