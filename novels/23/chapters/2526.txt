Chapter 2527: Fusion Attack Techniques

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The glimmer of light was an extremely unique secret technique.

The two brothers then moved at the same time and simultaneously waved the giant axes in their hands.

Wow! Wow!

Two axe shadows, one domineering and the other extremely sturdy as they shot out at the same time before completely integrated into one in an instant.

“Heavenly Beast’s Descent!”

The two Luo brothers snorted as the glimmering lights on their bodies completely merged.

“Roar!”

A loud roar resounded abruptly. Under the fusion of both axe shadows, a ferocious wild beast descended from above.

The wild beast carried terrifying powers and attacked Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes sank. The divine power in him erupted before swinging across the Blood Mountain Sword in his hand.

Hate! Hate! Hate!

It’s still the technique Hateful Path Toward Heaven!

Embarking on an infinite hateful path.

Boom!

There was a loud noise as the beast which came out from the axe shadows was slashed and thrown back. It went rolling backward with an obvious decrease of divine powers.

“Again.” Luo Shan’s voice was cold.

“A Million Changes, A Million Beasts’ Evolution!”

Rumbling!

More lights were injected into the wild beast. After the wild beast stood firm on its feet, its momentum was rebuilt once again before charging forward and suddenly splitting into multiple beasts. In the blink of an eye, there were dozens of fierce beasts.

Those fierce beasts were extremely powerful and went right after Jian Wushuang as soon as it took shape.

A terrifying evil spirit filled the entire void which completely surrounded Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang scoffed as 11 apparitions were concurrently produced and slipped in between the wild beasts.

Thereafter, there were a series of strange and bewitching sword-lights illuminating among the beasts.

Every sword-light could easily kill a Primary-Level Ultimate God.

With just a momentary effort, Jian Wushuang’s figure retreated back to the original place as dozens of fierce beasts had already been swept away by the sword-lights.

“Any other techniques?”

Jian Wushuang stood there with his sword at hand, looking condescendingly at Luo Shan and Luo Hai.

The two brothers’ faces turned ugly.

Both of them were very powerful high-level Ultimate Gods and were very close to being a Peak High-Level Ultimate God. When they worked together to perform the combined attack, even the top High-Level Ultimate God experts would shun them. However, Jian Wushuang had parried off their fusion attack techniques head-on.

“Brother, use the ultimate trick!” Luo Shan said coldly.

“Alright.” Luo Hai nodded solemnly.

In an instant, the light glimmer appeared on them both again and condensed in the void ahead.

Both of them shouted at the same time, “Impersonation of a Beast, Devil’s Descent!”

Boom!

Heaven and Earth shook as infinite light gathered before the two brothers.

In the blink of an eye, a hundred feet tall devil appeared out of thin air from the gleaming light. The devil held a giant axe in his hand with its eyes emitting cold lights.

“Kill!” Luo Shan shrieked.

The hundred-foot-tall devil stepped out and held a giant axe with both of its hands before swinging it downward.

The axe had changed the colors of Heaven, Earth, and Space-time.

The void shuddered.

Jian Wushuang stood in front of the devil with his eyes focusing on the axe which the devil wielded.

The Golden God Shadow behind him was surging with divine powers and the infinite ocean of golden divine powers erupted.

Jian Wushuang shook his hands firmly and the Blood Mountain Sword turned into a long snake. Swash! The void was torn apart like pieces of paper with everything turning into nothingness.

No sound. No wind. No shadow.

The sword shadow was the only thing that swept around.

Space-time Sword Technique, Third Form—Pure Shadow!

Boom!

There was a loud noise and the sky shattered while the entire grounds trembled frantically.

The two brothers had already retreated to the void behind them as both Luo Shan and Luo Hai coldly stared at the void at the front.

The divine powers that had flooded the void slowly dissipated before the appearance of a powerful sword intent which completely annihilated the collision aftermath’s reverberation.

Once again, Jian Wushuang appeared in front of the two brothers.

“Did this golden-robed kid actually ward off our strongest move?” Luo Shan gritted his teeth tightly.

“His divine power’s breath is still full. It seems he has not suffered any harm.” Luo Hai added.

The two brothers exchanged looks as a thought entered their minds at the same time.

They knew it was impossible to kill the golden-robed man before them with just the two of them.

“Fortunately, our mission isn’t to kill but to keep him occupied and not allow him to escape,” said Luo Hai.

“Well, the Governor of Infernal Heart Prefecture should be here soon,” said Luo Shan.

Several shadows appeared in the distant void while the two were conversing.

Those shadows were moving extremely fast and appeared on the battlefield in the blink of an eye.

There were only five people. Among the five were four high-level Ultimate Gods and a thin black-haired young man standing in the center who was emitting a phantom-like aura.

The aura of the black-haired man was obviously stronger than anyone present and his aura had already surpassed the High-Level Ultimate God rank.

He was a Peak Ultimate God!

The phantom-like black-haired young man was also a governor of the top three prefectures in the Dark Thunder Territory, Governor of Infernal Heart Prefecture!

“Is he a Peak Ultimate God?”

Jian Wushuang stealthily glanced at the phantom-like black-haired young man with his narrowed eyes.

A Peak Ultimate God—a top Ultimate God who was just one step away from being an Earth Ultimate God.

Peak Ultimate Gods were considered super experts in both Dark Thunder Territory and Northern Darkstar Territory.

In many Northern Darkstar Territory’s prominent families, Peak Ultimate Gods were clan heads. The only one known to have power above Peak Ultimate God in the entire Northern Darkstar Territory was the Territorial Lord.

A Peak Ultimate God had appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang licked his lips but was still unflustered. On the contrary, his expectations were building up.

“Governor, you’re finally here.”

Luo Shan and Luo Hai both turned their heads to the phantom-like black-haired young man.

The phantom-like black-haired young man was the Governor of Infernal Heart Prefecture. He first glanced at Jian Wushuang before looking at the Luo brothers. “Are you two brothers unable to get him?”

“It’s a pity. This golden-robed kid is much stronger than we thought. We’ve joined forces by performing our fusion attack techniques and displaying our strongest moves. Unfortunately, we aren’t able to subdue him, not to mention kill him” said Luo Shan.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m
