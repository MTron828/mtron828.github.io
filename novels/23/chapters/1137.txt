Nine years swiftly passed.

Jian Wushaung was still in his secret chamber when an indifferent man with a longsword on his back appeared above Jian Wushuang’s mansion.

“Jian Wushuang.”

His cold voice traveled through many layers of Restrictions to reach Jian Wushuang’s ears.

Jian Wushuang was immediately awakened. His body turned illusory and in the following second, he appeared in front of the man.

“Sunrise Sword Emperor.” Jian Wushuang bowed to the man.

“It’s been 100,000 years. The World of Swords is opening again. Come with me,” Sunrise Sword Emperor said.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded, despite the surprise he felt inside.

He thought Sunrise Sword Emperor would send someone to take him to the World of Swords.

He followed Sunrise Sword Emperor to the wormhole of Green Fire Palace. They traveled through the wormhole and arrived somewhere on the massive battlefield.

“Is the location of the Secret Land of the World of Swords?”?Jian Wushuang frowned as he scanned his surroundings.

He saw a giant and boundless plain covered in a dense layer of grass.

The most eye-catching thing on the plain was a tall tree.

Though it was big and tall, it did not look very different from ordinary trees.

Jian Wushuang followed Sunrise Sword Emperor as they walked up to the tree.

“The World of Swords lies inside the tree,” Sunrise Sword Emperor said in an emotionless voice.

“What? Inside the tree?” Jian Wushuang asked in surprise.

The Secret Land of the World of Swords was inside such an ordinary tree?

“Be patient. We’ll wait here for a moment and soon you’ll get your answer.” Sunrise Sword Emperor closed his eyes.

Thus, Jian Wushuang stayed and waited. Just like that, three days quickly passed.

Suddenly, an ancient aura came out of the tree and its central trunk began to wriggle.

“It’s time.” Sunrise Sword Emperor opened his eyes and stared at the tree.

Jian Wushuang followed suit in staring fixedly at the tree. The trunk continued to wriggle until a dark and spiraling tunnel appeared.

This tunnel that led to a mysterious world was big enough for one person.

“This is the tunnel to the World of Swords. Remember, you can stay there for no more than 10 years. Whether or not you achieve anything, you’ll be sent back when the deadline comes. Of course, you’ll achieve a lot considering how talented you are,” Sunrise Sword Emperor explained.

“10 years?” Jian Wushuang gave a small nod.

“That’s enough talk. Get in,” Sunrise Sword Emperor said.

Jian Wushuang entered the mysterious spiraling tunnel without hesitation.

He reappeared as a light flared and found himself still on a plain.

“Hm?” Jian Wushuang frowned as he examined his surroundings.

He was still on a large and boundless plain, which seemed identical to the one he was on before. He also spotted a tall tree here.

The difference was that this tree was much larger than the one he saw across the tunnel.

He stared at the tree in astonishment. “This is… enormous!”

This tree was tens of thousands of times and even hundreds of thousands of times larger than the tree before. It was enough to shock him.

He had never seen such a large tree in his entire life.

He even thought that this tree might be bigger than the entire Eternal World.

When Jian Wushuang took a closer look at the tree, it appeared different.

“This isn’t a tree! This is a huge sword!” Jian Wushuang’s voice was trembling.

It was indeed a massive sword.

It was a sword that could shock the whole world.

“N-No, that’s not right!” Jian Wushuang squinted. This time, he focused on the trunk of the tree.

Millions of branches extended from the lush tree, forming such a full cover that they looked like a palm-leaf fan. There were still countless leaves on the tiny branches.

Jian Wushuang correctly guessed that the tree was not simply a huge sword. Its branches and leaves could all turn into swords.

These swords all contained a perfect Sword Principle each.

This large tree was a huge sword that contained a complete Sword Principle. This Sword Principle was also the strongest one!

The trunk was a sword with a complete Sword Principle of the Creation Level.

Each branch was a sword with a complete Sword Principle of the Universe Level.

Even the individual leaf was a sword with a complete Sword Principle of the General Level.

There was an abundance of Sword Principles here!

These distinct and different Sword Principles were in perfect harmony. Most importantly, they were all derived from the tree.

“Is this a single sword that yields millions of swords?”

Jian Wushuang was utterly stupefied.

He was this shocked because he had figured out the principle of the tree.

The tree that was not an actual tree was, in fact, a complete and amazing Sword Principle.

Most of all, in the same manner that a tree would grow branches and leaves, this Sword Principle also grew thousands of principles of the Creation, Universe, and General Levels.

What an incredible Sword Principle!

What an incredible method!

“I put so much effort into studying Coalescence Sword Principle all so I can gather different Sword Principles and coalesce them!”

“But this tree grows hundreds of thousands of Sword Principles… It’s completely opposite to my method.”

Jian Wushuang stared fixedly at the tree. In just a split second, he had gained many realizations.

Unification Sword and Derivative Swords had completely opposing natures.

Nevertheless, they shared many similarities.

Previously, Jian Wushuang had focused on learning to unify Sword Principles. He had failed to perfect it as he had done the coalescence clumsily. Now, as he stared at the tree, he came to realize the flaw in his process.

“Derivative Swords means growing like a tree!”

“The Coalescence Sword Principle is just like millions of rivers converging to form the vast sea!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes gleamed.
