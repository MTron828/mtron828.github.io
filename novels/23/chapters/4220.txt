The Wuqi Divine Sword flashed with a blood-red light and slashed at the head of the magma dragon!

Rumble!

A thunder-like explosion rang out!

!!

“Roar!”

The Flame Dragon roared in pain. On its head, a deep sword mark started from its head and extended all the way to its tail, as if it was going to cut the Flame Dragon in half!

under this strike, the magma dragon formed by divine power and the laws of yin and yang shrunk by half, and its divine power was obliterated.

Bang!

The huge Ice Peak that was heading toward Jian Wushuang was crushed by Jian Wushuang’s foot!

Jian Wushuang’s sword and kick had broken the two killing moves of Yin Yang Divine Lord!

“This kid!”

When Yin Yang Divine Lord saw this, his pupils shrank and his expression turned ugly.

This scene fell into the eyes of many Rulers of the Fifth City who had come from all directions to watch the battle.

They stopped in their tracks and their bodies trembled.

“There’s, there’s actually someone fighting with the Divine Lord!”

“Isn’t this the person that Sir Divine Lord put a bounty on?”

“This person is so strong! He’s only a fifth stage great Ruler, but he’s able to fight Yin Yang Divine Lords at the same time without being at a disadvantage!”

They all looked up at Jian Wushuang and their breathing became rapid.

“Yin Yang Divine Lords, that’s all you’ve got. Where did you get the confidence to ask me to kill myself? You dare to say you want me to be your slave?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold as he looked at Yin Yang Divine Lord and Yin Yang Divine Lord.

When the Yin Divine Lord and the Yang Divine Lord heard this, their faces turned extremely gloomy. They looked at each other, and the hot-tempered Yang Divine Lord immediately said, “Blood Sword, don’t be so smug.”

After saying that, Yin Divine Lord’s expression turned serious again. “Yang Divine Lord, don’t hold back. be careful not to fail miserably.”

Although the Yang Divine Lord had a violent temper, he was not a brainless person. He nodded and said in a deep voice, “Yin Divine Lord, then let’s use that move to suppress this kid.”

“Alright,” he said. Yin Divine Lord nodded.

Immediately, Yin Divine Lord’s aura rose sharply.

The two nomological powers, one Yin and one Yang, rose up and intertwined in the air, gradually merging together.

The principles of Yin and Yang that the two of them had comprehended were from the same source and complemented each other. At this moment, they were able to merge together without any obstruction.

After the two principles merged together, they gradually practiced and turned into a Yin Yang array diagram that swept across the world!

This Yin Yang array pattern covered the sky and ground, and its terrifying power crushed all the Qi movement like a millstone that could destroy the world!

“Oh?”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and a hint of surprise appeared on his face.

It was no wonder that even though both Ruler Bone Armor and Yin Yang Divine Lord were servants of that important figure in the back city, Ruler Bone Armor had been assigned to the First City.

The difference in strength between the two was too great.

“Blood Sword, go to hell!!”

At the next moment, the Yin Yang Divine Lord shouted at the same time!

In an instant, the Yin Yang formation map pressed down on Jian Wushuang with a mighty power that could destroy a star!

This is the trump card of Yin Yang Divine Lord!

Yin Yang Divine Lord, you are indeed an expert from the back city. You are much stronger than us!

For a moment, the powerhouses of the Fifth City who had come from all directions to watch shook their heads and exclaimed.

“Blood Sword, hold on!!”

As for Ruler Hao Jin, he stared at this scene fixedly. He did not even dare to breathe loudly, and his heart was in his throat.

In the void, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold and his black hair was flying.

He looked at the huge Yin Yang array diagram that was like a sun that was coming toward him. He took a deep breath and said, “Slash…star!”

Bang!

In an instant, the surging wind, the floating dust, everything in the air turned into the purest energy and rushed toward Jian Wushuang’s hand.

Not only that, but the Rulers and experts standing in the distance also seemed to be drawn to Jian Wushuang’s hands.

It was so grand that it covered the sky and the sun!

In the end, all of it was poured into Jian Wushuang’s hand and turned into a silver sword rainbow that was a thousand feet long!

Jian Wushuang had comprehended this sword move when he fought Ninth Kalpa King in the Divine Life Palace’s trial arena.

After Jian Wushuang broke through to the fifth level of Ultimate Ruler, he had reached the realm of great completion!

This sword was enough to destroy a star!

this sword was enough to split the milky way!

In the next moment, Jian Wushuang held the thousand-foot sword rainbow in his hand. His black hair flew in the air and the divine light in his eyes suddenly grew three inches!

“Slash!”

“Boom!”

Immediately, the silver sword rainbow slashed down!

This sword directly created a sky-shaking wave, and the sky seemed to be split in half by this sword!

Bang!

In an instant, the 300-meter-long silver sword rainbow fiercely collided with the Yin Yang sword pattern!

like a knife cutting through tofu, the yin yang array diagram was split 5000 feet!

Like a chaotic night being torn apart by lightning, the yin yang sword pattern was instantly shattered!

This sword was as destructive as rotten wood and destroyed everything!

It was extremely overbearing!

“What!”

In an instant, Yin Divine Lord and Yang Divine Lord’s bodies trembled violently. The shock and anger in their eyes turned into fear!

As for the silver sword rainbow, after it split the Yin Yang formation, it only paused for a moment before it slashed toward Yin Yang Divine Lord again!

“Run!”

Seeing this, Yin Yang Divine Lord’s eyes were filled with anger and he turned around to escape!

“Can you escape?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold. Holding the silver sword rainbow, he looked like a god.

“Innate divine power, original universe.”

Jian Wushuang said coldly, “In an instant, an invisible domain descended on the entire place and Yin Divine Lord and Yang Divine Lord’s footsteps slowed down.”

The silver sword rainbow finally slashed down!

“How dare you, thief? My master is the heavenly snake playboy!”

Yin Yang Divine Lord was horrified and divine power surged in his body in an attempt to resist!

However, in the face of absolute power, everything was useless.

The violent Yang Divine Lord’s divine body was covered in cracks like shattered glass under the sword!

Immediately after, Yang Divine Lord’s divine body collapsed in an instant, and countless divine powers were crushed into powder by the silver sword rainbow!

When Yin Divine Lord saw this, his face turned ashen and pale.

Boom!

Then, the silver sword rainbow that had killed the Yang Divine Lord fell on the Yin Divine Lord again!

Yin Divine Lord’s divine body started to disintegrate at a speed visible to the naked eye. Countless divine powers were obliterated.

“I’m done for.”

Yin Divine Lord heaved a long sigh and gave up struggling.

Just as all the divine power in his body was about to be completely crushed and his life was hanging by a thread.

Suddenly.

That silver sword rainbow actually quickly dissipated.
