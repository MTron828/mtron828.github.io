Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Heavenly Treasure Soul Offensive Divine Weapon? I was very lucky to get it, so how could I possibly get a second one?” Jian Wushuang smiled. “Well, let me find a way myself if that’s the case.”

Jian Wushuang stood up and walked out of Star Picking Pavilion.

“Goodbye, Master.” The Black Chief sent Jian Wushuang away.

The Black Chief immediately went to a bald man after Jian Wushuang left the Star Picking Pavilion.

The bald man was the one who had some entanglements with San Shouwang—one of the three Golden Chiefs in Star Picking Pavilion.

“Master, the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord has left,” reported the Black Chief in a servile tone.

The bald man asked, “What did he do?”

“He bought nine Heavenly Treasure Infernal Crimson Divine Swords for twenty-two million five hundred thousand Primordial Stones to perform the Transmigration Sword Formation. In addition, he also wanted to exchange his Primordial Stones for Divine Elixir Pills but I refused,” said the Black Chief.

“Hmph! Why would an Earth Ultimate God need nine Heavenly Treasure Infernal Crimson Divine Swords to perform the Transmigration Sword Formation? That’s a bit too luxurious, isn’t it?”

“Well, he was lucky enough to get a Heavenly Treasure Soul Offensive Divine Weapon and sold it for a hundred million Primordial Stones at the auction after all. He had also sold a Heavenly Treasure Defensive Armor at the same time and probably has a total of one hundred twenty million Primordial Stones. He still has a lot more to squander after deducting the forty million he spent on the Transmigration Sword Formation.”

The bald man stood up after pondering momentarily and said, “I’ll go out for a bit. Just find an excuse to dismiss them if other supervisors or the two other Golden Chiefs ask for me.”

The Black Chief was hesitant before he continued, “Master, the Star Picking Pavilion has a strict policy against targeting our customers, no?”

The bald man shouted, “What do you think I have in mind? There’s unresolved enmity between both of us, don’t I even have the right to resolve private grievances?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The Black Chief frowned but dared not continue.

The bald man soon left Star Picking Pavilion and went toward Jian Wushuang’s direction.

In the vast void, Jian Wushuang was seen in his golden robe and longsword on his back sauntering around.

He was muttering under his breath, “Primordial Stones are no longer useful to me now. I’ll need to get my hands on some Divine Elixir Pills if I’m planning to continue relying on refining divine power for my cultivation realm improvement. It’s a pity the Star Picking Pavilion won’t exchange it for Primordial Stones.”

Jian Wushuang was quite helpless.

Although he had bought a lot of treasures, he was still left with quite a lot of Primordial Stones on hand.

However, those Primordial Stones were of not much help to him at that moment.

The Black Chief mentioned to him that he could use other special treasures to exchange for Divine Elixir Pills with the Star Picking Pavilion, but he did not have any suitable treasures on him at the moment for such purpose.

There were many treasures in his possession with many of them being rather valuable.

The Stately Painting went without saying.

Blood Mountain Sword and Golden Glass Armor were his Life Divine Weapon and Life Armor. They were extremely powerful and invaluable.

The Fengtian Scroll from Crimson Stone Saint was of great help to Jian Wushuang’s enlightenment and cultivation.

Any one of those treasures could be used in exchange for a large number of Divine Elixir Pills but he would never do that.

Therefore, he had to come up with an alternative solution to get some Divine Elixir Pills.

Just as Jian Wushuang thought about it...

“Hmm?” Jian Wushuang was taken aback.

His soul power had been sweeping around and that was how he discovered someone within his soul detection range.

That person was emanating a particularly tyrannical aura.

“Are you here for me?”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes slightly and the opponent sped up as expected. A stream of light appeared in front of him in just seconds.

Hum!

The bald man who also wore a golden robe slowly emerged as the stream of light dissipated.

‘Golden robe...’ Jian Wushuang looked at the bald man’s golden robe with his constricted eyes. ‘This is the golden robe worn by a Star Picking Pavilion Golden Chief. He’s a Golden Chief from the Star Picking Pavilion. Is he coming after me for that incident?’

Jian Wushuang had sort of understood the other party’s intention at that moment.

“You’re the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord—Jian Wushuang, am I right?” The bald man stared at Jian Wushuang with a weird smile on his face. “My name is Yuan Lei, have you heard of me?”

Jian Wushuang instinctively shook his head.

Although Jian Wushuang knew Yuan Lei’s identity and was quite sure of his intentions, he had never heard of the name Yuan Lei.

“Tsk, it seems that San Shouwang had not mentioned my name to you, but you should know me nonetheless,” said the bald man, Yuan Lei.

“That’s for sure.”

Jian Wushuang verified his conjecture when Yuan Lei mentioned San Shouwang.

San Shouwang once revealed that he had an older brother—a Star Picking Pavilion Golden Chief who always kept an eye on him. That person must be Yuan Lei.

“Are you San Shouwang’s older brother?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Older brother? Well, I guess so.” Yuan Lei nodded.

“Although I don’t want to admit it, we did swear to be brothers when San Shouwang and I were only Divine Demons a long time ago. Unfortunately, he’s not very talented. I’ve already achieved so much and became the Star Picking Pavilion Golden Chief while he remained as an insignificant Territorial Lord after so many years.”

“Although he isn’t qualified to be my brother, we were brothers nonetheless. What do you think I should do since he died in your hands?”

Yuan Lei stared at Jian Wushuang with a strange smile.

Jian Wushuang looked gloomy and said in a low voice, “The battle for the Territorial Lord position was a matter of life and death. He’s weak and that’s why I’m able to kill him. Yuan Lei, you should know better being the Star Picking Pavilion’s Golden Chief. Besides, I’m a customer of the Star Picking Pavilion and have just left the Star Picking Pavilion. I’m afraid it’s inappropriate for you to do so, isn’t it?”

“I’m sure you would be in hot soup if your supervisor finds out, right?”

Yuan Lei sneered, “Hehe, I’m here for our private grievance. What will the supervisor do even if he finds out? Jian Yi, let’s not talk nonsense. I’m not here to avenge San Shouwang, but he borrowed a large number of Primordial Stones from me to purchase the fourth volume of the Divine Destruction Beast manual before he died. I can only ask you to pay me back on his behalf now that he’s dead.”
