5176 Give Me Face

Therefore, he had no choice but to gamble. Before entering the Qishen Temple, in addition to the transcendent innate treasure bestowed by the Emperor, he had exchanged an Emperor-grade Destruction God Crystal, a relic of the Emperor's own destruction, with all his accumulated wealth.

This Emperor-grade Destruction God Crystal was crafted by a formidable expert who had achieved Emperor status through the path of destruction. Though it was merely a first-grade god crystal, it possessed three-tenths of an Emperor's power. Once detonated, it could easily kill a Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, severely injure a peak powerhouse, and even pose a threat to an inattentive peak expert.

This was his ultimate trump card, and revealing it now meant he truly had reached a dead end.

"Mo Long, stop pretending. I know that you were severely injured the last round. I suspect you haven't fully recovered your strength yet!" Luo Hao raised the Destruction God Crystal high, continuing, "This is an Emperor-grade Destruction God Crystal. If you don't cease, I will detonate it, and we will all die together. Even if you can withstand the explosion, your divine body will be on the brink of collapse, disqualifying you from competing for the top 10 spots."

He had long sensed that God-Emperor Mo Long was not at his best, a deduction based on intelligence gathered a year ago. God- Emperor Mo Long was likely operating at only 80 percent of his full strength, currently secluded for recovery. This sudden emergence was probably due to Jian Wushuang's influence.

Thinking this, Luo Hao clenched his teeth. He almost forgot about Jian Wushuang. If not for that young man, he wouldn't have ended up in this dire situation. He was now facing the risk of falling.
Ôªø
However, he didn't have time to worry about Jian Wushuang now.

He needed to deal with the immediate threat. As long as he survived this ordeal, even if he had to turn the mountains upside down, he would find Jian Wushuang and obliterate him completely!

Even if they escaped the Qishen Temple, he wouldn't let Jian Wushuang off the hook!

Thinking about the legendary Grand Yan Immortal, 'Dao Lord Jiu Yu, in the Heaven-Reaching Buddhist Realm sent shivers down his spine.

Anyone who became a Dao Lord was not to be trifled with. An Emperor represented the success of combining Daos, and a Dao Lord represented the immense power of the original source, reaching a limit comparable to an Emperor. Only those who could rival Emperors earned the title of Dao Lord.

Those at the peak or half-step Dao Lord level were beyond their reach. Especially in the absence of an Emperor, these individuals were the strongest entities.

Even the mighty God-Emperor Mo Long didn't dare provoke a Dao Lord. Despite his formidable background, if faced with absolute power, even his most potent treasures could be easily neutralized. For instance, high-grade Destruction God Crystals.

"An Emperor-grade Destruction God Crystal!"

God-Emperor Mo Long sneered, saying, "How foolish. Even if you detonate it, even if I die with you, do you dare?"

In his view, if Destruction God Crystals were useful, he would simply buy a hundred of them. If he encountered someone stronger, he could throw one out, rendering him invincible.¬†

These Emperor-grade Destruction God Crystals only caused physical damage. Having a peak treasure armor was enough to withstand 99.9 percent of their destructive power. The remaining fraction could be neutralized by inner armor. Killing a peak Grand Yan Immortal was difficult, let alone a top-grade Perfected Nine Revolutions. At most, these crystals could intimidate the poor souls who couldn't afford peak treasures, a feeble attempt to frighten them. It was utterly laughable.

"You fool!" God-Emperor Mo Long mocked his opponent mercilessly, gradually eroding Luo Hao's mental defenses, causing him to collapse completely.

"Fine, if that's the case, then let's all die together!" Luo Hao, for the first time, activated the Destruction God Crystal. He had only heard of this kind of prohibited-grade disposable treasure before. He knew it might not kill his opponent, but he didn't expect God- Emperor Mo Long to be so unbothered.

God-Emperor Mo Long's eyes narrowed.

Whoosh!

A thread of Yan power seeped into the interior of the Destruction God Crystal, then it was thrown fiercely at Mo Long.

The black shining battle armor instantly enveloped Luo Hao, and he quickly retreated.

"This madman really dares to use it!" God-Emperor Mo Long chuckled. To prevent himself from being blown up by the Destruction God Crystal, he had to take out a suppressive type of innate treasure, directly suppressing the Destruction God Crystal in a cyan bamboo building.

"Transcendence Innate Top-Grade Treasure, Suppressing Jade Pavilion!"

Buzz!

A muffled sound, and the Destruction God Crystal detonated within the Suppressing Jade Pavilion.R√™aƒë latùíÜst chùíÇpters on nùíê/v/ùíÜ/l(b)iùíè(.)cùíêm

"Is that it?" Jian Wushuang was stunned.
Ôªø
He lowered his hands from covering his head, put away his only high-grade treasure shield, and let out a sigh of relief.

"Luo Hao's trump card!"

Jian Wushuang shook his head. In his heart, he thought, "I can't delay anymore. Luo Hao's state of mind has changed. If I don't help, he might really end up dead here."

From a distance, he could tell that God-Emperor Mo Long had been toying with Luo Hao all along. Although he didn't know the depth of their enmity, judging from the situation, it seemed that God- Emperor Mo Long was preparing to play Luo Hao to death.

His form halted; he had just intended to move, but he realized that someone had beaten him to it.

A man and a woman, both wearing colorful robes, their backs adorned with dreamlike feathers unique to the Great Dream Realm.

"Brother Mo Long, I have brought the 6th generation Chief Daoist of the Great Dream Realm. Could you please give me face and hand over this person to me?" The woman spoke, her voice firm.

Before God-Emperor Mo Long could react, Luo Hao, who had blocked his path, burst into laughter.

"Haha!" Luo Hao laughed arrogantly, dispelling his earlier frustration. He sneered, "I don't regret dying at all. With you two fools accompanying me, the journey won't be lonely!"

"You despicable scoundrel! How dare you speak so arrogantly in this situation!" the Great Dream Clan girl shouted angrily, her hands gripping a precious red long knife.

God-Emperor Mo Long stood still for a long time before he finally comprehended the situation.

"Are you people from the Great Dream Clan?" he asked.

They nodded in affirmation.
Ôªø
"Now, while you haven't provoked my wrath, get lost!" God- Emperor Mo Long's mind swiftly searched for information about the powerful beings in the Great Dream Realm. Then he shouted in anger, "Get out of here right now!"

The Great Dream Realm was just a medium-grade world; the strength of the Great Dream Dao Ancestor alone was formidable enough to rank among the top one hundred in the entire universe. His father indeed had some connections with the Great Dream Dao Ancestor, but Mo Long considered those connections as mere acquaintanceships.

Even if he had those connections, so what? The entire Eastern Domain, strictly speaking, was dominated by just two major forces: the Chishui Hall and the Eternal Tower.

Did they mean to imply that he could only kill powerful beings from the Eternal Tower based on this?

It was ridiculous. This alliance was temporary at best. When they entered the Qishen Temple, no one cared about alliances unless they were from the same clan or world.

Moreover, a Grand Yan Immortal who hadn't reached the Perfected Nine Revolutions level dared to come and demand respect at this moment.

He didn't know what to do.

Even peak-level experts wouldn't dare to demand respect at this moment, let alone someone who was just a Grand Yan Immortal on the edge of the Nine Revolutions. And he was asking for respect for this superpowerful being ranked within the top 1,000 on this original planet, a being with numerous achievements.

Such a fat lamb, he would gladly send them off.

Apart from the Dao Lords, even a Perfected Nine Revolutions wouldn't be tolerated at this moment.
Ôªø
"Mo Long, our ancestor has helped your father immensely. How dare you treat us so disrespectfully!" The Great Dream Clan girl's face was filled with anger, her expression one of incomprehension.
