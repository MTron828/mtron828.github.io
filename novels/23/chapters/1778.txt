Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Under the attention of many people, Jian Wushuang left the Colored Glaze Sanctuary.

When the news spread to the Thunderbolt Island, experts from countless powerhouses were all extremely shocked.

However, no one would look down on Jian Wushuang due to his choice. Instead, all of them admired and commended him. Quite a number of people thought even more highly of Jian Wushuang.

After all, a Great Emperor had come personally. Who would dare to go against her?

Jian Wushuang was quite powerful, to the point that he had gotten onto the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. However, he was not a hothead who would act recklessly.

“It is only by bearing with it for a short period of time one will have the chance to get to that supreme level in the future.” This was what Sir God Mad Dog, who was on good terms with Jian Wushuang, said when he got the news.

“For this battle, be it talents, abilities or nature, Jian Wushuang has no doubt shown us all of them. If he doesn’t die along the way, he will definitely become a Great Emperor in the future!”

“If he is able to obtain the training method for the Seventh Step of an Inverse Cultivator, it will not be difficult for him to achieve the level of a Great Emperor. Moreover, there might even be hope for him to reach a level close to Emperor Bai in the future.”

“Jian Wushuang is the number one genius of the current era!”

Countless experts were gasping in admiration and all of them had very high expectations of him. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ten days after Jian Wushuang had left the Colored Glaze Sanctuary, the attention of the experts of all the powerhouses in the Eternal Chaotic World shifted from Jian Wushuang to something else.

An even bigger incident had occurred in the Eternal Chaotic World.

“The Ancient Mystery Land is about to appear!”

This piece of news was like a storm which spread instantly.

…

In the Purple Moon Sanctuary, there were tens of figures standing in the vast Milky Way of the Star Land.

These figures were all Deacon Elders of the Star Land as well as some Chaotic Real Gods. As for the three people in front, they were the three Hall Masters.

Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Shi Yun were all standing over there and all their faces wore smiles.

In no time, two shadows appeared on a void that was far away. They were Jian Wushuang and the Star Palace Master.

“Haha, let’s welcome our hero back,” Hall Master Yuan laughed heartily.

As for the Elder Deacons behind, they revealed scorching hot eyes which were filled with admiration.

They had long known the news of Jian Wushuang massacring many experts of the Soaring Heaven King Palace wantonly in the Soaring Heaven Land and Sea Continent.

With regards to that, all the Elder Deacons were naturally inspired.

It should be known that the Soaring Heaven King Palace had always been very unreasonable. Throughout the ages, they had always been the ones bullying others. Hence, when had they been bullied by others to the point that they had to use their trump card and that many of their experts were massacred? Thus, this had helped to vent the anger of the Lineage of Star as well as many experts of the powerhouses in the Sanctuary Alliance who had once suffered losses in the hands of the Soaring Heaven King Palace.

In particular, when they knew that Jian Wushuang had fought all the way to the Soaring Heaven Masnion alone and had killed four Almighties of the Soaring Heaven King Palace, all of them had been extremely shocked.

Every Almighty was a super existence. Even if it were a big powerhouse like the Soaring Heaven King Palace, they only had a total of eleven Almighties and four of them had been killed by Jian Wushuang in such a short amount of time!

Even though Jian Wushuang had no choice but to stop his massacre due to the Colored Glaze Emperor coming personally later on, he could already be considered brilliant with these accomplishments.

“Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Shi Yun, why are the three of you here?” Jian Wushuang appeared in front of everyone.

“We have come here to welcome you and the Palace Master back,” Hall Master Yuan laughed.

“Hall Master Wushuang alone has killed four Sir Gods of the Soaring Heaven King Palace and his power can match the power of the Soaring Heaven King Palace. Hehe, impressive!” Hall Master Shi Yun gasped in admiration.

“Hall Master Wushuang, you are really admirable,” Hall Master Gu Xin looked over.

“Please stop mocking me,” Jian Wushuang laughed indifferently.

“Alright, let’s continue talking in the cave,” the Star Palace Master who was by the side said.

Hall Master Yuan and his group of people nodded their heads. After that, everyone headed inside the Milky Way.

Within the extremely exquisite and spacious cave, the Star Palace was sitting at the highest point. As for the four Hall Masters, which included Jian Wushuang below, they were sitting around randomly.

“Jian Wushuang, this time around, you have killed four Almighties of the Soaring Heaven King Palace and you can be said to have inflicted heavy losses on them. Although the Soaring Heaven King Palace is unable to do anything against you for now and they can only request the Colored Glaze Emperor to come personally to get you to stop, you cannot underestimate the Soaring Heaven King Palace just because of this,” the Star Palace Master looked at Jian Wushuang.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head and said: “Currently, Emperor God Tian Xiao is the strongest person in the Soaring Heaven King Palace. This Emperor God Tian Xiao is considered nothing. The real person that the Soaring Heaven King Palace relies on should be Emperor God Tian Ling.”

“It’s good that you know.” The Star Palace Master nodded his head, “Emperor God Tian Ling is ranked twenty-second on the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list. I have fought with him before and his abilities are indeed considerably stronger than mine. Moreover, I have obtained information that this Emperor God Tian Ling seemed to have found some opportunities in the Second Lair over the past few years. Hence, his abilities might have risen. If he were to come out from the Second Lair in the future, there is a very high possibility of him coming to find you. As such, you had better take some precautions as well.”

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head again.

He was not concerned about Emperor God Tian Xiao. However, Emperor God Tian Ling indeed had the right to attract his attention.

“In addition, I have a matter that I need all of you to know.” The Star Palace Master’s expression turned grave abruptly, “I have just gotten a piece of news from the Sanctuary Alliance. In ten years, the Ancient Mystery Land will open.”

“Ancient Mystery Land?” Hall Master Yuan, Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Shi Yun were all shocked.

Only Jian Wushuang did not understand why it was so shocking.

He had never heard of the Ancient Mystery Land. However, since the word “Ancient” was mentioned, it was definitely related to the Ancient Past.

“The Ancient Past is the most powerful and prosperous era of this universe. There were countless experts. During that era, even Great Emperors were considered nothing. However, for whatever reason, a great battle burst forth in the Ancient Past and this caused the whole era to collapse completely. Moreover, even many territories of the Ancient Past were completely reduced to a battlefield!”

“These ancient battlefields contain many secrets and opportunities of the Ancient Past. As such, to cultivators of the Second Era like us, they are extremely attractive.”

“In the Eternal Chaotic World, there are quite a number of known ancient battlefields. The Second Lair to Eighth Lair are probably territories from the Ancient Past that have been destroyed. For example, the Buddhist Demon Sea in the Sixth Lair has been said to come about due to an ancient battlefield collapsing,” the Star Palace Master’s voice reverberated within the cave.

Upon hearing the Buddhist Demon Sea, Jian Wushuang could not help but recall the two shocking experts who were hidden in the deepest part of the Buddhist Demon Sea.

To Jian Wushuang, those two experts were so powerful that it was earth-shaking. Even if there were a Great Emperor expert, he would be considered nothing in front of them.

As for the One-Star Man who was one of the two experts, he had rescued him and given him an opportunity.

At that time, from what the Star Palace Master had said, Jian Wushuang could confirm that the two experts, which was inclusive of the One-Star Man in the Buddhist Demon Sea, were experts from the Ancient Past. However, they had always been in a deep sleep. They were the same as Long Qi’s Master, the Seven Star Black Sect’s super expert who had been in a deep sleep in the standalone space in the Dark Region of the Eighth Lair’s core region.
