Chapter 2999: ‘God-Burning’ Venom

——

“How could it be so fast?”

The middle-aged man in the golden robe was shocked, but he was a rank one True Saint expert after all, so he reacted at once.

A golden light suddenly lit up. It was a long golden shuttle, cold and dazzling. It stabbed out in an instant.

Jian Wushuang also brandished his sword. At the same time, he also used the seven-star secret skill, punishment divine realm expert, and nine luminaries star armor.

The sword light was cold. It hit the golden shuttle like lightning. The terrifying power slightly changed the direction of the Golden Palace. Then, the cold sword light continued to slash at the divine body of the golden-robed middle-aged man.

“How could it be?”

The golden-robed middle-aged man turned pale with fright.

He had determined that Jian Wushuang had at least the battle strength of a rank two True Saint. Otherwise, he would not have been able to defeat him so easily.

“Humph, I have a protective armor at the level of a holy treasure, and my protective skills are not weak. Your sword attack can at most severely injure my divine body. It’s impossible for you to destroy my divine body directly,” the golden-robed middle-aged man said coldly.

Swoosh!

The saber light finally slashed on the golden-robed middle-aged man’s divine body.

The golden-robed middle-aged man was about to smile, but his expression suddenly froze.

Because he had already seen that when the cold sword light touched the protective armor on his body, the protective armor at the level of a sacred treasure was torn apart at the first moment, and that sword light actually entered his god body through that crack.

Rumble…

The golden-robed middle-aged man did not have any room to struggle. His divine body immediately collapsed.

However, as a True Saint, as long as he had enough divine power, his divine body could continue to regenerate.

The golden-robed middle-aged man’s divine body also started to regenerate.

“This person is so strong!”

While the golden-robed middle-aged man had a full divine body, he was also shocked.

“His speed is too fast, and his comprehension of the principles of space and time far exceeds my imagination. His combat power is also extremely strong, and he has definitely reached the level of a second level True Saint. Most importantly, the divine weapon in his hand is also very strange. That tearing and cutting ability is too strong, and even my protective armor can’t withstand it!”

“Just one sword strike has caused my divine body to collapse. This means that he only needs four sword strikes at most to kill me. I can’t tangle with him. I have to flee immediately!”

The golden-robed middle-aged man had already made up his mind.

As long as his divine body was completely reconstructed, he would immediately flee for his life.

But suddenly…

“What!”

The golden-robed middle-aged man suddenly let out a terrified voice.

He could clearly sense that while his divine body was being reconstructed, his divine power was being eroded by a terrifying force.

That’s right, it was corroding!

That force was extremely terrifying. It was unscrupulously corroding his divine power. In just an instant, 50% of his divine power had been corroded, a full 50%!

And that eroding force was still continuing.

“Poison!! It’s poison!!”

“Such a terrifying eroding force, this should be the god-burning poison!”

“No, no!”

The golden-robed middle-aged man roared crazily in the palace. He could feel his divine power dissipating at an unprecedented speed.

His divine body, which had almost been reassembled, suddenly collapsed and turned into divine power again.

The divine power was quickly eroded away.

Buzz! Buzz!

The entire palace finally calmed down.

Jian Wushuang stood in the middle of the palace and looked at the terrifying erosive power in front of him. His eyes focused.

“It seems that I overestimated the divine power of a rank one True Saint, so I wasted a drop of the god-burning poison,” Jian Wushuang thought.

The god-burning poison… Jian Wushuang went to Treasure Pavilion to exchange for it after he received the mission. He knew that the mission was to kill 12 True Saint experts. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

In the Divine Beginning World, it was very difficult to kill a True Saint with an immortal body. After all, as long as the immortal body had enough divine power, it could be regenerated continuously, even for an ordinary Immortal Saint, could reassemble his divine body four or five times.

This also meant that he had to kill four or five times before he could truly kill a True Saint.

This was too troublesome for many cultivators.

Thus, the experts of the absolute beginning divine realm had come up with many methods and things to kill those True Saints more conveniently.

The simplest and most direct method was to kill the soul.

To directly use the soul attack to kill the soul, once and for all, the divine body could not be reassembled many times.

However, the experts who were good at soul attacks were only a minority in the Divine Beginning World. There were not many of them, and this kind of method was rarely seen.

And besides soul attacks, the cultivators of the Divine Beginning World also thought of a method that could save a lot of energy to directly kill True Saints.

That was to use poison!

The Divine Beginning Realm had countless kinds of poisonous liquids. Most of these poisonous liquids had a terrifying erosive effect on divine power. As long as the poisonous liquids entered the opponent’s body, they could corrode the opponent’s divine power in the shortest time possible, naturally, the opponent would not be able to reassemble his divine body.

This method was also accepted and favored by many cultivators.

There were many kinds of poisons in the Divine Beginning World that could greatly erode divine power, and many of them were famous.

For example, the god-burning poison that Jian Wushuang took out was one of the most terrifying poisons.

The god-burning poison had to be exchanged for 300,000 sacred elixirs per drop, even for a heaven-grade member. Under normal circumstances, one drop of god-burning poison was enough to erode half of a first rank True Saint’s divine power.

Before Jian Wushuang came to complete this mission, he had exchanged 15 million sacred elixirs for 50 drops of god-burning poison so that he could kill the 12 True Saints on the list.

Just now, when he attacked the golden-robed middle-aged man, he had smeared three drops of god-burning poison on his Blood Mountain Sword. After the sword blade cut through the golden-robed middle-aged man’s protective armor, the god-burning poison entered the golden-robed middle-aged man’s body along the tip of the sword. The effects of the three drops of god-burning poison were fully activated.

The golden-robed middle-aged man did not have time to regenerate his divine body. His divine power had been completely eroded by the god-burning poison. Naturally, he died without any room for struggle.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang had obviously used one more drop.

“Now it seems that I only need two drops of god-burning poison for an ordinary rank one True Saint. I might need three drops at the peak of rank one. As for a rank two True Saint, I think I can only use five or six drops at most. Fifty drops of god-burning poison is enough for me to kill all twelve True Saints!” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.
