Chapter 2742: The Most Well-Hidden Person

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique!!” Jian Wushuang mumbled softly.

The vast Space-time Law immediately started moving as he finished speaking.

The Devilish Wind King originally had been escaping at a fast speed but his surrounding space-time had completely stopped at that moment—unable to even put up a struggle.

The Devilish Wind King held hints of horror in his eyes as his body had completely paused in the void—incapable of any movements.

Even a High-level Grand Ultimate God would find it difficult to endure Jian Wushuang’s ‘A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique’ with his current strength and understanding of Space-time Law. Although Devilish Wind King was extremely calculative, his true strength was only a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God and unable to withstand the technique.

Jian Wushuang had floated forward and crossed paths with the Devilish Wind King’s figure within the blink of an eye the moment Devilish Wind King was in the course of entering a stagnant state.

Jian Wushuang was holding the sword with one of his hands as blood started dripping from the Blood Mountain Sword.

The space-time Devilish Wind King located had recovered. However, his eyes were widened with horror and unwillingness as he stared at Jian Wushuang.

He could not believe what had happened even till the moment he died. He had calculated everything including letting Saber Master kill Hong Chen and Long Xianzi before forcing Saber Master into desperation. He only needed to kill Saber Master to obtain all the precious items and opportunities before leaving the secret realm.

However, he died in the hands of Su Han—a person he did not pay much attention to—in the end.

He almost killed Saber Master but died in a mere Primary-level Grand Ultimate God such as Su Han’s hands.

How could he accept such a fate?

He was reluctant to accept it.

However, his source of vitality had been cut off as it gradually dissipated until it completely disappeared.

Devilish Wind King had died on the spot!!

Hum! Hum!

Two figures suddenly paused in the dark void.

Those two figures were naturally the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet and Silver-armored Corpse Puppet.

Although those two corpse puppets were originally under Devilish Wind King’s control and stopped moving the moment Devilish Wind King was dead, they were still bound to him even though Devilish Wind King was dead. Therefore, they did not directly attack Jian Wushuang and Saber Master like what previously happened in the first cemetery.

The entire dark void entered a short period of silence.

Jian Wushuang took Devilish Wind King’s precious items and Interspatial Ring with a wave of his hand before slowly turning around and looking toward Saber Master.

Saber Master was also staring at him at that moment.

This time, four of the six Grand Ultimate Gods that entered the secret realm had fallen and only the two of them were still alive.

“Alliance Master Su Han, great means!!”

“I originally thought Devilish Wind King had deeply hidden his strength, who knew you were the one who had hidden his strength the most amongst all of them!” Saber Master had a serious look on his face as he spoke with a heavy voice.

Saber Master did not pay much attention to Jian Wushuang previously, just like Devilish Wind King. In addition, he had previously fought Jian Wushuang. Although the sword formation Jian Wushuang used was quite strong and comparable to ordinary High-level Grand Ultimate God, it could not threaten him at all.

Therefore, he did not suspect anything when Jian Wushuang chose to avoid the battle and escape to the surrounding dark void.

Who would have expected such a person to have hidden his strength so deeply?

He also saw the means Jian Wushuang used to kill Devilish Wind King just moments ago, especially the sword attack that crushed the Silver-armored Corpse Puppet head-on such that even he dared not look down upon such strength. It was obvious Jian Wushuang’s true strength was so much stronger than he previously displayed.

Apart from that, Saber Master also realized Jian Wushuang had purposely chosen to avoid the battle and escape to the dark void surrounding them.

Jian Wushuang wanted Devilish Wind King to show his trump cards as he waited for the opportunity to reap the benefits without much effort.

He grabbed the opportunity to directly kill Devilish Wind King the moment Devilish Wind King had revealed all his cards while the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet had wounded Saber Master badly—forcing Saber Master to his limits.

Nobody was controlling the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet and Silver-armored Corpse Puppet anymore with Devilish Wind King dead.

Saber Master was also badly wounded, hence the current situation was obviously within Jian Wushuang’s range of control.

“Saber Master, you’re the one with the best means as you continuously killed Hong Chen and Long Xianzi. You still managed to hold for so long after facing a Gold-armored Corpse Puppet alone. I really admire your strength. I only wonder how much strength you still have at that moment?” Jian Wushuang smiled. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Saber Master slightly narrowed his eyes.

He was initially slightly wounded from the Meteorite Bead’s impact and being crushed by the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet moments ago had worsened his injuries. He could not yield even 70 percent of his full strength at that moment.

He did not forget that Jian Wushuang had domain-related means which could also hugely suppress his strength.

He was uncertain about his capabilities to fight Jian Wushuang at that moment after considering everything.

Saber Master said in a low voice, “Alliance Master Su Han, there’s no need for us to have a life or death fight as we can discuss this in peace. Both of us had obtained a lot of benefits during this journey to the secret realm. I admit I’ve taken the Interspatial Ring Master Gu left behind, but I’m willing to take the Interspatial Ring out. We can equally divide the precious items inside including those we obtained from killing Hong Chen, Long Xianzi, and Devilish Wind King. What do you think?”

“Divide equally?” Jian Wushuang’s facial expression wavered.

He was able to see the huge concessions Saber Master had made.

Saber Master would not be so generous under normal circumstances. However, it was obvious that he greatly feared Jian Wushuang under such circumstances and had no other means apart from dividing the precious items equally with Jian Wushuang.

“What an unfortunate situation...” Jian Wushuang sighed softly.

“What’s so unfortunate?” Saber Master looked at him.

“Saber Master, it’s unfortunate because of the clan you belong to. You’re from the Crimson Stone Fort and the most crucial part is that you’re one of the faction’s leaders. In addition, you’re badly wounded at this moment, so I can’t think of an excuse not to kill you under these circumstances.” Jian Wushuang smiled softly.

Saber Master narrowed his eyes when he heard that.

Jian Wushuang’s killing intent had already risen from his body.

He was telling the truth. He would not have such strong killing intent if Saber Master was not the leader of a huge faction belonging to the Crimson Stone Fort. It was unfortunate that Saber Master a leader of those other factions in Crimson Stone Fort.

He supported Yin Su’er among Crimson Stone Fort’s seven factions.

The greatest problem Yin Su’er faced at that moment was the extremely intense internal battles in the Crimson Stone Fort. Yin Su’er had been thinking about ways to make a breakthrough and get rid of the internal strifes in the Crimson Stone Fort. However, she never managed to find such an opportunity. One of the factions in the Crimson Stone Fort could be directly dismantled with Saber Master falling there and it would stir up Crimson Stone Fort’s internal affairs. It would then be an opportunity for Yin Su’er.
