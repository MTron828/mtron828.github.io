Chapter 1104: Chaos Divine Thunder

“Jian Wushuang, I was capitalizing too much… on my seniority when I spoke earlier.”

“I’m sorry, Jian Wushuang.”

Jian Wushuang felt it extremely funny to see two men continuously apologizing to him.

He understood that the two Celestial Masters had encouraged him to return back to the Green Fire Palace earlier on because they did not know the extent of his strength. They had just spoken in a harsher tone, but they had good intentions. As such, Jian Wushuang did not take it to heart.

Furthermore, when they were being chased by the Exotic Beast, they had told him to flee when they saw him charging toward them. It proved that even though they did not welcome him, they saw him as one of their own.

“Both of you don’t have to do this,” Jian Wushuang said.

He laughed helplessly.

After exchanging a few pleasantries, Jian Wushuang began to ask the Celestial Masters about the beast. “What’s going on with that purple beast earlier on?”

The Celestial Masters exchanged glances before the old hunchback began to explain. “Two of the Daos I created have something to do with thunderbolts. When I passed by the purple mountain, I could sense something deep inside me, as if there was something within its depths. As such, I sneaked with Celestial Master Meng Long into its core to check it out.”

“Indeed, I saw a giant axe at the bottom of the mountain!”

“The axe was giving off an extremely strong aura, and electricity was flowing around it. It was definitely a very good piece of treasure, but when I decided to take it for my own, the purple beast appeared and grievously wounded me with a swipe of its palm.”

“Both of us had to put aside all thoughts about keeping the giant axe and we began to flee. The Exotic Beast, however, kept chasing after us. As for what happened next, I believe you saw it.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang asked as he nodded. Secretly, however, he began thinking.?“A magic weapon that could give off such a strong aura is most definitely not an Emperor Weapon. At the very least, it has to be a Chaos Magic Weapon. It might even be a Chaos Magic Treasure.”

Chaos Magic Weapons were much more valuable than Emperor Weapons. High-level weapons of this kind were worth even more, and if the giant axe turned out to be a Chaos Magic Treasure, it would be a weapon of the rarest kind.

Jian Wushuang could not ignore the fact that a rare treasure that was at least a Chaos Magic Weapon had been discovered.

“Celestial Master Yi, I hear that you use a giant axe as a weapon?” asked Jian Wushuang.

He had got some intel on various experts of the Green Fire Palace from Celestial Master Yu Ding long ago, and because of this, he managed to recognize the two Celestial Masters at a glance. Naturally, he also knew what sort of weapons they used.

“Right, I use a giant axe as my weapon. That one hidden underneath the purple mountain is very suitable for me,” replied Celestial Master Yi solemnly.

“Since that’s the case, we should think of a way to get it,” said Jian Wushuang cheerfully.

The Celestial Masters looked at each other. They had the same intent as Jian Wushuang, but they also felt that they were incapable of getting the giant axe.

“Jian Wushuang, do you have a way to take the axe from the purple beast?” asked Celestial Master Yi as he turned his gaze toward Jian Wushuang.

“There’s a way,” said Jian Wushuang with a faint smile. “If I didn’t guess wrongly, the beast is neither interested in the axe, nor has it been tasked to protect the weapon. If not, it would not have chased after you two for such a great distance.”

The Celestial Masters nodded profusely, evidently agreeing with Jian Wushuang’s statement.

“If that’s the case, things will be much easier.?I’ll distract the beast and lure it away, while you two take the opportunity to sneak the giant axe out,” said Jian Wushuang mirthfully.

“The plan is easy to execute, but our main concern is still the purple beast’s strength. Jian Wushuang, can you escape in one piece if you try to distract its attention?” asked Celestial Master Yi with a frown.

“I can,” replied Jian Wushuang confidently. “Didn’t I escape in one piece just now?”

The Celestial Masters believed him upon seeing how confident he was.

“Since that’s the case, we’ll be relying on you, Jian Wushuang. We’ll discuss how to share the axe after we’ve succeeded,” Celestial Master Yi said.

“Fine,” said Celestial Master Meng Long as he nodded solemnly.

“No problem,” said Jian Wushuang, before laughing carefreely, as if he did not care who the axe landed with.

Soon, Jian Wushuang moved out. He retraced his steps back to the mountain made up of purple gems and then headed directly underground.

He arrived at the bottom of the mountain and saw the huge axe not long after.

“That’s the axe?” asked Jian Wushuang as he became aware of and began to perceive the weapon’s presence. The aura emanating from the axe made him a little surprised.

“From the aura it’s giving off, it should be a Chaos Magic Treasure, but somehow it’s incomplete. If I didn’t guess wrongly, this giant axe should be damaged,” Gu King’s voice rang out.

“A broken piece of Chaos Magic Treasure?” said Jian Wushuang, momentarily stunned.

Jian Wushuang himself possessed a damaged Chaos Divine Treasure—the Mountain River Map. He knew that the damage would devalue the item considerably, but even so, it was still more valuable than ordinary Chaos Magic Weapons.

“Um, this is…” Gu King suddenly grew curious.

“What’s wrong,” Jian Wushuang asked multiple times.

“You’re in luck, Jian Wushuang,” replied Gu King, laughing.

“What do you mean?” asked Jian Wushuang, bewildered.

“There’s no question that the giant axe is indeed a damaged Chaos Magic Treasure, and that the axe is of little use to you—a sword user. There’s Chaos Divine Thunder hidden within it, however, and that’ll come in handy for you,” said Gu King.

“Chaos Divine Thunder?” asked Jian Wushuang, a little stunned.

“It’s extremely powerful and rarely seen even in the Eternal Chaotic World. My guess is that the axe’s owner was extremely strong when he or she was alive, and skilled in Thunderbolt Dao. It’s probably the reason why he hid Chaos the Divine Thunder in his weapon—most likely, he wanted to surprise his enemy,” replied Gu King.

“Jian Wushuang, didn’t you use to practice the Divine Yin Thunder on Star Island?” asked Gu King.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang replied as he nodded subconsciously.

He had mastered the Secret Skill on Star Island, and it was a rather powerful technique. When he was still weak, the technique helped him in many ways, but after his strength grew, he seldom used it anymore, especially now that his battle strength was already on par with an advanced Celestial Master.

After all, if he still wanted to improve on the technique, he had to acquire plenty of power from thunderbolts. As such, he had no way of improving on it while in the Green Fire World.

“Now that Gu King brought the technique up…”?Jian Wushuang thought.

“Gu King, are you trying to suggest that the Chaos Divine Thunder can help improve my Divine Yin Thunder Secret Skill?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“Of course,” replied Gu King cheerfully. “The Chaos Divine Thunder is high-level stuff. Just a thunderbolt could help your Divine Yin Thunder Secret Skill break through into Level Three. When that happens, your overall strength will definitely have improved greatly.”
