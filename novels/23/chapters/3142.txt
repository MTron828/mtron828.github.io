Chapter 3143: The Voodoo World

——

Boom!

Dao Dragon and the mind witch fought again. For a moment, the heaven and earth shook.

Jian Wushuang stood at the edge of the battlefield and felt the terrifying booms coming from the center of the battlefield, but his eyes flashed with a trace of heat.

“Rank seven True Saint…I want to see how strong he is!”

Jian Wushuang smiled with bloodlust. Rumble! Endless power of ice and fire filled the sky and rushed toward the heart shaman like a raging wave.

Under the pressure of the ice and fire realm, even the heart shaman was shocked.

“This realm is so strong?” The heart shaman was surprised.

He had noticed that Jian Wushuang had killed Long Lu and the others. The Ice and fire realm was a great contribution to Jian Wushuang’s ability to kill them so easily, at that time, the mind witch thought that the power of this realm should be extraordinary. However, he did not expect that he, a rank seven advanced True Saint, would be suppressed by this realm.

His strength was also suppressed by nearly 20% by this realm.

“Before, it was a magic array that sealed the surrounding void. I couldn’t even move it with my full strength. But now, the realm-type treasure is obviously of a terrifying level. What is the origin of this kid? How could he have so many treasures?” The mind witch exclaimed.

While the ice and fire domain was suppressing the heart witch, Jian Wushuang also moved.

He was only a rank four True Saint, but at this moment, he had directly entered the battlefield of the heart witch and Dao Dragon, the two rank seven True Saints. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Kill!”

With a loud roar, Jian Wushuang controlled the reincarnation sword formation. The faint light surrounded by a giant dragon pierced through the void and appeared beside the heart witch.

A shrill sound of wind breaking was heard. The heart witch waved her sleeve.

A pitch-black spear condensed in the void beside her, and in the blink of an eye, it collided with the faint light surrounded by the giant dragon.

Bang!

A low sound of collision was heard, and the faint light was immediately sent flying. However, the heart witch frowned slightly.

She finally understood why Jian Wushuang could easily kill the several True Saints at the peak of rank six. Indeed, the power of his sword formation was very impressive. It was almost comparable to the attack of a primary rank seven True Saint.

Boom!

A terrifying wind-breaking sound was heard. Dao Dragon slashed with one hand, and a huge crack was torn open in the center of the endless black fog. Then, a huge fist appeared in front of Xin Wu again.

Xin Wu’s face was gloomy.

He was not Dao Dragon’s match. Under the suppression of the ice and fire realm, he could only exert 80% of his strength, so he was at a disadvantage.

Jian Wushuang was still controlling the sword formation to attack him from time to time, which made the situation become one-sided.

In just a few moves, Xin Wu’s divine body had suffered a lot of damage and consumed a lot of divine power.

“If this continues, I’m afraid I’ll really die here today.” Xin Wu’s eyes were cold, but his body suddenly burst out with shocking killing intent.

This shocking killing intent completely locked onto Jian Wushuang.

“It’s all because of this kid. As long as I kill him, without the surrounding barriers, no matter how strong Dao Dragon is, he can’t do anything to me. Moreover, he killed my disciple…”

“He must die!”

Xin Wu’s eyes were red, and the monstrous black fog on his body burst out again.

“Secret technique, voodoo world!”

Boom!

The endless black fog completely exploded.

This black fog was the voodoo poison from the heart shaman’s body, and this voodoo poison was extremely strong. If an ordinary true saint touched it, their divine power would be instantly eroded away! Now that the heart shaman had completely exploded, the black fog became several times denser!

The fog that had completely turned pitch-black surged wildly, and in the blink of an eye, it actually formed a huge sea of black fog. This sea of black fog was still wildly sweeping in all directions, it was as if it wanted to completely cover the entire world around it.

The voodoo world!

The heart shaman’s greatest trump card was also his strongest move.

He had always been skilled in using voodoo. For example, he had previously refined a god Punisher nail for his disciple Chu Yixiao, and that god punisher nail was refined from his voodoo.

And now, he had perfectly displayed the voodoo poison that he controlled to the extreme.

This move consumed an enormous amount of his divine power, but its power was extremely terrifying.

The majestic voodoo world covered the entire void. Anyone who fell into this voodoo world would immediately be eroded by the voodoo world. There was no way to avoid it, and they could only rely on their divine power to resist.

Dao Dragon was powerful. Even if he was covered by the voodoo world, he could still resist the corrosion of the voodoo world with his own divine power. He was only affected to a certain extent in the voodoo world.

As for Jian Wushuang, the moment the voodoo world swept out, he did not have much time to react. He was instantly enveloped by the sea of fog.

“The voodoo world is the most powerful secret skill I’ve ever obtained in a secret realm. Any ordinary rank seven True Saint who falls into my voodoo world will be killed after a long time. Although this kid’s battle strength is comparable to an ordinary rank seven True Saint, he is only a rank four True Saint. He won’t be able to last long in my voodoo world. At most, he will die in three breaths!” The heart witch’s eyes were cold.

He was very confident in his voodoo world.

Jian Wushuang, a rank four True Saint, was trapped in the voodoo world. If he did not escape in time, he would definitely die.

However, Jian Wushuang, who was trapped in the voodoo world, did not have any intention of escaping. He still controlled the reincarnation sword formation and continued to attack the heart witch with Dao Dragon.

“You’re courting death!” Xin Wu sneered.

While he was trying his best to resist Dao Dragon’s attack, he was also waiting for Jian Wushuang’s death.

However, after three breaths and four breaths, ten breaths had passed. Jian Wushuang was still intact in the voodoo world as if he was not affected at all.

On the contrary, because he was using the voodoo world with all his strength, his divine power was greatly consumed. In addition to resisting Dao Dragon’s and Jian Wushuang’s attacks, his divine body was constantly damaged and needed divine power to recover. Until now…he had used up more than half of his divine power.

“How is this possible? It has been ten breaths. How is it possible that this kid is still alive?” Xin Wu looked incredulous.

He thought that as long as he killed Jian Wushuang, he would be able to leave safely.

However, he did not expect that he could not kill Jian Wushuang even though he had used the voodoo world, his most powerful skill.

How could he, a rank four True Saint, resist the crazy erosion of the voodoo world?
