Chapter 999: Mr Jin Yu

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“A friendly duel?” Jian Wushuang was surprised at the proposal at first, but he then felt overjoyed.

Although the Dragon Wing Governor had just become a Rank Three Dao Master, his strength was no better than that of Jian Wushuang.

With the Ancient God Power that he possessed and the Blood-killing Plate Armor he wore, Jian Wushuang could easily defeat the Governor in a duel. However, the Governor’s attainments in Sword Principles far outmatched his.

As a Rank Three Dao Master, the Dragon Wing Governor would presumably have created three Sword Principles of his own. It would be an extremely instructive experience for Jian Wushuang to be dueling against the Governor.

“We will both use only the powers of the Eternal Realm. Shall we begin?” The Dragon Wing Governor smiled at him, like how an elder would when providing guidance and advice to a junior.

The Dragon Wing Governor had viewed Jian Wushuang’s gift of the Dragon Heart Elixir to him as a most priceless favor. He had not been idle when Jian Wushuang was busy with his training in the Star-river Secret Skill for he was also deep in training himself. With the aid of the Dragon Heart Elixir, he was able to invoke the Bloodline Power within him, allowing him to complete the training of his Secret Skill. His strength, too, has grown extensively.

This made the Governor felt guilty. In return for the Elixir, Jian Wushuang had only asked to be introduced to a Golden-clothed Deacon. Noticing that Jian Wushuang was practicing his skills, the Governor saw an opportunity where he could recompense Jian Wushuang by giving him some advice.

So began their duel.

Both of them deliberately restrained their powers, keeping below the Eternal Realm for it was a contest purely of swordsmanship, not strength.

When the duel first began, the Dragon Wing Governor did not perform any of his own Sword Principles. Soon after, he began to realize that Jian Wushuang’s mastery of swordsmanship was far beyond his expectations. Jian Wushuang’s sword danced with flourishes of smooth and refined strokes that he could hardly subdue. Slowly and steadily, Jian Wushuang was gaining the upper hand.

With hardly any choice, the Governor could only cast one of his own Sword Principles, regaining the leverage of the duel over Jian Wushuang.

With that, the duel came to a swift end.

“The gap between one who has created his own Sword Principle and one who has not is most expectedly huge.”?

Jian Wushuang thought quietly to himself.

“How do you feel, Jian Wushuang?” The Dragon Wing Governor looked at him and spoke, “The Sword Principle I have used just now was the weakest of the three Sword Principles I have forged myself. The other two are Principles of the Universe Level. I am afraid you would have lost even swifter if I were to have used the other two Principles!”

“Indeed, Sir.” Jian Wushuang nodded in agreement.

Sword Principles of the Universe Level were too powerful than that of the General Level.

“We still have three years together. Please do not hesitate to speak with me if you have any doubts about your training. I shall hope to be of service to you.” The Dragon Wing Governor remarked with a benign smile.

The Governor was in good spirits due to the surge in his strength because of his success in mastering his Secret Skill.

“Thank you so much, Governor.” Jian Wushuang replied happily, surprised and grateful at his offer.

“Right, then. You’d better concentrate on your training. I hope you will be able to create your own Sword Principle soon and become a Dao Master as soon as possible.” The Dragon Wing Governor said. He then took his leave and left Jian Wushuang alone.

Jian Wushuang fell into silence as he watched the Governor leaving. The Gu King’s voice rose suddenly, speaking strangely to him.?“I believe the Dragon Wing Governor hopes to compensate you for the Dragon Heart Elixir by giving you some advice. It seems that he is not aware that you are, in fact, more powerful than he is.”

“Well…”?Jian Wushuang smiled weakly.?“He is nevertheless a more proficient Sword Cultivator who had forged three Sword Principles of his own. He is doubtlessly qualified in instructing me in the mastery of Sword Principles.”

“Hmph! Those are nothing to be proud of. What he possessed are merely two Universe-leveled Sword Principles and one General-leveled Sword Principle!”?The Gu King snorted dismissively.

Without any desire to continue their debate, Jian Wushuang continued with his study of Sword Principles. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

He began spending the most of his time in the Governor Mansion, studying about Sword Principles tirelessly.

Devoting most of his time in the research of forging the Strongest Sword Principle and the study of the scroll containing 19 Sword Principles, Jian Wushuang used the rest of his time putting swordsmanships to practice, going to the Governor for counsel and advice in the case of doubts.

The Governor was only too happy to oblige, pleased that he was able to return the favor to Jian Wushuang as he tried the best he could to provide answers and instructions to the latter.

Time passed swiftly as three years elapsed in a flash.

Jian Wushuang had made good progress on his mastery of swordsmanship. With a far deeper understanding of the finesse and skills of the sword, he knew that he would soon be able to forge his own Sword Principle.

Jian Wushuang was in a courtyard when the Dragon Wing Governor approached him.

“I have just received word that the Golden-clothed Deacon has returned, Jian Wushuang. It is time for us to go to him,” said the Dragon Wing Governor.

The two had grown close since Jian Wushuang began staying at the Governor Mansion and going to him for advice on Sword Principle.

The Governor no longer addressed Jian Wushuang with ceremony, instead, he now called his name with blunt frankness.

“Let’s set off at once then.” Jian Wushuang could not wait any longer.

“You will stay and wait for our return, Qing Bin.”

Jian Wushuang left Qing Bin his instruction and departed for the residence of the Golden-clothed Deacon with the Dragon Wing Governor.

The abode of the Golden-clothed Deacon was some distance away from the Dragon Wing City. It was almost a month’s time of travel until Jian Wushuang and the Governor completed their journey.

“Look, that is the castle where the Gold-clothed Deacon lives,” said the Dragon Wing Governor.

Jian Wushuang looked far into the distance and saw a vague black mass looming through the diaphanous mist that clung to the huge castle walls.

“So… a Golden-clothed Deacon lives there?”?Jian Wushuang thought. The spectacle of the scene sent a jolt of adrenaline through his veins as he clenched his fists tightly in anticipation.

“Let’s go,” said the Governor. Pulling Jian Wushuang with him, they rose into the air, stopping before the castle in mid-air.

They had barely stopped when they saw a flash of Flowing Light dashed out of the castle.

“It has been a long time since we last met, Dragon Wing Governor.”

It was an elder robed in gray. The aged man regarded the Governor with respect and modesty.

“I would like to request that you pass a message for me, Dao Master Ye. Please send word to your Master that it is I, with the company of a young friend, who is here to request an audience with him.” The Dragon Wing Governor asked smilingly.

“One moment, please. I will announce your arrival at once.” The grey-robed elder immediately relayed a message. The answer came swiftly enough.

“If you would please follow me, Dragon Wing Governor.”

The grey-robed elder immediately led Jian Wushuang and the Dragon Wing Governor into the castle.

They stepped into a richly adorned hall inside the castle and found a handsome man dressed in loose flowing robes of golden silk overlooking their arrival from the mezzanine of the handsomely furnished chamber.

“My respects to Mr Jin Yu, I am the Dragon Wing Governor.” The Dragon Wing Governor introduced himself humbly.

Beside him, Jian Wushuang paid his respects too by clasping his hands together in salute.

Noticing Jian Wushuang’s muted gesture, the handsome man remarked coldly.

“I see your companion is a prideful person, Dragon Wing Governor!”
