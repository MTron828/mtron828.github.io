Chapter 2129 Five Great Emperors

The Heaven Repairing Palace did wonders.The reason why the Sanctuary Palace had paid such a high price to activate it was to create as many Great Emperors as possible. They had estimated only three Great Emperors would emerge, four if they were lucky.

But now…

Three Great Emperors came out from the remaining nine people, adding Underworld God and Emperor God Tian Ling would make a total of five!

Twelve seats, five Great Emperors. It was way beyond the Sanctuary Alliance’s expectations.

Amongst the three new Great Emperors was one Jian Wushuang recognised. It was Emperor God Liu Guang. The token for her to enter the Palace had been given to her personally by Jian Wushuang. She indeed had not disappointed him, having ascended to Great Emperor levels herself.

Another person who had fought for the seat, Emperor God Jue Xian, was not so lucky. Or perhaps it was due to his lack of ability. Even though he had managed to secure a seat with his Soul Attack secret skill Three Divine Lights, he was not able to reach Great Emperor levels within the month.

Jian Wushuang took a glance at him, and realised he had accepted that fact relatively calmly.

Emperor God Jue Xian had no regrets – he had tried his best. This trip was not completely futile either.

“Qian Mingzi did not make it either?” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

In terms of ability, Qian Mingzi was right after Underworld God and Emperor God Tian Ling, it was a pity he could not ascend to Great Emperor levels. Luck is a pretty unpredictable thing after all.

“The activation of the Palace has given us five more Great Emperors, and taken down three of Archelon Palace’s. This has been a great blessing to us, it’s only a pity you came out earlier than expected,” Emperor Bai looked at Jian Wushuang.

The surrounding experts looked at Jian Wushuang, their gazes all conflicted. The experts from the Heaven Repairing Palace, like Emperor God Liu Guang looked towards him with gratitude.

They all knew Jian Wushuang should have had his abilities improve further in the Palace, but had to leave early to resist the Archelon Palace experts. It was due to Jian Wushuang that the rest could cultivate for a full month.

“What’s done is done. Jian Wushuang, follow me to Thunderbolt Island,” Emperor Bai said. Jian Wushuang nodded.

Both of them headed for Thunderbolt Island, while the other experts scattered.

…

In Thunderbolt Island’s great hall stood Emperor Bai, Jian Wushuang, and Ancestor Tian Chen.

“Jian Wushuang, although you only trained for half a month, you must have gained a lot, right?” Emperor Bai asked casually.

“Indeed,” Jian Wushuang nodded. “I have improved tremendously in terms of Dao understanding, and I manage to feel the Rules of Order. My only regret is not having complete mastering my secret skill, if not I would have Third Stage fighting powers by now. Of course, even without the Palace I should be able to master it on my own.”

“How long will that take?” Emperor Bai asked.

“About a decade,” Jian Wushuang replied.

He had mastered half of the Immortal Celestial Body’s second scroll. Ten years should be enough.

“A decade? How about three years? Can you do it within three?” Emperor Bai asked.

“Three years?” Jian Wushuang frowned and thought for a while. “Normally three years would be impossible, but if I had sufficient resources and treasures to supplement me, it may be possible. But may I ask, Emperor Bai, why three years?”

Jian Wushuang had questions.

The battle between the Eternal Chaotic World and Three Emperors World had not begun yet, what was the rush?

“Unless…” Jian Wushuang looked towards Emperor Bai. Emperor Bai and Ancestor Tian Chen had suspicious smiles on their faces.

Ancestor Tian Chen said, “Sword Emperor, you should know how prepared we are now. Sanctuary Alliance and Special Tribes Alliance have all made their preparations, and with the five extra Great Emperors we have now… we could fight the enemy straight on to the death if we wanted to!”

“But not them.”

Jian Wushuang understood.

“So, both of you want to make the first move?” he asked.

“Indeed,” Emperor Bai smiled. “Since the Eternal Chaotic World is ready, there’s no need to drag this out, we should strike while the enemy is unprepared!”

“We can no longer be on the passive side. From the Dark Millstone, to what happened at the Special Tribes Alliance, to the Heaven Repairing Palace attack. We have been reacting to their attacks this entire time, but not once were we on the offensive.”

“Even counting the last time you and three other experts snuck into Three Emperors World to destroy the Supreme Emperor Stone… that too was reactionary.”

“But now it is time for us to make the first move.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang nodded.

“May I know, Emperor Bai, Ancestor Tian Chen, about your plans?” he asked.

He knew if they were to tell him this, they would have drawn out a plan by now.

“We have one plan, and it’s quite simple. It’ll be the same as the last time, send a small team of experts to infiltrate and damage the Three Emperors World,” Emperor Bai said.

“What? There again?” Jian Wushuang’s face changed. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The Three Emperors World was the enemy’s base. To send a small team to infiltrate that place would be immensely dangerous.
