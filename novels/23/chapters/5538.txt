Chapter 5538 ¬†The Requirements for Supreme-Peak

Unable to be restrained, even though the Heavenly Realm was relatively stable and rarely saw the emergence of major villains among the Emperors, there were still some who dared to try.

Just like those wandering cultivators at the bottom, unable to progress in cultivation, lacking potential, and without powerful backers, they could only choose the path of blood, as it offered a quicker path to advancement.

The temptation was hard to resist, except for those with exceptional talent and a good background.

"Sigh!" Jian Wushuang sighed.

According to the plan, he was supposed to ride Qingniao Hall to Qinghe Niuzhou.

Now, it seemed that the plan couldn't keep up with the changes.

If he had known earlier, he would have dealt with these two individuals in advance.

The Great Dao was arduous, and no one had an easy journey. He wouldn't show mercy.

Whose path was easy? None.

Regardless of right or wrong, he only saw the essence.

There was no absolute right or wrong, just excuses each created for themselves.

The withered old man regained a hint of color and did not rush to deal with those wandering cultivators.

The difference in strength was too great; they posed no threat to him, so there was no need to be in a hurry.

His target was the cornered Gong Miaoyi.

"Young lady!" The withered old man squinted his eyes, his voice soft, but the gleam in his eyes was full of killing intent.

Gong Miaoyi did not resist but instead glanced at Jian Wushuang. Finnd ùíèew chapters on nùíêve/lbiùíè(.)com

"Get ready to act; this is the Deep Wilderness, and the Elder Palace's reach can't extend this far!" Jian Wushuang calmly transmitted his voice.

Once these people were dealt with, he could easily change his identity and fly over.

Alternatively, he could continue to use Qingniao Hall as cover, but these wandering Dao Lords couldn't be left alive.

"Young lady, prepare to sacrifice yourself for your master!" The withered old man took out a scepter, raising it high with both hands, seemingly performing some kind of ritual!

Gong Miaoyi, though approaching with lifeless eyes, had a mind as clear as a mirror.

Killing these people was too easy, but to avoid exposing themselves, it was best to conceal their methods and use other powers to eliminate them.

For example, relying solely on the physical body!

As Gong Miaoyi walked slowly towards the withered old man, everyone held their breath.

If there was any doubt before, now it was certain‚Äîthese two were undoubtedly demonic path Emperors.

They were truly in trouble!

Hall Master Qingniao knelt on the side, cold sweat already seeping from his forehead. He was unwilling to perish like this.

Just as the withered old man performed the ceremony, a thread of thought quietly slipped out from the Hall Master's mind.

He intended to sacrifice a trace of his Origin Source, abandoning his flesh and escaping with his divine body.

Even if he died in the Deep Wilderness, he didn't want to be ravaged to death by demonic Emperors.

Whew!

The thread of Thought power was very weak. A typical Emperor might not have noticed it, but Emperor Jiu Tong, a peak-level tier 3 existence, detected it as soon as Qingniao released it.

"Tsk tsk, Brother Qingniao, you are not honest at all!" As Emperor Jiu Tong spoke, a faint light shone on his jet-black fingertips, piercing through the Hall Master's Origin Source.

Instantly, he perished.

The thread of Thought power that had extended from Qingniao's mind also dissipated.

The wandering cultivators were already in despair. Initially thinking about putting up a fight, they now had no chance at all. Dealing with them was too easy.

Emperor Jiu Tong looked at the desperate cultivators with a playful smile, revealing a scornful expression.

However, at this moment, his master's eyes suddenly contracted, and a gush of hot blood sprayed from his mouth.

Black blood flowed down from the corners of his mouth, his voice hoarse, "You!"

With a stiff arm pointing at Gong Miaoyi, he then crashed to the ground.

This time, it was the turn of Emperor Jiu Tong to feel despair.

He hadn't reacted yet; he just turned his head to see that his master had already perished.

Then, he saw a wandering cultivator whom he had never looked at directly before, standing beside his master's corpse, hands covered in blood.

Splash!

Jiu Tong was so frightened that he immediately knelt down and begged for mercy, saying, "Senior, spare me! It was his threat that forced me to do this. It has nothing to do with me!"

This is how cultivators of the demonic path are‚Äîthey care about nothing when it comes to saving their own lives.

Just after the sect master was killed, Jiu Tong immediately switched sides.

At this moment, the wandering cultivators also realized what was happening and began to retreat one after another!

Everything was so spectacular, with one wave subsiding only for another to rise again.

This time, they truly understood the saying: If you don't suffer losses, you won't learn.

Several Emperors who had been in hiding successively appeared.

And by now, two Emperors had already fallen.

Where to look with such a scene?

Even if they fell this time, it was worth it.

"Annihilate!" Jian Wushuang just said one word, as if his words were commands. Jiu Tong's body began to dissipate, then turned into a phantom.

Jiu Tong watched helplessly as his physical body shattered, followed by the rupture of his divine body and the depletion of his Origin Source.

Before his fall, he finally understood the strength of the opponent he had just faced.

It was a legendary peak-level Emperor.

Although it was a miscalculation, Jian Wushuang's Life power was indeed comparable to the means of those supreme-peak existences in killing Emperors of this level.

But if it came to dealing with supreme-peak existences, his means would be somewhat inadequate.

The power of supreme-peak Emperors was terrifying. Even with a special Life power, it was impossible to fight against them across tiers.

Moreover, the strength of supreme-peak emperors was not just about power; it also involved a profound understanding of space, far surpassing ordinary Emperors.

When an Emperor's cultivation reached the black hole realm, he would be tier 6. To advance to the supreme-peak realm, a tier 6 Emperor needed to elevate their understanding of space to the level of the universe.

Alternatively, they could create their own universe secret technique.

Achieving either of these could lead to reaching the supreme-peak realm.

As for the indigenous Emperors of the Four Great Secret Realms, their Origin Sources had defects, making their spatial Origin Source weak.

It was challenging for them to reach the cosmic or universe realm.

Therefore, most of the supreme-peak existences in the Four Great Secret Realms had to create cosmic secret techniques.

The realm of the spatial Origin Source remained at the level of black holes.

Even attempting to elevate it to the peak was incredibly difficult.

For these Inheritors, their Origin Sources were born from the Original Universe, complete regardless of strength.

However, even with this advantage, elevating the spatial realm to the level of cosmic space was still a formidable task.

In terms of cultivation time, compared to the Emperors of the Four Great Secret Realms, they were at a disadvantage. Hence, there were very few supreme-peak experts.

To the extent that the Original Universe had no supreme-peak experts, not even a tier 6 Emperor. In the river of time and space, tier 6 Emperors were rare, with most being tier 5 Emperors.

The emergence of the Qishen Temple was the reason for the sudden appearance of so many strong individuals.

However, as time passed, even without the Qishen Temple, numerous powerful individuals would still emerge. The arrival of the Qishen Temple merely accelerated the progress of this river of time and space.

Take Shang, for example. Before entering the Qishen Temple, he had already elevated his spatial realm to the cosmic level and even created the embryonic form of cosmic secret techniques.

Crossing into the tier 6 was easy for him, and he could quickly join the ranks of supreme-peak experts.

However, lacking guidance, he took some detours. With the personal guidance of Zhen Ling later on, the cosmic secret techniques flourished, and the cosmic space was perfected. All that was left for him was to challenge the barrier to break into the realm of the Universe Master.
