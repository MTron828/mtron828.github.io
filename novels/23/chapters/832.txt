Chapter 833: The Duel!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

This was the kind of army the Royal Guard was!

Even the captain of a 10-soldier squad was an Eternal Realm expert.

The captains of the 100-soldier squads had to be Step Three or Four Eternal Realm experts.

As for the captains of the 1000-soldier squads, it was said that the weakest ones were the top Step Five Eternal Realm and even Step Six Eternal Realm experts.

The Royal Guard was indeed full of experts.

Even if Jian Wushuang showed all his power, he would barely be able to be captain of a 1000-soldier squad. And in higher rankings, there were many people in charge of tens of thousands of soldiers, such as commanders.

“Hey guys, from this moment on, we’re one team. How about we introduce ourselves to each other first?” a triangular-eyed old soldier said with a smile.

“Introduce ourselves? How?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“By using our power, of course.” The man sneered and continued, “It’s been just the two of us and the captain for several years. Now, you guys have finally joined us. How can we not communicate closely with you?”

Jian Wushuang and the other new recruits felt excited.

Some of them looked full of expectation.

As new recruits, they were looking forward to exchanging moves with the experienced older soldiers.

“Don’t get too excited. It won’t be just a casual battle. We need to make a wager first,” the man continued.

“The duel starts.”?Ouyang Xu raised his eyebrows.

“Wager? Duel?”?

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly.

“Come on, one by one, each of you has to have at least one fight with us,” the man continued with a sneer. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The new recruits looked at each other with a frown.

One of them walked forward and asked the man, “How much you wanna bet?”

“Not much, just 200,000 Divine Gems,” he answered casually.

“What?!” The new recruit was startled.

200,000 Divine Gems?

Normally, a superior Divine Realm expert’s total assets were only about 100,000 Divine Gems. The amount he wanted was too much.

“Well, it’s only 200,000 Divine Gems, you can’t afford it?” the man asked, staring at the recruit.

“Of course, I can, but…” the recruit muttered. He hesitated.

“Well then, what are you waiting for? Come on, take them out. Considering that you are a new recruit, you can choose any one of us as your opponent, including the captain,” the triangular-eyed man said in a contemptuous manner.

The new recruit changed his expression slightly; he had spotted the man’s disdain and was enraged by it. He nodded heavily. “Then, I choose you.”

“You want to fight against me? Very good.” The man grinned. In no time, the two came to blows.

Both of them were Divine Realm experts. The new recruit had to be powerful to have been able to join the Royal Guard.

However, after they had exchanged several moves…

Clang! Clang! Clang!

A series of fierce clashes sounded. It was a close battle at first, but after several minutes, the triangular-eyed man suddenly launched a powerful attack and defeated the new recruit.

“How could this be?”

The new recruit could not believe that he had lost.

He had clearly felt that he was about to win, but then he lost.

“If I lost, I lost.”?The new recruit took out 200,000 Divine Gems, handed them to the man, and walked back to his companions bitterly.

“Haha, let’s move on. Who’s next?” The man smiled wildly.

Standing among the new recruits, Jian Wushuang secretly shook his head.

He could tell that the old soldier had deliberately hidden his power. He had restrained his power at first to relax the new soldier’s vigilance, and then suddenly launched a surprisingly powerful attack to defeat him.

“This man wants to cheat more new recruits to win their Divine Gems.

“These old soldiers were specially selected into the Royal Guard and have spent a rather long time in the army. They are much more powerful than most superior Divine Realm experts and can even battle a few top Divine Realm experts. Moreover, their magic weapons are better than others’.”?Jian Wushuang gasped secretly in admiration.

He could tell that the weapon the man used was an Eternal Weapon, which earned him a great advantage.

The man had hidden his power in order to win more Divine Gems in the following battles.

“Next.”

The triangular-eyed man let out a laugh of joy when he defeated the second challenger and won another 150,000 Divine Gems.

The duels continued.

Each of the eight new recruits had to fight with the old soldiers at least once, and they also had to offer a bet of no less than 100,000 Divine Gems.

After a few rounds, the triangular-eyed man had won nearly a million Divine Gems.

Jian Wushuang and Ouyang Xu were the only two who had not fought yet.

“Haha, who’s next? Hurry!” the old soldier urged the recruits.

Ouyang Xu walked up to him with a frown.

“Kid, how much are you going to bet?” the man asked Ouyang Xu.

“One million Divine Gems,” Ouyang Xu answered directly.

“Oh?” the triangular-eyed man was surprised.

The other new recruits stared at Ouyang Xu.

The old soldier had won six rounds. By now all the new recruits knew that he had been deliberately hiding his power.

Ouyang Xu must have known this as well, but all the same, he offered a million Divine Gems as a bet. He had to be confident about his power.

“Is this boy a top Divine Realm expert?”?The man’s face grew serious.

Every time the Royal Guard recruited new members, there were at least a few top Divine Realm experts among the recruits.

This time, among the one thousand new recruits, about a hundred of them were top Divine Realm experts. It was possible that some of them were the new members of his team.

Thinking of this, his confidence was swayed.

He turned to the man beside him with a grin. “One million Divine Gems is too much for me, I can’t afford it. Xie Zi, you’re much richer than me and can probably afford it. I’ll leave this boy to you.”
