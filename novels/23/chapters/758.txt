Chapter 759: Jian Wushuang?

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“How lucky I am! I found An Chao and another three Boundless Demon Sect experts. And just as I’m about to leave the Eternal Zone. It even saved me from thinking of how to return Gu Yang’s favor.”?Jian Wushuang smiled.

He did not like to owe others. Gu Yang had saved his life, so he wanted to do him a good return.

“An Chao!”

Killing intent flashed in his eyes—the only uncovered part of his body, as he cursed the name in secret.

“In order to kill An Chao, I have to kill Xia Yuan first.”

Jian Wushuang made up his mind.

The Bloodline Power started surging inside his body. In an instant, he had transformed into a 10 meter high Gold-armored Ancient God. His Emperor Sword also expanded to 10 meters long.

He dove forward. His aura was rising ferociously, higher and higher.

“A Gold-armored Demon God?”

Xia Yuan was startled to see the Ancient God.?“No wonder he could withstand my blow; he is a One-star Gold-armored Demon God. However, he is not enough to threaten me.”?

He sneered and charged toward Jian Wushuang, his Giant Axe in hand.

The two neared each other.

“Mind-controlling Secret Skill!”

Jian Wushuang growled and punched at Xia Yuan. He was immediately enveloped by a strange power.

Xia Yuan felt his mind struck by a sudden pain. He paused his move. A moment later, he managed to recover from the pain.

He regained his senses before Jian Wushuang could destroy him.

Jian Wushuang sighed in disappointment.?“My realm is too low. I can’t overpower an expert in Step Three of the Eternal Realm with Mind-controlling Secret Skill yet.”

His skill didn’t affect Xia Yuan at all except for slowing down him a little.

“Fine. I never expected that I could defeat him relying on this skill.”?

He displayed his best skill—Netherworld.

Xia Yuan struck out with his axe.

It then became a battle of pure power.

“Puff!”

Xia Yuan coughed out a mouthful blood, and his axe almost slipped out his hand.

“He is in Step Four!”

Xia Yuan’s eyes betrayed his horror. He wanted to retreat.?

However, Jian Wushuang did not let him leave. He came up to Xia Yuan again and launched a series of attacks.

Soon, Xia Yuan was overwhelmed by sword shadows.

Jian Wushuang went all out.

“Damn!

“Those damn moves…”

Xia Yuan cursed as he hurriedly tried to defend himself. He felt he was going to lose.

Sometime later, he finally got his golden chance to escape. He quickly displayed a Secret Skill.

However, he had only made it a hundred meters when he heard a whooshing sound from one side.

He turned his head only to see a black arrow flying toward him at an amazing speed. If he kept running forward, it would hit him.

He had to stop.

The arrow flew past him. But before he could let out a sigh of relief, Jian Wushuang had caught up with him from behind and displayed Twilight.

“No!”

Xia Yuan let out a roar of despair before Jian Wushuang’s sword went through his body, breaking his Life Core.

After killing Xia Yuan, Jian Wushuang looked toward Gu Yang and gave him a thumbs-up. The latter put down his long bow and looked back with a nod.

The arrow had contributed to Xia Yuan’s death to some extent.

It was true that Jian Wushuang was more powerful than Xia Yuan, however, Xia Yuan was faster than him. If it were not for the arrow blocking him temporarily, Jian Wushuang could not have caught up with him and killed him.

The other three Boundless Demon Sect experts were panic-stricken by Xia Yuan’s death.

“Run!”

“Run as fast as you can!”

They started running in different directions.

An Chao had kept a close eye on the battle between Jian Wushuang and Xia Yuan, thus, he was the first one to sense the danger and react.

He assumed the Ancient God would chase after the other two experts, because it would be easier than catching him.

However, to his surprise, he saw the Ancient God coming after him.

“Among the four Boundless Demon Sect experts, An Chao is first place on my kill list.” Jian Wushuang’s killing intent was booming.

He had to kill this murderer to avenge Gu Qiong.

Swish! Swish!

Both Jian Wushuang and An Chao ran very fast, and soon, they were lost from sight.

“How could he be so fast?”?Looking back at Jian Wushuang, who was drawing nearer and nearer, An Chao turned pale.?“Why did he only target me?”?

Though he was puzzled, he pulled his attention back to his feet. He displayed all his skills to speed up and became visibly faster.

Jian Wushuang found he was further and further behind despite running at his full speed.

He was becoming anxious. He knew if he did not display a Secret Skill to become quicker, he would lose his target.

“This guy responded so fast. He took off the moment he saw me kill Xia Yuan, leaving me no chance to display the Mind-controlling Secret Skill.”?Jian Wushuang thought with a frown.

The skill was powerful, but it could only produce a magical effect on its target within a certain distance. An Chao had escaped far from Jian Wushuang right away; he could not attack him with it.

“It seems that I have to use another skill.”?Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

He began shrinking back into a normal human being.

With his will, his Spiritual Power began burning inside him.

He was displaying the Dragon Blood Secret Skill.

It was a skill that could increase one’s speed by consuming his Spiritual Power.

The cost of using such a skill was so great that Jian Wushuang would use it only in an emergency.

A hundred years ago when he was being pursued by An Chao, he had used this skill and managed to escape into the inner layer where he was finally saved by Gu Yang.

Now, the tables had turned.

He was pursuing An Chao.

“You can’t escape from me!”

Jian Wushuang shouted. His voice echoed throughout the place.

With the Dragon Blood Secret Skill, he could run ten times faster than before, faster than An Chao.

It appeared he would catch up with An Chao soon.

“Oh no!

“This can’t be real!”

An Chao was struck by horror as he sensed Jian Wushuang’s aura near him.

He could not help looking back and was shocked to see Jian Wushuang in human form.

“It’s, it’s…”

He stared at the man running after him with wide eyes.

Even though the man had his face covered behind a mask, he was very familiar with this man.

He recognized his Secret Skill, the long sword on his back, and even the way he moved. They were exactly the same as the man he’d met a hundred years ago.

The only difference was that, now, he was the one being hunted.

“It’s you!

“It should be you!”

An Chao murmured.

If Jian Wushuang hadn’t transformed into a Gold-armored Ancient God before, An Chao would have recognized him much earlier.

“Jian Wushuang!

“I know you’re Jian Wushuang!”

An Chao shouted back at the man running after him. There was horror and disbelief in his voice, and his words echoed throughout the void for a long time.

Jian Wushuang heard him and smirked. “So, you finally recognized me?

“You have to die all the same.”

Jian Wushuang sped up again. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Neither one noticed that there was a grey-haired elder hidden in the forest they’d just passed. He was waiting there for his injuries to recover.

However, the elder had spotted them and was amazed.

“Is that Jian Wushuang?

“The peerless genius of the Ancient Sect??

“Didn’t he die a hundred years ago?”
