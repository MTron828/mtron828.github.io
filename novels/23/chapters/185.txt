Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Hey, kid!” The fat middle-aged man shouted to Jian Wushuang, “Where are you from?”

Jian Wushuang stood in front of the fat middle-aged man indifferently, saying nothing.

“Don’t want to speak? Hum, it seems like you don’t belong anywhere.” The fat middle-aged man smiled coldly and said, “Hey, listen up. I will give you two choices. One is to let me kill you and take your Interspatial ring, and you try to perform better in your next life.”

“The other is to go back with me and meet our First Leader. First Leader may be willing to keep you there to serve him tea since your appearance is not bad. Even if he doesn’t like you, you could stay in the Purple Fire Gang and offer us massages. That would also be great!”

“Haha…” Hearing that, the bandits behind the fat middle-aged man all began to laugh.

“Kid, these are your only two choices, so pick one,” The fat middle-aged man said coldly.

“Serve tea? Offer massages?” Jian Wushuang touched his nose without saying anything. But the Long Sword behind him was already out.

CHUU!

When Jian Wushuang moved, sword lights rushed directly towards the bandits.

The bandits were immediately annoyed.

“You are courting death!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“He dares to attack us alone. He’s so uppity. Let’s kill him!”

“Kill!”

These bandits had killed many people, making them cruel and fierce. Now that they started to attack, they wouldn’t show any mercy.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold. When his figure was about to clash with the bandits, his swordsmanship burst out directly.

A cold sword shadow could be seen lighting up suddenly, then the light instantly overshadowed all the other lights in the area.

“This sword move!”

The moment Jian Wushuang’s Long Sword slashed out, the bandits’ faces turned pale, and then...

Chi!!!

The cold sword light swept through the bandits, and the Sword Edge slit their throats.

With just a single exchange, all of the bandits except the leading fat middle-aged man had died and were laying in a pool of blood.

Next, the Sword Edge of the Triple-kill Sword appeared on the fat middle-aged man’s shoulder.

“You, fat man, did you mention earlier that you wanted to teach me the ways of the world?” Jian Wushuang looked at the fat middle-aged man coldly and at the same time, he clapped his Long Sword.

Plop!

The fat middle-aged man knelt down without hesitation and begged, “Sir, I failed to recognize how powerful you are and I deserve to die. But I need to support the children and elderly in my family, may I beg for your mercy?”

Hearing that, Jian Wushuang went into a daze.

He had seen many people who were afraid of death, but he never saw anyone like this fat man.

“Sir...” The fat man was still crying with his nose running.

“Shut up,” Jian Wushunag shouted angrily.

The fat middle-aged man was frightened and dared not speak anymore, but he kept looking at Jian Wushuang pitifully.

“I will ask you something, and you need to answer truthfully,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Of course I will. No matter what you ask, I won’t hide anything. I swear! I only want to beg for your mercy,” The fat middle-aged man said.

“You mentioned the First Leader and the Purple Fire Gang just now. So you are a member of the Purple Fire Gang. What is its overall strength?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“Our overall strength?” The middle-aged man was puzzled at first, but he immediately answered the question.

“Sir, there are several hundred people in the Purple Fire Gang and many of them are in the Gold Core Realm. We have two leaders and both of them are in the Initial Yin Void Realm. In the whole Easternmost Plain, the Purple Fire Gang is a famous gang.”

“Gang?” Jian Wushuang could not help laughing as he asked, “Aren’t you just bandits?”

Hearing that, the fat middle-aged man smiled awkwardly.

“Are there any fugitives that are wanted by the surrounding Twelve Dynasties in the Purple Fire Gang?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Fugitives? Yes.” The fat middle-aged man nodded, “The Second Leader of the Purple Fire Gang is a Silver level fugitive. Other than him, we have four more who are at the level of Black Iron. It is easy to tell them apart since they are always wearing an armlet.”

“One at the Silver level and one at the Black Iron?” Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Take me to the stronghold of the Purple Fire Gang.”

“Now, with you alone?” The fat middle-aged man stared at Jian Wushuang stunningly.

“Shut up, just lead the way,” Jian Wushuang said with a serious look.

Naturally, the fat middle-aged man dared not say more and immediately led the way for Jian Wushuang.

Actually, the stronghold of the Purple Fire Gang was located on a hill in the Easternmost Plain, composed of simple houses and tents. At that moment, the stronghold of the Purple Fire Gang was very boisterous.

Many bandits were busy enjoying meat and alcohol.

Abruptly, a fat figure was thrown like a cannonball, landing on the floor and shaking the whole area.

Obviously, the fat figure was the fat middle-aged man who had been caught by Jian Wushuang.

“Fat Tang, what the hell are you doing?”

Many bandits of the Purple Fire Gang looked towards the fat middle-aged man.

The fat middle-aged man struggled to stand up, without saying anything, he looked over his shoulder.

Jian Wushuang, who only carried his Long Sword, folded his arms and slowly walked forward.

The bandits immediately looked at Jian Wushuang, including the two people at the forefront, who were the two leaders of the Purple Fire Gang. One of them was a cold man with braids, wearing an armlet with the word “Kill” written on it.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up when he saw the armlet.

“Are you the Second Leader of the Purple Fire Gang? I want the armlet on your arm.”

As his voice faded, the Triple-kill Sword behind Jian Wushuang was already out.

Hum… A horrifying sword essence instantly began radiating from him.

Without speaking any nonsense, Jian Wushuang immediately attacked the cold man with braids.

The Purple Fire Gang instantly fell into turmoil.

“A little fellow who’s only in the Profound Gold Core Realm wants to kill me?” The cold man with braids said while smiling disdainfully.

“I don’t know where this reckless and stupid guy come from, but send him away immediately,” A purple-haired old man said while frowning. The purple-haired old man was the First Leader of the Purple Fire Gang.

The two sat in front of the table and drank, paying no attention to Jian Wushuang. However, many bandits around them were preparing to fight against Jian Wushuang.

The fat middle-aged man who led the way for Jian Wushuang was stunned at this scene.

“This guy...”

“A brat who just reached the Profound Gold Core Realm actually dared to come to the stronghold of the Purple Fire Gang alone.”

“What’s more, he immediately attacked without even speaking any nonsense. Did he intend to kill our Second Leader?”

“Dared he to be cooler?”

The fat middle-aged man shouted in his heart, but a hint of astonishment instantly appeared in his eyes.
