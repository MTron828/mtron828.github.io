“This King Luo Yu is so... stupid!” Many of them thought to themselves. They thought King Luo Yu was stupid.

However, they weren’t people of Ancient God tribe. They naturally wouldn’t understand how much Ancient God tribe values bloodline.

Actually, not only Ancient God tribe but also the other three peak tribes, they valued bloodline as important too. But just not as ridiculous as Ancient God tribe.

As for Jian Wushuang, he was shocked as well.

He never thought that King Luo Yu would recognize his bloodline and immediately take him on as the new Ancient God Emperor.

“King Luo Yu, as you recognize my bloodline, who would you stand by if I wanted to protect Green Fire World?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Of course, by your side,” King Luo Yu said without hesitation. At the same time, his eyes glowed with golden lustre as he looked at everyone around. “Listen up, although Sword Emperor has yet to become Ancient God Emperor, his bloodline is right there. We Ancient God tribe has to follow his lead from today onwards. Whoever goes against Sword Emperor will be our enemy too!”

King Luo Yu was determined and firm with his decision. He didn’t leave any space for negotiation.

There were many people who creased their eyebrows at the sight.

Ancient God tribe was one of the strongest tribes among the unique tribes. It was said that there was not only a nine-star Ancient God, there were also eight-star Ancient Gods and seven-star Ancient Gods. With such powerful force, there was no one who dared to ignore them.

“Humph, so what if the Ancient God tribe is supporting you? Today, Sanctuary Alliance and many other unique tribes are here to conquer Green Fire World. With Ancient God tribe alone, you can’t stop us,” Colored Glaze Great Emperor’s cold voice reverberated in the air.

The surrounding people looked rather enthusiastic.

It was true. Almost all top forces in Eternal Chaotic World gathered there, including Sanctuary Alliance.

With Ancient God tribe alone, he didn’t stand a chance for all forces and experts to give way.

“Jian Wushuang, I’ll ask you for the last time. Are you moving away?!” Colored Glaze Great Emperor stared at Jian Wushuang with a cold look.

All forces and experts at the scene were staring at Jian Wushuang. There were chilly gleams in their eyes.

Just then, Jian Wushuang, who had everyone’s attention, lifted his head again. On his cold face, there was a tinge of madness.

He didn’t speak and only beckoned to Green Fire World nearby.

Jian Nantian in Green Fire World’s formation saw Jian Wushuang’s signal and he immediately plunged to Jian Wushuang.

When he appeared next to Jian Wushuang, he waved and took out a pearl.

The pearl looked murky as it contained a unique aura.

Looking at the pearl, the madness in Jian Wushuang’s eyes flowed out.

He glared at the countless experts before him. These experts could almost represent the entire Eternal Chaotic World!

Then, he was fighting against the entire Eternal Chaotic World alone!!

Even so, he wasn’t nervous or afraid. There was only determination and madness.

“Everyone, let me show you something. You’ll definitely be very emotional after you see it,” Jian Wushuang smiled maliciously and handed the blurry pearl over.

All the experts at the scene couldn’t help but look at the pearl.

Everyone started to feel it using their soul power.

Through the pearl, they could instantly sense the existence of the surrounding ancient battlefield.

Not only could they sense it, but they could also recognize it clearly.

The boundless ancient battlefield was before all experts’ eyes then.

“So huge!!!”

“This ancient battlefield is so vast!”

“It’s too vast. The area that we searched is only a drop in a bucket compared to the entire ancient battlefield.

“With such a vast ancient battlefield, it is at least ten times bigger than the one in ancient mystery land!!”

All experts at the scene were astonished.

After a short while, they noticed a huge object on the ancient battlefield.

Skull!

An extremely huge skull.

A skull that was countless times bigger than any other worlds.

Just like Green Fire World, it was a world that considered quite large in size. However, Green Fire World looked only like a small spot in-between the eyebrows of the skull.

“This... how is this possible?!?!”

“Unbelievable, this is simply unbelievable!”

“Who is this? Whose head is this?”

“Whose head could be that huge? Could it be a head of an expert from ancient times? Impossible! Even though there were countless experts during ancient times, there shouldn’t be any experts’ body that could be that huge in size.”

Dumbfounded, everyone was dumbfounded.

They were shocked by the huge skull.

Actually, they couldn’t be blamed. When Jian Wushuang first saw the skull, he was shocked too. He found it unbelievable too.

The skull was too shocking.

Compared to the boundless ancient battlefield, the skull was even more astonishing.

The few Great Emperors at the scene, such as Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zi Xu, Colored Glaze Great Emperor, Yan Zun, King Luo Yu and other Great Emperors from the other three special tribes, were all gawking at the sight.

As Great Emperors, they were extremely experienced. However, it was their first time coming across such an unbelievable sight.

However, after a short while of astonishment, all experts at the scene burst with excitement.

Excitement!

Yeah, excitement.

They had previously only known that the ancient battlefield contained boundless opportunities but they couldn’t determine just how impressive the place was.

However, as they saw the entire ancient battlefield through the pearl then, they had a better understanding of the ancient battlefield.

Merely the boundless territory size was enough to make them go crazy.

The unbelievable skill shocked them even further. One should know that the more astonishing it was, the more unusual the skull was.

There was no doubt that the territory where the skull was located absolutely contained unbelievable opportunities.

At the same time, they saw that the location of Green Fire World was right in-between the eyebrows of the skill while the skull was located in the core of the ancient battlefield.

Even a silly man could see the value of Green Fire World.

It was absolutely much greater than what they had guessed earlier.

It was truly a huge treasure, a huge treasure that could drive the entire Sanctuary Alliance crazy. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The experts’ gazes were burning with enthusiasm. It was unprecedented enthusiasm.

Even the Great Emperors’ were burning enthusiastically.

Jian Wushuang smirked coldly at the sight, “Hehe, all of you are enjoying the view of this ancient battlefield, enjoying the discovery of the huge skull? Didn’t you notice anything different in the surrounding void on the ancient battlefield?”

Everyone was caught off guard. Then, they looked into the surrounding void on the ancient battlefield.
