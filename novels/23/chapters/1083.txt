Chapter 1084: Invitation

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

No one knew what had happened in that Void, including Jian Wushuang, Jian Nantian, and other people present.

Inside the Ancient Monster Clan, Jian Nantian and Ji Wumeng came up to Jian Wushuang slowly, hand in hand.

“Is she my mother?”?Jian Wushuang stared at the blue-robed woman, thinking.

“How pure and noble her bloodline is! I believe such a bloodline is rarely seen even in the entire Eternal Chaotic World.”?Gu King muttered to himself.

Just in a moment, Jian Nantian and Ji Wumeng stopped in front of Jian Wushuang.

A strange expression crossed Jian Wushuang’s face but soon he reacted to this. He said hurriedly, “Paying respects to you, my mother!”

“You are Shuang’er?” Ji Wumeng looked at Jian Wushuang with an expression of pleasant surprise. “You really have grown up.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Of course. He didn’t know how to walk when you left.” Jian Nantian chimed in.

“Father, mother, we’d better leave here first.” Jian Wushuang proposed.

“Yes.” Jian Nantian nodded and grasped Ji Wumeng’s hand tightly. “Meng’er, let’s go home!”

“Fine, go home!” Ji Wumeng agreed happily.

And the three left.

No one came out to stop them.

Many experts in the Ancient Monster Clan, including Celestial Master Ku Xin, showed the slightest inclination to stop them.

Their departure brought down the curtain on this collision.

Jian Nantian and Jian Wushuang succeeded in rescuing Ji Wumeng and took her away.

While the Ancient Monster Clan paid a heavy price but still failed to stop them.

There existed a lake in a quiet bamboo forest on the Divine Monster Territory.

A handsome cyan-robbed man and a blue-robed woman leaned close to each other in a mid-lake pavilion. They whispered, laughing now and then.

At the edge of the lake, Jian Wushuang held a weed in his mouth and leaned against a pillar. After witnessing the scene in the mid-lake pavilion, he smiled and thought,?“I haven’t seen my father look so happy for a long time. To be precise, I have never seen him smile so happily since I was born.?”

He understood all this.

Since his birth, his mother was separated from his father and him. Later, Jiu Xiu captured her to the Samsara Continent.

His mother and father harbored a deep feeling to each other, but they could not stay together over the past 2,000 years. No one would feel happy about that.

Today, they met again and even could be together forever. That surely was a happy event.

“My mother came back and my father is no longer high-strung. I’m a lot more relaxed.”?Jian Wushuang beamed.

Knowing that his father had become a Reincarnator and his mother’s whereabouts was a mystery, he was under great pressure.

Now, however, the pressure dissipated.

The only one he was worried about was Leng Rushuang.

“Shuang’er!”

When thinking of Leng Rushuang, he could not help but clench his fists.

“Jian Wushuang, stop thinking about that. You cannot find your loved one with your current strength. You might as well think of a way to improve your strength. That’s what you should do now.”?Gu King’s voice sounded.

“I understand.”?Jian Wushuang nodded his head.

“Moreover, your mother possesses an extraordinary bloodline and she must shoulder a lot.”?Gu King added.

“My father is finally reunited with her and they can’t be separated again.”?Jian Wushuang’s eye emanated cold light.?“I’ll shoulder everything for her!”

Gu King sighed with feeling but did not utter a word anymore.

Just at this moment…

A figure floated gently down from the distant horizon like a leaf. And soon, he landed in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Eh?” Jian Wushuang looked at the man before him.

It was a red-haired elder with a smiling face who looked quite gentle.

Given the aura he gave off, Jian Wushuang could tell that he was a Celestial Master!

“My name is Yu Ding!” The red-haired elder said smilingly.

Jian Wushuang knitted his brows. He had never heard of a Celestial Master named Yu Ding.

“I haven’t appeared in the Green Fire World for a long time. So, it’s normal that you don’t know me.” Celestial Master Yu Ding added, “I came here for one thing; hand this token to you. I hope you can take it.”

After finishing speaking, he waved his hand and threw a token to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s expression changed after he received that token and glanced at it.

There were three words on the token… Green Fire Palace!

“You are from the Green Fire Palace?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Exactly.” Celestial Master Yu Ding nodded. “I received an order to invite you to join our palace.”

“Join your palace?” Jian Wushuang’s face turned solemn.

He had heard about the Green Fire Palace long ago.

And he was aware that it was the gathering place for experts in the Green Fire World and it represented the entire Green Fire World.

Furthermore, only Celestial Masters and the rulers of some powerful forces in the Green Fire World would receive its invitation.

Although he was not a Celestial Master, his battle strength was equivalent to that of a Celestial Master. Thus, he did not feel surprised to receive its invitation.

“Well, would you like to join us?” Celestial Master Yu Ding asked smilingly.

“I’m in.” Jian Wushuang agreed without thinking too much.

He perceived the Green Fire Palace’s nature and significance.

Most important of all, his father Jian Nantian, mother Ji Wumeng, Tang Emperor from Tang of the East, and Emperor Qing were all members of the Green Fire Palace.

His close relatives, as well as people who had an intimate relationship with him, chose to join the Green Fire Palace. He, without exception, would do the same thing.

“Since you have agreed with that, would you like to go to the Green Fire Palace with me now?” Celestial Master Yu Ding asked, laughing.

“Now?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“Celestial Master Yu Ding.” A voice without emotion rang out. Jian Nantian and Ji Wumeng came up to them from the mid-lake pavilion shoulder to shoulder.

“Celestial Master Nan,?I hope you are well.” Celestial Master Yu Ding greeted Jian Nantian. Apparently, they knew each other before.

Jian Nantian nodded and came to Jian Wushuang’s side.

“Shuang’er, you are born in the Green Fire World and you should protect this world. The Green Fire Palace is where you can serve the Green Fire World. Just go.” Jian Nantian said.

“What about you?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“I am just reunited with your mother and don’t plan to go to the Green Fire Palace for the time being. We decide to return to the Ancient World and have a look at our hometown. We will come back after some time. After all, you and I must shoulder the responsibility for your mother!” Jian Nantian said earnestly.

“I see. You two just need to have fun together. I’ll handle the rest.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He went to the Green Fire Palace with Celestial Master Yu Ding at once.
