Chapter 1252: The Fifth Step

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Woosh!

An ancient Spaceship whisked across the dark void. Without a clue of its actual speed but definitely faster than any of the Universe God.

Inside this Spaceship, Jian Wushuang simply sat cross-legged. In front of him, a grey stone gem levitated in front of him.

Ever since his announcement on leaving Green Fire World, Tang Emperor has given this grey stone gem to him.

As for this grey stone gem, it was not distant to Jian Wushuang but in fact very familiar.

Today, the reason why he is able to walk the path of cultivators, was in fact due to this grey stone gem which contained the Heavenly Creation Skill of Cultivation Method.

Previously, with only two of the grey stone gem, Jian Wushuang’s Cultivation Strength reached to only the fourth step. This was in defiance with the natural order which was to attain the level of Eternal Supremo. As of now, the fourth step was akin to the level of Dao Master among cultivators.

Now levitating right in front of Jian Wushuang, the grey stone gem was the third one which contained the fifth step to cultivate the Heavenly Creation Skill against natural order.

“With the fourth step against natural order being so excellent, what then encompass the fifth step?”

Holding onto a glimpse of hope, Jian Wushuang’s soul powers instantenously seaped into the grey stone gem and began browsing the next Heavenly Creation Skill for Cultivation Strength.

Seemingly momentarily, Jian Wushuang finished his reading. Upon completion, he opened his eyes but his expression turned very solemn.

“The fifth step, it is actually an Inverse Cultivation Test?” Jian Wushuang frowned deeply.

He originally believed that the fifth step would be the same as the former which would encompass him with special abilities. Incredulously, the fifth step against natural order was an arduous thousand year cultivation. For this Inverse Cultivation, it would be the toughest yet necessary in overcoming this hurdle.

“Inverse Cultivation Disaster!” Jian Wushuang clenched his teeth tightly.

Gu King that was inside of Jian Wushuang’s body, similarly browsed the information of that grey stone gem. After a brief moment of silence, Gu King spoke, “This step, I did previously guessed this.”

“Actually, not only the Inverse Cultivation, all the cultivators in the world would have to go through this hurdle when they reach the level of a Universe God.”

“I have already told you previously, becoming a Universe Master only means you are immortal but it has not transformed your Divine Power. To transform your Divine Power and become a Universe God, you will have to suffer from this disaster and get divine baptism.”

“Unfortunately, overcoming the Disaster is not an easy one. Even in the Eternal Chaotic World , it has always been many of the cultivators’ nightmare. Among a hundred Universe Master, it is almost impossible to have one to survive from it but you have to pass this hurdle in order to become a Universe God. It is inescapable.”

“Frankly speaking, this Disaster is simply a test to divide the strong and the weak. Overcoming it meant becoming a warrior. Failing or constantly being afraid to challenge, you end up being a weakling for the rest of your life.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang realised in shock.

He knew previously that being a Universe Master was only taking half a step but he did not know how exactly to surpass the other half of it.

Now, he understands, that is to pass the Disaster!

Only by overcoming the hurdle can he be a true Universe God.

“Even an ordinary cultivator would have to pass the Disaster to become a Universe God, not to mention the Inverse Cultivation. Inverse Cultivation against natural order is obviously a lot more dangerous than the ordinary cultivation. I once saw a Universe Master making a breakthrough, during the process, the level of difficulty was definitely one hundred times tougher than what an ordinary cultivator would have gone through. ” Gu King said.

“What?” Jian Wushuang was taken aback.

Exactly by hundred times?

That Disaster was uncomparably scary, manifesting fear in many of the cultivators, viewed as an absolute nightmare.

Yet, Inverse Cultivation Disaster is even more scary by a hundred times?

“Even an ordinary cultivator would have to pass the Disaster to become a Universe God, not to mention the Inverse Cultivation. Inverse Cultivation against natural order is obviously a lot more dangerous than the ordinary cultivation. I once saw a Universe Master making a breakthrough, during the process, the level of difficulty was definitely one hundred times tougher than what an ordinary cultivator would have gone through. ” Gu King said.

“Emperor Qing?” Jian Wushuang internally shaken.

He has heard of Emperor Qing from Tang Emperor.

Indeed, at that time, Tang Emperor did say that Emperor Qing died during Inverse Cultivation.

Now it seemed that Emperor Qing’s death, at that time, was probably caused by the Inverse Cultivation Disaster.

When they separated previously, Tang Emperor had specifically warned him that it would be a difficult journey towards Inverse Cultivation and that he should be very careful. Apparently, this was what the Tang Emperor was worried about – the Inverse Cultivation Disaster.

“The cultivate technique of the Inverse Cultivation initially had belonged to the Tang Emperor who then teached it to Emperor Qing. After the death of Emperor Qing, there remained only two of the grey stone gems and the third one had always been on Tang Emperor all along even though he denied. If it wasn’t for me who wanted to explore the Eternal Chaotic World, I am afraid he still would not have given to me that third grey stone gem willingly!”

“He must have been worried that I would follow into the footsteps of Emperor Qing.”

Jian Wushuang wore a grave expression as he nowunderstood what Tang Emperor was worried about. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Tang Emperor was simply worried about his safety which was why he did not give the third grey stone gem to him before.

“Jian Wushuang , this path of Inverse Cultivation is full of thistles and thorns. The Eternal Chaotic World massively boundless, has breed countless Inverse Cultivators across endless time, but those who pass it are extremely rare. Once this hurdle is passed though, those victors become extraordinary.”

“I hope that you can be extraordinary too, instead of being like the majority of the Inverse Cultivators, who died in this path.” Gu King said.

With a stern expression, Jian Wushuang asked, “Gu King, do you know how many tests the Inverse Cultivation Disaster will have?”

“To be a Universe God, there is a total of three levels, therefore the God Disaster should also have three tests. Should you fail any one of the tests, you will be completely destroyed!” Gu King answered gravely.

“Besides, your tests will not be as easy as the typical Inverse Cultivation tests. You have the bloodline of an Ancient God as well as the highest level of Imperial Bloodline which means that you may have to go through the Ancient God Disaster all at once!”

Upon those words, Jian Wushuang’s heart sank. He felt the burden inside him becoming increasingly heavier.

Soon enough, he calmed himself down.

“The Inverse Cultivation Disaster and the Ancient God Disaster, either of them are horrible. Of course, a combination of two must definitely be more dangerous. Every single level could easily destroy me, even so there is still a chance for me to survive and not just die!”

“If I were to fear the disasters in front of me, that would mean that I am extinguishing that very last strand of hope.”

“I, Jian Wushuang, would never do such a silly thing.”

Jian Wushuang smiled slightly, but his eyes gleamed with determination.
