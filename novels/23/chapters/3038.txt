Chapter 3040: Another Challenge at Di Mountain

——

Hualala~

The space-time storm destroyed everything.

Although the space-time storm was not as big as the giant figure in the golden stone picture, it still existed in a vast void, and all the materials in that void were destroyed, all the matter in that void had been annihilated.

“So powerful!”

Looking at the completely annihilated void in front of him, Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled.

He could feel that the power of his finger-space-annihilating skill should be more than a hundred times stronger than the space-time annihilation he controlled!

In other words, he could control the space-time annihilation only after he had comprehended the space-time rules to the third stage, but after the special application of the space-time divine skill, it was a hundred times more powerful. It was too terrifying!

“I can feel that even if I use my divine power to perform this move, I can easily crush a rank three true saint and completely annihilate him. Even his immortal body is useless.” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

The annihilation of time and space was to completely annihilate an area of time and space.

All matter was completely annihilated, including divine power. For an expert of the True Saint Realm, even if his divine body was destroyed, his divine power could still be regenerated when scattered around. However, this finger annihilation of space could completely annihilate the divine power of this area of time and space, naturally, it could destroy this True Saint directly.

“This is only the strength of my divine power. If I use many secret skills, the power of my divine power will soar again. Even a rank four True Saint would not be able to resist this move,” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

The void annihilation technique was too powerful.

Jian Wushuang was also shocked.

He had only grasped the first step of this technique, and his comprehension of the space-time principles had just reached the third stage. In the future, his comprehension of the space-time principles could continue to improve, he would become more and more familiar with this technique, and when he used it, it would be more powerful.

“Space-time divine skill, one-finger heaven-designated skill, and now one-finger void annihilation technique…I wonder what kind of supreme existence the space-time temple master who created this divine skill is.” Jian Wushuang secretly praised.

With the space-annihilating finger skill, he had another trump card in his hand, or even a killer move.

“Phew!”

Taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang gradually calmed down.

“Now, my comprehension of the space-time principles has improved so much that it has greatly improved my speed and swordsmanship. As for the space-annihilating finger skill, although it is not useful when I go to Di Mountain, even without the space-annihilating finger skill, I should have an 80% chance of passing through Di Mountain now!”

“If I slightly improve the silver light movement skill that I created so that it can perfectly combine with my speed, then I have a 90% chance of passing through it.” Jian Wushuang was quite excited.

Immediately, in this dark space, Jian Wushuang began to comprehend and improve his movement skill again.

In the dark space, streaks of silver light constantly flickered. This was Jian Wushuang constantly trying to perform his movement skill. While performing it, he constantly discovered his shortcomings and then improved them.

With his talent and comprehension of the space-time principles, it was very easy for him to improve his movement technique.

It only took him ten days.

After ten days, Jian Wushuang’s ‘silver light’ movement technique had been improved.

Of course, this improvement was only from Jian Wushuang’s current point of view. But if his comprehension of the space-time principles improved to a new level in the future, his view of his movement technique would be different.

“My movement skills have improved. I’m 90% sure that I can pass the Di Mountain. I can go now.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and immediately shouted, “Elder Gu!”

…

A moment later, Jian Wushuang arrived in front of elder Gu.

“Elder Gu, I want to challenge the Di Mountain again,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“Challenge again? It’s only been a year?” Elder Gu frowned slightly.

He had warned Jian Wushuang that anyone who tried to challenge Di Mountain would only have three chances. Jian Wushuang had already used it once, so there were only two chances left.

For this reason, Elder Gu had specifically reminded Jian Wushuang to be as cautious as possible in the next two chances and to try again when he was sure.

But now, it had only been a year since he first tried to challenge Di Mountain.

He came here after a year?

Could it be that he had made great progress in this one year?

“Little guy, how confident are you?” Elder Gu tried to ask.

“70-80% ,” Jian Wushuang said.

He was being humble. Although he was 90% confident, he only said 70-80% .

“70-80% , I can try.” A smile appeared on Elder Gu’s face again. Then he waved his hand, and the tunnel leading to Di Mountain appeared in front of Jian Wushuang again.

“Go in,” Elder Gu said.

Jian Wushuang also stepped into the tunnel.

…

Di Mountain was tall and majestic, which was extremely shocking.

Although Jian Wushuang had reached the top of the mountain last time, he still had to start from the foot of the mountain this time.

Chi! Chi! Chi!

The three gatekeepers at the foot of the mountain could not hinder Jian Wushuang at all. In just a moment, Jian Wushuang had reached the top of Di Mountain again.

On the top of the mountain, the burly elder and the two women, one black and one white, were still standing there, looking at Jian Wushuang calmly.

“You’re here again,” the black-clothed woman said, “it’s only been a year since you came here last time. Although master gave you three chances, you didn’t take this test seriously. How much progress can you make in just a year? How can you overcome the obstacles of the three people?”

“We’ll know if we can.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“Oh, you’re very confident? Then the three of us will crush your confidence now.” The stocky elder said in a deep voice, “Do it!”

Whoosh!

The stocky elder and the black-clothed woman moved at the same time.

As for the white-robed woman, a warm white light emerged from her body and shone toward Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s consciousness was also affected by the warm white light, but he quickly came back to his senses.

As soon as he regained consciousness, he saw the black-robed woman appear behind him. At the same time, a cold blood-red saber light cut toward Jian Wushuang’s head from behind.

The angle was tricky, and the speed was also very fast.

If Jian Wushuang had not broken through the comprehension of the space-time principle before, he would have been a little embarrassed in the face of this saber light.

But now…
