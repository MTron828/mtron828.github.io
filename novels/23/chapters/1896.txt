Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Jian Wushuang, your opponent is us!”

There was a sudden roar and there were three figures that blocked Jian Wushuang simultaneously.

The three of them were Palace Master Wu Luo, who was in a green robe and holding a hammer, Number One Diving King, who was a brawny middle-aged man in crimson armor and holding a crimson saber, and Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church, who was malicious-looking.

The three Peak Emperor Gods blocked Jian Wushuang.

“The last time I fought with you, I did suffer a minor loss. This time, I’m going to take it back,” Palace Master Wu Luo looked with a cold glare.

“I heard of Sword Emperor’s name long ago. It’s my honor to finally see the number one genius of Eternal Chaotic World today,” Number One Divine King said in a deep voice.

“Hehe, you’re only a Real God but you made the three of us who are Peak Emperor Gods team up. Sword Emperor, even if you die, you will die with pride,” the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church smiled maliciously.

“Humph, so what if there are three Peak Emperor Gods? If you want to fight, come on. Let’s do it!”

Jian Wushuang sounded furious. Under the churning bloodline aura, he was like Death. his huge body took a leap and appeared before the three Peak Emperor Gods.

To fight against three people alone and three Peak Emperor Gods, Jian Wushuang showed no fear.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were four resplendent golden lights that flashed and appeared in front of Palace Master Wu Luo directly.

“This again?” Palace Master Wu Luo’s face grew in distress.

In the previous battle, he had been in a miserable situation because of the four Hong Jun Golden Sword.

Then, as they were fighting, Jian Wushuang continued to aim the four Hong Jun Golden Swords at him.

“Go away!” Palace Master Wu Luo roared and he swung the hammer in his hand.

Just as Palace Master Wu Luo moved, Number One Divine King and the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church by his sides immediately attacked.

“Humph!”

Number One Divine King humphed and his body suddenly increased in size by a hundred times. A pair of cold eyes stared like two suns as boundless crimson fog swept out from his body.

He held his saber with one hand and the crimson saber was infinitely magnifying in his hand as well. Suddenly, there was a towering crimson saber shadow.

The layer of saber shadows overlapped as though it was going to slash the universe into half.

Kuang!

The saber light descended.

Jian Wushuang could only feel the saber intention that was pressing on him from all directions.

The power of the saber intention was rare.

“Haha, come on.”

Jian Wushuang laughed hysterically. Among his fourteen arms, there were six that wielded a sword at that very moment.

Vroom. Sword intention swept out along with boundless divine power.

“Reincarnation Sword Principle, the sixth move!”

Six arms wielded the swords at the same time.

There was a total of six sword lights. Every sword light was Reincarnation Sword Principle that Jian Wushuang performed with his all!

One should know that Reincarnation Sword Principle that Jian Wushuang had invented was only six moves. The power of the sixth move was extremely powerful and it took quite a lot of divine power to perform it.

But in the fierce battle at such a level, Jian Wushuang, who was an inverse cultivator, his magnificent divine power was on display.

Reincarnation Sword Principle, the sixth move, his six arms performed it all together and performed a total of six moves at the first instant.

Bang!

There was a loud bang and there was a towering saber shadow that pressed over and immediately collapsed.

However, the power of the collision had yet to disperse and Jian Wushuang suddenly felt a bolt of destroying power spreading from above.

He looked into the void above him and there was a malicious-looking elderly standing there with a cold gaze while he pressed his hand down.

Rumble.

A huge palm print brought about boundless power.

Suddenly, it was as though the entire universe had pressed down at Jian Wushuang.

“Break!”

There was a burst of sharp light in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. Instantly, the sky above suddenly cracked and there was a huge crack.

In the crack, there was sacred thunder gathering and there were bolts of life-destroying power that swept out.

Then, hualala!!!

Life Destroying Sacred Thunder filled the air.

There was a total of more than a thousand Life Destroying Sacred Thunder. At that moment, they merged together and hit the huge palm print.

Along with a ferocious bang, all living things in the universe went quiet.

Jian Wushuang, who was right in the middle of the band, Number One Divine King and Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church, weren’t affected at all.

There was a boundless collision of power but the three of them fought together like lightning.

Jian Wushuang’s fourteen arms wielded a sword each and there was soaring sword intention. He put his improvement in comprehension towards Sword Principle at Emperor Sword Palace be in full play.

Relying on his powerful strength, he fought in close combat with Number One Divine King and the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church.

On the other side, he was still controlling the four Hong Jun Golden Swords as they suppressed Palace Master Wu Luo so that he didn’t have the bandwidth to get involved with the other fights.

The experts from both campsites started fighting too.

Once they fought, they were in a ferocious fight.

Fierce fight!

It was a fierce fight that was worthy for the entire Eternal Chaotic World to watch!

Including the Dao soldiers, there were more than a hundred of them who possessed fighting power of an Almighty that partook in the war..

Just then, in the nearby void around the fierce fights, there were a large number of experts watching the war closely.

“Fought, the two campsites finally fought.”

“They are fighting such a ferocious fight!”

“Nonsense. There are more than a hundred Almighties that fought at the same time. How could it not be ferocious?”

“Such a great war, it’s hard to come by in the second era. I remember the last ferocious war happened many years ago. Then, there were forces and experts besieging the Master of Star Palace. In the end, the Master of Star Palace massacred them all alone!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“It’s a pity that although the power that Lineage of Star possesses is strong, they didn’t have terrifying techniques like the Master of Star Palace after all. It would be unrealistic if they wanted to match evenly with Star Extermination Alliance.”

The experts who were watching the war sighed emotionally.

They could see the situation before them.

Among the two campsites, Star Extermination Alliance obviously had the upper hand.

There was a huge difference in the team formation of both parties.

In terms of Sir Gods, although Lineage of Star had thirty Dao soldiers, at least two Dao soldiers would be required to just about match evenly with an ordinary Sir God.

Accumulatively, Lineage of Star had over thirty fighting powers of Sir God, which was only half of Star Extermination Alliance’s amount.

In terms of the fighting power of Emperor Gods, they were far apart too.

The ten Emperor Gods from Star Extermination Alliance, forget about the four Peak Emperor Gods, there were another six of them while Lineage of Star only had three Emperor Gods besides Jian Wushuang.

Such a vast difference in power led to the one-sided situation since the beginning of the war.

Lineage of Star was suppressed entirely and there was almost no space for struggle.

Although the battle had just started and Lineage of Star didn’t suffer too much damage, in no time, there would be experts from Lineage of Star that passed away one after another. Utter defeat was only a matter of time.
