Chapter 5256: Extreme Combat Ability

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Now, due to the treasures of the Qishen Temple, the divine body and the physical form had been further enhanced, reaching the level of a half-step Emperor.

Just like the Heavenly Emperor Wan Xing, Jian Wushuang didn‚Äôt know the origin source he cultivated, but he was certain it was not the Ultimate Dao.

Without cultivating the Ultimate Dao, he possessed the strength of a half-step Emperor today, thanks to the supreme techniques of the Emperor. His cultivation of the origin source had reached its peak, ranking him at the pinnacle among Dao Lords.

He could be ranked 216th overall, with everyone above him being half-step Emperors who had cultivated the Ultimate Daoo.

Imagine how powerful he was.

Now that his supreme techniques were exposed, his ranking would undoubtedly rise once again.

Especially after exchanging for the replicated Eternal Treasure, his strength probably had already touched the level of an Emperor.

He had surpassed those Ultimate beings who hadn‚Äôt cultivated supreme techniques.

After all, supreme techniques could allow Grand Yan Immortals to make a qualitative leap once, making them the strongest among Dao Lords. And when combined with the replicated Eternal Treasure, this strength was definitely unmatched, making him a heaven-defying existence among the top 100.

He was a Grand Yan Immortal who hadn‚Äôt mastered the Ultimate Dao and hadn‚Äôt cultivated myriad origin source Daos. His strength was enough to dominate all the experts of the second-grade origin source Daos.

Wan Xing had already reached the end of his Dao; one more step and he would be merging Daos.

Having cultivated supreme techniques and possessing treasures, in this regard, even the Emperors from the outside world couldn‚Äôt compare.

He could hardly improve any further, left with a mere insignificant physical body or some obscure alternative Daos. But Jian Wushuang was different; he had so much more room for improvement.

While it wasn‚Äôt certain he would reach perfection in the Extreme Dao, he was fairly confident in breaking through to the sixth level before the Dao merging. Although the Ultimate Dao allowed merging at the seventh level, considering Jian Wushuangs current breakthrough speed, he believed that by the time he achieved Dao merging, he would likely step into the eighth level, or with great effort, even attain perfection.

Just these two aspects of the origin source Dao were enough to elevate his strength to unimaginable heights. Jian Wushuang couldn‚Äôt help but marvel at it himself.

He was slightly lacking in terms of the divine body, but being a mere ten thousand times weaker than others was an elevation beyond the reach of ordinary people.

Once, Jian Wushuang was also a Special Life Form, and his perspective widened only when he entered the Great Si Region. It wasn‚Äôt until the opening of the Qishen Temple this time that he realized what a Special Life form truly meant.

He witnessed the darling of the universe origin source, akin to the beloved child of the Original Universe.

That man‚Äôs divine body was 3,000-5,000 times stronger when he was weak, and at his peak, he was even 10,000 times stronger.

He had surpassed everyone from the moment he was born.

Jian Wushuang admitted he couldn‚Äôt match up to this fact, but as long as the treasures bestowed upon him by the Qishen Temple were not inferior to those from this time, he had confidence even in the 5,000-fold category.

Apart from these, there was one more thing to mention: the supreme techniques.

If there were no suitable supreme profound techniques in the future, Jian Wushuang could focus wholeheartedly on the origin source Dao. He believed he could forge a path that surpassed all, an extraordinary and unparalleled journey that left everyone trailing in his wake.

When he reached the extreme-level of Grand Yan Immortal, he could defeat Nine Revolutions with a single sword strike.

In the extreme-level Grand Yan Immortal phase, elevating everything to its peak, it might even be possible to achieve the incredible feat of killing an Emperor.

This was an unprecedented event in the Original Universe; it remained unknown whether there had ever been such a formidable Grand Yan Immortal in ancient times.

‚ÄúSenior, how powerful were the formidable Grand Yan Immortals in ancient times?‚Äù Jian Wushuang couldn‚Äôt help but ask.

Upon hearing this question, Qiuhuang, the elder above, blushed!

During ancient times, he wasn‚Äôt associated with the Qishen faction. Those formidable Grand Yan Immortals back then were disciples of the Qishen sect. He felt awkward mentioning it, so he could only talk about his own past.

‚ÄúWell, let me tell you about myself! Back when I was a Dao Lord, I was what you call a Grand Yan Immortal. At that time, I could almost contend against a tier 1 Emperor and not fall behind,‚Äù Qiuhuang said proudly.

Compared to younglings like Jian Wushuang, he indeed had extraordinary innate talent.

He belonged to a prominent lineage from childhood, the direct descendant of a major clan. Although he was stubborn, he awakened early. He wasted time until he was 100 years old, surrounded by many flatterers, which kept him from cultivation.

It wasn‚Äôt until he was assassinated that his life took a turn.

Even though he survived by sheer luck, it was the first time he had danced on the edge of life and death.

From then on, he dedicated himself to cultivation!

After all, being a direct descendant, he had abundant resources.

His maternal family was also immensely powerful. Several uncles and aunts were Emperor-level experts, and his mother was an extremely powerful Emperor. From somewhere, she obtained an unparalleled physique for him, making him a naturally superior being.

Within 1,000 years, he became a formidable Yan Immortal.

In ancient times, Yan Immortals were also known as minor Dao Lords.

Only by becoming a Yan Immortal could one truly touch the origin source and be considered a cultivator.

Relying on his unceasing efforts and diligence, Qiuhuang became a Dao Lord within 100,000 years, stepping into the ranks of the powerful. Exppl√¥re ùíñptodùíÇte stories at no/ùíóel//bin(.)cùíêm

At that time, the Daoist peers of his family were only Grand Yan Immortals, not much stronger than him.

Later, his maternal family offended a terrifying powerhouse and was annihilated overnight. This event motivated him once again to become a superlative expert, to dominate the past and present.

Thus, over the course of a million years, he pushed himself to the extreme, breaking through to become an Emperor, a formidable tier 4 Emperor at that.

After becoming an Emperor, the support from his family diminished. Their universe had already been devoured by several major families and sects. This kind of erosion was incomparable to the forces within the Original Universe. In the present Original Universe, to be precise, not even the Emperors had reached their peak. The control of various forces was also mediocre. It would take the development of several cosmic epochs before they could rival the ancient universes in strength.

Qiuhuangs luck was extraordinary when he entered the River of Time. Shortly after entering, he encountered a tremendous opportunity. He was then recruited into a major force and nurtured as a prodigy. Breaking through to tier 5 only a matter of time. Later, he gained control of Qiuhuang City, reaching the pinnacle of power.

Within the family, he was considered on par with the clan head.

Unfortunately, the faction they belonged to had rather bad luck. They dared to attack the faction where Qishen resided. Although the difference in strength wasn‚Äôt too significant at the grassroots level, it was substantial among the top-tier experts.

In the end, they faced utter defeat. The leader of that faction simply left, leaving Qiuhuang and his companions in dire straits. Fortunately, at that time, Qishen was in the process of constructing the Qishen Temple and needed manpower. So, these people were thrown into the vast world within the Qishen Temple, building treasure vaults and strange secret realms.

This arrangement lasted for countless cosmic epochs. Qiuhuangs memories of the outside world remained frozen in that single sword strike.

‚ÄúIn my prime, 1 was a notable figure. It was just my ill-fated fortune that held me back! Otherwise, I could have taken the sixth step,‚Äù Qiuhuang sighed.

The sixth step!

That was the realm of the utmost experts. How different it was from the current Original Universe, where even tier 4 Emperors could swagger around. In ancient times, a tier 4 Emperor could barely be considered a mid-level combatant..
