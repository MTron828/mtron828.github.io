Chapter 3027: Xi Xiang

——

Gold King’s words stirred up a huge wave in the hearts of the experts from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom.

How long had the Heavenly Sword Marquis fought with the Magic Note King? Even if they had clashed head-on, they had only clashed dozens of times. In such a short period of time, had the power of his sword techniques increased?

From a rank two absolute art to a rank three absolute art?

Was this not too terrifying?

“Monster!”

“A real monster!”

The experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom could not help but exclaim.

Even the Magic Note King had an extremely interesting expression on his face.

“The power from his sword is getting stronger and stronger. Even if I used my strongest move, I wouldn’t be able to completely crush him. Furthermore, his sword technique level is still increasing.” The Magic Note King’s eyes were filled with shock. “Moreover, he has collided with me so many times. Previously, his divine body was heavily damaged and it took a lot of divine power to repair it. However, after dozens of collisions, his divine power is still abundant?”

“What’s going on?”

Even the Magic Note King was baffled.

He did not know that Jian Wushuang was immersed in comprehension as he collided with him.

“No, no, my swordsmanship has improved a lot after clashing with each other and has reached the threshold of the third-level absolute art. However, I still feel that I’m missing something very important!” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Now, because of the soaring power of his swordsmanship, he was not as crushed as before when he fought with the Magic Note King. He was only slightly suppressed.

At this moment, he was carefully observing the hammering skills of the Magic Note King.

The two black hammers wielded by the Magic Note King contained extremely dense dark rules. The power of the two hammers was also extremely powerful and extremely swift.

However, Jian Wushuang soon noticed something else amidst the swift and fierce movements.

“Is this…evil energy?”

“Yes, it’s the gas!”

“I see, I know what I lack in swordsmanship, is this kind of indomitable, invincible hostility!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes suddenly lit up, and his heart suddenly opened up.

After all, he was comprehending the principles of time and space, which were very elusive and not as violent as the fire and thunder. However, Jian Wushuang had created the Xi Xiang swordsmanship, which was a move that focused entirely on power, how can there be no hostility?

“Rage, rage!”

“I’m going to make my swordplay violent.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes glittered with golden light. The next moment, the sword style in his hand began to change invisibly.

That long sword cleaves out, in an instant shocking power swept, a strong evil spirit swept out, the power of the sword also immediately increased a lot.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

The Magic Note King’s face became more and more unsightly.

“His swordsmanship is becoming more and more powerful, and its power is increasing faster and faster. His sword form is also becoming more and more violent?” The Magic Note King stared at Jian Wushuang.

At first, when he used his most powerful skill, Jian Wushuang could not resist him at all. He was just one strike away from destroying his divine body.

Then, even if the power of Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship had increased a lot, he could still easily crush him.

Just now, although the power of Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship had increased to the level of a rank three absolute art, it was still inferior to his. He could still suppress it.

But now…Jian Wushuang waved the same swordsmanship again. Although it was still a little inferior to his, it was enough to put some pressure on him.

The improvement speed was incredible.

Most importantly, the improvement speed was still going on!

Suddenly…

“This is the time.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes suddenly burst out with a shocking light. The 30,000-feet-tall Golden Emperor Phantom behind him also flashed with endless golden light.

Roar!

A deep, angry roar suddenly came from heaven and earth.

Jian Wushuang also slashed out with his sword, but the instant he did so, the sword light directly turned into a complete and huge ancient exotic beast.

This ancient exotic beast was extremely ferocious, and it was filled with a fierce aura. With a shocking power, it directly attacked.

The Magic Note King seemed to have noticed the increase in power of this sword, and in fear, he also swung her two hammers again.

“Dark meteor shower!”

Hong! Hong!

The world immediately turned dark.

Under this boundless darkness, two dark rays of light instantly descended, and in the blink of an eye, they collided head-on with the ancient strange beast.

Peng!

A loud sound shook the world, and the surrounding void stirred up endless waves. A huge shock wave swept out without restraint.

In the middle of the collision, the Magic Note King opened his mouth slightly. He was purely shocked because he had already felt the power coming from his sledgehammer. The power was actually…above his.

Boom!

The void was about to explode, and the Magic Note King staggered back a few steps.

As for Jian Wushuang, he was still standing there as if he was not affected at all.

He was pushed back!

The Magic Note King was pushed back!

“How is it possible?”

“Impossible!”

“The king was pushed back by a head-on collision?”

The experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom who were watching the battle widened their eyes in disbelief.

Even the Magic Note King himself was completely stunned.

As for Jian Wushuang, he stood in the void with a sword in one hand, looking at the longsword in his hand with great excitement.

“How can a sword technique that focuses purely on power not be filled with evil energy?”

“Only indomitable evil energy can create an unstoppable attack. Only such a sword technique can be considered complete.”

Jian Wushuang could not help clenching his fist.

After the repeated head-on confrontations and clashes with the Magic Note King, the sword skill ‘Xi Xiang’ created by him was finally perfected.

Since then, besides the ‘Star Dream’, Jian Wushuang had created the embryonic form of the second sword skill.

“This sword move of mine should have reached the level of a peak stage three secret skill, but it has an amazing evil aura. It’s no longer suitable to be named Xi Xiang. Instead, it should be named Evil Xiang,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

Evil Xiang…

This sword move had a complete framework and could become the embryonic form of swordsmanship.

And just now, he had relied on this sword attack to force the Magic Note King back. This was the first time he had defeated the Magic Note King in a head-on collision.

Moreover, this was not the least bit fancy. If there was not the slightest bit of luck, it was purely a victory in terms of strength.

Just like the Magic Note King, he was now completely stupefied.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
