Chapter 2540: Ancient Witch

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

All eyes had fallen on her as soon as the black-clothed lady appeared.

“Is she the expert specially invited by the Shi clan?”

“She looks like a weak lady to me.”

“Don’t underestimate her. The Shi clan will never make fun of one hundred and sixty thousand of Primordial Stones unless they have gone crazy!”

The spectators were talking.

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes and looked at the black-clothed lady. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

He could sense the lady had practiced some sort of technique to mask her true aura so that none could guess how powerful she truly was.

He knew she must be powerful if the Shi clan sought her out as a candidate to face him in the final battle.

“So, you are Jian Yi?” The black-clothed lady—the Ancient Witch—blinked her eyes and peered at Jian Wushuang. “I hear from the Shi clan that you’re very powerful, so I’m keen to meet you.”

“Make your move.” Jian Wushuang was indifferent.

“Haha, you do have the charisma of a powerful person.” The Ancient Witch cracked an evil grin before a black spear appeared in her hand.

In a room within the inner layer of the Gladiatorial Arena.

The graceful woman stood alongside a black-robed old man as her eyes fixed on the Gladiatorial Arena.

“Can that lady threaten Jian Yi at all?” The black-robed old man was doubtful.

“I’m uncertain, but she should be quite good. The clan head had personally invited her after all. She’s famous for having defeated a High-Level Ultimate God,” said the graceful woman.

“Defeated a High-Level Ultimate God?” The black-robed old man was stunned.

“They have started.”

The graceful woman was observing intently.

The Ancient Witch made the first move.

A black net seemed to have engulfed the entire Gladiatorial Arena as she moved.

The Ancient Witch completely melted into the darkness and disappeared.

Jian Wushuang coldly stood there while discharged his soul powers but was unable to locate the Ancient Witch’s position within the darkness.

“She has an excellent command of the Dark Law.” Jian Wushuang concluded.

Swoosh!

A cold light suddenly appeared right beside Jian Wushuang without any signs.

It had a terrifying penetrating power aiming directly for Jian Wushuang’s head that pierced through and wrung the void.

Jian Wushuang was startled as the cold light almost brushed his nose bridge.

“Oh?”

The Ancient Witch who reappeared was surprised that Jian Wushuang so easily avoided her spear. However, her imposing aura started surging the next second.

The black spear in her hand instantly evolved from a venomous serpent into an awakened dragon.

Rumbling... The void was shaking.

The spear was eager to attack and she thrust it toward Jian Wushuang in anger.

Jian Wushuang retreated and was so close to being stabbed.

The Ancient Witch raged when she saw that. “Be a man and fight me instead of dodging around like a coward!”

Jian Wushuang chuckled in his heart as he had also decided not to elude her attacks anymore.

“Well, this is the fifth and final battle. There’s no need to hide my strength anymore. Let’s unleash our full potential, shall we?” Jian Wushuang’s face sank.

Swoosh!

He broke into a terrifying speed with his eleven apparitions and formed a total of twelve figures including his real body.

Twelve identical figures were positioned around the Gladiatorial Arena with no way of distinguishing which was the real Jian Wushuang from either one’s naked eyes or soul powers.

In the inner layer’s room, the graceful woman’s eyes were cold like a frozen lake. “It’s indeed true that he’s still concealing his true strength. He must have a very high understanding of the Space-time Law if he’s able to form eleven apparitions. His strength is perhaps equivalent to a Peak Ultimate God!”

Jian Wushuang had only used seven when he fought against Tu Ying in the fourth battle.

However, Jian Wushuang was moving like a phantom with his eleven apparitions on the loose at the same time as he appeared in front of the Ancient Witch with his explosive sword skills.

Slash! Slash! Slash! Slash!

There was a blurry trail of sword shadows as he casually waved his arm.

That was right, he was moving around casually and effortlessly.

He was incredibly fast under the Space-time Law’s influence.

On the other hand, the Ancient Witch who was completely contained in the darkness fiercely thrust her spear.

She was very skillful with the spear and definitely, the best spear handler Jian Wushuang had encountered so far. Jian Wushuang perceived the Ancient Witch’s spear skills might be even better than his own sword skills.

Unfortunately, she was nowhere near Jian Wushuang’s speed.

The Ancient Witch was completely at a disadvantage when the two fought head-on.

“Haha, you are great indeed!”

Although she was suppressed by Jian Wushuang from her somewhat restricted movements, she was not angry at all. On the contrary, she seemed to be quite surprised.

Hum!

The dark light that enshrouded the void suddenly converged and wrapped around the Ancient Witch as her complexion turned cold and her divine power breath thickened.

At the same time, there was an earth-shaking rumbling sound before a strong killing intent covered the area with astonishing spear intent.

An infinite Spear World instantly appeared in the arena.

“Spear World?” Jian Wushuang was impressed.

Some of the spectators recognized the Ancient Witch’s technique.

It was a complete display of Spear World!

The Spear World was somewhat similar to Sword World as they were both Principle Worlds.

The Sword World was a sword cultivators’ higher realm achievement in order to establish their very own Sword World.

On the other hand, the Spear World was created by spear cultivators.

They were similar in terms of power and characteristics.

The ancient Witch’s Spear World seemed to be recently established as it was evidently not as powerful as the Infernal Heart Prefecture Governor’s Sword World in the Dark Thunder Territory. In addition, a Spear World also posed a lesser threat to Jian Wushuang as compared with a Sword World. Nonetheless, it was still a Principle World.

“Impressive! You’re indeed a super genius from the Dragon Phoenix Pavilion since you’re able to display your very own Spear World while just at the Primary-Level Ultimate God realm.”

The two army commanders appeared at the spectators’ seat without warning. They were surprised from seeing the scenes in the Gladiator Arena.

Generally, only Earth Ultimate Gods could learn a Principle World with very few Peak Ultimate Gods capable of doing so.

Neither of the two of them had reached that level.

However, the Ancient Witch was able to establish her own Spear World.

Both commanders were envious of her.
