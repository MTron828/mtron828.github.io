4230 Snake Slaying (Part One)

Three days passed by in a flash.

In a pavilion, Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged on the ground and his eyes suddenly opened.

A light flashed across Jian Wushuang’s eyes!

“Time’s up. We’re going to flatten the Heavenly Snake Divine Palace!”

!!

Jian Wushuang stood up and walked toward the Heavenly Snake Divine Palace.

Ruler Hao Jin followed behind Jian Wushuang.

On this day, the entire Eighth City was shaken!

…

Inside the Heavenly Snake Divine Palace.

Heavenly Snake Playboy also stood up and stuck out his forked tongue, licking the corner of his mouth.

“Blood Sword, it’s time to give you a reward.”

At the end of the Imperial Road in the Eighth City.

Jian Wushuang stood up and stepped forward.

In the beginning, Jian Wushuang’s speed was extremely slow. As time passed, Jian Wushuang’s footsteps became faster and faster. Finally, he turned into a bolt of lightning between heaven and earth. With a thunderclap under his feet, his body soared into the sky!

“Blood Sword, pay your respects to the Heavenly Snake Divine Palace!”

In the next moment, Jian Wushuang’s voice was like rolling thunder falling from the sky. It suddenly exploded in the sky above the Eighth City, the Heavenly Snake Divine Palace!

At this moment, everyone in the Eighth City was gathered here, and everyone was watching!

“It’s starting!”

Everyone raised their heads and looked at Jian Wushuang, who was standing in the void above the Heavenly Snake Divine Palace. They narrowed their eyes at the same time.

They knew that the battle between the Blood Sword and Heavenly Snake Playboy had begun!

The next moment, more than 20 Ultimate Rulers in iron skirts rushed out of the Heavenly Snake Divine Palace.

They held long axes in their hands and wore battle armors. They looked like the legendary divine generals of the heavenly court. They took a step forward and stopped Jian Wushuang outside the Heavenly Snake Divine Palace.

“Blood Sword, Playboy has ordered that if you want to fight him, you’ll have to get past us first!”

The twenty iron-skirted Rulers had powerful auras. They were at the Ultimate Ruler realm, just like the five iron-skirted Rulers that Jian Wushuang had killed in the Fifth City.

“These are the 28 iron-clad guards of Heavenly Snake Playboy!”

“It seems that if the Blood Sword wants to defeat Lord Heavenly Snake, it must first defeat the strength of his subordinates!”

“If that’s the case, even if this Blood Sword can really fight with Heavenly Snake Playboy in the end, I’m afraid he won’t have much divine power left.”

When the crowd saw this scene, they all started discussing.

At the back of the crowd, Ruler Lange and Divine Lord Tiancang were also watching the scene.

Ruler Lange shook his head and laughed coldly, “This Blood Sword is really stupid. It had to provoke Heavenly Snake Playboy so openly. Look at what happened now. Heavenly Snake Playboy has countless Rulers under him. I’d like to see how many of them can the Blood Sword kill!”

“Lange,” Divine Lord Tiancang said, “this Blood Sword is just a brainless man. We don’t need to care about him.”

He paused.

“Lange,” Divine Lord Tiancang said, “we’ll be ready at any time. as soon as Heavenly Snake Playboy comes out, we’ll kill him with one strike!”

Ruler Lange nodded in response.

Outside the Heavenly Snake Divine Palace.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold. Back when he was in the Tarot Ruins, he had the power of a fourth-level Ruler and defeated the Allied forces of Lord Zhennan, the Third Prince, and the Ruler Silver Roc.

Now that he had reached the fifth level of the Ruler realm, his strength had increased severalfold. These twenty-some iron-skirted Rulers were nothing in his eyes.

“Fine, I’ll cut off your wings then come back and kill you.”

Jian Wushuang murmured to himself. Then, the Wuqi Divine Sword appeared in his hand. The fierce and overbearing sword essence soared into the sky as if it was going to cut the sky in half!

In the next moment, Jian Wushuang looked down at the twenty iron-skirted guards and his eyes were extremely cold!

“Whoever stops me will die!”

Jian Wushuang took a step forward and the Wuqi Divine Sword flashed. The two of them turned into a sword light that pierced through the sky, the sun, and the moon and charged at the twenty-odd iron-skirted guards!

“Reject!”

More than 20 iron-skirted guards had serious expressions on their faces. They took a step forward in unison and hacked down with their long axes!

The axe lights suddenly merged together and turned into a light wave that could split the sky and earth. Then, it hacked toward Jian Wushuang!

But…it was all useless!

A blood-colored sword light slashed through the twenty-some iron-skirted Rulers, and their divine bodies began to collapse!

The sword-light pierced through the twenty-some iron-skirted Rulers!

Whoosh!

Then, Jian Wushuang’s figure appeared behind the twenty-odd iron-skirted Rulers.

At this moment, the twenty-some iron-skirted Rulers finally crumbled, their bodies turning into dust and scattering into the air.

He had killed more than twenty Ultimate Rulers with a single sword strike!

In an instant, everyone in the city was shocked.

These twenty-some iron-skirted Rulers weren’t strong individually, but when they worked together, even the top-tier Ultimate Rulers would have to retreat.

Ruler Lange, Divine Lord Tiancang, and the others behind the crowd narrowed their eyes.

“Hmph, I didn’t think that I would underestimate this Blood Sword.”

Ruler Lange’s eyes flashed as he let out a cold snort.

As for Divine Lord Tiancang, he squinted his eyes and shook his head, “These twenty-plus iron-skirted guards are just ordinary people amongst the Ultimate Rulers. They aren’t much. If I were in their position, I would be able to do the same.”

Ruler Lange nodded, then replied, “You’re right. The 20 iron-skirted guards are just appetizers. If the Blood Sword is so weak, it’s still far from Ruler Heavenly Snake Playboy’s level.”

At the same time.

In the depths of the Heavenly Snake Divine Palace.

Heavenly Snake Playboy sat on the big chair, his golden vertical pupils shining. He directly saw Jian Wushuang, who had killed more than 20 iron-skirted guards with one stroke. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Tsk, tsk. No wonder the yin-yang slaves are no match for this person. He does have some strength.”

Heavenly Snake Playboy said with a faint smile on his face.

The next moment, he stuck out his forked tongue, which was covered in saliva, and said, “Moluo, hei Teng, help me take care of this Blood Sword.”

“Yes.”

A muffled sound came from behind Heavenly Snake Playboy.

Then, he saw two rays of red light behind the big chair that Heavenly Snake Playboy was sitting on in the endless darkness.

Then…it was a pair of huge scarlet eyes!

This pair of eyes was as large as a hanging red lantern, emitting a dark red light. It did not look like a human, but a huge monster.

Immediately, the pair of eyes rose continuously as if a monster had awakened from its deep sleep and stood up from the earth.

Boom! Boom!

The huge hall began to emit a dull sound.

The next moment, a human-shaped monster that was nearly 100 feet tall walked out from behind Heavenly Snake Playboy.

The monster was huge, like an iron tower, and it exuded a terrifying aura.

His skin was dark and his muscles were bulging like steel. His veins were as thick as his arms and they were twisted like tree roots.

The monster’s eyes were like red lanterns, emitting a red light. two fangs protruded from its lower lip and rose to its nostrils. on top of its head, there was a pair of curved and sharp horns that pierced into the sky as if they were going to pierce through the heavens.
