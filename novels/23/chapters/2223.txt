Chapter 2224 Apologising

“My disciple, go pick up their treasures,” Jian Wushuang instructed.“Understood,” He Xiu immediately took the treasures and the Qian Kun Rings of Emperor God Bai Xing and the others.

He Xiu returned to Jian Wushuang. “Master, do we still make our way towards the Real Martial Arts Divine Church?”

“No need for that,” Jian Wushuang smiled. “Xie Yu mentioned his two brothers just now. Now that I have suppressed him, his brothers will definitely come for him, we just need to wait.”

“Understood,” He Xiu nodded.

At that moment, within the Real Martial Arts Divine Church’s lair.

Two figures were cultivating in separate rooms within a secluded palace.

Suddenly, Xie Yu’s transmission came over.

Both of them in the room opened their eyes immediately.

“Number five?”

Xiu!

Xiu!

Two figures immediately appeared within the palace.

The Soul Power of both started to cover the entire Real Martial Arts Divine Church.

“Number five’s not here, along with the Church leader and his Chaotic Realm disciples,” a black-haired man with a black mark on his forehead said.

Immediately they caught a senior from the Real Martial Arts Divine Church and got hold of the story.

“Lineage of Star?”

“Number five’s in trouble, let’s go.”

The both of them then made their way to the city that Jian Wushuang was held up in.

Within the huge city, countless cultivators gathered and stared in awe and fear towards the figure about the central Void.

Jian Wushuang had his hands crossed and was stood there casually, but his Soul Power was already spreading.

Jian Wushuang immediately sensed two strong auras within his Soul Power radius.

“They’re here.” Jian Wushuang looked towards the Void in front of him.

The countless cultivators around followed Jian Wushuang’s gaze and looked towards the Void.

At the edge of the Void, two black dots appeared and were enlarging at an alarming rate.

Finally, the two figures appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

One was in a black robe, black-haired, with a black mark on his forehead. He stood there, releasing no aura at all.

The other man was red-haired, in a red robe, with a fire mark on his forehead, exuding violent and hot aura. It felt like a burning flame.

They took a glance at everyone around.

Both of them also noticed Jian Wushuang.

“Number five, where is he?” The burly man with the flame mark shouted.

“Number five?”

“If you are talking about Xie Yu, he’s now suppressed,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Suppressed?”

“You dare suppress my brother!” The burly man was enraged, flames coming out from his eyes. There was no obvious fire, but everyone around could feel the heat and flames on them like they were being cooked alive.

“Retreat, let’s move further away!” The surrounding cultivators had to move to the edge of the city to escape from that fiery aura.

“So what if I did?” Jian Wushuang had no fear.

“The nerve!” The burly man was about to make his move.

“Brother, no rush,” the black-haired young man stopped him.

The black-haired man was obviously calmer than the burly man.

He exhaled lightly and looked towards Jian Wushuang. “You are from the Lineage of Stars, and able to suppress our Number Five. I assume you are the great Sword Emperor of this era?”

“Yes, it is I,” Jian Wushuang nodded, acknowledging it.

“Sword Emperor, I’m afraid there has been a misunderstanding. The three of us only wish to cultivate and restore our peak strength. We had no intention of making enemies with the Lineage of Stars,” the black-haired man said.

“No intention?”

“But you have already done it,” Jian Wushuang replied coldly.

“That is the act of the Real Martial Arts Divine Church, I assume. We had no intention of offending you or any other expert of this era. We hope you can forgive our brother, and we will be willing to compensate you for the trouble we’ve caused for your Lineage of Stars,” the black-haired man was sincere.

“Apologise? Compensate?”

“Haha, if I’m not wrong, those two Blood Slaves are the work of your brother, right?” Jian Wushuang pointed towards the two blood slaves.

The black-haired man’s face darkened at the sight of them.

Blood Slaves were indeed one of Xie Yu’s favourite pastimes.

In the Ancient Era, he loved turning live cultivators into Blood Slaves.

“You know, one of the Blood Slaves belonged to the Lineage of Stars,” Jian Wushuang said coldly. “Your brother ruthlessly killed my Lineage of Stars expert and turned him into a Blood Slave. Before you arrived, he made his move against me as well. If not for my skills, I’m afraid I would have been turned into a Blood Slave as well.” The black-haired man’s face darkened with resentment.

He had instructed Xie Yu many times to not act wantonly.

But it seemed that Xie Yu obviously did not want to listen to him.

“Your Excellency, regardless of whether he is my brother, this issue will be put to an end if you release my brother. I will promise to never offend the Lineage of Stars, but if you insist on not releasing my brother...” the black-haired man’s voice deepened.

“So what if I’m not willing to release? Will you learn from your brother and turn me to a Blood Slave as well?” Jian Wushuang sniggered.

“Looks like there is no longer room for negotiation,” the black-haired man’s eyes turned cold.

The burly man beside him sneered, “Number two, why waste time with words? Just kill him already.”

The flame and heat immediately encompassed the entire city, burning the Void.

Many buildings, and even the ground below, succumbed to the sea of fire.

Immediately, the city’s buildings were burned to ash.
