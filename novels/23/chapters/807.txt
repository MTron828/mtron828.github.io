Chapter 808: Fighting against Lei Xin again

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“You’re just a Divine Realm expert. How do you have such a mighty Puppet Fighter?”

Lei Xin cast a glance at the Puppet Fighter, which was at war with Mr. Wu, a gleam of eagerness flashing over his eyes.

Puppet Fighters were expensive.

The value of such a powerful Puppet Fighter was boundless. Even he was not qualified to own one like this.

“Lei Xin, if you want this Puppet Fighter, then kill me. As long as you kill me, he’s yours,” Jian Wushuang provoked Lei Xin.

“That makes sense,” Lei Xin slightly nodded, “Now that you’re courting death, I’ll help you.”

His purple Stone Staff emerged in his hand, wrapped by Thunderbolts. With the sound of thunder piercing the void, the void in front of Jian Wushuang was broken open, and Lei Xin suddenly appeared.

When he showed up, Lei Xin clenched his Long Staff in both hands and swung out angrily at Jian Wushuang.

“Thunder Hell!”

After a deep howl, there was the sound of Thunderbolt rushing through the void. Jian Wushuang then saw before him a vast web of Thunderbolts.

As the vast web was raging, a great power erupted from it and covered Jian Wushuang.

As Lei Xin moved, Jian Wushuang had activated his Bloodline Power, and turned into a 15-meter Gold-armored Ancient God, holding the enlarged Emperor Sword of 10 meters long.

At the sight of the vast web of Thunderbolts, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with fierce dark golden lights.

“Break!”

Along with a deep shout, Emperor Sword was wielded directly, bursting forth Level Three power of the Sword Heart.

This strike was combined with Level 12 power magnitude of the Star-river Secret Skill and the great advantage of a Gold-armored Ancient God’s innate strength.

Jian Wushuang had put all his power into the strike.

SPLASH…

The sword light cut inexorably at the vast web of purple Thunderbolts, making a large gash in its center, which caused endless Thunderbolts to collapse and dissipate.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang sneered, and brandished the Emperor Sword again. It was the First Move of the Boundless Heaven Sword Art, the Annihilation Sword Move.

It was a fierce, overwhelming blow, as though it had the power to destroy heaven and earth.

Lei Xin turned around and waved his purple Stone Staff at the same time. Immediately, countless staff shadows appeared in the void. These shadows overlapped to form a powerful blow. After a humming sound through the void, the Stone Staff collided with Jian Wushuang’s Emperor Sword.

CLANG!

There was a loud noise.

The huge aftermath of the collision swept away immediately.

BOOM!

The water level below them instantly dropped by hundreds of feet, exposing many holes around which set off huge waves.

“Young man, it’s only been a few days, but your strength seems to have improved a lot. No wonder you dare to challenge me head on,” Lei Xin said, staring at Jian Wushuang steely.

Through this fight, he found Jian Wushuang much more powerful than he had been three days ago.

“Hehe, if I am not powerful enough, how dare I fight against you, an expert at Step Five of the Eternal Realm head on?” Jian Wushuang went on in a sarcastic tone.

He then moved his wrist in a flash, swinging out the Emperor Sword with great agility.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh…

In a twinkling of an eye, Jian Wushuang had thrust out his sword dozens of times.

Each strike was as fast as lightning, and could easily kill an average expert at Step One or Two of the Eternal Realm.

Lei Xin was flooded with dozens of sword shadows, making him feel like he had fallen into a sea of swords.

As an expert at Step Five of the Eternal Realm, Lei Xin’s Staff Heart had long reached Level Five, much higher than Jian Wushuang’s Sword Heart at Level Three.

Perhaps he was not so good at close combat as Jian Wushuang was, but he was no worse at understanding his weapon than Jian Wushuang was.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Lei Xin moved swiftly, and at the same time, he swung the Stone Staff in a quick and agile way. Whether it was chopping, stabbing or sweeping, every move was flexible and smooth.

Bang! Bang! Bang…

Awful deafening roars echoed across the sea one after another. The whole sea below had been turned upside down by the fierce battle between both men.

“Lei Xin, is that all your strength?” Jian Wushuang shouted in a deep voice, his dark golden eyes glaring at Lei Xin.

“You bastard.”

Lei Xin’s face looked a little ugly. He did not expect that he would be looked down upon by a Divine Realm expert.

“He is much stronger than he was a few days ago. During the last fight, I could crush him completely, even though I couldn’t kill him. Now, not only am I not in the upper hand, but I’m also losing,”?Lei Xin thought sullenly.

An expert at the peak of Step Five in the Eternal Realm, unexpectedly can’t win any upper hand in a fight with a Divine Realm expert?

It was an absolute great shame.

“Young man, go to hell!”

Lei Xin let out a roar. The next moment, his aura suddenly raged, and clusters of vast Purple Thunderbolts also burst out, filling the entire battlefield.

“Nine Heaven Thunder!”

Lei Xin’s face became distorted, and the purple Stone Staff in his hand suddenly swelled to a height of 30 feet.

BOOM!

A great thunder suddenly descended from the sky, and the purple Stone Staff in Lei Xin’s hand seemed to initiate it. The purple Stone Staff guided this huge thunder, and then hurled at Jian Wushuang.

Swash… The vast Purple Thunderbolt flowed through the void, causing space rifts to appear one after another.

It was Lei Xin’s ultimate skill, the Nine Heaven Thunder!

He had absolute confidence in this move.

“This move… ”

As the Purple Thunderbolt came to Jian Wushuang with overwhelming power, his pupils shrank. He dared not underestimate it. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

In the void, he, of 15 meters tall, suddenly raised his Emperor Sword high.

As the sword was raised, the Sword Essence that burst out of Jian Wushuang was unstoppable, overwhelming and fully converging on the sword blade.

Jian Wushuang’s breathing became gentle, and the vast Spiritual Power and forces that burst out from him were completely gathered in the Emperor Sword at this moment.

“The third move of the Boundless Heaven Sword Art, the Red Shade Sword Move!”

Jian Wushuang suddenly launched another move.

BOOM!

As Jian Wushuang waved his sword, a huge hazy sword shadow cut out.

For a moment, the world was in dead silence.

Then, two terrifying powers collided head-on.

BANG!

There was a tremendous rumbling sound like the sky and earth was falling apart. After the roar sounded, two figures shot back towards the rear at an alarming speed simultaneously.

Jian Wushuang’s tall body retreated hundreds of feet, while Lei Xin was obviously in a worse situation.

Jian Wushuang only retreated, with his blood surging, while Lei Xin was shaken, his mouth spilling blood. He looked pale, and his aura was weaker than before.
