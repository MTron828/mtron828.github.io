Chapter 688: Exchanging Divine Gems

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

As time went by, there was only half a month left before the deadline passed.

Jian Wushuang had already killed 10 of his 11 targets.

The last one was the strongest, so Jian Wushuang deliberately left this one till last.

“Is that Hu Hu’s castle?”?Jian Wushuang stood with his arms crossed, overlooking the castle built from Amethyst in front of him.

This large castle was famous in the surrounding territory.

Many of the warriors in the surrounding territory knew that this was the residence of a Divine Realm expert of great strength, Hu Hu.

Hu Hu had lived in the castle for many years and his fame had spread far and wide.

He was very clever, he knew that this territory was ruled by Ancient Sect and he would be targeted and killed by Ancient Sect if he committed a crime here. Therefore, although he had been overbearing to the weak, he had never violated the rules of Ancient Sect.

Over the years, he has lived peacefully and had never come into conflict with the Ancient Sect.

Not long ago, however, Ancient Sect discovered that one thousand years ago, Hu Hu cooperated with another expert and killed an Ancient Sect disciple for a treasure. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

No one witnessed how they killed the Ancient Sect disciple and they had covered it up well; thus, Ancient Sect had never connected him with the disciple’s death for the past thousand years.

However, the expert who cooperated with Hu Hu was caught by the Ancient Sect and he revealed everything to save his life.

“On the surface, he’s respectful toward Ancient Sect and never violates Ancient Sect’s rules, but he actually dares to kill our disciple. This Divine Realm expert is really smart,”?Jian Wushuang smiled coldly.

Among his 11 targets, 10 had committed severe crimes within the territory ruled by Ancient Sect. Ancient Sect set them as targets because it didn’t want too many conflicts within its territory. But the case with Hu Hu was different.

What Hu Hu had done was unforgivable, he dared to kill an Ancient Sect disciple; therefore, he must die!

“Although Hu Hu is the most important one, it will not be easy to kill him,”?Jian Wushuang thought.

Based on the information he received, although Hu Hu was only an advanced Divine Realm expert, he was definitely one of great strength. He was much stronger than Bing Yi and other advanced Divine Realm experts killed by Jian Wushuang. In addition, as he had lived longer, he would certainly have more skills or trump cards to save his life.

“Anyway, I will go say hello to him first. I heard that Hu Hu enjoys a leisurely lifestyle,”?Jian Wushuang smiled, heading directly toward the castle.

In the innermost area of the huge Amethyst castle, there was a grand hall. A middle-aged man with bare feet and loose robe which showed his abdominal muscles was lying comfortably on a crystal bed. Two beautiful maids were serving him, and many beautiful maids were dancing in the center of the hall.

Except for these maids, he was the only one in the whole hall. With a pleasant look on his ruddy face, he was enjoying a drink.

This man was Hu Hu. As Jian Wushuang said, he did lead a life of leisure. He had become an advanced Divine Realm expert long ago, so he had become a local tyrant in the surrounding territory. No one dared to challenge him. He only needed to be cautious and not to violate Ancient Sect’s rules.

Although he secretly broke some of the rules, he had covered them up so well that no one had ever accused him of anything.

While Hu Hu was enjoying himself, a servant outside the hall rushed in, knelt down and spoke respectfully, “My Lord, a man with an Ancient Sect inner disciple token came and asked to see you.”

“Ancient Sect inner disciple?” Hu Hu was a little surprised and his face immediately turned pale. He waved his hand to indicate the maids in the hall to leave.

“I have always respected Ancient Sect and never violated any of its rules. In addition, I seldom have contact with people in Ancient Sect. Why would an Ancient Sect disciple come to visit me?”?Hu Hu frowned and thought,?“Has Ancient Sect discovered what I did?”

He had committed far more than one crime in secret, but he had gotten away with it so far.

“Did the Ancient Sect disciple give his name?” Hu Hu asked.

“No,” replied the servant, then he shook his head as he said, “I can tell that he’s just a Skyscraping Realm expert.”

“Skyscraping Realm?” Hu Hu was a little surprised and then relaxed, “It seems that he’s not coming to bother me, as a Skyscraping Realm expert is not qualified to do so. However, he is still an inner disciple of Ancient Sect, I’d better not to offend him.”

“Go, ask him to come in,” Hu Hu said.

“Yes,” said the servant and he left immediately.

Hu Hu stood up and straightened his robe.

Before long the servant led Jian Wushuang to the hall.

“You can leave now,” Hu Hu told the servant, waving a hand. The servant bowed and excused himself.

Only Hu Hu and Jian Wushuang stood in the hall. Hu Hu looked at Jian Wushuang and noticed his aura indicating that he was indeed a Skyscraping Realm expert.

“Haha, little brother, how should I address you? What can I do for you?” Hu Hu said quite enthusiastically.

“My name is Jian Wushuang,” Jian Wushuang answered indifferently, “I happened to pass by the surrounding territory and wanted to buy some treasures. Unfortunately, I’ve run out of Divine Gems, so I came to exchange something for Divine Gems with you.”

“Exchange Divine Gems?” Hu Hu was surprised but he did not doubt his words.

It was common for Warriors to exchange treasures for Divine Gems while on their adventures. However, the treasures were often so valuable or rare that it was not worth exchanging them in the stores, so the Warriors would exchange with experts who had sufficient Divine Gems.

“Jian Wushuang is an inner disciple of Ancient Sect, so he doesn’t worry about what I may do to him.”

Hu Hu smiled slightly and then asked, “My friend, what treasure do you want to exchange for Divine Gems?”

“This one,” Jian Wushuang produced a black gem.
