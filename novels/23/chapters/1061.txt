Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Bang!”

Jian Wushuang once again exchanged blows with Celestial Master Lei Yi on the drill ground.

The battle between two men who possessed the strength of a Celestial Master had caused significant damage to the ground.

The remaining wave had a terrifyingly destructive power. The surface of drill ground was lifted as if doomsday had arrived.

“Go to hell!”

Lei Yi waved his two purple spears at the same time and the enormous Purple Thunderbolt turned into thunderclouds that immediately covered thousands of miles. Soon, the thunderclouds moved toward Jian Wushuang.

“Break!”

Jian Wushuang turned into a powerful, sharp sword.

Unleashing his strong Sword Essence, he pulled out his Blood Mountain Sword and used the Heaven’s Bane.

“Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!”

The explosive sounds of a frightening roar and energy colliding resounded continuously in the Void.

This time, a great number of experts from the influential clans had come to attend the inauguration ceremony of the new Supervisor. They now watched the battle unfold with a startled look.

No one expected that Jian Wushuang would dare start a fight at the ceremony.

Moreover, he was just an Eternal Realm expert whose opponent was a famous Celestial Master. They were evidently not at the same level but he still dared to attack Lei Yi without hesitation.

“What a brave lad!”

The crowd admired Jian Wushuang’s courage.

He was even more unruly than Patriarch of Empyrean Glory.

Proud and unruly as Patriarch of Empyrean Glory was, he wouldn’t dare to take the initiative to challenge a Celestial Master while still in the Eternal Realm.

Not only did Jian Wushuang dare make the first attack, but he also managed to frighten the rest with his overwhelming power.

“Celestial Master! His battle strength must have reached the level of a Celestial Master!”

“Oh, God! To think that an Eternal Realm expert and a Celestial Master would be so well-matched that neither can gain the upper hand!”

“Could…. Could I be dreaming?” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Most of the experts couldn’t help expressing their amazement.

They could hardly believe what they were witnessing.

They had been shocked when they learned that Jian Wushuang was still alive after taking three blows from Patriarch of Empyrean Glory.

Shocked as they were, they could accept it for they had assumed that Jian Wushuang survived thanks to the protection of some treasure with incredible defensive power.

The only thing that battle could prove was that Jian Wushuang had a knack for staying alive. No one recognized his real strength in that battle.

Today, however, he fought Lei Yi head-on and didn’t fall into a state of disadvantage. This indicated that he had acquired the battle strength of a Celestial Master.

“The strength of an Eternal Realm expert rivals a Celestial Master’s?”

The experts were in disbelief.

“That brat…”?Patriarch of Empyrean Glory narrowed his eyes and clenched his fists tighter.

Many experts turned to look at him with complicated glances.

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory had tried to kill Jian Wushuang 120 years ago but the latter remained alive after suffering three of his full-strength blows. News of their battle had long been spread far and wide.

Back then, Jian Wushuang hadn’t been a worthy opponent for Patriarch of Empyrean Glory. The latter had known that Jian Wushuang was just at the Level of Rank Three Dao Master, close to a common Dao Master’s strength at most.

Yet look at what Jian Wushuang was capable of right now.

Jian Wushuang had gained the battle strength of a real Celestial Master in 120 years, his power reaching the middle level. Lei Yi had strong battle strength among the Celestial Masters, after all.

“He’s terrifying. This kid’s talent is too terrifying!”?Patriarch of Empyrean Glory sighed with emotion.

Jian Wushuang remained locked in a fierce battle with Lei Yi on the battlefield. He appeared in front of Lei Yi as abruptly as a ghost, his eyes glinting. Then, he furiously thrust his sword.

A terrifying force tore the space ruthlessly.

“What?”

Lei Yi frowned. He could sense that this strike was much more powerful than the one before it.

“Is he using his unique skill?”?

Lei Yi sneered as he thrust his two purple spears straight toward the sky.

A sharp sound of an explosion immediately reverberated.

This was Lei Yi’s strongest technique—Thunder Explosion!

“Bang!”

The earth trembled and things fell silent.

The space where the two forces met had already shattered.

“Humph!”

The overwhelming power penetrated his Blood-killing Plate Armor and whatever power remained entered his body. He felt his internal Qi and blood running wild and subsequently spat out a mouthful of blood.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes remained grim, displaying the anger deep within.

“Explode!”

With a fierce roar, Jian Wushuang triggered the power concealed in his sword. The power burst out and formed a second layer of strength.

“Oh no!”

There was a dramatic change in Lei Yi’s expression. The terrifying power hit him instantaneously, causing him to tremble violently and spit out blood. His aura diminished sharply as he was forced backward, making him a pathetic sight to behold.

This breathtaking fight that lasted for only several breaths finally came to an end.

Lei Yi had retreated to the very edge of the drill ground. He started at Jian Wushuang in awe as he clutched his chest. Jian Wushuang still wore a cold look.

The outcome astounded the experts from different clans.

It was shocking enough Jian Wushuang and Lei Yi had been equally matched, but now…

it was evident that Jian Wushuang had defeated Celestial Master Lei Yi! Their astonishment was beyond words.

To think that an Eternal Realm expert beat a Celestial Master in the field!

This was an explosive and shocking piece of news!

“Fortunately I had not desperately wanted him dead. I couldn’t take his life then, but now, he can definitely kill me!”?Patriarch of Empyrean Glory mused as he stared fixedly at Jian Wushuang.

He had completely given up on the thought of avenging his son.

Suddenly, an angry voice resounded. “What are you doing?”

Several figures came flying toward them from a distance. They were experts from the Samsara Temple, including two Elders. Jian Wushuang recognized one of them to be Ding Mo.

Now that the experts from the Samsara Temple had arrived, they could no longer continue their fight. The other experts continue to give Jian Wushuang strange looks.

After all, he was the one who started the fight.

“What’s going on?”

Ding Mo stood in the center of the field, looking around the drill ground with a frown. His gaze eventually settled on Jian Wushuang and Lei Yi.

“Jian Wushuang, Celestial Master Lei Yi, please explain yourselves.”
