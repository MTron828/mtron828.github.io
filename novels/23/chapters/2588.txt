Jian Wushuang glanced at Mo Shan but did not mean to blame him. Mo Shan had been quite alert and reacted promptly after all.

“The Demon has the combat power of a Primary-level Earth Ultimate God and was able to battle head-on with the military formation formed by two battalions. However, his strength must have become stronger after consuming the soul power of so many soldiers. If he’s allowed to continue his killing spree and consume the souls so unscrupulously, I’m afraid he’ll soon be peerless in Northern Darkstar Territory,” said Jian Wushuang in a low voice.

After a while, he made a decision.

“All of you stay here. I’ll go handle the Demon myself,” said Jian Wushuang directly.

“Territorial Lord, are you going alone?” Cang Heng frowned.

“Territorial Lord, that demon especially with soul attack is very powerful.” Mo Shan reminded Jian Wushuang.

“Master...” Xiao Tiexin also looked over with a worried expression.

“Don’t worry, just leave it to me.” Jian Wushuang smiled confidently as his figure moved and had already swept toward the ancient forest ahead alone.

Cang Heng, Mo Shan, and others stayed there as they were told.

“Do you think the Territorial Lord can kill that Demon?” Mo Shan asked in a strange tone.

“Master is very cautious. He must be sure since he dared to go alone. Even if he can’t kill the Demon, the Demon probably can’t do any harm to him either. Don’t forget the Master is our Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord,” said Xiao Tiexin.

“That’s right. The Territorial Lord is very powerful.” Mo Shan nodded.

The others also had a lot of confidence in Jian Wushuang.

The Territorial Lord was the top expert in Northern Darkstar Territory after all and even if the Territorial Lord could not do anything to the Demon—the Demon must be completely peerless in the Northern Darkstar Territory.

...

In the vast ancient forest.

Jian Wushuang slowly advanced dressed in a golden robe and carrying a longsword. He had fully displayed his soul power which covered a large area around him in search of the Demon’s traces.

However, the ancient forest was huge and Jian Wushuang needed time to search the entire forest by himself.

Moreover, Jian Wushuang might not even be able to find him if the demon was nearby and did not take the initiative to show up.

An expert who is good at soul attack was capable of hiding his breath of power after all.

In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang had spent most of the day walking around in the ancient forest.

Inside an underground cave that was made recently deep in the ancient forest.

There was a thin old man in a black robe with a cold expression sitting in there quietly as a golden bead was suspended in the void in front of him.

The golden bead was a Soul Golden Bead which contained a lot of soul power.

Soul power that was forcibly extracted from those Official Army soldiers. The soul power was gushing out from the golden bead and refined before the old man absorbed them.

The color of the Soul Golden Bead dimmed with moments.

The cold-looking old man opened his eyes with a wicked smile appearing on his face.

“Peak Earth Ultimate God. Hehe, my soul power has finally recovered to Peak Earth Ultimate God realm. It’s not very far from my peak. My soul power should be fully recovered so long I can kill the remaining Official Army and absorb their soul power. I don’t need to stay in such a small place to absorb these Divine Demon and ordinary Ultimate God’s soul power anymore when that happens.

“I have to be more careful and don’t provoke those two people again until I’ve recovered. Otherwise...” The cold-looking old man held his hands together.

As Jian Wushuang speculated, the cold-looking old man was indeed someone mighty.

He was a real Heaven Ultimate God!

Unfortunately, he was an assassination target not long ago and had to use some secret techniques to save his life. Due to that, his strength was drastically reduced which led to him needing to absorb a large amount of soul power to recover his strength. His soul power had since been restored to the Peak Ultimate God realm.

At that cultivation realm, he was almost peerless in any ordinary Stellar Region.

Suddenly...

“Hmm?”

The cold-looking old man abruptly raised his head and moved his eyes as though he was surprised.

He noticed someone had broken into the area covered by his soul power and was searching for him using their soul power but unfortunately could not find him.

“This person is a bit weird. I can’t even sense his strength.”

The cold-looking man instantly became vigilant and carefully observed the person.

“A golden robe? Carrying a longsword? He’s not one of the two who chased after me before and is dressed like the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord mentioned by the Official Army, isn’t he? Yes, he’s indeed the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord.” The old man smiled.

He overheard the Official Army soldiers talking about Jian Wushuang when they scattered around and searched for him. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

He was almost certain that the person was indeed Jian Wushuang from knowing some of Jian Wushuang’s appearance and characteristics before seeing the actual person appearing in his soul power’s range.

“Hehe, the Territorial Lord is nothing more than just an Earth Ultimate God. If he came a little earlier when my soul power has not recovered to the Earth Ultimate God Realm, he’ll probably be a big threat to me, but now...he’s no different than someone who came to die.” The cold-looking old man coldly smiled.

Earth Ultimate God?

At his peak, he would never pay attention to one.

Even when he had yet recovered his strength at his peak, he was no longer threatened by Regular or even a High-level Earth Ultimate God.

Naturally, he was not bothered by the mere Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord.

“I hear those soldiers said the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord seems to have an amazing protective armor which is suspected to be in the ranks of a Heavenly Treasure.” The cold-looking old man smiled menacingly as his figure flashed and floated out toward the ground above.

On the ground, Jian Wushuang was sauntering forward.

After half of the day, his soul power did not detect the Demon’s slightest trace but he was unperturbed.

He believed in his judgment where the demon needed to absorb a large amount of cultivator’s soul power to recover his strength and must still have remained in the ancient forest. He was uncertain if the demon dared to appear and face him.

Suddenly...

There were no signs or warnings such that even Jian Wushuang did not sense anything.

A tyrannical soul power came sweeping by.

The soul attack was strange and done silently before Jian Wushuang could do anything. The mighty soul power had already broken into his body and brutally attacked the soul within his sea of ​​consciousness.
