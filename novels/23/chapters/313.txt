Chapter 314: Fighting Against Tan Feng Once More

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Come out!”

“Come out!”

Jian Wushuang’s shout echoed throughout the whole area, causing astonishment and fear from the numerous nearby experts.

Tan Feng, the Mansion Master of the Ninth Heaven Mansion?

He was the expert ranked 9th on the Bloodmoon List. Who dared to challenge him?

In a very large secret chamber, inside the Ninth Heaven Mansion, the old bald elder, Tan Feng, was surrounded by flashes of Gale and Thunderbolt.

Woosh! Woosh! Woosh!

Tan Feng’s figure constantly moved around the secret chamber, forming flashes of Gale and Thunderbolt, with numerous shadows erupting outwards.

Shortly after that, Tan Feng’s figure condensed.

“No, it’s not like this.”?Tan Feng slowly shook his head and exclaimed in his heart,?“No wonder the Wrath of Gale and Thunderbolt is a superior second-grade manual. I have meticulously studied for one month, just to find that I have not yet grasped the primary technique.”

The Wrath of Gale and Thunderbolt was the superior second-grade manual the Holy Emperor Palace had given to Tan Feng after he killed “Jian Wushuang”.

It is a manual related to a movement technique. But the superior second-grade manual was too profound. Although he had earnestly studied for one month, there was still a long way to go before he grasped it.

Just then...

“Tan Feng, come out!”

Jian Wushuang’s furious shout echoed throughout the area, so it was also heard in this secret chamber, which caused Tan Feng’s expression to become gloomy.

“Whoosh!”

Suddenly, Tan Feng’s figure appeared in the air above the Ninth Heaven Mansion. Immediately, he noticed Jian Wushuang, who was wearing a blood-red robe and a wicked blood-red mask, standing in front of him. Meanwhile, he also saw the corpse of the brown-haired man below.

“What’s wrong?” Tan Feng glanced at an expert from the Ninth Heaven Mansion beside him. He looked dignified rather than angry.

“Mansion Master, this man is Nan, ranked 36th on the Bloodmoon List. As soon as he arrived here, he said he was here to claim your life. Lord Long Xing infuriated, so he tried to drive him away. But, instead, he was killed with a single sword move,” An expert from the Ninth Heaven Mansion said respectfully.

“What?” Tan Feng narrowed his eyes and looked at Jian Wushuang. “A man who is only at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm boasted so much and even dared to kill one of my men? You really want to die!”

Tan Feng didn’t waste any more words.

An expert of the Saint Realm, especially a warrior like him, who had grasped a Domain, would generally keep his dignity and wouldn’t casually fight against weaker opponents, unless there was a huge benefit.

But, if someone actively come and challenged?him, the situation would be different.

“Little guy, go die!”

Tan Feng glanced at Jian Wushuang as he slowly reached out his hand. A rush of overwhelming force erupted from his fingertips, forming an invisible power that instantly rushed towards Jian Wushuang.

With a cold face, Jian Wushuang waved his right hand and a similarly powerful forced erupted.

A suffocating sound was heard and then the two forces separated and disappeared.

“What?” Tan Feng glanced at Jian Wushuang in astonishment. “It’s no wonder you were able to kill Long Xing with a single sword move! It seems that you really are qualified to challenge the mansion masters. But it’s a shame, you have chosen a wrong opponent!”

“There are 21 mansions in the Tang Dynasty, and also 21 mansion masters. Yet, you chose me! How stupid you are!”

“You will know if I’m stupid once we fight,” said Jian Wushuang. After which, he wasted no more words and began moving.

Tens of meters were passed in an instant. Jian Wushuang stood in front of Tan Feng with the Purple Sky Sword in his hand as a flash of sword light silently struck outwards.

When the sword light appeared, the whole world began trembling.

“Momentum? You’ve even comprehended it to the limit and can activate its full strength?” Tan Feng’s expression changed, but he was still smiling as he said, “However, it’s still not enough.”

Tan Feng just stood there as streaks of invisible waves radiated from him. The invisible waves covered everything for nearly 1000 meters, including Jian Wushuang. A great power immediately began suppressing him.

One month ago when Jian Wushuang had been trapped in Tan Feng’s Domain, the result had been very bad, but now...

Streaks of waves also erupted from Jian Wushuang’s body, containing an incredible killing intention that crazily spread out and instantly formed a Slaughter Domain.

“Domain?” Tan Feng began to feel astonished.

He had never thought Nan, who was wearing a wicked blood-red mask in front of him, could have comprehended a Domain while only at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm.

Both of them had comprehended a Domain. Both Domains crazily suppressed the enemy, so they were in a deadlock for some time, with neither one of them being able to defeat the other.

“You really do have some ability. It’s a shame though, you are still just a joke in front of me,” Tan Feng said with a sneer, then he finally began to move.

With only a single stride, he appeared in front of the flash of sword light. His palm, which looked like withered wood, slowly struck out. In that instant, the Domain he had spread began to shrink at incredible speed. And then, the power of the whole Domain gathered into his palm.

Boom!

The force from the sharp palm shattered the space and crashed head-on against the sword light from Jian Wushuang.

Peng!

Thump! Jian Wushuang was immediately forced to retreat nearly 100 meters before he could regain his balance.

“Stage two Domain?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Even for the same Domain, the level of comprehension could be different.

“Momentum” only required one-tenth of the Origin to be activated. Yet, activating nine-tenths or the full power of an Origin would still be called “Momentum.” However, their strengths were definitely different.

This was also true with Domains.

Domains had three levels. The first level was what Jian Wushuang had used. A Domain that could spread out and suppress the opponent.

The second level required gathering all the power of the Domain to one point and then endowing every move with the power of that Domain.

As for the third level, it required extreme comprehension of the Domain. A single thought was enough for the Domain to forcefully suppress the opponent’s spirit and consciousness. That was really horrifying! His father, Jian Nantian, was at that level. He could kill an expert of the Saint Realm with a single sword move by activating his Domain,?only because he had comprehended the Domain to such a high level.

“Stage two Domain. His every posture and movement carries the power of his Domain. If I do not use my trump cards, it will be very hard to kill him.”?Jian Wushuang thought to himself. He had an idea.

“In this case, let me directly use my trump cards and slaughter him!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes became cold. In the next instant, a blast of unprecedented killing intent abruptly erupted from his body.

Meanwhile, vast Spiritual Power began to surge.

“Asura Secret Skill, Road to the Underworld!”

With a low shout, a rolling killing intent and vast Spiritual power radiated from his body, directly transforming into a Blood River, silently rolling and surging. Gradually, streaks blood-red fog began to float by, like flickering ghost shadows. This Blood River appeared just like a road to the underworld.

The Blood River had covered the entire area, with Jian Wushuang and Tan Feng standing at the center of it.

“The loss of Spiritual Power is very rapid. My Spiritual Power will be exhausted in only twenty breathes.”

Feeling the fast consumption of Spiritual Power inside his body, Jian Wushuang turned up his hand and the Triple-kill Sword appeared. His eyes were so cold that he looked like a Death Shura.

“Twenty breathes is long enough to kill him!”
