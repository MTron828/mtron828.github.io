Chapter 275: The Bloodmoon Hotel

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“This is the only hotel in this city. A plaque like this hangs on the lintel of the door. The hotel must be unusual.”?Jian Wushuang thought while walking into the hotel. An attendant immediately came to greet him.

“Patron, are you here for accommodation or a meal?” the attendant asked with a smile.

“How many Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid does it cost for one night?” Jian Wushuang said casually.

“10 drops of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid for one night,” The attendant answered smilingly.

“Really expensive.” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but sigh.

Experts of the Yin-Yang Void Realm used Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid for exchange. Ordinary experts of the Initial Yin Void Realm owned about 100 drops of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid. If they stayed here for a night, it would cost 10 percent of all their possessions. It was expensive indeed. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Expensive?” The attendant shook his head with a smile. “Even one of our stools is worth a drop of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid. If someone messes up here and breaks our tables and stools, he would pay 100 times of that, that is to say, he will pay 100 drops of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid for a stool.”

“Tables deserve more. Pay 1000 drops of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid for a broken table, not to mention wine pots or wine bowls, so it doesn’t cost you much for a night. If someone starts a fierce fight in our hotel, he must pay quite more than that.”

On hearing this, Jian Wushuang was shocked.

One needed to pay 100 drops of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid if one broke a stool. Who would dare to fight in this hotel?

“There’s total chaos in the Tang Dynasty. Is there anyone that will pay?” Jian Wushuang asked casually.

“You must have just arrived at the Tang Dynasty, so you don’t know our Tang Dynasty.” The attendant smiled. “Yes, our Tang Dynasty is famous for slaughter and doesn’t have any bottom line. Actually, it depends on a rule: the law of the jungle.

“Our Bloodmoon Hotel is strong, so those that have a fierce fight in our hotel will have to pay for it.

“Of course, our hotel is also afraid of some top experts. They can refuse to pay, especially those experts on the Bloodmoon List.”

“What is the Bloodmoon List?” Jian Wushuang asked with curiosity.

“The Bloodmoon List is a strength-ranking list based on the information collected by our Bloodmoon Hotel. 1000 experts from 21 large prefectures in the whole Tang Dynasty are ranked on this list. The weakest is at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm, while the strongest is an expert of the Saint Realm. They’re the real top experts in the Tang Dynasty,” The attendant answered.

“1000 experts?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

I knew the Bloodmoon List was similar to the Earthly Dragon List and Heavenly Dragon List of the Tianzong Dynasty, but the Bloodmoon List was not based on Realm, but strength and Cultivation. Moreover, there were 1000 experts on the list.

In comparison, the number of people on the Earthly Dragon List and Heavenly Dragon List was just over 100.

“Patron, if you’re interested in the Bloodmoon List, you can spend some Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid on it. It costs 1000 drops of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid,” the attendant said with a smile.

“Ok, give me a copy of it.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He would slaughter in the Tang Dynasty, so he needed a good understanding of the 1000 top experts of the Tang Dynasty.

For an expert of Exceptional Yin Void Realm, 1000 drops of Purple Crystal Spiritual Liquid would be all their possessions, but it meant nothing for Jian Wushuang, since several experts at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm had died in his hands.

The attendant gave Jian Wushuang a thick copy of the list.

Jian Wushuang started to read it carefully.

It only recorded the 1000 top experts’ brief introduction, such as names, Cultivation of Spiritual Power and impressive battle results, but Jian Wushuang spent two hours reading it thoroughly.

Jian Wushuang could not help but acclaim. “There’re too many experts. The Tang Dynasty lives up to its name as the top empire of the Nanyang Continent.”

Among the 1000 experts, there were 26 experts of the Saint Realm.

The experts at the Half-saint Level accounted for 118 of the total number.

Others had reached the Peak of the Yang Void Realm, and quite a few experts had comprehended the Origin.

“Experts of the Saint Realm and the Half-saint Level definitely belong to the top in the whole Nanyang Continent, but in the Tang Dynasty, there’re a large number of such top experts.”?Jian Wushuang was shocked indeed.

There were only a few experts of the Saint Realm and the Half-saint Realm in the top sects, such as the Wilderness Sword Sect and the Daluo Heaven Sect. Yet the Tang Dynasty had 26 experts of the Saint Realm. What did this mean?

It was no wonder that Wang Yuan had said the Tang Dynasty was much more powerful than the eight top sects and even Alchemy School and Holy Emperor Palace held it in awe.

In fact, most of the Half-saint experts or experts at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm in Tang Dynasty came from the old sects in the Nanyang Continent.

The Tang Dynasty was considered as a place for training. Those who wanted to break through to the Saint Realm came here, so the Tang Dynasty had a considerable number of experts.

“It’s awesome. The Bloodmoon List is really awesome.” Jian Wushuang acclaimed. “Since this list is made by the Bloodmoon Hotel and holds absolute authority, the Bloodmoon Hotel must be the top force in the Tang Dynasty.”

The Earthly Dragon List and Heavenly Dragon List was set by Golden-dragon Palace, the first overlord in the Tianzong Dynasty.

After all, people were only convinced of the lists made by the real powerful forces.

The Bloodmoon Hotel could compile it, which proved its strength.

That was why the Bloodmoon Hotel dared to hang such a plaque.

“Besides the experts of the Saint Realm and the Half-saint experts, most of the 1000 experts are at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm and might be stronger than Mo Lingtian and Chen Feng that I had a fight with. I wonder what ranking I will have on the Bloodmoon List?”?Jian Wushuang thought with expectation.

At this moment, the footsteps came over. Then a purple-clothed woman surrounded by a group of figures stepped inside.

After walking into the hotel, the purple-clothed woman looked around and immediately fixed her eyes on Jian Wushuang.
