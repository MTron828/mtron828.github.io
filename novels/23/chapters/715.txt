Chapter 716: Xuan Yi’s Anger (Part 1)

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Finally, the two wormholes that connected to the Eternal Zone finished closing and completely disappeared from sight.

The whole area was filled with silence.

“Jian Wushuang didn’t come out?” The eight Eternal Real Experts from the Ancient Sect seemed confounded for a moment.

If someone didn’t leave the Eternal Zone in time, death was the only remaining possibility.

Even if he was not dead yet, the Eternal Zone would not be open for another hundred years. How could a person survive there for a hundred years?

Even experts of Eternal Realm like them would not make be able to survive there for that long.

“Shit.”

The eight Ancient Sect experts of Eternal Realm, including Feng, Liu Chong, and the other disciples, looked rather grim.

Even though, among the six Ancient Sect disciples who entered the Eternal Zone, Situ Yi also didn’t make it out in time, Jian Wushuang was much more important than Situ Yi.

Jian Wushuang was an incredibly peerless genius and the personal disciple of Xuan Yi. As long as he didn’t die early, he was almost guaranteed to reach the Eternal Realm and he even had a very good chance of becoming a Dao master.

But… Jian Wushuang had not exited from the Eternal Zone.

The surrounding experts from each Sect remained silent at this time, but they the looks they gave each other said everything.

“Good! Jian Wushuang died in the Eternal Zone. The Ancient Sect will definitely suffer a loss with his absence.”

“The Ancient Sect? The Ancient Sect may have suffered a loss, but the issue is that Jian Wushuang is a personal disciple of Xuan Yi. Now, with his youngest disciple dead, he might go crazy.”

“I think there is something odd about his death though.”

“Shush! We all understand, but we don’t dare to say it out loud. Let’s see what happens! Xuan Yi is not someone we can offend. Although he seems to be a good-tempered man who treats others kindly, he’s unstoppable when he becomes angry.”

The trip to the Eternal Zone had come to an end. However, the experts of the top Sects were in no hurry to leave because they were curious to see what would happen next.

They all knew that Xuan Yi would never let the death of Jian Wushuang with just that.

At this moment, many different ideas were racing through the minds of the three magnates.

In the area where the Boundless Demon Sect was…

“An Chao, did you kill Jian Wushuang?”

The Eternal Realm experts from the Boundless Demon Sect had gathered together and were looking at a pale-faced black-robed elder.

This black-robed person was the one who had chased Jian Wushuang into the inner layer of the Eternal Zone. He was An Chao, an Elder of the Boundless Demon Sect.

The arrow from Gu Yang had left a wound on him.

“I did injure him and even managed to kill his doppelganger, but I wasn’t able to confirm his death.”

An Chao frowned and said, “The kid had a remarkable Escape Skill. At the cost of burning his Spiritual Power, he was able to instantly increased his speed by a hundred times within a short period. Even while using my full power, I was only able to keep up with him. ”

“He eventually fled to the inner layer. I did follow after him, but I came across a Silver-armored Demon God in the Eternal Realm before I managed to kill him. The Silver-armored Demon God terrifyingly powerful, so I was forced to use my trump card just to survive.”

“So, what you’re saying is that you didn’t witness Jian Wushuang’s death, right?” Another Elder of the Boundless Demon Sect asked.

“Yes.” An Chao nodded and continued, “However, he’s definitely dead, he burned up all of his Spiritual Power and even started burning his blood.”

“Definitely dead?” The Elders of Boundless Demon Sect laughed.

An Elder said, “The Eternal Zone is already very dangerous, and he even entered the inner layer, which is a death trap. He has to be dead!”

“Yes. Those Demon Gods utterly hate us outsiders. There’s no doubt that they would kill him on sight,” The Elder beside him echoed.

“Hopefully,” An Chao nodded slightly, but there was an awful premonition hidden deep in his heart.

After all, he had seen Jian Wushuang working together with those Demon Gods to kill Wu Dao and the others.

But, other than Jian Wushuang, these Demon Gods hated all outsiders.

In the area where the Ancient Sect was, the eight Eternal Realm experts had gathered together. Palace Master Destruction began to inform the Sect that Jian Wushuang had not made it out of the Eternal Zone and he had just finished telling Xuan Yi.

After Xuan Yi heard the news, he was silent for a moment before quickly replying, “I see. My doppelganger will arrive soon. Before it gets there, make sure you don’t let any of the three magnates leave.”

“I understand.” Palace Master Destruction nodded.

After he finished delivering the news, Palace Master Destruction sighed in relief, but he could sense Xuan Yi’s anger in those last few words he said.

“It seems like someone is going to suffer a lot.”

Palace Master Destruction sighed while looking toward the experts of the three magnates with pity in his eyes, but he immediately spoke, “Everyone from Cloud Sea Asgard, the Immortal Dynasty, and the Boundless Demon Sect.”

After hearing his words, the experts of the three magnates had unnaturally fearful expressions on their faces.

Anyone who even knew a little about his past would be fearful of Palace Master Xuan Yi.

“Xuan Yi, he is the strongest Eternal Realm expert in the Firmament Territory.”

The elder from Cloud Sea Asgard, Lady Red, clasped both of her hands as various stories about Xuan Yi began to run through her mind.

“Literally, he is a Monster.”

“It’s very rare for him to personally make a move, but once he does, that person will not meet a good end no matter who they are.”

“No one knows how powerful he is because he has never used his full power. He’s always been an unfathomable and unpredictable individual.”

“Many years ago, our Palace Master came to blows with Xuan Yi. But, after that, our Palace Master ordered us not to offend Xuan Yi. As far as I know, our Palace Master merely fought with Xuan Yi’s doppelganger that time.”

“In addition, it is well-known that Yuan Yi is not the type to get angry easily. However, if provoked, he can create a massacre. More importantly, he usually defends his disciples.”

“Now, with his youngest disciple dead, even if he has no evidence that it was Cloud Sea Asgard that killed Jian Wushuang, he would not just let it go.”

Upon hearing his words, many experts of in Cloud Sea Asgard had an even grimmer expression on their faces.

In the Immortal Dynasty and the Boundless Demon Sect, the Eternal Realm experts also looked solemn.

At this moment, a figure suddenly appeared in the air above them. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

When she saw the figure suddenly appear, Lady Red Elder took a deep breath and she looked around. Then, a low and deep voice spread about.

“Everyone, prepare yourselves and make sure to stay behind me while we face Xuan Yi’s wrath.”
