Chapter 1870: Deliberately Made Things Difficult!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Just as Jian Wushuang looked at Lui Xianzi, she looked at Jian Wushuang as well. In her cold eyes, there was a flash of surprise but it disappeared very quickly.

“It’s an honor to receive Sword Emperor. Please forgive me for not travelling far to welcome you,” Emperor Sword Sect Master said.

Although he wanted Emperor Sword to forgive him, he spoke highly of himself and stayed seated and never stood when he was talking to Jian Wushuang, who was a more powerful figure. It was obvious that he didn’t care about Jian Wushuang.

“I am only a junior. How could I make Emperor Sword Sect Master welcome me personally?” Jian Wushuang smiled and wasn’t bothered.

“Hehe, I heard that Sword Emperor is decisive in killing people. Whoever offends you will end miserably. But from what it seems, you aren’t behaving as the rumors say. Sword Emperor is quite a friendly person,” Emperor Sword Sect Master said with a smile.

“Friendly?” Jian Wushuang smiled but didn’t say anything more.

“Sword Emperor, I wonder why you came to Emperor Sword Sect today?” Emperor Sword Sect Master finally asked.

“Emperor Sword Palace is going to open. I came here, of course, for Emperor Sword Palace’s Sword Principle Inheritance Token. This is my Sword Principle Inheritance Token,” Jian Wushuang took out his Sword Principle Inheritance Token.

The moment the surrounding experts saw the Sword Principle Inheritance Token, they were surprised.

Emperor Sword Sect Master saw it and he creased his eyebrows.

He knew that Jian Wushuang had come for Emperor Sword Palace but he hadn’t known that Jian Wushuang had a Sword Principle Inheritance Token.

The Sword Principle Inheritance Token was hard to get.

Among the Almighties there, only Luo Xianzi had a Sword Principle Inheritance Token. Everyone else didn’t have one.

“Emperor Sword Sect Master, I heard that I can enter Emperor Sword Palace to receive Sword Principle as long as I have Sword Principle Inheritance Token. I wonder if it’s true?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Sword Emperor, don’t worry.”

Emperor Sword Sect Master smiled, “Sword Principle Inheritance Token is the only proof to enter Emperor Sword Palace and receive Sword Principle, this is true. However, over the years, Emperor Sword Palace has been opened many times and the appearance of Sword Principle Inheritance Token is well-known to the public. Naturally, there are many people with wicked intentions who forged the Sword Principle Inheritance Token. The outer appearance and the aura are the same as the real one, but in actual fact, it might be an imitation.”

“Emperor Sword Sect Master, what you’re saying is that the Sword Principle Inheritance Token in my hand is fake?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes slightly.

The surrounding people gasped a breath of cold air and thought that Emperor Sword Sect Master had the guts to say nonsense.

There were genuine and imitated Sword Principle Inheritance Tokens, that was true.

However, firstly, forgery of Sword Principle Inheritance Token was very rare; Secondly, even if it was really forgery, it would at most be circulated in Eternal Chaotic World and be sold to people who didn’t know what it was at a high price. In other words, people who had more money than sense. Who would come to Emperor Sword Sect with a forged Sword Principle Inheritance Token?

Everyone knew that Emperor Sword Sect could differentiate true or false Sword Principle Inheritance Tokens. Under such circumstances, weren’t those who brought forged tokens asking to be snubbed?

Besides, if it was a Universe God or Real God who took out Sword Principle Inheritance Token, it might be a forged one.

However, the one who had taken out the Sword Principle Inheritance Token was Jian Wushuang!!!

How could Sword Emperor take out a forged item?

It was impossible, but Emperor Sword Sect Master had said so. It was obvious that he wanted to deliberately make it difficult for Jian Wushuang.

Emperor Sword Sect Master chuckled when he noticed Jian Wushuang’s change of expression. “Sword Emperor, don’t misunderstand me. I didn’t say that the Sword Principle Inheritance Token that you brought is fake, but Emperor Sword Palace only opens once every one million years and there is a limited quota. It’s best to be more careful.”

“Mm, you’re right,” Jian Wushuang looked calm. No one could guess his feelings. “If so, Emperor Sword Sect Master shall determine the authenticity of the Sword Principle Inheritance Token personally.”

Then, Jian Wushuang threw the Sword Principle Inheritance Token in his hand to Emperor Sword Sect Master.

Emperor Sword Sect Master caught it and spread his palm. He didn’t need to probe as he already knew that the Sword Principle Inheritance Token was real.

He had done it with the intention to make it difficult for Jian Wushuang but he didn’t expect Jian Wushuang to give him the Sword Principle Inheritance Token directly. Wouldn’t Jian Wushuang be worried that he would pull some tricks on Sword Principle Inheritance Token so it would become fake?

“Hehe, Sword Emperor’s Sword Principle Inheritance Token is true,” Emperor Sword Sect Master chuckled and he passed Sword Principle Inheritance Token back to Jian Wushuang.

“As you have checked the authenticity of the token, can I enter Sword Emperor Palace now?”Jian Wushuang asked coldly.

“Yes, of course. But Sword Emperor should know that Emperor Sword Palace is controlled by Emperor Sword Sect as well. Among the five Sword Principle Inheritance Tokens, there are three tokens that Emperor Sword Sect took the initiative to distribute, including the one in Sword Emperor’s hand. Since Emperor Sword Sect has offered such a great opportunity, we, of course, expect things in return,” Emperor Sword Sect Master squinted his eyes and smiled at Jian Wushuang.

“Of course, I know that. I wonder what is the price that Emperor Sword Sect Master would like me to pay?” Jian Wushuang looked calm.

There was no free lunch in the world. Jian Wushuang knew that concept really well.

Emperor Sword Sect controlled Emperor Sword Palace and they took the initiative to send out Sword Principle Inheritance Token. Their purpose of doing so was to receive sufficient benefits. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The experts who had visited Emperor Sword Sect, even those who didn’t have Sword Principle Inheritance Tokens but could receive meager Sword Principles had to pay a price too.

“Emperor Sword Sect isn’t asking for much. To Sword Emperor, it is nothing. Three attack divine weapons and one defense armor,” Emperor Sword Sect Master smiled.

“That simple?”

Jian Wushuang lifted his head to look at Emperor Sword Sect Master. He flipped his hand and took out three Real God limited Chaotic Unique Treasure level divine weapons and a Real God limited Chaotic Unique Treasure level defense armor.

“I wonder if Emperor Sword Sect Master is happy with these items?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Real God limited Chaotic Unique Treasure was valuable too. The total of four treasures should be worth more than thirty thousand Doctrine Gems. It was already considered a costly price.

However, Emperor Sword Sect Master looked at the three divine weapons and set of armor in disdain and said, “I think Sword Emperor misunderstood me. The divine weapon and armor that I mentioned aren’t Unique Treasures but… Chaotic Divine Treasures!!”

“What?” Everyone in the hall was shocked.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes dilated in shock when he heard what Emperor Sword Sect Master said.
