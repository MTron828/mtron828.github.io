Chapter 2084 The Succession Ceremony

The news took the entire special tribe domain by storm since it was released.

Countless experts were curious, this new Emperor of the Ancient God Clan, who was he, how much did he have within him to be affirmed by King Chen Xing and take the throne?

The invitation that was sent out was accepted by all the clans.

No one would refuse it, nor did anyone dare to.

After so many years, the Ancient God Clan was finally having their coronation ceremony. Furthermore there was a personal invitation from them? Who would dare disrespect them by not attending?

Even the God Eater Clan and Black Dragon Clan of the elite clans agreed immediately, with their leaders making their way over on time.

All that was left was that Sky Swallowing Clan.

The Sky Swallowing Sanctuary, was as boundless as the Ancient God Sanctuary.

And who owned the Sky Swallowing Sanctuary? Of course it was the Sky Swallowing Clan!

The Sanctuary may have held many special tribes, but they had all surrendered to the Sky Swallowers.

A dark void.

This void was in the deepest depths of the Sky Swallowers’ lair, blanketed with several sealing formations. No one could enter undetected.

Just then within the void, a relatively arrogant young man with an eagle-like nose stood.

That arrogant man may have looked young, but he was in fact an old monster. How old? No one knew.

This man was the verified leader of the Sky Swallowing Clan, by the name of Ba Su.

“Coronation ceremony of the Ancient God Emperor? A new Ancient God Emperor at this juncture?” the arrogant man Ba Su had an abnormal smile on his face.

“According to what we received, this new Emperor comes from the human tribe, and a member of the Sanctuary Alliance as well, by the name of Jian Wushuang. He’s known as the Sword Emperor.” A black-robed mysterious man stood beside Ba Su.

“Sword Emperor? Human? Haha, maybe old age has muddled with King Chen Xing’s mind for him to get a human to become Ancient God Clan’s emperor.” Ba Su could not help but snigger.

“Mister Ba Su, we better not underestimate this Sword Emperor, he did real damage to my Acheron Palace. If he didn’t destroy the Dark Millstone, my Palace wouldn’t be in such a mess,” the black-robed man replied coldly.

“If he had not destroyed the millstone, you wouldn’t need to collaborate with the Sky Swallowing Clan, I suppose,” Ba Su glared at the black-robed man.

The black-robed man kept his silence. He did not deny it.

If the Dark Millstone was still operational, the Three Emperor World and its allies would crush the Eternal Chaotic World with a snap of the finger. All that resisted would be slaughtered effortlessly, experts would not need to come down to the Sky Swallowing Sanctuary either.

“Mister Ba Su, you must believe that we of the Archelon Palace are sincere,” the black-robed man replied. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Relax, if I didn’t believe it, you would be dead by now,” Ba Su laughed coldly. “Now that the Ancient God Clan has personally delivered to me their invitation, it’s a must that I attend the ceremony. I’m afraid our plans will need to halt for the time being.”

“If my predictions are correct, that Sword Emperor’s using the ceremony to get more clans to follow the Sanctuary Alliance against us Three Emperors World,” the black-robed man said.

“Perhaps, but with me around? That won’t be easy. If we’re lucky, their effort may work in our favour instead.” Ba Su laughed coldly, his eyes visibly ruthless.

…

A month passed by.

The coronation ceremony was finally about to begin.

It was to happen in the main hall, packed with leaders and experts from all tribes and clans.

These people had finally gotten to meet this new Ancient God Emperor.

But the Emperor was completely different from what they had predicted.

He looked more human than Ancient God, but the aura of unyielding authority over other

Ancient Gods remained, and was the real deal.

The ceremony happened sequentially. Everything was settled within two hours.

After the ceremony was over, the Ancient God Clan hosted a grand feast.

During this feast, there were more experts from other tribes than there were from the Ancient God Clan themselves.

With a glance one could see that there were more than a thousand men.

These thousand men, each of them at least an Almighty, behind them each was an impressive tribe.

Of course, only the people who had attained Almighty levels and above could attend the feast. Those weaker tribes without Almighties were not even invited. After all, they would be useless in the battle against the Three Emperors World.

At the centre of the feast sat the star of the feast, Jian Wushuang. He looked down.

“Everyone.”

As Jian Wushuang spoked, the noise and ruckus below immediately stopped.

“The reason I have invited you all today is for everyone here to bear witness to this succession ceremony.”

“But also, there is something I need to discuss with everyone here. It regards the lives and deaths of everyone here.” The crowd started to murmur.

Many experts frowned upon hearing what Jian Wushuang said.

But more of them showed no change in expression.

They had long guessed the true intention of this feast.

“Ancient Emperor, may I ask, this issue you mention, is it the same issue the Sanctuary Alliance messaged all of us about?” One man below asked.

“That is correct,” Jian Wushuang nodded. “Most of you should have received the message before, and should understand the situation the Eternal Chaotic World is undergoing right now.”

“From the Holocaust Sect, to the Achelon Palace, and now the Three Emperors World. They have formed an alliance, with the Three Emperors World leading it. This is too big a threat against our Eternal Chaotic World. They obviously intend to destroy this entire world. At this juncture, the experts amongst us must gather together to resist, and put up a fight together if need be!”

“If we still treat this lightly, by the time the enemy strikes, it will be too late for us to even form an alliance by then.”
