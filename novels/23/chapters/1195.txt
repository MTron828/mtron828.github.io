Chapter 1196: The Announcement of the Great War

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

There were a large number of people standing on a large empty ground within the Green Fire Palace.

Not long ago, the Master of Samsara Temple ordered that all the Holy Masters of the palace gather here.

Whether they were in the palace, out adventuring on the battlefield, or cultivating behind closed doors, the Holy Masters came to this spot as swiftly as possible.

Most of them were confused and doubtful of the reason for their gathering.

“What’s going on?”

“They gathered all the Holy Masters, even those out on the battlefield.”

“Look. Isn’t that Holy Master Yun?”

“It’s really him! That’s the oldest existence in our Green Fire Palace. Moreover, he has shut himself in without seeing anyone for a long time. To think that even he would show up.”

“Something must have happened for them to call for such a large-scale gathering. Could it be a war against the Jin Kingdom?”

The empty ground was abuzz with discussion.

“Swoosh! Swoosh!” Suddenly, two persons appeared in the Void in front of the empty ground.

These two were the Master of Samsara Temple and the Master of Void Temple.

“Greetings, Master of Samsara Temple, Master of Void Temple.”

The Holy Masters gathered on the empty ground immediately paid their respects.

The Master of Samsara Temple and the Master of Void Temple exchanged looks.

“Let’s begin,” the Master of Void Temple said.

“Hm.” The Master of Samsara Temple nodded. He then addressed the crowd in a?booming voice, saying, “Everyone, there’s only one reason behind this gathering today!”

“I’m sure many of you have already guessed this reason, that is, a war is about to break out between the Green Fire Palace and the Jin Kingdom!”

These words swept the Holy Masters on the empty ground like wildfire.

“The war is here, as expected!” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“It’s finally here! I wonder if it’s our side or the other side who waged the war.”

“Since our forces are a little weaker than the forces of the Jin Kingdom, logic dictates that the Jin Kingdom is the one to incite the war.”

“Humph! This Jin Kingdom sure is audacious. Even with our weaknesses, we ultimately still won the war against them five million years ago. And they dare wage a war against us now that our forces are not much weaker than theirs? They’re really digging their own graves, aren’t they?”

Many of the Holy Masters began gearing up for a fight.

The Green Fire Palace and the Jin Kingdom had a long history of enmity. Aside from the war five million years ago, there had been countless battles between the two. The grudge accumulated over the years was unimaginably deep.

Many of them had lost their friends to the Jin Kingdom. Naturally, they sought revenge against the latter.

The Master of Samsara Temple and the Master of Void Temple both secretly shook their heads after seeing the current scene.

“Everyone, this wouldn’t be an ordinary war. It involves the life and death of the entire Green Fire World. Any mishap and our domain will be completely annihilated,” the Master of Samsara Temple said solemnly.

“What?” Many of the Holy Masters on the empty ground raised their heads to look at him.

To them, the current strength of the Green Fire Palace was enough for them to block the attacks of the Jin Kingdom. Why would the situation worsen to the point that their survival would be at stake?

The Master of Samsara Temple did not elaborate. With a wave of his hand, a scene began playing in the Void in front of him.

Naturally, the scene was of the immense tunnel outside the battlefield as well as the spaceship slowly traveling inside of it.

“What’s that?”

The Holy Masters appeared alarmed to see the spaceship depicted in the scene.

“You’ve all seen this.”

The Master of Samsara Temple continued solemnly, “This spaceship is just the reinforcement of the Jin Kingdom but also its main force. It’s personally manned by the supreme Monarch of the kingdom. It’s now in the Void outside the battlefield and it’ll take at most 80 years before it arrives!”

“When the time comes, the spaceship under the command of the Monarch of Jin Kingdom will certainly incite a war that will destroy our Green Fire World!”

“And this war will be even more dangerous for us than the one five million years ago!”

“What?” Many Holy Masters on the ground were dumbfounded.

The Green Fire Palace and the entire Green Fire World had paid an unimaginable price for winning the war five million years ago. Countless experts gave their lives to block the attacks from the Jin Kingdom.

Back then, the Green Fire World was already toeing the line between life and death.

But this war will be even more dangerous?

A considerable amount of Holy Masters began to dread the upcoming war.

“I don’t wish to scare you but there are things that I must inform you all,” the Master of Samsara Temple said in a booming voice.

“This war is different from the one five million years ago. This time, the Jin Kingdom will come prepared. In fact, they will even come full force to wipe out our Green Fire World to make it easier to occupy the battlefield. In my conservative estimates, they have brought at least several times the number of experts they brought five million years ago. Moreover, their Monarch who is considered a supreme expert above the Universe Master level will command them personally!”

“In our palace, and even in the entire domain, we don’t have any peak experts who can contend with the Monarch of Jin Kingdom!”

The Holy Masters on the empty ground immediately paled after hearing his words.

“There will be several times more experts this time than the war five million years ago?”

“The Monarch of Jin Kingdom will personally come here?”

“How can our Green Fire Palace resist such a terrifying force?”

“We’re done for! This is the end for our Green Fire World!”

Shrill voices that carried alarm reverberated in the empty ground.

Many of the Holy Masters wore expressions of defeat.

This was only to be expected. The forces of the Jin Kingdom this time was too formidable.

Furthermore, there would be several times more experts who would arrive this time compared to five million years ago!

It had been a great struggle to resist the Jin Kingdom then, but there was now even more Jin Kingdom experts who would soon storm their domain.

Moreover, the Monarch would be personally leading the Jin Kingdom experts.

What could the Green Fire Palace do to resist them?

The Master of Samsara Temple and the Master of Void Temple took in the expressions of the Holy Masters on the empty ground. Their own faces darkened a little.

This was precisely what they worried about the most.

This was merely an announcement of the upcoming war, not the war itself, and yet the Green Fire Palace experts were already in such a state of panic and fear. In fact, some already felt hopeless. When the forces of Jin Kingdom descend on them, they would truly be in a vulnerable state.

“Humph!”

The Master of Samsara Temple suddenly let out a loud sneer that exerted a heavy pressure on the Holy Masters underneath.

The Holy Masters could not help quivering under such pressure and all of them began to shut their mouths.
