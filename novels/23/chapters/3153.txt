Chapter 3156: The Prophet

——

“I wanted to have a good fight with the Purple Cloud Pavilion in this territory, but now it seems that it won’t work,” Jian Wushuang thought.

The three Saint Realms had already known of his existence, so they would immediately send a large number of experts to kill him. If he stayed in the territory controlled by the Purple Cloud Pavilion, he would be courting death!

“I must leave immediately and hide my identity. I must never use the name of Heavenly Sword Marquis again.” Jian Wushuang had a clear plan in his heart.

He immediately set off.

In the dark void and the dark earth, there was an ancient altar in the center. The altar was covered with all kinds of strange secret patterns.

A skinny hunchbacked old man in a black robe stood there with a black snakehead walking stick, looking down at the mysterious runes under his feet.

At this moment…whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Several figures flew over from the void and landed on the altar in the blink of an eye.

“Lord Prophet.”

The leading woman in black bowed before speaking respectfully.

The hunchbacked old man holding the snake-headed walking stick raised his head and glanced at the black-robed woman. “Is there something the matter?”

“We are here under the orders of the Sorcerer God. We would like to ask you to help us find a rank four True Saint named Heavenly Sword Marquis,” the black-robed woman said. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Find someone?” The hunchbacked old man’s turbid gaze narrowed slightly. “It’s just a name. Even the power of the Divine Beginning Realm’s Heavenly Dao will probably not be able to find it, right?”

“Of course it’s not just a name.” The black-robed woman smiled. She then waved her hand, and a black-robed man walked up from behind her.

“Greetings, Lord Prophet.” This black-robed man was only a rank four True Saint. When he faced the black-robed woman, he was already trembling. Now, in front of this hunchbacked old man, he was even more terrified.

After all, the hunchbacked old man was a legendary super existence. In the Sorcerer God sect, his status was second only to the Sorcerer God.

“Prophet, this man has met Heavenly Sword Marquis once, and he has a deep impression of him,” the black-robed woman said.

This black-robed man was one of the few rank four True Saints who had participated in the assassination of Xiong Tao.

At that time, they mainly wanted to assassinate Xiong Tao, but they met Jian Wushuang, so naturally, they did not succeed.

“Is that so?” The hunchbacked elder nodded slightly. Then he immediately looked at the black-robed man, who was only a rank four True Saint, and a strange power swept out.

“My Lord, what are you doing?” The black-robed man, who was a rank four True Saint, was shocked.

“Don’t resist,” the hunchbacked elder shouted in a low voice, but the strange power had already surged into the black-robed man’s body.

“No!” The black-robed man let out a mournful howl, but his expression quickly calmed down and his eyes closed.

“I’ve already found the memory of Heavenly Sword Marquis,” the hunchbacked old man said. At the same time, the life force of the rank four True Saint was completely cut off, his body fell down powerlessly.

No one cared about the death of this rank four True Saint.

The black-robed woman looked at the hunchbacked old man expectantly. “Lord Prophet, Lord Sorcerer God places great importance on Heavenly Sword Marquis. Can you use this person’s memory to find Heavenly Sword Marquis’ location?”

“Let’s give it a try.”

The hunchbacked old man said and then closed his eyes.

The black-robed woman knew that the hunchbacked old man was already using his technique, so she did not dare to disturb him.

After a moment…

“Oh?”

The hunchbacked old man’s eyes suddenly opened, and a trace of shock flashed through his eyes. Following that, with a ‘pu’ sound, a large mouthful of blood was suddenly spat out, and the aura on his body instantly became extremely weak.

“Lord Prophet? What exactly is going on?” The black-clothed woman was also greatly shocked and hurriedly asked.

The hunchbacked old man raised his head, but his gaze was extremely cold. The expression on his face was also uncertain.

“Let me ask you, who is the Heavenly Sword Marquis that the old Sorcerer God is looking for?” The hunchbacked old man said coldly.

“This…I don’t know either, but from the orders given by the Lord Sorcerer God, he should place great importance on this Heavenly Sword Marquis. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have asked me to invite you, Lord Prophet,” the black-robed woman said carefully.

“Humph!” The hunchbacked elder snorted and said, “That old guy is so easy. Just give me a command, and I’ll be in trouble.”

“Sir Prophet, what are you…” The black-clothed woman was puzzled.

“The Heavenly Sword Marquis you’re looking for has an extraordinary background. I used the path of fate to search for him based on the memory of the rank four True Saint just now, but I actually suffered a backlash from the principles of fate. Not only did I suffer a serious injury, but from now on, I won’t be able to use the power of the principles of fate for 100,000 years,” the hunchbacked elder said.

“What?” The black-clothed woman was shocked.

The law of fate…if ordinary cultivators, including Jian Wushuang, heard this word, they would be extremely puzzled.

Therefore, in their understanding, the principles of heaven and earth did not have the so-called principles of fate.

But in fact, the principles of fate existed. It was just that in the Divine Beginning World, almost no one cultivated it, so ordinary cultivators were naturally not qualified to come into contact with it.

And this hunchbacked old man, who was also the Lord Prophet that the black-clothed woman mentioned, was a super expert who specialized in the principles of fate.

“My usage of the laws of fate has long reached the peak of perfection. In addition, by chance, I obtained a unique secret technique of the principles of fate in the cosmic battlefield. With the clear fate within, it’s easy to find a person’s trace. Even if I were to find some special life forms or some top existences in the world, I wouldn’t have to endure the backlash of the laws of fate, or the backlash would be very light!”

“However, the backlash this time is something that I have never encountered before. Therefore, this person called Heavenly Sword Marquis definitely has an unfathomable background and identity. No wonder the old Sorcerer God placed so much importance on him,” said the hunchbacked old man.

“Has the prophet found the location of Heavenly Sword Marquis?” The black-clothed woman asked carefully.

The hunchbacked old man glanced at the black-clothed lady. Immediately, he flipped his hand and took out a command talisman.

This command talisman was a blood-colored command talisman. It contained an extremely strange energy and was extremely unique.

“Take this command talisman and follow the guidance within it. You will naturally be able to find the Heavenly Sword Marquis. However, you must remember that you only have one chance. If you fail to succeed this time around, it will be impossible for you to rely on me to find his location in the future.” The hunchbacked old man said.

The black-robed woman took the token, but she was overjoyed.

“Thank you, Lord Prophet,” the black-robed woman said gratefully.

“Go. Tell the old Sorcerer God to stop bothering me for the next 100,000 years!” The hunchbacked old man waved his hand impatiently.
