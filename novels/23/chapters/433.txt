Chapter 434: Made a Killing!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Buzz... The scarlet pavilion dissipated slowly, as did the mighty blood river.

The Blood Puppet powered off and remained motionlessly suspended there.

Everything finally quieted down. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Jian Wushuang looked pale. He went to Deng Huo’s corpse, took the white-robed elder’s Interspatial Ring, and started binding the ring to himself.

“It took me a lot of energy and three Blood Gems to kill him. I hope his Interspatial Ring won’t disappoint me,”?Jian Wushuang thought with expectation.

As he checked the ring, many treasures began to appear before his eyes.

After a while, his eyes sparked with surprise and joy.

“Fantastic, he is worthy of being a Heaven-defying Level expert!” Jian Wushuang spoke.

He had never seen such a valuable ring that held so many treasures. There were hundreds of thousands of Raw Gems, lots of Natural Treasures, elixirs, magic weapons, manuals and some treasures even Jian Wushuang could not identify.

There were two treasures that delighted him the most.

The first one was a Heaven-breaking Elixir!

This elixir had the same function as the Saint Breakthrough Elixir. It could greatly increase the probability of an expert at the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm making a breakthrough to the Cloud Realm.

Like experts at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm or Half-saint level, who desired Saint Breakthrough Elixirs, many Saint Realm experts often yearned for Heaven-breaking Elixirs.

A large number of experts at Stage Three or the Peak of Stage Three would go mad for this elixir.

“He prepared a Heaven-breaking Elixir. It seems Deng Huo intended to make a breakthrough. It’s pity that he was killed before his breakthrough,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

The Heaven-breaking Elixir was very useful to him.

He would use this elixir for his breakthrough.

The second treasure that amazed Jian Wushuang was a token.

The token looked the same as the Transfer Slip that Deng Huo had wanted to use to escape.

It was another Transfer Slip!

“It is a second Transfer Slip!”?Jian Wushuang could not help but sigh.

A Transfer Slip was something rare and precious that could save one’s life at a critical moment.

Deng Huo was unlucky.

Even if he fought against a powerful lord, he could have escaped by using the Transfer Slip, but he had bumped into Jian Wushuang.

Eighteen Levels of Hell that Jian Wushuang displayed could suppress Deng Huo’s consciousness and even restricted Transfer Slip’s effect, so Deng Huo ended up getting killed.

“Deng Huo said that the Transfer Slip was the most valuable treasure he got from exploring cave mansions and no one could force him to use it. Actually, he gained more than one Transfer Slip,” Jian Wushuang said and sneered.

He understood that since it was a trump card for saving one’s life, it was no wonder that Deng Huo lied and said he had only one Transfer Slip.

“I just spent some energy and three Blood Gems, but I received plenty of Raw Gems and countless treasures, including a Heaven-breaking Elixir and a Transfer Slip...

“I made a killing!” Jian Wushuang said with a hint of excitement in his eyes.

He really had earned a lot. What he gained was over 10 times what he used.

It took Jian Wushuang quite a while to calm down. Then he looked around indifferently, noticing the shocked and terrified spectators, but he ignored them. After putting the Blood Puppet back into his Interspatial Ring, he rushed toward Jiushe Cave Mansion.

The fierce fighting around Jiushe Cave Mansion had stopped.

Both sides stood opposite each other in the air, waiting quietly.

They were all waiting to learn about the outcome.

A figure glided through the area and appeared in front of them. It was Jian Wushuang.

“Swordsman!”

Bone King, Xue Yang, Beast, and the other comrades looked toward Jian Wushuang at the same time.

“Swordsman, where is Deng Huo?” Bone King asked.

Duo Xin Marquis and the other experts of Pale Moon Marquis stared at Jian Wushuang. They had previously seen Jian Wushuang chasing Deng Huo, but now Jian Wushuang had come back without Deng Huo, which was not a good sign.

Jian Wushuang coldly glanced at them, his cold voice reverberating throughout the area. “From now on, Deng Huo no longer exists in the Flaming Battlefield.”

Then he turned over his hand and revealed a token.

It was an ID token. However, it was different from an ordinary token, it was purple gold!

In the Flaming Battlefield, experts at different levels would have different ID tokens. For example, an expert at Stage Two commonly had a silver token, while an expert at Stage Three held a gold one.

Only Heaven-defying Level experts were qualified to have golden purple tokens.

Everyone present was clear about who had previously possessed this golden purple token.

Since Jian Wushuang held the ID token, it meant that its previous owner was...

“Is he dead?”

“Deng Huo, a super expert at the Heaven-defying Level, was killed?”

“A Heaven-defying Level expert is dead?”

Bone King, Xue Yang, and Beast were stunned.

The experts from Marquis Cangyue Camp also widened their eyes.

They had thought it was incredible when they saw Jian Wushuang chasing after Deng Huo. Now they had received the news that Deng Huo had been killed...

He was a super expert at the Heaven-defying Level!

In the whole Flaming Battlefield, many experts had died throughout its millennial history. Even some lords had been killed, but it was rare for a Heaven-defying Level expert to die.

An expert from Marquis Piaoxue Camp had been killed in the Flaming Battlefield, but it was a lord who killed him.

Deng Huo was the second expert at Heaven-defying Level to be killed in its millennial history.

“Let’s go!” Duo Xin Marquis shouted in a low voice.

He looked at Jian Wushuang in terror and then led his people away.

They knew that it was impossible for them to take back the Jiushe Cave Mansion without Deng Huo.

Jian Wushuang wore a faint smile while watching his opponents leave. He did not intend to go after them.
