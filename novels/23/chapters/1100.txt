“Has he left?”

Jian Wushuang had no intention of chasing after the man in gold armor at all.

In truth, even if his opponent remained behind, he had to leave.

After all, he had expended his entire repertoire of swordsmanship but only managed to cut off one of the man’s arms. His opponent could regenerate his arm back instantly, and he did not seem to have lost any of his battle strength.

If the battle continued on, most likely Jian Wushuang would have lost.

“I perfected my Death Shadow by combining both Essences of speed and slowness in it. Most importantly, my consciousness attack coupled with Killing Intent should have been even more powerful, but he easily blocked my consciousness attack. He didn’t even seem to be affected much by it!”?thought Jian Wushuang, secretly surprised.

To Jian Wushuang, even an advanced Celestial Master would have trouble blocking such an attack, much less be so unaffected by it.

“He’s also a Celestial Master like Empyrean Patriarch, but this man is much stronger than him. His consciousness is especially powerful,” muttered Jian Wushuang.

“These experts from the Jin Kingdom came from the Eternal Chaotic World, and more or less they have spent some time trying to make a living there; naturally, they’ll not be lacking in quality. The Green Fire Palace can hold its own with the Jin Kingdom because it has gained many treasures due to its strategic location, which is situated on a huge battlefield. If not…” Gu King’s voice rang in Jian Wushuang’s mind again.

Jian Wushuang could not hold in his laughter. He did not think too much about it, however, and he walked directly toward the bronze colored stone pillar which the man in gold armor had been standing at previously.

As he came to the front of the pillar, he saw the word ‘Kill’ carved into its center.

The moment he saw the word… Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

Roar after roar echoed in his mind as he felt a terrible surge of Killing Intent engulfing him. His pupils shrank violently as his figure flew backward by a few steps.

He only lifted his head again once he was far away from the pillar.

“What a fearsome rush of Killing Intent it was. In fact, it’s much stronger than that of mine, which was made using the Killing Bead,”?thought Jian Wushuang secretly. At the same time, he also realized something.?“No wonder that expert from the Jin Kingdom could withstand my consciousness attack easily. So he has been cultivating his skills all this while at this stone pillar.”

The terrible Killing Intent emanating from the word on the stone pillar could have been used to train one’s consciousness.

Evidently, the man in gold armor had stayed in front of the pillar to train his consciousness. As such, his consciousness was naturally extremely robust.

“Jian Wushuang, the Killing Intent in this word is formidable. Do you want to follow the Jin Kingdom expert’s lead and stay here for a while more to practice?” Gu King asked.

“Stay here to train my consciousness?” Jian Wushuang considered the proposal for a while before finally shaking his head and replying, “No, even though the surge of Killing Intent from this pillar is powerful, so is my consciousness. It won’t have much effect on me, and it’s not worth my time.”

“Furthermore, the man from the Jin Kingdom has just left, and who’s to say if he’ll return after a while? Maybe he’ll even bring other experts from the Jin Kingdom here. Therefore, it’s still better for me to leave.”

Jian Wushuang made his decision and immediately left to seek his fortune in the vast battlefield surrounding him.

Time slowly passed.

The battlefield was too huge.

Even though many Celestial Masters of the Green Fire Palace and the Jin Kingdom wandering about the battlefield, it was too vast for them to be noticeable.

For the next 30 years, the last person Jian Wushuang met was the man in gold armor; he never saw anyone else.

He spent all his energy to look for opportunities on the battlefield during this time.

There were many opportunities to be found on the battlefield. Just the marks left behind by experts as they battled alone were numerous. Even though they had been made a very long time ago, they still contained much profound meaning.

These could also be considered as opportunities.

Jian Wushuang was sitting quietly by himself on a hill, but he kept his gaze fixed on the ground below him.

There was a huge imprint of a claw on the ground; five incredibly deep claw marks could be seen.

The claw marks stretched for 50,000 kilometers. Even though they were made many years ago, their power still had a chilling effect. It was an extremely violent and swift sort of power, and there were even signs of pure Yang energy from the marks left behind.

Jian Wushuang had been on the hill for exactly two years. During this time, he tried to understand the profundity of the message left behind by the claw marks.

The move made with these claws was similar to his own Scarlet Yang Sword Principle; they were both direct and made with pure Yang energy.

Even so, it was just a mark left during battle after all. Its owner had not left it behind on purpose, and there was no message contained in it. As such, Jian Wushuang felt that spending two years trying to figure it out was enough and got up to leave.

He continued to move forward in the Void, a faint smile on his lips.

He had spent the past 30 years wandering in this uncharted territory by himself. Along the way, he met with some opportunities, and even though they were small ones, overall they increased his strength considerably. He had also managed to collect a few magic weapons and had managed to accumulate more than 2,000 points, therefore he considered himself to have profited quite a lot all in all.

Just at this moment…

“Hmm?”

All of a sudden, his expression changed and he stopped subconsciously.

He fished out a token—it was the same token Tang Emperor gave him, and it could help him sense nearby companions.

It was the first time he had encountered anyone from his own side since wandering around the battlefield after leaving the Green Fire Palace.

“Finally, I’ve managed to find someone on my side after all this time, and not to mention in this unknown territory. I’d better go over to say hi,” Jian Wushuang muttered with a faint smile. He then allowed the token to guide him toward the stranger.

Two figures were floating side by side in front of a hill made up entirely of purple gems.

One of them had a slender-looking face and was clad in black robes. He grew a beard and seemed to be of middle age.

The other was a bright-eyed, short and hunchbacked elder.

“I can feel it. That thing should be underneath this hill,” said the hunchbacked elder.

“Since that’s the case, what are we waiting for? Let’s go directly in,” said the middle-aged man in black robes.

“Let’s not hurry. Someone is approaching,” said the hunchback as he turned his gaze to the Void at their side, his face expressionless and inscrutable.

Indeed, a figure was approaching slowly along his line of sight.

“Luckily, its one of us,” the hunchbacked elder laughed.
