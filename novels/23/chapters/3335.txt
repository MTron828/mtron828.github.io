Chapter 3338: Inspector

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation EndlessFantasy Translation

In the magnificent palace, many high level experts of the Temporal Temple

had gathered together.

Although Jian Wushuang was not one of the high-level experts of the

Temporal Temple, because of the battle on Saha Island and his explosive

power, he had gained a very high among the of the Temporal

Temple. In addition, over the past 300 years, Jian Wushuang had

cultivating by the side of the Temple Master. This kind of treatment

had never been given to anyone since the creation of the Temporal Temple. It

was clear that Jian Wushuangs position in the Temporal Temple Master’s heart

was very high, therefore, Jian Wushuang also had a place in the temple.

The Temporal Temple Master sat on the throne at the top and looked down at

the people below.

“I have been adventuring in the universe battlefield all year round. This time, I

only came back temporarily. I plan to go to the universe battlefield again soon.

and before I leave.?Bai Xing,” The Temple Master shouted.

“Palace Master.” Temple Master Bai Xing immediately stood up.

“When I am adventuring in the universe battlefield, you will still be the acting

Temple Master of the Temporal Temple. You will be in charge of all the matters

in the Temporal Temple,” the Temporal Temple Master said.

“Yes.” Temple Master Bai Xing nodded respectfully.

“Ba Cang, you will still be the supervisor of the palace and assist Bai Xing in

managing the Temporal Temple,” Temporal Temple Master said.

“Yes, master.” He accepted the order.

“Phosphorescence...” Temporal Temple Master continued to issue some more

appointments, which were basically the same as before.

In the end...

“Heavenly Sword Marquis,” Temporal Temple Master suddenly said.

Jian Wushuang was stunned, and the surrounding people all looked at Jian

Wushuang.

“Temple Master.” Jian Wushuang walked forward.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, although you are only an Immortal Saint, your

strength has long surpassed that of an ordinary Principles Master. I now

appoint you as the sixth inspector of the Temporal Temple. Do you agree?”

Temple master said.

“Inspector?” Jian Wushuang awas shocked.

He had been in the Temporal Temple for so many years, so he knew a little

about the positions of the higher ups in the temple. Temple Master and

Inspector were undoubtedly at the top and held great power. As for the

inspector...he was under the supervisor and also had great power. He was also

one of the highest-ranking officials in the Temporal Temple. In terms of status

and power, he was higher than many Principles Masters in the two or even

three void realms.

Moreover, there had only been five patrol masters before, but now the

Temporal Temple Master had appointed him as the sixth?

“I’his...” Jian Wushuang was a little stunned. He could not help looking around

at the lh?ople around him.

Sure enough, the surrounding Principles Masters looked at him strangely.

There were some strange emotions in their eyes. The Principles Masters

immediately communicated with each other secretly.

The Temple Master wants Heavenly Sword marquis to be an inspector?” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“An inspector has a lot of power. Usually, only experts in the four void realms

and above will be appointed. As for Heavenly Sword Marquis...although his

performance in the previous battle was amazing, everyone knows that he used

external forces. As for his own strength, he is still far from being appointed as

an inspector, right?”

“You can’t say that. After all, in the previous battle, even without external help,

the Heavenly Sword Marquis’ combat strength was still at the third level of the

Void Realm. Moreover, he was only an Immortal Saint, and his talent and

potential were so great. Now, it has been three hundred years since that battle,

and he has been cultivating by the Temple Master’s side. Perhaps he has

already reached the fourth level of the Void Realm?”

“It’s possible, but he’s still too young and inexperienced. It’s still too early for

him to become an inspector and become the highest-ranking official of the

Temporal Temple. ”

The Principles Masters discussed quietly and had their own opinions on the

appointment of the Temporal Temple Master.

As for Jian Wushuang himself, he knew his own limits, he immediately said,

Temple Master , let’s not talk about whether I’m qualified to be an inspector.

I’ve only been in the Temporal Temple for a short period of time. I’m afraid it’s

not appropriate for me to be an inspector without much contribution to the

Temporal Temple.”

“It’s not a problem for you to be an inspector with your strength. As for your

experience and contribution, you can slowly accumulate them in the future. I

said that you’re qualified to be an inspector, so naturally you’re qualified. You

don’t have to worry too much. I’ll ask you if you’re willing to be an inspector.”

Temporal Temple Master looked down, there was a hint of deep meaning in his

eyes.

Jian Wushuang was obviously still hesitant, but when he noticed the profound

in the Temple Master’s eyes, he stopped thinking and said, “I do.”

“Well, from today on, you are the sixth inspector of the temple.” The Temple

Master smiled, he continued, “Inspector, you have a very high position in the

temple and your position is extraordinary. You will fight for the temple

directly. In the Divine Beginning Realm, if there is a fight between the temple

and the experts from other forces, the inspector will deal with it immediately.”

“Although your strength has reached the required level, the enmity between

you and the three Saint Realms is too deep to be resolved. In the future, when

you fight for the Temporal Temple, you will inevitably have to deal with the

three Saint Realms again. In order to prevent the three Saint Realms from

using any tricks against you in the future, here is a token. Keep it well.” The

Temporal Temple Master waved his hand, a token emitting a special

space-time fluctuation was thrown towards Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took the token and held it in his hand. He asked in puzzlement,

“Temple Master, what is this token?”

“This token is a life-saving token that I personally refined. It can save your life.

As long as I have this token, I can guarantee that no one in the Divine

Beginning Realm can really kill you,” Temporal Temple Master said, his words

were filled with absolute confidence.

He did have such confidence.

As a ruler-level expert, he was proficient in the principles of spacetime. He was

definitely the best at using the principles of spacetime in the Divine Beginning

Realm. With such high attainments in spacetime, the life-saving token he

refined contained special spacetime techniques, although it did not have the

ability to attack, it was definitely enough to save his life.

Even if a master-level expert from the outside world arrived, Jian Wushuang

could still escape with this token, let alone the fact that a master-level expert

from the outside world had yet to arrive at the Divine Beginning Realm.

Therefore, the Temple Master did not show any fear even though he knew that

the three Saint Realms were backed by the power of the will of heaven. He also

knew that the power of the will of heaven could possibly allow a master-level

expert from the outside world to arrive at the Divine Beginning Realm, he

dared to protect Jian Wushuang’s real trump card!

In the Divine Beginning Realm, although Temporal Temple Master could not

be said to be truly invincible, no one could stop him if he wanted to leave.
