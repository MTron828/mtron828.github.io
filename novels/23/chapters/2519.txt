Chapter 2520: Cultivation

“Primordial Stone...”

Jian Wushuang groaned but suddenly raised his head the next moment. “Tiexin, I would like to request your help in a matter.”

“What’s the matter?” Xiao Tiexin looked over.

“I want to borrow the six thousand Primordial Stones in your Interspatial Ring. I’ll return it to you after some time,” said Jian Wushuang.

Xiao Tiexin frowned but soon relaxed.

“It’s just six thousand Primordial Stones. If Mr. Jian Yi needs it, I’ll give it to you. It doesn’t matter if you return it or not.” Xiao Tiexin did not hesitate and took out her six thousand primordial stones.

She knew that were it not for Jian Wushuang, she would be left with nothing that day. Even her life would be gone, let alone the 6,000 Primordial Stones she had.

“Don’t worry, I’m just temporarily borrowing it.” Jian Wushuang smiled and accepted the Primordial Stones from her.

At that instance, the Xueya Escorts members who went to investigate their surroundings had also returned.

“Captain, there’s no more people from the Demonic Moon Prefecture around us. As for those people we previously escorted, all of them are dead,” reported a deputy captain in a deep voice.

“Indeed, none survived.” Xiao Tiexin was not surprised.

Jian Wushuang smiled. “It’s nothing to do with Xueya Escorts as they were digging their own graves. Now that those people you were serving are dead, it’s meaningless to go on with the journey. Are you returning to where you’re from via the same route or will you continue through Demonic Moon Mountains and head to the other end of Dark Thunder Territory?”

“We are heading to the other end of Dark Thunder Territory. The escorting task is just an opportunity for us to earn some Ancient God Divine Power. What about you? Where is Mr. Jian Yi heading to?” Xiao Tiexin asked.

“Me? Don’t worry, let’s go through Demonic Moon Mountains first,” suggested Jian Wushuang.

“Right, this is Demonic Moon Prefecture’s nest. They went full force against you but were defeated. They might not be able to have their revenge against you now with only the Demonic Moon Prefecture’s powers alone but they’ll find ways to invite experts from other prefectures for assistance, so we’d better leave.” Xiao Tiexin nodded in agreement.

Everyone soon continued to set off.

Two days passed in a flash.

During this time, people of the Demonic Moon Prefecture knew exactly where the Xueya Escort Team was, but dared not cause any trouble as the scene where three Ultimate Gods were killed were fresh in their minds.

They were terrified of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang made a pit stop when the Xueya Escort Team had left the Demonic Moon Mountains.

“Let’s part ways here,” Jian Wushuang directly announced.

“Mr. Jian Yi, aren’t you going with us to the other end of Dark Thunder Territory?” The Xueya Escort Team members were quite shocked.

“The environment in central Dark Thunder Territory is good. I want to stay here for a while. Tiexin, you can stay with me if you don’t mind. I still have to return to you six thousand Primordial Stones after all. If you leave now, I won’t make the effort to seek for you and return those Primordial Stones,” Jian Wushuang said with an implicit meaning.

Xiao Tiexin pondered for a moment before agreeing. “No. 2 and No. 3, both of you will take the others home first. Mr. Jian Yi and I have some other things to do in Dark Thunder Territory.”

“Oh...well.” The two deputy captains of the Xueya Escort Team looked at each other and finally agreed.

“Take Little Ray along too. It’s not convenient for me to bring it along.” Jian Wushuang led the double-horned Thunderous Star Beast in front of the Xueya Escort.

The two deputy captains accepted it and soon the Xueya Escort Team left.

After passing through the mid-section of Demonic Moon Mountains, they were quite a distance from Dark Thunder Territory. Although there were bandits along the journey to the other end of Demonic Moon Mountain, the bandits were nothing in comparison to the Xueya Escort Team, hence Xiao Tiexin was not worried about their safety.

After the Xueya Escort Team disappeared into the distance...

“Mr. Jian Yi, what’s your plan?” Xiao Tiexin asked directly.

In fact, she did not care too much about the 6,000 Primordial Stones. She was only especially curious about Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was evidently only a Divine Demon, but possessed the terrifying combat prowess to easily kill an ordinary Ultimate God yet was very low-key from the beginning and had never exposed his skills or techniques.

Moreover, he was also very interested in The Stately Painting. Perhaps he was more than just interested in it as he seemed to have a deep understanding of that picture scroll and knew what it was.

Mysterious, powerful, and extremely weird. He must have an extraordinary background with a lot of hidden secrets.

Xiao Tiexin was willing to stay out of her curiosity toward Jian Wushuang.

As for Jian Wushuang, he kept Xiao Tiexin with him not because he merely wanted to return her 6,000 Primordial Stones, but also because she fitted the role as a helper well.

“Tiexin, come with me first.”

Jian Wushuang smiled without explaining too much.

Jian Wushuang strolled around before stopping in a slightly secluded place.

“I’m going to spend a few days here cultivating. Can you protect me and don’t let anyone disturb me?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes.” Xiao Tiexin nodded and did not refuse.

Xiao Tiexin immediately went into the void nearby Jian Wushuang with her soul power sweeping across the area.

Jian Wushuang sat down cross-legged, flipped his hands, and many Primordial Stones appeared around him.

Those Primordial Stones were borrowed from Xiao Tiexin with a total of 6,000 altogether!

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up instantly upon seeing those 6,000 Primordial Stones. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“In Wusha Wilderness, I previously swallowed and refined three thousand five hundred Primordial Stones from the Great Compassion Sect and Narcissus Island in one breath. My divine power was close to the Peak Second-Class Divine Demon then. These six thousand Primordial Stones should be enough for me to make a breakthrough from Second-Class Divine Demon to First-Cass Divine Demon.”

Jian Wushuang carried a glimmer of expectation before emitting a terrifying suction force and began to swallow and refine the Primordial Stones around him.

He was absolutely fast and made scary progress.

A large amount of pure divine power from those Primordial Stones entered his body before being instantly refined and absorbed by his body.

His divine power began to increase at an astonishing speed.

While Jian Wushuang was refining and absorbing the powers from those Primordial Stones, Xiao Tiexin who was in the void not far away was taken aback at what had happened before her eyes. She could not believe how fast Jian Wushuang was absorbing and refining those powers.

“How can he be so fast?”
