Chapter 223: The Illusory Realm of Slaughter (Part One)

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Although he knew that it was an illusion, what he experienced was so real.

With the breeze blowing, Jian Wushuang felt refreshed.

After looking at this quiet and peaceful village, Jian Wushuang slowly approached it.

In the village, there were a lot of people. When Jian Wushuang was walking on the street, the passersby were all looking at him.

“Oh, a foreigner? Hi,” a hunchbacked old man with grey hair smiled and said.

“Carrying a sword, he seems to be a strong man. Is he stronger than those strong men in our village?” a stout man with black skin, wearing hides, said.

“The foreigner is handsome.” A loving girl looked at Jian Wushuang and then left with alacrity.

Jian Wushuang was walking in the village and saw some people greeting him, which made him look queer.

“Hey, boy.” A crude voice sounded out.

Jian Wushuang turned his head to look at the house. In front of the house, a stout man sitting on the ground casually and holding a pot of wine, said with a smile, “Foreigners hardly come here. Come over, just have a drink.”

Saying that, the stout man threw his pot to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang held the pot, pulling the plug. He smelled and drank it.

The wine contained much alcohol. After drinking it, Jian Wushuang felt a pungent feeling running through his whole body.

“It’s in an illusion but the feeling is real. The taste of the wine is also the same as in reality.” Looking at the pot, Jian Wushuang formed an odd expression.

He threw the pot to the stout man and kept on going without stopping.

“Be careful!”

A man, carrying a huge piece of wood, passed by Jian Wushuang. The huge wood was very long and thick so it was easy for it to strike people. As a result, the man warned Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang stepped aside from the man. But at this point, a child who seemed to be five or six years old, holding a drum-shaped rattle, appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and hopped toward him.

When the child approached Jian Wushuang, he stopped and raised his head, staring at Jian Wushuang with his big eyes.

“Brother, are you a foreigner?” the naive child asked.

Jian Wushuang looked at this child before he smiled slightly and then nodded.

“You are a real foreigner! It’s my first time seeing a foreigner.” The voice of the child was filled with surprise.

“Huzi.” A middle-aged woman came over.

“Mum.” The child ran toward the woman instantly.

The woman held the child in her hands and then walked to Jian Wushuang.

“Are you a foreigner?” the affable middle-aged woman asked.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang said and nodded slightly.

“For a long time, no foreigner has come to our village. Come on! I can cook noodles for you in my shop.” The middle-aged woman was enthusiastic.

Jian Wushuang lifted his brows. Nodding his head, he followed the woman without hesitation and then arrived at the woman’s shop.

Jian Wushuang sat down in front of a square table. The woman was cooking noodles and the child was playing alone in the shop.

“Here...”

Jian Wushuang looked around and a smile grew on his face.

This village was a real paradise.

The village was quiet and peaceful and the people here were hospitable as well as amiable.

“It would be nice if the village is real.”?Jian Wushuang thought secretly.

But he knew that an illusion was an illusion and reality was reality. The law of the jungle was real and a powerhouse was respected in the reality. A place, like this village, would probably not exist.

“What is the test of the Ancestor’s Land?”?Jian Wushuang was confounded.

By now, what he saw was really nice.

He suspected that the aim of the test was letting him sink into this fantasy.

But this might be too easy.

Although everything here was nice, it was in the illusion. Even if he had stayed here for decades, he could still distinguish reality from this illusion. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Brother.”

When Jian Wushuang was thinking, the child came over.

“Hmm?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the child casually and the child rose his head. But just then, the naive child’s eyes flashed a coldness and then a dagger appeared in his hands.

The dagger was proceeding toward Jian Wushaung’s heart at this moment.

“What?”

Although Jian Wushuang was shocked, his reaction was very fast as he quickly held the child’s arms. Compared to Jian Wushuang, the child was very weak, so the dagger was suspended in the air and could not continue forward.

The child’s face was contorted and imbued with madness. Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank.

At this moment, a supersonic voice sounded out. Jian Wushuang glanced at the child’s side and found that the middle-aged woman who was previous enthusiastic was dashing toward him.

The middle-aged woman held a kitchen knife and chopped toward Jian Wushuang’s head.

Jian Wushuang shifted his body and he appeared outside as the kitchen knife chopped on the square table.

“My Spiritual Power...” The complexion of Jian Wushuang was serious. When he dodged the attack from the middle-aged woman, he perceived that at that moment he should not use any Spiritual Power.

Although he was in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm and he could Voidwalk, at this moment he could not use any Spiritual Power just like a normal person.

Whoosh!

With the majestic wind blowing, Jian Wushuang lowered his head subliminally and then a huge piece of wood ran over his head. Jian Wushuang turned and found that the stout man previously holding the huge piece of wood was staring at him crazily.

“These people are all mad?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

This frenzied scene stood in sharp contrast to the previously quiet and peaceful image.

Whoosh!

A cold light emerged and Jian Wushuang stepped away to dodge it. He saw that the stout man who drank with him before was filled with huge killing intent.

Rumble... The whole village was immersed in the tumult. A cascade of people walked out and held arms.

Someone held a kitchen knife. Someone held a hoe. Someone held a sickle. There was a wide assortment of arms the people were holding. Jian Wushuang was surrounded by hundreds of people.

Everyone was crazy. They were all staring at Jian Wushuang, their eyes filled with killing intent.
