Chapter 2663: Space-time Blade

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Is this the Space-time Blade after reaching the Space-time Law second stage?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled with anticipation as he examined the invisible blade in his hand.

The Space-time Blade was formed by condensing the strangulation power.

It was powerful enough to destroy the World.

The Space-time Blade was not only good as a weapon but could also be integrated into one’s moves and techniques.

Jian Wushuang as a sword cultivator could integrate the Space-time Blade into his sword techniques.

“Let’s try it.”

Jian Wushuang was eager to try out the blade as Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand before swinging his sword out. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

It was just an ordinary sword movement with him just casually wielding his sword, but with the Space-time Blade enveloping his sword technique. The power of his sword technique and Space-time Blade’s strangulation power superimposed on each other as his sword fell. The erupted power disrupted the void before him!

“This power...” Jian Wushuang was amazed.

He just did a casual move, but even such sword power was probably capable of threatening an ordinary High-level Heaven Ultimate God.

“Even a casual sword movement would be terrifying with this Space-time Blade. The power will be even more powerful if combined with the Space-time sword technique I’ve created.” Jian Wushuang clasped both hands together. “Moreover, I’ve just reached the second stage of Space-time Law and only managed to control the Space-time Blade’s first style as of now. I’m sure there’s still a huge room for improvement in the future.”

Just like the Space-time Apparition, Space-time Blade was capable of becoming stronger as Jian Wushuang made progress in Space-time Law.

Rumor had it that those experts who reached the second stage understanding in Space-time Law could single-handedly discharge hundreds or even a thousand Space-time Blades with each Space-time Blades powerful enough to kill a Primary-level Heaven Ultimate God. How horrible would it be for a discharge of hundreds or even a thousand Space-time Blades at the same time?

It would simply be a nightmare when they were sent forth if those hundreds of Space-time Blades were condensed and integrated into his offensive moves.

“Understanding the laws will get harder with progress. I’ve just reached the second stage and gained control of Space-time Blade’s first style. I’m afraid it’ll be quite a while before I can take control of the second style,” muttered Jian Wushuang indifferently.

He had a very high understanding of the Space-time Law, but the same could not be said for his Transmigration Law understanding which was quite far behind.

His understanding of Transmigration Law had also reached the first stage’s limits and was only one step away from the second stage, but who knew when he would finally be able to reach the second stage.

In terms of Sword Principles, Profound Achievement Sword World was common among Heaven Ultimate Gods. However, his Sword World could extend up to 100,000 miles when Jian Wushuang displayed its full potential with powers comparable to a Complete Sword World with Jian Wushuang’s Sword World probably being stronger.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang’s understanding of Laws and Sword Principles was considered strong among the Heaven Ultimate Gods.

The only part he lacked was his cultivation realm!

“I’ve stayed in front of the Space-time Beast for more than half a month. I wonder if Yin Su’er and Palace Keeper Si Zhen have gotten the Divine Elixir Pills for me?”

Jian Wushuang immediately went to visit Palace Keeper Si Zhen.

Inside a huge manor in the Sacred Palace.

“Jian Yi, this is where you’ll live. I’ve made it clear that no one should disturb you unless there’s something urgent. In addition, there are two Message Tokens here belonging to two very powerful Sacred Palace Elders. You can send a message to these two Elders if you have any needs during your time in the Sacred Palace. Feel free to message me if they aren’t able to help you.” Palace Keeper Si Zhen handed two tokens to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly after receiving both tokens.

He knew that Palace Keeper Si Zhen was busy due to his position in the Sacred Palace so he would not have time to deal with petty matters. Most of the day-to-day issues were left in the hands of Sacred Palace Elders.

“Here’s an Interspatial Ring which the Fort Master asked me to give you a few days ago. It contains the Divine Elixir Pills you need. The Fort Master was unable to prepare many of them for you in such a short time frame—only eight hundred. I heard you’ve been meditating in the Space-time Hall, so I didn’t interrupt you at that time, hence I’ll give this to you now.” Palace Keeper Si Zhen gave an Interspatial Ring to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang simply glanced inside and there were indeed 800 Divine Elixir Pills within!

“Eight hundred pills!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed.

800 Divine Elixir Pills were only a measly amount to the Fort Master of Danyang Holy Domain, but Jian Wushuang was aware of the difficult situation Yin Su’er was in. She must have paid a huge price or sacrificed a great deal to gather those 800 Divine Elixir Pills.

Jian Wushuang would not complain about it.

Besides, those 800 Divine Elixir Pills were enough to raise his cultivation realm by another level.

“Alright, I’ve handed it to you so I’ll make a move first as I still have a lot of matters to deal with. Carry on with your cultivation and don’t let the two Fort Masters down,” said Palace Keeper Si Zhen solemnly before turning around and leaving.

Jian Wushuang looked at the Interspatial Ring in his hand with a strange expression after Palace Keeper Si Zhen left.

“Yin Su’er must have high expectations of me for her to willingly gather 800 Divine Elixir Pills in her current situation. I can’t let her down if that’s the case.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

He then immediately began refining and absorbing those Divine Elixir Pills’ power in seclusion within the manor’s secret chamber.

He had sold ten catties of Royal Blood Gems and Liquid Life, to get a total of 520 Divine Elixir Pills in Wushui Territory 28 years ago.

He only needed 120 Divine Elixir Pills to successfully make a breakthrough from the Primary-level Earth Ultimate God realm to the High-level Earth Ultimate God realm. He absorbed and refined the remaining four hundred Divine Elixir Pills to accumulate some divine power in his body. In the last 28 years, he had absorbed a fair bit of divine power on his own which meant that he had accumulated quite a lot of divine power. Therefore, he was not too far from making a breakthrough to the Peak Earth Ultimate God realm.

Jian Wushuang predicted that he should be able to break through and reach the Peak Earth Ultimate God Realm had he refined and absorbed all 800 Divine Elixir Pills before him.

It took Jian Wushuang a full five months to absorb all 800 Divine Elixir Pills and managed to make a breakthrough and reach the Peak Earth Ultimate God realm as he had intended.

His divine power skyrocketed again as soon as he made a breakthrough with his overall strength increased by leaps and bounds.
