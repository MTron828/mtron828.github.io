Chapter 5319 - 5319: Dream Sword Fairy

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Thirteen individuals ascended the arena, their battles hanging on the brink of a single thought.

‚ÄúJian Wushuang?‚Äù

Dream Sword Fairys brow was cool, her countenance revealing pride, yet her sword was anything but. From the start, Jian Wushuang had only given her a cursory glance, assessing her swordsmanship. While she had excelled in the path of the sword, her self-created techniques were rather ordinary.

Despite this, her strength secured her a place in the top eight, far from being a bottom-tier contender.

The supreme skills of the Thirteen Tai p a Sword, cultivated by these individuals, seemed like an enormous waste.

Not to mention the broader universe, even within the Great Si Region, if such sword techniques were disseminated, there would be many surpassing them.

In the external world, the second-grade origin source Dao was at least complete, without any flaws.

‚ÄúYour Excellency is from Grave God Mountain, and also a sword cultivator. I would like to ask you for advice.‚Äù

Jian Wushuang extended his arm, gesturing for her to proceed.

In an instant, the sound of breaking wind echoed, overshadowing all else,

The two engaged in their first bout, with sword shadows intertwining in a dance across the sky.

Onlookers were consumed by the spectacle, their blood boiling. Jian Wushuang, however, understood that he had yet to fully exert himself; everything thus far was a manifestation of Dream Sword Fairy‚Äôs abilities. ‚ÄúHuh? Jian Wushuang seems not to have drawn his sword?‚Äù

The Emperors could still see clearly. Some Dao Lords, like Zhu Bachi, could also discern some subtleties, given his formidable strength.

‚ÄúThe gap is a bit large!‚Äô

The gaze of the tier 5 Emperors was sharp, immediately recognizing that Jian Wushuang was extraordinary.

Initially, they thought it would be a fierce battle, and Dream Sword Fairy would ultimately be defeated. Now, upon closer inspection, it seemed that in a real fight, Dream Sword Fairy might not last more than three rounds.

Adjusting his posture, Jian Wushuangs figure tilted backward, easily evading Dream Sword Fairy‚Äôs attack as if it were child‚Äôs play.

‚ÄúYou actually didn‚Äôt use the Tai p a Sword?‚Äù Jian Wushuang truly puzzled these swordsmen. Why were they all so arrogant?

They didn‚Äôt make serious moves from the start, seemingly waiting for a warm-up.

It was absurd.

In many ways, Zhuifeng underestimated his opponent. Jian Wushuangs strength was not much weaker than Zhu Bachi‚Äôs. It was clear that Zhuifeng had ruined his ovvn advantage during the fight.

Dream Sword Fairy was somewhat surprised by Jian Wushuangs agility. What she didn‚Äôt know was that Jian Wushuang had long entered the level of space origin source. In terms of spatial manipulation, he surpassed the Emperors of the Four Great Secret Realms.Y√¥ur fùíÇvorite stories on ùíè/o/(v)ùíÜ/lbùíän(.)cùíêm

Naturally, his body techniques were superior by countless levels.

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt drawn your sword either,‚Äù Dream Sword Fairy remarked. This statement might seem reasonable since he hadn‚Äôt drawn his sword, and it was normal for the opponent not to use their ultimate skills.

However, for Jian Wushuang, it was a disgrace because he didn‚Äôt even have a divine sword worth using.

This was because he did not have a divine sword that he could take out.

Dream Sword Fairy held a pale blue longsword in her hand, as enchanting as a

dream. It seemed to be at least a pre-celestial exquisite divine sword.

Coming from an ancient sect, it was normal for her to possess such treasures. Having more treasures than those outside was justifiable, considering they were passed down from ancient times.

However, Jian Wushuangs current identity originated from the mysterious

Grave God Mountain. This mysterious aura not only intrigued others but even Jian Wushuang himself, as he didn‚Äôt know where the Grave God Mountain was or what lay atop it.

Given his current status, presenting an eternal divine sword wouldn‚Äôt be excessive.

Yet, he refrained from doing so.

He already had a peak-level ancient sword on him, acquired from MO Long.

He couldn‚Äôt afford to bring out this worn-out sword and embarrass himself. Most importantly, he didn‚Äôt need it. Or rather, when dealing with an opponent like Dream Sword Fairy, he didn‚Äôt need to resort to using a sword.

If she wanted to see his longsword, it was simple enough.

I‚Äôll stand right in front of you, letting you take a good look at it at once, because, well, I am the sword!

Jian Wushuangs figure flickered and quickly disappeared from his original

position. When he reappeared, a scorching divine sword manifested in this chaotic space.

This was the transformation of Heart power, the sixth level of the Ultimate Dao, the Heartsword Trial!

‚ÄúBreak! ‚Äù

Pshht!

With incredible speed, Jian Wushuangs sword pierced through, catching many Emperors off guard. Dream Sword Fairy‚Äôs body disintegrated in an instant.

The strike didn‚Äôt harm her origin source; after all, this was Shangqing Palace, and he needed to control the force. It merely sent shockwaves through her origin source, causing her strength to plummet. She staggered and drifted in the chaotic space, finally falling to the ground.

Jian Wushuang lowered his head and looked down, his figure resembling a sword, humming with resonance.

That was the aftermath!

The sword resonance from the aftermath was intoxicating.

His hands were trembling slightly. When he had just pierced Dream Sword Fairy‚Äôs body, that evil thought instantly filled his entire mind.

He almost couldn‚Äôt suppress his own thoughts, but the sound of the Sword Resonance had been reminding him all along.

The devouring thoughts surged again, and he found himself adapting to them quite well.

Mainly, it was the breakthrough in the Extreme Dao. He had reached the sixth level, the most uncomfortable but also the fastest progressing stage.

Another reason was the fragility of the natives in the Four Great Secret Realms. If he were to devour them, it would probably be quite easy.

For Dream Sword Fairy‚Äôs Sword Dao origin source, he was confident in devouring half of it.

Previously, he could only devour a tenth, but now he had directly increased it to half. Devouring the Grand Yan Immortal outside might still be challenging, but the Grand Yan Immortals in the Four Great Secret Realms, these Dao Lords, were too fragile for him.

Here, the Sword Dao was not very effective, unable to match up to the supreme techniques.

However, the Extreme Dao was very well-suited. Solely relying on the Extreme Dao, he could challenge the foremost Dao Lords.

Just the terrifying devouring power would force Emperors to evade.

This was the power of the transcendent Dao Lord.

Even those who had achieved Dao had to retreat.

In the Four Great Secret Realms, there were also many tier 1 and 2 Emperors. The status of these Emperors was very low, not even comparable to those Dao disciples.

For those with backgrounds, it was better. They could become functionaries within the sect, handling matters that couldn‚Äôt always be entrusted to the strong.

Just like outside the Shangqing Palace, most of the Emperors coming and going were stewards. However, as the face of the Shangqing Palace, these individuals couldn‚Äôt be too weak; most of them were tier 2 Emperors.

For those without backgrounds, it was a tough situation.

Keeping a low profile was advisable; otherwise, they might be hunted down by those transcendent Dao Lords.

Each transcendent Dao Lord, before reaching a consensus with Dao, would seek challenges against some Emperors.

Those lacking strength would challenge tier 1 Emperors. If they lost, they would retreat, and if they won, they would continue undefeated or even kill an Emperor before proceeding with Dao, enhancing their momentum.

This was considered the tragedy of the weak.

In the Original Universe, such Grand Yan Immortals were very rare. No one in the Emperor-level would fear a Grand Yan Immortal; the disparity in Dao comprehension was vast.

Even the weakest Emperor, who had mastered the origin source of space and achieved perfection in his own origin source Dao, had comprehended space.

Inside the Qishen Temple, however, things were different. Only when these Emperors reached tier 3 did they comprehend the origin source of space.

Many tier 2 Emperors had just touched the threshold of the origin source of space and were not as good as external Grand Yan Immortals.

As for those Emperors, they were even worse, almost not touching the threshold of the origin source of space.

The display of his strength just now surprised the Emperors above not only because of his overwhelming power but also due to his familiarity with space.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the aura of the origin source of space!‚Äù
