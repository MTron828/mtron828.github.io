4892 Beating up the Bald Man

As if it had been cut open by some kind of enormous force, the bald man’s attack was directly shattered.

The gazes of all the sword cultivators and top cultivators who were watching suddenly froze!

They could clearly see that Jian Wushuang’s blade of grass had condensed into a sword light that was ten thousand feet long and easily shattered the bald man’s attack!

Could it be that even grass and leaves could release such a powerful Sword Intent?

Flicking the grass in his hand, Jian Wushuang said faintly, “If you can’t threaten my attack, I advise you to go back to where you came from, so that I don’t throw you out.”

“There’s a price to pay for your arrogance!” The bald man was furious. His body grew several meters in size again, and the dark yellow Yan power around him became even more powerful and terrifying.

“Giant Desert Sky!”

As he roared, the entire Dao Field was covered in a layer of dust.

As he stood in the dust, Jian Wushuang could feel that his Yan power was slowly fading away.

This was an Immortal Style used by the bald man.

However, after his battle with Chang Duoling, he could sense that his perception had reached a whole new level.

This included the purity of his Yan power and his control of the Sword Dao. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

If it had been before, the bald man, who had grasped the reality, might have been able to fight with Jian Wushuang for a few rounds. But now, everything had changed.

In fact, he could completely defeat the bald man with just one move from the Star River Lake Sea Sword Intent.

However, Jian Wushuang did not do so. In order to better integrate knowledge and action, and to better guide the sword cultivators present, he used the Flowing Cloud Grass Sword moves.

The seventh move, Folding Grass and Leaves.

The smile on the bald man’s face did not even disappear completely. In the next moment, his Immortal Style, Giant Desert Sky, was completely broken by seven vast Sword Intents.

These seven Sword Intents were the shadows of seven blades of grass. After easily breaking the Immortal Style, they all slashed at him without losing momentum.

The bald man’s reaction was half a beat slower and he could not dodge in time. He was slashed seven times in a row, leaving a shocking wound.

“Damn it, you’re using strange tricks!” He was shocked and angry, and he released his Immortal Style again.

“Mountain Transformation!”

As the bald man’s voice fell, his incomparably sturdy figure swelled to an unimaginable extent once again. His entire skin appeared a grayish-yellow color, like a protruding rock.

Then, like a walking mountain, he crashed into Jian Wushuang!

Jian Wushuang obviously did not want to engage in this meaningless battle. He immediately released the eighth move of the Flowing Cloud Grass Sword, Cutting the Four Seasons.

The leaves in his hand slashed forward. This sword move was more precise and complicated than the seventh move. It was the peak move of the entire Flowing Cloud Grass Sword technique.

There were a total of eight sword moves in this sword attack, which was the peak sword attack that combined the first seven moves. The eight sword moves combined into one, and it was enough to make the Four Seasons lose their color.

A million wisps of Sword Intent appeared on the blade of grass and slashed forward.

The bald man, who was running madly, felt a great danger flash through his heart. Then, he made a prompt decision and directly defended on the spot.

However, the eighth move of the Flowing Cloud Grass Sword was too vast. Especially when it was performed by Jian Wushuang, its power was infinite.

In just a single exchange, the bald man was swallowed by the endless Sword Intent.

Bang! Bang! Swish! Clang–

In this entire Dao Field that was completely condensed by Yan power, an earth-shaking collision sound rang out.

A web of cracks appeared where the bald man was standing.

The eight powerful Sword Intents slashed down one after another, and even Yan Immortals would have died long ago.

However, this bald man was different. His ability to resist attacks had almost reached a terrifying level. Even if the Sword Intents left inextinguishable heavy injuries on his body, he did not say a word.

The training hall was collapsing.

When the last supreme Sword Intent landed, everything returned to calm.

When the dust settled, the scene that appeared caused all the sword cultivators to go crazy.

It turned out that the Flowing Cloud Grass Sword technique would have such power when it reached the peak!

Half of the bald man’s body had been smashed into the training hall. He was lying on his back, and it was unknown if he was dead or alive.

Jian Wushuang walked forward slowly and looked at the bald man in surprise.

He knew very well how powerful the Sword Intent released by him was. As long as it was below the Grand Yan Immortal stage, no Yan Immortal could withstand it.

However, this guy had endured it. Although it was a little tragic, his Immortal Source was not damaged at all.

Jian Wushuang finally understood why this guy came to challenge him without fear. It was because he was too thick-skinned, and other Yan Immortals would not be able to beat him.

After sighing in his heart, he directly pulled the bald man out of the training hall and threw him out of Little Lonely Heaven with a little force.

After doing all this, Jian Wushuang looked at all the top cultivators in the Dao Field and said calmly, “This is the power of the Flowing Cloud Grass Sword moves after it has been mastered.”

As he spoke, he stretched out his hand and threw the leaf in his hand. Like a stream of light, it fell in the center of the entire training hall.

When the leaf fell to the ground, it stood upright in the center of the training hall like a small sword. 99 streams of light surged out of the leaf and turned into seven-colored rays that covered the surroundings.

“These 99 Sword Intents are the entire Flowing Cloud Grass Sword technique. You can comprehend it at any time. Now, I’ll tell you another thing.”

“I have hidden a wisp of my own Sword Dao in that leaf. If someone can pull out that leaf, that wisp of Sword Dao inside will belong to that person.”

As soon as he said this, all the sword cultivators were extremely fanatical as they looked at the leaf that stood in the center of the training hall.

Jian Wushuang smiled and stretched out his right palm. A flying bird condensed by Sword Intent started to chirp and jump.

This was the ninth move of the Flowing Cloud Grass Sword technique, Flying Birds to Stop.

This was the most exquisite sword move, the simplest sword move, but at the same time, the most complicated sword moovoe.

The bird flew out of Jian Wushuang’s hand, chirping and flapping its wings in the air. Finally, it landed on the grass leaf in the center of the Dao Field and began to sleep.

“Perhaps some people might ask if the Flowing Cloud Grass Sword can be cultivated to the realm of great success. Now I’m telling you, of course it can.”

“When this bird is willing to rest on the tip of someone’s sword, that person’s sword cultivation will be accomplished.”

After finishing his last sentence, Jian Wushuang left the sword discussion Dao Field.

Xu Jin hurriedly got up and followed him for dozens of steps before he finally stopped.

He stared at Jian Wushuang’s back until everything disappeared. Then, he came back to his senses and his eyes became determined.
