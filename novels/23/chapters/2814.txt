“That’s true, but after so many years of internal strife in the Sacred Pill Sun World, Crimson Rock Castle’s prestige toward the experts of various factions has long since fallen. Although Crimson Rock Castle has regained control of everything, it’s easier said than done to unite all the experts of those factions within a short period of time.” Yun Shan frowned.

“It’s not easy, but it’s the only way. No matter what, we have to do our best to fight for it. Even if we have to pay a big price for it, we won’t hesitate,” Yin Su’er said in a low voice, then she looked at Jian Wushuang and said, “Sword One, I’m afraid we’ll have to rely on you and the Sword Alliance in this crisis. I hope you can help us.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Yin Su’er was very sincere.

She really needed Jian Wushuang and the Sword Alliance.

Especially Jian Wushuang. Without him, no one in the Pill Sun Sacred World could compete with the Marquis of Three Yin!

“Sure.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly and did not refuse.

Soon, Jian Wushuang left the Crimson Rock Castle.

But after leaving Crimson Rock Castle, his heart was heavy.

“Heavenly Void Palace, Heavenly Void Army...”

Even Jian Wushuang felt a great pressure when he learned of the strength of the Heavenly Void Army and knew that they were gathering to attack the Pill Sun Sacred World.

“Yun Shan is right. Although Crimson Rock Castle has regained control of everything in the Pill Sun Sacred World, its prestige has long been lost. It will not be easy to regain it in a short time. Even if the entire Pill Sun Sacred World is in danger, Crimson Rock Castle will not be able to gather many experts to participate in the battle,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

To the many factions of the Pill Sun Sacred World, including many solitary experts, it did not matter much whether the Pill Sun Sacred World was annexed or not.

Even if the Pill Sun Sacred World was annexed by the Heavenly Void World, it would only change its name. It would not affect the interests of the experts of these factions.

Especially the four top factions. They were currently being forced by the Crimson Rock Castle to a miserable state. Many experts of their own were working under the Crimson Rock Castle, suffering unspeakably.

At this moment, they hoped that the Heavenly Void Palace would attack them so that they could regroup.

“It seems that Crimson Rock Castle has encountered a real crisis.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes, but he began to hesitate.

He was hesitating whether he should help Crimson Rock Castle to solve this crisis.

To be honest, he did not have any feelings for the Crimson Rock Castle, nor did he have much sense of belonging to the Pill Sun Sacred World.

The reason why he had helped Crimson Rock Castle and Yin Su’er was pure because of the agreement he had made with Crimson Rock Saint.

However, he had already done a lot to help Yin Su’er obtain victory in the battle and allow her to perfectly control the Pill Sun Sacred World. Its value had already surpassed that of a heaven-sealing scroll. Therefore, even if he did not care about Crimson Rock Ccastle now, he could just leave, he could feel at ease.

However, Jian Wushuang was not the kind of person who would give up a burden so easily.

“A good man does what he has to do. Back then, Saint Crimson Rock gave me a scroll of the heaven-sealing map to help Yin Su’er solve the crisis and stabilize Crimson Rock Castle and the Pill Sun Sacred World. Now, I have only done half of it. Although what I have done far exceeds the value of a scroll of the heaven-sealing map, since I have agreed to it, I have to complete it even if I have to suffer a little loss.”

“What’s more, the Crimson Rock Saint gave me a heaven-cleaving token, asking me to help Yin Su’er breakthrough to the Immortal Saint realm. If I don’t care about this and let her die, then I’ll get the heaven-cleaving token for nothing. It doesn’t conform to my principles.”

Jian Wushuang pondered, but he had already made a decision in his heart.

The Heavenly Void Army was coming. He would try his best to help Yin Su’er in this crisis.

“The Heavenly Void Army is too powerful, and Marquis of Three Yin is in charge. With the help of Crimson Rock Castle and the Sword Alliance, even if we gather a group of experts in the Pill Sun Sacred World, we won’t be able to fight the Heavenly Void Army head-on. If I want to help Yin Su’er solve this crisis, there’s only one way...”

“Phew! I have to go there again.”

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and immediately set off.

A dense ancient forest filled with a large amount of gray fog and a gloomy and mysterious aura.

This was the infamous boneyard on the Pill Sun Continent!

There were countless dangers here, and very few people dared to venture here.

However, Jian Wushuang knew that there was a big secret hidden in the bone burial ground.

The secret realm of Heaven and Earth created by a rule master was hidden in the bone burial ground.

The bone burial ground was extremely dangerous, but with Jian Wushuang’s current strength, as long as he did not enter the deepest and most dangerous place, it was not too risky. Jian Wushuang continued his journey, before long, he arrived at an inconspicuous small valley.

“Here I am again.”

Jian Wushuang looked at the valley in front of him, but a faint smile appeared on his face.

He knew that this valley was the entrance to the secret realm.

Jian Wushuang flipped his palm, and a black sword appeared in his hand.

The black sword was originally divided into six parts. Previously, Jian Wushuang and his group of six went to the secret realm together, and each of them had a broken sword.

The six broken swords were the complete keepsake to open the secret realm.

However, Jian Wushuang was the only one who survived the adventure in the secret realm. Other than the winged god who died in the cemetery, all the treasures of the remaining five people fell into Jian Wushuang’s hands, naturally, the broken sword in their hands was also included.

The broken sword in the winged god’s hand was also given to him by Spirit Valley Elder when Jian Wushuang left the secret realm.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang now had a complete keepsake, so he could easily open the secret realm.

At this moment, as Jian Wushuang took out the complete keepsake, a unique aura spread from the black sword’s body.

Buzz buzz.

The valley in front of him trembled slightly under this unique aura. Then, a space passage slowly appeared in the void in the center. This space passage was extremely dark and mysterious, it was impossible to know what was at the other end of the passage with the naked eye.

However, Jian Wushuang had been here once before, so he was very familiar with it.

Without any hesitation, Jian Wushuang leaped and directly entered the space passage.

Light flashed and when he appeared again, Jian Wushuang had already arrived in a huge dark void.

This dark void was boundless, and there was not a trace of light.

Jian Wushuang sped up and directly rushed toward the end of the dark void in front of him, which was the depths of this secret realm.
