Chapter 758: Returning a Favor

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Next to a Baptismal Pool near the Ice Fire Mountain in the Tianqi Mountains two imposing figures were standing quietly. They kept casting nervous looks at their surroundings.

In the Void not far from the Baptismal Pool, a group of four people gathered together. They were from the Boundless Demon Sect and led by Xia Yuan. They were overlooking the distant Baptismal Pool through the Void.

“We’ve scouted out the Baptismal Pool. Two Demon Gods are guarding it. Both of them are Two-star Silver-armored Demon Gods And their battle strength rivals experts at Step Two of the Eternal Realm. One of them, in particular, carries a longbow on his back. He is a very good archer,” Xia Yuan said in a deep voice.

“Well, I can handle the Demon God with the longbow.”

“Kang Jing, the other Demon God is yours. It’ll do if you just hold him back. Can you do that?” Xia Yuan asked the man standing beside him.

“No problem.”

Kang Jing nodded. Although he was only at Step One of the Eternal Realm, what he did best was tangle with the opponent. It was not difficult for him to hold a Two-star Silver-armored Demon God back.

“As for the two of you, just hurry down at your fastest speed and collect all the water in the Baptismal Pool. Understand?” Xia Yuan turned to look at An Chao and the last Eternal Realm expert.

“Yes.” An Chao and the other guy nodded in unison.

“All right then, let’s get started.”

Xia Yuan took the lead and zipped ahead of them towards the Baptismal Pool at an incredible speed.

An Chao and the other two Eternal Realm experts were on his heels.

A few seconds later, they were visible to the two clansmen from the Ancient God Clan.

A rich aura burst out from Xia Yuan. As he advanced forward, he was also growing in size. In an instant, he turned into a copper-armored Ancient God.

“Invasion!”

The two clansmen instantly realized what was happening. One was a hairy middle-aged man, carrying a longbow and wrapped in fur.

It was Gu Yang, the same person who had saved Jian Wushuang from An Chao a hundred years ago.

Seeing Xia Yuan and the others charging toward him, Gu Yang gave a snort and immediately transformed into a Silver-armored Ancient God. The longbow he usually carried on his back appeared in his hands. His huge hands drew the bow forcefully.

A stream of horrible power started to converge in the longbow.

The power was so formidable that even An Chao and Kang Jing, who were both at Step One of the Eternal Realm, began to shudder involuntarily.

“It’s him!” An Chao’s pupils contracted as he recognized Gu Yang.

A hundred years ago, Gu Yang had shot two arrows at him. The first one seriously wounded him. When the second one was about to hit him, he had thrown out one of his trump cards and escaped by a fluke.

He knew that Gu Yang’s strength was far superior to that of an ordinary Two-star Silver-armored Ancient God.

“Go to hell!”

A snarl sounded. Gu Yang suddenly loosened his right hand which had been tensely drawing the bowstring.

A pitch-black arrow shot out, streaking across the Void like a bright shooting star.

The frightening arrow appeared in front of Xia Yuan in the blink of an eye.

Xia Yuan had a cold look, a sense of contempt flitted through his eyes. He was holding a Giant Axe in one hand. He hacked his Giant Axe lazily forwards and split the air in two.

“Clang!”

With a loud clang, the arrow was smashed to pieces.

“What?” Gu Yang looked panic-stricken. He shouted, “Hurry up, send the emergency signal! These outsiders are powerful!”

The other clansman standing next to Gu Yang had already registered the current situation. Without hesitation, he sent out the emergency signal.

It would take some time before anyone who picked up the signal could come here. The two did not know whether they could hold it together that long.

“Humph!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Xia Yuan snorted. He strode up to Gu Yang with his Giant Axe in hand and swung it at Gu Yang.

Gu Yang pushed his longbow onto his back and a long black spear emerged mysteriously in his hand. He threw himself into a fierce fight with Xia Yuan.

Gu Xiu’s battle strength was more than enough to allow him to deal with an expert at the peak of Step Two of the Eternal Realm, however it was still way below Xia Yuan’s.

Shortly after they began to fight, the outcome was clear.

Xia Yuan was totally quashing Gu Yang.

On the other side, Kang Jing had also successfully entangled the other clansman.

An Chao and the last Eternal Realm expert had reached the Baptismal Pool of Demon Gods. They began to extract the water using their Interspatial Rings.

“Bastard!”

Gu Yang felt a rush of fury flowing into his heart. When he caught sight of An Chao and the other guy frantically drying up the pool, his expression turned even darker.

He broke free with all his force, drew his longbow once again and shot another arrow towards An Chao.

It was a lethal attack. An Chao and the other Eternal Realm expert jumped sideways. The arrow missed its target and failed to cause any injuries.

Instead, Gu Yang’s missed attack offered Xia Yuan a good opportunity.

“You’re dueling with me, but you still have time to care about the Baptismal Pool! You really don’t know death is approaching.” Xia Yuan’s chilling voice sounded in Gu Yang’s ears. He heard a howling wind.

Axe Shadow was already in front of him.

“Crap!”

Gu Yang’s expression changed drastically. Even though he was a Silver-armored Ancient God, he knew he would die if this powerful axe landed on his head.

The axe soared towards him so fast that the moment he shot the second arrow the Axe Shadow was already before him, leaving him no chance to escape.

“Am I really going to die?” Gu Yang was seized by despair.

But just at this moment…

“Whoosh!”

A jet of dazzling sword light suddenly appeared. It was extremely vast and menacing, just like a Sword River. It zoomed in front of Gu Yang and blocked the Giant Axe that was roaring toward him.

“Bang!”

With a loud clash, the Sword River was shattered to pieces. But in this split second, Gu Yang retreated to the other side and dodged the deadly strike.

“What a narrow escape!”

Gu Yang widened his eyes. He felt half surprised, half grateful. He saw a black-robed figure with a wicked silver mask appear next to him

Although he could not see the man’s face, based on the One-star aura he was emitting, he quickly realized who it was.

“Thank you,” Gu Yang said curtly.

“A hundred years ago, you saved me. Today, I saved yours, so I’ve returned your favor,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Yeah.” Gu Yang nodded slightly.

Jian Wushuang had been wandering about in this area for a while and was not too far away when he heard the emergency signal. He had rushed here only to see Gu Yang in great danger. Naturally, he struck without delay.
