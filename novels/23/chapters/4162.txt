4164 Taken Over?

From the center of King Zhufeng’s eyebrows, his flesh was torn apart, and a dark golden sword tip slowly extended out.

The sword tip, the sword body, the sword hilt…

In just a few breaths, a dark golden sword with countless mysterious Dao patterns on the blade and a bloody vertical eye on the hilt came out of King Zhufeng’s body.

This was none other than the Tarot sword that had struck fear into the hearts of all the races of the universe millions of chaos cycles ago!

The Tarot sword was filled with a demonic and evil aura. It had been nourished by the baleful energy left behind by the Tarot supremacy of millions of chaos cycles, and it had completely transformed into a demonic sword!

Whoosh.

The tip of the Tarot divine sword rotated slightly and then slowly stabbed toward the space between Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows.

King Zhufeng’s body shriveled up at a visible speed, turning into a dry corpse and finally melting into a pool of blood.

Ka ka ka.

The Tarot divine sword entered Jian Wushuang’s forehead inch by inch. After a while, the Tarot divine sword had completely entered Jian Wushuang’s body.

The strange thing was that there was no wound or blood between his eyebrows.

Bang!

The next moment, Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes!

The pupils in his eyes disappeared and were replaced by a deep void.

“Jian Wushuang? Very good, from today on, I am the sword demon, Jian Wushuang!”

‘Jian Wushuang’ opened the corners of his mouth and let out a low and strange laugh. The laughter echoed in the huge Hall and seemed extremely eerie.

His body was floating in the void. With a pull of his right hand, the countless javelins-like hair suddenly turned into countless black lines and returned to Jian Wushuang’s hand.

Then, he stepped down from the void and carefully felt the body. A satisfied smile appeared on his face.

“With this body, I’ll be able to reach the peak of the universe once again, and I’ll be even stronger than I was in my last life. But…this body is still too weak. I have to think of a way to make this body stronger, or it’ll be a waste.” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself and then pulled out the Wuqi Divine Sword. He looked at it and shook his head. “Then, let’s start by strengthening this sword.”

‘Jian Wushuang’ stepped into the third level of the hall, where countless principles cardinal treasures and divine materials for refining weapons were piled up.

“Hmm, evil dragon’s venomous fangs, chaotic cold iron, the core of the universe, star essence…”

One by one, Supreme-grade blacksmithing materials that were enough to cause a sensation in the outside world shot into ‘Jian Wushuang’s’ hands. After a closer look, there were at least 100 of them.

‘Jian Wushuang’ nodded and sat down with his legs crossed. He pulled out the Wuqi Divine Sword and said in a low voice, “Refine!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

In an instant, a black divine flame condensed in front of him and burned the void.

The greatest fortune that belonged to Jian Wushuang in his entire life had begun!

…

In the Great Hall on the second level of the Tarot Ruins.

‘Jian Wushuang’ sat cross-legged, and in front of him, a cluster of black divine fire burned the void. In the divine fire, the Wuqi Divine Sword was melting and reforming continuously.

Although Jian Wushuang and Qing Xuzi could see the Supreme-grade divine materials before, they could not take them away. Now, ‘Jian Wushuang’ grabbed them from the second level of the hall and threw them into the black divine fire. Then, they were refined into the Wuqi Divine Sword to improve its grade.

Time flew by.

In a flash, a hundred years had passed.

“It’s done!”

‘Jian Wushuang’ spread his fingers. The Wuqi Divine Sword, which was floating in the air, suddenly let out a clear sound and flew back into his hand.

Clang!

Jian Wushuang stretched out his finger and flicked the blade. In an instant, the Wuqi Divine Sword trembled hundreds of millions of times. The void seemed to be trembling.

Hehehehe…although this sword has not broken through to the level of a supreme weapon, it has already reached the limit of a nomological Supreme treasure. In terms of power, it’s a thousand times stronger than before. A satisfied smile appeared on Jian Wushuang’s pale and strange face. He waved his hand and immediately put the Wuqi Divine Sword into his Interspatial Ring.

‘Next, I’ll improve this body.’

‘Jian Wushuang’s’ eyes flashed with a slight look of contemplation. He casually flipped through the Interspatial Ring and a look of surprise suddenly flashed across his face.

“Mid-grade nomological Dao fruit? Wait…this is a Nine-Leaf Sword Grass?” Jian Wushuang’s face was filled with joy.

To him, a mid-grade Dao fruit of law was nothing. There was more than one mid-grade Dao fruit of law on the third level of the palace. However, the Nine-Leaf Sword Grass was different!

The Nine-Leaf Sword Grass was a godly medicine that countless swordsmen dreamed of!

It contained the comprehension of the origin of the way of the sword. It was the most primitive principles of the way of the sword at the beginning of the universe. It had incredible uses for any sword cultivator.

‘I didn’t expect this junior to have such an opportunity. Fine, I’ll improve my sword Dao universe origin first.’ Jian Wushuang swallowed the Nine-Leaf Sword Grass and the mid-grade Dao fruit of laws in one gulp and started a new round of improvement.

…

At the same time, in the Divine Life Palace.

In the Supreme shrine where Supreme Blood Wave was located.

“Impudent!” The Blood Wave Supreme, who had been resting with his eyes closed, suddenly opened them, and a look of anger flashed across his face.

“Blood Wave, what happened?” Supreme Giant Axe, who was standing beside him, could not help but frown and ask.

He and the Blood Wave Ruler had been friends for dozens of chaos cycles, and he had rarely seen the Blood Wave Ruler so enraged. He could not help but feel a sense of confusion.

“Jian Wushuang, something has happened.” Supreme Blood Wave said slowly.

“What did you just say?” Giant Axe Supreme was shocked. He knew how much the Blood Wave Supreme valued and looked forward to seeing Jian Wushuang. He felt the same way.

A perfect being with such great talent and incredible potential had never been seen since the Divine Life Palace was established.

“The protective mark I left on Jian Wushuang’s armor has been erased.” The Blood Wave Ruler’s face was dark, and his eyes were filled with cold killing intent.

Giant Axe Supreme’s eyes flickered when he heard this. He knew about the protective mark that Blood Wave Supreme had left in Jian Wushuang’s armor. It could be said that with the mark, no one in the world could hurt Jian Wushuang except a Supreme.

This was also the reason why the Blood Wave Ruler dared to let Jian Wushuang go to the Tarot Ruins as a fourth-level Ruler.

However, the Blood Wave Supreme was now telling him that the protective seal had been forcefully erased!

What kind of concept was that?

Could it be that a Supreme martial artist had appeared in the Tarot Ruins?

Taking a deep breath, Supreme Giant Axe said in a deep voice, “Blood Wave, the protection mark being erased doesn’t mean that Jian Wushuang is dead. Why don’t we go to the Life Palace to see if Jian Wushuang’s life lamp has been extinguished?”
