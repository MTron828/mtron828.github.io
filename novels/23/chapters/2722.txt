Chapter 2723: Six Interspatial Rings

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“What a big ancient castle!” Jian Wushuang was so enthralled by the giant castle floating in front of him.

“Is it big? You should check out the inside. It’s even bigger!” Devilish Wind King said with a smile.

“Go, let’s go in,” Saber Master suggested and the six figures headed toward the ancient castle.

After passing through the ancient castle’s gate and a corridor, Jian Wushuang and those five other men arrived in a dim palace.

“We’re here again.” Devilish Wind King and Yi Shen were excited.

“Look over there.” Yi Shen pointed in one direction.

Jian Wushuang followed the direction and his pupils shrunk.

At the end of that direction, there were six balls of light suspended in tranquility with each ball of the light containing an Interspatial Ring within!

There were six balls of light and six Interspatial Rings!

The Devilish Wind King looked extremely excited and he said, “It’s the same as the one we met last time. Alliance Master Su Han, this is your first time here in this secret realm, so you might not know this. Fifty years ago, we wandered in this secret realm and ended up here. There were also six Interspatial Rings in this palace with each of the six containing some treasures. Each of us obtained one of the rings last time, including Fo Yi, so I don’t know what was in his ring.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up in excitement.

‘Fo Yi must have gotten the second Fengtian Scroll from this secret realm. The second Fengtian Scroll was from this palace here.’

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang’s gaze moved and he was puzzled. “Wait! You took the six Interspatial Rings the last time you came from this palace, then it should be empty now. How come the same six Interspatial Rings have reappeared?”

“We’re perplexed as well.” The Devilish Wind King shook his head. “The way I see it, these six Interspatial Rings could have been deliberately placed here by someone who likely is this secret realm’s owner.”

Jian Wushuang was slightly startled but he nodded secretly.

It was probably like the Crimson Stone Saint who was an ordinary Undying Saint expert but able to leave behind his consciousness in his tomb for a long time to choose his personal disciple.

As for the owner of that secret realm... He must be adept if he was able to establish such a large secret realm. His abilities were likely to be far beyond the reach of Crimson Stone Saint.

Therefore, it was normal for the secret realm master to leave his consciousness or some special methods behind in his secret realm.

The chances were they probably had not discovered it yet.

“Six Interspatial Rings and each of them contains treasures, but no one knows what is inside. We shall go by the rules set the last time. Each of us will get one of these six Interspatial Rings. It’ll depend on our luck to discover what’s inside the rings,” said the Saber Master after glancing around at the five people.

“Alright.”

“Sounds good.”

Jian Wushuang and the several people nodded in agreement.

No one knew what treasures were kept in those Interspatial Rings, so each of them would grab one of them. In the end, how valuable the treasures they got were solely dependent on their luck.

“Let’s do it.”

Saber Master said and was the first one to move forward. He held one of the balls of light and took away the Interspatial Ring in it with a swing of his hand.

Jian Wushuang, Hong Chen, Long Xianzi, and the rest made their moves at the same time.

Each of them took one of the Interspatial Rings which they had no idea what could be contained within. It was fair and square as there was no need to fight over the Interspatial Rings.

After that, they began to check the treasures contained in their Interspatial Rings.

Jian Wushuang was doing the same.

He quivered at the sight of the contents in his Interspatial Ring and was surprised to find a pill!

The pill was the size of a baby’s thumb. It had a deep color and it exuded a unique breath of aura.

It was a majestic breath of aura!

Coincidentally, Jian Wushuang knew the pill and even saw it before.

“Huangji Golden Pill, this is the Huangji Golden Pill!” Jian Wushuang was elated.

The Huangji Golden Pill was the final treasure to be auctioned at the Star Picking Pavilion auction event held in the Narcissus Territory and the grand finale.

It was the treasure that got Nanwu Palace’s Young Palace Master, Divine Demon Sect, Life and Death Tower, and Dongfang Clan vying fiercely for it.

The pill was extremely helpful to Ultimate Gods!

A Primary-level Grand Ultimate God who took a Huangji Golden Pill had more than a 30 percent chance to make a breakthrough to the High-level Grand Ultimate God realm.

Even High-level Grand Ultimate Gods who took one Huangji Golden Pill had a chance to make a breakthrough to the Peak Grand Ultimate God.

It was no doubt that many Grand Ultimate God experts would be vying for the pill.

Back then at the Narcissus Territory, the Hungji Golden Pill fell in the hands of the Nanwu Palace’s Young Palace Master which a large number of experts went forward to fight for it afterward. Even the other three top powerful forces had sent their Grand Ultimate God expert to fight for it only showed the importance of the Huangji Golden Pill.

Although Jian Wushuang only had one type of treasure in his Interspatial Ring, there were a total of five Huangji Golden Pills!

Five Huangji Golden Pills!

“My goodness!” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

He knew that he was lucky. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

A large number of experts would have marked him had the news spread that he possessed five Huangji Golden Pills. The top forces would go all out to hunt him down and behead him for those five Huangji Golden Pill.

After all, it would help those top forces bring up five Grand Ultimate God experts if those five Huangji Golden Pill were fully utilized!

There might be a possibility to have one or two High-level Grand Ultimate Gods or even Peak Grand Ultimate Gods!

It was a sweet and attractive deal for those top forces.

As for Jian Wushuang, the Huangji Golden Pill had little effect on him.

He required too much divine power to make a breakthrough in his cultivation realm. The effect on him after having one Huangji Golden Pill was minuscule and almost impossible for him to make a breakthrough in his cultivation realm using the Huangji Golden Pill.

Although he did not need it himself, he could give it to someone else or use it to win the hearts of some experts.

He believed that many Grand Ultimate Gods would willingly be under his leadership for the sake of Huangji Golden Pills.

“It’s indeed true that there are unlimited opportunities in this secret realm. Fo Yi came and he got a Fengtian Scroll while my current time here had allowed me to obtain five Huangji Golden Pills. I wonder what treasures the others have in their Interspatial Ring?” Jian Wushuang glanced around curiously.
