Chapter 2892: Farewell to Chu Shi

——

The battle between Jian Wushuang and the three Immortal Saints was shocking!

Countless experts from all the forces in the Golden Crow Nine Realms were spreading the news.

In less than a few days, Jian Wushuang’s name had spread to every corner of the Golden Crow Nine Realms. Many people outside of the Golden Crow Nine Realms had heard about it, and they were all shocked.

Monster!

The number one Divine Master in the history of the Golden Crow Nine Realms.

All the titles fell on Jian Wushuang’s head.

While the entire Golden Crow Nine Realms was shocked by Jian Wushuang, as the main character, he had already arrived at a city outside the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s base.

This city was not far from the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s Mountain Gate. Usually, genius disciples or experts of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion would pass by here.

Jian Wushuang was sitting quietly in a tavern, drinking quietly.

On the surface, he was drinking, but in his heart, Jian Wushuang was thinking.

Of course, he was thinking about how to get close to Leng Rushuang.

In addition, before seeing Leng Rushuang again, Jian Wushuang still had some things to figure out.

Jian Wushuang had been in the tavern for three days. He had concealed his aura and even disguised his appearance, so no one noticed him. But now, he had noticed three people walking out of the tavern, they had just walked out of a shop.

They were all Great Divine Masters, led by a purple-haired handsome youth.

The purple-haired handsome youth had the most powerful aura, which had reached the level of a Peak Great Divine Master.

Jian Wushuang also knew this person.

“That’s him.”

Jian Wushuang grinned. When he saw the purple-haired handsome youth and the other two fly out of the city to return to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, he immediately chased after them.

In the Void, the three purple-haired handsome young men were flying, and they were about to reach the mountain gate of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

But at this time…

Whoosh!

Without any warning, a figure appeared in front of them out of thin air.

As soon as it appeared, a huge divine power that suffocated the three of them came over.

“Is this the Immortal Saint?” The purple-haired handsome young man and the other two were shocked.

The strength of divine power was determined by the level of divine power.

Jian Wushuang’s current divine power level had indeed far exceeded that of an ordinary Divine Master, so it was naturally the same for divine power.

“It’s you.” The purple-haired handsome young man recognized Jian Wushuang at once, and the corners of his mouth could not help trembling.

“Oh, brother Chu Shi, do you still remember me? In that case, do you remember the battle with me? I’m here to meet you.” Jian Wushuang smiled playfully.

This purple-haired handsome young man was Chu Shi. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When he opened the Dragon-phoenix list in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, Chu Shi had challenged him to a battle in order to vent his anger on Demoness Gu. However, that battle did not really take place.

Upon hearing Jian Wushuang’s words, Chu Shi could not help trembling.

A duel with Jian Wushuang?

After all, it had been many days since Jian Wushuang had fought with the three Immortal Saints. He was one of the genius disciples of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and had reached the level of a Peak Great Divine Master. He had also heard of such a thing.

He knew that Jian Wushuang could easily kill the Immortal Saint. Even the two Immortal Saint Elders in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion would feel immense pressure when facing Jian Wushuang.

Asking him to fight with Jian Wushuang?

Was that not courting death?

“Senior brother Chu Shi, do you know this person?”

The two disciples next to him asked because they did not know what had happened, nor did they know Jian Wushuang’s background.

“Shut up!” Chu Shi shouted directly, then he looked at Jian Wushuang again and forced a smile on his face. “Jian, Sir Jian Yi, you must be joking. I was blind to offend you before, sir. I hope you can forgive me.”

“Jian Yi!” The two disciples of Dragon-phoenix Pavilion were also shocked. They looked at Jian Wushuang with shock and fear.

Chu Shi was also terrified.

He thought that Jian Wushuang really came for the battle, so he immediately begged for mercy. However, he was careful. He quietly took out a message token and was ready to ask the experts of Dragon-phoenix Pavilion for help. After all, the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s nest was nearby, as soon as he sent the message, the Immortal Saint of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion would immediately come to his rescue.

However, how could he hide his thoughts from Jian Wushuang?

“Chu Shi, I advise you not to play any tricks. Otherwise, I won’t be polite,” Jian Wushuang said with a wicked smile.

Chu Shi’s hands trembled, and his face was extremely embarrassed. As for the communication, it naturally failed.

“Don’t worry. I’m not here to find trouble with you, nor for the duel. I just have some questions to ask you. I hope you can answer them truthfully,” Jian Wushuang said.

“If you have any questions, please ask me. I’ll tell you everything,” Chu Shi said.

“My question is very simple. It’s about your Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s Young Phoenix. I want you to tell me everything you know,” Jian Wushuang said directly.

“Young Phoenix? Junior Sister Leng?” Chu Shi’s expression changed and he immediately understood.

When the Dragon-phoenix list was released, Jian Yi had come into contact with the Young Phoenix. At that time, everyone could see that Jian Wushuang and the Young Phoenix seemed to have a special relationship. It was normal for Jian Yi to ask about the Young Phoenix now.

Facing Jian Wushuang, Chu Shi knew Jian Wushuang’s fierce reputation and strength, so he did not dare to hide anything. He immediately told him everything he knew about the Young Phoenix.

Jian Wushuang frowned when he heard this.

What Chu Shi said was not very different from what was spread in the outside world.

What he said was also what he already knew. It was meaningless.

“Chu Shi, do you really want to die?” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened. “Do you think I won’t dare to kill you because you are a genius disciple of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion?”

“No, no!” Chu Shi shook his head immediately. “Master Jian Yi, I’ve told you everything I know. If you don’t believe me, you can ask my two junior brothers. They must know the same thing.”

Jian Wushuang frowned slightly.

Chu Shi did not look like he was lying.

“Master Jian Yi, in fact, we don’t know much about Junior Sister Leng. Junior Sister Leng has always been a recluse and has almost never interacted with us. Junior Sister Leng has been in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion for so many years, but she only spoke to me twice, and it was the simplest two sentences.”

“In addition, some of Junior Sister Leng’s matters are also considered top secret in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. Only her master, Elder Qin, and the other Immortal Saint Elders of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion know about these things. Disciples like us really don’t know anything,” Chu Shi said.
