Chapter 1047: Bet!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Celestial Master Dong Ming of the Ancient Demon Clan arrived soon.

Apart from him, the Ten Great Protectors serving Patriarch of Empyrean Glory and a large crowd of experts curious about the pursuit earlier had shown up as well.

The tightly-packed crowd that had appeared in the Void was mostly made out of Dao Masters.

All of their attention was placed on Jian Wushuang.

“Is he Jian Wushuang? He doesn’t look that formidable.”

“Jian Wushuang sure is capable to make Patriarch of Empyrean Glory and the Ancient Demon Clan chase after him like this, but his glory ends here.”

“Ends here? I don’t think so. Asura Lord of the Blood Asura Clan is going to try her best to shield him.”

“One party is Jian Wushuang and Jian Wushuang. The other is Patriarch of Empyrean Glory and the Ancient Demon Clan. It’ll be very interesting to see what happens.”

The whispers began resounding.

In their sight, Patriarch of Empyrean Glory and Dong Ming were glaring at Asura Lord.

“Asura Lord, this has nothing to do with your clan. Are you sure you want to get yourselves involved?” Dong Ming asked in a cold voice.

“Yes, I am. What can you do about it?” Su Rou refused to concede in the slightest.

“Very well. I’ve long heard that you have the purest bloodline in the history of Blood Asura Clan and I’m sure you’re also the strongest of them all. I’d like to learn from you today.” Dong Ming’s gaze was cold and clouded. The moment he stopped speaking, a terrifying killing intent was already bursting forth from him.

Simultaneously, Patriarch of Empyrean Glory beside him was also emanating his powerful aura. Evidently, both of them were prepared to fight. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Su Rou’s expression turned grave.

Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes.

“Your experts make a decent battle formation, Fourth Sister, but it’ll only be able to hold Patriarch of Empyrean Glory back. It’s not realistic to use it to suppress them both.” While he shook his head, an idea was already forming in his mind.

“Patriarch of Empyrean Glory!”

Jian Wushuang opened his mouth to produce a bellowing sound. He took a step forward at the same time.

“What more do you have to say, brat?” Patriarch of Empyrean Glory asked coolly.

“It’s said that you’re so arrogant that you’d never team up with any of the four great clans. Yet you decided to work with the Ancient Demon Clan just to kill me. This doesn’t seem like your way of doing things.” Jian Wushuang chuckled, appearing rather at ease with the current situation.

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s expression shifted ever so lightly.

It was true that he typically had little to do with the Ancient Demon Clan. Neither did he want to have anything to do with these great clans. But like what Jian Wushuang said, he was teaming up with the Ancient Demon Clan today.

“Patriarch of Empyrean Glory,” Jian Wushuang called, glancing at him. “How about we make a bet?”

“Make a bet?” Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s expression changed.

“Since you’re so desperate to kill me, I’ll give you a chance to do so.”

“I’ll take three strikes from you face-on. If I die, you would’ve avenged your son. But if you fail to kill me after three strikes, you’ll have to write off whatever grudge there is between us two. What do you think?” Jian Wushuang asked, smiling.

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory narrowed his eyes. “You’ll take three strikes from me head-on?”

He was exceptionally powerful even among the Celestial Masters. Perhaps even an ordinary Celestial Master wouldn’t be able to survive after taking three strikes from him. Yet Jian Wushuang dared to suggest three head-on strikes.

“Is this brat really that confident in himself?” Patriarch of Empyrean Glory muttered to himself. He then sneered and said, “Humph! I’m not a fool. You’re already a dead man in this current situation. I only need to put in a little effort to kill you, so why should I bother making a bet with you?”

“I’m already a dead man? I don’t think that’s necessarily true.” Jian Wushuang chuckled. “Don’t assume that I’m unaware that the secret pattern on Dao Master Jiu Jian is the only reason you and Celestial Master Dong Ming know my whereabouts. If you happen to corner me, I’ll just kill Dao Master Jiu Jian and make my escape!”

“Without that secret pattern, how would you and Celestial Master Dong Ming track me down?”

Jian Wushuang appeared utterly confident.

The faces of Patriarch of Empyrean Glory and Dong Ming fell.

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory had witnessed just how fast Jian Wushuang could run after using his secret skill. He could not catch up even after exerting all of his strength, unleashing his main body, and using his secret skill. Without the secret pattern pointing the way, he would have long lost track of Jian Wushuang.

They two would truly be helpless if Jian Wushuang killed Dao Master Jiu Jian and played that secret skill of his.

“Jian Wushuang, if you dare kill Dao Master Jiu Jian, I can guarantee that you will find nowhere to stay in the entire Samsara Continent!” Dong Ming said coolly.

“Oh excuse me, I’m not a native of Samsara Continent in the first place. I’m from the Void Continent. If I can’t stay here anymore, no big deal. I’ll just return to my home. If you’re that good, feel free to hunt me down in the Void Continent. But I’d like to see just who is it that would be killed then!” Jian Wushuang replied with a sneer.

Dong Ming’s expression considerably darkened.

“The Void Continent? So you’re indeed that top genius who caused all that commotion in the Void Continent!” he said in a cold voice.

Both the Samsara and Void Continents were located in the Green Fire World. Being a top expert of the four great clans in the Samsara Continent, he would naturally have learnt about current events happening in the other continents. Not long ago, he was told a notable battle that took place in the Tang of the East in the Void Continent as well as a stunningly brilliant genius.

That great genius was in the Eternal Realm.

“Even though the two continents are in the Green Fire World, it’s been long agreed that both should mind their own business. If this brat really returns to the Void Continent, there’s no way for our clan to send too many of our people to hunt him.”

“Moreover, based on the news that I obtained, this brat has exceptional origins in the Void Continent. Tang of the East, the number one nation on the continent, is his supporter. Never mind the fact that we can’t send too many of our people, even if our entire clan goes there, we won’t be able to do anything to him.”

“I mustn’t let him run off to the Void Continent!” Dong Ming muttered in a gloomy voice.

“But this brat sure has some good escaping tricks up his sleeve. If he kills Dao Master Jiu Jian and we lose that secret pattern, no one would be able to catch up to him.” Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s voice turned even colder. “We have no choice but to agree to his request!”

His eyes glinted before he finally stepped forward.

“Jian Wushuang, I accept your bet!”

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s booming voice reverberated in the air.

He understood very well that the bet was his only chance of avenging his son.

He had essentially no other way of killing Jian Wushuang.

Since this was his last chance, of course he would hold firmly onto it.
