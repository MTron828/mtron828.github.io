4463 Five Thousand Years of War

Team 7 was in a bamboo forest.

The bamboo shoots were dark green, and the green jade entered his eyes.

Supreme Blacksource and Jian Wushuang sat opposite each other, their white cloak casually lying on the ground.

“Jian Wushuang, you should know about the death of the Vice-Captain of our Team 7, Supreme Gui He, right?”

Supreme Blacksource asked calmly.

“I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

The establishment of a team was divided into one team Captain, two Vice-Captains, and ten team members.

The Captain of Team 7 was Supreme Blacksource, while one of the two Vice-Captains were Supreme Rong Ya, who was on good terms with him, and the other was Supreme Gui He.

In the battle outside the domain, Void God’s arm had descended, and countless Supreme realm experts had died at his hands.

Supreme Rong Ya was lucky enough to avoid this calamity, but Supreme Gui he was not so lucky. He died at the hands of Void God during the second strike.

It was just that the matter was urgent at the time and he did not have time to worry too much. Now that the matter had finally come to an end, he naturally had to choose a replacement for the Vice-Captain position.

Supreme Blacksource glanced at Jian Wushuang. He was not the wishy-washy type, so he immediately said, “Jian Wushuang, what I mean is that you should be the Vice-Captain of our Team 7 team. What do you think?”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and said, “Captain, isn’t the position of Vice-Captain usually reserved for Half Invincible Supreme realm experts or Top Supreme realm experts?”

Supreme Blacksource chuckled upon hearing this. “Jian Wushuang, with your strength, which Top Supreme, or even Half Invincible Supreme, can defeat you? Although your cultivation level is not there yet, in terms of battle power, you are no different from a Vice-Captain.”

“This…” Jian Wushuang thought for a while and said, “Captain, I just came to the Offworld Battlefield not long ago. I’m afraid I can’t convince the public, right?”

Jian Wushuang did not reject the position of Vice-Captain as it was dispensable. However, he would politely decline if it would cause more trouble.

Supreme Blacksource glanced at them upon hearing this, then shook his head. “Jian Wushuang, don’t worry about that. I’ve communicated with all the members and they’ve all agreed to let you be the Vice-Captain. Speaking of which, Rong Ya was the one who personally recommended you to be the Vice-Captain.”

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang had no reason to refuse. He stood up and cupped his hands, “Then, I, Jian Wushuang, will accept your invitation.”

“Good.” Supreme Blacksource smiled and nodded.

A moment later.

Jian Wushuang changed into a Vice-Captain’s robe and token. The members of Team 7 greeted him respectfully.

…

Spring came and autumn went, and the sea turned into fields.

In the blink of an eye, 5,000 years had passed.

In these 5,000 years, Jian Wushuang led Team 7 to conquer the North and the South, to suppress the Offworld Battlefield.

He kept fighting with the Void Warriors at the void spatial rift. In a short 5000 years, he had experienced nearly 10,000 battles.

This made him more familiar with Void Warriors.

In the past 5000 years, the sealed three-headed snake, Wang Liu, did not show any signs of abnormality. However, as time went on, the power that Wang Liu left in his body became more and more violent.

Especially when Jian Wushuang was in a great battle and he was in a weak state, Wang Liu would crazily hit the seal and try to take over his body.

There was even one time when Jian Wushuang used the Tarot Sword Strike against a Five Scar level Void Warrior. He was directly controlled by Wang Liu’s power.

If not for Supreme Blacksource suppressing him firmly and allowing Cosmos God to suppress Wang Liu once again, Jian Wushuang would probably have completely demonized and started a massacre on that day.

However, it was not as if he did not gain anything in these 5,000 years.

Jian Wushuang’s name had shaken the entire Offworld Battleground and the entire Team 7 was convinced.

Time passed just like that. Jian Wushuang led his team to guard the crack in the void, not allowing Void Warriors to take even half a step out.

The cultivators from the Offworld Battlefield wars were constantly being transferred from the universe to the Offworld Battlefield. Overlord and Moluo Yangu also arrived one after another.

However, in the first battle, Moluo Yangu was killed by a Void Warrior.

This also made Jian Wushuang increasingly indifferent and numb to life and death.

Just when Jian Wushuang thought that he would spend the rest of his life like this…

An emergency transfer order from Cosmos God had him transferred back to his base camp from the Void Rift.

…

Base camp, main hall.

The Captain and Vice-Captain of Team 9 stood on both sides with solemn expressions.

Jian Wushuang strode forward with a sword hanging from his waist and a white cloak on his body.

After 5,000 years of killing, the Tarot Divine Sword’s power reached another level. Jian Wushuang, who had always been cold, now had a touch of iron-blooded killing spirit between his brows.

As he walked into the hall, the people standing on both sides of the hall raised their eyebrows. They felt that Jian Wushuang had come with a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood, and his body was full of soaring killing intent.

Supreme Bing Ye and Long Qing were the Vice-Captains of Team 2 and 3 respectively. Naturally, they were also in the main hall and could not help but let out a cold snort when they saw this.

In the past 5,000 years, Jian Wushuang’s fame had been increasing day by day. He had long been like the sun in the sky. They had a great enmity with Jian Wushuang, so now that they saw him again, they were naturally more dissatisfied and wanted to kill him.

“Jian Wushuang pays his respects to Cosmos God!” Jian Wushuang knelt down on one knee and cupped his hands as he said in a deep voice.

“You may rise.” Cosmos God laughed and lifted his hand to help Jian Wushuang up.

After doing all this, the gaze of Cosmos God swept across everyone’s faces. He said, “I’m sure everyone is confused as to why I’ve suddenly gathered all of you here.”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone looked at each other and could see the doubt in each other’s eyes.

However, no one spoke. They waited quietly for Cosmos God to continue.

Cosmos God was rather satisfied with the situation. After nodding his head slightly, he said in a deep voice, “I’ve received news earlier that the Void Universe is very likely to organize a great chaos and attack the void crack with all its forces.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“However, we don’t know the exact time of the great chaos, as well as our current strength in the Void Universe.”

...

“Therefore, I’m going to choose five of you to go deep into the Void Universe and investigate the details of this great riot!”

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone was shocked!

Deep into the Void Universe?

This was no small matter and was extremely dangerous. Long before the Void Rift appeared, Cosmos Gods had already sent people into the Void Universe on the other side.

The leader of that group of candidates was none other than the Palace Master of the Divine Life Palace!

However, even now, there was no news from the powerful Palace Master of the Divine Life Palace, and it was unknown whether she was alive or dead.

It could be said that entering the Void Universe was a suicide mission.

Hiss!

Everyone in the hall looked at each other and sucked in a cold breath.

Only Jian Wushuang raised his head the moment he heard this. His eyes were shining.
