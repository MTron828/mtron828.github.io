Chapter 1294: Compete!

The further the Little Scattered Stars Game progressed, the more difficult it became.

When it was merely the first move. It wasn’t difficult for any of them.

The time flew past.

On the vacant lot before the Fairy Palace, the match between Universe God Qing Yang and Chu Xiao was still ongoing before everyone’s eyes.

“The tenth move. Chu Xiao already resolved the tenth move. It has only been a month!”

“Universe God Qing Yang, mm, he solved the tenth move as well.”

“Impressive. The two of them are very impressive. However, Chu Xiao is faster in resolving the move as compared to Universe God Qing Yang.”

Many inner disciples of Dayu Palace were gathered there to watch the match attentively.

One was Universe God Qing Yang while the other one was the most talented in Dayu Palace, Chu Xiao!

Of course, they wished to see Chu Xiao defeat Universe God Qing Yang. That’s why, when Chu Xiao was at an advantageous position during the beginning of the match, the inner disciples of Dayu Palace were delighted.

In the first month, Universe God Qing Yang already resolved the tenth move while Jian Wushuang who was in the secret room had only just resolved the seventh move. Jian Wushuang was obviously slower in speed. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

When it came to the eleventh move, it became significantly more difficult.

Previously, Universe God Qing Yang and Chu Xiao resolved one move every two to three days. But after the tenth, they would require at least a dozen days to resolve one move.

A year later, Universe God Qing Yang and Chu Xiao resolved the twenty-second move one after another while Jian Wushuang was still lingering on the eighteenth move.

On the third year, Universe God Qing Yang and Chu Xiao resolved the twenty-sixth move but they were both stuck at the twenty-seventh move. Then, Jian Wushuang was resolving the twenty-fourth move.

On the fourth year, Universe God Qing Yang and Chu Xiao resolved the twenty-seventh move but then, Jian Wushuang had already resolved the twenty-sixth move.

In the fifth year, when Universe God Qing Yang and Chu Xiao were in a bind on the twenty-eighth move, Jian Wushuang resolved the twenty-eighth move and was already trying to resolve the twenty-ninth move.

However, everyone in Dayu Palace, including the Master of Dayu Palace was enchanted by the match between Universe God Qing Yang and Chu Xiao. Plus, Jian Wushuang was merely a Universe Master and as such, was limited. Under normal circumstances, he wouldn’t be able to resolve many moves. So, no one was paying attention at Jian Wushuang.

Naturally, no one knew that Jian Wushuang in the secret room resolved more moves in the fifth year compared to the two geniuses on the vacant lot.

In the sixtieth year, Jian Wushuang in the secret room opened his eyes and flashed a smile while the thirtieth black chess piece disappeared from the chess set before him.

The thirtieth move, resolved!

“King of Venomous Worms, the way you taught me is quite effective. Although the moves in the Little Scattered Stars Games became more and more difficult, I wasn’t struggling.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Humph, don’t you know who I am?” King of Venomous Worms said proudly, “When I followed King Luo Zhen in the Eternal Chaotic World back then, I saw the Great Scattered Stars Game. I naturally know how to make use of the Little Scattered Stars Game.”

“The Little Scattered Stars Game focuses on the nature of swordsmanship but the nature of swordsmanship emphasizes accumulation!”

“To solve the Little Scattered Stars Game, the most important thing to be avoided is impatience. You must take it slowly. In the process of accumulation during resolving the sword moves, even if you are capable of solving the move, you should try another way to resolve it.”

“Advance and consolidate at every step. Make a move steadily and surely. Then, you’ll be able to experience more and accumulate more. Even though the moves would become more and more difficult, as long as you have time, you would be able to resolve it slowly. If you were to be impatient and wanted to solve more moves in a short time, you would be restricted. You might end up being held up by one of the moves for a very long time, just like reaching a bottleneck in cultivation!”

“Is that how it is?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

Ever since he started to resolve the Little Scattered Stars, he had been following King of Venomous Worms’s guidance and resolved the moves slowly but steadily. Sometimes, he could resolve the moves quickly, but he would spend more time on the solution in order to accumulate more.

As a result, he wasn’t fast in resolving the moves in the beginning, he was even considered slow.

However, the more experience he accumulated, the hidden sword movement in the following moves became less of a hindrance for him.

From his first move until the thirtieth move, he felt that success was assured as the condition was ripened.

“It’s a pity that you only have ten years to resolve the Little Scattered Stars Game. If you were to be given sufficient time, even if you are merely a Universe Master, you could resolve forty or even fifty moves as long as you proceed steadily and surely according to my method. But now…” King of Venomous Worms let out a sigh.

“Jian Wushuang, six years have passed. There are only four years left. In the first two of the remaining years, you will continue to resolve the moves according to the method I taught you. For the latter two years, you should resolve as many moves as possible without scruples.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded and immediately continue to resolve the thirty-first move.

On the vacant lot in front of Fairy Palace, when it came to the sixth year, the match took a dramatic change.

At first, when they started to resolve the Little Scattered Stars Game, Chu Xiao had been leading by a slight bit in term of speed.

From the first move till the twenty-eighth move, Chu Xia resolved it first. Then, followed by Universe God Qing Yang. So, Chu Xiao had been slightly faster than Universe God Qing Yang all this while.

But on the sixth year, Chu Xiao was still stuck on the twenty-ninth move while Universe God Qing Yang resolved the twenty-ninth move.

“Look, Universe God Qing Yang’s twenty-ninety black chess piece disappeared!”

“He resolved the twenty-ninth move!”

“D*mn it. He resolved the twenty-ninth move but Chu Xiao is still stuck.”

The inner disciples from Dayu Palace began to panic.

Chu Xiao saw the sight and his face grew grave.

“How could it be? I have been faster than him slightly all this while. How could he resolve the twenty-ninth move when I’m still stuck? D*mn it. How do I resolve the twenty-ninth move?” Chu Xiao clenched his teeth and continued to try to resolve the move.

As he was resolving the move, everyone could see through the impatience in Chu Xiao.

“He’s panicking.”

The Master of Dayu Palace who was seated on his throne shook his head, “The moment he panics, we will lose any suspense for the match!”

There was really no suspense anymore. After all, the Little Scattered Stars Game was so profound and exquisite. One was required to be calm and it’d be best if there wasn’t any external interference.

But then, seeing Universe God Qing Yang leading before him, Chu Xiao became impatient. The more impatient he was, the more chaotic the situation was. It naturally made it even more difficult to resolve the move.
