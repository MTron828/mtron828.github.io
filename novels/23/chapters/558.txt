Chapter 559: Emperor’s Order

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Oh? Emperor Golden Snake had been hiding his true power?”

This fact aroused the black-robed elder’s interest, but he was instantly stunned when he learned that Emperor Golden Snake had comprehended the Phantom Saber Principle and displayed the terrifying Triple Phantom Saber Moves.

“Phantom? Phantom Dao?”

“So he is the human emperor that Crystal-armored Monster Emperor has been looking for?”

The elder was so astonished that his glowing red eyes almost popped out of his head. He read through the report carefully once again and studied the profile of Emperor Golden Snake before finally coming to a conclusion.

“Although Emperor Golden Snake had comprehended the Phantom Dao, he hid it from the others and kept a low profile. It wasn’t until the life-death duel with Jian Wushuang that he was finally forced to expose these techniques.”?The elder’s eyes sparkled.

“Right!”

“Emperor Golden Snake is the only human expert who mastered the Phantom Dao, so he must be the one Crystal-armored Monster Emperor has been looking for.

“Finally, Crystal-armored Monster Emperor can get him!

“However, he is already dead.”?The elder pondered.?“Whatever, it’s better to report the news to Crystal-armored Monster Emperor first.”

The elder immediately sent a message to Crystal-armored Monster Emperor.

The Monster’s Territory was much more vast than the human’s territory.

In a certain part of the territory, there was a large ancient forest, which was home to a group of horrible monsters known as the Crystal-armored Monster Clan.

At the center of the forest, there was a cave mansion that led to the underground.

A sudden loud shout broke the silence inside the mansion.

“Haha, after searching for so many years, we have finally tracked down that damn human emperor!”

The voice was domineering, with a hit of joy and excitement mixed in. It was also so loud that it resounded through the area and disturbed the tranquility of the forest.

“I never thought that Emperor Golden Snake would be the man I was looking for since he was a nameless Divine Emperor. It’s been 40 years since he seized the compass by relying on his Phantom Dao.

“He knew I was looking for him, so he never displayed that technique to others during all these years.

“He remained hidden for so long, only to expose himself while facing a deadly situation, but he still died in the end. What a pity!

“Since he is dead, the compass must have fallen into the hands of Sword Emperor.

“Sword Emperor.”

The muttering voice suddenly became excited.

“Tell them to kill Sword Emperor at all costs, then bring his body and Interspatial Ring back to me,” the voice ordered.

“That compass belongs to me alone.”

Inside the monster spies’ information center, the black-robed elder had just received the order from Crystal-armored Monster Emperor.

“Sure enough, Crystal-armored Monster Emperor ordered to us to kill Sword Emperor, no matter the cost.”

“However, Sword Emperor is a superior emperor and it will be hard for us to kill him with only the current force that is hidden in the Human Territory.”

The elder was staring at the ground, lost in thought, but he quickly reached a decision and looked up.?“It seems that we have to ask that lord for help.”

Among the monster spies in Human Territory, some of them were powerful while some were weak.

The weak were the Demonic Beasts in the Saint Realm and Cloud Realm, but the most powerful ones could even fight against Divine Generals and Divine Emperors.

Some talented spies even managed to have a breakthrough in their cultivation after entering the Human Territory.

Among those spies, the most powerful one should be “Ji “, who had exceeded the power of a Rank Nine Monster and reached the level of a Monster King.

In the Monster-exterminating League, Monster Kings were supreme experts that were as powerful as Temple Masters.

“Master Ji.” The black-robed elder went to a secret chamber and called out respectfully.

The chamber was closed all year round because the master spent most of his time cultivating and rarely came out.

“What’s the matter?” The master asked in a frigid voice.

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor ordered us to kill a human emperor at all costs and take his body and Interspatial Ring back.

“However, this human emperor is a superior emperor that is extremely powerful. We can’t kill him on our own, so I came to ask you for help,” The elder answered.

As soon as the elder’s voice fell, the chamber opened and a hairy, black-skinned man came out. The man was over two meters tall and looked as strong as a brown bear. He was none other than Ji.

“You just said it was Crystal-armored Monster Emperor’s order?” Ji stared at the elder.

“Yes.” The elder nodded. “I’ve just received the order, but you can verify it yourself.”

Without hesitation, Ji sent a message to Crystal-armored Monster Emperor and quickly received a positive answer.

Even though he was Monster King and as powerful as a Human Temple Master, he was no match for Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, so he dared not go against the emperor’s order.

After all, Crystal-armored Monster Emperor was a true overlord among the monsters.

“Where is Sword Emperor?” Ji questioned. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“He is in the Holy Place,” said the elder.

“The Holy Place?” Ji shook his head. “The Holy Place is very important to the humans, so the number one expert, Temple Master Black Spirit, always keeps an eye on it. It’s also where the relic is stored, so I would only be seeking death if I went there to kill Sword Emperor.”

“I understand. From now on, I’ll have someone waiting outside the Holy Place at all times,” said the elder, “As far as I know, Sword Emperor is an outsider who is only in the Saint Realm. He chose to stay and act as a Divine Emperor of the Monster-exterminating League, so he must be planning to improve himself with the league’s resources.

“To gain those resources he will need to hand over Monster Cores and to gain those cores he has to leave the Holy Place. Once he enters the military camp or our monster territory, we’ll have the perfect chance to kill him.”

“Fine. When he leaves the Holy Place, make sure to inform me.”

After saying this, Ji walked back into the chamber.
