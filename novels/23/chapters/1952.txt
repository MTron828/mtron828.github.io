Chapter 1953 Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror

Rumble.

The moment Emperor God Xie Xin died, the two black shadows that were holding Jian Wushuang back vanished into thin air and the universe resumed tranquility.

Jian Wushuang moved and appeared next to Emperor God Xie Xin.

Looking at Emperor God Xie Xin’s dead body, Jian Wushuang looked solemn.

“Master, Jian Yi is useless,” Jian Yi stood next to him in reverence.

“I can’t blame you for this. I was too careless as I belittled Emperor God Xie Xin,” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice, “At first, I though Emperor God Xie Xin was only an Emperor God at the bottom of the tier and shouldn’t be able to stir up any commotion in my hands. I thought I could ask him about how he got onto this battlefield in detail before I killed him.”

“But I never expected that Emperor God Xie Xin would be so decisive and start running for his life. Plus, his power has increased tremendously since before!”

From what Jian Wushuang knew, Emperor God Xie Xin was only an ordinary Emperor God and he didn’t have any special skilsl.

However, Emperor God Xie Xin had put his power and skill on display and shocked Jian Wushuang.

“If I’m not mistaken, Emperor God Xie Xin should have stayed on the battlefield for a long time and he has received many opportunities. Hence, his power has improved so tremendously and he has so many unique treasures. With the aid of the treasures, he nearly escaped,” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

If Emperor God Xie Xin were to flee successfully, they would be in big trouble.

However, although Jian Yi had killed Emperor God Xie Xin, he had broken an opening on the formation from One Realm Pearl earlier.

Even though Jian Yi had killed him immediately, Emperor God Xie Xin could totally have sent out a message in that short timeframe!

“From the moment I saw Emperor God Xie Xin, I sealed off the surrounding spacetime to make sure he couldn’t send out any messages. But then, when he broke the formation of One Realm Pearl, the spacetime was sealed off too. I didn’t know if he sent anyone any messages. If he did, we will be in big trouble,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

He was most worried that the ancient battlefield and Green Fire World were exposed.

By then, it would attract not just one or two experts. Experts from all over Eternal Chaotic World would flood in.

The reason why he had killed Emperor God Xie Xin was to shut him up.

The most troublesome thing was that he didn’t know if Emperor Xie Xin had told anyone else about the ancient battlefield when he had been wandering there.

If he really did tell the others and there was someone who knew he had died, the person would most likely exposed anew to the public.

By then…

“Emperor God Xie Xin didn’t seem to have a best friend with who could go through thick and thin together. And the ancient battlefield has such great opportunities, he shouldn’t have told anyone but kept it all to himself,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Of course, he was only guessing. He couldn’t determine what exactly had gone on.

“Regardless of if there was a second person who knew of the ancient battlefield, I couldn’t be bothered so much. It’s best that I focus on improving myself,” Jian Wushuang clenched his hand and he then looked at the Qian Kun ring in Emperor God Xie Xin’s hand.

Emperor God Xie Xin had been wandering in the surrounding battlefield for so many years, he should have received many opportunities.

Forget about the rest, just the bronze mirror that he took out and the half-stone rod that he had broken were unusual.

Jian Wushuang immediately started inspecting.

After a while, when Jian Wushuang flipped his hand, there was a bronze mirror that gave out a strange aura appeared in his hand. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“The bronze mirror…”

Jian Wushuang could feel how extraordinary the bronze mirror was and he immediately started refining it.

After a while, he found out the name and the function of the bronze mirror.

“Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror contains five godly spirits and is fed by divine power. It could explode with terrifying fighting power!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shimmering with joy.

He knew that the two black shadows that popped out of the Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror were two godly spirits from the realm.

In Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror, there were five godly spirits.

The five godly spirits were the creator of the Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror. He removed the consciousness of five experts using thunderous measures then refined the five experts’ spirits into the mirror. He fed the five godly spirits using divine power and woke them up when he was in a fight.

As for the strength of the five godly spirits, it depended on the level of divine power fed.

“Remove experts’ consciousness and refined their spirit into godly spirit. Such a cruel measure,” Jian Wushuang complimented.

He could tell that the refinery method of the five fire Godly Spirit Mirror was extremely cruel.

The treasure could be considered a ruffian treasure.

However, like the saying, in this world, there was not wicked treasure, only wicked treasure users.

“The more divine power it’s fed and the purer it is, the stronger the fighting power of the godly spirits will be,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

He could feel that the five godly spirits in the Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror were starving.

It was obvious that the five godly spirits power had been drained long ago as they had stayed in the ancient battlefield for so many years without divine power.

It wouldn’t be long until Emperor God Xie Xin had obtained the Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror. Although he had been feeding them with divine power, he was an ordinary Emperor God after all. Even after he fed them, he could merely wake two godly spirits up to fight.

Plus, the fighting power of the two godly spirits could only reached the level of an ordinary Peak Emperor God according to his divine power strength. They weren’t exactly strong.

However, if the Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror were to be in Jian Wushaung’s hand, that’d be entirely different.

Jian Wushuang was an inverse cultivator. Although he had yet to step foot on the seventh step of inverse cultivation, his divine power strength was absolutely comparable to an Emperor God’s. In collaboration with the power of ancient tribe bloodline, he would be far beyond an ordinary Emperor God. Plus, his divine power was far beyond an ordinary Emperor God’s, much vaster.

If he were to feed the five godly spirits with his all…

“There’s no hurry. I’ll try after I return to the secret room,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Besides the Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror, Emperor God Xie Xin had many treasures in his Qian Kun Ring. Most of them were Chaotic Divine Treasure. As for the defense armor itself, there were a total of three pieces.

Just like the one Emperor God Xie Xin was wearing. It was also extremely powerful armor.

“No wonder when I attacked with four Hong Jun Golden Swords earlier, he could withstand it so easily. It turns out that not only his power has reached the level of a Peak Emperor God, most importantly, he has a powerful defense armor. It seems that he has wandered in the surrounding ancient battlefield for many years,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

He briefly went through his treasure and Jian Wushuang was quite satisfied.

It was a pity that there was no other useful treasure for Jian Wushuang besides the Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirror.
