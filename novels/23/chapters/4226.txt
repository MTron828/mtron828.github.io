4227 The Night Banquet

The Jiuxi Holy Land disciples sighed.

Holy Maiden Jiuxi was slightly stunned. She looked at her senior brothers who were usually full of pride and confidence. She could not believe it.

She had thought that after she finished speaking, these senior brothers would forget about Jian Wushuang and even join forces with him to fight against Heavenly Snake Playboy.

She did not expect that her senior brothers were so afraid of Heavenly Snake Playboy that their first reaction was to think that Jian Wushuang had implicated them when they heard that she was being chased by a Ruler under Heavenly Snake Playboy and then saved by Jian Wushuang.

!!

How absurd was this?

Gradually, the disbelief in her eyes turned into a strong sense of unfamiliarity and disappointment.

Ruler Lange’s expression had been ugly to begin with, but he sharply caught Jiuxi’s expression. His eyes flickered as he glared at the disciples behind him. “What are you all saying? That Blood Sword saved the Holy Maiden Jiuxi, which is a great favor to the Jiuxi Holy Land. Why do you blame him?”

After he finished speaking, the saint land disciples immediately shrank back in fear. However, there was still a hint of resentment in their eyes.

“Eldest apprentice-brother, the Blood Sword only needed to drive the five iron-skirted Rulers away. Why did you kill them? Now, we’ve completely fallen out with Heavenly Snake Playboy. When Heavenly Snake Playboy is really angry, Blood Sword can just leave without a word. No one knows him anyway. But what should we do? Why should the people killed by the Blood Sword be blamed on us?” The disciple called kuang yi muttered.

“Shut up!”

Ruler Lange glared at him, then turned to Holy Maiden Jiuxi. He let out a sigh and smiled wryly. “Junior Sister Jiuyi, don’t blame me for being straightforward. Although what Junior Brother Kuang Yi said was a little harsh, it wasn’t without reason. What the Blood Sword did was indeed too reckless.”

“It would have been the best way to negotiate with Heavenly Snake Playboy. after all, no matter how strong Heavenly Snake Playboy is, he has to give face to the Jiuxi Holy Land, right? Now that we’ve killed his men, the peace talks are impossible.”

Hearing this, Holy Miaden Jiuxi looked at the faces of Lange and Kuang Yi and felt a chill in her heart.

So, the senior brothers that she had admired in the past was such a group of people who were afraid of death?

Holding on to her last hope, Holy Miaden Jiuxi took a deep breath and asked, “Senior brother, what should we do now?”

Ruler Lange chuckled. “Don’t worry, Junior Sister. I’m not someone who’s afraid of trouble. However, Heavenly Snake Lord is very powerful right now. With just the few of us, we’re no match for him.”

Holy Maiden Jiuxi frowned upon hearing this.

Ruler Lange continued to laugh. “Junior Sister, don’t worry. I’ve already found out that the governor of the Sixth City, Divine Lord Tiancang, is preparing to host a banquet tonight to welcome the geniuses and rookies of the Sixth City. I happen to be on his invitation list. Later on, I’ll bring all of you to attend his banquet.”

At this point, Lange’s face showed a touch of pride, as if it was an extremely proud thing to be invited by a Divine Lord Tiancang.

After a pause, he continued, “Junior Sister, you may not know this, but Divine Lord Tiancang has always been at odds with Heavenly Snake Playboy. In the early years, his clan was almost exterminated by Heavenly Snake Playboy. We might be able to persuade Divine Lord Tiancang at the banquet to fight with us to resist Heavenly Snake Playboy.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“In this case, no matter how powerful Heavenly Snake playboy is, he would have some scruples.”

Hearing this, Holy Maiden Jiuxi’s heart skipped a beat.

She naturally knew who Divine Lord Tiancang was. He was a veteran Ultimate Ruler who had been at the level of an Ultimate Ruler for more than ten chaos cycles. His power was unquestionable, and he was definitely an expert among the Ultimate Rulers.

If Divine Lord Tiancang could really help them fight against Heavenly Snake Playboy, they might really have a chance to do so.

“Alright,” he said.

The Holy Maiden Jiuxi nodded and said, “Senior brother, I’ll tell Sir Blood Sword about this. After all, I’m involved in Sir Blood Sword killing the Ruler under Heavenly Snake Playboy. I’ll have to invite him to attend Divine Lord Tiancang’s banquet.

“This…” Lange hesitated for a moment, but he nodded helplessly when he saw Jiuxi’s determined look. “Alright, as long as the Blood Sword is well-behaved and doesn’t cause trouble at Divine Lord Tiancang’s banquet, it will be fine.”

Hearing that, Holy Maiden Jiuxi smiled slightly and did not reply. She turned around and walked toward Jian Wushuang and the other man.

Lange looked at Jiuxi’s back as she left. His eyes gradually narrowed, and he snorted.

…

“Blood Sword, come with us to Divine Lord Tiancang’s banquet later.” Jiuxi walked to Jian Wushuang and said with a sweet smile.

“Divine Lord Tiancang? A banquet?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“Yes, Divine Lord Tiancang is recognized as the number one person in the Sixth City. We might be able to seek his protection and fight against Heavenly Snake Playboy together.” The Holy Maiden Jiuxi smiled.

Then, Holy Maiden Jiuxi told Jian Wushuang about Divine Lord Tiancang.

After hearing this, Jian Wushuang pondered for a while and shook his head, “I won’t be attending Divine Lord Tiancang’s banquet. You guys can go on your own. I’ll deal with Heavenly Snake Playboy myself.”

Hearing that, Jiuxi became anxious and quickly said, “Sir Blood Sword, that Heavenly Snake Playboy is very powerful. We are definitely not his match alone. Only by gathering all our strength can we have a chance to fight him…”

“Junior Sister, if Sir Blood Sword doesn’t want to go, then don’t force him. Perhaps Sir Blood Sword is bold and doesn’t need our help?”

Lange suddenly came over and said with a fake smile.

“Senior brother!”

Hearing this, Jiuxi was furious. She looked at Lange with fire in her eyes.

She had always been a sensitive person, so how could she not see the hidden hostility between Lange and Jian Wushuang?

Lange ignored him and looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile, saying, “Sir Blood Sword, am I right?”

Jian Wushuang replied calmly, “You’re right.”

After a pause, Jian Wushuang cupped his hands and said calmly, “Ruler Lange, Holy Maiden Jiuxi, why don’t we part ways here?”

After saying that, Jian Wushuang did not care whether they agreed or not. He took Ruler Hao Jin and walked into the distance.
