Chapter 473: The Dragon Blood Gem Mine

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Magic Flame Lord is domineering. As we’re part of the same camp and the Dragon Blood Gem Mine is in our territory, he agreed to share the gems with us 50/50. However, I heard that because our previous lord has died, Magic Flame Lord intended to hog all of it.

“Though you are our lord, I’m afraid Magic Flame Lord would not pay you any mind,” Bing Huo said in a solemn tone.

“Oh, really?” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

He had read the information on Magic Flame Lord and knew about his character.

“Bing Huo,” Jian Wushuang said while looking at him, “let’s go visit Magic Flame Lord.”

“Visit Magic Flame Lord? Now?” Bing Huo was surprised.

“Yep, right now,” Jian Wushuang replied with a faint smile.

Soon after that, they set out.

The Magic Flame Territory was next to the Blood Sword Territory, so they had contact with each other.

One day later, Jian Wushuang arrived at the Lord Mansion in the Magic Flame Territory.

“Please tell your lord that Blood Sword Lord pays him a visit,” Bing Huo said to a guard of the Lord Mansion.

“Blood Sword Lord?” The guard glanced at Jian Wushuang and sneered. “A Saint Realm expert dares to call himself lord? Piss off!”

Bing Huo’s face fell. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

But Jian Wushuang wore an indifferent expression as he slowly opened his mouth.

“Magic Flame Lord!”

Jian Wushuang cried out. His voice seemed to be full of magic, reverberating through the entire mansion and lasting for a long time.

A peevish, glum elder had been absorbed in a manual, when suddenly... He heard the voice, narrowed his eyes, and raised his head.

When he stepped out and appeared in the sky above the mansion, he immediately saw Jian Wushuang with his hands behind his back.

“He is...” Magic Flame Lord was shocked and a little bit angry.

He had not participated in the exploration of the Puppet Master Cave Mansion, but he knew what had happened there.

He knew many experts died and an expert named Swordsman rose in the fight.

Swordsman was only a Saint Realm expert, but he had overwhelming strength, which could terrify intermediate lords.

In the fight for the four Interspatial Rings, Swordsman killed Demon Soul Lord and Myriad Islands Lord by using some techniques.

Demon Soul Lord was a superior lord.

Although Myriad Islands Lord was just an advanced lord, he was the top master of formations and was not weaker than a superior lord.

However, they had all been killed by Swordsman.

Moreover, Swordsman had a Puppet Fighter at the marquis level.

Therefore, Swordsman had already become famous among the two camps.

“Sir, are you Swordsman?” Magic Flame Lord went over and said with a smile as well as a hint of modesty.

“Sir?” Bing Huo was a bit surprised, as Magic Flame Lord treated Swordsman respectfully.

“Magic Flame Lord, your guard didn’t let me in and was even unwilling to send a message for me, so I had to shout. Please excuse me,” Jian Wushuang said with a faint smile.

On hearing this, Magic Flame Lord’s face fell. He looked toward his guards. The guard who had refused Deng Huo’s request was terrified, dripping with cold sweat.

“Idiot, come and apologize to Sir Swordsman.” Magic Flame Lord scolded him.

The guard immediately kneeled down and offered his apology.

“Don’t worry about it.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand.

Then he looked at Magic Flame Lord and said, “Magic Flame Lord, I’ve just taken up the post of Blood Sword Lord, so I came to pay you a visit.”

“Blood Sword Lord?” Magic Flame Lord was a bit shocked, but he immediately realized why Jian Wushuang had come here.

“Sir... no... Blood Sword Lord, let’s go down and have a chat,” Magic Flame Lord said.

“Fine.” Jian Wushuang nodded and then gave an order to Bing Huo. “Stay here.”

“Okay.” Bing Huo nodded respectfully.

Jian Wushuang and Magic Flame Lord then left. Bing Huo stood in the void with an odd look on his face.

“What happened? Why did I feel that Magic Flame Lord was in awe of our lord?

“Right, he must have been in awe of him. Otherwise, he would not have treated our lord so politely.”

...

Not long after, Jian Wushuang walked out of the Lord Mansion, while Magic Flame Lord personally saw him out.

“Bing Huo, let’s go,” Jian Wushuang said. Then they left for the Blood Sword Territory.

Magic Flame Lord finally felt relieved.

On the way back to the Blood Sword Territory, Bing Huo asked in curiosity, “Lord, what did you say to Magic Flame Lord?”

“Nothing. We were just having a courteous talk, and I casually mentioned the Dragon Blood Gem Mine,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Casually mentioned?” Bing Huo frowned.

“Right, that was enough,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile. “Don’t worry, Magic Flame Lord is not stupid. He should know what to do.”

On hearing this, Bing Huo did not ask anything further.

Soon after they came back, Bing Huo received the news that the people from the Magic Flame Territory had withdrawn from the Dragon Blood Gem Mine and clearly indicated that they would not step foot in the mine again.

Bing Huo was stunned.

In his mind, Magic Flame Lord was extremely domineering. When did he become so kind?

Bing Huo did not know that Magic Flame Lord was just overbearing toward the weak, like the previous Blood Sword Lord, who was a novice lord.

But when it came to Jian Wushuang, things were different.

Even an advanced lord or a superior lord would treat Jian Wushuang politely. Magic Flame Lord was just an intermediate lord, so he did not dare to act in a domineering manner. He even worried that he might piss off Jian Wushuang and get killed by him.

The Dragon Blood Gem Mine and even the Blood Sword Territory calmed down. Jian Wushuang had solidified his position.

The fifth day after they returned, the Marquis Piaoxue Camp sent something to him.

“Finally,” Jian Wushuang thought with a hint of expectation.

The thing that the courier had sent here cost Jian Wushuang 80,000 battle achievements.
