Chapter 3142: Heart-Killing Sorcery

——

“With the help of the eighth level of the Samsara Sword Formation and the realm of ice-fire swimming dragon ruler, it’s really easy for me to kill these rank six Peak True Saints.” Jian Wushuang was proud of the void, a faint smile appeared on his lips.

Then he looked at the battlefield next to him.

Whoosh!

He moved and rushed toward the battlefield.

On the battlefield, Xin Wu and Dao Dragon were fighting fiercely. Xin Wu had been completely suppressed and was even forced to retreat.

At this time, he saw Jian Wushuang rushing toward him again.

“Trash! A bunch of trash!”

Xin Wu cursed loudly, his eyes surging with fury.

He had never expected that his four rank six Peak True Saints and an initial rank six True Saint would be unable to deal with a little guy who was only a rank four True Saint.

Not to mention being able to do anything, even they themselves had died at the hands of this rank four True Saint.

Dao Dragon was also looking at Jian Wushuang with a strange light. “Heavenly Sword Marquis…I have been in the Divine Beginning World for more than 100,000 years and have seen countless geniuses. I have even seen the super geniuses of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, Dao Palace, and the spacetime temple. But I have to say, among all the geniuses I have seen, you can definitely be ranked first!”

“A rank four True Saint can easily slaughter a rank six Peak True Saint. Even I have to admire his ability!”

Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “Lord Dao Dragon, the heart witch is the only one left in the Purple Cloud Pavilion. Why don’t you and I join hands and leave the heart witch here?”

“Leave the heart witch here?” Dao Dragon was stunned.

The heart witch was very famous in the First Heaven.

After Dao Dragon fought with the heart witch, he found that the latter was indeed very difficult to deal with.

Although he was much stronger than the heart witch, he had never thought of leaving her here. However, Jian Wushuang…actually had such a thought?

“The Purple Cloud Pavilion and I have a great enmity. I don’t know how many experts of the Purple Cloud Pavilion died at my hands, but the premise is that you and I have to have the strength to leave her here,” Dao Dragon said.

“Let’s try.” Jian Wushuang just smiled.

Jian Wushuang and Dao Dragon did not conceal their conversation, and the heart witch standing in front of them heard it very clearly.

“Boy, I admire you. Not only because of your talent and your incredible ability to jump levels, but also because of your arrogance. Even an Invincible Immortal Saint doesn’t have the courage to say that you can keep me. Are you and Dao Dragon qualified to do so?” The heart witch’s eyes were cold, he stared at Jian Wushuang.

“It might be difficult for an Invincible Immortal Saint to stay, but it’s different for me.” Jian Wushuang just smiled coldly. As he laughed, he suddenly waved his hand.

“Buzz!” An invisible power burst out, and in the blink of an eye, a huge barrier appeared in the surrounding void.

This barrier was like an iron bucket, surrounding all directions, not leaving a single crack.

“A formation?” Heart shaman frowned, but then sneered, “A mere rank four True Saint casually setting up a formation, and you dare to use it to show off? How ridiculous.”

After saying this, heart shaman snorted coldly, and instantly, a majestic black fog surged out. This black fog condensed in the surrounding void space, immediately forming a three meter long black spear. This black spear had a cold aura, after it was formed, it charged toward the barrier closest to the heart shaman.

Hong!

The black spear was extremely terrifying, and was comparable to a full-strength strike of a high-level True Saint.

However, when it struck the barrier, not only did it not break, it did not even budge.

The full-strength strike of a high-level True Saint was actually unable to break the barrier.

“How is this possible?” The heart witch was shocked.

Even Dao Dragon could not help feeling shocked.

“The heart witch has indeed used her true strength, but she could not break the barrier at all. Even if I attack it myself, I’m afraid it would be difficult to break the barrier,” Dao Dragon muttered, he could not help looking at Jian Wushuang again. “A rank four True Saint can casually set up such a powerful magic array. He must have a treasure in his hand, and it must be of a very high level!”

Dao Dragon was right. Jian Wushuang had used the ruler seal!

The ruler seal ruled over time and space.

Although it was not a supreme treasure, its value was definitely not lower than that of ordinary supreme treasures.

With Jian Wushuang’s current rank seven True Saint’s divine power, the power of the ruler seal formed by the formation could only be broken by an Invincible Saint.

As for the heart witch, although her means were very good, she was still far from being able to break the formation compared to an Invincible Saint. Of course, it was impossible for her to break the formation.

In the void, seeing that his attack did not shake the formation at all, Xin Wu’s face turned ugly.

“Boy, you have such a treasure that can seal time and space. You can use it to break the space-time seal from the beginning and then leave the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s nest.” Xin Wu stared at Jian Wushuang coldly.

“Yes, if I wanted to leave, I could have done so 90 years ago when you sealed the space-time. Unfortunately, I don’t like being forced into such a sorry state. Besides, you are not qualified to force me to use the space tunnel to escape.” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly, then he looked at Dao Dragon.

“Lord Dao Dragon, I have completely sealed the surrounding space. Xin Wu can’t escape. Now you and I just need to work together to find a way to kill him.”

“As long as we can completely trap him and prevent him from escaping, it’s possible to kill him.” Dao Dragon nodded.

The reason why he was not confident in leaving the heart shaman behind was that the heart shaman’s life-saving methods were extremely good. However, with the time-space seal, which completely cut off the heart shaman’s escape space, there was a great chance to kill him.

“In that case, what are you waiting for? Let’s do it.” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Dao Dragon’s eyes turned cold, and his body suddenly moved.

As If teleporting, he appeared in front of the heart shaman. Then he clenched his right hand tightly and threw a punch.

This punch contained incredible power. When he threw it, the entire void trembled crazily.

Feeling the power coming from his fist, the mental wizard’s expression changed drastically, and he quickly moved to block it.
