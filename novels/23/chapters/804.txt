“That’s it.” Yang Zaixuan nodded.

Then he added, “You’ll see our Big Brother Wang Yuan when you get to the Tang of the East. He’s the chief alchemist there now. He’s a lot better than the two of us.”

“The chief alchemist of the Tang of the East?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes flew open in surprise.

He had known Wang Yuan had great talent in alchemy, but he was not expecting him to be so incredible.

“He actually has become the chief alchemist of the Tang of the East in such a short time!”?Jian Wushuang sighed in his heart with astonishment.

“Oh, Third brother, why did you get into a fight with Lei Xin of the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion? He seemed to be dying to kill you,” Yang Zaixuan asked curiously.

“Lei Xin’s disciple is an enemy whom I had tried every means to kill in the Ancient World. Today I have tried in vain to assassinate him. And Lei Xin found me in some way I didn’t know, so there you go,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“The enemy of the Ancient World? You haven’t killed him yet?” Yang Zaixuan frowned.

“He’s too lucky!” Jian Wushuang smiled bitterly.

If Su Ming hadn’t brought a lifesaving item with him today, Jian Wushuang would have already killed him.

“Lei Xin is not only powerful but also a Guest Elder of the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion with great power. Besides, he’s extremely difficult to get rid of. It’s not a good thing to be targeted by him. Third brother be careful!” Yang Zaixuan reminded him.

“Got it!” Jian Wushuang replied. He did not despise Lei Xin at all.

“By the way, is this mansion yours?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, as a commander of the Cercis Army, I have an independent mansion just for me,” Yang Zaixuan answered.

“Then it should be safe here. Lei Xin wouldn’t dare break in, would he?” Jian Wushuang continued.

“Of course, no matter how bold he is, he would never try to break into the mansion of a commander of the Cercis Army,” Yang Zaixuan said with confidence.

“Good,” Jian Wushuang nodded again and smiled, “Second brother, please get me a secret chamber. I want to have closed-door cultivation for a few days.”

“Have closed-door cultivation?” Yang Zaixuan was a little dumbfounded.

“I have a bottleneck, and I am on the edge of a breakthrough. I learned something from the fierce battle with Lei Xin just now. I only need to cultivate quietly for a few days, then I can break through this bottleneck and make a huge improvement in strength. By then I could contend with Lei Xin.” Jian Wushuang said seriously.

“Oh, I see,” Yang Zaixuan understood and nodded, “I’ll get everything ready for you at once then.”

After he prepared everything Jian Wushuang asked for, Jian Wushuang immediately went in and began to cultivate.

He had indeed learned a great deal from his battle with Lei Xin, even if it had not lasted too long.

Long ago, his Sword Heart had reached the top of Level Two, only one step away from Level Three.

He already felt that he could break through to Level Three, and through the battle with Lei Xin, he had found the opportunity.

Jian Wushuang sat quietly cross-legged in a secret chamber with his eyes closed and surrounded by layers of shocking Sword Essence.

The Sword Essence was extremely profound and complex.

Some were wanton, some fierce and domineering, and some others introverted and plain.

In the end, these layers of Sword Essence fully integrated.

The Unification Sword!

No matter how different the Sword Essence was, the essence was still the same. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

After all, a sword was a sword!

The Sword Essence was the Sword Essence!

“My Sword Heart is going to reach Level Three!”

Jian Wushuang abruptly opened his eyes and a sharp sword light shot out of them. In his sea of consciousness, the extremely formidable Sword Heart began to change.

In a moment, the metamorphosis was over.

Now his Sword Heart had broken through to Level Three!

And his overall strength had also made a qualitative leap.

His Sword Heart was now 10 times stronger.

At the same time, his swordsmanship attainments would reach a new height.

All in all, his power had shot up!

“When I fought with Lei Xin, my Sword Heart was only at the top of Level Two. I was completely suppressed by him, and could only rely on my swordsmanship along with the tough body of the Ancient God to barely contend with him. Now with my Sword Heart breakthrough, my strength has soared. I don’t have to be afraid of him ever again if I fight him head-on.”?Jian Wushuang contemplated this happily, clenching his hands.

He spent three days in the closed-door cultivation.

When he walked out after the breakthrough, Yang Zaixuan immediately came to him.

“How is it, Third brother?” Yang Zaixuan demanded with concern.

“It went smoothly. No obstacles.” Jian Wushuang answered with a broad smile on his face.

“So are you confident you can beat Lei Xin?” Yang Zaixuan looked at him closely.

“Yes, I’ll go this evening.” Jian Wushuang said confidently, with his eyes flashing sharp light.

“This evening?” Yang Zaixuan’s mouth lifted. He then went on, “Do you need any help?”

“No, thank you Second brother. It’s easy for me to beat Lei Xin now. I won’t stand on ceremony if I need your help.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Yang Zaixuan shrugged his shoulders and said nothing more.

He was cold by nature, only slightly warmer to Jian Wushuang, Wang Yuan and Su Rou. He didn’t care about other people at all.

Jian Wushuang soon set off to go to Lei Xin alone.

The bright moon climbed high in the sky.

Ablaze with lights, Cercis Island was still bustling.

There were still a lot of people on the block of the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion.

Jian Wushuang, dressed in a black robe, could see the situation of that block clearly.

“Huh, as I guessed, Su Ming has become more cautious after the last assassination attempt. Previously, he did not leave the block of Heavenly Cloud Pavilion but would walk around the block. However, now he spends all day with his Master in that shop. As soon as I get close to that shop, his Master will probably notice.”

Jian Wushuang hid in the void with the information he had collected.

“He is so careful. It is a lot harder for me to kill him now. I have to lure him away!”

Jian Wushuang smiled faintly and quickly came up with a plan.

Whoosh!

With a move of his thought, a man suddenly appeared beside him. It was his Slaughter Body.

In order to kill Su Ming, he would have to act in tandem with his Slaughter Body.

Then he began to take action.

His World Body held the Emperor Sword and flew away quietly, while his Slaughter Body remained where he was, carefully hidden.
