Chapter 5300: Northern Region

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Directly thrown out by him, thrown into the outer hall, no one paid any attention to him.

Now, he has become more sensible, choosing to join the Elders’ Palace. He felt quite satisfied.

Upon hearing Zhen Lings words, Wu Zuo quickly coiled up the large snake beneath his feet and respectfully bowed, saying, “Wu Zuo pays his respects to

Lord Zhen Ling.”

The other elders of the Elders’ Palace, witnessing this scene, became even more certain of Wu Zuo’s outstanding identity. He would definitely be promoted in the future, and they needed to be cautious around him.

Those who could meet Zhen Ling were all A-level figures in the Elders’ Palace.

Among them was ‘Yang Sanmu’, an infamous fierce general under the Qishen Temple, known for his strength and ability to refine treasures. Despite being only at the tier 5, his status was lofty.

“Alright, I came here without any specific reason. I’m leaving the MO Yin Mountain to you from now on. The tasks in the Original Realm are heavy, and the Elders’ Palace has just been established. You should share the burden,” Zhen Ling said in a lofty manner, then pointed into the void.

“Look at what a mess the Northern Region has become. You should shoulder the responsibility for the White Tiger Temple. The Northern Region will be completely under your management in the future. If I see such a scene again the next time 1 come, you won’t like the consequences.”

The scene outlined by Zhen Ling depicted the entire Northern Region of the Heaven Realm, where battles were raging everywhere, and countless strong individuals were perishing.

In fact, such situations were normal. If there were no risks of falling, how many people would venture into the secrets of the Heaven Realm?

He just wanted to take this opportunity to pressure the White Tiger Temple. He casually assigned one-fifth of the territory of the Heaven Realm to the Elders’ Palace with a wave of his hand.

The Master of the White Tiger Temple would surely be infuriated.

If the Elders’ Palace had once followed the Qishen Temple’s elders, the Four Temples wouldn’t have been so opposed.

Now, the Elders’ Palace was filled with a bunch of lowly individuals.

Those top-ranking elders of the past hadn’t recovered at all. After recovering, they were competing for power with these newly revived beings.

Some of these revived Emperors seemed dazed, appearing to reprimand them for neglecting their duties, but then immediately handed over a large piece of territory to them.

“Yes! Your subordinate will definitely live up to Lord Zhen Lings expectations.”

Everyone bowed in unison, their expressions solemn, but inside, they were overjoyed.

The entire Northern Territory!

How many of them were there, a few thousand at most?

The entire Northern Territory was theirs, with Zhen Ling backing them up.

Management?

What a joke!

To put it nicely, they were supposed to manage this territory, but in reality, it was all about plundering.

Those who didn’t obey were annihilated outright, while the obedient ones had to provide treasures and resources.

In this vast Northern Territory, there were quite a few tier 6 Emperors. In terms of strength, these people might not measure up, but with the Imperial Ranking supporting them, suppressing them was a piece of cake.

In the Elder Palace, there were also several tier 6 Emperors, ancient powerhouses from bygone eras. They were not afraid. If they couldn’t win a fight, Zhen Ling had their backs.

Boom!

Zhen Ling sensed that the people from the White Tiger Temple were approaching. Before they even arrived, he waved his hand and directly pulled out the entire Demon-Sealing Pillar from the Demon Sound Mountain.

This scene not only shocked the Emperors on the mountain but also sent shivers down the spines of the elders outside.

The ancient Divine Masters of that era were probably not much stronger than this!

Just how much of Qishen’s power did Zhen Ling inherit to become this formidable?

In Zhen Lings hands, the Demon-Sealing Pillar was like a toy.

The chains were directly torn apart.

As soon as Zhen Ling felt his body free from restraint, Zhen Ling grabbed him in his hand.

“The Emperors from the Demon Sound Mountain, after they descend the mountain, take them to the Elder Palace. As for sending them to the second prison, I’ll leave that to you.”

With a single hand, Zhen Ling threw the bound Shan Jun to Wu Zuo.

“Yes!” Wu Zuo bowed and accepted the order!

The person before him was a familiar face.

Back then, he even had connections with a few Demon Lords. Now, times had changed, and these Demon Lords, stripped of their powers from Qishen, all met this fate.

Back then, Qishen had made it clear: be kind, do not release harm upon other universes. Now, he was thrown into the Second Prison.

As a disciple of Qishen, Wu Zuo was well aware of the dangers inside, which made him tremble,

“Oh right, there’s a Grand Yan Immortal inheritor in Demon Sound Mountain. After his trial, make sure to deliver him intact to the Original Universe,” Zhen Ling said, glancing at Zhu Yi with a faint smile.

This was giving Zhu Yi some face.

Zhu Yi took a deep breath and had no choice but to express her gratitude, bowing respectfully.

A whole Demon Sound Mountain, completely wiped out!

It was handed over to the Elders’ Palace, leaving her with only one Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal.

She really wanted to thank Zhen Ling properly, but her strength wasn’t enough. Otherwise, she would have definitely expressed her gratitude!

“Don’t worry, 1 will personally escort him!” Wu Zuo took on the responsibility, not only sending Shan Jun to the Second Brison but also delivering a Grand Yan Immortal personally. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Very well, you may all leave!” Zhen Ling turned around, catching a glimpse of the divine temple in the White Tiger Temple before disappearing.

When Bai Yi arrived, Wu Zuo stood tall, exuding pride.

Outside, Jian Wushuang remained completely unaware.

He didn’t know that Shan Jun, who had shown him great kindness, was now in the Second Prison. He was also unaware of what the Second Prison represented.

Furthermore, he was now at the core of the Qishen Temple.

In the Universe Bronze Furnace, the scorching temperature was merely a fading glow. Once Jian Wushuang completed the Ninth Refinement, without the injection of a suitable cosmic origin source, the Universe Bronze Furnace would be useless.

In the outside world, just a moment passed.

Yet, in here, it had been 1,000 years!

A millennium had drained Jian Wushuangs power.

Even the origin source was starting to wither, and his physical body was still lacking that tiny bit.

Being reborn was the hardest part.

The previous eight refinements had prepared him for this moment, but this transformation was the final and most challenging trial.

The skeletal framework, possessing innate lines, was gradually forming, merging with the power of his flesh and blood, inch by inch.

The fusion of the two would lead to success.

“It’s over; the Beast God’s Domain can only hold on for one more year!’

The origin source had dried up; the power of all things had been exhausted long ago. Even with abundant Yan power, it couldn’t withstand the consumption within the Universe Bronze Furnace.

Jian Wushuang forcibly activated the origin source. Even with such a robust origin source, it was not enough. Without a sufficiently enhanced basic divine body, he had no hope of completing the Ninth Refinement.

His fundamental divine body was insufficient. If his fundamental divine body had been enhanced to a thousandfold, he wouldn’t need to resort to the Beast God’s Domain.

It had been manageable before; the temperature inside the Universe Bronze Furnace wasn’t too high, and he had persevered gradually.

Especially after the breakthrough of the origin, using the Beast God’s Domain made him even more adept. However, this time entering the Universe Bronze Furnace, he discovered his weakness..
