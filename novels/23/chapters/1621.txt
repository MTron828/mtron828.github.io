Chapter 1622: Star Moon Tower

“Tell me what Star Moon Tower exactly is. Why do so many Ancient Gods think that I am looking for trouble for myself?” Jian Wushuang asked King of Venomous Worms.

“Well, they are right. This Star Moon Tower is a dangerous place,” King of Venomous Worms said, “Star Moon Tower, as well as Ancient God Palace, was the legacy of the Ancient God Emperor. There has been a rule since a long time ago: Ancient Gods without pure blood cannot enter the Ancient God Palace, with only one exception.”

“This Star Moon Tower is the exception.”

“There are seven layers in it, of which the first four layers represent the Four Great Unique Skills, and the last three layers represent the Three Secret Skills. Those ancient gods without pure blood can enter the Ancient God Palace by passing the test in the Star Moon Tower. You can only get the Four Great Unique Skills after you finish the fourth layer of the tower. If you pass all seven layers, you will get both the Four Great Unique Skills and the Three Secret Skills.”

Jian Wushuang smiled, “But the Star Moon Tower test is not easy to pass, right?”

“You are right. You have to get through the first four floors without stopping, after which you can survive and have a rest. Then you can get the Four Great Unique Skills. As for the last three layers at the back, it is up to you whether to go or not and how to finish it.”

“As far as I know, a lot of Ancient Gods have tried to go to the tower, but only one passed through the first four layers and survived. And that person just passed the first four layers and had no guts to go to the fifth floor.” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Only one person survived?” Jian Wushuang said. “Why didn’t you say so before?”

“If I said it earlier, would you be so determined to say you are going?” King of Venomous Worms smiled. “Do not worry, I have confidence in you because you are different. You are an Inverse Cultivatior!”

“There has never been an Inverse Cultivator to go through the Star Moon Tower. I think you can make it! Just do your best. You will definitely impress everyone!”

King of Venomous Worms was obviously confident in Jian Wushuang.

“I hope.” King of Venomous Worms shrugged.

Jian Wushuang had no choice but to have a try.

…

“Someone wants to enter the Star Moon Tower!”

This news caused a heated discussion among all the Ancient Gods.

The Star Moon Tower was a nightmare to them.

After all, the journey in the tower was risky and had a high mortality rate.

For 100,000 years, the Star Moon Tower had not been opened. Ancient Gods would rather give up learning than risk their lives,

Now, the Star Moon Tower had opened once again.

Ten days later, many ancient gods had decided to watch Jian Wushuang’s journey.

In the large space in the city, an altar was suspended, and a dozen figures were sitting there, with two of them sitting in the center.

One of these two people was Gu Yi King.

The other person was also a seven-star Ancient God.

“They are Gu Yi King and Gu Mei.”

“They have both come in-person?”

“Yes. After all, the Star Moon Tower has not been opened for more than 100,000 years. It is rare to open it once. They should be present.”

There was a lot of discussion.

“So many people.” Jian Wushuang said when he felt the crowd with his soul power.

At this moment, Gu Yi King in the altar waved his hands. With a rumbling sound, an old, dark tower emerged.

This dark tower quickly zoomed and rose to a high altitude.

“This is Star Moon Tower?” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

The tower was incomparably grand and awesome.

On the altar, in addition to Gu Yi King and Go Mei, there were more than ten six-star ancient gods. At that moment, they were also talking and laughing.

“After one hundred and ten thousand years, Star Moon Tower has finally opened again.”

“Yes. After all, it is so dangerous.”

“I remember that 110,000 years ago, when the Star Moon Tower was open, a little guy called Gu Jiu went to the Star Moon Tower. He was not bad. But unfortunately he died on the third layer. I don’t know if the little guy today can be better than Gu Jiu.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Even if he’s better, in the end, he will die.”

Those six-star Ancient Gods knew well the danger of the Star Moon Tower, so they didn’t think Jian Wushuang could survive. They just hoped that he could perform better and show them some fun.

“Gu Jian, let’s get started!”

The low voice of Gu Yi King was like thunder, and suddenly it sounded throughout the heavens.

Suddenly, the entire space was immediately quiet.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath, looked up at the altar, then stepped forward to the tower.

All eyes were on Jian Wushuang.
