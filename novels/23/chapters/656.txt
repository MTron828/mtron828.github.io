Chapter 657: Three Palaces in the Ancient Sect (Part Two)

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang, Feng and Huo Ying all agreed with Xuan Yi.

They had just arrived at the Eternal World and met experts from a higher Level. Although they knew that the Divine Realm, Eternal Realm and even Dao Master were above the Skyscraping Realm, they didn’t know how to progress after that at all.

It would be much better and easier to have an expert to guide them.

Xuan Yi continued.

“Apart from the Dao Palace, the Sword Palace and the Divine Palace are also in the Ancient Sect.”

“Sword Palace, as its name, is for people to cultivate the Sword Principle.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“It is also very unique in the Ancient Sect. All the warriors who are good at longsword Dao cultivate in the Sword Palace. However, there are only one Palace Master and two Vice Palace Masters in it. The two Vice Palace Masters are Eternal Realm experts who are good at longsword Dao, and the Palace Master...” Xuan Yi smiled mysteriously and said, “I’m the Palace Master in the Sword Palace.”

On hearing that, Jian Wushuang and the other people were not surprised.

In the Firmament Territory Feast, Xuan Yi divided Shi Qianhan into two parts with his swordsmanship.

That showed how good he was at Sword Principle. Besides, he was also acknowledged as the number one Eternal Realm in the Firmament Territory, so he was the most appropriate person to be the Palace Master in the Sword Palace.

“As for the Divine Palace,” Xuan Yi hesitated for a moment and continued, “It gathered numerous Divine Realm warriors in the Ancient Sect.”

“There is a rule in our Sect. The disciples can be in the Ancient Sect for no more than five hundred years. Anyone who is here more than that, they can’t have the same treatment as our disciples, which means they can’t cultivate in the Dao Palace and the Sword Palace, and also can’t stay in the Enlightenment Mountain. The only place that they can go is the Divine Palace!”

“Inside the Divine Palace, there are lots of dangerous tasks that are assigned by the Ancient Sect and the Divine Realm experts who represent our Ancient Sect to fight to the death outside!”

“You can think about it like this. The Ancient Sect will train you for the first five hundred years, after that you need to contribute to us.”

The six people all nodded slightly.

There’s no such thing as a free lunch. Since they chose to join the Sect and use its resources, then when their strength was strong enough, they should contribute to the Sect.

“Xuan Yi Palace Master!”

A black-clothed elder popped up in the Void and bowed respectfully to Xuan Yi, then he looked at Jian Wushuang and the other people, “These should be the six geniuses that Xuan Yi Palace Master took from the Firmament Territory Feast?”

“Hum, give me the tokens,” Xuan Yi said.

The black-clothed elder immediately gave six tokens to Xuan Yi and then Xuan Yi gave one to each of the six people.

“This is your ID token. Of course, the outer disciples and the inner disciples are different,” Xuan Yi said.

Jian Wushuang and the others took it, without hesitation, they refined their own tokens.

“Dao Yun, these kids just arrived at the Ancient Sect so they are new here. I’ve explained the Enlightenment Mountain and three palaces to them, so please take them to look around the place,” Xuan Yi ordered.

“Yes.” the black-clothed elder Dao Yun nodded respectfully.

“Jian Wushuang, you stay here and the other five follow him,” Xuan Yi said.

Immediately, Feng, Huo Ying and the others left with Dao Yun, but Jian Wushuang still stood in front of Xuan Yi.

“Jian Wushuang, among these six, you are the only one who is good at longsword Dao and whose talent is the best. Follow me and I can show you the Sword Palace,” Xuan Yi said.

“Sword Palace?” Jian Wushuang was excited and instantly followed Xuan Yi.

Soon after, Jian Wushuang arrived at the Sword Palace.

It was gigantic and was like a giant island standing on the ground. There were hundreds of buildings on it. The tremendous Sword Essence also shocked Jian Wushuang a lot.

Outside the Sword Palace, there were lots of experts patrolling.

Obviously, these experts were all Divine Realm experts and they all had auras that really terrified Jian Wushuang.

In the Eternal World, the Skyscraping Realm was at the top Level, so there were thousands of Divine Realm experts here. However, the Ancient Sect which was a top Sect here, would obviously gather more Divine Realm experts.

When Xuan Yi appeared outside the Sword Palace, the Divine Realm experts who were patrolling here immediately bowed to him and called him ‘Xuan Yi Palace Master’.

“Jian Wushuang, your gift in Sword Principle is extremely high. Inside the Sword Palace, lots of Sword Principle experts record their insight, it will be very useful for you. Later, you can come here more often to meditate,” Xuan Yi said patiently.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Soon, they both stepped on a several foot wide flagstone road which headed towards the front door of the Sword Palace. On the front door, there were two grand characters – Sword Palace!

Those two characters spread powerful Sword Essence which covered the whole Sword Palace and then flew to the sky, even the numerous layers of space couldn’t stop it.

Jian Wushuang was stunned. It was the most terrifying Sword Essence that he had seen.

Jian Wushuang looked at Xuan Yi and noticed that Xuan Yi was unfathomable. He couldn’t help suspecting that these two characters were written by Xuan Yi.

Walking along the flagstone road and coming to the front of the Sword Palace, Xuan Yi stopped and looked at Jian Wushuang, “Little kid, you are so lucky today. One of our Vice Palace Masters is having a lecture now, you can go listen. I will just take you up to here.”

“Thanks, Xuan Yi Palace Master,” Jian Wushuang replied politely, then he took a deep breath and went into the Sword Palace.

Xuan Yi was still outside the front door. When he saw Jian Wushuang completely disappear, Swoosh!

A figure unexpectedly appeared beside him.

This person looked exactly the same as Xuan Yi, even the manner and temperament were completely the same. He was also very gentle. The only difference was one was in a purple robe but one was in a white robe.

The people who knew him would know that Xuan Yi had cultivated the Doppelganger Secret Skill. Obviously, the one who took part in the Firmament Territory Feast and brought Jian Wushuang and the others back to the Ancient Sect was his doppelganger.

As for the Original Body, he hadn’t gone out at all. He had been staying in the Sword Palace the whole time.

The white-robe Xuan Yi who just popped up was his Original Body.

“You really got a great little kid for me this time. The Strongest Sword Soul, haha~ ~ ~ I haven’t met this for a long time,” the white-robe Xuan Yi smiled gently and the purple-robe Xuan Yi beside him also smiled slightly.

The purple-robed Xuan Yi was only the doppelganger, so even though he observed Jian Wushuang showing his technique, he still couldn’t fully appreciate his strength.

But the white-robe Xuan Yi, as the Original Body, without seeing Jian Wushuang’s technique, only looked at him once and then already knew Jian Wushuang had the Strongest Sword Soul!
