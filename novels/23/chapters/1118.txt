Chapter 1119: Nirvana Elixir

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“A bloody myth?”

Jian Wushuang shook his head. “But that’s not what I want. All I want is to let them accept me.”

“Well, in that case, you’ve succeeded.” Gu King smiled.

Jian Wushuang looked around and found those Green Fire Palace experts all looked thoughtful.

“He’s so strong, is that really Jian Wushuang?”

“I heard that he’s only been cultivating for more than 2,000 years. He actually has increased his strength to a level like this in such a short time, incredible!”

“His father Nan (Jian Nantian) is already formidable, however, Nan has been cultivating for 100 thousand years in a Secret Land. Jian Wushuang may be lesser than his father, but just a little. But when it comes to cultivation time, his one is really short!”

Celestial Masters from Green Fire Palace were all murmuring.

They had finally been convinced of Jian Wushuang’s potentials.

Maybe, Jian Wushuang would grow someday to complete his mother’s mission, and became a real leader of Green Fire Palace!

At that time…

Buzz!

Behind the open doors of the Restriction-covered Loyalty Palace, deep purple lights shot out.

It turned out that the six lights came from six deep blue pigeon-egg-sized elixirs.

The six elixirs were emitting an inviting fragrance. Anyone that smelled them could not help be lost in the aroma.

All the people shifted their gaze on the six deep purple elixirs.

“Those elixirs…”

Most of the Celestial Masters from both parties failed to recognize the six elixirs, including those who had a profound knowledge of elixirs. They all frowned in doubt.

Inside Jian Wushuang, Gu King just smiled at the sight of them. “This will be fun.”

“Gu King, do you know what that is?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“Of course.” Gu King smirked. “Didn’t I tell you that Life Elixir is worthless in the Eternal Chaotic World and so many other elixirs exceed it?”

“What you’re looking at right now is the Nirvana Elixir that exceeds the Life Elixir!”

“Nirvana Elixir?” Jian Wushuang could not hold back his surprise.

“As the name suggested, it can help Celestial Masters take the most important step to transform themselves.” Gu King explained.

“Take the most important step? You mean they can reach the Samsara Temple Master level with it?” Jian Wushuang goggled.

“Yes, they can. But it’s not as effective as Life Elixir. Normally, the medicine will increase the success rate by three tenths.” Gu King laughed.

“Three tenths?” Jian Wushuang gasped.

To reach the level where Void Temple Master, Samsara Temple Master, and Tang Emperor at.

Green Fire World had been existence for 40 million years. In the wide battlefield, there had only been one expert who crossed that level and numerous Celestial Masters.

That most important step to a Celestial Master was like Ancient World to Eternal World. The gap was too big.

No matter in Green Fire Palace or the Jin Kingdom, even in the Eternal Chaotic World, many Celestial Masters must have been trying to break through during their entire lives.

And the Nirvana Elixir could increase the success rate by three tenths?

How great was that!

Even if it was just one-tenth possibility, Jian Wushuang thought, Celestial Masters would scramble for it.

“In the Eternal Chaotic World, Nirvana Exilir doesn’t count as something extraordinary. But in Green Fire World, it’s something precious. Even the Jin Kingdom will take it seriously. Of course, it’s of no use to you.” Gu King continued.

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly, still staring at the elixirs.

It might be of no use to him, but would be useful to Green Fire Palace!

If he could obtain all six of them, unexpectedly, Green Fire Palace would have two more Palace Masters, which would bring their battle strength to an unprecedented level.

The puzzled experts started to recognize the elixirs as well.

“Nirvana Elixir in the legend?”

The crowd gasped and finally recognized the elixirs. All of a sudden, their eyes were filled with greed.

In the eyes of most Celestial Masters, madness revealed.

They became much crazier than when they saw several hundreds of Life Elixirs.

After all, Life Elixir was only useful to Dao Masters. They actually did not benefit from it. They only did it for their camps. However, Nirvana Elixir was completely another story.

Nirvana Elixir could help them take the step they had longed for.

It was such an enticement to them.

“Get ready, eyes on the six Nirvana Elixir. When they’re thrown out, we must do everything to get them!” A black-robed woman in the Green Fire Palace camp shouted.

She was Celestial Master An of Green Fire Palace.

Green Fire Palace had sent three Celestial Masters in Exceptional Realm, one of them was Celestial Master An. Moreover, she was the strongest one of the three.

Everyone was staring at the six deep purple elixirs.

Suddenly, one of the six elixirs transformed to a streak of purple Flowing Light and charged forward.

The purple light shot through the Restriction and floated among the crowd.

Seeing the floating light, the entire battlefield got into chaos.

“Get them!”

“Fast!”

“We must get them!”

Shouts burst out in the crowd. Then, they dived into a fight scrambling for the elixirs.

Both camps had gone truly mad, fighting each other for Nirvana Elixir.

However, in a moment, the battle was over.
