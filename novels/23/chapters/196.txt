Chapter 197: A Fierce Fight

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

While the geniuses from the Cosmos Empire looked towards Jian Wushuang and his comrades, Jian Wushuang and his comrades were also staring back at them.

“It’s just a small squad from the Cosmos Empire, with four geniuses who ranked in the top 30. Among them, Gu Yan is the strongest, but our strength is enough to confront them,” said Jian Wushuang, with an icy look in his eyes.

“I will deal with Gu Yan. Zaixuan, you take one of the remaining three who ranked in top 30th,” Jian Wushuang looked at Yang Zaixuan and said.

“Ok,” Yang Zaixuan nodded, and replied coldly, “I can’t guarantee that I can defeat him, but I definitely won’t be easy to defeat.”

“Su Rou, you should have no problem dealing with one of them with your strength, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, no problem.” Su Rou nodded slightly and said, “I can definitely confine him for a while.”

“All right. Baili Chen, you shall deal with the remaining one,” Jian Wushuang looked at Baili Chen and continued.

“Ha-ha, no problem.” Baili Chen laughed and replied.

“As for the remaining three who aren’t in the top 30, they will be handled by you two, Feng Yutian and Mu Yingying. You two can do it if you work together,” Jian Wushuang continued.

“No problem,” Feng Yutian and Mu Yingying replied confidently.

“Okay then, it’s settled. Let’s do it!”

With a roar, Jian Wushuang immediately rushed forward fiercely, like a flowing light.

“The people from a small empire actually have the gall to initiate a fight with us, unbelievable!”

“Ha-ha, then we shall kill them.”

“Jian Wushuang is my?prey. You guys deal with the rest,” Gu Yan shouted.

Soon after, the warriors from the two squads engaged in a fierce fight.

Jian Wushuang led the charge, wasting no time before starting the fight with Gu Yan. Yang Zaixuan and the others moved toward their enemies as well.

Shua!

A sword light suddenly appeared, cutting through the air as it flew forward at a fast pace.

Jian Wushuang used his full strength with this first move. The second movement of the Selfless Sword Technique, Solipsistic Form.

As soon as he rushed forward, his power radiated out and filled the area. It was a monstrous power that even caused the air to vibrate.

By then, Gu Yan was holding the giant axe that had been on his back. He immediately waved the giant axe, causing an overlapping axe shadow to appear.

“Separate the Sky from the Earth!” Gu Yan roared, and then he violently slashed the giant axe towards Jian Wushuang’s sword light.

The slash was so powerful that it seemed like it could cut through mountains.

Bang!

The two forces violently collided together, releasing two terrifying bursts of power. Several blast waves immediately formed and swept over the area.

Facing this surge of power, the upper portions of the surrounding trees were shattered.

At this point, Jian Wushuang also felt a vast force that he couldn’t resist, forcing him to retreat several steps.

“I already tried my used my full strength with the Solipsistic Form, why can’t I beat him?” Jian Wushuang muttered in surprise.

“Thunderbolt. Yes, his giant axe contains Thunderbolt Essence!”

“He should have comprehended both Thunderbolt and Raging Fire Essences simultaneously. The combined essences made his power extremely violent and terrifying,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Thunderbolt essence was fierce and violent.

Same was Raging Fire essence.

With these two essences combined, how could Gu Yan’s attack not be violent.

“He is even stronger than Xue Yun.”?Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

Having experienced the first round, Jian Wushuang already had an idea how strong Gu Yan was.

Gu Yan combined two essences, one regular essence and one irregular essence, the same as Xue Yun. But the difference was that Xue Yun had only reached the Exceptional Gold Core Realm, while Gu Yan was at the Half Step Yin-Yang Realm.

So Gu Yan was naturally more powerful than Xue Yun in overall strength.

Luckily, Jian Wushuang had greatly improved his strength in the past two months, so he was not really scared.

“I’m not his match if I fight with brute strength, so I’ll entangle him using speed and flexibility.”

Having thought of this, Jian Wushuang instantly disappeared like a ghost and landed next to Gu Yan. Then he waved his Triple-kill Swords and quietly slashed towards Gu Yan.

Gu Yan flipped his hand and easily parried Jian Wushuang’s slash. However, Jian Wushuang gripped his longsword and disappeared again, reappearing on the other side of Gu Yan... Jian Wushuang fiercely waved his sword, releasing a continuous string of wild attacks against Gu Yan.

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!

In a single moment, Jian Wushuang had already attacked ten times in succession, without giving Gu Yan a chance to breathe. Every slash was extremely tricky, so Gu Yan had to shift his Giant Axe to ward off the sword shadows.

“This fellow is flexible.”?Gu Yan darkened his face.

Gu Yan specialized in strength and head-to-head battles. However, Jian Wushuang was fighting him with speed and flexibility. He couldn’t do anything about it.

In the short fight so far, he did not have an advantage. Instead, he was constantly defending. How could he beat or even kill Jian Wushuang?

Gu Yan immediately realized he was unable to overcome Jian Wushuang alone. Thinking of this, he involuntary looked around. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Only one glance was enough to make him even more depressed.

The situation of the other fights was also the same.

Both Yang Zaixuan and Baili Chen were fighting with a genius from the Cosmos Empire who ranked in the top 30, and neither one was in a passive position.

Su Rou’s opponent was a lady, who ranked 21st. However, Su Rou’s movements were extremely tricky, and her body was soft like cotton. No matter how the lady attacked, she was easily warded off by Su Rou.

Every time the lady tried to stop fighting Su Rou and attack the others, Su Rou immediately interfered. Although Su Rou’s attack was not formidable, it was strong enough to prevent the lady from supporting her comrades.

Feng Yutian and Mu Yingying were in the same situation. They were working together, fighting against three warriors from the Cosmos Empire. It was an evenly matched fight as well.

Looking at the whole situation, it seemed the geniuses in both Empires were well-matched.

Seeing this, Gu Yan lightly sighed, and then he waved his hand, “Retreat!”

Then the other geniuses in the Cosmos Empire retreated without hesitation. Without wasting time, they quickly left together with Gu Yan.

Jian Wushuang and his comrades were still standing on the battlefield. Seeing the geniuses from the Cosmos Empire retreat, they all felt relieved. Soon after, they all threw a smile on their faces.

“They retreated.”

“We defeated a squad from the Cosmos Empire!”

“Ha-ha, even a squad from the Cosmos Empire couldn’t defeat us.”

Baili Chen and Feng Yutian were excited.

“Don’t be careless,” Jian Wushuang shook his head and said, “It was just one of the squads from the Cosmos Empire. It should have been the weaker one, so the other one should be stronger. Ling Xueyu, who was 2nd place in the Rankings, is a member of The Cosmos Empire. However, we did not see him just now, so he should be in the other squad.”

Hearing what Jian Wushuang said, the five next to him agreed and nodded.

They indeed defeated a squad from the Cosmos Empire, but it was not a big deal.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang suddenly looked at Yang Zaixuan in surprise.

Su Rou, Baili Chen, Mu Yingying and Feng Yutian looked towards Yang Zaixuan as well.

Looking at the state of Yang Zaixuan, everybody had a strange look on their face.
