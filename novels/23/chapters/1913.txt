Chapter 1914: Massacre!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

There were loud bangs continuously as four Hong Jun Golden Swords flew out. Jian Wushuang’s close combat skill could explode entirely.

Palace Master Wu Luo couldn’t fight evenly. He had been suppressed since the beginning of the fierce fight.

Such suppression continued for a while, the Sword Principle that Jian Wushuang had performed hit Palace Master Wu Luo thrice.

Although Palace Master Wu Luo’s defense power was strong, his body was majorly affected from a direct hit.

“Irresistible. I couldn’t resist Jian Wushuang at all!”

“I will definitely die if this continues!”

Palace Master Wu Luo was anxious.

At the same time, he noticed his surrounding battlefield.

On the battlefield, Star Extermination Alliance was already at the brink of collapse.

Under the besiegement of Lineage of Star’s experts and Dao soldiers in collaboration with the galaxy formation, there were more than twenty deaths from the original almost seventy Almighties.

On the contrary, the experts and Dao soldiers that Lineage of Star had lost were rather few.

The difference in the power of both parties were getting bigger.

The experts in Star Extermination Alliance were panicking.

“Hurry up and figure out a way. Otherwise, we will be doomed!”

“Run, hurry up and run!”

“There’s no use trying to run. We are in the galaxy, the trap that Lineage of Star purposely set up. They intentionally let us barge in. If I’m not mistaken, the entrance that we came in from is entirely sealed and we can’t escape.”

There were panic-stricken voices spreading all across the battlefield.

The experts in Star Extermination Alliance’s eyes were bloodshot.

They weren’t stupid. The situation in front of them was clear.

Star Extermination Alliance was already defeated. They were crushed.

They had even lost the power to counter attack. They would only be massacred by Lineage of Star if they continued to stand.

At such a crucial moment, they were also trying to figure out a countermeasure. Very soon, they realized that they had no way at all.

It was a trap that Lineage of Star set up. As it was a trap, its exit was definitely sealed off.

They couldn’t escape.

The only possibility was for someone to help.

For instance, the other two alliances that harbored wicked intentions towards Lineage of Star.

“D*mn it. The space was sealed and our message couldn’t be sent out. It is impossible for us to contact the other two alliances. The other two alliances have definitely gathered outside the galaxy, but they didn’t know what has happened inside.”

“What to do? What should we do?”

“The two alliances definitely would take action against Lineage of Star. They are only waiting for an opportunity. They wanted to wait until Lineage of Star was almost taken over by us Star Extermination Alliance, only then will they take action.?But we here only could hope for the two alliances to come into the galaxy formation soon.”

“Yes, if only!”

“Hold on. Try to hold on until the other two alliances barge in. By then, our danger will be resolved. At the same time, Lineage of Star could be routed!!!”

On the battlefield, there was a hubbub.

The expert in Star Extermination Alliance already viewed the other two alliances as their life savior.

They were trying their best to drag on longer to allow for the two alliances to barge in.

Of course, the progress was extremely torturous. There was a large number of experts that were killed by Lineage of Star.

The number of Almighties from Star Extermination Alliance was diminishing at a shocking speed.

Originally, there were almost seventy Almighties. But then, there was already only fifty left and it continued to decrease.

Less than forty…

Less than thirty…

It continued to decrease.

On the other side, they were outside the galaxy formation, the two alliances who were viewed as life saviors had already gathered there.

Supreme Ten Alliance, many Emperor Gods gathered.

The two strongest fighting power of Supreme Ten Alliance, also one of the Peak Emperor God, Emperor Sword Sect Master said, “Star Extermination Alliance has been in the galaxy for quite a while. If I’m not mistaken, the experts in Lineage of Star should be almost gone.”

“Mm, although Lineage of Star was powerful, compared to Star Extermination Alliance, they were far weaker. As long as the formation is broken, they have no power to counterattack. At most, they are fighting back like a cornered beast. They shouldn’t be able to last long,” Another Peak Emperor God, Emperor God Wu Yao said.

“If so, what are we waiting for? Hurry up and attack!”

The surrounding Emperor Gods were all raging in anger. There was soaring hatred in their eyes.

Among the three alliances, Star Extermination Alliance and Supreme Ten Alliance harbored great resentment against Lineage of Star.

Many harbored deep-seated resentment. They would stop at nothing.

Although to let Star Extermination Alliance destroy Lineage of Star and just share a portion from it was a good option, their deep-seated resentment made them want to take action personally.

“As no one can wait anymore, let’s depart.”

The Emperor Sword Sect looked at everyone and commanded. Immediately, the entire Supreme Ten Alliance were a total of over ten Almighties. They approached the Universe Galaxy together.

Very soon, the experts of Supreme Ten Alliance had gathered at a corner near the galaxy. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“The people in Star Extermination Alliance entered from here?” The Master of Emperor Sword Sect Master looked at everyone.

“Yes, I saw it with my own eyes. The experts from Star Extermination Alliance broke a hole here. Now, the hole has recovered,” A Real God from Emperor Sword Sect reported.

“Humph. So what if it recovered? As Star Extermination Alliance could break the formation, Supreme Ten Alliance can do the same,” the Master of Emperor Sword Sect smiled.

The experts from Supreme Ten Alliance took action.

There were continuous attacks that hit the weakest point of the galaxy one after another. Suddenly, the entire galaxy was shaking vigorously.

In the depths of Universe Galaxy.

Hall Master Yuan had been hiding there and had constantly created an advantageous situation for experts from Lineage of Star with the galaxy formation.

But suddenly… Hong! The entire galaxy suddenly shook.

“Mm?” Hall Master Yuan’s face changed, “We finally can’t hold back anymore?”

“Luckily, it’s only Supreme Ten Alliance.”

Hall Master Yuan immediately send a message to Jian Wushuang, who was suppressing Palace Master Wu Luo and had already injured him on the battlefield.

“Palace Master, Supreme Ten Alliance took action. They are attacking the formation,’ Hall Master Yuan’s voice was cold.

“Only Supreme Ten Alliance alone? How about Almighties Alliance?” Jian Wushuang immediately asked.

The galaxy was fully controlled by Hall Master Yuan. The experts from Star Extermination Alliance couldn’t communicate on the battlefield but Jian Wushuang could.

“Almighties Alliance has yet to take action,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Very well. Star Extermination Alliance is almost done. As Supreme Ten Alliance is courting death, I shall take care of them all together!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold.

“Let Supreme Ten Alliance in!”
