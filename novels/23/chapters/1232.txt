Chapter 1233: Big Move (Part Two)

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Crazy!

Xuan Yi’s move was crazy in the eyes of many!

However, no one could stop his craziness.

The four black giants firmly grasped the most important four parts of the Formation. The huge hands moved, and the immense Formation actually moved upward gradually.

“Impossible!”

Jiu Xi screamed.

She could not believe her eyes.

An Eternal Realm actually drove this Enduring Samsara Formation that had evolved for a year.

One must know that not even the Jin Kingdom monarch was able to move this large Formation with all his strength.

“This, this…” Jiu Xi stuttered and could not utter a complete sentence.

The four giants pulled the whole Enduring Samsara Formation slowly upward Although it was slow like a snail, it was indeed moving. At this speed, they could pull the Formation into the World Scroll in at most half of a day.

“Master wants to pull the Enduring Samsara Formation into the Mountain River Map and refine it?” Jian Wushuang frowned. “While the Mountain River Map is a Chaos Divine Treasure, but it is still hard for it to contain the Enduring Samsara Formation, right?”

“No, no!” At this time, Gu King spoke again, and he sounded even more terrified. “Wrong, we guessed wrong.”

“Wrong?” Jian Wushuang was in doubt.

“When I saw him pulling the Formation, I thought that he wanted to use the Mountain River Map to refine it to stop this crisis. But I never expected that your master had such a big move!” Gu King was very excited.

“He is not refining the Formation! Not from the beginning!”

“He… is refining weapons!”

“Refining weapons?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

They only wanted to destroy the Formation, how did he start to refine weapons?

“Jian Wushuang, your Mountain River Map is indeed a Chaos Divine Treasure. However, it’s a damaged Chaos Divine Treasure, you know that, right?” Gu King said.

“Yes, indeed.” Jian Wushuang immediately nodded, but at the next moment he just trembled, “Is it…”

Jian Wushuang had already thought of a possibility, but this possibility left him in an unprecedented shock.

“Yes, your master is trying to use the Formation to fix the Mountain River Map. He’s refining weapons, he is repairing the Mountain River Map!” Gu King said in a low voice.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was shocked. He was completely at a loss.

The numerous Green Fire World experts, including Palace Master Yun, all failed to touch the Formation!

But his master not only wanted to destroy but also use this Enduring Samsara Formation to repair the damaged Chaos Divine Treasure. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

It was a skill that would startle the universe!

In both the Green Fire World and the Eternal Chaotic World, the skill was incredible!

“Monster!”

“Jian Wushuang, your master is a complete monster, and he must come from the Eternal Chaotic World!”

“If he’s born in the Green Fire World, no matter how talented he is, he will never require such refining and Formation knowledge. Even the founder of Star Bloodline and the Formation master King Luo Zhen can’t do this!”

“Your master is definitely a real refining master and a Formation powerhouse!”

Gu King was roaring wildly.

“Refining master? Formation powerhouse?” Jian Wushuang widened his eyes.

Master?

In the Eternal Chaotic World, only the founder of the Star Bloodline, and the Eight-star Ancient God King Luo Zhen were qualified to be called masters.

Had his master really reached that level in terms of refining and Formation?

“However, although your master possesses great skills, he is indeed only an Eternal Realm. If his power is only in Eternal Realm, how could he manage to release a skill like that with his weak body?” Gu King added.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed. He also thought of this and looked in the direction of Xuan Yi.

Then, Jian Wushuang’s countenance changed greatly.

Xuan Yi’s aura and his vitality were rapidly decreasing. He was losing his energy at an alarming rate.

“Master!” Jian Wushuang immediately exclaimed.

“I guessed right.” Gu King nodded heavily. “He not only used his Spiritual Power, but also his vitality. He let out all his strength to release the skill. When he succeeds, he will decrease!”

“Decease?” Jian Wushuang was awestruck.

At this time, Xuan Yi seemed to notice Jian Wushuang’s gaze. He was still pulling the Enduring Samsara Formation. He turned his head slightly and looked at Jian Wushuang. He looked still calm and smiled affectionately.

At the same time, his gentle voice rang. “My disciple, I will soon disappear, and before that, I will finally give you another Creation!”

“Master…” Jian Wushuang wanted to say something.

Xuan Yi lifted his hand to stop him and said seriously, “Don’t, hurry up and do what I say.”

“Yes!” Jian Wushuang clasped his hands. Although he was grief-stricken, he suppressed his emotions hard.

He knew very clearly that it was not the right time to be emotional.

Xuan Yi broke the Formation at all costs and paved the way for him. He could only inherit the Creation-Level skill and reached the level his master expected to pay him back!

“My disciple, I had kept your ownership for this!” Xuan Yi’s voice was solemn.

“You still control the Mountain River Map, and through the map, you should be able to sense the essence of the Enduring Samsara Formation. The essence is a huge Creation for you!”

“Learn it thoroughly!”

“This is an opportunity I created for you and the Green Fire World. You must cherish it!”

“The Green Fire World’s survival depends on you!”
