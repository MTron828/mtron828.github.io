Colorful Balloons Take Flight

Abysmal Saint Master was still fearful of the mysterious expert Emperor Thirteen.

At least, before he was confident enough to deal with Emperor Thirteen, he absolutely wouldn’t dare to kill Jian Wushuang.

However, he thought that as long as he didn’t try to kill Jian Wushuang, Emperor Thirteen wouldn’t surface.

“Let’s not waste time with him. Seize the time and suppress him directly. Let’s talk after we conquer Green Fire World,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze said.

“Mm,” Abysmal Saint Master and Great Emperor Zi Xu nodded simultaneously.

The aura of the three Great Emperor experts immediately spread around.

Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s chilliness soared and froze the surrounding void.

Abysmal Saint Master was as dark as usual, boundless darkness without any light.

Great Emperor Zi Xu was purely imaginary. He made people feel that he was like a cloud that was floating in the air.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

The three of them took action at the same time.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes dilated in shock. Then, he took out a token.

The token belonged to Emperor Bai.

“Mister Emperor Bai...”

Jian Wushuang sent a message at his fastest possible speed.

As for how long it would take until Emperor Bai reply his message, Jian Wushuang had no idea either. However, he had to block everyone outside of Green Fire World before that.

It naturally included the three Great Emperors in front of him.

“Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zi Xu and Great Emperor Colored Glaze were in the third, fifth and sixth place respectively. They were all powerful Great Emperors.

“Theoretically, their strengths are just like their ranking indicated. However, Abysmal Saint Master was severely injured by Emperor Thirteen and he has yet to recover fully. Hence, among the three, he was the weakest while Great Emperor Zi Xu was the strongest,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself. Then, he made up his mind.

He flipped his hand and Five Fire Godly Spirit Mirrors appeared. He let the divine power flow into the five tall godly spirits in the universe.

The moment the five godly spirits appeared, the surrounding void immediately became cold.

“Jian Yi, you are best at manipulation of power of spacetime. You keep Great Emperor Zi Xu occupied. Five godly spirits, hold Great Emperor Colored Glaze back. As for Abysmal Saint Master, I’ll take care of him!”

After Jian Wushuang commanded, Jian Yi and the five godly spirits took action.

Jian Wushuang also drew his Blood Mountain Sword at the first instance and there was sword intention billowing. At the same time, he revealed eight heads and sixteen arms. He immediately charged at Abysmal Saint Master.

Both parties immediately collided directly.

Great Emperor Zi Xu was the strongest at the scene and he was very skillful. His figure was vague and insubstantial. However, Jian Yi, who was in charge, dealt with him and could manipulate power of spacetime far better than everyone else. Although he was weaker, he definitely wouldn’t be defeated in a short time.

The Five Fire Formation formed by the five godly spirits was powerful. Great Emperor Colored Glaze already experienced it before. She wanted to break the Five Fire Formation but it was difficult for her as well.

The only battle that had an extremely big disparity would be the battle between Abysmal Saint Master and Jian Wushuang.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang was raging with anger. He appeared before Abysmal Saint Master and wielded a sword each with his eighteen arms.

Every stroke of sword light contained boundless power of reincarnation at a terrifyingly fast speed.

Most importantly, it collaborated with his own divine power and the power of ancient tribe bloodline. Then, it exploded with billowing power.

However, Abysmal Saint Master didn’t care about such an attack.

“Such a joke!”

Abysmal Saint Master sneered and casually pointed. Then, boundless darkness flowed out and instantly formed a black hand that grasped the void in front at lightning speed.

Jian Wushuang slashed out with many sword lights but the dark hand broke them apart.

“Jian Wushuang, you are only a Real God. No matter how powerful you are, you could only have the fighting power of a Peak Emperor God at most. How dare you fight against me? Who gave you such courage?” Abysmal Saint Master looked at Jian Wushuang in disdain as he spat his scornful remark.

“Humph!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Jian Wushuang humphed coldly as he retreated.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were five continuous resplendent golden lights which appeared next to Abysmal Saint Master.

The five golden lights were extremely fast.

Abysmal Saint Master raised his eyebrows and a dark protective barrier substantiated.

The five golden lights hit the dark protective barrier and it shattered into pieces after four loud thuds. Then, the final golden light aimed at Abysmal Saint Master’s head without hindrance.

Abysmal Saint Master looked surprised, but his figure turned illusionary and he dodged the golden light easily.

Abysmal Saint Master regained stability in the void and couldn’t help but look at the five golden lights.

“Is this your infamous golden sword? You only had four previously but now you have five. Plus, they look like they have become much stronger. It seems that you have improved greatly, huh?” Abysmal Saint Master looked at him with a cold gaze.

It was true. It had been a total of twelve thousand years since the war in Lineage of Star.

To the ordinary Almighties, the timespan was naturally nothing. However, to Jian Wushuang, his power was of course different.

During the twelve thousand years, his comprehension towards doctrine had heightened massively.

His comprehension of Spacetime Doctrine and Extermination Doctrine had reached the extreme limit of the eighth level. He was only one step away from the ninth level and his soul power became much stronger too. As a result, his control of Hong Jun Golden Sword had grown too. Not only could he drive the fifth Hong Jun Golden Sword but his Hong Jun Golden Sword power increased tremendously.

Previously, one of his Hong Jun Golden Sword equaled the power of an attack of a Peak Emperor God. Now, the power of his Hong Jun Golden Sword was equivalent to a Peak Emperor God’s full hit with unique skill or secret skill!

With the collaboration of five swords, they were of course fierce.

“I really belittled you. With five Hong Jun Golden Swords, you should be able to be on par with an Underworld God. However, you are still nothing in front of him,” Abysmal Saint Master smiled coldly.

Rumble. A huge dark whirlpool appeared behind Jian Wushuang.

The dark whirlpool was unfathomable and contained boundless extermination power. At the very moment it appeared, Jian Wushuang’s body was pulled and dragged greatly as though he was going to be swallowed by the dark whirlpool. In the middle of the dark whirlpool, Abysmal Saint Master stepped on a dark demon dragon as they plunged out.

“Roar!”

The demon dragon let out a roar and its roar shook the sky.

Layers of dark ripples spread in the air as Abysmal Saint Master waved.
