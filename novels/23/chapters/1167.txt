Chapter 1168: I Am Her Master

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Queen Lanyue’s teeth were gritted, and her body was shaking. Watching the giant hand approaching her, she desperately wanted to resist.

But she found herself unable to move.

“Is this the end?” Queen Lanyue muttered, showing a desperate look.

Suddenly… the rushing huge palm disappeared.

Without a sign, it vanished into the Void.

The overwhelming power contained in the palm disappeared without a trace.

“This is…?” She looked dumbfounded.

Everyone present appeared baffled.

On the other hand, all color had left the face of the owner of the huge palm, Kong Ming.

“Who is it!! ”

Kong Ming retorted and his voice echoed throughout the Heavens and Earth, lingering for a long time.

At that time, in the distant sky, a scarlet-robed figure appeared and was slowly approaching Kong Ming.

Although he was slow, he had walked a long way with merely two steps, arriving at the center of the battlefield.

The figure stopped. It was a figure of a young man who was carrying a long sword. As he waved his sleeves, the whole world went completely quiet.

Seeing the person, Kong Ming squinted and cast a cold look.

Queen Lanyue stared at the person in disbelief.

“Who are you?” asked Kong Ming in a low voice.

“Me?” Jian Wushuang was smiling faintly. “Didn’t you just mention me?”

“Mentioned you?” Kong Ming paused thoughtfully before he realized. “You are Queen Lanyue’s master?”

“Yes, I am her master. As for the name, it’s Jian Wushuang. I wonder if you have heard of it.” Jian Wushuang remained calm.

“A junior who just has lived for more than two thousand years. How will I know you?” Kong Ming snorted, full of disdain in his heart.

When Jian Wushuang quietly undid his attack, he thought that he might be very strong and perhaps reached Eternal Realm. When he knew who Jian Wushuang was, he did not bother to pay attention to him.

“He’s only been in the Eternal World for two thousand years. In such a short time, even if he’s somewhat talented, what level can he reach? A Divine Realm expert is the best he can be.” Kong Ming thought to himself.

He was an Eternal Realm and was among the best ones. In the whole wide world, only few top Dao Masters were worthy of his attention. It was not every day you got to see a Dao Master.

Being in the Eternal World for two thousand years, how could he become a Dao Master?

How could he be?

Naturally, Kong Ming did not pay close attention to Jian Wushuang.

“This Ancient World belongs to the Firmament Territory, where I’m famous. Every Eternal Realm should know my name by now. However, if Kong Ming doesn’t know me, that means he didn’t come from the Firmament Territory.” Jian Wushuang folded his hands behind his back with a rather strange look.

After he came to the Ancient World, he had deliberately concealed his own aura to stay under Kong Ming’s radar.

And looking at the current situation, Kong Ming really did not take him seriously.

“Jian Wushuang, I want your disciple as my maid and take her to the Eternal World, you’re fine with that, aren’t you?” Kong Ming put on airs, looked at Jian Wushuang, and laid all his Eternal Realm aura onto Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang did not know whether to cry or to laugh.

An Eternal Realm tried to lay pressure on him by his aura?

“There are a lot of people who are ignorant under the sun. You are one of them.”?Jian Wushuang smiled and spoke. “You want to take my disciple to the ancient world? I certainly have no problems with that, but I have one condition.”

“What condition?” Kong Ming thought that Jian Wushuang had been completely overwhelmed by his Eternal Realm aura.

“You have to return to the Eternal World.” Jian Wushuang teased.

Kong Ming looked stunned, “You are playing with fire, kid!”

As he finished, Kong Ming stretched to tap at Jian Wushuang from a distance.

The stroke shattered the fragile Void in this Ancient World. The whole world seemed to be torn into pieces.

It was a scene that could shake the world.

The scene struck fear into the hearts of Warriors from both Wushuang Sword Pavilion and Spirit Palace.

“God!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“This is the power that God has!”

“Does God really want to destroy our Wushuang Sword Pavilion?”

The Wushaung Sword Pavilion Warriors growled.

Queen Lanyue was panicked and worried.

Kong Ming was full of killing intents. Although he was seriously injured, and could not play one percent of his strength. However, even if one percent of his power was enough to kill a normal Divine Realm expert.

Abruptly, buzz… A breeze passed; the collapsed and ruined world quickly recovered. Kong Ming’s stroke quietly dissipated without a trace.

“What?” Kong Ming was stunned.

Jian Wushuang glanced up coldly.

Jian Wushuang’s cold eyes left Kong Ming awestruck. He was frozen on the spot; his hairs stood up at once.

“I, I…” Kong Ming opened his mouth, but could not say a word.

Unprecedented fear snatched his heart. Only at this moment had he finally known who was standing in front of him.

“Dao Master? Is he a Dao Master?” Kong Ming’s eyes widened.

“Die.”

Jian Wushuang blew a breath, and a Sword Essence formed. Though seemingly small, it left Kong Ming in great terror. He snarled. “Don’t you dare! My master is Dao Master Blood Tusk. I am Dao Master Blood Tusk’s disciple!”

“Oh?” Jian Wushaung cocked an eyebrow, and the immaterial Sword Essence that was rushed toward Kong Ming stopped in the Void.

Kong Ming swallowed, and looked at the immaterial Sword Essence in terror, then immediately he crushed a token.

As soon as the token was broken, there was a spectral image that was completely formed by consciousness appeared in the world.

This consciousness spectral image formed the appearance of a red-haired elder, who sounded kind of evil.

“I wonder which Dao Master wants to kill my disciple.” Dao Master Blood Tusk wants to meet him!”
