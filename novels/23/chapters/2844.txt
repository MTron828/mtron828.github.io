Chapter 2845: Four Sided Vibration

——

What appeared in Jian Wushuang’s palm was the most complete blood essence that his perfect chaotic creature possessed!

Because he had come to look for Lord Mo in order to merge his blood essence into the blood mountain sword, he had prepared his blood essence.

This drop of blood essence was completely different from the one he had taken out in order to see Lord Mo...

Lord Mo had been using the Holy Heavenly Furnace for nine days and nine nights, so he was mentally exhausted, but his consciousness was very clear.

He had also been staring at Jian Wushuang, wondering what level of blood essence Jian Wushuang had prepared for the most perfect magic weapon.

Could it be the blood essence of a special life?

Lord Mo was indeed a little curious.

So when Jian Wushuang took out the blood essence, he immediately looked over.

But when he saw the blood essence in Jian Wushuang’s hand, Lord Mo was stunned.

“That drop of blood essence...” Lord Mo’s eyes were like two lanterns, staring at the drop of blood essence in Jian Wushuang’s palm.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Even from a certain distance, he could still feel how pure and powerful the drop of blood essence was.

“How, how is it possible?”

“It’s dozens of times purer than the drop of blood essence of the special life I received before, or even hundreds of times purer?”

“This, this...”

Lord Mo was completely stunned, or rather, completely stunned.

He had met Jian Wushuang because of the drop of blood essence that Jian Wushuang had brought.

He was sure that the drop of blood essence was from a special life form. It was much purer than the blood essence of many bloodline races in the divine beginning world.

That was what he had always dreamed of.

But now he found that the drop of blood essence that he had dreamed of was like the sky and the Earth compared to the drop that Jian Wushuang had brought out!

It was too pure!

Lord Mo had never thought that there was such pure essence blood between heaven and earth.

“The previous drop was the essence blood of a special life, and it should be very strong among special life forms. This drop of essence blood seems to be a hundred times purer than that one. What level is this essence blood?” Lord Mo was stunned.

At this time, Jian Wushuang had already waved his hand, and this drop of pure and perfect essence blood was immediately thrown toward the Holy Heavenly Furnace.

When the essence blood fell into the Holy Heavenly Furnace, it was quite calm at first.

But this calm only lasted for a moment.

Buzz!

A loud and clear sword cry suddenly sounded.

The sword cry was extremely ear-piercing. It went along the passage of the volcano above and instantly shot to the nine heavens, resounding throughout the entire sky.

The entire world was stunned by this ear-piercing sword chime.

In the next moment, a sword intent suddenly erupted from the Holy Heavenly Furnace.

This sword’s intent was not that majestic or that powerful. However, the level of this sword intent, or more accurately, the will contained within the sword intent, was enough to shock the heavens.

It was a supreme sword intent that looked down on the world and looked down on all living beings as ants.

It represented the peak of Sword Dao, the pinnacle of Sword Dao, and also the pinnacle of Sword Dao!

Supreme!

...

Buzz!

The supreme sword intent shot into the sky and spread out unscrupulously.

The area is spread out was extremely wide.

The Dragon-phoenix Sacred City had always been under the control of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

At this moment, in the deepest part of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s nest, in an ancient secret room.

An old man dressed in a yellow Daoist robe was sitting cross-legged on a praying mat. His eyes were closed as he meditated quietly.

However, when that supreme sword intent swept out without restraint, the old man instantly sensed it even though he was hundreds of millions of kilometers away.

Immediately, the old man’s eyes suddenly opened, revealing a pair of deep eyes that pierced through the secret chamber and looked into the distance.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Two figures appeared in the secret chamber almost immediately.

The auras of these two people were ethereal, but they were far superior to Divine Masters. They were clearly two true undying saints.

However, these two undying saints were clearly in awe of the aged old man sitting on the futon.

“What’s happening in that direction?” The aged old man asked faintly.

“That direction should be where the Fire Cloud Castle is. I received news a few days ago that old man Mo has already started to refine treasures. This time, he even used the sacred heavenly furnace to refine them. From the looks of it, he should have refined an extraordinary treasure,” a woman in green said.

“It seems so. However, the Fire Cloud Castle is extremely far away from our Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. The treasure that old man mo refined over there actually has a great deterrent effect on us, who are hundreds of millions of miles away. What exactly did he refine?” The old man narrowed his eyes slightly, “Immediately get someone to investigate carefully and find out what he refined. Also... Elder Qin, you have to make a trip there yourself.”

“Alright.” The green-robed woman nodded slightly. With a flash of her figure, she disappeared from the secret chamber.

...

This was a nameless mountain peak in Dragon-phoenix Sacred City. A handsome and cold man was standing on the peak.

This cold and handsome man looked very young, but his silver-white hair almost reached his waist. His figure was also ethereal, and his aura seemed to be indistinct. However, his eyes were bright and full of spirit, as if they were exploding.

At this moment, this cold and handsome man with silver-white hair looked directly into the distant void.

“Sword intent, what a sword intent!”

“This sword intent must have come from a place billions of miles away, an extremely distant place. It’s clearly not too powerful, but the will contained in the sword intent actually made me want to submit.”

“With such a terrifying sword intent, could it be that a true treasure has been born in that place?”

The silver-haired man muttered to himself, and his voice was also illusory.

“Supreme treasure? Master, where did you say a supreme treasure was born?”

Next to the handsome man was a teenager who looked to be only fifteen or sixteen years old. This teenager carried a long sword on his back and held one in his hand. When he heard the former’s words, he immediately became excited.

“Shut up!”

The handsome man berated, “That sword intent is supreme. It has a certain effect on you right now. Calm down and carefully sense it. With your current sword Dao cultivation, it’s very difficult for you to sense the existence of that sword intent. However, as long as you sense even a little bit of it, your sword dao cultivation will be able to increase by a lot.”

“Can you improve your swordsmanship cultivation?” The fifteen-year-old stared at him, his interest immediately piqued.

Then, he sat cross-legged next to him and began to meditate and experience it.
