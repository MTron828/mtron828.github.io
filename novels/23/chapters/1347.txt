Chapter 1348: Duan Lingfeng’s Choice

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Sky-devouring Clan… It’s one of the top clans in Eternal Chaotic World. They feed on exotic beasts’ blood. They are overbearing with almost no natural enemy!”

“Plus, a pure Sky-devouring Clan is born with natural senses towards certain blood lineages. I reckon the Sky Devourer before you could sense your Ancient God blood flowing in you. That’s why he rushed over.”

“The Royal Ancient God blood is extremely attractive for the Sky-devouring Clan. Hence, he wants to kill you now and consume your Ancient God blood!” King of Venomous Worms said in a serious voice.

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and he saw madness and greed in the eyes of the man in black robe.

On the spaceship, Yu Shan saw that the man in the black robe didn’t respond for so long, he bellowed, “Mister, if you do not move aside, please do not blame me for not being polite.”

“Impolite? Hehe. I’d like to see how impolite you can be.”

The man in the black robe laughed maliciously. At the same time, there was a terrifying power erupting from his body. The strong aura exceeded the scope of an ordinary Universe God in the Third Heaven. It was almost at the level of a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven.

“Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven?”

Every cultivator on the spaceship gasped simultaneously.

Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave.

In the ranking of Universe Gods, every level makes a huge difference. An ordinary Universe God in the Third Heaven and a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven was two entirely different concepts.

Plus, the man in the black robe before him was a member of the Sky-devouring Clan. With the power of his blood lineage, he was definitely a scary one among Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven.

Jian Wushuang reckoned that the man in black robe was much scarier compared to the Universe God in the Third Heaven from Snow Dojo, Chen Feng. Although there was some difference, it wouldn’t be too far off.

Such an expert, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t be able to deal with in his current state.

Even though they were in this troop, even though there was an expert like Duan Lingfeng, they might not be able to win against an expert at such level.

“Hehe, human cultivator,” the man in the black robe smiled maliciously and his voice spread, “I am only interested in one of you. Hand over that person to me and the rest of you can leave.”

“He only wants one person?”

“He’s not interested in us?”

“Would one of us be his enemy? He chased us all the way here?”

It stirred a commotion on the spaceship.

Yu Shan took a deep breath and asked, “I wonder who you are looking for?”

“It’s him,” the man in black robe pointed from afar.

Everyone looked at the direction the man in black robe was pointing at and saw Jian Wushuang.

“It’s Jian Wushuang!”

“It’s him?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“The Universe God in the Third Heaven came for him!”

The Universe Gods looked at Jian Wushuang under a different light.

“Brother Wushuang,” Luo Hai and Luo Yu looked worried.

As the leader of the troop, Yu Shan looked at Jian Wushuang for a very long time until he said in a cold voice, “Jian Wushuang, I’m sorry, please leave the spaceship.”

Everyone’s gaze turned cold.

At such a crucial moment, everyone seemed to have made a decision.

Give him Jian Wushuang!

“Fickleness of human nature,” Jian Wushuang saw and laughed at himself but wasn’t surprised.

In the Eternal Chaotic World, it was extremely cruel and cold.

Previously, when Jian Wushuang revealed his decent fighting power, the troop of Universe Gods accepted him delightedly.

However, when a strong enemy came and made clear that he wanted Jian Wushuang, the Universe Gods gave him up without hesitation in order to protect themselves.

After all, they didn’t build any relationship with Jian Wushuang. They were merely a troop that was temporarily formed in order to pass through Ancient Star Sea.

It was only normal that the Universe Gods wasn’t willing to risk their lives to save Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang didn’t bother to blame them.

Then, Jian Wushuang slowly walked towards the exit of the spaceship.

Just as he walked, he quickly communicated with the King of Venomous Worms, “King of Venomous Worms, you told me previously that there were many kinds in Sky-devouring Clan. Patriarch of Empyrean Glory who I met back then was a Sky Devourer Bat. Hence, he’s good at speed. This Sky Devourer I meet now might be powerful but might not be good at speed?”

“Maybe,” King of Venomous Worms replied.

“In other words, with my current power, once I leave the spaceship, I put full play to all my trump cards and start running, I should stand a chance to escape,” Jian Wushuang was extremely calm.

“If it was any other place, it would be almost impossible. However, in the Ancient Star Sea, there’s hope,” King of Venomous Worms said solemnly.

“That’s great!” Jian Wushuang held his fists tight and there was hope in his eyes.

“Jian Wushuang,” there was a voice suddenly.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang turned around.

After Duan Lingfeng reassured Luo Yu and Luo Hai, he walked ahead slowly and said, “I’m coming with you.”

“You’re coming with me?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Although he had drunk with Duan Lingfeng before, they couldn’t be considered best friends. He could actually treat him like any other person.

“You saved Yu and Hai previously. Now, I’m going to save you. Then, we are even,” Duan Lingfeng looked cold, “Let me take care of the person outside!”

Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Every Universe God on the spaceship looked at Duan Lingfeng in shock.

“Are you confident you can take care of him?” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but ask.

Duan Lingfeng was very strong, but the poison in him had yet to clear and his fighting power had yet to recover to its peak. On top of that, his diving power started transforming not long ago. The man in the black robe was an actually a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven, and he was a Sky Devourer!

Could Duan Lingfeng fight against him?

Duan Lingfeng’s voice was cold and he simply said, “Let’s give it a try.”

“Yu, Hai, stay on the spaceship.”

Just as Duan Lingfeng spoke, he plundered out from the spaceship.

Jian Wushuang’s facial expression changed and he left the spaceship.

Looking at Jian Wushuang leaving the spaceship, the man in the black robe beamed with joy.

“Haha, here he comes. My prey is coming!” The youth in the black robe was in total madness and his body moved towards Jian Wushuang.

Humph!”

Duan Lingfeng humped and took a huge stride. The saber behind him was suddenly out of its scabbard too.

Buzz!

A crimson sword light suddenly swung out.

The exact same technique as when he killed the five three-marked Purple Martens but the only difference was that the manner of the stroke was much stronger!

The crimson sword light plunged towards the youth in the black robe.

“Which idiot is this? I have no time to play with you. F*ck off.”

The youth in the black robe didn’t bother with Duan Lingfeng but waved his hand and let his divine power flow out.
