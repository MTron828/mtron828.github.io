Chapter 813: The Xia Clan

“They’re from the Xia Clan. And, that man is their second master!”

“It’s him!”

“No wonder the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master came to greet him personally. It turned out to be the second master of the Xia Clan. It is said that he is known as the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World!”

“The number one Divine Realm expert? Really?”

“Yes, of course. Rumor has it that he, as a Divine Realm expert, once defeated an expert at the top of Step Four of the Divine Realm. It’s incredible!”

“A Divine Realm expert defeated an expert at the top of Step Four of the Eternal Realm? How could that be?”

“Nothing is impossible. There are overwhelming numbers of exceptional geniuses in the Eternal World, and the second master is definitely one of the greatest ones. Not only that, I heard that his elder brother is more incredible than him.”

The whole Cercis Island was currently in a hubbub. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

And the topic was the second master of the Xia Clan that they had just seen.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang and Yang Zaixuan stood side by side in the air and watched the second master fly off into the distance.

“The second master of the Xia Clan? What’s his background?” Jian Wushuang asked.

He had been in the Firmament Territory since arriving in the Eternal World, so it was his first time leaving. He knew so little about the Eternal World and had never heard of the Xia Clan.

“My Master has mentioned the Xia Clan to me,” answered Yang Zaixuan.

Jian Wushuang was intrigued and quickly turned to face Yang Zaixuan. After all, Yang Zaixuan’s Master was Emperor Xiao, one of the four great Emperors in the Tang of the East. Since Emperor Xiao had once mentioned the Xia Clan, it meant that they were by no means an ordinary clan.

“My Master said that during the founding of the Tang of the East, there were many powerful clans there. These clans mostly have a long history and the Xia Clan is the most powerful among them! They are called the overlord clan in the Tang of the East and are recognized as the most powerful clan,” Yang Zaixuan said.

“An overlord clan?” Jian Wushuang’s heart throbbed.

That was an extremely high assessment for a clan.

That meant the Xia Clan must have an extraordinary history.

“The Xia Clan existed when the Tang Emperor built the Tang of the East. And, whether it was during the reign of the Tang Emperor or during the Prosperous Age of the Tang of the East, when the four great Emperors reigned together, the Tang of the East has always been wary of them,” added Yang Zaixuan.

“Been wary of them?” Jian Wushuang asked in surprise.

“Technically, it was just that they’re being careful.”

Yang Zaixuan nodded and went on, “When my Master talked about the Xia Clan, his words clearly contained a hint of anxiety towards them. When I asked him why, he said that it was because the Xia Clan has an extremely horrifying Ancestor. Even the Tang Emperor and Empress Qing, the most powerful Emperor of the four great Emperors, did not dare to look down on him. Even in the heyday of the Tang of the East, they didn’t interfere with each other. But now, the overall strength of the Tang of the East has been greatly weakened and Empress Leng is the only one of the four great Emperors in charge of the country. Thus, their uneasiness towards the Xia Clan must have deepened.”

“Oh,” Jian Wushuang nodded. Now, he had a general understanding of what was going on.

“I have also heard of the second master of the Xia Clan. He is Xia Yan, an exceptional genius that his clan carefully cultivated. Even though he is in the Divine Realm, he once beat an expert at the top of Step Four of the Eternal Realm, so he is recognized as the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World!” Yang Zaixuan added.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.? ? You’re reading on .Tks!

The Eternal World was vast, with innumerable experts and countless geniuses.

The Firmament Territory was only a common domain in the Eternal World. There were very few experts in the Divine Realm there that were strong enough to contend with ordinary Eternal Realm experts, let alone competing with stronger ones.

Therefore, within the Firmament Territory, even the strongest Divine Realm experts could only contend with an ordinary Eternal Realm expert.

But that was nothing serious if you looked throughout the vast Eternal World.

In the Eternal World, truly strong Divine Realm experts were rare, but there were some. Just looking at Cercis Island, almost all the Divine Realm experts who won 10 consecutive victories in the Blood Battle Arena were fairly strong Divine Realm experts.

Here, the ordinary Divine Realm experts could only be compared with the experts at Step One of the Eternal Realm, while some of the exceptional Divine Realm experts could be compared with the experts at Step Two or even Step Three of the Eternal Realm.

As a super genius carefully cultivated by the Xia Clan, and the number one Divine Realm expert recognized by the Eternal World, it was normal for Xia Yan to be able to defeat an expert at the peak of Step Four of the Eternal Realm.

“Xia Yan is powerful indeed, but compared with you, he isn’t so impressive. You killed Lei Xin after all. When you are in a good mood in the future, go and directly challenge him so you can claim the title of the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World,” Yang Zaixuan said nonchalantly.

“Haha, Second brother, don’t make fun of me.”

Jian Wushuang laughed, “Xia Yan is the second master of the Xia Clan. With such a high status, he must have many trump cards and skills. Even if I could defeat him, I’m not stupid enough to offend him for an empty title. After all, he is from the Xia Clan.”

“Yes, you’re right,” Yang Zaixuan nodded slightly as well.

Actually, neither Jian Wushuang nor Yang Zaixuan were interested in empty titles like the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World and the number one genius.

The only thing they desired was substantial benefits.

“All right, stop chatting. Let’s go. Your captain is likely to have waited anxiously,” Jian Wushuang said.

Then they set off again. It didn’t take long for them to arrive at the military camp of the Cercis Army.

After they arrived at the military camp, they quickly met the governor of the Cercis Army.

He was a middle-aged man who looked burly, but according to his aura, he was not someone to be underestimated.

There were many experts in the Cercis Army. However, the middle-aged man was not a Dao Master. But, as a governor, he was almost invincible amongst experts in the Eternal Realm!

“Governor,” Yang Zaixuan gave a slight salute.

The middle-aged man nodded and looked at Jian Wushuang with his big eyes that resembled two brass bells. “You are Swordsman?” he asked.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang answered calmly.

Then, he looked Jian Wushuang up and down before saying, “Someone wants to see you, come with me.”

Jian Wushuang, though puzzled, followed the middle-aged man inside the military camp while Yang Zaixuan stayed where he was and waited for him.

Not long after, they entered a huge tent in the center of the military camp, where there was a person waiting for them.

“It’s you who wanted to see me?” Jian Wushuang looked at the green-dressed girl and frowned.

He knew the girl.

In the Blood Battle Arena, his first opponent was this girl. He had taken it easy on her, so he had not hurt her.

Afterwards, the girl took the initiative to come to meet him, but he had ignored her.

Jian Wushuang remembered that her name was Lin Wan.
