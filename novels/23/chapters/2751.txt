Chapter 2752: The Namelist of Experts

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“You have four more?”

Old Snake was dumbfounded when he saw Jian Wushuang take out four more Huangji Golden Pill.

Huangji Golden Pill was extremely scarce not only in Danyang Holy Domain but even the entire Nine Realms of Golden Crow.

The previous pill that appeared as Star Picking Pavilion Auction’s final treasure had caused a huge sensation. In the end, the top forces alongside their Grand Ultimate Gods went forth and fought frantically for the pill.

It was hard to get even one Huangji Golden Pill as it took great opportunity and methods to obtain it.

Jian Wushuang surprisingly took out five Huangji Golden Pills at that moment.

Old Snake was certain the Danyang Continent would turn into tumult if news spread that Jian Wushuang alone had five Huangji Golden Pills with countless experts making their way to get their hands on those pills without a doubt.

Jian Wushuang was toying with the four Huangji Golden Pills in his hand when he murmured, “I have five Huangji Golden Pills, but they’re of no use to me. I still have four left after giving Old Snake one. I’d better put these four to better use.”

Jian Wushuang looked at Old Snake. “Old Snake, you were previously an independent expert. Tell me, do you think those other independent experts like yourself will agree to join me if I offer them these Huangji Golden Pills?”

Old Snake frowned and pondered for a moment before speaking, “The Huangji Golden Pill is extremely valuable and appealing to Grand Ultimate Gods, especially some Grand Ultimate Gods who had been stuck in a cultivation bottleneck for a long time. The Huangji Golden Pill is of great help to Grand Ultimate Gods in helping them to make a breakthrough. It’s something precious for them to fight for, therefore I think most of those experts would agree if you put the Huangji Golden Pills up as an offer to recruit those Grand Ultimate Gods!”

“Of course, there are some experts with weird tempers who might stick to their principles. Those experts won’t join any forces even if they wanted a Huangji Golden Pill.”

“In other words, you mean it’s entirely up to the experts to decide?” Jian Wushuang asked with a smile.

“Yes.” Old Snake nodded.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes wandered as he thought of an idea and said, “Old Snake, you have been in the Danyang Continent for so long and should have known quite a few experts here. Can you recommend a few powerful Grand Ultimate Gods to me?”

“I can, what are your criteria for these Grand Ultimate Gods?” Old Snake asked.

“Firstly, they must be powerful and have the qualifications worthy of me giving them these Huangji Golden Pills. Secondly, they must not be vicious or some blood-thirsty devils and not be too close with any of the other top forces. Lastly, the most important matter is that their credibility must be guaranteed,” said Jian Wushuang.

Old Snake was startled. “Credibility? Are you worried they won’t keep to their word?”

Jian Wushuang nodded. “Yes, I’m offering them the Huangji Golden Pills to enhance their strength, so I’ll give them the Huangji Golden Pills in advance. I don’t want to see them ignoring the terms and conditions agreed upon and left after being given these Huangji Golden Pills. Even though I could kill them to vent my anger, it’s a waste of Huangji Golden Pills.”

“Understood, please wait while I quickly sort out a list of experts,” said Old Snake.

Jian Wushuang waited patiently.

After half a day, Old Snake appeared once again in front of Jian Wushuang and handed Jian Wushuang a list with names of experts.

“Alliance Master, I’ve written a list of experts that we can target. There are ten people on this list in which among them are three High-level Grand Ultimate Gods and seven Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods. All of them are very powerful and extremely eager to get their hands on some Huangji Golden Pills.”

“As per your criterion, these ten people have nothing to do with any top forces but had some enmity with them. As for their credibility, these ten people value their reputation so they won’t go back on their words after forging an agreement,” said Old Snake.

Jian Wushuang took the list and began to scrutinize it.

He was not only provided with the names of those ten Grand Ultimate Gods but also detailed information including some of their achievements and experiences listed in great detail.

Jian Wushuang looked carefully for a moment before nodding in satisfaction.

He was very happy with those ten on the list, especially two of them.

Of those two, one was Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin while the other one was a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God with terrifying strength.

Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin was famous in the Danyang Continent and far more well known than many other High-level Grand Ultimate Gods. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The reason being Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin was the first-ranked Primary-level Grand Ultimate God recognized by the entire Danyang Continent!

He used to face off against two High-level Grand Ultimate Gods while still only a Primary-level Grand Ultimate God. Although he was at a disadvantage in the battle, the two High-level Grand Ultimate Gods could not harm him and ended up allowing him to escape.

No one else in the Danyang Continent held similar achievement records except Jian Wushuang.

Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin was also very loyal to his wife.

His wife—the love of his life—was accidentally killed by an expert from one of the top forces. Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin immediately launched frenzied revenge and killed all those high-level experts of that particular force after finding out about it.

However, his wife could not be brought back to life no matter how much he avenged her. Therefore, his heart had become incapable of love from thereon which led to him being called Jue Xin.

Furthermore, Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin was not only loyal but also extremely stubborn and arrogant according to the list’s description.

He would ensure he completed it regardless of whatever he wanted to do.

On the same line of thought, he would also do his best to fulfill his promises.

Jian Wushuang admired such character in terms of both strength and temperament.

Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin was Jian Wushuang’s first target choice in his recruitment.

The second person was a High-level Grand Ultimate God called Strange Old Tong.

He was called strange and old from living for too long.

He was an expert from Crimson Stone Saint’s era. Strange Old Tong was already a famous High-level Grand Ultimate God before Crimson Stone Saint’s emergence.

Strange Old Tong was very famous in the Danyang Continent due to his high ranking amongst High-level Grand Ultimate Gods—being no inferior to Saber Master.

He was stuck at the High-level Grand Ultimate God realm for too long and therefore eager to make a breakthrough.
