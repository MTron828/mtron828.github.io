Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Wu Chao also looked at Jian Wushuang, waiting for the answer.

He was also interested in the man recommended by Jian Wushuang.

“The seventh level.” Jian Wushuang answered.

“Seventh?” Lord Wu Cang was surprised.

He had expected Jian Wushuang to pass all the ten levels based on his power.

But soon he realized that Jian Wushuang didn’t make full efforts. Jian Wushuang just intended to pass the test.

Wu Chao sneered, “Seventh? Only the minimum standard for joining the Snow Dojo. It seems that the talent you recommend just has a mediocre performance.”

“What about the talent you bring here?” Lord Wu Cang asked indifferently.

Wu Chao looked at the silent man standing behind him, “Show your capability, Dong Ao.”

“Yes, Master.” The man nodded and went to the Snow Tower, without a glance at Jian Wushuang.

“I don’t want to waste my time here. Let’s go, Jian Wushuang.” Lord Wu Cang then left with Jian Wushuang.

Wu Chao sneered and let them go.

“Who is that man? It seems that you don’t like him.” Jian Wushuang asked Lord Wu Cang.

“He is Wu Chao, another Golden Deacon. We have been competing with each other for the past few years.”

What Jian Wushuang had guessed was confirmed.

“Let’s go and meet the Chief Deacon.”

Lord Wu Cang led Jian Wushuang to an attic and came to a lady in green.

Though the lady looked tender, Jian Wushuang could feel with his soul power that she was actually more powerful than Lord Wu Cang.

Obviously, she was the Chief Deacon of the Snow Dojo.

“Deacon Green, this is Jian Wushuang who passed the test of the Snow Tower. I bring him here to apply for permission for him to join the ranked Battle of Universe Gods in the First Heaven.” Lord Wu Cang said directly his intention.

“You also want permission?” Deacon Green frowned.

“Is there anyone else who also wants permission?” Lord Wu Cang was surprised.

“Wu Chao has sent messages to me to apply for the permission.” Deacon Green said.

“Why does he want that?!” Lord Wu Cang was angry.

“Now I will call him to come here to discuss.” Deacon Green said.

After a while, Wu Chao came with the talent Dong Ao

Wu Chao and Dong Ao were still indifferent when he met Lord Wu Cang and Jian Wushuang. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“OK, let’s talk and decide who can get permission.”

Deacon Green analyzed, “There will be three Ranked Battles after three months. Ten Universe Gods in each Heaven will go to the battles. As for Universe Gods from the First Heaven, nine of them have been decided and there is only one left.”

“Who can get permission?”

“Of course Jian Wushuang,” Lord Wu Cang said, “only he can absolutely win in the battle!”

“Don’t be so arrogant. How many levels has Jian Wushuang passed in the Snow Tower?” Wu Chao asked.

“The Seventh.”

Wu Chao sneered, “How could he have the privilege to join the battle when he has only passed seven levels? Guess how many levels Dong Ao passed? Eight! And he nearly passed the ninth.”

“So it’s obvious that Dong Ao is more suitable.”

Even Deacon Green was surprised that Dong Ao almost passed nine levels.

After all, it was more difficult in higher levels.

Less than five Universe Gods could pass the ninth level. And they would join in the battles.”

“Just testing in the Snow Tower couldn’t prove anything.”

“OK, shut up” Deacon Green said, to stop them from quarreling.

“Do you know how important the Ranked Battle is? The reputation of Snow Dojo would be ruined if we lose again!” Deacon Green said emotionally.

Her voice was resounding around the palace.

And Lord Wu Cang and Wu Chao fell silent.

“OK. So let the two talents battle to decide who permission belongs to. It’s a simple method. Do you agree?”

Both Lord Wu Cang and Wu Chao nodded.

Jian Wushuang didn’t show disapproval.

And Dong Ao still glanced at Jian Wushuang indifferently.

He thought only a Universe God passing seven levels was worth no attention of his.

There was a boundless square in the Snow Dojo, and talents used to gather there to battle.

Jian Wushuang and Doing Ao came to the center of the square.

Other talents also came here to watch him battle.

Among them there was a slender and handsome man named Long Hao.

“Long Hao, you are the leader of the Universe Gods of the First Heaven. Watch their battle and decide which one is more suitable to join your team in the battle.”

“Yes, Deacon.” Long Hao nodded.
