Chapter 3095: Challenge

A large number of geniuses from the heaven-cleaving three palaces were gathered there, and most of them were dissatisfied.

“Humph, the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm is about to open. If nothing unexpected happens, that outsider should also rush to the Heaven-cleaving Star and enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm with Piercing Tiger and Thunder God. I’d like to see what kind of three heads and six arms he has to make the three Palace Masters treat him so well.”

Many people were aggressive and waiting for the ‘outsider’ to arrive.

Not long after, Jian Wushuang appeared in front of the geniuses of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance under the guidance of Mo Shan.

“Master Mo Shan.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

A top True Saint immediately came to Mo Shan, followed by two people, Piercing Tiger and Thunder God.

One of them had a cold aura, while the other was extremely violent. They first bowed slightly to Mo Shan, then looked directly at Jian Wushuang.

Not only them, but many genius disciples from the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces also looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Is he the outsider?”

“A rank one True Saint doesn’t seem to be anything special?”

“I really don’t see anything special about him. I don’t know where he got the ability to ask the three Palace Masters to make an exception and give him a slot in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm.”

Discussions immediately broke out.

Among the genius disciples of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, Jian Wushuang also knew some of them.

First, there were Mountain King, Evil Master, and MIrage Water.

When they saw Jian Wushuang’s face clearly, their expressions immediately became very interesting.

“It’s, it’s him!”

“It’s that pervert!”

“So it’s him. No wonder he can get a place to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm.”

The three looked at each other in dismay, and their hearts lit up.

The three of them had fought with Jian Wushuang before, and they had even fought him head-on.

That battle was still vivid in their minds.

It was in the white bone region. The three of them had joined hands and tried their best, but they were defeated by the man in front of them.

The three of them had been beaten into submission and had no temper at all. At that time, they had decided that Jian Wushuang was a complete monster.

When they found out that the outsider who had obtained the quota to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm was this monster, they could accept it in their hearts.

In addition to the three of them, Qian Chen, who had once dealt with Jian Wushuang, was also in the crowd.

“It’s him, Heavenly Sword Marquis!”

Qian Chen stared at Jian Wushuang, but his eyes were shining.

When he had completed his mission, he had met Jian Wushuang and fought him head-on.

At that time, he had broken through to become a Peak False Saint, and Jian Wushuang was only a Divine Master at that time.

But in the end, this Divine Master was on par with him, a Peak False Saint!

After all, he was a genuine genius. He had been in the Heaven and Earth Palace before, but after this competition, he had entered the Primitive Palace. But he asked himself, his talent was not on the same level as Jian Wushuang’s, he was definitely not on the same level as Jian Wushuang.

In a corner of the crowd, Long Yun and Xue Yu stood together. They looked at each other with a trace of shock in their eyes.

“It’s him?”

“When we met him, we saw that his talent was very high, so he could at least enter the Primitive Palace and maybe even the Chaos Palace. But now…he can ask the three Palace Masters to make an exception and give him a place to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm? How strong is he now?”

Long Yun and Xue Yu were secretly praising him.

Whether it was Mountain King, Evil Master, Mirage Water, Qian Chen, Long Yun, or Xue Yu, they had seen Jian Wushuang’s strength with their own eyes and knew a little about his talent, therefore, when they knew that Jian Wushuang was the outsider who got the spot, they could accept it in their hearts.

But the others did not think so.

Whoosh!

A figure dashed out from the crowd and appeared directly in front of Mo Shan and Jian Wushuang.

“Lord Mo Shan.” The man was wearing a black robe, handsome, and exuded the aura of a rank one True Saint.

“Oh, Gu Tong, what’s the matter?” Mo Shan looked down.

“Lord Mo Shan, the person next to you should be the lucky one who got the last quota to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, right?” Gu Tong asked.

“Lucky person?” Mo Shan raised his eyebrows and then said with a smile, “Indeed, the last slot belongs to our young friend Heavenly Sword Marquis. This is the order of the three Palace Masters. No one can disobey it.”

“As expected.” Gu Tong’s eyes turned cold and looked directly at Jian Wushuang. “Heavenly Sword Marquis, right? Since you can make the three Palace Masters make an exception to give you the slot to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, your strength and talent must be extraordinary. Since we are both rank one True Saints, I’ll challenge you here. I wonder if you dare to accept it!”

“Yes!”

Gu Tong emphasized the word ‘dare’, which was obviously a bit aggressive.

Hearing Gu Tong’s words, Jian Wushuang’s expression became strange. He glanced at Mo Shan and asked, “Elder Mo Shan, what’s going on?”

“Haha, I told you before that the quota to enter the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm is very limited. Even in the Three Palaces of Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, there are only three slots every 10,000 years. Since you are given one, there are only two slots left in the Three Palaces of Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm. This will inevitably make some geniuses of the Three Palaces of Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm unconvinced. Gu Tong, whom you are seeing now, is from the Chaos Palace and is publicly recognized as the number one rank one True Saint in the Three Palaces of Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm.”

“Like Piercing Tiger and Thunder God, one is a rank two True Saint, the other is a rank three True Saint. They are the strongest among their peers. Without you, Gu Tong might have gotten the third spot,” Mo Shan said softly.

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang understood.

He also knew why Gu Tong was so angry that he directly came to challenge him.

It seemed that the quota he got now was very likely to be his?

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, don’t hide behind Lord Mo Shan. Dare you accept my challenge? Say something,” Gu Tong shouted coldly again.

Jian Wushuang still did not answer, while Mo Shan glanced at the Peak True Saint next to him and asked, “How long until the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm opens?”

“Your Excellency, there should be an hour left,” the Peak True Saint replied.

“An hour is plenty of time. My young friend, Heavenly Sword Marquis, you might as well fight with Gu Tong so that he will be convinced. Also, let the other disciples of the three palaces know that the three Palace Masters gave you the third spot for a reason,” Mo Shan said.
