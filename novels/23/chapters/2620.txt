Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“How many Primordial Stones did San Shouwang borrow from you?” Jian Wushuang calmly asked.

“Not much, only thirty million Primordial Stones and the little love between him and me worth more or less twenty million Primordial Stones, so you only need to fork out fifty million Primordial Stones. I shall call it a truce with that and you may continue being the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord and do whatever you want,” suggested Yuan Lei.

“Fifty million Primordial Stones aren’t too many,” said Jian Wushuang indifferently.

A weird smile appeared on Yuan Lei’s face.

He did have a little friendship with San Shouwang but their relationship had faded long ago. San Shouwang did borrow some Primordial Stones from Yuan Lei to buy the fourth volume of the Divine Destruction Beast manual but it was only 6,000,000 Primordial Stones, yet he had asked for 50,000,000 which was an exorbitant amount.

He only did so because he was aware of Jian Wushuang’s wealth. 50,000,000 Primordial Stones was nothing to Jian Wushuang.

Yuan Lei had decided that he would never trouble Jian Wushuang again if Jian Wushuang was willing to give him 50,000,000 Primordial Stones. He was the Star Picking Pavilion’s Golden Chief and he had to comply with the Star Picking Pavilion’s policies after all.

He could still avoid doing anything that goes against their policies.

“I have fifty million Primordial Stones, but what are you going to do if I won’t give it to you?” Jian Wushuang casually asked.

“No? Jian Yi, I advise you to think carefully about it. You ought to know your life is worth more than the fifty million Primordial Stone even if it’s a lot.” Yuan Lei smiled faintly as a huge wave of divine power was sent across aiming at Jian Wushuang at the same time.

“So this is a Heaven Ultimate God’s divine power?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes suddenly constricted.

He knew the weakest of Star Picking Pavilion’s chiefs were at least a Peak Earth Ultimate God with most of their Golden Chief at the Heaven Ultimate God realm.

He knew Yuan Lei was a genuine Heaven Ultimate God.

However, Jian Wushuang did not have the slightest fear after knowing his opponent was a Heaven Ultimate God. His eyes were showing a strong intent to fight on the contrary.

“After spending ten years cultivating in seclusion, I’ve achieved Merit in Sword World and made a breakthrough to Peak Ultimate God realm. My combat prowess is at the Peak Earth Ultimate God level and I’m now able to fight against a weak Heaven Ultimate God if I opt to put my full abilities to use!

“Although I’ve made no major breakthroughs in understanding Sword Principle and Laws nor improvements in my cultivation realm, my strength has improved by several folds through regaining the Stately Painting!

“It’s still unsure who’s stronger if I try my best to fight against Yuan Lei!”

Jian Wushuang was looking forward to finding that out as he stared at Yuan Lei closely and licked his lips.

“Yuan Lei, right? I have fifty million Primordial Stones in my Interspatial Ring and also many other treasures. All of these will belong to you if you managed to kill me. This may be a huge sum of money, but can you take it from me?” Jian Wushuang scoffed.

“Do you have a death wish?” Yuan Lei’s eyes went wide. “If that’s the case, I shall fulfill your wish!”

Yuan Lei instantly fired out after he said so.

Boom!

A majestic aura wave led by a huge gush of divine power came like a torrent.

All the divine power instantly formed a green beast in front of Yuan Lei that was full of vitality. The green beast let out a roar before charging at Jian Wushuang.

It continued to evolve and increased its size tenfold until it reached a few hundred feet high before it appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

The several hundred feet high green beast was like a huge mountain as it dashed toward Jian Wushuang with its mouth wide open as though it could swallow the entire world.

The divine power pressed on Jian Wushuang without giving him any chance to escape.

“This is really powerful. You’re indeed a Heaven Ultimate God.” Jian Wushuang stood in the void and looked up to admire the green beast coming down at him.

Five years ago, he had seen the scary battle between Heaven Ultimate Gods and Grand Ultimate Gods during the fight of the Huangji Golden Pill.

At that time, he was far away from the battlefield and had not personally participated in the battlefield, hence he did not manage to grasp a feel of Heaven Ultimate God’s power.

Even though he did break into the battlefield later, all he did was threaten the people on the battlefield with his life rating pressure without any chance to fight against the Heaven Ultimate Gods.

At this time, he was all alone and could finally feel the strength of a Heaven Ultimate God.

The green beast was just a simple trick performed by Yuan Lei at will, but its power was sufficiently strong to put any ordinary Earth Ultimate God in despair.

An ordinary Earth Ultimate God—even some of the weaker Peak Ultimate Gods—might not even have a survival chance under that green beast’s mouth.

However, Jian Wushuang was not included among those Earth Ultimate Gods.

He kept a cold and desolate look on his face as the Seven Stars Secret Technique within his body began brewing whereas the aura on his body had also instantly climbed from a High-level Earth Ultimate God to the Peak Earth Ultimate God level. The Blood Mountain Sword behind him was instantly unsheathed and moved along with his steps.

A monstrous killing intent that had been infinitely magnified rose all of a sudden.

Kill! Kill! Kill!

Jian Wushuang’s entire mind and body were replaced by the murderous intent.

His eyes slowly closed before reopened again.

A terrifying killing intent shot out the moment his eyes opened.

Space-time Sword Technique, Fifth Style—Killing Heart!

Hum!

A scarlet sword-light with murderous intent came down.

The scarlet sword-light carried a terrifying power which instantly cut the mountain-liked green beast that was hundreds of feet tall into half, yet the sword-light remained unabated and continued cutting through the void above right into the sky.

Infinite divine power breath was disseminated.

“Oh?” Yuan Lei gave Jian Wushuang a surprised look. “No wonder he’s so arrogant. He’s quite powerful.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang snorted coldly as he shot out a few streams of light using his mind.

Those light streams were coming from black swords that exuded a cold breath with a large amount of Transmigration Strength. Those were the Infernal Crimson Divine Sword!

Nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords—nine Heavenly Treasure Divine Weapons—arranged in a line before Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang then pointed with a finger.

Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!

The nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords began to evolve into nine Reincarnation Passages in the blink of an eye.

Those nine Reincarnation Passages were huge, mysterious, and unpredictable.
