Chapter 1031: It’s Him

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang lived in Ding Mo’s mansion to wait for the result.

Five days passed in the twinkling of an eye.

Jian Wushuang alone practiced his swordsmanship in an empty courtyard.

Buzz!

A splendid sword shadow pierced the Void easily and disappeared from the Void quickly, leaving an opening on space. It was so fast that it could not be caught by the naked eye.

This sword movement proved to be the Death Shadow.

Jian Wushuang stopped after performing this sword movement.

“This move is getting more and more powerful.” Jian Wushuang murmured smilingly.

He had been meditating swordsmanship and Sword Principle these years. As a result, his Sword Principle was greatly improved and the power of his swordsmanship elevated.

Though his Aurora Sword Principle was still at the General Level, it was not far from reaching the Universe Level.

Moreover, his Coalescence Sword Principle… He had been trying to integrate more Sword Principles into it. Currently, he had integrated eight Sword Principles from the mysterious scroll into it and combined eight different Essences together.

Until now, the Coalescence Sword Principle barely became an Earth-level Sword Principle.

He had created two Universe Level Sword Principles and a General Level Sword Principle presently.

The more powerful the Sword Principle one created, the more beneficial it would be on elevating one’s strength.

“It’s easy to create Universe Level Sword Principles, but it will be quite difficult to upgrade them to the Creation Level. I cannot imagine how long will it take to make them the most powerful Sword Principles.” Jian Wushuang muttered.

His goal was to make them the most powerful Sword Principles. Although he had created three Sword Principles, there was still a long way for him to go.

Right at this moment, several figures suddenly flew upward from the mansion. They proved to be Ding Mo and several experts under his command.

They appeared in the Void above the mansion and looked into the distance, as if they were waiting for someone.

“Who is able to make Elder Ding Mo welcome him personally?”?Jian Wushuang was surprised.

As the Inner Elder of the Samsara Temple, Ding Mo enjoyed a high status and was absolutely qualified to be called an overlord on the Samsara Continent. Thus, the people he was waiting for must be very eminent.

In just a few seconds, three figures came here one after another.

All of them exuded an overwhelming aura. Apparently, they were Rank Three Dao Masters. The two men standing beside a striking young man dressed in a golden robe were genuine experts at the Peak of Rank Three.

The young man always wore a smile and appeared gentle and cultivated. The most striking part was his midbrow. There existed a vertical scarlet Mark, a sword scar.

Seeing them, Ding Mo and others experts greeted them immediately.

In the courtyard, Jian Wushuang stared at that golden-robed man.

He was very familiar with that man.

His face had appeared in his mind more than once.

After so many years, he finally saw him again.

“It’s him!”

“It’s him!!!”

Jian Wushuang roared in his heart and his eyes became sharper than ever at this moment.

“Jian Wushuang, do you know him?”?Gu King’s surprised voice sounded in Jian Wushuang’s heart.

“Yes, of course.”?Jian Wushuang’s cold voice filled with tremendous killing intent.

Jian Wushuang soon regained his composure and simultaneously looked away.

That elegant man was talking with Ding Mo at this point, so he did not notice Jian Wushuang. Led by Ding Mo, he entered the meeting hall at the center of the Governor Mansion.

Jian Wushuang instantly went to find an expert living in the Governor Mansion.

Ding Mo possessed many powerful guards whose commanders were real Dao Masters. Some commanders lived in the Governor Mansion.

“Commander Xu.” Jian Wushuang came to a commander surnamed Xu.

“Blood Mountain my brother, what’s up?” Commander Xu was quite polite to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang used the alias “Blood Mountain” when he lived in the Governor Mansion. Commander Xu had met him and knew that he was Ding Mo’s guest.

The one being able to be Ding Mo’s guest definitely had an extraordinary background, so even if he was aware that Jian Wushuang was just an Eternal Realm expert, he did not dare to put on airs.

“Nothing. I am just curious why Elder Ding Mo greeted the three people who have just arrived personally.?I speculate that they must be out of the ordinary?” Jian Wushuang seemed to ask casually. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“They?” Commander Xu raised his eyebrows and laughed. “Of course. They are from the Ancient Monster Clan.”

“The Ancient Monster Clan?” Jian Wushuang’s heart throbbed.

The Ancient Monster Clan was one of the four top populations.

“It turns out that they are experts from a top population.” Jian Wushuang pretended to sigh with emotion.

“Haha, our Master would not have welcomed them in person just due to that reason. What matters the most is the man standing in the middle, the Dao Master Nine Sword. Although his strength is inferior to that of the other two men, he enjoys quite a high status in the Ancient Monster Clan. The two Dao Masters behind him were sent to protect him by the Ancient Monster Clan.” Commander Xu said.

“Dao Master Nine Sword?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed. “Is he very powerful?”

“I don’t know. I only know he is well-known in the Divine Monster Territory. It’s said that the Ancient Monster Clan regards him as a treasure. But I cannot figure out what’s so special about him. If you’re curious about him, you can go to any intelligence organization to acquire his information.” Commander Xu said.

“I see.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “Thank you, Commander Xu.”

After that, he turned around and left.

According to what Commander?Xu had said, he left the Governor Mansion and found a store that sold intelligence in the city. Soon afterwards, he obtained detailed information about the Ancient Monster Clan and Dao Master Nine Sword.

Then he returned to the Governor Mansion, closed the door, and leafed through the information alone.

His pupils shrank and some cold light flickered in his eyes after he glanced over the information about the Ancient Monster Clan.

“As I expected!”

“The Ancient Monster Clan is the population with the bloodline of the Ancient God!”

“Jiu Xiu, no, Dao Master Nine Sword, after 2,000 years, we finally meet again…”
