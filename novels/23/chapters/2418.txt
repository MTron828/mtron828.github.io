Chapter 2419: Dissatisfied

The eighth trial bridge that required passing a total of 81 test floors was broken through by someone, the sword principles insights and Purple Blood Sword Principle left behind by Purple Blood Saint had been obtained.

In Saint’s Tomb, the news took the genius disciples from various sects by storm.

One had to realize that there were only 16 levels of trials in Saint’s Tomb in the beginning, and it got harder by the level.

Ever since the discovery of Saint’s Tomb, it had opened many times and only seven trials had been broken through.

Every time a trial was broken through in the abyss, it would cause a stir.

The current situation was not an exception either.

Furthermore, it was the eighth trial bridge that was broken through.

Everyone knew that among the various trials in Saint’s Tomb, the eighth trial bridge was definitely one of the hardest to be broken through.

Among the 81 test floors, the best result previously set by a person was breaking through 73 floors.

It was because of that, people were more shocked when the news had gotten out.

At the same time, they were all curious.

“Who could that be? Who broke through the eighth trial bridge?”

“No idea, the eighth trial bridge had already disappeared when we came.”

“Saint’s Tomb has barely been opened for more than ten days, isn’t this person a bit too fast? Really, who is it?”

All the genius disciples wanted to know who had passed the trial, but nobody had a clue.

After all, only Narcissus Island disciples knew about Jian Wushuang breaking through the eighth trial bridge. As long as they kept quiet, it would be difficult for others to find out.

However, there were people who tried to find out the person who passed the trial despite the difficulty by using all kinds of methods.

Most of those people were swordsmanship geniuses!

The Sword had always been one of the most commonly seen weapons in the world.

Those who entered Saint’s Tomb were genius disciples from different sects and quite a lot of them had swords as their main weapon.

Most of those genius disciples had all previously received information that among the opportunities offered in Saint’s Tomb, one of them was dedicated to sword principles.

Many people were after the sword principle trial and looking forward to trying it out.

However, somebody had already obtained the sword principle opportunity way ahead of them when they had just stepped into the inner area, causing them not to have the chance to try out the eighth trial bridge.

How were they willing to accept such a fact?

They naturally wanted to expose the person who had taken the opportunity.

Among those people, the most fanatical one was Pang Tao!

Pang Tao was the sixth Twelve Minor Kings, hailing from the Great Compassion Sect.

The Twelve Minor Kings were widely recognized as the top twelve geniuses in Wusha Wilderness. The fact that Pang Tao could be named sixth among them showed his exceptional qualities.

Other than that, Pang Tao was a sword cultivator. None of those from the Twelve Minor Kings above his ranking were good at sword principles. This also meant that he could be considered the number one sword cultivator among the younger generation in Wusha Wilderness!

He should have been the most hopeful candidate to break through the eighth trial bridge since he was the number one sword cultivator among the many younger generation genius disciples who had entered Saint’s Tomb.

Pang Tao himself also entered the tomb due to the eighth trial bridge. He had set himself on obtaining Purple Blood Saint’s cultivation insights and Purple Blood Sword Principle.

However, in the end...

Pang Tao’s face flushed up with blood while standing on the edge of the Trial Abyss and looking at where the eighth trial bridge should have been. His eyes were terrifyingly grim.

He was truly furious at that moment.

How he had longed for the opportunity that came with the eighth trial bridge.

However, at the same time, he understood perfectly how difficult it was to break through the trial on the eighth trial bridge. No sword geniuses had ever broken through the trial before. Not even he felt absolutely confident about it, let alone the others. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Hence, he was not hasty about it. Like the other disciples, he stayed in the outer area for ten days and collected some Purple Tokens before rushing into the inner area.

He thought that, since the trial bridge was there, the sword principle insights and the Purple Blood Sword Principle left behind by Purple Blood Saint would be there waiting patiently for him to take up the trial as well.

He was not in the slightest hurry.

However, he did not expect that the bridge had already been broken through when he arrived.

He—the number one young sword cultivator—had not taken up the trial, but the trial bridge was already gone.

He could not accept it!

Pang Tao felt incredibly unwilling to accept it!

All the unwillingness had turned into a surging wave of anger.

“Investigate, investigate it!”

Pang Tao growled like a furious beast.

There was another core disciple from the Great Compassion Sect whose heart skipped a bear when he saw Pang Tao’s expression and immediately went to investigate.

“I truly want to see who has such skills to break through the test on the eighth trial bridge in such a short time.” Pang Tao clenched his fists tight. His nails sunk into his flesh causing some blood to stream out.

Those who simultaneously went to investigate included quite a number of geniuses who were gifted in swordsmanship.

However, nobody saw what happened at the trial bridge with their own eyes, and since there were many genius disciples who entered the tomb, to find such a genius disciple who was gifted in swordsmanship and had broken through the trial was not easy.

Three days swiftly passed.

Most people gave up after not finding a clue within the past three days.

Only Pang Tao was still feeling extremely dissatisfied.

“So, any result?” Pang Tao was staring at the Great Compassion Sect core disciple in front of him with his bloodshot eyes.

The core disciple took a deep breath and solemnly said, “Senior Brother Pang Tao, I have tried every investigation method, but I still couldn’t discover who had broken through the test on the eighth trial bridge. I have also checked out the sword geniuses who had exceptional swordsmanship and would be able to pass the trial, but still couldn’t find any leads.”

“Which means that person who passed the trial isn’t someone we are aware of. It’s probably someone insignificant and has no fame?” Pang Tao frowned.

“Exactly, which made our investigation even harder,” said the core disciple.

“Hmph, the eighth trial bridge is so hard to pass. Even a genius who could defy the heavens would have to take quite a few days to breakthrough. We were among the ones who arrived here quite early, and yet when we got here, the eighth trial bridge had already disappeared. That means the person who had broken through the trial got to the inner area even earlier,” said Pang Tao softly.

“Start by investigating the order of people’s arrival. Find out which sect arrived at the inner area first or rather, who arrived at the inner area first. Let’s figure out which sects that came here the earliest, then we can begin filtering from there on.”
