Jin Yihang sent a message to the Crimson Stone Fort’s higher-ups and soon received a response.

“Jian Yi, Crimson Stone Fort agreed to fifteen Divine Elixir Pills. Lord King Scorpion will soon arrive from Crimson Stone Fort a few days later and personally give you the Divine Elixir Pills,” said Jin Yihang.

The corner of Jian Wushuang’s mouth was slightly raised.

“Let’s go.”

Jian Wushuang waved his hand and headed back to the camp with Cang Heng and the other commanders—ignoring Jin Yihang and his entourage.

Back in the camp...

“I can’t believe that Crimson Stone Fort agreed to fifteen Divine Elixir Pills?”

“I thought it’s already extremely generous of Crimson Stone Fort to give tens of millions of Primordial Stones, who knew they would agree to give fifteen Divine Elixir Pills!”

“This is also because our Territorial Lord is powerful. I’m afraid this inspector would’ve really not given us even a single Primordial Stone and make us work in vain if our Territorial Lord was someone ordinary. Although we’ll be dissatisfied, there’s nothing we can do about it.”

A few commanders were sighing and admiring Jian Wushuang.

“Territorial Lord, did you know that the Crimson Stone Fort higher-ups would agree to your request for fifteen Divine Elixir Pills?” Cang Heng looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang shook his head before continuing, “No, I wasn’t sure. Although I’m not sure whether they’ll agree to give me fifteen Divine Elixir Pills, they’ll agree to give us a huge sum of Primordial Stones as they aren’t as stupid as Jin Yihang.

“This rule of the stellar region having a share of the wealth upon the discovery of any valuable resources in their stellar regions has been enforced by the Crimson Stone Fort for a long time to satisfy the stellar region’s territorial lord and official army.

“Take this Blood Gem mineral vein as an example—if the Northern Darkstar Territory hands over to the Crimson Stone Fort without receiving any benefits, the Northern Darkstar Territory will never again do so for any new resources in the future.

“Secondly, even if Crimson Stone Fort used some despicable means and forced us to guard the Blood Gem mineral vein, our armies will be dissatisfied and might even do a lousy job of monitoring and guarding. The Official Army might even pocket some Blood Gems which caused Crimson Stone Fort to end up losing even more!

“Crimson Stone Fort won’t be so stupid to make that sort of decision.”

The commanders nodded in agreement.

A few days later, Jian Wushuang arrived with a few Official Army Commanders in the void above the Blood Gem mineral vein. Jin Yihang and the others respectfully stood there and waited as more than ten black spots soon appeared in the void.

Those more than ten black spots were getting larger as they approached and soon appeared in front of Jian Wushuang in the blink of an eye.

“Jin Yihang meets Lord Scorpion King.”

Jin Yihang and the four Peak Earth Ultimate Gods behind him immediately bowed and saluted before Jian Wushuang and the Official Army Commanders followed suit.

Jian Wushuang was observing those people’s strength at the same time.

He was quite shaken up after his observation.

The more than a dozen people were experts above the Heaven Ultimate God realm!

Especially the beefy middle-aged man Lord King Scorpion King wearing black armor and leading the group, his divine power breath had completely exceeded the Heaven Ultimate God realm. He was a Grand Ultimate God!

Crimson Stone Fort had sent a Grand Ultimate God along with more than a dozen Heaven Ultimate Gods. It only showed how much attention the Crimson Stone Fort paid toward the Blood Gem mineral vein.

“Jin Yihang? Jin Yan’s younger generation?” The beefy middle-aged man, Lord King Scorpion glanced at Jin Yihang and snorted softly.

The light snort seemed insouciant, but Jian Wushuang saw and got the idea.

He could see that Lord King Scorpion was a bit displeased with Jin Yihang—to be precise with Jin Yan.

“Are they from different factions?” Jian Wushuang muttered secretly.

He knew that Crimson Stone Fort was divided into many factions.

Those factions fought overtly and covertly, but matters never got too ugly. The Lord King Scorpion’s behavior toward Jin Yan and Jin Yihang clearly showed that they were not part of his faction.

“Are you the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord?” Lord King Scorpion looked at Jian Wushuang again.

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded in neither a humble nor pert manner.

“Here are the fifteen Divine Elixir Pills that you wanted.” Lord King Scorpion waved and threw an Interspatial Ring over before saying, “I’ve given the Divine Elixir Pills to you, but I hope the Blood Gem mineral vein mining will go smoothly with no more changes. Otherwise...”

“Master, don’t worry. Our Northern Darkstar Territory Official Army will go all out to ensure there’ll be no problems in mining the Blood Gems,” said Jian Wushuang.

“That’s good.” Lord King Scorpion nodded.

“Commander Cang Heng, let’s start mining,” said Jian Wushuang.

“Yes.” Cang Heng immediately acted. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Jian Wushuang had already sent someone to gather cultivators for mining the Blood Gems before Lord King Scorpion and the others even turned up.

The refinement materials for Heavenly Treasures Blood Gems were not easy to mine as it’s extremely hard and buried deep underground, hence cultivators who worked on mining must at least be in the Divine Demon realm—precisely Second-class Divine Demons and even First-class Divine Demons. They must also possess a tyrannical divine power foundation before they could mine the Blood Gems.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate to spend a lot of money and brought in a large number of Divine Demons from other wildernesses for that reason.

A few ten thousand Divine Demon realm cultivators were gathered as a result of Jian Wushuang promising them a lot of benefits in return.

A few ten thousand cultivators had started mining under Jian Wushuang’s commands while the Official Army dispatched four army battalions to guard the area whilst the others returned to Northern Darkstar Territory.

As for Jian Wushuang, he returned to the camp and immediately began seclusion cultivation.

Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged in an exquisite attic completely covered by the restrictive shield with the 19 Divine Elixir Pills before him!

“I hope the nineteen Diviner Elixir Pills won’t let me down!”

Jian Wushuang was excited as he began to absorb and refine those Divine Elixir Pills.

Time flew past in the blink of an eye and soon a month had passed.

Jian Wushuang had been sitting with his eyes closed in the attic where he suddenly shook before sharply opening his eyes that shone brightly.

The divine power breath from his body was many times stronger than before.

“What good luck! Although I’ve only swallowed nineteen Divine Elixir Pills, I still managed to make a breakthrough!

“I’m now an Earth Ultimate God!”
