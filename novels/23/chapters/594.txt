Chapter 595: Marquis Lanyue

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Jian Wushuang left the Ancestor’s Land after obtaining the Ancient World Token.

Next...

“It’s time to go to the Divine Land.”

Killing intent flashed in his eyes.

However, there were no wormholes connecting the Nanyang Continent to the Divine Land, so Jian Wushuang had to travel there on foot.

The first time he went, it had taken him a year to travel to the Divine Land.

He was weak at that time, so he walked slowly, not to mention that practicing on his way to the Divine Land had also delayed him.

But now, he had become much more powerful. It only took him several days to arrive at the Divine Land.

There was an exquisite pavilion named the Heaven Secret Pavilion. It had a good reputation in the Divine Land because it was said that four marquises and a sovereign guarded it.

The Heaven Secret Pavilion was known for being the number one intelligence organization.

In a secret chamber of the Heaven Secret Pavilion, a black-robed elder respectfully handed Jian Wushuang a pile of documents that were filled with information. “Sir, this is what you need.”

Jian Wushuang paid with Raw Gems and then flipped through it by himself.

It provided detailed information about what had happened in the Divine Land during the period while he was gone, including the rise and fall of experts.

It also contained some information on the Three Ancestors.

Jian Wushuang kept reading.

The greatest change in the Divine Land was that a Fourth Ancestor appeared.

It was Su Ming!

Su Ming had fought with Blind Emperor. As a result, he made a breakthrough to the Skyscraping Realm at a critical moment and killed Blind Emperor.

Since he had reached the Skyscraping Realm, he was qualified to become an Ancestor.

He should have been named Sword Ancestor, but there had been a Sword Ancestor in the Divine Land, so Su Ming had to use another title, “Sword Demon”.

Currently, the Four Ancestors were the Holy Ancestor, the Spirit Ancestor, the Stone Ancestor and the Demon Ancestor.

They were the topmost existences in the Divine Land.

The number of Sovereigns had also lessened to eight because of Su Ming’s promotion.

Some small changes had occurred among the marquises while Jian Wushuang was away, but there were still 72 Marquises in the Divine Land.

Jian Wushuang glanced through the information about the marquises, but he did not pay them any mind until he came across a name that amazed him—Marquis Lanyue.

“Marquis Lanyue?”

Jian Wushuang carefully read her information. After a while, a meaningful smile grew on his face.

“That little girl has grown a lot over the last few years.”

On a magnificent mountain range stood a towering mansion, which was the residence of Marquis Lanyue, one of the 72 Marquises.

As a peerless genius, she had rapidly risen to become a marquis over the last few years.

It was said that Marquis Lanyue was just 30 years old. She had amazing talent when she was a child, but she had been afflicted by Witch Poison for several years. Ever since she had been detoxified, her talent had started to recover and she had improved at an unbelievable speed.

Currently, she had made a breakthrough from a Saint Realm expert to a famous marquis.

On the empty ground of this mansion, a cyan-dressed lady was practicing her swordsmanship alone.

She looked gorgeous, possessing both a heroic spirit and a sexy figure while radiating a peerless charm.

However, the sword moves she displayed were swift and powerful. Each sword shadow she launched was as fast as lightning and strong enough to kill an ordinary lord.

This cyan-dressed lady was Marquis Lanyue.

Shua!

The cold streak of sword light lashed out and pierced the air before her, causing Sword Essence Waves to spread out.

“Nice.”

A toneless voice came from nearby. Marquis Lanyue was a bit surprised as she looked over at the source.

When she saw the black-robed youth with a longsword on his back staring at her, her pretty eyes suddenly bulged wide. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Master?!” Marquis Lanyue cried out, looking surprised and delighted.

“You’ve already become a marquis, but you still remember me?” Jian Wushuang replied with a faint smile.

Marquis Lanyue quickly walked over.

“Master, I pay my respects to you.” Marquis Lanyue knelt down and bowed to her master with respect.

She was Lin Lan. Jian Wushuang had accepted her as his disciple right after arriving at the Divine Land.

At that time, Jian Wushuang had used the Heavenly Creation Skill to refined her Witch Poison, allowing Lin Lan the ability to start a new life.

Then, he had helped Lin Lan break off the engagement with the Luo family.

Those things were engraved in her mind. Although she was a marquis and had a high status in the Divine Land, she had never forgotten her Master who had helped her so much.

After all, her master changed her fate.

“Get up.” Jian Wushang gestured to his disciple before Lin Lan stood up.

“When I left, you had just barely made it to the Saint Realm, but now you’ve reached this level during the last few years. It’s brilliant.” Jian Wushuang acclaimed.

He marveled at his disciple’s achievement.

Lin Lan responded with modesty, “All my achievements are because of you, master.”

“I just helped you clear the Witch Poison. As for what you’ve achieved, it’s because of your own ability. It’s none of my business.” Jian Wushuang shook his head and continued, “I’ve seen you practicing your swordsmanship. You’re good.”

“Master, thanks for your compliments. That swordsmanship...” Lin Lan had not finished her words yet.

“Little Lan!” A cry was heard, then a red-haired man slowly walked over.

“Dear, come here.”

Lin Lan instantly went to pull her husband toward her master.

“Dear, this is my master, the one I’ve mentioned a lot to you!”
