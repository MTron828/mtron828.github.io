Chapter 234: I Will Help You

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but be surprised.

Back then he led many Golden Dragon Ambassadors to attack the Nine Emperors Sect, wounding it heavily. It had not even been a year; it was impossible that the Nine Emperors Sect recovered now.

Even as the Nine Emperors Sect knew of the Ouyang clan’s support for the Pavilion of Raindrops, they still had the guts to claim that they would destroy it within three days ... If it was not for the Blood Feather Tower’s involvement, the Nine Emperors Sect would not be so daring themselves.

Tang Wuji said in a low voice, “Initially, we were not bothered that the Nine Emperors Sect were about to attack. As our pavilion had the backing of the Ouyang clan, there was nothing to worry about. But we did not expect that just when the Nine Emperors Sect announced their plan to attack, the Ouyang clan receded their support.

“The Ouyang clan said that unless my Pavilion of Raindrops merges with their Dark Hall, they would not help us block the Nine Emperors Sect’s attack.

“They may say it is a merger, but they actually meant to swallow my Pavilion of Raindrops as a whole.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. “Then what do you plan to do now?”

“We will play by ear. Regardless of what happens, I will never agree to the conditions raised by the Ouyang clan.”

“Pavilion Master...” A Guest by the side furrowed his eyebrows.

“I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head slightly and looked at Tang Wuji with a smile. “Tang Wuji, you don’t have to worry about the Ouyang clan. The might of the Nine Emperors Sect cannot be underestimated. Even if the Ouyang clan were to turn up, there is still a chance that they cannot stop them.”

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang winced.

“But don’t worry. I happen to have a bit of a grudge against the Nine Emperors Sect and I wish to seek revenge, so I will help you,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Boss, you will help me?” Tang Wuji rejoiced.

Back then during the Easternmost Hunting, Tang Wuji could attest to the strength of Jian Wushuang. In addition, his Pavilion of Raindrops’ successful reconstruction was also due to his relationship with Jian Wushuang, so Tang Wuji had absolute faith in Jian Wushuang.

“Rest assured that with my help, that Nine Emperors Sect would definitely be unable to snatch your Pavilion of Raindrops away from you,” Jian Wushuang said with a confident laughter.

Just when he finished speaking, the Guests at the side were immediately dissatisfied.

Thud!

“Oh, what an arrogant tone!”

A black-clothed elder smacked the table, stood up, glared at Jian Wushuang and said in a low tone, “Kid, although I don’t know what your relationship with our Pavilion Master is but what you’ve just made clear is as good as sending the Pavilion of Raindrops to death!

“With your young age, how can you understand the power of the Nine Emperors Sect?

“Forget the others. If we only talk about the experts of the Yin Void Realm, the Nine Emperors Sect will have less than five people. In addition, their Upper Elder recently surpassed their level and attained the Yang Void Realm!

“Such tyrannical strength is enough to sweep the Pavilion of Raindrops away.

“At this moment of life and death, what my Pavilion of Raindrops needs to do is to craft ways to secure the Ouyang clan’s support again. It is only with the Ouyang clan’s support that we can promise safety and peace for the Pavilion of Raindrops!

“Although the Ouyang clan’s condition is slightly harsh, merging with their Dark Hall, in my opinion, is not necessarily a bad thing!

“Now you dare to advise the Pavilion Master to abandon the Ouyang clan and completely believe in you?

“You’re just an insignificant fellow. How can you be capable enough and boldly say that the Nine Emperors Sect will not conquer the Pavilion of Raindrops? What a joke, what a...”

Before the black-clothed elder could finish speaking, Jian Wushuang who sat peacefully at the side raised his head suddenly.

The moment he looked up... Rumble! Slaughter Origin exploded and a fearful killing intent swept out.

Immediately, the entire secret chamber became dead silent.

Not only was it dead silent, but the atmosphere was as chilly as winter.

The black-clothed elder at this moment stopped speaking. He widened eyes and stared at Jian Wushuang in shock.

It was not only him; the other Guests at the Pavilion of Raindrops were also gazing at Jian Wushuang with an extremely frightened expression.

Jian Wushuang had comprehended Slaughter Origin, the way of killing, so his killing intent?was quite strong and frightening.

Although the Guests were all Yin Void experts, they were only in the Initial Yin Void Realm. With the explosion of Jian Wushuang’s killing intent, they immediately felt suffocated, as if there was a sword pointing at their throats.

The black-clothed elder felt a swelling in his throat. The words that have reached his mouth were swallowed back at this moment.

Horror, fear!

Everyone’s gaze was fixed on Jian Wushuang.

Just faced with the outburst of killing intent, they all felt genuine fear in their hearts. If this black-clothed young man were to really fight, then what would happen?

“Boss...” Tang Wuji looked at Jian Wushuang in shock.

Jian Wushuang still held his bowl of wine and swirled the wine gently. The explosive killing intent slowly withdrew.

“Someone has come,” Jian Wushuang said peacefully.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang winced.

The doors of the secret chamber suddenly opened. A man wearing a luxurious robe walked in with a big smile.

“Mr. Ouyang.”

“Mr. Ouyang.”

Once the Guests in the Pavilion of Raindrops saw this middle-aged man, they immediately greeted him humbly.

“Pavilion Master Tang, how is your consideration process coming along?”

The middle-aged man did not bother with the Guests. After entering the secret chamber, he went and sat down on a chair, showing signs of familiarity. Tang Wuji smiled and looked at him.

“Mr. Ouyang, my word still remains. If you want my Pavilion of Raindrops to submit to your Ouyang clan, that isn’t a problem at all. But if you want my Pavilion of Raindrops to merge with the Ouyang clan’s Dark Hall, then that is impossible,” Tang Wuji said coldly. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The middle-aged man’s grin immediately fell after hearing Tang Wuji’s words. “Tang Wuji, I take you as Pavilion Master, so I just call you Master Tang. But you don’t cherish the chance. Submitting to our clan? Huh! My Ouyang clan is one of Tianzong Dynasty’s seven sects. Even the most powerful sect would compete to submit to us. With our powerful status, do we even need your pavilion?

“To tell the truth, my clan’s initial support for your pavilion was because we affirmed your pavilion’s intelligence capabilities. Without our clan, you think with your own measly muscles, your Pavilion of Raindrops could be so successful within the short span of six months?

“Listen, you’d better obediently merge your pavilion with the Dark Hall. Then you will have a chance to live. If not...”

Tang Wuji had an uneasy expression.

Jian Wushuang who stood by the side began to laugh. “Haha, the Ouyang clan, one of the seven sects in the Tianzong Dynasty, takes advantage of others’ precarious situation?”

The middle-aged man cast a cold glance at Jian Wushuang.

“Where did you come from, kid?! I was speaking to Tang Wuji, how dare you interrupt!”

“Get out of my way!”

As he finished speaking, the middle-aged man waved his hand, a gust of spiritual power gathering in his palms. Then he directly struck a blow to Jian Wushuang.

This middle-aged man had a cultivation of the Profound Yin Void Realm. Under his attack, even a man like Tang Wuji, who was in the Exceptional Gold Core Realm, would have died.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang still held his bowl of wine but his gaze became cold.
