2014 Let Me Deal With Them

Just as Jian Wushuang and the purple-haired man were fighting, Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zhi Luo, Emperor Jiu Qiao were fighting with their opponents as well.

None of them were exceptions. They all had the lower hand.

Especially Great Emperor Zhi Luo. She was against the old lady in a red robe. Her opponent used a crimson spear and the bloody aura filled the universe and her fighting power was amazingly terrifying. To begin with, Great Emperor Zhi Luo wasn’t her match, but Great Emperor Zhi Luo had to divert her energy to create a chance to flee during the fight. Hence, she was naturally in more trouble.

Just then, the beast-like bald man who stood in the void behind him finally took action.

Hong!

He took one stride and his originally terrifying rage suddenly increased tremendously!

The terrifying rage burst out and made Jian Wushuang’s face changed.

“This person!” Jian Wushuang immediately looked at the bald man.

He felt great pressure from the bald man. Besides Emperor Bai and Emperor Thirteen, no one else in Eternal Chaotic World could give him such pressure. Even Red Dragon King and Abysmal Saint Master, who were in the second and third place on Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, wouldn’t cause such pressure to Jian Wushuang.

There was no doubt that the bald man was very powerful.

As he plunged forward, he moved towards Emperor Jiu Qiao, who was the closest to him.

Vroom!

There was a flash of light and the bald man appeared next to Emperor Jiu Qiao. He suddenly raised his battle-axe.

“Jiu Qiao, be careful!!!” Jian Wushuang roared.

“What?” Emperor Jiu Qiao’s face changed. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He wasn’t considered strong. He was weak among Great Emperors. The person who he was fighting with shouldn’t be weaker than Great Emperor Colored Glaze. He definitely had the lower hand when he fought with his opponent. Then, the bald man suddenly interrupted the battle.

Wow!

An axe shadow suddenly descended.

The axe shadow was black without any sound.

Such an axe shadow contained boundless extermination power.

Jian Wushuang stared at the bald man and watched the axe stroke that the bald man performed clearly.

It was as though he saw all living things in the boundless territories vanish into thin air under the axe. It was a scene of destruction.

The axe represented extermination.

The axe shadow slammed down. Although Emperor Jiu Qiao was shocked, he moved the stone rod and blocked the axe shadow.

There was a loud bang. The stone rod flew off from Emperor Jiu Qiao’s hand while the axe shadow continued to hit Emperor Jiu Qiao’s body.

Pfft!

Emperor Jiu Qiao spurted a mouthful of blood. His face instantly grew pale and his body started falling.

With one axe stroke, Emperor God Jiu Qiao, who was a Great Emperor, was severely injured.

“Die!”

But the beast-like bald man took another stride forward and slashed his black battle-axe once again.

It was the same battle-axe that contained boundless power and could destroy everything.

Emperor God Jiu Qiao was already falling uncontrollably and his divine weapon had already flown off from the hit. When the battle-axe slashed at him, he had no power to resist.

However, right before Emperor God Jiu Qiao was going to drown by the battleaxe.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang appeared before Emperor Jiu Qiao.

Jian Wushuang was the closest to the battlefield that Emperor Jiu Qiao was at. Different from Abysmal Saint Master and Great Emperor Zhi Luo, they were suppressed by their opponents and they couldn’t free themselves from their battle. However, Jian Wushuang could fight his opponent. Hence, he immediately moved as he noticed Emperor God Jiu Qiao was in danger.

Although he didn’t manage to help at the first stroke.

Jian Wushuang caught up when the second stroke descended.

Then, Jian Wushuang held his swords in both hands and wielded them against the extermination axe shadow that was descending.

“You are courting death!”

The beast-like bald man roared and the power of the battle-axe in his hand increased again.

Bang!

Jian Wushuang sank from the hit but he didn’t spit any blood and he stopped very quickly.

“He blocked it?” The bald man was surprised.

“Emperor Jiu Qiao, hurry up and run!”

Jian Wushuang steadied himself and let out a bellow. Then, his figure suddenly retreated to the back as well.

Emperor Jiu Qiao, of course, didn’t dare to hesitate anymore.

To one side, Abysmal Saint Master and Great Emperor Zhi Luo retreated at the same time.

The four of them had lost their intention to fight.

They had no choice. If there were only the five Great Emperors, the four of them could deal with them. But as the beast-like bald man joined the battle…

The bald man was too powerful. He had injured Emperor Jiu Qiao with one attack and if Jian Wushuang hadn’t gotten there in time earlier, Emperor Jiu Qiao would have been killed by the second stroke. With such a powerful fighting power joining their battles, the four of them wouldn’t be able to last.

However, the golden formation that covered the surrounding void was a huge problem if they wanted to flee.

“Zhi Luo, are you not ready yet?” Abysmal Saint Master asked.

“Already connected to the spacetime in the outside world. However, I will need some time to set up a spacetime tunnel,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo said solemnly.

“How long do you need?” Jian Wushuang looked at her.

“Ten breaths, at least ten breaths!!! This is presuming no one bothers me. Then, I could set it up. I had no time to set it up when I was fighting with the Great Emperor earlier,” Great Emperor Zhi Luo said.

Ten breaths. If it was not a normal time, it was naturally short. When one’s power reaches their level, ten breaths were enough to fight for a very long time.

Jian Wushuang took a look at the six Great Emperors behind and his eyes dilated.

With the great formation around them, it was impossible for them to escape. The only chance was to let Great Emperor Zhi Luo set up a spacetime tunnel.

Jian Wushuang made up his mind.

“Abysmal Saint Master, Emperor Jiu Qiao, the two of you help Great Emperor Zhi Luo to set up the spacetime tunnel. As for the six Great Emperors, let me deal with them!!!”

Jian Wushuang said and turned to charge at the six Great Emperors.

“What?”

“Jian Wushuang, you?”

Abysmal Saint Master, Great Emperor Zhi Luo and Emperor Jiu Qiao were stunned.

The three of them set up the spacetime tunnel while Jian Wushuang would block the six Great Emperors alone?

How could he stop them?

“Is he going to use the secret skill of Star Palace?” Abysmal Saint Master thought.

From their point of view, Jian Wushuang would only have the power to deal with six Great Emperors at the same time if he used that trump card. However, not only was Jian Wushuang’s secret skill of Star palace his trump card, it was also a huge trump card for their expert troop.

They had just entered Three-Emperors World and he was going to use up the trump card?
