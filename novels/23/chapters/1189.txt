Chapter 1190: Utter Defeat!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“How could this happen?”

The Heaven Illusion King’s eyes were wide open and her body trembled slightly.

The Golden Rock King was killed right in front of her, but she did not even notice who was the assailant.

Suddenly, hum!

A cold sword light formed again, and this time it came straight for her.

The instant she saw the sword light, she also noticed clearly who her opponent was.

He was a young man in a blood-red robe, and his looks were extremely familiar to her.

“Shouldn’t this person already have been killed 1,800 years ago?

“How did he appear here again?”

“Impossible.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Impossible!!!”

“Jian Wushuang, how could it be you?”

She gave off a shrill cry, and even though she was shaken up, she had no plans to die as her comrade did. An exquisite aquamarine pagoda appeared behind her, and her eyes began to give off a strange glow.

It could charm.

“Ridiculous!”

The Heaven Illusion King was most skilled in Illusion Skills and they could be classified as consciousness attacks. That said, however, her attacks were but a joke to Jian Wushuang, who had already lit up his Soul Fire.

Jian Wushuang’s figure was unimpeded by the attack and appeared before the Heaven Illusion King, appearing to have not been hindered by it.

“Now’s my turn,” he said coldly.

He then unleashed the sword move that he had prepared.

“Spell of Disturbance!”

A strong gust of wind shot toward the Heaven Illusion King.

A sword shadow was in the gust of wind. It grew into the size of a storm, entirely engulfing the Heaven Illusion King.

Before Jian Wushuang had even unleashed his swordsmanship, a fearsome Soul Attack was already upon the Heaven Illusion King.

She was caught surprised, leading to her consciousness being disrupted for a short while. Even though the pause was negligible, her actions were now a little slower and she was helpless to fend off Jian Wushuang’s move.

As the Sword Essence Storm raged on, the Heaven Illusion King’s corpse was left behind.

A second Universe Master was killed!

“What?”

“Golden Rock King, Heaven Illusion King, this, this…”

“It’s him! Both kings were killed by him!”

Everyone at the scene witnessed the deaths of the two Universe Masters, and naturally, all color had left the experts from the Jin Kingdom.

The two deceased kings were considered as stronger amongst the Universe Masters of the Jin Kingdom, yet they were killed in an instant.

Furthermore, they did not even have time to react.

How strong was their assailant?

“Jian Wushuang!”

The Red Snow King stared at Jian Wushuang, a hint of disbelief in his voice.

“Jian Wushuang?”

“He’s the Jian Wushuang?”

“Wasn’t he supposed to be dead? How is he still alive? Even if he’s alive, how did he manage to increase his strength by this much?”

Angry and shocked voices rang out.

The experts of the Jin Kingdom were indeed extremely shocked.

1,800 years ago, the Red Snow, Golden Rock, Heaven Illusion and Heaven Shadow Kings had combined forces to assassinate Jian Wushuang.

They paid a heavy price for it, and the Heaven Shadow King even lost his life, but they had at least accomplished their goal.

Jian Wushuang was indeed struck dead that time.

But if he was, how could he be appearing before them now? So who was this young man in the blood-red robes who had cut down two of their Universe Masters so quickly?

“Ba*tard! To think you’re still alive!” growled the Red Snow King, an unprecedented level of rage in his eyes.

“I’m sorry to have disappointed you,” replied Jian Wushuang with a cold smile.

The Red Snow King was shaken.

He had personally seen Jian Wushuang enter Chillywind Valley and smashed to bits by the Blood Coldwind. Logically, he should have remained dead, but here he was all in one piece.

Moreover, his strength had obviously increased greatly over such a short span of time.

The other Green Fire Palace Masters were feeling completely assured, the exact opposite of their opponents.

“Haha, good one, Jian Wushuang!”

“Well done.”

“Humph. Now that two of the Jin Kingdom’s Universe Masters have been killed, I want to see what they can come up with next!”

“Kill!” the Samsara Temple Master roared.

His eyes were red and he gave off a terrible killing intent as he attacked again.

“Kill!”

“Kill them all!”

The other Palace Masters, Jian Wushuang included, were on a rampage and they began slaughtering the enemy experts.

Before Jian Wushuang struck, the Jin Kingdom experts could still somewhat manage to fend off the attacks of the Palace Masters, even though they were at the losing end of the battle. Now, however, things were largely different after the death of two of their Universe Masters and the entry of Jian Wushuang into the battle.

“Die!” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

He appeared phantom-like before another Universe Master of the Jin Kingdom and engulfed him with another Sword Essence Storm.

“That’s not good!”

The expressions of a few other Universe Masters of the Jin Kingdom changed drastically. Just moments ago, they had personally witnessed the Heaven Illusion King being killed by the same move.

Now, it was this Universe Master’s turn…

Psssh! Psssh! Psssh!

Sword lights flew out one after the other, and the Universe Master, whose battle strength was comparable to the Golden Rock King, could only manage to fend off two blows while under Jian Wushuang’s Soul Attack. The third blow pierced through his throat.

At the moment, Jian Wushuang had already cut down three Universe Masters.

“Damn!”

“That boy…”

“Those were Universe Masters, yet he could kill them almost instantly?”

“Too strong, he’s too strong!”

“Run, run!”

The experts from the Jin Kingdom were utterly defeated!

They were crumbling.

The few kings that were still alive were all scared listless as they saw how easily Jian Wushuang cut down their comrades. None of them dared to continue fighting.

He had really cut them down with unfathomable speed.

They died instantly, without being able to defend themselves at all.

It was even more frightening than the Samsara Temple Master’s attacks.

Even though the Temple Master was strong and could kill ordinary Universe Masters as well, even he could not do so in such a casual and quick fashion.

Jian Wushuang, on the other hand, was a Sword Cultivator and a Master Swordsman of Death. No Universe Master of an ordinary level could hope to withstand the extremely swift Spacetime Sword Principle and Soul Attack that he had created.

Slaughter!

At the moment, Jian Wushuang was slaughtering the enemy experts with abandon.

It did not matter what level they were, he showed no mercy and killed them all.

The other Palace Masters and Puppet Fighters also slaughtered their enemies mercilessly.

The battle was completely one-sided.
