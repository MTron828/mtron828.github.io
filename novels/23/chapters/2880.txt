Chapter 2881: Was Out!

——

Realm Lord Tian Qu and the others waited quietly outside the market.

They waited for five years.

Five years later, Jian Wushuang finally walked out of the secret chamber.

After coming out of seclusion, his realm had reached the Advanced Divine Master level, and his strength had soared.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang’s bottleneck in sword principle had loosened.

“Now I feel that half of my foot has stepped into the second Realm of Sword Principle. The gap between the two is probably only a window paper that can be broken with a poke,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Sword Principle World was only the first realm.

After the sword world was the boundless sword tree.

This level was already at the level of the Immortal Saint.

But now, Jian Wushuang had indeed sensed this level. The gap was just a window paper.

To break this window paper, he needed some external force, which was a great battle!

“Right now, I really need a great battle so that I can fully display my understanding of sword principle. Only then can I have a chance to break through this bottleneck.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands.

Right now, he yearned for a great battle!

Moreover, the stronger the opponent, the better. At the very least, it would bring him great pressure and even pose a threat to him.

And such a great battle happened to be right in front of him.

“Although I have been in closed-door cultivation in this market for a full five years, given the hatred Realm Lord Tian Qu has for me, he definitely won’t care about this little bit of time. I’m afraid that he has been waiting for me outside the market for the past five years. As long as I go out, he will immediately take action. Moreover, he must have found other helpers.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, there was a hint of excitement in his eyes.

Realm Lord Tian Qu was a real Immortal Saint, and he was extremely powerful among them.

Jian Wushuang knew that he was no match for him last time, so he used his domain to escape.

But now, Jian Wushuang was eager to have a face-to-face fight with Realm Lord Tian Qu.

“Realm Lord Tian Qu, I hope you won’t disappoint me this time!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled and he immediately walked out of the market.

In the vast void outside the market.

“Jian Yi has come out of seclusion and is walking out of the market,” Elder Su said.

“He’s finally out?” Realm Master Tian Qu and Heavenly Void Temple Master were delighted.

“Heavenly Void Temple Master, have you prepared your restriction?” Realm Master Tian Qu asked.

“Don’t worry, I’ve prepared it long ago.” Temple Master Tian Qu said with a smile.

“That’s good. With your restriction and Elder Su’s domain-type treasure, the sword won’t be able to escape this time.” A cold light flashed in his eyes.

At this moment, Jian Wushuang had already walked out of the market and left the area covered by the array.

As soon as he came out, Realm Master Tian Qu and the others who were waiting there immediately noticed him.

“Let’s do it!” World Master Tian Qu said in a low voice. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Next to him, the Heavenly Void Temple Master still had a gentle smile on his face. However, with a flip of his palm, a strange black bead was thrown out and merged with the surrounding void. In an instant… buzz!

A huge black restriction rose out of thin air. It was extremely huge and powerful. As soon as it appeared, it instantly covered the world.

Jian Wushuang had just come out of the market and had not walked far when he was immediately covered by the black restriction.

“Even the restriction is ready?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed, but there was a hint of a smile in his heart. He had already stopped moving.

“World Master Tian Qu, come out.” Jian Wushuang’s bright voice echoed throughout the world.

As soon as his voice fell, Realm Lord Tian Qu, who had been hiding in the surrounding void, appeared directly in front of Jian Wushuang.

Realm Lord Tian Qu’s face was cold and his body was filled with a murderous aura. He stared at Jian Wushuang and said, “Boy, we meet again. Judging from your appearance, you seem to have known that I would attack you outside the market.”

“Of course.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “I didn’t disguise myself in the market. With your ability, Realm Lord Tian Qu, wouldn’t it be easy for you to find me?”

“Humph, you know that I’m going to attack you, but you still dare to walk out of the market alone. How dare you!” Realm Lord Tian Qu said in a low voice.

“Realm Lord Tian Qu cut the crap. Show me whatever you have. I hope you are well prepared this time. Otherwise, you can only watch me leave like last time.” Jian Wushuang smiled. “If I’m not wrong, you must have hired other helpers this time. Ask them to come out.”

“You’re smart.” Realm Lord Tian Qu’s voice was cold.

At this time, two figures rushed over from the distant void and appeared beside Realm Lord Tian Qu.

At the same time, two powerful auras, which only Immortal Saints possessed, directly pressed toward Jian Wushuang.

“Two more Immortal Saints?” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened, and he immediately looked at the two.

“You are…” Jian Wushuang first looked at the middle-aged man who was wearing a purple robe and gave off an extremely warm and kind feeling.

He did not know this middle-aged man.

“You are Jian Yi?” The middle-aged man looked down at Jian Wushuang. Although his eyes were cold, he still had a gentle smile on his face. “I am the Heavenly Void Temple Master!”

“The Heavenly Void Temple Master!” Jian Wushuang was stunned for a moment, but then he understood.

Among the Immortal Saints in the Golden Crow Nine Realms, other than the World Master Tian Qu, the most likely Immortal Saint who had a reason to kill him was the Heavenly Void Temple Master.

The Heavenly Void Temple Master tried to occupy the Pill Sun Sacred World, but he was the one who turned the tables.

Now, because of his existence, the Heavenly Void Temple Master could do nothing to the Pill Sun Sacred World. However, if he died, not to mention the internal chaos of the Pill Sun Sacred World, the Heavenly Void Temple Master would then attack the Pill Sun Sacred World, he was much more confident.

Then, Jian Wushuang looked at the other person.

Jian Wushuang had seen that person before. It was the black-robed elder who had followed Chi Ming, the Young Master of the Star Point Pavilion.

“Someone from the Star Point Pavilion?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

He could understand that the Heavenly Void Temple Master wanted to attack him, but the Star Point Pavilion… Jian Wushuang knew that he had not offended the Star Point Pavilion.

He did not have any conflict of interest with the Star Point Pavilion. The only explanation was that it was because of Leng Rushuang, but it was not enough for an Immortal Saint to attack him personally.

Therefore, Jian Wushuang was somewhat surprised by the appearance of the black-robed elder.

Although he was surprised, Jian Wushuang did not show much fear.

“Hehe, to kill me, a mere Divine Master, three Immortal Saints came together. You really think highly of me.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.
