Chapter 2316 Eliminating Early

After a quick look through the contents of the jade bamboo strip, the demoralized and defeated Zhuge Hong jumped up abruptly.“It’s him! It’s him!”

“No wonder he could defeat me so easily. So he’s that Jian Wushuang!” Zhuge Hong clenched his fist tightly and his body shivered with anger.

The contents on the jade bamboo strip were undoubtedly the identity and origins of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s identity wasn’t a secret in Lin Mansion. The Zhuge Family and Lin Family had been competing for many years. It was only natural they had some spies in the Lin Mansion. All they needed was to mobilize them a little to find out.

Zhuge Hong also understood Jian Wushuang wasn’t just some sword boy of Lin Mansion but the famous unparalleled talent in Sword Principle in Anjiu Prefecture.

Zhuge Hong finally felt enlightened.

At the same time, the defeated looks had vanished completely.

For him, if he lost so utterly to an ordinary sword boy, the blow would undoubtedly be huge. In fact, he might not ever recover from the mental devastation.

However, if he was defeated by an exceptional talent, there would be nothing to feel down about.

Jian Wushuang was undoubtedly an exceptional talent.

“When I first came to Anjiu Prefecture, I heard about Jian Wushuang as well. All along, I wasn’t concerned about it and thought that the others were just exaggerating things. Now, it would appear that he is indeed extraordinary to be able to break your terrestrial treasure sabre with his finger when both of you are at the same cultivation base. His understanding of Sword Principle might have reached the level of Great Achievement. In Anjiu Prefecture, it is unlikely that there will be anyone who is a match in this aspect. Even the previous family head of Zhuge Family, Zhuge Yun, wouldn’t be,” said the grey-robed old man.

“That is to be expected. Jian Wushuang had his name given personally by Taoist Priest Xuan Shen,” answered Zhuge Hong.

“Taoist Priest Xuan Shen?” the grey-robed old man was baffled.

“Elder Chen, you have always been in Dongzuo Sect and just arrived in Anjiu Prefecture. It’s expected that you aren’t aware of Taoist Priest Xuan Shen. However, he was extremely famous in Anjiu Prefecture in recent years. He’s a mysterious expert with unimaginable abilities.

Although I have not seen him, I have heard about him. My father and many experts in the Zhuge Family have the utmost respect for Taoist Priest Xuan Shen. In fact, even the strongest man in Anjiu Prefecture, the Commandery Governor, is reverent and respectful before him.”

“In fact, some even said the Commandery Governor wishes to follow Taoist Priest Xuan Shen, even if it was to be a servant. It is just that Taoist Priest Xuan Shen has rejected him,” said Zhuge Hong.

“Oh?” the grey-robed old man was astounded upon hearing Zhuge Hong.

He knew about the Commandery Governor of Anjiu Prefecture and he was rather well-known in the Wusha Barren Region.

That was an elite Divine Demon and much stronger than him. In Dongzuo Sect, those who could possibly match up to him could be counted with a single hand.

An elite Divine Demon like him would willingly be a servant to Taoist Priest Xuan Shen?

From this, it was easy to tell how amazing the Taoist Priest Xuan Shen was.

“Taoist Priest Xuan Shen is a man of great capabilities and might be an elite in the Absolute Beginning Divine World, and yet he visited Jian Wushuang’s family and gave Jian Wushuang his name personally. There’s no way Jian Wushuang would be a pushover. There’s nothing to feel bad about in losing to him,” remarked Zhuge Hong.

“It’s great that you are able to get over it.” Elder Chen finally heaved a sigh of relief.

Previously, he had been worried that Zhuge Hong would never get back up on his feet. If that was the case, he wouldn’t be able to explain it to Zhuge Hong’s master when they returned to Dongzuo Sect. Now, this wouldn’t be necessary.

“Get over it?” Zhuge Hong snorted. “I have to admit my talents aren’t as great as his. However, this doesn’t mean I will let him trample over me. He humiliated me before the watchful eyes of the crowd and foiled our Zhuge Family’s plan. There’s no way I will let him off easily!”

“Moreover, his father is the Governor of Incineration Moon City. From what I know, Zhuo Yunfeng and the family head of Lin Mansion, Lin Tiefeng, are brothers of life and death. They are extremely close. Once our Zhuge Family start a war with the Lin Family, Zhuo Yunfeng will definitely extend the greatest help he can. As for Jian Wushuang, he will definitely become an enemy to our Zhuge Family.”

“An enemy who is widely deemed to be unparalleled in Sword Principle and has exceptional talents should be removed as soon as possible!”

Elder Chen nodded his head and agreed.

From what he had displayed earlier in the day, Jian Wushuang’s potential was unquestionable.

Even a talent like Zhuge Hong was several levels below him.

For a super talent like him, it would be best to form good relationships with him. However, if he was on the opposing side, it would be best to eliminate him before he fully grew up.

“Didn’t our intel say that Jian Wushuang would be leaving Lin Mansion for Incineration Moon City tomorrow? That would be the opportunity!” said Zhuge Hong.

“Could it be you are thinking of intercepting and killing him on his way back to Incineration Moon City?” Elder Chen looked over.

“Can’t we do that?”

“That’s plausible. However, I couldn’t do it personally. Now that we have stirred up a storm in Lin Mansion, the Lin Family will definitely be able to tell. Moreover, despite the fact that we have left Lin Mansion, we are still in the vicinity. The Lin Mansion has definitely dispatched experts to watch us in the dark. All our actions will likely be seen by their eyes. Therefore, if we want to make a move, we can only arrange for other experts to do it,” Elder Chen analyzed.

“This won’t be an issue. Zhuge Family still has some experts that we can mobilize within our territory. I will send my family head a message now to dispatch a batch of experts immediately. After all, there will only be a Peak Chaotic Realm escorting Jian Wushuang back to Incineration Moon City. It would still be easy to kill him with just this level of protection.”

Soon, Zhuge Hong sent a message to the family head of Zhuge Family.

When the family head of Zhuge Family received the message, he could sense the immense potential of Jian Wushuang as well. Similar to Zhuge Hong, he would want to eliminate this threat as soon as possible.

Therefore, he started preparing immediately. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The next morning.

Jian Wushuang was ready to move on from the Lin Mansion.

“Brother Wushuang, I’ll go look for you in Incineration Moon City soon,” Lin Yan said.

“Haha! That’s not necessary. Most likely, I’ll be in Lin Mansion before you know it,” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

He was speaking the truth. Since he had deciphered almost all the secret skills and secret manuals in Lin Mansion, there was nothing left that he would miss about this place.

However, Lin Family would have a battle with the Zhuge Family soon. His father would definitely extend a helping hand then. It would be obvious that Jian Wushuang would follow along.

“Great. I wish you a pleasant journey,” Lin Yan remarked.

After waving goodbye, Jian Wushuang and Lin Yi headed towards Incineration Moon City under the eyes of numerous Lin Mansion’s experts.
