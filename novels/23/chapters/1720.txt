Chapter 1721: An Almighty’s Anger

“Next, I will bring you out of the Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu. Don’t resist.”

As Jian Wushuang looked at He Xiu who was in front of him, with a thought, his Blood Mountain Sword came out of the scabbard and changed into a lofty mountain instantly.

The lofty mountain was filled with special secret patterns and they covered He Xiu straight away.

He Xiu remained silent. He did not resist and allowed Jian Wushuang to put him in the Blood Mountain Sword.

After finishing that, Jian Wushuang’s eyes looked around the surroundings.

Around him, there were countless experts from sixteen other Holy Kingdoms. Among them there were unordinary Real Gods as well as Chaotic Real Gods. However, when those experts sensed Jian Wushuang’s gaze, all of them revealed a fearful expression. Although they knew that the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas had already fallen into Jian Wushuang’s hands, no one dared to harbor any greedy thoughts.

What a joke. Previously, the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu himself had already made them so fearful that all of them did not dare to attack.

As for Jian Wushuang, who stood in front of them, he was a super existence who had killed the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu with just a swing of his hands.

“Seems like this is it.”

All of a sudden, a deep voice could be heard. After that, a vast amount of dense fog started to gather at the center of the void and an aquiline-nosed old man was revealed in the end.

When the old man appeared, he did not release any aura. However, he still caused many Real Gods who were present to shiver in fear. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Lord Liu Yin!”

“Greetings to Lord Liu Yin!”

Many Real God experts present greeted the approaching person in succession. All of them were filled with respect and admiration.

Sir God Liu Yin was the real ruler of the sixteen surrounding Holy Kingdoms, as well as the Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu.

Although the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu was the leader of the Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu on the surface, in actual fact, with just a word from Sir God Liu Xin, he would give up his position of King without hesitation.

For the fight this time around, even though many experts from the sixteen Holy Kingdoms had participated in it, all of them knew that no matter who obtained the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas in the end, they would be presented to Sir God Liu Yin.

Sir God Liu Yin swept his eyes past everyone around him and his bleary eyes locked onto Jian Wushuang. “You are called Sword Emperor, right? Your abilities are not too bad. My Qian Kun Ring has a thousand Doctrine Gems and some other treasures. They shall be considered your reward.”

Sir God Liu Yin took out a Qian Kun Ring and tossed it toward Jian Wushuang, “Also, since the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu has already died, a Holy Kingdom cannot be missing a King. If you are willing to, you can become the King of this Holy Kingdom right away.”

Upon hearing Sir God Liu Yin’s words, many experts present were shocked.

“That’s Lord Liu Yin’s reward!”

“A total of one thousand Doctrine Gems as well as many treasures. In addition, he can also become the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu straight away. Oh my gosh!”

“Lord Liu Yin is indeed an Almighty as he is really generous. However, it’s a pity that the rewards have been obtained by the Sword Emperor.”

Countless gazes gathered on Jian Wushuang and they were filled with envy.

They were indeed envious of Jian Wushuang.

From their point of view, Sir God Liu Yin’s reward was too great.

For example, even Di Lei’s eyes were looking at Jian Wushuang and filled with enviousness. However, there was nothing that he could do.

This reward was given to Jian Wushuang by Sir God Liu Yin and none of them had the right to get it.

However, upon seeing the Qian Kun Ring that Sir God Liu Yin had tossed over, Jian Wushuang did not extend his hand to catch it.

He then glanced at Sir God Liu Yin and laughed indifferently: “I’m sorry. I’m not interested in your reward. The only thing that I am interested in is the nine Taiqing Ancient Panaceas.”

The void, which was originally lively, became quiet instantly.

At that moment, the countless gazes, which were originally filled with envy, filled with astonishment.

He did not want the reward?

He was only interested in the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas?

“What is he trying to do?” Di Lei opened his eyes wide, “Could it be that his ultimate objective of getting the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas is not to get the reward of Lord Liu Yin?”

Sir God Liu Yin’s eyes turned grave and he shot a glance at Jian Wushuang. “Little kid, do you know what you are saying?”

“Of course I know. I said that I am only interested in the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas. Since they have already landed in my hands, I will not give them away again. Hence, I will naturally not give them to you. In addition, there is another point. In the Eternal Chaotic World, there are not many people who have the right to call me little kid. At the very least, you, Sir God Liu Yin, do not have the right to do so,” Jian Wushuang sneered.

What a joke. At that time, he possessed the fighting capabilities of a Sir God and he was at the same level as Sir God Liu Yin.

Since their abilities were similar, they should be talking on equal grounds.

Little kid?

That was the way an elder would address a junior, or the way a strong person would address a weak person.

“What great courage. Within the sixteen Holy Kingdoms, you are the first person who dares to provoke me,” Sir God Liu Yin was not furious. However, murderous intent flashed in his eyes, which were looking at Jian Wushuang.

Boom!

The universe shook. The void in front of Sir God Liu Yin changed into waves that looked like a sea of Divine Power immediately and headed toward Jian Wushuang.

In the places that the waves passed by, the voids were all torn into pieces.

Such a scene caused many experts present to reveal a fearful expression.

All of them knew that Sir God Liu Yin had attacked.

An Almighty was furious!

As for his way of attacking… he did not use any techniques. He merely unleashed a sea of Divine Power with a thought. However, as the sea of Divine Power could destroy everything in the universe, the power that it contained caused everyone present to feel hopeless.

“An Almighty. These are the abilities of an Almighty!” some people present could not help but gasp in admiration and roar furiously.

Di Lei also clenched both his fists tightly and his eyes were filled with shock.

To them, an Almighty was a legendary existence, as well as an omnipotent god.

There was only one kind of ending for someone who offended an Almighty, and that was death.

The Sword Emperor was finished.

However, upon seeing the sea of Divine Power heading over to him, Jian Wushuang placed both his hands behind his hand and did not move in the slightest. Moreover, he also wore an indifferent smile.

“Break!”

He merely uttered a word softly. However, it was like a clap of thunder that resounded across the whole universe.

The sea of Divine Power which was heading over seemed to be cut open by a sharp cutting edge and it was split into two halves. In addition, the infinite amount of Divine Power of the sea of Divine Power also spread in all directions madly. However, none of it spread to Jian Wushuang.

“This…” Many experts around the area were extremely shocked.

It was an attack by Sir God Liu Yin. However, in the end, Jian Wushuang did not make any movements like before and he dispersed the attack by merely uttering a word softly.

What kind of ability was that?

“Eh?” Sir God Liu Yin’s eyes squinted and his expression turned grave.

“Even though you are merely an Eternal God, your Divine Power is not inferior to mine. If my guess is not wrong, you should be Jian Wushuang,” Sir God Liu Yin stared at Jian Wushuang and his voice could be heard.

“Sir God Liu Yin, you took so long to recognize me. Your judgement is not really good,” Jian Wushuang laughed.
