Chapter 1920: Great Emperor’s Arrival

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

The boundless darkness swept across.

Everything was engulfed in total darkness. The darkness seemed to have existed since ancient times.

The experts from the two alliances, who were originally running in madness, the guest elders and Dao soldiers from Lineage of Star, involuntarily stopped.

All of them looked at the source of the darkness. At the core of the boundless darkness, there was a figure in black robe.

Everyone was attracted by the figure in the black robe.

At that moment, the figure in the black robe was the ruler of the boundless darkness.

“It’s Saint Master. Saint Master is here!!!”

Palace Master Wu Luo from Abysmal Palace and a few remaining experts from Abysmal Palace were thrilled with excitement when they saw the incomer.

“Abysmal Saint Master!!!” Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave.

Abysmal Saint Master had revealed his intention to kill Jian Wushuang long ago.

For instance, the reason why Abysmal Palace would fight with Lineage of Star had been instigated by Abysmal Saint Master.

Then, Abysmal Saint Master revealed himself.

On top of that, it wasn’t just Abysmal Saint Master’s consciousness embodiment, it was his original body!!!

Abysmal Saint Master came personally with his original body.

“Great Emperor visits personally?”

Everyone at the scene was dumbfounded.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and forced himself to calm down. Then, he said politely, “Jian Wushuang greets Abysmal Saint Master. I wonder why did Saint Master come to visit personally?”

Although Jian Wushuang knew his purpose for visiting, he couldn’t just flip at him after all.

Jian Wushuang didn’t want to give Abysmal Saint Master any excuse to attack either. He bowed as he should, he displayed reverence as he should.

“Jian Wushuang, do you know you are guilty?” Abysmal Saint Master was standing at the core of the darkness as a cold gaze burst out from the figure in black robe.

“Guilty?” Jian Wushuang was stunned and shook his head, “I don’t know.”

“Don’t know? You massacred wantonly previously. Many Sir Gods and Emperor Gods from Sanctuary Alliance died by your hands. However, as you have great potential and you are gifted, we of Sanctuary Alliance have been rather forgiving. We never thought that you would behave even more wildly. In today’s war, you killed over a hundred Almighties from Sanctuary Alliance!!”

“Over a hundred Almighties, you made Sanctuary Alliance suffer such a great loss and you dare say you don’t know your wrongdoing?”

“Today, I will punish you on behalf of Sanctuary Alliance!” Abysmal Saint Master’s cold voice reverberated in the dark universe.

His speech was tainted with undoubted dignity.

Especially the part where he said he would punish him struck fear in the surrounding experts.

“Punish?”

“Abysmal Saint Master wants to punish Jian Wushuang?”

There were many experts that were stunned. Some were shocked and some were excited.

Especially the experts from the two alliance, they were instantly filled with happiness. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

With the terrifying stroke earlier, Jian Wushuang had wiped out over a hundred Almighties from Almighties Alliance.

The terrifying scene continued to replay in the experts’ head and couldn’t be pushed aside.

In their hearts, Jian Wushuang had already become a demon. He had already become true Death, a terrifying existence.

They were terrified by Jian Wushuang’s power. With Jian Wushuang was around, their pride and courage as an Almighty was nowhere to be seen.

The two alliances’ defeats derived from it as well.

But then, Abysmal Saint Master wanted to punish the demon, the supreme Death. How could they not feel excited? How could they not find it comforting?

The experts from Lineage of Star were naturally angry.

Suddenly… Vroom. There was a boundless aura that slowly soared.

Everyone immediately looked and saw Qian Mingzi gripping a token tight. He had already smashed the token into pieces.

Only Jian Wushuang knew Qian Mingzi’s true identity, Purple Moon Emperor’s servant.

The token that Qian Mingzi had smashed was naturally Purple Moon Emperor’s.

As expected, the moment the token was smashed, a consciousness embodiment substantiated in the universe.

His purple hair and cold, evil-looking face with a faint smile was simply enchanting.

“Purple Moon Emperor!”

“It’s Purple Moon Emperor!”

“Purple Moon Emperor’s consciousness embodiment has descended too.”

The experts at the scene exclaimed again.

Abysmal Saint Master, who was like the ruler of darkness, looked, “Purple Moon, what are you doing here?”

“Abysmal Saint Master, this belongs to Purple Moon Sanctuary. As you can visit, why can’t I, the owner of Purple Moon Sanctuary, be here too?” Purple Moon Emperor smiled as he replied.

“That’s true,” Abysmal Saint Master nodded faintly, “As you are here, you can be a witness for me. I am going to punish Jian Wushuang personally now.”

“Punish? Abysmal Saint Master, how did Jian Wushuang offend you so badly that you would come personally in your original body to punish him?” Purple Moon Emperor asked in a deep voice.

“Humph. He never offended me. However, all these years, he massacred wantonly in Eternal Chaotic World. He massacred a large number of experts previously. Today, he was even more ridiculous. He exterminated over a hundred Almighties from Sanctuary Alliance with his power alone. It’s not even enough if I were to kill such a vicious man a hundred times over and over again,” Abysmal Saint Master said in a cold voice.

“From what I know, the experts that Jian Wushuang killed were either those who shared deep-seated resentment against Lineage of Star or those who cast greedy eyes over the Secret Skill of Star Palace. They took the initiative to charge to Lineage of Star. In other words, he did not massacre wantonly. He shouldn’t be considered to be violating Sanctuary Alliance’s rules, right?”

Purple Moon Emperor squinted his eyes and said, “Abysmal Saint Master, how about this? I already sent a message to Ancestor Tian Chen and East Royal Emperor. The incident that happened over the years in Sanctuary Alliance is in their control. When they arrive, let’s discuss and decide if Jian Wushuang has broken the rule and if he massacred wantonly. By then, it won’t be too late to take action.”

“Jian Wushuang has gone mad. Any extra moment he lives might bring a disaster to Sanctuary Alliance. It’s unnecessary to wait for them. As I said, he violated the rules, he did. I say he should die, so he should,” Abysmal Saint Master burst out a chilly stare, “Purple Moon, move aside.”

“Abysmal Saint Master, this is Purple Moon Sanctuary. This is my territory. Aren’t you too barbaric in conduct?” Purple Moon Emperor roared in anger.

“Barbaric? Hehe. If you were to come in your original body, you might qualify for me to consider this again. However, with just your consciousness embodiment, you want to stop me? Go away!!!” Abysmal Saint Master’s gaze was cold.

There was a sudden roar and the roar contained boundless power, like the roar of heaven and earth.

It instantly formed a terrifying space storm and spun to the void where Purple Moon Emperor’s consciousness embodiment was.

The void instantly shattered along with Purple Moon Emperor’s consciousness embodiment.

“Abysmal, how dare you…” Purple Moon Emperor was furious. However, he had yet to finish his sentence and his consciousness embodiment dispersed.

The surrounding people saw what had happened and they looked shocked.

No one had ever expected that they were both Great Emperors but Abysmal Saint Master didn’t bother with Purple Moon Emperor at all.

He even extinguished Purple Moon Emperor’s consciousness embodiment directly before everyone.
