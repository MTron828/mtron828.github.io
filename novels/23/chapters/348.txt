Chapter 349: An Unexpected Surprise!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“You should be proud to be killed by my magic weapon.”

Along with his soaring killing intent, Second Holy Master held a Giant Hammer, which was filled with a violent aura. His cold voice resounded through the whole area.

Many onlookers just now realized that Second Holy Master had been fighting without a weapon.

“Boy, let me help you on your way.”

Second Holy Master took a stride and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and launched an attack with his Giant Hammer. Invisible waves spread out as if to suppress the whole area.

Jian Wushuang looked pale and felt he was facing a deadly crisis. His eyes became crazy. Then, he suddenly raised his head and let out a hysterical cry.

“Fight!”

Though he knew that his Spiritual Power was used up and death was waiting for him, he still lifted his hand. The Triple-kill Sword madly trembled and roared.

The towering Phantom Giant behind him greatly increased in size, brandishing a longsword.

Jian Wushuang swung the Triple-kill Sword forward.

He used up his last bit of strength and struck a blow.

“Go to hell!” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The greenish black Giant Hammer directly collided with the Triple-kill Sword.

Clang! A metallic sound came out and invisible waves spread toward Jian Wushuang.

Bang! Jian Wushuang’s right hand suddenly tore, causing a mess of blood and flesh. His bones barely could be seen while his Triple-kill Sword was cast away.

The invisible waves continued to sweep over him.

Jian Wushuang only felt a stream of unimaginable power lash against him. Blood was spat out and his eyes and nose began bleeding. He felt as if all of his bones had been smashed.

Bang!

Jian Wushuang fell down to the mountain below. A huge pit appeared on the ground, with Jian Wushuang at the bottom of it.

Many spectators looked toward the pit.

After quite a while, it was still quiet in the pit.

Some onlookers sighed and proclaimed, “It’s over!”

“An expert of the Yang Void Realm actually managed to fight Second Holy Master to such an extent. He was amazing.”

“It was amazing indeed. Our Nanyang Continent has had many geniuses in the past, but Jian Wushuang was peerless. What a pity! If given more time, he would have become a legend. Now it’s all over!”

“That’s the end.”

“It’s over.”

Many of the experts felt pity for this marvelous genius.

Geniuses always needed time to grow. If they died before they matured, they could not become a legend.

In the pit, Jian Wushuang was still able to open his eyes. Even though blood was flowing from his mouth, his bones were almost broken, and his aura was disappearing, he still had a hint of consciousness.

“Am I going to die?” Jian Wushuang murmured.

His voice sounded quite feeble.

“Holy Emperor Palace, I refuse to die...”

“I haven’t delivered on the promise with my father.

“I haven’t reached the pinnacle as a warrior...

“My parents, brothers, and relatives...

“There are too many things I haven’t done!

“I won’t accept it!”

He slowly closed his eyes, then suddenly reopened them.

A hint of shock flashed in his eyes.

“That, that is...” Jian Wushuang regained his consciousness. He saw a bizarre gray light in his belly.

The grey light grew brighter and brighter, gradually gathering something.

It was a gray stone bead, which was emitting a faint light.

“The gray stone bead!”

Jian Wushuang was greatly taken aback.

It had been in his body for 16 years.

Heavenly Creation Skill and Soul-Devouring Secret Skill both came from it.

The gray stone bead could be considered the key point in changing his fate.

Without the gray stone bead and Heavenly Creation Skill, he might have achieved a lot, but he could not improve his strength to such an extent in a short period of time.

The gray stone bead was mysterious and inconceivable.

Jian Wushuang did not know when the gray stone bead appeared in his body.

After the gray stone bead absorbed the Spiritual Power to its limit, Jian Wushuang originally thought it had completely disappeared. He had never perceived its existence during these few years. However, now, when he was dying, the mysterious gray stone bead emerged once again.

It began to spin, producing a thick gray fog. It was ground until it was the size of an infant’s thumb before the bead finally stopped. The thick gray fog madly gathered and condensed into a gray waterdrop.

The moment the gray waterdrop finished forming, it immediately merged with his body.

Jian Wushuang felt a stream of great and refreshing power flow through his body. In an instant, his injured bones, muscles, and organs started to recover at an amazing speed.

It was too fast.

In his sea of consciousness, a tough Sword Soul was quietly suspended there.

The Sword Soul was so strong. Though Jian Wushuang was just at death’s door, it still remained intact. Under the influence of the gray waterdrop, the Sword Soul began to shake violently. Sword Essence rolled while his Sword Soul greatly expanded.

Then the Sword Soul split!

Once his sea of consciousness calmed down, the Sword Soul had been divided into two.

Double Sword Souls!!!
