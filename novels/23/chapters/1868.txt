Chapter 1869: Emperor Sword Sect

“In another few years’ time, it will be the day where the Emperor Sword Palace opens again and it is obvious that the Emperor Sword Sect has already made preparations for it. Since they knew that some people would come to visit them during this period of time, they actually sent a Sir God expert to welcome them?” Jian Wushuang stroked his nose. He had already realized the existence of a white-haired old man in front of the entrance of the Emperor Sword Sect.

This white-haired old man stood at his position like an old monk who was sitting in meditation and he did not care about the normal disciples and experts who entered or left the Emperor Sword Sect in the slightest.

Jian Wushuang did not hesitate either. His body turned vague and he walked forward. While walking, Jian Wushuang released a portion of his god power intentionally.

Upon feeling the existence of the god power, the white-haired old man who was sitting in meditation opened his eyes immediately and looked in the direction of Jian Wushuang.

“I am Tian Guzi. I wonder which friend of ours has come to the Emperor Sword Sect?” the white-haired old man’s hearty voice reverberated across the area.

“Tian Guzi?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. In no time, his body stopped before Tian Guzi and came into view.

As the distance between them got shorter, Tian Guzi felt the aura that Jian Wushuang emitted and his expression changed at once.

When Jian Wushuang’s body came into shape completely and when he saw his looks clearly, Tian Guzi frowned.

“So it’s the famous Sword Emperor. Nice to meet you,” Tian Guzi greeted Jian Wushuang to show his respect.

Although Jian Wushuang was only a Real God, his abilities were already displayed.

Tian Guzi was merely a normal Sir God. As such, he naturally treated Jian Wushuang with respect.

“I have heard that the Emperor Sword Palace that your sect controls will open up after another period of time and I am here to pay a visit,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

“As expected, he is here for the Emperor Sword Palace,” Tian Guzi’s heart felt heavy.

The Emperor Sword Palace opening up soon was not a secret to begin with. Hence, during this period of time, quite a number of experts had paid a visit to the Emperor Sword Sect.

Jian Wushuang was an expert who was proficient in Sword Principles. Hence, it was normal for him to pay a visit. However… there had been some episodes between the Emperor Sword Sect Master and the Lineage of Star’s Star Palace Master in the past.

“Sword Emperor, please wait a moment. Let me first relay a message to my Sect Master to tell him that you have come,” Tian Guzi said.

“You have to first send him a message to ask him? Aren’t you here especially to wait for the large number of experts who made their way here to pay a visit? Could it be that you cannot make up your mind? Or are you trying to say that the Emperor Sword Sect does not welcome me?” Jian Wushuang looked at Tian Guzi.

“How could I dare to do that?” Tian Guzi shook his head repeatedly and laughed. “As Sword Emperor is a super existence who is ranked twenty-second on the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, the Emperor Sword Sect will naturally be afraid of you if you come here personally. I am now sending a message to my Palace Master to allow him to make ample preparations to welcome you, Sword Emperor.”

“Oh? Is that so?” Jian Wushuang laughed jokingly and did not say much.

Tian Guzi sent the news of the arrival of Jian Wushuang to the Emperor Sword Sect Master right away.

In a giant palace at the core of the Emperor Sword Sect, there were figures which were emitting a large amount of aura sitting there. These people were all experts who had come to pay a visit before the Emperor Sword Palace opened.

Moreover, most of these experts were proficient in Sword Principles.

The Emperor Sword Palace was a place of opportunity which Sword Emperor Dugu from the First Era had left behind. At that moment, the greatest opportunity in the Emperor Sword Palace was the Sword Principle Inheritance.

For the Sword Principle Inheritance, only people who possessed the Sword Principle Inheritance Token had the right to obtain it. However, there were merely five Inheritance Tokens. Moreover, two of them had always been in the hands of the Emperor Sword Palace. In other words, there were only three Sword Principle Inheritance Tokens that were circulating around the outside world. Every time the Emperor Sword Palace opened, only three experts from the outside world could go deep into the Emperor Sword Palace.

However, there were some small opportunities for Sword Principles in the Emperor Sword Palace. Hence, they were still attractive to quite a number of experts who were proficient in Sword Principles.

Therefore, even though they did not possess Sword Principle Inheritance Tokens, every time the Emperor Sword Palace opened, some experts would go out of their way to come over.

The person who sat at the highest point of the hall was a red-robed man with dashing eyebrows. He was the Emperor Sword Sect Master.

However, at that moment, he was holding on to a wine cup and chatting with a purple-clothed woman who was before a long narrow table.

“I did not expect that the Emperor Sword Palace’s opening this time around could actually get you, Luo Xianzi, to come personally as well. My Emperor Sword Sect is really honored by your presence,” the Emperor Sword Sect Master purred and his words were filled with the intention to earn her favor.

However, the purple-clothed woman’s expression was extremely cold and she merely used a few words to barely deal with the Emperor Sword Sect Master’s words.

The Emperor Sword Sect Master was not upset in the slightest. After all, he knew what kind of temper Luo Xianzi had.

Just then… from outside the entrance of the sect, Tian Guzi’s message came.

“What, Sword Emperor?” the Emperor Sword Sect Master’s expression changed and he could not help but murmur, “This Sword Emperor has actually come as well?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

There were no grudges between him and Jian Wushuang. Moreover, there were no big episodes between the Emperor Sword Sect and the Lineage of Star either.

However, he had once suffered big losses in the hands of the Star Palace Master. As such, he still harbored some hatred toward the Star Palace Master. Thus, it was difficult for him to not vent his anger on the experts of the Lineage of Star.

Hence, with regards to Jian Wushuang, he did not really welcome him.

“Everyone who comes is a guest. Since he has come, please let him in,” the Emperor Sword Sect Master messaged Tian Guzi.

In no time, Tian Guzi led Jian Wushuang to the palace.

The moment Jian Wushuang appeared, the large number of experts in the palace who were originally chatting and drinking quietened down right away.

At that moment, all their eyes were locked onto Jian Wushuang.

Without even needing Tian Guzi or the Emperor Sword Sect Master to introduce him, all those experts already recognized him.

As they had recognized Jian Wushuang’s identity, the atmosphere in the palace became silent instantly.

A mighty name was a good shelter. In the Eternal Chaotic World, Jian Wushuang’s fierce name was too great!

In particular, within the recent thousands of years, it was unknown as to how many Almighties had died at his hands and even a good number of Emperor Gods had died at his hands as well.

As for the ten over experts present, although all of them were Almighties, apart from Luo Xianzi, no one could remain calm when they looked at Jian Wushuang.

Moreover, there were a few people who felt terrified when they saw Jian Wushuang.

For these people, the sects that they were in had huge grudges against the Lineage of Star. Hence, when they saw Jian Wushuang, a murderous god, it was difficult for them to not feel fearful.

After all, if Jian Wushuang were to go crazy and attack them, they would be doomed.

However, fortunately, after Jian Wushuang entered the palace, he did not care about those people at all. Instead, his eyes locked onto Luo Xianzi right away.

“I did not expect her to be here as well?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

With regards to Luo Xianzi, Jian Wushuang had never had any dealings with her before and he had not seen her before.

However, with regards to Luo Xianzi’s abilities, Jian Wushuang knew about them well.

Peak Emperor God!

Moreover, she was ranked twenty-first in the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, which was right above him.
