Chapter 283: Leave This Man to Me!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Shen Tianyu ranks 489th on the Bloodmoon List and has comprehended Gale Source. He had a fierce fight with a Half-saint expert for a long time, even though he lost.

“This man was qualified for me to use my full strength.”

Jian Wushuang recalled the information about Shen Tianyu, as a powerful battle intent emanated from his body.

“Buzzing...” A cold streak of blade light split the Void and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang curled his lips and evoked his Spiritual Power. When his arm was full of power, he waved slightly. Then his Triple-kill Sword, carrying great momentum, lashed out.

Shen Tianyu had not put him in his eyes.

He had beaten away the Tai Shan and the other eight with one stroke. Even an ordinary expert at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm could not block his casual strike.

However, the moment his opponent’s stroke collided with his saber, Shen Tianyu suddenly raised his head in surprise, because he felt a strong power come over.

Thump! Shen Tianyu was forced to retreat nearly 100 meters away before he could stabilize his body above the Void.

“Master, a real expert!” Shen Tianyu looked toward Jian Wushuang seriously.

With just one stroke, he had perceived that Jian Wushuang was at least stronger than Tai Shan and the other eight.

“Who are you?” Shen Tianyu asked in a low voice.

“Swordsman,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“I’ve never heard of you.” Shen Tianyu shook his head.

“Now you know.” Jian Wushuang sneered.

“He, that sounds arrogant. You dare to block me, then you’ll die!” Shen Tianyu’s eyes became cold and his body floated up in the blink of an eye, with a gust of wind from the Void.

“Leave this man to me.” Jian Wushuang spoke to the surprised Tai Shan and Mo Ying. Then with a stride, the Triple-kill Sword’s power roared and slashed forward.

There was nothing in the Void. However, a ghost-like figure appeared in this Void after Jian Wushuang struck the blow. It turned out to be Shen Tianyu. His saber light crashed with Jian Wushuang’s, causing a loud sound. As the scary power spread out...

Whoosh! Whoosh!

The two figures unexpectedly disappeared.

“Where are they?”

The other nine teammates widened their eyes and stared in shock.

Shen Tianyu had frightened them, while Jian Wushuang shocked even more.

They had failed to block Shen Tianyu, but Jian Wushuang could block him by himself.

Jian Wushuang suddenly appeared above the Void.

A streak of white light appeared. It was so dazzling that Jian Wushuang could not open his eyes. At this moment, the streak of light unexpectedly swept through Jian Wushuang’s head.

“Huh?”

Tai Shan and the other eight teammates could not help exclaiming. “Is Jian Wushuang going to die?”

In fact, they did not see a drop of blood, but Jian Wushuang’s body was slowly disappearing. It was just a shadow.

A cold streak of sword shadow suddenly appeared behind Shen Tianyu. Shen Tianyu perceived it and turned his hand over to block it. With a loud bang, the two of them disappeared again.

“How fast!”

Tai Shan and the other eight teammates were stunned by what happened.

Chuu!

A deep ravine suddenly appeared on the ground. Obviously, it was caused by the Long Sword. Then with a loud boom, another deep hole appeared.

Though they were experts at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm and were looking carefully, they could not see the two figures.

Boom!

The Void split in half. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Shen Tianyu was suspended above the Void and looking at Jian Wushuang seriously.

He no longer looked down on Jian Wushuang.

“He’s just reached the Initial Yang Void Realm. It’s out of my expectation that he could catch up with me.”?Shen Tianyu thought in astonishment, because he himself had comprehended Gale Source.

If one studied Gale Essence to the limit, one could comprehend Gale Source.

Gale Source could improve speed.

If he used his full strength into his speed, the ordinary Half-saint experts might not catch up with him. However, Jian Wushuang, who was just at the Initial Yang Void Realm, was not slower than him.

Shen Tianyu did not know that Jian Wushuang had comprehended World Origin, which was a Perfect Combination of four kinds of essence. It meant that he was adept at each aspect, including speed. More importantly, Jian Wushuang had reached Momentum, much higher than Shen Tianyu’s.

“Don’t waste time with him, or I’ll be in big trouble if the three Protectors arrive.”Shen Tianyu thought. Then he transformed into a gust of wind and dashed out.

“Boy, let’s fight to the death.” Shen Tianyu shouted.

“That’s what I wanted.” Jian Wushuang sneered and started to launch an attack.

“Sword Fog.”?A roaring Sword Essence formed the heavy fog, creating a small Realm of Sword Essence.

Shen Tianyu was oppressed by the heavy fog, which affected his speed.

“What?” Shen Tianyu’s face changed, but he still maintained his momentum.

“A Thousand Cuts. Go to hell!” Shen Tianyu shouted in a low voice.

A large amount of Spiritual Power gathered in his cyan saber and made the saber double in size. With the soaring power, the saber violently lashed out.

In the blink of an eye, the heaven and earth split in two.

“Selfless Sword Technique, sixth move!”

Jian Wushuang’s battle strength reached the peak. The power of his Triple-kill Sword burst out at this moment.

A brilliant stroke moved forward!

The two horrifying forces made the onlookers hold their breath.

Instantly, two massive and horrible forces fiercely collided in the Void.

“Boom!”

It shook the earth and mountain, with a severe gale blowing.

The next moment, a figure was repelled, who spat out a mouthful of blood. It was Shen Tianyu.
