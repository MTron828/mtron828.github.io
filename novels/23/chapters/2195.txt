Chapter 2196 You Are Too Controlling!

After a deep breath, Leng Ruxue gave a modest look.“Greetings, Emperor Thirteen. I am Leng Ruxue.”

Emperor Thirteen looked at Leng Ruxue coldly without saying a word.

Leng Ruxue was nervous.

She was fearful of Emperor Thirteen.

He had managed to shake the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth and reach the Half-Step Divine Demon Realm with his own power.

Back in the ancient past, he had been even more powerful. He could solo the Master of Holy Land and could go even against the being that supported Leng Ruxue.

If Emperor Thirteen wanted to kill her, there was nothing she could do.

“From the myths, Emperor Thirteen would never kill a weakling. To him, I am just someone insignificant who was born at this age. He would not kill me.”

“Furthermore, he was on Jian Wushuang’s side and helped Jian Wushuang during his time of need. Within my body, I suppressed that woman’s consciousness. If he really tried anything funny, I could simply commit suicide with her. If that happened, he would not be able to face Jian Wushuang.”

Leng Ruxue thought to herself as she calmed down.

She believed that Emperor Thirteen would not kill her.

Suddenly…

Emperor Thirteen, who stood there peacefully, raised his right hand and pointed at her.

This action looked very casual.

However, heaven and earth shook as the space was ripped apart.

An enormous fault in heaven and earth appeared.

This fault continued to expand at terrifying speed.

One thousand feet!

Ten thousand feet!

One hundred thousand feet!

One million feet!

This cracked sped towards her.

“Oh no!”

Leng Ruxue turned pale.

Right when she thought Emperor Thirteen would not have done anything funny to try and kill her, he attacked.

Instantly, Leng Ruxue was radiating an unique aura.

This aura was at the power level of a stage three great emperor. Her jet black hair turned white and her irises turned grey.

When Leng Ruxue was about to deflect the sword from Emperor Thirteen, the humongous crack disappeared.

The terrifying sword essence dissipated.

The entire space was peaceful, except for the destructive aura that she was radiating.

Emperor Thirteen stood there, surprised.

Leng Ruxue looked at Emperor Thirteen, confused.

Emperor Thirteen was not trying to kill her.

That sword was to test Leng Ruxue. As for why…

“White hair, grey irises. Destiny Constitution. No wonder. The only reason you can reach such a stage within such a short time is because of that person helping you.”

Leng Ruxue frowned.

She knew who Emperor Thirteen was referring to.

Her unique constitution was only linked to that being.

Seeing that Leng Ruxue did not say anything in defense, Emperor Thirteen said once again, “Tell this to the person behind you: she is too controlling of the things she should not be. If she does not stop in time, I will stop her, one way or another.”

Emperor Thirteen turned around and left.

Leng Ruxue stared at Emperor Thirteen’s back coldly.

A few days later, Leng Ruxue reached a unique mystery land.

Sanctuary Alliance had no idea that the Holocaust Sect had complete control over this mystery land.

At the depth of the mystery land, there was a majestic altar.

Leng Ruxue squeezed a blood essence from her index finger as it dripped onto the secret restrictions on the altar.

The entire altar started to run. Within moments, a blurry figure appeared on this altar.

This blurry figure was over two metres tall and her facial expressions could not be seen clearly. From the looks of it, the figure belonged to a beautiful female.

“Master,” Leng Ruxue said as she saluted the figure.

“Blood Emperor failed?” A soft and graceful voice was heard.

“Yes,” Leng Ruxue nodded her head lightly.

“Haha. This is within my predictions. That dumbass. Does he really think a formation can shake the restrictions of heaven and earth here?”

“What a joke. Has he ever thought about who made the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth. Even the other two Masters of Holy Land cannot do so with all their might. Who is he to try?” The blurry figure mocked.

The blurry figure looked down on Blood Emperor.

It was not just because of the Blood Emperor’s weak fighting power. More importantly, it was because he was arrogant.

He did not know the true power of the restrictions!

“Master, during the battle, Emperor Thirteen was there,” Leng Ruxue continued.

“Emperor Thirteen?” The blurry figure said with a deeper voice as she treated this more seriously.

She did not care about a mere Blood Emperor.

However, it was a different case when it came to Emperor Thirteen.

“Has Emperor Thirteen awakened?”

“Looks like those experts who were in slumber in that heaven and earth are all about to wake up,” the blurry figure sighed. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Master, Emperor Thirteen came over and found me alone. He knows about your existence. He asked me to pass you a message,” Leng Ruxue said.

“Speak,” the blurry figure said.

“He wants me to tell you that you are too controlling of some things that you shouldn’t be. If you do not stop, he will, one way or another,” Leng Ruxue said.

“How dare he!”

The blurry figure was instantly enraged. “Even the old owner of the Seven Star Black Sect would not dare to say that to me. Emperor Thirteen, you got courage!”

“Who is he to say that?”

Leng Ruxue stood there, quietly listening.

Even though the blurry figure was enraged, there was nothing she could do.

The blurry figure looked down at her right arm. If her original body had been there and she lifted up her sleeve, a clear sword scar would have been seen. Even though the scar was not large, it represented the greatest disgrace in her life!

That was exactly the reason why she had kept the sword scar on her arm and refused to let it heal.

Emperor Thirteen was the one who had left the sword scar there.

“Emperor Thirteen, you should feel lucky that the Restrictions of Heaven and Earth are far too powerful there. I cannot go there personally. If not, I would personally tear you to bits!”

The blurry figure yelled before she looked over at Leng Ruxue.

“Disciple, tell this to those who are about to awaken.”

“Thirty thousands years later, Heaven’s Horizon… That is their only chance!”
