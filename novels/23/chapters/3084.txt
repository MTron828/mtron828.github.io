Chapter 3085: Emperor Blood Kill

——

After performing the 15th move, Xiong Tao finally relaxed and was still breathing heavily.

But at this time…bang!

The ground suddenly burst open, and a figure rose up again. It was naturally Jian Wushuang.

At this moment, his figure was a bit disheveled, but only a bit disheveled. As for his aura, it was still at its peak.

“Xiong Tao, your staff skill just now was really good, but I wonder if you still have the 16th move?” Jian Wushuang asked excitedly.

“The 16th move?” Xiong Tao was stunned, but then he smiled bitterly. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

His staff skill was only comprehended after studying it for a long time in a lucky place in the Dao Palace, and it had not been perfected yet.

With his current strength and cultivation, it was already the limit for him to use the 15th staff move, or even barely.

It was impossible for him to continue accumulating strength to use the 16th staff move!

“Is that all?” Jian Wushuang was obviously disappointed.

After a while, he raised his head again and said, “Xiong Tao, I just received 15 staff moves from you. Then, you should also receive one from me.”

Xiong Tao took a deep breath and his expression immediately became extremely solemn.

Jian Wushuang did not speak again, but the vast divine power behind him had already begun to condense.

In just a moment, a Golden Emperor Phantom, which was 30,000 feet tall, appeared behind him.

The Golden Emperor Phantom contained endless majesty and looked down on everything. Its cold eyes focused on Xiong Tao, making Xiong Tao tense up and feel an extraordinary pressure.

Then, Jian Wushuang held the hilt of the sword tightly with both hands and slowly raised the Blood Mountain Sword.

The moment the Blood Mountain Sword was raised, a strange power began to spread.

Xiong Tao stared at Jian Wushuang with a serious expression. However, at this moment, Xiong Tao suddenly felt a special power crazily pressing down on him.

“This is…” Xiong Tao was stunned, but he immediately understood the source of this power.

“Space-time is the power of space-time in the surroundings!”

“This pressure is the pressure of space-time!”

“This sword attack of his has brought about the pressure of space-time!”

Xiong Tao stared at Jian Wushuang, but at this time, from Jian Wushuang’s body, the blazing flames mixed with endless white ice fog and produced endless power of ice and fire.

The two natural opposing powers of ice and fire merged perfectly at this moment. The power of ice and fire swept wildly in all directions, covering the vast world in the blink of an eye, it formed a huge world of ice and fire.

With Jian Wushuang as the core, the world of ice and fire pressed toward Xiong Tao with Jian Wushuang’s will.

In an instant, Xiong Tao felt that he was being burned and eroded by two completely different forces of ice and fire. His divine power was completely suppressed by the power of ice and fire.

“How is this possible?”

Xiong Tao’s eyes were wide open.

“The power of ice and fire…is a domain. Yes, it is a domain!”

“But how could a first rank True Saint use such a powerful domain?”

Xiong Tao was stunned.

He found that his divine power had been reduced by 50% under the suppression of the power of ice and fire!

What did it mean?

Even if a rank four True Saint controlled an ordinary domain treasure, he could only suppress 30% of his divine power?

Xiong Tao did not know that Jian Wushuang was not controlling an ordinary domain treasure, but a domain treasure, the ice and fire swimming dragon ruler!

This was the first time Jian Wushuang had used this treasure since he had obtained it in the Beiming Mystic Realm.

When he used it, its power did not disappoint Jian Wushuang.

The 30,000-meter-high divine punishment deterrence…

The domain-type supreme treasure, ice-fire swimming dragon ruler, suppressed it with all its might…

And the space-time power that was crazily pressuring him…

All of this was actually for Jian Wushuang’s next sword move.

This move was still from the Peerless Sword Manual. It was called…Emperor Blood Kill!

“Cut!”

With a roar, Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword, which had been raised high, finally slashed down.

This cut caused the space-time power that was pressing down on Xiong Tao from all directions to suddenly surge!

Xiong Tao had already felt an extraordinary space-time pressure, but at this moment, the space-time pressure suddenly increased by a hundred times!

This space-time pressure was too strong!

It was ridiculously strong. Coupled with the Heaven Punisher’s intimidation and the ice and fire dragon ruler’s full-scale suppression, Xiong Tao was completely stupefied at this moment.

He was indeed stupefied.

It could be said that this pressure was really too strong, so strong that he could not even move his body.

That unprecedented pressure and intimidation made him lose the ability to resist at this moment, allowing the scarlet sword light to slash at him.

Boom!

The sword light directly cut into Xiong Tao’s divine body.

Although Xiong Tao was a special life form with strong defensive ability, he could not withstand such a terrifying sword attack head-on and his divine body instantly collapsed.

However, after destroying Xiong Tao’s divine body, Jian Wushuang did not attack again.

Soon, Xiong Tao’s divine body regenerated again.

After the divine body regenerated, Xiong Tao still stood there, his eyes still staring at Jian Wushuang, but his gaze was very complicated.

As for Jian Wushuang, his eyes were calm, but there was a faint smile at the corner of his mouth.

“One of the seven swordsmanship moves of the Wushuang Sword Manual, the Emperor Blood Kill. This move is the combination of swordsmanship and space-time oppression,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Each of the seven swordsmanship moves of the Wushuang Sword Technique had its own characteristics.

The Emperor Blood Kill was the perfect combination of swordsmanship and space-time oppression. The swordsmanship contained a terrifying space-time oppression power. When the swordsmanship burst out, the space-time oppression would instantly surge to the limit, the space-time pressure would restrict the opponent to the greatest extent, and Jian Wushuang was good at domains, so he also integrated the domain into this move.

Just now, he had perfectly combined the intimidation of the divine punishment god, the pressure of the realm of ice-fire swimming dragon ruler, and the pressure of the space-time force to restrict Xiong Tao to the greatest extent, so Xiong Tao could not resist it at all.

But in fact, the sword just now was not in the perfect state of Emperor Blood Kill.

After all, Jian Wushuang had not fully displayed his realm and his star-armor realm. Moreover, in terms of the intimidation effect, the supreme sword essence in Blood Mountain Sword was even more powerful.

Therefore, only when the Heaven Punisher, ice-fire swimming dragon ruler, star-armor realm, supreme sword essence, and the powerful space-time pressure contained in the swordsmanship were perfectly combined together! This was the true and complete form of the ‘Blood Emperor Kill’!
