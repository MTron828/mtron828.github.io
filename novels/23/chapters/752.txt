Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Who’s that?”

“A Demon God?”

Palace Master Destruction, Palace Master Mo Tao, and Palace Master Ming Xin caught sight of Jian Wushuang, but they did not stop running.

Jian Wushuang was standing motionlessly in the Void, staring coldly at Yun Fan, who had transformed into a Silver-armored Ancient God.

“Is that Yun Fan, the Great Elder from the Cloud Sea Asgard?”

His mind was racing. “It is said that aside from his Master, Yun Fan is the most powerful Eternal Realm expert in the Firmament Territory. His strength is at least at the peak of Step Three. Perhaps it’s already at Step Four. No wonder he has driven Palace Master Destruction and the other two to flee in haste.”

“He is stronger than any of the human Eternal Realm experts I’ve met before.”

“Such being the case…”

Jian Wushuang squinted. A dark golden light flickered in his eyes. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

He activated his inside bloodline and his body started to grow at an incredible speed.

A 15-meter high Gold-armored Ancient God appeared, exuding blazing golden lights.

“A Gold-armored Demon God?”

Palace Master Destruction and the other two were stunned.

They had been told that there were only a few Gold-armored Demon Gods in the whole Demon God Clan, and they were the most powerful of all the Demon Gods.

They had once fought with a Gold-armored Demon God, so they were perfectly aware of the terrible strength such a creature could possess.

Although it seemed that the Gold-armored Demon God before them was only at the One-star Level, as they watched him turn into a Demon God, they still shuddered with fear.

He was way too big and strong!

He was 15 meters tall.

A 15-meter high Gold-armored Demon God looked like a small mountain in their eyes.

Behind them, the Silver-armored Demon God Yun Fan had turned into was only five meters high.

…

When Jian Wushuang transformed into a Gold-armored Ancient God, his Emperor Sword also grew to 10 meters long. He held the sword in his hand. A majestic aura started to permeate to the surroundings.

“Fight!”

Jian Wushuang howled. His huge feet strode quickly forward.

A series of heavy footsteps sounded.

Each step carried enormous power. When he stomped, the Void was distorted by his weight.

He made one step after another. His aura grew increasingly thicker.

The moment Palace Master Destruction and the other two, who were busy escaping at top speed, saw the Gold-armored Ancient God galloping towards them, their expressions altered in terror.

“Er…er…” Palace Master Ming Xin was utterly petrified. “What a dreadful, dreadful power! He is only a One-star Demon God, but the pressure he imposes on me is even more unbearable than that of the strongest Two-star Silver-armored Demon God I’ve ever met!”

“What should we do? What should we do now?” Palace Master Mo Tao lost his poise and started shouting in panic.

Yun Fan, who had turned into a Silver-armored Demon God, was still chasing after them.

And now a horrible Gold-armored Ancient God had appeared in front of them.

Despair!

Palace Master Mo Tao and Palace Master Ming Xin were gripped with anguish.

“We’re screwed!” Palace Master Destruction shouted.

The 15-meter high Gold-armored Demon God arrived in front of them.

Shocked and terrified, Palace Master Destruction and the other two forgot to even defend themselves. But in the next second, something astonishing happened.

The 15-meter high Gold-armored Demon God was very close to them, but he seemed to have no intention of taking them on. He barely looked at them and passed by swiftly.

“What…”

“How, how come?”

“He, he!”

Their minds went numb for a moment.

They had fought against Demon Gods many times. Whenever Demon Gods spotted them, they attacked without hesitation.

However, this Gold-armored Demon God had just swept past them without even looking at them. How could that be?

What was really going on?

In fact, Yun Fan was just as startled.

“What the hell?” His face turned grim. “The Gold-armored Demon God didn’t do anything to those three but is rushing towards me?”

“Is it because I’m a human being transformed into a Demon God? This Gold-armored Demon God hates me for this?”

Myriads of thoughts popped into Yun Fan’s mind. But at this moment he had no time to figure it out, for Jian Wushuang was already in front of him.

“Secret Skill, the Netherworld!”

Jian Wushuang held the Emperor Sword with both hands. The Sword Heart was shaking fiercely in his sea of consciousness. He released all of his power.

His strength skyrocketed to the extreme. He quickly launched his most formidable Secret Skill.

Jian Wushuang went all out on the first attack.

Since his arrival in the Tianqi Mountains, Jian Wushuang had gone through several battles with Eternal Realm experts from various sects in the Firmament Territory. But during these fights, he had never fully demonstrated his power. In terms of Sword Heart power, he always kept a portion of it reserved. And he had never transformed into an Ancient God to fight, either.

But now, he had turned into a Gold-armored Ancient God and unleashed the full power of his Sword Heart.

“Boom!”

A colossal sword light appeared.

When Jian Wushuang put in all his strength, his mighty sword unleashed a stream of force that astounded the world like a starry Sword River.

“Swoosh!” The force shot toward Yun Fan with great momentum.

The sky changed color, and everything started to tremble.

Although the sword attack had not reached its target yet, it’s frightening momentum was already whirling about, relentlessly squeezing the air and pressing against the vast earth below.

“Crack!” On the ground below, cracks emerged one after another; each of them was more than 300 meters in length.

“Bang!”

A rumble sounded. The entire earth sank a few meters under the impact of the terrifying momentum.

At this point, Palace Master Destruction and the other two had already fled far from the battlefield, and so had the two experts from the Cloud Sea Asgard. But despite the distance, they could still feel the horrible power this sword light carried, and they all gasped.

As for Yun Fan, he was the one the sword light targeted, so he distinctly felt its dreadful power. His face grew solemn.

“You’re a Gold-armored Demon God? So what!? You’re just a One-star. I am a Two-star Silver Demon God!”

Yun Fan bellowed. He was clenching a black Stone Staff, which suddenly grew to three meters long. It emitted an overbearing aura. As Yun Fan hoisted it up with his both hands, whiffs of world-devasting aura began to converge into it.

“Secret Skill, Heaven Anthem!”

Suddenly, a clear and melodious voice reverberated throughout the area. The voice was beautiful, but it was also mingled with a trace of sorrow.

It sounded like the music of lament.

The music kept ringing. A towering Stone Staff streaked furiously across the sky. It was heading straight for Jian Wushuang.
