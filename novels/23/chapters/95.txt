Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Your Excellency, please give me your Golden-dragon Ring,” the elder with grey hair said.

Jian Wushuang handed him the ring without hesitation.

Soon the elder returned it to Jian Wushuang and said, “Your Excellency, the task has been confirmed. From now on, you are a Two-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard of Golden-dragon Palace.”

Looking at the Golden-dragon Ring, Jian Wushuang found that there were two claw marks which were the sign of a Two-Clawed Golden Dragon Guard.

“Arrange a Griffin for me, please. I’m going back to Dragon Palace,” Jian Wushuang then asked.

“Okay. I will do it right now,” the elder with grey hair said and nodded.

At the very moment, a gentle middle-aged man in a white coat walked into the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace.

Suddenly the Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace fell silent. All those present looked at that man.

“Yin-Yang Void Realm!”

“Is he a Golden-dragon Ambassador?”

“No, he isn’t. He is… the Governor of Blizzard City– His Excellency Lin Yun!”

“Yes. He is. It is said that His Excellency Lin Yun is a very kind and respectable good elder.”

People in Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace were all in shock.

It was very rare to meet such a super master of Yin-Yang Void Realm.

Jian Wushuang also looked over at that man.

With a mild face, the gentle middle-aged looked elegant and cultivated, decent and smart. Besides, his eyes were very kind and warm.

Generally speaking, a super master who was in Yin-Yang Void Realm had an amazing deterrent power. But the gentle middle-aged man was very kind and friendly, which made it hard for people to fear him.

“Mr. He,” the gentle middle-aged man walked to the counter softy said.

“Your Excellency Lin Yun.” The elder showed great respect.

“I’d like to assign a task, please give me that task scroll,” Lin Yun said very politely.

“Okay. Wait for a moment, please.” The black-robed elder instantly went to take the scroll.

Lin Yun waited in front of the counter with a slight smile. After looking around, he saw Jian Wushuang who was also waiting in front of the counter.

“Hmmm?” Lin Yun suddenly felt stunned but he did not express it.

“Little Brother, may I know your name?” Lin Yun seemed to ask casually.

Feeling startled, Jian Wushuang didn’t expect that an elder of Yin-Yang Void Realm would talk to him and instantly answered, “I’m Swordsman.”

“Swordsman?” Lin Yun showed a quirky expression without saying more.

“Your Excellency Lin Yun, this is the scroll.” The black-robed elder handed it over to Lin Yun and then looked at Jian Wushuang. “Your Excellency Swordsman, your Griffin is ready. You can go outside the city.”

“Good.” Jian Wushuang nodded and then left Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace.

After Jian Wushuang left, Lin Yun instantly asked, “Mr.He, what is that young man’s status? He is just a warrior of Spiritual Sea Realm. Why do you call him Your Excellency?”

“Your Excellency Lin Yun. That young man is great,” the black-robed elder said with great admiration.

“Great? Could he come from Dragon Palace?” Lin Yun asked again.

The black-robed elder slightly smiled but didn’t reply. But Lin Yun had got the answer from his smile.

“It is him.” Lin Yun laughed brightly, and then quickly put down his pen, turning and leaving.

“YourExcellency Lin Yun, you haven’t assigned your task?” the black-robed elder promptly asked him.

“I’ll come back later.” Briefly replying, Lin Yun departed Golden Dragon Subsidiary Palace.

Outside the Moon Heart City, a Golden-armored Sergent riding a Griffin was waiting there. After arrival, Jian Wushuang directly sat on the Griffin and then left for Dragon Palace.

As soon as Jian Wushuang left, Lin Yun suddenly appeared there.

“A Griffin?” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Griffins flew so fast that Lin Yun couldn’t catch up with it even though he was a powerhouse of Yin-Yang Void Realm.

Staring at the direction where Jian Wushuang disappeared, Lin Yun lost his mild smile and turned cold. Turning his hand, he had a portrait.

The young man in the portrait was quite similar to Jian Wushuang in appearance.

“It’s him. Absolutely!”

“It can’t be a mistake!”

“Scarlet Must-kill Command… Jian Wushuang!”

Looked at the portrait, Lin Yun had an unprecedented killing intent in his eyes.

“No wonder they searched the whole Tianyan Province but could not find Jian Wushuang. Because he had left Tianyan Province and gone to Dragon Palace, being a Disciple of Dragon Palace!” Lin Yun clenched his fists.

People only knew that Lin Yun was the Governor of Blizzard City who was a very gentle and respectable man with a good reputation. However, he also concealed another identity– a purple mask killer of Blood Feather Tower.

“I finally found him!”

“I have to report it right away!”

Lin Yun immediately went back to report the news.

The news shocked the whole Blood Feather Tower for a moment.

Blood Feather Tower paid more attention to Jian Wushuang than to anyone as he was the target of a Scarlet Kill Command.

In a dim study, an old man in gray stood there with his hands behind his back. And two black-robed men in purple masks stood behind him.

Killers with purple masks, the best killers in Blood Feather Tower.

In general, killers with purple masks were selected from super experts of Yin-Yang Void Realm. However, the two killers with purple masks now were standing respectfully behind the old man in gray. It could be presumed that the old man held an important status in Blood Feather Tower.

“It is confirmed that the target of Scarlet Kill Command is using the pseudonym of Swordsman. He has been in Dragon Palace for more than nine months and showed his great talent. After three months, he has defeated a disciple of Profound Gold Core Realm and was able to pass through the sixth level of Dragon Gate,” a killer with purple mask said respectfully.

The old man in gray slightly narrowed his eyes, murmuring, “There are countless experts in Dragon Palace, the Holy Cultivation Sanctuary. Even if all the purple mask killers of Blood Feather Tower attacked Dragon Palace at once, they would not be able to kill Jian Wushuang. Therefore, we cannot kill him until he leaves Dragon Palace again.”

“Give out my order. Closely follow Jian Wushuang’s every move from today. Report his behavior and experiences in Dragon Palace every seven days. If there is a chance, the secret killer hidden in Dragon Palace should take action!”

“His Excellency, Dragon Palace is a very hard to infiltrate. We paid a great cost to plant the secret killer in it. Should we sacrifice him?” a killer with purple mask instantly asked.

“What do you know?” the old man in gray glanced at the killer with purple mask, snorting and saying, “As long as we can kill him, we will sacrifice the secret killer. If necessary, both of you could be sacrificed.”

Both two killers with purple masks were shocked by what he said.

At the same time, they eventually knew what a Scarlet Kill Command was.
