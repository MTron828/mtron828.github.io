“Are you sure?”

The eyes of Samsara Temple Master and the Palace Masters around shone immediately.

“Guys, I just go ahead.” Jian Wushuang clasped his hands together toward these Palace Masters.

“I will order everyone to get ready for the battle. As for that Long Xu King, we are waiting for your good news!” Samsara Temple Master said seriously.

“Hmm.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head. Then, quick as a flash, he moved toward the Void where Long Xu King was located.

Passing through the Restrictions above the Battle Fortress, Jian Wushuang showed up in front of Long Xu King after a short while.

His appearance caused an uproar in the cultivators inside the Battle Fortress.

“It’s Palace Master Wushuang!”

“Palace Master Wushuang accepts the challenge!”

“Hum, let’s see how miserable that Long Xu King will be.”

Numerous Dao Masters started to expect what would happen next.

In the Void—

“Long Xu King?” Jian Wushuang said in a cold voice.

He was shocked when getting close to Long Xu King.

“His Killing Intent is so horrible. He doesn’t seem like a human, but more like a killing machine.”?Jian Wushuang thought.

Wave after wave of coldness surged out of Long Xu King’s eyes as Jian Wushuang showed up.

“You are that Jian Wushuang? Just a Dao Master?” Long Xu King asked in a cold tone.

“Yes, you’re right. But it’s sufficient to kill you with my strength.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Hum, how arrogant you are!” Long Xu King sneered and said, “I have followed my monarch to go to wars for nearly 10 million years and have killed uncountable Universe Masters. I have even encountered three Invincible Universe Masters during these years!”

“And I fought all of them face to face!”

“I won every battle and have even directly killed two of them!”

“You, however, are the fourth expert that I’ve encountered who possesses the battle strength of an Invincible Universe Master!”

“Show me all your strength. Or else you will follow in the footsteps of the other two Invincible Universe Masters!”

Long Xu King stressed every word. His voice reverberated throughout this space and even traveled to the Battle Fortress.

The expressions of the experts in the Battle Fortress changed as they heard those words.

“Long Xu King is an Invincible Universe Master as expected!” Tang Emperor said coldly.

“Besides, he must be one of the strongest Invincible Universe Masters. If what he has just said is true, his strength must be quite terrifying. I wonder whether Jian Wushuang could fight him head-on.” Samsara Temple Master had a worried look on his face.

The other Palace Masters also felt oppressed.

If Jian Wushuang failed in this challenge, the morale of the experts in the Green Fire World must degenerate greatly.

In the Battle Fortress, many experts of the Green Fire World became quite.

“Jian Wushuang.”

“My third brother!”

Emperor Xiao, Emperor Yun, and Jian Wushuang’s three good brothers all gathered there, clenching their fists tightly and staring at that Void.

“My Junior Brother!”

Jian Wushuang’s three Senior Brothers—Xue Lingtian, Purple Mountain, and Bai Hu also stayed at a corner of the Battle Fortress.

They were all Dao Masters, so they naturally join the Green Fire Palace. Over the past 80 years, they had several reunions with Jian Wushuang indeed.

And another three figures stood not far away from them.

They were the Sect Masters of the Firmament Territory’s three magnates.

The three Sect Masters had come into contact with Jian Wushuang. Back them, Jian Wushuang lived in the Firmament Territory and he was merely a little boy in their eyes. They had not expected to see him becoming an expert who they should look upon after thousands of years.

Though plenty of high-level experts of the Green Fire World gathered in this Battle Fortress presently, Jian Wushuang was their real spiritual backbone.

How about these three Sect Masters?

They were just normal soldiers in this war.

As a result, they could not help sighing for being fooled by the fate.

At another corner, Empyrean Patriarch stood there and had mixed feeling as he looked at the figure at the end of his line of sight.

“Jian Wushuang, you have killed my son and are my sworn enemy. I wish to peel off your skin and drink your blood! However, today’s war determines the life and death of the Green Fire World. I hope you could win!”

“Win!”

“You have to win!”

“Palace Master Wushuang, you must win!”

Numerous experts of the Green Fire World shouted in their minds.

In that Void, Jian Wushuang’s expression was peaceful, but he could not relax his vigilance for any moment.

His eyes rolled slightly and glanced at the Battle Fortress behind him. It seemed that he could see the expectant faces of many cultivators through the Restrictions.

He took a deep breath and lifted his head again. There was a touch of firmness in his eyes that had never been seen before.

“I must win this challenge, and it has to be a nice victory!”

“Let’s fight!”

Jian Wushuang screamed out and the Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand.

“Haha… Even my monarch appreciates your supper talent, so come and let me see what are you capable of!” Long Xu King burst into laughter.

Then, he took a huge step forward.

The Void under his feet immediately turned into powder as he unsheathed the blood-red saber on his back.

“Blood Shadow Dao!”

Long Xu King’s thunderous shout shook the heaven and earth. The blood-red saber in his hand transferred into a horrible, blood-red Blood Shadow.

It seemed to have come from the hell and could destroy everything into ashes.

Boom~~~ The heaven and earth turned dark. With unstoppable Killing Intent, the Blood Shadow locked Jian Wushuang up completely.

“A unique skill?” Jian Wushuang was a little bit shocked.

Long Xu King unleashed a unique skill for his first attack and its power was absolutely out of the ordinary.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang snorted and also stepped forward. At the same time, he held his Blood Mountain Sword up high.

The whole heaven and earth became totally dark.

Darkness and quietness reigned this area.

Suddenly, a flash of sword light shone. It was so dazzling that it seemed like the Dawn Light.

It was another unique skill—the Dawn Light!

Jian Wushuang directly swung his blade at his foe.

One unique skill was facing the other!

A flash of sword light and a blood shadow collapsed fiercely.

The impact of this collision could be compared with the clash of two fixed stars.

Bomb!

A booming sound resounded throughout this area, as if the heaven and earth cracked.

At the center of the collision, space was totally torn into pieces like scraps of papers, spreading around 100 miles away immediately.

The effective range of this collision got involved in a space storm.

The space storm contained a horrible shearing force, which could easily tear Dao Masters or even Celestial Masters into dust.
