Chapter 2479: Shell

Boom~

In the Sword World, Fan Jianxian was its dictator.

The infinite sword essences that filled up the surroundings suddenly pressed towards Jian Wushuang in a frenzy when he directed with his finger.

The kind of pressure was different from those of regular domain secret techniques.

Regular domain tactics only suppressed the opponent’s abilities by limiting his speed and etc. However, Sword World’s pressure was a kind of oppression.

The type of oppression imposed directly on the opponent’s body and mind with a huge deterrence effect.

With the Sword World’s oppression, Jian Wushuang felt an uncontrollable fear deep in his heart. That fear had caused him to have great trouble gathering divine power, sword essences, and using various tactics. Due to that reason, his abilities had decreased in an instant.

Especially on his sword techniques.

If a sword cultivator was oppressed by the Sword World, the effects on him would be strengthened.

However, at the same time he was being oppressed by the Sword World, a thought came to Jian Wushuang.

‘This feeling...doesn’t feel right.’

This Sword World...’

Jian Wushuang began to scrutinize and investigate the Sword World.

“Die, kid!”

Fan Jianxian did not leave any leeway for Jian Wushuang’s investigation. As soon as the Sword World started oppressing Jian Wushuang, he appeared right away.

The infinite ocean of sword essence suddenly retreated to the side following the sound of great waves while Fan Jianxian who was standing in between them completely turned into a sharp blade that could pierce through the Heavens.

He ignored all obstructions and pierced through the void.

“End by Emperor!”

Whoosh!

An overbearing sword essence swept up. It felt so natural for Fan Jianxian when he issued that strike since he was the dictator of that Sword World after all.

A terrifying sword shadow appeared out of thin air, as it seemed it was going to cut open space.

Every object that it passed through was dissolved.

All the cultivators surrounding the battlefield were completely captivated by that incomparably domineering and overbearing sword shadow. Their eyes grew wide from shock.

Watching the domineering sword shadow cutting towards him, Jian Wushuang squinted before releasing a surging of explosive divine powers from his body.

While forcing himself to endure the Sword World’s oppression, Jian Wushuang raised his Blood Mountain Sword once again and swung it.

His sword’s plain swing did not cause any effects to the void in front of him.

Everything was incredibly calm.

However, it was in such calmness that a traceless sword shadow suddenly slashed open the void.

Ring!

A huge sword-light appeared.

It looked as though the sword-light had connected both Heaven and Earth. It was extremely bright and blinding to the eyes.

When it appeared, it had become the focal point of Heaven and Earth.

It even became eternal.

The various sects’ experts who were scattered around the battlefield could not help but be mesmerized by the sword-light.

The strike was so beautiful!

Throughout the oceans and wilderness, Heaven and Earth Aligned!

The incomparably domineering sword shadow made contact with the sword-light and became the eternal Heaven and Earth.

BOOM!

With a huge rumble, the terrifying impact of residual energies began to spread maniacally. Heaven and Earth were shaking along with the sword essence ocean that filled every corner. It seemed like all of them could not withstand the incredible collision. The sword essences which were surrounding both of them also began to falter.

After the collision... Whoosh!

A figure embarrassingly dashed outwards.

The dash sent him to the sword essence ocean’s edge before he would barely stop his momentum.

That figure was none other than Jian Wushuang.

Under the Sword World’s great oppression, he was at an obvious disadvantage during the clash.

Even so, Jian Wushuang did not show any signs of disappointment. On the contrary, he wore a happy smile. “I see, Fan Jianxian! I’ve overestimated you!”

Jian Wushuang’s laughter was resonating between Heaven and Earth. “I was shocked as I thought the Sword World you unleashed was a complete one. However, it seems that the Sword World you formed was only a shell of the actual thing. Although it contains a few oppressive functions, it’s still a far cry from the real Sword World!”

“I had felt it was impossible you possessed that kind of sword principle understanding and you have proven so now. You simply haven’t reached the level of Sword World. In fact, you’re still pretty far from it. My guess is, you have personally experienced other sword experts displaying their Sword Worlds to oppress you, hence you learned to build a shell of it all by yourself.”

Fan Jianxian’s face turned stern and said coldly, “Even if it’s just a shell, it’s still enough to oppress you!”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang smirked.

Ring ring!

An extremely strong sword essence suddenly rose from Jian Wushuang’s body. The sword essence began sweeping violently in every direction, pushing away the infinite sword essence ocean around it.

As it got pushed away, the suppression effect on him had decreased quite a bit despite Jian Wushuang still somewhat being oppressed by it.

“I’m not going to waste time on you any further, let’s decide who’s the victor now,” said Jian Wushuang coldly.

“Come at me then. Why? Do you think I’m afraid of you?” Fan Jianxian showed no fear. He was a well-respected Ultimate God with extremely overpowered abilities and had absolute confidence in his ‘Sword World’.

Boom!

Fan Jianxian suddenly took a big leap.

As he leaped out, the infinite sword essences focused at a single point.

Fan Jianxian’s eyes were projecting a thick light of essence. The green-colored long sword in his grip had lashed out.

Broom boom boom~

Heaven and Earth turned dark as the void around them trembled and rose up.

A gigantic green-colored sword shadow began enlarging in front of everyone’s eyes, covering both sky and sun. In the end, it shrouded half of the void.

Infinite god powers and sword essences gathered within the green-colored sword shadow.

As the green-colored sword shadow appeared, all those sects’ experts looked desperate.

“That’s way too strong!”

“That energy was unbelievably strong.”

“With energies as such, this might be Fan Jianxian’s strongest strike.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Many were exclaiming in awe.

Yes, the strongest strike.

Fan Jianxian had unleashed his maximum abilities as the number one sword cultivator of Wusha Wilderness.

As the overbearing green sword shadow was forming, Jian Wushuang only smiled faintly. His right hand which gripped on Blood Mountain Sword tightened up slightly. Surging divine powers were swiftly charging into the sword.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang also raised his divine power to his limits.

He had become a Perfect Chaotic Creature when he advanced from the Chaotic Realm to Second-Class Divine Demon, during which his divine powers were refined from his transcendence and morphing. In addition, the divine powers in his Primordial Void Celestial Body had also been increased.

When he completely unleashed his divine power, Jian Wushuang would not be weaker than a regular Ultimate God. In fact, he even felt that his divine power could be slightly stronger than regular Ultimate Gods.

Due to that fact, he had held back his divine power and only unleashed 70% of it when clashing with Fan Jianxian a while ago.

However, he was currently unleashing 100% of it.
