Chapter 3014: Secret Technique Upgrade

——

“When I broke through in Blood Dipper City, it caused quite a commotion. The experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom will definitely notice it. They might even guess that I’m the person they’re looking for. After that, they’ll definitely send a large number of experts to search around Blood Dipper City…”

“Although I have made a breakthrough to become an Immortal Saint and my strength has greatly increased, I haven’t improved my secret skill and my battle strength hasn’t reached its peak yet. It’s still not a good time to face them head-on. I still have to hide for a while.”

Jian Wushuang thought quickly. “I have no choice but to go underground.”

After making up his mind, Jian Wushuang directly rushed into the depths of the underground.

Now that he had reached the Immortal Saint realm, he was much more eye-catching than before. If he wanted to hide, he could only do so underground.

He hid 500 miles underground and tried his best to hide his aura.

“I deliberately hid my aura. If the Magic Note Divine Kingdom sends a large number of experts to search for me, they will still find me, but it will take time. During this time, my secret skills should have been improved.”

Jian Wushuang smiled. Deep underground, he had begun to improve his secret skills.

He had cultivated several powerful secret skills.

Among them, seven-star secret skills, divine punishment, nine luminaries star armor, exquisite pagoda, and the archean void body all had room for improvement.

The first thing Jian Wushuang needed to improve was seven-star secret skills.

There were three volumes of the seven-star secret skill.

He had cultivated the second volume, but the effect of the second volume was greatly reduced after reaching the Immortal Saint realm.

Now, he needed to comprehend the third volume of the seven-star secret skill.

The third volume was much more complicated than the second volume.

If Jian Wushuang had not broken through to the Immortal Saint realm, he would have had to spend a little effort to comprehend this volume. However, now that he had reached the Immortal Saint realm, his comprehension speed had also increased a lot.

It only took him half a month to completely comprehend and cultivate the third volume.

“Let’s try it first.”

Jian Wushuang was looking forward to it. He exerted the star power in his body, which was much more vast than before, with all his strength.

Once he exerted it, the divine power aura in his body instantly surged.

The divine power aura, which was originally an ordinary first rank True Saint, was now rising at an alarming speed. Soon, it reached the peak of the first rank True Saint realm. Moreover, the divine power aura did not stop but continued to surge, finally, it reached the limit of the first rank True Saint. It gradually calmed down when it was about to reach the threshold of the second rank True Sint.

At the same time, the strength of Jian Wushuang’s divine power suddenly rose to a whole new level!

“It suddenly rose from the first rank True Saint to the limit of the first rank True Saint.” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes slightly. “As expected, even the third volume can only rise by half a level after becoming the Immortal Saint.”

The seven-star secret skill was one of the five most powerful secret skills in the seven-star mysterious sect. It was indeed powerful.

However, no matter how powerful the secret skill was, it would still be limited.

When he was a Divine Master, the limit was still very small. He could rely on this secret skill to increase his cultivation by one level. However, when he reached the level of an Immortal Saint, it was almost impossible for him to increase his cultivation by one or two levels.

Even if he only increased his cultivation by half a realm, it was already very terrifying.

The seven-star secret skill could allow an Immortal Saint to increase his cultivation by half a realm.

Do not underestimate this half a realm. When he reached the Immortal Saint realm, even if he only increased his cultivation by half a realm, it was enough to greatly increase his strength.

“Before, I felt that my divine power was already much stronger than that of a rank three True Saint. Now that I’ve used the seven-star secret skill, my divine power has increased again. I wonder if I can be on par with a rank four True Saint now?” Jian Wushuang thought.

The improvement of the seven-star secret skill was just the beginning.

Then, Jian Wushuang began to improve the two secret skills, the punishment divine realm and the nine luminaries star armor.

He had long reached the third level of the punishment divine realm, condensing a 30,000-meter-tall Golden Emperor Phantom.

However, after reaching 30,000 meters, the Golden Emperor Phantom seemed to have reached a bottleneck. It did not improve for a long time and remained at 30,000 meters. But now…it took Jian Wushuang 10 days, the 30,000-meter-tall Golden Emperor Phantom had increased by three times!

It was originally only 10,000 meters, but now it was 30,000 meters. Naturally, its power had increased dramatically!

As for the nine luminaries star armor, the nine luminaries star armor of the treasured armor chapter could increase his attack power by six times!

But now, as he broke through to the Immortal Saint realm, he could cultivate the heavenly armor chapter!

The armor of the heavenly armor chapter was black-gold in color, but it increased Jian Wushuang’s attack power by nine times!

It took Jian Wushuang two months to complete the heavenly armor chapter.

Finally, the exquisite pagoda and the archean void celestial body also improved Jian Wushuang greatly after a period of time.

In just four months, Jian Wushuang’s many secret skills had reached their limits.

His battle strength had truly reached its peak!

…

In the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, countless experts were still frantically searching for Jian Wushuang.

Before they found him and killed him, the area had been sealed by the dragon-trapping compass.

In this area, one could only enter, but not leave.

There were only two passageways to enter this area, and many experts of the Magic Note Divine Kingdom were guarding them.

In front of one of the passageways, there were a total of ten figures from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom guarding it. These ten figures were all Immortal Saints, and there were even three True Saints.

Sou!

A figure suddenly streaked over from the distant void and quickly appeared in front of the passageway.

It was a blood-haired, blood-robed man. After he arrived, he frowned as he looked at the experts from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom.

“What’s going on? Why is this territory completely sealed?” The blood-haired, blood-robed man had a puzzled look on his face.

As for the ten experts from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom, they all locked their gazes on the blood-haired, blood-robed man. They could tell from the aura emitted by the blood-haired, blood-robed man that he was a Peak False Saint.

“Who are you? What are you doing in this territory?” One of the True Saints asked coldly.

“My name is Xue Dong. I came to this territory alone to look for a junior of mine. Furthermore, I came here a thousand years ago. At that time, this place was not sealed.” The blood-haired man said.

“Xue Dong?” The ten experts from the Magic Note Divine Kingdom looked at each other. They had never heard of this name.

However, the Magic Note Divine Kingdom had too many territories. There were many Immortal Saints, and it was normal for some lesser-known False Saints to remain unknown.
