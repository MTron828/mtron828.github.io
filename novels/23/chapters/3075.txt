Chapter 3076: The Genius Feast

——

“Mr. Heavenly Marquis!”

As the voice rang out, five figures flew over from the void in front of Jian Wushuang and landed in front of him.

These five people were Bai Xiao and the other three genius disciples from the Dao Palace. The other Jiu Luo was also among them.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis,” Jiu Luo also called out.

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

“Mr. Heavenly Marquis, we are going to participate in the genius feast of the first heaven. Do you want to join us?” Bai Xiao said.

“Genius feast? What genius feast?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“This genius feast is jointly organized by the three pavilions, the nine courtyards, and the twelve divine sects. It’s held once every 5,000 years. Every time it’s held, countless experts in the first heaven who have reached the level of a first level True Saint will flock to it. They will compete in the feast and make a name for themselves,” Bai Xiao said.

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He had experienced too many things in his two lives. He had experienced such a genius feast many times, and he had even participated in it several times. Therefore, a genius feast like this one held in the first heaven…could not make him excited.

“You go, I won’t go,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Mr. Heavenly Marquis,” Bai Xiao said immediately, “The genius feast of the First Heaven is very large-scale. There are countless geniuses coming. Those who get a good ranking in the genius competition will not only receive a lot of rewards, but most importantly, many top forces in the Divine Beginning World will also pay attention to this genius feast. For example, the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, the Divine Ancestor Daoist Sect, and even the Mysterious Temporal Temple, as well as some sects from the Second and Third Heaven. This is a great opportunity to make a name for yourself in the Divine Beginning World!”

“Reward!”

“Reward? Famous in the Divine Beginning World?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Reward?

A genius feast attended by a first-level True Saint could only reward him with some sacred elixirs or powerful holy treasures.

He did not lack holy elixirs. He still had nine universe crystals. Any one of them could be exchanged for a huge amount of sacred elixirs, which was enough for him to use for a long time.

As for holy treasures, he did not need them anymore. He had gotten four opportunities in Blood North’s Heaven Secret Region, and Blood North had given him two special treasures.

One was an ice and fire dragon ruler, and the other was a ruler seal. The former was a domain-type true treasure, and the latter was a treasure that was worth as much as a true treasure.

Any of these two treasures could be exchanged for countless holy treasures, not to mention the map of mountains and rivers.

As for being famous in the Divine Beginning World… First of all, he did not care about such fame.

Secondly, he was targeted by the power of the will of heaven.

The three masters of the Saint Realm were looking for him at all times.

How could he go to the genius feast and make a name for himself?

He was courting death!

“You guys go.” Jian Wushuang waved his hand again. He was really not interested.

“Mr. Heavenly Marquis.” Bai Xiao’s expression changed slightly.

At this time, Jiu Luo said, “Brother Heavenly Marquis, this genius feast is indeed a rare event. There are many geniuses and experts who will attend it. I will also attend it. You just came from the endless territories and have not fully adapted to the environment of the Third Heaven. If you attend the genius feast at this time, you can really experience the level of geniuses in the Third Heaven. Even if you don’t want to participate, it’s good to see it.”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

He glanced at Jiu Luo and finally nodded after a long while. “You’re right. Although I’m not interested in this genius feast, it’s good to see it. In that case, let’s go.”

Jian Wushuang also felt that he had been in the First Heaven for 30 years, and he could not keep cultivating.

Now that he had the opportunity to broaden his knowledge, it was a good choice to go and have a look.

“Let’s set off immediately.” Jiu Luo nodded.

Bai Xiao and the others were also quite happy.

Soon, they set off directly.

…

In the First Heaven, there was a natural secret realm called the Jade Dragon Mystic Realm.

The genius feast was in the Jade Dragon Mystic Realm.

Jian Wushuang and the others had already arrived at the Jade Dragon Mystic Realm.

However, when they arrived at the mystic realm, they saw countless people.

“So many people.” Jian Wushuang looked at the countless people in front of him.

“This is too many.” Jiu Luo exclaimed.

“The genius banquet in the first heaven is held only once every 5,000 years. It’s a large-scale event. For many genius experts, this is a chance to make a name for themselves. Most importantly, this banquet will attract the attention of many sects and forces. In the past, many outstanding geniuses would proudly join those sects and forces. For example, several geniuses from the previous year joined the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces and Dao Palace.”

“Therefore, whether it’s to become famous or to join the top forces, many rank one True Saints from certain forces will come to participate in this feast. Conservatively speaking, there should be at least tens of thousands of rank one True Saints participating in this genius feast,” Bai Xiao said.

“Tens of thousands of people?”

Even though Jian Wushuang was shocked, he soon understood.

A rank one True Saint was definitely a top expert in the endless territories. In some small territories, he could even be considered a king, but in the Third Heaven, he seemed ordinary.

There were countless experts in the Divine Beginning World, so it was not a big deal for tens of thousands of rank one True Saints to participate in this genius feast.

“Mr. Heavenly Marquis, since you’re already here, why don’t you go and register like Junior Brother Jiu Luo?” Bai Xiao said.

Jian Wushuang pondered for a moment and then nodded. “Okay.”

Bai Xiao was immediately delighted.

When he saw that Jian Wushuang was not interested in the genius feast, he thought that Jian Wushuang would not participate in it. However, he still casually mentioned it.

He did not expect Jian Wushuang to agree to it now.

“It’s good that he agreed. Only if he agrees to participate in the genius feast will the plan prepared by master not be in vain.” Bai Xiao was pleasantly surprised.

Jian Wushuang and Jiu Luo had already gone to the registration place.

The registration place was in front of a towering black tower. The black tower was pitch-black, ten stories high, and exuded an ancient and mysterious aura. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, a large number of people were gathered in front of the tower. Many rank one True Saints who were going to participate in the genius feast were lining up there. Jian Wushuang and Jiu Luo followed behind them.

The process of the line was very fast. In a moment, it was their turn.
