Chapter 2113 Emperor God Liu Guang“s Surprise

“This is…?”

When Emperor God saw who had arrived, she froze before getting up. “Greetings Sword Emperor,” she bowed.

“Emperor God Liu Guang, how are you? It’s been some time since we’ve last met.”

“I’m honoured you still remember me,” Emperor God Liu Guang smiled humbly, but deep down she was conflicted.

When she first met Jian Wushuang, his powers were beneath hers. But in the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang was ranked second in the Heaven and Earth Supreme ranking list, one of the best experts amongst the Sanctuary Alliance, next to Emperor Bai!

Yet she remained a pinnacle Emperor God. Jian Wushuang was on a different level.

“Emperor God Liu Guang, I have arrived here today to repay a favour,” Jian Wushuang replied.

Emperor God Liu Guang’s facial expression changed.

Jian Wushuang indeed owed her a favour, she had simply never asked for it.

Firstly, Jian Wushuang was already too high in status, she had dared not ask.

Secondly, she had nothing urgent to request of Jian Wushuang.

Yet now, without asking, Jian Wushuang had came to repay the favour. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“This token is for you,” Jian Wushuang said nothing more, and passed it to her directly.

Emperor God Liu Guang received it, puzzled, but when she took a closer look and realised what the token was really about, she trembled.

“This is… the Heaven Repairing Palace token?” Emperor God Liu Guang’s eyes were wide open, staring straight at Jian Wushuang.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang smiled. “Your abilities and potential is pretty good, the Sanctuary Alliance wanted to place you into the list of candidates anyway. I simply gave you a push. Consider the favour paid.”

“Thank you Sword Emperor!” Emperor God Liu Guang was so grateful.

She knew Jian Wushuang was not lying.

Everyone knew the twelve seats in the Heaven Repairing Palace were not confirmed. Yet at this juncture, Jian Wushuang had given her the token directly. It may have been due to her abilities and potential, but it was also definitely because Jian Wushuang had helped her from behind.

With Jian Wushuang’s position and influence within the Sanctuary Alliance, a slight push would be more than enough to get Emperor God Liu Guang the seat.

“I shall not stay for long. When the Palace opens, I will send someone to inform you,” Jian Wushuang said, and with that he left.

Within the palace, Emperor God Liu Guang and the purple-haired lasses remained standing there. Emperor God Liu Guang had calmed down.

“Sister, this is wonderful, you were worried about that seat a moment ago, then immediately the Sword Emperor delivered it to you personally…”

“I’m surprised as well,” Emperor God Liu Guang smiled. “The Sword Emperor did owe me a favour, but I never asked for it. He came to return it on his own, with a seat in the Heaven Repairing Palace…”

“I know a little regarding this Sword Emperor. Apparently, his powers are next to Emperor Bai’s in the Sanctuary Alliance. With his status and power and influence, even if you had no potential, he could still get a position for you,” the purple-haired lass said.

“Indeed,” Emperor God Liu Guang nodded. “I was intending to hold onto this favour for when something big happened, like a crisis, but now… I didn’t really help him out much back then anyway… I should count my lucky stars for getting this seat,” Emperor God Liu Guang smiled and looked towards the purple-haired lass.

“Qing Xuan, the Palace should not take long to open. I should prepare myself during this period of time. Forgive me for taking my leave.”

“Understood,” the purple-haired girl replied. She was extremely happy for her.

Emperor God Liu Guang immediately started preparing for the Palace.

On the other side, Jian Wushuang made his way for the Red Dragon Sanctuary.

This time, he was going down personally.

…

On the huge island, the Red Dragon Sanctuary.

“Oh Red Dragon King, this Twirling Divine Serum was painfully obtained by me two million years ago, please try it.”

Emperor God Jue Xian stood before the Red Dragon King respectfully, and offered the serum.

The Twirling Divine Serum was one of the rarest delicacies of the Eternal Chaotic World, almost as good as the White Blaze Fruit.

Emperor God Jue Xian had been through much pain to obtain two pots. He had drank one pot previously, yet could not bear to drink the other. Now, he was offering it to the Red Dragon King.

“Twirling Divine Serum?” the Red Dragon King seemed indifferent, but took it anyway. He drank the entire pot in one gulp.

Emperor God Jue Xian was pained at the sight of this, but did not show it.

“Oh Red Dragon King, do you thing the higher-ups at the Sanctuary Alliance will give me the spot?” Emperor God Jue Xian asked cautiously.

Red Dragon King glared and him, and sneered, “Who knows. If it were me, I would have tortured you till you handed it over. If you refused, then I’d kill you anyway. Luckily for you, the Sword Emperor is more merciful than me.”

Emperor God Jue Xian’s face turned white, and he looked awkward upon hearing that.

“Let’s see if the Sword Emperor is willing to fight for you or not. With his power and influence in the Alliance, if he is willing to put in a good word for you, he will most certainly receive it. But Jue Xian, as an Almighty within the Red Dragon Sanctuary, here’s a piece of advice for you. Regardless of if the Sword Emperor got the position for you, you must pass him your Soul Attack secret skill, if not…” Red Dragon King’s expression turned ice-cold.

He was only willing to say all this after receiving Emperor God Jue Xian’s Swirling Divine Serum. Without it, he could not bother less.

Emperor God Jue Xian nodded, “Of course, I only hold a strand of hope regarding the seat. It does not matter if I receive it or not, I will hand over the secret skill anyway.
