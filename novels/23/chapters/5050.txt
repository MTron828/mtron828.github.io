5054 Strange Change

Chen Qing stamped his foot, his five fingers spread out, and in an instant, tens of thousands of brilliant rays burst forth.

These rays were like the sharpest arrows, tearing through the void, and rushing violently towards the Blood River Serpent.

Splatter– splatter.

Endless blood mist exploded as the Blood River Serpent opened its enormous mouth and roared.

And with this roar, Feng Shan, the mountain-like figure, escaped in a sorry state from the giant mouth.

“Damn, that was close!”

Feng Shan’s face turned pale, full of taboo, and he muttered, “What is this thing?”

Chen Qing and the others also arrived. They looked at the blood river below them and had a bad feeling.

Cui Jing held a mysterious staff and licked his lips. “Isn’t it a bit… inappropriate not to have Sword Jian here?”

“No matter, watch how I dismantle this place!” Feng Shan rubbed his hands together and roared as he charged down.

Chen Qing and Cui Jing also activated their powers and descended together.

Chun Qiu, on the other hand, looked at Gu Ting, who just woke up “This blood river…”

“This Blood River is the incarnation of Qin Tuo!” Gu Ting confirmed without hesitation. “Earlier, he transformed into the Blood River and devoured all the elders of my Guhai City.”

Wei Liujia stroked his chin, “That shouldn’t be the case. From their previous performance, the Shangjun Sect seemed quite righteous. The current blood river seems inconsistent with their behavior.”

Chun Qiu glanced at him and then said calmly, “Often, the more righteous they appear on the surface, the more sinister they are behind the scenes. Don’t be deceived by appearances.”

“That makes sense. So, what do we do next…”

“We must protect Eternal Wushuang with all our might, and, also, eliminate the root cause.”

Boom! Boom! Boom!

With the combined full-force attack of Chen Qing, Cui Jing, Chun Qiu, and Wei Liujia, the Blood Sea Serpent, which stretched for billions of feet, was directly shattered, its divine thoughts extinguished, and it miserably fell into the surging sea of blood.

The sea of blood receded, revealing the still-standing Eternal Wushuang Heavenly Palace.

But this situation only lasted for a moment, and an endless sea of blood once again surged.

This time, it was even more frenzied.

Countless serpents churned out of the sea of blood, attacking the Heavenly Palace.

At the same time, ripples appeared on the surface of the blood sea, and a dark red figure emerged from it.

His Immortal body was surrounded by an unimaginable amount of blood aura, as if he was covered in a layer of blood armor. Although this figure had changed greatly, one could still recognize him at a glance. He was the Young Master of Shangjun Sect, Qin Tuo.

At this moment, he was completely different from the one who had bid at the auction house.

Bloodthirsty, sinister, filled with some unknown prohibition, it was terrifying to the extreme.

He emerged from the sea of blood and approached Chen Qing and the others.

They all sensed the anomaly behind them and then saw this scene.

“Qin Tuo? How did you turn into this ghostly appearance?” Cui Jing frowned, clearly more disgusted with Qin Tuo.

“Something’s not right, be careful, everyone,” Chen Qing said in a low voice, then released a probing burst of Yan power towards Qin Tuo.

The violent burst of Yan power stabbed directly at Qin Tuo, who had no way to evade.

But then, he quietly raised his palm and a blood mirror suddenly appeared in front of him, completely absorbing Chen Qing’s Yan power. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Then, the blood mirror trembled and astonishingly reflected Chen Qing’s previous Yan power attack, with its power multiplied!

Chen Qing’s brow furrowed deeply, and he drew his true sword from his waist to cut off those Yan power bursts.

“This guy is indeed suspicious. Be cautious, everyone,” he said.

“Hey, junior from the Shangjun Sect, do you really intend to go against the Eternal Wushuang?” Cui Jing coldly shouted.

Qin Tuo, who was already enveloped by the sea of blood, revealed a sly smile at the corner of his mouth. “What does Eternal Wushuang Heavenly Palace amount to? Dare to speak to me like this?”

“Well, then, today, I’ll just exterminate all of you.”

As soon as Qin Tuo said this, an endless sea of blood surged, crashing toward Chen Qing and the others.

“Humph, petty tricks,” Feng Shan shouted, and then his celestial body suddenly doubled in size, covered in a crimson aura, like a true divine mountain. He thundered against the sea of blood.

Rumble…

Feng Shan’s figure only existed for a moment, and it was actually swallowed up and absorbed by the surging sea of blood.

Chen Qing’s expression changed slightly, and without thinking, he shouted, “Retreat, there’s something wrong here.”

“We can’t retreat, the Eternal Wushuang Heavenly Palace is just behind us!” Chun Qiu said in a deep voice. “Feng Shan is also in danger; we mustn’t retreat!”

“Then let’s open a path of blood!” Cui Jing held his black staff and rushed forward without any hesitation.

The sea of blood surged and roared as it surrounded them.

With Chen Qing as the leader, Chun Qiu, Cui Jing, and Wei Liujia all charged towards the blood sea.

The full-powered attack of the four Yan Immortals tore open a crack almost instantly.

But what awaited them was not Qin Tuo, but a world that seemed soaked in blood, everything in sight bathed in crimson.

“Where is this place?” Cui Jing said, puzzled.

“I’m afraid we’ve fallen into Qin Tuo’s trap,” Chun Qiu frowned.

Wei Liujia’s eyes lit up. “Feng Shan is ahead!”

Following his pointing finger, they saw that the mountain-like Feng Shan was now lying in the bloody mess, its fate uncertain.

Wei Liujia did not say anything more, he went straight to assist.

“Liujia, don’t go!” Chun Qiu shouted urgently, but it was a moment too late.

A sudden change occurred. Feng Shan, which had been lying in the bloody mess with an unknown fate, suddenly disappeared.

In its place, thin bloodlines, as thick as fingers, shot out from the ground and rapidly attached to Wei Liujia’s Immortal body.

In an instant, they pulled him directly into the river of blood, and he disappeared completely.

Because all of this happened in an instant, when they tried to rush to his aid, it was already too late.

Chen Qing stepped forward, angrily shouting, “You damn b*stard, hand them over, or we’ll go to the Shangjun Sect and kill all of you, none of you will survive!”

A soft laugh, with a hint of mockery, echoed in this blood-red world without warning.

“Truly noisy. Today, none of you will survive, that’s for sure.”

Qin Tuo, wrapped in the river of blood, quietly appeared, like a blood-red sun, hanging high in the sky, surrounded by Blood Qi.

Endless beams of Blood Qi descended, rapidly devouring all their Immortal powers.

He raised both arms, and blood-red diamond-shaped mirrors appeared all around him.

In each mirror, there were reflections of Chen Qing, Chun Qiu, and Cui Jing, their figures and faces distorted to the extreme.

Chun Qiu’s expression changed slightly. Then, he seemed to realize something and hurriedly looked at his Immortal body.

His Immortal body was already covered in a faint layer of blood mist, and as time passed, it gradually solidified.

The same situation occurred on Chen Qing and Cui Jing.

Chun Qiu’s expression became solemn. “Have you felt it? The Yan power within us is dissipating.”

Chen Qing and Cui Jing nodded simultaneously, then they all looked towards Qin Tuo in the void.
