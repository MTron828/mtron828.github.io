Chapter 1120: Three Elixirs!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Humph!”

A snort came with mighty aura. Like a storm, it stopped many experts.

Clad in gold armor, a middle-aged man stood in the center. There was a red thunder-shaped mark on his forehead. He held a double-edged giant ax, surrounded by crimson clouds like a War God.

In his other hand, it was the deep purple elixir, Nirvana Elixir.

“Damn it!”

“He’s got it!”

“He’s got the first Nirvana Elixir.”

Celestial Masters of Green Fire Palace all gritted their teeth at the sight of this.

Jian Wushuang felt regretful as well.

The elixir had stopped at a distant place. The moment he reached there, the fight was already over. It fell into the hands of the middle-aged man.

The man who carried a Giant Axe was a Celestial Master in Exceptional Realm from the Jin Kingdom. He was actually more capable than the strong elder that Jian Wushuang had fought.

He had got hold of the elixir, and no one dared to mess with him. After all, none of them was confident to kill him.

“It’s just the first one of the six Nirvana Elixirs.”

Green Fire Palace experts comforted themselves and looked back at Dan Xin Palace.

In the Void of the temple, floated the remaining five elixirs. Subsequently, a streak of purple light flashed, then, two deep purple lights shot out.

Following the first one elixir, two more elixirs were thrown out in different directions. One of them stopped near Jian Wushuang.

“Grab them!”

Jian Wushuang darted directly to the nearby Nirvana Elixir.

As the elixir flew out of the Restriction, a nearby Jin Kingdom expert rushed forward, trying to take it.

However, a sharp long spear that seemed to crumble the world emerged out of the blue.

“What is that?” An exclamation escaped the expert.

He was just a medium Celestial Master, but the long spear had come from a Celestial Master in Exceptional Realm. Moreover, the spear had been very fast. The expert was extinguished before he could act.

Then, a giant hand grabbed the Nirvana Elixir. The Flowing Light died down, and a figure appeared.

It was a slim young man, dressed in bronze armor, which was emitting a mighty aura. Apparently, he was wearing a strong protective treasure.

“Celestial Master Green Wolf!” With a hearty smile, Jian Wushuang appeared in the nearby Void, carrying his Blood Mountain Sword.

“Jian Wushuang?” The young man was another Celestial Master in Exceptional Realm. He smiled. “The Jin Kingdom experts won’t let me off easily, help me.”

“Understood.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

Although coveted, they soon withdrew in face of Jian Wushuang, Celestial Master Green Wolf, and other helping Green Fire Palace Celestial Masters.

Boom!

In a distant Void, an overwhelmingly strong power burst out.

In the Void, Dark Celestial Master was pushed backward carrying her two longspears. In front of her was a plump bald teenager. He held a golden machete with immense killing intent.

“Celestial Master An, unfortunately, you can’t beat me!”

The bald teenager shouted as he put a Nirvana Elixir into his Interspatial Ring. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Celestial Master An’s face went red with anger but did nothing.

There had been many experts from both palaces for the elixirs. But generally speaking, the Jin Kingdom was better. They had sent four Celestial Masters in Exceptional Realm, and the bald teenager was the only one she feard.

She fought him and lost. Her elixir was also taken.

“Well, at least we get one.” Celestial Master An let out a sigh of relief, looking in the direction of Jian Wushuang and Celestial Master Green Wolf.

There had been three Nirvana Elixirs, and they at least got one.

If they had not gotten anyone, that would be a total failure.

“There are three left. I believe they’ll be throwing out at the same time. We’ll get two of them at least.” Celestial Master An snorted coldly.

With two more Nirvana Elixirs, they would obtain the half of the six, which was reasonable.

“The last three!”

On the battlefield, all of them were staring at the remaining floating Nirvana Elixirs, with eyes wide open.

Then, as expected, all three of them were thrown out at one time.

They were shot in the same direction!

Both camps were stunned!

“Three in on direction?”

“All of them?”

“That means we can three at one time!”

The present Celestial Masters were all agitated and rushed in the direction of the three elixirs.

A scarlet-robed figure was standing in that direction.

When he saw the three Nirvana Elixirs were darting toward him, Jian Wushuang was shocked too.

Among the previous three elixirs, the first one was too far away and he did not even get a chance; the second and third one shot out together. He managed to help Celestial Master Green Wolf obtain one of them.

But never did he expect that the last three all darted toward him.

Shocked, Jian Wushuang still managed to open his palm and caught the three streaks of purple Flowing Lights.

He was holding the three Nirvana Elixirs.
