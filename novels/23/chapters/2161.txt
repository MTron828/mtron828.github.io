Chapter 2162 Compromise

Jian Wushuang had no grudges against the Ancient Blood Tribe and, naturally, he did not want to provoke them.But the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds the Ancient Blood Emperor posed great importance to the Eternal Chaotic World. Jian Wushuang needed to get to the bottom of it.

Jian Wushuang had to be more forceful about it.

The Ancient Blood Emperor remained quiet.

The Ancient Blood Tribe contained thousands of people, each of them comparable to a Middle Stage Chaotic Realm expert. They had nine Peak Chaotic Realm experts as well. Coupling himself, a Third Stage expert, the Ancient Blood Emperor’s forces were formidable.

Still, he had no confidence that he could slay the human in front of him.

If the human indeed planned to slaughter his people every day, there would be nothing the tribe could do.

The Ancient Blood Emperor could only make a compromise.

“Human, if I am not wrong, you are not friendly with the people at the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds, right?” Ancient Blood Emperor asked.

“Indeed,” Jian Wushuang did not deny it.

“Hngh, you humans do fight a lot,” the Ancient Blood Emperor said coldly. “I can bring you to the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds on the condition that you do not harm anyone in my tribe.”

“Rest assured, as long as they do not initiate the attack, I will not do anything,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Follow me.”

Without saying much, the Ancient Blood Emperor made his way deeper into the Ancient Blood Forbidden Grounds.

Jian Wushuang followed.

The Ancient Blood Emperor brought Jian Wushuang through miles and miles of forest, and after taking almost the entire day, they finally made it to the deepest part of the Ancient Blood Forbidden Grounds.

“There, that’s where the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds are,” Ancient Blood Emperor said.

Jian Wushuang looked up to get a good look of the region in front of him.

The region was masked by a thick crimson fog. What surprised Jian Wushuang was a thin crimson layer around the surrounding Void. Without a doubt, that was a formation.

“There’s a formation here. Could they be here?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

Ancient Blood Emperor continued, “The Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds were taken over by you humans a long time ago. Although our territory lies right beside the Sanctuary Grounds, we have made a pact to never step into your grounds, and vice versa.”

He could tell that the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds were indeed a gathering spot for human experts. There should be a space tunnel linking the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds and the outside domains.

The Three Emperors World experts could access the Ancient Blood Forbidden Grounds without trespassing the Ancient Blood Tribe grounds.

As the Eternal Chaotic World made its move against the Three Emperors World experts, the experts had escaped to the Ancient Blood Forbidden Grounds. A hidden Space Tunnel that led to the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds existed near the surrounding Void, Jian Wushuang simply was not able to locate it, and instead stumbled his way into the Ancient Blood Tribe’s grounds.

“The Ancient Blood Forbidden Grounds is the Three Emperors World’s top Forbidden Grounds. I did not expect their experts to open up Sanctuary Grounds here,” Jian Wushuang could not help but be amazed.

He guessed that only the highest ranks and Great Emperors of the Three Emperors World knew about the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds.

The Sir Gods and Emperor Gods most likely were unaware.

Only after the raid on the Three Emperors World did their leaders decide to open the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds for the experts to hide.

“Now that I have found their hiding spot, the rest is easy,” Jian Wushuang smiled and asked Emperor Jiu Qiao inside his Blood Mountain Sword to report to Emperor Bai.

“The experts were indeed hiding at the Ancient Blood Forbidden Grounds!” Emperor Bai was elated after receiving the news.

“Finally, we found it,” Ancestor Tian Chen heaved a sigh of relief.

They had been searching frantically throughout the entire Three Emperors World for the remaining experts. At last, they had found it.

Since the location had been made known, the next course of action was to send in the army.

“Jiu Qiao, let Jian Wushuang know that I will bring the Eternal Chaotic World army over to the Ancient Blood Forbidden Grounds. For before that can be done, he must settle it out with the Ancient Blood Tribe,” Emperor Bai glanced at Emperor Jiu Qiao.

“Understood,” Emperor Jiu Qiao nodded.

He relayed the message to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang was in a dilemma.

He knew that the Eternal Chaotic World army needed to go through the Ancient Blood Tribe’s territory in order to reach the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds.

But if they ran into some friction with the Ancient Blood Tribe…

That was a tribe with a Third Stage Great Emperor, nine First and Second Stages, and a thousand Emperor Gods.

Even the Eternal Chaotic World forces would need to fight their way through. It would not be an easy fight.

“Ancient Blood Emperor.”

Jian Wushuang looked towards the Ancient Blood Emperor with a warm smile on his face. “I have a favour I hope you would be gracious enough to grant me.”

“My people will reach the Ancient Blood Forbidden Grounds soon. They will definitely need to pass by your grounds, so… I hope you will do us a favour and grant us safe passage,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Your people?”

“Looks like another fight’s about to break out within the Ancient Blood Forbidden Grounds,” Ancient Blood Emperor said coldly.

“Yes, and it will be ugly, a fight to the death. Certainly, the Ancient Blood Tribe wants nothing to do with the fight?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

Ancient Blood Emperor thought for a while and nodded. “I will grant you a safe passage for your troops towards the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds. I don’t want my people getting involved in this.”

“I will get them to control themselves. My people will not spill any of your peoples’ blood. I dare not promise about the people at the Blood Emperor Sanctuary Grounds, however,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Ancient Blood Emperor glanced at Jian Wushuang silently.

“Emperor Jiu Qiao, tell Emperor Bai to bring the forces in,” Jian Wushuang instructed.
