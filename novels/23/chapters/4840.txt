4842 One Battle

However, Prince Jiu did not seem to have any intention of making things difficult for Jian Wushuang. Instead, he looked at Jian Wushuang with interest.

Then, he slowly stretched out his palm. “Give me 50 pills and I’ll let you go.”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed slightly. 50 Emperor-grade pills were nothing much to him. Even if it was 500, he could still take them out. After all, before he came, Chun Qiu had prepared nearly 1,000 elixirs with different effects in his storage ring.

Jian Wushuang could easily hand out 50 pills, but he did not intend to hand over any of them.

Based on Prince Jiu’s character, it was impossible for him to let them go once they handed it over. On the contrary, he would get himself into trouble.

Hence, Jian Wushuang was ready to fight. “I don’t know what pills you are talking about, so I can’t give it to you.”

It was obvious that Prince Jiu had expected this answer. His tone was neither hurried nor slow, as if he had already made up his mind. “My Great Mi Heaven has already been heavily guarded. It’s almost impossible for outsiders to enter. I think you must have come in from the North Sky Heavenly Region.”

“Now that the North Sky Heavenly Region has been sealed, I’m afraid you have no way out.”

As he spoke, extremely strong lights came from all directions and surrounded Jian Wushuang and Di Qing.

With just a glance, Jian Wushuang guessed that there were nearly 100 Yan Immortals, and his face turned grave.

Nearly 100 Yan Immortals were probably all the forces under Prince Jiu. It was an unimaginably terrifying force.

Even Jian Wushuang, who had comprehended an Immortal Style, could not resist such a force.

However, with Di Qing’s help, he believed that it was still possible for him to escape unscathed unless Prince Jiu had a Grand Yan Immortal under him.

As if to confirm Jian Wushuang’s guess, 2 mysterious figures, wrapped in large black robes and without any aura of Yan power, descended.

His eyes narrowed. The two mysterious figures in front of him had the same aura as the 2 Grand Yan Immortals who had fought with Di Qing in the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture.

2 Grand Yan Immortals!

“My guests, if you insist on leaving without leaving anything behind, I’m afraid you won’t be able to bear the consequences.”

Prince Jiu shrugged his shoulders slightly. His gaze suddenly turned sharp. At the same time, an extremely dark True Swords condensed in his palm.

With a total of close to 100 Yan Immortals, 2 Grand Yan Immortals surrounding them was unimaginable.

This was the first time Jian Wushuang had faced such a tyrannical situation since he came to the Great Yan Domain. It also made him realize how terrifying Prince Jiu’s foundation was.

Then Di Qing’s voice was transmitted into his divine sense, “Fight or retreat, I’ll with you no matter what.”

“I understand.”

A huge burst of Yan power suddenly burst out. As his black robe fluttered, Jian Wushuang raised his arm and a vast Heavenly Gate broke the chaotic sky like a brilliant sun.

The Heavenly Gate slowly opened, and a giant finger fell from it.

All the Yan Immortals were stunned. Even Prince Jiu’s eyebrows twitched. He had never expected that the two of them would dare to make the first move in such a situation.

“Hmph, you really don’t know how the word ‘death’ is written!” he said coldly as he pointed the pitch-black sword forward. “Cut off their limbs and capture them alive!”

All of the Yan Immortals moved, but they did not charge forward. Instead, they dodged the attack from the sky.

The Transcendence Heavenly Gate was an Ancestral Skill. As Jian Wushuang’s comprehension became deeper, his exploration of the Ancestral Skill also reached its peak.

Although the Ancestral Skill was still effective, it was already showing signs of fatigue against Yan Immortals. If the user was not Jian Wushuang, the effect would be greatly reduced.

The first form — Transcendence Heavenly Gate caused the four Yan Immortals who tried to resist to explode their Immortal Source and die, while a number of them were seriously injured. It successfully caused some chaos in the encirclement.

Di Qing immediately rose to his feet and faced the two black-robed Grand Yan Immortals directly. His palms seemed to be pushing forward, but they contained the full power of a Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal.

Seeing this, the two black-robed Grand Yan Immortals also moved to block.

In an instant, hundreds of millions of rays of light burst forth from the confrontation, and an unparalleled explosion swept out.

Di Qing still stood in the same place, but the two Grand Yan Immortals took a step back at the same time, their eyes under the black robe showing disbelief.

His hands, which were hidden under the black robe, were trembling uncontrollably!

Prince Ji, who was originally watching the battle, was also shocked when he saw the scene. “He managed to hold back two Grand Yan Immortals with just one strike. Who is he?”

Di Qing’s face was filled with disdain. Two mere Grand Yan Immortals actually dared to resist him?

“All of you, stay. It’s been a while since I killed a Grand Yan Immortal.” He stretched his muscles and looked ahead indifferently.

The battle had completely erupted!

With one sword attack, Jian Wushuang was like a ghost. His body was extremely sharp. With the Invisible Longsword in his hand, he seemed to enter no man’s land. Even when he was surrounded by nearly 50 Yan Immortals, he was not afraid.

He carried 10,000 tons on his shoulders, and his sword pushed back 1,000,000 tons!

He was proud. With the support of the Undying and Imperishable Immortal Body, he could recover in a very short time no matter how serious his injuries were.

There was one thing about his Immortal body that Jian Wushuang had never told anyone, which was that he had no Immortal Source.

The so-called Immortal Source was similar to the Dantian. It was the foundation of the myriad bodies and the Great Dao of cultivation. It was condensed after the top cultivation achieved the position of Yan Immortal. It was extremely important.

However, Jian Wushuang did not have the so-called Immortal Source. The Undying and Imperishable Immortal Body that was transformed from a Perfect Life Form had nothing in it.

This had its advantages and disadvantages.

The good thing was that he had nothing important to guard against. The bad thing was that he was extremely insensitive to the Great Dao of the Great Yan Domain due to the lack of an Immortal Source, so he could only explore slowly.

After destroying a Yan Immortal’s Immortal Source, Jian Wushuang struck out with his palm again, expanding the encirclement.

At this point, the encirclement formed by nearly 100 Yan Immortals and 2 Grand Yan Immortals was actually showing signs of collapse!

Prince Jiu pressed on the hilt of his sword and frowned. He had never thought that these two uninvited guests would have such terrifying strength.

“Damn things, whose messengers are they?!”

“Could it be that they were sent to kill me?”

Prince Jiu’s heart trembled as he suddenly thought of Prince Mo, who had died a tragic death in the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

After he thought of this layer of connection, he became even more unsettled.

The 2 Grand Yan Immortals, who were originally regarded as trump cards, were now being forced to retreat. It was only a matter of time before they were defeated.

“Since you’re here to kill me, then be prepared to face the consequences.” The look in Prince Jiu’s eyes grew even colder.

The void began to collapse under the pressure of this battle. After the initial panic, the first group of Yan Immortals began to work together and counterattack.
