4136 Ruins

In the Divine Hall.

“Jian Wushuang, you’re the only one left.” Ruler Blood Wave sized Jian Wushuang up and his eyes lit up. He could naturally tell that Jian Wushuang had reached the fourth-level Ruler realm.

This little guy’s breakthrough was really fast.

After looking away, Ruler Blood Wave knew that it was not the time to reminisce about the past. He suppressed what he wanted to say and introduced the elder sitting in the main seat. “Let me introduce you. This is Ruler Gai Fu.”

“Ruler Gai Fu, Ruler Blood Wave, and Supreme Giant Axe.” Jian Wushuang immediately bowed with respect in his eyes.

Among the three, Ruler Blood Wave and Supreme Giant Axe were the most powerful.

As for Ruler Gai Fu, he had heard that he was the oldest and most powerful Supreme-being among the five lead Rulers in the Life Palace.

“Take a seat.” Ruler Blood Wave waved his hand and glanced at all the special life forms at the Ruler level in the meeting hall, he said calmly, “There are many Ultimate Rulers in the Life Palace, but most of them have the battle strength above that of a Supreme Ultimate Ruler.”

Although Ruler Blood Wave’s words were calm, everyone present felt nervous.

Jian Wushuang was even more excited.

It was obvious that the people gathered by Ruler Gai Fu were all Supreme Ultimate Rulers. More than 20 of them were Supreme Ultimate Rulers, but he was only at the fourth level.

Logically speaking, he should not have been present at this gathering, but Ruler Blood Wave had specially summoned him.

“Since everyone is here, let’s get straight to the point.” Ruler Gai Fu’s eyes turned cloudy. “Ten thousand years ago, an ancient ruin was discovered in the stellar domain. All of you should have heard of it. Hundreds of chaos cycles ago, an unrivalled Ruler perished in that place. There were many fortunes left behind by that unrivalled Ruler.

“At the time, the Life Palace sent out a team to search for fortunes. However, not too long ago, something happened to one of our teams!”

“Something happened?” As soon as Ruler Gai Fu finished speaking, the many Omega Rulers in the meeting hall were all shocked. The entire hall instantly erupted into chaos.

“Didn’t they say that only cultivators below the Ruler level can enter the ancient ruin? And that there’s no danger there?”

“That’s right. The team sent by the Palace of gods to search for good fortune in the ancient ruins was led by Zhufeng King, who is virtually invincible amongst Omega Rulers. In any case, nothing should happen to him unless an Ruler appears.”

The many Omega Rulers present all frowned.

They all knew a thing or two about the ancient ruins. It was said that hundreds of chaos cycles ago, the place where the famous and invincible Ruler Tarot had fallen.

Most of them had heard of Ruler Tarot’s reputation. Back then, he had been quite famous and was one of the most powerful figures in the entire universe. He had personally established the Tarot Divine Kingdom, and it was one of the Rulers of the universe, in terms of power, the Tarot Divine Kingdom was much stronger than the many divine kingdoms in the current universe.

However, for some unknown reason, Ruler Tarot, who had been at the peak of his power, had offended a Supreme figure. Not only had he perished, even his own divine kingdom had been wiped out by someone.

An unrivalled Ruler and a divine kingdom...what sort of treasure was this?!

Even after hundreds of chaos cycles had passed, there had still been people who had not given up on searching for Ruler Tarot’s final resting place in the universe. Just thinking about it, Ruler Tarot’s status as an unrivalled Ruler could be imagined, he definitely had an astonishing amount of wealth. Other than that, he was also the Ruler of a divine kingdom!

Ruler Tarot held all of the resources of the divine kingdom in his hands.

No one knew if the resources of the divine kingdom had been buried alongside Ruler Tarot when the divine kingdom had been wiped out.

It could be said that this was an opportunity that even Rulers would be envious of.

Thus, ten thousand years ago, when the place where Ruler Tarot had perished appeared in the universe, countless people went crazy over it. The entire universe was in an uproar!

Quite a few Rulers and even unrivalled Rulers were alarmed. They all made their moves and rushed toward the ‘Tarot Ruins’.

However, to their disappointment, this ‘Tarot Ruins’ actually had an incomparably powerful restrictive spell planted within it that only cultivators below the Ruler level were allowed to enter. Any Ruler who entered.., would suffer an enormous backlash.

Even unrivalled Rulers were helpless against this restrictive spell. If they were forced to attack, the ancient ruins would be destroyed by itself.

As a result, the top powers of the universe had no choice but to send out their Supreme Rulers to enter the ruins and fight for the opportunity left behind by Ruler Tarot.

As one of the top powers in the universe, the Life Palace naturally wouldn’t fall behind. They sent out a squad that was made up entirely of Omega Rulers, led by the virtually invincible Zhufeng king.

Zhufeng King was a creation-level lifeform, and he had developed nearly 80% of his innate advantages. His divine power was over a thousand times stronger than that of ordinary cultivators, and he had a certain level of comprehension toward the principles of the universe. Without an Ruler coming out.., logically speaking, no one should be able to do anything to him. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Not too long ago, the palace received a distress call from Zhufeng. However, before the palace could respond, Zhufeng’s message was cut off. Afterwards, the palace attempted to contact the other Rulers of the squad, but none of them responded. It seems that the squad has already met its end. Zhufeng is most likely dead,” Ruler Gai Fu said.

As soon as these words were spoken, the entire meeting hall was in an uproar.

The Ultimate Ruler squad was completely annihilated?

Even the Zhufeng King had fallen?

Huff huff huff huff.

Heavy breathing sounds could be heard from within the Divine Hall. At the start, these Ultimate Rulers had only treated the ruins as a piece of fat cake that they could plunder. But now, they could not help but feel a chill in their hearts.

Zhufeng King had died inside, and not a single one of the Ultimate Rulers present felt confident that they could defeat him.

Furthermore, at the level of an Ultimate Ruler, even if they could defeat him, killing him was a completely different matter.

Ruler Gai Fu took in the expressions of everyone in the meeting hall, but his expression did not change at all, he said calmly, “This matter regarding the Tarot Ruins is of great importance. The treasures and opportunities contained within are enough to attract the attention of any power in the universe. The Life Palace will never give up, which is why I plan to send a squad of Rulers from the palace into the ruins to find out what is going on with Zhufeng King and the others.”
