2232 Why the First Era Collapsed Part I

“It’s it!”

Jian Wushuang could not help but clench his fists as a fit of rising anger surrounded him.

“Jian Wushuang, have you come across this Black Water Dragon?” Emperor Bai asked.

“Of course I’ve seen it.” Jian Wushuang watched Red Dragon King via a projected image as he fought the Black Water Dragon furiously. The Black Water Dragon was massive, constantly spitting out cold air, easily freezing Almighties upon contact.

Jian Wushuang could not help but recall the years when he had been in the deepest parts of the Buddhist Demon Sea.

There, he had seen the exact same black dragon!

“Since the Black Water Dragon appeared, the Ancient Era expert behind it has probably awakened as well, and lurking around the Red Dragon Sanctuary, “Jian Wushuang murmured.

“Jian Wushuang, you mean there is an Ancient Era expert behind the dragon?” Emperor Bai frowned.

The black water dragon in the projected image was terrifying – no one other than strong Third Stage Great Emperors could have engaged it. Now, there was an Ancient Era expert behind the dragon?

“Emperor Bai, I’ve seen it, I know where it comes from,” Jian Wushuang started describing his experience.

“Buddhist Demon Sea?” The dragon?” Emperor Bai was shocked.

“As far as I know, there are at least two Ancient Era experts in slumber within the Buddhist Demon Sea. One of them is One-Star Man, likely from the Seven Star Black Sect. He’s indebted to me, he would not hurt the Eternal Chaotic World even if he did awaken. But another person, the owner of the Black Water Dragon, from the Seven Star Black Sect’s opposing camp is there too. From how the dragon behaves, I don’t think the person’s friendly,” Jian Wushuang said.

Emperor Bai nodded subtly.

“Colored Glaze encountered a suspected Ancient Era expert previously, then one at Red Dragon Sanctuary, then three more you encountered yourself... looks like a lot of Ancient Era experts are awakening,” Emperor Bai said.

“Indeed, because they all received a transmission. 3,900 years later, someone will open a link passage at the Heaven’s Horizon for them to return to Absolute Beginning Divine World!” Jian Wushuang said.

“Absolute Beginning Divine World?”

“Looks like you know everything,” Emperor Bai looked at Jian Wushuang and could tell he had been aware of it for quite some time already.

Jian Wushuang nodded.

“Absolute Beginning Divine World, the beginning of everything,” Emperor Bai sighed. “The link to the Absolute Beginning Divine World will finally be re-opened again?”

“Hmm?” Jian Wushuang’s gaze moved. “Emperor Bai, you mean the link had been opened once before?”

Emperor Bai fell quiet for a moment and nodded. “Indeed, a long time ago, during the First Era. It happened at Heaven’s Horizon as well.”

Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank.

“Jian Wushuang, as you know, I was from the First Era, but did you know how the First Era collapsed?” Emperor Bai asked.

Jian Wushuang shook his head consciously.

He knew why the Ancient Era had collapsed from Jian Er, it was due to Absolute Beginning Divine World’s various sects attacking Seven Star Divine Realm, leading to the collapse of that.

But Jian Wushuang never knew why the First Era had collapsed.

“Does it have to do with the link passage at the Heaven’s Horizon?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, that link passage,” Emperor Bai said.

“In the First Era, after the link passage opened at the Heaven’s Horizon, there were no Ancient Era experts that woke up. But on the other end of the passage, from the Absolute Beginning Divine World, a large group of experts came barging in.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“What?” Jian Wushuang was shocked. “You mean, there were experts from the Absolute Beginning Divine World in the First Era?”

“Yes,” Emperor Bai paused, and said, “The link passage closed the moment they arrived, and they started slaughtering the First Era.”

“Slaughter?” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened.

“Jian Wushuang, you should know why the Ancient Era collapsed, and how this land came to be!”

“The land we are on now was originally part of the Seven Star Divine Realm.”

“Although the Seven Star Divine Realm has collapsed, it is undeniable that this land came from the Seven Star Divine Realm, and we are cultivators born from the Seven Star Divine Realm!”

“When the experts from the Absolute Beginning Divine World attacked the Seven Star Divine Realm, they wanted all Seven Star Divine Realm cultivators dead.”

“Why would the experts from the First Era let us off the hook?”

“They wanted to wipe every one of us from the First Era out, then link up with the other experts at the Absolute Beginning Divine World to destroy the formation. They would wake all the Ancient Era experts up and kill them all, wiping out the Seven Star Black Sect completely.”

Jian Wushuang’s gaze turned cold.

Wiping away all traces of the Seven Star Black Sect and the Seven Star Divine Realm... Jian Wushuang was amazed by the ruthlessness of those experts.

“The First Era was much more powerful than the Second Era, and experts then could naturally sense the enemy’s purpose, so... the war began,” Emperor Bai continued.

“Experts that came from the Absolute Beginning Divine World were minimally Chaotic Divine Demons. Luckily, the restrictions on this earth were placed upon them as well, and only then were the cultivators of the First Era able to put up a fight.”

“That battle took five days and five nights. Jian Wushuang, you would not be able to imagine how terrifying that fight was, way worse than the one we had with Three Emperors World.”

“Especially at the end, cultivators ignited their souls or self-imploded, regardless of cost, all to defeat the enemy, and that led to decimation on both sides.”
