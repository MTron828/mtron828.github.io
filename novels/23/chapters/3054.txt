Chapter 3055: Three People

____________

Two of the four rank one True Saints were killed and two fled in the blink of an eye. When the other two fled far away, Jiu Luo put his blood-red saber back into its scabbard with a smug smile on his face.

“Brother Heavenly Marquis, how is it?” Jiu Luo looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Impressive.” Jian Wushuang gave Jiu Luo a thumbs up.

He was not lying. Jiu Luo was also a rank one True Saint, but he had killed two experts of the same level in the blink of an eye. His strength was indeed extraordinary. Although he was still inferior to the monsters in the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, he was still a real genius.

“Lord Jiu Luo.”

The False Saints in the group immediately walked over.

“We thank Lord Jiu Luo for helping us. If Lord Jiu Luo hadn’t sent those four away, I’m afraid those four would have slaughtered us as well.”

“That’s right. Those four are True Saints. Previously, slaughtering eleven False Saints was as easy as playing around. Slaughtering us would definitely be very easy.”

“Thank you, Lord Jiu Luo. You saved our lives.”

The False Saints were all extremely grateful.

Jiu Luo just smiled casually and did not care about it.

“Right, why did those four kill us?” Someone suddenly asked.

“From their conversation, it seems that there is a sect called the Blood Evil Sect nearby. and the way they recruit experts is to let those experts kill the Immortal Saints in the specific territories around them. Only after killing twenty Immortal Saints can they become a member of the Blood Evil Sect!”

“Bastard!”

“We have no enmity with the Blood Evil Sect. How dare they send people to hunt us down!”

“Isn’t that right?”

The team was a little angry, but there was nothing they could do no matter how angry they were. In the end, they could only sigh in their hearts. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“I’ve long heard that the bone region is extremely chaotic. There are all kinds of killings everywhere. It seems that it’s true.” Jian Wushuang sighed in his heart, “The Blood Evil Sect doesn’t sound like a benevolent sect. They opened the mountain to recruit experts, but they actually asked these experts to compete in the number of Immortal Saints around them.”

“Let’s continue to set off, but we have to be careful. According to the four people just now, there should be many people wandering around this area, trying to kill us.” Jiu Luo said.

Everyone nodded and immediately continued on their journey.

This encounter made everyone in the group even more cautious. However, Jiu Luo had also displayed astonishing strength during this encounter, the False Saints in the group felt much more at ease when they thought about having such an expert in their group.

…

This was a huge mountain range.

The mountain range was endless.

At the bottom of one of the mountains, there was a group of buildings. Within this group of buildings, there were many concealed and extremely powerful auras.

In the air near the mountain range, three human figures were gathered there.

These three people, two men, and one woman, all emitted auras that had reached the first level True Saint level.

“That group of buildings is one of the Blood Crow’s strongholds?” A deep voice came from the mouth of the muscular man who was over two meters tall and looked like a mountain. The muscular man was half-naked, his thick arms and muscles were exposed, and his hands were wearing a pair of blood-red golden-rimmed gloves.

The aura coming from the blood-red golden-rimmed gloves was also very powerful. It was an incomparably powerful sacred treasure.

“It’s here.” A black-haired devilish youth beside him revealed a devilish smile. “The three of us came out together to carry out this mission. It’s been almost three years now. The first three ring missions have taken us quite a bit of effort, and now we’re only missing the last ring mission. The sooner we complete this mission, the sooner we’ll return and report back.”

“Okay.” The mountain-like muscular man nodded. “Mirage Water, check carefully first. Make sure that the experts in this stronghold are the same as the information we’ve got.”

The one called Mirage Water was the only woman among the three. She wore a white robe and her expression was cold. Although she was not absolutely beautiful, she was quite beautiful. After hearing the muscular man’s words, Mirage Water nodded slightly, immediately, a vast and mighty spiritual force covered the mountain in front of them.

A short moment later…

“We have investigated clearly. There are over thirty True Saints in this stronghold. There are a total of four rank three True Saints, eight rank two True Saints, and the rest are all rank one True Saints. The three rank three True Saints that we are going to kill are all in this stronghold,” Mirage Water said.

Hearing these words, the muscular man’s expression sank. “According to the information we obtained previously, there should only be three rank three True Saints in this stronghold. Now that there are four of them, it’s a little troublesome to have one more.”

It was indeed a little troublesome.

The lineup of this stronghold was already extremely tyrannical. Now that there was another rank three True Saint, there were four rank three True Saints staying there. If the three of them wanted to make a move, there would be a certain level of risk.

“What should we do? Don’t tell me we should wait here and wait for that rank three True Saint to leave?” The demonic youth said.

“Wait?”

“It’s not that you don’t know what the Blood Crow Organization does. They rarely go out and move about. Most of the time, they stay in their nest or stronghold. If we foolishly wait here until they come out, how long will it take?” The muscular man’s voice was low, “There’s nothing we can do. We can only give it our all!”

“Mirage Water, if your methods are a little strange, then it’ll be a little more difficult for you. At the start, you’ll have to deal with the two rank three True Saints while the evil master and I will deal with one rank three True Saint each. We’ll think of a way to kill the two rank three True Saints in the shortest amount of time and then come back to help you kill the other two.”

“No problem, right?”

The muscular man stared at the demonic young man, ‘Evil Master’, and Mirage Water.

The two of them looked at each other and then nodded.

The three of them instantly came to an agreement.

But if outsiders were to hear their conversation, they would definitely be shocked.

One had to know that the three of them were only rank one True Saints, and they were threatening to kill a rank three True Saint?

Moreover, there were not only four rank three True Saints in the stronghold, there were also eight rank two True Saints and a dozen rank one True Saints. However, when the three of them were assigning their targets…they did not even mention these rank two and rank one True Saints. It was as if these rank one and rank two True Saints were like air to them. They would not pose any obstruction to them.

“Let’s do it!” The muscular man’s gaze focused as he took out a scarlet pearl of light.

The scarlet light instantly covered the sky and earth, covering the mountain range in front of them and the surrounding area.

A huge restriction had already taken shape.
