Chapter 3130: Mind Wizard

——

Seeing that Jian Wushuang was about to leave, Long Lu wanted to catch up with him at once. However, Jian Wushuang was extremely fast. Moreover, Jian Wushuang had released the ice and fire domain, which pressed down on him crazily, reducing his speed sharply, he could only follow far behind Jian Wushuang.

That’s right, he could not stop Jian Wushuang at all. He could only follow far behind Jian Wushuang to ensure that Jian Wushuang would not leave his sight.

“Damn it, I didn’t expect this junior, who is only a rank three True Saint, to be so difficult to deal with. Previously, in the battle, because of the rank six True Saint of Holy Feather sect, I could not kill him. But now, without the obstruction of the rank six True Saint, I can’t do anything to him alone.” Long Lu kept cursing in his heart.

“I have no choice. I can only follow him and kill him when Elder Xin Wu arrives.”

Long Lu had already reported Chu Yixiao’s death to the higher-ups. The Purple Cloud Pavilion naturally would not ignore the death of a genius disciple.

Furthermore, Chu Yixiao was the personal disciple of Elder Xin Wu.

The Purple Cloud Pavilion was also a great sect that was located in a Mystic Realm.

This sect was even more powerful than the Young Divine Sect. There were many experts in the Purple Cloud Pavilion, and there were even a few rank seven True Saints. It was also known that the Purple Cloud Pavilion had a True Principles Master, because of this, the Purple Cloud Pavilion could be called one of the overlords of the First Heaven!

Within the large sect, a group of over ten Purple Cloud Pavilion disciples formed a guard as they walked around in the air.

Everything was originally calm, but suddenly… Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Several figures suddenly rushed over from the distant air. In the blink of an eye, they swept past the group of guards and headed toward the Purple Cloud Pavilion’s teleportation passage.

Each of these figures had an extremely violent aura. This was especially so for the person in the lead, whose killing intent shook the heavens and earth.

The ten-odd disciples of the guards were all greatly shocked when they saw this scene.

“What’s going on? Did something happen?”

“The person in the lead seems to be Elder Xin Wu!”

“It’s Elder Xin Wu. Look at his aura. It’s so violent, and his killing intent is shocking!”

“I’ve received news that Chu Yixiao was killed while he was adventuring outside!”

“Chu Yixiao? Isn’t that Elder Xin Wu’s personal disciple? No wonder Elder Xin Wu is so furious. He is very protective of his own shortcomings.”

“Keke, Elder Xin Wu is not only extremely powerful, but he is also extremely ruthless. Even in our Purple Cloud Pavilion, no one dares to offend him. Now that someone has killed his personal disciple, I really sympathize with that person.”

The disciples of the guards were chatting idly.

Of course, they only dared to say this because Elder Xin Wu and the others had already left. If they were to beat them to death in front of Elder Xin Wu, they would definitely not dare to say a single word.

Elder Xin Wu and the others had already taken the Purple Cloud Pavilion’s spatial tunnel and disappeared into the Purple Cloud Pavilion.

…

In the vast void, Long Lu was walking forward. At the end of his line of sight, there was a figure.

That figure was, of course, Jian Wushuang.

“As expected, Elder Xin Wu has come here personally. Now, as long as I can follow that kid and don’t let him out of my sight, Elder Xin Wu can kill him personally when he arrives.” Long Lu stared at Jian Wushuang at the end, but he was also very nervous.

Chu Yixiao was killed by Jian Wushuang in front of his eyes, which was already a big mistake for him. If he did not kill Jian Wushuang immediately and take revenge for Chu Yixiao on the spot, he would be even more guilty. But now…if he let Jian Wushuang escape from his sight again and let Jian Wushuang escape completely, his crime would be unforgivable.

If Elder Xin Wu did not see Jian Wushuang, he would definitely kill him immediately.

“Don’t let him escape!”

Long Lu clenched his hands.

He had been following Jian Wushuang to make sure that Jian Wushuang was always in his sight. However, this situation did not last for long before Long Lu’s expression suddenly changed.

“This kid, the direction he’s going…”

Long Lu had been paying attention to his position and had been transmitting his position to Elder Xin Wu.

However, when he followed Jian Wushuang to his current position, he sensed a hint of something.

“There aren’t any particularly powerful sects or forces in front of this kid, but there’s a Mystic Realm of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance…” Long Lu frowned.

There were many Mystic Realms of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance in the Divine Beginning World.

Many of them were not actually secret. They were already completely open and well-known.

In the First Heaven, there were several nests of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance that were completely open. Long Lu also knew about these nests, and it just so happened that Jian Wushuang was heading in the direction of that realm.

“Does he want to go to the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s realm and take the space passage in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s realm to leave directly?” Long Lu’s expression immediately changed.

There was a space passage in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s Mystic Realm. Moreover, the space passage was in all directions and could lead to all corners. As long as one could afford to pay the price, they could directly go to the endless territory from the Mystic Realm.

If Jian Wushuang really had such a plan, it would be difficult for them to kill him.

“Elder Xin Wu, Elder Xin Wu…” Long Lu immediately sent a message to Elder Xin Wu who was rushing over.

When Elder Xin Wu found out that Jian Wushuang was heading to the Mystic Realm of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, he immediately flew into a rage. “Bastard, no matter what, and no matter what price you pay, you must not let him escape to the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s lair. Otherwise, you will die!”

“I, I…” Long Lu panicked, “Elder Xin Wu, that kid is very difficult to deal with. I can’t stop him at all!”

“Even if you can’t stop him, you have to. Even if he really enters the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s lair, you must not let him use the space passage to leave!” Elder Xin Wu’s voice was cold.

“But I’m not an official member of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. I don’t even have the right to enter that lair. Unless, unless I don’t care about the consequences and use some means to temporarily seal the space around the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s lair so that the space passage inside the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s lair is ineffective,” Long Lu said in a deep voice.

“Seal the space and time?” Elder Xin Wu’s expression changed, and a trace of hostility flashed in his eyes. “Yes!”

Long Lu was stunned, and his face turned pale, “Elder Xin Wu, that’s the Heaven-cleaving Alliance. Although it’s just one of the nests, it still represents the face of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance and directly seals the space and time around the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s nest. This, this…”
