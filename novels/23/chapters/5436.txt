Chapter 5436 ¬†Transformation Paths

The power of All Things, power of Devouring, and Thought power.

The three revolved around his body.

The power of All Things was still fine. It was the force of heaven and earth.

The power of Devouring was different. Not only was it the destruction in the black hole, but it was also the evil aura that devoured all living beings.

Compared to others, Thought power was stronger.

These were enough to shock ordinary cultivators.

Walking at the forefront, Tongtian Buddha and Zhen Wuyang also saw Jian Wushuang's name. Tongtian Buddha knew little about Jian Wushuang, but Zhen Wuyang was delighted.

Seeing Jian Wushuang here meant he was still alive, and this time, he could bring Jian Wushuang back to the Grave God Mountain.

Situ Nan of the Elder Palace felt a glimmer of joy in his heart. When he came here, he received a notification from above that he would encounter the missing Jian Wushuang and was entrusted with delivering a jade slip to him.

He had not found Jian Wushuang for such a long time. He thought that Jian Wushuang had died and did not expect him to hide so well.

Apart from Jian Wushuang, there was another person‚ÄîBroly.

The former had received orders from Zhen Ling, while the latter had received strict orders from Wu Zuo.

When he arrived, he prioritized searching for Broly. After finding him, he had been observing him in secret.

Wu Zuo had kept Broly's situation a secret and had only given a simple description to Situ Nan, instructing him to find this person in the Earth Realm.

Unexpectedly, they encountered him here.

¬†It was quite lucky. Now that they had also found Jian Wushuang, it could be considered hitting two birds with one stone. Returning this time would fulfill his mission.

However, Wu Zuo sought something even greater‚Äîa cultivator of the Transformation Dao, and not just any, but a native Emperor from the Four Great Secret Realms. Once handed over to Zhen Ling, it would be a tremendous achievement. The Elder Palace might have to make an exception and appoint an additional Palace Lord.

Jian Wushuang did not know that his appearance would surprise so many people.

The passage to the Soul Dao inheritance was as unremarkable as it was when they arrived.

However, the Transformation Dao had some novelty to it.

Every step he took on the staircase led to a transformation in his cultivation Dao.

With the inherent understanding of All Things and all Daos from the Origin Source, he moved the fastest, perhaps even faster than Broly.

The staircase of the Transformation Dao was still quite short, totaling only 10,000 steps.

In just a quarter of an hour, Jian Wushuang had ascended 100 steps, surpassing even the last person.

The speed behind him did not decrease as he continued to charge forward.

Soon, he was in the top three, surpassing Chishui.

"This?"

Chishui's heart trembled. The person in front of him looked familiar, but he couldn't recall ever seeing them in this place before.

After entering the Qishen Temple, he had encountered so many things and people that it was hard to remember them all. The millions of cultivators in the Chishui Hall, initially familiar, had become a blur in his memory. Many had been selectively forgotten.

Therefore, he did not care too much and continued walking forward.

Jian Wushuang walked fast enough, but he still couldn't see Broly.

He could now see the first 2,000 stone steps clearly. He had already walked 4,000 steps, but he still couldn't see Broly. Broly had already walked at least 6,000 steps.

In other words, the other party had transformed into 6,000 types of Origin Dao.

This was too terrifying.

Jian Wushuang, who cultivated the Dao of All Things, could comprehend the transformation of myriad ways, but why did Broly have this ability?

Jian Wushuang pondered for a moment and began to understand.

When the old man with the goat horns went back to find someone, he was probably looking for Broly.

To be able to make the goat-horned old man turn back without caring about anything, it must be an order from Wu Zuo or Zhen Ling.

If it was Zhen Ling, he probably go personally.

It was most likely Wu Zuo's order.

The fact that the disciple of the Qishen Temple cared so much indicated that the Transformation Dao was more formidable than Jian Wushuang had imagined.

One of the kings in the Three Kings Court practiced the Dao of Transformation, illustrating its uniqueness.

Jian Wushuang continued forward, and each transformation on his body became more pronounced.

From the simplest common Dao to extremely complex synthesized Origin Sources, such as the fusion of water and fire to form a Yin-Yang pathway, or reaching the limit of destruction and turning his body into a black hole.

After each transformation, Jian Wushuang carefully pondered the mysteries within.

All things are unique, and one can transform all things.

Jian Wushuang had to break through the mysteries one by one and comprehend them repeatedly. He had to be foolproof in his cultivation.

The intricacies of it all required Jian Wushuang to unravel each one, to contemplate repeatedly. In cultivation, one had to achieve perfection without any room for error.

The elevation of the Extreme Dao demanded just that ‚Äì an understanding of the rules inherent in everything.

All things, all tribulations.

Jian Wushuang recalled Xuan Yi's secret scripture on myriad tribulations.

What seemed uncomplicated initially became more apparent as he delved deeper.

The trials within all things were far from simple, akin to the karmic tribulation he carried.

At the culmination of each path lay a tribulation, much like the karma and killing tribulation he bore due to his past actions. ƒêiscover nùíÜw chaptùíÜrs ùíên n0ùíóe(l)biùíè(.)com

It was intense, affecting his fate energy. Thus, he needed to resolve it before the integration of the Dao, transforming it into auspicious fate energy.

Otherwise, it would truly become a tribulation of slaughter.

Compared to the Transformation Dao, the Soul Dao path was smoother.

The road of the Soul Dao was an extraordinary secret method, with each stage involving contemplation.

Once one grasped its essence, they could proceed unimpeded.

Two paths: the Soul Dao and the Transformation Dao.

The Three Kings Courts should represent three kings, so why were there only two paths?

Jian Wushuang was perplexed.

He remembered the red-faced old man.

A pawn!

That peculiar memory helped Jian Wushuang understand.

On that unique chessboard, he integrated all things and ultimately defeated the old man.

From the chessboard, he gained a new understanding of All Things.

Compared to these two paths, that chessboard might hold more potential for his advancement.

Three kings.

Jian Wushuang wouldn't settle for seeking guidance from just one; he intended to push the limits of all three paths.

Only then could he obtain the true core inheritance of the Three Kings Courts.

How long had it been?

Since entering the vast Great Desolate Wilderness, every inheritance had placed him in a subordinate position, denting his confidence.

Regardless, this time, he was determined to obtain the Three Kings Courts' inheritance.

He had a vague understanding of the Dao Merge, but he wasn't prepared for anything!

He needed the opportunities in this place to help him reach his limits and reach the Dao Merge.

In ancient times, the Three Kings Courts were a peak force, not much weaker than the Qishen Temple.

Anyone daring to challenge the Qishen Temple wouldn't be an ordinary powerhouse.

Advancing on both paths, Jian Wushuang continuously surpassed others.

On the path of soul cultivation, he even caught up with Zhen Wuyang.

As they passed each other, they merely nodded without much conversation.

Since their identities had been recognized, there was no need for concealment.

Looking at Jian Wushuang's figure, Zhen Wuyang felt a bit uncomfortable in his heart. The Yan Immortal he had once banished to the Great Desolate Wilderness had now grown to such an extent.

In the comprehension of soul cultivation secrets, Jian Wushuang had even surpassed him.

"Hmm?"

The rankings on the wall suddenly changed.

Emperor Tianchan was shifted away!

Jian Wushuang was also somewhat surprised. He had thought he could continue progressing as long as he had time, but now it seemed he had misunderstood; there were still requirements.
