Chapter 4019: True Strength

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Finally willing to take out a weapon?” Jian Wushuang looked at Nine Whiskers calmly.

The weapon Nine Whiskers took out was a purple long spear filled with cold air.

With the purple long spear in hand, Nine Whiskers also smiled wickedly. At this moment, he became extremely charming.

“That spear is a Principle Supreme Treasure.” Jian Wushuang’s pupils shrank.

He had fought several fourth-level Rulers along the way in the Purple Micro Galaxy, but none of them had a Principle Supreme Treasure.

!!

For example, although Ruler Mo Chen was the great leader of the Nihility Star, he did not have a Principle Supreme Treasure or magic weapon.

However, as an Ascetic Cultivator, Nine Whiskers had been adventuring in various territories and was extremely powerful. It was not strange that he had a Principle True Treasure in his possession.

“Mr. Nine Whiskers, you’ve taken out your weapon.” Ruler Mo Chen, who was watching the battle from outside the battlefield, was excited.

Back when Nine Whiskers had come to Purple Micro Galaxy and swept through many space pirate forces, he had easily suppressed them with his bare hands.

Therefore, it was the first time that Ruler Mo Chen had seen Nine Whiskers’s magic weapon. It was a long spear that had reached the level of a Principle True Treasure.

“Blood Sword, I hope you can last longer in my hands. Don’t die immediately,” Nine Whiskers said with a smile.

“I told you, you’re too arrogant.” Jian Wushuang was too lazy to argue with Nine Whiskers. The moment he saw Nine Whiskers take out his magic weapon, he had already made his move.

His speed was still extremely fast, leaving a strange afterimage in the galaxy.

His body movement burst forth, and the swift and fierce sword light slashed toward Nine Whiskers.

Nine Whiskers only raised his head slightly, and the cold purple long spear in his hand stabbed forward.

Clang!

The sound of metal colliding rang out, and the sword light dimmed on the spot. Jian Wushuang also felt that his hands were a little numb, and he kept stepping back.

“This power…” Jian Wushuang looked at Nine Whiskers in surprise.

When he had not used the magic weapon, Nine Whiskers’s divine power was already extremely powerful. It could be said that he had reached the peak of the fourth-level Ruler. But now, he took out the Principle-based treasure magic weapon and casually stabbed out! The power was nearly ten times stronger than before!

Such terrifying power was no longer within the scope of the fourth-level Ruler.

“Although the fifth-level is only at the fourth-level realm, the power of Nine Whiskers’s divine power has definitely reached the threshold of the fifth-level.” Jian Wushuang’s expression became serious.

He had fought many fourth-level Rulers, but this was the first time he had encountered a fifth-level Ruler.

Although Nine Whiskers was not a fifth-level Ruler, his power had already reached the level of a fifth-level Ruler.

“Haha, Blood Sword, take a few of my spear attacks.” Nine Whiskers let out a hearty laugh. His body flickered, and the cold violet spear in his hand was like a flood dragon emerging from the sea. Endless power gathered at the tip of the spear.

As the terrifying cold light gathered, it exploded again.

One strike after another, the power of each strike exceeded that of a fourth-level Ruler.

Jian Wushuang also relied on his superior understanding of the universe origin of sword principle to use his powerful swordsmanship to block the incoming spear.

However, Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship was indeed very high-level, but in terms of divine power, he was only at the fourth-level Ruler level. Compared to Nine Whiskers, he was indeed a little inferior.

Nine Whiskers was still very casual. He did not use any extraordinary spear techniques. He just relied on his overbearing divine power to suppress Jian Wushuang.

“Nine Whiskers is only a Ruler at the peak of the fourth-level and is not a special life form, but his divine power is indeed beyond that of a fourth-level Ruler. He must have cultivated some special divine power secret skills,” Jian Wushuang thought.

Suppressed by Nine Whiskers’s spear skills, Jian Wushuang looked a little embarrassed.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang retreated quickly and pulled away from Nine Whiskers as fast as he could.

“What? You can’t take it so fast and want to admit defeat? If so, you are disappointing me,” Nine Whiskers said in a low voice.

“Admit defeat?” Jian Wushuang smiled. “Nine Whiskers, you are indeed very strong. At least among the fourth-level Rulers I have met, you are the strongest. Therefore, you are qualified to let me use my full strength.”

“Oh?” Nine Whiskers’s expression changed. “You mean you haven’t used your full strength yet?”

A glimmer of light flashed in Nine Whiskers’s eyes.

He was an Ascetic Cultivator who loved to fight and yearned to fight with real experts.

At the beginning, Nine Whiskers did have a trace of anticipation for the battle with Jian Wushuang, but it was not too strong. After all, his own strength was too strong, there were not many fourth-level Rulers that he could take seriously.

In this fight with Jian Wushuang, Jian Wushuang forced him to take out his weapon, which was already very impressive in his eyes.

But now, Jian Wushuang said that he had not used his full strength until now? RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

This made Nine Whiskers a little excited.

“The Ruler of universe boat has not used his full strength? How is that possible?” Ruler Mo Chen was a little confused.

Jian Wushuang smiled coldly and said, “Nine Whiskers, as a fourth-level Ruler, you should be proud that you can force me to use my full strength.”

As soon as he finished his words, Jian Wushuang moved again.

He moved again, but this time, when he moved, there was a special power sweeping out.

This power was the power of principles.

That was right. From when Jian Wushuang came to the universe, including when he fought with the pirates in the Purple Micro Galaxy and even killed the two leaders in the Nihility Star, Jian Wushuang only relied on his divine power, which was comparable to the fourth-level Ruler’s, and his understanding of sword principle and swordsmanship.

Even so, he was the most extreme among the fourth-level Rulers.

He could barely fight against Nine Whiskers, who had burst out with the divine power of a fifth-level Ruler.

However, Jian Wushuang was known as an incredible genius because he had comprehended a trace of the universe principle!

He had comprehended a trace of the universe principle at the level of a Principle Ruler. Now that he had broken through to a Ruler, his comprehension of the universe principle had been constantly improving over the years because he had Rulered the Heavenly Dao will of the Divine Beginning Realm.

Until now, his comprehension of the universe principle had reached a completely new level.

The current him had truly stepped into the threshold of the universe principle.
