Chapter 1720: I Promise You

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In a crimson robe and carrying a sword on his back. The attire was really similar to He Xiu back when he was wandering.

The incoming person was Jian Wushuang.

He had arrived in the void long ago but he didn’t reveal himself. He intended to wait until the fight’s start to grab the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas during the chaos, then leave immediately.

However, he had never expected that the fight couldn’t take place. He Xiu was very careful, smart, and also mad. With him having the idea to burn himself to death together with the elixirs, no one knew what to do with him.

He had no choice and he could only come forward. Otherwise, the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas would be destroyed.

Before the experts’ gazes, Jian Wushuang appeared in the void next to He Xiu.

“You said earlier that whoever killed the King of Holy King of Real Wushu and the head of Ling Family, Ling Tianxiao, for you, you’ll give the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas to?” Jian Wushuang looked at He Xiu with a cold look.

“Yes,” He Xiu nodded heavily but the hatred in his eyes didn’t diminish.

“Besides that, do you have any other conditions?” Jian Wushuang continued to ask.

“This…” He Xiu was stunned and creased his eyebrows as he said, “If possible, bring me away from here alive, away from Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu.”

Jian Wushuang lifted the corner of his lips. He knew that although He Xiu was prepared to burn himself to death with the elixirs, he didn’t really want to die.

He was truly a God’s favored one. Unless he had no choice, why would he be willing to die like that?

“Your conditions, I promise you.”

Jian Wushuang said and turned around to look at the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu. He then walked slowly.

As Jian Wushuang walked to the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu, every expert’s face grew awkward.

“Emperor Sword…” Di Lei creased his eyebrows.

He knew Jian Wushuang. He had wanted to invite Jian Wushuang to join his team previously to fight against the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu. It was a pity that Jian Wushuang had rejected him. Then, he had thought Jian Wushuang was arrogant.

From the looks of him then, he wasn’t arrogant, simply insane.

There was no one who dared to take action against the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu but he had agreed to He Xiu’s conditions to kill the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu.

“You have guts! You killed Elder Ling Yan from Ling Family and dared to appear before me!”

There was a loud roar and the one who spoke was the head of Ling Family, Ling Tianxiao. Then, his hair was fluttering in the air and his eyes were burning with rage.

However, Jian Wushuang didn’t bother to look at the head of Ling Family and his gaze was fixed upon the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu.

“King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu, you heard He Xiu’s conditions. In order to get the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas… I’m sorry,” Jian Wushuang’s cold voice reverberated.

“Haha, there’s really someone unafraid of death,” the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu looked on in disdain. “You’re only an Eternal Real God. Just how idiotic can you be?”

Everyone at the scene looked at Jian Wushuang as though he was an idiot.

Among them there were people who could tell Jian Wushuang was only an Eternal Real God. How could an Eternal Real God be so outrageously arrogant?

“King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu, let me take care of this person,” Ling Tianxiao said in a deep voice. “He killed the experts from Ling Family. I happen to want to take revenge. I never thought that he would take the initiative to meet me.”

“Alright then. You can take care of him,” the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu smiled coldly. He couldn’t be bothered to fight against an Eternal Real God.

Ling Tianxiao smirked coldly as he spread his fierce aura and slowly walked forward.

Jian Wushuang shook his head and smiled at the sight, “Save the trouble. I can take care of you in one go.

Then, Jian Wushuang extended his hand and pointed in the direction which the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu and Ling Tianxiao were in with his right index finger.

Hong!

The sky and earth shattered.

An ancient, huge finger that gave out boundless light appeared from nowhere.

The huge finger that could destroy heaven and earth appeared and the surrounding void shattered instantly. The entire universe was shaking madly.

Ling Tianxiao was originally fueled with murderous intention but he was dumbfounded the moment he saw the huge finger.

The King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu behind him was staring with his eyes wide open too. He was terrified and he wanted to run away but he couldn’t escape in time.

Rumble. The huge finger first hit Ling Tianxiao then continued to charge forward. It pressed past the crowd then the universe calmed down.

Then ancient huge finger dispersed entirely.

Just as the finger pressed past the void, there wasn’t any figure left but only flesh that had yet to be crushed into pieces. Then, there was a strong blood smell that spread.

“This, this…”

Everyone at the scene was dumbfounded by the sight.

“Ling Tianxiao, and… the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu, died?” Di Lei stared with his eyes wide-open while he gasped a breath of cold hair.

Dead.

Yes, after one finger-point, not only did he kill Ling Tianxiao right at the front, but he also killed the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu behind him. He also killed the bunch of Real Gods that the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu that brought along with him.

The King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu had brought a total of three Chaotic Real Gods and a dozen of Eternal Real Gods. After the finger point, all of them had vanished into thin air.

Jian Wushuang did all that and he still looked like he couldn’t be bothered. He took the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu and the others’ Qian Kun ring, then his figure turned illusionary and he came before He Xiu.

He Xiu gulped. He looked at the person before him in astonishment. Then, there was an unprecedented thrill in his eyes.

“Dead! The bastard is finally dead. Ling Tianxiao, he’s dead as well!”

“They are all dead. The revenge for He Family is taken!”

He Xiu roared and there was madness in his voice. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

He had already been hopeless at first. He had had no way out so he had wanted to bet with the nine Taiqing Ancient Panaceas.

He wanted to take revenge!

As for his life, he couldn’t be bothered anymore.

However, he also knew that it was too difficult to kill the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu within his own holy kingdom. He had only had a little hope but in the end… It had really succeeded.

There was really someone who had killed the King of Holy Kingdom of Real Wushu and Ling Tianxiao before him.

“The people who you want to kill, I have already killed them for you. Give me the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas,” Jian Wushuang extended his hand and there was a certain dignity in his eyes.

He Xiu’s heart skipped a beat and he looked at Jian Wushuang with admiration and gratitude. He didn’t hesitate and passed Jian Wushuang the nine Taiqing Ancient Panaceas that he had been holding tightly in his hand.

“You have a clear view of things,” Jian Wushuang smiled. He put the nine Taiqing Ancient Panaceas into his Qian Kun ring before everyone.

If Jian Wushuang wanted to, he could totally kill He Xiu as well. The Real Gods couldn’t do anything about He Xiu and only be threatened by him. However, Jian Wsuhuang had only needed a simple soul attack to kill He Xiu in silence. He wouldn’t even have had the time to shatter the Taiqing Ancient Panaceas.

It was just that Jian Wushuang didn’t do that.
