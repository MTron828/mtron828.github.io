Chapter 1834: To Deluge Fortress

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Deluge Fortress in Abysmal Sanctuary.

In the spacious palace, there were thirteen Almighties gathered, including Fortress Master Hong Tian.

“Everyone, let me tell you the good news. Emperor God Zhen Huo has already accepted my invitation and he is already on the way here. He will arrive in Abysmal Sanctuary within three years,” Fortress Master Hong Tian looked around.

“Emperor God Zhen Huo is coming too?”

“That’s great!”

“With Emperor God Zhen Huo’s help, our team formation will be even stronger.”

The moment the news spread, the surrounding twelve Almighties were excited.

“Previously, Emperor God Long Yan accepted my invitation. In addition, there’s Emperor God Zhe Huo. It equals to the assistance of two Emperor God experts. Besides, there is a total of eight Sir Gods who have accepted our invitation too. If all of us are added up, we of Deluge Fortress will have gathered four Emperor Gods and over twenty Sir Gods by then.”

“With such team formation, we could even wipe out Soaring Heaven King Palace. We don’t have to be fearful of Lineage of Star. What we need to do now is wait patiently for Emperor Gods and the Sir Gods who accepted our invitation to arrive,” Fortress Master Hong Tian smiled and said.

As their negotiation with Jian Wushuang had failed and Jian Wushuang had said that he would barge into Deluge Fortress within ten years, Fortress Master Hong Tian and the others naturally had to be prepared.

They had been contacting their good friends and experts who shared a relationship with them to offer them rewards for them to rush over for assistance.

In merely a year, they had invited two Emperor Gods and eight Sir Gods.

“Emperor God Bing Can, is there any movement in Lineage of Star?” Fortress Master Hong Tian suddenly looked at Emperor God Bing Can.

“I already assigned men to keep watch of Lineage of Star. Besides, we also asked Vientiane Tower to watch after them as well. However, it’s weird that there isn’t any movement in Lineage of Star. Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun are back in Lineage of Star. There’s only Jian Wushuang alone… He has no fixed whereabouts. We do not know where he is temporarily,” Emperor God Bing Can said. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Humph, no matter where he goes, he will definitely be here in ten years’ time. Before that, we only have to keep watch of Lineage of Star. After all, when he comes, he definitely will make use of Lineage of Star’s power. Wait till the few Almighties from Lineage of Star or the Master of Star Palace come out from Lineage of Star, it means that they are going to launch an attack,” Fortress Master Hong Tian smirked coldly.

“I reckon Lineage of Star will definitely need to prepare themselves before launching an attack as well,” one of the Sir Gods said.

“Of course they have to prepare, but that gives us time to prepare as well. After some time, the experts that we invited will arrive and I’d like to see what Lineage of Star can do to us,” the Almighties at the scene sneered.

They assumed that Jian Wushuang would need to prepare elaborately before barging into Deluge Fortress and they also thought that he would utilize the power of Lineage of Star.

Such as the Master of Star Palace, Hall Master Gu Xin and Hall Master Nie Yun would all join the troop.

But in actual fact… The ancient silver spaceship that Jian Wushuang was driving had already arrived outside Deluge Fortress.

The ancient silver spaceship stopped in the void above as it overlooked the lofty fortress at the end. There was even a layer of faint grey film around the fortress. It was a huge formation and its power was quite strong.

“When I said that I am going to barge into Deluge Fortress within ten years in front of everyone on thunderbolt Island, I was obviously not joking. Everyone in Deluge Fortress knew that clearly. So, they definitely will have started preparing immediately. For example, they would figure out ways to invite experts over to assist them. However, inviting experts takes time too,” Jian Wushuang overlooked the huge fortress at the end of his sight.

He had also invited experts but he only invited two.

These two people were from Abysmal Sanctuary. Hence, he had only used a year’s time in total.

In one year, he believed that the experts that Deluge Fortress invited definitely couldn’t reach them so soon.

Even if one or two arrived, it wouldn’t have too much of an effect on the overall situation.

“Sword Emperor, none of the Almighties from Lineage of Star are coming. Just the few of us with a few Dao soldiers, we will attack Deluge Fortress?” Emperor God Jiu Yin found it strange.

“Why? Is Emperor God Jiu Yin afraid?” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“I’m not afraid, but I feel uncertain,” Emperor God Jiu Yin shook his head and said, “Sword Emperor, I’ll be frank. If I find things not right when the fight starts, as in there’s life-threatening danger, I will leave immediately. Although Chaotic Divine Treasure is hard to come by, it’s not worth risking my life for it.”

“Alright,” Jian Wushuang nodded, “But you have to give your all during the fight later. If your life wasn’t endangered but you left or you made a groundless retreat, don’t blame me for not recognizing your effort. You should know the outcome of being eyed by myself or my Palace Master, right?”

Emperor God Jiu Yin’s face grew grave and his heart quivered in fear.

Everyone had seen the massacre that Jian Wushuang carried out in the past. He had killed two Emperor Gods in public and his name was well known.

As for the Master of Star Palace behind Jian Wushuang, he was even scarier. Many years ago, the Master of Star Palace massacred and the sight had struck fear into many.

If he were to be eyed by the two… Emperor God Jiu Yin quivered at the thought itself.

“Don’t worry, I won’t leave until the very last moment,” Emperor God Jiu Yin said.

“That’s great,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Sword Emperor, there’s a formation around Deluge Fortress. It seems that they immediately asked someone to set it up after they knew that you were going to come. The formation seems powerful. I don’t think it’ll be easy for us to barge in,” Emperor God Liu Guang looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Let me take care of this formation,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

“Oh?” Emperor God Liu Guang and Emperor God Jiu Yin looked at Jian Wushuang in shock.

“Let me send a present to Deluge Fortress,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes grew cold and there was a scroll painting in his hand all of a sudden.

Then, Jian Wushuang threw the scroll painting into the void above. The scroll painting blended with the universe and suddenly, the sky above made a drastic change.

Vroom. Boundless aura spread across.

The sky above turned into a beautiful world. There were mountains and rivers in the world where birds sang and flowers emitted their fragrance.

The most enchanting part was the nine lofty continents in the world. Every continent was huge and boundless, and their lofty aura was shocking.

The scroll painting world moved the universe, including the nine lofty continents, above Deluge Fortress.

The strongest treasure that Jian Wushuang held, Mountain River Map, was spread open!
