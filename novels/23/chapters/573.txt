“Those monster spies spared no expense to kill him.”

“Now Crystal-armored Monster Emperor is here with such a spectacular battle formation in order to get Jian Wushuang!”

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor definitely knows that Jian Wushuang has the compass and that it is related to the Ancient World Token!”

Temple Master Iceberg’s face darkened.

In the sky, Temple Master Black Spirit and Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, who represented the supreme existences from each side, stood opposite each other.

Temple Master Black Spirit remained silent for a while before she spoke. “Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, you came for Sword Emperor’s compass, right?”

Both Crystal-armored Monster Emperor and Temple Master Iceberg were astonished.

“She already knew about it?”?

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor pretended to be calm and said, “What compass? I have no idea what you’re talking about. I just want this Sword Emperor.”

“Okay. Then I’ll give Sword Emperor to you, but I will keep his Interspatial Ring since it has many treasures inside it that are very helpful to our league,” Temple Master Black Spirit said indifferently.

“No.” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor shook his head, “I want him as well as his Interspatial Ring.”

“Hehe.” Temple Master Black Spirit laughed with a hint of irony. “Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, you treat me like a fool? You insist that you only want Sword Emperor, but you actually desire the treasure he carries. It must be the compass.”

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor furrowed his eyebrows but gave no response.

“It’s all right if you’re unwilling to confess. I don’t know what use the compass has, but I’ll figure it out.”

Temple Master Black Spirit continued and turned to glance at Temple Master Iceberg. “Temple Master Iceberg, you should know something about Sword Emperor’s compass.”

“This...” Temple Master Iceberg hesitated.

“Say it.” Temple Master Black Spirit shouted coldly. “Don’t think that I’m not clear about it. In order to get this compass, you originally intended to kill Sword Emperor on the Blood Moon Plain. If I had not arrived in time, you definitely would have killed Sword Emperor.”

Temple Master Black Spirit’s snort was accompanied by an overwhelming aura. It suppressed Temple Master Iceberg and caused him to shiver in terror.

Many human experts looked over at Temple Master Iceberg in surprise.

Temple Master Iceberg tried to kill Sword Emperor in order to obtain the compass?

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor launched an attack for the same purpose?

What’s so important about this compass? Why was it so attractive?

Temple Master Iceberg wore a complicated expression. He knew that he could no longer keep the secret about the compass, so he decided to go public with it. “That compass... Emperor Golden Snake accidentally acquired it. You all know that, because of me, Emperor Golden Snake was able to have a Life-death Duel with Sword Emperor. I had to help him because he gave me some information.”

“This information was related to the Ancient World Token!”

Temple Master Iceberg paused and looked around.

If a large stone was thrown into a lake, it would cause ripples. When he said Ancient World Token, the other Temple Masters around him all widened their eyes.

”?Ancient World Token??”

Temple Master Black Spirit was also shocked by these three words.

Temple Master Iceberg was not surprised at their reaction at all. When he received the news from Emperor Golden Snake, he also wore the same expression as these Temple Master did. Then he added, “Golden Snake told me this information and I promised to help him. However, I didn’t expect Sword Emperor to kill Emperor Golden Snake in the Life-death Duel!”

“Golden Snake sent me a message before he died. He said there was a compass in his Interspatial Ring, which is related to the Ancient World Token. If I want to get the Ancient World Token, the compass is very important, so...”

Temple Master Iceberg had not finished his words, but those Temple Masters understood why Temple Master Iceberg tried his best to kill Jian Wushuang.

They were also clear on why those monster spies had attacked Jian Wushuang.

There was no doubt that Crystal-armored Monster Emperor led his people to launch an attack for the same reason.

They did not doubt that the compass was worthy of Crystal-armored Monster Emperor’s attention.

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor, do you still want to deny it?” Temple Master Black Spirit looked over at Crystal-armored Monster Emperor.

“Hum, you’re right. I came for this compass. So what?” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor replied in an icy voice, “It originally belonged to me. 40 years ago, I was the first to find the cave mansion and this compass, but I bumped into a human emperor. He grabbed the compass using his Phantom Dao and then disappeared.”

“I spent 40 years searching for this human emperor, but he kept a low profile and never revealed his Phantom Dao. If he had not fought with Sword Emperor and used his Phantom Dao at the critical moment, I would not have known that this compass was in his hands.”

Crystal-armored Monster Emperor’s loud voice resounded through the area. Upon hearing this, many experts knew the reason why Emperor Golden Snake had never displayed his Phantom Dao.

Emperor Golden Snake must have been worried that Crystal-armored Monster Emperor would recognize him.

“Temple Master Black Spirit, I must obtain this compass. As long as you give me Sword Emperor, I will leave immediately. But, if you don’t... Then, right here, right now, we’ll have an all-out fight!” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor said in a frosty tone, “Don’t doubt my determination. I’ll spare no effort to obtain it.”

Temple Master Black Spirit’s face fell.

She knew that Crystal-armored Monster Emperor was not kidding because that compass was worthy of his effort.

“Crystal-armored Monster Emperor.” Temple Master Black Spirit remained silent for a moment before she spoke. “I will never give him to you.”

“Oh?” Crystal-armored Monster Emperor’s expression became cold.

“But as for this compass... It’s up to Sword Emperor himself. If he’s willing to hand it over to you, our human population won’t interfere. However, if he is unwilling... Then, sorry. Since he’s a Divine Emperor from our league, we’ll protect him without a doubt. As for the battle that will occur...

If you want to have a head-on confrontation, our human population might suffer great losses, but all of the monsters here won’t go unscathed either. More importantly, you will definitely die!

“Any of you Monster Kings that dare to attack our Human Territory, I promise that you won’t go back alive.”
