Chapter 2352: Increase In Cultivation Realm

In the air above Lin Mansion, a few Chaotic Divine Demons from Golden Cauldron Sect were standing in a row.

At this moment, they weren’t looking great.

“Although junior brother Xiang Yi’s soul attack is extremely powerful and could be used for both attacking and defending, the Rules of Order he has grasped is inclined towards the steady and heavy Earth Rules of Order. He shouldn’t have any issue in attacking or defending. However, he is still lacking in speed and agility. If he encounters someone who specializes in speed and has a great soul defence, he might very well lose in battle.”

“Just like we are seeing, Jian Wushuang clearly hasn’t reached the level of a Second Grade Divine Demon. Yet, he is still able to suppress junior brother Xiang Yi,” said the bald man carrying a sabre.

“Senior brother Qian Yuan, we have to think of a solution soon. If we let this carry on, senior brother Xiang Yi will be defeated. If a Second Grade Divine Demon loses to an Early Stage Chaotic Realm, it will be a great humiliation. Moreover, this might be a blow to senior brother Xiang Yi’s mentality and affect his future growth,” a Golden Cauldron Sect expert added.

“I know.” That bald man nodded and his eyes turned chillingly cold. “Forget it. I’ll kill Jian Wushuang personally.”

“Senior brother Qian Yuan?” the other experts from Golden Cauldron Sect looked over.

However, Qian Yuan had already bolted off towards the battlefield before him.

In the middle of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang was in a heated battle with Xiang Yi. Jian Wushuang was casually executing his sword technique. Even so, he was forcing Xiang Yi back constantly.

“I thought the Second Grade Divine Demon, Xiang Yi, could force me to use some of my hidden tricks. It seems like I overestimated him.” Jian Wushuang shook his head and smiled.

As for Xiang Yi, his face had turned red. He struggled to counterattack and had tried several times. Yet, it was completely pointless.

All of a sudden...

Boom!!!

A terrifying aura descended violently.

This aura was also at the level of a Second Grade Divine Demon but slightly stronger than Xiang Yi’s.

Jian Wushuang instantly understood that the other Second Grade Divine Demon from the Golden Cauldron Sect that came with Xiang Yi had stepped in.

His vast aura had Jian Wushuang completely surrounded. Immediately after, the bald man appeared behind Jian Wushuang and swung his sabre at him.

His sabre was coated in blazing flames.

As the sabre swung, the world was swallowed in flames.

More importantly, he released seven attacks in a single instant.

The seven attacks were released almost at the same time and each strike was extremely domineering.

Sensing the threat behind him, Jian Wushuang turned around immediately. A unique sword intention was released and his body seemed morph into a huge vortex capable of devouring heaven and earth.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo – Mixed Elements Spirit!

Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!

Seven intense clashes reverberated across the atmosphere. After each clash, Jian Wushuang could feel his arm going a little more numb.

After seven strikes, Jian Wushuang was sent flying.

“This strength is even greater than Xiang Yi! Xiang Yi specialized in soul attacks and manipulating the Hong Jun Divine Rod from a distance to launch his attack. However, this bald man probably specializes in close combat. His sabre skills are like blazing flames and are truly incredible.” Jian Wushuang looked over once he had stabilized himself.

“Senior brother Qian Yuan.” Xiang Yi appeared beside Qian Yuan and greeted him.

“Junior brother Xiang Yi, let’s team up and kill him.” Qian Yuan got straight to the point.

“Team up?” Xiang Yi furrowed his brows.

He would rather kill Jian Wushuang personally to avenge his sister.

However, after the previous battle, he could tell he couldn’t kill Jian Wushuang in a solo battle. In fact, Jian Wushuang could even defeat him.

If that were the case....

“Alright!” Xiang Yi nodded solemnly.

The surrounding crowd from Lin Family were flabbergasted to witness it.

“Scumbags! Two Second Grade Divine Demon teaming up against an Early Stage Chaotic Realm! Since when did the people from Golden Cauldron Sect become so shameless?” Lin Tiefeng berated.

“Shuang!” Zhuo Yunfeng stared deadly at Jian Wushuang. He could tell the current Jian Wushuang wasn’t feeling any fear or trepidation. Instead, he was still as calm and composed as ever.

If this had happened in the past, he would definitely have been extremely anxious even if Jian Wushuang displayed the same composure.

However...

“If Shuang is really what Xinqin guessed and is reincarnated from a supreme expert, the current crisis before him really won’t amount to anything.”

“Let’s hope this is the case!!” Zhuo Yunfeng could only pray in his heart.

Even Lin Tiefeng and other Divine Demon Realm experts couldn’t interfere in the battle. He was just a Half Step Divine Demon and the one facing the danger was his son. There was nothing he could do to help.

Nonetheless, Zhuo Yunfeng had got it right.

The current Jian Wushuang was fearless.

So what if there were two Second Grade Divine Demons?

“This will make things a little more interesting.” Jian Wushuang chuckled and wiggled his index finger to taunt Qian Yuan and Xiang Yi. “Both of you! Show me what you’ve got!”

“Preposterous!” Xiang Yi was infuriated.

“Brat, you are too brazen!” Qian Yuan was also a little enraged. He glanced at Xiang Yi, who was next to him, and said, “Junior brother Xiang Yi, let’s go with the coordination that we used in that perilous land previously.”

“Alright,” Xiang Yi nodded his head.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

Qian Yuan and Xiang Yi moved at the same time.

Qian Yuan charged towards Jian Wushuang while Xiang Yi retreated further back.

However, as he retreated, he controlled his Hong Jun Divine Rod to strike Jian Wushuang with compelling might.

“One close and one far. One is specialized in close combat fighting while the other controls the Hong Jun Divine Rod from a distance while using a soul attack to complement each other?”

“With two Second Grade Divine Demon teaming up and cooperating, it seems like I will have to use some of my tricks!”

In the next instant, Star Power gushed out from Jian Wushuang’s body.

His Star Power had long fused into his divine power and bloodline. Now that he was triggering them, his divine power was morphing instantly.

What others could sense was that the aura around Jian Wushuang had become visibly stronger. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Previously, he had been at the level of an Early Stage Chaotic Realm or, at the very most, the Peak Early Stage Chaotic Realm. Now, his aura was rising rapidly to the Middle Stage Chaotic Realm. From that point, he grew a little stronger before stopping.

“From Early Stage Chaotic Realm to Middle Stage Chaotic Realm. So the first scroll of the Secret Skill of Seven Star can raise half a cultivation realm? This feels pretty good!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fist and revealed a sinister smile.
