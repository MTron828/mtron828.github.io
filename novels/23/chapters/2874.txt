Chapter 2875: Realm Lord Tian Qu

——

“Humph, can you imagine my methods?” Realm Lord Tian Qu’s voice was as cold as ice, “Jian Yi, although you don’t know me, you killed my Hong ‘er. Today, I will skin you alive and tear your bones apart so that I can vent my hatred!”

“Kill me? Then I’ll give it a try.” Jian Wushuang smiled coldly, but there was no fear in his heart. On the contrary, there was a faint excitement on his face.

Yes, he was indeed excited.

Since he had broken through to the Great Divine Master level and the power of the Blood Mountain Sword had soared, his strength had greatly improved. He did not think much of ordinary Invincible Divine Masters. Even if they were extremely powerful Invincible Divine Masters, he did not have much desire to fight.

Like the Black Blood Emperor from before, he was also an unrivaled Divine Master at the second stage. However, he had only casually attacked. He had not used his full strength yet and still easily killed the Black Blood Emperor.

Right now, his overall combat strength was already at the peak of unrivaled Divine Master. Even those legendary unrivaled Divine Master at the third stage, who were extremely rare, probably could not compare to him. His strength had reached this level… he could also try to challenge the Immortal Saint.

Although he was certainly not as strong as the Immortal Saint, he really wanted to fight with the Immortal Saint. At least he had a clear understanding of the Immortal Saint’s strength.

Now, the World Master Tian Qu had come to him.

Buzz, buzz, buzz. Boundless divine power crazily swept up from Jian Wushuang’s body. The divine power gathered rapidly behind him, and in the blink of an eye, a golden emperor phantom rose to the sky.

The star power in his body had also been activated.

At the same time, a layer of dark golden armor emerged on his body.

Seven-star secret skill, divine punishment, and nine luminaries star armor were all activated.

When Jian Wushuang killed the Black Blood Emperor, he had only activated seven-star secret skills.

Now that he had used all three secret skills, his battle strength had reached a whole new level.

Especially the nine luminaries star armor, which had reached the treasured armor chapter. It was enough to increase his attack power six times!

“World Master Tian Qu, let me see how strong you are as an Immortal Saint.” Jian Wushuang was full of fighting spirit and his voice was unusually cold.

“You’re courting death!” World Master Tian Qu also shouted in a low voice. A majestic divine power gathered in his hand and he slapped it.

Boom!

The world suddenly shook.

In a flash, a towering giant palm fell from the sky. This giant palm was destructive and wanted to smash Jian Wushuang into dust.

Looking at this giant palm and feeling the extremely terrifying destructive power of the rules contained in it, Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered with a strange look.

The next moment, he drew his sword.

He drew his sword casually as if he was an ordinary person wielding a wooden sword.

However, when he drew his long sword, a sword light immediately lit up.

This sword light was extremely weak, extremely dim, and incomplete.

It was an incomplete light, a remnant light!

The eighth move of space-time swordsmanship… thousand-directions remnant light!

This was the ultimate technique created by the sword light. Under his full power, this sword light was so powerful that it seemed as if it could tear everything apart. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

When the huge palm that descended from the sky came into direct contact with this sword light, the tearing and killing power contained within the sword light, especially the Blood Mountain Sword, was too sharp!

Even a top-tier heavenly treasure-level protective armor could be sliced apart like a piece of paper, let alone this huge palm in front of him?

Hua la la~ a huge crack appeared in the center of the huge palm. This crack continued to expand and eventually, the entire palm was sliced apart by the sword light. The power of divine power filled the sky, as well as the endless destructive law energy… all of them frantically spread out towards the surrounding void.

“A Divine Master actually defeated my palm head-on?” World Lord Tian Qu looked at this scene in shock.

The difference between a Divine Master and an Immortal Saint was simply too huge. Such a difference was not something that could be easily made up for.

Even the most supreme existences amongst deities, such as the legendary Immortal Saint who had comprehended the laws and even broke through to the third stage of the saint’s absolute art, unrivaled Divine Master… amongst Divine Masters, they could already be considered the strongest. But even so, a third stage unrivaled Divine Master against a true Immortal Saint could only be easily crushed.

The difference in divine power alone was too great. It was definitely tens or even hundreds of times greater.

But now, the palm that he, Realm Lord Tian Qu, used with all his strength was actually defeated by his opponent?

“This kid’s divine power is… so strong?” Realm Lord Tian Qu was shocked.

He knew very well that the power that Jian Wushuang unleashed in order to defeat his palm was extraordinary.

And that was indeed the case.

Jian Wushuang was now a Junior Great Divine Master. Because of the special constitution created by the perfect chaotic creature, his divine power was far stronger than that of his peers. In addition, the primordial void celestial body had increased his divine power greatly, which made his basic divine power burst forth, he had reached the level of Peak Great Divine Master.

But the secret skill that he used was too powerful.

First was the seven-star secret skill. This secret skill allowed him to advance by a realm. It allowed him to temporarily reach the Advanced Great Divine Master realm from the initial Great Divine Master realm. Naturally, his divine power soared. At that time, he had already surpassed an ordinary Invincible Divine Master.

The punishment Divine Master, who was 30,000 meters tall, also allowed his divine power to soar.

In addition, there was the nine luminaries star armor, which allowed his divine power to explode six times stronger!

Finally, there was the Blood Mountain Sword!

The power of the Blood Mountain Sword was almost comparable to that of a second-grade holy treasure, and it could increase the power of Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship by ten times!

All of these added together, even if his power was not as strong as the Immortal Saint’s, the gap was very small.

Just now, Realm Lord Tian Qu had casually struck with his palm, but Jian Wushuang had used the ultimate skill he had created. Moreover, his Blood Mountain Sword was extremely sharp. When the sword light came into contact with the giant palm, it was normal for the giant palm to be defeated.

Under such circumstances, it would be strange if Jian Wushuang could not withstand a blow from Realm Lord Tian Qu.

“It seems that I have underestimated you. No wonder Hong ‘er died in your hands even though she had taken out her life-saving talisman.” Realm Lord Tian Qu stared at Jian Wushuang with a cold gaze.

“Thank you for your praise. Although I am only a Divine Master, it will not be easy for you to kill me, Realm Lord Tian Qu.” Jian Wushuang sneered.

“Is that so?” Realm Master Tian Qu’s voice sank, and his surging divine power and the power of the destruction rules surged again.
