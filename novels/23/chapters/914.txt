“He’s dead. I killed him.”

These simple words sounded cold, but turned the Drill Ground on instantly.

“He’s the guy who killed Xia Mang’s brother?”

“Yes, yes, I remember. More than 200 years ago, Xia Yan fought with a Divine Realm expert in Cercis Island. The Divine Realm expert defeated him with only three sword strikes. Xia Yan died afterwards. It is said that he was killed by the Divine Realm expert when he went for revenge. The Divine Realm expert is called Jian Wushuang.”

“Jian Wushuang?”

“It’s him. That’s him!”

“No wonder Xia Mang went to him directly. He’s Jian Wushuang, who killed Xia Yan more than 200 years ago.”

Numerous exclamations filled The Drill Ground one after another.

Everyone gawked at Jian Wushuang in astonishment.

At the time when second master of Xia Clan died, the entire Xia Clan was enraged, raising chaos in the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land. During those years, Xia Clan kept looking for the Divine Realm expert but couldn’t find him.

Who knew the Divine Realm expert had not only made a breakthrough to Eternal Realm, but also came to the Selection Ceremony.

So aboveboard?

Didn’t he worry about being killed by the Xia Clan?

“It was you.” Xia Mang’s expression turned cold. Without any effort to cover, his intension to kill was obvious. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“What of it?” Jian Wushuang said, glancing at Xia Mang.

“Good. I like your arrogance,” Xia Mang sneered, “don’t worry, it’s Selection Ceremony with Emperor Leng present. Our Xia Clan won’t kill you here. But once the Selection Ceremony ends, you must die!”

“No one can save you, no matter it’s Alchemy Master who recommended you this time, or your Senior Brother Master Blood Saber.”

“You have no say about whether they can save me, or whether I will die,” Jian Wushuang answered coldly.

“When I say you must die, you will.” Xia Mang said. It seemed like he announced Jian Wushuang’s fate.

“Do I? I will wait.” Jian Wushuang showed no change in his facial expression. It seemed he cared little about what Xia Mang said at all.

People around the Drill Ground heard their confronting conversations. Some of them became secretly expectant.

In the Void in front of the Drill Ground, a giant stand floated with some console tables on it. Many stalwart people with strong auras sat in front of the tables. There were dozens of them.

They were either the masters of some big Clans and Powers, or the solitary experts with formidable prowess.

Jian Wushuang’s Senior Brother, Xue Lingtian, Alchemy Master was there too.

Those experts saw clearly what occured down there.

“Haha, it’s quite confronting. But it makes sense. It’s Xia Mang’s biological brother that Jian Wushuang killed.”

“I quite admire this little guy. He knows that the Xia Clan hunts him by any means. Without hiding away, instead, he comes to this Selection Ceremony aboveboard. Does he believe his Senior Brother or Alchemy Master can save him?”

“Although Alchemy Master is very powerful, as far as I know, he has nothing to do with Jian Wushuang. He won’t risk his relationship with the Xia Clan just for Jian Wushuang. As regards Master Blood Saber… He is one of the 18 Masters of the Void Temple, which should not be underestimated. But the dispute between Jian Wushuang and the Xia Clan has nothing to do with the Void Temple. It’s impossible for the Void Temple to step in. Master Blood Saber alone is still not enough when pitted against the Xia Clan.”

The experts in front of the console tables chatted freely. They hid nothing while talking. Everything they said was heard by people from the Xia Clan and Master Blood Saber.

Two Dao Master experts of the Xia Clan sat in front of the central tables.

Among them was Elder He. Jian Wushuang met him in Cercis Island. The other one had messy black hair and dark skin, making him look like a wild man. The Great Elder of the Xia Clan, Xia Yu.

Hearing the conversations among the experts, Xia Yu snorted, “a junior with no respect. He who killed our Xia Clan people must die!”

Hearing that, Xue Lingtian, sitting right in front of Xia Yu, looked over and said slowly, “Are you honestly this angry, Elder Xia Yu?”

“Master Blood Saber, Jian Wushuang killed the second master of our Xia Clan. We didn’t destroy the Ancient Sect he belongs to. That’s respecting you. Don’t being unappreciated,” Xia Yu snorted.

“What can you do if I am unappreciated? Do you even desire to kill me?” Xue Lingtian sneered, “Xia Yu, I am not looking down upon you. I am sitting before you and I won’t fight back. If you dare, just go ahead.”

Xue Lingtian sipped the wine glass before him.

Hearing this, Xia Yu furrowed his brow.

To kill Xue Lingtian?

He dared not.

Not only won’t he, even the Master of the Xia Clan, or the Ancestor behind the Xia Clan wouldn’t dare kill Xue Lingtian so openly.

After all, no power in the entire Eternal World sustained the anger of the Void Temple.

“Hmm, I don’t dare kill you, but I do dare kill Jian Wushuang. I don’t believe there is anyone who can save him today,” Xia Yu snorted.

“Let’s wait and see,” Xue Lingtian said, not wishing to talk too much with Xia Yu.

“Blood Saber, it seems that your junior brother has gotten into much trouble today.” Beside Master Blood Saber, there was an elder with white hair. The elder watched everything with a smile, making others feel warm.

Same as Xue Lingtian, the white-haired elder was also one of the 18 Masters of the Void Temple.

“Just little trouble,” Xue Lingtian smiled.

There was an emaciated elder with young face and white hair sitting in front of the another table. A green-haired maid sat beside him.

They were the Lord of Cercis Island and his daughter, Lin Wan.

“Dad, Jian Wushuang provoked Xia Yan because of me. If the Xia Clan wish to kill him, you need to help him,” Lin Wan said, her voice breaking.

“The Xia Clan is the No.1 overlord clan in the Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land. I cannot become their enemies.” Lord of Cercis Island said, shaking his head.

“Dad…” Lin Wan said in a worried tone.

“Ok, ok. Don’t fret. We can just sit and watch. It’s not as simple as you imagine.” Lord of Cercis Island said and impatiently waved his hand.

Lin Wan couldn’t say more.

Right then, with a group of attendants surrounding her, a beautifully harsh figure walked slowly from the distant palace.

Everyone in the Drill Ground couldn’t help stopping what they did and stare at the harsh figure.
