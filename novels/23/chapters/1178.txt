Chapter 1179: One Thousand and Five Hundred Years!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Time passed slowly…

But in the twinkling of an eye, Jian Wushuang had studied in the secret chamber for 1,500 years.

The white-robed middle-aged man transformed by his another Original Body had also traveled in the outside world alone for 1,500 years.

Coupled with the days he had stayed on Star Island, it was a total of 1,800 years.

It was no big deal for experts in the Green Fire World, but it was quite a long time for Jian Wushuang.

It was the longest secluded cultivation that he had experienced since he was born.

His another Original Body finally returned to Star Island.

At the top of a lofty pavilion, Jian Wushuang’s two Original Bodies stood shoulder to shoulder.

“After 1,500 years of meditation and experience on swordsmanships, my two Original Bodies have made great progress in swordsmanships. But a period of time is needed to digest what they have learned.”?Jian Wushuang smiled and immediately integrated his two Original Bodies into one.

He sat cross-legged and closed his eyes just at the top of the pavilion—an extremely conspicuous place.

He wore a deep smile on the corners of his mouth. It looked unusually fascinating.

“Look, isn’t that Blood Mountain?”

“It’s him! What is he doing there?”

“It seems that he is cultivating.”

“Have you noticed the smile on his face? Why did it make me feel so weird?”

Warriors who passed by the pavilion saw Jian Wushuang, but they did not disturb him.

All of them could tell that Jian Wushuang was in an amazing state.

Somewhere on Star Island, Lord Spirit Sound and a skinny elder sat face to face. The latter was transformed by Gu King.

Gu King came out of Jian Wushuang’s body after Jian Wushuang set foot on Star Island and did not go into his Ancient God Body during this period.

At this moment, their eyes penetrated buildings and clearly saw where Jian Wushuang was at.

“That boy is undergoing metamorphosis?” Gu King’s pupils shrank.

“Yes, it’s the metamorphosis on swordsmanships or mental attitude. It seems that he has benefited immensely from years of secluded cultivation.” Lord Spirit Sound said.

“In this way, he will surely try to go through the ultimate test again after he finishes with his metamorphosis. And this time, the odds that he will succeed should be high. Spirit Sound, I should congratulate you in advance. Finally, there is someone who can pass the ultimate test after you have waited for so many years.” Gu King looked at Lord Spirit Sound.

“I have stayed on this island for so many years and I’m tired of living here anymore. If Jian Wushuang really can pass the ultimate test and control the Stellar Fog Sea, then I will be free.” Lord Spirit Sound smiled. Apparently, she hoped that Jian Wushuang could pass the ultimate test.

“He won’t let you down.” Gu King replied smilingly.

He had been with Jian Wushuang for so long and had a good understanding of him. He knew how great his potential was.

Jian Wushuang alone sat at the top of the pavilion for half a month.

Half a month later, he opened his eyes and stood up.

“My two Original Bodies has cultivated for 1,500 years and my swordsmanships have been greatly improved. Even if I continue to do secluded cultivation, the effect may not be so dramatic. That’s not necessary.”

“I can try the ultimate test of Star Island!”

He immediately went toward the black tower.

Again, the news that he prepared to pass through the ultimate test spread throughout Star Island by Lord Spirit Sound.

Everyone on Star Island was extremely excited.

They had witnessed Jian Wushuang’s horrible progress 1,500 years ago, and now, they believed he must have achieved greater progress.

In the black tower.

In the vast dark Void, a burly man carried a Giant Axe on his back stood in front of Jian Wushuang.

“You are here again?” The burly man glanced at Jian Wushuang.

“I was defeated by you the first two times, but this time, I will defeat you!” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

“Oh? You are quite confident.”

The burly man had a deadpan expression on his face. Although he was a Puppet Fighter, he had intelligence. He could tell that there was a great difference between the Jian Wushuang in front of him now and the one 1,500 years ago.

“Let’s start!”

The burly man acted without talking any nonsense. He moved as soon as the Giant Axe appeared in his hands.

Boom!

The dark Void at his foot cracked instantly. Like a shell, he immediately appeared before Jian Wushuang.

Swish!

Carrying an immense amount of power, a towering and eye-catching Axe Shadow flew outward.

Apart from its fast speed, its power was also sufficient to make ordinary Universe Masters tremble.

“In the previous two battles, I suffered losses due to power, but this time…” Sharp light surged in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. The moment he saw the burly man hacking the Giant Axe toward him, he held the Blood Mountain Sword tightly and surges of power swarmed into the sword.

Hum~~~ The Blood Mountain Sword quivered and suddenly chopped outward.

“Heaven’s Bane!”

Jian Wushuang let out a roar.

It was the Heaven’s Bane.

After 1,500 years of study and improvement, it was no longer the previous weak sword movement.

A sword light dashed out.

Although this sword movement was powerful previously, it failed to gather all the power in one place and release all the power in an instant.

Now, however, although it did not appear to be so powerful, in fact, it gathered an immense amount of power in one place and could destroy everything.

Boom!

A loud bang was heard. Jian Wushuang stopped and the Giant Axe of that burly man moved backwards due to the impact.

Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently and his longsword left his hand at a top speed.

A cold sword light swayed the moment it escaped from his hand and influenced the surrounding spacetime. It came in front of the burly man in a split second.

The burly man waved his big hand and shattered it easily.

Bright Moon!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes looked as sharp as a blade. He shook his wrist and hacked out the Blood Mountain Sword. A huge bright moon emerged before the burly man.

The burly man took a step forward and struck out the axe held by his two hands.

The moment the Giant Axe smashed the bright moon, the Bright Moon fell apart and formed numerous sword lights shooting toward the burly man.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword turned into a giant black dragon.
