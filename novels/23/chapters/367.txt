“I landed a direct hit, but it only barely broke his skin. How can his body be so strong?”?Jiu Xiu looked at Jian Wushuang in surprise. Even he had never heard of such a strong body.

Jian Wushuang, however, just looked solemn.

“His perception of the Origin and comprehension of Sword Principle are far above mine, and the Sword Skill he wields is monstrous. Yet, his basic strength is very common, only at the level of ordinary Saint Realm warriors.”

They had only just started fighting, but Jian Wushuang already had some understanding towards Jiu Xiu’s strength.

“If we compare skill, I am not his opponent, so I’ll have to rely on absolute strength to crush him.”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes were flashing.

“Asura Secret Skill, Bridge of Helplessness!”

There was a loud rumble, then a turbulent Blood River appeared. On the edge of the Blood River, a long blood bridge extended to the end of the Blood River. While standing above the blood river, Jian Wushuang began to move forward, step by step, with his aura growing, just like an Asura.

The Triple-kill Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand also radiated a monstrous rage before slashing out a moment later.

The two Sword Essence phantoms behind him also attacked with their longswords.

There was no sound!

It was not even visible to the naked eye.

But this seemingly invisible strike made Jiu Xiu’s pupils suddenly shrink.

“This is... the Heart-killing Sword Technique?”

Jiu Xiu was not unfamiliar with Sword Ancestor’s strongest sword skill. At this moment, what Jian Wushuang displayed was obviously just the First Move of the Heart-killing Sword Technique, Traceless.

No shadow, no trace!

Under the full force of Jian Wushuang’s Bridge of Helplessness, the power of this blow was even more earth-shattering.

Even Jiu Xiu didn’t dare to be careless at this moment, so he immediately used his sword to defend.

BANG!

A violent roar resounded. Two terrifying powers collided explosively. The constant sword light that was being released seemed like it could easily cut anything in half.

“It’s amazing, you can even use the Sword Ancestor’s famous sword skill!” Jiu Xiu was staring at Jian Wushuang with sparkling eyes.

“Is it?”

However, at this moment, Jian Wushuang suddenly smiled coldly. Then, a bright light appeared between his eyebrows. The area between his eyebrows seemed to be split, and a Sword Essence, which gave even the spectators an eerie feeling, violently rushed forward like a thunderclap.

The appearance of this sword shadow was so sudden that even Jiu Xiu was not able to react immediately.

“Mind’s Eye Sword Technique!”

Jiu Xiu recognized Jian Wushuang’s sword skill, but he was only barely able to move his body aside at the last moment. The incomparably fast Sword Essence directly struck his shoulder, leaving behind a gaping hole.

Jiu Siu’s figure was also violently forced backwards by this Sword Essence in a completely ungraceful manner.

However, once he regained his balance, the countless experts in the area were shocked by what they saw.

They were surprised because there was a gaping hole, the size of a bowl, in Jiu Xiu’s shoulder. This would not be a minor wound for anyone, and there should have been a lot of blood flowing from the wound. Yet, at this moment, they did not see any blood gushing from Jiu Xiu’s shoulder.

What they saw was dark molten iron moving slowly inside the hole.

“That is…”

The countless experts in the area were stunned.

He was clearly injured, but there was no blood. Instead, there was a lot of molten iron?

“Is he human?”

After seeing this, Jian Wushuang’s pupils also shrank as he mumbled, “Puppet Fighter?”

There was no blood, no flesh, and no organs. The Jiu Xiu in front of them was not a human at all!

He was a Puppet Fighter!

“If I didn’t guess incorrectly, you’re from that place?”?Staring at this Jiu Xiu in front of him, Jian Wushang said in a low and heavy voice, “The Divine Land!”

“The Divine Land?”

As for the experts who were watching, as well as the young warriors who came to participate in the selection, all of them looked puzzled.

They had never heard of this Divine Land.

Only some of the old monsters present, as well as those who held high positions, such as the Sect Master of the Alchemy School, immediately became serious when they heard him mention “The Divine Land.”

“The Divine Land. The legendary continent at the center of this world and a haven for experts.” Wang Yan murmured.

As the Sect Master of the Alchemy School, Wang Yan knew about the existence of the Divine Land.

He knew that this world he was in was huge, but 99 % of it was covered by vast seas.

Spread throughout the vast seas, there were pieces of land, of which the Nanyang Continent was only a very common piece.

In addition to the Nanyang Continent, there were many similar lands in this world that were also filled with warriors. Naturally, there was no lack of experts. However, the real core of the world was the Divine Land!

It was said that the vast territory of the Divine Land was far superior to the Nanyang Continent. Owing to its core location in the world, the Spiritual Energy there was purer and more abundant than in other places. Therefore, cultivating in the Divine Land better than anywhere else.

Therefore, the number of the experts in the Divine Land was something that the Nanyang Continent could not compete with.

Using a metaphor, the Nanyang Continent was like an ordinary stream, while the Divine Land was a vast sea. There was no comparison.

Many old monsters on the Nanyang Continent, whose strength had reached the Pinnacle of the Saint Realm and had become peak experts on the Nanyang Continent, would go to the vast Divine Land once they felt there was nothing left for them to pursue on the Nanyang Continent.

In the history of the Alchemy School, there had been several peak experts who had gone to the Divine Land.

As for Jian Wushuang, after his strength reached a certain level and he developed a deeper understanding of the Ancestor’s Land, he realized that the Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline was so marvelous that a small place like the Nanyang Continent could not contain it. Hence, Jian Wushang had suspected that there was a vast world beyond the Nanyang Continent.

As for his actual knowledge on the existence of the Divine Land, he read about it in the letter his father left him.

The letter mentioned that his father had left the Nanyang Continent and gone to the Divine Land.

The Divine Land was a place where experts gathered.

At its peak, the Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline was one of the overlords on the Divine Land. The force that had destroyed the Divine Land had also been located on the Divine Land.

As for the Jiu Xiu in front of him, no matter if it was perception of the Origin, the Sword Skills he displayed, or the technique he had used to take away Jian Nantian’s Sword Soul, all of them were beyond the scope of the Nanyang Continent. Therefore, Jian Wushuang was certain he came from the Divine Land.

And it is very likely that he came from the force that had destroyed the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor.

As for Holy Emperor Palace, it was only a chess piece used to prevent the growth of the Sword Ancestor’s Bloodline.

Hearing what Jian Wushuang said, Jiu Xiu gave him a noncommittal smile. Obviously it meant he tacitly approved.

He really came from the Divine Land.
