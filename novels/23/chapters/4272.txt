4273 One Versus Four!

The Dark Demon Descendant’s expression changed slightly when he saw this menacing sword.

He had not expected that he would be the first target of Jian Wushuang.

Whoosh!

Without waiting for the Dark Demon Descendant to react, Jian Wushuang’s speed was extremely fast and the sharp sword light directly slashed down, splitting the Dark Demon Descendant into two!

!!

However, the strange thing was that before Jian Wushuang’s sword essence could burst out and mince the Dark Demon Descendant’s divine body, his body automatically disintegrated and turned into a pool of blood.

In the next moment, the pool of blood retreated, and the Dark Demon Descendant’s body reappeared.

“Blood Sword, you deserve to die.” The Dark Demon Descendant’s face turned gloomy. He grabbed with his right hand, and a blood-red spear condensed in his hand.

At the same time, a hint of shock and anger flashed through his heart.

If it were not for the fact that the Dark Demon clan was nurtured by the blood river and could disperse into blood water at any time, Jian Wushuang’s sword attack would have really made him fail.

However, although Jian Wushuang’s stroke did not kill him, he had to pay a heavy price for using the blood river secret skill.

At this time, the Golden Crow Prince and the others had arrived again!

The Golden Crow Imperial Prince’s body was burning with flames, and the Golden Crow mark on his forehead became more and more demonic. He held two tridents in his hands, and like a god of war from the ancient heavenly court, he stepped forward and slashed!

“Blood Sword, give up your futile struggle. It’s your honor to die under my halberd.” The Golden Crow Prince said coldly.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed. First, he slashed three times to force the Dark Demon Descendants away. Then, he suddenly turned around and looked at the shocking attack that was coming at him. He sneered and said, “It’s your honor to die under my sword.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Jian Wushuang pointed his Wuqi Divine Sword at Emperor Jin Wu. He did not retreat but instead, he attacked him!

“You’re so stubborn.”

A cold look flashed across the Golden Crow Prince’s face. The Golden divine fire on his two tridents became more and more fierce.

The Golden Crow godly fire was one of the top three godly fires in the universe. It was so powerful that it could melt the sky.

“Incinerate the heavens!”

“Fire Dragon!” The Golden Crow Imperial Prince said. In an instant, his two tridents turned into a Fire Dragon! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Split open the sky!”

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and his divine power burst out. He instantly activated the sky-opening sword and slashed down at Emperor Jin Wu’s head!

Boom!

As the two of them clashed, countless Golden Crow divine flames exploded and landed in the void, burning him.

“Eh? You’re actually able to force me back?”

The Golden Crow Prince’s eyes flickered and he took half a step back. He looked down at his numb palm and praised, “Blood Sword, with this one strike, you will have a place in the eight cities. Unfortunately, you should never have thought of taking the investiture of the gods for yourself.”

Although he was complimenting, the killing intent between his brows was getting colder!

This kid must die today!

Otherwise, if he were to let this brat escape, it would be difficult to kill him in the future.

Jian Wushuang did not have time to reply. Instead, he turned his eyes and looked coldly at Moonslayer.

The Moonslayer held the demon sword’s hilt diagonally and moved as fast as a phantom. With one step, a second Moonslayer suddenly appeared in the void not far in front of him.

Then, a third, a fourth, a fifth…

This was the afterimage that was created by Moonslayer’s speed!

It was only when Moonslayer appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and slashed at him with the demonic blade that the first afterimage of Moonslayer disappeared.

“What a fast speed!”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes. This person’s speed was much faster than Heavenly Snake Playboy’s!

Huala!

When Moonslayer slashed down, Jian Wushuang was about to raise his sword to block it. However, he saw that Moonslayer’s right hand turned over and instantly changed from a slash to a diagonal slash. The demonic blade directly cut through Jian Wushuang’s body!

Buzzzzzz!

Immediately, a deep cut appeared on Jian Wushuang’s divine body.

Jian Wushuang lowered his head and looked at the knife marks on his divine body. Countless divine power spread out and his divine body recovered instantly. His face was filled with surging battle intent.

Although Moonslayer had not said anything from the beginning to the end, in terms of strength, he was probably no weaker than the Golden Crow Emperor. Moreover, this person’s understanding of saber Dao had also reached the fourth origin of cosmic saber Dao.

“As expected, those who have reached the invincible Ruler realm are not simple characters.”

Jian Wushuang muttered to himself. The fighting intent in his eyes suddenly increased by three inches and he shouted in a low voice, “Again!”

In an instant, Jian Wushuang performed Gale sword principle and charged at Moonslayer!

In terms of speed, Jian Wushuang was no match for him even with the help of the sword principle of Gale. However, he had other means!

“Dragon-destroying secret skill, divine power ignition!”

Boom!

The vast divine power that had calmed down in Jian Wushuang’s body started to burn madly again.

Under the burning of divine power, his strength instantly increased!

“Blood Sword, you’ve made me excited.” Moonslayer’s calm expression changed. He laughed and slashed at Jian Wushuang with his saber!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two of them were extremely fast, and they exchanged hundreds of moves in the void in an instant. The Wuqi Divine Sword and the Demon Blade in Moonslayer’s hand kept clashing. Every time they collided, a series of sparks would be created, and a shocking explosion would be heard!

Their understanding of sword principle and blade principle were on the same level, but Jian Wushuang’s use of universe law and the total amount of divine power was much stronger than that of killer!

...

Soon, the Moonslayer was at a disadvantage.

When the Golden Crow Prince, Rabbit Buddha, and the others saw this scene, their faces turned grave.

“Golden Crow, Rabbit Buddha,” the Dark Demon Descendant said indifferently, “this Blood Sword’s comprehension of the sword doctrine has already reached the realm of great success. If you continue to hold back and allow him to continue fighting, I dare say that we will be defeated one by one!”

Hearing this, Golden Crow Emperor and Rabbit Buddha both frowned. However, they knew that the Dark Demon Descendant was telling the truth. The most important thing now was to get The Investiture of the Gods. There was no need to fight with Jian Wushuang.

“Let’s work together to kill this person first to prevent any accidents.” Emperor Jin Wu’s words were equivalent to a hammer announcing Jian Wushuang’s death sentence.

“Innate divine ability, Golden Crow devours the sun!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the illusionary image of a huge Golden Crow appeared behind him!

The Golden Crow was thousands of feet tall and was bathed in the sun. Its wings were made of fire and it let out a clear cry that shook the world!

Seeing this, the Dark Demon Descendant also said, “Innate divine ability, abyssal Blood River!”

Hualala!

A huge Blood River appeared around the Dark Demon Descendant. This Blood River seemed to be real as it kept flowing and gave off a loud rumbling sound.

...

“The Buddha is merciful.”

The Rabbit Buddha put its palms together and spoke word by word.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Heaven and earth began to shake, and countless clouds were torn apart. First, an inch of golden light shot out through the dark clouds.

Then, more and more golden lights appeared!

In the next moment, the entire sky was filled with multicolored light as countless rays of buddhist light shone on the earth!

A giant Golden Buddha appeared and sat in the void.
