Chapter 153: The Selection Battle Begins

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

When the sword essences were combined, his fighting strength greatly improved.

With the Fiery Wind Sword Essence, formed via the combination of Gale and Raging Fire, Jian Wushuang’s fighting strength had improved immensely.

The increase in strength would be even greater if he could combine three sword essences.

As a conservative estimate, once Jian Wushuang combined three sword essences, his overall strength could be increased by at least three times!

However, it’s pity, during the two years of meditation in the Sword Tomb, even though his comprehension of those four sword essences was at a high level, he was unable to combine three sword essences... Neither Sword Essences of Earth nor Waterdrop were combined with Fiery Wind Sword Essence successfully.

Successfully combining them depended on more than just comprehension. What he needed was a moment of insight.

If he was lucky, he could combine three sword essences in the next instant.

“However, even without combining three sword essences, I have absolute confidence I could defeat Baili Chen now. My strength has improved a lot compared to one month ago,” Jian Wushuang muttered confidently.

He was different from other warriors; what he practiced was Inverse Cultivation.

Other warriors could only gain limited improvements within one month, while he could greatly improve.

After all, his current cultivation was only in the Profound Gold Core Realm, while Baili Chen and the other top experts were all at the Peak of the Gold Core Realm.

Just looking at his cultivation level, there was plenty of room for improvement.

“The?one-month?deadline is near, which means the selection battle is about to start.”?Jian Wushuang thought. His hands were clenched tightly, and a light shined in his eyes.

Ten Griffins had long been prepared outside of the Dragon Palace.

Jian Wushuang, Yang Zaixuan, and Su Rou walked side by side,?towards Baili Chen.

Baili Chen randomly picked a Griffin and sat down, looking over at them as he said, “You three finally arrived. We were all waiting for you.”

“Why is it just you guys here, where are Palace Master White and the others?” Jian Wushuang said questioningly.

“They have already gone to the selection battlefield. They don’t have time to deal with us,” Baili Chen said jokingly. “Alright, pick a Griffin and let’s go. Not sure why,?but the selection battlefield this time is, unexpectedly, one hundred miles away from the imperial palace.”

“Outside the imperial palace?” Jian Wushuang grew suspicious.

Soon after, the ten Gold Core Realm experts, who were attending the battle on behalf of Dragon Palace, left on the Griffins.

...

A hundred miles away from the imperial palace, was a huge blank field.

At this moment, that blank field was already very crowded and busy.

Through the internal selection battle in Tianzong Dynasty, the strongest fifteen geniuses would be picked to attend the Easternmost Hunt. The selection battle was held every decade. Needless to say, everyone took this quite seriously.

An innumerable amount of warriors was gathered in the field. Although it was not yet noon, the number must have reached over 100,000!

With more than 100,000 people gathered in a blank field, what would it look like?

They looked like a swarm of wasps.

Fortunately, Tianzong Dynasty had a Royal Guard. With the Royal Guard in place, the battlefield was kept in good order.

After all, every sergeant was at the Exceptional Gold Core Realm. The Royal Guard had an incredible battle strength. And, the sergeants worked well together, so nobody could cause trouble in front of them. If someone tried, it would only take a few sergeants to suppress them.

The crowd included a large number of experts with tyrannical auras, most of which were much stronger than the Exceptional Gold Core Realm.

They were experts from the Earthly Dragon List!

Normally they would rarely appear, but during this event, experts from the Earthly Dragon List could be seen everywhere. At a glance, it was easy to spot more than fifty experts from the Earthly Dragon List.

However, the warriors present were not really excited to see the normal experts of the Earthly Dragon List, they saw too many in this event. what attracted their sight was those top experts.

“That is Ouyang Haotian, right?”

“Yes, it’s him, ranked 3rd on the Earthly Dragon List. The man next to him is his little brother, Ouyang Haoyue.”

“Hum, I heard that he can easily kill the experts in the Yin-Yang Void Realm. He will definitely be one of the strongest who claims one of the fifteen places in this selection battle.”

“Is that Mu Yingying from the Mu clan?”

“She attended as well.”

“She was originally ranked 3rd on the Earthly Dragon List, but is now ranked 4th. Even though she moved back one rank, her strength still should not be underestimated.”

Quite a lot of people were discussing in secret.

“Brother, look at how many people are watching you.” Standing next to his eldest brother, Ouyang Haoyue felt proud.

“Well, ignore them,” Ouyang Haotian said casually, “I am pretty confident that I can get a spot in the selection battle. As for you, I will try my best to get a spot for you too, if there is a chance.”

“Thanks, brother,” Ouyang Haoyue said excitedly. But suddenly, his face turned cold and he said, “brother, I have a request. It’s about Jian Wushuang.”

“Yes, I know,” Ouyang Haotian nodded and said, “Don’t worry, I will handle it for you. Jian Wushuang is not qualified to be my opponent. Forget Jian Wushuang, even Baili Chen will be defeated by me this time!”

“Nowadays, only one person is qualified to be my opponent on the entire Earthly Dragon List.”

“Who?” Ouyang Haoyue could not help but ask.

“Xue Yun,” Ouyang Haotian said, with his eyes suddenly shrank, “he is coming.”

A black shadow swept through the air at an amazing speed. In no time it appeared, hovering over the area. This shadow turned out to be a giant black Condor, carrying a robed figure. It began to float down slowly, finally landing on the platform which was temporarily built in the center of the blank field.

The platform was quiet. Even though there were plenty of Warriors around, nobody dared to step on it. At this moment, the figure suddenly appeared on the platform, overlooking everyone in the field with a wicked look.

In an instant, the entire field was in a tumult.

“He is Xue Yun!”

“Yes, he is Xue Yun!”

“He is the one who is ranking 1st on the Earthly Dragon List, and the well-deserved strongest beneath the Yin-Yang Void Realm!”

“He will definitely acquire one of the fifteen spots without a doubt.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Seeing him, plenty Warriors around were very excited.

Xue Yun could be called a myth, and a legend!

He was a goal that almost all Warriors of Tianzong Dynasty were striving for.

But now, this myth appeared in front of everybody, overlooking the crowd crossly with his wicked and evil eyes, with everybody was in his sight.

Everybody who was in his sight could not help lowering their heads, including the experts of the Earthly Dragon List.

No one dared to look Xue Yun in the eye.

They knew the disparity between their power was quite big!

The disparity was so big that they could not catch up with purely by cultivating.

“Brother, is he Xue Yun?”

There were several figures with Long Swords on their backs in the crowd. They were from Tianyuan Sword Sect. Among them was Jian Meng’er and her Great Master, Shui Hanxin, whom Jian Wushuang had seen befor
