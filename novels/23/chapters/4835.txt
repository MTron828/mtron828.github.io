4837 Another Confrontation

In the depths of the Heavenly Prison, it was extremely dark.

A figure that was bound by Yan power chains was suspended in one of the spaces.

His originally thin Immortal body was now covered in wounds, and divine blood dripped from every wound.

His long hair was also disheveled, covering his face.

The white-robed Yan Immortal, Prince Jiu’s companion, was holding a long whip that emitted a dark luster. Every ten breaths, he would lash out with the whip, cutting off a piece of flesh.

Even an Immortal body that had transcended the shackles of the Great Dao could not resist it.

“Tell me. The reward remains the same, and you can even become a Great Heavenly Official. What reason do you have to reject such a great blessing?” the white-robed Yan Immortal warned as he waved his whip.

Divine blood gushed out continuously, and the tortured figure slowly raised his head. Through the messy hair, a blood-red eye was revealed.

The white-robed Yan Immortal’s heart skipped a beat. After he calmed down, he began to whip even harder.

There was a ripple in the air. Prince Jiu walked out slowly. “You’ll feel better if you tell me.”

“I’m so stupid.” A cold laugh sounded.

“I didn’t keep a single one of the five pills. I gave them away without any thoughts, but now I’ve ended up like this.”

“I’ve given you the best things without holding back, so why are you still treating me like this?”

Wei Liujia bellowed in rage. His pair of cold eyes stared straight at Prince Jiu.

“Impudent!” the white-robed Yan Immortal roared as the whip in his palm lashed toward his face, leaving a long, bloody gash!

The divine blood gushed out, but Wei Liujia did not make a sound. He only stared at him.

Prince Jiu waved his hand to stop him. Just as he was about to speak, the entire Heavenly Prison suddenly trembled. Then, rays of extremely powerful Yan power began to stir restlessly!

“Your Highness, there is a change in the Heavenly Prison!” The white-robed Yan Immortal’s expression changed drastically. As his voice fell, a violent explosion occurred!

The entire space shook, and the invisible barrier seemed to be unable to withstand the pressure and burst.

All kinds of extremely ferocious Yan power filled the space.

As all sorts of unknown and terrifying Yan power filled the space, an ugly Yan Immortal with three heads appeared. It jumped around excitedly, as if it had been trapped for a long time.

Right now, it only wanted to devour all living things in front of it!

It roared excitedly, but the three pairs of eyes could only see a few figures before they exploded.

Prince Jiu did not even spare it a glance. He reached out his hand and crushed its Immortal Source, crushing its Immortal body.

However, this was only the beginning.

In the next moment, an arm that was more than 100 feet wide, like a giant python, suddenly tore the space apart and smashed over with an indescribable force.

Some of the Yan Immortals were slightly slower and were sent flying.

Prince Jiu’s expression turned cold as he started to fight with him on the spot.

The Heavenly Prison was breaking apart. Countless Yan Immortals who had been trapped here for an unknown amount of time were released and began to cause the greatest destruction.

“Damned thing!”

Prince Jiu was furious. A river of blood appeared on his outstretched palm, and he crushed the arm that was more than 30 meters wide.

“All of you, follow me to investigate!” he said, then disappeared with the group of Yan Immortals.

The Heavenly Prison was shaking more and more. Not long after the Prince left, two figures wrapped in black robes appeared quietly.

“Wei Liujia, come with us,” the leading black-robed figure said in a low voice as he extended his hand to destroy the Yan power chains around him.

Wei Liujia, who had almost fainted, raised his head with great difficulty. When he saw the person in front of him clearly, he said in surprise, “Your Excellency!”

“Don’t say anything. Leave this place with us,” Jian Wushuang said in a low voice.

An indescribable emotion welled up in his heart, and Wei Liujia nodded heavily. However, he soon realized that after enduring the punishment, his meridians had long lost all their energy. It was difficult for him to even perform the simplest movements, let alone run.

“My Lord, you should leave. I’m not worth saving,” he said.

Jian Wushuang saw through the reason and immediately released several rays of the Yan power to pull him out of the prison.

It was Jian Wushuang who had caused the chaos in the Heavenly Prison. He and Di Qing had destroyed more than half of the prison and released the Yan Immortals to cause chaos.

The truth was just as he had expected. Prince Jiu had been sent away, and there was no danger.

Looking at Wei Liujia, who was covered in blood, Jian Wushuang sighed softly. This guy had not revealed a single word about him to the Prince at the last moment. His determination was evident. He was worth saving.

However, just as Jian Wushuang was shuttling through the chaotic and broken Heavenly Prison, he suddenly felt a great sense of danger!

The next moment, a great light that seemed to pierce through the chaos and dispel the extreme darkness shot over at an unimaginable speed!

However, at this moment of danger, Wei Liujia, who was behind Jian Wushuang, suddenly stood up without any warning and directly faced the great light.

However, he only managed to block it for a moment before the light went through his body and shot toward Jian Wushuang without losing momentum!

However, the moment Wei Liujia blocked it, Jian Wushuang had a chance.

He turned around instantly and pressed down with his finger. The Extreme Darkness Heavenly Gate, which he had not used for a long time, once again exploded with a huge amount of potential energy.

The two collided, and the shock wave instantly cleared all chaos.

Jian Wushuang used the Extreme Darkness Heavenly Gate to neutralize the light. He did not stop and pulled back Wei Liujia’s broken Immortal body.

Soon after, Prince Jiu’s figure appeared. His pair of heroic eyes shot out a brilliant light as he stared straight at Jian Wushuang.

He had a feeling that this middle-aged man with an unkempt beard had a familiar aura.

Jian Wushuang did not intend to get into a conflict with Prince Jiu. Therefore, he tried to escape after holding Wei Liujia.

However, the tens of Yan Immortals that appeared blocked their way.

Di Qing frowned. He waved his palm, and an indescribable force smashed the two Yan Immortals in front of him into meat patties.

“Let’s go!” he said in a deep voice. Taking advantage of the gap, he reached out and directly killed two more.

In Di Qing’s hands, the Yan Immortals could not even resist, and six of them were killed in an instant!

Jian Wushuang nodded. Without any hesitation, he carried Wei Liujia and took the lead.

On the other hand, Prince Jiu, who was hovering in the void, was completely shocked by the scene just now. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

To be able to kill Yan Immortal with a wave of his hand, what kind of strength did he have to be able to do it so easily?

Could this guy be a Grand Yan Immortal?

A ghastly chill gushed from the bottom of Prince Jiu’s heart. At the same time, his eyes revealed a hint of ruthlessness.

“Even if you’re a Grand Yan Immortal, don’t even think about running amuck in my Great Mi Heaven!”

When the entire Heavenly Prison was destroyed, Prince Jiu was still standing in the distance. He flipped his palm and a palm-sized white jade item appeared.
