Chapter 2090 Defeat!

“He’s… so strong?” Ba Su was astonished.

He received a bit of information regarding Jian Wushuang’s background via the Archelon Palace. He knew Jian Wushuang had Second Stage Great Emperor-level fighting powers.

But according to them, Jian Wushuang was not the strongest amongst Second Stage Great Emperors – a tad away from being a pinnacle Emperor.

Whereas, on the other hand, Ba Su was a Pinnacle Second Stage Great Emperor, one of the best around. He should have defeated Jian Wushuang easily.

But… the power Jian Wushuang had demonstrated.

“Perfection, this is definitely the Second Stage’s limit! Almost hitting Third Stage!”

“This fighting power, it’s more powerful than mine!” Ba Su clenched his fists.

Hong!

A loud roar could be heard. Ba Su turned around to see where it came from.

Jian Wushuang had already made it through that Divine Power storm, and was now in front of him.

“Ba Su, that move should have been everything you’ve got right?” Jian Wushuang chuckled. “Now that you’ve used your final skill, it’s my turn to return the favour.”

As he spoke, a billowing Divine Power was emerging from Jian Wushuang.

At the same time, a boundless Timespace Power was spreading.

Jian Wushuang stared into the Void where Ba Su was. “This move was the previous Ancient God Emperor’s favourite, recognised as the strongest move within my clan. I wonder how well it works.”

WIth a tinge of excitement, Jian Wushuang made his move.

“The ancient skill, Moon Picking Skill!”

Wong~~

Time and space shook. The billowing Timespace Power covered the Void where Ba Su was, locking the entire area up.

Hualala~~

Like Jian Wushuang had demonstrated, the first thing Ba Su faced was the immediate pressure from the surrounding Timespace. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

This, was much stronger than what Jian Wushuang had demonstrated previously.

Even a pinnacle Second Stage Great Emperor like Ba Su, under this immense pressure from the surrounding Spacetime, could not help but face unprecedented pressure on his body.

He felt as if he did not belong to this Timespace.

This was a first for Ba Su.

“What move was that?” Ba Su was secretly shocked.

He did not feel like he belonged to that Timespace.

And this was just the beginning.

As Ba Su was completely pinned down by the surrounding Timespace, a palm formed completely from Divine Power appeared out of thin air.

The palm did not feel destructive or threatening – if felt familiar and warm instead.

Like a mother’s hands.

That hand gently touched the Void and slowly made its way towards Hafeez.

This ‘pluck’, would be like plucking lilies from the pond – gentle, docile.

Imagine making great pains to let the flower bloom. This palm was about to reap its gains, finally.

It looked so natural, so relaxed. This scene was unbelievable to almost all experts and Ba Su himself in the field.

Ba Su struggled even harder, attempting to escape before the palm ‘plucked’ him.

But no matter how desperately he struggled, he could not escape.

He could only watch the palm cover him.

Wong Wong Wong~~

A faint sound was ringing across the Void before it went silent again.

The palm had vanished, the Void was now unchained and back to normal. Ba Su remained standing in the middle of the Void.

What was different this time? Ba Su now looked pale, the corner of his lip still oozing blood, his inner strength much weaker than it had been before he left. He took much damage from the ‘pluck’.

Everyone watched in astonishment.

Even Jian Wushuang himself was pretty shocked.

Going against the pinnacle Second Stage Great Emperor Ba Su, Jian Wushuang still managed to hold the upper ground against him, but he thought it would be hard to hurt him.

According to his own estimations, unless he used his trump card, it would be hard to hurt Ba Su at all.

But in the end…

“Moon Picking Skill, indeed Ancient God Emperor’s proudest move!” Jian Wushuang praised.

This skill alone was enough to seriously injure Ba Su.

Most importantly, this complete secret skill was only just imparted to Jian Wushuang, so he could only utilise three-tenths of the skill at this time.

Only thirty percent, but already so powerful.

“With my capabilities now, with the Moon Picking Skill, I can resist a full blow from a Third Stage Great Emperor with this alone. Once I fully master it, even the Third Stage Great Emperors won’t dare to underestimate me!”

“Most importantly, this skill is so profound, it’s impossible to block it.” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists.

On the battlefield, Jian Wushuang stood in front of Ba Su once again, staring cheekily.

“Another round, Mister Ba Su?”

Ba Su looked horrendous.

As much as he refused to believe it, he had already lost.

Lost pathetically.

Face-to-face, Jian Wushuang’s six Hong Jun Golden Swords and close combat abilities were enough to completely suppress him.

And with that final move, Jian Wushuang decimated him.

Unless he did not value his life that much, it would be have been impossible to defeat Jian Wushuang.

That would not happen.

Even if he went all out, there was no guarantee Jian Wushuang had no more tricks up his sleeve.

“I’ve lost this round. From today onwards, you are the strongest amongst the Special Tribes,” Ba Su’s voice trembled as he spoke.

Jian Wushuang gave a satisfied smile.

The countless experts around were all still in shock.

Before the battle, although they were all excited, most of them did not think Jian Wushuang would win.

After all, Ba Su’s reputation of being the best had lasted for decades. He was recognised by all as undefeatable, a near legend.

It was too difficult to defeat him.

But now, the new Ancient God Emperor, had defeated him?
