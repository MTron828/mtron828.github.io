Chapter 2126 Desperate Measures

“Kill, kill them all!” East Royal Emperor eyes were bloodshot as he fought a great emperor from Acheron Palace with a war spirit.“Since all of you dare to come to Heaven Repairing Palace, you should be prepared to die!” The Abysmal Saint Master screamed. He turned into a dark beast and fully displayed his stage two great emperor fighting power. He managed to suppress two great emperors from Acheron Palace.

Underworld God killed most of the emperor gods and began focusing on his attacks on a great emperor from Acheron Palace. The great emperor retreated as the Underworld God used his stage two great emperor fighting power.

Emperor God Tian Ling continued to chase the great emperor which he had wounded as he got closer to killing him.

The last great emperor was in the worst state as he was being attacked by four war spirits.

As for Demon King Chen Yu, he was occupied by Jian Wushuang and had no chance to help his other teammates.

“Damn all of you brats!!”

Demon King Chen Yu’s eyes were bloodshot as a terrifying killing intent radiated from him. He was burning with rage as the eight divine weapons swung around crazily in an attempt to kill Jian Wushuang. However, his efforts were in vain as he could not even harm Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang could stop all his attacks using Mixed Elements Spirit from the Sword Principle Xuan Luo alone.

Even though he was passive and felt sullen, he did not mind at all.

As for the current situation, the Sanctuary Alliance had an advantage.

“Lord Demon King, I cannot hold on much longer!”

“Lord Demon King, let’s retreat!”

“Lord Demon King…”

Many urgent calls came from all around the battlefield as the great emperors from Acheron Palace could not hold their ground much longer.

It was natural given the large gap in their power levels.

Even though each great emperor had the ability to survive the most dire situations, that was only applicable if they were running away.

Now, they were obviously at a disadvantage. If they did not run, they were simply awaiting their death.

“Bastard!”

Hearing the surrounding voices, Demon King Chen Yu was angered even more. “Acheron Palace had already failed many times. I have lost face in front of Kaiser Blood and Lord Fen. This time, Acheron Palace has already sent almost every expert it had. I even came down personally to take charge. If we were to fail again… My dignity and that of the Acheron would cease to exist and we would become a joke in the eyes of Holocaust Sect!!”

“This time, we cannot fail!”

“Kill! Continue to kill! If all else fails, cast soul ignition!!”

Demon King Chen Yu roared as his voice blasted out loudly over the battlefield.

Hearing this, the experts from Acheron Palace were shocked.

Under these circumstances, Demon King Chen Yu was still prioritizing his dignity?

He asked them to give it their all and cast soul ignition?

The experts from Acheron Palace were stunned as their faces turned dark.

Under normal circumstances, they would be willing to give it their all. But soul ignition?

Everyone knew that one would definitely die if they cast soul ignition.

All the experts from Acheron Palace had taken a very long time to reach where they were right now. Who would die willingly?

Most importantly, even if they risked their lives, they still might not be able to turn the tides of this battle, or even kill a few great emperors from Sanctuary Alliance.

Furthermore, even if they could kill a few great emperors, or destroy the Acheron Palace to disrupt the plans of Sanctuary Alliance, it would cost them six great emperors. It was not a worthy trade.

If they died this way, there would be no value or meaning in their deaths.

Who would be willing to do something like this?

Hence, the experts from Acheron Palace fell quiet after hearing the roar from Demon King Chen Yu. None of them chose to cast soul ignition.

The experts that Acheron Palace left in the Ancient Mystery Land transmitted a message to Demon King Chen Yu.

“Lord Demon King, the reinforcements from Sanctuary Alliance arrived at the Ancient Mystery Land. There are a total of six great emperors and countless almighties. They will reach Heaven Repairing Palace soon.”

Demon King Chen Yu’s face turned dark when he received this message. He was not surprised by this.

The Ancient Mystery Land was within the Eternal Chaotic World and was under the control of the Sanctuary Alliance.

The experts guarding Heaven Repairing Palace would definitely request reinforcement from Sanctuary Alliance when they were under attack. Sanctuary Alliance would send experts to reinforce immediately.

He planned to destroy the Heaven Repairing Palace and kill some experts from Sanctuary Alliance and flee before the reinforcements could arrive.

What actually happened was the Heaven Repairing Palace was not destroyed, but the reinforcements were already arriving.

He would be salty if he had to leave this way.

“Brat, you forced me to do this!!”

Demon King Chen Yu roared as a terrifying demonic mist boiled all around him. At the same time, streaks of blood-red secret restrictions lit up as they covered his whole body. He looked like he was made entirely out of blood.

At the same time, the aura he had grew to a whole new level.

“This is….” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

He could deduce that Demon King Chen Yu had used another secret skill to boost his power, and not soul ignition.

Demon King Chen Yu was risking his life and giving his all.

A stage three great emperor chose to risk his life?

How strong would he be then?

Jian Wushuang then experienced it firsthand.

“Die! Die! Die!”

Demon King Chen Yu roared with rage as his eight arms swung the divine weapons at Jian Wushuang. It approached Jian Wushuang from every possible angle.The speed and power of the attacks had reached a whole new level.

Jian Wushuang looked gloomy. Divine power boiled as he cast his sword skills again fearlessly.

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Waves of deafening collisions shook the entire battlefield.

With each collision, Jian Wushuang grunted.

With the sudden growth in power, Jian Wushuang took even more effort to fend off the attacks. After barely fending off these attacks, the aftershock of the attacks still managed to hurt him even though the Five Gem Armor had neutralizing effects.

Jian Wushuang’s current divine body was extremely powerful, yet the aftershocks of Demon King Chen Yu’s attack could still harm him. This proved how powerful the attacks were.
