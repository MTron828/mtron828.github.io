Chapter 2136 Baited

“Devil?”Jian Wushuang touched his nose as he looked at the people talking weirdly.

He knew that he was Devil the experts from the Three Emperors World were talking about.

Ever since he had destroyed the Supreme Emperor Stone, the security within the Imperial Palace had been much tighter and the rules much more stringent.

Furthermore, there were more experts on standby within the Imperial Palace to prepare for the upcoming battle.

This meant that there would be far more experts within the palace compared to before.

“If there are more experts in the palace, this means that we can kill more when we ambush them. The Three Emperors World will face a greater loss,” Jian Wushuang thought coldly.

“Everyone get ready. We are about to execute our plan.” Jian Wushuang messaged the other seven great emperors.

“Finally?”

“Haha, I can’t wait anymore.”

The seven great emperors inside the Blood Mountain Sword were all excited.

They had anticipated this since they knew what the mission was about.

Now, they were finally going to start the mission for real.

Throughout the journey, Jian Wushuang had also communicated with Emperor Bai and asked him about his preparations.

Ever since the Supreme Emperor Stone had been destroyed and the formation surrounding the Dark Millstone had collapsed,?the spacetime was no longer restricted and Jian Wushuang could transmit messages with the outside world easily.

After receiving Jian Wushuang’s message, Emperor Bai gathered the experts from Sanctuary Alliance and Special Tribes Alliance.

Everything was prepared quickly and everyone was ready to go.

After taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang moved.

He flew towards the three statues.

Since they were going to ambush, they should ambush a place where there would be a large number of people. At the foot of the Three Emperors World, that was where the highest number of experts gathered.

Thousands of experts in the realm of Chaotic Realm who were sat in front of the statues were meditating. They were densely packed in that small space.

“Sword Emperor, even though there are many almighties here, there are no great emperors. It would be better if we attracted a few great emperors here.” Abysmal Saint Master said.

“Yes, I understand.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head while he looked at the Imperial Cabinet.

There were three great emperors around the golden vortex guarding the Supreme Emperor Stone when it was still here. After the stone was destroyed, there was no need for a great emperor to be on guard anymore. Hence, most of the great emperors within the Three Emperors World stay within the Emperor Cabinet.

It would not be a wise choice if they decided to ambush the Emperor Cabinet directly as there were many great emperors residing within it. The best way was to attract the attention of a few great emperors and fight them beside the three large statues.

Just then, two figures were flying towards the space Jian Wushuang was in.

One was a handsome prince, the other was a teenage girl in green clothes.

Coincidentally, Jian Wushuang had met them before.

“Huh? Ling Tianhao?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Ling Tianhao and him had had a grudge when he’d first come to the Imperial Palace.

Back then, Jian Wushuang had masked his identity by pretending to be a rude, overpowering man Shou.

Now he was here for the second time, they met again.

“Haha. What a coincidence.” Jian Wushuang laughed. He thought for a moment. “I have an idea.”

Jian Wushuang fixed his gaze on Ling Tianhao as he flew towards him.

Ling Tianhao and the teenage girl in green clothes planned to meditate in front of the three statues.

Hum!!

A figure which radiated gloom and death appeared in front of them.

“What a powerful aura!” Ling Tianhao was shocked.

“The person radiating this aura is at least a person in Middle Stage Chaotic Realm!” The teenage girl in green clothes panicked.

The two people quickly calmed down and greeted the man humbly. “Is there a problem sir?”

“Humph. Are you Ling Tianhao?” Jian Wushuang asked coldly.

“Yes, I am.” Ling Tianhao replied, curious as to why the unknown man had asked him this.

“If that is the case, die. Your family and the Dan family tried to kill me. This is revenge.” Jian Wushuang attacked.

“Oh no!”

Ling Tianhao and the teenage girl in green clothes were caught by surprise.

The experts meditating in front of the statues were alarmed as they looked over in surprise.

They were surprised by his courage, not his power.

He had dared to attack within the Imperial Palace right in front of the three statues. He was neglecting the Imperial Cabinet and the rules within the palace.

The moment Jian Wushuang attacked…

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Many powerful auras erupted as six figures appeared. They were the six deacons in the Middle Stage Chaotic Realm.

“Stop!”

“You have courage, attacking so flagrantly within the Imperial Palace!”

“You better stop, or you will die!!”

Roars of anger were heard.

Hearing these roars, Jian Wushuang bellowed with laughter, “Haha. The few of you can’t stop me, Ancestor Hong Chen!”

Jian Wushuang’s blood-red hand grew in size as a terrifying aura radiated in all directions. The hand managed to force the six deacons back.

His aura was overbearing.

Many people in the crowd were stunned. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Its him, Ancestor Hong Chen?”

“The man who single-handedly exterminated the Dan Clan is here at the Imperial Palace?”

“No wonder he dared to attack others within the Imperial Palace. He is notorious for his lawlessness.”

Many of the experts exclaimed.

“Haha~~~”

Jian Wushuang continued to chase after Ling Tianhao ferociously.

“Oh no.”

The six deacons turned pale.

They were responsible for maintaining order around the three statues. If Ancestor Hong Chen killed Ling Tianhao, they would be severely punished.

Right then…

“Humph.”

A majestic grunt was heard.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang was elated.

“They took the bait.”
