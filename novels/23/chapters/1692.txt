Chapter 1693: Suppression

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Just as everyone was in a state of surprise…

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang created countless shadows instantly. At the same time as his body moved, the Hong Jun Golden Sword shook slightly and changed its direction toward Jian Wushuang.

As for Jian Wushuang’s target, it was Real God Han Quan of the Soaring Heaven King Palace.

“Not good!”

It was obvious that Real God Han Quan had realized Jian Wushuang’s intention as well. His expression then changed greatly at once and he did his best to escape.

However, he had been staying at the edge of the battlefield and he was not that far away from Jian Wushuang to begin with. Moreover, after Jian Wushuang wounded Sir God Qian Lan fatally, which caused everyone to be in a state of shock, he attacked him without any warning. In addition, his speed was extremely fast and when Real God Han Quan reacted, it was already too late.

The ray of golden light which was dragging its long tail like a comet appeared in front of Real God Han Quan instantly and attacked him right away.

Real God Han Quan swung the long spear in his hands immediately to block the attack.

However, in the end, with just one attack, bam! The long spear in Real God Han Quan’s hands was sent flying at once and the ray of golden light continued piercing Real God Han Quan’s body without any decrease in power.

“Puff!”

Real God Han Quan spit out a huge mouthful of blood again. His expression, which was already pale to begin with, became deathly pale like paper. His aura also plunged to rock bottom.

As for Jian Wushuang, his body had already appeared in front of Real God Han Quan and he swung the Blood Mountain Sword in his hands fiercely. Although he swung a long sword, the Blood Mountain Sword turned into a vast and lofty mountain in the next moment. The bottom of the lofty mountain then released many marvellous secret patterns and they covered Real God Han Quan completely. After that, the secret patterns threw Real God Han Quan, who was struggling madly, into the mountain.

After finishing that, the lofty mountain changed into a long sword again and appeared in Jian Wushuang’s hands.

While holding the Blood Mountain Sword tightly, Jian Wushuang shot a glance toward Real God Jiu Gong, the purple-robed old man, who was already far away and was escaping crazily.

“This Real God Jiu Gong is indeed very cunning,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

Originally, Jian Wushuang had planned to kill Real God Jiu Gong straight away and then suppress Real God Han Quan. However, Real God Jiu Gong was very intelligent. When Sir God Qian Lan appeared on the battlefield, he ran away to a distant void and he was not like Real God Han Quan who stayed at the edge of the battlefield as he was extremely confident in Sir God Qian Lan.

In the end, Jian Wushuang took action abruptly and Real God Han Quan was suppressed by him as he could not escape in time. As for Real God Jiu Gong, Jian Wushuang had no way to deal with him again.

“However, even if Real God Jiu Gong were unable to escape in time, it would probably not be that easy for me to kill him,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

Real God Jiu Gong was ranked fifth in the Real God ranking list.

He was not just strong in terms of abilities. Instead, he was also strong in terms of his many techniques and in particular, his techniques to stay alive.

It should be known that even the Lineage of Star was unable to do anything against him. It was said that even the Star Palace Master of the Lineage of Star had gone after him personally before. However, he had still managed to escape. Although Jian Wushuang had injured Sir God Qian Lan seriously, he would not be that arrogant and think that he was stronger than the Star Palace Master.

“Jian Wushuang!”

All of a sudden, a voice which was filled with an infinite amount of anger could be heard and even the whole universe became filled with an unlimited amount of anger.

At that moment, Sir God Qian Lan’s hair and moustache were blown up. His body was also emitting an extremely frightening aura which caused everyone to be terrified. In addition, his eyes were scarlet in color, like a demon’s.

As for the experts who hid themselves near the void, even though they were far away, they could still feel the shocking anger from Sir God Qian Lan.

“Why? Could it be that Sir God Qian Lan still wishes to fight with me?” Jian Wushuang laughed coldly. The Hong Jun Golden Sword which was floating quietly beside him shook abruptly and it looked as if it could change into a ray of golden light again anytime to attack.

After Sir God Qian Lan glanced at Jian Wushuang, an unusual light flashed in his eyes and his expression turned gloomy like water, “Release Han Quan. If not, the Soaring Heaven King Palace will fight with you to our last gasp!”

“Haha, what a joke. Could it be that the Soaring Heaven King Palace and I are not already fighting to our last gasp now?” Jian Wushuang sneered wantonly. “Since we have already fought to this extent, there is nothing for me to fear.”

Jian Wushuang’s words had caused the hidden experts to nod their heads in agreement.

Indeed, since Jian Wushuang and the Soaring Heaven King Palace had fought to such an extent, it had been considered a fight to their last gasp a long time ago.

At that moment, Sir God Qian Lan still used fighting to their last gasp to threaten Jian Wushuang. However, his words were totally meaningless.

“Jian Wushuang, looks like you really want to start a huge battle between the Soaring Heaven King Palace and the Lineage of Star.” Sir God Qian Lan’s voice was gloomy and cold, “A great battle between two top powerhouses will involve many things. Hence, I advise you to think thoroughly. Even if you are not thinking for yourself, you have to think of the Lineage of Star which is behind you.”

“A great battle? Sir God Qian Lan, don’t use a great battle to frighten me. Even if we were to go into a great battle, what about it? The Soaring Heaven King Palace is indeed strong. However, do you think that the Lineage of Star is afraid of them?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were icy-cold. When he had clashed with the Soaring Heaven King Palace head-on, he had already checked with Hall Master Yuan.

Hall Master Yuan also told him before… that he could just go for it and not be worried about anything. With the Lineage of Star as well as the Palace Master present, even the heavens would not collapse!

Hall Master Yuan’s words had caused Jian Wushuang to be extremely confident and he did not have any more worries.

“Moreover, even if a great battle were to occur, it would not be caused by me. Instead, it would be caused by the Soaring Heaven King Palace!” Jian Wushuang bellowed.

“Damn it. You have killed quite a number of the Soaring Heaven King Palace’s Chaotic Real Gods in succession and you still dare to say that the great battle is started by the Soaring Heaven King Palace?” Sir God Qian Lan became furious at once.

“Hmph, I killed them as they deserved to die,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold and gloomy. After that, he waved his big hands and a video appeared in the void immediately.

In the video, there were two people. One of them was Jian Wushuang while the other person was Real God Zi Ye who had already died.

In the video, both of them were standing opposite each other with a huge distance between them. The conversation that they were having also could be heard across the universe.

During the conversation, it was obviously mentioned that at the very start, as Real God Gu Ying had cast his greedy eyes on Jian Wushuang’s Grade Three Demon Core, he had taken the initiative to snatch it from Jian Wushuang.

As for Jian Wushuang, he had killed Real God Gu Ying in order to protect himself.

Even Real God Zi Ye himself admitted to it.

Moreover, Real God Zi Ye even said in the end, “No matter what the reason is, as long as you kill the Soaring Heaven King Palace’s people, you must die!”

After that, both of them started to fight.

When the video came to an end, the truth was exposed in front of everyone. As for the experts who were hidden at the void nearby, all of them saw it and heard it clearly.

“Sir God Qian Lan, do you have anything left to say now?” Jian Wushuang’s cry reverberated across the universe.

The video was made back then when Jian Wushuang had intentionally led Real God Zi Ye to do what he did.

Back then, he had thought that such a situation would occur in the future. Hence, he was prepared for it and he had recorded the video. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

With the video present, at the very least, the ‘reasoning’ was on Jian Wushuang’s side.
