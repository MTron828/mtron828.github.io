Chapter 1114: A Huge Commotion

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Hearing those words, Jian Wushuang nodded in agreement.

He was very ambitious. If possible, he wished to advance his three Sword Principles to the strongest level. He could then integrate them and create an unprecedented Dharma Body.

However, he knew what a challenge it would be. Right now, he only wished to develop the strongest Sword Principle as his foundation and become a Dao Master. His strength would surely skyrocket afterward.

That feat was much easier said than done.

“Take it easy.”?Jian Wushuang tried to comfort himself.

Just as he was stewing in his thoughts…

“Buzz!”

Out of nowhere, a mighty aura erupted in the middle of the mountain range.

The moment it did, a rich aroma of elixir wafted out and began to fill the area. The Celestial Masters who were looking for Life Elixirs in the same area were shocked by the unexpected phenomenon.

“What happened?”

“The scent is so strong! How did it permeate the entire area?”

“Something big must have happened!”

…

Jian Wushuang also caught wind of the situation and his expression immediately turned serious.

“If I’m not mistaken, it must be the birth of a precious treasure! It could very well be some sort of elixir-related treasure. Go and have a look!” Gu King urged in a low voice.

Jian Wushuang nodded in response, and then quickly headed toward the source of the scent.

Simultaneously, other Celestial Masters from Green Fire Palace and the Jin Kingdom had also rushed over to the same spot.

Everyone knew that a rare treasure must have arrived for it to cause such a commotion.

It was likely that the treasure had something to do with the Life Elixirs that were scattered throughout this area.

Undoubtedly, the treasure had sparked the interest of many.

The scent could be traced to the center of the mountain range.

It took Jian Wushuang three days to arrive on the scene. Once there, he was surprised to find that the dense scent showed no signs of dissipating even after so many days.

He hovered high above as he overlooked the land before him. The ground had collapsed and sunk in to form a sinkhole. A faint golden light could be seen peeping out of the sinkhole. That was where the smell came from.

“As expected, a treasure has arrived,” Gu King said excitedly.

“The treasure caused such a huge commotion and its scent hasn’t dissipated even after three days. I wonder what it is is,” Jian Wushuang said, looking doubtful.

Just then, three figures flew toward Jian Wushuang and soon appeared before him.

Jian Wushuang greeted them with a smile. “Celestial Master Yi, Celestial Master Meng Long, and Celestial Master Jin Qu.”

“My friend, Jian Wushuang,” they said with great enthusiasm.

They had also rushed over after catching wind of the commotion. They were evidently not far from the sinkhole when they noticed and thus, arrived ahead of him. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Did you find any Life Elixirs after searching this area for so many years?” Yi asked. He smiled so widely that his eyes narrowed into slits.

“Some. What about you?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“We managed to find some in the first few years, but later on… More and more experts came to this area and our chances were lowered. Even if we did manage to find it, other experts would hurry over and fight us for it. Luckily, the three of us joined forces in the fights and scraped through them, or else…” Yi sighed.

Jian Wushuang had nothing else to say for he knew that his friend was telling the truth. In the past 17 years, countless experts joined the search for Life Elixirs. Battles were unavoidable and they had only gotten more intense over the years. Though the three of them could work together, their combined strength was still pretty average compared to other experts in this area.

“Since you’re around the area, do you know what happened in the sinkhole that day? Did a treasure appear?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“The treasure did appear but it’s still in the early stage of incubation, so it’s buried within. Two hours ago, a Green Fire Palace expert broke into the sinkhole out of curiosity. He couldn’t see anything except a dazzling golden light. When he tried to approach the golden light, a defensive barrier stopped him,” Yi answered.

“What?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up with surprise. “A golden light? A barrier?”

“Since the treasure is protected by a defensive barrier, it can only mean that it is controlled by some spirit. Judging from the rich aroma of elixir, the treasure is likely a palace treasure for storing elixirs,” Gu King replied.

Jian Wushuang immediately understood his explanation.

“It’s the same for Jin Kingdom experts. In the end, everyone came to the same conclusion that we should just wait patiently for the actual birth of the treasure. Once it’s completely revealed, we will then fight for it,” Meng Long added.

“Alright, let’s just wait for it.”

Jian Wushuang had no choice but to hover around and quietly await the birth of the treasure with his friends.

Before they knew it, a month had gone by just like that.

During this period, the scent of the elixir that emitted from the bottom of the sinkhole never once dissipated. The entire area was still saturated with the mighty aura.

But the treasure in the sinkhole had yet to be revealed.

In addition, experts from both Green Fire Palace and the Jin Kingdom, who were previously looking for Life Elixirs, had all came forth to gather around the sinkhole.

Everyone stayed put and quietly anticipated the birth of the treasure.

“There are so many experts here!”

Jian Wushuang could feel the different intense auras drifting in the air within his field of consciousness.

From what he could tell, there were over 30 Celestial Masters here. His field of consciousness was limited as he was only in the Eternal Realm. It could vaguely cover certain areas near the sinkhole but not anything further than that.

Fortunately, Jian Wushuang had the token of Green Fire Palace. With that, he could clearly know the number of their allies in the area.

“There’s a total of 42 experts from Green Fire Palace in this area?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

They were all Celestial Masters!

Moreover, he was counting only his allies. The Jin Kingdom would always have the upper hand in the battle if they were to fight against Green Fire Palace. Obviously, they would have even more experts on their side.

That meant there were more than 42 experts from the Jin Kingdom here!
