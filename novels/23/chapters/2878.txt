Chapter 2879: Cloud-Patterned Armor

——

It was a possible way for Jian Wushuang to improve his realm.

After all, he had consumed two million saint elixirs from Mo Tao. However, he had used only 200,000 of them to break through to an elementary Great Divine Master level, and the remaining 1.8 million saint elixirs were used to accumulate divine power.

In addition, he had refined 500,000 sacred elixirs from Young Master Qu and the others in the past three years, which had allowed him to accumulate enough divine power. As a result, he was not far from the rank of Senior Great Divine Master.

Jian Wushuang estimated that he only needed another 400,000 sacred elixirs to break through to the rank of Senior Great Divine Master.

When that time came, his divine power would soar again. Even though his comprehension of the rules, sword principle, and absolute arts were not as good as that of Realm Lord Tian Qu, he would still be able to increase his divine power significantly by using various secret skills, even if his divine power were more potent than that of Realm Lord Tian Qu, he would still be able to compete with Realm Lord Tian Qu head-on.

However, he did not have the 400,000 sacred elixirs on hand at the moment.

“I have to find a way to deal with some treasures,” Jian Wushuang murmured.

He had many treasures, many of which were extremely valuable.

Besides the few treasures that he could use, there were three treasures that he could sell in exchange for sacred elixirs.

He also had three treasures in his hand. They were silver armor, a baby-sized black beast statue, and a dark-gray jade slip.

All three treasures came from the same place, the secret realm in the Pill Sun Sacred World, and they were all from Elder Gu.

When Jian Wushuang first went to the secret realm and met Elder Gu for the first time, the Elder gave them an opportunity. It was an interspatial ring, which many of them fought for. But, in the end, the interspatial ring fell into Jian Wushuang’s hands.

All three treasures came from the interspatial ring, and they were all precious.

“This jade slip… contains teleportation. It can be used to save my life at critical moments. It’s scarce. Although I haven’t encountered a crisis where I need to use teleportation to escape, I can’t guarantee that I won’t encounter it in the future. So I’d better keep this token,” Jian Wushuang muttered. He put the jade slip back into his interspatial ring.

“This strange beast statue… has such a strong destructive power. Although I haven’t comprehended the destructive power, this statue is of no use to me. However, I have a feeling that this strange beast statue is extraordinary. Maybe it will have other uses in the future.” Jian Wushuang pondered for a moment. Finally, he put the strange beast statue back into his interspatial ring.

Two of the three treasures had been put back into his interspatial ring, so there was only one treasure left in front of Jian Wushuang. It was the silver armor, the cloud-pattern armor!

“Cloud-pattern armor, a protective armor at the level of a holy treasure!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled.

A holy treasure was worth a lot.

An offensive magic weapon at the level of a holy treasure was like that, but a protective armor was even more expensive.

Unfortunately, the protective armor was only at the level of a third-grade ordinary holy treasure, and it was not a natal armor, so its value was significantly reduced. However, it was definitely worth 400,000 saint elixirs, or even more.

“I have my golden armor on the protective armor. It’s enough for a short period. This cloud pattern armor is not fatal, so it’s of no use to me. In the future, as my strength continues to increase, I’ll probably see a protective armor at this level often. It Won’t be a rare thing. It’s just right to sell it for saint elixirs.” Jian Wushuang had made up his mind.

He immediately took out a token.

This token was Mo Tao’s communication token.

“Brother Mo, I have something to ask you.” Jian Wushuang sent a message directly.

“What is it?” Mo Tao replied very quickly, and his attitude was still very gentle. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“It’s like this. I have protective armor at the level of a holy treasure. I want to exchange this protective armor for a saint elixirs, but I don’t know how much I can exchange for it.” Jian Wushuang asked.

“A protective armor at the level of a holy treasure?” Mo Tao was slightly surprised and said, “You are blessed. Although, of course, you are only a Divine Master, you have a treasure that many Immortal Saints are envious of. A protective armor at the level of a holy treasure is something that many Immortal Saints do not have.”

“Um…” Jian Wushuang smiled awkwardly.

He also knew that Mo Tao was telling the truth.

Protective armor at the holy treasure level was not standard in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. Among the Immortal Saints in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow, very few had it.

“My friend, I wonder what level the protective armor is? Is it the natal armor?” Mo Tao asked.

“It’s not the natal armor. It’s not high level. It’s just an ordinary third-grade holy treasure,” Jian Wushuang said.

“In that case, your armor won’t be precious, but it’s more than enough for one million saint elixirs,” Mo Tao said.

“One million saint elixirs?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up.

He only needed about 400,000 saint elixirs to break through to the Advanced Divine Master level. One million saint elixirs were far more than he needed.

“It’s a pity that I gave you two million sacred elixirs. Although I still have some, they have other uses. Otherwise, you can give me the armor, and I’ll give you one million sacred elixirs,” Mo Tao said.

“Brother Mo, you’ve helped me a lot. How could I dare to trouble you again?” Jian Wushuang smiled and said, “But is there a place in the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City where I can sell the armor?”

“Yes.” Mo Tao nodded. “The Dragon-phoenix Sacred City is the territory of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. Although there is no Star Pavilion here, the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion also runs a Dragon-phoenix Pavilion shop. The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion is located in the four markets of the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City. You can go there. Moreover, the four markets of the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City have powerful restriction arrays. For example, there are restrictions for fighting. You can go there and sell it without worry.”

“I understand. Thank you, brother Mo,” Jian Wushuang said gratefully.

After breaking off the communication with Mo Tao, Jian Wushuang immediately set off for the nearest big market.

Although it was called a market, it was like a large city, bustling with noise and excitement.

There was indeed a layer of significant restriction around the market. Even if the limitation had not been activated, it still gave off a strong feeling. Even the Immortal Saint himself might not be able to break the restriction.

After entering the market, Jian Wushuang headed straight for the Dragon and Phoenix Tower.
