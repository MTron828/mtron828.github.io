Chapter 299: Sensation!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Everyone in Heartless City was stunned.

“Jian Wushuang will fight to the death with the Lord of Skywave Prefecture outside of Heartless City in three days?”

“He’s challenging the Mansion Master!”

“Protector Swordsman wants to challenge the Lord of Skywave Prefecture!”

“Wow! Wow! Wow!”

A great cheer suddenly rose throughout the whole city.

The Lord of Skywave Prefecture ranked 21st on the Bloodmoon List, which meant he was very powerful.

Though he was just at the Half-saint level, he had the battle strength of an expert in the Saint Realm.

Ordinary experts were not qualified to challenge him. However, Jian Wushuang proved himself after he easily killed Huangfu Ming, so no one dared to question his strength.

The black-clothed elder was scared and murmured, “I will tell him.”

Then he and the other experts of Skywave Prefecture left.

It caused a sensation in Heartless City.

Leng Rushuang and her sister stood in the air near the city.

“He is challenging the Lord of Skywave Prefecture in three days. How bold!” Leng Rushuang spoke without a flicker of emotion in her eyes.

“Sister, If he loses the fight with the Lord of Skywave Prefecture, will you save him?” the girl asked.

“He is looking for death. Why should I save him?” Leng Rushuang replied in a low voice.

“Sister...” The girl, who was not satisfied with her elder sister’s answer, anxiously cried out. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Shortly after, Heartless City became quiet, but many experts were excited.

The news that Jian Wushuang easily killed Huangfu Ming and challenged the Lord of Skywave Prefecture in three days spread through the Skywave Prefecture and also caused a sensation.

In the huge mansion, the Lord of Skywave Prefecture asked in surprise, with hands behind his back, “Swordsman killed Huangfu Ming without using all of his strength?” He did not expect things would progress like that.

“He said that he didn’t have to perform the eighth move, but I don’t know whether it’s true or not,” the black-clothed elder answered respectfully.

“Interesting.” The Lord of Skywave Prefecture lifted the corner of his mouth and showed a terrifying smile. “I didn’t expect that there was such a strong expect in Skywave Prefecture. It’s no wonder that he dared to offend our Skywave Prefecture.

“Will you fight to the death with me?

“Fine. It has been a long time since anyone dared to challenge me!

“Tell them that I will cut off Swordsman’s head and hang it at our prefecture gate in three days.”

“Yes.”

The black-clothed elder followed the order and immediately went to spread the news.

Soon, the whole prefecture knew their Lord accepted the challenge.

“He will cut off Swordsman’s head and hang it at his prefecture gate in three days! How domineering!”

“The Lord of Skywave Prefecture seems to be really angry.”

“I’m looking forward to this fight between the Lord of Skywave Prefecture and Swordsman.”

Countless experts anticipated this fight, which caused a large number of experts to arrive in Heartless City to watch the ultimate fight between Swordsman and the Lord of Skywave Prefecture.

The Heartless Sect fell into a frenzy during these three days.

In a meeting hall, the Master of Heartless Sect looked at Jian Wushuang and said, “Swordsman, you will fight with the Lord of Skywave Prefecture, who has battle strength equivalent to the Saint Realm. Do you have confidence in defeating him?”

“Protector Swordsman.” Bei Mu and Leng Yang spoke.

When they heard Swordsman was challenging the Lord of Skywave Prefecture, all of them became excited. But now they were worried that their First Protector would fail.

After all, the Lord of Skywave Prefecture was famous for his strength.

It had been several years since he became well-known in the Tang Dynasty. Swordsman, on the other hand, was too young and had a lower cultivation. They believed Swordsman would be able to defeat the Lord of Skywave Prefecture in several years, but right now...

“Don’t worry. Since I dared to challenge him, I’m prepared for it,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

He was not comforting himself; he did have confidence.

He had made great progress during this year of practice. He originally planned to challenge the Lord of Skywave Prefecture after a period of time. Now he was just bringing the schedule forward a bit earlier than he had planned.

Time was fleeting! Three days passed quickly.

On the night before the fight, Jian Wushuang sat alone in the center of his courtyard. His Realm of Sword Essence spread out like the tide, covering the whole yard.

The sword essence was terrifying.

Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes, raised his head, and looked up into the dark night sky, with the flash of a smile on his face.

“There he is.”

Whoosh! A figure appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

The figure wore a wicked blood-red mask, with a sharp sword on his back. It was his Slaughter Doppelganger, Nan.

Over the past year, Jian Wushuang meditated on the World Origin in the Heartless Sect, while his Slaughter Doppelganger traveled around, challenging experts everywhere.

Nan was famous now.

“Nan ranks 36th on the Bloodmoon List and seems to be at the Half-saint Level. He has comprehended Slaughter Origin and fought with 10 Half-saint experts. Nine of them were killed by him and only one expert was lucky enough to survive. There is no doubt that he possesses a soaring battle strength.”

This was the introduction of Nan on the Bloodmoon List.

Nan was only suspected to be a Half-saint expert because he was a Slaughter Doppelganger and could hide his Spiritual Power and aura so perfectly that others could not see his real cultivation. They made their judgment only according to the strength he showed.

In fact, his Slaughter Doppelganger’s cultivation, which was determined by his own level, was only at the Profound Yang Void Realm.

“I cannot only depend on myself to fight against the Lord of Skywave Prefecture, so I called you back,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

Nan nodded slightly and then walked toward Jian Wushuang. In the next moment, the Slaughter Doppelganger and Jian Wushuang completely merged into one.

His Triple-kill Sword was also back in his hand.

“The Triple-kill Sword...”

Jian Wushuang looked at the Killing Sword, that possessed a roaring killing intent, and fondled it. The Triple-kill Sword began quivering slightly, as if it was responding to its owner.

Jian Wushuang wore a smile and said, “Everything depends on tomorrow!”

This night, Jian Wushuang sat alone in the courtyard all night.
