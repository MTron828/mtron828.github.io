Chapter 5498 ¬†Sarcasm

Jian Wushuang stood to the side, his face darkened.

Did Si Tian have to react like this?

Back then, he didn't seem to have embarrassed the other party so much!

It was as if he couldn't afford the money. If it weren't for losing all the treasures, he really wanted to throw godstones at Si Tian's face.

"How about it? Wushuang, aren't you coming in?" Si Tian looked at Jian Wushuang with a face as black as ink, feeling quite pleased.

Jian Wushuang coldly said, "No, I'm afraid going in will disturb my state of mind again!"

"Haha, why would that be? Brother Wushuang, you have extraordinary talent. How could you be demoralized!" Si Tian laughed heartily.

The tier 5 Emperor presiding over this place also realized that Si Tian was intentionally embarrassing Jian Wushuang.

Seeing the triumphant expression on the other's face, Jian Wushuang really wanted to go up and beat him up.

However, if he started a fight here, he would definitely be at a disadvantage. Right now, he was alone.

"Hmm?" Si Tian initially thought it was almost time to go in and was about to enter directly. Just now, he saw Jian Wushuang, thinking about how to mock him, almost forgetting the familiar aura of the Beast God Weapon that he knew so well.

Only now did he notice that Jian Wushuang didn't have that aura.

This surprised him!

He had always been keeping an eye on the Beast God Weapon. Although he now possessed even the Eternal Treasure, the uniqueness of the Beast God Weapon was widely recognized. Over the years, he had searched in the Heavenly Realm and even obtained another component of the Beast God Weapon through the support of his forces.

"The Skull of the Beast God!"

With a significant increase in his consciousness and Thought power, his greed for the Beast God Weapon grew even stronger. He even secretly thought about dealing with Jian Wushuang.

But he never found a suitable opportunity.

Now, encountering Jian Wushuang, he discovered that the Beast God Weapons on Jian Wushuang's body had disappeared.

This kind of treasure usually wouldn't leave its owner. How could it disappear?

With so many people around and prying eyes, he didn't dare to ask too much!

Whoosh!

A rift appeared in space, and a woman with an unparalleled beauty walked out of it.

"Jian Wushuang?" The newcomer was astonished upon seeing Jian Wushuang!

The person who emerged from the rift was none other than Gong Miaoyi.

"Gong Miaoyi?" Jian Wushuang was somewhat surprised and asked, "How did you end up in there?"

Gong Miaoyi smiled faintly, exuding charm, and said with amazement, "Don't you know that after going to the Beiwang Tower, everyone comes here for recovery?"

In the valley, one could not only restore their mental state but also rejuvenate their Origin Source and even their divine body.

It was a sacred place for cultivation.

"Daoist Miaoyi!" It seemed like even Emperor Si Tian recognized the other person, which surprised Jian Wushuang.

Gong Miaoyi remained unmoved, saying casually, "Si Tian!"

What surprised Jian Wushuang even more was that a tier 6 Emperor walked out of the crack afterward, and Gong Miaoyi directly hooked her arm around his.

"Umm?" Jian Wushuang was utterly speechless. He wasn't even gone that long, and she was already taken by someone else?

"Master!" Seeing the newcomer, Emperor Si Tian respectfully bowed down.

The tier 5 Emperor who presided over this place approached with even more flattery!

On the side, Jian Wushuang stood like a fool. Once again, he had been played by Gong Miaoyi. No wonder the Thought power avatar inside her had disappeared; it turned out the tier 6 Emperor had removed it.

What's more surprising was that this tier 6 Emperor was Si Tian's master.

He felt like an outsider now, standing aside in silence.

In the end, Gong Miaoyi walked forward, bidding Jian Wushuang a farewell that lacked warmth.

No wonder, he discovered in his cave that Gong Miaoyi had even taken his meditation cushion. She had indeed found a strong support.

Out of all people, she had to choose his mortal enemy.

If he had known, he would have offered Gong Miaoyi to Wu Zuo. Judging by Wu Zuo's appearance, he didn't seem like a lecherous person. Alternatively, he could have gifted her to the old man with goat horns.

But now, she had flown right into the hands of his adversary.

Jian Wushuang felt quite wronged. After all, he was the one who brought her here. He still remembered the first time Gong Miaoyi came to the Elder Palace, looking as clueless as a country bumpkin, cultivating under a tree.

Now, she had undergone a complete transformation, freely entering and leaving this valley that had once intimidated him. ViiSiit nùíêvelbùíä/n(.)c/(ùíê)m for lùíÇtest ùíèùíêvels

What was going on?

After everyone had left, Jian Wushuang had no mood to go inside.

However, upon hearing Gong Miaoyi mention that the Emperor who went to the Beiwang Tower would come to this place, he was genuinely interested.

"Kid, you have no chance now. Brother Si Tian brought you in just now. If you don't enter, it will cost you 100 million cubic godstones!" The tier 5 Emperor presiding over the area spoke with a cold expression.

Jian Wushuang felt somewhat resentful and said, "What about Gong Miaoyi? How did she get in?"

Hearing this, the tier 5 Emperor sneered, "You comparing yourself to her? You have to pay to enter, but not only does she not need to pay, she also gets a substantial reward. Do you understand?"

"I don't understand!" Jian Wushuang left without another word.

Indeed, he didn't understand. This kind of sycophantic behavior seemed low-level, especially selling one's own body.

In his view, it was a foolish act that inflicted significant damage to one's state of mind.

He left directly, heading towards the Yuanyang Island.¬† Jian Wushuang decided to take a look at the Beiwang Tower.

Many seemed familiar with the tower, but he was somewhat ignorant about it. All he knew was that it was a Temporal Treasure, containing a complete Universe Origin Source.

Apart from that, his knowledge was limited.

He wondered if there was an entrance fee to the Beiwang Tower.

Being penniless was truly terrifying, especially in the Elders Palace, where one couldn't go anywhere without money.

Jian Wushuang didn't want to experience the awkward situation that happened on Fenyang Island.

Though he had a thick skin and didn't care much, he still didn't want to embarrass himself.

Strength was the ultimate language; if someone was stronger, insults could be endured, but once his strength surpassed the opponent's, he would retaliate with force.

It was that simple.

Having sensed the aura on Si Tian, he noticed it belonged to the Beast God Weapon, stronger than before. It indicated that Si Tian had acquired components of the Heart Beast God Weapon.

Jian Wushuang needed to figure out how to deal with the Beast God Weapon in Si Tian's possession.

Kill!

However, that wasn't possible here in the Elders Palace. He hadn't reached the point where he could act recklessly.

If he were still allied with Shen Ling, he could coordinate from within, but he had decided to completely sever ties with Shen Ling.

There was no way to proceed like that.

He could only resolve it from within!

He didn't know if the Elders Palace had an arena like the one in the Grand Xia Capital.

A life-and-death battle!

Winning meant gaining everything, while losing meant death.

It was a great place, but unfortunately, the Elders' Palace didn't have such a facility.

Jian Wushuang arrived at Yuanyang Island and walked into the city.

As soon as he entered, he sensed two familiar auras.

Dongshen and Wanyan!

He didn't expect these two to leave the Demon-Sealing Space so quickly. It made sense; he had lost his Universe Origin Source, so the other party's universe inheritance naturally fell apart.

However, he didn't know if they were aware that everything was related to him.

If they found out, contacting them in the future might become difficult.

He had to be cautious.

But the two auras were approaching him, having noticed him.

Jian Wushuang felt a bit awkward, unsure whether to stay or leave.
