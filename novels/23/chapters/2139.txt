Chapter 2140 Unstoppable Part 1

Three stage two great emperors attacked together.Additionally, thirteen other stage-one great emperors attacked with their most powerful skills.

There were many different types of attack, and each attack could easily kill an emperor god.

At that moment, the sixteen attacks flew towards the space Jian Wushuang was standing in.

Boom!!!

A loud boom.

The heaven and earth shooked.

Living things in the vicinity trembled in fear.

The space that Jian Wushuang was standing in was covered in a terrifying storm of divine power.

This storm was humongous and it seemed that no great emperor could survive the strangling power of the storm.

“Is he dead?”

One of the sixteen great emperors who stood in front asked as he stared at the storm.

“Dead?” Ling Zong shook his head as he looked ahead grimly.

He clearly knew how scary Jian Wushuang was. He had fought thirteen great emperors fearlessly over ten years ago. He had had no injuries no matter how many hits he suffered. How could he die so easily with his unmatched self-defense mechanism?

Sure enough… a sword light lit up the entire storm of divine power.

The terrifying aura of the sword light chopped the storm into half.

From the middle of the storm, the same ten-foot tall figure appeared again.

He was still equally powerful and unrestrained. This time, Jian Wushuang dashed towards the sixteen great emperors.

“Watch out! The Devil is here!!!”

Ling Zong screamed as his divine power boiled.

Every great emperor stood prepared and looked serious.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang was very fast. He appeared in front of the sixteen great emperors and swung his Blood Mountain Sword.

A powerful sword essence burst forth. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Sword Principle Xuan Luo…. Blast Rainstorm

It had the speed of a gale and contained the power of a thunderstorm.

Jian Wushuang slashed out mercilessly towards six great emperors.

The six great emperors turned pale when they saw the sword light.

“Let us work together and deflect this attack.”

“Yes!”

The six great emperors made the decision and made their own moves.

A terrifying boom exploded as the sword light demolished the attacks the six great emperors had cast and the aftershocks swept out.

Out of the six great emperors, three of them grunted as blood seeped out of the corner of their mouths. The remaining three flew back like cannonballs.

Six great emperors tried to deflect the attack from Jian Wushuang.

The results: the six great emperors had lost!!

Hum!!

A surging aura came from behind Jian Wushuang. It was a battleaxe so large that it filled the sky. It took the chance Jian Wushuang was making his sword skill and ambushed him. The axe was aiming for the head in an attempt to behead him.

Jian Wushuang did not even bother looking at the axe as he swung his sword casually.

Even though it was a casual swing, the power it contained was still terrifying.

One who had great strength could overpower ten others!

Clang!

The sound of collision could be heard clearly as the shadow of the axe dissipated. The master of the axe backed off quickly as he looked at Jian Wushuang savagely. He spat out a mouth of blood in the process.

The blood covered his body armour as his aura weakened.

“Jian Wushuang has become much stronger than before!”

“The last time I fought him, I was only at a slight disadvantage when he attacked me with full force. Now, his casual attacks can deflect my most powerful attack and injure me severely?”

“Stage three!”

“His fighting power must have reached stage three!!!”

Ling Zong widened his eyes as he stared at Jian Wushuang. He was shocked.

Stage three great emperor! They were the true leaders among the experts in the Chaotic Realm.

Over the course of history, only three people had managed to reach it within the Three Emperors World.

These three had become the leaders of this world.

Now, the fighting power Jian Wushuang was displaying made Ling Zong think that he could be compared to Demon King Chen Yu.

At the same time that Ling Zong was marvelling at Jian Wushuang’s fighting power:

“Kill him!”

Angry roars filled the entire battlefield as the various great emperors continued their attacks.

The attacks were directed at Jian Wushuang as they approached from every angle possible.

The numerous great emperors started their besiege on Jian Wushuang.

Against these attacks, a unique sword essence could be felt radiating from Jian Wushuang.

At that moment, it was as though his large body had turned into a dark vortex that could swallow everything as Jian Wushuang slashed his sword in a weird way.

Sword Principle Xuan Luo… Mixed Elements Spirit!

Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Bang! Boom! ~~~

Waves of noise reverberated through the air as the attacks were all blocked by Jian Wushuang.

The terrifying power of the sword principle forced many great emperors back.

At that moment, a flash of killing intent could be seen in his eyes as Jian Wushuang attacked.

He crossed the distance between him and the closest great emperor and appeared beside him.

That was a mere stage-one great emperor.

Hua!

The sword light descended out of nowhere.

This sword light was the fastest style in the Sword Principle Xuan Luo: Turn Monstrous At One Thought!

“Watch out!!”

One of the other great emperors beside him said as a warning.

“What?” The lady in red cloak had a terrified expression on her face as she stared at the sword light approaching her.

“It is too fast! This slash is too fast!”

“I can’t do anything!”

Desperation was written all over her face as the sword light collided with her body.

Even though her body armour was extraordinary, it shattered under the sword light and allowed the slash to penetrate her body, killing her.

“This is the only the first.”

Jian Wushuang looked at the rest coldly as he picked up the Qian Kun Ring and the remaining treasures. He then continued to attack the remaining fifteen great emperors.

“Damn it!”

“Bastard!”

Terror could be seen on the faces of the remaining fifteen angry great emperors.

They worked together as sixteen great emperors with three stage-two great emperors when they initiated the attack on Jian Wushuang.

The result? Jian Wushuang remained unharmed while one of their comrades died.

What was this overbearing fighting power?
