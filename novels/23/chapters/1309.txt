Chapter 1310: Lineage of Scarlet

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the Dark Green Bell, there were two secret skills.

First, Immovable Mountain, which was used as a defense.

The other one was used for suppression. However, the Blood Mountain Sword possessed suppression power. Hence, the secret skill of suppression wasn’t much help to Jian Wushuang.

After Jian Wushuang obtained the Dark Green Bell, he stayed in the secret room to study the defense secret skill.

Just as he mastered the defense secret skill, he received a message from the Master of Scarlet Island.

“Jian Wushuang, quickly return to Scarlet Island.”

The Master of Scarlet Island only told him to make a trip back to the island but he didn’t mention what happened.

“I am going all out to prepare for the upcoming Inverse Cultivation Test and the Island Master surely knows this it too. If it wasn’t about anything important, he definitely wouldn’t bother me.”

Jian Wushuang was very certain about it.

The Master of Scarlet Island knew and he still called for him, so it must be urgent.

Jian Wushuang didn’t delay but immediately left to go back to the Scarlet Island.

Jian Wushuang arrived at Scarlet Island very quickly and met the Master of Scarlet Island.

In the lofty palace, there was another person besides Jian Wushuang and the Master of Scarlet Island. He was a skinny elderly with white eyebrows.

The elderly with white eyebrows had very long brows that were almost reaching his ear lobes.

“Jian Wushuang, let me introduce you. This is Master Uncle Tian Ying,” the master of Scarlet Island introduced.

“Master Uncle?” Jian Wushuang stunned.

He once obtained the most detailed information about Scarlet Island but it had never been brought up that there was a master uncle of the island master. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The aura of the master uncle was extremely tough, not any weaker as compared to the Master of Scarlet Island. He obviously was a Peak Universe God in the Second Heaven as well. However, Jian Wushuang had never heard the name Tian Ying before this.

“It seems that the Master of Scarlet Island ain’t as simple as he looks,” Jian Wushuang complimented, “However, it is only right and proper. He has been an overlord in Dayu World for so many years, how could he be as simple as he looks?”

Jian Wushuang thought and bowed before the elderly with white eyebrows for the first time, “Universe God Tian Ying, greetings from Jian Wushuang!”

The elderly with white eyebrows waved, “I cultivate in seclusion all year round and I had no idea that a prodigy like you had appeared in Scarlet Island!”

Universe God Tian Ying looked at Jian Wushuang with admiration.

He had been in seclusion all the time. He only received the message from the Master of Scarlet Island not long ago and found out about the existence of Jian Wushuang. He had also heard of Jian Wushuang’s achievements.

A Universe Master killed the strongest genius of Dayu World, Universe God Qing Yang who stood high above all Universe Gods in the First Heaven.

The achievement was simply astonishing!

Judging merely on the signs of the upcoming God’s Test which had taken the shape of pressuring thunderclouds, that sight itself was unbelievable.

Both incidents clearly showed that Jian Wushuang was a monster through and through.

“Jian Wushuang, I called you here today for just one matter,” the Master of Scarlet Island said.

Jian Wushuang looked at the Master of Scarlet Island.

While the Master of Scarlet Island exchanged a look with Universe God Tian Ying next to him and smiled, “I’ve discussed in detail with Master Uncle. We finally came to a decision for you to join the Lineage of Scarlet.”

“Lineage of Scarlet?” Jian Wushuang stunned.

He only knew about Scarlet Island, but what was the Lineage of Scarlet?

The Master of Scarlet Island wasn’t surprised when he saw Jian Wushuang in confusion. He explained, “Jian Wushuang, you might not know that the core of the Scarlet Island is actually the Lineage of Scarlet. However, there are not many experts in the Lineage of Scarlet in Scarlet Island. For instance, the real Lineage of Scarlet in the Scarlet Island are in fact now only Master Uncle and I.”

“It that so?” Jian Wushuang was convinced.

The Master of Scarlet Island continued, “Scartletian is founded by an expert above all the Universe Gods. He was once outstanding but he declined later on. Until now, he has only existed in Dayu World.”

“The Lineage of Scarlet has been passed down until now and there is an extraordinary secret skill. It’s called, Scarlet Kingdom!”

“Scarlet Kingdom?” Jian Wushuang’s pupils contracted.

He immediately recalled a message that he had once read.

The three overlords in Dayu World, including Scarlet Island, Golden-sun Sect and Holy Prefecture, although they were roughly the same in power, the strongest among the three overlords was definitely the Master of Scarlet Island.

As for the master of Golden-sun Sect and Holy Prefecture, although they were Peak Universe Gods in the Second Heaven, they were one notch below the Master of Scarlet Island in power.

The reason was because the Master of Scarlet Island gained fame through Scarlet Kingdom!

That technique was a very ferocious secret skill.

For the technique to be put to full play by a Peak Universe God in the Second Heaven like the Master of Scarlet Island, it was even scarier!

“Jian Wushuang, do you want to cultivate the Scarlet Kingdom?” The Master of Scarlet Island looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Cultivate the Scarlet Kingdom?” Jian Wushuang stared.

The Scarlet Kingdom was the technique that made the Master of Scarlet Island infamous. It was extremely fierce.

He, of course, would love to cultivate such a secret skill.

But, why would the Master of Scarlet Island pass on the secret skill to him so easily?

“Jian Wushuang, you are extremely gifted. If you were to pass the God’s Test, you would definitely have a bright future. However, the God’s Test isn’t ordinary. There’s a limit to how much I can help. The only thing that I could help you with, I reckon, would be the secret skill, Scarlet Kingdom,” the Master of Scarlet Island explained.

“However, Scarlet Kingdom is Lineage of Scarlet’s most important secret skill after all. Only members of the Lineage of Scarlet are qualified to cultivate the skill. I’ve discussed with Master Uncle. If you were to agree to join us as a Lineage of Scarlet, I can lead you to cultivate this secret skill.”

Jian Wushuang clasped his hands together. Even though he was tempted, Jian Wushuang replied honestly, “Island Master, to be frank, I will leave Dayu World for Snow Dojo after passing the God’s Test. Or maybe I will wander in other vast places. Hence, even if I become Lineage of Scarlet, I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to contribute much to the Lineage of Scarlet.”

The Master of Scarlet Island and Universe God Tian Ying smiled when they heard his reply.

The Master of Scarlet Island replied, “Jian Wushuang, don’t you worry, we Lineage of Scarlet do not restrain experts under our command. If you were to become Lineage of Scarlet, you could still do whatever that you wish. Even if you are away all year round, it wouldn’t be a problem. In the Lineage of Scarlet’s history, there were a few who were the Island Masters before me, who wandered on their own for years after they found a suitable successor.”

“But, there’s only one condition. If the Lineage of Scarlet were to be in a life and death situation one day, I will signal an SOS and I hope you will be able to come back in time to provide assistance!”
