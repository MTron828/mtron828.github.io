This was the entrance to tornado stream. Jian Wushuang had come here before and left a space mark here. After using space-time teleportation, he had returned to this place.

After getting rid of God Fei Master, Jian Wushuang began to think about the battle just now.

“After 600 years of cultivation, although my strength has greatly improved and I’m no weaker than an ordinary expert of the six realms of the void, it’s still very difficult for me to fight against an expert like God Fei Master who can exert the battle strength of the peak of the six realms of the void. At most, I can barely fight with her,” Jian Wushuang thought.

In the battle just now, he had not fought with God Fei Master for a long time, and he had forced her back twice. It did not seem like he was at a disadvantage, but Jian Wushuang knew very well, there was still a big gap between his strength and God Fei Master’s.

First, in terms of absolute arts, other than his strongest sword technique, the seven sword techniques of the Peerless Sword Manual, which he had created, were only at the threshold of level six absolute arts, or even barely, compared to God Fei Master’s Absolute Arts, there was a big gap.

Secondly, in terms of true treasures, God Fei Master’s offensive true treasures and true treasure armors were of a very high level, and he even had the assistance of a flying universe true treasure. Jian Wushuang’s true treasure armors were fine, but the level of Blood Mountain Sword…was a little too low.

Just these two points alone, God Fei Master could crush him without any scruples. Jian Wushuang had a bigger problem.

The reason why he could unleash power that was no less than that of an expert of the six void realms was because of his life divine power and the heaven-cleaving skill, it was equivalent to giving him two more levels of willpower.

However, the life divine power was fine, as it only stimulated the potential of a perfect creature. It would not be a burden to him, but the heaven-cleaving skill consumed a lot of his divine power.

As a perfect chaotic creature, his divine power was vast, hundreds of times more than that of a regular Principles Master. However, the heaven-cleaving skill consumed a lot of divine power. Even if Jian Wushuang used it at all costs…in a fierce battle, he could only use the heaven-cleaving skill about 20 times at most.

In other words, he could only use the power of an expert in the sixth realm in 10 or 20 attacks. The rest of his attacks could not meet that requirement.

Naturally, he could not keep fighting with such combat strength. Therefore, when he fought with God Fei Master just now, he chose to escape immediately after he had a simple understanding of her strength and used his strongest combat strength.

The reason was not that he did not want to continue fighting with God Fei Master, but because he could not keep his strongest combat strength and had to escape.

“Although this battle has not been long, I have already gained a lot,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

This battle allowed him to clearly understand his current strength and some of his shortcomings. He also understood how to improve his strength.

First of all, he had to improve his absolute arts.

He had to improve the seven sword moves of the Wushuang sword manual as soon as possible. This was the most urgent matter.

Secondly, he had to find a more powerful attack supreme treasure. “Search our n?wno?el.?rg”As for the Blood Mountain Sword, unless he found another expert to refine it, it would be difficult for it to meet his requirements.

As for finding a way to fuse all three rules that he had mastered, it would take a longer time. Jian Wushuang could only take it slowly.

Jian Wushuang was deep in thought when suddenly..

“Heavenly Sword Marquis.”

Heavy Master’s voice came from the void beside him.

Jian Wushuang came back to his senses and immediately looked over.

When he got rid of God Fei and returned to the entrance of tornado stream, he had already sent a message to Heavy Master. Heavy Master and Purple Sound Master, who had received the message, immediately rushed over.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, did you lose God Fei Master?” Heavy Master asked first.

“Yes.”Jian Wushuang nodded. “God Fei Master is very fast. Unfortunately, I have a space-time domain, which greatly limits his speed. He can’t catch up with me at all, so he had to leave.”

Jian Wushuang lied and did not tell Heavy Master and Purple Sound Master that he had actually fought with God Fei Master. Moreover, he had left in front of God Fei Master, so God Fei Master could only watch.

“It’s good that he has left. God Fei Master has been wandering in the depths of Devil Smoke Valley and killing crazily. Many experts have died at his hands. However, because he has killed too many people, experts from various forces in the star realms have become very wary of him. They have ordered to flee as soon as they see him. Our Star Palace has also given such an order.”

“I didn’t expect that God Fei Master would be so cunning. After knowing that the experts from various forces were on guard against him, he sneaked into the outer area and joined hands with Master Bitter Hand. He told Master Bitter Hand to leak his tracks in front of us to lure us to kill him. Meanwhile, he hid in the hurricane at the edge of tornado stream, waiting for us to fall into his trap!”

“Purple Sound Master and I fell for his trick and almost died at his hands. Fortunately, you arrived, Heavenly Sword Marquis,” Heavy Master said as he looked at Jian Wushuang. Suddenly…he bent down and gave Jian Wushuang a big bow.

“Heavy Master, what are you doing?”Jian Wushuang’s expression changed.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, don’t reject me. I have to give you this big bow. Not only to thank you for your kindness, but also to apologize to you for the contempt I showed you. I was stupid and blind. Now that I think about it, I’m really ashamed,” Heavy Master said sincerely.

“Heavy Master, you don’t have to do this,” Jian Wushuang said with a bitter smile.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, just let him be,” Purple Sound Master said. “If you don’t accept his gift, he won’t be able to survive for the rest of his life. You know, when I saw you outside the Star Palace stronghold, Heavy Master told me that you were courting death by wandering around Devil Smoke Valley alone.”

“Um...” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“I’m ashamed, I’m ashamed,” the Heavy Master apologized repeatedly.

Jian Wushuang shook his head and accepted the gift, but he did not care.

Axe One Master had given him information about many experts in the territory, including those in Star Palace. Of course, there was also an introduction about the Heavy Master.

In addition to his strength, the information also mentioned the character of the Heavy Master, which was reckless and one-track-minded. However, he was extremely loyal, which was evident from the time when Master Purple Sound Master was trapped, the Heavy Master had spared no effort to ask Marquis Duan Yu to help him.

Jian Wushuang was very willing to befriend such a person who valued loyalty.
