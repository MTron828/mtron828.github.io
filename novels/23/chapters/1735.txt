Chapter 1736: Soul Control

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“He didn’t die?”

Lei Chao’s face looked devastated as he stared at Jian Wushuang, “You kept your guard up?”

Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold and he remained silent.

He had kept his guard up.

It was a fundamental awareness after he knew that he had fallen into a trap.

Plus, he had already found it a little strange previously.

Firstly, according to Lei Chao, he had been chased after by Old Monster Sui Gu for a very long time. In the end, he had had no choice but to run into Buddhist Demon Sea but from the beginning till the end. No one saw the scene with their own eyes, only Lei Chao said so.

Secondly, even if he was really chased after, Lei Chao shouldn’t run so far onto the triangle island, which happened to be within the dark storm.

One should know that it would be extremely difficult if Jian Wushuang wanted to escape the dark storm. After all, there was restraint of dark wind blade.

When he thought about it carefully, something wasn’t right. But Jian Wushuang didn’t suspect Lei Chao.

But then, Lei Chao launched an attack at him.

“I want to know why,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Why? Hehe.” There was a burst of sudden cold laughter. The spiritual figure that had tried to assassinate Jian Wushuang twice appeared from nowhere next to Lei Chao.

The spiritual figure lifted his head and revealed an extremely ugly yet cold face. It was a lady’s face.

“Jian Wushuang, let me tell you why. It’s simple. Because this Lei Chao isn’t the Lei Chao from before,” the ugly-looking lady said.

Jian Wushuang’s face changed.

This Lei Chao wasn’t the Lei Chao before?

What does that mean…

“I understand now,” King of Venomous Worms said, “Jian Wushuang, if I’m not mistaken, Lei Chao should be soul-controlled.”

“Soul control?” Jian Wushuang stunned.

“Soul control is an extremely high-end technique to manipulate soul power. Under normal circumstances, only expert whose soul fire has transformed and become a complete soul, and also focused on soul attacks, would know how to perform this technique.”

“Plus, such a technique requires one’s soul strength to be higher by a few levels than the other party to succeed. For instance, Lei Chao was an expert on the Real God ranking list and he had at least lit his soul fire and gotten in contact with soul power. To perform soul control on such expert, the person who carried out the technique must have definitely already reached the level of Emperor God in terms of soul strength!” King of Venomous Worms said.

“Once a person is soul controlled, the person is pretty much dead. He is only left with a body. Their consciousness will obey the instructions of the controller unconditionally. Even if the controller wanted him to kill his wife and all his friends and family, he wouldn’t hesitate at all.

“I see,” Jian Wushuang’s face grew in distress. He then looked at Lei Chao as his body quivered.

He originally thought Lei Chao had betrayed him but it seemed that it wasn’t the truth. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Lei Chao was soul controlled and he had to do something despite himself.

“King of Venomous Worms, can this soul control technique be removed?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“There’s no way to remove it. Soul control technique is extremely vicious and barbaric. Once one is controlled, he will never be able to shake it off. Even if you killed the person who performed the technique, the person who was soul controlled would die too,” King of Venomous Worms said.

Jian Wushuang felt even more devastated when he heard that.

It was obvious that Lei Chao had been soul controlled and Jian Wushuang had no way of saving him.

Jian Wushuang took a deep breath. He suppressed his fright and anger as he took out a token to send Hall Master Yuan a message.

The context of the message was naturally Jian Wushuang’s misfortune and his decision.

After he sent the message, he put away the token. Then, his gaze immediately went sharp and cold.

He stole a glance at the ugly-looking lady, “Acheron Palace has good skills!”

“It seems like you’re not stupid,” the ugly looking lady smiled, “As you know that it is Acheron Palace who is doing this, you should understand that you stand no chance of living if Acheron Palace launches an attack. So, I advise you to kill yourself instead.”

“Kill myself? Because of you alone?” Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold. “Hail all experts that Acheron Palace have arranged. You won’t be able to kill me alone.”

“Of course,” the ugly looking lady smiled maliciously, “Four of you should take over now.”

Just as she spoke:

“Haha…”

“Young man, you’re quite capable, I see.”

“I never thought the four of us would have the opportunity to attack.”

A cold yet unbridled laughter spread in the dark storm. Then, figures in black robes appeared one after another from the nearby void.

There was a total of four figures in black robes. Every single one of their auras were shocking. They hemmed Jian Wushuang in the moment they appeared.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold as he glared at the four people surrounding him.

There were males and females among the four of them. Everyone brought about extraordinary pressure to Jian Wushuang. They were obviously out-and-out Sir God experts and they weren’t any ordinary Sir Gods.

Besides, Jian Wushuang had never seen the four of them. Among the Almighties that he knew, there weren’t any similar ones too.

“Four Sir Gods, also four top experts. In addition to the one who tried to assassinate me, there’s a total of five Sir Gods. Acheron Palace does think highly of me,” Jian Wushuang’s voice was low.

“No choice. You are so potent. With such great potential, even Acheron Palace has scruples. Hence, we naturally can’t make any careless mistakes when we launch the attack,” the ugly lady sneered.

“Jian Wushuang, you are really impressive. Mo Ying’s assassination power, not any one of us here could compare to her. Whoever she aims at won’t stand a chance to stay alive. But you survived from her assassination. And the God Destroying Pearl that Lei Chao threw, theoretically, it could kill you too. But you survived as well,” a young man with ferocious features said with a deep voice.

“But that’s good too. It gave the four of us a chance to attack.”

“Everyone, let us have some fun with the genius today,” the young man with ferocious features suggested.

“No problem.”

“Hehe, I will take good care of him.”

“Don’t kill him too soon, otherwise there’s no fun.”

The few of them smiled savagely.

“Save the bullsh*t. Go ahead and kill him. According to the plan, you fight at close-quarters while I am in charge of surprise attack,” the ugly lady, Mo Ying, said.

“No problem,” the four figures in black robes nodded their heads and then the five figures moved simultaneously.

Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!

There were five figures and every single one was moving supernaturally fast, especially that ugly lady, Mo Ying. She disappeared from Jian Wushuang’s sight entirely.

A war instantly exploded.
