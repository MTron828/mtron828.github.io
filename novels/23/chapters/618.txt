Chapter 619: Battle of the geniuses

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Everyone’s attention was drawn to these two men who had abruptly started to fight.

“You two, what are you doing?”

A cold voice echoed through the area. A figure appeared and hovered between the two Drill Grounds.

The new arrival was a burly middle-aged man who was filled with Killing Intent and emitted a terrifying aura. His appearance drew shock from the warriors, including the white-robed man and the well-groomed man who had been fighting.

This man directed his aura towards them, making it hard for them to catch their breath, as though they were pinned down by a huge mountain.

“My Lord, he started the fight. I have to defend myself, right?” the well-groomed man responded.

The middle-aged man noticed the white-robed man’s belligerent expression and instantly realized what had happened.

“During the Firmament Territory Feast, everyone is banned from fighting, except in certain places. You, since you flouted that rule, you will be disqualified from taking part in the feast. Get out of here!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

As the man’s words faded, an immaterial power assaulted the white-robed man. He did not even have a chance to defend himself and was instantly thrown out of the Drill Ground.

“Ouyang Xuan, I can’t accept it, I can’t!”

Everyone at the Drill Grounds could hear his howls clearly. Eventually, those sounds faded and finally died out.

“Listen, the Firmament Territory Feast is held by numerous Sects in the Firmament Territory. It is a grand feast with strict rules. Just now, I administered the minimum punishment. But from now on, whoever breaks the rules will be killed without mercy!” The middle-aged man’s voice echoed coldly.

The geniuses and warriors in the Skyscraping Realm level were shocked by this threat and naturally did not intend to violate the rules.

The middle-aged man swept his gaze over the gathered crowd and continued, “The feast is held every 3,000 years and is the grandest genius feast in the Firmament Territory. I know all of you come from different places. Some hail from the Eternal World but more of you are from the Ancient World. However, during the feast, everyone is equal. We will only focus on your talent and strength. As long as your talent and strength are good enough, you will have a chance to join the tops Sects here.”

“So the key point is that we will only judge you by your talent and strength.”

Hearing this, the geniuses and warriors clasped their hands together in anticipation.

“There are four rounds in the Firmament Territory Feast. After each round, most of you will have been eliminated. The stronger are, the higher your chances of joining a Sect.”

“The first round of the genius battle will begin in an hour. You should prepare for it now.”

After his announcement, the middle-aged man closed his eyes and ignored the geniuses on the Drill Ground.

The crowd stirred.

“Four rounds of the genius battle! What will they be like?”

Many warriors were curious.

“Although I’m not sure what the genius battle is like, an elder from the Ancient World said that the first round is very important. It’d be good if we could pass that round.?The big Sects might not be interested in us, but we could hope to become outer disciples in some small Sects,” a purple-haired elder said.

“Outer disciples?”

“So, you mean we can only be outer disciples in small Sects if we pass the first round?”

Many in the crowd frowned.

Being an outer disciple just didn’t compare with being an inner disciple, especially if one belonged to a small Sect.

The geniuses and warriors gathered here for the Firmament Territory Feast wanted to join the top Sects. Joining a stronger Sect would mean access to more cultivation resources, and more room to cultivate and improve.

Being only an outer disciple in a small Sect would not satisfy most of the warriors.

“Hum, it’s already an impressive achievement to become an outer disciple in a small Sect. The elder mentioned that most people from the Ancient World did not even manage to join a small Sect. Instead, they wandered in the Firmament Territory when the feast was over. It’s very dangerous here and it’ll be hard to survive if you don’t have the protection of a Sect,” the purple-haired elder said and sneered.

Those who lacked confidence in their strength reacted visibly to this revelation.

They knew that the purple-haired elder was right.

They had just arrived here and were unfamiliar with the Eternal World. They were also not strong enough. Without the protection from a Sect, they would barely survive here.

“Anyway, we need to pass the first round at the very least!”

“I’m not holding out hope for the other rounds, but I have to pass the first one!”

“At a minimum, I’ll have to pass the first round. Then I can try my best to pass as many of the subsequent rounds.”

The warriors from the Ancient World stood with their hands clasped together as they made their resolutions for the?feast.

Soon, one hour passed. The middle-aged man hovering in the Void opened his eyes and waved his hand. A huge wormhole appeared at the Perimeter of each Drill Ground.

“The battlefield of the first round is inside the wormhole,” the man bellowed. “For the first round, we will separate the Ancient World and the Eternal World. So there are two battlefields in two wormholes. One is for the Ancient World and the other is for the Eternal World. These two battlefields won’t have any connection.”

The warriors from the Ancient World camp were relieved on hearing that.

“So in the first round, we are not going to fight with the geniuses from the Eternal World.”

“These geniuses from the Eternal World have more cultivation resources and they should be much stronger than us. Luckily, we are not going to fight them just yet.”

“In this case, I think I stand a good chance to pass the first round.”
