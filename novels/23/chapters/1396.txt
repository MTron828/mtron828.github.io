Chapter 1397: Long Gang Mystery Land

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang cultivated in seclusion for three hundred and ten years.

In the secret room, Jian Wushuang’s eyes shot open and there was a flash of crimson light that erupted.

The crimson light was red like a scarlet star and extremely eye-catching.

Back when Bei Xiu had performed the trick, his eyes had turned into the scarlet sun as well. However, the color wasn’t as significant as Jian Wushuang’s.

“After three hundred and ten years in seclusion, I’m finally at the Initial Success stage for Eighteen Asura Hell,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The Initial Success stage for Eighteen Asura Hell meant that Jian Wushuang could get through the first six levels of dreamland.

Three hundred and ten years to master the first six levels.

One must know that Bei Xiu took almost three thousand years to just master the first three levels.

“Eighteen Asura Hell, eighteen levels of dreamland. The higher the level, the more difficult it was to master. Although I have mastered the first six levels, it will still take more than a hundred years for me to understand the seventh level. However, it is less than a hundred years until the battle.”

Jian Wushuang smiled but didn’t intend to continue to cultivate in seclusion.

After all, merely the first six levels were already terrifying enough.

“Jian Wushuang, the secret skill that you obtained, although it was only a consciousness attack and not a Soul Attack, it is still powerful and it increases your fighting power tremendously. If you were to perform this trick during the fight, one whose consciousness strength hasn’t reach the level of a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven could barely resist it,” King of Venomous Worms said.

“That should be right. However, even if one can withstand it, if they can’t shake off the phantasmagoria, the ending will be the same,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The scary thing about dreamland was that not only would one drown in phantasmagoria, but also when one tried was busy trying to shake off the phantasmagoria, Jian Wushuang, could still take action and kill the person. Hence, not only did the person have to resist dreamland, but he also had to shake off the phantasmagoria quickly in order to dodge Jian Wushuang’s sword attack.

“With this technique, you can fight calmly in the upcoming battle. You also have the confidence to maintain your identity as a disciple of Star Palace,” King of Venomous Worms laughed.

“I’m confident, not definite,” Jian Wushuang shook his head.

Eternal Chaotic World was very different from Tian Ling land.

In Tian Ling land, he could kill a three-starred Soul Master who was comparable to a Peak level three Divine General. However, in Eternal Chaotic World, he could merely match evenly with an advanced Universe God in the Third Heaven with consciousness attacks. It was hard to say if he could match evenly with a Peak Universe God in the Third Heaven. His Soul strength was merely at the level of an advanced Universe God in the Third Heaven after all.

“Jian Wushuang, what do you plan to do next?” King of Venomous Worms asked.

“There’s less than a hundred years time. I will still figure out ways to improve my power during this period,” Jian Wushuang clenched his fist, “The mystery lands under Lineage of Star’s control, I only went to the least dangerous Tian Ling Mystery Land. There are three other mystery lands that I have yet to visit!”

“There will be many opportunities in the three mystery lands and the training effect will be more significant. With the remaining time, I’ll select one of the mystery lands.”

Jian Wushuang made his decision and immediately went to see Hall Master Yuan.

When Hall Master Yuan found out that Jian Wushuang wanted to depart to another mystery land, he wasn’t shocked and he assigned another Star Palace disciple task for Jian Wushuang, just like the last time.

Very soon, Jian Wushuang left for the mystery land.

One of the four mystery lands that Lineage of Star controlled, Long Gang Mystery Land!

Long Gang Mystery Land’s danger level was in the second place among the four mystery lands.

There were massacres all over.

There were countless cultivators and ferocious beasts.

The cultivators and ferocious beasts were born enemies!

The two tribes had extremely unique ways of improving their power!

Human cultivators improved their power by taking in the ferocious beasts’ Soul Nuclei.

While the ferocious beasts consume human lives to increase their level.

Under such prerequisites, it was only right and proper that the two tribes killed one another.

After Jian Wushuang had arrived at Long Gong Mystery Land, he soon became one of the members of the group of human adventurers. He followed a hunting troop and barged into the ferocious beasts’ land. Then, they started their hunting trip.

Of course, Jian Wushuang hunted ferocious beasts only for training and to complete his Star Palace disciple task while the others in the troop were aiming for the ferocious beasts’ Soul nuclei for improving their powers.

The mad massacre was ongoing.

Jian Wushuang worked hard to improved his swordsmanship with the training. As for his Soul Power… After he had arrived in Long Gang Mystery Land, unless he was in a life-threatening situation, he wouldn’t use his Soul Attack. He didn’t even practice the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack.

He let his Soul Power maintain itself in a totally relaxed state.

Yes, he wanted his Soul Power to be in a relaxed state.

He didn’t cultivate to improve it or perform any attack with Soul Power. He did not stimulate his Soul Power in any way.

Ninety years passed in such relaxed state.

After ninety years, on a remote mountain, Jian Wushuang sat alone.

“It’s about time. I should leave.”

That day, Jian Wushuang had decided to leave Long Gang Mystery Land and returned to Lineage of Star.

After he had returned to Lineage of Star and passed down the task that Hall Master Yuan assigned to him, he came to Star Tower.

“I was in Long Gang Mystery Land for ninety years. My swordsmanship and close combat skills improved tremendously. I wonder how far am I from the second floor of Star Tower,” Jian Wushuang stepped foot into Star Tower excitedly.

On the second floor of Star Tower, Jian Wushuang was fighting against the cold-looking middle-aged man again. Just like the first floor, the cold-looking middle-aged man held his sword and performed an advanced rank three unique skill. However, the same advanced rank three unique skill but the power was a few folds stronger than the first floor. His combat technique and experience was far beyond the first floor too.

When Jian Wushuang passed through the first floor back then, he had pulled a lot of tricks. But then, he had become more powerful and came to challenge the second floor again. He fought with the cold-looking middle-aged man for a longer time frame but, in the end, with a flick of the wrist, the cold-looking middle-aged man moved the shapeless universe and the sword light hit Jian Wushuang’s chest.

Jian Wushuang was defeated again.

Jian Wushuang wasn’t surprised by the result.

“Star Tower, every floor is a huge step forward. I barely passed through the first level back then. Although my swordsmanship and killing technique improved, I was far from passing through the second floor. I would still need time to cultivate,” Jian Wushuang thought, but he wasn’t demotivated.

After all, he had improved significantly compared to when he had first come to Lineage of Star.

Then, Jian Wushuang came to the Illusionary Mind Sea.
