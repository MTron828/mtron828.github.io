Chapter 818: Get Lost!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Gold-armored Ancient God stood on the arena, oozing a terrifying aura that left the whole Blood Battle Arena in an uproar.

Jian Wushuang’s battle strength reached its zenith at this moment.

In the audience, countless eyes were looking with shock at the Gold-armored Ancient God that Jian Wushuang had become.

“What, what’s that?”

“What an overwhelming aura! Is he human?”

“Can this man really challenge Xia Yan?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

With numerous horrified eyes upon him, Jian Wushuang took a step forward and pointed the Emperor Sword at Xia Yan.

“Come on. Release all your strength or you’ll have no chance.”

Jian Wushuang threw what Xia Yan had said back at him.

Xia Yan’s face clouded in an instant. “You’re just depending on cheap tricks. You’ll still die today.”

Though he spoke haughtily, there was no longer any contempt for Jian Wushuang in his heart.

He also felt Jian Wushuang’s overwhelming aura at the moment, so he realized that he might be as powerful as he was.

Then, he flipped his hand over, storing the dark, chilly saber and replacing it with a purple saber.

The purple saber was covered with mysterious and complicated lines while the saber itself radiated a fierce aura.

“It’s an Emperor Weapon!”

The eyes of those experts on the edge of the arena shrank sharply.

There were some Dao Masters amongst those experts and it was easy for them to recognize that the purple saber was a genuine Emperor Weapon.

An Emperor Weapon was superior to an Eternal Weapon.

Generally speaking, only Dao Masters could give display the full power of an Emperor Weapon. Of course, some exceptionally horrifying experts in the Eternal Realm could do it as well.

Even Dao Masters highly valued Emperor Weapons.

In the Eternal World, a very small number of the highest, unparalleled experts in the Eternal Realm possessed Emperor Weapons.

Xia Yan was just a Divine Realm expert, but he had terrifying battle strength and a high status in the Xia Clan, so it was only natural that he possessed an Emperor Weapon.

“The second master of the Xia Clan even took out his Emperor Weapon. He seems to have sensed the pressure from his opponent,” the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion Master said, smiling.

“Damn it, Xia Yan actually has an Emperor Weapon,” Lin Wan muttered. She now wore an anxious look as she began to pray in her heart.

On the arena, both Jian Wushuang and Xia Yan had released their auras now.

When their violent auras reached their acme, they both began to move.

Whoosh! Whoosh!

At that moment, Jian Wushuang took a step forward and crossed the distance between Xia Yan and him. Then, he lifted the Emperor Sword high as the mighty power flowed through his arms.

Xia Yan also moved forward and appeared in front of Jian Wushuang. He held his saber and a sharp light flashed in his eyes.

“I’m acknowledged as the number one Divine Realm expert in the Eternal World, I have the Emperor Weapon, and I have many incredible Secret Skills that have been given to me by my clan. I don’t believe a nobody can be my match,”?Xia Yan roared in his mind.

In the next moment, he slashed out with his purple saber.

“Secret Skill, Heavenly Saber!”

Bang!

A huge saber shadow appeared in the upper void and then pressed forward.

As it passed, the air was pushed aside and the whole area seemed to be split in two.

Xia Yan now had an awful look on his face. He had done his best and the Secret Skill he performed was the strongest one he had mastered. Also, because of the Emperor Weapon, the power of that Secret Skill had greatly increased.

He was confident that this horrifying blow could stand up against an expert at Step Five of the Eternal Realm.

He used the same move to win his most glorious fight.

In front of countless people, he, a Divine Realm expert, defeated an expert at the peak of Step Four of the Eternal Realm, making a name for himself in the Eternal World.

As Xia Yanslashed out with his saber, the Emperor Sword, which had been raised high and was ready to strike, had reached the peak of its power.

Jian Wushuang threw Xia Yan a cold glance while a mocking smile dwelled on his mouth. Then, he chopped down with his Emperor Sword.

“The first move of the Boundless Heaven Sword Art, Annihilation Sword Move!”

Instead of the second move or the third move, which was more powerful, he performed the first move of the Boundless Heaven Sword Art.

But he still pushed his power to its limits.

The power of his Level Three Sword Heart, Level 12 Star-river Secret Skill, and the overwhelming power of the Gold-armored Ancient God were fully manifested in this strike.

Rumble…

The overwhelming strike immediately landed on the huge saber shadow that Xia Yan had displayed.

With this, two waves of terrifying power exploded at the same time.

It was like two stars colliding head-on.

With a loud bang, the sword shadow and blade light crisscrossed fiercely. The huge arena that was under their feet suddenly sank, causing countless pieces of rubble to fly up and shoot out in all directions.

A single attack had wiped out the large arena within a radius of a few miles.

In the audience, countless people were shocked at what they were watching.

They had also seen the two figures fighting in the middle and the collision of their power in the center of the battlefield.

It was a collision of pure force.

However, the gap in their strength was obvious.

“How, how could this be?”

Xia Yan’s eyes widened. He looked at his numb right hand in disbelief. He was barely able to hold onto the purple saber and a terrifying force was striking along his arm.

“Puff!”

He spat out a mouthful of blood.

In the eyes of the audience, he spouted blood after the first collision.

Then, he saw Jian Wushuang swing his sword again and another overwhelming blow rushed towards him.

He quickly raised his saber to resist.

Clang!

It was another collision. But this time, Xia Yan’s right hand could no longer hold his Emperor Weapon, so it flew out.

At the same time, that strike had forced him to stagger backwards for quite a distance.

Then, Jian Wushuang flashed to his side and glanced coldly at him.

“Get lost!”

A frigid roar filled the Blood Battle Arena.

As the roar reverberated throughout the area, Jian Wushuang struck out with his sword again. The sword landed on Xia Yan and caused him to shoot out like a cannonball and violent crash into the ground.
