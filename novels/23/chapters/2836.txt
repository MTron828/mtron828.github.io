Chapter 2837: Requesting to See Lord Mo

——

“Is this the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City?” Jian Wushuang looked around with a faint smile on his face.

Whoosh!

He turned into a stream of light and rushed forward.

The red-armored soldiers guarding the space passage did not stop him.

Because he had been guided by Yin Su’er, Jian Wushuang soon found the place where Lord Mo lived after he came to the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City.

It was a huge group of volcanoes.

The whole group of volcanoes was surrounded by endless flames all year round. The air was extremely hot, and the ground and the sky were red.

However, in the center of this group of volcanoes, there was a huge castle. This huge castle was where the number one refiner of the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow lived.

This huge scarlet castle was completely covered by a magic array. And around the magic array, there were many cultivators waiting there.

Those cultivators were not very strong. There were Earth Divine Masters and Sky Divine Masters, as well as Great Divine Masters, but there were very few of them.

They stood in an orderly manner, waiting to enter the castle.

“So many people?” Jian Wushuang appeared in the void outside the castle. Looking at the long dragon at the entrance, his expression could not help but change.

At this time... whoosh!

A figure suddenly appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

The person who came was wearing the same armor and had a cold expression. He was the guard of the giant castle.

However, even though he was just a guard, his aura had reached the level of a junior Great Divine Master.

“A Great Divine Master is actually a guard here?” Jian Wushuang was secretly surprised.

“May I know who you are? What brings you to our fire cloud castle?” The guard asked.

Although it was just a question, his tone was a little arrogant.

This was normal. Fire Cloud Castle was personally founded by Lord Mo. Not only in the Dragon-phoenix Sacred City but also in the entire Golden Crow Nine Realms, it had a very high status. Usually, there were many Great Divine Masters who came to see it, there were even many Immortal Saints.

This guard had seen too many of them.

When he faced the Immortal Saints, he was in awe. When he faced the Invincible Divine Masters and Peak Divine Masters, he was very humble and polite. However, when he faced Jian Wushuang, he saw that Jian Wushuang only had the aura of an Advanced Great Divine Master, his attitude became colder.

“I’m here to see Lord Mo,” Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“As expected.” The guard was not surprised at all. He glanced at Jian Wushuang and asked, “What’s your name, and which realm are you from?”

“Sword One, from the Pill Sun Sacred World,” Jian Wushuang replied.

“Sword One?” The guard shook his head. Obviously, he had never heard of him, but he still said, “Wait here for a moment, I’ll go and inform you.”

“Thank you.” Jian Wushuang thanked him slightly.

The guard immediately went into the castle to report.

In the depths of the giant castle, in a magnificent palace, a middle-aged man in a purple robe sat upright with a smile, holding a cup of tea in his hand.

“Sir.” The guard came to the front of the middle-aged man and said respectfully, “A man called Sword One came from outside and asked to see the Castle Lord.”

“Sword One?” The purple-robed middle-aged man raised his eyebrows and tried to recall the name in his mind, but he had never heard of him.

This was normal. Jian Wushuang’s rise was too short. He had reached such an achievement in just a few decades.

He was only very famous in the Pill Sun Sacred World and the Heavenly Void World, but he was not very famous in the entire Golden Crow Nine Realms. Therefore, not many people had heard of him.

“What realm is this person at?” The purple-robed middle-aged man asked.

“He’s an Advanced Great Divine Master.” The guard replied.

“Hehe, he’s just a mere Advanced Great Divine Master. I’ve never even heard of him before. Clearly, he doesn’t have any great background. He actually wants to seek an audience with the master. How Ridiculous.” The purple-robed middle-aged man sneered. Then, he waved his hand. “The visitor is a guest. Let junior brother Fan Xin receive him.”

“Yes.” The guard immediately left.

The purple-robed middle-aged man still had a smile on his face, but his eyes were looking at a young man who was wearing luxurious woolen clothes. His face was cold and stern, and he had a dignified bearing. “I’m sorry, Young Master Qu, you must have made a fool out of me.”

“Haha, not at all. Fire Cloud Castle is the residence of the number one refiner master in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. There are naturally many people who come to visit. Qu Yun should have an eye-opening experience today.” The young man also had a smile on his face, he even gave a few simple compliments.

“Young Master Qu, I already know the purpose of your visit. Moreover, the reward you offered is indeed very high. This shows that you are indeed very sincere. However, the thing you want can only be refined by my master personally. However, you should have heard of my master’s temper.”

The purple-robed middle-aged man glanced at the young man, he smiled. “If you want the old man to personally refine it, not only do you need to pay a sufficient price, you also need to look at his mood. If he is in a good mood, he might agree to help you refine it. But if he is in a bad mood, no matter how much you pay him, I’m afraid he won’t help you.”

“I know this. Hence, mister, please help me put in a few good words in front of Lord Mo. after all, Qu Yun will remember it in his heart.” The young man said.

“Haha, that’s easy to say. Although it’s the first time I’ve met you, I’ve known Realm Lord Jiu Qu for many years. Naturally, I know what to do,” the purple-robed middle-aged man said with a smile.

“Thank you, sir,” the young man said with a smile. He was in a great mood.

Outside the castle.

“Sword One.” The guard appeared in front of Jian Wushuang again. “I’ve reported your request and Lord Fan Xin has agreed to meet you. Come with me.”

“Lord Fan Xin, who is that?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“He is one of the six in-name disciples of our Fort Master. He has a very high position in Fire Cloud Castle,” the guard said.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help being stunned.

He knew that it would not be easy to meet Lord Mo, but he did not expect that he would be so unpopular.

Back then, Yin Su’er had come here to seek an audience for the sake of selling the blood-desolate emperor crystals. Although she had not met Lord Mo, she had at least met Lord Mo’s personal disciple. Furthermore, she had the personal disciple’s transmission token.

However, the person who had come to greet him was only an in-name disciple.

The difference between an in-name disciple and a personal disciple was not small.

It was very obvious that the person who had come to receive him in Fire Cloud Castle was someone who looked at his status and status. When he saw that he was only a high-level Great Divine Lord and that he was not famous, he had casually sent an in-name disciple to receive him.
