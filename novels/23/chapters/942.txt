Chapter 943: Immortal Army

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Boom!”

A wormhole appeared in the middle of the battlefield and out walked many black-robed people.

One hundred of such men gathered behind Xia Tao. Each of them emanated a powerful aura and a fierce Killing Intent.

They were all Dao Masters!

Every single one of them was a Dao Master!

“T-This…”

Everyone on the battlefield was shocked. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

There was one hundred Dao Masters in the Xia Clan!

“No. These people resemble Dao Masters but their aura is a bit strange,” Lord of Cercis Island muttered.

The others noticed it as well.

These people emanated a strange aura that typically came from a dying warrior. However, the life of an expert in the Eternal Realm of the Eternal World was eternal.

Unless killed, a Dao Master could live forever. However, the aura of these people was strong and deadly. Something wasn’t right.

“This is the Xia Clan’s Immortal Army? There are as many as one hundred people?” Emperor Leng looked at the group of men in shock.

She knew there was an Immortal Army in the clan and she was also familiar with their origins.

In the past, the clan obtained an incomparably cruel Secret Skill by chance. The Secret Skill allowed an expert at the top of Eternal Realm to open up a Dao in a short time and become a Dao Master. However, the cost was steep.

They would be stagnant at Rank One after becoming Dao Masters through the skill. It was the most common and even the weakest type of Dao Masters. Their life expectancy would also be greatly limited.

Those who cultivated this Secret Skill could live for only 100,000 years. There was no cure for their limited lifespan.

The Xia Clan had been cultivating the Immortal Army ever since they discovered the skill. When a member of the army died, there would be a replacement immediately. After so many years, they had paid an unimaginable price to maintain the existence of their army. There had been countless people in the top level of the Eternal Realm alone who had sacrificed their lives for this.

“The Immortal Army is finally coming to play after we spend so many years building the army at a great cost.”?Xia Tao sneered. Then, a majestic and sturdy elderly man walked out the group of one hundred black-robed figures and stood next to him.

“Is that Xia Ming?”

“Xia Ming, the previous Master of the Xia Clan?”

“Didn’t the old dog die a million years ago? How can he be alive now?”

Exclamations rose in the crowd when the elderly man appeared.

The previous Master of the Xia Clan had been even more powerful than Xia Tao, perhaps even stronger than Emperor Xiao and Emperor Leng. How could he still be alive?

“The Xia Clan indeed had its resources.” Emperor Leng smirked.

The Xia Clan’s trump card would have horrified her were she not in the same camp as them. Instead, it simply overjoyed her to have such formidable reinforcements.

“Let’s get started.” Xia Tao looked at the strong old man next to him.

Xia Ming gave a small nod before waving his hand. “March on, the Immortal Army!”

“Boom!”

The one hundred Dao Masters from the Immortal Army charged into the battlefield.

“Oh no!”

“We’re in trouble!”

Emperor Xiao, Emperor Yun, and the experts on the other camp were all shocked.

Their side had the upper hand before the Immortal Army came into the battle. Now, their opponents were much stronger and victory looked likely for them.

“Hurry up and think of a way to block them!”

“These Dao Masters are just the most common and weakest of their ranks. Be careful and you’ll still get a chance to kill them!”

Emperor Xiao continued to bellow in encouragement.

No matter how he called out, it was a fact that their camp was greatly outnumbered now that the one hundred Dao Masters of the Immortal Army had come into play. Emperor Xiao’s camp was almost instantaneously crushed, with his Dao Masters falling one after another.

One of the 10 War Gods was already dead before the Immortal Army showed up, and now three more were killed. Even Di Jing had sustained severe injuries.

“Emperor Xiao, we can’t hold on anymore!” Beiming Hao, Master of the Beiming Clan, shouted.

Emperor Xiao’s face darkened.

“Do we have to run away like the last time?”?He clasped his hands, his heart twisting with agony.

“I don’t want it!”

He didn’t want to run away!

On the other side…

“Jian Wushuang…” Leng Rushuang paid no mind to the changes in the battlefield. She immediately ran to the sinkhole below after Gu Tong, the Seven-star Imperial God, appeared and stopped the soothsayer.

She looked anxious. After all, she had seen with her own eyes how the soothsayer pierced through Jian Wushuang’s chest with his sword.

She finally found Jian Wushuang at the bottom of the sinkhole.

He lied quietly on the ground, the bowl-sized cavity on his chest healing at an alarming rate. By the time she reached her, his wound had mostly healed. Jian Wushuang smiled at her and said, “Don’t worry. I’m fine.”

She heaved a sigh of relief when she saw that he was still alive.

She didn’t know that Jian Wushuang had made a breakthrough and reached the third step in defiance of the natural order. Even if he wanted to die, the new realm would keep him alive forever. The soothsayer had pierced through his chest and shattered his heart but the injuries would not kill him. Moreover, he had Gu King, the Plenilune Centipede, in his body. Gu King had a powerful healing ability that rapidly mended his injuries.

He was now almost fully recovered.

“The situation is very bad. Go and help Emperor Xiao. You don’t have to worry about me, I’ll recover in no time,” Jian Wushuang said solemnly.

Leng Rushuang looked at his nearly healed chest and made up her mind. She immediately left for the battlefield.

He lied in the sinkhole, while his consciousness communicated with Gu King.

“Gu King, I remember you once said that in time of crisis, I can forcefully absorb King Luo Zhen’s Blood Essence for a chance to live,” Jian Wushuang said.

“What do you want to do?” Gu King became obviously tense.

“You tell me.” Jian Wushuang smiled.
