Chapter 1170 Helpless Ape Holy Master

The news that Jian Wushuang was still alive was a top secret, only five Palace Masters knew it.

Now, Dao Master Blood Tusk and Ape Holy Master knew it.

One could imagine what would happen next.

Deep in a stretch of mountains, there was a huge blood red castle.

This blood-colored castle was where Dao Master Blood Tusk lived. In the deepest part of the castle, Dao Master Blood Tusk was leaning on the bed.

“Get out, all of you!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Dao Master Blood Tusk’s growl rang throughout the castle, the maids who were serving and the beautiful dancers in front of him all withdrew.

Dao Master Blood Tusk rose up and looked terrible.

“Idiot! I shouldn’t have accepted him as my disciples. He used to be careless. Being hunted down by his enemies, he fled to the Ancient World. I managed to get rid of the enemy for him. He’ll only need some time to recover and then return to Green Fire World. I did not expect this idiot actually went to mess with Jian Wushuang!”

“How could he mess with Jian Wushuang? Not even Ape Holy Master dares to confront him. Jian Wushuang can kill me so easily. Being in the Eternal Realm, why did him mess with Jian Wushang?”

“Idiot, really stupid!”

Dao Master Blood Tusk madly cursed.

Although Kong Ming was dead, Dao Master Blood Tusk still wanted to resurrect him, in order to kill him with cruel means.

It was really a formidable person that he had offended this time.

After a long time, Dao Master Blood Tusk gradually calmed down.

“Fortunately, Jian Wushuang was nice. I bowed and apodized, he just let me off, otherwise…” Dao Master Blood Tusk could not help feeling fearful.

If Jian Wushuang really wanted him dead, then he would stand no place of surviving in Green Fire World.

“Anyway, I’m still alive.” Dao Master Blood Tusk let out a sigh of relief.

But at this time…

“What?” Dao Master Blood Tusk sensed something. He noticed that two auras had entered his castle, and in a moment they appeared in front of him.

They were a man and a woman, and their auras were very energetic, which both reached the Rank Three Dao Master Level.

“Master Yan and Master Ku, what brings you two here?” Dao Master Blood Tusk immediately got up and greeted.

Among the Eighteen masters of Void Temple, he could not afford to offend any of them. Naturally, he greeted respectfully.

“Dao Master Blood Tusk, we’re here under Temple Master’s orders to kill you.” Master Ku said directly.

“What?” Dao Master Blood Tusk was greatly shocked and exclaimed. “To kill me? How is this possible? I have never offended the Void Temple, how will the Void Temple Master order to kill me? Have you mistaken?”

“Temple Master issued the order himself. We couldn’t have made a mistake. Now, prepare to die.” Master Ku’s voice was cold, and the next moment he struck directly.

“No, it’s impossible, how can he want me dead for no reason?” Dao Master Blood Tusk resisted as he screamed wildly. “I’ll report it to Ape Holy Master. Ape Holy Master will help me!”

“Ape Holy Master?” Master Ku laughed. “He can hardly protect himself now. How can he manage to help you?”

Master Ku and Master Yan had prepared for a long time. Before they started, they laid a Restriction around the castle, so that Dao Master Blood Tusk had no way to escape. Even the message could not be transmitted again. Only for a moment, Dao Master Blood Tusk was killed.

On the other side, in the distant North Sea Kingdom.

Ape Holy Master was alone in the secret room cultivating a Secret Skill.

Suddenly… A figure came, and at the same time, an immaterial power had covered the entire secret room to stop any message from going out.

“Vo—Void Temple Master?”

Ape Holy Master looked at the person who appeared in front of him in surprise.

The supreme Void Temple Master on Void Continent, one of Green Fire Palace Masters actually appeared in front of him in the flesh?

“Void Temple Master.” Ape Holy Master immediately respectfully saluted. “What brings you here?”

“Ape Holy Master, is Dao Master Blood Tusk your proteges?” Void Temple Master sounded indifferent.

“Yes, he is.” Ape Holy Master nodded subconsciously.

“Not long ago, did this Dao Master Blood Tusk send a message to you?” Void Temple Master asked again.

“Yes, he did.” Ape Holy Master nodded again. “He told me that in the Ancient World, he saw Jian Wushuang.”

“That’s right.” Void Temple Master’s eyes became cold.

“Temple Master, what’s wrong?” Ape Holy Master was in doubt.

“This secret room is already protected. I might as well tell you that he’s already capable to be a Green Fire Palace Master. And he has a great potential. He will definitely become the Green Fire Palace leader.” Void Temple Master commented.

“Become a leader? Jian Wushuang?” Ape Holy Master widened his eyes.

Being a Holy Master and a member of the Green Fire Palace, though he did not live in the Green Fire Palace and was not kept posted, he knew that the leaders of Green Fire Palace were all formidable.

He had met with Jian Wushuang and even bore hostility toward him, but the hostility only came from the battle between North Sea Kingdom and Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land. It was nothing personal.

He also acknowledged Jian Wushuang’s talent. When the three big countries joined forces to attack Kingdom Tang of the Eastern Land, Jian Wushuang came to their rescue. But he never expected that Jian Wushuang had grown so much in such a short time.

“He was talented, thus the Jin Kingdom has tried to assassinate him at all costs, and in that assassination, he was dead.” said Void Temple Master.

“Dead? But…” Ape Holy Master froze and looked up at Void Temple Master.

He had guessed why Void Temple Master came to him in person.

“I think you should already understand.” Void Temple Master looked down. “His survival is a top secret. Even in Green Fire Palace, only Palace Masters know about it. But now, you learn the secret…”

“I, I…” Ape Holy Master was feeling helpless.

He never wanted to learn it, though.

It was Dao Master Blood Tusk that told him the secret.

“Dao Master Blood Tusk has been killed. Well, you’re one of our Green Fire Palace and a valuable soldier. I won’t kill you, but it can’t let you stay on Void Continent anymore, so… Until Jian Wushuang becomes the leader of the Green Fire Palace to deal with the Jin Kingdom, you have to stay in my Oblivion Palace.”
