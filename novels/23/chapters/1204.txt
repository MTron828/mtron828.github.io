“If each God-soul Elixir can foster a Holy Master, our Green Fire World will definitely have more than a thousand Holy Masters!” Samsara Temple Master exclaimed and clenched his fists in excitement.

“Besides, we also have the Nirvana Elixirs.

“A Nirvana Elixir pill can foster a Universe Master. During in the previous battle, we were only able to acquire four such elixir pills, which was not enough for us. Fortunately, now that we have several dozen Nirvana Elixir pills, every Holy Master at Exceptional Realm in our Green Fire World can have one. We can then give the remaining pills to other high level experts with great potential, in doing so, we’ll probably have ten more Universe Masters in our Green Fire World in the near future!”

The Samsara Temple Master’s words thrilled everyone present.

More than a thousand Holy Masters and ten more Universe Masters!

If Green Fire World has this kind of battle strength, they might have 20% or even 30% of winning, compared to just 10% before.

A 30% chance of winning is much more optimistic.

“Void and Tang Emperor, I will leave the distribution of these pills up to your discretion.” The Samsara Temple Master said.

“No problem,” the Void Temple Master and the Tang Emperor nodded their heads.

“Sunrise and Red Lotus, you will be responsible for teaching the formations, and making sure that each expert in our Green Fire World has mastered the military tactics for when the war comes.” The Samsara Temple Master said again.

“With pleasure,” the Sunrise Sword Emperor and Red Lotus said with confidence.

Their job was simply to teach the tactical formations. The ones would be fighting in the war would be Dao Masters and experts at the highest levels. As Dao Masters, it would not be difficult for them to master tactical formations.

“As for you, Jian Wushuang… 20 years have passed already, and we only have 80 left. During the remaining time, you just need to focus on increasing your strength. If you need treasures, you can go to Fire Point Exchange Office directly. If what you need isn’t there, tell me and I’ll collect it for you.” the Samsara Temple Master looked at Jian Wushuang seriously.

“You’re the strongest expert in the Green Fire World now. No one within the Green Fire World can compete with your strength. In the coming war, your strength will play a great role in the future of the Green Fire World. Therefore, the only ting you need to do now is focus on increasing your power.”

“I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded his head slightly. After a moment’s thought, he continued, “I already have enough treasures to improve my battle strength. What I really need now is some Ancient God Power, as much as possible.”

“Ancient God Power?” the Samsara Temple Master lifted his eyebrows, saying with a smile on his face, “There’s some remaining Ancient God Power in my Green Fire Palace. How much do you need?”

“Not too much, maybe around 2,000 drops.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Haha, I can give you 3,000 drops. You as much as you would like.” Samsara Temple Master said.

Jian Wushuang nodded.

Ancient God Power would indeed play an important role in his plans.

After all, he was an Ancient God himself, a four-star Ancient God of Imperial Kinsmen.

Ancient God Power contained the pure strength of an Ancient God, which Jian Wushuang could absorb completely.

However, he had tried to improve his strength with only a few drops before, which had little effect on his performance.

Now, with even more Ancient God Power, perhaps consuming all of it at once would succeed in increasing his power by a significant amount.

As a four-star Ancient God of Imperial Kinsmen, so he could reach the Four-star Peak Realm shortly after absorbing a large amount of Ancient God Power.

Only after reaching the peak realm of Ancient God, could he try to activate the stage-two power of the Blood-killing Plate Armor, as well as promote his own strength.

The stage-one power had increased his battle strength by 10 times, so he believed that once activated, the stage-two power could improve his strength even more drastically.

Without much delay, the Samsara Temple Master personally delivered the 3,000 drops of Ancient God Power he had promised.

Alone in a secret chamber, Jian Wushuang sat crosslegged with drops of Ancient God Power floating in front of him.

“Let’s begin!”

Jian Wushuang gaze fixed onto a drop of power as he lead it into his body. In less than fifteen minutes, he had absorbed the entire drop.

When the drop had completely melded with his body, Jian Wushuang could feel that his power had increased slightly.

“There’s only 50 years left before the main force of Jin Kingdom is arriving. I must reach the peak realm of four stars during these years!” Jian Wushuang held his hands tightly and fierce gaze fell across his face.

“Keep going!”

Jian Wushuang continued to cultivate alone in this secret chamber as he had been for many years.

In the Green Fire Palace, the experts coming from all over the world were preparing for the final war.

All Dao Masters who had were extremely powerful and had a large chance of achieving a breakthrough into Holy Master received a Gold Soul Elixir. With the aid of the elixir, they all ascended to the status of Holy Master.

Only a few of the Holy masters also received Nirvana Elixirs.

At the same time, the Sunrise Sword Emperor and Red Lotus were focusing on training all the experts to master their tactical formations, trying their best to make the experts cooperate in a harmonious way.

Everyone was actively preparing for the coming war.

The 50 years sped by until there was only one year left before the Jin Kingdom’s arrival.

In the secret chamber.

Under the careful control of Jian Wushuang, another drop of Ancient God Power was absorbed into his body.

It was the 1,796th drop.

As its power spread through his body, Jian Wushuang started to tremble slightly. After a while, his body shook violently for a second and a strong aura spread around him.

“Peak realm of four stars!”

Jian Wushuang blinked with astonishment in his eyes.

He had reached the four-star Ancient God 1,500 years before. After consuming 1,796 drops of Ancient God Power, he finally reached the peak realm.

Then, he started to activate the stage two power of Blood-killing Plate Armor.

“Surely, I can also activate the stage two power of my armor.” Jian Wushuang was excited.

When he had become a Dao Master and his Ancient God Power had reached the four-star level, he found that he could not activate the stage two power of Blood-killing Plate Armor. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

But now that he was at the peak realm of four stars could he might have just enough strength to activate it.

Jian Wushuang as he activated the second stage, power surged through him.

“Since the first stage of power increased my strength by 10 times, will this stage increase it by 20 times?”
