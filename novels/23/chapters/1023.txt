Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Bang!

The fierce blow pierced through Di Yan’s protections and direly landed on his body.

The power even drowned Di Yan’s lasts screech and slew him quietly. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Finally, when peace was once more restored, the Void was gradually healing.

“Is he dead?”

The Rock Demon Clan’s masters, including God Hong, all froze there, stunned.

They had witnessed the entire battle.

Jian Wushuang had confronted Dao Master Dreamless and broken through. Now, he actually annihilated the Black Python Clan along with Di Yan with his thunderous strikes. Jian Wushuang really impressed them.

They even failed to collect their thoughts yet.

However, shortly after, among the Rock Demon Clan, thunderous cheering echoed.

“He’s dead!”

“The leader of the Black Python Clan Mo Lin is dead?”

“All the Black Python Clan experts, all of them were killed by Master Wushuang alone?”

The crowd cheered.

Jian Wushuang was not impressed. He stared coldly at the bodies on the ground and murmured to himself. “I’ve just created my Scarlet Yang Sword Principle, and haven’t conjured a matching strong swordsmanship. Otherwise, I could’ve killed Di Yan easily.”

Jian Wushuang was fully aware that he had achieved a brand new level after devising the Scarlet Yang Sword Principle. He was almost a Celestial Master, even could surpass Emperor Xiao or Emperor Yun. Without a matching swordsmanship, he was unable to perform the third Sword Principle to the fullest extent.

“Jian Wushuang.” Dao Master Dreamless’ voice rang.

“I must admit that you’re not only gifted but also brave.” Dao Master Dreamless smiled. “When Di Yan told you about his father, you killed him still, well…”

“Empyrean Patriarch?” Curious, Jian Wushuang had to ask, “Dao Master, who is Empyrean Patriarch?”

“You really don’t know him?” Dao Master Dreamless stared at Jian Wushuang in amazement. At that moment, he thought Jian Wushuang was playing dumb. He did not expect that Jian Wushuang was really unaware of Empyrean Patriarch.

“To be honest, I come from Void Continent and just arrived here recently. I don’t know much about experts on Samsara Continent.” Jian Wushuang admitted.

“That explains. If you’re born here, you would have known him.” Dao Master Dreamless knitted his brows and cast a serious look at Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, you don’t want to mess with Empyrean Patriarch!”

“If I’m not mistaken, he must be a Celestial Master?” said Jian Wushuang.

Di Yan was already a Dao Master at the Peak of Rank Three. If he talked someone before his death, that someone must be stronger than him, more capable than a Celestial Master.

“Right, he’s a Celestial Master, and one of the troublesome kind.” Dao Master Dreamless continued, “Have you seen Di Yan’s bloodline?”

“Yes, he’s from the Sky-devouring Clan.” Jian Wushuang answered.

“You’re right,” Dao Master Dreamless confirmed. “You must know that on Samsara Continent, there are many unique bloodlines of high value. Those bloodlines are rare and highly-leveled.”

“Even in the grand Eternal Chaotic World, Sky-devouring Clan belongs to the rarest and the most valuable bloodlines. On Samsara Continent, there were two men with that bloodline. One is Di Yan, the other is his father, Empyrean Patriarch.”

“Empyrean Patriarch has gained himself a reputation years ago. He even stands out among Celestial Masters. Moreover, he’s wild and listens to no one. In the past, he was already famous for being murderous. In Green Fire World, everyone fears him.”

“Even Samsara Temple… though we’ve got lots of experts, however, except the Temple Master, he cares none of us. Peak populations of Samsara Continent dare not to provoke him.”

“So, you may call him a wild, mad, and troublesome old monster.”

“And you, you killed the monster’s only son. What do you say? Do you think he’ll seek a revenge?”

Hearing out Dao Master Dreamless, Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Before he killed Di Yan, he vaguely guessed that?Empyrean Patriarch was a Celestial Master. However, he did not expect such a notorious and strong Celestial Master.

It was no good to be targeted by such a capable Celestial Master.

“To hell with it, if he wants a revenge on me, he can try.” Jian Wushuang just smiled.

“You’re bold.” Dao Master Dreamless shook his head smilingly.

“Or what? I’ve killed him. There’s nothing I can do.” Jian Wushuang remained calm, he never regretted one single of his decisions.

Since he decided to kill Di Yan, he would pay whatever price that would cost.

So what if Empyrean Patriarch sought his revenge?

He had destroyed Dao Yuanzi, who was much stronger than Empyrean Patriarch. He would not be scared of the latter.

“Dao Master Dreamless, thanks to you, I’ve created my third Sword Principle. If it’s convenient for you, why don’t we stay for a drink? I happen to have something to ask you.” He invited the Dao Master.

“Sure.” Dao Master Dreamless accepted the invitation.

Then, they headed straight to the city of the Rock Demon Clan, where they were warmly-received.

In a grand temple, Jian Wushuang and Dao Master Dreamless sat face-to-face. In between them, there was a table lined with cuisine and fine wines.

They talked during the meal. The Rock Demon Clan experts stayed at the outside.

“Jian Wushuang, to be honest, are you really just in Eternal Realm?”

Dao Master Dreamless looked into Jian Wushuang’s eyes.
