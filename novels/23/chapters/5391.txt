Chapter 5390 - 5390: Void Crawler

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation   Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Luckier individuals might emerge from other places, while those less fortunate would be abruptly severed by spatial fissures. Moreover, within these fissures existed a potent force of devouring, evidently possessing the power of cosmic black holes.

Terrifying!

Horrifying!

“Let’s get out of here first!” Xuanyuan Dapan’s expression changed.

Several Dao Lords had already been swallowed into the void, and if they didn’t leave soon, everyone would be ensnared.

Gutong turned around and flew directly towards Xuanyuan Dapan. Upon seeing him, he anxiously said, “Brother Xuanyuan, someone must stabilize the space here. If we don’t return soon, people from the City of Suppression will come over.’

“Alright, General Gu, it’s up to you. I’ll lead my troops to the source, and you guard the space here!” Xuanyuan Dapan said, then enveloped Xia Mang

Guanyu with divine power and led millions of troops against the current.

Gutong, staying behind, had a change in his eyes. Without saying much, he cast a hand seal, and the space instantly calmed down.

The void crawlers were quite feeble, incapable of obstructing the massive army.

Xuanyuan Dapan also issued orders not to kill these crawlers.

The army covered the sky and moved against the current.

Far in the source of the void, powerful individuals from the Tianqi tribe sensed a massive aura approaching, their gazes flickering.

“Let’s go! They’ve discovered us. According to the instructions of the Grand Elder, hold the border at all costs!” the leader said, turning away.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Many harbored discontent deep within their hearts, questioning why fate chose their Tianqi tribe to stay behind.

Even with this last resort, as a massive army approached, they could hold their ground, but what lay beyond?

City of Suppression.

Inside the central military hall.

Xia Mang Yunzhan frowned deeply.

It had been an hour since Xuanyuan Dapan, along with his men, departed. No sign, no sound. What was to be done?

No matter how strong the Tianqi tribe was, they couldn’t possibly swallow up an army of millions directly. There must be some conspiracy at play.

“Give the order: the Five Army Camps moves out, bypass the barrier, and head straight for the MO Luffs lair. General Zhong Liang of the Left Army, lead the left flank to enter the barrier again.”

Dual strategies.

One, to never abandon those inside the barrier. Two, heading towards the MO Luo’s border stronghold to probe their reality.

The Left General, Zhong Liang, one of the three major generals, felt something amiss this time.

He believed that this expedition was already off. The official explanation within the empire was to reduce the vassals, but on the battlefield, facing the ambitions of the MO Luo nation, they had to fight even if they didn’t reduce the vassals!

Now, the main force of the MO Luo nation had retreated to the Shura Plain, almost reaching their main camp.

Only the strong of the Tianqi tribe were left, causing confusion.

If they continued to be careless, they might face complete annihilation, let alone winning.

There were also significant issues with the overall command.

At this time, hastily deploying troops was already a massive risk.

But on the battlefield, only one person’s words mattered. Even if he voiced objections, in such a critical moment, nothing could be reversed.

The army mobilized again, and the forces in the City of Suppression were reduced by more than half in an instant.

Most of the tier 5 Emperors were among those mobilized.

Xia Mang Yunzhan took out a jade slip, gazing at the ancient characters above, perplexed in his heart, but he could only follow the instructions written there.

In the heart of the MO Luo border.

After the departure of the Grand Elder, the strongest figure here is the chief of the Tianqi tribe, a peak-level power of tier 5, with ten Emperors under his command, all at tier 5.

The elite forces numbered no more than ten million.

Against such a force, a direct confrontation might not even withstand the 3,000 Camps led by Xuanyuan Dapan.

“Chief, Xuanyuan Dapan has led an army of over ten million out of the marsh, and the Five Army Camps of the City of Suppression will arrive shortly!’

The scout respectfully conveyed the information he had gathered.

The chief of Tianqi tribe sat steadily on the high platform, his gaze sharp.

Behind all this was the guidance of the Grand Elder, but at this point, even he couldn’t figure out why the Grand Elder sought to achieve this.

Continuously luring the main forces of Great Xia into the marsh, now half of them had entered, and they were about to face the Tianqi tribe, yet nothing had happened.

If this continued, they would have to fight desperately.

At present, both sides were at a disadvantage in terms of manpower.

Neither side knew what the next step should be!

On the side of Xuanyuan Dapan, they had already reached the origin of the void.

It was a black hole of immense size, with an endless devouring force that was awe-inspiring.

Jian Wushuang couldn’t help but swallow as he watched.

A black hole?

Devouring!

If this black hole were moved to the Origin Source Sea, he could elevate the spatial origin source to the realm of Mahayana, even without merging the

Dao.

The spatial origin source had several levels.

Firstly, it was the condensation of space, something Jian Wushuang had achieved long ago.

The formation of space could be considered the realm of stars.

Later, space condensed countless stars, Jian Wushuang reached the Taiyin realm, considered a small achievement.

Now, Jian Wushuang was in the Taiyin realm, where the sun and moon manifested, and the space was stable. The next level was the Mahayana realm.

The Black Hole realm.

He possessed the power of devouring and had a good understanding of black holes, but entering this realm required a considerable expenditure of energy.

After the Black Hole Realm, there was the Void Universe.

That was the space of the universe.

Once the Void Universe condensed, it would be the pinnacle of space.

It was the Absolute Pinnacle realm. Stars, Taiyin, Black Hole, Universe.

The Four Realms.

Generally, after breaking through to the Emperor-level of cultivation, one could master the origin source of space and reach the Star Realm. In the outside world, a tier 2 Emperor was needed to reach such a level, and in the Earth Realm, a tier 3 Emperor was required.

As for the Taiyin realm, it was controlled when reaching tier 4 of the Emperor.

In the Earth Realm, only many tier 5 Emperors could barely control it.

The Black Hole could only be controlled by tier 5 and 6 Emperors.

As for the Universe realm, it required an Emperor at the pinnacle of tier 6 to control it.

Jian Wushuang, only at the Dao Lord level, could reach the Taiyin realm. Many tier 5 Emperors in the Earth Realm could only reach this level.

Even some peak tier 4 Emperors from the outside world were only at this level.

If he were to devour that black hole, directly achieving the Black Hole realm, he would step into the Mahayana realm.

In the future, merging with the Dao would be even smoother.

The countless fragments in the Sea of Origin Source were like stars, and two massive pieces were converging, forming the Taiyin. All that remained was a black hole.

If left to grow on its own, these fragments would eventually coalesce and digest, creating a black hole.

But that was too slow.

Jian Wushuang revealed a slight smile, unexpectedly hitting the jackpot this time with such an enormous stroke of luck.

He turned to Xuanyuan Dapan, bowing respectfully, “Grandfather, this is the origin source of the void. The crawlers emerged from here. I am willing to guard this place.”

Xuanyuan Dapan glanced at the black hole and nodded. Although he was a peak tier 5, he had not yet mastered the realm of black holes and had limited understanding of it. In his view, Xia Mang Guanyu’s willingness to stay here was likely due to the unpredictable and dangerous forces ahead. Staying put seemed safer.

“Good, Yu’er, select some people to stay here and keep watch!”

Jian Wushuang cast a glance, choosing dozens of tier 3 Emperors, along with some tier 4 Emperors he brought, and the thousands who had gathered to form the Luo Hou Battle Formation.

Those selected breathed a sigh of relief. Going further meant approaching the

MO Luo Nation’s nest at the border, a place much more dangerous than this..
