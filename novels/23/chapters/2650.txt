Chapter 2651: In Disguise

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Jian Wushuang did not deliberately conceal his aura nor did he use the black stone to disguise his divine power breath. One could easily detect his Primary-level Earth Ultimate God realm had anyone decided to check on him. In addition, his appearance was also deliberately disguised. Who would have thought he was the Territorial Lord?

Jian Wushuang stayed in the tavern for a while before leaving after getting more information from the Ultimate Gods that were chatting away around him.

He went directly to the large spatial passage in Longyu City after leaving the tavern.

The spatial passage was on a huge plaza where a large number of cultivators gathered on the plaza and waited in line. Some experts were guardingThere were some experts guarding over the spatial passage near the entrance.

Jian Wushuang initially wanted to use this spatial passage for inter-stellar region transmission, so he could save a lot of traveling time to the Crimson Stone Fort. However, he changed his mind as soon as he arrived at the plaza.

“The security is too tight with experts hiding in the dark.” Jian Wushuang solemnly pondering.

His ability to perceive danger was extremely strong and could vaguely sense two gushes of auras hidden in the void nearby after careful inspection.

They belonged to Heaven Ultimate Gods—a High-level Heaven Ultimate God!

He knew immediately they were experts sent by the Life and Death Tower and Divine Demons Sect.

The Life and Death Tower and Divine Demons Sect probably assumed he would leave the Northern Darkstar Territory and would possibly use spatial passages. Therefore, they had placed some experts on guard around the two major transmission spatial passages that could travel across the Stellar Regions.

Such experts would then very carefully observe everyone who entered the spatial passages.

Jian Wushuang would have attracted attention from the two High-level Heaven Ultimate Gods hidden in the void nearby if he was heedless of the danger and casually entered the spatial passage.

“Even without using the black stone to disguise my aura, my current divine breath is showing a Primary-level Earth Ultimate God’s divine power. Earth Ultimate Gods are scarce in the entire Northern Darkstar Territory, so the two High-level Heaven Ultimate Gods will notice me. They’ll find out that my appearance has been deliberately disguised if they use their soul power to carefully inspect me and my whereabouts will most likely be exposed to them.” Jian Wushuang thought of the possibilities and made a decision.

He immediately turned around and left without looking back.

Two figures were standing side by side in the void around the square. They were the two High-level Earth Ultimate Gods who were in hiding.

“That person over there... He came but turned and left.” A red-robed old man squinted at Jian Wushuang’s back.

The other middle-aged man with purple hair who stood with his hands folded at his back commented, “There’s something wrong with his facial muscles. He must’ve deliberately disguised his appearance, but his aura is very weak at just the Primary-level Earth Ultimate God.”

“A Primary-level Earth Ultimate God?”

The two looked at each other before both shook their heads. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Jian Yi—the person they were looking for could simultaneously contend with three Primary-level Heaven Ultimate Gods whilst his cultivation realm had reached the Peak Earth Ultimate God realm. Though that Primary-level Earth Ultimate God was acting a little weird with his face disguised, he could not possibly be the person they were looking for.

The two people then allowed Jian Wushuang to leave undetected right under their noses.

Jian Wushuang was secretly mumbling and complaining while walking alone on the streets of Longyu City.

“The Longyu City spatial passage was guarded by the Heaven Ultimate Gods experts. It could be the same for other places, hence I can’t rely on the spatial passage and travel to another Stellar Region. Although it might take a much longer time to get to the Crimson Stone Fort, it’s a lower risk.

“Although I’ve been reincarnated in the Ancient God Domain for decades, I haven’t explored this place. It’s time for me to check this place out and get to know it!”

...

In the Northern Darkstar Territory, the bounty of 100,000,000 Primordial Stones was shockingly well sought after as countless cultivators felt tempted by the reward and frantically searched for the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord—Jian Yi. The reward was soon no longer limited to the Northern Darkstar Territory, but the entire Danyang Holy Domain!

All Stellar Regions within the Danyang Holy Domain had announced similar rewards.

The entire Danyang Holy Domain was enlivened.

However, the Northern Darkstar Territorial Lord seemed to have completely disappeared regardless of how many cultivators went all out searching for him with not even the slightest trace of him. Jian Wushuang’s close associates such as Xiao Tiexin had also disappeared.

Jian Wushuang’s parents on the other hand were located far away in the Wusha Wilderness... He had never revealed his true origin and was using his pseudonym—Jian Yi all along. In addition, the Wusha Wilderness was just an unremarkable wilderness that no one paid any attention to, let alone to investigate.

Zhuo Yunfeng and Luo Xinqin were unaffected by the incident.

Time flew.

Ten years had passed in a blink of an eye.

On a wide piece of land on Wushui Territory...

“Brother Su Han, let’s part here. Come visit me at the Chen Mansion if you have time,” yelled a silver-haired young man carrying a longsword.

Opposite him was a grim-looking man in a black robe. He took a sip of wine before smiling faintly. “Young man, practice hard. You have a long way to go in honing your sword skills.”

“I know, Brother Su Han.”

The silver-haired boy soon left with his tribe.

The grim-looking black-robed man called ‘Su Han’ was drinking wine while seated on the ground as his eyes flickered. “Interesting young man.”

‘Su Han’ was actually Jian Wushuang in disguise. He followed a group of businessmen and encountered the silver-haired young man, Chen Xing on the way. The very young Chen Xing liked swords and was a little talented in Sword Principles.

Jian Wushaung noticed Chen Xing would often practice sword techniques along the journey. On one occasion, Jian Wushuang had just casually given Chen Xing a tip which he caught on and made great improvement. In the following two years, Chen Xing was learning sword techniques from Jian Wushuang.

It was a pity that Jian Wushuang could not show much of what he knew to hide his strength. Just a few random pointers from him had benefited the young man who had yet to even reach the Chaotic realm.

“Wushui Territory, Wushu Continent...”

Jian Wushuang slowly stood up and looked over at the continent he was on with a strange smile appearing on his face.

He soon set off and skimmed toward the city right in the middle of the continent and arrived a few days later at a huge and magnificent stone fort constructed entirely of red quicksand.

It was the Star Picking Pavilion!
