Jian Wushuang returned to the cave he was at earlier after getting acquainted with the Thousand Treasures Grand World.

He sat down cross-legged with the Stately Painting no longer in front of him. He had the Transmigration Sword Formation and strange golden stone he got from the auction for a great price instead.

Jian Wushuang first looked at the golden stone.

“What exactly is in this golden stone?”

Jian Wushuang held the golden stone while his soul power penetrated it to have a good look at its insides.

He continued investigating for nearly half an hour before finally withdrawing his soul power.

“I sense Space-time quivering in this golden stone. It’s indeed extraordinary and probably has something within, but...is my strength still too weak at the moment? Or is my Space-time Law understanding too shallow? Why can’t I see anything?” Jian Wushuang murmured.

He shook his head before deciding not to spend more time on the golden stone and turned his gaze to the Transmigration Sword Formation.

The extremely powerful Transmigration Sword Formation was created by the Sword Lord Tong Xin who was invincible among Undying Saints many years ago.

He managed to get his hand on the Transmigration Sword Formation’s first four volumes after spending 40,000,000 Primordial Stones on them, hence he expected to gain something useful from it.

“Let’s take a look first.”

Jian Wushuang unleashed his soul power into the jade slip.

His mind received a vast amount of messages in an instant as a picture concurrently appeared in his mind.

There were four scenes in total with each being a scene of an expert casting a type of sword formation.

Jian Wushuang could see the power of those sword formations very clearly and was surprised.

Jian Wushuang opened his eyes again after a while.

“So this is Sword Lord Tong Xin’s creation. This is what made him invincible those days in the Ancient God Domain. The Transmigration Sword Formation is truly powerful with its first four volumes alone already extremely powerful. However, a more powerful technique also brings an equally elevated difficulty in its execution as it demands a high understanding of the Transmigration Law and Sword Principles,” said Jian Wushuang.

The first four volumes of the Transmigration Sword Formation...

The first sword formation—Heaven’s Edge!

The second sword formation— All Sank!

The third sword formation— Transmigration Drunk!

The fourth sword formation— Frozen World!

The first sword formation, Heaven’s Edge required Merit achievement in the Sword World and the first stage understanding of the Transmigration Law. Jian Wushuang’s current understanding of the Sword Principle and Transmigration was just sufficient to execute that sword formation.

In other words, he could only at best attempt to perform the first sword formation.

The sword formation was proven to be powerful at that.

Jian Wushuang began to carefully study this first sword formation without hesitation.

The Transmigration Sword Formation was extremely profound—requiring a very high level of understanding and talent to apprehend it.

The first sword formation itself was difficult for many cultivators who were good at Sword Principles and Transmigration Law. Many spent hundreds or even thousands of years, but could barely apprehend it.

Even Jian Wushuang had to spend two years in full effort and focus on doing it right to apprehend the very first sword formation.

Jian Wushuang stood alone on the barren ground two years later.

His mind power at work as a stream of light immediately appeared in front of him.

The light stream was a longsword with nine handles with each handle filled with Transmigration Strength.

“Go!”

Jian Wushuang pointed a finger at the nine longswords floating in front of him as they evolved into nine huge Reincarnation Passages. Those nine Reincarnation Passages were like large and mysterious black holes.

Those nine black holes charged at the void upfront under Jian Wushuang’s guidance with extremely great powers such that the void shuddered wherever they passed.

“Nine swords become one, Heaven’s Edge!” Jian Wushuang commanded.

Any one of those black holes could easily annihilate an Earth Ultimate god. At Jian Wushuang’s command, they overlapped in an instant and formed a huge and endless Reincarnation Passage in which a black sword with Transmigration Strength shot out suddenly and violently from the passage end.

The black sword instantly went through the mountain ranges in front like Heaven’s Edge. The black sword disintegrated and turned into the nine black holes once again after passing through several mountains before returning to Jian Wushuang’s side.

Jian Wushuang was shocked when he saw the penetrated mountains before him.

Jian Wushuang exclaimed, “This is indeed powerful as I didn’t even use much strength. I should be able to easily handle any Earth Ultimate Gods including Peak Earth Ultimate Gods! Besides, I’ve only used nine ordinary swords in the sword formation with some low-level Earthly Treasures. They aren’t even powerful divine weapons and nowhere fit to perform Transmigration Law techniques.

“The power of this sword formation will skyrocket if I can get nine identical swords that can make full use of Transmigration Law.”

Jian Wushuang held his hands together.

He did not have divine weapons suitable for Transmigration techniques but believed the Star Picking Pavilion should have them.

Jian Wushuang immediately left and headed directly to the Star Picking Pavilion.

Although he had fled after retrieving the Stately Painting, he remained in the Narcissus Territory and was not too far from Star Picking Pavilion. He would at most need to travel several days before arriving at the Star Picking Pavilion.

Jian Wushuang arrived at the Star Picking Pavilion again a few days later.

In a separate room within Star Picking Pavilion...

“Oh, so Nanwu Palace took the Huangji Golden Pill?”

Jian Wushuang sat on a stool while sipping tea and smiling faintly at the Star Picking Pavilion’s Black Chief.

He appeared halfway through the battle for the Huangji Golden Pill and caused a scene, but the battle continued as soon as he left and he expected the result to be finalized on that day.

“Although Nanwu Palace ended up having the Huangji Golden Pill, they paid a large price for it. Half of their Heaven Ultimate Gods—about six—were sacrificed and one of their two Grand Ultimate Gods seriously injured,” said the Black Chief.

“Did you say six Heaven Ultimate God were sacrificed?” Jian Wushuang secretly smacked his tongue before asking, “What about the Young Palace Master? What happened to him?”

The Black Chief continued, “He’s alright. Although his strength isn’t that great with his just average abilities, he’s after all the Nanwu Palace’s Young Palace Master—the son of Nanwu Palace Master. The other top three powers dare not kill him. Otherwise, the Nanwu Palace Master will go crazy and break into a war against the three other factions. This isn’t something the top factions want to see.”
