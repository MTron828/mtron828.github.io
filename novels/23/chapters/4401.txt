4403 The Return

On top of a towering mountain, Supreme Yan Shan’s human face couldn’t help but reveal a moved expression when he saw this scene.

A warm current was flowing in his body.

As the saying goes, when a tree falls, monkeys scatter, and when a great disaster strikes, they fly away on their own. How fortunate was the Divine Life Palace to have such a group of disciples who were willing to live and die together?

The Divine Life Palace might not be the most powerful force in the universe, but it was far from comparable to other top forces!

!!

Taking in a deep breath, Supreme Yan Shan’s expression darkened as he berated, “Don’t mess around! The Ruler Blood Wave and the others are using their lives to buy time for you. If you don’t leave, won’t their sacrifices be in vain?”

As his voice fell, Supreme Yan Shan’s tone became slightly gentler as he continued, “Listen up, you are the root of the Divine Life Palace. As long as you don’t die, even if the Divine Life Palace is destroyed today, I believe that you will come back one day and restore the Divine Palace!

“But if you die, the Divine Life Palace will really be destroyed!!”

Toward the end, Supreme martial artist Yan Shan’s voice was like the voice of the heavenly Duke striking the head, deafening even the deaf!

As soon as he said that, the Divine Life Palace fell into a dead silence, leaving only the sound of heavy breathing.

How could they not understand what Supreme martial artist Yan Shan had said?

“Supreme martial artist Yan Shan, just watch a little longer. We’ll leave after a little longer!”

A female disciple of the Divine Palace bit her lower lip, her eyes full of reluctance.

When Supreme Yan Shan heard this, he could only sigh and agree to this request.

…

Outside the Divine Life Palace.

“Hahaha, I, Long Bai, am destined to be famous in this battle!”

Long Bai’s eyes flickered with excitement as he continued to command the experts on the battlefield to kill Supreme Blood Wave and the others!

The Supremes of the Divine Life Palace were powerful, and because each of them was a special life form, they were able to unleash power several times stronger than those of the same realm!

The Blood Wave Supreme went all out, suppressing Supreme Bing Ye with his attacks.

As Supreme Giant Axe faced Scarlet Sun Demon Master, each of his axe strikes brought with it the power to split the sky, pressing Scarlet Sun Demon Master down.

Heavenly Dipper Ruler was not to be outdone either. Every arrow he shot was able to accurately lock onto the Blood Sky Hall Master, who was moving erratically, forcing him to retreat time and time again.

As for the seven ordinary Supreme martial artists, their strength far exceeded those of the same realm. They often fought one against one, or even three against one.

However, even so, they were still being suppressed and pushed back.

There was no other reason than the fact that too many experts had been mobilized this time.

In addition to the twenty-plus Rulers, there were also hundreds, if not thousands, of Ultimate Rulers. They had all gathered together and formed a battle formation, each of them transforming into a war giant that, when combined, was no weaker than a Ruler.

“An arrow at the end of its flight.”

Long Bai stuck out his tongue and licked the corner of his mouth, shaking his head in disdain.

He didn’t need to do anything in this battle. He just needed to stand here quietly and watch over the battlefield.

“Blood Wave, we can’t hold on much longer.”

Supreme Heavenly Dipper sent the Blood Sky Hall Master, who was about to kill an ordinary Supreme, flying with another arrow. He panted slightly as he transmitted his voice.

“As long as we can hold on. At least, we have to safely transfer all the disciples of the Divine Palace.”

Killing intent flickered in the Ruler Blood Wave’s eyes as the ground beneath his feet turned into a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood. The terrifying power of laws suppressed Supreme Bing Ye.

“Alright, I understand.”

Ruler Heavenly Dipper took a deep breath and said no more.

Rumble!!

On the battlefield, destructive divine arts were used one after another, annihilating everything!

Sword Qi, saber radiance, secret skills, and all sorts of other powers exploded. They were vast and boundless, like a scene of destruction.

Time passed by slowly. After an ordinary Supreme-being from the Divine Life Palace was killed by a joint attack, the already precarious situation of the Divine Life Palace became even more dangerous.

The three lead Supremes, who had the upper hand, were besieged by the other Supremes who had their hands free. The pressure on them increased, and the situation was reversed. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Kill them all!”

Seeing this, Long Bai laughed cruelly.

Bang!

All the dragons transformed into their true forms and spat out their Dragon Pearls, annihilating everything!

In an instant, the Divine Life Palace suffered more casualties.

“Let’s die together!”

An ordinary Supreme-being, who was severely injured and on the verge of death, saw the three Supreme-beings charging toward him. A crazed look appeared in his eyes, and he suddenly chose to self-destruct!

For a moment, the scene was extremely heroic.

“Bang! Bang!”

Two more ordinary Supreme-beings from the Divine Life Palace chose to self-destruct, one after another. It was as if a sad song had been played.

“Go to hell!”

Supreme Giant Axe’s chest was bleeding, and he went completely mad. With a deafening roar, he chopped three advanced Supreme martial artists into pieces.

As for Scarlet Sun Demon Master, he finally seized the opportunity. With a flash in his eyes, he struck Supreme Giant Axe with a Supreme sacred art, almost tearing his divine body apart!

…

Within the Divine Life Palace.

...

Many disciples of the Divine Life Palace could not help but look sad when they saw this.

There were even some gentle female disciples who couldn’t help but cry out.

“Alright, you guys should go.”

Supreme Yan Shan’s voice was hoarse.

He knew that the Ruler Blood Wave and the others wouldn’t be able to hold on for much longer. It was time for him to face the enemy.

Many disciples fell silent upon hearing this. They turned around silently and walked toward the passageway that led to the edge of the universe.

No matter how reluctant, angry, sad, and aggrieved they were, they knew that it was just as Supreme martial artist Yan Shan had said. As long as they stayed, the Divine Life Palace would not be truly destroyed.

They couldn’t let the Ruler Blood Wave and the others sacrifice themselves in vain.

Pa da, pa da.

At this moment, their footsteps were as heavy as mountains. It was as if a stone was pressing on their chests, making it hard for them to breathe.

Just as someone was about to step into the entrance of the passage and almost everyone had turned around to face away from the dark light mirror …

...

Suddenly.

A disciple of the Divine Palace seemed to have noticed something. He let out a soft gasp, then pointed at the dark light mirror and cried out in horror, “Look, what’s that?!”

“What?”

Hearing this, the crowd turned their heads in confusion and looked at the dark light mirror that the disciple of the Divine Palace had pointed to.

At the edge of the battlefield, which was reflected by the dark light mirror.

A cold-looking young man covered in mysterious runes, with purple-gold eyes and a head of black hair that reached his heels, was charging toward the battlefield while enduring the vast Lightning Tribulation!

His speed was extremely fast, and every step he took covered a distance of ten thousand miles, like a Thunderbolt between heaven and earth!

His entire body emitted a dazzling golden light, as if he was an immortal God who had walked out from the Nine Heavens. The next moment, he resolutely crashed into the turbulent battlefield with an extremely overbearing posture!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!”

In an instant, countless terrifying black chaotic divine lightning bolts descended from the Lightning Tribulation, turning the entire battlefield of the Divine Life Palace into a hell of lightning!

“This person is…Jian Wushuang!”

“Jian Wushuang is back!!”

All of a sudden, the disciples of the Divine Life Palace who were about to leave stopped in their tracks at the same time. Their bodies trembled violently, and there was an uproar!
