Chapter 2762: Domain Oppression, Wipeout!

Rumble!

The terrifying oppressive power of the four domains combined instantly went into effect.

Back in the secret realm, Jian Wushuang at the same level of cultivation realm had only used the Prison of Punishment, Star Armor Domain, and Sword World domain oppression methods. The triple oppression was able to suppress Saber Master’s strength by 20 to 30 percent. He had since then gained a new technique— the golden light domain.

The four domain oppression worked in a frenzied manner. It was working well, even on the many Divine Demon Sect Grand Ultimate Gods that were targeted. The oppressive effect was simply astonishing.

“This, this is...”

The Divine Demon Sect Grand Ultimate Gods were horrified.

“Oh, no! My strength has been suppressed by 50 percent!” A Primary-level Grand Ultimate God exclaimed.

The Primary-level Grand Ultimate God’s strength ranked at the bottom among the experts on the battlefield. Under the circumstance when his strength was suppressed by 50 percent, any High-level Grand Ultimate God from Sword Alliance could take the advantage to fire a shot at him and that would be enough to seriously injure him if not kill him directly.

“I’m also being suppressed by as much as 30 percent.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“How can this domain be so powerful?”

The few Divine Demon Sect High-level Grand Ultimate Gods were also extremely furious.

The Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods’ strength was suppressed by 50 percent whereas theirs by 30 percent.

The strongest among all, the Peak Grand Ultimate God, Dong Shen was also being suppressed by the domain oppression. He was shocked.

“Even my strength is being suppressed by 10 percent?” Dong Shen cried in disbelief.

The stronger the opponent’s strength, the weaker the suppression effect.

Jian Wushuang’s domain oppression extended to the entire battlefield on the Divine Demon Sect experts, yet a Peak Grand Ultimate God— Dong Shen was suppressed by nearly 10 percent. ‘Does it mean that if Jian Wushuang put the oppression on me alone, my strength could possibly be suppressed by at least 20 percent?’

‘Just how strong is his domain oppression?’

The strength of Divine Demon Sect experts had been suppressed by the domain oppression, but none of the Sword Alliance experts was affected in any way.

Swoosh!

The Gold-armored Corpse Puppet fired another shot and the battle saber in his hand slashed without mercy at the same level of power he imposed before.

Dong Shen’s expression sank, the giant axes in his hand fell off his grips.

The two collided with each other and caused an explosion of terrifying power. As a result, the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet was sent flying but Dogn Shen only retreated a few steps back.

“Damn it!” Dong Shen’s gaze turned gloomy.

He had an absolute advantage over the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet but after his strength was suppressed by the domain oppression, he only had 90 percent of strength left at work. He could sense the difference when he fought with the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet again. Though he still overpowered the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet, it was not as easy as before.

If that was what Dong Shen was feeling, the other Divine Demon Sect Grand Ultimate Gods were in a worse situation.

“Attack!”

“Kill them!”

Strange Old Tong, Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin, Strange Old Snake, Mr An Ying, Lan Junzhu and the corpse puppets were not affected in the slightest. They naturally would not miss the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They went all out trying to kill the Divine Demon Sect experts.

The Divine Demon Sect Grand Ultimate Gods were in a mess. They flustered.

In addition, after the domain oppression was in action, Jian Wushuang, who had been standing in the void outside the battlefield doing nothing, flipped his hand to summon his Blood Mountain Sword.

“Let’s start killing.”

Jian Wushuang wore a cold grin as he launched himself into the battlefield.

He did not go to Dong Shen. Dong Shen was extremely powerful so it was almost impossible for Jian Wushuang to kill him.

Jian Wushuang’s strategy was to just allow the Gold-armored Corpse Puppet to keep Dong Shen busy so he had no chance to free himself up and assist the other Divine Demon Sect Grand Ultimate Gods.

Jian Wushuang was aiming for the Divine Demon Sect Primary-level and High-level Grand Ultimate Gods.

His figure was zooming around like an agile phantom at his fastest speed.

He appeared in the center of the battlefield and his gaze was immediately locked on a Divine Demon Sect Primary-level Grand Ultimate God right in front of him.

“Strange Old Snake, seize the opportunity.” Jian Wushuang shouted.

Strange Old Snake was startled and a little stunned.

Jian Wushuang pointed with his finger and a gush of Space-time Law power erupted.

The Divine Demon Sect Primary-level Grand Ultimate God who was fleeing froze in place. His body and expression froze as if space-time was at a complete standstill.

The weird scene surprised Strange Old Snake and he immediately understood what Jian Wushuang was saying.

He was the first Grand Ultimate God to be Jian Wushuang’s follower and he once saw Jian Wushuang beheaded Fo Yi. He was familiar with the method to freeze space-time.

Without any hesitation, Strange Old Snake took a step forward and fired a shot at lightning speed.

The Divine Demon Sect Primary-level Grand Ultimate God who was trapped in the frozen space-time was killed by Strange Old Snake before he could recover his senses.

He was the first Grand Ultimate God who was slain.

Jian Wushuang slashed his sword across the other side after helping Strange Old Snake to kill the first Grand Ultimate God.

“Mr An Ying,” Jian Wushuang shouted.

There were two Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods who were fighting against Mr An Ying but they did not survive Jian Wushuang’s A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique.

Although Mr An Ying did not know what exactly was the technique, he took action and killed both of the Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods.

In just an instant, without firing an attack at any of the opponents, Jian Wushuang had killed three Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods easily by cooperating with Strange Old Snake and Mr An Ying using the A Finger Pointing Heavenly Technique.

That made the Divine Demon Sect experts who had been panicking because of the domain oppression even more petrified.

“Run! Run away quickly!”

“It’s weird! What exactly is that?”

“Three Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods were beheaded in just a jiffy. At this rate, I’m afraid that all of us will be beheaded soon!”

“Quick! Run away from this domain.”

Sorrowful and terrified lamentation echoed in all directions.

The Divine Demon Sect Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods had completely lost their intent to fight and they began fleeing for their lives.

“Bastards!”

Dong Shen was furious when he saw what was happening but he did not stop any of them from leaving.

He knew that Divine Demon Sect had lost the battle, it was a miserable defeat. Their losses would be greater if they insisted on carrying on fighting.

The Sword Alliance experts and the corpse puppets were chasing after the Divine Demon Sect experts that were escaping.

Jian Wushuang was among the crowd, his gaze once again landed on that one person.
