Chapter 605: Dark Emperor

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Bone Dragon Emperor led Jian Wushuang to the Dark Continent where the Darkness Temple was located.

“Is that Darkness Temple?”

Jian Wushuang looked at the boundless dark palace and perceived auras of multiple experts within.

As a powerful force in the Ancient World, Darkness Temple had many Skyscraping Realm experts.

“Darkness!”

Bone Dragon Emperor appeared above the Darkness Temple, spreading his aura.

Shortly after, many figures emerged from the Darkness Temple. The leader was the black-robed middle-aged man, whose deep-set eyes sparkled in the darkness.

“Bone Dragon!”

Dark Emperor said with a husky voice and glanced at Jian Wushuang, “Are you Sword Emperor, the rising star?”

“Nice to meet you,” Jian Wushuang said with a hint of humility.

“Dark, since you know who he is, you must know why we are here, right?” Bone Dragon Emperor said straightforwardly.

“I know.” Dark Emperor said, “You want to kill the Ninth Saint Master.”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded and said, “Dark Emperor, Su Ming is my sworn enemy, I hope you can do me a favor.”

“Hum, Jian Wushuang, what do you think the Darkness Temple is?” Dark Emperor stared at Jian Wushuang with cold eyes, “I don’t care what kind of resentment exists. Now that he is a Saint Master of the Darkness Temple, I will protect him. If you kill him, you will become an enemy of the Darkness Temple.”

Hearing that, Jian Wushuang and Bone Dragon Emperor looked at each other and were not surprised.

Naturally the Dark Emperor wouldn’t easily allow them to kill Su Ming.

“Dark Emperor, I have a compass which is the key to finding an Ancient World Token. If you agree, I will give it to you.” Jian Wushuang took out a light yellow compass.

An Ancient World Token was definitely a treasure any Skyscraping Realm experts would crazily fight for.

It allowed entry to the Firmament Territory Feast of the Eternal World.

“A compass, Ancient World Token!” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The Dark Emperor was a little interested in it. He looked at the compass in Jian Wushuang’s hand and nodded, “I know, it’s left by Sect Master Dong. People can find the Ancient World Token he left with the compass, but...”

Dark Emperor smiled coldly, “Jian Wushuang, do you think I care about it? Ridiculous, I would not, even if it was an Ancient World Token. There are five Ancient World Tokens!”

“You’re a descendant of the Sword Ancestor and the Ancient World Token he left must be in your hand too. Therefore, there are still three others in the Ancient World. Luckily, I already have one.”

The Dark Emperor took out a token.

Jian Wushuang looked at it and recognized that it was a real Ancient World Token.

“Has he got an Ancient World Token already?”?Jian Wushuang didn’t expect this.

He planned to entice Dark Emperor with the compass. Now it seemed the compass was useless to him.

“Jian Wushuang, are you trying to buy me over with a compass? Ridiculous, even if I didn’t have one, I would not kill a Saint Master for an Ancient World Token.” Dark Emperor sneered at him.

“This is troublesome.” Jian Wushuang’s look changed, “Do I have to ask master Di Jing for help?”

“Wait a minute, let me have a try.” Bone Dragon Emperor said to Jian Wushuang in a low voice, then he went to Dark Emperor.

“Dark!” Bone Dragon Emperor came to Dark Emperor’s side.

“Bone Dragon, are you trying to help him?” Dark Emperor’s face fell.

He didn’t care about Jian Wushuang. But Bone Dragon Emperor was different.

“No, I just want to tell you something.” Bone Dragon Emperor smiled, lowered his voice and said.

Jian Wushuang and those Saint Masters of the Darkness Temple were just looking quietly at them. They didn’t know what Bone Dragon Emperor had told Dark Emperor, but they saw Dark Emperor’s surprised look.

A moment later, Bone Dragon Emperor went back to Jian Wushuang.

“Bone Dragon Emperor, what did you tell him?” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help asking.

“I told him your age. That is enough.” Bone Dragon Emperor said with a smile.

“That’s it?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“Don’t worry, Dark Emperor is clever. In a few years, you will probably be even stronger than him, then you can kill him easily. So he will not offend you for a Saint Master.” Bone Dragon Emperor laughed and said.

“We have come to an arrangement that he will give you a chance to kill Su Ming, but you need to give him an out first. After all, he is the Temple Master. It’s impossible for him to do nothing and let you kill the Saint Master.”

“That’s it?” Jian Wushuang immediately understood.

Dark Emperor above the Darkness Temple looked over at Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, since Bone Dragon Emperor has solicited favor on behalf of you, I will give you a chance.” Dark Emperor said, drawing out a long black spear, spreading an aura of power, “I will attack you with this the spear. As long as you can survive three moves of my spear, I will not stop you. Otherwise, you have only yourself to blame.”

“Three moves?” Jian Wushuang immediately knew what he meant.
