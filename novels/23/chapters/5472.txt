Chapter 5471 ¬†Soul Crossing

There was only one method left.

That was to pass through the magma under the bridge.

It was too risky.

Jian Wushuang turned to look at Wanyan. He wanted to coax the other party to give it a try, but Wanyan was no fool and would definitely not agree.

Fortune favors the bold.

Let's gamble!

Jian Wushuang gritted his teeth, turned to look at the grass on both sides of the narrow path. Now he understood the role of these weeds.

It was for him to make a boat out of them!

As for using a flying treasure, even thinking about it with his knees, it was impossible.

"This is the situation. Whether you believe it or not, friend, I'm going first!" Jian Wushuang explained the cause and effect he had speculated on. Without insisting on anything, he went alone to cut the grass and make a boat.

As for Wanyan, he really didn't believe it. When Jian Wushuang proposed this method, he looked at Jian Wushuang with a look of seeing a fool, feeling that the other party was crazy, and directly denied it.

However, Jian Wushuang didn't care. He cut all the grass and quickly built a long grass boat. Lifting the grass boat, Jian Wushuang became more and more convinced of his speculation.

In the mundane world, things burned for the dead were made of paper. In ancient times, it might not necessarily have been grass.

Arriving at the riverbank, Jian Wushuang manipulated his telekinesis, making the grass boat float, and then walked up.

Looking at those wandering souls, Jian Wushuang spoke in ancient language, "Come aboard!"

As soon he said this, these wandering souls really walked over, one after another boarding the grass boat.

The grass boat was small, but it also contained the origin of space, with a spatial compression effect. Hundreds of wandering souls boarded the boat without crowding.

Wanyan was stunned by this scene. He still had some doubts and wanted to wait and see when Jian Wushuang went down.

On Jian Wushuang's side, after collecting all the wandering souls, with a mental command, the grass boat began to descend, ultimately landing steadily on the surface of the magma.

As Wanyan looked down from the shore, a colossal beast, the size of ten thousand horses, opened its blood-stained maw and directly swallowed the grass boat, splashing countless magma into the air, then returning to calm.

Wanyan took a sharp breath, covered his chest, and thought to himself, "Thank goodness I didn't follow down there."

Now on the bridge, with no lost souls around, he didn't know what to do. Eventually, he stepped onto the bridge once again. Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

This time, he walked fast, almost running, directly crossing the bridge without stopping, continuing forward.

"Hmm?"

After walking for about a quarter of an hour, Wanyan found no changes around him. Turning his head to look back, the bridge was still there.

He had crossed it!

"Haha, I made it!" Wanyan laughed heartily, feeling very good.

The fatigue on his body was also swept away.

As for Jian Wushuang, he didn't have much thought for others. He continued forward alone.

The farther he went, the wider the road became.

After an entire day, he didn't encounter a second bridge but arrived at a massive Dao Arena.

Inside the Dao Arena, there were altars, statues, and many meditation cushions.

Wanyan carefully observed everything and entered the Dao Arena.

Passing through a thin barrier, the power on his body started to tremble.

Turns out, before entering this place, he had no divine power on him. No wonder he felt exhausted.

After entering the Dao Arena and glancing around, rows of cushions stood, soft to the touch, nothing special.

But when he walked to the front, he discovered someone sitting cross-legged on the most robust cushion!

"Jian Wushuang!" Wanyan exclaimed.

Hearing someone call his name, Jian Wushuang also startled, turning to look back.

"Dao Friend Wanyan!" Jian Wushuang was equally surprised!

Clearly, he arrived here only after successfully crossing the soul bridge. How did Wanyan also come here? Could it be that after he left, more wandering souls appeared on the bridge, and Wanyan followed his method to reach this place?

Just as he was about to inquire, the next words from Wanyan left him dumbfounded.

"You were devoured by a savage beast, weren't you? How are you still alive?"

Jian Wushuang touched his chin, confirming his existence, and replied, "You personally witnessed me being swallowed by a savage beast?"

But after he entered the magma, those savage beasts disappeared!

Smoothly traversing, leading the wandering soul to the other side, he was then transported to this martial practice ground. Simultaneously, his soul realm advanced rapidly, and within the practice ground, he obtained numerous treasures from the altar.

The treasures he acquired this time were no longer comparable to spatial godstones but rather universe source stones.

Tens of thousands of universe source stones, each containing the essence of the Cosmic Origin Source.

Judging by the other party's appearance, it seemed he had just arrived here.

Wanyan recounted his own experiences, leaving Jian Wushuang astonished!

Was it that simple?

Just walked straight in.

Then wasn't he at a huge disadvantage, risking his fall just to come here?

However, Jian Wushuang soon understood. After Wanyan arrived, he gained no treasures at all, equivalent to making a fruitless trip on the first bridge.

Without being asked, he wouldn't disclose how many treasures he had gained. Even if asked, he wouldn't tell.

Now, Wanyan was proudly narrating how smooth his journey had been.

Jian Wushuang shook his head, changed the topic, and asked, "Friend Wanyan, what's the deal with the Dao Marks within this space?"

He had never immersed himself in the Dao, so he knew very little about a complete space.

Only aware that, once the space stabilized, countless stars would be born, marking the advent of the star realm.

Subsequently, black holes emerged, representing the black hole realm, and ascending further led to the cosmic or universe realm.

Understanding only the general concept, the details remained elusive.

Wuyan was in a good mood, patiently explaining to Jian Wushuang, "It's normal not to know that you're about to break through to the Emperor level. Dao Marks represent your Origin Source Dao."

"For instance, say your Origin Source is of the metal element and you cultivate it to the completion or perfection of the ninth level. You then successfully complete Dao Merge, mastering the Spatial Origin Source. Then, what about your Metal Origin Source? Although the Metal Origin Source corresponds to space, it won't completely evolve into space. It leaves Dao Marks within the Spatial Origin Source. The more Dao Marks, the stronger your Metal Origin Source."

"Take me, for example. I cultivate the Shadow Dao. In my Spatial Origin Source, the most abundant Dao Marks are of the Dao of Shadows, followed by the Escape Dao. After mastering the Spatial Origin Source, normally, you can comprehend any Dao. We are aware of the Myriad Dao that can be practiced before merging with the Dao. You should know that its uniqueness lies in being able to cultivate all Origin Source Daos before merging. The more you practice, the stronger you become after merging. Ordinary Origin Sources cannot be cultivated this way, or it will backfire."

Jian Wushuang finally understood.

His Extreme Dao belonged to the exceptional Myriad Daos. No wonder, after devouring so many Origin Sources, there were so many fragments in his Spatial Origin Source, like Dao Marks. However, without integrating the Dao, these fragments were more of a burden, requiring him to refine them further and transform them into Dao Marks.

"So that's how it is! Thanks, Fellow Daoist," Jian Wushuang clasped his hands in gratitude.

While cultivating here and observing the solemn Buddha-like statue, he saw that the Spatial Origin Source of the other party contained an immense number of Dao Marks. The entire space was filled with countless stars and several black holes.
