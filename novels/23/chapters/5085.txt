Chapter 5086 Great Supreme

Jian Wushuang emerged from his black robe with a bony, skeletal hand, as if holding the very chains of fate itself, commencing a deadly strangulation.

The heavens above crumbled and folded in upon themselves, just as they had when dealing with Xu Tuo, exerting immense pressure. VIss·ªãT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).ùò§ùëúùìÇ for the best novel reading experience

The invisible and intangible power was like a shackle that instantly strangled Jian Wushuang.

"Break!" He shouted sternly.

The Selfless True Shadow merged with him directly. This towering Selfless True Shadow, exceeding tens of millions of feet in height, shattered the intangible binding force to pieces!

While breaking through the assault of the black-robed figure, Jian Wushuang moved.

With a divine technique that bent the earth and moved mountains, he silently appeared behind the black-robed figure.

Then, a sword, unseen but adorned with magnificent divine patterns, penetrated his chest without any hindrance.

The black robe shattered, and countless streams of crimson and golden light burst forth from his chest, illuminating the dark-purple sky.

"Is this how he dies? Who is this kid, anyway?" Xu Tuo lost his voice, his eyes filled with disbelief.

In his eyes, Jian Wushuang was nothing more than a Yan Immortal, yet he had just single-handedly obliterated the black-robed figure, which was utterly inconceivable.

But things were far from being so simple!

Just as Jian Wushuang completely shattered the black robe, a voluminous black robe silently appeared behind him.

Jian Wushuang had already sensed it, but he had no time to react and could only brace himself.

A bone-chilling coldness, as if carrying the solitude of eternity, unleashed itself freely.

His complexion changed drastically in an instant, and his entire Immortal body, along with the Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens, was covered and devoured by countless strands of cold radiance.

His divine soul seemed frozen and imprisoned.

Then, the black-robed figure's vast hand reached out once again, pressing against Jian Wushuang.

Ding-ding! Ding!

The sound of clashing golden iron reverberated through the air, and at that moment, the Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens seemed unable to withstand it, as fine cracks began to appear.

This was the first time the Mystic Garb of the Nine Heavens had shown cracks.

With the appearance of these cracks, Jian Wushuang's Undying and Imperishable Immortal Body began to shatter.

He clenched his teeth, his eyes bloodshot, and the path of slaughter completely took over the Undying and Imperishable Immortal Body at that moment!

Guided by divine blood, the Immortal body burned, releasing the Dao of Slaughter completely.

The Selfless True Shadow's phantom once again enhanced, and a crimson blood radiance covered the sky.

The wildly raging blood aura even managed to counteract the extremely eerie coldness at that moment.

The blood radiance soared, forming a violent vortex.

Jian Wushuang forcibly reversed the dire situation, like a god of slaughter charging fiercely.

An unsurpassed strength that had long surpassed the realm of Yan immortals was fully displayed at that moment.

With a punch, the sky collapsed instantly, and the Heavenly Dao belonging to Sancun Mountain finally shattered.

The figure in the black robe retreated, dodging Jian Wushuang's killing move.

However, he had already descended into madness, determined to utterly destroy the black-robed figure, no matter the cost.

Immortal Style, Little Mountain River!

The towering mountain peak of the divine mountain descended from the sky and suppressed the black-robed figure.

Simultaneously, a river of pure Yan power materialized and swept towards its target.

Heavenly fire and thunder rained down in this moment of destruction.

It was a scene of calamity. The sky tore asunder, and the earth cracked into horrifying chasms. Chaos and uncontrollable violence became the predominant themes.

Jian Wushuang did not stop there. An Invisible Sword condensed from scarlet light landed in his hand.

Wushuang Sword Dao, Star River Lake Sea Sword Intent, first move, second move.

Star, River!

The twin sword moves of Star and River struck out together, consumed by a bloodlust beyond control.

The heavens were torn apart, and the earth cracked open, forming terrifying rifts spanning millions of miles.

Chaos and unbridled violence became the dominant themes.

The Sword River, composed of innumerable crimson sword energies, cascaded from the sky like a blood-red waterfall, devouring everything in its path.

Simultaneously, thousands of blood-red columns of light erupted and then burst forth, shrouding everything in a crimson hue.

The black-robed figure was annihilated and disappeared within it. Standing in the far distance, the nearly crumbling Divine Craftsman Xu Tuo and the astonished Nan Xuan watched this scene in awe.

After a long while, Xu Tuo struggled to speak, "Are you sure this Junior is really just a Yan Immortal?"

Nan Xuan shook his head. His Immortal body had recovered within a short time, though it still bore hidden injuries, but it had regained about 60 or 70 percent of its strength.

"I don't know if he's a Yan Immortal or not, but I do know that if we don't take this opportunity to eliminate that terrifying fellow, none of us will survive," Nan Xuan declared.

Xu Tuo reluctantly nodded, his expression grave. "My Sancun Mountain has been reduced to this... It's truly lamentable."

Boom...

A thunderous explosion continued, and more than half of the vast Sancun Mountain Heavenly Region had been destroyed.

Without the support of Divine Craftsman Xu Tuo, it would have likely crumbled into dust long ago.

At present, the Sancun Mountain domain barely held together.

The destructive power of the Wushuang Sword Dao, enhanced by the Dao of Slaughter, had reached an unprecedented level.

Even a Six Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal would undoubtedly be severely injured within this Sword Principle.

Releasing all the power of these two Sword Intents, Jian Wushuang hovered in the void, his chest heaving violently. He did not relax his vigilance because he could sense that the oppressive presence had only disappeared for a moment under the onslaught of the Wushuang Sword Dao.

As the Sword Intent finally dissipated, beneath the exposed void of the sky, the nightmare-like black robe reappeared!

At this moment, even Jian Wushuang, whose consciousness had been invaded by the Dao of Slaughter, revealed a hint of bitterness in his eyes.

Could it be that, under such a frenzied assault, he couldn't even harm this intruder?!

Where did this black-robed figure come from, and what terrifying level had they reached?

A single palm extinguished the Six Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal Xu Tuo, a single finger left Nan Xuan with no resistance, and a single effortless confrontation with Jian Wushuang.

Such ease could perhaps only be achieved by a Peak Grand Yan Immortal?!

Jian Wushuang was shocked. It seemed that only a peak Grand Yan Immortal could explain how terrifying the black-robed figure was.

Divine Craftsman Xu Tuo and Nan Xuan had already arrived by his side to fight against the figure together.

"Could he really be a Peak Grand Yan Immortal? But how could there be such an eccentric Peak Grand Yan Immortal hidden in the Heaven-Patterned Bone Armor?!" Jian Wushuang pondered silently.

If this black-robed figure truly was a Peak Grand Yan Immortal, then even if they all perished today, it seemed unlikely they could inflict any harm upon him.

The black-robed figure was a supreme existence, totally Insurmountable!

With this realization, Jian Wushuang turned to Xu Tuo. "Senior, this matter has nothing to do with you. Please leave now, and I will stay behind to resist."

Upon hearing this, Xu Tuo snorted disdainfully. "Junior, you underestimate this old man too much. Today, I will not retreat a single step. You should consider when it's appropriate for you to scram."

"I'm not leaving either. If we don't settle this score today, I won't have a peaceful day and night!" Nan Xuan declared coldly, his gaze locked onto the black-robed figure.

Jian Wushuang's eyes turned bitter upon hearing their responses. The black-robed figure's strength had long surpassed the range they could handle.

If they stubbornly stayed, none of them had any chance of surviving!

This was the overwhelming pressure imposed by the black-robed figure!
