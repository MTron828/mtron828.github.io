Chapter 5166 - 5166: Standing on the Wrong Side

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

This path of devouring was not without risks; any mistake now, and he would be lost in this vast Great Desolate Wilderness forever.

The journey of enlightenment proved to be more challenging due to the hurdles within himself, not the beings within the universe, a fact that amused Jian Wushuang. He felt like he had transcended the universe itself.

Below, the demonic forces, enshrouded, found their strengths diminished by 90 percent.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The Extreme Dao’s suppression rendered them motionless.

Especially his Heart power; it had grown remarkably stronger, partly due to this. As for his Thought power, these demons were merely countless thoughts of Emperors, transformed into grotesque entities. Yet, his formidable Thought power could still handle them.

Crossing into the fourth level of the Extreme Dao, his Thought power surpassed that of Emperors. The demons formed from these imperial thoughts were no match for him.

“Annihilate!”

With a single thought, the demons perished.

Countless demons ceased struggling and stood silently in the cosmos. Gradually, their bodies dissipated, leaving behind fragmented remnants of the original Dao. These fragments appeared in Jian Wushuangs universe, naturally devoured by his own source.

If it weren’t for Jian Wushuang, these sources would have returned to the

Great Desolate Wilderness’s Heavenly Dao. Now, they were intercepted by him.

If Liu Ya knew that he had devoured all these sources, he probably would have wished to crush him. So many Emperors died in his Dao Arena, and he still aimed to break through. Little did he know that all the benefits from these deceased Emperors had been taken by a Grand Yan Immortal.

However, the Six Crows were currently suppressed by the Eternal Tower, rendering them unable to intervene and compete for these sources.

Whew!

Jian Wushuang exhaled deeply, his hands open, absorbing the remnants quietly.

These remnants contained Emperor Supreme Techniques, and Jian Wushuang meticulously pondered over them. After all, they were techniques at the Emperor level. His current mastery of Sword Dao was self-created. But when it came to the control of his physical body and Yan power, he had yet to obtain any Emperor-level skills. By comprehending these Emperor-level skills now, he could potentially find it easier to cultivate them in the future.

The power of the remnants resembled an ocean, and Jian Wushuang was akin to a black hole, devouring the entire sea.

His strength now sufficient, he absorbed all these remnants to stabilize his own source.

Swiftly, the supreme Dao remnants reached the peak of the fourth level, and the Sword Dao Source directly broke through to the sixth level.

After absorbing all these remnants, Jian Wushuangs Sword Dao Source reached its peak at the sixth level.

This time, Jian Wushuangs gains exceeded his foresight.

He had to thank Zhen Wuyang for banishing him to the Great Desolate Wilderness. In just a few years, he managed to make such significant breakthroughs.

With the recent changes in the Great Desolate Wilderness, Zhen Wuyang might have come as well. If they met, Jian Wushuang would genuinely owe him thanks!

“It’s time to go,” Jian Wushuang thought, and the entire pocket universe folded at his will.

After glancing around, he fixed his direction and prepared to leave.

At the same time, in the direction of Qishen Temple, an Emperor was striding over.

“Qianshou, go fetch them! Bring all these little ones here,” the voice of Tongtian Buddha resonated in his ears.

He was also reminded that Hu Qing and Jian Wushuang must be brought along.

With just a step, he arrived at the empty space where Jian Wushuang had previously devoured monsters.

With his karma-fueled perception, his golden eyes pierced through the endless void.

One hand reached through the boundless emptiness, aiming for Jian Wushuang, while the other grabbed for Jiu Yu and the others.

Jiu Yu and the others were fortunate. They sensed that it was the Qianshou Buddha from the Buddhist Realm and didn’t resist much, falling into the enormous palm without much struggle.

Jian Wushuang, on the other hand, was in a dire situation. He desperately tried to escape the palm’s grasp, but no matter how he struggled, he couldn’t break free.

The Qianshou Buddha grew somewhat irritated and directly seized Jian

Wushuang.

Before the palm returned, Qianshou Buddha took another step, appearing in the Chishui Hall.

The two palms, traversing the void, met and descended onto another palm.

“Wushuang, we meet again!” Jiu Yu smiled slightly, reaching out to help Jian Wushuang up from the ground.

“Are you alright?” Luo Shui and the young monk Hu Qing hurried over to Jian

Wushuang.

“What’s going on?” Jian Wushuang was somewhat bewildered.

“Don’t panic, it’s Emperor Qianshou. We’re saved!” Jiu Yu, as an ancient Perfected Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortal, naturally recognized Qianshou Buddha Lord’s divine power.

In an instant, Jian Wushuang understood, and in his heart, he cursed in anger!

Having finally managed to shake off those pursuers, he found himself caught again. He truly had no desire to accompany these Emperors to the so-called Qishen Temple.

In his view, even if the Qishen Temple held the opportunity to elevate a Perfected Nine Revolutions to the status of an Emperor, it was probably just a slim chance. It was utterly useless to him. He had just reached the Six

Revolutions; reaching the Nine Revolutions was a distant dream. Going to the Qishen Temple now would only make him cannon fodder.

Unfortunately, Emperor personally brought him back, so he couldn’t leave even if he wanted to.

“Well, I must express my gratitude to Emperor!” Jian Wushuang steadied his stance, his face sincere.

Seeing his sincerity, Jiu Yu softened his tone. “Qianshou Lord Buddha is easy to talk to. I will introduce you later!”

Jian Wushuangs face turned red, his voice low. “No, the Emperor is busy with myriad matters, and now you are vying for opportunities. I won’t disturb him.”

He couldn’t forget the scenes from moments ago, when he had attempted to escape multiple times, only to be caught and brought back each time. He doubted Qianshou Buddha would welcome him warmly either. It was better not to provoke that anger.

Although he could claim ignorance about an Emperor’s methods, there was no need to lie. He decided to take one step at a time.

A massive palm swiftly pierced through the pitch-black void, leading to a bright light ahead.

Crash!

The void tore open and closed again.

Jian Wushuang and his companions landed in a grand hall.

“Come to me!” a stern voice echoed.

They looked up to see a towering Buddha right in front of them.

Before they could say anything, they were teleported behind the giant Buddha.

Gazing at the colossal figure and the enormous palms, it seemed Qianshou Buddha was indeed present.

As they settled behind the Buddha, they could finally see their surroundings clearly.

In addition to the many-armed Buddha, the hall contained several hundred extremely powerful auras, each belonging to Emperor-level experts.

Everyone gasped in awe.

It was the first time any of them had witnessed such a grand spectacle. Normally, meeting even one Emperor was a rare event, akin to a miracle. Yet here, a multitude of Emperors had gathered together.

Some found it hard to believe!

Jian Wushuang was fortunate to have met dozens of Emperors in the Heaven-Reaching Buddhist Realm, so he could still comprehend the magnitude of this gathering.

Dozens of Emperors had arrived from the Heaven-Reaching Buddhist Realm alone. Undoubtedly, there were powerful Emperors from other worlds within the grand hall. However, as he scanned the surroundings, he didn’t spot Zhen Wuyang.

Logically, the Great Si Region was very close by. Zhen Wuyang should have arrived by now!

Jian Wushuang felt perplexed. However, upon seeing the eternal collapse of the void outside the grand hall, he thought he might be standing on the wrong side..
