Chapter 2517: Eleven Apparitions!

“Divine Demon Realm?”

“Peak Divine Demon? He’s only a Peak Divine Demon?”

“Is this a joke?”

Experts from both sides could not make peace with what they saw. Some even felt incredibly angry.

How did the golden-robed man before them have such self-confidence?

He had the gall to strike a deal with Xiao Tiexin and announced that he would get rid of the Demonic Moon Prefecture people and even asked them to leave under their own initiative.

Most importantly, both the Xueya Escort Team members and the Ultimate Gods from the Demonic Moon Prefecture almost believed him!

It was because they could not see through his abilities.

The Xueya Escort Team naturally found a beacon of hope from seeing how confident Jian Wushuang was adding to the fact he survived the Governor’s staff strike unscathed.

As for the Demonic Moon Prefecture’s Ultimate Gods which included their Governor, they were made alert and worried that the golden-robed man before them was really a hidden expert.

However, he had finally put his cultivation level on full display.

In the end, he was only a Peak Divine Demon!

Peak Divine Demon was truly considered experts in most regular wildernesses. However in Dark Thunder Territory, especially in this particular situation under the presence of seven Ultimate Gods from the Demonic Moon Prefecture, even a Low-Level Ultimate God could not make any difference, let alone a Peak Divine Demon! Was this some kind of a joke?

“This kid is playing with us!”

Flames of fury were burning in the eyes of the Demonic Moon Prefecture’s Ultimate Gods.

They really almost got stunned by that Peak Divine Demon.

However, they did not know Jian Wushuang’s Peak Divine Demon aura was due to the black stone which raised his aura by two levels higher than its actual. Jian Wushuang’s real divine power aura and cultivation level were in fact that of a Second-Class Divine Demon.

Angry eyes gazed over one by one, but Jian Wushuang did not care at all. Behind him, his enormous divine powers were still surging and formed a 3,000-meter tall God Shadow in the blink of an eye. At the same time, the Seven Star Secret Technique was being unleashed in his body.

“Captain Xiao, remember what you just promised me.” Jian Wushuang smiled mysteriously.

Xiao Tiexin was even more shocked at that point.

Suddenly, Jian Wushuang moved!

Nothing happened when he stood still, but as soon as he did...

Many figures started bursting out one after another—a total of 12 figures covered half of the void.

“This is...” Everyone around was dumbfounded.

“Those are apparitions, Space-time Apparitions!”

“There are twelve figures in total but one of them shouldn’t be a Space-time Apparition. This means there are eleven apparitions in total!”

“Eleven apparitions? Impossible!”

The Demonic Moon Prefecture’s Ultimate Gods were in complete shock.

Space-time Apparitions were only achievable after one had made a breakthrough to the first stage of Space-time Law understanding. The more apparitions one could form meant the higher one’s understanding of the law.

In normal circumstances, high-level Ultimate Gods who were studying the Space-time Law could perhaps form three to four apparitions at most. However, forming 11 at the same time? It was extremely rare among the high-level Ultimate Gods. Normally, only Peak Ultimate Gods who focused on studying Space-time Law could form more than 10 apparitions.

This man before them, however...

“Hmph, so what if you have a slightly deeper understanding of the Space-time Law? You’re still nothing but a mere Peak Divine Demon.” The Governor scoffed in disdain and refused to take him seriously.

However, Jian Wushuang had moved his physical body before the Governor after concurrently forming 11 apparitions and unsheathed his Blood Mountain Sword.

Ring!

A gigantic sword-light appeared out of nowhere.

The sword-light was incredibly attractive and bright as though it could connect Heaven and Earth together.

The moment it appeared, it became the focal center of Heaven and Earth.

It even became an eternity.

Space-time Sword Technique—Heaven and Earth Aligned!

“How’s that possible?”

The Governor who was paying no mind to Jian Wushuang was suddenly shocked beyond words when he saw that gigantic sword-light sweeping at him.

“This... How can this be a sword technique performed by a Divine Demon Realm cultivator? No way!” The Governor roared.

The sword-light was so sufficiently strong that it stunned regular Ultimate Gods. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

At the same time, he felt immense dangers from that sword-light. He had only experienced such feelings from High-Level Ultimate Gods—very powerful High-Level Ultimate Gods.

The Governor did not dare remain arrogant anymore as he instantly turned the bright red stone staff in his hand into a thunderbolt and swung viciously toward the sword-light.

With a huge bang, the seemingly ever-expanding sword-light spread toward every direction.

The Governor’s pupils dilated as he felt a huge momentum being directed towards him, knocking his body, and sent him faltering backward.

However, a ghastly figure already got close to him before he could steady himself.

Infinite sword essences swept around and shrouded him.

The Governor instantly fell into an infinite ocean of sword essence while Jian Wushuang’s Blood Mountain Sword finally erupted with great powers.

One after another, the sword-lights swept toward the Governor like a tsunami.

Too fast! The sword-lights were way too unbelievably fast.

The bewitching blade-light was also very fast when Xiao Tiexin swung her purple sickle, but it was still behind Jian Wushuang’s speed by two folds.

Jian Wushuang had repeatedly flickered among those apparitions of his. He was able to do so due to his tremendous Space-time Law understanding in both the aspects of sword techniques and movement methodologies. As such, it was impossible for the Governor to realize Jian Wushuang’s mysterious appearance beside himself.

All he could do was to swing his stone staff like a madman and tried insanely hard to fend off Jian Wushuang’s attacks.

However, even with such defenses, Jian Wushuang’s pressure was so huge that he was completely being suppressed to the point of gradually losing.

“You Divine Demon maggot, scram!”

The Governor released an explosive shout as his bright red stone staff suddenly began to grow in size with terrifying divine powers began concentrating in his hand.

The bright red stone staff resembled a bright red volcano suddenly falling at Jian Wushuang before completely erupted.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned frosty as his sword essence began to sweep around and immediately turned his Blood Mountain Sword into a long snake.

With a tearing sound, layers of the void were torn open like pieces of paper as everything was dissolved by the sword stroke.

It was soundless and motionless without a single trace.

The only exception was a sword shadow that swept past.

Space-time Sword Technique, Third Form—Pure Shadow!

The violently erupting bright red volcano was also being torn open as a large amount of vicious divine powers was dispersed into its surroundings.

The remaining sword-light still had quite a bit of momentum and continued sweeping toward the Governor.

“Thud!”

The Governor got swept by the sword-light which immediately caused his body to be severely injured. His aura began to weaken after spitting out a big gulp of blood.

A huge amount of his divine powers began to gradually decrease. However, the golden-robed man who was holding a long sword continued to issue attacks at him which were capable of tearing open everything in the void.
