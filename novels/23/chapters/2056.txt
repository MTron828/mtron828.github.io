2057 Investigation Resul

“Green Fire World has used the painstaking efforts of the ancestors and the lives of experts to finally be where it is today. I am not going to let it ruin in my hand!”

“Eternal Chaotic World has to win this war!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands tightly and his eyes were glaring.

Just then…

“Jian Wushuang, hurry up and come to Thunderbolt Island,” Emperor Bai sent him a message.

Jian Wushuang was surprised. He handed down some tasks before he headed over to Thunderbolt Island.

Thunderbolt Island was still the core cultivation place in Sanctuary Alliance.

Although there was Green Fire World, only genius disciples from Eternal Chaotic World who got to be in Green Fire World. The experts above Real God level had never once entered Green Fire World.

The lowest requirement to enter Thunderbolt Island was to be a Void Real God.

Hence, one equaled to a genius cultivation sanctuary and the other one equaled to an opportunity land for experts to gather. Both places were different.

Jian Wushuang got to on Thunderbolt Island through a spacetime wormhole. Then, he went directly to Sanctuary Mountain.

On his way there, there were naturally many Real Gods or Almighties who saw him.

“It’s Sword Emperor!”

“I heard that Sword Emperor performed extraordinary deeds for Sanctuary Alliance. He is now one of the higher-ups in Sanctuary Alliance. He is holding quite a high position!”

“Mm, I heard that too. There is even a rumor saying Abysmal Saint Master and Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s position and power are below Sword Emperor’s.”

“Seriously? How long since Sword Emperor started cultivation? This is crazy!”

Many experts complimented in secret.

Although it had only been twenty years since the war in Three-Emperors World, Jian Wushuang had received his recognition in Sanctuary Alliance.

Due to the position and power of these Real Gods and Almighties, they didn’t know much. However, among the higher-ups, the Great Emperors acknowledged that Jian Wushuang was only second to Emperor Bai.

Sanctuary Mountain, on a huge estate.

There were three figures waiting patiently. Very soon, Jian Wushuang arrived in the estate.

“Mister Emperor Bai, Abysmal… huh? Ancestor Tian Chen is here too?” Jian Wushuang was surprised as he looked at Ancestor Tian Chen next to him.

“Jian Wushuang, Tian Chen is absolutely trustworthy. It is impossible for him to be the enemy’s spy. During this time, Tian Chen and I have been investigating the spy in secret,” Emperor Bai said.

Jian Wushuang nodded faintly, not suspecting anything.

Among the Great Emperors in Sanctuary Alliance, the most impossible person would be Ancestor Tian Chen.

“Let’s get into the business,” Ancestor Tian Chen spoke directly. “Sword Emperor, Abysmal, we looked to you today because there was a result from the investigation of Great Emperor Zi Xu.”

“How is it?” Jian Wushuang asked closely.

“We are still can’t be sure that Great Emperor Zi Xu is the spy. However, through some special tactics that Mister Emperor Bai and I used to investigate him, we got some information. Both of you, take a look,” Ancestor Tiqn Chen passed a token to Jian Wushuang and Abysmal Saint Master each.

Jian Wushuang and Abysmal Saint Master looked through the tokens carefully.

Their eyes dilated in shock as they went through the tokens.

“Seriously? Great Emperor Zi Xu killed so many people in secret? And all of them were top geniuses!” Jian Wushuang lifted his face and his eyes were filled with shock.

In the token, there was a record of various methods with which Great Emperor Zi Xu had killed the top geniuses in Eternal Chaotic World.

There was a total of over a dozen pieces of information. In other words, Great Emperor Zi Xu had killed over a dozen top geniuses and all the top geniuses had stood a chance to become Peak Emperor God. Three of them could even have turned into Great Emperors.

But in the end, they were killed by Great Emperor Zi Xu in secret and it was done very secretively. There was no sign pointed at him in the outside world.

If it wasn’t only because they already suspected Great Emperor Zi Xu to begin with, but also because Emperor Bai and Ancestor Tian Chen used many unique ways to deal with the experts who worked for Great Emperor Zi Xu… They were afraid that there were more deaths that were related to Great Emperor Zi Xu.

“Lord Hatred… he was the one who killed Lord Hatred!” Abysmal Saint Master creased his eyebrows.

Lord Hatred was a top genius who could have swept over Eternal Chaotic World two million years ago. He was widely known as a super monster then.

He was extremely gifted. After a short cultivation period of over a hundred thousand years, he reached Sir God level and he was powerful. It was said that when he first reached Sir God level, his comprehension of doctrine was on the ninth level of Doctrine Palace. In short, he was the standard of a Great Emperor. He was so powerful that he could easily defeat an Emperor God at Sir God level!

Back then, he had been extremely famous. It was merely a matter of time until he became a Great Emperor. He might even be on par with Red Dragon King and Abysmal Saint Master, or he might be stronger than them.

However, such a super genius had suddenly passed away.

Back then, the experts in Eternal Chaotic World said that Lord Hatred was assassinated by the experts from Acheron Palace. Hence, no one suspected anything.

Until then only they had found out that Lord Hatred died in the hands of Great Emperor Zi Xu.

“The geniuses who were removed by Great Emperor Zi Xu in secret, the weakest could likely have become a strong Emperor God while the more impressive top geniuses, like Lord Hatred, could totally become the strongest fighting power in Sanctuary Alliance. But in the end, before they could grow up. Great Emperor Zi Xu killed them in the dark.”

“These geniuses shared no resentment of him. Plus, he had killed the geniuses secretly. No one in the outside world knew about it.”

“Why does he want to kill these top geniuses?”

“If the reason of him killing super geniuses like Lord Hatred was because he was worried they might threaten his position, those who weren’t as impressive as Lord Hatred wouldn’t be able to pose a threat to him. It was unnecessary for him to kill them.”

“With everything mentioned, plus the fact that he hides his true power, Emperor Bai and I think that the possibility of him being the spy is higher than seventy percent!” Ancestor Tian Chen said solemnly.

“Only seventy percent?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

“Although it is only seventy percent and we are not entirely sure, it is sufficient for us to take him head-on,” Emperor Bai said.

“Take him head-on?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

Previously, Emperor Bai and Ancestor Tian Chen had only been investigating Great Emperor Zi Xu secretly. On the surface, they hadn’t fallen out with Great Emperor Zi Xu.

To deal with him head-on…

“Let’s go. We shall make a trip to the estate Zi Xu is staying in,” Emperor Bai said.

Jian Wushuang, Abysmal Saint Master and Ancestor Tian Chen naturally followed.

The estate that Great Emperor Zi Xu was staying in was in a unique void in Eternal Chaotic World.

The estate was extremely huge, like a paradise.

Jian Wushuang, Emperor Bai, Abysmal Saint Master and Ancestor Tian Chen appeared in the void above the huge estate.
