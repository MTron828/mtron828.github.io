4261 The Tenth City

The Tenth City.

Qiu Long held the Ninth City’s City Lord’s hand as they strolled down the streets of the Tenth City. They immediately attracted a lot of attention.

“Who is this person?”

“Then…why does the old man who’s being held by the hand look so familiar?”

“Not good! This old man is the Ninth City’s City Lord, Divine Lord Qian Qi!”

“Divine Lord Qian Qi is a veteran Ultimate Ruler. How could he be a slave?”

“What’s this person’s background?”

Immediately, after the white-haired old man’s identity was recognized, it immediately caused a burst of exclamations in the crowd. Everyone quietly moved back a little, keeping a distance from Qiu Long.

But there were also some Ultimate Rulers who could not stand it. They immediately stood up, and one of them said with a cold face, “Sir, Divine Lord Qian Qi has always been on good terms with others and has never gotten involved in disputes. I wonder how he has offended you for you to treat him like this? As if you’re a pig or a dog?”

As a veteran Ultimate Ruler, Divine Lord Qian Qi had stayed in the Ancient Path of Stars’ Ninth City for tens of thousands of years. He was also a good person and was naturally popular.

The people who stood out to speak were the people who had received Divine Lord Qian Qi’s favor in the past.

When Qiu Long saw that, he chuckled and patted Divine Lord Qian Qi’s head casually, causing his head to produce loud slapping sounds. He squinted his eyes and said, “Dog slave, I didn’t expect you to be so popular in a place full of trash.”

Divine Lord Qian Qi’s heart trembled. He did not know what had happened to him. Despite being humiliated by Qiu Long, there was not any anger on his face. Instead, it was filled with fear.

“Dog slave, I think these people are too noisy. What do you think?” Qiu Long raised his head and looked at the few Ultimate Rulers who spoke up for justice and chuckled.

When Divine Lord Qian Qi heard that, he nodded his head in agreement, just like a dog wagging its tail to its owner to please him.

“Hahaha, you’re becoming more and more like a slave.”

“Haha!” Qiu Long laughed and stretched out his right hand, grabbing at the few Ultimate Rulers who had spoken out for justice.

“I’ll get them to accompany you!”

Whoosh!

Qiu Long’s arm suddenly stretched out, and his five fingernails turned black and sharp like five ribbons. Then, he clawed down!

“You’re looking for death!”

Instantly, the expressions of the few Ultimate Rulers changed. Divine power surged from their bodies, and they struck at Qiu Long’s arm!

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Like stones sinking into the ocean, the attacks of these Ultimate Rulers landed on Qiu Long’s arm and were obliterated without even causing a ripple.

The next moment!

Bang!

Qiu Long’s five fingers suddenly grabbed the neck of one of the Ultimate Rulers.

“Come over here!”

“Hehe!” Qiu Long sneered, and in an instant, he grabbed the Ultimate Ruler.

No matter how he, the Ultimate Ruler, struggled, the five fingers of the Dragon-trapping prisoner were like five towering mountains, rendering him unable to move.

“I think I heard you criticizing me just now? Hehe.” Qiu Long chuckled, and then a bone spike shot out from his back. It transformed into a pitch-black chain that bound the neck of the Ultimate Ruler.

“Since you care so much about this dog slave, then you can accompany him!”

“Run!” The remaining Ultimate Ruler’s expression changed upon seeing this, and he immediately turned to flee.

However, the next moment…

Whoosh! Whoosh!

On the back of the dragon, the black bone spikes turned into black chains again and shot toward the Ultimate Rulers!

In the space of a few breaths, the black chains had pierced through the bodies of these Ultimate Rulers.

Then, the Ultimate Rulers all fell and turned into dust amid their shrill howls.

All of a sudden, on the streets of the Tenth City, Qiu Long’s strange laughter and mournful wails sounded one after another.

On another street.

Ruler Hao Jin wielded a spear and was dressed in godly armor as he patrolled the area.

After Jian Wushuang had left, he had sought refuge with Lord Blue. Now, he was working under Lord Blue as a divine armor guard while he trained himself and improved his cultivation. He wanted to pass the God Refining Tower trial as soon as possible, enter the back eight cities, and rely on Jian Wushuang.

Ruler Hao Jin frowned when he heard the screams from the nearby streets. He decided to go over and take a look.

Ruler Hao Jin walked to the side of the street and immediately saw the scene of Qiu Long killing several other Rulers. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Eh, another one.”

Qiu Long’s white eyes turned slightly as he looked at the approaching Ruler Hao Jin. The corners of his mouth slowly curled up into an evil smile.

Ruler Hao Jin’s heart instantly turned cold. He wasn’t a slow-witted person. When he saw this, he immediately realized that this person was far from someone he could fight against. He immediately turned to flee.

“This person is quite clever.”

Qiu Long shook his head. Just as he was about to let Ruler Hao Jin off, Divine Lord Qian Qi suddenly said, “Master, aren’t you looking for the Blood Sword? I remember that the person just now was the Blood Sword’s partner. If we can capture him, we’ll definitely know where the Blood Sword is.”

“Oh?”

“You’re courting death!” Qiu Long raised an eyebrow, and he immediately shot out a large hand to grab Ruler Hao Jin, who had already fled a thousand kilometers.

Ruler Hao Jin’s expression changed drastically, but he knew that struggling was useless. He resigned himself to his fate and allowed the Dragon to grab him.

“You…what do you want to do?” Ruler Hao Jin’s lips trembled as he looked at Qiu Long.

Qiu Long sized up Ruler Hao Jin and chuckled. “I ask you, do you know where the Blood Sword is?”

“You’re looking for Lord Blood Sword?”

Ruler Hao Jin’s heart instantly trembled.

…

At the same time, in the 12th city.

After Jian Wushuang flew out of the governor’s mansion, he immediately saw the six commanders, including Commander Mountain Shaker, coming over together. There were also sixty Ultimate Rulers standing behind them.

Seeing Jian Wushuang come out, except for the ten Ultimate Rulers behind Commander Mountain Shaker, who looked extremely reverent because they had seen Jian Wushuang fight, the other fifty Ultimate Rulers looked at Jian Wushuang with disdain. They did not show any respect.

“Blood Sword, I’ve brought you the person. We still have important matters to attend to, so we’ll take our leave first.” Mountain Shaker and the other six great commanders greeted him with a smile.

“Alright,” he said.

Jian Wushuang nodded.

The few of them chatted for a while more before the six commanders left, leaving Jian Wushuang and the sixty Ultimate Rulers.

At first, with the six commanders present, the fifty Ultimate Rulers didn’t dare to be too presumptuous. However, after the six commanders left, the fifty Ultimate Rulers looked at Jian Wushuang with disdain.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang shook his head in his heart. He knew that these people were disdainful of him. He also knew that they were dissatisfied with the sudden transfer from their original commander and wanted to give him a chance to show off his power.

However, Jian Wushuang did not bother to argue with them. He said indifferently, “You can do whatever you want. I won’t restrict you too much, as long as you don’t disturb me.”

After saying that, Jian Wushuang turned around and walked away. Now that the Wuqi Divine Sword was about to be repaired and the two venomous fangs of Heavenly Snake Playboy were about to be refined, it was time for him to leave.
