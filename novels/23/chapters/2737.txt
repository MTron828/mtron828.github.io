Chapter 2738: Swept Away

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Holy Treasure.

A Holy Treasure in the hands of an Undying Saint was rumored to be capable of releasing earth-shattering power.

Even though Saber Master was not an Undying Saint and unable to truly unleash the Holy Treasure’s potential power, it would still be extremely terrifying for him to even unleash part of its power.

“I previously obtained Master Gu’s Interspatial Ring and was quite satisfied with my gains of the purple clock and this battle saber so I did not think about attacking you to snatch your precious items. Unfortunately...you came to me by yourself, hence you cannot blame me for what’s about to happen next.” Saber Master smiled coldly as he looked at them snarkily with his eyes.

“So it’s true that he obtained Master Gu’s Interspatial Ring,” Devilish Wind King growled slowly.

“He has finally admitted to it?” Hong Chen and Long Xianzi also had darkened expressions on their faces.

“Haha...so what if I’ve admitted to it? Do you guys plan to snatch the Interspatial Ring from me?” The Saber Master scoffed. “You guys should think about how to survive my attacks first.”

A murderous intent flashed through the Saber Master’s eyes once he finished speaking.

Boom!

Saber Master moved with the purple clock still engulfing his body as he held the crimson battle saber in his hands while burning flames rose.

The crimson battle saber attacked Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen in an imposing and unstoppable manner like it was the king of sabers!

“Block him!!” Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen realized it was not a good idea to trifle with the Saber Master at that moment, hence he did not proactively move forward to engage the Saber Master. He instead ordered the four Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets to form the corpse puppet formation and faced the attack.

“Shoo!” The Saber Master shouted angrily and waved his crimson battle saber.

Hum!!

A wave of horrendous power suddenly arrived.

Saber Master’s strength did not experience any great elevation as he was still under the Golden Light Domain, Prison of Punishment, and Sword World’s triple suppression.

The saber skills he displayed were one he previously displayed with the only difference being the changed mystical weapon in his hands.

Previously, it was only an Offensive Divine Weapon at the Pinnacle Heavenly Treasure level which was switched to a Holy Treasure level at that moment.

There was a huge difference between both items.

Bang!

Heaven and Earth trembled following a loud bang.

The violent divine power formed a storm and unscrupulously swept towards its surrounding.

Amid the divine power storm, the corpse puppet formation formed by the four Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets instantly collapsed with two of the four Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets killed on the spot while the remaining two were sent flying away.

“What?” Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen’s facial expression immediately changed when he saw that.

The corpse puppet formation’s combat power formed by the four Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets was slightly stronger than a Silver-armored Corpse Puppet but they were instantly destroyed in the end by Saber Master in a single attack? Saber Master’s strength had been elevated to such a level?

“Haha... Die!!” Saber Master laughed out loudly as he continued to attack Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen after defeating those four Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets.

“Shit!” Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen was shocked and tried to escape in a crazed manner.

Long Xianzi and Jian Wuhuang who were alongside him also tried everything they could to stop Saber Master.

However, Saber Master was extremely peremptory and completely unaffected. He already arrived behind Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen with just a couple of strides.

The crimson battle saber once again swung outward.

A crimson saber-light directly traveled forward brightly and dazzlingly.

The saber-light even carried burning flames around it.

Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen had a crazed look in his eyes when he saw the crimson saber-light coming toward him. Waves of dull lights also suffused from the black-colored armor covering his body like beast scales as a wave of ancient aura was unleashed.

Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen had wanted to forcefully endure the saber attack by relying on his Divine Body and the defensive armor covering his body.

However...

The crimson saber-light instantly cut the black armor following with some clanking sound before numerous scales on the armor immediately split apart before Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen’s Divine Body was also directly cut open.

Whoosh!

The saber-light flew through Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen’s body and reappeared from the other side.

Saber Master also appeared behind Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen with a cruel smirk at the edge of his mouth.

“How... How is this possible?” Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen’s eyes glared openly with a disbelief expression.

He indeed felt the whole situation was unbelievable.

After all, the defensive armor he had on was a Pinnacle Heavenly Treasure he obtained from the secret realm.

The defensive armor was extremely precious with astounding physical protective capability. He was quite confident in the defensive armor hence he chose to forcefully endure Saber Master’s attack in his moment of helplessness.

He felt he should be able to withstand the attack or at worst—badly wounded by it.

He was even prepared to be badly injured. However, he did not expect his Pinnacle Heavenly Treasure defensive armor would be immediately cut open by the battle saber.

The Pinnacle Heavenly Treasure defensive armor seems as though it was made out of paper before the Holy Treasure crimson battle saber?

“A Holy Treasure is truly a Holy Treasure.”

Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen smiled bitterly at the bottom of his heart but his chances of staying alive had been destroyed.

Long Xianzi next to him was also horrified when she saw the situation.

Saber Master took out the Holy Treasure battle saber and defeated all those four Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets with one move before also killing Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen with a single attack.

It had to be known that Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen was the strongest amongst them apart from Saber Master. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

In addition, Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen had a Pinnacle Heavenly Treasure defensive armor but was still killed with a single hit. At that moment, if Saber Master wanted to kill them, would it not be...

“Run!!” Long Xianzi did not hesitate as she was already frightened out of her mind and dared not continue fighting with Saber Master. Instead, she immediately turned around and wanted to escape.

“You want to escape?” Saber Master still smiled coldly as he had been focusing on Long Xianzi since early on.

Although the four of them joined forces during the battle alongside the four Bronze-armored Corpse Puppets that besieged him, Hong Chen and Long Xianzi were the ones who had been confronting him head-on. Jian Wushuang and Devilish Wind King had been looking for opportunities to attack him, hence both of them were quite far away.

He had killed Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen at that moment, hence his next target would naturally be Long Xianzi.

“Die!” Saber Master was extremely hostile and moved speedily.

Although he was suppressed by domains, he was still much faster than Long Xianzi and had already caught up with Long Xianzi within moments.

He did not give Long Xianzi any chances to escape once he caught up to her.

“Saber Master, I don’t want Master Gu’s Interspatial Ring anymore. Please spare me,” cried Long Xianzi out in a shrill voice.

“Spare you? Haha... It’s too late now!!” The Saber Master smiled coldly.

He previously did not take action toward Long Xianzi and the rest as he had already gotten what he wanted. However, how could he stop at that moment since he had already taken action and killed Grand Ultimate God Hong Chen?
