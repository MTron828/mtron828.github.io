Chapter 1313: Everything Is Ready!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In the last ten years before the God Test, Jian Wushuang kept cultivating in the the secret room.

He had kept trying to understand the swordsmanship that he had learnt from the Little Scattered Stars Game.

His swordsmanship had also reached a new height.

And the God Test was approaching.

…Time passed quickly and there were only ten days left!

The LAST ten days.

Jian Wushuang was sitting in the secret room quietly, breathing slowly.

The closer the God Test was, the more peaceful he was.

“In the past one hundred and twenty years, I have already improved myself as needed, and made all necessary preparations!”

“Everything is ready!”

Jian Wushuang held his hands tightly.

In the past one hundred and twenty years, he had cultivated the second part of the Gold Secret Skills to dramatically improve his magic power. Then he got the Green Bell, through which he mastered the “Mountain Stillness” secret skill to greatly enhance his body defense ability.

Then, he interpreted the first part of the Scarlet Kingdom Secret Skills, which further improved his overall power.

Finally, there was his swordsmanship.

He figured out a way to do the Little Scattered Stars Game using a hundred years, and spent more than ten years to understand what he learnt, so that his swordsmanship also skyrocketed.

In a word, he had done his best to raise his abilities in all aspects.

Now he was in the best condition in his current level!

Whether he could survive the God Test all depended on his Luck now!

“It’s time to go.”

Jian Wushuang slowly stood up, took a breath, and then went to the Tribulation Passing Pinnacle.

He arrived at the top of the Tribulation Passing Pinnacle ten days before the God Test and sat there to wait.

As soon as he sat down, the heavens started rumbling. The universe changed it’s color and a large block of thunderclouds began to gather.

King of Venomous Worms sighed, “There are still ten days left before the God Test but the thunderclouds have already begun to gather and accumulate power.”

Jian Wushuang could feel what was happening but he did not care. Instead, he closed his eyes and tried to make his heart empty and peaceful.

After Jian Wushuang’s arrival, Dayu Palace began bustling.

Many talents and disciples from Dayu Palace all rushed to the Tribulation Passing Pinnacle. They just stood ten thousand miles away from the Pinnacle and watched Jian Wushuang in the distance.

Of course, they were also aware of the thunderclouds that were gathering.

“Why are the thunderclouds gathering so early?”

“Indeed too early. Ordinary practitioners usually see thunderclouds gather an hour before the God Test. But I guess Jian Wushuang’s God Test will still be a few days later!”

“Ten days exactly!”

The talents that had arrived were having a heated discussion.

They couldn’t believe what was happening.

On the day when the Omen came, Jian Wushuang could accurately feel that the God Test would come one hundred and twenty years later.

In another word, there was exactly ten days left!

Powerful Gods in Scarlet Island, Gold-sun Sect and Holy Prefecture also came here one after another.

“I have done my best to help you. Whether you can get through the God Test now all depends on you.”

Scarlet started at Jian Wushuang and said to him.

Beside him, there were more than a dozen Universe Gods from Scarlet Islands, including the Universe God.

More than half of the Universe Gods from Scarlet Island had made acquaintances with Jian Wushuang in Dayu Palace. All of them came here to see him except Tian Ying Universe God, who couldn’t show up due to his special identity.

“The God Test will come in ten days, but the thunderclouds have already been gathering?”

The Universe Gods looked worried.

Next to the group from the Scarlet Island was the Holy Prefecture.

More than ten Universe Gods came here too, led by Universe God in the Nine Oceans.

Universe God in the Nine Oceans watched Jian Wushuang with a murderous expression.

“Jian Wushuang, you are now the recognized genius in Dayu Universe, and even Qingyang was defeated by you. But the more powerful you are, the more dangerous the God Test will be!”

“Nothing but thunderclouds have gathered for an entire ten days! I guess you are doomed to die in the God Test!”

Universe God in the Nine Oceans was excited about that.

He was eager to see Jian Wushuang die in the God Test.

It was because he wouldn’t have to make so much efforts to take revenge of Jian Wushuang.

Gold-sun Sect Master also hoped Jian Wushuang to die.

He was aware of the genius of Jian Wushuang after witnessing how Qing Yang Universe God was killed in the battle with Jian Wushuang.

“But this time, Jian Wushuang won’t be so lucky!”

He also looked grim.

In the heaven near the Tribulation Passing Pinnacle stood Dayu Palace Master and Lord Wu Cang.

Dayu Palace Master had already banned anyone from disturbing Jian Wushuang, and anyone who disobeyed would be killed.

No one dared to violate the rule under the authority of Dayu Palace Master.

And at that moment, two Universe Gods from the Third Heaven were also looking at the thunderclouds.

“The thunderclouds formed as early as when the Omen came. And now they start to accumulate power ten days before the God Test and will continue for entire ten days. How powerful it is!”

“During my countless years in Snow Kingdom I have seen countless talents going through the God Test. The highest record of thundercloud gathering I know was only two days. But in Jian Wushuang’s case, ten days!”

They had had rich experiences and witnessed a lot of cases.

But what was happening was astonishing to them.

From the ten-days gathering clouds, they could see how crazy and horrible the coming God Test would be.

In the heaven, endless thunderclouds gathered, with increasing power and pressure.

Ten days soon passed by.
