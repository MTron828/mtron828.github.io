Chapter 2785: Blood Thunder King Died!

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“The fifth one!” Jian Wushuang held the sword single-handedly as he looked at the body of the young man in silver robes dropped downwards. However, he had a cold smile on his face.

This smile of his looked like the smile of a demon in the eyes of the experts from the Heavenly Modest Palace and those under the lead of Blood Thunder King.

“Su Dao actually died?””

“Even Su Dao was easily killed by him?”

“This Jian Yi is really scary!”

The experts from Heavenly Modest Palace were extremely shocked.

They understood the strength of that young man in silver robes, Su Dao, very well.

Su Dao was capable of confronting even Peak Grand Ultimate Gods and it was difficult for usual Peak Grand Ultimate Gods even if they wanted to kill him. However, he was simply beheaded by Jian Wushuang right now. Jian Wushuang’s strength had undoubtedly arrived at the level of Peak Grand Ultimate God.

How scary was it when this Peak Grand Ultimate God was great in the Space-time Law and even held some sort of secret technique that stagnated time to allow him to move willfully?

Whoosh!

It could be seen that Jian Wushuang went floating out again like a ghost.

Right now, his target was no longer Grand-level Grand Ultimate Gods, he directly took action as long as they were close to him.

“The sixth one!”

“The seventh one!”

“The eighth one!”

One by one, the Grand Ultimate Gods that were considered top experts in the Danyang Holy Domain were simply killed like animals in front of Jian Wushuang.

Slaughter!

This was an absolute slaughter.

Those two Peak Grand Ultimate Gods from the Heavenly Modest Palace were separately pestered by Yin Su’er and Gold-armored Corpse Puppet so they had no opportunity to take action.

As these two Peak Grand Ultimate Gods were unable to do anything, nobody in the entire battlefield was able to stop Jian Wushuang.

He was a God of Killing and what he wanted to do was killing crazily.

However, all the Grand Ultimate Gods that he had his eyes on had no chance of escaping. Instead, they were directly killed before they had time to react.

Moments after killing Su Dao, Jian Wushuang killed another five Grand Ultimate Gods with ultimate means!!

Together with those five previously, a total of ten Grand Ultimate Gods had died in the hands of Jian Wushuang not long since the battle began.

This horrendous killing had completely stunned the experts from the Heavenly Modest Palace and those under the lead of the Blood Thunder King.

“Run! Run!!”

“”Quickly, run! If we don’t run, all of us would be killed by this Jian Yi!”

“This is too scary, he’s too scary!”

Both Peak Grand Ultimate Gods from the Heavenly Modest Palace and Blood Thunder King had not given any orders. However, the Grand Ultimate Gods under their lead could not stand it anymore and had already started to escape crazily.

They were not dumb and they knew how to observe with their eyes.

Jian Wushuang’s killing was really too quick and it was too scary.

It was like killing animals and they were unable to withstand it. Under such circumstances, they had to think for their lives.

Escaping was definitely the wisest choice.

At this moment, they could not think of their own parties as protecting their own lives was the most important thing.

“B*stard!!”

The unruly elder in black robes, Chen Kong, who was fighting with Yin Su’er also noticed this scene and his facial expression darkened badly.

He looked at Jian Wushuang deeply and was secretly regretful.

He had no idea that Jian Wushuang would be so strong and had such horrendous means of killing.

Under circumstances when he and the other Peak Grand Ultimate God were entangled, Jian Wushuang was capable of wiping everything out...

“There’s no other way!”

“Retreat!!” Although he was secretly filled with unwillingness, Chen Kong still immediately gave orders to retreat.

He was also helpless. Under such circumstances, this battle would not be continued even if he did not give the orders.

Even if he forced those Grand Ultimate Gods to continue fighting with his own power, there would only be one outcome and it was to be killed by Jian Wushuang. The final result was just being defeated.

If that was the case, they should just try their best to contain their combat power to return to the Heavenly Modest Palace.

“Retreat!”

“Retreat!”

The experts from Heavenly Modest Palace and under the lead of Blood Thunder King were relieved when they heard Chen Kong’s orders. They immediately thought of ways to shake off their opponents and started retreating.

Yin Su’er’s faction and the Sword Alliance definitely would not stop here. Instead, they started another round of chase to kill.

As for Jian Wushuang, he already had his eyes locked on one person.

“Everybody can leave but him!” Jian Wushuang slightly narrowed his eyes as he stared at Blood Thunder King, who also started to run and escape.

Blood Thunder King was a member of the Crimson Stone Fort and leader of one of the bigger factions.

As a result, he colluded with Heavenly Modest Palace, an outsider, and tried to snatch the control over the Crimson Stone Fort. He could be called as a rebellion of the Crimson Stone Fort.

He definitely had to stay as he was heinous.

“Blood Thunder King!!” Jian Wushuang yelled loudly while Yin Su’er, who was beside him, also had an extremely cold expression on her face.

The two of them had completely locked on Blood Thunder King but Jian Wushuang was speedily and had immediately skimmed over.

Under the suppression of the huge domain, the speed of Blood Thunder King’s escape was greatly reduced. Jian Wushuang caught up with him easily.

Then, Jian Wushuang stressed out his right hand and pointed in the direction of the Blood Thunder King.

The effects of the majestic Space-time Law started acting.

“This is bad!!” The expression on Blood Thunder King’s face changed greatly. Jian Wushuang had used this skill many times in this battle and Blood Thunder King clearly understood the weirdness and scariness of this skill. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

He was not good in the Space-time Law and once he was hit by this, he might be instantly killed by Jian Wushuang under the Space-time stagnation.

“Master Chen Kong, save me! Save me, quick!!” Blood Thunder King started yelling drearily.

At this moment of life and death, he could only hope that those two Peak Grand Ultimate Gods from the Heavenly Modest Palace would come to his rescue.

Apart from that, only these two Peak Grand Ultimate Gods were capable of saving him.

However, Chen Kong’s face slightly darkened when he heard Blood Thunder King yelling. He only swept past Blood Thunder King coldly without pausing himself.

Chen Kong totally ignored Blood Thunder King’s call for help so naturally none of the Grand Ultimate Gods from the Heavenly Modest Palace would go rescue him.

As for the Grand Ultimate Gods that were under Blood Thunder King’s lead, there were a small number of them left but their strength was beneath him. They were completely frightened of Jian Wushuang and humans were selfish. They were unable to protect themselves under such circumstances, who would exchange for Blood Thunder Kings life with their own lives?

“No! No!!!” Blood Thunder King became extremely frightened when he saw that none of the surrounding experts paid notice to him.

A hint of desperation appeared in his eyes.

Hum!!

Without any indication, the Space-time the Blood Thunder King was in complete stagnation and he entered a state of stagnation, losing the ability to resist.

Jian Wushuang crossed paths with Blood Thunder King and beheaded him with his cold sword light.

The Blood Thunder King had finally died!
