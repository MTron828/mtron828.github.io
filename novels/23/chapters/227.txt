Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Hearing what Jin Ling said, Jian Wushuang felt a little bit disappointed.

Between the Seven-colored Soul-seizing Vine and the Reversal Red Scorching Elixir, Jian Wushuang was inclined to the former.

Although his father needed to re-cultivate his Spirit Path after the Dantian got reconditioned by the Seven-colored Soul-seizing Vine, he had potential to keep enhancing his strength in the future.

Meanwhile, the Reversal Red Scorching Elixir Reversal Red Scorching Elixir was too extreme. Though it could help his father greatly enhance his strength, his potential would be greatly consumed. In the future, he wouldn’t be able to enhance himself further at all, which meant it would be impossible for him to be a top expert.

It was a shame that Jian Wushuang’s was unable to get him the Seven-colored Soul-seizing Vine due to his current level of authority.

“Then I’ll take the Reversal Red Scorching Elixir. Better than nothing. After I get my father out, I will give the Elixir to him. He will need to decide if he should take it,” said Jian Wushuang.

Jin Ling nodded slightly and said, “What about the remaining two items? What you want?”

“I want two Sword Skills. One applies to World Origin, and the other one applies to Slaughter Origin,” replied Jian Wushuang.

He had just comprehended World Origin and Slaughter Origin not long ago.

Having comprehended the Origin, he naturally needed the corresponding Original Sword Technique to perfectly display his Origin strength.

“It is easy to get a Sword Skill that applies to World Origin. The Selfless Sword Technique I gave you before is a kind of Original Sword Technique. And it is intended to be directed towards World Origin. However, you only have the first half of the volume, and now I will give the second half of the volume to you. What do you think?” Jin Ling said.

“That’s fine.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

He had been studying the Selfless Sword Technique. However, the best he could do so far was the third movement, Sky Isolating Form.

However, he knew clearly how fierce the Selfless Sword Technique had been a long time ago.

Previously he had succeeded in combining three sword essences, and then four sword essences, but neither could completely activate the real power of the Sword Skill.

The power of the Sword Skill could only be perfectly displayed by comprehending the Origin. What’s more, the Origin must be World Origin.

Even more, the first half volume of the Selfless Sword Technique contained six movements. It should be the same for the other half, so there would be a total of 12 swordsmanship types for the whole volume, which was plenty for Jian Wushuang to study.

“As for the Sword Skill that applies to Slaughter Origin...” Jin Ling frowned slightly.

“What’s wrong? You don’t have it?” Jian Wushuang asked with doubt.

“No, we have it. The problem is... we have too many,” Jin Ling replied.

“Too many?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Young man, you should know that the Bloodline of Sword Ancestor specializes in Sword Principle, and that the Sword Principle is a way of killing. The warriors who study the Sword Principle can only completely display their killing abilities by comprehending Slaughter Origin. Therefore, when the Bloodline of Sword Ancestor was at its peak, plenty of experts chose Slaughter Origin to comprehend!

“Sword Ancestor is an example. His best skill is Slaughter Origin!

“In the Bloodline of Sword Ancestor, a great number of experts chose to comprehend Slaughter Origin. That’s why the Sword Skills that apply to Slaughter Origin are more than that of other Origins. As per your current authority level, you can get more than a hundred Sword Skills that apply to Slaughter Origin.

“Let’s do it this way. I’ll give you a Sword Skill list, and you can take your time to pick one you want,” Jin Ling uttered while giving Jian Wushuang the list.

Jian Wushuang gave a glance at the list. Numerous Sword Skill names and their descriptions were immediately visible.

Jian Wushuang started to review them at once. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

In a second, he fixed his eyes on a Sword Skill.

Blood Emptying Technique.

It was a Sword Skill with extremely potent and monstrous power.

There were three sword movements for the Blood Emptying Technique, which was obviously too few compared to the Selfless Sword Technique, as there were 12 for the latter.

However, in terms of value, the Blood Emptying Technique was better than the Selfless Sword Technique.

“Though there are only three sword movements for the?Blood Emptying Technique, every movement was super powerful. What’s more, each movement is a killing move.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were shining.

Killing power was the most important characteristic to Slaughter Origin, so he should cultivate the Killing Move with that startling power, and get the best use out of it. That way, he could completely activate his killing power.

“I’ve decided. I’m going to choose the Blood Emptying Technique.” Jian Wushuang told her his decision.

“Blood Emptying Technique?” Jin Ling was surprised, but nodded.

A moment later, Jin Ling took out the three things that Jian Wushuang wanted.

They were Reversal Red Scorching Elixir, the other half of the volume of Selfless Sword Technique, and Blood Emptying Technique.

“I’ve given your first opportunity. As for the second one, you can stay in the Rainstorm Palace for a month.” Jin Ling gave Jian Wushuang a glance, and then continued, “Follow me.”

“Rainstorm Palace?” Jian Wushuang looked a little excited. Soon after, he moved his paces and followed Jin Ling.

He came to a corner in the Ancestor’s Land under the guidance of Jin Ling.

By then, what appeared in front of him was a huge mountain with a cave underneath.

“Is this cave the Rainstorm Palace?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes,” said Jin Ling, “Don’t look down on this cave. You will find the inside is amazing when you go in. But remember that you can only stay here for one month. How much strength you can enhance in this timeframe will depend on you.”

Jian Wushuang nodded continuously, and soon after stepped inside the cave.

The inside of the cave was enormous, and the entire cave was filled with a gloomy draft.

Jian Wushuang looked around carefully. Suddenly a huge painting that was surrounded by the gloomy draft was dimly visible.

“Painting?” Jian Wushuang was a little bit excited. At the same time, he was a little bit nervous.

He couldn’t see the painting clearly until he got closer.

This was a Rainstorm Picture.

The Rainstorm Picture was filled up by a large number of raindrops. Jian Wushuang counted them carefully and found the quantity was about 1,000.

“These raindrops...” Jian Wushuang couldn’t help looking at the raindrops carefully.

In Jian Wushuang’s eyes, the raindrops turned to a myriad of sword light. In a little while, they turned to numerous violent sword essences and flew to the Ninth Heaven.

With the perspective of World Origin, Jian Wushuang found that the sword light looked so miraculous, embracing everything in the heaven and earth, as if inside each of them was the core of the world.

Through the sword light, he even saw the scenes when he displayed the fourth, fifth and sixth movements of the Selfless Sword Technique...

However, with Slaughter Origin perspective, Jian Wushuang found that the sword light contained brutal killing essences. They seemed to be slashing, or hacking. All of them looked fierce and invincible.

Different Origins afforded him different scenes.

However, both ended up at the same point!

Jian Wushuang immersed himself in the raindrops. He couldn’t help pulling out the Triple-kill Sword from the back and then started to display the movements. He totally forgot the existence of time and himself.

The entire Rainstorm Palace was actually the Rainstorm Picture.

Furthermore, this Rainstorm Picture was aimed at the Origin.

In terms of value, the Rainstorm Picture was much better than the Sword Tomb where Jian Wushuang had stayed for two years.

His meditation at the Rainstorm Picture totally consumed Jian Wushuang, so much so that he didn’t notice how time flew at all.

“A month has passed, come out!”

Jin Ling suddenly shouted. She had been waiting outside the Rainstorm Palace the entire time.

“Come out! Come out! Come out!”

The shouting reverberated in Jian Wushuang head, and it got louder and louder. Finally, he woke up.

Soon after, Jian Wushuang bounded up and in no time landed outside the Rainstorm Palace.
