1950 Wushuang City Master Arrived

“Very well,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly while he put on a playful smile.

“Third Brother, what are you going to do?” Wang Yuan looked at him.

“What to do? Hehe, as Emperor God Xie Xin wants me to go and see him, I shall grant his wish,” Jian Wushuang sneered but his smile was as cold as a blade.

On that very day, Jian Wushuang departed from Wushuang City and came before the palaces floating outside Green Fire Palace.

In the palace right in the middle of the palaces.

The malicious looking Emperor God Xie Xin was sitting on a grand throne casually while the cultivator from Green Fire World stood below in reverence.

Most of the cultivators from Green Fire World had reached Real God level.

Then, there were a few Real Gods who were nodding and bowing with ingratiating smiles on their faces.

Previously, when Emperor God Xie Xin had barged into Green Fire Palace, he had suppressed the entire Green Fire Palace alone and also the nine top forces in Green Fire World. The news had spread like wildfire.

Naturally, it caught the attention of the experts who were suppressed by Green Fire Palace and the nine top forces. They had approached him to seek his backing.

Then, there were a bunch of people gathered under the command of Emperor God Xie Xin.

“Mister Emperor God, according to the news that I’ve gotten, the higher ups of the top nine forces are gathered at Green Fire Palace. I reckon they are thinking of countermeasures. Besides, there were experts from Green Fire Palace who requested Wushuang City Master to get involved,” a purple-haired elder reported politely.

“Hehe, Mister Emperor God, you don’t have to go through the trouble. You can totally wipe out Green Fire Palace directly, as well as the top nine forces. Then, build another brand new force to unite Green Fire World. Wouldn’t that be easier?”

“Yeah. Green Fire Palace and the nine top forces, although they could agree to yield to you because of fear towards your, I reckon it would only be temporary. They are not trustworthy.”

The few of them started commenting.

No matter if it was within an ordinary sect or force, there would be some traitors, let alone when they were in a big world.

The few Real Gods at the scene were traitors of Green Fire World.

They knew that Emperor God Xie Xin was an outsider, but they revolted and went to his side without hesitation for their own benefit.

Plus, they had been urging Emperor God Xie Xin to wipe out Green Fire Palace and the nine top forces.

Because the few of them most likely had been suppressed by Green Fire Palace and the nine top forces once. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

On the highest throne, Emperor God Xie Xin tapped the armrest with a malicious smile plastered across his face. “I want a complete Green Fire World. Just like how the current structure with Green Fire Palace and nine top forces are great. There’s no need to wipe them out. What I want to do now is to replace Wushuang City Master so that the cultivators in Green Fire World take me as the strongest person, treat me as a God. That’ll be enough.”

“Of course, if they don’t act wisely, they can’t blame me.”

The few Real Gods were unhappy but didn’t talk anymore.

Then, a figure in a black robe walked in and bowed at Emperor God Xie Xin, “Mister Emperor God, Wushuang City Master is here.”

“Oh?” Emperor God Xie Xin raised his eyebrows.

“Wushuang City Master!!”

The few Real Gods gasped a breath of cold air.

They were born in Green Fire World. They knew the legends about Wushuang City Master.

Wushuang City Master was totally a legend in Green Fire World.

Any single person couldn’t help but reveal reverence and worship when they bring up Wushuang City Master. Although the few Real Gods had already switched allegiance to Emperor God Xie Xin, they were still fearful of the legendary Wushuang City Master from the bottom of their hearts.

However, the moment they recalled Emperor God Xie Xin’s power, the few Real Gods felt reassured.

“Humph, at least Wushuang City Master is smart enough.”

“Of course, no matter how high his position is in Green Fire World, he is just a real God after all. How could he be compared to an Emperor God favorably?”

“From what I can see, Wushuang City Master is definitely panicking. He must be afraid that Mister Emperor God will kill him later!”

“What Wushuang City Master? He’s nothing before Mister Emperor God.”

The few Real Gods continued to praise him.

Emperor God Xie Xin sneered, “Wushuang City Master ain’t that dumb, let him wait outside for a bit.”

“Yes,” the man in the black robe who came to send the message turned to leave.

Outside the palaces, there were a few figures standing side by side. In Green Fire Palace that was not too far away, there were many higher-ups from Green Fire World who were paying attention.

The higher-ups from the nine top forces were standing there as they watched too.

Most of them were anxious.

Although Jian Wushuang had saved Green Fire World more than once and there was no doubt about his power, the cultivators in Green Fire World weren’t like before. They could tell that Jian Wushuang was only a Real God.

However, the outsider Emperor God Xie Xin was the legendary Almighty. It was said that the top of the pyramid in the outside world.

Between Real Gods and Almighties, the difference was ridiculously huge.

Hence, although they were absolutely obliged to Jian Wushuang, they were still extremely worried.

“Mister Emperor God tell you to wait here!”

The man in a black robe who had come to send the message was arrogant. He was unprecedentedly excited too because he knew that those standing before him were the expert higher-ups from Green Fire World and also the legendary Wushuang City Master.

To block Wushuang City Master outside the door and make him wait, he had never thought about it before.

“He wants us to wait here? The b*stard!” Wang Yuan immediately cursed with anger.

“No hurry. As he wants to put on airs, I will let him do it. I wonder how is he going to end this later?” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly but didn’t care much.

Qiu Yue who was next to Jian Wushuang shook her head slightly. She started to pity Emperor God Xie Xin, who didn’t know how high the sky was.

Jian Wushuang didn’t wait for long.

There was finally movement among the palaces.

Emperor God Xie Xin flew over with a few Real Gods surrounding him.

Rumble. There was vast divine might spreading out from Emperor God Xie Xin as he pressed the earth.

He had yet to arrive but his voice reverberated through the universe.

“Among you, who is Wushuang City Master?”

Emperor God Xie Xin’s voice was cold with a tinge of a high and mighty aura.

He put his hands behind his back as he stood in the void above. He surveyed everyone beneath him. He came before Jian Wushuang but he didn’t bother to look at Jian Wushuang.

He heard from the Real God under his command that Wushuang City Master was only a Real God.

Just a Real God wasn’t worth him taking a look at.
