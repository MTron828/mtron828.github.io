1933 The Promise

Jian Wushuang was raging with anger.

“Yes,” He Xin immediately took his order.

The deacon elders in the hall exchanged a look and they were shocked.

It was merely fought among the disciples and their disciples had suffered a minor loss. It was a trivial matter. But in the end, Jian Wushuang ordered He Xin to bring four Dao soldiers and wipe out the two branches of Real Martial Art Divine Church.

It was obvious that he had made a mountain out of a molehill.

However, when they saw the cold expressions of the three Hall Masters, they immediately understood.

It was obvious that Jian Wushuang and the other three Hall Masters had intentionally made a mountain out of a molehill.

They also understood the reason behind it.

Real Martial Art Divine Church was one of the five forces in Star Extermination Alliance. They had nearly cornered Lineage of Star to death.

Even though because of Sanctuary Alliance, Lineage of Star had agreed to stop meddling with the two alliances, the hatred was still there.

Lineage of Star definitely had the upper hand. Even though he couldn’t start a war, he had seized the chance to take revenge.

For instance, it was just a trivial matter but it was enough to become Lineage of Star’s excuse.

They wanted to look for an opportunity to deal with Real Martial Art Divine Church.

They weren’t afraid that Real Martial Art Divine Church would take revenge either. They even wished for Real Martial Art Divine Church to counter-attack.

The moment Real Martial Art Divine Church counter-attacked or they had the guts to take revenge, Lineage of Star had no scruples and would pound at them. By then, even Sanctuary Alliance couldn’t say much. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

As for what happened next…

He Xiu rushed to Dragon Fire Land in East Royal Sanctuary and wiped out the two branches of Real Martial Art Divine Church with thunderous measures.

After that, He Xin intentionally stayed back in Dragon Fire Land for a while as Jian Wushuang instructed. He waited for Real Martial Art Divine Church to find trouble in him.

However, Real Martial Art Divine Church knew Lineage of Star’s goal. Not only didn’t they counter-attack, they also apologized to Lineage of Star. Then, it ended.

The forces in Sanctuary Alliance found out about it and sighed.

Everyone could tell that Lineage of Star was making a mountain out of a molehill. They had intentionally picked on them.

Plus, Lineage of Star had even wiped out the two branches of Real Martial Art Divine Church and killed many disciples of Real Martial Art Divine Church. But in the end, it was the Master of Real Martial Art Divine Church who apologized.

“Sigh, they are not as powerful!”

“It was merely a fight among the juniors. Isn’t Lineage of Star behaving too barbarically?”

“Barbaric? Are you dumb? Lineage of Star isn’t dumb but that derived from resentment. To your enemy, who is willing to let the opportunity slip? I think Lineage of Star isn’t overboard. If I were him, I’d definitely do the same.”

“Yeah, Lineage of Star is only barbaric to the forces from the two alliances. To forces and experts that share no resentment, they are rather peaceful.”

“The Real Martial Art Divine Church asked for it as well. The forces from the two alliances, besides Abysmal Palace that has a Great Emperor attending garrison duty, which other forces aren’t worried about Lineage of Star? Real Martial Art Divine Church bullied the junior by sending a Real God expert to attack the Universe God disciple of Lineage of Star personally. Isn’t this courting death?”

All of the forces in Sanctuary Alliance was laughing about it.

In the end, no one thought Lineage of Star was behaving ridiculously but on the contrary, they found it right and proper.

As for the barbaric stories of Lineage of Star, it was obviously unbelievable.

After all, Lineage of Star was only barbaric towards the other enemies. Once they had found an opportunity or excuse, they would pound without hesitation.

To the other forces and sects, they were peaceful. Both parties would sit down and talk about it if it were a trivial matter.

In the blink of an eye, two hundred years had passed.

Lineage of Star had finally settled down. The forces that formed the two alliances back then had seen what had happened to the Real Martial Art Divine Church and they had learned their lesson. They held scruples with Lineage of Star. When they had come across any expert or disciple from Lineage of Star, they’d hide far away. If they were to cross paths,?they’d hold back as much as they could and not let Lineage of Star stand any chance to take revenge.

Then, Jian Wushuang had already left Lineage of Star and arrived at an ordinary Holy Kingdom.

The name of the Holy Kingdom was Holy Kingdom of Demon Heart!

The ancient silver spaceship shuttled through the dark void. In no time, there was a floating land.

“There’s the old lair of Holy Kingdom of Demon Heart?” Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes.

The King of Holy Kingdom of Demon Heart… was a Sir God expert that was powerful.

Of course, a Sir God was nothing before Jian Wushuang.

The purpose of Jian Wushuang’s trip was to kill him.

In the dim, secret room, there was a scrawny elder in black. He was cultivating.

He was King Demon Heart.

He was also the King of Holy Kingdom of Demon Heart. Over the years, he had ruled the surrounding Holy Kingdoms and he had a powerful background. Hence, he could march over Eternal Chaotic World unhindered. There was almost no one who dared to provoke him. He could be said to be a very relaxed and powerful figure.

In his name, there was the word “Demon”. His disposition was naturally very vicious.

Legend said that the surrounding dozens of Holy Kingdoms would send a bunch of beautiful ladies to his old lair and they were all virgins. At least thousands of people and at most tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people. But there was no one who walked out from his old lair.

One day.

Vroom!!

There was a sudden shake of prohibition that covered the secret room.

“Huh?”

King Demon Heart, who was sitting there with his eyes closed, suddenly opened his eyes.

“Who is it?” King Demon Heart’s voice reverberated in the secret room.

Swoosh!

There was a figure that appeared in front of him from nowhere.

“Real God?” King Demon Heart was surprised and he already knew who the incomer was.

“I see. Sword Emperor came personally, greetings,” King Demon Heart bowed slightly at Jian Wushuang. Then, he smiled and said, “Sword Emperor came today. I wonder what you have in mind. Whatever I can do, I’ll do it for you.”

“I came here today for one person, and also for a promise back then,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“A person? Promise?” King Demon Heart was confused.

“Real God Wu Bei. I wonder, does King Demon Heart remember him?” Jian Wushuang said.

“Wu Bei?” King Demon Heart’s face instantly changed and he could instantly guess the purpose of Jian Wushuang’s visit.

“The sixth step of inverse cultivation skill was obtained from Real God Wu Bei. Back then, I promised him that I would kill you on his behalf when I had the power to. Today, I came to carry out my promise,” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were glistening as he raised his right hand.

“Sword Emperor, I am Great Emperor Zi Xu’s man. Great Emperor Zi Xu owes me a favor,” King Demon Heart said.

“Oh, yeah?” Jian Wushuang’s voice was cold but there was no pause in his actions.

He knew about King Demon Heart’s background. As he dared to attack that day, he naturally had no scruples.
