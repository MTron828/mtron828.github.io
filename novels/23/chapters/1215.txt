Chapter 1216: The First Triumph

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Too sudden!”

“Everything happened too quickly!”

The sudden change had caught plenty of experts of the Jin Kingdom stunned, and there was no time for them to react.

But the tide of the battle had greatly shifted.

The experts of the Jin Kingdom were all trapped within the Jiu You domain.

The eighteen streams of the Divine Rays of the North shone instantly and wounded the experts of the Jin Kingdom.

Noticing their cue, the Palace Masters and Holy Masters sprang into action, throwing themselves at their quarries like pouncing predators.

The forces of the Jin Kingdom had been pursuing those from the Green Fire World earlier. This had brought them into the range of barely thousands of kilometers from the Battle Fortress, allowing the ambushing Masters to rain death upon them in such a short distance.

Jian Wushuang joined hands with the Gu King, unleashing the same technique again.

It was a total annihilation of the experts of the Jin Kingdom!

“Retaliation!”

“Get back at them immediately!”

“Kill them all! Slay them all! Spare no quarter!”

The experts of the Green Fire World who formerly had been routed turned back and mount a deadly reprisal.

The ambush had confounded most of the Holy Masters of the Jin Kingdom. Without even realizing that the tables have been turned, many of them lost their lives by the Green Fire World experts’ tide of vengeance.

Some who had been fortunate to survive the first wave of onslaught were only catching their breath when the Green Fire World’s experts fighting back had surprised them.

They were earlier defeated, routed by them.

But all of the sudden, how the tides of the battle directly changed!

“Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!”

The cacophony of the destruction and carnage thundered across the battlefield. The experts of the Jin Kingdom had lost a third of their number in just a simple confrontation.

With the enhancement effects of the Jiu You domain and the Divine Rays of the North, the host of the Green Fire World continued pushing ahead the wave of death, the merciless onslaught of butchery spreading towards the survivors whose will to fight immediately smothered.

“Damn! It is a trap!”

“It is an ambush set by the Green Fire World!”

“Retreat! Retreat at once!”

The Hong Xue King sounded his retreat, while his livid roars could be clearly heard from afar.

The survivors of the ambush retreated frantically. It was apparent that they had fallen face-first into the ambush nicely set by the Green Fire World.

The Green Fire World had divided part of their forces, concealing the bulk of them whilst using only the splintered group as decoys to lure their enemies closer to the Battle Fortress. When the enemies had come near, the experts and the Masters sprung their trap, delivering a swift and deadly blow into swiftly to defeat their enemies.

“Damn! From whence did the experts of the Green Fire World come from actually?” The Hong Xue King could hardly suppress his anger.

He knew full well the powers and effects of the Jiu You Realm and the Divine Rays of the North. But he had hardly anticipated that the experts of the Green Fire World had wielded such strength and valor.

“How was it possible that the Green Fire World had birthed more than 10 Universe Masters and more than a thousand Holy Masters in just a span of eight decades?”

“We’ve lost!”

“The Jin Kingdom has utterly lost!”

It was now the armies of the Green Fire World who were now slaughtering and butchering what was left of the Jin Kingdom’s armies.

What had been a thrashing of the armies of the Green Fire World by the experts of the Jin Kingdom had instead turned out to be a total rout of the latter by the former.

A good many of the experts of the Jin Kingdom had not been able to escape the grim fate of death that awaited them in the complete annihilation of the forces of the Jin Kingdom.

Just then…

“What’s this?”

The Samsara Temple Master, who was also at the battlefield, felt a sudden tingle to his senses. He looked far away in the distant and saw a great number of experts pouring out from the ancient spaceship at the farthest distance. The experts swarmed in a huge pack, racing speedily towards them.

“Halt! Hold your horses!”

The Samsara Temple Master commanded out aloud.

Despite feeling displeased to be deprived of their chance to further exact retribution, the experts of the Green Fire World nevertheless relented to the will of their leader and promptly stopped.

“Let us retreat.”

With a wave of his arm, the Samsara Temple Master beckoned to his men. The experts of the Green Fire World immediately fell back and returned into the hold of the Battle Fortress.

The reinforcements of the Jin Kingdom swiftly joined up with the survivors of the ambush and escorted them back to their spaceship.

This brought down the curtains for the first confrontation of the war between the Green Fire World and the Jin Kingdom.

Within the holds of the Battle Fortress

“We’ve won!”

“A huge victory!”

“We have claimed the win for the first battle!”

“Haha! The rest of the survivors would have also perished if not for the timely appearance of their reinforcements!”

Savage yells and jubilant howls of celebration could be heard everywhere in the Battle Fortress.

The Green Fire World had indeed claimed first blood in their first battle.

It was not only a victory, but a complete rout of their foes!

The Palace Masters huddled together in revelry.

“This is exciting! It has been quite some time since I have enjoyed such exhilaration!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Hahaha! The scoundrels from the Jin Kingdom have underestimated our forces, allowing us to mount an ambush which had crippled their legions with only one strike!”

“It was all thanks to the impeccable battleplans and strategies drawn up for this battle. Much of the credit should also go to Palace Master Wushuang!”

“Indeed. The two Sonic Wave Attacks performed by Palace Master Wushuang and his worm beast have thrown the enemies into confusion, buying us two precious opportunities to launch critical assaults on to them. Moreover, his triumph against King Longxu has greatly lifted the morale of our armies!”

“There would not be such a great victory without Palace Master Wushuang.”

The Palace Masters continued their hearty discussions about their win.

Elsewhere, Jian Wushuang himself stayed with the Samsara Temple Master and the Void Temple Master.

“This is the first in five million years that the Green Fire World has achieved victory against the forces of the Jin Kingdom.” The Samsara Temple Master mused as he laughed, “But even in our last victory five million years ago, we won the gritty battle only because of the Battle Fortress. This time, we have won. Even against the main force of the legions of the Jin Kingdom.”

Standing together, Jian Wushuang, the Void Temple Master, the Sunrise Sword Emperor, and Red Lotus all shared a smile.

“Then again, there is hardly any margin for hubris and arrogance. This is only the first confrontation. While this could be only a test by the forces of the Jin Kingdom, we have shown them the full extent of our might. The victory itself, was secured by the use of strategy and deception. It is still a fact that the Jin Kingdom still has strengths greater than us.” The Samsara Temple Master continued.

Jian Wushuang and the others nodded in agreement.

They would hardly be proud with only a win.

It was no secret to them that this was merely a test by the forces of the Jin Kingdom.

This could well be proven by the fact that the Monarch of the Jin Kingdom’s absence from the battlefield.

“Masters.” The Tang Emperor appeared out of the thin air.

“You have a count of our casualties?” The Samsara Temple Master looked at him inquiringly.

“That is so.” The Tang Emperor nodded grimly.

Noticing his expression, Jian Wushuang and the others instantly understood that he had come bearing ill news.

“How was it?” The Samsara Temple Master pressed.

“We may have won the battle. But at the cost of terrible losses.” The Tang Emperor explained.
