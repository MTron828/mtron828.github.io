Chapter 1631: Old Friend

The stocky old man started to gather information in Gu King City at once.

In no time, he had obtained reliable information.

“A hundred and fifty years ago, there was indeed a person known as Gu Jian who had cleared the sixth level of the Star Moon Tower. He was a Mixed Bloodline between human beings and Ancient Gods.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Moreover, when he registered for the Ancient God Palace’s assessment, he indeed said that he was under King Gu Tong!”

The stocky old man and the Five-star Ancient God met up and their expressions were extremely grave.

“There are two possibilities. Firstly, he is indeed the clansman of our king. Even if he is not, he is definitely related to the lineage of our king.”

“Secondly, he heard the name of our king by coincidence. Thus, he blurted it out. However, it is purely for the purpose of the Ancient God Palace’s assessment!”

“No matter which possibility is correct, since it is related to our king, I have to think of a way to meet him.”

The stocky old man clenched both his fists tightly and he had made up his mind. With that, he headed to the Ancient God Palace immediately.

Atop a martial arts training ground in the Ancient God Palace.

Two giant Ancient Gods were having an intense battle.

The bodies of the two Ancient Gods were over a hundred feet tall. One of them was glowing with golden light and he had already revealed three heads and six arms at that very moment.

As for the other Ancient God, his whole body was covered with a dark golden light. Similarly, he had three heads and six arms. Moreover, one of his six arms was holding a longsword tightly.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

The two Ancient Gods were having a close-quarters battle. As they clashed again and again, strong Ancient God Power was released madly.

However, at that very moment, the body of the dark golden Ancient God shook. Although he had originally had three heads and six arms, he underwent a transformation to become four heads and eight arms instantly.

With an additional head and two more arms, he could unleash more kinds of attack.

The Gold-armored Ancient God, who still had three heads and six arms, could no longer block the attacks and he was defeated quickly.

When everything had calmed down, the two Ancient Gods changed back to their human forms.

“Gu Jian, your speed of improvement is too frightening. You are a Five-star Ancient God. Moreover, you are actually able to unleash four heads and eight arms even though you have only grasped this Unique Skill for a short amount of time. Although I obtained this Unique Skill more than five hundred years ago, up until now, I have only been able to unleash three heads and six arms. In addition, I am also a Six-star Ancient God,” the defeated Ancient God forced a smile.

After hearing what was said, Jian Wushuang grinned.

He was a Royal Ancient God. In terms of Bloodline, he had a huge advantage. In addition, he was extremely talented and his rate of growth was fast as well.

In just a short hundred and twenty years’ time, he had used the Four Unique Skills until he was very familiar with it. Take the Secret Skill”Nine Heads Eighteen Arms”as an example. At that very moment, he could use Four Heads Eight Arms proficiently. In addition, he was able to use the different kinds of attack beautifully.

Just then, a figure came over from afar.

“Lord Gu Jian.”

The person who came was a top Five-star Ancient God. Logically was at the same level as Jian Wushuang. However, at that very moment, he addressed Jian Wushuang respectfully as Lord.

“Do you have anything for me?” Jian Wushuang looked at him.

“Someone has come to the palace and he is currently outside. In addition, he claims that he is a clansman of King Gu Tong’s lineage and he wishes to see you,” the Ancient God said respectfully.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed at once.

During the period of time where he was in the Ancient God Palace, he had asked some Ancient Gods about King Gu Tong’s lineage as well.

The answer he had gotten was that there was indeed a King Gu Tong in the Gu King City in the past. However, at that moment, he was no longer in the Gu King City and it also seemed that he had been gone since a very long time ago.

Thus, Jian Wushuang thought that perhaps King Gu Tong had not returned yet.

However, at that moment…

“I will go and take a look.”

Jian Wushuang walked toward the outside of the palace at once.

After arriving outside the palace, he saw the stocky old man who was waiting quietly at one side straight away.

“Elder Yi?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes brightened up immediately.

“You are…” Elder Yi also looked toward Jian Wushuang. At the start, he revealed a surprised expression. However, he opened his eyes wide after that. “You are Jian Wushuang? That little kid from back then who awakened a portion of the Royal Bloodline?”

“Haha. Elder Yi, long time no see,” Jian Wushuang laughed and walked over.

Elder Yi… He was the first Three-star Ancient God who Jian Wushuang had seen!

Back then in the Firmament Territory of the Green Fire World, during the hundred years’ time where he had lived with the Ancient God Clan within the Eternal Zone, the strongest Ancient God who he saw was Elder Yi. Hence, he had a strong impression of Elder Yi.

It should be known that to Jian Wushuang back then, a Three-star Ancient God was a super existence.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang realized that Elder Yi had become a Five-star Ancient God. Moreover, he was a top Five-star Ancient God and they were similar in terms of realm.

“Jian Wushuang, it’s really you?” Elder Yi still found it a bit unbelievable.

“Of course it’s me. Let’s go somewhere else and have a nice chat,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

Elder Yi nodded his head. He also knew that they were not at a good place to talk.

In no time, the two of them came to a secret room which was by itself. After Jian Wushuang laid a seal, the two of them started to have a conversation.

“Jian Wushuang, back then, you left so suddenly. You only left behind some words saying that you would return within thousands of years. However, tens of thousands of years have passed already,” Elder Yi wore a smile.

“I had no choice,” Jian Wushuang forced a smile, “Elder Yi, to tell you the truth, I do not just possess the Ancient God Bloodline. I am also a human cultivator. Previously, I had never come into contact with the Ancient God Clan. However, after I awakened the Ancient God Bloodline, I naturally needed to leave. Originally, I wanted to wait until I got stronger before returning to the Eternal Zone to help all of you open up a Sanctuary. However, who would expect that when I returned, the Eternal Zone would have already disappeared?”

“Is that so?” Elder Yi nodded his head as he could understand as well.

“Oh right. Elder Yi, the reason why the Eternal Zone disappeared was because of the return of your king, right?” Jian Wushuang asked. Of course, he still asked even though he knew the answer.

He had already known that the Eternal Zone was taken away by King Gu Tong.

“That’s right. Not long after you left, the king returned. He brought us along and returned to the Ancient God Sanctuary. Now, the clansmen of our king’s lineage have formed a tribe outside the Gu King City,” Elder Yi said.

“A tribe?” Jian Wushuang frowned, “Why didn’t you enter Gu King City?”

According to what he knew, King Gu Tong was a top Seven-star Royal Ancient God. If he were in his peak, he would definitely not be weaker than King Gu Yi and he might even be stronger. Moreover, he was a Royal Ancient God with the surname Gu. Hence, he could totally bring the clansmen under him into Gu King City and occupy a piece of land.

“Our king experienced a great change and his abilities had deteriorated greatly. Up until now, he had still not recovered fully. Moreover, he seemed to have some disputes with the current ruler of the Gu King City. As such, we are unable to enter the Gu King City,” Elder Yi said.

“Something like this actually happened?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“In actual fact, I came to the Gu King City this time around as I wanted to widen the knowledge of some kids. At the same time, I intended to bring back some items that the tribe needs. However, in the middle of doing so, I heard some people talking about you and I rushed over. Who would have expected that the person who cleared the sixth level of the Star Moon Tower a hundred and fifty years ago was actually you?” Elder Yi gasped.
