Chapter 959: That’s Impossible!!!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“An endless stretch of land is divided into Nine Provinces.

“The mountains and rivers as my palms, and Nine Provinces as seals, creating a world!”

Jian Wushuang activated the powerful Mountain River Map!

He had received three treasures from Xuan Yi, and this map was the third and most precious one among the three.

The map depicted a vast stretch of land. It was divided into nine provinces, each containing a magical seal. To master the art of using this magical map, one had to learn a Secret Skill called Nine-province Seal.

Jian Wushuang had acquired this treasure shortly before the Selection Ceremony and spent three years studying this map and the Secret Skill before barely mastering the First Move of the skill.

At that time, however, he had been unable to put that move into use since he did not have enough powers to activate the map.

After all, it would consume a huge amount of Spiritual Power to use a “seal” on the map.

It would consume even more power than Jian Wushuang’s Ninth-heaven Sword Formation and Three Fingers of the Ancient God would.

The reason he was able to use this move now was that he had absorbed all the remaining Essence Blood of King Luo Zhen, which had given him the top-notch Six-star Ancient God Power.

The First Move of Nine-province Seal used Qing Province on the map as the “Seal”.

Its actual name was Sky-splitting Seal.

“Split the heavens!”

Jian Wushuang shouted, and then a vast continent emerged out of the map. At this moment, both the heavens and the earth were roaring, and all living creatures could not help shuddering.

Trillions of living creatures in the 36 prefectures within Tang of the East seemed to feel the emergence of the continent. They were thrilled and began screaming in anger!

Jian Wushuang had never been so determined, and his killing intent had never been this strong. Also, he had never used such a mighty move before.

He was now fighting for trillions of living creatures in Tang of the East, who were longing for life.

They were filled with raging indignation and desperately wanted to kill Dao Yuanzi.

They pinned their hope on this magical continent.

In an instant, the continent of Qing Province pressed down on the defensive cover created by Dao Yuanzi with enormous ferocity.

“Boom—” The brutal force began to twist the space, and the surrounding space quickly shattered into pieces.

As the force expanded on the battlefield, the by-standers were compelled to withdraw, leaving only Jian Wushuang and Dao Yuanzi on it.

While the Ancient God Power was rapidly rushing to Jian Wushuang’s palms to increase the powers of the Qing Province Seal, his eyes and palms became red, and his face was crazily twisted.

“Humph, even if you were a Six-star Ancient God, you would never be able to destroy our Blood Killing Sect’s Life Devouring Formation. It’s complete now, you can never break it!” Dao Yuanzi shouted loudly and assertively under his defensive cover.

Life Devouring Formation was the most evil formation of the Blood Killing Sect.

Its powers were remarkable.

It was indeed impossible for Jian Wushuang to demolish it with just the top-notch Six-star Ancient God Power.

“Hah-hah, It’s useless!

“No one can stop me from nourishing my Blood Killing Demon Body with the vitality of living creatures in Tang of the East.

“No one can stop me!”

As Dao Yuanzi snarled wildly under his defensive cover, the light of the cover got increasingly bright and glaring.

“No one can stop you?

“Now, watch this!”

Jian Wushuang said, his voice sounded like thunder. It covered all the other sounds between earth and sky and was transmitted directly into the ears of Dao Yuanzi.

In the meantime, the vast continent of Qing Province pressed even harder on Dao Yuanzi’s protective cover.

The powers of this “Seal” finally surged to their highest level.

“Crack!”

Although it was just a slight cracking sound, it still quickly caught the attention of the by-standers.

The next moment, they burst into hysterics and could not help cheering.

Upon hearing the cracking sound, Dao Yuanzi was frightened to death!

“That’s impossible!

“That’s impossible!!!”

Dao Yuanzi shouted loudly and desperately, disbelief evident in his eyes. He had never appeared so scared and panicked since he had begun his cultivation.

He couldn’t believe what had happened.

“How come a person who’s barely able to wield the Six-star Ancient God battle strength with the aid of an external force could crack my 36 Diabolic Pillars and my Life Devouring Formation?

“This is impossible. This is impossible... unless...”

Dao Yuanzi thought and then suddenly lifted up his head to look at the world map in the sky.

“This world map looks incredibly fascinating. Is there anything special about it?

“Its aura seems quite antique and sophisticated. Is it a...” Dao Yuanzi wondered.

The next moment, he could not help but voice his thought. “A Chaos Divine Treasure!

“This world map is a Chaos Divine Treasure!

“How is this possible!!!!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Dao Yuanzi shouted as if he was going mad. In his eyes, the entire world now looked unbelievably crazy.

“That’s impossible! That’s impossible!!

“No one in this Realm can own a Chaos Divine Treasure!”

He shouted furiously, his heart and his whole body shaking violently with fear.

He was confident that Jian Wushuang would never be able to demolish his Life Devouring Formation with the Six-star Ancient God battle strength. Nevertheless, he had never expected that the boy had a Chaos Divine Treasure.

This Chaos Divine Treasure was even more powerful than his own Blood-killing Plate Armor.

As far as he knew, no one in this Realm was able to own such a high-level treasure, which was rare in this universe.

However, Jian Wushuang showed him such a treasure.

“Crack—”

Cracks began to appear in many parts of his defensive cover, which meant that it was already on the verge of collapse.

“No!” Dao Yuanzi shouted in horror.

Nevertheless, the defensive cover did not follow his instructions anymore. With a loud, crisp cracking sound, it shattered into pieces, leaving him unprotected.

“Go to hell!” Jian Wushuang shouted loudly.

The vast continent of Qing Province pressed down on Dao Yuanzi with great ferocity, smashing all his bones to pieces.

“I’ll never reconcile!

“Never reconcile!!!!”

Dao Yuanzi shrieked frantically toward the sky.

A moment later, he was pressed deep into the ground by the continent of Qing Province.

Thus this fight left a huge sinkhole on the battlefield, whose diameter was several thousand kilometers.

When the continent of Qing Province dispersed in the space, there were absolutely no signs of life at the bottom of the sinkhole.

Jian Wushuang stood on the vast battlefield, alone.

Everyone and everything between earth and sky were silent.
