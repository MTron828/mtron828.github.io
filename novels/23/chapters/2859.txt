Chapter 2860: Ranked Third on the Dragon-Phoenix List

——

After the name, there was an introduction to the Ancient Saint’s deeds.

The introduction was also very simple.

“Ancient Saint, the founder of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, rose up in the wilderness and established the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion by great means and laid the foundation for thousands of generations!”

The simple introduction made everyone present respect him.

“So he is the founder of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. No wonder he is ranked first on the Dragon-phoenix list.” Jian Wushuang sighed.

He also knew that the ranking of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion was determined by its contribution to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

The Ancient Saint created the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion from scratch and established the foundation of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion for thousands of generations. Of course, he could be ranked first on the Dragon-phoenix list.

After the ancient sage, the second on the Dragon-phoenix list was the third pavilion master of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

According to the introduction on the Dragon-phoenix list, after the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion had a certain foundation, the Ancient Saint went to the third heaven to explore. There was no news of his whereabouts. Although the second Pavilion Master was an extremely powerful undying sage, an accident happened because of him, the Pavilion Master fell immediately, and the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion encountered a great crisis as a result.

At this juncture, it was the third Pavilion Master who had single-handedly turned the tide and helped the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion tide over the crisis. As a result, he was ranked second on the Dragon-phoenix list.

Following that, he was ranked third, fourth, and finally eighth on the Dragon-phoenix list.

These eight people were all Immortal Saints and had made outstanding contributions to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

For example, the previous Pavilion Master of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and the current Pavilion Master, Long Xingzi, were also on the Dragon-phoenix list.

However, ordinary Immortal Saints, such as that Young Phoenix’s Master, Elder Qin, did not have many contributions, so they could not be listed on the Dragon-phoenix list.

Many experts present were also curious about this. Even his master, Elder Qin, was not qualified to be listed on the Dragon-phoenix list. What contribution did this Young Phoenix make to the Dragon-phoenix pavilion? How could she be qualified to be listed on the Dragon-phoenix list?

In the air, the Dragon-phoenix ranking had already been completely opened. The eight names and their deeds were recorded on the Dragon-phoenix ranking and displayed in front of everyone.

At this moment, Long Xingzi faintly smiled. Following this, his figure directly rushed forward.

He appeared in front of the huge Dragon-phoenix ranking. Immediately, he waved his finger, and divine power burst forth, a ninth name immediately appeared on the Dragon-phoenix ranking.

This name was Leng Er.

Leng Er was the name of the Young Phoenix.

However, what shocked all the experts present was the position where this name appeared.

One had to know that the Dragon-phoenix ranking board was ranked based on contributions to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. Whoever had greater contributions to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion would be ranked higher.

But now, Leng Er’s name appeared in the third position on the Dragon-phoenix ranking board!

Yes, she was in the third place, just behind the third Pavilion Master. She was even higher than the previous Pavilion Master of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and the current Pavilion Master, Long Xingzi!

“How… how is this possible?”

“Third place? She’s actually in the third place?”

“Are you kidding me? Although this Young Phoenix is extremely talented, she’s still only a Divine Master. It’s already incredible that she could be ranked on the Dragon-phoenix ranking. Now, she’s actually ranked third in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, just behind the Ancient Saints and the third Pavilion Master?”

The experts on the training ground were all at a loss. They did not understand why Long Xingzi would rank her like this.

One had to know that the ranking on the Dragon-phoenix list was directly proportional to their achievements. It was also absolutely convincing.

For example, Ancient Saint and the third Pavilion Master. One of them was the founder of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, while the other saved the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion at a critical moment. No one dared to question their ranking, but now, the Young Phoenix was ranked third, this made many people question.

“I would like to see just what kind of contribution this young Phoenix has made to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.”

Many gazes immediately turned to look at them.

Under normal circumstances, if Long Xingzi had written the name of the Young Phoenix on the Dragon-phoenix list, he should have written down some of the contributions she had made to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion as well. Only then would she be remembered by future generations. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

However, after Long Xingzi finished writing Leng Er’s name, he paused for a moment and then wrote two words at the back.

These two words were… opportunity!

“Opportunity?”

“Just these two words?”

“What opportunity? What on Earth is going on?”

The people on the martial arts practice field were all baffled. They did not know what Long Xingzi meant by leaving these two words.

However, some of the more intelligent people on the field slightly narrowed their brows. Most of them had already guessed something.

Jian Wushuang stood in the corner and his pupils constricted.

“It’s impossible for the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion to list Shuang Er on the Dragon-phoenix list for no reason, and she’s ranked third. Now that the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion has done so, it means that Shuang Er has indeed made outstanding achievements for the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. At the very least, it has benefited the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion greatly. However, due to some special reasons, it’s impossible to explain the reason, so Long Xingzi replaced it with the word ‘opportunity’.”

“In other words, Shuang Er must have gotten a great opportunity. She must have benefited the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion a lot!” Jian Wushuang murmured to himself.

In Jian Wushuang’s opinion, this was the biggest possibility.

However, he did not know what great opportunity Leng Rushuang had gotten.

In the void, Long Xingzi did not continue writing after he finished writing the word ‘opportunity’. Instead, he looked at Leng Rushuang.

“Leng Er, leave your life aura on the Dragon-phoenix list,” said Long Xingzi.

“Okay.” Leng Rushuang nodded slightly. She raised her hand slightly, and a unique life aura swept out and finally merged into the Dragon-phoenix list.

After doing all this, Long Xingzi slowly waved his hand and closed the Dragon-phoenix list again.

After it was closed, the Dragon-phoenix list once again disappeared into the spiral tunnel.

The world became quiet again.

“Is it over?”

“It’s over so soon?”

Many people on the martial arts practice field were stunned.

Of course, this was their first time attending the ceremony. In fact, the opening of the Dragon-phoenix rank was just a moment.

The purpose of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion was to enhance Leng Rushuang’s reputation. On the other hand, it was to let the other forces witness the ceremony. There was no other purpose. Now, the ceremony was over.

“Master, the ceremony has ended. This disciple will return first.” Leng Rushuang stood up, her voice was cold and indifferent.

“Yes.” Elder Qin nodded.

Leng Rushuang’s figure blurred, preparing to leave.

“Wait!”

A voice suddenly sounded. The person who had uttered this voice was surprisingly Young Master Qu.

He rushed out from the crowd and stopped in front of Leng Rushuang. He first bowed humbly, and then said gently, “Miss Leng Er, I am Qu Hong. Many years ago, you and I met once. I wonder if Miss Leng Er still remembers?”
