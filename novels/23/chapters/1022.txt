Chapter 1023: Kill Them All

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“There is no escape for anyone today!”

Jian Wushuang spat out the sentence with murderous undertone, and darted out like a ghost.

“Oh no!”

“Is this… a trap?”

“We’re trapped!”

Seeing the enchanted walls rising around them, all the Black Python Clansmen were stunned, especially Di Yan and Mo Lin.

They weren’t stupid; they knew that the enchantment was a trap.

But out of nowhere, the light of a powerful sword barrelled toward the Black Python Clansmen.

“Watch out!” Di Yan shouted.

Just in time, the clansmen sensed the attack and retreated.

But just as they turned around,

“Why am I so slow?”

“What has happened to me?”

To their surprise, they all discovered that they could no longer move at a normal pace and couldn’t dodge the sword’s blow. It was as if they had been chained down.

Without pause, a forceful conciousness attack landed upon them.

Inside the enchantment, all the Black Python Clan experts froze like a stone. They could only watch as Jian Wushuang’s sword struck them.

Swish!

The remorseless blade split through their bodies in an instant.

Back when he had only devised two Sword Principles, Jian Wushuang had managed to kill eight Dao Masters with the Death Shadow. But now, it was much easier for him to slay these Black Python Clan experts.

In a just a brief moment, all the clansmen had been eliminated except for Mo Lin and Di Yan.

“Bastard!”

Mo Lin’s eyes widened at the sight of the bloodshed.

The noble protectors of his people had all be slain by Jian Wushuang in the blink of an eye.

“You must die too.”

Relenting to his murderous rage, Jian Wushuang rushed at Molin and Diyan.

“Oh no!” Despair marked the faces of Di Yan and Mo Lin.

Also slowed down and trapped by the enchantment of the Chaos Gems, there was no path for them to escape.

“Stall him, it is not easy to maintain this enchantment.” Di Yan shouted.

Mo Lin nodded resolutely, and they joined forces in an attempt to stop Jian Wushuang.

“Break!”

Jian Wushuang brandished his Blood Mountain Sword.

The mighty blow melded together the power of his three Sword Principles.

Di Yan lifted his hand and used all of his strength.

Right beside him, Mo Lin waved a Giant Axe at Jian Wushuang savagely.

One versus two!

But then…

Bam!

Di Yan let out a grunt as he was forced backward, and Mo Lin spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Death Shadow!”

Jian Wushuang’s second move, the fast Death Shadow charged straight toward Mo Lin.

Too fast!

Not just fast, the blow was also filled with a consciousness attack.

Already injured, Mo Lin struggled to hold himself up and could do nothing to block the Death Shadow.

“No!”

Mo Lin screamed, but the sword didn’t slow down; it slashed through his neck.

Swish!

A human head fell.

The leader of the Black Python Clan, Mo Lin, was dead.

“Damn!”

“How is he so powerful?”

Di Yan’s hope died. He had expected Mo Lin to stop Jian Wushuang as the enchantment around the was so difficult to sustain.

He thought that if they could stall until the trap disappeared, they could run.

Never in his wildest dream did he expect that Mo Lin would be killed in the blink of an eye.

Jian Wushuang was far more capable than he thought.

“If he’s dead, then there is no hope for me.” Di Yan looked desperate because he saw rage flash in Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

A bloodthirsty aura shrouded Jian Wushuang.

It was so potent that Di Yan could almost touch it.

If they were anywhere, he would not have been so hopeless. But trapped in the enchantment and slower than normal, he could not fight Jian Wushuang.

“Dao Master Dreamless, please help me!”

Di Yan turned his face toward Dao Master Dreamless in the nearby Void. Desperation cracked his voice, “Please, I’ll remember your help forever.”

“Please!”

Di Yan was shouting at the top of his lungs.

But Dao Master Dreamless stayed motionless with his arms folded.

“I’ve told you. I only came to deal with Jian Wushuang. Since I failed, I won’t interfere anymore. This war between the Black Python Clan and Jian Wushuang is none of my business.” Dao Master Dreamless’s merciless voice rang.

“Bastard!” Di Yan cursed.

Jian Wushuang was now right in front of Di Yan.

“Die!”

Without any hesitation, the Blood Mountain Sword cut into Di Yan.

Di Yan was almost defenseless and after only three strikes, he was heavily injured.

Jian Wushuang kept attacking him. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Stop, Jian Wushuang! I’m begging you!” Di Yan cried.

“Now you’re begging me?” He just snorted and his barbaric expression didn’t change.

Jian Wushunag wanted to kill Di Yan more than he did the Black Python Clan.

Di Yan had caused him distress many a time, and Jian Wushuang hadn’t been strong enough to return the favor.

Now, he would not hesitate to kill him.

“No, you can’t!” Di Yan shrieked. “Jian Wushuang, my father is the Empyrean Patriarch, he’s the Empyrean Patriarch!”

“The Empyrean Patriarch?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes but did not stop. He just snorted again. “Who’s he? I’ve never heard of him.”

“You…” Di Yan was speechless. Before he could speak, a sword sliced into him.

And this time, he had no more words.
