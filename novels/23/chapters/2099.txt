“Thank goodness you’ve arrived, if not for you, I’m afraid my clan would have been annihilated by now. You have our gratitude. If you encounter any issues in the future, we will definitely come to your assistance.” The Black Dragon Emperor said, looking at Jian Wushuang with affection.

“I am the Special Tribes Alliance Chief after all, it is my duty to help you. No need for formalities.” Jian Wushuang smiled. He noticed how the Black Dragon Emperor was looking at him, but paid no attention to it.

“Hngh, the audacity of the Sky Swallowing Clan! To collude with the Archelon Palace, even attempting to wipe out the Black Dragon Clan!” the God Eater Clan leader mumbled.

“Their ambition does not end there. If my predictions are correct, Ba Su wanted to get rid of the Black Dragon Clan silently, then find an opportunity to get rid of the God Eaters. Finally, he’ll find the Ancient Gods. If his plan had succeeded, with the other Top three clans removed from the picture, who else would have dared to defy the Sky Swallowers?”

“By then, no clan would dare join the human Sanctuary Alliance in battle. The Three Emperors World would have won by then.”

The experts from both God Eater Clan and Black Dragon Clan looked at each other. They were chilled by what could have happened, but relieved it had not.

Luckily Jian Wushuang had seen through the Sky Swallowing Clan’s intentions from the beginning, allowing their plan to fall apart.

The experts from the Ancient God Clan all looked at Jian Wushuang with respect.

Especially King Chen Xing and King Zhan Cang.

They knew, the Sky Swallowing Clan had made no intention to attack the Black Dragons beforehand, but Jian Wushuang had derived that from the inactivity of the Black Dragons, and decisively led experts here personally.

This level of observation … King Zhan Cang and King Chen Xing were ashamed.

King Chen Xing had a newfound respect for Jian Wushuang.

“Even though the Sky Swallowing Clan has suffered its share of losses this time, their foundation remains. If they are not destroyed, what happened today will happen again,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Ancient Emperor, what you mean is…”

Black Dragon Emperor and the God Eater Clan leader looked towards Jian Wushuang.

“I suggest that the three clans unite against the Sky Swallowing Clan, uprooting them in the shortest time possible. Those clans that follow the Sky Swallowing Clan, like the Black Bone Clan… since the Sky Swallowers have decided to collude with the Archelon Palace, there is no doubt the rest have as well. If there is a need, we will remove them too.” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

Hearing this, the two leaders nodded.

The Sky Swallowing Clan had to be destroyed, that was for certain.

As for the other clans that followed, they would perish too.

“Seventy percent of my God Eater experts have followed us here to Black Dragon grounds, we are ready to strike against the Sky Swallowers,” the God Eater leader said.

“Even though my Black Dragon Clan has suffered huge losses – many Almighties have fallen – we still have enough fighting power. What’s left of us, myself included, are at your disposal.” The Black Dragon Emperor followed.

For the Black Dragon Clan, Jian Wushuang and the Ancient God Clan were now their saviours, especially after today.

Be it in gratitude or for revenge, they were all happy to join in the fight against the Sky Swallowing Clan.

“Very good,” Jian Wushuang smiled, and looked towards King Chen Xing. “Take more experts from our clan, and spread the news across the domain about today’s battle. The Sky Swallowing Clan have officially colluded with the Archelon Palace, and almost destroyed the Black Dragon Clan today. Now, the Black Dragon Clan, God Eater Clan, and Ancient Clan will join forces and uproot the treasonous Sky Swallowers!”

“During this period of time, any clan that dares stop us will be seen as colluding with the Sky Swallowers. They will all be cut down.”

“Understood,” King Chen Xing made his move and started spreading the word.

After that, the three Clans started to reorganise their remaining forces, and made their way towards the Sky Swallowing Clan’s lair.

…

A quiet void gathered the Sky Swallowers, the Archelon Palace, and Holocaust Sect experts. There were only a hundred-odd people.

Before the battle happened, the Sky Swallowers and Archelon Palace together had over two hundred experts, and an extra thirty from the Holocaust Sect. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

But now, there were just over a hundred.

They had lost more than half of their experts.

Even those that survived were in bad shape.

Ba Su, the eerie elder from the Archelon Palace, and experts of the Holocaust Sect had gathered.

“Indeed, the three clans led by the Ancient Emperor have reached our doorstep.” Ba Su’s face turned green. “Nine-tenths of my clan came to destroy the Black Dragons, but now only one-tenth remains. Even with the Protective Array, there is no way I can defend against them. We will lose our foundation.”

Hearing this, the Sky Swallowing experts trembled profusely.

After they had escaped from the Black Dragon Clan, Ba Su immediately transmitted a message to the remaining experts within the Sky Swallowing Clan, asking them to escape and hide.

But they were such a big clan. This maneuver could not be done in an instant.

And Jian Wushuang was so much faster. They were heading towards their lair almost right after they had pushed them back.

When Jian Wushuang and the others made their way into the lair, the Sky Swallowing Clan had only managed to move several hundred people. The remaining people did not stand a chance.

The three clans were not going to have any mercy upon the clan-hunting, bloodthirsty Sky Swallowers.

Add that to the fact that they defected towards the Archelon Palace, betraying the Special Tribes Alliance, and betraying the entire Eternal Chaotic World.

What good was there in keeping this clan around?
