Chapter 1085: One Hundred and Thirty-Nine

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Green Fire Palace was the gathering place for top experts in the Green Fire World.

It was named after the Green Fire World and only existed for it.

Following Celestial Master Yu Ding, Jian Wushuang passed through a vast, dark Void and also a number of complicated Formations. Finally, he came to the Green Fire Palace.

“Is this the Green Fire Palace?”

He looked forward and saw a land float quietly in the Void between two mountains.

It was a boundless land that was dotted with numerous rich decorated and splendid buildings.

The entire Green Fire Palace gave Jian Wushuang a feeling of great antiquity.

“The place where I am at now neither belongs to the Samsara Continent nor the Void Continent. It seems to be outside the Green Fire World. I didn’t expect the Green Fire Palace to be here!”?Jian Wushuang was surprised deep in his heart.

Beside him, Celestial Master Yu Ding glanced at him and said, “An expert in the Green Fire World found this land many years ago. It’s quite unique and many palaces have long existed here. Moreover, they cannot be destroyed.”

“Cannot be destroyed?” Jian Wushuang was astonished.

“The buildings, flowers, and trees here cannot be destroyed. Even if you destroy them, they will restore themselves immediately. In addition, that expert also discovered that the cultivation environment here is way better than that in the Green Fire World. We can receive much better effect if we cultivate here.” Celestial Master Yu Ding stated.

“It really has such a miraculous effect?” Jian Wushuang was taken aback.

Not only everything here had the self-repair function, but this place was also much suitable for cultivating.

It was indeed a good place.

“That’s the reason why we established the Green Fire Palace here.” Celestial Master Yu Ding smiled. “Follow me.”

The two moved toward that floating land.

When Jian Wushuang really set foot on this land, he immediately noticed the unique places of his surroundings.

The Heaven and Earth Spiritual Energy here was obviously denser than that in the Green Fire World.

Most importantly, as soon as he stepped on this land, he felt that he calmed down quickly and his mind relaxed.

If he cultivated in this state, he certainly could gain twice the result with half the effort.

“It’s really amazing.”?Jian Wushuang admired secretly.

“Jian Wushuang, since you newly join the Green Fire Palace, I’ll briefly introduce something about it to you.” Celestial Master Yu Ding added, “It exists only for the survival and interests of the Green Fire World.”

“Compared with the entire Eternal Chaotic World, our Green Fire World is too small. If our world wants to survive in the Eternal Chaotic World, our experts must unite. That’s why we established the Green Fire Palace.”

“Yeah.” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily.

He was aware of the responsibility that the member of the Green Fire World must take.

Though Empyrean Patriarch possessed a powerful strength, in order to enjoy life and freedom, he refused the invitation of the Green Fire Palace. Jian Wushuang was ashamed of such behavior.

“The Green Fire Palace has existed for many years and possessed a lot of experts till now. However, some of them died and some left. Thus, there are only numbered Celestial Masters here.” Celestial Master Yu Ding exclaimed.

“How many Celestial Masters are there now?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“If I count you in, there are a total of 139 Celestial Masters who still stay in the Green Fire World.”Celestial Master Yu Ding replied.

“139?” Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Celestial Masters were rarely seen in the Green Fire World!

Both in the Samsara Continent and the Void Continent, Celestial Masters were legendary beings.

Even those top forces only possessed few Celestial Masters.

The Ancient Monster Clan, known as the No.1 population on the Samsara Continent, only had three Celestial Masters.

Now, however, Celestial Master Yu Ding told him that there existed 139 Celestial Masters in the Green Fire Palace.

“Why are there so many Celestial Masters?” Jian Wushuang asked, doubtfully.

“Many? It’s very few.” Celestial Master Yu Ding shook his head and continued, “Jian Wushuang, you have become a rising star recently, thus, you don’t know much about the Green Fire World. Do you know how long the Green Fire World has existed?”

“This…” Jian Wushuang lost his tongue.

To him, 10,000 years was a long time. But to those old experts who had already reached the top, it was just a short moment.

He did not know how long had the Green Fire World existed, but in his opinion, it must have existed for 10 million years, at least.

“The Green Fire World has existed for more than 40 million years,” Celestial Master Yu Ding said, “This is quite a long time. But how many experts have appeared during this period?”

Jian Wushuang gasped in shock.

When a Warrior’s strength reached the Eternal Realm, he could live a long life which seemed to be eternal in ordinary people’s eyes. And when he became a Dao Master or Celestial Master, he could live much longer.

Unless being killed by someone else or suffering some natural crisis, Dao Masters and Celestial Masters would never die.

The number of experts that had been produced on the Void Continent and the Samsara Continent over the past 40 million years must be an astronomical figure. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Though I am unaware of the exact number, I assume there must be more than 500 Celestial Masters in the Green Fire World over the years. Some of them died and some left for the Eternal Chaotic World. Most of the rest chose to stay in the Green Fire Palace.” Celestial Master Yu Ding explained.

“Celestial Masters in the Green Fire Palace are mostly very old and have nothing to worry about. They are only interested in improving their strength. Therefore, they have been staying in the Green Fire Palace for a long time and seldom show up in the Green Fire World. As time passes by, the forces in the Green Fire World have long forgotten their existence.”

“I was well-known in the Green Fire World three million years ago, now, however, few people know me when my name is mentioned.”

Jian Wushuang understood that.

It was normal for people to forget those Celestial Masters if they always stayed in the Green Fire Palace without making an appearance.

“Jian Wushuang, look up at the two men.” Celestial Master Yu Ding gave Jian Wushuang a sign.

Jian Wushuang saw that in front of him, there were two old men, one in white and the other black, sitting cross-legged in front of a Chinese chessboard at the top of a pavilion. Without doubt they were playing chess.

As if they had perceived Jian Wushuang’s gaze, they took their eyes off the chessboard and looked at him.
