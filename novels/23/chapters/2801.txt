Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

“Jian Yi...”yin su’er stared at Jian wushuang with a complicated look.

“Why? Don’t you recognize me?”Jian wushuang smiled faintly.

“No, I just didn’t expect you to be so strong.”Yin Su’er exclaimed in surprise.

The surrounding experts nodded in unison.

Indeed, Jian Wushuang’s combat strength was too strong.

He had killed Palace Master Nan Wu and swept through all the experts of the Allied forces.

This strength... was not something an ordinary great divine master could have.

Only the legendary invincible divine master could have such a skill.

As for Jian wushuang, even if he was not as strong as the real invincible divine master, he was very close.

But don’t forget, the divine power aura emitted by Jian Wushuang was only that of a senior great divine master?

A senior great divine master had almost the combat strength of an invincible divine master?

“Secret skills, his secret skills are very impressive. At the same time, he also has countless trump cards...”Yin Su’er praised in her heart.

In this battle, Jian Wushuang had gone all out. He had indeed revealed too many tricks and trump cards.

All kinds of tricks and trump cards were emerging one after another, which amazed many experts present.

Many experts present were now curious about what kind of experience jian Wushuang had had, or what kind of amazing opportunities he had obtained.

They all knew that Jian wushuang could not have had so many tricks and trump cards without a great opportunity.

His combat strength would never have been so strong.

Jian wushuang smiled bitterly in his heart when he noticed the strange gazes around him.

After a long while, Jian wushuang exhaled and said, “In any case, today’s battle is finally over.”

“Yes, it’s over.”

The experts around them also heaved a sigh of relief, especially the remaining great divine masters of Yin Su’er’s camp, who were still smiling in surprise.

“We’ve won! We’ve won this battle! !”

“Not only have we won the internal battle within Crimson Rock Castle, we’ve also defeated the Allied forces of the Four Great Powers!”

“Although Crimson Rock Castle has suffered heavy losses in this battle and many great divine paragons have fallen, it won’t be long before we can reorganize and regroup. After today’s battle, our Crimson Rock Castle will definitely regain its prestige from many years ago!”! ! The Nangong Wugong, the Tower of life and death, the Divine Devil Sect, and the Dongfang family will once again submit to our Crimson Rock Castle.”

“This is too good.”

Voices filled with pleasant surprise reverberated in the air.

Beside them, Yun Shan and his two remaining high divine paragons had extremely complicated expressions on their faces.

It was indeed gratifying that the alliance of the Four Great Powers had been defeated. However, the faction they belonged to had similarly been defeated by Yin Su’er.

“Yun Shan.”

Yin Su’er’s voice rang out. She gave Yun Shan a deep look, after a long while, she continued, “The reason why I suddenly attacked you before was because I sensed that great divine god Tian Mu had close contact with the Nangong Wugong. Great Divine god Tian Mu was your subordinate and also your confidant. I subconsciously thought that you had fallen and wanted to collude with the Nangong Wugong to harm the red stone castle. I didn’t expect that great divine god Tian Mu had schemed against you!”

“This time, I have misunderstood you. I apologize.”

Yin Su’er’s voice was extremely sincere.

For so many years, she and Yun Shan had been fighting in the open and in the dark, and they were extremely fierce.

But no matter how much they fought, yin su’er recognized Yun Shan’s strength and ability.

In addition, Yun Shan had founded Crimson Rock Castle with Redstone Saint, and they had fought together to conquer the world.

Crimson Rock Saint had 50% of the credit for Crimson Rock Fort’s complete control of a realm, while Yun Shan had at least 30% . Yin Su’er had never denied Yun Shan’s achievements. Therefore, she still had a trace of respect for Yun Shan from the bottom of her heart. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Previously, if she hadn’t been schemed by great divine god Tian Mu and thought that Yun Shan had colluded with the South Wugong, she would never have directly launched a great war against Yun Shan in this manner.

And just now, after being ambushed by her camp and being heavily injured, Yun Shan was still able to put the overall situation first and take the initiative to join hands with her to fight against the Allied forces of the four major forces. This made Yin Su’er extremely gratified and moved.

So now that the Great War had ended, Yin Su’er also took the initiative to apologize to Yun Shan.

“This matter, this old man does not know people well. Being schemed against by others is also this old man’s own fault.”Yun Shan said, “The winner takes all. This battle, this old man has lost. From today onwards, the Crimson Rock Castle will absolutely respect you, Lord Castle Lord. If Lord Castle Lord has any demolition in the future, i, Yun Shan, will not say a word of No.”

Yun Shan’s voice was equally sincere.

Previously, the reason why he was unconvinced of Yin Su’er and fought with her was because he doubted her methods.

He believed that Yin Su’er lacked experience and wisdom, so she was not suitable to control this huge red stone castle.

However, after all these years of competition, Yun Shan had witnessed Yin Su’er’s growth and her methods.

Especially in this battle, he was completely convinced.

The strength that Yin Su’er had accumulated in a short period of time, and the fact that she had secretly recruited several other small factions, as well as bribed the experts from the White Cloud Mansion, the demon sealing hall, and the Eclipse Gate, these three first-rate forces, as backup plans, especially what shocked him.., was the relationship between Yin Su’er and the Sword Union.

He had never expected that the sword union and Yin Su’er would actually have a cooperative relationship from the very beginning. Both sides had long reached an agreement, and in this battle, all sorts of changes were made.

Yin Su’er’s methods had completely exceeded his expectations.

He was also completely convinced by Yin Su’er.

Not only in terms of strength, but also in terms of intelligence and tactics, he no longer had any doubts.

Naturally, he was now willing to serve Yin Su’er as his master.

And Yun Shan’s change in attitude made yin su’er immediately overjoyed.

“Uncle Yun Shan, from today onwards, you will still be the grand elder of our Crimson Rock Castle. In Crimson Rock Castle, other than me, you will be the most respected,”yin su’er said hurriedly.

“Hehe, it’s rare for Su’er to still be willing to call me uncle.”Yun Shan also revealed a trace of a smile.

When the surrounding people saw this, they all heaved a sigh of relief.

It was very obvious that Yin Su’er and Yun Shan had completely reconciled.

The past struggles, even the great battle this time, had already become the clouds of the past.

And this was the best ending for Crimson Rock Castle.

“Well, although we won this battle, it was a pyrrhic victory. Not only did many great divine masters die, but even those who survived were injured and consumed too much of each other’s divine power. We should go back and recover our injuries and divine power. After we recover, we will think of ways to deal with those top forces,”Jian Wushuang said with a smile.

“Yes, restore good condition first, then go to those few families to settle accounts properly! !”Yin Su’er’s voice was ice-cold.
