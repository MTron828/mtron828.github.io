Chapter 1072: The Dominance of Bloodlines

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“The battle formation relies on the fusion of the Bloodline Powers of all nine of them. There were rumors that there existed two bloodlines in the Ancient Monster Clan. More than nine-tenths of the clan was of the Heavenly Demon Bloodline, the bloodline which powers and potentials have been greatly, if not fully, awakened. But the one other bloodline, which is rarer even among their kin, is the Ancient God Bloodline.”

“Bearers of the Ancient God Bloodline command great power and potential as well. But there have only a handful of them who have been known to bear this very bloodline and have begun to awaken its powers.”

“Hence, I would hazard that the nine Ancient God Guardians are, in fact, Dao Masters who have awakened the bloodline of the Ancient Gods!”

The voice was issued from the midst of the crowd of warriors watching the battle, although none knew whom. But the narration had shed much light that many finally understood what was going on.

The Celestial Master Ku Xin stood in the midst of the horde of the Ancient Monster Clan, his face grave and sullen. “The Battle Formation of Ancient Gods is also an heirloom that has been passed down through generations since the birth of the Ancient Monster Clan. It is one of our most potent secret weapons which has invincible might and power. Unfortunately, only those who have awakened the Ancient God Bloodline is able to wield it…”

“The kins of the Ancient Monster Clan have always been predominantly of the Heavenly Demon Bloodline. It is a pity that we have only so few kinsmen who bore the bloodline of the Ancient Gods even after years and years of our painstaking efforts. Only six of our Dao Masters… If only we have more Dao Masters in the clan who bear this mighty bloodline… We would have been able to conquer even the three Principal Populations of this Continent with the help of this battle formation.”

The gaze of the Celestial Master Ku Xin turned frosty.

“It is a pity indeed… to have so few of our kin to have awakened the Ancient God Bloodline…” The Celestial Master thought quietly.

As one of the four Principal Populations of the Samsara Continent, the Ancient Monster Clan commanded immense strength which forces were largely bolstered by the horde of Dao Masters the clan was proud to have. Then again, from the innumerable horde of their Dao Masters, the Ancient Monster Clan has but only six of their kin who have awakened the bloodline of the Ancient Gods.

The Battle Formation would have been stronger if the Clan was able to field more Dao Masters with the Ancient God Bloodline. But with only six Dao Masters, the power of the Battle Formation would barely reach the strengths of a Celestial Master.

Hence, so as to prepare themselves for this confrontation, the Ancient Monster Clan have exhausted much of their resources to elevate another three Eternal Realm warriors to the ranks of Dao Masters in order to assemble the force of the nine Ancient God Guardians.

With the combined powers of the nine, the Battle Formation of Ancient Gods was able to reach a greater limit.

“This Battle Formation is remarkable too…” Jian Nantian grinned thinly as he observed the formation before him.

But a figure stepped before him before he could act.

“Leave this to me, Father.” Jian Wushuang said calmly.

“Oh?” Jian Nantian’s brows twitched curiously. He nodded at once.

He withdrew further to the back. Jian Wushuang raised his head and looked up at the gargantuan figure of the Ancient God which was conjured by the Battle Formation.

“A Four-star Silver-armored Ancient God?” Jian Wushuang smirked, channeling his Bloodline Powers.

Jian Wushuang’s body began to grow rapidly, rising up into great heights that he almost filled the space between sky and earth. His height rose close to a thousand meters tall, dwarfing even the Silver-armored Ancient God which was only a meagre few hundreds of meters tall.

Like a huge mountain, Jian Wushuang’s monstrous figure, although still clad in his blood-red robes, shone with a luster of gold. But the debate and attention of everyone watching the fight were upon his forehead.

As clear as the glittering stars in a dark night, upon Jian Wushuang’s forehead were the symbols of three reversed Quadrangular Stars.

Despite being only three, the Quadrangular Stars were all shining with sparkles of dark golden luminance.

Jian Wushuang’s dark golden eyes looked into the air as they flared with rage from within.

“Roar!”

A furious roar thundered from his throat, releasing a shockwave that rippled forth as the echoes of his booming voice trembled through the air as if they would never fade.

With his deafening roar, Jian Wushuang had also released a burst of his enormous Bloodline Powers that swept forth towards the figure of the Ancient God of the Battle Formation with the force of a powerful storm.

The 100-feet-tall figure of the Ancient God shivered slightly, showing signs of imminent collapse.

The nine Ancient God Guardians who were strenuously sustaining the Battle Formation immediately felt a huge pressure pummeling at them; a powerful force that could have only came from Bloodline Powers.

It was a pressure so terrible and unstoppable!

An overwhelming force that battered ceaselessly and furiously at the bloodline they bore.

“Deng! Deng! Deng! Deng!”

Forced by the powerful shockwave, the figure of the lesser Ancient God lost its footing finally, staggering a few steps backward at being driven by the strong tide.

This left everyone who was watching the battle awe-struck and speechless, including the warriors of the Ancient Monster Clan.

“W-What, what… what is happening?”

“It is the dominance in the hierarchy! The relationship of superiority and inferiority between their bloodlines!”

“Jian Wushuang possesses too the bloodline of the Ancient Gods. But his bloodline is purer and stronger than that of the warriors of the Ancient Monster Clan that sustained the Battle Formation!”

Everyone present could only gulp hard with disbelief.

Much excitement was stirred in Ancient Monster Clan.

“Dark golden… A dark-golden Ancient God!”

“I-Is this… is this is the legendary Imperial Ancient God?”

“Is this even possible!”

“In spite of their combined effort, the nine Ancient God Guardians can only summon a Silver-armored Ancient God… But Jian Wushuang bears the bloodline of the Imperial Ancient Gods? T-This, this…”

“W-Who, who was the foolish wretch who had sneered that Jian Wushuang was only born with only a lowly bloodline?”

“Lowly? Nay. This is the bloodline of the Imperial Ancient God. A variant of the Ancient God Bloodline of the highest order! There have still been a number of the kins of the Ancient Monster Clan who had been able to invoke the bloodline of the Ancient Gods, but none have been known to have achieved a bloodline of such excellence. Jian Wushuang’s bloodline is undoubted the purest Ancient God Bloodline even in the Ancient Monster Clan!”

“With the bloodline of such greatness, alas… he should have been one of our kin… one of the Ancient Monster Clan…”

Riotous roars and angry cries rose from the midst of the warriors of the Ancient Monster Clan.

“Silence!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The Celestial Master Ku Xin snarled, not being able to hold back his rage finally. However, even he was extremely shocked himself despite his best efforts to silence his emotions. The Celestial Master’s eyes glared sharply ahead.

“Be that as it may, he is merely a Three-star Ancient God! A strength with equals only the class of Dao Master! The Ancient God of the Battle Formation is an Ancient God of Four Stars! There is no doubt that our Ancient God wields greater strength that Jian Wushuang!”

“Strike now! Battle Formation of Ancient Gods!”

The Celestial Master Ku Xin shouted at once.

Faithful to his commands, the hulking Silver-armored Ancient God of the Battle Formation began to move.

“Dong! Dong! Dong!”

The Silver-armored Ancient God leaped into action, its every step spanning almost 500kilometers as it sped at Jian Wushuang. As it rushed at its quarry, its aura began to rise, mounting higher and higher as it gradually reached its peak.

“A Four-star Silver-armored Ancient God… Let us put our strengths to a test then…”

Jian Wushuang growled, his eyes glowing with a yearn for blood. He too threw himself forward, rushing forward to meet his adversary.

The two gigantic behemoths, each radiating with destructive auras from their Bloodline Powers, charged forward. At the center of the site of their battle, the two titanic beings crashed into each another.
