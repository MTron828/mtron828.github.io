Chapter 2623: World Transformation

Transmigration World was mainly powered by Transmigration Law which was filled with inexhaustible Transmigration powers within. Samsara Strength activation or usage of Transmigration-related secret techniques in that world would have their strength greatly empowered.

However, tactics from other laws would be weakened considerably in that world.

The effect of Jian Wushuang’s Transmigration Sword Formation could be maximized there.

On the other hand, Yuan Lei had his Vitality Law limited in every way.

“Yuan Lei, welcome to my world.”

Jian Wushuang’s laughter pounded on Yuan Lei’s eardrums as he felt a touch of annoyance.

“World Transformation! This kid could actually do that in an instant? How mind-blowing is that formation!” Yuan Lei was feeling a little shocked but quickly firmed up his stare. “No, he’s a mere Earth Ultimate God regardless of how skilled this kid is. Grand techniques such as World Transformation are perhaps unachievable even by Undying Saints let alone him. He must be relying on some treasure!

“Yes, it has to be a treasure! A treasure that enables World Transformation!

“The treasure would be mine if I killed him!!”

Killing intent rose in Yuan Lei’s mind.

He originally did not have such strong killing intent toward Jian Wushuang as he only wanted Jian Wushuang to pay him 50,000,000 Primordial Stones and he would immediately leave.

However, forget about 50,000,000 at that moment. He would definitely not allow Jian Wushuang to walk away alive even if he agreed to pay him 100,000,000 Primordial Stones.

Boom!!

The three kilometers tall green titan’s hostility shot up into the Heavens. It already appeared before Jian Wushuang and attacked furiously with the lance in its hands.

“Hmph!”

Jian Wushuang let out a cold humph as the nine Infernal Crimson Divine Swords floating before him once again overlapped each other and again formed the first stage of Transmigration Sword Formation, Heaven’s Edge. The sword formation’s energy level increased drastically and shot out with a boom under the empowerment from the surrounding infinite Samsara Strength.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

One violent bang after another resonated as the Transmigration Sword Formation repeatedly clashed head-on with the green titan’s lance. Although the black divine sword was fended off every time and even flying off, the green titan did not have it easy either with its advancement completely blocked.

Moreover, the black divine sword was incredibly agile.

It could completely turn into an overpowering sword formation, but it could also disassemble into nine different swords while still being able to unleash incomparable energy. For instance, the sword formation found a chance to disassemble at that moment—six Infernal Crimson Divine Swords continued clashing with the green titan while the other three were attacking Yuan Lei like lightning under the empowerment of the surrounding Samsara Strength.

The grim-looking Yuan Lei spontaneously executed a palm strike which deflected those three Infernal Crimson Divine Swords and caused them to fly backward.

In a not-so-distant void, Jian Wushuang’s eyes were burning with a heaven-shaking battle intent in the center of the Transmigration World at that moment.

“Heaven Ultimate God... I’d love to see if I have the abilities to slay a Heaven Ultimate God!!”

Jian Wushuang moved with a blood-thirsty smile.

The Heaven and Earth around transformed once again as he moved.

Although the surrounding was still pitch black, the various Reincarnation Passages had already vanished out of sight. A large number of Space-time cracks and immense Space-time storms took over its place. The Samsara Strength that initially filled the area between Heaven and Earth had changed into surging Space-time Energy!!

The Thousand Treasures Grand World had shifted from Transmigration World into Space-time World in the blink of an eye!

That world was dominated by Space-time!

“Heaven and Earth have changed again?”

Yuan Lei’s face was grim as Jian Wushuang concurrently appeared before him under his scrutiny... Ring!!

A total of 300 apparitions burst out at the same time and filled the space. They were faster and more agile under the effect of Space-time Energy. Even Yuan Lei could not tell which among the apparitions was Jian Wushuang’s true self in such a short time. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Whoosh!

A cold sword-light suddenly appeared and cunningly directed itself at Yuan Lei’s heart from behind.

“That’s really fast!”

Yuan Lei was shocked.

In truth, Jian Wushuang could not perform at such incredible speed with his current understanding of Space-time Law. The speed was mainly due to him situated at the Space-time World within the Thousand Treasures Grand World. His performance using Space-time Law was greatly amplified there.

Boom!

A low-impact noise resonated which shuddered Yuan Lei who swiftly and subconsciously moved sideways.

However, Jian Wushuang instantly dashed forward and completely unleashed his sword technique with a terrifying speed.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Shades of sword shadows lashed out from Jian Wushuang’s hand.

The sword shadows looked very spontaneous, hence its momentum was not considered strong. However, they were moving too fast!

Too fast. They were just too fast.

Jian Wushuang already possesses very fast speeds. The Space-time World’s assistance only immensely further increased his attack speed which resulted in his sword-lights moving incredibly fast despite being a spontaneous attack.

The inexhaustible sword shadows were like an infinite ocean of swords that shrouded Yuan Lei within and forced him to defend himself the best he could. Despite being able to defend himself, he began to lose gradually from exhaustion.

“Kid, don’t be too cocky now!!”

Yuan Lei was incredibly mad and finally unleashed his Heaven Ultimate God abilities.

Layers and layers of Vital Strength shrouded his body as his divine body also began to surge violently before growing to five meters tall with a great deal of energy increase. Energy began to gather in his right hand as he unleashed a palm strike.

Boom boom!!

Heaven and Earth shivered as a gigantic hand suddenly appeared.

That gigantic hand emitted such energy levels that it would make any regular Earth Ultimate God lose all hopes to live.

Even Jian Wushuang could not help but squint.

It was not long from when he first managed to control the Thousand Treasures Grand World, hence the Space-time World he manifested from within was not too sturdy. The surrounding Space-time World began to tremble upon the appearance of the gigantic hand. The gigantic hand’s complete energy outburst shattered the Space-time World and caused Jian Wushuang to retreat at that instant.

“Heaven Ultimate Gods are truly marvelous. However...” Jian Wushuang sneered as the shattered Space-time World began to rebuild itself at an incredible speed. The world began to shift once again.

The shrouding darkness and Space-time storms had faded away—revealing Jian Wushuang and Yuan Lei on a bare wasteland with many swords plunged to the ground. There were longswords, soft swords, heavy swords, and various other sword types. However, each of the swords undoubtedly had a terrifying aura.

Ten of thousands of swords were plunged standing from the ground on that wide wasteland.

It was a huge scale sword grave!

Thousand Treasures Grand World...Sword Principle World!!
