Chapter 3436 Azure Demon

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, what are you doing here?” Azure Demon stared at Jian Wushuang.

A man’s name was like the shadow of a tree.

Jian Wushuang was so famous in the Divine Beginning Realm that even though Azure Demon had reached the level of the fifth void realm, he did not dare to underestimate him.

“It seems that the four of you are here for the supreme treasure in the cave mansion. But I have to tell you that there is no supreme treasure in the cave mansion. It is just a good friend of mine who is in seclusion there. He is also the one who caused the disturbance in the surroundings. Therefore, the four of you should go back,” Jian Wushuang said indifferently.

“Your good friend is in seclusion?” Azure Demon sneered in his heart, then he said, “It seems that the reason why the people of Yu Palace and Yu Hua Sect haven’t been able to enter the cave mansion is because of you. Although I don’t know why you are able to keep them out, I have to tell you that the Azure Demon Divine Hall is different from Yu Palace and Yu Hua. You’d better make way now. Otherwise, I don’t mind teaching you a lesson on behalf of the people of the Temporal Temple.”

“Teach me a lesson?” Jian Wushuang’s face darkened. “Azure Demon, I’m afraid you’re not qualified to teach me a lesson.”

“How dare you!” Azure Demon’s voice turned cold, and his body suddenly moved. The moment Jian Wushuang saw Azure Demon move, he also attacked.

“Buzz, buzz, buzz!” Jian Wushuang activated his life divine power. In an instant, he exerted his power to the maximum. The Blood Mountain Sword in his hand turned into blood-red lightning and suddenly slashed out.

It was the peerless sword technique, Xi Xiang!

The space was instantly cut open. This huge sword shadow could tear everything apart.

Many experts standing in the nearby void, especially the Principles Masters of Yu Palace and Yu Hua Sect, could not help but be frightened when they saw this sword move. Previously, Jian Wushuang had used this sword move to block all of them. Whether it was Sect Master Yu Hua or Palace Master Yu, who had already reached the fourth realm of the void, they could only be crushed by that sword move.

But now, Jian Wushuang was facing Azure Demon, who was already at the fifth realm of the Void Realm.

“Humph!”

Azure Demon snorted, and his power suddenly increased. Rumble! Endless cyan air waves swept out like a vast cyan ocean. In this cyan ocean, Azure Demon waved his hand, and a cyan stone staff suddenly expanded and stabbed toward the blood-red sword light.

Boom!

The two collided, and a terrifying power instantly erupted.

The void was like a piece of paper, exploding under the two powers. Huge space cracks filled the sky.

At the center of the two shocking powers, the blood-red sword light could not withstand the opponent’s terrifying power and collapsed. Jian Wushuang immediately retreated and finally regained his balance.

This scene made the onlookers’ pupils shrink, but they were not too surprised.

“As expected, Azure Demon is stronger!”

“It’s normal. After all, Azure Demon is an expert of the fifth void realm, and Heavenly Sword Marquis, although he is extremely powerful, his battle strength is probably at the peak of the fourth void realm.”

“An Immortal Saint has the battle strength of the peak of the fourth void realm. This is already incredible. If he is any stronger, it would be unjustifiable.”

Many experts began to discuss among themselves.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, no wonder you were able to stop the people of Yu Palace and Yu Hua Sect by yourself. You were able to fight me head-on. You are indeed very strong. Moreover, you are just an Immortal Saint. Unfortunately, your strength is not as good as mine. If I want to enter the cave mansion, you can’t stop me.” Azure Demon’s eyes were cold, he stared at Jian Wushuang.

“Haha, Azure Demon, it’s too early for you to be happy.” Jian Wushuang laughed and said, “That was only the first time we fought. I was just testing your strength. Now, let’s fight again!”

Hearing this, Azure Demon narrowed his eyes and said, “You’re boasting!”

Whoosh!

Azure Demon moved and attacked again.

Similarly, the green air currents that filled the sky formed an enormous green ocean, and Azure Demon was the absolute ruler of this green ocean. He held the staff in one hand, and the green stone staff in his hand magnified endlessly, then stirred the entire ocean, he suddenly smashed out.

It must be known that in the first collision just now, Azure Demon had only used the long staff to stab out.

But now, he had used the long stick to smash him!

The power of the long stick must have been stronger.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang was not afraid at all. A faint smile even appeared on his face. Just as the long stick was about to hit him, Jian Wushuang’s body shook, and he suddenly used the Heaven-cleaving skill!

Once the Heaven-cleaving skill was used, Jian Wushuang’s power instantly soared to a whole new level.

“Peerless Sword manual, Xi Xiang!”

The same sword move!

The same blood-red sword light smashed down like lightning, no different from the sword move that had collided with Azure Demon just now.

However, the power of the same sword move was completely different at this moment.

In the blink of an eye, the blood-red sword light collided with the enlarged cyan stone stick again.

Boom!

The commotion caused by this clash was much greater than the previous one.

When the surrounding spectators saw the two terrifying auras coming into direct contact, they even felt that the world around them was trembling crazily. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

That shocking aura caused everyone around to tremble in fear.

However, this time, the head-on clash did not end in a stalemate like the previous one. Instead, the victor was determined in just an instant.

The green ocean that covered Azure Demon’s body was swept away by the power of the sword light in an instant. The entire green ocean disappeared, and the green stone staff in Azure Demon’s hand...was also slightly changed by the power of the sword light. The terrifying power caused Azure Demon to stagger and almost fall.

“How is this possible?!”

Azure Demon’s eyes were wide open in disbelief.

He really could not believe that Jian Wushuang was suppressed by him in the collision just now. However, the power of his stone stick was even stronger now. In the end, he was completely crushed by Jian Wushuang’s sword.

However, before Azure Demon could be shocked, his heart was shocked because Jian Wushuang had already attacked again after repelling him with his sword.

Swish!

Jian Wushuang moved like a ghost and appeared beside Azure Demon at an extremely fast speed. At the same time, he slashed out with his Blood Mountain Sword.

Wushuang Sword Manual, Star Dream!

Among the seven sword moves of the Wushuang Sword Manual, the sword move that focused on cutting and tearing was the most important.

Jian Wushuang also used the Heaven-cleaving skill while using his full strength!

The Heaven-cleaving skill made the sword move extremely terrifying!
