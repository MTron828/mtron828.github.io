2046 Vented Anger

Ever since Jian Wushuang had come to Three-Emperors World, Ling Zong had met him thrice.

The first time, there were six Great Emperors that had besieged Jian Wushuang in Silver-Winged God Mansion.

Then, Jian Wushuang’s power was merely at ordinary Great Emperor level. He didn’t care about Jian Wushuang. At most, Jian Wushuang was only scary in terms of his defense power. Hence, the six Great Emperors besieged him but could do nothing to him.

The second time was thirty years back. During the war, Jian Wushuang had once fought against him. Jian Wushuang was his match then.

Now it was the third time he’d fought against Jian Wushuang. They fought head-on again and he went all out. However, he was beaten back by Jian Wushuang with one stroke.

What’s going on?

If he hadn’t known about Jian Wushuang’s background and situation, he would have suspected Jian Wushuang had been hiding his true power since the beginning.

In merely tens of years of time, one who only had ordinary Great Emperor power that he didn’t care about had advanced by leaps and bounds to beyond his power.

“Hehe, I thought you were amazing. But from what it seems now, you’re so-so,” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly at Ling Zong.

Ling Zong was triggered and spat, “Let’s fight against him all together. I don’t believe that we can’t kill him!”

Then, Long Zong attacked again.

At the same time, the Great Emperors around him charged at Jian Wushuang with billowing murderous intention, including the three Great Emperors, who were severely injured by Jian Wushuang.

Hence, the scene where thirteen Great Emperors joined forces to besiege one person thirty years ago reappeared.

The person who was besieged was still Jian Wushuang.

However, thirty years had passed. Jian Wushuang was no longer the person he’d been before. Naturally, the situation was different.

“Haha, come on! During the last fight, we didn’t fight a hearty battle. This time, I shall play with all of you heartily.”

Jian Wushuang laughed as he was emboldened.

Compared to thirty years ago, his divine body had improved tremendously and the same applied to his divine power.

If it was said that there were thirteen Great Emperors who had joined forces to besiege him back then and it would take them a while to possibly kill him. He might not even have been killed if the thirteen Great Emperors joined forces to besiege him for three days and three nights straight.

On top of that, Jian Wushuang’s current power was on an entirely different level.

Whoop! Whoop! Whoop!

Jian Wushuang continuously wielded Blood Mountain Sword on the battlefield with billowing force.

The Sword Principle that he performed had four moves. It was the four moves in Xuan Luo Sword Principle.

However, the four moves were like one. It was simply perfect.

The thirteen Great Emperor performed various powerful attacks. Jian Wushuang would block it if he could. If he couldn’t, he would resist it by using his divine body directly. The Sword Principle that he performed was shocking.

“Be careful!!!”

“Don’t fight head-on with him. He is too powerful!”

“This b*stard… I am a Great Emperor and I was severely injured by one stroke of his when I fought him head-on. He is every more powerful than Ling Zong.”

“Hurry up and dodge!!”

There were angry roars and shrill screams on the battlefield.

The ones who made the noises were naturally the thirteen Great Emperors from Three-Emperors World.

They fought with their all. They besieged Jian Wushuang just like they had done thirty years ago. However, they had realized that the situation was entirely different from thirty years ago. Thirty years ago, Jian Wushuang was suppressed. He was only on the defensive and taking hits. He had survived for so long only because of his defensive power. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

But then, although he was still suppressed, Jian Wushuang had the power to counterattack!

Every time he fought back, the sword principle was ridiculously powerful. Besides Ling Zong and the tall and sturdy middle-aged man who could barely block it, the other Great Emperors would be severely injured if they were to take the hit alone. Hence, from the beginning of the fight until then, it was less than ten breaths time, but there were two people who were severely injured among the thirteen Great Emperors. Their fighting power was badly damaged.

On the contrary, Jian Wushuang was still perfectly intact and he was energetic. His fighting power was terrifying too.

The Great Emperors began to panic.

In the void far from the battlefield, the cultivators in early and middle stage Chaotic Realm on Imperial Peak were astonished by the fight.

They were watching the battle in disbelief.

“Isn’t that the person who was killed by the Great Emperors back then?”

“Yeah, it’s him. He intentionally disguised himself as an ordinary cultivator in early stage Chaotic Realm and entered Imperial Peak back then. But he died thirty years back. Now, not only is he not dead, but he has also become stronger. He is ridiculously powerful!”

“The thirteen Great Emperors in Peak Chaotic Realm joined forces but couldn’t capture him. On top of that, they were injured by him in such a short time span. His power…”

Many of them gasped in admiration.

Among the crowd, the most astonished person was Lin Tianhao.

He looked at Jian Wushuang, who was invincible like a demon, and he shivered in fear.

“Monster! This Ah Shou is simply a monster,” Lin Tianhao muttered.

In the middle of the battlefield.

Bang!

Jian Wushuang’s sword that brought about boundless power slashed at a Great Emperor’s divine weapon again.

The Great Emperor’s body quivered and he spat a mouthful of blood. Then, he quickly fell down.

Another Great Emperor was severely injured by Jian Wushuang again.

“Haha, such a hearty fight!

Jian Wushuang’s hysterical laughter spread. “In the two previous fights, I was suppressed and hit. I felt so aggrieved. Now, I can finally teach you a lesson and vent my anger!”

Jian Wushuang felt great.

It was true that he had been dogged by these Great Emperors relying on his advantage of having near-immortality during the last two fights.

In other words, he was plainly being hit.

He had been full of misery during the last two fights. He naturally felt aggrieved. However, he wasn’t powerful enough. He had no choice but to be beaten up.

Now, it was different.

During the fight, although he was still mainly taking hits, at least he could counterattack. On top of that, he had injured a few of them. If it continued, he wouldn’t die and the Great Emperors in front of him would be injured by him one by one.

To be able to do that, Jian Wushuang considered taking revenge.

“I vented my anger and taught you a lesson. I shall not fool around with you anymore.”

Jian Wushuang sneered. He suddenly plunged to the front.

“Want to leave?”

The surrounding Great Emperors instantly responded when they saw Jian Wushuang’s actions.

“Stop him. We absolutely can’t let him escape!” Ling Zong roared.

The Great Emperors from Three-Emperors World looked glum and charged at Jian Wushuang madly.

Jian Wushuang smirked in disdain at the sight.

“Thirty years ago, you could have stop me. But now… no one can stop me if I want to leave!”
