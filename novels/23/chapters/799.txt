Chapter 800: An Assassination

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

After successively winning 10 fights, Jian Wushuang walked off the arena.

“Mr. Swordsman, here’s your Cercis Token. You can use it yourself, lend it to someone or sell it. You may not obtain more than one token,” said the host, an Eternal Realm expert.

“I see, thank you,” said Jian Wushuang as he took the token. He stained the token with a drop of his blood to mark his ownership before getting ready to leave.

“Swordsman,” A voice behind him stopped him in his tracks.

Jian Wushuang turned and saw the girl who had been his first opponent on the arena. She approached him with a smile on her face. “Congratulations,” she said.

“Yes?” Jian Wushuang asked indifferently.

“I’m Lin Wan. I’m here to thank you for showing me mercy during the fight,” explained the girl.

“I have nothing against you. I just wanted to get a Cercis Token. There was no need to kill you,” Jian Wushuang said coolly. He quickly took his leave to avoid entanglements with the girl.

“This guy… is interesting.” Lin Wan wasn’t offended by Jian Wushuang’s indifference. Instead, her curiosity about him grew.

“I thought it would be easy for me to get a Cercis Token in the Blood Battle Arena. I wasn’t expecting him to defeat me so easily. My father was right. The Eternal World has an abundant number of experts and there are many hidden talents on Cercis Island,” Lin Wan thought in amazement.

Just then, two white-robed figures rushed forward anxiously. “Miss, thank God we’ve found you. Let’s go back at once. His Excellency would be furious to know that you were in the Blood Battle Arena.”

“I just got here. Don’t worry. I’ll go back after getting a Cercis Token,” Lin Wan scowled.

“A Cercis Token?”

The two white-robed figures exchanged shocked glances. One of them continued to persuade her. “Miss, please don’t be willful. The fights here are very cruel. If you get injured, we’ll both be blamed for it. You may ask His Excellency for a Cercis Token. You don’t have to fight here.”

“All right, all right. Cut the crap. I’ll go back,” Lin Wan muttered, and followed the two white-robed men away from the Blood Battle Arena.

After leaving the Blood Battle Arena, Jian Wushuang rented a mansion on the island and settled down before looking for chances to kill Su Ming.

Soon, three days had passed.

Jian Wushuang sat by the window on the second floor of a restaurant. He was drinking and paying close attention to what was happening downstairs.

He could clearly see Su Ming, who was protected by the two Eternal Realm experts.

“It has been three days. Su Ming has been staying in the block of Heavenly Cloud Pavilion, and his two guards have not left his side. It’ll be impossible for me to take action even after he leaves the block.”

The block of the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion was filled with experts of the Heavenly Cloud Pavilion, including Lei Xin. If Jian Wushuang attacked Su Ming, those experts would retaliate immediately. It was risky for him to make his move while Su Ming resided in the block.

However, given the present situation, he had to take a risk.

“With the help of his Master, Su Ming’s strength has improved rapidly and he has become a superior Divine Realm expert. Even so, if I do try to kill him, he won’t have time to react.”?Jian Wushuang analyzed the situation.

“As for his two guards, they are only at Step One of the Eternal Realm. My sudden attack will catch them off guard!”

“I’ll find an excellent opportunity, kill Su Ming with one blow, and leave immediately.”

Having made a decision, Jian Wushuang’s expression lightened.

In the last three days, he had assessed the strength of Su Ming and his two guards.

With his strength, he had excellent chances of carrying out a successful assassination and he would have time to escape.

Jian Wushuang left the restaurant and edged closer to where Su Ming was.

Jian Wushuang had completely restrained his aura so that he did not attract any attention. Su Ming did not notice him even as he drew within 50m of him.

“I only have one chance. If I fail to kill him this time, he will be more careful and even stay with his Master. If that happens, I won’t be able to kill him. So I have to kill him now!”?Jian Wushuang said to himself.

His eyes gleamed in anticipation.

“Now!”

He suddenly moved.

His speed instantly reached its peak as he unsheathed the Emperor Sword.

He crossed the distance of less than 50 meters in a flash and swung his sword at unprecedented speed. This move was called Twilight.

A beautiful sword shadow emerged silently before Su Ming’s throat. Jian Wushuang’s Sword Heart reached its fullest power and trembled slightly in his sea of consciousness.

He was not adept at assassination, but he knew how to find the perfect time to kill.

At the perfect moment, he delivered the most unexpected blow with astonishing speed!

That blow left his target no chance of survival.

There was absolutely no way Su Ming could have avoided it.

In the street, Su Ming was guarded by two Eternal Realm experts. He was deep in thought over what his Master had told him and did not even notice the fatal blow approach him.

The two guards did not notice anything amiss until the sword shadow appeared in front of Su Ming’s throat.

“Crap!”

The two guards could not do anything as the sword shadow was too close. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Clank!”

A low metal crash sounded, and Jian Wushuang’s face immediately darkened.

Unexpectedly, an Energy Shield had suddenly appeared around Su Ming at the critical moment and blocked Jian Wushuang’s blow.

The Energy Shield broke as it deflected the strike. The ring on Su Ming’s finger also disintegrated.

That ring was the lifesaving item that Lei Xin had given Su Ming.

It contained a layer of Energy Shield, which would automatically activate when Su Ming encountered a life crisis, but it would only work once.

“What?” Su Ming finally realized what was happening.

He raised his head and stared hard at Jian Wushuang, who had a murderous look on his face.

“Jian, Jian Wushuang!”

Su Ming let out a sharp cry of fear. And as he quickly backed away, he brought out his token to make contact with his Master.

“Master, hurry up, save me! Jian Wushuang is trying to kill me.”
