“Speaking of this, he raised an eyebrow in a suggestive manner!

He mentioned breaking through, probably to the Perfected Nine Revolutions level. Jian Wushuang understood his meaning instantly.

What surprised Jian Wushuang, however, was the fact that the spatial treasure ended up in his hands. He had initially thought it was exchanged by Dao Lord Xue Yue since Xue Yue had profound insights into the origin source of space, not too far from the origin source itself. Obtaining this spatial treasure might have allowed him to break through.

This was the Cosmic Magic Cube!

If not for the Candle Dragon Wings, it would have been Jian Wushuang’s first choice.

“I didn’t exchange for any particularly valuable item, just a rare ancient treasure! ” Jian Wushuang casually remarked.

Hu Qing’s expression changed slightly, and he couldn’t help but speak up, “Brother Wushuang, did you exchange for the Candle Dragon Wings?”

“Yes, that precious item!” Jian Wushuang openly admitted.

There were only a few top-tier treasures, and these people were among the top. It was impossible to hide it, so it was better to be upfront about it.

Upon hearing this, the three present individuals couldn’t help but reveal a look of admiration for the wealthy.

Hu Qing was straightforward and revealed the truth directly. “Brother Wushuang, that old man with the horns mentioned that this treasure isn’t as valuable as it seems, not suitable as a first choice!”

Dao Lord Leng Shuang also chimed in, “That old man did say that. I feel that this treasure has limited impact on our advancement; speed doesn’t necessarily represent much. Xue Yue is a perfect example; his strength is average, not much stronger than Si Tian.”

“Could it be that Brother Wushuang discovered something special about that treasure?!” Ji Chaoyang was observant, quickly grasping the crux of the matter.

Just as he suspected, there was something special about it, but he couldn’t divulge more. Jian Wushuang tactfully changed the subject, putting an end to the discussion.

Ji Chaoyang understood Jian Wushuang’s intentions and immediately shifted the topic to Wan Xing.

“Now it’s confirmed, the Eightfold Cloud Dragon Seal was indeed exchanged by

Wanxing. ”

Several people engaged in discussions, exchanging words and thoughts.

After all, this was the most powerful treasure in the treasure trove. Wan Xing, as the first person of this Original Planet, now possessed such a treasure. His strength had undergone a qualitative transformation. It was a clear boundary T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

separating him from others.

“I can’t see through his strength now. I hope we won’t encounter him in the future!” Dao Lord Leng Shuang said helplessly.

As a female Dao Lord, her advancement had reached its limit. To have the battle power of a half-step Emperor, she could only rely on the hope that the top-grade inheritance would be strong enough. Otherwise, there would be no chance at all.

Ji Chaoyang didn’t mind much. He would have the battle power of a half-step Emperor after breaking through the Perfected Nine Revolutions. Coupled with his supreme techniques and treasures, he could contend with the current Heavenly Emperor Wan Xing.

As for Hu Qing, he had always been indifferent to such matters.

Only Jian Wushuang truly understood him.

Although he didn’t reveal his sharpness, Jian Wushuang could sense that Hu Qing was stronger than the former Wan Xing and could even match the current Wan Xing without breaking through the Perfected Nine Revolutions.

And yet, he hadn’t even achieved the Perfected Nine Revolutions.

If the three of them were to break through the Perfected Nine Revolutions, except for Ji Chaoyang, both he and Hu Qing would surpass Emperor Wan Xing. After chatting for a while and sharing some insights, the group dispersed.

The horn for the seventh wave of attacks would soon sound.

Inside the City Lord’s Mansion, there were still 1,000 Nine Revolutions Grand Yan Immortals.

They had completely bid farewell to the Qishen Temple and could only wait quietly until the 30-year deadline arrived, then return to the Original Universe.

The only benefit they could gain now was the comfortable cultivation environment within the City Lord’s Mansion, far superior to the Original Universe.

Among these individuals were a few unfortunate Perfected Nine Revolutions experts. Even with the treasures they obtained, they couldn’t elevate their combat abilities to the peak level and had to retire with regret. Still, this was considered the best outcome.

There were also tens of thousands of Grand Yan Immortals among them, but they fell at the hands of the Devouring Demon.

Additionally, millions of Grand Yan Immortals perished during the first phase of the Inheritance Trial, never making it to the second stage.

Those who managed to retire alive were already luckier than many others.

Walking away from the City Lord’s mansion, they returned to the city walls.

The appearance of Jian Wushuang immediately caught the attention of Si Tian.

“He got hold of the Candle Dragon Wings first,” Dao Lord Si Tian said with a hint of resentment.

The aura surrounding Jian Wushuang was even stronger than before.

Dao Lord Si Tian clenched his fists tightly, feeling extremely uncomfortable.

It was supposed to be his opportunity, all ruined because of that useless MO Long.

He should have been more ruthless back then, unleashing all his power to kill MO Long. That would have prevented all these complications.

It was a matter of just one thought, and now they were in this situation.

Jian Wushuang stood on the city walls, turned his head, and looked at Dao Lord Si Tian. A smug smile played on his lips, and his eyes glinted with greed, not hiding his intentions.

He wanted to tell Dao Lord Si Tian: I have my eyes on your treasure, and I’ll take it sooner or later.

“Hmph!” Dao Lord Si Tian snorted coldly and shifted his gaze away.

In his mind, Jian Wushuang thought, ‘I can’t rely solely on Qishen Temple. If there’s no infighting later, I’ll never get my hands on that treasure. I need to find a way!’

Even in ordinary conflicts, there might be severe penalties. Jian Wushuang dared not take that risk.

Only in the final few waves could they use their strength without restraint.

If the Devouring Demons managed to defeat Dao Lord Si Tian in those final battles, it would be even better.

Just as he was thinking this, the horn’s buzzing sound echoed.

The 3-Star Devouring Demons had been waiting for a long time.

These Devouoring Demonos were comparable to top-level Grand Yan Immortals, and as always, they started with 100,000 in numbers.

Among the over 80,000 people on the city walls now, all had top-level combat power, with thousands of them at the peak-level.

After these recent battles, their overall strength had increased significantly.

The seventh wave shouldn’t be a problem; the crucial part comes with the next two waves.

At that time, no one knew how many of them would survive.

Jian Wushuang calmed his emotions. As the horn sounded, he swiftly entered the battlefield.

Simultaneously, the seventh wave of battles on all the Original Planets had begun.

Deep within the Original Realm, the Vermilion Bird Temple was unusually lively.

In the grand hall of the Vermilion Bird, which was usually devoid of people, there were now hundreds gathered.

They sat around tables, watching the battles unfold in the sky with relish.

“Haha, this is delightful! I’ve been sleeping who knows how many years; when I drank again, I thought I hadn’t woken up,” said an old man covered in scales, gulping down his drink while watching the battles in the sky, looking quite uncomfortable.

Others nearby mocked, “Qiuhuang, just drinking makes you happy? You should have had a couple of young ladies serve you too!” Laughter erupted among the crowd.

Sitting in the main seat, Zhu Yi frowned repeatedly.

She still couldn’t understand why she had revived these nearly-dead old folks.

Was it because the sea of origin source had too much essence, or did she truly need these outdated individuals’ help?

Now, these people were nothing but skin and bones. Their bodies had been modified, but they had no combat power whatsoever.

Regardless of how strong they were in their prime, now they were, at most, on par with a tier 2 Emperor’s might..
