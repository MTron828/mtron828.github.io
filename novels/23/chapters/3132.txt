Chapter 3133: Cultivation

——

Jian Wushuang had spent seven billion holy elixirs on the nine serenities reincarnation strategy and the black-level sword principle trial tower alone.

As for the remaining 4.5 billion holy elixirs…

Jian Wushuang had exchanged two billion holy elixirs for an emperor-level saint breaking elixir.

He had also exchanged two billion holy elixirs for a total of 20 drops of the cold blood poison, averaging one drop of 100 million holy elixirs.

As for the last 500 million holy pills, Jian Wushuang used them all to exchange for divine power fruit.

In the secret chamber, Jian Wushuang sat alone with his legs crossed, looking very calm.

“The Purple Cloud Pavilion has sealed off the time and space around this Mystic Realm. I can’t leave in a short time. Since I can’t leave, I might as well stay in this nest and cultivate. It just so happens that I need time to cultivate. When I’m strong enough to deal with the experts of the Purple Cloud Pavilion, I’ll go out,” Jian Wushuang muttered, he already had an idea in his mind.

Jian Wushuang immediately began to cultivate.

A dark and boundless void.

This was the black-level sword principle trial tower.

Jian Wushuang stood in the middle of this dark void, and in front of him, a black-clothed figure stood coldly.

“Trial-taker, use all your strength and defeat me. You can meet your next opponent,” the black-clothed figure said coldly.

Jian Wushuang flipped his palm, and the Blood Mountain Sword appeared in his hand.

Swish!

The dazzling sword light lit up the entire dark void. Jian Wushuang had already made his move and started a fierce battle with the first opponent of the sword principle trial tower.

Time passed quickly.

Time passed mercilessly. In a flash, 90 years had passed.

90 years was nothing to an ordinary Immortal Saint.

During these 90 years, the heart wizard, Long Lu, and other experts of the Purple Cloud Pavilion had been guarding outside the realm. The space and time where the nest was located had been sealed. The heart wizard was still waiting, waiting for Jian Wushuang to come out of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s realm.

At this moment, in a vast chaotic void far away.

Mo Shan, the three-eyed man, and the green-haired woman, these three high-level experts of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, gathered together, drinking and chatting.

These three people had broken through to become Principles Masters a long time ago, and their strength had almost reached their limits. It was very difficult for them to have the chance to improve again unless they went to the universe battlefield…thus, the three of them were very free on normal days.

“Mo Shan, how is that little guy called Heavenly Sword Marquis now?” The three-eyed man asked.

“He is still the same. He has been cultivating in seclusion in that Mystic Realm, and the people of the Purple Cloud Pavilion have been waiting outside,” Mo Shan said.

“I don’t know what this little guy is thinking. We only need him to say a word, and our Heaven-cleaving Alliance will naturally send the people of the Purple Cloud Pavilion away for him. But he insisted on acting tough. Now, he has been trapped in this Mystic Realm and can’t get out. and the people of the Purple Cloud Pavilion seem to be watching him closely. They won’t give him a chance at all,” the three-eyed man said.

“He’s not trying to be brave. He just doesn’t want to owe us a favor,” Mo Shan said.

“He doesn’t owe us a favor. How can he solve the crisis in front of him by himself?

“Does he think that he will leave after hiding in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance’s Realm for a long time?”

“That’s too naive,” the three-eyed man said. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“I don’t know, but from what I know about this little guy, he must have his own plans. Let’s ignore him and just watch quietly. I’m looking forward to seeing if this little guy can give us another surprise,” Mo Shan said.

“Surprise?” The three-eyed man and the blue-haired woman looked at each other and shook their heads helplessly.

In fact, with the style of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, they would never allow the Purple Cloud Pavilion to seal the space-time around the nest. They allowed it now because they had a little expectation for Jian Wushuang, they wanted to see how Jian Wushuang could solve the crisis alone.

“Let’s keep watching.” Mo Shan smiled, but he had a certain confidence in Jian Wushuang.

…

In the Mystic Realm of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, which had been sealed by time and space.

Buzz!

The endless power of reincarnation principles filled the entire secret chamber, and the power of reincarnation principles was completely centered on Jian Wushuang. When Jian Wushuang opened his eyes, the power of reincarnation principles around him disappeared instantly.

Jian Wushuang exhaled lightly, but a faint smile appeared on his face.

“After comprehending it for such a long time, I’ve finally comprehended the first Dao of the six paths of reincarnation.” Jian Wushuang was also quite excited.

The six paths of reincarnation was the biggest opportunity he had obtained in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm.

It was a powerful secret skill that was comparable to the space-time divine skill and might even be a little stronger.

However, although he had obtained the complete inheritance of this secret skill, he had never truly mastered it. After all, this secret skill was very profound and required a very high level of comprehension of reincarnation principles, previously, Jian Wushuang was barely qualified to comprehend the secret skill.

But now, after 90 years of cultivation, although he spent most of his time on sword principle cultivation, he still left a lot of time to comprehend the principles and secret skills.

With the help of the Gold-splitting Secret Manual, he had made great progress in the space-time principles.

In the reincarnation principles, he had also made great progress in the past 90 years because of the nine serenities reincarnation strategy.

Jian Wushuang had spent eight years to master the First Dao of the six paths of reincarnation.

“I wonder how powerful the first Dao of the six paths of reincarnation will be with my current strength?” Jian Wushuang was looking forward to it.

However, he knew that he had no chance to try it now.

He was now in the lair of the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, so he could not practice such a powerful secret skill. If he left the lair, the people of the Purple Cloud Pavilion would immediately attack him.

“There’s no hurry. I have mastered the secret skill, so I have plenty of time to use it in the future.” Jian Wushuang smiled and began to calculate his current strength.

Over the past 90 years of cultivation, he had made great progress, especially in sword principle. With the help of the ‘Gold-splitting Secret Manual’ and the ‘black grade’ sword principle trial tower, his understanding of the sword principle had greatly improved, now, the boundless sword tree in his body had risen from 99,000 feet to 16,500 feet. The power of his swordsmanship was even more terrifying.

As for his sword techniques…the unparalleled sword manual he created had already reached the level of a fifth-level ultimate skill.

But in the past 50 years, he had been creating new worlds in the sword principle trial tower, making continuous breakthroughs and advancing by leaps and bounds.
