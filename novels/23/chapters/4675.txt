4676 Immortal From Above the Heavens, Ding Baiyi (2)

Then, he raised his head and looked at the young man who was as graceful as an immortal. He said softly, “That’s right.”

The young man was slightly stunned. Then, he said in a clear voice, “There’s no point in talking any further. Will you give me your head of your own accord, or will I take it myself?”

Jian Wushuang was depressed and began to suspect that he had a body constitution that attracted trouble.

He had walked step by step until now, and there were countless people who wanted to kill him all the time. Now, this guy who came from nowhere wanted to take his head off. This made Jian Wushuang angry. “You want my head? I’m afraid you have the heart but not the strength!”

The young man sneered, “Then I’ll come and take it.”

“I’m the Sword Immortal, Ding Baiyi. I don’t kill nameless people. Tell me your name, and I’ll take your life.”

“Jian Wushuang,” Jian Wushuang said coldly as an invisible long sword appeared in his hand.

The young man who claimed to be Sword Immortal Ding Baiyi’s disdainful gaze gradually disappeared when he saw the invisible long sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand.

“I didn’t expect to find such pure swordsmanship in this world. I’m so lucky,” Sword Immortal Ding Baiyi murmured. “Forget it. I’ll kill you after I admire your swordsmanship.”

With that, he reached out and flicked the sleeve at his waist, and a True Sword with Immortal Charm materialized.

Jian Wushuang’s heart skipped a beat, and an extremely pure Sword Daoo spread out.

“Old Master, once we start fighting, you must leave quickly.” After he whispered these words, he held the Invisible Sword in his hand and floated in the air.

Ding Baiyi waved his hand, and the vast energy formed a field that enveloped the two of them.

“One sword move, one sword form. You may start first.” Ding Baiyi took half a step back, his sword on his back.

Jian Wushuang did not say anything. He directly swung the Invisible Sword in his hand and released the first move of the Tarot Sword Manual, Eternal Night.

The Dao Field suddenly dimmed, and the darkness that could devour all things descended.

“Huh?” Ding Baiyi exclaimed. Then, he used his left hand, which was not holding a sword, to carve a sword technique out of thin air, which directly broke the first move of Eternal Night!

However, at the same time as the Eternal Night was destroyed, an even more vast Sword Intent soared into the sky. The aura that controlled the growth of all things in the universe came from all directions.

The new moon, snow, sun, spring, and autumn rose one after another, entering this place alone as if it was eternal.

Ding Baiyi’s plain clothes fluttered in the wind, and his calm eyes gradually turned fiery. He raised his True Sword, which was brimming with Immortal energy, and slashed out!

He had combined the Four Seasons of the Tarot Divine Sword with his own thoughts, but he had lost. He had lost without any suspense.

The Extinctive Sword Strike easily broke through the Four Seasons Sword Technique and continued forward without losing momentum, shattering the shoulder blade of Jian Wushuang’s left shoulder.

Divine blood gushed out, and divine bones were broken.

“Jian Wushuang!” Feng Qi screamed and was about to rush forward, but was stopped by Old Master. “With me here, Wushuang will be fine.”

Hearing this, although Feng Qi gave up, her eyes were full of nervousness.

In the Dao Field, Jian Wushuang let the divine blood on his left shoulder flow freely as he stared at Ding Baiyi.

Ding Baiyi smiled in return. “The sword technique you used just now was not your own. Although it was extremely exquisite, it had long lost its wisdom, so it can not be considered superior. If I had insisted on taking your head just now, I’m afraid you would not be as intact as you are now.”

“If this is all you’ve got in the way of the sword, I’d advise you to stretch out your neck and wait to be killed. Don’t make a fool of yourself.”

Jian Wushuang did not say anything. He slowly raised the Invisible Sword in his hand and thousands of Sword Intents spread out in the air like vines.

At the same time, a majestic and unparalleled image condensed behind him! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Interesting.” Ding Baiyi grinned, and the sword in his hand hummed. In the next moment, he turned into a stream of light and thrust forward.

Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his eyes. The vast Sword Intent was like thousands of silver rivers flowing out. The purest straight cut fell heavily.

With just one strike, the Dao Field that was built up could not withstand it and shattered. The indescribable Sword Intent surpassed any of his previous strikes!

The two extremely pure Sword Intents collided and a magnificent explosion instantly swept across the entire world with Jian Wushuang as the center.

The Sword Intents was torn and destroyed, and the magnificent peerless image behind Jian Wushuang was finally torn apart.

Heaven and earth wailed, and the invisible Great Dao became restless.

It seemed that the most tragic explosion was actually the sharpest Extinctive Sword Strike that pierced through all his Sword Intent. All the Sword Intents were like layers of barriers, breaking one by one.

Jian Wushuang’s face was bitter. Was he going to be defeated like this?

Even Old Master could no longer remain calm and raised his foot to rush to help.

However, in the next moment, time seemed to have stopped. The layers of destruction seemed to have stopped at the last moment.

The Invincible Sword also trembled and finally stopped in front of the last layer of Sword Intent.

A gust of wind blew past, messing up his hair.

Looking at the True Sword that was only a finger away from his neck, Jian Wushuang turned to Ding Baiyi.

The hand holding the hilt of the sword trembled uncontrollably. Ding Baiyi’s handsome face began to turn pale, and a drop of scarlet divine blood dripped from his nose.

“What, what…” Without saying a word, he fell unconscious.

Jian Wushuang used his divine power to wrap Ding Baiyi’s divine body and lay him flat in the void.

Seeing this, Old Master, Supreme Xue Bo, and the others quickly came to Jian Wushuang.

Old Master exchanged a glance with Ding Baiyi, then raised the black scepter and prepared to kill him.

“Old Master!” Jian Wushuang suddenly opened his mouth and reached out to stop the old man. He shook his head and said, “You can’t kill him. I can feel that he doesn’t have a strong killing intent towards me. Moreover, if you kill him, it would be an unfair victory.”

“Are you serious? Do you know that if he took another step forward, the consequences would be unimaginable?” Feng Qi said anxiously.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered and he finally said, “We can’t kill him. In the beginning, he allowed me to start first with one move, so I’ll take it as returning the favor.”

The Half Ancestors sighed and stopped talking.

Old Master slowly put away the black scepter and nodded at him.

After taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang looked into the distance and said, “Let’s go back to the Cloud Palace.”

The Spring of Chaos was sealed again, and apart from the more broken sky, it was as if nothing had happened.

After returning to the heavenly Cloud Palace, Jian Wushuang opened another divine pavilion and placed the white-robed Ding Baiyi in it. Then, he used his unparalleled divine power to seal off the surroundings of the divine pavilion.

As soon as he woke up, Jian Wushuang could instantly sense him.

Such a Sword Immortal who could possibly come to the Divine Power Universe from the extremely mysterious and secretive Great Yan Domain… This calmed Jian Wushuang’s thoughts gradually.
