Chapter 1039: Shaking with Rage

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“To think that Jian Wushuang would have fled to the Divine Monster Territory!”

“First, he offended me, and now, he’s causing so many problems for the Ancient Monster Clan…”

The eyes of Empyrean Patriarch glowed as he received the news.

“Now thaDao Master Nine Sword has been captured alive, the Ancient Monster Clan will be hell-bent on hunting down Jian Wushuang. Even so, that kid can only be killed by me!”

“Set forth, 10 Protectors!”

In this manner, Empyrean Patriarch led the 10 Protectors to the Divine Monster Territory.

At the same time, something was happening within the Ancient Monster Clan.

News of Dao Master Nine Sword’s capture by Jian Wushuang immediately reached them, causing the clansmen to shake with rage.

“Everyone in the Samsara Continent knows that Nine Sword is our darling. How dare you, Jian Wushang!”

“Luckily, I had left a mysterious crack on Nine Sword’s body a long time ago as a precaution. Since there’s still a reaction from it, he should still be alive.”

“I’ll go to fetch Nine Sword back personally. Along the way, I’ll destroy that Jian Wushuang.”

As such, Celestial Master Winter Whistle, one of the three Celestial Masters of the Ancient Monster Clan, set forth to rescue Jiu Xiu.

Since leaving the Bone Clan District, Jian Wushang had been traveling forward.

“Jiu Xiu!!!”

Jian Wushuang’s gaze was icy cold as he transmitted his consciousness into the Blood Mountain Sword. He also triggered a few Restrictions within the tip of the sword as well.

These Restrictions were brutal and could cause a lot of suffering and pain to the intended victim.

Jiu Xiu’s body had already been restored, but wave after wave of Restrictions began to torture him now. The deep pain he felt caused his face to completely distort.

“I want to know everything about my mother, as well as her current location. Tell me all of it, or else…” Jian Wushuang said.

Jiu Xiu managed to squeeze out a thin smile from his contorted face upon hearing his captor’s request; it looked extremely hideous. “Hehe, Jian Wushuang, are you taking me for a fool? If I tell you everything, would I still be alive?”

“You’ll still die even if you keep quiet,” replied Jian Wushuang coldly.

“Then we shall see who gets to die first,” retorted Jiu Xiu, looking very unhinged.

He was very clear that the reason he was still alive was that Jian Wushuang wanted to know about some secrets from him.

As such, there was a possibility he could survive if he refused to cooperate. After all, the Celestial Master from the Ancient Monster Clan was on the way to rescue him.

He was sure that Jian Wushuang would kill him outright without hesitation if he started speaking.

“You are indeed stubborn. I want to see how long you can withstand this torture,” Jian Wushuang said firmly in a low voice. He unleashed the power of the Restrictions again, causing the pain Jiu Xiu was facing to increase by many times.

Jiu Xiu could only try his best to withstand it. Also, there was someone else in the tip of the sword; he began shouting desperately now.

“Jian Wushuang, how you want to torture him has nothing to do with me! Absolutely nothing at all!”

“Your Restrictions are affecting me too… argh!”

“Halt, halt immediately!”

The person’s screams were pitiful and terrible. Evidently, he was undergoing huge torment.

“Oh, is that Su Ming?” Jian Wushuang sneered.

Many years ago, Jian Wushuang had trapped Su Ming, the traitor of the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor, in the tip of his sword, torturing him as and when he liked. After so many years of continuous suffering, the traitor had long lost his temper, and Jian Wushuang had lost interest in trying to make him suffer.

Today, however, Jian Wushuang had trapped Jiu Xiu in the same sword and began to impose Restrictions again. Even though Jiu Xiu bore the brunt of it, a small portion of it was still transmitted to Su Ming.

Naturally, Su Ming hollered as he started to suffer all over again.

Jian Wushuang, however, was not bothered by him.

“There are many Restrictions in the tip of the sword that can be used to torture, and they are all very powerful. It’s a pity that I can’t trigger some of them now,”?muttered Jian Wushuang to himself.

It had been many years since he obtained the Blood Mountain Sword.

It could be used to kill and suppress.

Jian Wushuang was fully aware of the sword’s usefulness in killing—it was even better than many Emperor Weapons. That said, he felt that its second function was even more exceptional. The only problem was that he was still unable to unlock the full potential of said function.

“The treasures my Teacher gave me are all unique in their own right, as if the Blood Mountain Sword,” he continued muttering.

“It’s indeed unique,” Gu King said suddenly. “Before, I also thought of it as merely a stronger Emperor Weapon, but I soon realized that it was so special that it was beyond a magic weapon, mostly due to its suppression capability.”

“Just this function alone increases its worth by a lot; perhaps, it’s even as valuable as the Blood-killing Plate Armor you obtained.”

Jian Wushuang could not help but laugh as he heard Gu King’s comments.

“The armor is an extremely rare and wonderful Chaos Magic Treasure. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“If the sword is of about the same value as it, it must be very powerful.”

In the entire Green Fire World, even some of the strongest Samsara and Void Temple Masters or Tang Emperor did not possess any Chaos Magic Treasure, but Jian Wushuang already had two. Besides, he also had an incomplete Mountain River Map, which could also be classified as a Chaos Divine Treasure.

“We shall keep Jiu Xiu in the tip of the sword for a while longer. I don’t believe that he won’t crack after receiving a certain amount of torture over time,”?thought Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, I’m afraid things are not as easy as you think,” Gu King’s voice suddenly rang out.

“What’s wrong?” asked Jian Wushuang, furrowing his eyebrows.

“I just noticed that Jiu Xiu had a mysterious crack on his body. If I guess correctly, it was purposely made by one of the Ancient Monster Clan’s Celestial Masters. They probably will be able to sense his location from the tattoo,” said Gu King.

“What?” asked Jian Wushuang, his expression changing.

Even though such a tactic was not very useful under normal circumstances, it would come in handy during emergency situations such as this.

It was exactly like the time when Tang Emperor had left a Mark on Leng Rushuang when she left. He then gave Jian Wushuang a token so that he could use it to find his wife if he went venturing in the Eternal Chaotic World.

The tattoo on Jiu Xiu worked in the same way. The Ancient Monster Clan had put it on Jiu Xiu solely to protect him.

“The Ancient Monster Clan can hunt you down easily as long as the mysterious crack exists. If everything goes according to my expectations, one of their Celestial Masters is already on his way here,” Gu King said.

“Gu King, can’t you get rid of it?” asked Jian Wushuang.

“I can remove it within half a day’s time if he doesn’t resist. If he does, it’ll be much harder to get rid of it,” said Gu King in a deep tone.

“It’ll take half a day even if he cooperates?” replied Jian Wushuang, frowning.

It was way too long; the expert from the Ancient Monster Clan would have caught up with him long before that.
