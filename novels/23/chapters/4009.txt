Chapter 4013: One Against Three

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

Bang! Clang!

Two sounds of collision rang out in the galaxy.

The black exotic beast that the second leader had transformed into rolled backward after colliding with the sword light.

As for the mighty sword light that the third leader had displayed, it also dissipated, and the power on the surface of the third leader’s body was greatly suppressed.

“You two are too weak.” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were filled with disdain, but he slashed out with the Wuqi Divine Sword again.

It was still a casual slash.

However, in an instant, a shocking sword shadow that seemed to be able to split the galaxy in half hung out.

This shocking sword shadow emitted a suffocating and terrifying power.

Even though the second and third leaders of the Void Star were both fourth-level Rulers, their expressions changed when they saw this sword shadow.

“Not good.”

The great leader of the Void Star, Ruler Mo Chen, who had been standing outside the battlefield, was also shocked and immediately attacked.

Whoosh!

A sudden explosion was heard in the Starry River. A human figure descended from the sky like a Peerless War God from the universe. He held a giant axe in one hand and instantly slashed down as if he was splitting the sky and earth.

The same shocking axe instantly collided with the sword light that Jian Wushuang had swung out.

The two terrifying forces collided with each other, causing the surrounding vast galaxy to tremble violently. The brilliant galaxy seemed to have lost its color under the collision of the two forces.

After a while, the power was completely exhausted.

Jian Wushuang was still standing in front of the universe boat calmly. In front of him, the three leaders of the Void Star were standing side by side. The three leaders no longer looked down on him, on the contrary, their expressions were extremely grave.

“This man is very strong!” The second leader said in a low voice.

“Indeed, if only second brother and I joined hands, we would not be his match,” the third leader also said.

“I used almost all of my strength in that attack, but I didn’t gain the upper hand in the clash with his sword light. Only a Ruler at the peak of the fourth level could have such strength,” Ruler Mo Chen said.

Ruler Mo Chen himself was a Ruler at the peak of the fourth level. However, Jian Wushuang was not at a disadvantage in a head-on confrontation with him. His battle strength was naturally at the peak of the fourth level.

“Finally, someone who can stand out is here.” Jian Wushuang looked at the three people in front of him with a faint smile.

“Big brother, this kid is not weak. The three of us working together might be able to kill him,” the second leader said directly.

“Then let’s attack together.” Ruler Mo Chen’s eyes were cold. In the next moment…buzz!

A vast and surging dark air current swept out directly. This dark air current was cold, dark, and despairing.

As the dark air current swept out, the brilliant galaxy was covered in endless darkness. Endless dark air current filled the surrounding void, in the center of the dark air current, Ruler Mo Chen was the supreme God who controlled the endless darkness.

Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!

Ruler Mo Chen attacked directly. He held a giant axe in each hand. The two giant axes were both dark and cold. In the endless dark void, one after another, ice-cold axe shadows flashed and slashed toward Jian Wushuang. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

They were extremely fast!

Moreover, each of the axe shadows was extremely powerful. Even Jian Wushuang did not dare to underestimate them.

“Interesting.”

Jian Wushuang smiled and waved the Wuqi Divine Sword in his hand. He also slashed out sword lights that contained the profound universe origin of sword principle, easily blocking the axe shadows.

Around them, the second and third leaders were not idle either. The second leader transformed into a black exotic beast, which emitted a monstrous evil aura and directly merged into the Dark Void. Even with Jian Wushuang’s soul power, they could not even feel his presence.

Under the cover of the Dark Void, the second leader would strike from time to time with a fatal blow.

As for the third leader, his strength had also increased to a certain extent under the dark void. His figure soared like a heavenly demon descending into the world, and he directly slashed out with his huge saber.

The three leaders of the Void Temple, the three Rulers of the fourth level, all used their full strength at this moment. Naturally, their goal was to kill Jian Wushuang.

It had to be said that the three leaders were indeed very strong, and they cooperated very well. When the three of them joined hands, they could completely suppress an ordinary Ruler of the peak of the fourth level.

Now, when the three of them joined hands and went all out, Jian Wushuang seemed to have been completely suppressed by the three of them.

In the boundless dark void, Jian Wushuang just kept using his swordsmanship to resist the attacks around him. It seemed that he was completely trapped in the frenzied attacks of the three leaders.

After a while, Jian Wushuang shook his head and looked disappointed. “Is this the extent of your combined strength?”

“What?” The three leaders of the Void Temple were shocked.

It was indeed their strongest strength, but the Ruler of universe boat seemed to be very dissatisfied with their strength?

“With such strength, you are barely qualified for me to use my sword skills,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Use your sword skills?” The three leaders were stunned. They realized that from the beginning until now, the other party had only casually waved his sword and attacked casually.

However, the other party had never used any powerful sword skills or ultimate moves.

After all, the three leaders could tell that although the universe boat Ruler’s realm was low, his divine power was no weaker than that of a fourth-level Ruler, the point was that his comprehension of the origin of the universe of sword principle was too high.

With such a high comprehension of the origin of the universe of sword principle, how could he not create powerful sword techniques or ultimate moves?

“If I’m not wrong, the three of you have more or less improved your strength under the dark void. Moreover, the cooperation of the three of you depends on the dark void to a large extent, right?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were cold, looking at the three people in front of him, he said, “In that case, I’ll break the dark void.”

“And my sword is called splitting the sky.”

Jian Wushuang’s voice slowly sounded in the dark void. He raised the Wuqi Divine Sword in his right hand, and a terrifying power began to gather in his divine sword.
