Chapter 2388: Suicide

“All dead?”

Bai Tao and his companions’ hearts skipped a beat.

Even though they had guessed as much, they still felt incredibly hard to accept when it was a confirmed fact.

They did not feel too strongly about the other disciples in the group, but the crucial one was Luo Zhen!

He was the most outstanding disciple from Nine Stars Palace aside from Bai Tao. He was also Nine Stars Palace Master’s personal disciple, guaranteed to become a Peak Stage Divine Demon in the future and even had a high possibility to surpass Divine Demon Realm into a higher level.

The premature death of such a genius was truly a great loss to Nine Stars Palace.

“You lowly maid, be honest with me. How did Junior Brother Luo Zhen and the rest die? Who killed them?” Bai Tao stared at Miss Xiao. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“No, no, no, I think you’ve misunderstood. They weren’t killed, they...committed suicide!” Miss Xiao shook her head relentlessly.

“Suicide?” Bai Tao pondered for a second and immediately became extremely angry. “You lowly maid, are you tricking me?”

Suicide? Why would a respectable First-Class Divine Demon commit suicide?

What a joke.

“I surely wasn’t tricking you, it’s the truth. You may not believe me now, but very soon you will.” Miss Xiao smiled devilishly.

As she was smiling, her eyes started glowing with a faint red light.

It was so faint that if one did not look closely, it would not be seen.

However, the red light had special magic power.

Almost in an instance, Bai Tao, who was standing right in front of Miss Xiao and both First-Class Divine Demons behind him changed their expressions.

Bai Tao was slightly better than the other two, whose eyes became hollow and idle.

“I’ve already said that people do kill themselves. Even First-Class Divine Demons are like that. Don’t you agree?” said Miss Xiao nonchalantly, but her tone was extremely cold.

“Yes!”

The ones who answered were the two First-Class Divine Demons behind Bai Tao.

Their expressions became completely dull as Xiao Heng and everyone else watched in disbelief, they each took out a dagger before stabbing their hearts without hesitation.

The daggers’ power also broke all their internal organs into pieces while penetrating their hearts.

However, these two First-Class Divine Demons did not make a sound. They remained expressionless as they slowly pulled the daggers out from their hearts and collapsed together onto the ground.

Xiao Heng and the rest of them shuddering!

In the blink of an eye, the two First-Class Divine Demons who were still ready to seek revenge from Miss Xiao a moment ago had turned into two corpses.

Most importantly, what killed them was not anyone else but themselves!

They took out the daggers and stabbed themselves in the heart!

They really committed suicide!

“T-that...” Even Bai Tao was dumbfounded.

Even though he was the most outstanding genius from Nine Stars Palace, as one of the Twelve Minor Kings and a true cream of the crop, he had not seen such a sight.

That was a horrible sight.

“You demon, what have you done?!”

Bai Tao sounded hysterical. He wanted to cut down Miss Xiao who was right in front of him, but realized to his horror that he could even move a step. He was overtaken by a mysterious power under her stare.

That power rose directly from his own heart, gradually took over his mind, consciousness, and everything!

Fortunately, he was quite strong and mentally grounded. Therefore, he could somewhat pull himself together, but only after putting in a forceful effort.

Miss Xiao smiled mildly. “What have I done? I’ve already said, your Junior Brother Luo Zhen committed suicide. Since you didn’t believe me, I had to prove it to you. But don’t you worry, you will also kill yourself just like they did.”

“What?” Bai Tao was stunned.

Right then, he saw a shade of red.

The shade of red was projected from Miss Xiao’s eyes.

The very faint red light from before became extremely bright at this moment.

Against the red light, Miss Xiao began to look bewitching.

The powers that were eating up Bai Tao in his own body suddenly surged more than ten folds!

It only took a blink of an eye by force to break down his mind’s defensive line.

Standing on the ground, Bai Tao’s eyes started becoming hollow as well and his expression became dull.

A brief moment later, he flipped his wrist and took out his dagger just like the other two First-Class Divine Demons before stabbing his own heart.

Without hesitation or mercy.

In just a short instance, Bai Tao, one of Wusha Wilderness’s Twelve Minor Kings had followed his companion’s footsteps of finishing himself by committing suicide.

The empty field surrounded by the woods was completely silent!

Dead silent!

Xiao Heng and the four core disciples from Narcissus Island were completely dumbfounded.

They were scared to that point that even their bodies were frenziedly shaking.

The Three Big First-class Divine Demons including Bai Tao, one of the Twelve Minor Kings, died before them in the most senseless way.

From the beginning to the end, Miss Xiao did not raise a finger.

A glance from her was all it took.

She killed three First-class Divine Demons just like that.

What method was that?

Xiao Heng could not help but take another glance at Miss Xiao, the passion and craze in his eyes had completely vanished and been replaced with tremendous fear.

He could not think otherwise towards Miss Xiao anymore.

Now that he finally understood that this woman was not what he thought she was at all.

She was not a seductive beauty, but a terrifying femme fatale.

Next, he thought of what Jian Wushuang told them—that woman was not so simple.

They finally understood why Jian Wushuang would say that.

How simple could a person be, when she could easily make the Three Big First-Class Divine Demons commit suicide with just her glance?

Why would she require a few mere Third-Class Divine Demons to rescue her?

Not only Xiao Heng and the core disciples, but even Jian Wushuang was also secretly stunned by the method Miss Xiao utilized to kill off Bai Tao and his companions.

“Was that soul manipulation?”

“No, if it’s really soul manipulation, Bai Tao and his companions’ expressions wouldn’t look like that and Xiao wouldn’t have to kill them. From appearances, it seemed like some sort of bewitchment. That’s right, it was bewitchment!!”

Jian Wushuang raised his head and took a glance at Miss Xiao with fear in his eyes.

Right at that moment, Miss Xiao glanced over at him as well. The red light in her eyes was still there.
