Hearing what Qian Yu said, Jian Wushuang’s expression turned solemn.

“Never mind. It’s useless to talk about all these now. I will take you to the black tower. You will get it when you try it yourself over there.” Qian Yu looked at Jian Wushuang, “Just follow me.”

Jian Wushuang followed Qian Yu towards the interior of Star Island without any hesitation.

Under the guidance of Qian Yu, Jian Wushuang reached the foot of several huge dark towers after a while.

Jian Wushuang looked at those pure black towers in front of him. They should be the towers that Qian Yu had mentioned, but there were four towers.

And their positions were so weird.

Three of them stood side by side, but another tower was rooted on the steps behind the three ones, which looked taller and bigger.

“Blood Mountain, the tests in the black towers are divided based on the realm of testees. The first three towers correspond relatively to Divine Realm, Eternal Realm and Dao Master Realm. Your realm decides which black tower you should enter to be tested.”?Qian Yu said.

“There is a black tower for Dao Masters? What is it for? Isn’t it said that Dao Masters are not allowed to enter into the Stellar Fog Sea?”Jian Wushuang could not help but ask.

“Haha, you’re right. There is no entry for Dao Masters. But what if the testee breaks through the realm of Dao Master after entering Stellar Fog Sea?” Qian Yu gave a smile.

Jian Wushuang was dumbstruck.

Yes, only Dao Masters had no access to the Stellar Fog Sea. However, if the testee broke through the realm of Dao Master inside Stellar Fog Sea, such as on the Star Island, it could make sense.

“Qian Yu, you mean there are Dao Masters on this Star Island?”Jian Wushuang asked in surprise.

“Of course. There is more than one Dao Master.” Qian Yu cracked a smile, “There are five Dao Masters on this Star Island. They all broke through the realm of Dao Master after entering Stellar Fog Sea, but they are unable to leave if they failed the test.”

“Is it so?”Jian Wushuang nodded and looked up at the taller black tower behind the three black towers.

“According to what you said, the first three black towers correspond to Divine Realm, Eternal Realm and Dao Master Realm. How about the fourth tower? Which realm is it for?”Jian Wushuang asked.

“I don’t know.”?Qian Yu shook his head, “Except for Lord Spirit Sound, no one knows who can receive the test in the fourth black tower.”

“I only know that the five Dao Masters on Star Island are not qualified to get into that Black Tower. The Lord Spirit Sound once said that whoever passes the test in the fourth black tower will be the owner of Stellar Fog Sea and has the right to control everything in Stellar Fog Sea.”

“At that time, for people like us who are trapped here, our life and death will depend on the owner-to-be’s decision. If he is kind-hearted enough, he will release us. If he is blackhearted, however, we may get killed directly, remain trapped, or even become his slaves. Anyway, everything is possible.”

Qian Yu said casually, but he was already desolate.

Jian Wushuang nodded thoughtfully and then he walked towards the far left black tower.

“Blood Mountain, you went the wrong way. This tower is to test Divine Realm experts. The one next to it is for the Eternal Realm.” Qian Yu reminded him.

Upon hearing this, Jian Wushuang gave a smile but did not stop. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Took the wrong way?

Joke! He was a Divine Realm expert.

So it was well-reasoned to take the test in the black tower directed for Divine Realm experts.

Jian Wushuang came to the front of the black tower and prepared to set feet on the steps. However, a strong gust of resistance made him unable to move forward.

“How could it be?”Jian Wushuang paled.

He was a God and there should be no doubt that he took the test for Divine Realm experts. Why was he impeded?

“Is it because I use the Yin-Yang Mirror to conceal the aura?”?Jian Wushuang thought.

His aura was hidden by the Yin-Yang Mirror all the time, so Qian Yu had said he took the wrong way.

Jian Wushuang immediately manipulated and stopped the control of his aura by the Yin-Yang Mirror. His aura as a Divine Realm expert became visible.

Even so, Jian Wushuang was still unable to take one step forward.

He had no access to this black tower for Divine Realm experts.

“What’s the matter?”?Jian Wushuang felt confused.

At this time…

“Young boy, don’t waste your time. You can’t get into this black tower.”A cold voice raised from somewhere.

Jian Wushuang looked back at the source of the voice at once.

A good-looking and enchanting red-robed woman came over slowly.

Qian Yu was shocked when he saw the woman, and then he immediately bent down to salute, “My lord, at your service.”

“Lord?”Jian Wushuang was surprised.

The woman in front of them was the Lord Spirit Sound, the master of Star Island?

“You may leave.”Lord Spirit Sound glanced at Qian Yu.

Qian Yu nodded reverently without any resistance and left directly.

In front of the black tower, there were only Jian Wushuang and Lord Spirit Sound.

“What’s your name?” Lord Spirit Sound looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Blood Mountain.”Jian Wushuang answered.

“Blood Mountain. I believe you have known my identity and the rules of our Star Island from Qian Yu?” Lord Spirit Sound asked.

“Yes.”Jian Wushuang replied.

“Good. No matter who comes to Star Island, he must follow my rules with no exception. Since you are here, you only have two choices. One choice is to be trapped here forever just like other people. The other choice is to make a breakthrough in this black tower. If you pass the test, I willl set you free and give you some opportunities.” Lord Spirit Sound said.

“I get it.”Jian Wushuang slightly nodded and then he asked, “Lord Spirit Sound, as you see, I’m a Divine Realm expert. But why can’t I get into the black tower for Divine Realm experts?”

“Well, we all know you are a real Divine Realm expert. But more than that, you have another identity.”

Lord Spirit Sound gave a wee smile, and then she said very slowly, “You are an inverse cultivator!”

Jian Wushuang was so stunned.

“What?”Jian Wushuang’s expression changed, an unexpected sense of panic and terror overwhelmed him.

He was an exact inverse cultivator.

But only he and his friend, Emperor Xiao, knew about this.

Other than that, no one should know about it.

But now, this Lord Spirit Sound had pointed out he was an inverse cultivator at first sight!
