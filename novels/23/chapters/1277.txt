Chapter 1278: Fusion Requirement

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Kill! When there is a chance, kill Jian Wushuang to avenge the death of my disciple and Elder Zhuge!

“In addition, inform the Golden-sun Sect of this matter!

“Hmph, my Holy Prefecture won’t be the only one that is anxious to kill Jian Wushuang. The Golden-sun Sect also has to get involved in this matter!”

Universe God Jiu Hai ordered them.

While Universe God Jiu Hai was furious, a handsome purple-haired youth in luxurious clothes was sitting cross-legged in a huge cave mansion in front of a stone wall engraved with words.

“Jian Wushuang?

“A Universe Master killed Zhuge Qiu?

“Zhuge Qiu was very close to being a Superior First Heaven Universe God, but he was actually a good-for-nothing, so killing him was no big deal. I could have killed him with my casual attack.

“However, Universe Master Jian Wushuang is powerful. If he passes the God Test and becomes a Universe God, he will become my opponent.”

The purple-haired youth muttered with killing intent flashing through his eyes.

He was the peerless genius of the Holy Prefecture—Universe God Qing Yang!

He had never encountered a decent opponent since he started his cultivation.

Now, he had finally found a powerful opponent—Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang killed my junior sister, Jiu Xi, so our Holy Prefecture definitely will take revenge on him, but I don’t know whether or not he has the chance to die in my hands.” Universe God Qing Yang clenched his hands and showed a bloodthirsty smile on his face.

…

On Leopard-print Island, Universe God Qian Luan went over to Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang, the commander has ordered to have you immediately return to the military camp,” said Universe God Qian Luan.

“OK.”

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. He knew that those things had been revealed and that the Holy Prefecture would not let it go. If he continued to stay on Leopard-print Island, it would be no different from courting his own death.

“In that case, I’ll leave now. Leopard-print Island now depends on you, Universe God Qian Luan,” Jian Wushuang said.

Universe God Qian Luan responded with a smile, “Don’t worry. Only the Xiu State has been competing for Leopard-print Gem Mine with us. The previous fight has terrified them, so they won’t return any time soon.”

Jian Wushuang did not say anything further before heading for the military camp.

As soon as he arrived at the military camp, Jian Wushuang immediately went to visit Commander Man Yi.

“Jian Wushuang, you killed Zhuge Qiu. Your skills are really good!” Commander Man Yi stared at Jian Wushuang as if to completely see through him.

Jian Wushuang remained indifferent. “It’s just a coincidence.”

“A coincidence?” Commander Man Yi shook his head and asked, “Have you ever killed a core disciple of the Holy Prefecture before?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang admitted it to him.

Commander Man Yi laughed. “You killed a core disciple of the Holy Prefecture but came to my Scarlet Island to take refuge. You are really smart.”

Swordsman shrugged his shoulders, but he was quite embarrassed in his heart.

Faced with the Three Hegemons in the Dayu Region, he had already provoked the Holy Prefecture and Golden-sun Sect, so he had to turn to Scarlet Island.

“Don’t worry, since you are already one of my people, I’ll try my best to protect you and I won’t let the Holy Prefecture touch a hair on your head.” Commander Man Yi smiled heartily. “Now that these things have happened, the Holy Prefecture is definitely outraged about it, but I don’t know what they will do next, so stay in the military camp. You don’t have to take any tasks. Let’s see what their reaction is.”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded and left. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Then, he was brought to a banquet by Lin Dong and Mo You.

Jian Wushuang had been a new Divine General for a period of time and they should have held a banquet to celebrate his promotion. However, that celebration had been delayed because of the urgent task.

The other six Divine Generals on Scarlet Island went to the party. Even the two First Heaven Universe Gods personally attended, which shocked the other Divine Generals, as their own parties had never attracted the attention of Universe Gods. It was obvious that Jian Wushuang had a higher status than the other Divine Generals.

.

“You actually killed Zhuge Qiu, who is close to the Peak of First Heaven?”

Lin Dong, Mo You, and other Divine Generals widened their eyes.

The number one Divine General, Hong Shou, was the most astonished.

When Commander Man Yi said that he was weaker than Jian Wushuang, Hong Shou was not convinced and challenged Jian Wushuang, but he was defeated.

At that time, Jian Wushuang’s strength had frustrated him, but now Hong Shou realized that Jian Wushuang had not used his full strength in the fight with him.

Jian Wushaung was able to kill Universe God Zhuge Qiu. Having such strength, he could kill Hong Shou as easily as pinching an ant.

It was not until late at night that this banquet ended.

In a pavilion, Jian Wushuang was sitting cross-legged with the Blood Mountain Sword floating in front of him.

“Gu King, you said that the Blood Mountain Sword is a sword embryo and its strength improves through fierce battles. I can also fuse my unique skill with the sword embryo to enhance the power of the sword. I’ve created so many unique skills, but why is the skill unable to merge with the Blood Mountain Sword?” Jian Wushuang asked with a frown.

The Blood Mountain Sword was extremely precious.

Its improvement not only resulted from continuous fighting, but also from the fusion of unique skills and the sword.

After he invented his own unique skill, Jian Wushuang had been trying to fuse it with the sword, but he failed.

Gu King then spoke. “The Blood Mountain Sword is indeed the best sword embryo. You can fuse it with your unique skills as you grow. But you should choose the best skill at each level.

“Now, the Blood Mountain Sword is at the primary stage of the sword embryo, so it’s only able to merge with a rank one skill, the top one!

“You have created three kinds of swordsmanship, but of those three unique skills, even the strongest, Chant of Disturbance, is just an advanced rank one unique skill.

“Such a unique skill is not qualified to merge with the Blood Mountain Sword!”
