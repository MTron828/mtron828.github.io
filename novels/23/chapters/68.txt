Chapter 69: The First Win

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

SWISH!

With one chop, the air was immediately cut.

“So fast.”

Jian Wushuang was stunned, and he thought to himself, “They are undoubtedly Dragon Palace Disciples.”

Jian Wushuang was very calm. The movement was swift, but his sword was faster.

SWISH!

A dazzling glare of sword light fleeted. It was still the first blood shadow move of Formless Swordsmanship.

A clashing sound could be heard when the two swords met. There was only a slight gap between these two powers.

“You will be defeated,” Zhang Tao said in a low voice.

“Ridiculous,” Jian Wushuang replied with a laugh.

These two people began to display their power to its furthest extent.

One used the knife, and the other the sword. Their splendid speed reached its peak.

CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!

Numerous clashing sounds could be heard. The blade lights and sword shadows were extremely rapid.

Both Jian Wushuang and Zhang Tao sensed Sword Principle of Gale, and it was very powerful.

Zhang Tao had achieved the Fourth Level a year ago. Although it was not certain that he would achieve the Fifth Level, he had been able to fight with the level keepers in the Fifth Level for a long time.

Jian Wushuang did not have a deep comprehension of Gale Sword Principle, and he was not as powerful as Zhang Tao. But he had obtained a better understanding of Sword Principle of Gale during the two-hour cultivation in the Secret Land of Heaven and Earth. Thus he was no weaker than Zhang Tao now.

OM~~

The sword light moved and disappeared with the wind.

The third move of Formless Swordsmanship, Expeditious Maneuver.

“It’s Formless Swordsmanship, and it’s the third move!”

“Is this Expeditious Swordsmanship? Unbelievable!”

The surrounding Dragon Palace Disciples were amazed.

These Disciples were familiar with the first Sword Skill of Tianzong Dynasty, and several of them had cultivated the Formless Swordsmanship. All of them understood the high requirement of practicing this move.

“Formless Swordsmanship? So What?”

Zhang Tao roared. The saber in his hand split straight down with a bloody light flickering. It burst out in the blink of an eye.

The scarlet light of the saber hit the sword light. The sword essence changed suddenly as Jian Wushuang twisted his wrist.

It started as the Sword Essence of Gale, and suddenly became the heavy Sword Essence of Earth.

“What?” Zhang Tao looked pale.

“Sword Essence of Earth!” The Dragon Palace Disciples were shocked.

It was very difficult to comprehend the Essence Realm of Heaven and Earth, and someone comprehending two types at the same time, not to mention both at a high level, was rarely seen. Very few disciples in Dragon Palace could comprehend two types of the Realm at the same time.

The swordsmanship Jian Wushuang exhibited was obviously the Sword Essence of Earth.

Sword Essence of Gale converted perfectly to Sword Essence of Earth…

Sword Edge swept Zhang Tao’s sleeves, and rolled up his robe. Zhang was defeated in this battle!

“Lose!”

“Has…has Zhang Tao lost?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The entire martial arts practice field went quiet. The Dragon Palace disciples were shocked, some held contempt for Zhang Tao.

Wang Yuan was amazed too.

No one had expected this. A newcomer like Jian Wushuang could beat Zhang Tao.

Only Jian Wushuang, himself, thought this was very normal.

“Relying on the perfectly converted Sword Essence of Gale and Sword Essence of Earth, I have fought for a long time at the fifth level. When I went through the Dragon Gate Pass, I improved my cultivation of these two sword essences after just one hour of learning Secret Land of Heaven and Earth. Now I’m confident I’ll pass the fifth level. Zhang Tao, on the other hand, still has a way to go before reaching the fifth level. “

“It is natural that I should beat him, I even didn’t do my best …”

Jian Wushuang laughed at heart.

True, he had not done his best. If he had, it would not have taken so long to beat Zhang Tao.

Of course, he had his reasons for not doing his best from the beginning.

Zhang Tao had a gloomy look on his face. He was in agony. He had lost indeed, and with so many people watching. He could not change it. He transferred one thousand points to Jian Wushuang immediately.

When he saw that his pledge number had reached three thousand, Jian Wushuang smiled and looked around.

“Is there anyone who wants to fight with me?” he called out in a loud voice.

“Me.” An ice-cold girl stepped forward.

Although Jian Wushuang beating Zhang Tao was beyond the expectations of many people, it did not count for anything.

After all, Zhang Tao had only broken through to the Fourth Level, and he was not the top among those who were at this level.

“A dual is still a thousand points.” Jian Wushuang said.

“Good.” The girl did not hesitate. She shot at him directly.

SWISH!

A fierce blade slashed straight out. The blade’s extreme speed caused a glimmer of heat.

“Haha, come on.” Jian Wushuang laughed loudly. He moved his sword in a counterattack stance.

The girl had a high cultivation of Blade Essence of Raging Fire. She was close to the fifth level and even stronger than Zhang Tao. As she fought with Jian Wushuang, she soon discovered that Jian Wushuang not only had a strong ability using Sword Essence of Gale, but also the Sword Essence of Earth.

Sometimes these two swordsmanships were very fast and smart, sometimes they were heavy as a mountain pressing overwhelmingly.

Two great changes of the sword essence quickly suppressed her.

The fight did not last long.

This fight caused many disciples of Dragon Palace to sigh.

“If her cultivation of the Blade Essence of Raging Fire were higher, she would not have been suppressed, and she would have had a better chance of winning.”

“Yeah, he was just a little stronger than her.”

Jian Wushuang was just slightly stronger than the girl, everyone could see it. Hence, the third challenger was ready to challenge…

This challenger was much more powerful than the ice-cold girl. Everyone was expecting Jian Wushuang to be defeated in this fight. But the result was shocking.

A narrow victory!

The fight with the third challenger had lasted for nearly an hour, Jian Wushuang had finally obtained an extremely narrow victory.

Three consecutive fights had all been won. Jian Wushuang’s points went from two thousand to five thousand.

The Dragon Palace disciples’ expressions become a bit weird.

They were not stupid. It was rather coincidental to win three fights in succession with such a trivial difference.
