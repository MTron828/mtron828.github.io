Chapter 3726: The Troublesome Elder Dark Bone

Elder Dark Bone was too famous in this Star Field.

In the eyes of many experts in this Star Field, if one wanted to choose the strongest Principles Master, it would undoubtedly be decided between the Blood Sword Master and the Blood Saber Emperor.

However, if they were talking about the most troublesome Principles Master, 99% of the people would immediately think of this Elder Dark Bone.

This Elder Dark Bone was famous for his many tricks and was extremely difficult to deal with.

He had faced many Ruler-level experts on more than one occasion. He had even faced high-level Rulers directly. The other party had used all of his tricks, but he was still unable to do anything to him.

He had even dared to scheme against Rulers in this Star Field. Because of this, he had offended quite a few Rulers, but so far, he was still alive and well.

Such a person...even though he was only a Ruler of Principles, even the current Pupil Master did not dare to directly ignore his existence.

“Dark Bone, what are you doing here?”

The Pupil Master was not in a hurry to act. Instead, he turned his head and asked.

“This old man just happened to pass by and happened to see you, a high and mighty Ruler, acting against a Principles Master without any regard for your status. That’s why I came here to take a look.” Elder Dark Bone laughed.

“Just to take a look?” Pupil Master’s voice was low.

“Originally, I just wanted to take a look. However, after seeing that the person you are dealing with is this Master Guchi, this old man changed his mind.” Elder Dark Bone said.

“What do you mean?” Pupil Master’s expression sank.

“This Master Guchi has nothing to do with me. However, my relationship with the people from Star Palace is quite good, so I can only let you give me some face, Pupil Master.” Elder Dark Bone said with a faint smile.

Once these words were said, the surrounding people were all stunned. Even Master Guchi himself was incomparably shocked.

Elder Dark Bone said these words, clearly intending to interfere in this matter.

“Dark Bone, you want me to give you face? Hmph, you are only a mere Principles Master. What right do you have to ask me to give you face?” Pupil Master shouted.

“It’s fine. Since you don’t want to give me face, Pupil Master, then let’s see if you have the ability to kill Master Guchi right under my nose.” Elder Dark Bone laughed casually, however, this laughter contained absolute confidence.

Pupil Master narrowed his eyes slightly.

The entire world fell silent.

Suddenly...xiu!

A stream of light flashed, and Pupil Master attacked with lightning speed. A terrifying Ruler level aura instantly covered and pressed down on Master Guchi’s body, and his speed reached its peak, clearly, he was planning to use his fastest speed to kill Master Guchi before Elder Dark Bone reached his limit.

However, the moment Pupil took the initiative to move, Elder Dark Bone, who was standing at the edge, suddenly moved.

He simply moved, but it felt as if he had teleported directly across the battlefield. Before Pupil Master appeared in front of Master Guchi, Elder Dark Bone’s figure blocked in front of him.

“You’re courting death!”

Pupil Master’s face was cold, and the killing intent in his eyes rose sharply.

He held a long red rod in one hand. This long rod emitted an incomparably dense destructive aura as it smashed toward Elder Dark Bone in a mighty manner.

Elder Dark Bone was not afraid at all when he saw this. He waved his hand, and a cold blade light slashed out directly as if it was splitting the heavens and earth apart.

Bang!

The two collided head-on. Pupil Master was a mighty Ruler-level expert after all, and in terms of power, he was far stronger than Elder Dark Bone. This collision had shattered that blade light at the first instant…even Elder Dark Bone’s entire body was forced back a few steps.

“Tsk tsk, as expected of a Ruler.”

Elder Dark Bone stood up steadily, but his face was still smiling. His aura did not weaken at all.

“Dark Bone, since you intend to get involved in this mess, then you should follow Master Guchi and die together.” Pupil Master’s killing intent soared.

“You still want to kill me?” Elder Dark Bone chuckled, “It’s not that I’m arrogant, but in this Star Field, aside from those few apex Rulers, no one else can kill me.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Elder Dark Bone’s body suddenly flashed, and in an instant, hundreds of thousands of figures of Elder Dark Bone appeared in the Void.

These hundreds of thousands of old monsters all had the same appearance, demeanor, and aura.

The many Principles Masters who were watching the battle immediately used their soul energy to cover the area, but none of them could tell which one was Elder Dark Bone’s true body.

“An illusion?”

“Humph, it’s just a small trick.”

Pupil Master snorted coldly and waved his sleeve. Immediately, majestic godly power condensed in front of him, turning into godly power spikes that instantly shot out in all directions.

These godly power spikes were densely packed and passed through hundreds and thousands of Elder Dark Bone’s figures, but they didn’t cause any ripples at all.

“What?”

Pupil Master’s face changed. “Is his real body not among these figures? Is he hiding with the escape art?”

“No, if he really used the escape art, he shouldn’t be able to hide from my soul power.”

Pupil Master’s eyes focused.

The escape art could hide from the soul power of a cultivator.

Jian Wushuang had practiced the shadowless evasive skill.

However, this kind of evasive skill could be easily seen by an ordinary expert, but it could be seen by a real expert.

As for Pupil Master, he was a Ruler-level expert. If a Principles Master really used the evasive skill, it would be impossible to hide from him.

In this case, it meant that Elder Dark Bone’s original body was indeed among the hundreds of figures, but he could not find it and could not attack it.

“Hmph, even if I can’t find your true body, my target isn’t you in the first place.” Pupil Master snorted softly. Following which, his body swayed, choosing to ignore Elder Dark Bone and continue to charge toward Master Guchi.

However, just as his body moved… CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“I already said that it’s impossible for you to kill Master Guchi under my nose. You just won’t believe it.”

A mocking voice suddenly sounded beside Pupil Master, and the figure of Elder Dark Bone, who was the closest to Pupil Master, directly waved the battle saber in his hand.

This saber immediately slashed out a streak of light in the air, directly flashing toward Pupil Master’s head. Pupil Master’s figure had no choice but to immediately retreat, returning to where he had been standing before.

Once again looking at the hundreds and thousands of figures of Elder Dark Bone, Pupil Master’s expression had already become extremely unsightly.

Although Elder Dark Bone had only revealed a portion of his techniques during the short exchange of blows, this portion of his techniques had already caused Pupil Master to feel that it was extremely difficult to deal with.

Just like what Elder Dark Bone had said, if it was not for his consent, it was utterly impossible for Pupil Master to kill Master Guchi right under his nose.
