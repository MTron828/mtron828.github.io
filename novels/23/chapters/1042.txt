Chapter 1043: Great Commotion

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The pursuit caused quite a commotion despite having gone on for only four hours.

It was a great commotion, in fact!

It rippled through the Divine Monster Territory, and even the Samsara Continent.

“I’ve repeatedly warned Jian Wushuang to be careful and keep a low profile but it’s like he’s deliberately going around and causing trouble! To think that he’d once again suppress Dao Master Jiu Jian of the Ancient Demon Clan!” Elder Ding Mo of the inner hall of the Samsara Temple said with admiration, shaking his head after hearing the news.

“Jian Wushuang sure has guts. He killed Patriarch of Empyrean Glory’s son and then suppressed Dao Master Jiu Jian of the Ancient Demon Clan! Patriarch of Empyrean Glory is now going after him and the Ancient Demon Clan certainly won’t let him off either. Will he be able to survive this time?” Dreamless Dao Master followed suit in sighing.

“Jian Wushuang…” Dragon Wing Governor felt worried for Jian Wushuang after hearing the news. “Patriarch of Empyrean Glory alone is a formidable enemy, but now he has provoked the Ancient Demon Clan as well. Sigh! I hope that God will bless him.”

As high-level experts of the Samsara Temple, Ding Mo and Dreamless Dao Master naturally had gotten the news at once.

Dragon Wing Governor, being a man with great connections, also learned of the news as soon as they did.

The news traveled to the various influences, clans, and experts in the Samsara Continent at the same time.

“The four great clans of the Samsara Continent… the Blood Asura Clan.”

The Blood Asura Clan was the only one out of the numerous clans in the Samsara Continent that could rival the Ancient Demon Clan. These two clans were much stronger than the other two top clans.

The Ancient Demon Clan had yet to receive public recognition despite being “barely” considered the best population of the Samsara Continent.

That was due to the existence of the Blood Asura Clan.

Just then, inside the grounds of the Blood Asura Clan…

Countless pavilions covered every nook of a mountain that stood tall within an ancient forest that appeared endless at a glance. There was a beautiful girl dressed in black standing on the top floor of a pavilion that was so tall that it pierced the clouds.

Though the girl appeared delicate, her aura was strong enough to make ordinary Dao Masters to quake in fear.

The pavilion, located on the peak of the mountain, was most certainly the most important building of the clan. Most of the internal information that the clan gathered over its long lifespan was kept here. Naturally, this building was heavily guarded.

Even among the whole Blood Asura Clan, no more than ten clan members were qualified to enter this building. Only three had access to the top floor, and the black-robed girl was one of them. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The girl stood impassively on the top floor of the pavilion, overlooking everything below. She was deep in thought, with a hint of melancholy in her gaze.

Two figures flitted across the Void next to the pavilion. They chatted as they traveled through the Void.

The girl had intended to ignore them. But when she heard their conversation, her face changed.

“You’ve heard the news, I suppose? That infamous Patriarch of Empyrean Glory is now hunting down Jian Wushuang?”

The other chuckled. “How could I not know this big news? I even heard that Jian Wushuang suppressed Dao Master Jiu Jian of the Ancient Demon Clan, angering the clan so much that they’re also going after him.”

“Jian Wushuang sure is audacious!”

“Humph! Audacious? I think he’s digging his own grave! With Patriarch of Empyrean Glory and the Ancient Demon Clan teaming up, I don’t believe he’ll be able to escape!”

The ones talking were Dao Masters of the Blood Asura Clan.

They were fairly famous in the Samsara Continent and well-connected to boot. The great commotion and frantic pursuit sent such shockwaves through the entire Divine Demon Territory and Samsara Continent that they were naturally aware of it.

They were happily chatting when they heard a sudden whooshing sound and the girl in black appeared in front of them.

They were taken aback at the sight of the girl, and then quickly bowed to her.

“Paying our respects to you, Celestial Emperor!”

The Dao Masters looked exceptionally deferential.

“Which Jian Wushuang are you referring to?” the girl asked, sounding a little impatient.

Her question caught them by surprise but one of them, an old man with silver hair, immediately replied, “We’re not too clear ourselves about Jian Wushuang’s background; all we know is that he has terrifying strong battle strength despite being in the Eternal Realm. He’s strong enough to kill even Dao Masters in the Peak of Rank Three.”

“Moreover, it’s said that he’s from the Ancient World and very young to boot. It’s only been two thousand years since his birth.”

“Oh?” The girl’s eyes gleamed. “He’s from the Ancient World and it’s only been two thousand years since his birth? Yet he’s exceptionally strong?”

“Is it him?” the girl muttered to herself. Even so, the answer was firm in her heart.

The Green Fire World was so large, after all.

The Ancient World had gone through countless cycles of maturity and replacement. There would be countless men who were called Jian Wushuang. It wouldn’t be surprising to see two people with the same name and a similar cultivation age.

Uncertain as she was, she still decided to go there and figure it out.

“Mount Xiong!”

“Let’s go!”

The moment the girl decided to set out on her journey, silhouettes appeared behind her with whooshing sounds one after another. There were no less than ten shadows, all of them emanating decently strong auras.

The one standing closest to the girl was especially powerful. It was an apathetic, bear-like man with an incomparably tall and sturdy stature. His aura evidently put him above the level of Dao Masters; he was a genuine Celestial Master.

“I hope it’s him!”

The girl clasped her hands tightly, a hint of expectation peeking through her pupils.

The apathetic, bear-like man and the group of Dao Masters followed after her. They soon made their way out of the Blood Asura Clan.

Over in the Divine Demon Territory, above the vast Void.

“Swoosh!”

A blood-like Flowing Light streaked across the Void.

Then, a black silhouette followed, flitting across the Void just as quickly.

Jian Wushuang and Patriarch of Empyrean Glory were still engaged in a frantic pursuit.

It had been exactly four hours since the pursuit began.

“That brat… How can it be?”

Patriarch of Empyrean Glory focused on Jian Wushuang in front of him, looking displeased.

He had assumed that the secret skill that gave Jian Wushuang such speed and explosive acceleration would deplete the latter’s energy and greatly diminish his endurance. Now, he felt like he had been slapped on the face.

Jian Wushuang was still not showing signs of stopping after four hours and his aura remained incomparably strong.
