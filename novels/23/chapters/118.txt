Chapter 119: Boom! Boom! Boom!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Two meters above Quiet Moon Lake, a purple-masked assassin was floating and looking down with cold eyes. “Is he dead?”

The lake was quiet but Jian Wushuang had already sunk into it.

However, suddenly…

In the center of Quiet Moon Lake, a huge whirlpool took shape and began rapidly expanding to swallow the whole lake, which made the great lake crazily stir.

Beep! Beep! Beep! The sound of stirring water was spread through the area like a windstorm generating in the center of the lake.

“What happened?”

“What on earth happened?”

“What’s the whirlpool?”

Standing beside Quiet Moon Lake, a great many Warriors of the Gold Core Realm were astonished.

“Look! Look at the ground!” When that sudden cry sounded, those warriors looked down at the ground right away. However, what they saw made their hair stand on end.

At this moment, the vibrant earth was turning into a bleak one at an amazingly fast speed. The original deep green was gradually changing into a dry yellow. On top of that, there were even cracks slowly appearing on the ground.

Dull!

Silent!

Everyone was frightened.

While watching what was happening around Quiet Moon Lake, the purple-masked assassin above the lake became dour and then his eyes flashed with killing intent.

“Whatever he is doing, I will kill him.”

The purple-masked assassin reached out his right hand and heavily slap toward the center of the whirlpool.

A magnificent Spiritual Power was released. In an instant, a Massive Palm, totally generated by Spiritual Power, appeared on the lake. The Palm seemed to arrive from ancient times, exuding a very horrible smell.

“Hum.”

The purple-masked assassin hummed as his Massive Palm, like a small mountain, dove toward the core of the whirlpool, slowly exerting its power.

Warriors beside the Quiet Moon Lake couldn’t help holding their breath when they saw that Massive Palm.

But at that moment…

Whoosh!

Suddenly, a cold sword light rose from Quiet Moon Lake as it slowly magnified in their eyes, rushing upward.

Immediately, the whole area became thoroughly dark.

Only that sword light remained in the vast and extremely dark Void.

The sword light was ice-cold, dazzling, and destructive.

After abruptly rising from the bottom of Quiet Moon Lake, the sword light rushed toward the sky and instantly struck against the Massive Palm.

The sword light pierced into the center of the palm.

Bang!

An earsplitting boom reverberated through the Void.

Two kinds of horrible strength directly struck against each other, which immediately generated many tangible airflows. Then, those airflows were transformed into a blast wave that swept out in a destructive manner.

Hum~~~

It was just like a star exploding.

The horrible blast wave crazily rushed out in all directions. At that moment, the wave blew every Warrior of the Gold Core Realm who stood by Quiet Moon Lake hither and thither. Worse still, some of them directly spit blood and retreated.

The mass of trees growing by the lake was also swept away by the blast wave, many of which were instantly uprooted, while some of them directly broke at the base of their trunks.

The heaven and earth were in ruin and it seemed to be the end of the world.

“How did this happen?” That purple-masked assassin was totally astonished, looking at the soaring sword light in amazement. It seemed to be all-conquering as it directly pierced into the center of the Massive Palm.

A terrible piercing force violently radiated from the sword light. Within just a moment, the Massive Palm which he displayed with all his strength was directly split. After that, the sword edge swept out, shredding the palm into pieces.

Swoosh!

Even after splitting the Massive Palm, the sword light still rushed toward the sky with rolling Sword Essence.

And then, following that.

Bang!

A massive spray of water abruptly gushed out from the bottom of Quiet Moon Lake, and then a black figure directly rushed upward with an arrogant sword essence and an incredibly terrifying aura.

In the next moment, he had already appeared in front of the purple-masked assassin.

“Old bastard. You enjoyed it, didn’t you?” Jian Wushuang calmly looked at the purple-masked assassin. Although the assassin’s appearance could not be seen clearly, Jian Wushuang could infer that he was an old guy by his figure and voice.

“You…” The purple-masked assassin had not completely recovered from his astonishment.

“Now, it’s my turn.” Jian Wushuang’s cold grin resembled that of a blade.

Jian Wushuang didn’t show his Sword Arts. Instead, he sheathed his Triple-kill Sword. Then, just using his fists, he began directly punching towards the purple-masked assassin’s face.

Boom!

The outburst of terrifying power made a fearsome wind sound when Jian Wushuang waved his fist through the air.

Afterall, Jian Wushuang was currently using the Soul-Devouring Secret Skill.

by devouring nature and absorbing the natural power in the area for hundreds of meters, his Spiritual Power was pushed to the peak of the Exceptional Gold Core Realm.

But he possessed a Supreme Gold Core, which was a hundred times stronger than an expert in the same Realm.

After a complete outburst, his strength settled at the peak of the Exceptional Gold Core Realm.

The strength that radiated out was much more terrifying than the average Yin-Yang Void Realm.

“You must want to go to the hell!” Seeing Jian Wushuang directly use his fist, without any sword skills, the purple-masked killer raged and used his fist, releasing the peak of his strength.

At that moment, two fists were rushing towards a head-on collision.

Crack!

Only the sound of bones cracking was heard. Then, in the next moment, the purple-masked assassin uttered a grievous cry.

“My arm!”

Staring with extreme rage in his eyes, the purple-masked assassin was aware that the bones in his right arm were completely shattered. His right arm had been disabled in this head-on, fist-to-fist, battle.

“It is you that will go to the hell!”

Jian Wushuang thundered again and then immediately kicked towards him.

The purple-masked assassin was unable to make any response, heavily falling on the ground and instantly creating a one-meter-depth hole with his falling force. Afterwards, the killer simply laid in the hole while blood leaked from his mouth. It was uncertain whether he was dead or not.

Dull!

All the warriors around Quiet Moon Lake were dull. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

What did they just witness?

A Warriors of the Gold Core Realm defeating a supreme expert in the real Yin-Yang Void Realm, even beating him until he was almost dead in an instant.

Furthermore, he didn’t use his sword.

With a distorted face and bloodshot eyes, Jian Wushuang was dying to thoroughly kill the purple-masked assassin who lay in the deep hole with an unknown lifespan remaining. However, a frightening aura swept through the area, indicating that there was another purple-masked assassin.

All the warriors in the area stared with wide eyes when they saw it.

Another purple-masked assassin?
