Chapter 544: So Incredible

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Saint Realm?” Emperor Golden Snake stared at Jian Wushuang in shock.

He had just fought with Jian Wushuang and was quite shocked by Jian Wushuang’s strength. If it hadn’t been for the fact that he had comprehended a Dao, he would not have the confidence to defeat Jian Wushuang. But now, he was being told by Temple Master Pure Moon that Jian Wushuang was only a Saint Realm expert.

A Saint Realm expert was able to battle with him for two rounds and come out with a draw?

A Saint Realm expert could force him to go all out?

“That boy...” Even Emperor Fengxiao felt shocked.

When he was in Heaven Wing City and watched Jian Wushuang’s performance during the Divine General assessment, he was quite surprised by Jian Wushuang’s strength. But he had never thought that Jian Wushuang was only a Saint Realm expert!

“Jian Wushuang, do you think that your Aura-concealing Technique can deceive me?” Temple Master Pure Moon looked down towards Jian Wushuang and spoke.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang forced a bitter smile and then quit hiding his aura.

When his real Spiritual Power aura was released, the sergeants in the area immediately shouted out in astonishment.

“Oh my god, he’s really a Saint Realm expert!”

“He is indeed!” Emperor Golden Snake stared at Jian Wushuang, his facial expression changing immediately.

“Golden Snake, do you understand now?” Temple Master Pure Moon turned towards Emperor Golden Snake, “As a Divine Emperor, you’re far beyond a Saint Realm expert. Therefore, the condition of having a Life-death Duel is tougher. You need the permission of at least 17 Temple Masters.”

Emperor Golden Snake turned pale.

17 Temple Masters...

Altogether, there were 33 Temple Master in the Monster-exterminating League. At least some of them were cultivating in seclusion at all times and would not appear unless there was a massive Demonic Beasts invasion that threatened the human population with the danger of extinction.

Some Temple Masters were adventuring in the Monster Territory and rarely returned. They would not concern themselves with the Life-death Duel either.

The remaining number of Temple Masters was above 17, but who would agree for him to have a Life-death Duel with a Saint Realm expert?

It was obviously unfair.

“Jian Wushuang,” Emperor Golden Snake gritted his teeth and turned to face Jian Wushuang. “Don’t be proud. I’ll find a way to get permission from 17 Temple Masters. I’ll avenge Ling’er no matter what price I need to pay, even if it costs me my life!”

After saying that, Emperor Golden Snake bowed to Temple Master Pure Moon and immediately left with a wave of his sleeve.

“Alright, that’s the end of it. You can leave now,” Temple Master Pure Moon said before quickly disappearing.

The Divine Emperors also dispersed.

Before they left though, they looked at Jian Wushuang curiously.

“A Saint Realm expert with such strength. Interesting.”

“Jian Wushuang is so extraordinary. If he has a breakthrough and reaches the Cloud Realm, I’m afraid he’ll be stronger than us.”

“It seems that Golden Snake has to swallow the tough pill this time. It’s definitely impossible to get the permission of 17 Temple Masters.”

After the Divine Emperors dispersed, Zone No. 14 calmed down again.

Fang Han came up to Jian Wushuang at this moment.

“Jian Wushuang,” Fang Han had a complicated expression as he glanced at Jian Wushuang and immediately took out an Interspatial Ring. “These are the Monster Cores and treasures obtained by the sergeants while cleaning the battlefield. According to your position and your contributions in the battle, you get the largest portion, 10%.”

Jian Wushuang had indeed made the greatest contributions in the battle.

He had used the Realm Technique and slaughtered numerous Demonic Beasts. In addition, he had blocked the breach alone. It could be said that Jian Wushuang was the reason why the sergeants could kill so many Demonic Beasts in Zone No. 14.

No one would complain if he took 10% of the Monster Cores and treasures.

“Thank you,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

After cleaning the battlefield and disposing of the Demonic Beast bodies, the sergeants returned to the campsite.

Jian Wushuang sat alone in a tent, counting the Monster Cores he had obtained from the battle.

Monster Cores were much easier to obtain during a brutal war, so the number of Monster Cores Jian Wushuang obtained in this battle was astonishing.

It actually took him a moment, but he counted all of them.

“13 Rank Eight Monster Cores.”

“36 Rank Seven Monster Cores.”

“141 Rank Six Monster Cores.”

“And countless Monster Cores under Rank Six.”

After seeing the Monster Cores in the Interspatial Ring, Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled with excitement.

A large portion of the Monster Cores had been obtained by slaughtering the Demonic Beasts mercilessly, while the other portion had been distributed to him after cleaning the battlefield. Either way, the total value was quite extraordinary.

“Sure enough, war is the easiest way to get Monster Cores,” Jian Wushuang said and smiled.

Monster Cores were extremely useful in the Monster-exterminating League.

They were the only way to exchange the treasures in the Earth Core Palace and the Monster-exterminating Pagoda.

And the number of Monster Cores obtained by Jian Wushuang during the battle was enough to make even the Divine Emperors envious.

“With these Monster Cores, I can get the next levels of the Bone Fusion Technique,” Jian Wushuang clenched his fists in excitement.

That night, Jian Wushuang and Qing Huo walked side by side in the campsite. After the brutal war, the campsite had an intangible air of sadness.

Numerous sergeants died in the battle. The Monster-exterminating League had already begun to supplement the remaining force. It was estimated that in a few days, the under-staffed Armies and squads in the East Camp would be fortified to a reasonable level.

“Look, that’s Jian Wushuang!”

“Is it him?”

“Gee, I heard today that even Emperor Golden Snake could not defeat him, and it’s said that he’s only a Saint Realm expert.”

“It’s so incredible for a Saint Realm expert to be so strong!”

The sergeants looked at Jian Wushuang with awe and admiration. Many sergeants were talking about him in a low voice.

“Brother Wushuang, you’re really famous in the East Camp now. Many sergeants are talking about you,” Qing Huo said.

Jian Wushuang smiled but didn’t really care.

“Brother Wushuang, are you still worried about Emperor Golden Snake?” Qing Huo looked at Jian Wushuang.

“No,” Jian Wushuang shook his head and replied.

“In fact, you don’t need to worry about him. Even though he’s a Divine Emperor, you’re a Second-grade Divine General in the League. At the very least, he won’t dare to do anything to you directly. As for the Life-death Duel, he’ll need the permission of 17 Temple Masters. Think of the supreme position of the Temple Masters. Emperor Golden Snake can barely meet any one of them, let alone asking for their permission. It’s definitely impossible,” Qing Huo said.
