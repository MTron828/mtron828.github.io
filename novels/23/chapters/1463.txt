Chapter 1464: Jian Wushuang’s Plan

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

One of the four Kings in Sky Sword Prison, Blood Emperor, the top expert on the first level, his comprehension of Heaven Way had reached the first level of Doctrine Palace.

Such a top expert wasn’t someone Jian Wushuang could match evenly. He naturally stayed at a respectful distance.

He had been wandering in Sky Sword Prison for a thousand and three hundred years but he had never come across any one of the four Kings. The reason why he would wander in Darkness Mountain was that he wanted to look for a few Real Gods at the second level to fight to train himself.

But Jian Wushuang had never thought that Blood Emperor would invite him personally.

What did he want?

“In Sky Sword Prison, it is very dangerous. People continuously kill in order to leave this place alive. Real Gods like Real God Hei Xiu were nice to me merely because they couldn’t kill me. If any Universe Gods on the fourth or the third level who were weaker were to appear before Real God Hei Xiu, he would have taken action directly to kill him.”

“Blood Emperor has the ability to kill me!”

“Hence, regardless of what his purpose is, it’s impossible that I run to his crimson castle. It is no different from asking to die.”

Jian Wushuang muttered. He had already made up his mind.

He didn’t plan to bother Blood Emperor at all.

He would stay as far away as he could!

Unless he was confident with his power and thought he could deal with Blood Emperor frankly, he would then agree to see Blood Emperor.

Jian Wushuang continued to wander.

In the crimson castle that Blood Emperor was in.

“Master, Real God Hei Xiu replied. He already passed your message to Jian Wushuang on your behalf. However, Jian Wushuang doesn’t look like he intends to make a trip to Crimson Castle,” the lady in green stood before Blood Emperor politely.

“Doesn’t intend to make a trip?” Blood Emperor raised his blade-like eyebrows.

“According to the replies of experts in Darkness Mountain, Jian Wushuang doesn’t intend to visit Crimson Castle. He was still fighting with the experts in the region to train himself,” the lady in green reported.

“Hehe, the young man is quite smart. But, if he doesn’t come to Crimson Castle, can I take the initiative to find him in person?” Blood Emperor smiled coldly, “Tell the people in Darkness Mountain to keep an eye on Jian Wushuang and send his current location to me.”

“Yes,” the lady in green replied.

Then, Blood Emperor’s body turned vague and left Crimson Castle. He then plunged towards where Jian Wushuang was.

…

On a barren land.

A huge ax shadow appeared out of nowhere and pressed over mightily. Jian Wushuang was immediately tough against it with Crimson Light technique. In the end, he was forced to retreat by fierce strength.

“Haha, you live up to your name, Real God Jiu Fu. You’re really impressive. I learned my lesson today. Farewell!”

Jian Wushuang laughed and then turned to leave.

Real God Jiu Fu didn’t intend to stop Jian Wushuang too. He couldn’t kill Jian Wushuang after all.

In the void, Jian Wushuang plunged as he recalled the battle with Real God Jiu Fu earlier.

“The expert standing at the second level was really strong. Although I created a Real God unique skill and I am qualified to step foot on the second level, I belonged to the bottom among all experts on the second level,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

“However, with years of fighting experience, I have constantly improved in grasping Flowing Light Phantom. It shouldn’t be long until I reach the second stage. By then, I should be able to cast nine shadows and my power will increase tremendously, especially in terms of speed!”

“Until then, I should be able to start my hunting plan.”

Jian Wushuang stayed in Sky Sword Prison for a thousand and three hundred years. He had had his hunting plan long ago!

After all, it was impossible for him to stay in Sky Sword Prison. He had to figure a way out. As he wanted to leave, he had to hunt down the experts.

However, once he had revealed his power, especially his Soul Attack, he might cause a panic attack among experts in Sky Sword Prison.

A consciousness attack was too creepy and hard to avoid. An expert who was good at consciousness attacks would be far scarier than other cultivators of another level.

Most of the experts in Sky Sword Prison were of the third or the fourth level. Their defense power was extremely strong. However, their defense powers were mostly against physical attacks. Once they come across consciousness attacks, they would be the same as Universe God Long Xiu that Jian Wushuang killed before.

Universe God Long Xiu survived under the King’s attack, but he was killed by Jian Wushuang.

How would other people compare?

Hence, if the news about Jian Wushuang was that he was good at consciousness attacks and his consciousness attack was ferocious, and one without the consciousness strength of a Real God couldn’t resist if it were to spread, the Universe Gods in Sky Sword Prison would definitely keep their distance from Jian Wushuang. Everyone would keep a respectful distance and run away when they saw him. Who else would be willing to be a whetstone and fight against him?

Plus, there might be some Universe Gods who joined forces to kill him, to remove him as a threat.

Just like one of the four Kings in Sky Sword Prison, Heartless King!

She was a Real God who was good at consciousness attacks and extremely strong. Back when she first got imprisoned in Sky Sword Prison, she killed many Real Gods and Universe Gods with consciousness attacks, but in the end, the experts of Sky Sword Prison noticed her existence and kept their distance. Whenever they noticed that she was nearby, they would run away. Hence, Heartless King could do nothing about it.

Over the years, Heartless King was far from achieving the requirement to leave Sky Sword Prison.

“Heartless King was too powerful, too aloof. But I’m different. I am just a Universe God and the experts in Sky Sword Prison wouldn’t be bothered with me. Compared to Heartless King who was also good at consciousness attacks like me, I am at a major advantage because my consciousness has already transformed into Soul Power!”

“Once my Soul Power is launched, I can easily find experts who are hiding and kill them. Heartless King wouldn’t be able to do that,” Jian Wushuang sneered.

Hence, compared to Heartless King, his advantage over the experts on the third and fourth level was much bigger.

But because of that, Jian Wushuang never used his Soul Power since the beginning. He had been training his swordsmanship and close combat power to increase his overall power. Until he had absolute power to rely on, he would use Soul Power to conduct the massacres.

It was an opportunity that Jian Wushuang tailored when he had entered Sky Sword Prison.

Everything was going according to plan.

Then, he was waiting for his mastery of Flowing Light Phantom to improve to the second stage and cast nine shadows. Then, he would begin the massacre.
