Chapter 2908: Supreme Emotion Valley

——

“Jian Yi, are you threatening the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion?” Long Xingzi shouted.

“Yes, I am,” Jian Wushuang admitted directly.

He was not afraid of falling out with the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion.

Even when he came to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, he was already prepared to completely fall out with it.

It was because of this that he waited until his strength had once again greatly improved and he had sufficient confidence before he came to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion to pay a visit.

“To be so impudent in my Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and even shamelessly threaten my Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, aren’t you worried that you won’t be able to leave alive today?” Long Xingzi said.

“Hehe, Pavilion Master of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, you seem to be called Long Xingzi, right? When the Dragon-phoenix ranking was first opened, I carefully looked at it. Your name is on it and you are able to be listed on the Dragon-phoenix ranking. It seems that your methods are still impatient. At the very least, you have made a lot of contributions to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. Unfortunately, you have underestimated me. Since I dared to suppress your Elders in your Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, I naturally have absolute confidence that I will be able to escape unscathed!”

“If you don’t believe me, you can try later, but I won’t show any mercy. As for the final result… I can still leave calmly. As for you, I guarantee that more than half of the experts of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, including many disciples, will die!” But, Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice. There was absolute confidence between his brows.

Long Xingzi could also see this confidence. However, he could not help frowning. “Where did Jian Yi get such confidence from?”

Although Long Xingzi was full of doubts about Jian Wushuang’s words, he did not dare to be careless.

After all, this was the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. There were many disciples here, and each of them was a true God’s favored son. Each death was enough to make the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s heart ache. If they could not control the battle here… the consequences would be unimaginable.

Long Xingzi was hesitating.

But at this time, Elder Qin, who Jian Wushuang had suppressed in the Blood Mountain Sword, had already broken free from the time-space stagnation.

As soon as she broke free, she knew that she had been suppressed.

And then she heard the conversation between Jian Wushuang and Long Xingzi in the Blood Mountain Sword.

Now she directly shouted, “Jian Yi, don’t you want to know about Leng Er? Okay, I’ll tell you!”

Jian Wushuang’s heart moved, and his consciousness quickly covered the Blood Mountain Sword.

“Tell me, where is she going?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Humph, Leng Er is going to supreme emotion valley,” Elder Qin answered.

“Supreme Emotion Valley?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

“I’m afraid you’ve never heard of this name, right?” Elder Qin sneered, “Let me tell you, the Supreme Emotion Valley is a sect, and it comes from the vast third heaven. Even in the third heaven, in the core territory of the absolute beginning divine realm, the Supreme Emotion Valley is extremely powerful!”

“A top sect in the Third Heaven?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

The Third Heaven was the core of the absolute beginning divine realm.

The three saint realms, the four divine clans, and the octagonal heaven sect were the top sects in that territory.

The Supreme Emotion Valley was very famous, so even if it did not reach the level of the octagonal heaven sect, it would not be too far off.

“Shuang Er is going there to cultivate?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, of course, to cultivate,” Elder Qin said in a low voice. “The Supreme Emotion Valley is a transcendent sect. It’s hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of times stronger than our Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. There are countless cultivation resources there, far beyond what the Golden Crow Nine Realms forces can compare with. Leng Er’s talent is extraordinary. Only by going there can she fully display her talent and have more room to grow in the future!”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang frowned.

If what Elder Qin said was true, then it was indeed a good thing for Leng Rushuang to go there, and he had no reason to stop her.

But his intuition told him that it was not so simple.

“Elder Qin, let me ask you again. What kind of sect does the Supreme Emotion Valley belong to? How much do you know?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“How could I know too much about such a super sect? But last time, two disciples of the Supreme Emotion Valley came to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion because of Leng Er. I know something from them.”

Elder Qin paused for a moment and then said, “I heard that the Supreme Emotion Valley has more female disciples than male disciples. Besides, this sect has a special feature, which is that almost all the disciples have no partners.”

“No partner?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

“Yes, the great oblivion is to forget or even abandon emotions. It is said that there is a divine skill in the valley that can only be cultivated by people who are completely devoid of emotions and have not been touched by the mortal world. In addition, to cultivate this divine skill, one has to be terrifyingly talented. This condition is extremely harsh, and it is impossible for outsiders to achieve.”

“The Supreme Emotion Valley has experienced countless years and has countless talented disciples. However, only three people have truly cultivated this secret technique. Moreover, these three people are unable to truly cultivate that divine technique to the highest level, the highest level. However, not long ago, the Supreme Emotion Valley found out about Leng Er’s existence from God knows where. They personally sent experts to investigate. In the end, they determined that Leng Er is the best candidate to cultivate that divine technique. She has the chance to become the fourth person in the history of the Supreme Emotion Valley to cultivate that divine technique!”

“Therefore, the Supreme Emotion Valley discussed with the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. In the end, the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion decided to send Leng Er to the Supreme Emotion Valley to cultivate, and the Supreme Emotion Valley gave the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion a lot of resources. The resources were much more than the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion could imagine, and they greatly helped the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. Because of this, Leng Er was listed as the third on the Dragon-phoenix list!” Elder Qin said.

“Completely abandon her emotions? Does that mean that after she cultivates that divine skill, she won’t have any feelings anymore?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes.” Elder Qin nodded. “In fact, Leng Er doesn’t have any feelings at all. She’s cold to the extreme. She has always been like this, but for some reason, when she saw you, her emotions actually fluctuated.”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s face became unusually gloomy.

She could accept that Leng Rushuang went to the Supreme Emotion Valley to cultivate.

After all, Leng Rushuang was extremely talented and had a lot of room for growth. A top sect like the Supreme Emotion Valley was indeed suitable for her growth.

But if she went there, she would have to abandon all her feelings, which was not what he wanted.

“Shuang Er already can’t remember me. If I let her go to the Supreme Emotion Valley and cultivate that divine art, then the chances of her remembering me in the future would be very slim!”
