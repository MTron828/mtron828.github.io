4678 Leaving and Discussing the Sword Dao (1)

The Sword Immortal Ding Baiyi, who had comprehended the Sword Dao to the extreme, had appeared with a mighty Fairy-like appearance. His simple and pure Sword Dao had almost completely elevated the Sword Principle to a whole new level.

After the fight with Ding Baiyi, Jian Wushuang did not suffer any setbacks. Instead, he began to comprehend and chip away at the mysterious and obscure level. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

His own swordsmanship had long reached the ultimate level. He was bold and unrestrained, full of a sense of cold and aloof arrogance.

However, Ding Baiyi’s sword was the most ordinary of swords, yet it had also reached the peak of perfection. His every move, every form, and every release and retreat were simple and pure, as plain as eating a meal or sleeping a night.

However, it was this most ordinary move that had turned into a fatal sword strike that forced Jian Wushuang into a dead end time and time again.

Jian Wushuang’s current cultivation was to learn how to withdraw his power.

Ding Baiyi, the Sword Immortal from above heavens, had slept for 20,000 years. Jian Wushuang had also cultivated for 20,000 years in the divine pavilion on the Cloud Palace.

In order to have some fun in the dullness of the moves, Jian Wushuang planted a peach tree seedling in the center of the huge Dao Field in front of the divine pavilion.

In 20,000 years, the sapling had grown into a towering tree. The spiritual monsters nurtured in the tree would lie on the treetops every day and watch Jian Wushuang practice his sword skills.

One day, 20,000 years later, the gate of the divine pavilion opened, and Ding Baiyi, who was wearing a plain robe and had a pale face, walked out slowly.

He looked at Jian Wushuang, who was sitting under the peach tree with a smile, and said with a slightly displeased expression, “Hey, why didn’t you kill me then? Why are you torturing me all day?”

Jian Wushuang grinned and threw the True Sword, which was full of Immortal Qi, at Ding Baiyi.

Ding Baiyi took it and pretended to be mean. “You didn’t kill me when I was unconscious. Aren’t you afraid that I’ll kill you now?”

“Killing you back then was an unfair victory, and I disdained it. If you kill me now, it’s also an unfair victory. What do I have to worry about?” Jian Wushuang laughed. “Why? Are you a sinister person?”

Ding Baiyi was at a loss for words, but he did not know how to retort. With an angry snort, he leaped onto the roof of the divine pavilion with his sword in his arms and fell asleep.

Jian Wushuang ignored him and continued to practice his moves under the peach tree.

The reason why Ding Baiyi had fainted back then was purely because the space-time turbulence had unknowingly eroded his meridians. In addition, he had fought like he was on steroids from the start. To protect himself, his meridians had cut off the supply of Yan power. That was why he had fainted as if he had crashed.

This guy seemed to be seeking revenge, but because he was affected by the cold wind, after saying those harsh words in front of his enemy, he directly fell to the ground and did not wake up like a dead pig.

Fortunately, he had met Jian Wushuang. If it had been anyone else, his divine soul would have been destroyed.

In this way, another thousand years passed. Jian Wushuang did not slack off for even a moment. Even the simplest straight cut could be practiced for 100 years.

Jian Wushuang’s comprehension of Sword Dao had obviously exceeded Ding Baiyi’s expectations.

Ding Baiyi also gradually realized that the suppression he had received back then was not in terms of comprehension of Sword Dao, but in terms of pure realm…

Naturally, this self-proclaimed Sword Immortal had once again provoked a battle.

“I haven’t forgotten the main purpose of my visit. Are you going to wait for me to kill you, or do you want me to get it myself?” Ding Baiyi said coldly from the side of the training hall.

Jian Wushuang shrugged his shoulders, “There have always been people who wanted to take my head, but they all died in front of me one by one. If you want it, you can take it yourself.”

“What big words.” Ding Baiyi sneered. He took a step forward, waved his hand, and pulled off a branch from the peach tree, which still had peach flowers on it.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes narrowed, and then he reached out and pulled off a branch with a peach flower.

A vast amount of divine power rose in an instant and occupied the sky above the entire Dao Field like a frightened Dragon.

Ding Baiyi immediately released an even more terrifying Yan power and confronted Jian Wushuang from afar.

Yan power was a special energy that suppressed and contained divine power and void power. It belonged to the Great Yan Domain of higher Laws, and what Devouring Emperor used was Yan power.

Jian Wushuang did not relax his vigilance at all as he looked at the slightly thin white robe. He had practiced the Sword Dao for tens of thousands of years and was ready to defeat him one day!

“use your own sword Dao against me. Otherwise, I can guarantee that you won’t be able to hold on for the next ten breaths,” Ding Baiyi said calmly.

“Naturally,” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows and smiled. “Wushuang Sword Dao, the second move of Star River Lake Sea Sword Intent, River!”

Countless Sword Intent was derived from the Wushuang Sword Dao, surging and roaring like a Heavenly River, majestic and grand!

The Heavenly River flowed backward, and all of them charged toward Ding Baiyi with boundless might.

As for Jian Wushuang, he was standing in the middle of the Sword Intent like a mountain. He raised the peach blossom branch in his hand and slashed down!

“Interesting.” The corner of Ding Baiyi’s mouth curled up slightly. He stuck the branch behind his neck and faced the vast Sword River like a lightning bolt!

He took a step forward. The surging Sword River did not cause any harm to Ding Baiyi. Instead, he used the force to approach Jian Wushuang.

The peach branch in his hand instantly flicked at Jian Wushuang’s face.

If one were to slow down the speed of this seemingly ordinary sword strike, one would be able to see that it had definitely been used no less than 100,000 times!

100,000 strikes all turned into one sword move. What a crazy sword technique!

Jian Wushuang’s body slanted and he had no choice but to block it.

However, the 100,000 swords were so powerful and terrifying that they broke his defense and cut off all the peach branches in Jian Wushuang’s hands.

The remaining 50,000 swords were all nailed in front of him.

Even though Jian Wushuang’s divine body was indestructible, he still felt his chest tighten. If it had been a real sword and not just a tree branch, there would have been countless holes in his body.

However, Jian Wushuang was not discouraged at all. After forcing Ding Baiyi away with his divine power, he broke off another peach branch and cut at him.

The Wushuang Sword Dao’s bold and powerful attacks landed on Ding Baiyi’s peach blossom branch one after another.

It was as if tens of thousands of divine weapons were crashing down, and even Ding Baiyi felt a suffocating feeling in his chest.

“This fellow is really not bad.” Ding Baiyi was bewildered. Just as he was about to counterattack, the branch in his hand suddenly broke.

Jian Wushuang did not linger in the battle. He retreated and threw him another branch. “Again!”

“Then let’s do it again!”
