Chapter 789: Gifts Presented at the First Meeting

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

When Jian Wushuang heard the accounts of his three Senior Brothers, he found this thing rather funny.

“Desires nothing? Always follows his heart?”

“My Master is really a puzzle.”

“In fact, in our Ancient Sect, our Master is not the only one who is mysterious. There is another unfathomable man, and he is our Sect Master.” Xue Lingtian spoke again.

“The Sect Master of our Ancient Sect?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

It was true that the Sect Master of the Ancient Sect was very mysterious as well.

Jian Wushuang had joined the Ancient Sect a long time ago, but he had not met the Sect Master yet.

The daily errands of the Ancient Sect were all delegated to the Palace Masters of the Dao Palace. Even if the Ancient Sect encountered danger, as long as the Ancient Sect was not about to be fully destroyed, the Sect Master normally would not show his face.

Even the many Palace Masters of the Dao Palace in the Ancient Sect had not met the Sect Master in person in 10,000 years, let alone Jian Wushuang.

“I’ve followed our Master for over 100,000 years. But during this a long period, I only saw the Sect Master once. And the Sect Master left me the impression he was really eccentric,” Xue Lingtian said, scowling.

“First Senior Brother, you at least met him once. Third Junior Brother and I have never met him.” Purple Mountain gave a bitter smile.

At this, Jian Wushuang was also shocked.

The Sect Master of the Ancient Sect was honored as the top-ranking expert in the Firmament Territory. But no one had met him other than a handful of people. How could it be?

This was really weird.

“You guys, what are you talking about?” A soft voice suddenly fluttered in, then, Palace Master Xuan Yi slowly came in wearing a white robe.

Jian Wushuang and the others instantly stood up and bowed to Xuan Yi. “Greetings, Dear Master.”

“It’s okay, don’t be a stranger. No need to be so polite with me. Have a seat.” Xuan Yi said, waving a hand.

Jian Wushuang and the others sat down again. Xuan Yi also took a seat by the table and helped himself to a cup of wine.

“What were you guys talking about just now? I heard you chatting merrily.” Xuan Yi took a sip of wine and asked casually.

“Nothing. It’s just that the first time we get together with our Junior Brother we all became a bit more talkative,” Bai Hu said, laughing heartily. Jian Wushuang and the other guys also forced a smile, but they looked rather embarrassed.

They could not just say they were discussing how mysterious their master was, right?

“Yeah, I understand. Since it’s the first time you met your Junior Brother, being his Senior Brothers, shouldn’t you three give him some gifts?” Xuan Yi said with great interest.

“Gifts?” Jian Wushuang was a little taken aback.

But Xue Lingtian and the other two were not surprised.

It was perfectly normal to give a Junior Brother a gift at their first meeting. When Xue Lingtian first met Purple Mountain and Bai Hu, he also gave them gifts.

This time they knew they were going to meet Jian Wushuang, so they all prepared something as gifts.

“Junior Brother, when I got the message from our Master and learned that I was about to meet you, I put in a lot of thought and selected a gift for you. Well, here it is,” Bai Hu said at once. As these words faded, he took out a colorful fruit with a delicate fragrance.

“Third Senior Brother, this is…?” Jian Wushuang looked at the colorful fruit with bewilderment.

This fruit had seven different colors and even gave out seven unique fragrances. Jian Wushuang could tell at first glance that it was very precious.

“This is a Seven-colored Dao Fruit, a treasure that can facilitate the understandings of the Origin Dao.” Bai Hu explained. “I know you’re just a Divine Realm expert. If you want to reach the Eternal Realm, you have to choose one Dao and fully grasp its nine Occults. But now, you’re still far from reaching that step, aren’t you?”

“Yes.” Jian Wushuang nodded seriously.

To break through the Eternal Realm, an expert had to gain a thorough comprehension of the Nine Occults of one Dao. And this was the most basic thing he must achieve.

So far, Jian Wushuang had not reached this step.

Although he already made significant progress in World Dao and Slaughter Dao after studying for a hundred years in the Eternal Zone, he was still far from fully comprehending the nine Occults. The more he studied, the harder it became.

Jian Wushuang had an extraordinary talent. He had, after all, reached the Deification Realm. But despite his talent, this realm could not give him the same power of understanding as he experienced in the Heaven-treading Realm.

God knew when he could really master the nine Occult of one Dao.

He chuckled. “Haha, this Seven-colored Dao Fruit is a treasure that can substantially raise your understanding of the Origin Dao. Once you eat it, even if you don’t try to comprehend Dao on purpose, as it will gradually grow more powerful, you can certainly grasp the nine Occults of one Dao in a thousand years.”

“If you work a little bit harder, with your talent, you could definitely become an Eternal Realm expert in less than 300 years.” Bai Hu smiled.

At this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes sparkled.

He actually had no idea when he could make another breakthrough and reach the Eternal Realm. According to his own estimation, it would at least take him a thousand years.

But now, with the help of this Seven-colored Dao Fruit, he could save more than half of that time.

This was indeed a precious treasure.

“Thank you so much, Third Senior Brother,” Jian Wushuang said gratefully. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“You’re welcome,” Bai Hu said forthrightly.

“Third Junior Brother, since you already took out the Seven-colored Dao Fruit, if I don’t present something more valuable, I will not be qualified to be your Second Senior Brother,” Purple Mountain said with a small grin.

“Of course, you joined the Ancient Sect before me, and you are stronger than me. You’re supposed to present something more precious,” Bai Hu said, his mouth twitching.

“Luckily I also have prepared something for you. Junior brother, look…” Purple Mountain smiled faintly and waved a hand.

A figure over three meters tall suddenly materialized next to Purple Mountain.

This figure issued no aura at all. It was clearly not a living thing.

“A Puppet Fighter?”

Jian Wushuang and Bai Hu both turned to look at it. They immediately knew this three-meter tall man was a Puppet Fighter.

“Junior Brother, this Puppet Fighter is something I obtained by luck when I was adventuring years ago. It is at the level of the Eternal Realm, and what’s more, it’s at the?peak?of the Eternal Realm.” Purple Mountain elaborated.

“This Puppet Fighter is driven by Divine Gems. The power it casts depends on the number of activated Divine Gems. If it releases its full power, it can confront a human expert at the peak of Step Six of the Eternal Realm.”

“The peak of Step Six of the Eternal Realm?” Jian Wushuang was taken aback.

It was extremely difficult to cross each of the Six Steps of the Eternal Realm.

When Jian Wushuang went all out and transformed into an Ancient God, he could rival a normal expert at Step Four of the Eternal Realm. If he really got desperate and resorted to his most powerful trump card, he could even be a threat to an expert at Step Five of the Eternal Realm. However, this puppet was at Step Six of the Eternal Realm, the top level of the Eternal Realm.

And it was at the peak of Step Six!

Owning this Puppet Fighter meant he had a fighter at the peak of Step Six around him. You could imagine how rare this Puppet Fighter was.

“Thank you so much, Second Senior Brother,” Jian Wushuang said hastily.

“This Puppet Fighter serves no use to a Dao Master, but it can save your life at critical moments. Anyway, you’d better be careful with it. Make careful use of it. After all, it needs Divine Gems to drive this Puppet Fighter, so the cost can be very high,” Purple Mountain suggested.
