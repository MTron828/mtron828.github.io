“What?”

The red-haired old man was surprised. Then, there were Ancient God shadows that appeared from nowhere behind him.

“I have no time to mess around with you. Die!”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes dilated in shock. Then, his hands gripped Blood Mountain Sword tightly.

Vroom! Vroom! Vroom!

There were crimson sword shadows that appeared again and merged together flawlessly again.

Hong!

The sword shadow slashed down.

It was still the same move, Myriad Waves. However, with the support of Power of Star, the power of that move increased tremendously by a hundredfold.

“This…”

The red-haired old man’s eight eyes stared and he could feel the terrifying power contained in the stroke.

He could also tell that the stroke was beyond his endurance.

The red-haired old man smiled bitterly, then he gave up struggling.

Hong!

A swordlight swept across and everything shattered into pieces, including the Ancient God body that belonged to the red-haired old man and also the Ancient God shadows behind him.

In no time, everything resumed its tranquility.

Jian Wushuang stood on the spot and the Power of Star in his body dispersed. Looking at the empty space before him, Jian Wushuang let out a breath of relief, “Luckily, with the Secret Skill of Star Palace, I passed through the sixth level. As for the last, seventh level…”

“Jian Wushuang, don’t think about the seventh level now. If I’m not mistaken, the Ancient God that you are going to meet on the seventh level will be a third stage six-star Ancient God, also known as human Chaotic Real God level. Plus, the guardian on the seventh level will not only use all four unique skills, but the three secret skills as well. Forget about the fact that you can’t perform the Secret Skill of Star Palace temporarily. Even if you could perform it again, don’t think about passing it,” King of Venomous Worms warned him.

Jian Wushuang kept quiet.

He knew that he could barely pass the sixth level and it would be impossible if he wanted to pass the seventh level.

“As I have passed the first six levels, I can already obtain the four unique skills and two of the three secret skills. I should feel content.”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands and flew outside Star Moon Tower.

Outside Star Moon Tower, it was dead silent on the huge drill ground.

As for Star Moon Tower that was floating, the first level gave out intense dim light.

Just as Jian Wushuang flew out from Star Moon Tower, countless gazes were fixed upon Jian Wushuang.

Before that, as Jian Wushuang prepared to enter Star Moon Tower, the gazes were also fixed upon him.

However, the gaze was different.

Previously, the gazes were in disdain and sympathy. However, everyone’s gaze then contained unprecedented shock and admiration.

Passing the sixth level of Star Moon Tower, there was none among Ancient God tribe.

Jian Wushuang had created a miracle. He had made a legend!

“Jian Wushuang, can you feel the gazes?” King of Venomous Worms’ voice rang in his head.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded faintly.

He naturally noticed the gazes but he never worried about them.

Regardless of if these people pitied or ridiculed him, admired or respected him, he didn’t care. He only cared about his results.

Which were the four unique skills and three secret skills.

Jian Wushuang appeared before the altar and he bowed faintly at the lofty aura. He then said, “Misters, I wonder if I can join Ancient God Palace now to cultivate the unique skills and secret skills of Ancient God tribe?”

Hearing what Jian Wushuang had said, the six-star Ancient Gods seated on the top of the altar exchanged a look and became silent.

On the far top of the altar.

“Gu Jian!”

A deep, thick voice rang out. King Gu Yi was already on his feet. His expression was complicated as he fixed his gaze upon Jian Wushuang, “You… you are a mixed bloodline of Ancient Gods and humans. You shouldn’t receive Ancient God tribe’s recognition originally. But now, you’ve passed the sixth level of Star Moon Tower!”

“We of Ancient God tribe honor power. You are powerful enough and you are recognized by me, the King!”

“I, Gu Mei, recognize your existence as well,” Gu Mei stood up as well.

Both seven-star Ancient Gods acknowledged Jian Wushuang.

The other six-star Ancient Gods on the top naturally stood up one after another to show their recognition.

Then, King Gu Yi waved, “Ling Shan, bring this young man to Ancient God Palace to receive his inheritance.”

“Yes.”

Ling Shan nodded and then brought Jian Wushuang to Ancient God Palace.

After Jian Wushuang had left, everyone on the altar remained silent.

After a while, it was still King Gu Yi who broke the stalemate situation as he said, “Well, there’s an impressive young man born in Gu King City!”

“With the power of a five-star Ancient God, he passed the sixth level of Star Moon Tower. I am curious as to how this young man did it,” Gu Mei commented.

“Although he is a royal Ancient God, he never cultivated any unique skills or secret skills of Ancient God tribe. He naturally wouldn’t know how to perform those. When he was going through Star Moon Tower, his power of Ancient God bloodline wouldn’t be of much use. He would still have to rely on his human skills. However, even if a top genius among humans wanted to pass the sixth level in Star Moon Tower at Universe God realm, it’d be impossible. Unless…” King Gu Yi suddenly thought of a possibility.

“Inverse cultivator?” Gu Mei looked at him as well.

The two seven-star Ancient God did know some about humans. They had even wandered into human territory before. Naturally, they had heard of inverse cultivators.

From their point of view, only inverse cultivators could possibly do that.

In no time, the Ancient Gods that had gathered around the battlefield dispersed.

Although they had dispersed, they were still excited.

After all, they had witnessed a miracle with their own eyes that day.

The name, Gu Jian, had also spread across Gu King City like wildfire. In no time, his name would spread to other King Cities, or even the entire Ancient God Sanctuary.

…

Ancient God Palace, where there were palaces.

Ling Shan, a six-star Ancient God led Jian Wushuang to an ancient gold palace.

There were three engraved words on the gold palace… Unique Skill Hall!

“Gu Jian, this is where the people from Ancient God Palace cultivate unique skill. The four unique skills of Ancient God tribe are in Unique Skill Hall. They were passed down via inheritance of memory. You have ten years’ time. It depends on yourself as to how much you can inherit in these ten years.

“Ten years later, no matter if you receive complete inheritance or not, you will have to leave,” Ling Shan said.

“I understand. Thank you Mister Ling Shan,” Jian Wushuang said.

“During the transfer of your inheritance, you won’t have to worry that there’ll be anyone who will come to disturb you. Go ahead,” Ling Shan waved. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate and immediately entered Unique Skill Hall.
