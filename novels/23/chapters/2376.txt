Chapter 2377: Miss Xiao

Xiao Heng and the four core disciples stared back and forth at each other.

“If my guess is right, our target for this mission is probably this Miss Xiao. If we want to bring Miss Xiao back to Narcissus Island, we must find a way to contact her, and sending a visitation request is probably the only way.” Xiao Heng spoke to the four core disciples while lowering his voice.

“Yes, we can each contribute some Golden Spirit Elixir pills to make a total of ten,” said one of them.

The few of them had reached an agreement very quickly.

Throughout their discussion, they did not once ask for Jian Wushuang’s opinion.

It was until the moment for the contribution of Golden Spirit Elixir that Xiao Heng looked over at Jian Wushuang. “Jian Wushuang, we need ten Golden Spirit Elixir. Why don’t you contribute three?”

Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows. “Three? I alone had to contribute three and the five of you only contribute seven?”

One of the core disciples angrily stared at him. “What, are you not convinced? Kid, make sure you know your place here. If it wasn’t for Elder Wujian, a mere outer disciple like you wouldn’t be qualified to join the mission. Now we’re asking you to contribute three pills, if you run into trouble in the future we could help you a little, otherwise...”

Furthermore, don’t think that I didn’t know you could get a lot more resources than us core disciples because of Elder Wujian, even though you’re an outer disciple. It’s just three pills, you don’t even need it for the Chaotic Realm. So, take it out already!”

The core disciples including Xiao Heng spoke in a forceful tone.

Jian Wushuang’s lips curved upwards after listening to what they had said and taken out three Golden Spirit Elixir pills with the flip of his wrist. “It’s just three pills, here it is.”

“At least you know your place, kid.” Xiao Heng and the rest sneered.

However, they did not know that Jian Wushuang was quietly sneering too.

As soon as he received the mission, he had a feeling that it would not be a regular mission. There were no guarantees that they would not run into some big troubles.

At this time, he was actually observing their attitude towards him to decide how to reciprocate.

Now, all five core disciples were obviously treating him like dirt, even taking advantage of his resources.

Therefore, if they really were in danger, he would not care about the sentiments of being under the same sect and would not be very gentleman-like when he made his move.

“We have ten Golden Spirit Elixirs now, how should we send the visitation request?” Xiao Heng once again summoned the waiter.

“You can just write down the things you want to say in a token, seal it, and give it to me. I will have someone pass it to Miss Xiao unscathed,” said the waiter in black.

“Sure.” Xiao Heng nodded, took out a token right away, wrote a word on it before sealing it, and passed it to the waiter together with ten Golden Spirit Elixirs.

“Please wait, gentlemen. I’ll now submit your visitation request.”

The waiter in black went up to the second floor with the request.

“Senior Brother Xiao Heng, what did you write in the token?” asked one of the core disciples curiously.

“Just a very simple ‘Mu’,” said Xiao Heng.

“Mu?” The core disciples paused before understanding right away.

If Miss Xiao really was the Mu Clan’s Second Miss which they were looking for, she would then understand their visitation reasons and will probably meet them upon seeing the word ‘Mu’.

An hour passed in the blink of an eye.

Hundred Flowers Tower was still extremely lively. Like Xiao Heng, a lot of practitioners had submitted their visitation requests with ten Golden Spirit Elixir pills as its price and were all waiting for her answer.

Everybody was hoping the content of their visitation requests could move Miss Xiao into meeting them.

At that moment, the waiter in black who submitted the visitation request for Xiao Heng came back to them.

“Gentlemen, Miss Xiao invites you to gather upstairs,” said the smiling waiter.

“Oh?” Xiao Heng’s eyes lit up.

The other four core disciples immediately became excited as well.

They were excited not because they were finally meeting the target of their mission, but like everybody else in Hundred Flowers Tower, they genuinely yearned to meet Miss Xiao alone or to watch her dance in close proximity.

In fact, they were all conquered by Miss Xiao’s dancing.

“Gentlemen, this way!”

The waiter in black led them upstairs.

When the rest of the patrons saw them, they were all very disappointed.

They all wished that Miss Xiao could meet them, but she obviously accepted some other people now.

“Sigh, let’s go, let’s go. Till next time!”

“I’ve already submitted nine times, but couldn’t get through once!”

“Nine times is nothing, I’ve submitted 13 times!”

The practitioners all left while cursing under their breaths.

Everybody knew of Miss Xiao’s rules as she would only accept one visitation each time.

Now that Miss Xiao had chosen to meet Xiao Heng, they had no business staying back any longer. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The second floor, in a private room.

The waiter in black led Xiao Heng and his group to the door of her room before signaling them to go in by themselves.

Xiao Heng and his company, including Jian Wushuang, did not hesitate and stepped inside.

The room was delicately decorated. There was a round table in the middle and a partition screen next to the table. Miss Xiao was sitting behind it at that moment.

When Jian Wushuang and the rest entered the room...

“Xiao Li, you can go downstairs,” instructed Xiao.

“Yes.”

The obedient maid next to her left immediately as well.

There was no one else in the room other than the six people from Narcissus Island and Xiao.

Xiao stood up slowly and walked out from the partition screen.

“Greetings, young masters.” She bowed slightly.

“Miss Xiao, you don’t need to be too courteous,” said Xiao Heng immediately, clearly trying very hard to suppress his passion.

Although that was their first meeting, Xiao Heng had already been completely conquered by this heavenly beauty.

“Miss Xiao has seen the visitation request that we’ve sent and even invited us here. I take that you’ve understood the reason we’re here,” said Xiao Heng humbly while acting as a sophisticated gentleman.

“Mmhm. Gentlemen, are you from my Mu Clan family?” Miss Xiao raised her head with her beautiful and attractive eyes.

“No, but we were sent by the Mu Clan to bring Miss Xiao back,” said Xiao Heng directly.

“So I guess the Mu Clan has finally found me?” Miss Xiao’s body trembled as luminous tears discreetly gliding out of her eyes.

“Finally...”

Miss Xiao was trembling with excitement, giving the rest an impression of her gentleness and tenderness.
