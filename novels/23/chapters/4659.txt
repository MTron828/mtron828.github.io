4660 All the Supreme Martial Artists Gather

His chest caved in, and even the essence of the Invincible Supreme was instantly shattered.

The destruction of the life source meant that there was no turning back.

A stream of divine blood flowed out from the corner of Great Void Divine Emperor’s mouth and his face turned red.

“You will regret everything you have done. You won’t even have the chance to redeem yourself,” he said slowly.

Lu Ding felt both disgust and fear towards this man, who was merely an Invincible Supreme, yet had never shown the slightest fear towards him from the beginning.

Just as Lu Ding was about to consume him, an extremely sharp spear directly stabbed into the strange body like a flash of lightning.

Countless shrill screams rang out, and a vast amount of Blood Qi gushed out.

Great Void Divine Emperor’s tensed face finally broke out in laughter. The spear that had accompanied him in his battle for the eternal chaos cycles helped him get the final laugh in the end.

Lu Ding could not remain calm any longer and he crushed Great Void Divine Emperor into powder. After that, he used his divine power to seal the crack on the chest of his corporeal body.

“Damn bastards, all of you can go to hell!” Lu Ding was furious. He waved his hand and suppressed the entire Star Field, turning it into dust.

An Invincible Supreme of a generation, Great Void Divine Emperor, died just like that.

He, who had participated in several Great Catastrophes and did not die in the Offworld Battlefields, eventually died in the hands of the new Cosmos God.

The Star Domain collapsed, and the planes that had existed for countless chaos cycles finally vanished.

Lu Ding’s figure disappeared. He could not wait to rush to the Cangwu Platform. There must have been hundreds of thousands of Supreme martial artists gathered there, as well as several Half Ancestors.

…

After hearing that Jian Wushuang could possibly return from the Spring of Chaos, over 100,000 Supreme itinerant cultivators from all the Star Fields in the Divine Power Universe gathered here after several years.

Led by the Dragon clan and the Phoenix Clan, all the Supreme powerhouses who had participated in the last battle of the Great Catastrophe were gathered in front of the Cangwu Platform.

Their faces were no longer filled with the silence they had when they first entered the Offworld Battlefield, but with excitement and anticipation.

In just a short two to three hundred years, many Supreme martial artists who had yet to recover from their injuries had all come.

Not for anything else, but to hear some news about that person.

Feng Qi and the two Half Ancestors of the Dragon clan stood at the forefront of the army, in front of the Cangwu Platform. No one came close.

“Do you think he really has any news about Jian Wushuang?” Feng Qi looked at Long Yan and Long Chi with a frown. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Then why are you here?” Feng Qi asked, puzzled.

“We have to take a gamble. And I have a feeling that Master Wushuang is about to return,” Long Yan said.

Feng Qi curled her lips. “Then why do you think that no one from the Divine Life Palace came?”

Long Yan said, “They have their own concerns. Perhaps they will arrive soon.”

Just as they were speaking, the doors of the Cangwu Platform’s giant hall opened.

The giant figure of the Ancestarl Qilin form, which stretched for thousands of miles, gradually floated up into the sky, showing its Ancestor realm power.

Even Supremes felt a strong sense of worship.

“You guys are here,” the giant ancestral form opened its mouth and said kindly.

At this moment, even Feng Qi, who was extremely repulsed by Lu Ding, could not find any fault with him.

“I’ve already gotten some information about Palace Master Wushuang of the Divine Life Palace. Please come to the Cangwu Platform and find out what’s going on,” Lu Ding said as he extended his hand.

Feng Qi, Long Yan, and Long Chi looked at each other and then said loudly, “Cosmos God, there is no need for us to disturb you in the Cangwu Platform. We are all in a hurry. Please tell us about Jian Wushuang so that we can be mentally prepared.”

As soon as these words were spoken, more than 100,000 Supreme experts echoed in unison. It was obvious that no one had any intention of entering the Cangwu Platform.

Lu Ding’s giant form still looked peaceful. “I’m not too sure when Palace Master Wushuang will return, but recently, I’ve felt Palace Master Wushuang’s aura overflow from the Spring of Chaos.”

“So I’m sure that Palace Master Wushuang will return from the Spring of Chaos in the future. But even I can’t break the seal on the Spring of Chaos. That’s why I want to work together with all of you to break the seal and wait for Palace Master Wushuang’s return.”

Hundreds of thousands of Supreme experts were shaken at this moment. Only Feng Qi, who had participated in that battle, frowned.

As the extreme point of the Divine Power Universe, there was a high possibility that Jian Wushuang would come from the Spring of Chaos if he returned.

However, the seal was personally sealed by Old Master, and even Lu Ding himself could not break it. Could it be broken by gathering the power of more than 100,000 Supreme experts?

She always felt that Lu Ding’s purpose was not that simple, but she could not refute it at the moment.

“Let’s give it a try. Otherwise, there’s no point in us gathering here,” Long Yan said in a low voice.

Feng Qi did not say much. After looking around, she immediately walked into the giant hall of the Cangwu Platform.

Looking at the hundreds of thousands of high-level Supreme experts rushing in, the giant Qilin form remained calm and peaceful, but its lifeless eyes were full of greed.

“The more, the better. This way, my clay idol will fade faster…”

Feeling the warm energy coming from the jade brick under her feet, Feng Qi’s vigilance gradually faded.

“It’s best to be careful. Previously, the emissary from the Great Void Temple said that none of the cultivators who came to the Cangwu Platform returned. They have all disappeared.” Long Yan was beside her, using a secret voice transmission that only the two of them could hear.

Feng Qi replied, “I’ve also heard about it. Instead of letting him come to our door, I’d rather see what he’s up to.”

“Anyway, we must be careful. Palace Master Wushuang’s whereabouts are unknown, and no one from the Divine Life Palace has come. We have to be careful,” Long Yan said in a deep voice.

Lu Ding, who had already materialized, led the way, guiding the crowd.

The further they advanced, the more the ancient and resplendent walls around them shattered. Finally, the giant hall began to disappear.

What replaced it was a broken Star Field. In the center of the broken star field, there was a Spring of Chaos that gave off a dark blue light, rippling like a lake.

This was the ruins of the Rodu Star Field that the Qilin race had once controlled.

Lu Ding leaped forward and then stood on the Spring of the Chaos. Ten thousand rays of yang divine power flickered around him.

“Everyone, please lend me a hand and open the seal together!”

With that, the immense yang divine power transformed into the precious image of a Qilin and crashed into the Spring of Chaos.

Hundreds of thousands of Supreme experts also released their vast divine power at this moment.

A power that was enough to destroy the world exploded above the Spring of Chaos.

The indescribable explosion instantly tore through the imprisonment barrier.

Countless strange energies gushed out like a river flowing backward.

At this moment, the entire billions of miles of space was shrouded in a strange aura that had never been seen before.
