Chapter 1392: Kill!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Buzz!

A cold sword light suddenly flashed.

During his years in Tian Ling land, he had been practicing the manipulation method of consciousness. He had almost never used his sword before.

His swordsmanship maintained its standard when he was in Lineage of Star. His creation stopped at beginner rank three unique skill.

However, the beginner rank three unique skill was still rather scary to a three-starred Soul Master.

“So fast. So furious!”

There was a flash of shock in Bei Xiu’s eyes. There was suddenly an unprecedented danger that soared from the bottom of his heart.

What a Soul Master feared the most was fighting in close combat with a warrior of the same rank because they were not skilled with close combat.

In a normal situation, a Peak three starred Soul Master who got approached by a beginner level three Divine General would likely be killed directly. But then…

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang suddenly erupted his divine power and the Sword Principle that he performed let out a shrill cry.

Although Bei Xiu immediately formed a layer of consciousness blockage, a ray of sword light broke it like it was breaking dead wood at the very moment that the consciousness blockage was formed.

The cold sword light continued to plunge towards Bei Xiu’s skull.

“Sh*t!”

Bei Xiu’s face suddenly changed.

“Jian Wushuang, stop!”

“My mother is…”

Bei Xiu bellowed but he had yet to finish his sentence.

Psst!

The cold sword light stabbed through his throat.

“I, I…” Bei Xiu could barely move his mouth and his eyes grew dim.

Jian Wushuang was filled with a murderous intention.

“Your mother?”

“You’re going to kill me, why would I care about who your mother is!”

Jian Wushuang gripped his Blood Mountain Sword in his hand tightly and he looked towards Huo Yi and the two Peak three-starred Soul Masters nearby.

Huo Yi and the other two Peak three-starred Soul Masters saw that Bei Xiu had been killed and they were terrified.

“Hurry up and run!”

The three of them started running crazily without hesitation.

“There are still six breaths left. Kill all these people altogether!” Jian Wushang gave them a sharp glare.

In the process of killing Bei Xiu, he had merely used four breaths of time. His secret skill of Star Palace was still sufficient to support six breaths of time. The six breaths of time was for killing the three people before him. He knew it’d be enough!

Buzz!

An enormous amount of blazing quicksand swept out and covered the entire universe. It covered Huo Yi and the other two people who were running in a craze.

The effect of the quicksand took place and their speed slowed down tremendously.

Jian Wushuang first ran before the two Peak three-starred Soul Masters.

“Die!”

There was a murderous intention in Jian Wushuang eyes. Without holding back, The moment the two people got closer to the secret skill of Tian Yuan, sword light spurted out.

According to the strength of his Soul Power then, even if the secret skill of Tian Yuan wasn’t supported by the power of Star, the two Peak three-starred Soul Masters found it hard to resist.

With the support of the power of Star, the power of his secret skill increased by ten fold.

“Ah!”

The two Peak three starred Soul Masters gave out a blood-curdling scream. Then, the sword light went through their bodies.

After killing the two Peak three-starred Soul Master, Jian Wushuang moved and came behind Huo Yi.

“Jian Wushuang, no, Mister Wushuang, please let me live!”

“Look at our past relationship, let me live!”

Huo Yi ran as he pleaded for mercy.

“Past relationship? Such a joke,” Jian Wushuang sneered.

Huo Yi had schemed against him for Feng Ling Knack. He hadn’t taken their relationship into consideration at all.

Then, he brought up their relationship.

“Die!”

Jian Wushuang didn’t hesitate and swept out a ray of sword light. With the assistance of blaze quicksand, he killed Huo Yi directly.

Swoosh!

Jian Wushuang finally stopped and the surrounding blaze quicksand dispersed.

Everything resumed its tranquility.

“Phew!”

“Ten breaths time, just nice.”

Jian Wushuang let out a sigh. From the time when he had really fought and performed the secret skill of Star Palace to when he had killed Bei Xiu and the two Peak three-starred Soul Masters, until he killed Huo Yi in the end, he had used ten breaths of time. The moment the time was up, his power of Star was exhausted.

“Huo Yi!”

Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold when he looked at Huo Yi’s dead body. His palm quivered and his body shattered into pieces.

Then, Jian Wushuang came before Bei Xiu’s dead body. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Bei Xiu, Peak three-starred Soul Master, a big figure who has friends in high places in Soul Island. You could recognize Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack and knew it was hard to come by. It’s a pity that you belittled me,” Jian Wushuang sounded so cold.

Bei Xiu really belittled him.

Actually, with Bei Xiu’s power, he could entirely fight Jian Wushuang face to face. He could even wait till Jian Wushuang’s power of star ran out, then seize the chance to defeat him and kill him.

However, from the very beginning, or to be exact, when Bei Xiu saw Jian Wushuang in Soul Island for the very first time, he had already belittled Jian Wushuang.

He thought Jian Wushuang was just an ordinary Peak three-starred Soul Master and he got the Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack by luck. He thought with his power alone, along with the two Peak three starred Soul Master, he could easily win against Jian Wushuang.

He didn’t know that Jian Wushuang wasn’t like other ordinary people, but an enduring genius who came from outside of Tian Ling Land and was directly under the command of the Lineage of Star.

Not only was he a Soul Master, he was also a terrifying warrior!

In his hand, he held many trump cards.

His consciousness had already transformed into Soul Power.

Everything brought up Jian Wushuang’s power, which was extremely fierce.

However, for Bei Xiu, he never thought of those. Especially when he put his strongest technique to play, Jian Wushuang wasn’t affected at all and Bei Xiu was dumbfounded at the sight.

Later on, when Jian Wushuang showed his warrior capabilities, it was totally beyond Bei Xiu’s imagination.

Although he reacted in the moment, he was slightly slow in the end and Jian Wushuang had managed to succeed.

However, Jian Wushuang understood that if he were to be an expert from the Eternal Chaotic World with the same ability, the possibility of him succeeding would be much smaller.

Buzz!

The same strength swept out and Bei Xiu’s dead body was buried in oblivion. Jian Wushuang then took the Qian Kun Ring and long spear that Bei Liu left behind.

“Consciousness attack long spear.”

Jian Wushuang first looked at the long spear. The black long spear gave him a mysterious feeling and his senses towards consciousness became stronger.

“Actually, Bei Xiu’s consciousness attack wasn’t strong. However, with the support of the long spear, it became terrifying. The long spear is definitely a treasure. Now, it’s in my hand,” Jian Wushuang smiled. He wasn’t in hurry for the long spear to recognize him as an owner but he looked at the Qian Kun Ring.

“Bei Xiu has a strong background in Soul Island. I believe his family background wasn’t ordinary either. I wonder what other treasures are in his Qian Kun Ring and whether I can use them…”
