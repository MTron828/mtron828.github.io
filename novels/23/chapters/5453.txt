Chapter 5453 ¬†Guangmu's Recruitment

The stronghold, though appearing formidable with its countless treasures, lacked some power.

Moreover, the number of emperors here was fewer compared to Taiwu City, possibly only the top-level experts, slightly more than those in this realm.

As they roamed around, preparing to board the super teleportation array directly to the Elder Palace, a middle-aged man in a black robe emerged from a side hall.

Jian Wushuang had seen this person before, encountering him once in Beishan City and hearing his name.

Guangmu Tianzun.

A true core member of the Qishen Temple, someone who had once followed Qishen. However, upon seeing this group, Guangmu Tianzun's expression darkened.

Like the others from the White Tiger Temple, he harbored disdain for the people from the Elder Palace.

Yet, when he laid eyes on Jian Wushuang, a look of surprise crossed his face.

"It's you?" Guangmu Tianzun recognized Jian Wushuang. Due to the incident with Jian Wushuang's thumb, he had paid special attention to him.

Feeling that the other party was addressing him, Jian Wushuang immediately bowed respectfully and said, "Junior Jian Wushuang pays respects to Guangmu Tianzun."

Wu Zuo, who was walking ahead, initially intended to ignore them.

Still, since Guangmu Tianzun spoke, he had to halt. No matter how one looked at it, they were once Qishen's trusted subordinates.

Although Messengers and Divine Generals were just errand runners, in battles of Qishen's level, ordinary Universe Masters had to stand aside. Only a few Divine Masters were Qishen's right-hand men.

However, these errand runners shouldn't be underestimated. They often stayed closer to Qishen. Normally, it was challenging for even typical Universe Masters to meet Qishen, yet these people were always by Qishen's side. Even if it was just serving tea or passing a message, it was a supreme honor.

Guangmu Tianzun was also an arrogant person, with no good feelings toward the laborers plundered by the Elder Palace. However, for the Inheritors, he, like Wu Zuo, regarded them highly‚Äîthey were the future of the Qishen Temple. Y√¥ur favorite ùíèovels at n/ùíê(v)el/bin(.)com

Therefore, he treated Jian Wushuang with kindness.

"You coming back must have made Lord Zhen Ling very happy!" Guangmu Tianzun's voice was gentle, and a rare smile appeared on his serious face.

Jian Wushuang respectfully replied, "During the last encounter, I troubled the Emperors. I appreciate your assistance."

Guangmu Tianzun knew about the previous interception with Bai Yi blocking Bai Junwang. Later, Bai Junwang informed him that Bai¬†Yi's avatar had gone, evidently attaching great importance to him.

Temple Lord Bai Yi, leading the Four Great Secret Realms, can be said to have a myriad of responsibilities.

The main body guards the Earth Realm, and the other avatars are also crucial. In the Heavenly Realm, there are only two major avatars‚Äîone, the main avatar with the power of slaughter, presides over the White Tiger Temple above the Four Great Secret Realms, and the other wanders in the Heavenly Realm.

When intercepting Bai Junwang initially, if the avatar with the power of slaughter from the White Tiger Temple had been mobilized, it could have retained Bai Junwang in his peak period.

However, the White Tiger Temple controls the overall situation and generally does not take action.

In the Qishen Temple, there are not only the Four Great Secret Realms.

There are also many secret realms such as the Bloodthirst Continent and the Original Realm.

In some secret realms, there are many old monsters. The White Tiger Temple also has to guard against these old guys. Of course, now that Zhen Ling has revived, those old guys generally dare not invade the Four Great Secret Realms.

"No trouble at all, it's just that some people have short legs. Otherwise, you wouldn't have been taken away by Bai Junwang. It's good that you came back. This time, why not come to the White Tiger Temple? There are still some treasures in Zhongzhou. You can cultivate there!" Guangmu Tianzun mocked Wu Zuo's slow speed in front of Wu Zuo.

Since learning that Wu Zuo had been expelled by Zhen Ling, he even looked down on Wu Zuo a bit.

In ancient times, there were many disciples of Qishen.

Especially the named disciples, their status as named disciples was generally not as good as their Messengers.

It's just a good reputation.

Qishen's direct disciples numbered in the hundreds, and there were many at the Universe Master level among them.

Wu Zuo was only at the supreme-peak level back then, and he was not very prominent even among the supreme-peak level powerhouses. He could be considered a powerhouse in the supreme-peak level, but not at the pinnacle.

Another factor is potential. Wu Zuo had only reached the supreme-peak level after a long time under Qishen. His chances of advancing further were already very slim.

Most importantly, all the other disciples followed Qishen into God's Tomb, and only Wu Zuo, a registered disciple, survived.

This was a thorn in Jian Wushuang's heart.

The same thorn pierced through Guangmu Tianzun's heart as well.

He was a Messenger and a Guardian. With Qishen's fall, he, as a Guardian, still survived‚Äîa source of shame.

So, the two mutually looked down on each other.

Facing Guangmu's sarcasm, Wu Zuo couldn't tolerate it. He immediately retorted, "There's no need to trouble you, Tianzun Guangmu. The cultivation grounds of my Elder Palace are no worse than those in Zhongzhou!"

"Oh really? I heard that your Elder Palace has looted the Northern Region so thoroughly that not even a complete brick can be found. You indeed have a lot of treasures!" Guangmu Tianzun sneered.

The elders of the Elder Palace were miserly to the extreme. They had recently gained some power and shamelessly exploited the Northern Region, leaving its people in unbearable misery.

Wu Zuo had been wandering outside for years, enduring a life of poverty. Eventually, he also resorted to looting. Especially the Law Enforcement Hall, which often arbitrarily imposed baseless charges on certain sects and then ransacked their homes.

All Emperors were executed, and those below were sent to the icy mines on the extreme north of Bingpo Mountain.

Initially, many sects resisted together, but Wu Zuo intervened and severely wounded a supreme-peak level expert, instantly suppressing the matter.

The strong in the Northern Region were limited, and there were only two or three spureme-peak level experts. Also, they were only ordinary experts, unable to compare with Wu Zuo.

Wu Zuo's Dao was the perfect Origin Source Dao. Moreover, he practiced the secret techniques taught by Qishen. His strength was unparalleled, far surpassing those supreme-peak level experts in the secret realms.

In the past, his true self could even suppress Guangmu and Bai Yi's avatars , which was sufficient to prove his strength.

Guangmu Tianzun, also a top-notch supreme-peak level expert, was still no match for Wu Zuo when teamed up with Bai Yi's avatar.

After Wu Zuo's strength recovered, it had nearly approached the peak level. Within the Qishen Temple, aside from the ancient monsters that were imprisoned, only the four Temple Masters could rival him.

Of course, among the Inheritors, Shang could also rival him.

If ranked, it would be around the top ten.

Shang's strength now matched that of the four Temple Masters, making him an ultimate powerhouse among the supreme-peak beings. When he reached the level of perfect spatial and secret technique cultivation, it was feared that within the Qishen Temple, no one except Zhen Ling would be Shang's match.

That's the terrifying aspect of the Iltimate Emperor.

Figures like the four Temple Masters and Shan Jun, who were considered quite exceptional, were still unable to reach the invincible level.

In ancient times, Ultimate Emperors who could reach the invincible status were rare, even fewer than Universe Masters.

Emperor Jueyun was an exception, surpassing the invincible Emperors and approaching the level of a Universe Master.

This was why Wu Zuo and Guangmu valued Inheritors like Jian Wushuang so much.
