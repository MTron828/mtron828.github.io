4413 Battle!

In the universe, stars flickered and it was vast and boundless.

Among them, there was a group of small planets in the depths of the universe. There were thousands of stars of various sizes in this group of small planets. All kinds of people from all walks of life and extremely evil people were gathered in this group of small planets.

Therefore, this minor planetary system was also known as the sin Starfield.

The Blood Sky Palace was built in sin Starfield.

Among the top powers of the universe, the Blood Sky Palace was not considered strong. Firstly, the highest cultivation in the entire power was only the Blood Sky Palace Master, who was a top Supreme. Secondly, the Blood Sky Palace had a shallow foundation and had not been passed down for generations. It lacked a solid foundation.

However, the Blood Sky Hall was definitely the most difficult force to deal with.

They were like venomous snakes that lived in the dark corners. Once they targeted someone, they would be like gangrene attached to the bone, never stopping until one of them died.

Therefore, very few people in the universe were willing to provoke these ‘bugs’.

In the depths of sin Starfield, there was a Hall built on top of the poison mist swamp.

“Hall Master, this is the fresh blood food that has just been offered.”

There was no light in the hall. It was quiet and gloomy.

A black-robed man walked into the hall and spoke to the throne hidden in the depths of the hall.

A hoarse and tired voice came from the depths of the hall.

“Let out the blood food.”

“Yes.”

The black-robed man nodded respectfully. With a flip of his right hand, a Dark Iron cage appeared in the hall.

Dozens of Ultimate Rulers were locked up in the cage like animals, their faces filled with panic.

“Where is this place?”

“Quickly let me out!”

“My master is Supreme Nanming of the Nanming Galaxy. Let me go now. Otherwise, you won’t have a good time when my master comes to you!”

“I beg you, please let me go.”

All of a sudden, curses and pleas for mercy sounded one after another.

However, the more they shouted, the more uneasy they felt.

The next moment.

A ray of blood light suddenly shot out from the depths of the hall, and then rolled back, rolling the entire Darksteel cage in.

Puchi puchi puchi!

Countless muffled sounds and shrill cries rang out in the hall.

A moment later, the shrill cries stopped, and a middle-aged man with an evil appearance walked out from the depths of the hall.

He was the Blood Sky Palace Master, the Blood Sky Supreme.

“Blood Seven, the quality of the recent blood food isn’t that good.”

The Blood Sky Supreme’s lips were a little red. He licked the corner of his mouth and looked at the black-robed man as he spoke in a hoarse voice.

The black-robed man laughed bitterly and replied, “Hall Master, all the talented young ones in sin Starfield have been eaten up. If we want to find new food, I’m afraid we’ll have to leave sin Starfield.” Jiang Chen said.

The Blood Sky Supreme waved his hand and said, “Then forget it.”

The black-robed man nodded, then asked with concern, “Hall Master, how’s your recovery?”

“How is it?”

The Blood Sky Hall Master’s eyes flashed with hatred when he heard this.

He had tried to kill Jian Wushuang twice. The first time, Jian Wushuang had been saved by the tyrants ‘patriarch, but he had also been hit by the latter’s punch.

Although the old ancestor of the tyrants had just casually thrown out that punch and did not carry any killing intent, his divine body had still crumbled from the impact and he was seriously injured.

After that, when his injuries were almost fully recovered, he participated in the battle to flatten the Divine Life Palace. First, he fought against Supreme Giant Axe and was forced to retreat. Then, he was bombarded by Jian Wushuang’s chaotic divine lightning, which caused his injuries to worsen. If he had not left in time, he would have been in danger of dying that day.

If that wasn’t the case, he wouldn’t be relying on a few Ultimate Rulers as food to speed up his blood demon body’s recovery.

“Damn Jian Wushuang!”

At the thought of this, Blood Sky Supreme became even more resentful and wanted to skin Jian Wushuang alive.

“Jian Wushuang, just you wait. Sooner or later, I will turn you into blood food. I will eat your flesh and sleep on your skin.”

After taking a deep breath, the Blood Sky Ruler’s resentment gradually dissipated. He gathered his thoughts and asked the black-robed man, “Blood Seven, have there been any strange happenings in the Divine Life Palace recently?”

The black-robed man replied, “Hall Master, the universe has been peaceful in recent years. The Divine Life Palace has been recuperating, and Jian Wushuang has not made any moves. He should still be in the Divine Life Palace, consolidating his supremacy stage.”

“Okay, that’s good.”

The Blood Sky Ruler heaved a sigh of relief. He was now in an extremely weak state, and his battle strength had fallen many times from his peak. He was afraid that Jian Wushuang would take advantage of this time to cause him trouble.

The entire universe was well aware of Jian Wushuang’s talent and power. Although he had just broken through to the elementary Supreme realm, many people in the universe had classified his power as that of an advanced Supreme. Some people even bragged that Jian Wushuang already had the battle strength of a top Supreme.

“Hmph, when I recover, I’ll be able to break through to half-step unparalleled Supreme. By then, I’ll kill Jian Wushuang no matter where I go.”

The Blood Sky Ruler snorted.

“I’m about to break through.”

The black-robed man, Blood Seven, was overjoyed when he heard this. He quickly knelt down and congratulated, “Then, I shall congratulate the Hall Master first. I wish the Hall Master to rule the universe for generations to come!”

The Blood Sky Supreme laughed and patted Blood Seven’s head. He said, “Blood Seven, seeing how loyal you’ve always been, I promise you that as long as you follow me obediently, you’ll be treated well in the future…”

Before he finished his words.

...

An extremely cold voice suddenly exploded!

“Die with you?”

Bang!

In the next moment, the door of Blood Sky Palace cracked open, and a cold-looking young man wearing a bamboo hat, a black robe, and a sword at his waist walked in.

“Who are you.”

Jian Wushuang!

Instantly, the smile on the Blood Sky Supreme’s face froze, and his scalp went numb.

Blood Seven did not react for a moment and was stunned on the spot.

“Blood Sky Ruler, long time no see.”

Jian Wushuang’s mouth curved into a cold smile as he spoke.

“Jian Wushuang! What are you doing here?”

“What about the Scarlet guard? Where are the blood Lord and blood Marquis?”

It was only now that Blood Seven reacted and screamed.

He clearly remembered that there were many Scarlet guard guards outside Blood Sky Palace, and the two vice Palace Masters, Blood Lord and blood Marquis, were in charge of the entire situation!

The two Deputy Palace Masters were both middle-grade Supremes!

How could Jian Wushuang walk into the Blood Sky Palace without a sound?

The Blood Sky Supreme didn’t say anything, but his expression was extremely ugly.

He knew without a doubt that the two vice Hall Masters, Scarlet guard and blood Lord, who were in charge of guarding Blood Sky Hall, had been killed by Jian Wushuang.

As for why it was so silent, it could only prove that Jian Wushuang’s strength was far above them!
