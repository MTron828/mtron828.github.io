Chapter 444: Four Marks

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Inside Marquis Beimo’s cave mansion, Jian Wushuang finally woke up from Cottage World.

The moment he opened his eyes, the world connected by the futon, wooden table, lamp, and painting immediately disappeared in front of him. The four objects returned to being ordinary.

“Amazing.”

Jian Wushuang called out.

“Marquis Beimo lived up to his fame as a top marquis. He must have reached great heights in World Origin to create such a wonderful Cottage World.”

“How long have I been asleep?”?Jian Wushuang was curious.

Because of the long slumber, he had lost track of time.

“Eh?”

Suddenly, he looked down at his right arm, where the power of World Origin was gathering.

“Am I about to condense another Origin Mark?”?He smiled.

It was a fantastic slumber. He had been immersed in meditating on the World Origin in such an efficient manner, and the outcome was satisfying.

A short while later, a new World Origin mark emerged on his right arm.

Similar to Slaughter Origin mark, it was shaped like flame, but this mark was purple.

However, the power of the World Origin was not disappearing. Instead, it started to condense a second mark, then a third mark...

In the blink of an eye, two more marks appeared on Jian Wushuang’s right arm.

Three Origin Marks was the symbol of an expert in Stage Three, and even those who were at the Heaven-defying Level could not form more than three marks.

For a long time, Jian Wushuang had been weak in comprehension of the Origin. After all, he had not been cultivating for very long. But, now he was finally catching up.

After the third mark was condensed, the power still remained and continued working until a fourth mark was completely condensed.

“Four Origin Marks!”?A spark flashed through Jian Wushuang’s eyes.

Before, he had only possessed one Slaughter Origin Mark, but now, after meditating in the Cottage World, he had four World Origin marks as well. That was to say, he had surpassed many experts at Stage Three and even the Heaven-defying Level.

With the power behind every mark, he was now several times stronger than before. He was above Heaven-defying Level, which he had reached while only relying on one mark, a strong body, and techniques like the Heavenly Creation Skill, Road to the Underworld, and so on.

“An ordinary warrior has to condense three Origin Marks and awaken his soul to reach the Heaven-defying Level. For me, condensing four Origin Marks by itself should be enough.”?Jian Wushuang pondered.

Of course, he didn’t forget that he also had a Slaughter Origin Mark, but the power from different Origins could not be combined, so he could only apply four marks at most. Nonetheless, it did not change the fact that he had reached the Heaven-defying Level.

Maybe he was even far above that level. With the advantages of theHeavenly Creation Skill and having strengthened his body in Universal Thunderbolt Pool, he was a dozen times more powerful than an ordinary expert, he might even be on a par with a lord.

Not only that, his Double First-grade Sword Soul and trump cards provided him with even more support.

As of now, killing an expert like Deng Huo would be a piece of cake for him.

“It is said that no matter how powerful an expert in the Saint Realm is, he has no chance of defeating a lord because there is an unbridgeable gap that separates them. However, I feel like my current strength is enough to destroy that belief.”

Jian Wushuang was filled with confidence. And, as he clenched his fists, his eyes seemed to sparkle.

He simply believed in himself despite the fact that he had not battled with a lord yet.

After standing up, he could feel an outpouring energy exploding in his body.

“It seems that I’ve been inside for quite a while.”?Jian Wushuang walked out of the Cottage World with a smile.

“Sir, you finally came out.”

An Feng came up to Jian Wushuang just as he walked out.

“How long have I been in the Cottage World?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Two years and four months,” replied An Feng.

“So long?” Jian Wushuang was amazed. The amount of time that passed was much longer than he had thought.

“Shouldn’t staying longer be better?” An Feng couldn’t help grinning.

Jian Wushuang was speechless. He handed An Feng an Interspatial Ring and said, “There are some Raw Gems in this ring. Please take it as my reward to you for guiding me while I was here.”

An Feng accepted the ring, and his eyes lit up after he used his consciousness to inspect the contents. “Thank you!”

“Sir, why don’t you stay inside a little longer? The mansion is so large, there must be some undiscovered treasures lying around. With a bit of luck, you’ll be able to gain even more,” An Feng added.

“I’m afraid I can’t.” Jian Wushuang shook his head and continued, “I’ve already benefitted greatly from these three opportunities, so I’m satisfied.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

He had other things to do, so he left the mansion that same day.
