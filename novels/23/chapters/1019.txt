Chapter 1020: Dao Master Dreamless

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Those spears…”

Jian Wushuang regarded the intimidating gold spears that pierced through the Void and left a damaged Portal.

Though shocked, Jian Wushuang managed to draw his Blood Mountain Sword, which was quaking with power.

“Ruthlessness!”

With a shout, he struck.

A stifling power blanketed the area.

The strike was ruthless and direct.

Clang!

The edge of the sword and the tip of the long gold spear clashed, shattering the void nearby. Jian Wushuang’s arms trembled at the force of the blows and he could not help but stagger back.

“His power is astounding!” Jian Wushuang exclaimed to himself.

In terms of strength, the Dao Master was far superior to him.

“Go!”

With another shout, Dao Master Dreamless lunged out with his gold spear again.

Chu! Chu! Chu!

He struck three more times, every blow fast and terrifying as a venomous snake.

With cold resolve in his eyes, Jian Wushuang brandished his Blood Mountain Sword.

Since Jian Wushuang had devised the Aurora Sword Principle, he was able to keep up with the Dao Master’s speed.

Clang! Clang! Clang!

Jian Wushuang’s arms shivered at the force of each blow.

“Humph!”

Jian Wushuang lashed out at the Dao Master’s neck with all of his strength.

“Death Shadow!”

Clang! Light flashed off his sword as Jian Wushuang launched an immaterial consciousness attack.

Dao Master Dreamless went still at the attack but recovered quickly and struck again. He easily warded off the Death Shadow and forced Jian Wushuang to retreat, once again.

Suddenly, the Dao Master’s fighting seemed to improve.

He struck continuously, sometimes stabbing, sometimes slashing, and sometimes even throwing out the length of his spear.

Every blow the Dao Master launched was formidable.

He was far more capable than an ordinary Dao Master at the peak of Rank Three.

“He’s too powerful.”

Though Jian Wushuang could keep up with his opponent’s speed, the latter was much stronger. Every time he blocked a blow, Jian Wushuang’s remaining strength dwindled.

All the consecutive strikes were beginning to test his endurance.

“Damn it, I can’t do it anymore!”

Jian Wushuang was pale-faced and trembling, and he could no longer ignore the sharp pain in his arms. All of his strength left him suddenly, Dao Master Dreamless lashed out with his spear.

The force of the blow dented the Blood Mountain Sword.

Vehemence gleamed in the Dao Master’s eyes.

“Ultimate Dragon-killing!”

Chuu!

A blinding golden light emerged.

The light shone like a golden sun before it barreled toward Jian Wushuang.

Everywhere the light touched, the void shattered.

The single strike of the spear seemed to destroy everything.

Jian Wushuang squinted at the strike and attempted to block it. His Blood Mountain Sword fell to the side and failed to ward off the impact, which hit him square in the chest.

Clang!

A clash resounded.

“What?” The Dao Master looked up in surprise.

A crimson mist from his robe covered Jian Wushuang’s entire body. The tip the the spear wounded Jian Wushuang, but failed to fatally pierce him.

Shoo!

The force of the blow threw Jian Wushuang back. He grunted from the impact and coughed up blood.

Jian Wushuang was wounded!

Even with the Blood-killing Plate Armory, Jian Wushuang was wounded by the spear.

It was the first time that he had been hurt after he became a Three-star Ancient God and acquired the Blood-killing Plate Armor.

Under normal circumstances, even with a direct hit, Jian Wushuang would remain unscathed. When Di Yan had landed a blow on Jian Wushuang, he was not only unharmed but had somehow caused Di Yan to break a tooth.

The fact that the Dao Master was able to wound Jian Wushuang was a testament to his abilities.

The observers, however, were amazed that Jian Wushuang was not more seriously injured.

“He’s only slightly injured after taking a hit like that in the chest?”

“My God, how strong is his defensive power?” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“It is really insurmountable!”

The crowd roared and bellowed.

God Hong widened his eyes. “I’ve awakened my Rock Demon Giant bloodline, and I’m a master in defense. But even if I became 10 times stronger, I still couldn’t ward off that blow. How is he only slightly injured?”

The crowd was astounded.

Even Dao Master Dreamless himself was surprised. “You’re not badly injured?”

“Dao Master Dreamless.”

Di Yan continued with a serious voice. “Even though you can’t kill him with one strike, he’s injured now, and all you have to do is continue to attack. Soon, he’ll be defeated.”

“I have to keep attacking?” The Dao Master considered the action, but his expression suddenly changed.

He noticed Jian Wushuang’s expression.

During the previous round of battle, Jian Wushuang must have known the outcome. Jian Wushuang was supposed to look shocked or terrified, or at least disheartened at being injured in such a fashion.

Instead, Jian Wushuang seemed pleasantly surprised.

Yes, he was surprised, perhaps even elated.

“That blow!”

Jian Wushuang yelled in his heart as his eyes flashed with excitement.

Dao Master Dreamless’s strike was powerful and overwhelming, almost no one could have blocked it.

Jian Wushuang was inspired by it.

“Such power!”

“So violent and overpowering!”

“Isn’t this just what I need to devise the Third Sword Principle?”
