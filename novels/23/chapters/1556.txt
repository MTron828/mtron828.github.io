“Damn it!”

Real God Long Qing was extremely furious. With a stab of his longspear abruptly, the strong fighting capabilities of a Chaotic Real God burst forth and it was as if even the heavens could be pierced.

As for the vast black sea, ten percent of it was annihilated by that stab instantly. However, it returned to normal quickly and the great black waves continued to head toward him madly like before.

Without question, the black sea was even more troublesome than the Red Stone Prison had been previously.

At that very moment, at the center of the black sea which was also the peak of the Ancient Demon Mountain, a white-clothed woman’s body appeared slowly.

Her white clothes were whiter than snow and her face was covered with a veil. She looked just like a celestial beauty from a painting and she was walking out slowly.

Even though her looks could not be seen clearly, the special coldness and elegance of her were sufficient to make everything in the world be visibly moved.

As for Jian Wushuang, who was sitting on the ground, he raised his head fiercely. His sharp eyes then locked on to the white-clothed woman at once.

“Leng Ruxue!!!”

Even Jian Wushuang’s voice was trembling. However, he still felt delighted and furious.

He was delighted as he had finally found his wife after being separated for so many years.

He was furious as his wife’s body was being controlled by Leng Ruxue at that very moment.

As Jian Wushuang stared at the white-clothed woman, the white-clothed woman was also examining him closely.

“Jian Wushuang, long time no see,” the white-clothed woman Leng Zunzhu (Leng Ruxue)’s voice could be heard, “After so many years, you still didn’t give up. You are really persistent.”

“I have said before. Even if you walk to the end of the world, I will still be able to find you,” Jian Wushuang said coldly.

“Yes, you have found me. However, what can you do even though you have found me?” Leng Zunzhu sneered: “Do you have the ability to suppress me?”

“Look at your miserable state now. If not for me being worried about some agreements that I made with her back then and the fact that she might create some trouble for me in the future if I didn’t keep my promise, I would actually act now and kill you straight away!”

The ‘she’ who Leng Zunzhu mentioned was naturally referring to the consciousness of Leng Rushuang who had been sealed by her.

Upon hearing Leng Zunzhu’s words, Jian Wushuang was shocked and he could not help but clench both his fists tightly. He then spoke with a low voice, “I might not be able to do anything against you today. However, I will still repeat myself. Even if you walk to the end of the world, no matter how long it takes, a million years or even ten million years, as long as I, Jian Wushuang, am not dead, I will do my utmost best to find and suppress you!”

“There will surely come a day where I help her to take back what belongs to her!”

“Haha, is that so?” Leng Zunzhu laughed evilly and her eyes squinted slightly, “Very good. I’ll be waiting!”

“Let’s go.”

Leng Zunzhu turned her body and left with His Highness Mu Song and the rest of the people.

“Damn it!!!”

As for Jian Wushuang, he raised his head and stared at the back view of Leng Zunzhu closely as she left. His heart was quivering and roaring madly to release all his dissatisfaction!

He had finally found Leng Ruxue!

Leng Ruxue was just standing in front of him.

She was extremely close to him! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

However, he could not act to suppress Leng Ruxue and rescue his wife.

He could only look on as Leng Ruxue left.

Although she was so close, she was still out of reach.

At that very moment, Jian Wushuang had already neglected the fact that he was still in the midst of the Inverse Cultivation Test for the Third Heaven. He also didn’t know what kind of unbelievable change was occurring inside his own body.

Buzz~~

As Leng Zunzhu and her people disappeared from Jian Wushuang and Real God Long Qing’s line of vision, the black sea which had spread all over the universe started to dissipate slowly.

Real God Long Qing was finally freed from the black sea. His eyes were filled with seriousness as he looked in the direction that Leng Zunzhu left in.

“Who exactly was that woman just now?” at the very moment, Real God Long Qing felt very uneasy.

“Even though her Realm is not high and she seems to have not even reached the level of an Eternal Real God, the technique that she used just now caused even me to be fearful.”

“Moreover, what exactly is the move that she used?”

Although he had stayed in the black sea for quite a while, he was still unable to tell how the black sea was formed.

Although it looked like a Realm Treasure, that was not it.

It also didn’t look like a secret skill that was executed by relying on her Divine Power. Instead, it was another special kind of power.

And Leng Zunzhu possessed such a power.

“Jian Wushuang wants me to suppress her?”

“If it were close-quarters combat, even if it were me, I couldn’t guarantee that I could defeat her. Hence, it is absolutely impossible to capture her alive.”

Real God Long Qing shook his head.

After that, he turned his body and headed in the direction of Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Real God Long Qing had appeared in front of Jian Wushuang and he was about to talk to him.

“What is it?”

All of a sudden, Real God Long Qing became stunned. As he stared at Jian Wushuang closely, his face was filled with astonishment and disbelief.

“How did you become like this?”

…

Inside the Blood Demon Church. At that very moment, the Blood Demon Church was too tragic to look at.

Three Real Gods, of which two were Eternal Real Gods, charged in and unleashed a killing spree wantonly. Although the Real Gods of the Blood Demon Church had given their all to repel them, they could not do anything as the gap between their abilities was too big.

For example, the Blood Demon Church Master had only just become an Eternal Real God. As for Real God Bai Ying and Real God Yin Tuo, they were at a peak level when compared to the other Eternal Real Gods. Hence, among the both of them, either one of them could suppress the Blood Demon Church Master easily. In addition, there was still the Fiery King who was a Void Real God who stood at the top. Therefore, he crushed the higher-ups of the Blood Demon Church directly.

Even the Blood Demon Church Master escaped tragically straight away. As for the three Void Real Gods in the Blood Demon Church, two of them were killed on the spot while the other one escaped with serious injuries.

As for the Universe Gods who were the higher-ups of the Blood Demon Church, Fiery King and the rest of the party did not let them off either. As such, many of them were killed.

In any case, the Blood Demon Church was finished. As for the Universe God disciples within the church, all of them had already escaped outside the sect.

In the very moment, Real God Bai Ying, Real God Yin Tuo and the Fiery King were heading toward the direction of the Ancient Demon Mountain.

While travelling, the three of them were chatting with one another as well.

“Haha. In the beginning, the Blood Demon Church Master was still quite arrogant. After knowing that we have a lineup of two Eternal Real Gods and a Void Real God, he still bragged that he would make us stay in the Blood Demon Church forever. I really wonder where he got his courage from?”

“At the start, I still thought that the Blood Demon Church had some sort of trump card. In the end, they had nothing but the Blood Demon Church Master boasting outrageously.”

“However, it’s a pity. In the end, we still allowed the Blood Demon Church Master to escape.”

The three of them felt that it was a pity.

The Blood Demon Church Master had done all kinds of evil. Hence, when they had acted this time round, they had planned to completely eliminate the Blood Demon Church. However, in the end, they did not manage to do what they had wanted.

However, in actual fact, they didn’t know that the Blood Demon Church Master was not bragging previously. He had really wanted to get the three of them to stay forever. The basis was that His Highness Mu Song and Leng Zunzhu were willing to help him. However, in the end, His Highness Mu Song and Leng Zunzhu had never paid any attention to him. As such, he had escaped as he could not do anything.

“I wonder how Real God Long Qing and Jian Wushuang are doing.”

“With Real God Long Qing, a Chaotic Real God, going there personally, there will definitely be no problem.”

While chatting with one another, the three of them arrived at the place where Jian Wushuang and Real God Long Qing were in the blink of an eye.
