Chapter 2661: Space-time Beast

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

The Sacred Palace was a place where Crimson Stone Fort nurtured geniuses and it was where geniuses were plenty. After becoming one of the many disciples there, Jian Wushuang took a stroll in the vicinity.

The Sacred Palace was very large and contained quite a lot of specific places for cultivation.

Jian Wushuang was checking out the cultivation spaces that were more or less helpful to cultivate the understanding of certain laws or principles one by one.

Even though the cultivation spaces were really quite helpful to regular genius disciples at Earth Ultimate God level, they were of little use for Jian Wushuang whose battle strength was sufficient to withstand High-level Heaven Ultimate Gods.

He passed by many cultivation spaces along the way, but nothing seemed satisfactory enough for him to join and study.

Especially the Sword Principle Palace that he just walked by.

“Although the Sword Principle Palace claimed to be one that specialized in Sword Principles with various kinds of sword techniques to be studied inside, there isn’t much to study with my current achievement. I could perhaps study those sword skills before my sword principle reaches the Sword World’s Profound Achievement, but now...I can see through their fundamentals.” Jian Wushuang sighed secretly.

There were various cultivation spaces along the way with only a handful being of little help to him.

He arrived at a huge green palace at that moment.

The incredibly wide green palace with a special Space-time Energy surrounding it had caught Jian Wushuang’s attention.

At the palace door, a purple-clad old man stood there like an old zen monk with his eyes closed as someone walked out of the palace right at that moment.

“Senior Brother.” Jian Wushuang went up to him.

A down-to-earth-looking big man raised his head and asked, “Yes? Can I help you?”

“Well, I’m unfamiliar with a lot of matters here as I’ve just arrived at the Sacred Palace. I would like to ask Senior Brother, what is inside this palace?” Jian Wushuang asked.

The down-to-earth man answered, “This palace is the Space-time Palace. It’s a place disciples used to study Space-time Law with quite an amazing Space-time Beast in the palace. You’re welcome to go in and try if you’re studying Space-time Law, but you’ll need to have enough Sacred Points.”

“Is that so?” Jian Wushuang was slightly moved.

Space-time Palace was used for studying Space-time Law, and it just so happened that it was what he studied.

“Thank you, Senior Brother.” Jian Wushuang thanked him and immediately walked towards the Space-time Palace’s entrance.

Once he arrived at the door, the meditating monk-like old man in purple clothes opened his eyes and gazed at him, “Spending a month in the Space-time Palace requires ten Sacred Points.”

“Sacred Points?” Jian Wushuang was weirded out. He knew that Sacred Points were widely circulated contribution credits among the Sacred Palace disciples gained through carrying out missions, exchanging treasures, or even through battle gambles with fellow disciples.

“I just arrived at Sacred Palace and have no Sacred Points, but Palace Keeper Si Zhen had instructed that any resources in the Sacred Palace are unconditionally opened for me to use. Entering the Space-time Palace should be within my rights,” said Jian Wushuang.

“All resources are opened unconditionally for you? His Excellency the Palace Keeper said that to you personally?” The purple-clad old man looked at him in surprise.

“Indeed, you can always check in with Palace Keeper Si Zhen if you don’t believe me.” Jian Wushuang smiled.

The old man did not completely believe him and thereafter inquired through his Message Token before very soon received a reply.

“His Excellency really gave such an order?” The old man looked in disbelief before taking a good look at Jian Wushuang. He then said, “Please enter.”

“Thank you very much,” said Jian Wushuang who went straight into the Space-time Palace.

The down-to-earth man that Jian Wushuang just talked to went up after he entered.

“Elder Purple, what’s going on? How come you let that man just now in without giving you any Sacred Points?” He asked in surprise. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Normally, the Sacred Palace disciples had to pay Sacred Points before they could enter into the Space-time Palace.

“Well...” The old man mumbled for a short while before he summarized Palace Si Zhen’s instructions.

“Goodness, who is he to have all the resources in the Sacred Palace opened to him? How come he gets such special treatments?” The down-to-earth man felt more envious than stunned.

...

There was a gigantic plaza inside the Space-time Palace with a dozen Sacred Palace disciples scattered around and sitting in lotus posture.

In the foremost part of the plaza was a huge black statue.

“That’s big!”

Jian Wushuang raised his head to stare at the black statue.

The incredibly big black beast black statue was 3,000 meters tall.

The nose-less black beast had a triangular head, huge eyes, and a tiny mouth. It had two horns on its forehead and looked incredibly fierce. Its body was covered in cold black scales. Every one of those black scales was the size of an adult human which spread across every corner of the figure like black fire. It looked very vivid as though it was alive.

Jian Wushuang felt uncontrollably moved upon his very first glance at the black beast as he could sense strong Space-time energy from the beast.

The Space-time energy was covering the entire beast’s body and even on each scale.

Jian Wushuang even felt that every scale on the black beast’s body contained Space-time Law. His Soul Power did a thorough search and discovered there were exactly one thousand scale pieces on the beast.

“Space-time Beast. Is this what the Senior Brother just now referred to as the Space-time Beast?” Jian Wushuang mumbled. He immediately sat down in a lotus style on the plaza and closed his eyes before beginning his studies.

It took a short moment before Jian Wushuang sensed something.

“Every scale on the black beast represented a piece of Space-time Law. A thousand scale pieces mean a thousand pieces of Space-time Law. The Space-time Law’s first stage could form a thousand apparitions...” Jian Wushuang mumbled to himself quietly and soon got his answer.

“Every Space-time Law on the thousand scales indeed represents one thousand apparitions. Once I’ve understood the Space-time Law on all of the scales I can conjure one thousand apparitions. It then means I’ve completed the first stage of Space-time Law’s which is also the limit.

“The Space-time Law has to evolve once again after that towards the second stage...”
