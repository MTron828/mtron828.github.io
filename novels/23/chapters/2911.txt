Chapter 2912: Saint Hong

——

“How could Jian Yi be so powerful?”

Long Xingzi and the others were shocked.

There was nothing they could do. However, Jian Wushuang’s strength was much stronger than they had imagined.

He was much stronger than when Jian Wushuang killed Realm Lord Tian Qu and the others.

Now that the Golden Dragon and Blood Phoenix had been defeated, the only one in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion who could stop Jian Wushuang… was him.

“Humph!”

After killing the Golden Dragon and Blood Phoenix, Jian Wushuang snorted. He did not even bother to look at Long Xingzi and the others. Instead, he immediately rushed toward the manor where Leng Rushuang lived.

However, he stopped shortly after he moved.

The reason was that a figure had appeared in front of him.

It was an older man in a yellow Daoist robe. The older man’s eyes were cloudy, and he stood there as if the wind could blow him down. However, it was because of him that Jian Wushuang stopped.

Jian Wushuang looked at the older man in a Daoist robe, and his face became very serious.

Although the vicissitudes of life elder in front of him did not emit any aura or show any skills, he just stood there, and it gave Jian Wushuang tremendous pressure.

The pressure was too great.

It was much more significant than when he faced the Golden-Dragon-blood Phoenix and the four Immortal Saints simultaneously.

Jian Wushuang instantly understood that the weathered Elder must be a very powerful expert!

The experts of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion also saw the appearance of the weathered Elder. Some of the young experts and disciples were puzzled. They did not know the weathered Elder. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

However, some of the top experts who had stayed in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion for a long time, including Long Xingzi, were excited.

“It’s Saint Hong, the previous Pavilion Master of our Dragon-phoenix Pavilion!”

“The previous Pavilion Master is still in our Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. That’s great!”

“Haha, with the previous Pavilion Master here, Jian Yi can’t be arrogant anymore.”

Surprised voices kept ringing in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. Those experts who knew the identity of the weathered Elder were all very excited.

“Saint Hong?” Jian Wushuang narrowed his eyes and stared at the Elder, quickly recalling the information in his mind.

Soon, he understood the identity of the person who came.

“The previous Pavilion Master of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion was also ranked on the Dragon-phoenix list, and he ranked fifth on the list. Many years ago, he broke through to become an Immortal Saint. When he was in charge of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, he was known as the Immortal Saint, the closest to bone emperor in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. However, 100,000 years ago, he disappeared and passed on the position of Pavilion Master to Long Xingzi. It was rumored that he left the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow and went to the vast third firmament. But now it seems that it’s not the case.” Jian Wushuang’s heart was very heavy.

There was nothing he could do. Long Xingzi was no match for Saint Hong.

He was also the Pavilion Master of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, but he was mighty. One hundred thousand years ago, he was already known as the Immortal Saint, the closest to Bone Emperor in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. Now that 100,000 years had passed, his strength must be even more terrifying.

“Is this the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion’s last resort?” Jian Wushuang stared at Saint Hong with a burning gaze.

Although this Saint Hong was very famous, Jian Wushuang was also very powerful now. So he was not afraid of Saint Hong at all.

“I have been in seclusion for many years. I didn’t want to appear again, but you are making too much noise today.” Saint Hong opened his eyes slightly, revealing a pair of cold eyes, “After all, we’re in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. Do you think no one in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion can act so recklessly?”

“I dare not. The Dragon-phoenix Pavilion is famous in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. I don’t want to be enemies with the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion unless it’s necessary,” Jian Wushuang said.

“In that case, please release the Elder who suppressed the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. Then, I’ll let bygones be bygones and let you leave safely afterward. What do you think?” Saint Hong said.

Jian Wushuang did not say anything, but Long Xingzi was already anxious. “Grand uncle-master, Jian Yi is so reckless in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and even suppressed the Elder on the spot. If the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion doesn’t kill him on the spot, he will become the laughingstock of all the forces. From now on, the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion will lose its prestige in the Golden Crow Nine Realms. Therefore, grand uncle-master, please kill Jian Yi on the spot. Even if you can’t kill him, you have to punish him severely!”

“Right, we can’t let him go so easily!”

“If we let him go so easily, where will our Dragon-phoenix Pavilion lose face?”

The Immortal Saint of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion and the surrounding experts were all furious. None of them were willing to let Jian Wushuang go.

Seeing this, Saint Hong frowned slightly.

“Shut up!”

Saint Hong shouted in a low voice.

Long Xingzi and the others immediately stopped talking. After that, no one dared to say another word.

After suppressing all the voices, Saint Hong looked at Jian Wushuang again and asked, “My young friend, are you willing?”

“Haha, Saint Hong is so bold. No one in the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion is willing to let me go, but you are.” Jian Wushuang laughed heartily, then he said, “I can release Elder Qin and leave immediately, but I have to take another person with me!”

“Another person? Are you talking about the Young Phoenix of our Dragon-phoenix Pavilion?” Saint Hong asked.

“Yes, as long as you let me take her away, I can apologize for what happened today. Regardless of what price the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion needs me to pay, I will agree as long as I have it. After that, not only will I not offend the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, but I will also owe the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion a huge favor. In the future, if your Dragon-phoenix Pavilion is in danger, I will do my best to help you. How about it?” Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice.

Hearing this, Saint Hong pondered for a moment and then shook his head. “No, the Young Phoenix is essential to the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion. I can’t let you take her away.”

“In that case, there’s nothing more to say. However, I’ve long heard that the previous Pavilion Master of the Dragon-phoenix Pavilion, Saint Hong, is the Immortal Saint closest to the Bone Emperor in the Nine Realms of the Golden Crow. Since I’m lucky enough to meet her today, I’d like to have a good experience.” Jian Wushuang’s aura had become cold.

“It seems that you have made up your mind. In that case, I will accompany you.” Saint Hong’s voice also became cold. At the same time, a terrifying aura slowly rose from his body.
