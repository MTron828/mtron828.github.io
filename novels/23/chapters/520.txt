Chapter 521: Holy Place and Earth Core Palace

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

The Holy Place, the camp of humanity in the Monster Continent, was located in a vast plain.

It was the real center of the Monster-exterminating League and numerous experts were assembled here. Also, in the Holy Place, there were lots of cultivation resources which were not only helpful for Divine Generals but also for Divine Emperors.

“Among the humans in the Monster Continent, only those above Divine General are qualified to enter the Holy Place. As for the ordinary ones in the Cloud Realm, they don’t have the qualification,” While wandering in the Holy Place, Qing Huo explained this to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang looked around and noticed almost everyone nearby were Divine Generals. Even the guards who were in charge of guarding the Holy Place were all experts at the Divine General Level.

In front of the Holy Place, there was a towering mountain. On the mountain, there were thousands of palaces and pavilions.

“There are numerous advanced experts of the Monster-exterminating League living in these palaces. Whoever is able to have a palace in the Holy Place, even at the foot of the mountain, is already a top Divine General. Not to mention those who live on the mountainside, it is said that they are Divine Emperors,” Qing Huo said.

“Oh?” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

“My friend Wushuang, look at that,” Qing Huo pointed ahead.

Jian Wushuang’s sight followed Qing Huo’s finger. Soon he saw a huge pagoda which was made by black sand rising into view.

With his unique eyesight, Jian Wushuang was able to observe that the pagoda was formed by sand. It was very weird that the black sand was still slowly flowing.

But the pagoda was totally stable.

“That is the Monster-exterminating Pagoda, the Treasure Vault of the Monster-exterminating League!”

Qing Huo pointed to the ancient black sand pagoda and said, “Inside it, you can find Cultivation Methods, manuals, Body Reshaping Techniques, elixirs, magic weapons and so on. It has everything you could wish for. Like the last few levels of the Bone Fusion Technique, you also can get it from the Monster-exterminating Pagoda, but of course you need to earn it.”

Jian Wushuang nodded slightly. There was no such thing as a free lunch. It was a rule that you had to earn whatever you wanted.

“Qing Huo, what about the Earth Core Palace?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Before, Qing Huo mentioned that the Earth Core Palace was the biggest opportunity in the Holy Place, so he was very curious and expectant about it. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Don’t worry, we are almost there,” Qing Huo said.

Soon, Qing Huo took Jian Wushuang to the center of the Holy Place. It was an open space and there was a huge altar on it.

In the center of the altar, there was a channel which connected underground. Beside this, many guards were standing guard.

“At the bottom of the altar, is the Earth Core Palace,” Qing Huo said, and then he walked towards the channel with Jian Wushuang.

However, as soon as Jian Wushuang stepped on the altar, he noticed the peculiarity of the Void.

“The Origin Energy here seems to be more powerful than at any other place?”?Jian Wushuang raised his brows.

“Have you already noticed?” Qing Huo looked at Jian Wushuang with a smile and said, “It’s just outside the Earth Core Palace, when you are inside it, you will realize the value of the Earth Core Palace.”

With a hint of expectation, Jian Wushuang arrived at the front of the channel to the Earth Core Palace.

The guards outside the channel looked at Jian Wushuang and Qing Huo, and then they let them enter.

Following the channel, Jian Wushuang and Qing Huo arrived at the First Level of the Earth Core Palace.

It was a huge underground palace. Inside, there were many secret chambers where numerous Divine Generals were cultivating and meditating.

When Jian Wushuang got to the First Level, he immediately noticed the Origin Energy becoming much more powerful.

Just now, when he was outside the Earth Core Palace and near the altar, he had already noticed that the Origin Energy was a little bit stronger.

But now, when they were on the First Level, the Origin Energy was at least twice as strong as outside.

It was certainly better to cultivate and meditate here since it was full of Origin Energy.

“Is this the magic of the Earth Core Palace?” Jian Wushuang was a bit surprised.

At this moment, Qing Huo finally started to explain, “The Earth Core Palace is the biggest opportunity and treasure of the Holy Place. Its Origin Energy is much stronger than outside because the supreme relic of humanity is at the bottom of the Earth Core Palace.”

“Relic?”Jian Wushuang was intrigued.

The supreme relic of humanity in the Monster Continent?

“I also don’t know what the relic is, but I know that the main reason that our human group, who has been threatened by the Demonic Beasts, are able to occupy this area is because of this relic. If we did not have it, we would already be wiped out by the Demonic Beasts,” Qing Huo said.

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

If it was as Qing Huo said, then this relic was very important for humanity in the Monster Continent.

Absolutely, it was the root of humanity and a treasure which could decide humanity’s survival or extinction.

“The Earth Core Palace has this magic because of the relic,” Qing Huo said, “There are five levels in the Earth Core Palace, the lower the level is, the stronger the Origin Energy is. We are just on the First Level, but the Origin Energy is already two times stronger than outside!”

“If you get into the Second Level, the Origin Energy will be ten times stronger!”

“And so on, the Origin Energy on the Third, Fourth Level will be even stronger.”

Knowing this, Jian Wushuang stared open-eyed.

The Origin Energy on the Second Level was ten times stronger than the outside?

Remember, the stronger the Origin Energy was, the easier one could meditate on the Origin.

Ten times stronger, what did this mean?

Besides it was only the Second Level!

“No wonder, no wonder the Earth Core Palace is said to be the biggest opportunity in the Holy Place. It is much easier and faster to cultivate and meditate on Origin here than outside,” Jian Wushuang said.

“Yes, that’s true,” Qing Huo nodded, “but not everyone is able to cultivate here. A Divine General of the Monster-exterminating League is able to get into and cultivate on the First Level. However, talking about the Second Level, it requires certain qualification.”

“What qualification?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Kill Demonic Beasts and obtain Demonic Beast Monster Cores!” Qing Huo solemnly said.
