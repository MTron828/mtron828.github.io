Seeing the changes in Miss Xiao’s expression, Xiao Heng was touched as his affection for her rose from the bottom of his heart.

Such feelings were understandable.

According to the information they had received, Miss Xiao was abducted a long time ago. Approximately more than ten years ago. No one knew how much a weak woman like her had suffered in the past ten years, but they knew it must be no common suffering for her to make it to the preeminent spot that she was at the Hundred Flowers Tower without a family.

“Miss Xiao, we will take you back to the Mu Clan,” said Xiao Heng.

Miss Xiao shook her head repeatedly. “N-no, I can’t go back. I can’t go back.”

“Masters, this might be the first time all of you came to the Qingxiao City or even to the Luogu Territory so you don’t know how terrifying the Hundred Flowers Tower is. Now that I am very useful to them, they’ll never let me go. I’ll never be able to leave.”

“Hmph, we don’t need their consent to take you away.” Xiao Heng sneered.

The four core disciples that were seated next to him all had a cold and fearsome look. The Hundred Flowers Tower might have an intimidating presence in the Luogu Territory as the hearsay was that they were backed by some powerhouse above the Divine Demon Realm. However, Xiao Heng and his people were from Narcissus Island and were notably arrogant and imperious as they relied on their unshakeable sect. The Hundred Flowers Tower was just a nobody in their eyes.

“Miss Xiao, you can just come with us without worries. We’ll definitely guarantee your safety and no one will be able to hurt you again,” said Xiao Heng solemnly and the fire in his eyes could no longer be hidden.

The four core disciples next to him had the same thoughts as they had been so enthralled by Miss Xiao that they were no longer bound by the Sect’s mission. Jian Wushuang noticed that and his pupils shrank slightly.

“Although she didn’t use any means, this woman’s emanating subtle charm from within her is enough to mess up people’s minds. No ordinary Chaotic Divine Demon could withstand this kind of temptation,” murmured Jian Wushuang.

‘At least, people like Xiao Heng and his disciples were unable to resist her temptations.’

‘At times like these, let alone the Hundred Flowers Tower, even if they were to face the Great Compassion Sect, Xiao Heng and his people would have gone all out to help Miss Xiao to escape.’

“Xiao’er is touched from the kindness shown by all of you masters, but the Hundred Flowers Tower isn’t to be taken lightly. There were people who wanted to rescue me. Some were even powerful and capable, but they were all trampled and killed by the Hundred Flowers Tower’s powerhouses in the end. Although all of you are skillful masters, I’m afraid it’s still not enough to fight against the Hundred Flowers Tower,” said Miss Xiao.

Xiao Heng and his people frowned.

Miss Xiao pondered for a moment and lifted her head again. “If you really want to save me, there may be a chance.”

“Miss Xiao, quickly tell us about it.” Xiao Heng immediately looked over.

“It’s as such, I’ve heard from the employees of Hundred Flowers Tower that there will be a huge auction in Qingxiao City ten days later. This large scale auction will attract many powerful people. The powerful people in Qingxiao City will be attending the auction, including those from the Divine Demon Realm of Hundred Flowers Tower. Of all times, Hundred Flowers Tower should be weakly guarded and if masters act on that day, there might be a chance for success.”

“Besides, I’ve lived here for so many years and I’ve made some friends. I can find a way to remove some of the strong guards. We’ll have a greater chance of success if we work in collusion from both the inside and outside,” said Miss Xiao.

Both Xiao Heng and the core disciples’ eyes lit up.

“Alright, that sounds like a plan!”

“We’ll do it ten days later when the auction begins. We’ll work in tandem with Miss Xiao to carry out the plan,” said Xiao Heng before clasped both of his hands together.

The four core disciples also nodded their heads in agreement, they all thought that the plan was feasible.

“In that case, Xiao’er will be here waiting for all of you masters to arrive after ten days,” said Miss Xiao softly with her soft and melodious voice putting them in a trance.

“Miss Xiao, don’t worry. I’ll definitely take you away from here in ten days’ time.” Xiao Heng promised.

They went through the details. Xiao Heng and his people then left after getting some information about the guards of the Hundred Flowers Tower from Miss Xiao.

During their departure, Miss Xiao glanced at Jian Wushuang halfheartedly and Jian Wushuang also returned her gaze. Both eyes met momentarily.

The corner of Jian Wushuang’s lips raised into a faint smile and Miss Xiao caught the trace of banter in his smile.

After Jian Wushuang, Xiao Heng, and the others left, Little Li—the maid who left, had returned to the room and walked up to Miss Xiao.

“Have you found out the identities of these people?” asked Miss Xiao casually, still looking so beautiful.

“I’ve found out that these six people are all from Narcissus Island. Among them, the five Divine Demon Realms are all core disciples of Narcissus Island. The leader, Xiao Heng is a genius, but still falls short compared with the Twelve Minor Kings. Their strengths are just average. As for the last person, he is just an outer disciple of Narcissus Island and hasn’t been long since he joined Narcissus Island. I haven’t got any detailed information about him as he is just a Chaotic Realm. There’s nothing you should worry about,” said Little Li.

Miss Xiao’s gaze turned as she gave Little Li a sidelong glance. The gentleness in her eyes was long gone and chilliness took its place. “No need to worry? I’ve told you to never underestimate the opponent, even if the other party is just a mortal or even a baby. Once you take them lightly, it’s very likely that you will be doomed in their hands.”

“I’ll remember your teachings, miss.” Little Li shuddered and immediately lowered her head.

Miss Xiao’s gaze softened gradually. “Let me tell you this, among the six people just now, the five core disciples of Narcissus Island including Xiao Heng, are indeed just a bunch of fools. The Chaotic Realm that you overlooked is the most terrifying person. His mind is steady and has attained imperturbability. Other people, including some extremely powerful Divine Demon Realms, even if they are First-Class Divine Demons or Peak Divine Demons, their minds will be affected to a certain extent as long as they stand before me.”

“But he didn’t, even for the slightest bit!”

“I was secretly observing him. His mind was as calm as water since the beginning and he was not shaken by the slightest. Such a person is scarce in the entire Wusha Wilderness. I even suspected that he is an old monster that has lived for hundreds of thousands of years in disguise, hiding his aura.”

“Moreover, he gave away a dangerous kind of feeling when he stood in front of me, making me subconsciously think not to provoke him!”

“How can I not be wary of such a person?”
