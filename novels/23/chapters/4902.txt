4903 Accidentally Entering the Death Immortal Heavenly Region (1)

Even Jian Wushuang’s eyebrows twitched when he saw this scene.

This was a full-powered attack from dozens of Yan Immortals, as well as countless top cultivators. Even a beast like the Armadillo Bull, famous for its tough body, would not be able to withstand it.

But in the next moment, a shocking scene appeared.

Feng Shan suddenly shouted. His sturdy body that was like a divine mountain suddenly doubled in size. At the same time, veins that were as thick as arms bulged out, and his skin turned dark green.

All the attacks from the Yan Immortal and peak cultivators seemed to have lost their effectiveness, they actually could not leave any marks on his body.

“M-My Lord… Hurry up and leave!”

He looked back at Jian Wushuang and roared. He had done his best.

Jian Wushuang did not say anything. The Invisible Sword in his hand was extremely bright.

Wushuang Sword Dao, Star River Lake Ocean Sword Intent, second move.

River.

It was as if it was descending from the void dome, carrying endless Sword Intent. Every Sword Intent reflected a dazzling starlight and then swept over heavily.

Under this sword, close to 1000 peak cultivators and over 30 Yan Immortals were killed on the spot, and countless were heavily injured.

Feng Shan was stunned on the spot, looking at this scene in disbelief.

The encirclement was completely disrupted.

“Live well.”

After Jian Wushuang said that to Feng Shan, he stood in front of the Immortal Array Formation with Immortal patterns.

In the Immortal Array Formation, there was an endless stream of Yan Immortal and Peak Cultivators, but they were all kicked back by Jian Wushuang. Then, he stretched out his hand and released the Immortal Style.

After the battle with Chang Duoling, all of Jian Wushuang’s Ancestral Skills, Immortal Styles, and Sword Principles had been tempered.

Therefore, the Immortal Style he released at this moment was even more majestic than before.

Immortal Style, Little Mountain River.

With Jian Wushuang as the center, the surrounding void became his territory. In this territory, he could mobilize and transform any substance.

A divine mountain directly tore through the void and pressed down, directly crushing the second Immortal Array Formation!

At this point, only two of the four Immortal Array Formations were left!

The Immortal Array Formation collapsed and the boundless power spread out in all directions. This scene was taken in by nearly 100 Yan Immortals. Then, they all lunged at Jian Wushuang as if they had gone mad.

Feng Shan grimaced in pain. “You dogs, you want to run after hitting me?!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Jian Wushuang did not stop. After destroying the second Immortal Array Formation, he went straight to the third Immortal Array Formation.

The young Yan Immortal who was fighting with the Young Emperor saw this and immediately pushed the Young Emperor back with his spear. Then, he chased after Jian Wushuang in an instant.

But then, a figure that looked like a divine mountain blocked their way.

“If you want to catch up, you have to step over me first!” Feng Shan’s eyes were also extremely arrogant as he said disdainfully.

The young Yan Immortal raised his eyebrows, pointing his silver spear at him, “All of you, step over his body.”

Rumble…

Nearly 100 Yan Immortals and countless top cultivators stepped over him…

Looking at Feng Shan who was deeply embedded in the back of the Armadillo Bull, the youth shook his head, “What a strange request.”

…

The third Immortal Array Formation was already activated. As tens of thousands of immortal patterns circulated, many Yan Immortals walked out.

Now that Jian Wushuang had destroyed only two Immortal Array Formations, the chaotic battlefield had become a stalemate.

In an instant, he arrived before the third Armadillo Bull. This time, he did not kill the Armadillo Bull, but directly arrived before the third Immortal Array Formation.

Just as he was about to slash down with his sword, there was a sudden sound of air being torn behind him.

Jian Wushuang was forced to turn around and block it.

The silver spear in the young Yan Immortal’s hand stabbed over and the extremely swift and violent Yan power burst out.

Jian Wushuang was forced to take half a step back.

“I thought you were plotting something. So you want to destroy the Immortal Array Formation?”

He tilted his long spear and said arrogantly, “It’s not impossible to destroy the Immortal Array Formation, but you have to defeat me first and I’ll let you go. How about it?”

“Boring.” Jian Wushuang retracted his gaze and turned to walk towards the Immortal Array Formation.

The young Yan Immortal’s gaze froze. “You look down on me?”

As he spoke, his right hand formed the shape of a bow, and the arm that held the silver spear made a full circle. Then, as if he was shooting at the sun, he ruthlessly threw the silver spear.

Jian Wushuang did not turn around, even though the spear behind him had arrived.

In the next moment, a bull-like figure rushed into the encirclement and resolutely faced the silver spear that was flying towards him.

A dark yellow energy that looked like the color of the earth gushed out and formed an impassable barrier in front of Feng Shan.

The spear that seemed to be able to pierce through the sky was actually unable to advance a few steps further when it collided with the dark yellow barrier.

Feng Shan roared, his feet digging deep trenches in the back of the Armadillo Bull. Then, he shook his arms and sent the silver spear flying.

“Good fellow, your skin is really thick.”

Grabbing the silver spear that flew back, the young Yan Immortal raised his eyebrows and looked at him. “Make way, my target is not you.”

“No matter who your target is, defeat me first.” Feng Shan spat out a mouthful of saliva and said.

“How foolish.” The young Yan Immortal shook his head, the silver spear in his hand shone brightly, a thousand Silver Spear True Souls appeared behind him, and they all shot towards Feng Shan.

The void collapsed, and each Silver Spear True Soul was extremely violent. If it all fell on him, he would probably not be able to take it.

Just as thousands of Silver Spear True Souls were shooting down, Feng Shan, who was still in a life-and-death situation, was suddenly pulled over by a stream of Yan power.

Rumble…

The Armadillo Bull wailed as the thousand spears merged into one, carving out a deep ravine that was hundreds of millions of feet deep on its back, causing the void to tremble.

“My Lord.” Feng Shan was shocked.

After letting go of him, Jian Wushuang said solemnly, “Follow me closely. Don’t take any risks.”

He nodded heavily and followed closely.

The Immortal Array Formation was only a foot away, but with dozens of Yan Immortals guarding it, it was still extremely troublesome.

Just as Jian Wushuang was about to unleash his strongest attack, the young Yan Immortal expert rushed over with his spear.

“Little rat, come and fight with me. If you win, I can give you this Immortal Array Formation.”

Jian Wushuang looked back at him and said calmly, “You will lose within two moves.”

“Two swords? How arrogant!” The young Yan Immortal pointed his silver spear at him, his expression extremely arrogant. “Forget about two swords strikes, even if it was 200 swords strikes, you still wouldn’t be able to defeat me! I’m invincible in the same cultivation realm!”

Jian Wushuang’s lips curled up as if he had heard the funniest joke. Even Feng Shan could not help but laugh heartily.
