Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“Shall we begin?”

At that moment, Zi Dongwang and Xin Zhu looked toward Jian Wushuang.

“Let’s not waste time and kill him now,” Xin Zhu spoke coldly.

“Of course,” Zi Dongwang laughed ruthlessly. He then released thick purple light from the purple gloves that he wore.

“Let’s fight,” Jian Wushuang giggled and changed his body.

Swoosh! Eighteen shadows appeared at the same time.

“Kill!” Zi Dongwang’s eyes glowed with murderous aura and his body moved instantly.

As for Xin Zhu, although he was standing in his original position, he was releasing his Power of Consciousness. In no time, three big headless soldiers formed in front of him.

Swish! Swish! Swish!

As the shadows glowed continuously, Jian Wushuang appeared in front of Zi Dongwang.

“Ninth Heaven Stroke!”

A great amount of sword essence materialized and a Nemesis Sword descended abruptly.

As for Zi Dongwang, with a wave of his big hand, purple light burst forth and before it collided with the Nemesis Sword, he clenched his right fist fiercely.

“Break!”

An unreasonable amount of power was released and the Nemesis Sword which carried an enormous amount of sword essence was dissipated at that moment. The absurd power also forced Jian Wushuang to retreat by a few steps.

When Jian Wushuang’s body had just regained its posture.

Rustle! Rustle! Rustle!

Three ear-piercing sounds could be heard and three dim lights appeared in Jian Wushuang’s line of sight.

The three dim lights were the long spears thrown by the three headless soldiers.

The speed of the three headless soldiers was not fast. However, the speed of the spears that they tossed with their full power was shocking.

“Hmph!”

Jian Wushuang gave a cold shout and with a strange change of his body, the three spears passed his body. However, they did not touch any part of him. After that, Jian Wushuang’s body turned back to normal in its original position.

“Jian Wushuang!”

A loud cry could be heard. Afterward, black mist filled the sky and headed toward Jian Wushuang like the ferocious mouth of a beast.

The black mist also contained many consciousness attacks like big millstones with the intention of crushing Jian Wushuang completely.

“This move again?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned serious. However, he stood still in his position and allowed the nine consciousnesses to attack him.

After the nine consciousnesses struck Jian Wushuang, he gave a groan and the black mist which filled the sky dissipated soon after.

“What?” Xin Zhu was shocked.

Previously, when he had teamed up with Universe God Liu Ying to fight Jian Wushuang, he also used this strongest move of his. In the end, Jian Wushuang was affected greatly and almost killed.

However, when he used it again at that moment, Jian Wushuang had actually managed to block it so easily?

“Do you think that I will suffer under the same move twice?” Jian Wushuang laughed coldly.

This move of Xin Zhu was indeed fearsome. Previously, Jian Wushuang’s Force of Soul was only at the peak of a Universe God. Hence, it would be very difficult for him to block such an attack.

However, at that moment, Jian Wushuang’s Force of Soul had already achieved the level of a Real Gods’. If he were to come across the same attack, he could block it easily.

“So what if you blocked it? You still need to die!” Xin Zhu was filled with murderous intent. The three giant headless soldiers then stepped into the void and headed straight for Jian Wushuang.

“I am not interested in you.” After shooting a glance at Xin Zhu, Jian Wushuang’s Soul Power surged.

“Roar!””Roar!””Roar!”

Three furious roars which shook the heavens could be heard. Three black Demonic Dragons shrouded in murderous aura then appeared fiercely.

The power of the three Demonic Dragons were astonishing. In an instant, they clashed with the three headless soldiers.

“I shall let them have fun with you.”

Jian Wushuang chuckled and his eyes locked onto Zi Dongwang, who was in front of him.

“Zi Dongwang, I heard that you are proficient in close combat fights. Today, let me have a showdown with you.”

As soon as the words left his mouth, a giant golden Divine Ape appeared from Jian Wushuang’s body. At the same time, a tremendous amount of flames was released, forming a crimson sea of fire and Jian Wushuang was the emperor of the crimson sea of fire.

Five Beast Soul Manipulation Knack’s strongest Divine Ape and the Scarlet Kingdom were used at the same time.

What was different from before was that Jian Wushuang’s Force of Soul had achieved the Real God-level. Hence, when he unleashed the Divine Ape move, its power was a lot greater than before.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang’s Divine Power and Soul Power combined beautifully. Hence, his fighting capabilities were a lot greater compared to when he had fought Universe God Liu Ying and Xin Zhu.

“Kill!”

Jian Wushuang’s body moved like lightning.

As Zi Dongwang was clad in armor, his body became slightly bigger and his aura was raised to its peak as well.

At that moment, the two of them did not hold back. Both of them had unleashed their full power.

In no time, both of them clashed head-on.

“Boom!”

It was another direct clash. However, Zi Dongwang did not gain the upper hand this time around.

“His power has risen?”

“Just now, he was inferior to me and I annihilated his Sword Principles with one palm. However, now, his power is actually equal to mine?”

Zi Dongwang’s expression turned grave. However, his face was glowing with madness.

“Jian Wushuang, didn’t you want to compete with me in a close combat fight? Today, I shall grant you your wish!” Zi Dongwang bellowed. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Haha, bring it on!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes were burning with excitement.

In no time, both of them fought again. However, this time around, it was a close combat fight.

Bump! Bump! Bump! Bump! Bump!

Shocking sounds of collision echoed across the universe.

Jian Wushuang’s Sword Principles, Zi Dongwang’s palm skills and fist skills, as well as both of their close combat abilities, were completely unleashed.

As for their speeds, they were so fast that no one could keep their eyes on their figures.

Boom!

A lofty mountain at the side was split open. What followed that was a void that was collapsing a thousand miles away. Next, many giant sword marks, which covered hundreds of miles, appeared on the ground.

Intense!

Exciting!

Earth-shaking!

Their intense fight had reached the climax.

Such a crazy clash continued for ten breaths’ time. With the sound of an explosion, the two shadows separated again. Both of them then stood in their respective positions with thousands of miles in between them.

As for both of them at that very moment, Jian Wushuang’s hair was slightly messy and there were two clear palm prints on his Blood Feather Reincarnation Armor which were left behind by Zi Dongwang.

Zi Dongwang was no better off.

The armor on his body had two sword marks. Moreover, there was a bit of blood at the corners of his mouth.

“Haha, Zi Dongwang, is your close combat ability only like this?” Jian Wushuang’s hearty laughter could be heard.

“Hmph, you left two sword marks on my body and I have also left two palm prints on your body. Hence, we are the same. What is it that you are proud of?” Zi Dongwang bellowed coldly.

“Indeed. However, my body defense is stronger than yours. Even though I have taken the full force of your two palms, my injuries are not obvious. But what about you?” Jian Wushuang sneered.
