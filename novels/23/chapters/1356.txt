Chapter 1357: Every sect was excited about Jian Wushuang!

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

“An unusual talent!”

“Jian Wushuang is an unusual talent in the Purple Heart Mansion – oh, I mean, in the Blood Jade Land, and even in the whole East Royal Sanctuary.” Cheng Wushuang exclaimed.

“And I said he didn’t deserve his name?”

Cheng Wushuang felt regretful and terrified.

He knew that talents like Jian Wushuang were qualified enough to join a powerful tribe or sect and be a core figure, and could even win the fairies contest.

He feared that Jian Wushuang was angry with him and would bring him trouble.

“Is he angry? Maybe I could apologize by changing my name.” Cheng Wushuang thought.

But actually, Jian Wushang didn’t pay any attention to him.

After he passed the preliminary contest, he left.

But everyone got excited and admired him a lot.

“Go! Tell our leader that there is a real top genius in the Lion Heart Town!”

“He reached the fourteenth level of the Nine Boundaries Tower, which has only seventeen levels!”

“As far as we know, only two talents have reached the fourteenth level. And Jian Wushuang is the third one!”

“Tell our sect members to come and invite Jian Wushuang to join us. Or he will join other sects.”

Intelligence talents from different groups shared information with each other about Jian Wushuang.

After only half of a day, many talents from different sects came to Lion Heart Town to see Jian Wushuang.

But Jian Wushuang now stayed alone in the yard that he lived in.

Jian Wushuang was unsatisfied with his performance. Instead, he knew that he was now meeting with a bottleneck of his swordsmanship and until a new opportunity, he couldn’t improve.

He wanted to make a breakthrough.

But it was now extremely difficult to make a breakthrough.

As he was upset, a figure appeared at the top of Jian Wushuang’s yard.

A breath disseminated around with a power appalling to any Universe Gods.

“What is that?”

Jian Wushuang felt the power and raised his head. He was surprised when he saw a black figure rising in the heaven.

He felt that the one in front of him was a peak talent that transcended Universe Gods, and was at the same level as Master of Silence Gloriette from the Snow Dojo.

Jian Wushuang had heard about that level of power.

“It’s…a Real God!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his fists excitedly.

The Real God was at a level beyond Universe Gods!

Real Gods, though not as powerful as an Almighty, were definitely experts in the Eternal Chaotic World.

Real Gods were definitely the privileged and respectable ones in any God Kingdom or any sect in the Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries.

And now, Jian Wushuang was meeting a Real God.

“Are you Jian Wushuang?”

This black-robed elderly smiled kindly to Jian Wushuang.

“Yes. And may I ask your name?” Jian Wushuang asked.

He had thought the elderly was from the Lineage of Star. But he quickly disregarded the possibility.

Because he had the identity token for disciples of the Star Palace, he would feel a signal if this Real God was from the Lineage of Star.

But Jian Wushuang didn’t feel the signal.

“I am Wu Chen from Tian Luo Star Palace!” The black-robed elderly introduced himself.

“Tian Luo Star Palace?” Jian Wushuang had never heard of it.

Wu Chen knew Jian Wushuang was puzzled and he said, “To be honest, I come to invite you to join our Tian Luo Star Palace. I know that you have reached the fourteenth level of the Nine Boundaries Tower. If you join us, our sect will definitely provide you with the best training.”

Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He knew now that Wu Chen came here to invite him.

“Tian Luo Star Palace is known to be the top sect in the Purple Heart Mansion. With our abundant resources, you could unleash your potential there.” Wu Chen said.

“Hmm…” Jian Wushuang hesitated.

Before he replied, another talent came, saying with hostility, “Wu Chen, do you feel ashamed when you are lying?”

The newcomer was a lady in a purple robe.

She also had breath as powerful as Wu Chen. Also a Real God!

“Another one?” Jian Wushuang felt embarrassed.

He just intended to test his swordsmanship and he wanted to keep a low profile without showing his full strength. He didn’t expect there to still be talents coming for him. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Kong Jing!” Wu Chen looked worried.

Kong Jing said indifferently, “You may lie to him but you cannot cheat me. Is Tian Luo Star Palace ranked first? What about Holy Church of Golden Wing?”

When she turned to Jian Wushuang, Kong Jing’s tone softened, “I am Kong Jing from the Holy Church of Golden Wing. If you join us, I will arrange a top Real God for you, with the best swordsmanship.”

Kong Jing smiled to Jian Wushuang.

But neither Kong Jing nor Wu Chen, or Jian Wushuang knew that not far away, there was another talent who was looking at them.

“This disciple of the Lineage of Star is quite popular!”
