Chapter 5206 - 5206: Origin Source Change

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

This was especially true on the Original Planet, where no one would avenge them even if they died.

Jian Wushuang stood in midair, nodding slightly. ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs how it is.‚Äù

With a mental command, the identity token in his mind appeared, showing a change in rankings.

The top 5 Dao Lords‚Äô positions remained unchanged, but the competition within the top 20 was exceptionally fierce.

The five Dao Lords might have constraints, but these half- step Dao Lords weren‚Äôt afraid of the Dao Lords above them and were not bound by anyone below. They just kept on killing, and the top 20 rankings depended entirely on who killed faster and whose methods were more ruthless.

Currently ranking sixth was ‚ÄòJi Chaoyang.

This peerless figure who cultivated the Unification of 10,000 Great Daos was the Prince from the Tianqi Dynasty. He had cultivated for less than 10 million years and was a peerless prodigy that only appeared once in a trillion years. Now, he was still a step away from the Unification of 10,000 Great Daos. If he cultivated it to perfection, he should have the strength of a Dao Lord.

Jian Wushuang sighed inwardly; Ji Chaoyang was probably the most powerful figure with the biggest background on this Original Planet.

The Tianqi Dynasty was one of the three major dynasties of the Eternal Tower, and the royal family of the Tianqi Dynasty was the Ji Clan. Ji Chaoyang was a Prince of this clan and received significant attention from the tier 4

Emperor of the Ji Clan. The treasures on his person were no less than those of Nio Long, although perhaps not in terms of quantity.

This genius from the Ji Clan had always closely followed the footsteps of the five Dao Lords, maintaining his position in sixth place!

The seventh position belonged to a newly rising Monster Monk, who had surged into the top 10 in just three years.

Jian Wushuang looked at his ranking again and saw that he was already at 22nd place. He had thought that he would enter the top 20. It seemed that the Feather Continent was getting crazier and crazier.

It hadn‚Äôt even been ten years, and these people had become so crazy.

Watching this group of people who had lost all will to fight, Jian Wushuangs eyes flickered.

There was no reason to let go of the origin sources of over a thousand people!

Although there would be no merit in killing them, killing was as good as killing for Jian Wushuang; he could devour their Daos instantly!

Moreover, many of these people were Grand Yan Immortals who had comprehended the origin source of wood, a great supplement for him.

A sinister aura emanated from his eyes as his powerful Thought power instantly eroded these Grand Yan Immortals. Even if they formed a large array, he could instantly render them powerless.

This was the terrifying power of Heart power. Against weak opponents, it was practically unstoppable. It was absolutely unafraid of any human wave tactics.

Heart power control, coupled with the devouring Thought power.

In the span of a tea ceremony, only broken corpses remained, and Jian

Wushuang had long vanished. Despite absorbing only 20 percent of the Original Universe‚Äôs Great Dao from over 1,000 individuals, he was not afraid of sheer number.

Contemplating his own Original Universe‚Äôs Great Dao, especially the Extreme Dao, it resembled a vast lake with blooming lotuses, each representing a different Great Dao. Among them, the most prominent were Earth, Wood, Mountain, Water, and Fire, the most common Great Dao paths.

Jian Wushuang had become incredibly versatile, mastering seven or more layers of each Dao, some even reaching the ninth layer, enabling him to fuse them into a cohesive whole. However, to fuse them further, he might need to abandon all his existing Daos, possibly even forsaking his Ultimate Sword Dao,

Quietly speculating, Jian Wushuang wondered if he would have to perfect every single Dao to successfully merge them when merging the Extreme Dao.

The thought of such a feat was daunting, possibly even more challenging than mastering the Ultimate Dao.

Unity of Myriad Daos!

Jian Wushuangs eyes lit up. Wasn‚Äôt that what ‚ÄòUnity of Myriad Daos‚Äô meant?Explore new ùíèovels on nùíêvelbiùíè(.)com

Although the name might sound exaggerated, this technique involved integrating multiple Great Dao paths to achieve fusion. In essence, it was the embryonic form of the Ultimate Dao. Perhaps, if one could truly merge tens of thousands of Daos, it might reach the level of the Extreme Dao.

Yet, the further one progressed, the more evident the disparity became during one‚Äôs early stages. In the later stages, Jian Wushuang could foresee the terrifying aspects of the Ultimate Dao: It was never-ending.

Moreover, there were upgrades in Thought power and the ability to Devour; he might even experience a qualitative leap on the seventh layer.

Finding a secluded hill, Jian Wushuang sank deep beneath the ground and began another round of seclusion after devouring numerous Grand Yan Immortals.

His perspective on various Great Daos had shifted. He sensed that he was on the brink of a breakthrough.

Nine Revolutions was within his grasp, a matter of mere months or up to three years. Even if the gains diminished after each breakthrough, his desire for achievements was not overwhelming. If he managed to attain the Nine Revolutions and doubled his power, he was confident of breaking into the top three or even claiming victory.

Furthermore, after the breakthrough, his strength would undergo a qualitative transformation. At the very least, he would possess the power of a half-step Dao Lord. Perhaps he could even ascend to the status of a Dao Lord, coupling his strength with the enhanced abilities from the Eye of the Beast God and the One Thought Universe. The surge in power was immeasurable. Deep within the earth, Jian Wushuang set up a simple barrier and created a

spacious secret chamber spanning several battles in length. He sat cross-legged, closed his eyes, and meditated on his Original Universe‚Äôs Great Dao.

Although he was merely a Six Revolutions, he could already perceive the fate energy.

When it came to the concept of fate energy, he didn‚Äôt have much knowledge. He only knew that the Emperors who successfully merged the Dao had described their experiences as fate energy. Now, Jian Wushuang could sense the emotions of those Emperors who had successfully merged the Dao.

Merging the Dao was difficult; success was intricately tied to fate energy, wasn‚Äôt it?

What he didn‚Äôt know was that within this so-called fate energy, there was a component known as ‚ÄòMerit‚Äô.

Currently, he was going against Merit, his aura heavy with killing intent.

Especially the evil aura emanating from him ‚Äì if he were in the Original

Universe, revealing this malevolence would surely lead to his rejection by the Original Universe. This evil aura was eerily similar to the Forbidden Demon Lord‚Äôs.

Fortunately, this was Qishen Temple; the Original Universe wouldn‚Äôt sense anything here.

Though the Original Universe might be oblivious, the true spirit within the sea of origin source of Qishen Temple saw everything clearly.

The true spirit widened his eyes, watching everything Jian Wushuang did, fuming with anger.

‚ÄúDamn it, damn it!‚Äù The true spirit furrowed his brow. ‚ÄúThis filthy Great Dao.

He doesn‚Äôt deserve to appear in Qishen Temple!‚Äô

‚ÄúSomeone, quickly go to the Original Planet Alpha Nine and initiate a new legacy!

Inside the sea of origin source, a red palace emerged, and a young woman in fiery red armor slowly walked out.

‚ÄúLord True Spirit, isn‚Äôt this against the rules?‚Äù The woman bowed slightly, showing respect. Then she looked up at the true spirit and said heavily,

‚ÄúAccording to the instructions given by our Master back then, the trials on the Original Planet cannot be altered at will. Opening a new legacy was supposed to happen three years later. It‚Äôs not time yet; I‚Äôm afraid‚Ä¶‚Äù

Before the woman could finish, the true spirit snorted coldly. ‚ÄúZhu Yi, don‚Äôt forget, our old Master created all of you to cooperate with me.. Now that the old Master is absent, you all have to listen to me, understood?‚Äù
