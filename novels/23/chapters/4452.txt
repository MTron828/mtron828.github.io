4453 Void Explosion

Boom!

In an instant, the starry sky suddenly froze!

Immediately, the two long scars on Baidu’s left shoulder glowed with red light. Then, rays of energy flowed out of his body and formed a red ball of light between his palms!

Buzz buzz. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The space around the red ball of light seemed to be squeezed by a huge force and started to shatter.

An extremely strange aura that was completely different from divine power spread out, representing destruction.

“Die!”

The next moment, Baidu raised his head and stared at Jian Wushuang. He pushed his hands forward!

Roar-!!!

In an instant, the red light ball was like a bomb that could destroy the world. It crossed countless spaces and headed straight for Jian Wushuang!

The power of this attack was hundreds of times greater than the energy of this person’s previous attack, and it was even enough to threaten a Half Invincible Supreme!

“Is this the Void Explosion? It’s no wonder that in the same realm, a Void Warrior is much stronger than us cultivators.”

Jian Wushuang squinted his eyes and stared at the terrifying red ball that was approaching him at a high speed. His interest grew.

Then, Jian Wushuang made a move that would make everyone go crazy.

He slowly stretched out his hand and grabbed at the terrifying red ball.

“Supreme Wushuang!”

Supreme Rong Ya, who was engaged in an intense battle in the distance, noticed this scene. His expression instantly changed as he shouted, “Supreme Wushuang, dodge!”

The other Eight-Part Generals noticed what was happening. They were surprised that Baidu was forced to use Void Explosion against a Primary Supreme. Then, they sneered.

Jian Wushuang ignored it, squinted his eyes, and continued to reach for the terrifying red ball.

In less than a second, Jian Wushuang’s right hand touched the terrifying red ball.

Boom!!

A violent and twisted power suddenly burst out from Jian Wushuang’s palm!

Craaaash!

Jian Wushuang’s outstretched arm exploded inch by inch.

“Is this the power of the void?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up as he carefully felt the power in the terrifying red ball.

It was a power that was completely different from the Supreme divine power.

Bang bang bang!

Just as the terrifying ball had blown up Jian Wushuang’s entire arm and was about to hit his divine body, Jian Wushuang said, “Suppress!”

In an instant, Jian Wushuang activated Chaos Overlord Body to its limit. Divine patterns that looked like twisted tree roots gushed out of the surface of his skin. The purple ‘Chuan’ character between his eyebrows instantly became demonic and dazzling.

Countless Sword Qi burst out from Jian Wushuang’s body!

In an instant, the terrifying round ball that was originally destructive and invincible shattered inch by inch.

Countless divine power evolved on Jian Wushuang’s arm damaged arm and regenerated it.

Jian Wushuang looked at Baidu indifferently and said, “Your divine technique is indeed very powerful. It’s a pity that you’re too weak.”

After he finished speaking, the Tarot Divine Sword reappeared in Jian Wushuang’s hand.

Jian Wushuang was like an unsheathed divine sword, full of sharp aura.

He could feel that the Tarot Divine Sword in his hand was already restless and ready to draw blood.

“Alright, die.”

The Tarot Divine Sword in Jian Wushuang’s hand slashed at Baidu!

“No! How can I die at the hands of you low-class cultivators!” Baidu shouted and turned around to rush toward the crack in the void.

“You want to escape?” Jian Wushuang sneered.

“Innate divine ability, Life Intimidation!”

Boom!

In an instant, the pressure of a being of the highest level descended on the area.

Under this pressure, the entire starry sky seemed to stagnate, and time and space seemed to freeze at this moment.

Baidu, who was running away, stopped immediately. He turned his head and looked at Jian Wushuang as if he had found something shocking. His pupils suddenly enlarged and he cried out, “You… why do you have ‘his’ life aura?”

“Hmm? His aura?” Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help but frown. He took back the Tarot Divine Sword that he had already slashed down.

He stepped in front of Baidu and looked down at him. “Who’s the ‘he’ you’re talking about?”

“You don’t know him?” Baidu was stunned for a moment, as if he was surprised by Jian Wushuang not knowing who he was talking about, but then he burst into laughter.

“Hahahaha, you actually have ‘his’ aura in your body. Pathetic fellow, you’re dead! They’ll come for you!”

“What are you talking about?”

Jian Wushuang frowned. He could feel that the person in front of him was not speaking nonsense. He must know something.

“You want to know?”

At that moment, Baidu was no longer afraid of death. Instead, there was a strange look in his eyes.

...

“Lowly and pitiful fellow, you’re now entangled with ‘him’. You’ll die. No matter where you run to, those lunatics will find you. You’ll definitely die!”

Bang!

With that, Baidu’s body exploded!

At this moment, he actually chose to self-destruct!

A terrifying power exploded and caused a white wave to sweep across the sky. Jian Wushuang retreated and waved his hands repeatedly to push away the shock wave formed by Baidu’s self-explosion.

“What is this person talking about?”

Jian Wushuang stood with his sword in hand, his expression uncertain.

The words that Baidu said before his death were like a curse, echoing in his mind.

“Who is he? Who are those lunatics who wanted to kill me?”

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flickered with thoughts.

He was not stupid. He soon realized that Baidu only said that after he used his innate ability, Life Intimidation.

...

Moreover, Jian Wushuang was keenly aware that the man’s first words revealed the words ‘life aura’.

“Life aura, huh?” Jian Wushuang muttered to himself. It could be said that his Master, Xuan Yi, had created all his Special Life Form ability.

“Then… the ‘he’ that this person said earlier, is it Master Xuan Yi?”

“Then the lunatics he was talking about, is he the one who chased after master in Nine Luminaries Great Star Field?”

Vaguely, Jian Wushuang seemed to feel that there was an invisible thread controlling everything in the endless darkness.

The owner of the thread was his Master, Xuan Yi.

He was now 100 percent sure that his mysterious Master was definitely inextricably linked to the Void Universe.

Jian Wushuang even felt that there was a hidden meaning behind his Master’s every step.

He began to wonder if his first meeting with Xuan Yi was a coincidence, but in fact, it was all part of his plan.

In addition, Jian Wushuang was most concerned about another question. If his Master was really in the next great battle, what role would he play in the battle?

“Forget it. The most important thing for me now is to improve my strength!”

After taking a deep breath, Jian Wushuang stopped thinking and turned his eyes to look at the battlefield.

As Jian Wushuang finished his battle, the other people’s battles also came to an end.
