4755 The Heavy Snow and the Strong Wind, the Vast Heaven and Earth

After many transformations, Jian Wushuang, who originally looked ordinary, had become handsome and had a unique ethereal aura around him.

From time to time, faint golden divine patterns would sublimate between the ends of his black hair that were tied behind him, giving him the feeling of a young master who had transcended the mortal world. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

And behind him stood two tall and strong figures that looked like gods.

Cheng Qing was like a swordmaster, and with his tall stature, he had an aura full of oppression. Even the slightly thin Chun Qiu was close to nine feet.

When the three of them stood together, there was an indescribable disharmony, but there was also a little bit of meaning.

After giving them some instructions, the Young Emperor watched the three of them leave.

“Da Ban, tell me, am I doing the right thing?”

“There’s no right or wrong, Your Highness. There’s only success or failure.”

…

In the Heavenly Region dotted with countless stars, three figures were moving freely.

This was the first time Jian Wushuang had traveled so freely since he came to the Great Yan Domain.

With the stars above his head and the flowing clouds beneath his feet, he was indescribably comfortable and relaxed.

Countless Heavenly Regions were flowing under their bodies, and the fate energy in each Heavenly Region was like an eggshell, full and mysterious.

Each Heavenly Region contained dozens of continents, and each continent had countless lives.

However, this was only one of the most unremarkable Heavenly Regions in the Great Si Region.

Although they were rushing to the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture, where Prince Mo was located, with Cheng Qing following them, this journey that should have been boring and somber had unknowingly become quite interesting.

The wind blew and the snow fell. The world was vast.

Many different Heavenly Regions and Realms appeared in front of them.

There were nine-headed dragons that even Yan Immortals could not match, and there were countless precious stones in the Super Heavenly Regions.

They also had a prosperous sect with a terrifying foundation that spanned three to four Heavenly Regions.

Of course, most of them were Heavenly Regions where there were few living beings and few top cultivators.

Cheng Qing seemed to be very familiar with the routes. He always reached some interesting Heavenly Regions with little energy.

Of course, when traveling across the Heavenly Regions, there were always some people who liked to rob.

Even if one was born in the mortal world and achieved the Yan Immortal stage, there would definitely be many who liked to make money.

Everything brought a lot of fun to the boring journey.

“How is it? You haven’t experienced this kind of life in many years, have you?”

On a vast land of yellow sand, three figures sat on the back of a heavenly beast that looked like a dragon and a horse, slowly moving forward.

Heavy snow fell from the sky above, falling on everyone’s shoulders.

Carrying the snowflakes on his shoulder, Jian Wushuang did not deliberately use Yan power to evaporate them. In his opinion, comprehending the natural life and death of all living things was a meaningful thing.

“Brother Chen Qing, do you often travel between these Heavenly Regions?” Jian Wushuang asked.

Chen Qing, who was sitting on the heavenly beast’s back, laughed and said, “It’s quite embarrassing. Before I met the Young Emperor, I was still a brat who was at the Entry Yan realm.”

“I used to be young and aggressive, and I made a lot of enemies. In the end, I had to run for my life. That’s how I got to know more than half of the Great Si Region.”

“For example, we are about to go to the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture. At first, I had no choice but to seek shelter with Prince Mo. I didn’t expect that before I could even enter the Heavenlyy Region, I would be beaten up and my foundation would almost be destroyed.”

Chen Qing was still smiling, but Jian Wushuang could tell from his trembling voice that he was not going to calm down.

“Therefore, I’m going to the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture this time for two reasons. One is to help you find what you want, and the other is to settle the score with Prince Mo. I’m going to take back the beating I suffered back then with interest.”

Looking at Chen Qing, who was feeling uneasy, Jian Wushuang sighed in his heart. He was afraid that this trip to the Northern Heaven Celestial Prefecture would not be peaceful at all.

Just as the three of them were about to leave the Heavenly Region, a bulge suddenly appeared on the ground not far away.

Then, the sand and stone separated, and an extremely sloppy, three-inch-long pocket-sized old man came out.

The three of them looked at each other and then looked forward.

When the sloppy old man who had emerged from the ground saw the three of them, his eyes lit up with joy and he ran over with his short legs. “Everyone, my honored guests, this old man greets you.”

What responded to him was the long saber in Chun Qiu’s hand.

The long saber cut through the air, but it was suspended above the sloppy old man’s head, not slashing down.

Even so, the old man was so shocked that he knelt on the ground and could not even speak properly.

“Tell me, what are you waiting for us for?” Cheng Qing looked at him with interest.

When the sloppy old man heard this, he swallowed with difficulty. “My Lord, I have no ill intentions. I just want to use the map to exchange for some rare treasures. That’s why I suddenly appeared and alarmed the three of you.”

Hearing this, Chen Qing looked at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang did not say anything. Instead, he carefully sized up the sloppy old man.

He was only at the Half Ancestor realm, and his strength had yet to reach the advanced stage.

The skin of this three-foot-tall figure that was exposed outside of his clothes had a quicksand-like texture. He should be a goblin that stole the fate energy of this realm, so he was not too threatening.

Thinking of this, Jian Wushuang let down his guard and asked slowly, “What map?”

Seeing that the killing intent in the three’s eyes had receded, the sloppy old man let out a long sigh of relief in his heart. Then, he said in a low voice, “I saw that the three of you have extraordinary Yan power. Obviously, you are Yan Immortals who are traveling in the Heavenly Region. So, I thought of handing over a map I picked up a few years ago to you in exchange for some precious treasures. As for what kind of map it is, I can’t tell…”

As he spoke, he took out a badly damaged notebook from his shabby clothes.

Seeing this, Jian Wushuang looked at Chun Qiu.

Chun Qiu understood tacitly. He waved his hand and threw a storage bag containing thousands of black mountain crystals to the sloppy old man.

He did not expect to get anything in return, but he subconsciously opened the storage bag and saw the black mountain crystals.

With a ‘plop’, the sloppy old man sat on the ground.

One had to know that the most ordinary black mountain crystal was enough for peak cultivators who had not reached the Entry Yan realm to use for several months. It was a treasure in the entire Heavenly Region.

Not to mention the peak crystal produced by the black mountains.

The top crystal was black with a thread-like purple glow. Even if all the black mountains in the entire mountain heaven were added together, the production rate was extremely low.

At this moment, the appearance of these thousands of apex crystals caused the Yan power that was so dense that it turned into water to form a thin layer of mist around the sloppy old man.
