Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Nine spirit beasts, and one of them was even at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm. Truly worthy of Miss Yu’er!”

“Having killed so many spirit beasts in only half a day, Miss Yu’er is definitely impressive!”

“Among the young disciples in Lin family, Miss Yu’er is definitely number one!”

On the Martial Arts Practice Field, a large number of the Lin family disciples were speaking with admiration.

The top experts of the Lin family were all smiling as they watched from the stands.

“Yu’er made a good performance,” Lin Xian said as he smiled faintly, while the First Madam, who was beside him, revealed a large and proud smile.

Lin Yu stood on the Martial Arts Practice Field with an arrogant expression on her face. She looked at Lin Lan, only to find that Lin Lan had not even glanced at her.

“Next,” Lin Zong said.

Lin Lan slowly stepped forward.

Everyone turned to face her, but most of them were looking at her with disdain.

In their eyes, even the weakest spirit beasts in the Blue Cloud Mountains were in the Initial Yang Void Realm. Lin Lan, who was only in the Profound Yin Void Realm, had no chance to hunt any of them. It would be her good luck to have even managed to kill a single spirit beast.

“Miss Lan’er, show me the spirit beasts you killed,” Lin Zong looked at Lin Lan with a smile, waiting to see her embarrassment. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Lin Lan, who had an indifferent expression on her face, did not even spare a glance at those around her. With a wave of her hand, several dead spirit beasts immediately appeared on the ground of Martial Arts Practice Field.

The huge dead spirit beasts that were piled up together formed a hill.

Seeing the spirit beasts, Lin Zong, who was waiting to ridicule Lin Lan, was stunned.

For a moment, everyone there was speechless.

Altogether, Lin Lan had taken out seven spirit beasts.

It was not the number of the spirit beasts that made Lin Zong and other people speechless, but the aura released by these dead spirit beasts.

Though dead, the beasts still gave off an extremely rich and violent aura.

These seven spirit beasts were all at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm!

“This...”

Everyone on the Martial Arts Practice Field was shocked.

“Impossible!” Lin Yu was the first one to shout out.

Even for her, it was her limit to kill eight spirit beasts of the Exceptional Yang Void Realm and one at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm, in only half a day.

But Lin Lan killed seven spirit beast at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm...

Although Lin Yu had killed two more spirit beasts than Lin Yan, the quality of the spirit beasts was inferior.

How could Lin Lan manage to do that in only half a day?

It was so doubtful and incredible.

All the top experts in the stand began to stir.

Jian Wushuang remained indifferent, but he still nodded slightly at the sight of the spirit beasts that Lin Lan had killed.

Three days ago, he had removed the Witch Poison in Lin Lan’s body and then given her three elixirs to restore her cultivation. Now Lin Lan had regained her original level of cultivation, which was the Peak of the Yang Void Realm.

Lin Lan also had good comprehension of the World Origin and possessed many powerful Sword Skills.

It was not difficult for her to kill seven spirit beasts at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm in only half a day...

Jian Wushuang was sure that Lin Lan did not use her full strength. Otherwise, she could have killed far more spirit beasts.

The people on the Martial Arts Practice Field fell into a tumult.

Looking at the dead spirit beasts, piled up in the form of a hill, Lin Zong suddenly turned gloomy and said, “Miss Lan’er, you should know the rules of the hunt. You can only hunt using your own strength, and you cannot rely on external treasures. You must have killed these seven spirit beasts with an external treasure, so your results are invalid.”

Hearing these words, the audience on the Martial Arts Practice Field burst into an uproar.

Most of the Lin family disciples looked at Lin Lan with disdain.

“How could Lin Lan use an external treasure during the hunt?”

“external treasure? Hehe, after all, she was once the top genius of the family, so it wouldn’t be surprising. She must have some external treasures, such as concealed weapons or some other treasures that can kill spirit beasts at the Peak of the Yang Void Realm.”

“Isn’t Lin Lan a genius? How can she be so shameless?”

Their discussions about her were full of mockery and disdain.

Lin Yu even sneered.

Hearing that, Lin Lan’s face turned serious. She turned to Lin Zong and said, “Elder Lin Zong, without any evidence, you claim that I have used external treasures to kill these spirit beasts. Isn’t that ridiculous?”

“Ridiculous? How is it ridiculous?” Lin Zong glanced at her scornfully and replied to her without any sign of respect.

Before Lin Lan could refute him, Jian Wushuang spoke leisurely from the stand.

“Elder Lin Zong, you definitely have sharp eyes! The instant Lin Lan had taken out the spirit beasts, you could tell that she killed them with some external treasure. I wonder whether you can tell me what kind of treasure Lin Lan used,” Jian Wushuang asked with a cold voice that reverberated throughout the Martial Arts Practice Field.

Lin Zong frowned and looked at Jian Wushuang, “Mr. Swordsman, is there a problem?”

“Problem? Of course,” Jian Wushuang sneered and said, “So many people have shown you the spirit beasts they killed. Lin Yu also took out nine spirit beasts. Why didn’t you suspect that any of them killed the spirit beasts with external treasures?”

Hearing that, Lin Zong ‘s face fell.

At this moment, the First Madam, who was also in the stand, looked at Jian Wushuang and said coldly, “Mr. Swordsman, please remember your identity. You’re only a guest of our family. You’d better sit there and watch quietly. Don’t try to interfere with our internal affairs.”

“Is that so?”

Jian Wushuang glanced at the First Madam and Lin Xian, who sat silently beside her. Then, with a pondering smile on his face, he said, “You must be the First Madam of the Lin family. I have heard that you’re in charge of the Lin family. It seems that it’s true.”

“Mr. Swordsman, what is it that you are trying to say?” Asked the First Madam, with a streak of cold light flashing in her eyes.

“You told me to remember my identity, so I also have to remind you of something.”

Jian Wushuang sat there, tapping his fingers on the armchair. Then, in a freezing voice, he said, “First Madam, I will also remind you. Before you said that, you should have made sure to understand who you were talking to!”

The moment he finished speaking, a surge of killing intent, greater than anything they had ever seen before, began to radiate from him.

His incredible killing intent soared into the sky and swept forward like a tsunami.

Time and space seemed to be frozen for a moment, and the whole area became so deadly quiet that even a pin drop could be heard.

It felt like the entire Martial Arts Practice Field was covered with a heavy frost.
