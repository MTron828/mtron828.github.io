The rules of the battle were the same as they had been previously. It was segregated into two parts.

The first part was to go through Supreme Tower.

The second part was to fight rotation battle.

It first began with the disciples who were Universe Gods in the First Heaven.

Lineage of Star, where many geniuses gathered. The battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace among disciples who were Universe Gods in the First and Second Heaven went extremely ferociously. It lasted for more than half a day’s time until it ended.

Then, it was finally the disciples who were Universe Gods in the Third Heaven.

Hualala. There was a large number of figures that appeared on Titanic Star.

In Lineage of Star, disciples who were Universe Gods in the Third Heaven were obviously many more compared to Universe Gods in the First and Second Heaven.

Among the disciples, there was one who was extremely conspicuous. It was Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang?”

“That’s Senior Jian Wushuang!”

“The superb existence of a top twenty member of the Universe God ranking list.”

Outside of Titanic Star, many Universe Gods in the First Heaven and Second Heaven looked over at Jian Wushuang in admiration and reverence.

While surrounding Jian Wushuang, the disciples who were Universe Gods in the Third Heaven were staring at Jian Wushuang.

“Hu Feng, when Jian Wushuang fought against Ling Dan and Seven Planet Palace Master, you were there too. Is he really strong enough to deserve being placed in the top twenty on Universe God ranking list?” A brawny man in red armor asked.

The brawny man was the one who was previously in the first place among disciples in Lineage of Star, Long Ya. He was also an expert on Universe God ranking list and at number fifty-one. He was widely recognized as the top member in Lineage of Star.

However, due to the rise of Jian Wushuang, the top place in Lineage of Star had naturally fallen to Jian Wushuang.

“How can I put this? Senior Jian Wushuang should be even stronger than his given ranking on Universe God ranking list,” Hu Feng said solemnly, “I watched the fight between Senior Jian Wushuang and Seven Planet Palace Master with my own eyes. He, who is just a Universe God, cornered Seven Planet Palace Master and caused him to be in a fix. He forced Seven Planet Palace Master to perform his strongest unique skill. Even so, he was defeated by Senior Jian Wushuang head-on!”

“If it wasn’t for the fact that Senior Jian Wushuang has never fought against the top twenty geniuses on Universe God ranking list, he could even be on the sixteenth or seventeenth on Universe God ranking list!”

“That amazing?” Long Ya and Xuan Yi next to him exchanged a look and both shook their heads in silence.

“Jian Wushuang only broke through and became a Universe God in the Third Heaven for less than five thousand years and he has already become this strong. In the future, he definitely has extremely great room for improvement. Who knows, he might stand a chance to stand side by side with the ten monsters!” Long Ya complemented.

“It’s really possible. At least, he isn’t someone both of us could match evenly,” Xuan Yi agreed.

The two of them were experts on Universe God ranking list too. However, they well understood the difference in the rankings of Universe God ranking list.

The top ten, top twenty and those below rank fifrty were three entirely different tiers.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Someone called. The elegant-looking Ling Feibai walked before Jian Wushuang, “You amaze the world with a single brilliant feat. I asked you if you were confident about the battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace previously and you told me you were sort of confident. But in the end, you gained fame in one battle and got listed in the top twenty on Universe God ranking list.”

Ling Feibai complemented as he sighed emotionally in his head.

When he heard the news previously about Jian Wushuang being listed in the top twenty on Universe God ranking list, he had got a shock.

One should know that he had fought against Jian Wushuang during the last battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace. Then, both of them had broken through and became Universe God in the Third Heaven. Ling Feibai thought that although Jian Wushuang would become stronger, he thought the distance between them wouldn’t be so vast. But who knew that Jian Wushuang would amaze the world with his great achievements!

“Ling Feibai, I finally understand your feelings when you participated the battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace five thousand years ago,” Jian Wushuang joked.

Ling Feibai raised his eyebrows and teased, “How is it? A great feeling, huh?”

“So-so,” Jian Wushuang shrugged.

In the battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace five thousand years ago, out of disciples who were Universe God in the Third Heaven, Ling Feibai was widely recognized as the number one. His power made the rest of the disciples who were Universe Gods in the Second Heaven hopeless. They didn’t blindly strive to keep up with Ling Feibai. Things was lonely at the top back then.

But Jian Wushuang was at the same state as Ling Feibai then.

Compared to the other disciples who were Universe God in the Third Heaven around him, he was at a totally different level. No one had the intention to compete with him.

Even Long Ya and Xuan Yi had no intention to contest and see who was better.

“To me, the battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace is meaningless. It’d be best if it ends sooner,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

Very soon, the battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace for disciples who were Universe God in the Third Heaven started.

The disciples took turns to enter Supreme Tower and Jian Wushuang naturally went in too.

In the end, Jian Wushuang stayed in Supreme Tower for a total of one hundred and three breaths before he came out. Compared to Long Ya, who was second, he had stayed for forty extra breaths.

“There’s a difference of forty breaths. The distance is too vast,” Long Ya shook his head in silence.

Hall Master Yuan outside of Titanic Star in Milky Way and the other deacon elderlies saw the scene of Jian Wushuang going through Supreme Tower clearly. They were all astonished by the sight.

“This Jian Wushuang is impressive when it comes to close combat!”

“Yes, not only that , his techniques are very amazing. Most importantly, his comprehension towards Reincarnation Doctrine is too high!”

“If I’m not mistaken, his comprehension towards Reincarnation Doctrine should already be able to pass through the first level of Doctrine Palace!”

“He’s really amazing.”

After passing through Supreme Tower, it was followed by rotation battle.

The rotation battle ended in merely four hours.

Jian Wushuang naturally won nine out of nine battles and took first place. No one was shocked by the result.

Everything was natural, not in the least bit suspenseful.

In the cave dwelling.

Jian Wushuang stood before Hall Master Yuan.

“Jian Wushuang, according to the rules in Lineage of Star, those who performed outstandingly in the battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace will receive an extra bonus. During the previous battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace, I gave you the Exquisite Mirror as a reward to help you pass through the second Inverse Cultivation Test. This time, your reward… Is a month’s cultivation time in Real God Hall. What do you think?” Hall Master Yuan looked at Jian Wushuang.

“Sure,” Jian Wushuang nodded without hesitation.

A chance to cultivate in Real God Hall was hard to come by in Lineage of Star.

“Previously, when I completed the Ultimate Disciple Task, I received three month’s cultivation time in Real God Hall. In addition to this one month’s time, I have a total of four months. It is not a short time at all. Maybe I can head to a Real God Hall for cultivation,” Jian Wushuang was beaming with joy.

After he left Hall Master Yuan’s, Jian Wushuang came to Real God Hall directly.

The deacon elderly guarding Real God Hall had already received Hall Master Yuan’s message and knew that Jian Wushuang would be qualified to enter Real God Hall for cultivation. He naturally didn’t stop Jian Wushuang.
