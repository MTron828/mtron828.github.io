“Ah! Jian Wushuang!”

“Jian Wushuang! I’m telling you, you’re in big trouble!”

“You’re finished, you’re finished!”

“I’m going to report this to Supreme Gai Fu! I’m going to tell them that you’re oppressing me!”

“Jian Wushuang! You’re about to be driven out of the Divine Life Palace! Hahahahahaha! Burp!”

Bang!

Another sword light came, and the river of enlightenment fell silent again.

The disciples of the Divine Life Palace by the river did not know whether to laugh or cry when they saw this.

In the beginning, they were worried that Jian Wushuang would cause trouble. However, when they found out that the River Spirit was fine after being killed, and the rules in the river of comprehension became stronger, they followed Jian Wushuang.

At the bottom of the river of enlightenment, Jian Wushuang sat cross-legged with his eyes closed. The extremely dense aura of laws wrapped around him and was absorbed by Jian Wushuang.

In Jian Wushuang’s divine body, the eighth rule imprint started to appear gradually and it extended at an extremely slow speed.

The integration of each rule would become more difficult and take longer each time. Jian Wushuang had already planned to cultivate in seclusion for a long time.

This time, Jian Wushuang did not devour any Dao fruit that could speed up the integration of order principles. Back then, the sword spirit of the Tarot sword had controlled his body. In order to quickly improve his strength, divine herbs had been poured into his stomach like candy. Therefore, the medicinal properties in his body were too strong, and he had to remove the impurities from them first.

The fifth stage Ruler realm was the second last barrier to breaking through to the Supreme level, and so this breakthrough was extremely important.

Jian Wushuang would never allow any medicinal impurities to remain in his body!

…

Time flew by, and the sea changed.

In the blink of an eye, ten thousand years had passed.

In the past 10000 years, many special creatures had entered the Divine Life Palace, creating many legendary stories.

Jian Wushuang’s story gradually faded away.

The River Spirit in the river of enlightenment had long given up on cursing. Like an emotionless corpse, it allowed Jian Wushuang to oppress it.

One day, a small whirlpool suddenly appeared on the dark surface of the Dao Comprehension River.

With the appearance of this small whirlpool, the water of the Dao Comprehension River suddenly boiled. The dense principles hidden in the water instantly became chaotic.

“W-what’s going on?”

“Dammit! Who is disturbing my breakthrough?”

“The river of enlightenment has always been fine. How did it suddenly become like this?”

Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff!

In an instant, countless figures rushed out of the river of enlightenment and floated in the air.

Among them, a burly man looked at the vortex and shouted in a low voice with a livid face, “Bastard!”

“What’s wrong, Demonic Wind Ruler?”

Immediately, a large group of disciples of the Divine Life Palace swarmed toward the tall man with a burly figure.

The tall and burly man was called Demonic Wind Ruler, a peak stage five Ruler. He had entered the Divine Life Palace eight thousand years ago and was a creation-level creature. His divine power was more than eight hundred times stronger, and he was the most talented of the new batch of special life forms.

Thus, he had quite a bit of prestige among the new disciples of the Divine Life Palace. He was firmly in the leader’s position, and he was even known as the number one expert below the Ultimate Ruler realm!

Hmph, someone is in the river of enlightenment and has disturbed the energy of the principles. Demonic Wind Ruler said with an unsightly expression.

He had only been one step away from fusing with the ninth law and breaking through to the Ultimate Ruler realm, but the appearance of the whirlpool had sucked away all the law energy in the river of enlightenment, causing him to fail in his attempt to break through.

At this moment, he was extremely furious.

“Eh? Who dares to interrupt Demonic Wind Ruler’s cultivation?”

“Who doesn’t know that senior apprentice brother Demonic Wind is about to break through to the Ultimate Ruler realm? Why are you here to cause trouble?”

The new disciples of the Divine Life Palace said with righteous indignation.

“Have all the people in the river of enlightenment come out?” Demonic Wind Ruler asked with a sinister expression.

A new disciple glanced at the figure standing in the void and quickly replied, “Demonic Wind, everyone in the river of enlightenment has come out.”

“Is that so?”

The Demonic Wind Ruler looked down and saw that the whirlpool in the river of enlightenment was like a black hole, sucking away all the law energy within and expanding at a visible rate.

“Then what is this?” Demonic Wind Ruler pointed at the vortex with his chin.

The surrounding disciples of the Divine Life Palace looked at each other and could not help but frown.

In the past ten thousand years, they remembered that they were the only ones who had entered the river of enlightenment.

“Demonic Wind Ruler, I know! There’s indeed one more person who hasn’t come out of the river of enlightenment!”

A round-faced disciple suddenly shouted.

“Who is it?” Ruler windfiend and the others all turned to look at the round-faced disciple.

At the same time, the Demonic Wind Ruler made up his mind. He was definitely going to teach the person who had disturbed the energy of the principles in the river of enlightenment a lesson and caused him to fail in his attempt to break through to the final Ruler realm a lesson!

He was confident that he was invincible against any other Ultimate Ruler, and that the Ultimate Ruler of the Divine Life Palace would never come to the dao comprehension river.

The round-faced disciple could not help but feel a little timid under the gazes of so many people. He wiped the sweat from his forehead and replied in a low voice, “Demonic Wind Ruler, I remember that there is a senior brother named Jian Wushuang in the river of enlightenment.”

“Jian Wushuang?”

When everyone heard this, they looked at each other.

As for Demonic Wind Ruler, he frowned.

He had heard of Jian Wushuang’s name before. When he had first come to the Divine Life Palace, he had heard many elders in the divine Palace talk about how talented Jian Wushuang was and how powerful his battle strength was. He was only a fourth stage Ruler, but he was able to fight an Ultimate Ruler.

However, Demonic Wind Ruler scoffed at this.

He did not believe that Jian Wushuang, who was only a fourth stage Ruler, could fight against the Ultimate Ruler.

In his opinion, Jian Wushuang had been demonized and that was just a rumor.

He had also asked the elders in the divine Palace which Ultimate Ruler Jian Wushuang had fought. The elders in the Divine Life Palace were speechless and could only stammer about the battle between Jian Wushuang and the Ninth Kalpa King in the trial arena.

Demonic Wind Ruler felt even more disdainful.

Trial arena?

That was suppressing the cultivation of two people to the same level. Could it be considered a battle with the Ultimate Ruler?

“Hmph, when Jian Wushuang comes out, I’d like to see how strong the rumored ‘number one genius of the Divine Palace’ is.” Demonic Wind Ruler let out a cold snort.
