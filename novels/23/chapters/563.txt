Chapter 564: Monster King

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Haha, stop struggling.”

The leader of the spies, Ji, laughed loudly while the raging flames approached Jian Wushuang.

Ji was indeed the king of fire!

Boom!

Ji clenched his hands and punched toward Jian Wushuang with a force that was like a volcanic eruption.

The air in the surrounding area began to burn and the eruption of power seemed to be causing the whole area to shake.

Facing this power, the Golden Sword Soul Phantom, which was behind Jian Wushuang, attacked along with a burst of power from the Heart-killing Sword.

The sixth move of the Heart-killing Sword Technique—Blood-drifting Sword Move!

The technique was meant to kill.

Before Jian Wushuang had comprehended the Slaughter Dao, he could only display the fourth move of the technique, but now he had mastered the fifth and sixth moves as well.

The Monster King, who was a king of fire, and Jian Wushuang, the emperor of Sword Principle, became embroiled in a fierce battle.

The formidable power overwhelmed the surroundings and caused a storm of destruction to rage through the area.

While Jian Wushuang was busy battling Ji, a new figure arrived on the Blood Moon Plain.

The newcomer was no other than Temple Master Iceberg.

Temple Master Iceberg wanted to get Jian Wushuang’s compass no matter what it took.

However, it was almost impossible to take it while he stayed inside the Holy Place, so he followed Jian Wushuang to the plain.

The moment he arrived, he spotted the battle between Jian Wushuang and Monster King.

“That’s Jian Wushuang and... a group of monster spies!”?

Temple Master Iceberg’s eyes widened.

“What’s going on? Are those spies trying to kill Jian Wushuang?”?Temple Master Iceberg was surprised.?“One Monster King and eight Rank Nine Monsters have joined together to hunt Jian Wushuang. I never knew the Demonic Beasts had such a strong force hidden inside the Human Territory. However, this is good for me.”

Temple Master Iceberg was so thrilled that his face flushed red while his eyes filled with joy and excitement.

Yes, joy and excitement.

“God is on my side!”?Temple Master Iceberg cried in secret.

He had been very annoyed when he was unable to find a chance to kill Jian Wushuang. But now, these monster spies were providing him with the perfect opportunity.

As he watched Ji’s powerful attack rush towards Jian Wushuang, Temple Master Iceberg was impressed.?“He is indeed a powerful Monster King.”

The master happily cheered him on in his heart,?“Kill him! Kill him!”

As a human being and a Temple Master, his first thought should have been to save Jian Wushuang, but instead, he stood by and watched while hoping that the monster spies would kill Jian Wushuang. After that, he would kill the spies and claim the compass.

With this scenario, he would not get into trouble. After all, it would not be him but monster spies that had killed Jian Wushuang.

Boom!

Finally, the energy storm dissipated and a messy figure shot backwards quite a distance before finally regaining its balance.

The figure was Jian Wushuang, and even though he looked bad, his aura was still quite vigorous. It was obvious?that he was not really injured.

“How is this possible?”

Ji looked at Jian Wushuang in astonishment.?“How could he take my attack head on and not get injured?”

“It’s time to run!”

After being knocked backwards by Ji, Jian Wushuang attempted to flee without any hesitation.

“Luckily, I mastered the 10th Level of the Bone Fusion Technique before I left the Holy Place, so my body is much stronger than it was before. Otherwise, I would not have been able to block this Monster King’s attack.”?Jian Wushuang felt lucky.

“This Monster King really is a king among monsters. He is much more powerful than me.”

Jian Wushuang had tried his best to fight against him, but he was still overpowered. However, he had managed to weaken the strikes enough that he could withstand them.

“Even though my body is strong, I should be cautious and avoid facing him directly so that I can buy myself some time.”?Jian Wushuang analyzed the situation quickly.

He was currently stuck here because of the Restriction that covered this area. However, by relying on his Realm?Technique, he would be able to deal with these spies for the time being without losing his life, as long as he did not fight with them head-to-head.

“Kill him!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Ji chased after Jian Wushuang and closed in on him while surrounded by fire.

As for the other eight monster spies, they surrounded Jian Wushuang from all directions.

“Piss off!”

Jian Wushuang roared. The Heart-killing Sword struck out with the power of the Slaughter Dao behind it and forced two enemies in front of Jian Wushuang backwards.

“Hump. Although those Rank Nine Monsters can’t hurt me at all, they can still cause me some trouble.”?Jian Wushuang’s eyes became cold.

He did not need to fear any of the spies, except for the Monster King.

He was confident that he could break through a joint attack from three Rank Nine Monsters.

“Go to hell, Human!”

Ji approached Jian Wushuang from behind, with his fist flying towards Jian Wushuang like a meteorite falling from the sky.

Jian Wushuang was unable to completely dodge the incoming fist, so he used his swordsmanship to help deflect the blow.

Boom!

A booming sound echoed throughout the area as Jian Wushuang was pressed down into the ground, causing a large crater to form.

The next moment, Jian Wushuang leaped aside and rushed away, continuing to prolong the battle.

“I used all my power in that blow just now, but it only wounded him slightly.”

While gazing at Jian Wushuang, he could sense that Jian Wushuang’s aura was almost as powerful as before.

“He has mastered the 10th Level of the Bone Fusion Technique, which means his body is now among the strongest out of all the Temple Masters. Not only that, he is fast.

“He has already asked for help, so it won’t take long for them to arrive here. Once that happens I won’t be able to kill him, and even escaping will be quite difficult.”
