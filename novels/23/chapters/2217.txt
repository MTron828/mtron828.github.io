Chapter 2218 The Bai

After hearing what the middle-aged man had said, the blurry figure fell silent.It was true that they had been in slumber for far too long.

It was so long that they themselves had no idea how long they had been in slumber.

After the Great Battle of the Ancient Past, they had been in slumber. Originally, there had been five of them. During the great battle, two of them died. Now, only the eldest brother, the second and the youngest were alive.

The youngest of them had a unique addiction: he liked to take in virgin blood. Back in the Ancient Past, there had been numerous experts, hence he had still held back. He only went crazy now because he was in an era in which he did not need to hold back and he had finally awakened after such a long time.

“Brother, I will allow you to continue because you just awakened. However, please keep a low profile,” the blurry figure reminded.

“Don’t worry. I ask the people from the Real Martial Arts Divine Church to get those female virgins. There won’t be too much commotion as these females aren’t cultivators and have no background,” the middle-aged man smiled.

The blurry figure nodded his head slightly and stopped reprimanding.

“Oh yes. Have the Real Martial Arts Divine Church prepared the resources we need?” the blurry figure asked.

“Yes, they have prepared them all. They are with me. However, these treasures are not of good quality,” the middle-aged man brought out a Qian Kun Ring and said.

The blurry figure scanned the ring, not surprised at all. “This era is far different from ours. They are doing well from the fact that they can still find these resources. At least these resources are beneficial to me and our older brother.”

“Even though this era is far worse, there are still many resources out there. The main point is that the Real Martial Arts Divine Church is too weak and cannot be even considered a top tier clan. Their means are limited, so of course they cannot get us all the good stuff. It would be a different story if it was Sanctuary Alliance.”

“Brother, I don’t understand why we are staying within a mere Real Martial Arts Divine Church. With our current fighting power, we can forcefully take over Sanctuary Alliance and use their power to find all the resources we need. Would that not be much faster and more efficient?” the middle-aged man asked.

“It’s not as easy as you think. Even though the average power level of this era is nothing compared to our era, that is because of Restrictions of Heaven and Earth. We too are under these restrictions and the maximum fighting power we can have is peak Chaotic Realm. We might not be strong compared to the top tier experts in this era.”

“For example, even our older brother is not confident in defeating the strongest two man in this era, Emperor Bai and Sword Emperor.”

“They are just natives of this era. How strong can they be?” the middle-aged man said disapprovingly.

“Do not look down on them. Don’t forget Blood Emperor from twenty thousand years ago. He was an emperor of the blood clan. Even though the blood clan had many emperors, those who reach that level are definitely much stronger than me and our older brother. And that Blood Emperor died in the hands of the natives you mentioned,” the blurry figure said seriously.

“Furthermore, what we are targeting is Heaven’s Horizon. There is no need for us to provoke the experts from this era. Hence, you should maintain a low profile. Do not blame me for not helping you if you anger a top tier expert from this era and die in their hands.”

After the blurry figure said this, he disappeared.

The middle-aged man curled his lips, evidence that he did not take what the blurry figure said seriously.

...

On the territory that the Real Martial Arts Divine Church controlled, in a large town near the headquarters of the Real Martial Arts Divine Church.

Jian Wushuang was in a tavern in the town, drinking wine.

He Xiu, who carried a long sword behind his back, appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

“Master,” He Xiu greeted Jian Wushuang respectfully.

“Don’t be so tense. Sit down and relax,” Jian Wushuang waved his hands.

“Yes,” He Xiu nodded his head as he sat down in front of Jian Wushuang.

“How was the search?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“I checked three different intel departments. The intel I got was the same: no one saw Emperor God Ling Qu from the Lineage of Stars. Furthermore, in recent years, there was no battle between any almighties in this territory. However, Emperor God Ling Qu did enter this territory before disappearing,” He Xiu said as he frowned.

An expert in the emperor god realm had gone missing without any commotion at all.

It was as though this emperor god had never set foot here.

This meant...

“It is okay. Since we cannot get any useful intel from these intel departments, let us find the experts from the Real Martial Arts Divine Church and ask them,” Jian Wushuang smiled.

“Does Master want to confront the Real Martial Arts Divine Church head on?” He Xiu asked.

“Confront the Real Martial Arts Divine Church? I do not know what they have. It is not wise to confront them head on. Furthermore, if the experts hiding within the Real Martial Arts Divine Church saw me coming and ran away, what can we do?” Jian Wushuang shook his head and said.

He Xiu was stunned for a moment before understanding why.

“There is no need for us to confront them in their headquarters. We can just bait them out. The best case scenario is we force them to use their trump card. Disciple, I shall leave this to you,” Jian Wushuang said casually.

“I understand,” He Xiu nodded his head as an idea formed in his head.

He Xiu left once again.

Meanwhile, Jian Wushuang sat at the window seat in the tarvan. He smiled lightly as he drank wine and looked at the scenery outside the window.

The town that Jian Wushuang was in was near the Real Martial Arts Divine Church, hence many of their disciples were gathered there.

Many of the top tier experts and almighties would also appear here.

Even now, there was an almighty from the Real Martial Arts Divine Church here at this town.

Within a secret room.

Many figures gathered here and the leader was the man in crimson armour.

“The lord is satisfied with this batch of virgins. These are your rewards,” the man in crimson armour threw a Qian Kun Ring to the people in front of him.

When the people scanned the ring, they were all pleasantly surprised.

The man in crimson armour then said, “I have already given you the rewards. Remember, bring the virgins here every thirty years. Do not be negligent. If the lord is angry, no one can save you.”

“Yes, yes.”

The figures within the room nodded their heads.

Right then, boom!

A loud bang was heard as a sword light appeared out of nowhere and sliced the secret room.

The ruthless sword light tore everyone apart and killed them instantly. Only the man in crimson armour survived.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
