Chapter 603: Fourteen People Killed One By One!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Jian Wushuang, these are the results.”

Bone Dragon Emperor stood before Jian Wushuang and said, “Seven died in the past one thousand years, either because of old age or killed in fights for personal grudges or treasures. Only 14 are still alive in the Ancient World.”

“Fourteen?” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly in acknowledgment.

Usually, a Skyscraping Realm expert could live for 3 thousand years. After one thousand years had passed, it was normal that some of them had died. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“The fourteen people alive are in different planes. I will take you to their locations.” Bone Dragon Emperor said.

“Thank you so much.” Jian Wushuang was grateful.

Immediately, Bone Dragon Emperor led Jian Wushuang away.

They arrived at the Ice Fire World.

It was a peculiar world, half filled with volcanoes and magma while the other half covered in ice and snow.

Now, they were in the half world of ice and snow.

Whoosh!

Jian Wushuang and the Bone Dragon stopped in the air, looking down upon the world below.

There was nothing but ice and snow.

“According to my information, Ice Wing is meditating under the snowfield.” Bone Dragon Emperor said.

“Well.” Jian Wushuang nodded, “I will flush him out.”

After saying that, he spread forth his Supreme Sword Essence. Jian Wushuang drew out his Heart-killing Sword and slashed at the ground.

BANG! The ground split in half, a rift opened and ice and snow fell into it.

“Who is disturbing me?”

A roar came from the deep underground, shattering the falling ice and a terrifying being could be seen rising.

Then a white-robed elder with frosted eyebrows appeared.

“Is he Ice Wing?”

Jian Wushuang took a glance at the white-robed elder and said, “Ice Wing, one thousand years ago, you and many other Skyscraping Realm experts killed Sword Ancestor for his Ancient World Token. Do you remember?”

“Sword Ancestor?” The white-robed elder’s face fell, remembering the super sword talent one thousand years ago.

“Yes, so what?” Ice Wing snorted and said.

“My name is Jian Wushuang, a descendant of the Sword Ancestor. I come here today to seek vengeance for him. Therefore... you will die!” After confirming his identity, Jian Wushuang acted directly without saying more.

Ice Wing was just a normal Level One expert at Skyscraping Realm. Having meditated for nearly one thousand years, he had not improved too much. Therefore, Jian Wushuang killed him as easily as squashing an ant.

“13 left!” Jian Wushuang’s eyes had a cold sharp glint. “Bone Dragon Emperor, let’s go to the next.”

“Okay.” Bone Dragon Emperor nodded, then they went to another plane through the wormhole.

Time passed by, thanks to Bone Dragon Emperor’s lead, Jian Wushuang killed all the experts involved in killing the Sword Ancestor.

It was not difficult for Jian Wushuang to kill these Level One and Level Two experts at Skyscraping Realm. After all, his Realm skill could slow them and at the same time, his own speed was fast.

Two months passed in the blink of an eye.

To kill them was easy, but they had spent most of their time finding their locations.

In the Tian Yu World.

Jian Wushuang was crazily battling Jiujie King over a great river. Those experts watching felt the whole world shake.

Jiujie King, a Level Three expert at Skyscraping Realm, though weaker than Sword Ancestor, was not easily killed. Besides, he knew well when and how to flee.

After a while, knowing he was weaker than Jian Wushuang, Jiujie King intended to flee. Though Jian Wushuang had used his Realm, it was hard to stop him. At last, Bone Dragon Emperor lent a hand and stopped Jiujie King, so that Jian Wushuang could kill him.

Except for Bagu Cave Master, who turned into a small bell of Bone Dragon Emperor, all other experts who were involved in killing Sword Ancestor had perished.

Most importantly, Jian Wushuang killed most of them with relative ease.

“Time for the last one.” A sharp light flashed in Jian Wushuang eyes.

Though he didn’t kill Sword Ancestor with his own hands, Jian Wushuang had the strongest killing intent against him.

It was Su Ming!

A traitor of the Bloodline of the Sword Ancestor. It was he who leaked that Sword Ancestor had an Ancient World Token.

It was also he who forced Jian Wushuang to leave the Divine Land.

He was the one Jian Wushuang wanted to kill most.

“Jian Wushuang, I have discovered where Su Ming is. But there is going to be some difficulty in killing him.” Bone Dragon Emperor said.

“Oh? ” Jian Wushuang raised his eyebrows.

Su Ming had reached Skyscraping Realm not long ago. How could it be difficult to kill him?

“Su Ming joined Darkness Temple and now is the Ninth Saint Master of Darkness Temple. If you want to kill him, you will need to negotiate with the Darkness Temple first.” Bone Dragon Emperor explained.

“Darkness Temple?” Jian Wushuang’s face fell.

During the last two months, he had been staying with Bone Dragon Emperor and had heard of some things about the Ancient World from him.

The Ancient World consisted of different planes. Skyscraping Realm experts from these worlds traveled from one to another and fought with each other. Gradually different forces formed.

Each force was defended by Skyscraping Realm experts.

For example, as the leader of one of the most powerful force in the Ancient World, Bone Dragon Emperor was a super expert.

The Darkness Temple was another powerful force in the Ancient World.
