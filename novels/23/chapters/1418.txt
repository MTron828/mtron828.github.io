Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Family Mu was a family living in a peaceful time without wars.

The father of the big Family Mu was a famous businessman. His only son, Mu Chen, had been living an abundant, worry-free life.

Mu Chen was smart and eager to learn, and was talented with business.

When he was ten years old, he used his extra money, which was 10,000 RMB he had accumulated, to start a business. In a short half-year, he had earned 200,000 RMB, twenty times his original investment.

His parents loved him a lot, and his relatives and friends all believed that he would be successful in the future.

When he reached the age of eighteen, Mu Chen married his beloved with the approval of his family, and, in the next year, he had his first child.

Afterwards, he began to take over his father’s business and expanded the business.

Then, he opened a gold store called Noble House, in which gold was sold. Soon, many subsidiaries opened all over Mu Chen’s country. In middle-age, he continued to enlarge his business and became the leader of the local Business Association.

Not only was he rich but he also had great power, and even the emperors of every kingdom were in awe of him.

In his fifties, he gradually handed over the Noble House to his son, while he enjoyed the happiness of retired life with his wife.

He was blessed by wealth and happiness throughout his life.

At the age of 106, he passed away together with his wife, looking back on a life with no regrets.

…

Beneath the vast black clouds.

Jian Wushuang was sitting there peacefully falling asleep. But at that moment, he was not a baby any more. He had become a grey-haired old man who had reached the end of his life, completely still.

King of Venomous Worms, as well as Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao, had no idea what had happened.

They had seen that Jian Wushuang had become a baby, but then he had grown from a baby to a child, a teenager, to adulthood, and finally to an old man.

He had experienced a person’s lifetime from childhood to old age.

They still had no idea what the reason behind it was.

All of a sudden…

“Huh? It’s beginning to change again!” Hall Master Yuan exclaimed.

Jian Wushuang had become a baby again!

This was the second time Jian Wushuang had been transformed into a baby in the God Test!

This time, he was born in a royal family as a king’s son, named Jin Mo.

Jin Mo, at the age of twelve, showed his literary and martial excellence, so that no one in the royal family was superior to him.

When he was 20 years old, he succeeded to the throne and began to reform the whole court.

It took him only three years to reform and stabilize the corrupt court. At the same time, he spent seven years boosting the economy and building an invincible army of 400,000 soldiers.

Then, at the age of 30, Jin Mo began to expand his territory, and to exterminate the surrounding dynasties which were weaker than his. Within less than ten years, he had made his dynasty one of the six major empires in the world.

When he was sixty years old, he conquered the other five empires, and at the same time wiped out all the weak kingdoms and unified the whole world.

He became the first emperor to unite the whole world. He did his best to make the people of this world live and work in peace and prosperity.

People praised him everywhere and his reputation lasted thousands of years! From ancient times to the present, no emperor could compare.

Finally, the world was made into a real paradise, and the emperor died without regrets.

…

Beneath the clouds, Jian Wushuang, once in the form of an old man, become a baby again.

“The third time!” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao both held hands tightly, feeling nervous and confused.

They didn’t know that Jian Wushuang was in the third round of the reincarnation, each of which involved experiencing a whole lifetime.

This time, he was a martial art player, whose martial arts were paramount and well-respected.

He was named Liu Xuan and born in a village in the mountains. This village was named Town Liu.

…

Within the boundaries of heaven.

Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao looked at Jian Wushuang gradually changing from babies to an elder over and over again.

Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao both got used to the rounds of reincarnation, but they were still counting the times.

Buzz ~ ~

Jian Wushuang’s body changed again, from an elder to a baby.

“The ninth time!” Lei Chao’ was shocked.

“Nine is the total of a complete series. So it should be his last change.” Hall Master Yuan speculated.

As Hall Master Yuan had guessed, Jian Wushuang did not go on becoming a baby or an old man for the tenth time and gradually returned to his original appearance.

“He has recovered.” Both Hall Master Yuan and Lei Chao were excited.

At the same time, Jian Wushuang’s consciousness slowly came to life.

“Where am I…”

As Jian Wushuang woke up, a source of power in his body erupted, like a fire burning in his heart.

The intense pain started torturing Jian Wushuang.

“It’s the Exquisite Mirror!”

Jian Wushuang clenched his hands. He realized that the nine rounds of reincarnation were caused by the power of the Exquisite Mirror

At the same time, all the complex memories of reincarnation rushed into his mind.

These memories, a total of nine, were precisely the memories of the ninth rounds he had experienced in the God Test when his consciousness had fallen asleep!

Mu Chen, Jin Mo, Lu Xuan… nine different memories with nine different identities all rushed into his mind in a moment.

Jian Wushuang’s face and eyes went red and he was insane in a way which he never been before. Then, he understood, “It is the Nine Lives Reincarnation Test that I am facing!”
