Chapter 3101: Inquiry

_________

“Over the years, only eight people have seen the Black Divine Pillar, and the most powerful person has only comprehended 70% of a secret skill?” Jian Wushuang was stunned.

He finally knew why Mo Shan was so shocked.

It seemed that no one had ever comprehended a complete secret skill under the Black Divine Pillar.

“My friend, do you know who has comprehended 70% of a secret skill under the Black Divine Pillar?” Mo Shan asked with a smile.

“Who is it?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s one of the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, Palace Master Shuiyun!” Mo Shan said.

Jian Wushuang was shocked.

Although he had not really entered the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces, he had heard from Mo Shan that the three Palace Masters were very powerful.

The three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces were super existences in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance, second only to the mysterious master. They had great power and status in the Heaven-cleaving Alliance.

Although Jian Wushuang did not know how powerful the three Palace Masters were, he could guess that they were definitely at the top of the Divine Beginning World. Perhaps for some special reasons, they were not as strong as the three most noble masters of the Saint Realm in the Third Heaven, but they were definitely not much weaker.

Such a super existence had only comprehended 70% of a secret skill under the Black Divine Pillar? Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Palace Master Shuiyun is a true genius. He was once one of the genius disciples of the Three Palaces of Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm. When he was under the Black Divine Pillar of the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, he comprehended 70% of that secret skill. That secret skill became his famous ultimate move in the future. Until now, his secret skill has been well-known in the Divine Beginning World. Many people immediately thought of his move when they mentioned Palace Master Shuiyun!”

“It can be said that the reason why Palace Master Shuiyun is so famous in the Divine Beginning World and why so many people are afraid of him is largely because of his secret skill. However, he has only comprehended 70% of that secret skill?” Mo Shan exclaimed.

Jian Wushuang could not help taking a deep breath.

Palace Master Shuiyun had also comprehended 70% of the secret skill from the golden characters in the black divine column, but he had already achieved such a great reputation.

But now, he had obtained a complete secret skill, six paths reincarnation.

“When I was in the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm, I knew that this secret skill was very terrifying, even comparable to the space-time divine skill. Now it seems that I did not underestimate this secret skill.” Jian Wushuang clenched his hands, feeling a trace of surprise in his heart, he had indeed picked up a treasure this time.

“In any case, you were able to obtain a complete secret skill under the Black Divine Pillar. This luck and fortune is indeed unprecedented. Congratulations, little guy,” Mo Shan said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang smiled, but suddenly his expression changed. “Elder Mo Shan, I have already been to the Heaven-cleaving Mystic Realm and obtained the opportunity. If nothing goes wrong, I will leave the Heaven-cleaving Star soon. But before that, I want to ask you something.”

“What is it?” Mo Shan appeared to be very patient.

“Senior, you should know about the Supreme Emotion Valley, right?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Yes, I know.” Mo Shan nodded. “Although the sect is in the Second Heaven and is not in the highest Third Heaven, the reputation and strength of the sect is no less than those overlords in the Third Heaven. Of course I know about such a powerful sect.”

“Why? Are you asking about the relationship between the Supreme Emotion Valley and the Supreme Emotion Valley?”

“A little.” Jian Wushuang nodded. “Senior, can you tell me about the Supreme Emotion Valley in detail, including their overall strength and the cultivation techniques they practice?”

“Overall strength?” Mo Shan raised his eyebrows. “I have just told you that the overall strength of the Supreme Emotion Valley is no less than some overlords in the Third Heaven, the three holy regions, the four divine clans, and the Octagonal Heaven Sect. Although the Supreme Emotion Valley is not as powerful as the three holy regions and the four divine clans, it is not much weaker than the Octagonal Heaven Sect.”

“In terms of experts, there are more than ten known Principles Masters in the Supreme Emotion Valley. There are also some guest elders who have accumulated all kinds of human relationships over the years. Of course, in the Supreme Emotion Valley, the one who is the scariest, even the three great holy regions, the four great celestial races, and even our Heaven-cleaving Alliance are afraid of, is the reclusive old valley master in the Supreme Emotion Valley!”

“Although the old valley master hasn’t asked for the truth for a long time, her strength is very terrifying!”

“How terrifying?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“It’s not inferior to the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Three Palaces. Moreover, if that old woman really goes crazy, even if the three Palace Masters of the Heaven-cleaving Alliance come personally, they will have to avoid her because the divine skill she has mastered is too powerful. If she recklessly uses that divine skill, she can pose a threat to even a Saint Realm Master,” Mo Shan said.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted.

He had long known that there was a very terrifying divine skill in the valley. Leng Rushuang had been taken away by the valley because she was suitable to cultivate that divine skill.

“Senior Mo Shan, I heard that most of the disciples of the valley have to abandon their feelings?” Jian Wushuang asked again.

“Yes.” Mo Shan nodded. “Both the disciples and the experts of the Supreme Emotion Valley have no partners. This has something to do with the cultivation method and some secret skills cultivated by the Supreme Emotion Valley. Especially the divine skill cultivated by the old valley master, which can’t be touched at all. But even wild beasts have some feelings, let alone humans. Therefore, there are too few people in this world who are suitable to cultivate that divine skill!”

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang could not help clenching his hands.

“My young friend, it seems that you have not only a dispute with the Supreme Emotion Valley, but also a big one, right?” Mo Shan looked at Jian Wushuang.

Seeing that Jian Wushuang was silent, Mo Shan continued, “My young friend, no matter what grudges you have with the Supreme Emotion Valley, I have to remind you not to be impulsive. The Supreme Emotion Valley is very strong, and most of the people there are cold, ruthless, and decisive. With your current strength, you are nothing in front of the Supreme Emotion Valley.”

“I know.” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily, then he asked, “Senior Mo Shan, one last question. If I want to have a fair conversation with them, what level do I have to reach?”

“A fair conversation with them?” Mo Shan frowned and pondered for a moment, then he answered, “At the very least, you have to be an Invincible Immortal Saint to make them not dare to underestimate you. As for a fair conversation, the Lord of Principles!”
