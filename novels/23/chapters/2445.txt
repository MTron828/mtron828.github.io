Chapter 2446: Trapped

Su Nan’s group breathed a sigh of relief when Jian Wushuang acknowledged their sect.

“Zhuo Peng is now undergoing cultivation training in Ice Fire God Palace and making great progress. He has mentioned you many times. Unfortunately, he’s not here in Saint’s Tomb as his cultivation level is still rather low,” explained Su Nan.

“Mmm.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly before waving his hand and taking out an Interspatial Ring.

“There are many purple amulets in this Interspatial Ring which I’ve collected in the past half-day. I will now give it to you. I hope you will take care of my Second Brother in the Ice Fire God Palace.”

Su Nan took the Interspatial Ring. After glancing at it briefly, his face showed a pleasant surprise before he said, “Senior Brother Wushuang, don’t worry. We as Zhuo Peng’s seniors will definitely assist in his growth.”

“I appreciate your efforts,” said Jian Wushuang before he turned and left.

Su Nan and his team of five were stoked upon watching Jian Wushuang leave.

“I know that we can get lots of benefits if we look for Senior Brother Wushuang now. Isn’t that true?” Su Nan said with a smile.

Jian Wushuang must have accumulated many treasures after killing so many genius disciples in this short span of less than half a day.

The number of purple amulets obtained was innumerable. Those rare treasures were useful but there were just too many purple amulets. For the sake of his Second Brother Zhuo Peng, he did not mind giving them some purple amulets.

“Senior Brother Su Nan, you are smart. Is it alright if we accept Jian Wushuang’s gifts in front of so many disciples?” asked a disciple of the Ice and Fire God Palace nervously.

“It’s Jian Wushuang who killed their disciples, not us. We’ll just ignore them if they find fault with us. Let’s go.” Su Nan led those few Ice Fire God Palace disciples and quickly left. The other sect’s genius disciples also ignored them.

Jian Wushuang continued moving forward in the void and he simply stopped when he passed a desolate hill.

He sat cross-legged on the hill and closed his eyes.

“He stopped.”

The many genius disciples who followed Jian Wushuang around also stopped.

“So, you aren’t going to escape anymore?”

“Hmph, how could he escape under so many pairs of eyes? It’s better to find a place to sit down, regain his strength, and prepare for the last battle.”

“Not necessarily. I feel that he never wanted to escape from the beginning. He’s way too powerful and we may not even be able to take him down on our own. Let’s wait until the Great Compassionate Sect arrives.”

“The Great Compassionate Sect is already on their way and will be here soon.”

There were approximately dozens of sects which gathered around Jian Wushuang and perhaps a total of more than 200 genius disciples.

Even then, those genius disciples did not act rashly.

They had no confidence to do it.

All of them were scared witless by Jian Wushuang’s crazy massacre. Many genius disciples who were First-Class Divine Demons had been killed.

None of them wanted to be sacrificed under Jian Wushuang’s sword.

Therefore, without absolute certainty, they dared not act on impulse. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Wait.”

Although those genius disciples had an insatiable hunger for the position token on Jian Wushuang and his head, they could only remain patient and wait for the Great Compassion Sect disciples’ arrival.

Jian Wushuang was also patiently waiting.

It did not take long. More than 20 figures appeared at an astonishing speed from a distance in the void.

“The Great Compassionate Sect is here!”

The eyes of those sect disciples who had been waiting for a long time instantly lit up.

In just a brief moment, those 20 over figures appeared in front of the hill where Jian Wushuang was. They were led by a young man wearing purple armor, Long Zishan. Next to Long Zishan was a beautiful woman in a white robe who had a cold demeanor.

That gorgeous woman was Yu Aoqing, another Twelve Minor Kings belonging to the Great Compassion Sect and was ranked eighth!

Yu Aoqing[1], as her name depicted, was an extremely cold and proud person.

“Jian Wushuang!”

Long Zishan immediately darted his razor-sharp gaze directly at Jian Wushuang who was on the hill when he appeared.

“Is he Jian Wushuang?” Yu Aoqing also looked at Jian Wushuang, but both her eyes and expressions were extremely cold.

As for the other Great Compassion Sect disciples, they were gritting their teeth with anger.

The Great Compassion Sect had always been arrogant and many were accustomed to their behavior. As that was the case, their disciples were used to being aloof before disciples of other sects.

The other sects’ disciples were usually submissive towards the Great Compassion Sect disciples, but this time they suffered a big loss in Jian Wushuang’s hands.

Besides several core disciples who were beheaded by Jian Wushuang, even Pang Tao was killed.

That did not only instigated provocation toward the Great Compassion Sect but also shamed their disciples.

The shame could only be thoroughly washed away if Jian Wushuang was cut a thousand times.

When many Great Compassion Sect disciples arrived, Jian Wushuang, who was sitting on the hill slowly opened his eyes.

“Finally here? You guys are really slow.” Jian Wushuang smiled indifferently, but there was a trace of mockery in his voice.

“Jian Wushuang, I really admire you. You have offended all the sects. Each sects’ genius disciples are chasing after you. You are just like a street rat being besieged and you are still laughing?” Long Zishan stared at Jian Wushuang.

“A street rat? This adjective is not appropriate. After all, have you ever seen a cat being wantonly slaughtered by a street rat? As for being trapped, that’s not the case at all. At least, you people are not capable of doing that to me.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly.

Long Zishan’s gazes were extremely cold. “Really? Jian Wushuang, I admit that I had underestimated you before. Even Junior Brother Pang Tao died in your hands, but do you think you will have another chance now?”

“Junior Sister Aoqing, you and I will strike together,” whispered Long Zishan.

“Together?” Yu Aoqing was surprised.

Both of them were Twelve Minor Kings with one ranked third and the other eighth. They were both aloof and haughty at heart.

Yu Aoqing was reluctant to join forces with Long Zishan as their opponent was a Chaotic Realm younger generation disciple.
