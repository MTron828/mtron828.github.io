Chapter 1590: Threshold of Real God

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

In Lineage of Star, deacon elderlies were generally Eternal Real Gods.

The disciples could clearly see that there was really a fluctuation of divine power in Jian Wushuang. However, the aura that he gave out was only a Universe God’s.

A Universe God acting as a deacon elder?

Are you kidding me?

Just as the disciples were in shock and confusion, the latest Universe God ranking list finally spread among them.

They instantly found out about the shocking result that Jian Wushuang had displayed in the battle that took place in Burning Demon Region.

At the same time, they found out Jian Wushuang’s identity and knew that he was an inverse cultivator.

On top of that, they also found out that during the two times when Jian Wushuang had participated in the battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace, he had concealed his true realm.

Firstly, he had participated in a battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace among Universe God in the Second Heaven when he was a Universe God in the First Heaven. He had won against many disciples in Lineage of Star and was only second to the most outstanding Ling Feibai among Universe God in the Second Heaven.

Secondly, Jian Wushuang had participated in a battle to become a disciple of the Star Palace among Universe God in the Third Heaven when he was a Universe God in the Second Heaven. Then, he was the first place without a doubt.

He had joined battles in a cross-ranking but he had suppressed all the other geniuses in the end.

The disciples in Lineage of Star finally understood Jian Wushuang was a scary monster.

When they found out about the ins and outs of the matter, most of the disciples were dumbfounded.

…

In the cave dwelling that was made of unique crystals.

“Jian Wushuang, this is the token of a deacon elderly. Keep it properly. From today, you’re no longer a disciple of Lineage of Star but one of the higher-ups of Lineage of Star,” Hall Master Yuan passed the token to Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang took it and held it in his hand. He looked confused.

The surrounding deacon elderlies shared a look but there was no grievance.

Jian Wushuang had already proved himself using his result. He had the fighting power of an Eternal Real God. If so, he, of course, could become a deacon elderly and stand side by side with them.

“Elder Wushuang, from today onwards, you’re one of us.”

“Elder Wushuang…”

The surrounding deacon elderlies greeted him.

“Everyone is so courteous,” Jian Wushuang replied with a smile.

“Alright, dismissed. I have something to talk to Jian Wushuang about,” Hall Master Yuan said.

Many deacon elderlies, including Lei Chao, left.

In the cave dwelling, only Jian Wushuang and Hall Master Yuan were left.

Hall Master Yuan looked and said, “Jian Wushuang, your power could be compared favorably with an Eternal Real God’s. In Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries, you are considered one of the top experts. However, I have to remind you to be extremely cautious in action. After all, your identity as inverse cultivator has been revealed. There will be quite a few people in Eternal Chaotic World who want to kill you.”

“Hall Master Yuan, who are the people who want me dead? They are enemies of Lineage of Star?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Lineage of Star’s enemies are just a part of them. These grievances are public and are?easier to deal with. The ones that I’m warning you about are the hidden forces that are secretive,” Hall Master Yuan squinted.

“Hidden forces?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

“These hidden forces specialize in assassinating geniuses and experts in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. An inverse cultivator like you is definitely on their must-kill name list. You might even be really high in ranking. The hidden forces’ assassination measures are impressive and it is hard to prevent. They usually don’t take action, but when they do, even Lineage of Star will find it difficult to protect you,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“There’s such forces out there?” Jian Wushuang’s face changed.

A force that had specialized in assassinating geniuses and experts in Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries. Theoretically, such hidden forces should be a public enemy of Ten Cultivation Sanctuaries since long ago. But they had yet to be exterminated. The factor alone showed the hidden forces weren’t ordinary.

“In short, be careful at all times. Of course, the hidden forces only conceal themselves in the dark. If there wasn’t definite confidence, they wouldn’t take action recklessly. Hence, don’t let them find any opportunity,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“I understand,” Jian Wushuang nodded and he grew solemn.

“Oh yeah, you just passed through the third inverse cultivation test. You should have great room for improvement in terms of your power, right?” Hall Master Yuan suddenly asked.

Hearing that, Jian Wushuang smiled and replied, “I do have some space for improvement.”

“If so, seize the time to increase your power. Power is the most important thing to fall back on. If you were to be powerful enough, and you are already close, as long as you reach the level of Real God Wu Bei, the hidden forces who intend to take action against you will have scruples. With your potential, you can totally achieve the standard of Real God Wu Bei and even higher,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Mm,” Jian Wushuang nodded heavily, “Hall Master Yuan, I should be able to cultivate the second episode of Xuan Mie Golden Body but I’ll need some auxiliary treasure. I hope you can prepare them for me.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“No problem, I’ll send it over in a few days,” Hall Master Yuan promised straightforwardly.

Jian Wushuang immediately returned to Sword Star.

“Mister, you’re back!”

Qiu Yue and the other maidservants saw Jian Wushuang and were thrilled when they found out that not only had Jian Wushuang recovered his power, he had also become a deacon elderly of Lineage of Star.

“Qiu Yue, you should have remained in the realm of Universe God in the Third Heaven for very long, right?” Jian Wushuang looked at Qiu Yue.

“Mm, it has been hundreds of thousands of years,” Qiu Yue nodded faintly.

“Hundreds of thousands of years, within Lineage of Star where she gets extra resources, but she didn’t break through and become a Real God?” Jian Wushuang shook his head in silence. He knew that Qiu Yue had a slim hope to break through and become a Real God.

In the Eternal Chaotic World, after a Universe God passed through his three God’s tests, Real God would aim to break into the realm of a Real God.

However, it wasn’t that easy to break through and become a Real God.

There were countless Universe God in Eternal Chaotic World and there were countless Universe Gods in the Third Heaven, but more than ninety-nine percent of them wouldn’t be able to break through and become Real Gods among the Universe Gods.

It was because the threshold of Real God was extremely high.

Previously, Jian Wushuang heard from King of Venomous Worms. For a Universe God to break through and become a Real God, he had to fulfill four conditions.

First, create a Real God unique skill.

Second, have consciousness at the Real God level.

Third, increase his power to his limit, to the point where there was no room for improvement.

Fourth, have a chance to break through.

Of the four conditions, not a single one could be omitted.

However, out of the four conditions, merely the first and the second conditions itself could stop ninety percent of Universe Gods.

After all, most of the Universe Gods had limited natural abilities. To be able to create a Real God unique skill at the level of Universe God, or for one’s consciousness to reach a Real God’s level, it was a wild wish.
