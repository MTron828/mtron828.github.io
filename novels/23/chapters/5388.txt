5389 Battle Formation

Crack!

A tier 3 Emperor, deep within a pit, probed and touched the seemingly round stone. The next moment, it began to crack open.

The onlookers' expressions tightened slightly, and as the sphere split open, it revealed an unexpected hollowness.

Inside, there was nothing - colorless and tasteless.

Seeing that there was nothing amiss, the crowd breathed a sigh of relief.

Gutong, silent until now, showed no reaction.

The spheres in the other pits also began to crack open one after another. Over 100 spheres split open, with only 18 containing an ancient scepter. The rest, like the first one, were hollow.

"This is a formation! Quickly, get rid of it!"Y√¥ur fùíÇvorite stories on ùíè/o/(v)ùíÜ/lbùíän(.)cùíêm

Jian Wushuang roared, but it was already too late.

The scepters erupted with streams of light, instantly covering the surrounding billions of miles.

"Call for help!"

Gutong was the first to crush his token, looking back towards the City of Suppression.

At this moment, the massive city behind them was gone.

It was over!

Many Emperor-level experts realized they had fallen into a trap.

Even if the message could be transmitted, the powerful figures in

the City of Suppression would likely be unable to locate them due to the spatial blockade.

Tick, tock!

Jian Wushuang remained relatively calm, fortunate enough.

Crouching down, he gazed at the murky water in a puddle beneath his feet. Just moments ago, it was tranquil, but now ripples began to form.

This prompted him to quickly stand up and look ahead.

Although his Thought power couldn't detect any changes, his physical strength was formidable. His observational skills surpassed even those of an Emperor. At a glance, he saw the scene unfolding millions of miles away.

Countless wriggling crawlers were madly rushing towards this direction.

"Formation!"

Seeing the perilous situation, Jian Wushuang swiftly moved, retreating behind the others.

The Emperor, who had long developed a reflex to the word "formation", instantly gathered around Jian Wushuang, and the Luo Hou Battle Formation quietly assembled.

Ah!

A quaint voice echoed from the majestic mouth of a deity and demon.

"Luo Hou!"bender

Xia Mang Guanyu's bristling fur caused a commotion.

If it were anyone else daring to act like this, they would have been slashed and cut long ago. However, Xia Mang Guanyu, being a prince, coupled with the current blockade of the area, if Xia Mang Guanyu were to fall, Gutong would also find it hard to escape blame.

The next moment, Gutong was stunned. In the distance, the mud in the swamp surged, and something unknown had reached them.

"Prepare to face the enemy!"

At this point, they couldn't care less whether the City of Suppression had received the message. They had to withstand this obstacle in front of them first.

600,000 troops lined up in a straight line, and numerous formations began to take shape.

Ancient wild beasts, contemporary deities and demons, and powerful Emperors all soared into the air.

Soon, the 600,000 troops converged into several hundred ancient powerhouses. The source of this content is n*ov*eln*ex*t.C*om

Each one of them possessed the strength of a tier 4 Emperor.


No wonder, with just these people, the Tianqi tribe could easily defeat them with a casual deployment. But why hadn't the Tianqi tribe made a move yet?

Clearly, they were watching them self-destruct.

Thinking of this, Jian Wushuang couldn't help but turn his head to look at the barrier behind him.

Sure enough, in the next moment, countless troops arrived.

It was Xuanyuan Dapan personally leading the army, numbering over ten million.

The barrier was unidirectional, easily broken from the outside, but getting out was extremely difficult.

"Grandpa, we've been fooled!" Xia Mang Guanyu shouted and rushed over.

Xuanyuan Dapan also noticed the changes in the void.

With so many powerful individuals entering this space, many parts of the void had started to rupture, revealing pitch-black gaps, inside of which flowed dangerous spatial turbulence.
