Chapter 3826: There Was Nowhere to Run

Translator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation

After getting the Life Core Fragment from the Blood Stone, Jian Wushuang saw that he was completely surrounded by tens of thousands of monsters. He immediately used the Dragon Killing Secret Skill, it had only been a short while, but he had used up 40% of his divine power. Including the previous consumption, he had less than 50% of his divine power left.

However, Jian Wushuang finally opened a crack in the encirclement of thousands of monsters.

The crack was very small, and the monsters coming from other directions could easily fill it up again. However, Jian Wushuang still seized the opportunity.

Jian Wushuang spread his Celestial Light Wings crazily. He tried his best to activate the power of his Celestial Light Wings, and then he used the shadow movement technique to move crazily among the monsters.

In the blink of an eye, he had already rushed to the edge of the battlefield.

“Kill!”

He swept his sword essence, and in an instant, countless tiny sword shadows burst out.

These tiny sword shadows scattered on the monsters in front of him like drops of rain.

Suddenly, one monster after another was pierced through the abdomen, and a large number of monster corpses fell at the same time.

Sword Rain —

The group attack swordsmanship created by Jian Wushuang.

The power of this swordsmanship was not very strong. After all, it was scattered too much and could only be used to kill some weaklings.

However, after using the Dragon Killing Secret Skill, his battle strength was extremely strong. He was probably close to a Ruler at the peak of the second level. In the face of such strong battle strength, these monsters, which only had the advanced level of the first level and the peak of the Ruler level, were weaklings.

......

As the Sword Rain covered the area, the sword shadows, which were like raindrops, could easily kill one monster after another.

Another group of monster corpses fell down. At this moment, there were less than 100 monsters blocking Jian Wushuang’s way.

Jian Wushuang’s speed reached its peak. He killed and rushed at his fastest speed. Finally, he broke out of the encirclement of more than 10,000 monsters.

“I’m out, I’m finally out!”

Jian Wushuang was overjoyed.

He had broken out of the encirclement of more than 10,000 monsters. Although he would be chased and blocked by a large number of monsters, he had a lot of leeway to fight back.

“Run, run as fast as you can!” Jian Wushuang did not dare to stop and ran forward.

His speed was already extremely fast. After using the Dragon Killing Secret Skill, his speed had increased greatly. It was far from what the monsters behind him could compare to. Even the two general-level monsters…were also much slower than Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang could easily shake off the monsters behind him.

However…

While Jian Wushuang was being surrounded by tens of thousands of monsters, a large number of monsters had rushed over. Now, there were a large number of monsters around Jian Wushuang.

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang directly released the Triple Magic Light Domain to its maximum, covering an area of a million miles. His soul power was covered within the Magic Light Domain, he immediately sensed the existence of many monsters within a million miles of him.

“Oh my God.”

After seeing the scene within a million miles of him, Jian Wushuang was a little dumbfounded.

There were too many, too many.

Perhaps it was because of the previous robbery that these monsters were on guard. Now, there were far more monsters gathered around the Life Core Fragment than when he first snatched it, Jian Wushuang only felt that the area within his domain was filled with the aura of monsters. Almost all of them were hundreds or thousands of monsters gathered together.

At a glance, there were definitely more than 100,000 monsters rushing over from all directions within a million miles!

100,000 monsters!

This number was too terrifying.

Although he had just escaped from the encirclement of more than 10,000 monsters, only he knew how much divine power he had consumed in that short period of time. In that encirclement…he could not last long, so he had to kill his way out as quickly as possible.

However, with his remaining divine power, if he was surrounded by more than 10,000 monsters, he was not confident that he could kill his way out again.

Not to mention, there were more than 10,000 monsters surrounding him.

The thought of being surrounded by 100,000 monsters made Jian Wushuang’s scalp tingle. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“I have to escape. I have to think of a way to escape. I can’t be surrounded by these monsters.” Jian Wushuang was a little frightened.

As for the Dragon Killing Secret Skill, he immediately stopped using it after he had shaken off the 10,000 monsters.

After all, this secret skill consumed too much divine power. In just a short while, he had less than 50% of his divine power. If he continued to burn it, his divine power would soon be exhausted, at that time, he would not need the monsters to attack. He would die because his divine power was exhausted and his divine body would lose its vitality.

Jian Wushuang fled while thinking of a way.

His soul power could clearly see the number and location of all the monsters within a million miles.

“There are too many monsters surrounding me this time. I can’t break through the obstacles like last time and find a place without monsters to hide. I even feel that I can’t break through this blockade.” Jian Wushuang’s face was unsightly.

Yes, he found that although those monsters were less intelligent, they still had some basic common sense. Moreover, the two general-level monsters were obviously more intelligent.

The two general-level monsters knew that they were surrounded by them. They could even find Jian Wushuang’s location through their domains. The most important thing was that there were too many monsters. There were so many monsters…the two general-level monsters could order them to form a huge encirclement net without leaving any gaps, making it almost impossible for them to escape from their encirclement.

The monsters could still do such a simple encirclement under the command of the general-level monsters.

“Now that I’m in their encirclement, they only need to slowly approach me. When the encirclement shrinks, they will naturally be able to find me easily. My best way now is to find the weakest place to rush out before their encirclement shrinks completely, but…” Jian Wushuang frowned deeply.

He wanted to think of a way to break out of the encirclement now.

However, he discovered that even the weakest part of the encirclement could easily gather up to 10,000 monsters in a short period of time.

In other words, if he wanted to break out of the encirclement, he would at least have to face a huge obstacle of gathering up to 10,000 monsters.
