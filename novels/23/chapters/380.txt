Chapter 381: He Is Lin Lan’s Master!

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Silence!

Deathly stillness!

Disciples on the Martial Arts Practice Field, including those high-ranking experts in the stands, were all shocked with widened eyes.

Such a powerful killing intent!

The more Jian Wushuang comprehended Slaughter Origin, the more aggressive was his killing intent. Fully unleashing his killing intent, Jian Wushuang could even frighten experts in Pinnacle of The Saint Realm, let alone those of the Lin family.

Even Saint Realm experts of Lin family had never seen such a powerful killing intent.

It was too powerful for them to fight.

At the moment, Jian Wushuang’s eyes turned to First Madam and his cold voice drummed heavily in her heart.

“Traveling around the world, I say what I want, do what I want!”

“Can’t I express my thoughts in the Lin family?”

“First Madam, I am here now, please repeat what you said just now.”

Jian Wushuang said in a forceful tone.

He slowly spoke the words one by one. Each one finished with more powerful killing intent, which terrified First Madam more, and more.

When he finished saying that, the killing intent in him had risen to the peak. First Madam felt like she was on the brink of breakdown.

Eyes wide opened and her graceful face reddened, she opened her mouth to speak, but nothing came out.

It was as if she was choked.

Horror!

Covering all of her!

She suffered in the horror, every second.

However, Jian Wushuang was stern, cool and unmoved.

Lin family, a mid-sized family in Iron Saber Territory, had eight Saint Realm experts. However, the strongest hadn’t reached Pinnacle of the Saint Realm yet but was just in Stage-three Domain. Therefore, Jian Wushuang didn’t take them to heart.

“Mr., Mr. Swordsman.”

Lin Xian said and looked at Jian Wushuang with fear.

They thought Jian Wushuang was just an ordinary young Saint Realm expert. But he was not.

“He must be an old monster, definitely old, but retaining youthful looks in some way,” roared Saint Realm experts of Lin family in their mind.

They couldn’t imagine how strong Jian Wushuang was.

How could he be 20 years old?

“Mr. Swordsman, forgive us, it’s just a misunderstanding.” Lin Xian was modest and said respectfully.

“Hum.” Jian Wushuang snorted and then the explosive killing intent slowly withdrew.

Feeling the killing intent vanishing, they let out a sigh of relief.

However, First Madam’s face was still red. She took a glance at Jian Wushuang in fear and dared not to say anything.

“Elder Lin Zong.” Jian Wushuang looked at him and said coldly, “You said that my disciple killed those seven spirit beasts with external treasure, could you tell us what she used and how she killed the seven beasts at Peak of the Yang Void Realm in half a day!”

“You’d better tell us every detail, otherwise, I promise you won’t live to tomorrow.”

“It, it...” Jian Wushuang’s words made Lin Zong’s flesh creep. Thinking of the terrible killing intent, Lin Zong couldn’t help breaking into a cold sweat and stammering badly.

“Mr. Swordsman, Please excuse Elder Lin Zong for having offended your disciple just now...” Lin Xian was defending for Lin Zong, but suddenly he realized, “Disciple?”

People on the Martial Arts Practice Field were also surprised.

“Disciple?”

“Did Swordsman say that she was his disciple?”

At the moment, Lin Lan bowed respectfully and said, “Master.”

“Em.” Jian Wushuang nodded slightly.

Their conversation confirmed the relationship between them.

“Has Lin Lan, made Swordsman her master?”

“That’s why Swordsman spoke out for her.”

“Surely a Master would.”

People on the Martial Arts Practice Field understood.

“Lin Lan.” Jian Wushuang called.

Lin Lan turned.

“Since they questioned your strength, prove yourself.” Jian Wushuang said in a deep voice.

“Yes.” Lin Lan nodded. Then she turned and looked at Lin Yu, who was still stunned in amazement.

“Lin Yu!” Lin Lan shot a sharp and cold sight. Immediately a strong Spiritual Power burst out.

It shocked all people at the spot.

“Peak of Yang Void Realm!”

“How could that be?”

“She had slipped back to Profound Yin Void Realm three days ago!”

“Could it be...”

One possibility came into their thought.

Which could explain it.

That was, the Witch Poison in Lin Lan’s body had been removed.

“How could that be?”

People in the stands were also in shock.

They had tried many ways to remove the Witch Poison from Lin Lan by asking for help from experts and alchemists, even experts of Pinnacle of the Saint Realm.

However, all failed.

How could the Witch Poison be removed?

Within three days, not only had the Witch Poison been removed, but her strength was fully restored.

In a mysterious way...

People in the stands, including Lin Xian and First Madam, turned to Jian Wushuang, who sat in a chair tapping his fingers on the chair with a light smile.

They knew what Lin Lan was like three days ago. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Today, however, Lin Lan regained her strength and called Swordsman Master.

They also saw the terrible killing intent Jian Wushuang released just now, all these had proved it.

It was him who removed the Witch Poison in Lin Lan’s body and brought her strength back within three days!

All this was due to Swordsman.
