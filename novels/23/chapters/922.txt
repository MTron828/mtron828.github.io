Chapter 923: Life or Death

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Creation Level Dao?”

The experts present expressed their admiration but they were not surprised. They had recognized it too.

An Eternal Realm who wanted to be a Dao Master had to develop his own Dao.

And the Dao that was cultivated had various Levels.

In the Eternal World, the Dao that was cultivated had three Levels, General Level, Universe Level and Creation Level!

A higher the Dao Level would result in greater?strength after breaking through Dao Master.

Like Bodhi Dan, it helped a Eternal Realm to cultivate his own Dao in a very short time. The basic Dao cultivated was General Level.

The Creation Level Dao was more than ten times stronger than General Level Dao.

Xia Mang had cultivated Creation Level Dao, but it was not perfect.

“No wonder he is the first genius in the Eternal World.?He had the courage to develop Creation Level Dao as a Eternal Realm. How bold and resolute!”

“If he had cultivated General Level or Universe Level Dao, he would have taken a long time to become a Dao Master.”

“What an exceptional genius!”

Many experts sang his praises.

Xia Yu from Xia Clan was filled with pride as he heard the others’ acclaimations.

In the Drill Ground, Li Tianchou changed into a huge deep sea within which many figures appeared. The figures struck Xia Mang with Killing Moves. These included the cold and domineering Saber Technique and a huge black mountain striking towards Xia Mang.

Xia Mang stood in the middle of black sea and dealt with the attacks calmly and effortlessly.

“That’s it.”

Xia Mang’s lips curled and pressed his hand outwards.

The force from this move rushed toward the huge black sea in front of him and cracked the Void before him. This horrible power continued to pass to the black sea.

The impact set off huge waves in the black sea.?At the same time, the black sea began to shrink at an alarming rate. After a moment, the black sea gathered together and the figure of Li Tianchou appeared.

Li Tianchou’s face was pale. A trace of blood hung in the corner of his mouth and his aura was weak.

“No wonder you are the first Eternal Realm in the Eternal World, Xia Mang. I thought we would have a close fight, even if I could not defeat you with my ability. It never occurred to me that I can’t even make you show your full strength. Now I am utterly convinced that I have lost this fight.” Li Tianchou said with a low voice.

“You did well.” Xia Mang made a small obeisance.

People in the Drill Ground were all inwardly amazed at the result of the fight and Li Tianchou’s words/

“Li Tianchou is very powerful, but he still lost the fight. Xia Mang didn’t even use all his strength!”

“The result should be acceptable to Li Tianchou. After all, his opponent is Xia Mang.”

“Xia Mang is so strong that no one in the Eternal Realms can defeat him.”

Chatter broke out among the audience along the Perimeter of the Drill Ground.

Li Tianchou withdrew.

Having witnessed Xia Mang’s prowess, the geniuses who had been hesitant about challenging Xia Mang looked at each other and smiled bitterly. They were now certain that they had no way of challenging him.

They would be easily defeated by Xia Mang so there was no point in embarrassing themselves by challenging him.

Xia Mang’s grin widened and was filled with menace as he glared at Jian Wushuang.

“Jian Wushuang.”

Xia Mang’s resounding voice reverberated through the Drill Ground.

“Two hundred years ago, outside the Cercis Island, you killed my brother Xia Yan. Today, at this Selection Ceremony, would you dare to have a fight with his brother?

“Life or Death!”

Xia Mang’s voice had become extremely cold at the last few words.

The Drill Ground was in uproar.

“Challenge was from Xia Mang to Jian Wushuang, instead of Jian Wushuang challenging Xia Mang?”

“Haha, it’s getting more interesting!”

“Does Jian Wushuang dare accept the challenge?”

“Accept the challenge? He is stupid if he accepts. This is a strength competition. It’s not like the first round of wedding gifts competition. Besides, Xia Mang has declared a life-or-death duel. Even if Xia Mang kills Jian Wushuang in the fight, he will receive no punishment!”

“How cruel Xia Mang is!’

Voices filled with horror echoed through the Drill Ground.

The audience waited in anticipation.

They wanted to know if Jian Wushuang, who had violently opposed Xia Mang from the very beginning, won the first wedding gifts competition and crushed Xia Mang thoroughly, dared to accept to Xia Mang’s challange, a life-or-death Duel!

The top experts in the stand wore interested expressions.

“Elder Xia Yu, this Selection Ceremony is held by Emperor Leng. I’m afraid it’s not good to have a killing happen here?” A Master from a big clan beside Xia Yu exclaimed.

“Hum, Jian Wushuang killed second master of Xia Clan. How can this be so simple?” “I have said that no one can protect him today. As for Selection Ceremony… we, Xia Clan, of course, won’t go against Emperor Leng. If Jian Wushuang has no courage, he can just refuse the challenge. Xia Clan will find another chance after the Selection Ceremony to kill him.”?Xia Yu added coldly.

Xue Lingtian, who was quietly sitting opposite Xia Yu, smiled slightly when he heard Xia Yu’s words.

“Challenge my little junior brother? And a life-or-death duel?”

“Ha, Xia Mang is really good at digging his own grave!”

Xue Lingtian laughed coldly and said nothing.

“Idiot, Xia Mang is really an idiot.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

In the same stand, Wang Yuan, who was sitting beside Alchemy Master, laughed out with no mercy, “Others say he is the first Eternal Realm in the Eternal World and he really believes it! He has just never met our third brother!”

“This Xia Mang is looking for his own death.” Yang Zaixuan nodded as he stood beside him with his arms crossed over his chest.

With all eyes on him, Jian Wushuang stepped forward. He lifted his sharp eyes and stared at Xia Mang. He spoke with an icy voice. Its effect was akin to that of a furious thunder blast.

“You want to fight? So be it!”

“Between you and me, it’s life or death!”
