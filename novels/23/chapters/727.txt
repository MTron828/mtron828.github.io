Chapter 728: Launching Challenges Frenetically

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

Just as Gu Yang predicted, as time passed, Jian Wushuang was progressing rapidly.

After he passed the third stage of the Heaven Level Test, it only took him another six months to overcome the fourth stage.

Later, Jian Wushuang stayed in the Underground Palace to hone his fighting skills. And he spent most of his time focusing on the Heaven Level Test.

It was the fifth stage of the Heaven Level Test.

In this stage, thickly dotted Puppet Fighters holding various weapons and launching all sorts of attacks would pour in from all directions. Jian Wushuang had to face the siege of 100 Puppet Fighters all alone, with simply one sword in his hand.

His swordsmanship was both unmatched and elaborate, almost flawless.

His moves were also incredibly swift. He dashed, shifted, and leaped with great agility, fooling around with the 100 Puppet Fighters. Although there were 100 Puppet Fighters besieging him, as he made every move, only 20 or fewer Puppet Fighters would attack him simultaneously.

If all 100 Puppet Fighters launched an attack simultaneously, Jian Wushuang would have definitely struggled to deal with them.

But with only 20 Puppet Fighters attacking at one time, it was much easier for him to handle.

“Drop dead!”

Jian Wushuang’s longsword suddenly flashed out like a bolt of lightning, which flitted across the two Puppet Fighters right in front of him. The sword went so fast that both of the two Puppet Fighters were struck down before they could react.

When the two Puppet Fighters were defeated, the ring of encirclement before Jian Wushuang instantly revealed a crack. Then, the power of Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship was unleashed.

He started fighting frantically. In the end, he fended off all of the 100 Puppet Fighters and got out.

He had passed the fifth stage of the Heaven Level Test!

Walking out of the Heaven Level Test, Jian Wushuang felt quite relieved.

“The Heaven Level Test is far more difficult than the Human Level Test and the Earth Level Test. The scale of the difficulty goes higher and higher in the order of the nine stages. It only took me six months to get through the fourth stage, but to nail the fifth stage, I spent six full years.” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

By now, he had stayed in the Eighth Tribe for six years and seven months.

During this time, he spent most of his time in the Underground Palace. But up to now, he only made it to the fifth stage of the Heaven Level Test.

“There are nine stages with increasing difficulty. Since the fifth stage is so much harder than the fourth, the sixth stage must be way harder than the fifth. Even for me, without at least ten years’ practice, it’ll be highly difficult to get through the sixth stage.” Jian Wushuang mumbled to himself.

But anyway, the speed of his progress already defied the natural order.

After all, in the whole Eighth Tribe, no one had ever passed the fifth stage of the Heaven Level Test before. He was the first one to achieve it, and all it cost him was six years.

In the eyes of other clansmen, this was almost unthinkable.

“The tests in the Underground Palace were extraordinarily useful in upgrading my battling techniques. However, in the three kinds of tests, all I need to confront are just Puppet Fighters. No matter what, Puppet Fighters are merely puppets. There must still be a huge gap between puppets and real Human Warriors.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“I’ve already conquered the fifth stage of the Heaven Level Test. It’s would be meaningless to stay on and try to break through the sixth stage.”

Shaking his head, Jian Wushuang left the Underground Palace.

Soon after he left the Underground Palace, he went straight for a clansman of the Eighth Tribe.

“Gu Jin, I want to challenge you.” Jian Wushuang announced, staring at the tall and sturdy clansman of the Ancient God Clan before him.

This clansman was called Gu Jin. He was a One-star Ancient God with an awakened bloodline, a Silver-armored Ancient God. Although it was not long since he had awakened his bloodline and though his strength was considered average among all the One-star Silver-armored Ancient God, he was still on par with a superior Divine Realm expert of Human Warriors, or even qualified to be a top-ranking superior Divine Realm expert.

“Jian Wushuang, you, a kid with no awakened bloodline, want to challenge me?” Gu Jin asked with a curious expression.

“Yes, take your best shot. Strike now.” Jian Wushuang said with overbearing battle intent.

“Then boy, you’d better be careful, I won’t go easy on you!” Gu Jin’s eyes were glistening with a touch of fury. Then he launched an attack.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were burning with eagerness. He immediately thrust his Emperor Sword forward. He did not perform the Sword Heart power but had fully released the energy of the third level of the Star-river Secret Skill. Relying on his swordsmanship and his battling techniques he had honed in the Underground Palace for six years, he went straightforward to take on Gu Jin.

At first, Gu Jin did not treat this fight with Jian Wushuang seriously. But after crossing swords with his opponent, he was taken aback by Jian Wushuang’s superior swordsmanship. In that moment, he transformed into a Silver-armored Ancient God and got ready to unleash all of his power during this battle against Jian Wushuang.

The intense battle continued.

Jian Wushuang’s swordsmanship and battling techniques were more powerful than Gu Jin’s. But without employing the Sword Heart power, Gu Jin’s strength would have far been superior to Jian Wushuang’s. Thus, in the battle of pure force, Jian Wushuang tangled with Gu Jin for a long time and finally ended up being defeated due to a minor disadvantage.

“Impressive. Without awakened bloodline, he fought against me solely with his swordsmanship and battling techniques. His abilities can nearly parallel mine!” After defeating Jian Wushuang, Gu Jin felt quite surprised by this battle.

Gu Jin was very clear that, even though he had beaten Jian Wushuang, he merely scraped a win.

The strength Jian Wushuang just displayed was not much less than his own.

And most crucially Jian Wushuang was still making rapid progress.

“There’s still plenty of room for my strength to improve.”

“Now, who’s next!”

Jian Wushuang looked to challenge anyone present.

There were numerous experts in the Ancient God Clan. In the Eighth Tribe, there were already around 10,000 One-star Ancient Gods that could rival superior Divine Realm experts of Human Warriors. Some of them had reached the top level of superior Divine Realm experts, and some even exceeded the range of what the superior Divine Realm experts of Human Warriors were capable of.

These clansmen were all targets that Jian Wushuang wanted to challenge.

When he challenged others to a fight, he always avoided using his Sword Heart power. He merely relied on his own strength mingled with the Star-river Secret Skill along with his swordsmanship and battle techniques.

These kinds of challenges would be as effective as the tests of the Underground Palace. Perhaps, it could push the limits of his skills even higher.

Challenging others frantically!

Fighting against others frantically!

Jian Wushuang would challenge three or four One-star Ancient Gods almost every day. After each of these fights, he would also spend some time reflecting on his performance and summarizing important points. The next day, he would start a new round of challenges.

Through this kind of feverish challenges, his strength kept soaring as well.

As seasons came and went, time flew by.

Now, Jian Wushuang had stayed in the Eighth Tribe for ten years.
