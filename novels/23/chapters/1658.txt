1659 Real God Peng Huo

“They are indeed shameless,” Jian Wushuang sneered.

It was Real God Xue Ling and Real God Gu Ying who had cast their greedy eyes on his Grade Three Demon Core and they had wanted to kill him for that. However, in the end, the Soaring Heaven King Palace said that he was the one who had cast his eyes on their treasure. Thus, he had launched a surprise attack of his own accord and killed Real God Gu Ying as a result.

“Hall Master Yuan, how do you plan to reply the Soaring Heaven King Palace?” Jian Wushuang questioned.

“I shall reply the correct way.” Hall Master Yuan said indifferently, “By comparing abilities, the Soaring Heaven King Palace is indeed slightly more powerful than the Lineage of Star. However, they are not a lot more powerful than us. Even if we were to fight, the Lineage of Star would not be afraid of the Soaring Heaven King Palace. Moreover, the Soaring Heaven King Palace is not daring enough to shed all pretenses of cordiality with the Lineage of Star completely.”

“However, although the Soaring Heaven King Palace cannot do anything to the Lineage of Star, they can still think of ways to deal with you. For example, they can send experts to the Eighth Lair or get the experts in the Eighth Lair to kill you.”

“From what I know, there are currently four experts of the Soaring Heaven King Palace travelling in the Eighth Lair. Apart from one of them who is in the outer layer as he is an Eternal Real God, the three remaining people are all Chaotic Real Gods. Moreover, among the three Chaotic Real Gods, the person who you have to be careful of is Real God Zi Ye!”

“That Real God Zi Ye is an expert who stands at the top of the Chaotic Real Gods and is also extremely near to the Real God ranking list. He has also been travelling in the core region of the Eighth Lair all the while. Hence, if he were to come across you, he would definitely kill you without hesitation.”

“Real God Zi Ye?” Jian Wushuang’s expression changed. He had also heard of Real God Zi Ye before.

“Jian Wushuang, for this period of time, I will get someone to observe the movements of the Soaring Heaven King Palace’s experts. If the Soaring Heaven King Palace sends experts to the Eighth Lair, I will inform you immediately. Also, please be extra careful in the Eighth Lair,” Hall Master Yuan said.

“Understood,” Jian Wushuang nodded his head and cut off the transmission to Hall Master Yuan immediately.

After that, Jian Wushuang muttered to himself.

“That Real God Zi Ye has been travelling in the core region of the Eighth Lair throughout the years and it just so happens that I have decided to go to the core region as well.”

Normally, normal Chaotic Real Gods would travel in the inner layer of the Eighth Lair. With Jian Wushuang’s abilities, he could definitely travel in the core region.

By going to the core region, there would be more opportunities for him to obtain Demon Cores. However, it would naturally be more dangerous as well.

“I hope that I would be able to meet him at that time. I really wish to see whether Real God Zi Ye has the ability to make me use my full power,” Jian Wushuang laughed. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

From the time that he made a breakthrough to a Real God to the current moment, he had been training to raise his own abilities. Even though he had fought against someone else in the Thunderbolt Island, it was merely a duel.

Previously, when he had fought against Real God Xue Ling and Real God Gu Ying… as they were merely two normal Chaotic Real Gods, they had no right to make him use his full power.

In other words, up until that moment, he had never used his full power to fight with someone else before.

Jian Wushuang headed to the core region. If he were to come across Star Demons along the way, he would kill them.

In less than half a year’s time, Jian Wushuang entered the core region of the Eighth Lair.

The core region was the core of the Eighth Level. It was the place with the most number of Star Demons and also the place with the most powerful Star Demons.

Just like before, the core region was also in complete darkness and no shard of light could be seen at all. In the void, Jian Wushuang was travelling forward slowly. He had already spread his Soul Power across the surrounding so that he could pay attention to a large radius from him.

His Soul Power covered a huge range and it would naturally be easier for him to find Star Demons. This was a great advantage that Jian Wushuang had over the Chaotic Real Gods.

By searching like that, Jian Wushuang found traces of Star Demons in no time.

Tens of Star Demons were gathered together. Moreover, what had caused Jian Wushuang to be elated was that there was a greater proportion of mature Star Demons among them.

For example, in the inner layer and outer layer, it was considered not too bad for there to be one mature Star Demon among tens of Star Demons and the proportion was one to ten.

However, for the core region, on average, there would be one mature Star Demon for every ten Star Demons.

At that very moment, there was a total of six mature One-Horned Star Demons among the tens of Star Demons that Jian Wushuang was facing.

“Time to kill them.”

Jian Wushuang’s body floated toward the group of Star Demons immediately.

For the next period of time, Jian Wushuang continued to hunt and kill Star Demons while travelling in the core region.

Even with his abilities, he still needed to be careful in the core region. As long as he did not come across places that were extremely concentrated with Star Demons, it would not be too dangerous. With that, as he hunted Star Demons, the number of Demon Cores in his Qian Kun Ring would naturally increase.

In a flash, two years passed by.

Boom!

With a fierce booming sound, the black, vast void was completely torn open during the battle.

Frightening sword essence was sweeping across the area.

While the sword essence was sweeping across the area, a shrill and horrible shriek could be heard.

After a long time, the battle came to an end.

Jian Wushuang appeared on the ground and he was looking at the body of the Star Demon in front of him. The Star Demon had three horns on its forehead and it was a Grade Three Star Demon.

However, this Grade Three Star Demon was different from the Grade Three Star Demon that Jian Wushuang had killed previously. This Grade Three Star Demon’s body was completely black in color and its skin did not have any parts that were green in color. In terms of abilities, it was also slightly weaker than the previous Grade Three Star Demon.

“There are extremely few Grade Three Star Demons in the inner layer. Back then, my luck was good and I managed to come across one. However, in the core region, as long as I look diligently, I will be able to find them easily.” As Jian Wushuang laughed, he waved his hands and kept the Grade Three Star Demon’s Demon Core into his Qian Kun Ring.

However, at that very moment…

“Eh?”

Jian Wushuang looked toward the void beside him at once, “Someone has come. What a coincidence.”

It was indeed a coincidence. When he had killed the Three-Horned Star Demon previously, he had chanced upon Real God Xue Ling and Real God Gu Ying. At that very moment, when he had killed his second Grade Three Star Demon, he had chanced upon another human cultivator.

“I hope that the person who comes this time around will not be the same as the two people from the Soaring Heaven King Palace,” Jian Wushuang muttered.

In no time, the person appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

It was a chubby old man. He had a stalwart body and he was close to two hundred and fifty centimeters tall. When he stood in his position, he looked like a small mountain.

“You are… Real God Peng Huo?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Haha. The person in front of me should be the famous Inverse Cultivator, Jian Wushuang,” the chubby old man laughed. His voice was gentle and charming.

“I am Jian Wushuang. Greetings to Real God Peng Huo,” Jian Wushuang greeted him with a modest expression.

Jian Wushuang knew about Real God Peng Huo.

He was a member of the Sanctuary Alliance but he was not in any powerhouses. Instead, he was an expert who travelled alone and he was extremely powerful.

It was rumored that Real God Peng Huo had fought with an expert of the Real God ranking list before. Moreover, he was never at a disadvantage during the fight. Although it was unknown whether the rumor was true, there had to be a reason for the rumor to exist. Hence, this indicated how powerful Real God Peng Huo was.
