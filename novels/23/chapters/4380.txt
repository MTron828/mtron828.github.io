4383 I’ll Give You a Chance

Three years passed by in a flash.

One of the nine forbidden grounds in the extreme north of the universe.

Under a ten thousand year old ice mountain.

“Ancestor, how is Jian Wushuang? Do I have to keep sleeping like this?”

The Overlord asked as he placed Jian Wushuang on a huge ice bed.

At that moment, Jian Wushuang’s aura was extremely weak. His eyes were tightly closed and he had fallen into the deepest sleep.

Beside him, Leng Rushuang, who had just come out of the heaven suppressing monument, held Jian Wushuang’s hand tightly. She looked at the sleeping Jian Wushuang with heartache.

When the white-haired ancestor heard this, he shook his head and sighed, “Grandson, this little guy’s divine body has been shattered sixty-seven times. It’s already a great fortune that he’s still alive. However, his life force has been injured. I’m afraid it’s impossible for him to wake up.”

“Is that so?” The Overlord’s expression turned grave.

Leng Rushuang’s heart skipped a beat when she heard this. She knelt down in front of the white-haired man with a thud. Her clear voice became hoarse and her eyes were bloodshot.

“Senior, I know you have a way. Please save my husband!”

“Hey, what are you doing? Please get up.”

The white-haired ancestor quickly helped Leng Rushuang up and shook his head, “Little girl, Jian Wushuang once saved my grandson’s life. We, the Overlord clan, have never owed anyone anything. If I can save him, I will naturally not be stingy. However, his life force has been damaged. Ordinary methods won’t be able to save him.”

At this point, he sighed.

Leng Rushuang trembled and her lips trembled. She asked in despair, “Senior, is…is there really no way to save my husband?”

The white-haired ancestor stood with his hands behind his back. He nodded and replied, “He can only depend on his own fortune. And…as his life force origin is damaged, he will no longer be able to maintain his undying state. His life force origin will gradually disappear and I’m afraid Jian Wushuang will really die.”

At this point, the white-haired ancestor saw that Leng Rushuang’s face was pale and she almost fell to the ground. He comforted her, “However, you don’t have to worry so much. This piece of billion-year-old profound ice can slow down Jian Wushuang’s life force to the greatest extent. It will take at least several chaos cycles for Jian Wushuang to truly die.”

Hearing this, Leng Rushuang couldn’t help but turn pale. She felt cold all over.

When the Overlord saw this, he seemed to have thought of something. He looked at the white-haired ancestor and hesitated for a while. Finally, a look of determination appeared in his eyes. He gritted his teeth and said, “Patriarch, isn’t there a secret technique that can…”

“Nonsense!”

Before the great Overlord could finish, the white-haired ancestor glared at him and chided, “Grandson, come out with me!”

With that, the white-haired ancestor walked out of the ice cave.

Outside the ice cave, snow was falling. At a glance, the world was a vast expanse of white. In the distance, countless mountains were covered in white snow, as if there were snow dragons lying on the ground.

The Overlord followed behind the white-haired ancestor in silence, allowing the snow to fall on their shoulders and dye them white.

“Grandson, I know what you want to say, but the secret skill must be guided by the blood essence of Overlord body. I have already repaid your favor by saving Jian Wushuang. Do you want me to offer my life blood essence for him?”

The white-haired ancestor said in a deep voice with his back to the Overlord.

Bang!

“Old ancestor, please save her to the end. I’m willing to offer my own blood essence!”

The great Overlord knelt down on the ground and said with his head buried. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“You’re offering your life essence blood?”

The white-haired ancestor snorted and said, “Bastard! There are very few people in our Overlord body clan to begin with, and those who can truly awaken the undying Overlord body are even fewer. After my death, it wasn’t easy for me to awaken you, and now you’re actually offering your life essence blood for a mere outsider? Do you still want to break through to the Supreme martial artist level? Where do you think our Overlord body clan is?”

“Nonsense!”

When the white-haired ancestor said the last word ‘nonsense’, he was truly enraged. An ice mountain in the distance suddenly exploded!

The Overlord trembled when he heard this. However, after taking a deep breath, he mustered up his courage and said, “Forefather! The reason why I want to save Jian Wushuang is for the sake of the Overlord clan!”

“Oh? For the sake of our Overlord body clan?”

The white-haired ancestor turned around and looked down at the Overlord who was kneeling in front of him. He sneered and said, “Then tell me, how did you consider this?”

The Overlord nodded and replied in a deep voice, “Forefather, as you said, there are only a few members of the Overlord’s clan, and even fewer can truly awaken the Overlord body. It’s because of this that the Overlord’s body clan has never been able to become a top clan among the ten thousand clans in the universe. However, with Jian Wushuang’s help, our Overlord body clan might really become a top clan in the universe and prosper forever!”

“Eternal prosperity? With the strength of a little fellow who can’t even protect himself and hasn’t even broken through to the Supreme level?”

The white-haired ancestor laughed as if he had heard a funny joke.

“Not bad.”

However, the Overlord nodded solemnly and replied, “Ancestor, you don’t understand Jian Wushuang. That’s why you said that. Do you know that when I first met Jian Wushuang, he was only a fifth-level Ruler? But in just tens of thousands of years, he was able to kill a Supreme!”

“Forefather, what does this mean? I’ve always been a good judge of character. Jian Wushuang is a person who will repay kindness and revenge. We saved Jian Wushuang today. If he can come back to life, the repayment in the future will definitely be much greater than what we have today!”

Seeing that the white-haired ancestor was about to speak again, the Overlord directly kowtowed and said, “Please help your grandson this once, old ancestor, as a way to pave the way for your grandson’s future!”

“You…”

The white-haired ancestor pondered for a moment before sighing. He took a step forward and touched the Overlord’s head, “Forget it. I’ve already reached the end of my path of cultivation anyway. I’ll take the present as a gamble for the future.”

The Overlord quickly stood up with joy on his face. Just as he was about to thank the white-haired ancestor, the white-haired ancestor glared at him and said, “Not only are you siding with an outsider, but you’re also being so impetuous. How can you be like this?”

Seeing the Overlord sneer, the white-haired ancestor could not help but feel angry and amused at the same time. In the end, he shook his head and said, “I can now use my life essence blood to perform a secret skill to save Jian Wushuang, but I have to be blunt. It’s equivalent to reconstructing a body for Jian Wushuang and creating an indestructible Overlord body. The chance of success is only one percent. If he can’t hold on and his life essence completely collapses, don’t blame me.”

“This…”

Hearing this, the Overlord couldn’t make up his mind for a moment and said, “Ancestor, why don’t we let Jian Wushuang’s cultivation partner make the decision?”

The white-haired ancestor nodded and stepped into the ice cave again.

Leng Rushuang kneeled beside Jian Wushuang on the ice bed. She touched his face with her slender fingers and sobbed.

Seeing this, the white-haired ancestor’s eyes flickered and he said in a deep voice, “Little girl, I’m giving Jian Wushuang a good fortune, but there’s also the risk of death. Do you want it or not?”
