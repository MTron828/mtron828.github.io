Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

Rumble!

When everyone was holding the breath, the faint gold lightning that descended from the dark clouds finally collided directly with the swordsmanship that Universe God Dong Men had put to play.

After a tremendous noise, everyone saw that the ground of Tribulation Passing Pinnacle caved in while Universe God Dong Men fell into the bottom of the pit. He stood up after a while but his clothes were all torn and turned black, even his originally fair skin became dark.

He was covered in blood and his aura was extremely weak. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“He survived?” Jian Wushuang was beaming with joy.

“Don’t be too happy just yet. It was merely the first strike.” King of Venomous Worms said, “Universe God Dong Men is undergoing his God Test in the Second Heaven, so there are two levels of lightning. The very first one earlier was weaker. The second lighting would be much stronger than the first one, which is the real threat to him!”

“If I were him, I would seize the time before the second lightning descends and take an elixir to recover. So that my body can resume to my peak. Then, I could be well prepared for the second lightning.

Jian Wushuang’s face grew solemn.

Under Jian Wushuang’s gaze, Universe God Dong Men who was on the peak of the Tribunal Passing Pinnacle sat down and straightway took in the few elixirs that he had prepared. Those elixirs were prepared for him to pass through the God Test. Among them, there was an extremely precious elixir, Tribunal Passing Elixir. Universe God Dong Men took them all in a mouthful.

With the power of the elixirs, Universe God Dong Men’s aura recovered swiftly. He resumed to his peak in a short time.

“Not bad, he is well prepared.” King of Venomous Worms joked.

“Dong Men has recovered to his peak state. It seems like the possibility of him passing through the second lightning should be quite high,” Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

In the void above Tribunal Passing Pinnacle, among the huge dark cloud, the second lightning continued to store up its strength.

Along with the accumulation, the force within the dark clouds were growing strong, even a little too ridiculously strong.

“Huh?”

The Universe God from Dayu Palace felt the force and they creased their eyebrows.

“What is going on? Even though it is the second lightning, isn’t this force a little too strong?”

“It is a little too strong. When I undergo my God Test in the Second Heaven, the force of the second lightning wasn’t this strong.”

“The force grew stronger, so doesn’t it mean that the second lightning would be even more powerful?”

“Why would it be so?”

Many faces of the Universe Gods in Dayu Palace grew grave.

They could tell that the power of the second lightning was a little over but they couldn’t change anything even though they were anxious.

God Test, under normal situation, should be passed through alone. Although one could assist by force, once assistance was provided to pass through God Test, both the person who was helped and the person who helped would be restrained in terms of growth. It would be impossible for both person to pass through their God Test in the future.

Hence, even though they knew Universe God Dong Men was in danger, no one dared to help. There was no one who could help.

“I thought Universe God Dong Men would be dealing with ordinary God Test. But from the looks of it, it doesn’t seem like it.” King of Venomous Worms said.

“What do you mean?” Jian Wushuang creased his eyebrows.

“I’m not sure but it might be because of the massacre that he once caused.” King of Venomous Worms replied.

“Massacre?” Jian Wushuang stunned, “Massacre would affect God Test too?”

“Of course,” King of Venomous Worms explained, “The more massacre there is, especially those that involved many innocent lives, it would affect God Test accordingly. For instance, the people in Holocaust Sect, they often slaughter massively and refined millions and millions of living things in order to build up their strength. Hence, the God Tests that they need to pass through would be extremely terrifying too.”

“Universe God Dong Men should have once caused a massacre when he was young!”

“Is it so?” Jian Wushuang’s face grew grave.

Just like how King of Venomous Worms had said, Universe God Dong Men once had an accident when he first spring up in his hometown. He was once a mad demon and he killed many innocent people during that period of time. Hence, the record of massacre.

Later on, even though he stabled down, it heavily affected the God Test that he was going through.

When he passed through the God Test in the First Heaven, the massacre that he caused didn’t affect the God Test much. However, when it came to the God Test in the Second Heaven, it finally took shape.

“It seemed that Universe God Dong Men was afraid of trouble.” King of Venomous Worms said.

Jian Wushuang looked solemn.

Universe God Dong Men stood on the peak of Tribunal Passing Pinnacle and already recovered to his tip-top condition. He lifted his head and stared into the void above. His eyes were full of insanity.

Among the dark clouds, the second lightning had done storing up its strength.

The terrifying force spread across long ago.

Finally, the second lightning descended!

Previously, the first lightning was merely faint gold but the second lightning was gilded!

The gilded lightning struck directly while Universe God Dong Men flipped his hand and a black turtle shell appeared.

The black turtle shell gave out an ancient aura. Along with Universe God Dong Men’s will power, the black turtle shell started expanding and covered his entire body.

Universe God Dong Men himself, had a pair of eye gleaming with lightning while his entire body was giving free rein of Divine Power. He was giving all his strength to put his strongest swordsmanship to play.

Bang!

The power of the lightning set off and it shattered the sword light that Universe God Dong Men gave out. Along with the explosion, the sword in his hand was casted off that instance. On the other hand, the gilded lightning continued to strike at Universe God Dong Men without hesitation. At the most crucial moment, it hit the black turtle shell on Universe God Dong Men.

The black turtle shell presented its impressive protective power and endured the power of the gilded lightning. It didn’t break directly under the hit.

That sight shocked various Universe Gods that were spectating.

“Universe God Dong Men has such a treasure with him?”

“That turtle shell should be a very impressive Chaotic treasure, right? It provides quite good of a protection.”

“Protection by the turtle shell. It seems that Dong Men should be fine.”

Universe Gods from Dayu Palace let out a sigh of relief.

Just then…

“No!!!”

A loud scream was heard from the peak of Tribunal Passing Pinnacle and everyone looked over.

They saw that?an unprecedented terror across Universe God Dong Men’s face. Just as everyone thought he would survive the second lightning, no one noticed that there was a fine emerald flame within the second lightning which broke through the defense of the turtle shell and ravaged Universe God Dong Men’s body.

The emerald flame looked extremely weak, as though it was going to die out anytime.

But the moment it made contact with Universe God Dong Men’s body, vroom! The emerald flame suddenly soared and Universe God Dong Men never made any other noise anymore. He was engulfed by the emerald flame entirely and suddenly vanished like smoke!

Universe God Dong Men, died!
