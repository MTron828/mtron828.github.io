“Sword Emperor, Jian Wushuang!!!”

Sir God Xue Dao looked ferocious when he read the name and there was boundless hatred that filled his eyes.

“Jian Wushuang?” Great Emperor Colored Glaze was surprised, “Jian Wushuang is in Green Fire World too?”

“Yes,” Sir God Xue Dao nodded heavily, “Jian Wushuang is widely acknowledged as the number one expert in Green Fire World and the entirety of Green Fire World is under his control. My senior, Emperor God Xie Xin didn’t know about this but charged in directly. In the end, he died by Jian Wushuang’s hand.

“When I received the news, I knew that I couldn’t match Sword Emperor evenly, nor could I take revenge on my senior’s behalf. Hence, I spread the news about the ancient battlefield.”

“Originally, I intended to spread the news about Green Fire World altogether so that all experts from various forces in Eternal Chaotic World would make trouble with Sword Emperor. However, Jian Wushuang would definitely hear rumors ahead of time. By then, due to high pressure, he might hand out Green Fire World proactively. Then, I would lose my chance to take revenge for my senior!” Sir God Xue Dao clenched his fists.

“I see,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze nodded faintly, “So you came to see me personally because you hoped that I’d kill Jian Wushuang for you?”

“Great Emperor judges judiciously,” Sir God Xue Dao bowed politely to Colored Glaze Great Emperor, “Although Jian Wushuang is powerful, he’d definitely die if it was Great Emperor that attacked him personally. By then, Great Emperor could conquer the entire Green Fire World. It’s a win-win situation!”

“Hehe, if Green Fire World has the great potential you describe, even I couldn’t conquer it on my own. Sanctuary Alliance would definitely get involved. However, if I could conquer Green Fire World, I would receive a great advantage,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze smiled.

“Sir God Xue Dao, I promise you that I will kill Jian Wushuang for you if you lead me to Green Fire World.

“Thank you, Great Emperor,” Sir God Xue Dao was filled with excitement. He immediately asked, “Great Emperor, when do we depart?”

“We won’t delay any more. We leave this instance,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze said in a cold voice.

Sir God Xue Dao immediately led the way while Great Emperor Colored Glaze and Emperor God Shi Yu flew to Green Fire World together.

The three of them shuttled through the ancient battlefield but didn’t stop at all along the way.

After some time, the three of them arrived near Green Fire World.

“Great Emperor, take a look. This is Green Fire World,” Sir God Xue Dao pointed at the big world in front.

“As expected, it is really a complete big world. The closer we get, the more intense the spiritual influence of heaven and earth is. It seems that Green Fire World is really in the core of the ancient battlefield,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze stared at Green Fire World in front of her as joy shimmered in her beautiful eyes.

“Shi Yu, you stay here with Sir God Xue Dao. I’ll head over to meet Sword Emperor.”

Great Emperor Colored Glaze said and immediately flew off.

Vroom vroom.

When Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s original body with divine might appeared at the border of Green Fire World, the higher-ups immediately noticed through the formation.

Jian Wushuang recognized the incomer at the first instant.

“Great Emperor Colored Glaze, it’s her?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He had once crossed paths with Great Emperor Colored Glaze.

Back then, in order to take revenge on Soaring Heaven King Palace, he had barged into Colored Glaze Sanctuary to massacre the experts from Soaring Heaven King Palace and corner them in a desperate situation.

In the end, Soaring Heaven King Palace had asked Great Emperor Colored Glaze for assistance.

The Great Emperor had made an appearance personally and only spoken one sentence. Jian Wushuang had no choice but to back off.

Hence, there was barely a dispute between Jian Wushuang and Great Emperor Colored Glaze.

At least, Jian Wushuang didn’t quite like Great Emperor Colored Glaze.

“Great Emperor Colored Glaze descended personally. It would be impossible if I wanted to hide the existence of Green Fire World,” Jian Wushuang knew that clearly.

Just then...

“Jian Wushuang!”

The cold voice that contained boundless might suddenly rang from Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s mouth and reverberated in the surrounding void.

Jian Wushuang, who was in Green Fire World, was shocked.

“Great Emperor Colored Glaze knows of my existence?” Jian Wushuang thought.

He instantly understood that it was definitely the person who had intentionally spread the news of Green Fire World and himself that informed Great Emperor Colored Glaze.

“When the news spread, it never brought up me or Green Fire World. But he only informed Great Emperor Colored Glaze alone. Hehe, the person is worried that I won’t take the pressure and abandon Green Fire World. By then, he wouldn’t stand a chance to kill me.” Jian Wushuang guessed the person’s thought instantly.

As she already knew of his existence, Jian Wushuang didn’t intentionally hide. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Swoosh!

In the blink of an eye, Jian Wushuang had already leaped out of Green Fire World and come before Great Emperor Colored Glaze.

As for the experts from Green Fire World, they stayed back in Green Fire World.

A Great Emperor had descended personally. The cultivators from Green Fire World weren’t capable enough to deal with it.

“It’s really you,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze looked at Jian Wushuang and she looked surprised.

She was in doubt of what Sir God Xue Dao had said earlier, but then when she saw Jian Wushuang, her suspicion vanished.

“It seems like the person was right. Your Green Fire World is really unusual. Otherwise, it would be absolutely impossible to nurture such a top monster,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze said coldly.

“Great Emperor Colored Glaze, as you already know of Green Fire World and you also know of my existence, then we shouldn’t beat around the bush. Tell me, what do you want?” Jian Wushuang’s face was cold.

Then, he was totally different from when he had been on Soaring Heaven Land.

Back then, when he had been dealing with Great Emperor Colored Glaze, she had only been a consciousness incarnation. However, he had no choice but to lower his head.

But then, although Great Emperor Colored Glaze had come personally, he wasn’t fearful of her at all.

“Very simple. Let me see your Green Fire World,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze said.

“Then?” Jian Wushuang asked in a deep voice.

“If there’s nothing unique about Green Fire World, I naturally will leave immediately. If it is just like how the person mentioned... I will stay back in Green Fire World for a while,” Great Emperor Colored Glaze smiled. Although she had put it in an indirect way, Jian Wushuang knew the meaning behind it clearly.

“What if I don’t agree?” Jian Wushuang said.

“Don’t agree?” Great Emperor Colored Glaze’s voice was cold.

“If you don’t agree, I will attack directly and conquer Green Fire World. Whoever doesn’t yield to me, I’ll kill all of them. As for you... Jian Wushuang, I know that there’s a mysterious expert, Emperor Thirteen, behind you. Because of him, I will not kill you, but it’s good enough as long as I trap you in or suppress you. Then, if Emperor Thirteen surfaces, I shall pass you back to him.”
