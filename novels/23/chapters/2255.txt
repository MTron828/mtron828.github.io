Chapter 2256 From Two Different Worlds

“Sword Emperor? Emperor Bai?” Leng Ruxue was shocked.“Looks like I underestimated these Chaotic Realm rascals of this era. This Sword Emperor and Emperor Bai... they are good. Especially that Sword Emperor, he slaughtered more than a dozen Divine Demons while surrounded by twenty-odd Chaotic Divine Demons, and with lightning speed as well. With the restrictions placed on this land, even I may not be equipped to go against him,” Bing Shan smiled, but he was full of praise for Jian Wushuang.

To have reached that level at a Chaotic Realm, he would have been considered a genius back at the Absolute Beginning Divine World.

“Sword Emperor, Jian Wushuang...” Leng Ruxue gave a strange smile. “When the link passage at Heaven’s Horizon opens in 3,900 years, I’ll make my way directly back to the Absolute Beginning Divine World, I won’t get to see him anymore. Haha, he said he wanted to save that stupid woman... looks like that was no more than a joke.” Leng Ruxue had always had contempt for Jian Wushuang.

That was despite Jian Wushuang’s jaw-dropping speed of improvement in the Eternal Chaotic World.

Jian Wushuang had surpassed her expectations multiple times, but none of that had changed Leng Ruxue’s opinion of him.

After all, Leng Ruxue was certain she and Jian Wushuang had come from two different worlds in the very beginning.

It was true that Jian Wushuang was extremely talented.

But his talents were only limited to that world.

He was stuck there with no way of leaving those lands – of course, his achievements were limited.

To Leng Ruxue, Jian Wushuang had already peaked.

Jian Wushuang had no chance of improving.

But she was different.

She had the Heavenly Body and a Master of Holy Land-level teacher behind her.

3,900 years later, she would head towards the Absolute Beginning Divine World through that link tunnel and truly begin to emerge. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

She would rise step by step in the Absolute Beginning Divine World, eventually surpassing her master.

But Jian Wushuang would forever be trapped in that land, Chaotic Realm would be the highest attainable for him.

“Poor Jian Wushuang,” Leng Ruxue shook her head and laughed.

The moment news of Old Monster Jiao’s death spread, Jian Wushuang made his way to another Void at lightning speed.

Before long, he was in a dark Void and saw a white-haired elder standing there quietly.

The white-haired elder squinted his eyes. He was a like a ball of air, no aura exuding from him at all. He stood there as if he was waiting for Jian Wushuang to arrive.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes were fixed on the elder the moment he saw him.

“It’s him after all,” Jian Wushuang took a deep breath and stepped forward.

“Young Jian Wushuang, I am here to pay respects to the One-Star Man,” Jian Wushuang said respectfully.

The respect was sincere.

The white-haired elder indeed deserved the respect of Jian Wushuang.

He was greatly indebted to Jian Wushuang.

Back at the Buddhist Demon Sea, as Jian Wushuang was being chased down by Acheron Palace, at that edge of life and death when Old Monster Jiao’s dragon had attempted to eat Jian Wushuang, it had been him.

He had saved Jian Wushuang’s life.

Not only had the One-Star Man stopped the black water dragon, but he had also provided Jian Wushuang with a decent opportunity before escorting Jian Wushuang out of the Buddhist Demon Sea.

One-Star Man had both guided and saved him.

Jian Wushuang naturally had great respect for him.

Jian Wushuang also knew that the great hand that had stopped Old Monster Jiao outside Thunderbolt Island had been performed by the One-Star Man.

“Jian Wushuang?”

“Lad, that is your name?” One-Star Man opened his calm, stagnant eyes and glanced upon Jian Wushuang.

“Yes,” Jian Wushuang nodded.

“I watched you fight Old Monster Jiao. It’s only been a few thousand years, but your powers have improved so much?” One-Star Man was impressed and shocked.

When he first met Jian Wushuang at the Buddhist Demon Sea, he had been but a Real God lad.

Even though he already had good fighting power, Old Monster Jiao, One-Star Man, and maybe even the dragon could take down Jian Wushuang easily.

“To be able to force Old Monster Jiao to such a predicament... I think even I am no match for you,” One-Star Man said casually.

“Nonsense. Your powers are limitless, but only restricted to the rules of this land. If not for that, you could take down thousands of lads like me in an instant,” Jian Wushuang laughed.

He was flattering him, but there was some truth in it as well.

He could only take down the Ancient Era experts due to the restrictions.

Without it, even a Chaotic Divine Demon could have pressed him down.

Indeed, experts like Old Monster Jiao and One-Star Man could have killed him without wasting a single breath.

“Haha, you talk well,” One-Star Man laughed in a way that may or may not have been genuine.

Jian Wushuang straightened himself and said, “Thank you so much for your help. If not for you, Old Monster Jiao would have escaped.”

“It’s nothing,” One-Star Man waved his hand. “I just happened to be around. Old Monster Jiao was from the Holy Land, my enemy since the beginning. My consciousness incarnation fought him several times back in the Buddhist Demon Sea. I would never miss the chance to take him down.”

“Thank you regardless,” Jian Wushuang was still very grateful. “Oh yes, if you are free, would you care to join me at Thunderbolt Island?”

“Thunderbolt Island? It’s okay,” One-Star Man shook his head. “Even though I have awakened, it won’t be for long. I do not wish to tangle myself up with the experts of this era.” Jian Wushuang was disappointed.

Jian Wushuang asked again, “Senior, did you wake up for the link passage at Heaven’s Horizon?”

“Yes,” One-Star Man nodded as his gaze turned solemn.
