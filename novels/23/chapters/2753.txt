“Oh?” Jian Wushuang slightly frowned. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“I’m just an overly stubborn person and won’t change any decision I’ve made. I’ve said many years ago that I won’t join any forces no matter the number of benefits given or whoever gives it. Therefore, I can only reject your kind offer, Alliance Master Su Han.” said Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin.

Jian Wushuang smiled happily when he heard that without any hint of anger. “Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin, why don’t we exchange the conditions since you aren’t willing to join any forces. I don’t need you to join my Sword Alliance, but only need you to obey my orders for the next one thousand years which means the Sword Alliance is hiring you for one thousand years with a single Huangji Golden Pill. What do you think?”

“Hire me?” Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin was moved by the suggestion.

It was natural for him to be against directly joining and serving the Sword Alliance.

However, if it was just a job with them only hiring him for 1,000 years... Matters would be different.

Hiring him for 1,000 years meant he would be working for the Sword Alliance during that 1,000 years. However, he could leave without any hesitation once the 1,000-year-period was up. He would not be a member of the Sword Alliance from the beginning till the end, hence it could be considered that he had never joined the Sword Alliance.

As he was sitting on a chair in the Grand Hall, Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin tapped his fingers on the armchair as he started thinking in silence.

He looked up again after a while. “Alliance Master Su Han, I admit I can’t think of any reasons to reject your offer.”

Jian Wushuang smiled when he heard that before throwing the Huangji Golden Pill to Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin with a wave of his hand.

“You can directly consume this Huangji Golden Pill and try making a breakthrough to a High-level Grand Ultimate God. However, I wonder how much time you’ll need?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“A maximum of three years. Regardless if I’ve successfully made a breakthrough and become a High-level Grand Ultimate God within three years or not, I’ll head to the Sword Alliance to obey your commands thereafter,” said Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin.

“Alright, I’ll be waiting for you in the Sword Alliance. I hope you won’t disappoint me.” Jian Wushuang glanced at Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin before turning around and leaving.

In the Grand Hall, the lady in green clothes stood beside Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin.

“Master, will you really head to the Sword Alliance after three years?” The green-clothed lady looked at Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin in surprise.

Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin smiled indifferently. “Of course, since when have you seen me go against my words?”

The green-clothed lady was stunned.

“Alliance Master Su Han was willing to hand me the Huangji Golden Pill so early on because he believed in my character. What kind of a person would I be if I don’t go to the Sword Alliance three years later?” Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin asked.

His right hand held on to the Huangji Golden Pill tightly while a calculative look flashed through his eyes.

The Huangji Golden Pill was something he really needed.

...

Jian Wushuang soon caught up with Strange Old Tong after leaving Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin’s place.

“Huangji Golden Pill?” A longing look also flashed through the eyes of a sloppy and dirty old man who was wearing ordinary-looking grey clothing as Jian Wushuang took the pill out.

“This Huangji Golden Pill will be yours if you agree to fight for my Sword Alliance for one thousand years,” said Jian Wushuang directly.

“Fight? The Sword Alliance had already become a first-rated force in the Danyang Continent based on my understanding. Apart from that, the Alliance is considered one of the strongest first-rated forces. However, you’re still thinking of ways to gather experts for a fight. Could you aim to be one of the pinnacle forces?” Strange Old Tong did not directly agree to Jian Wushuang’s offer but asked such questions instead.

“Yes, the Sword Alliance isn’t satisfied with being one of the first-rated forces,” said Jian Wushuang.

“If that’s the case, the Sword Alliance might go against the Divine Demon Sect in the future?” The look in Strange Old Tong’s eyes sharpened.

“It’s not a so-called possible, but a definite will. The next target of the Sword Alliance is the Divine Demon Sect,” said Jian Wushuang directly.

“Great. I want this Huangji Golden Pill of yours,” said Strange Old Tong.

Jian Wushuang could not help but secretly smile.

He had obtained information from Old Snake earlier that Strange Old Tong had a weird way of doing things and had some accumulated grudges against several forces in the Danyang Continent. The Divine Demon Sect was among the forces he had the deepest hatred from a long time ago.

Now that Jian Wushuang had taken the Huangji Golden Pill out and directly highlighted the fact that the Sword Alliance would go against the Divine Demon Sect, Strange Old Tong immediately agreed to it.

“I can give this Huangji Golden Pill to you now. You can try to make a breakthrough right now if you’re well prepared. However, I’ll wait for you for only three years, will this three-year-time be enough?” Jian Wushuang asked.

“Three years? That’s too short. I’ve previously tried multiple times to make a breakthrough to the Peak Grand Ultimate God. Now that I have the Huangji Golden Pill to assist, this should be my chance with the greatest certainty, hence I naturally need to prepare to the best of my ability. As such, it’ll be impossible without another ten to twenty years. How about this? I’ll follow and fight for you first while I’ll try making a breakthrough again when the Sword Alliance has some idle time,” said Strange Old Tong.

“Alright.” Jian Wushuang nodded.

The strange old man then immediately followed Jian Wushuang as Jian Wushuang continued to win over other experts.

There were five Huangji Golden Pills. He gave one to Old Snake, one to Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin, and one to Strange Old Tong. He also managed to win over two other experts on the list with the remaining two pills. Although they were only Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods, they promised to fight for the Sword Alliance for 1,000 years.

There were three High-level Grand Ultimate Gods that were extremely strong on the expert list Old Snake previously gave him.

However, Jian Wushuang only managed to find Strange Old Tong while one of the remaining two had disappeared many years ago and nobody knew if he was dead or alive. The other person had also disappeared some time ago and nobody knew that person’s whereabouts. Therefore, Jian Wushuang could only invite Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods.

At that point, he had managed to win over one High-level Grand Ultimate God and three Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods with those four Huangji Golden Pills.

In addition, one or two out of those three Primary-level Grand Ultimate Gods might be able to make a breakthrough to the High-level Grand Ultimate God realm with the Huangji Golden Pill’s assistance.

‘I’ve used up all five Huangji Golden Pills, what I need to do next is to wait in silence.’ Jian Wushuang returned to the Sword Alliance and started waiting while meditating.

News of Saber Master’s death had not been disclosed, hence the Crimson Stone Fort and Danyang Continent were still quite peaceful.

Three years had passed in the flash.

Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin and two other experts that Jian Wushuang invited had come to the Sword Alliance.

However, when they met Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin once again—the divine power omitted from him showed that he had reached the High-level Grand Ultimate God realm.

“Congratulations, Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin.” Jian Wushuang looked at Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin with a smile on his face.

“It’s all thanks to Alliance Master Su Han’s Huangji Golden Pill or it won’t be so easy for me to make a breakthrough.” A smile appeared on Grand Ultimate God Jue Xin’s face even though he had always been someone indifferent.
